TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good Sunday morning brains praise the Lord praise the Lord Most High it's wonderful to be in his presence again to share with you the joy of the Lord the Word of God the promise of this age may the great Holy Spirit bless us today as we come together giving glory honor and praise to his name let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father approaching you by the way of prayer to the bluff Christ made a great holy spirit anoint the Word of God for hearts and maybe have such a wonderful time of fellowship feasting around the table you have spread receive O God or gratitude or thankfulness for your grace and mercy in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen praise God today I read from the Gospel of Luke chapter 4 verses 14 to 21 which reads thus and Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the Prophet I sayeth and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives recovering of sight to the blind and to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears now here we see from this text how Jesus was returning from the temptation in the wilderness and came back to Nazareth and the Bible says he went to church he went to the synagogue as his custom was as his habit was to go into the house of God to give glory and praise to Jehovah if we want to be like the Lord Jesus then we need to be in church we need to be able to worship God and give glory and praise to his marvelous name well you may say brother Simon we can't go to our church building because of kovaydin because of gum restrictions and so we are not free to congregate in huge numbers as we normally do yes that may be the case but at least you can go to church by watching faithfully your church's website life stream what they are offering from the word at this particular time if you cannot have the entire loaf then at least try to get a slice we a Christian ought to read their Bible pray every day and faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God so the importance of church attendance cannot be overemphasized for the Bible tells us for Satan not the assembling of yourselves together as the manner or the habit of some people are they just dismiss it they they it's casual about it and may I say this what is the church the Church of God is not a building ecclesia meaning called out once we are called into a fellowship we are called to fellowship with our with God and with our fellow men of like precious faith so let us be faithful in this are of change when we are changing from attachments to buildings and positions and things of that nature to the ground where we enter into are spiritually into our closet where we are worshiping God in spirit and in the truth so so let the Holy Spirit bring about that mental and spiritual change that we ought to be just as faithful with our online stream because this is the Church of today this is the way that we practice church this is the way we have church so the you approach it casually but soberly and seriously with righteousness and sincerity of the Lord God within your heart and being a holy spirit bless you praise God for evermore so Jesus returned from the deserts the wilderness the the place of temptation where he my friends came back and returned to his hometown of Nazareth and went to the synagogue there to worship God now just imagine the scene in the synagogue colorful Eastern garments all gathered together in the synagogue and here comes this young Jewish young man and enters into the single also and they all were together and as Jewish custom was and is there are times when individuals are allowed to read from the Torah so Jesus rose up to read from the Torah and delivered the message of the Spirit of the Lord is upon me out of the Book of Isaiah and when he had finished and this is where I take my topic from the Bible says and he closed the book and sat down he gave it to the minister and he sat down Oh speak to God I'd like to speak today on the closing of the book of redemption the closing of the book of redemption my friends the Bible says that he sat down now when Stephen saw him let's eat Stephen in the book of Acts saw the Lord Jesus after they had stoned him mocked him Stephen the Bible says lifted up his eyes looked up to heaven and he saw the Lord and the Lord was standing the Bible says he the Lord was standing praise God hallelujah I'm so glad friends that Jesus is still standing up for us I am happy that he is still standing in the gap on her behalf he is standing with us in between the judgments of God and the mercy of God so he is like the rampart he is our fortress he is our great honor mow the armor of God to protect us and keep us from the plagues and the wrath of God so I am happy today that Jesus Christ our risen Lord is standing for us my friends let me say this he is timing still as our great intercessor praise God hallelujah we need no Saints we need no one else but she look away and see Jesus only standing there interceding on our behalf father I paid the price of judgment I took upon myself the sins of the world I accepted it all and I paid for all there since Father forgive them they did not know what they were doing for in the time of their ignorance and in their darkness Lord I tell you Father forgive them amen and so I'm so happy that Jesus is still our intercessor aren't you happy that he is still our intercessor and that he is still standing up for us and standing in the cash I want to say I am glad he is standing still standing as our mediator we need no other mediator for the Bible tells us clearly there is one mediator between God and man the man not the woman not any other person but the man Christ Jesus is the only mediator between God and man and there is salvation in no other name but in the name of Jesus Christ or risen Lord from the glory of God hallelujah I'm so very happy about that I'm glad that he is standing for us praise God standing as our lawyer as our advocate the one who is standing and arguing are presenting our case for us thank God that we have Jesus Christ our Lord and it's the greatest lawyer the world has ever seen a lawyer that has never lost the case for everyone that comes to him he has the power to st. he has the power to heal he has the power to deliver he has the power to redeem and so he stands in the presence and places his blood as the evidence and as the proof that the price was paid and now he can redeem back his purchase position ui who were once in Satan's pawn shop you and I who once was in Satan's grip now Satan has to let you go for because the price of your Redemption has been paid and I'm so glad he brought me out of the pawn shop out of the miry clay and put my feet on the rock of ages' to stay here in forevermore taste Vita God hallelujah for the Lord Jesus Christ who has brought me out for a great shout glorifying and worshipping God hallelujah here we are brother sisters with this joy of God in our hearts glory to God now the Bible says that he closed the book then gave it to the minister and sat down now in the book of Revelation chapter 5 we read in the scriptures and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book thank God it's him not them but are they but I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written whips in and on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man no man in heaven in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither No thereupon so no man no human being can open this book no human being of himself can interpret this book no human being by his exalted position by his popularity by his intellectualism by his human accumulation of wisdom can open or interpret this book but this book is held in the hand of Almighty God and so the Bible says and John says and I went much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there in there on and one of the elders said unto me weak not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth in all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne lower to God the rest you can read where the elders rejoice the four beasts rejoice they sang a new song the word worthy the word worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof and I beheld and heard a voice of many angels around the throne and then and the elders and the numbers were were ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands saying that a loud voice worthy is the lamb to receive power riches wisdom strength and honor and glory and blessing praise be to God hallelujah what a scene in Nazareth that day what a scene also in heaven on that day for the scene in Nazareth my friends was a pre figure of this scene that was to come so we understand here clearly amen that the book was in the hand of the Father amen there it was the Bible tells us clearly that the lamb came and took the book now the Bible describes this lamp as a live it was slain in other words a bloody lamb a bleeding lamb but not only was this lamb bloody and bleeding let us recognize that just as Jesus went into the business and had a humdinger of a fight our trial attempt and temptations personally with the devil and overcame the devil and that's why we can overcome today because he is over our overcome oh now he overcame the devil in the wilderness how did he overcome by the Word of God amen praise the Lord he always said it is written it is written he referred the devil back to the Word of God and he defeated the devil on the basis of the Word of God now here we find he comes out of the wilderness after his fight with the devil but that was a procedure of himself and how he made friends would go and have a grape fight with Satan again I we call it the greatest battle ever fought for there he had this the battle started in heaven of course it will it was right through his ministry but it intensified in the Garden of Gethsemane what the Bible said under they strain the stress the pressure of this greatest battle ever fought that did this sweat became us blood an angel had to come and be straightening him in that garden Oh takes me to God that he went to Calvary for us because after the great fight in Gethsemane then he went to the great Mount Calvary battle and there my friends again we see him surrounded by Devils on every hand Devils mocking him him the Word of God made flesh now the same Devils are here the day when he reverts back to his word form and those same Devils are mocking him because he had no beauty to be desired of him he had none of their Grace's he had none of their acceptability but there he was hanging on that cruel cross on Mount Calvary to be mocked by man the Creator being mocked by his own creation all because they didn't recognize him the word that he did not have the kind of beauty they were thinking he didn't have the natural beauty he did not have the theological beauty he did not and this thing that could draw them to him his reputation yeah it uh things said about him the things that were blackening his name the very background his history of his birth and life everything the devil took induct every dirt he could find upon Jesus and upon his name but glory be to God there is no on the name as great as this name for the name of Jesus every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord of all and so here we find my friends that John heard a voice in heaven saying first of all let me touch on the fact that John wept and John was weeping because there was none to open this book and I say John being in the spirit be in the spirit in the presence of God recognize that this book was an important book that held the secrets of God for the rest of of earthly life right back into eternity and John wept there in the presence of God and one of the twenty-four elders says John with not John for the Lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed John said and I turned to see this Lion of the tribe of Judah but when I looked instead of seeing a lion there'ss to him as it was slain in other words there stood a bloody bleeding lamb as if it was in a battle yes he was it was the Lamb of God that taken away the sins of the world and he was in the gray this battles ever thought and he fought all the way through Galilee to get cemani and on the mountain in Calvary back down in the valley of Gehenna or or similar type of Hell the Bible tells us he went down into hell and there had a titanic battle with the spirits for the souls of those in prison now for before his death and his blood as the Lamb of God was shed the Patriots placed their faith in the sacrificial blood of the natural lands that were slain but by faith as a bell hand by revelation that they all have they recognize that the shedding of the blood of these natural lands along the way was us were symbols types shadows prefiguring the coming of the real lamb the Lamb of God that will not take away your sins for a year and you must come back to Jerusalem the next year to be cleansed again but this lamb well take away the sins of the world once this man as the Bible says sat down oh praise God he just sat down and get away with her sins once and for all it was all gone thank God my sins are gone there underneath the love of Jesus Christ and I'm free I thank God I'm free because this bloody lamb went into a battle praise God of course brothers being the lion being the lamb is speaking about they the personalities of that once he has will you receive it now as your lamb as your edema or your savior if not his personality will change though sinners in the hands of an angry god you will be in the presence of the Living God who will then be the supreme judge they the white hair just the Ancient of Days that will judge you by His Word at that particular time no brother sister here we see this limb having gone through the great battle going down into hell having a fight there what Satan unseen just my friends of the outward form of him hanging on the cross being taken down and place with either to but his soul went into battle against the demons of Hell and the great battle was raging for our our salvation oh praise God forevermore here he came up now and because he paid the price for the church as bows paint the redemption price for roofs a simple type of the Bride of Christ now he could come so he came to the presence of his father amen and they're presented his blood his own blood as the evidence that he had finished the mission the great work of redemption upon the face of the earth all thanks be to God hallelujah so that cry went out that there was no man in earth in heaven or under heaven that could take this book and open the seals no man but God Himself could this is why Jesus said I hold the key of David cause he holds the key through the opening of that book he himself my friends is the key and he opened up the book praise God hallelujah open up this great book of retention this seven sealed book for us all glory to God that we could go free because when he went into him had that great battle with Satan my god Satan was that was they they jail keeper he was the jailer and had them keys no doubt hanging on his waist and sitting there gloating over the prophets and Patriots who were gone before that he could hold them there temporarily because the blood that not mention by the way no one has to be held temporarily like that anymore because now the blood is shed there is no such an intermediary place anymore as Paul made it clear absent from the body present with the Lord instantly prison with the Lord this is the way it is now by the grace of God from the time that Jesus died first since the dispensation change we are not under law we are now under grace we are no more under the types and the shadows and the schoolmasters but we have come to a supernatural graduation by the anointing of the Holy Spirit that has delivered us to walk into this marvelous glorious light of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ aren't you happy that you can say I'm a Christian I am truly serving the Lord Oh glory to God hallelujah I'm happy today in the sunshine pray for all my sins have been taken away so the here comes this bloody bleeding lamb and just as Jesus took the book in Nazareth and reads out of the book and interprets Isaiah the prophet what being said and interpretation was the manifestation the manifestation was the interpretation for he took the book reading about himself that he was the fulfillment of that scripture he was the interpretation of that scripture and he says to them in public this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears he could have literally said but they might of course have item right then this day is this scripture fulfilled in your sight Oh glory be to God for he was the interpretation of the scripture he was the fulfillment of the Word of God standing right before them the unrecognized presence of the Living God and still they did not recognize who he was God being misunderstood by his own people his own creation not recognizing who he was thinking that he will come from star to star coming with a golden chariot coming with golden slippers coming with perfumed lace handkerchiefs coming my friends with beautiful lots upon him and and here he comes they dick neck just couldn't accept him for who he was and what he was and how he appeared to be a Bible sister he had nothing that was acceptable or admirable in their eyes it was a shock to them so they could not see God the Father living in the Sun they could not recognize his living interpretation this Living Bible this living fullness of the word of God and here he stood that blood lands and they're in hell with this great thing happening he goes up to Satan with those keys and all of the partying health stops the music stop all the crazy madness of health stop there was Oh silence my friends why because he grabbed the whole of those keys from Satan that he's a death hell and the grave and no one else has that power to open death hell are the grave but Jesus Christ anyone claiming to be able to do that in this day or any other day is Antichrist and gets the Word of God for it's only Jesus Christ Himself is able to do that and he has never given that power to any one else praise God so he took away those keys away from Satan and his demons of Hell and if we go into David speaking he says that in the Book of Psalms he reads about to open up you everlasting gates so that the King of glory may come in and there upon the battlements of heaven as they looked out they saw the Lord of glory cunning and behind him heaps cunning with the multitude I believe David looked at him and saw Jesus bringing up those Patriots and prophets with him after freeing them from Satan's prison house and as his taking men their captive and bringing them captive so he could send back glorious gifts unto man the voice cried out who is this Lord of glory Oh who is this Lord of glory and the Lord of glory answered back the law are mighty in battle the Lord mighty to save glory to God none other but Jesus Christ Himself the Lord that was mighty and is mighty to save praise God and let them back in the glory for their believes unto righteousness they were looking to the cross so they had to wait for the fulfillment of the manifestation of the word of God where the lamb will die the lamb would do battle the lamb would set them free the leg would raise them up so they can walk in the streets of Jerusalem and the land will lead them back to heaven and the presence of Almighty God and now we are here in our time and dispensation not waiting to be taken out of an intermediary state we are looking back my friends back to the cross it has already happened the price is already paid we are free because jesus said to the seat on the cross that very day he said to him today thou shalt be with me in paradise today not tomorrow not after somebody prays you out of there now I fear paid a huge sum of money not after you you give to charity but you today thou shall be with me in paradise because you ask for my mercy you asked for my pardon and you asked you spoke to me and recognize who I was the Word of God back then made flesh you are being called upon to recognize the Word of God for today who he is in the form of the Word of God like Jesus in your imagination back there walking on the streets yes that was but God has and more fed himself he has now come back into the farm of his word hello glory to God hallelujah so now brother sisters yes taking them back to glory took the book amen now you say well brother Simon what was in that book why was it so important that the lamb had to take the book why was it important that Jesus had to take the book there in the Gospel of Luke and then interpret the prophecy of Isaiah and by manifesting the prophecy of Isaiah first of all I want you to know that that was the Seventh Seal book that was close but now we find that the book is opened as it said in the Book of Luke he opened the book and then he began to read out of the prophet Isaiah amen but first he opened the book then he began to interpret the book praise God hallelujah even so we see in the book of Revelation he had to open those seven seals with seven blasts of thunders as the word of God was foodless of the word seven number perfection came for perfect understanding supernatural interpretation and divine communication by the presence and power of the Holy Spirit oh thanks being a God so here my friend sister this mysterious book was a book of the seven seals and all of those seven seals it was revealing to us the mystery coming of Christ no man knoweth the day or the hour oh praise God hallelujah amen but now we can recognize the coming of the Lord the presence of the Living God hallelujah the mystery coming of Jesus Christ I move on from that I will expand on that right now but I'll move on on from that praise God and the mystery coming of Christ is not a man it's not a human it's the Lord and self that has this sentiment a shout with the voice of an archangel on that shop of God Oh glory to God hallelujah amen this body also is the predestinated mystery will of God in the Bible says in mystery the predestinated mystery of his will some years ago this was made clear that it is God's predestinated mystery will like a man has a will and that will is kept secret locked away for in that will is the names of all of his beneficiaries and their inheritance of what they were want to receive when that will was read by a prophet by a lawyer by one who was designated for that particular job and here we see clearly in the Word of God hallelujah this book count the names of the held the names and the portions the positions that places the purpose of these beneficiaries of what they were to receive thanks be to God brother sister so this book held the names of gods elected in their gods elected children their names were in their the names that were in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world because as you know God is omnipotent omniscient is all-knowing the mark God doesn't have to wait until we make the decision to accept him to know who would accept him God already knew that from before the foundation of the world and please the names of those whom he already has for known to will receive him and place their names on the lamb spot of life there is no new name going to be written in glory for the names are already recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life so now we got from this to see that in his mystery coming he has come supernaturally to call out the names of this elect to call the Mount of Babylon called them already darkness call them out of any habits call them out of any dark depressing position situation any sinful chains of imprisonment of the body mind or spirit or soul that they are experiencing he has come to call his own and to know that beautiful wonderful song he knows my name I want you to know he knows your name that's how he called the chanyeol that's why he called Peter Andrew and many others in the Bible he knew their names he was trained to let them know that though he was now in a body who he really was that he knew their name from before the foundation of the world that's why he could say you are Nathanael or your name is Peter son of swords oh you are this person that's the reason why he was under that kind of anointing for the Spirit of God the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in him bodily he was in manual God with us but now he has returned to be God in us if we will let him come his habitation in I'll live within our hearts and lies so now we find not just back then but right now the seven seals have been revealed and God is calling up the names of his elect to come back to him and to know him enough power his resurrections and just as much as he called the disciples back there by their names and said come follow me they've never heard a person like this before they're never seen anything like this before but when they heard that boys when they're recognized what he was saying they followed him without a question or a shadow of doubt no bishop no priest no no high authority no great fever could stand against it because they were thirsting for the true Word of God the Fellowship of the Holy Spirit and the realities of failing reality of the Living God walking and moving around us and there he was standing alone look away the Jesus praise God so the Lord calling out the names of all the elect calling them out of the sin he is calling you out of your sin calling them to their inheritance to take possession was to possess their possessions he is calling them out by their names praise God calling them to take their position and purpose in the plan of God for all God's gifts find their appropriate places in the fullness of time praise God I want a little brother sister this calling is going on right now you say well well God is calling you out on my name not my natural names amen but your supernatural name by which he knew you before the foundation of the world the songwriter says yes he knew me yes he yet he loved me he knew you he loved you and now he's here by his word to come to hell the tension of his word and to recognize him who don't know his life he turned the Word of God so that called started amen and it started way back from the into this Gentile age as he began to call out his elect from the time he began to call his disciples and continue right through the book of Acts right through the church ages using the seven spirits of God the seven messengers the seven angels of the church which are one and the same oh praise God the angel messages of church which are men anointed man sent of each age that anyone could recognize that they are the messenger the angel to the church for the aged as Elijah was in Israel and even for Jezebel did not recognize him as her pastor yet he was because his life his ministry stood the test of time and was minded and vindicated by God and proved to the entire world who he was for his words came to pass every time Gordana and so it came right down through the center changes where God use each messenger to call out the elected for his particular age Luther called here's Wesley called years and so on right on down to the Pentecostal age which I believe and teach that brother William Brandon was that messenger to pet the Pentecostal churches to call out of the Pentecostal church age into the new church age of the capstone ministry of Christ himself call out the believers to the fullness of the word not bound by denominational boundaries not bound in their mind by denominational theories precepts and platitudes but they are they are free in Christ to recognize what the Word of God is saying to them not who do they say I am not who do they tell you that I am but when you look into the word who do you say I the Son of Man am who do you say I am what do you think of Christ The Anointed Word of God for the hour this is the question this is what is taking place right now praise God hallelujah so the names are being called but what I'm about to say friends when he is finished doing most of us is read another book the Bible said he closed the book I want to say to you my friends the book of intention is closing fast I believe we are right around the time when the last ones are now being called I want to say to you come home come home it's wedding supper time time to go home in the presence of God I don't mean time to die physically but diode yourself spiritually and come in the presence of God and feast upon the manna from on high feast upon the revelation of the word of God taste and see that the Lord is good blessed are they that put their trust in him the book is closing fast the names of the elected seed are being called out not Jim James Susan Sarah Hannah Jim Jack whatever your name is but what the spirit is revealing from the word white is calling your name and your spirit and the Spirit of God from this word oh praise God the deep calling to the deep and the deep responding and a fellowship and a communication supernatural communication by the power of the Holy Spirit taking place and God is calling his elect by his anointed word for the hour he meant the voice of God like it was back in the garden calling to his sons and his daughters Adam Adam we're at now where are you hiding what leaves of religion are you cover yourself with what leads up of silicon allottee and selfishness are you covering yourself with come out of the bushes come into the light come to the Word of God and so God's Holy Spirit is coming today just as it was back then the great Shepherd in this hour is calling his sheep that is calling them by their names back to the word back to the Bible back to the original three so since the structures form and then you think you have eternal life I know there is eternal life in there but the way you were searching you only seek you'll find it that way my friends let me tell you this you must know him for yourself you must recognize him by his own voice when he turned and he was raised up not when he just walked in Galilee oh but when he raised up and Mary looked for him looking for him in a dead tomb but only the year of wife's kneeling her saying Mary oh praise God hallelujah my god she thought it was the gardener at first but when she turned it is the Lord Oh praise God hallelu when Jesus comes and calls if you are of his seed the life of God in you no matter how much it was asleep wake up and recognize the Word of God for the day and bring you to the light of the hour oh praise God so the great Shepherd is now calling out to the Sheep we're able to shape whatever pastures the sheep were grazing in that Shepherd is now calling out his sheep and calling them back to him the book is about to be closed the last name is about to be called well praise God I want you to come look into this book again open your Bibles read from it even if it's five minutes a day listen to the Word of God like this listen to this message or any other message like that this again brother sister and see is my name written there on this page white and fair in the book of my kingdom it's my name written there may the Holy Spirit of God answer that question for you within your old heart there is little time left friends little time train left whatsoever little
