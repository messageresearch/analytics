========================================
amen and amen the Lord bless you real good please be seated of course in 1 Thessalonians uh chapter 3 the Bible says I would not have you ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep let you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if you believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him good on to say in verse 16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the Shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air Comfort one another with these words Lord bless your real good now Saints through all the ages through all ages have been waiting on this one thing you're coming of the Lord way back from the time of even Noah if we're already waiting on the coming of the Lord Brother random says in a few words that I always love I just love the sound of it he says there is no future but the coming of the Lord this Earth all the systems of the world even us as individuals we really don't have a future except a coming of the Lord amen many of the saints of God died in faith believing in the coming of the Lord their faith was so fervent so fresh that they believe it would be tomorrow and so they had to be they felt a sense of urgency so that they would be ready for today I don't know if you ever felt that feeling but when I got first received the message I wanted to be baptized right away because I did not want want to be caught with the Rapture coming and I'm not I'm not baptized you know in the grace of God and and you couldn't tell me any difference and some of the Saints back in the old country when they heard the word of God they were so zealous we baptized them in Midnight we baptized some in ditches you know they didn't care about whether the water was clean dirty or nothing they want to be baptized now what the Rapture could be tonight night right it was that urgent but you know uh and so they serve the Lord with a fervency because the this expectation that the Lord can come any moment amen but it seems like the church has lost that kind of fervency and that kind of expectation and uh are not getting ourselves really prepared and zealous at the coming of the Lord there becoming a laidback uh leian attitude upon the church well the Lord is coming it doesn't really matter I just go about my regular business and do whatever I have to do and and and no more you don't feel that kind of vibration going through the Saints where there really fired up and ferment because they recognize the coming of the Lord can be tonight and I I don't want to be caught brother Bram loves to sing that song what then what then when the Great book is open what then when the ones that's rejected this message tonight will be asked to give a reason what then he said when the bibles are laid in the Altar and the last sermons being preached what then amen praise God so we hear these things but there are Saints thousands of saints through thousands of Ages out waiting on one climax of our faith and that climax is the coming of the Lord amen amen amen praise God and I I don't know about you but I can't wait am I can't wait to finish my mission on Earth and get out of here praise God whatever God wants me to accomplish I want to accomplish it amen once that is over I'm I'm ready to leave I'm ready to go praise God hallelujah God there's a land beyond the river there's a better land praise God there's no heart takes there's no pains there's no trouble no rent to pay no worrying about mortgage worrying about uh irsp and all these things and woring about whe I have a house I don't have a house or have a car don't have a car just imagine to live in a world where your whole being is absolutely free from Toy free from free from sorrow free from all needs free wants free yesu it's hard for us to imagine being humans because we're born in a world that it is just full of trouble and the Bible says mind born and sin is full of trouble come to the world speaking lies that's all our days that we know as days of trouble and some of us the only peace you have is when you fall asleep if you fall asleep but the fact is that's where it is we don't have any real future but the coming of the Lord amen we're just working saving uh you know putting aside something to keep our lives uh uh without Satan being able to disrupt our lives too much you know to be a buffer against the things that he would bring against us to keep your body and soul United long enough to accomplish what God wants to accomplish and then he'll call us home amen come home it's supper time the evening Shadows Fall amen praise God well brother tells us already it's been evening time evening evening time has come it's here it's fast then letter we preach watch my water of the night midnight he said we are the CL time clock is tracking hour Jesus will soon descend clothed in garments of power the rain of sin to End Amen midnight then he comes and says after that if you watch how the the message and the pace of it he comes down to the end it is the rising of the Sun what the morning is breaking Jesus is coming and as the sun begins to rise up and the Revelation becomes clearer and clearer he says the light begins to push way the bloom and the Darkness and the fog not just the natural one in Genesis 1 that he was talking about but he says evil your soul praise God Amen if you had a foggy understanding and a revelation of this word once that s begins to come up that begins to burn away the all the fals delad all the your personal ideas that you had your different practic interpretations the sunlight comes up and the light shines and pushes the darkness out praise God hallelujah so I'm thankful for the C of the Lord because that's the hour of adoptions amen that's the hour when we the enterre bride not individual now but that your life is kept by the Holy Ghost by the entire bride kept off by the Holy Spirit he says now the the Rapture and Revival of the Bri will be a a I'm infilling of the Holy Ghost praise God when every favor of your being is filled with the Holy Ghost when every member of the body of Christ is filled with the Holy Ghost the whole thing is kept off and she's ready to leave and get out of here for the glory of God Qui in California TRS All Around Jesus Hallelujah Jesus Christ thank you make itself manifested In the Flesh in the form of a prophet in the last day amen you don't believe that a prophet is not just a foreteller he's a fork teller he's a sear or a sear of the word a sear of things to come but he is also a predestinated body that God plac in a certain age that he's going to express his word true to be the voice of God to these last days and that's what brother Bram was I'm sure if you don't know it right now on the Internet is circulating the vision of Brother David M somebody I know uh or knew from many years ago and uh how that um this not Vision but how a rabbi had a vision a Jewish rabbi had a vision and um and in the vision he was told called David must gr and he went and began to look up the name on the Internet never having known him look it up and when he looked it up um he finally came across the name of David mro and so he called him up and you know and you going here tonight you see when he says that well I'm calling you I don't know you and you don't know me but uh you know I was told I had this vision and in the vision The Voice told me to call David mro you know he says and there it is I'm calling you now because from the vision and from what um what was shown to me is that there was a prophet here in North America his name was William brand and that he was a prophet to you Gentiles and the rabbi starts telling him telling him a part of the message uh not having anything to do with the message uh right now of course they relate that to voice of God and to brother Billy Paul and whatever but just to let you know the coming of the Lord is near but when he starts to alert the Jews to recognize that one Elijah is passed and another one is on the way but the next one is coming to them amen hallelujah praise God so Brothers we got to make ourselves ready amen praise God hallelujah praise the name of the Lord Jesus praise God I bless the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I thank him that I can I look for the day when I can say how I got over my soul look back and wonder how I got over how we got out amen

Christian right I can understand the all song written by i s Christian walk carefully Christian walk carefully Christian walk carefully danger is near amen Danger is near on every hand and as we near the coming of the lord we have to be so much more careful praise God hallelujah amen now brother brother B speaking he says here Malachi 4 when that Elijah comes immediately after that his message and things after that is the coming of the Lord amen praise God and he's gone to be with the Lord his message is still here doing the finishing up now because message is in the bride right and she not him now but she has now become the voice of God to these last days we the ones that the voice has come to we the ones that John looked and S said a voice of many Waters and another voice said the waters are the people amen praise God because it's us glory to God speaking the word of God for these last days upon the people amen hallelujah amen he says now what the coming of the Lord Jesus those who believe are rally themselves loving his coming and living for the coming of the Lord are you living for his coming amen praise God hallelujah and when he appears the church shall rise being changed in a moment the rest of them will know nothing about it remember a to those in the city the Rapture will be like that we'll see each other we'll be caught away as a secret going and we are here now

hallelujah you know like I just said somebody can say oh he's coming he's coming he's coming he's coming after a while you get kind of Sedated by he's coming and you start to just relax about it but then all of a sudden you get a secret message telling you the rest of them don't know but he's really coming amen praise the Lord amen see they're hearing the same thing you're hearing the Lord is

make your life heav on Earth amen that's what he knows it and he got nothing to lose you know when a man knows that he's he going to be executed and condem for killing one or two or 10 people what's the difference for him to kill a thousand more you see so that's the devil like a roaring lion going around seeking whom he may devour praise God hallelujah and so he's raking he's clawing his he's tormenting minds and tormenting bodies and bringing all kind of problems here and there but we have answer the promise of the world we got we got Assurance we got the foundation St found of the world

not just talking about you going than loving somebody because the love of God is deep as your love for God amen amen you can't have the love of God unless you have love for God the love of God in you grows out of your love for God so when you love the word hallelujah until the word Can Make You Weep one moment the word can make you cry the word can make you laugh your Joy is in the word your peace is in the word your your your comedy is in the word everything you want is right in the word unspeakable joy right in that word praise God hallelujah amen the word can wake you up in the middle of the night the word can put you to sleep the word can make you run Hallelujah the word can just lift you up praise in every possible way amen hallelujah yes sir so here we are we see it when them seals announced they were all one Great Divine Supernatural call going out to a certain group of people that will be found in the seventh seal book book page 2425 praise God hallelujah so the seals and the going forth of the breaking of the seals was what it was a call going out to a certain group of people amen hallelujah the great Shepherd now calling the Sheep amen changing their aoms of their bodies even though they have not yet fallen asleep why because one group has to die amen and they that dead will be in Christ will be raised up for us we which are alive and remain we shall be what changed

that salvation praise God without fear we're working it on the outside glory to God hallelujah amen yes sir now friends go here we are Lord today as your servants we look forward and we even see your coming do you see the coming of the Lord amen when look what do you see you see they only realize that the shelter ready took place we take these things for granted amen but you don't understand out there that scripture they they repeat it they read it but they don't know what it means really they think they know but they don't know what it means they don't understand that the the Lord shall Des Sent From Heaven with they shout Amen brother said that's a message amen amen with the voice of the Archangel amen that shout goes into the bride and becomes a voice amen praise God hallelujah glory to God and then what happens She Blows the trumpet the trumpet call goes out because now it's one group of people all together carrying that message everywhere around the world and the thing is right now you understand what I'm telling you the Rapture is now in progress amen the Holy Spirit by Revelation changed the Dynamics and says no it's not an event on one certain day like they preached for hundreds of years that all of a sudden you hear a trumpet blow and the great bosted and we all rising up like that now it's funny to us but they we I actually believed it when I was in Pentecostal and gospel R that's how I believe it because we don't know anything different but it took a prophet to come along and says no it's not just an event on a certain day there's a process that goes to that event that's right amen and if you're not caught up in the spirit Hallelujah yes Lord amen praise God Amen if you're not caught up in that process uh there how you going to even be in the event you will be in the event that's why we repeat you must recognize the word in its word form now so that when the word comes back and the word becomes flesh again glorified in more amen but it comes back how you going to recognize it there right because the word is the word being glorified to you amen and if you can't see that when he comes again how you going to recognize him right amen you got to recognize him now oh my you better pray now or you going to pray later whether you like it or not amen praise God hallelujah oh yes Hallelujah we are in the process we are in the bride coming of the Lord right now amen the son of man is to be revealed what and again MH hallelujah amen and right now again it's the head Christ Jesus that was revealed or made himself known back in the gospels and in the Bible that was the head right you had Adam and you had Eve right and Adam was the head of Eve but once he's the head died went to heaven came back poured out the spirit what happened now he's building his own body that's why he told Solomon he says are you going to build me a house the heaven of Heavens can't contain me but mystery of mysteries to think that the god that fills the entire universe could live in you and me amen wow that is amazing and so God is building his own house how wonderful to know that he's building his own house in this hour and we are a part of that process am when the last one comes in and the last nail is clinched the whole thing goes out amen it'll be too late then oh my praise God I repeat what a words of my mother I always remember her singing or or saying some of these things she says and too late too late shall be the cry Jesus of Nazareth has passed you by wow think about it brothers and sisters the people there's thousands out there sincere people track in these prisons with st glass windows calling out Angel waiting on the coming of the Lord just like you believing the same scriptures that you are believeing and they'll pray they cry and they'll weep over the same scriptures right with no understanding amen and no Revelation and the whole thing is passing them right by and they hardly recognize it and here we are sitting in the Lifeboat we're floating down the stream of time we have not long to stay it's wonderful isn't it am Noah inside of the Ark the ark floating and the rest of them don't realize the rising tide of sin and evil is all is coming up at first they're not worried too much because you know the water they can walk around they can wave but when it starts to get really deep now and they realize their fall it's too late then the water is too much the sin the insanity the evil the devilry is gone so far that they can't stand it they can't take it anymore it shall come to pass said the prophet of Malachi 4 that the entire world will go insane except for those members that are in the bright why because you come back from being in sin or being born inane actually and now you have received your right mind like the man that was in the tombs you remember Jesus cast out all them Legions of demons that were in him Legions of all kind of beliefs unbelief all kind of mix up Devils got in your life and everything else cast everyone about and then the Bible says and when he left him he was in his right mind and clothed praise the Lord and when salvation came to you for free he put on the robe of righteousness on you and brought you back to your right mind says for now PA says we have the mind of Christ why praise God the mind has been and is us who are still there our minds have been renewed by the renewing of the Mind renewing your word and bring you back out of your spiritual J to recognize where you come from and who you are somebody suffering from alers suffering from you know Amnesia like that they're looking right at their relatives and don't know them they pass their own home and they don't know it right they pass their own school and they don't know it and don't recognizing it amen praise the Lord but for us God slowly brought brought us back to a right mind by by showing you a little scripture and then you realize oh that's a familiar place I I I something in me tells me I know this place praise God hallelujah you see you might not have it clear at first then all of a sudden bang it opens up you oh that's my own Schoolhouse and grou where I used to go with Tom and Jim and we used to play in the Schoo yard amen hallelujah he pass another familiar scripture in front of you amen hallelujah I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also and that touches that first of all it touches your heart and it don't touch your mind and it touch your heart then all of a sudden it breaks amen you realize you're in another familiar Place start to come back to your right mind another child from this Earth I come from glory and I'm going back to Glory I'm not a creature of F I come from eternity I'm going back to Eternity I come from God and I'm going back to Jesus Hallelujah oh when I come to the last mile of the way oh I'll shout at the end of the close of the day oh praise God what Joy awaits us brothers and sisters what Joy awaits us when we come to the end of the road yes Lord oh praise God forever more I'll go with him all the way amen I'm not one that's going to drop out that's right I'm not dropping out this race I'm started off with Jesus I'm I'm going through going to [Applause] stopes no problem noain nothing is going to stop me I too late now glory to God hallelujah amen praise God forever more I'm so happy that we here praise God hallelujah listen to the prophet he said when he starts descending the Lord's descend has started he said that his descending starts with a shout what is it it's the message trying to get the people together that message comes first Hallelujah that shout is the message praise God and when them seals were announced what was it it was a Divine call calling out a group a special group of people Amen to do what get ready the Lord is coming time clock is striking the hour Jesus will soon descend clad in the garments of power the rain of sin to end he's coming amen amen he's on his way he's a parent already among us as a parent preceding this coming praise the Lord that is why brother Bale and many of these saints were trying they felt it they they they felt it in their Spirit they caught something when they started talking about perusia it really was the appearing of the Lord supernaturally spiritually among the people amen praise God that was just a a precursor that was not the full coming of the Lord that was part of the coming of the Lord are you understand me praise the name of the Lord that was part of the of the Lord hallelujah there's no denying about it and that's the reason why um a lot of these brothers they say oh this about brother oh thatan preaching seven Tong that one preach about the peria brother Jones down in the South there preaching about two souls and and they come down against these brothers I said the Holy Spirit made me clear he says no what this is it first of all to Jones what the Lord was revealing is that you must be born again in the message at that time when he started preaching that stuff people were believing they come out to Pentecost come to these gospel churches and they come in the message and they're already saved right but then he took it one step too far right when he took it that step too far then he went off but really that was his message and God uses men like that he used men to bring bring the groups this far then he raises up the next one and that one comes up and he brings Revelation seven Thunders amen the voice of God hallelujah coming out of those seals nobody knew anything like that when that man started preaching that and let me tell you I was there because he was the one that really s for me to come out to South America many he saw heard what the Lord was doing been a young young man down there just 20 something years old 23 at the time praise God hallelujah amen so he just said for me p on see never knew me never knew him ended up up there and I heard that man preach on God's bride the wheat of God hallelujah oh praise God you know what his he had about 120 people in the Empire State Building up there with folding chairs and you know the rest of it he became a major minister with the message around the world woke up all the ministers because what happened the next morning wheat was all over the streets in Manhattan they don't know where it come from they're all shocked they don't know what's going on after that preaching the message the Lord was just keeping the word amen I remember another time you were in right there in Montreal it preaching the word of God hallelujah and while he's preaching there he's talking about the seven Thunders room there bam crap lightning praise God hallelujah amen why you think they talk about him so much amen you for him or you against him glory to God hallelujah but towards the end he started getting to the point where people thinking he's the next messenger after brother BR and then he starts your time is up you start going into all kinds of stuff it's got nothing to do with the man and what he accomplished bringing in tens of thousands of people into the message amen praise the Lord hallelujah like that and then comes brother Vale brother Vale who was there brother Vale started talking about perusia he started talking about the Lord this Supernatural presence of the Lord amen coming in the midst of the bride and getting her ready the coming of the Lord the perah amen hallelujah glory to God Amen but what he was talking about is trying to the saints that he's appearing now he's among us now praise the Lord he wasn't rather telling us the entire C of the Lord and that's the Rapture don't bother looking for no rapture because I heard some of them go off like that and said don't bother looking for No Angels coming up to dig you out of your grave with shovel and all these things you know make him talk like that you know they twist and take the things and go a little too far and then God has to get the man out of the way so that the thing can become clear amen praise God they go so far and then they have to get out of the way praise God it's always a Changing of the Guard at B Bo amen it's always a Changing of the Guard amen hallelujah some are there at 6:00 and they're going to spend so many hours and then another said come it's not that they didn't do their job they did their job but this another set has to come fresh again praise God another set comes again fresh amen hallelujah and we all are here just to serve God's purpose that's what we here for praise the Lord hallelujah glory to God I want you to know friends that it's a wonderful time that we are living in and we are to be living under great expectation Hallelujah you hear David said I lay down to sleep he said I lay down to sleep then he goes on to say I I wake up in glory amen praise God in other words when you lay on your bed tomorrow morning when you're in the middle of sleep awake you're opening your eyes are you going to open your eyes in your own bedroom do you can you guarantee me you're going to open your eyes in your own bedroom or when you open your eyes you wake up in glory you don't know amen so every night every day we make ourselves right with the Lord and we he says we lay down as the one Prophet said we laid down and we sleep amen and the sleep of God's uh elected sweet amen praise God hallelujah because you lay down here it doesn't matter dead life whatever what are they going to do with you li eat your body of what I'm going in the presence of the Lord from this body I'm present with the Lord am glory to his precious name hallelujah amen listen wow now listen to the coming of the Lord now listen listen I just spoke about brother veil of peria listen to him that's right the Holy Spirit himself is here what is it it's Christ himself in spirit form his Spirit his anointing is here amen what is it the book is already open praise God and the Seven seal to be identified as the coming of Christ coming of the Lord glory to God hallelujah you see the two things I'm talking you have TI right praise God forever more oh my and for that he is coming this is in the harest time then there must be a true seed there's got to be because he's coming for the bride without SP he's coming for her hallelujah oh my and she has to be here is that right if he's coming there there's no bride then why is he coming but he's coming because he knows there's a bride Hallelujah and I believe I'm one of them I'm one of them I am I can say I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them you got to have that certainty that if nobody else is one of them I know that I one of them I am I have become certain of God hallelujah certain of God confident amen hallelujah listen you realize that I realize I can be look I've been a preacher for years but I couldn't talk this way like how I'm talking now without him hear the whole thing when I look at this book and I look at this message that I've been reading all these years all of a sudden all this stuff is lit up in front of me it's it's just pouring out like a fountain because it's right there and sometimes makes me say things that I never seen heard anybody say or no or whatever and sometimes I'll speak something and then go never hearing brother BR say go back and find it somewhere in the message amen and then you know what that does it makes makes me more confident that the same spirit that anointed that man is anointing me not just me but I know it will be ministers but I'm saying I know I got a portion of it I'm not guessing I know I got a portion just like when God was ready for Moses he said now let that Spirit go s when Jesus is leaving now the spirit comes back and now it's available to all of us amen if you don't have your portion you going to make sure you got your portion and let it do with you what it needs to do amen we need to be all filled with the Holy Ghost CH out Hallelujah glory to God have ever been so happy you don't know to laugh or cry amen oh my Hallelujah yeah have you ever been so happy I've seen people so happy they try to laugh no song No No Song is coming out of them brother brother D and at last one the song on this one blast because were're holding it in there for a while am look we in a great time this is the coming of the Lord in the middle of it praise God forever more I look I can almost taste and see that the Lord is good amen praise God like brother brother P's father told told his mother uh you know he says he says sweetheart he says whatever you're cooking there it's so nice he said I feel like I could just take a piece of bread and just stop the breeze I don't need to put it in the grave I can just sof the breeze it's so tasty glory to God but the coming of the Lord is like that it's so close and and you feel the vibrations of his coming that you can almost chaste and see amen the Lord is good amen praise God hallelujah oh I preached a message several years ago I go amen that about enjoying the powers of the world to come the world to come is now projecting itself in this Dimension Hallelujah and we being caught up in it and we are starting to taste some of the power of the world to come what a what a Time brothers and sisters that we living in for this day and time praise God hallelujah amen this now he says the Harvest Time the secret coming of the Lord Jesus she'll be taken away and the rest of them will go right on preaching like they always done as it was in the days of Noah and the flood come tribulation is talking about amen comes upon them you know Enoch is a typ of the Bride being called up before Noah is a type of the tribulation saint amen that will go through the flood amen amen always remember that that's the type for it sometimes but you know all types as compound meanings sometimes we refer to that also like it was a part of us being saved uh by the blood and going across the the sea and stuff like that amen but truly that is it amen Christ as he said here is already here in the spirit form in the opening of the seventh seal which has been identified as the coming of the Lord amen that is why it was a secret and the half our silence because no man knew nobody knew the devil didn't know it was shock into the devil he he didn't even know so it shocked him because God had to keep it a secret amen oh my there's only one Phoenix left and that is the coming of the Lord Jesus amen praise God you know of course a female don't want to explain that but that's an Egyptian mythology of a supernatural bird that no matter how much you try to kill it you you bury it it rise again you try to burn it and go into ashes it still rise again you can't get rid of it no matter what you do it's a phoenix amen praise God so that's why he's referring to Jesus Like a Phoenix Christianity is like a phoenix no matter if they try to boil the Saints kill the Saints burn the Saints no matter what they do is still here can't get rid of us can't get rid of it we are here waiting come Lord amen praise the Lord Jesus hallelujah amen so then we want to be ready when the com of the Lord is Right drawing out we want to be ready for that great hour and he'll come one of these days and we are going with him wow praise God now I did prophesy some visions that will have to all they come to pass and I will maintain this prediction I still maintain this prediction after 30 years amen because Jesus did not say a man would know the year month or week in which his coming was to be and I want you to hear this last part his coming was to be complet am is that right that's we talking about a process stages but he says no man is going to know when the process or the coming of the Lord is to be completed when you know it is when you red out here amen that's right is that right but no man knows that exact day amen hallelujah you know how many people thought they knew the day to come the Lord you know how many times Jo Witnesses predicted that under Clark uh judge
