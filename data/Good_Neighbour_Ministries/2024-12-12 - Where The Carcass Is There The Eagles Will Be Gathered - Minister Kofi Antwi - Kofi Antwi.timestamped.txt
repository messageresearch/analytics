[24:35] know for wheresoever the carcus is there
[24:39] will the Eagles be
[24:41] GA
[24:43] together that's the first
[24:46] scripture and we turn to
[24:52] Revelation I said Revelation 22:16
[24:58] you read to
[25:01] the sorry revelation 22 sorry revelation
[25:06] 22 verse 16 that's what I
[25:10] said we read to the end I Jesus have
[25:14] send my
[25:16] angel to testify unto you these things
[25:21] in the
[25:23] churches I am the root and the of
[25:28] offspring of David and the bright and
[25:33] morning
[25:34] star and the spirit and the bride say
[25:39] come and let him that he say come and
[25:45] let him that is test come and whosoever
[25:51] will let him take the Water of Life
[25:55] freely for I testify unto every man that
[26:01] Hearth the words of
[26:04] the prophecy of this book If any man
[26:09] shall add unto
[26:12] this things God shall add unto him the
[26:17] plagues that are written in this book
[26:22] and if any man shall take away from the
[26:27] words of of This Book of this prophecy
[26:32] God shall take away his part out of the
[26:37] book of life and out of the holy city
[26:43] and from the things which are written in
[26:49] this book he which testify these things
[26:54] says
[26:56] surely I come
[26:58] quickly amen even so come Lord Jesus the
[27:05] grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with
[27:10] you all
[27:13] amen may the Lord add his Blessing to
[27:16] what we have
[27:19] read please sit
[27:26] down even why we read this
[27:30] scripture what is the scripture saying
[27:32] to us straight I see
[27:36] God is the one that interpret his own
[27:41] word he's telling us
[27:44] that if you add it to his word your name
[27:48] will be taken
[27:50] out
[27:51] right and he also said where the Kaka is
[27:55] there the eagle will be gathered
[27:57] together
[27:59] because what is the carcass the carass
[28:02] is the flesh word of
[28:05] God and only him can give us the
[28:09] carcass no man can give it to you when I
[28:14] said no man I'm not saying a man can
[28:17] preach the word of God if he is ordained
[28:20] by God to preach then God will give him
[28:23] the flesh ccass then when he speak it
[28:27] won't be be a man speaking because it
[28:31] will be God taking the man heart as he
[28:36] has ordained
[28:37] him and speaking through him because
[28:41] otherwise man will speak his own mind
[28:45] and the days of man are
[28:48] over even the day of man trying to
[28:54] interpret God word with his own IDE
[28:58] are
[29:00] over but when God is hiding in a man and
[29:06] the man is speaking the man doesn't have
[29:09] his own ideas the ideas come from where
[29:13] God because God is his own
[29:18] interpreter when brother Abraham came we
[29:21] all saw it because God was in The
[29:26] Man by name
[29:29] 1963 the seals were
[29:31] open God has come down to be his own
[29:35] interpreter taking the prophet and
[29:39] speaking through the prophet after he
[29:42] done with him he says I must decrease he
[29:45] must increase right so God took over
[29:51] then the five4 ministry we have come to
[29:55] H to take over the word word the true
[29:59] 5-4 Ministry not everybody preaching is
[30:02] a five4 Ministry but those that God has
[30:05] ordained before the foundations of this
[30:08] world God will hide in them because it's
[30:13] not by education you can preach the word
[30:16] of God we all know it the denomination
[30:19] has done that and has failed man has
[30:22] tried with his own ability his own ideas
[30:27] all have has fail why because God is his
[30:30] own interpreter and even the 54 Ministry
[30:35] as a man God will say that it will come
[30:39] to a time we must decrease I was
[30:43] fellowshipping with brother uh brother
[30:46] Mike my own precious brother and he
[30:48] brought that and right away I says to
[30:50] him brother you are right because you
[30:53] know why because God says
[30:59] is H God says he's his own
[31:04] interpreter is not man that will
[31:07] interpret the
[31:09] word is he himself so the 54
[31:13] Ministry we are coming to a time that we
[31:17] going to be
[31:18] decreased you may not like it but it's
[31:21] the truth we're going to be decreased
[31:24] but because if we don't decrease then
[31:29] it will be
[31:30] man but I am take it rightly I'm not
[31:34] saying man won't preach the gospel man
[31:37] will be preaching but the holy
[31:41] spirit is the one that interpret the
[31:44] word that's what I'm trying to
[31:47] say you understand M dayses of taking
[31:51] the word and studying and and putting
[31:54] things together here there there there a
[31:57] cracking their
[31:58] brains is over because God is his own
[32:04] interpreter God will take
[32:08] over the seed that he has ordained and
[32:13] when the man stand
[32:15] here God will come and speak the way he
[32:19] wanted to speak the man may not know
[32:22] what even he have to preach but as soon
[32:26] as he's standing in the pulpit
[32:28] the holy spirit will pick him up and say
[32:33] things that he wanted to say then the
[32:36] people will
[32:38] know their heart will bur within them
[32:41] that this is not a man speaking this is
[32:44] God speaking because when the prophet
[32:48] was
[32:49] here we all
[32:51] saw things that were manifested in him
[32:55] it was not William Braham that was doing
[32:58] the miracle it was not William Braham
[33:01] that opened the
[33:03] seals then it will be a
[33:05] man right it will be a man then the
[33:08] glory will go to who
[33:11] man but God has come down for a reason
[33:16] that he wanted to break his own way to
[33:19] his people that the people will know is
[33:22] not a man it's he
[33:26] himself the goes to God let me tell you
[33:31] I believe that I don't even when brother
[33:35] brother might speak I said brother let
[33:38] me tell you I
[33:42] know I says as soon as I don't I says
[33:47] when I was in school I was not good but
[33:51] when it comes to the word of God as soon
[33:53] as you speak something in me wake up and
[33:56] he catches it I don't know how I catches
[33:59] it but I know it's the
[34:01] truth nobody have to explain to me or
[34:04] nobody have to H I mean kick
[34:07] me you know the eagle eat the
[34:11] ccass because I am part of that carcass
[34:15] that have to made manifest for this day
[34:19] you are part of that carcass that have
[34:21] to made manifest what is the ccass the
[34:24] ccass is the flesh word of God and it's
[34:27] you that have to made manifest because
[34:30] you are part of
[34:36] God oh God you are so good I told him
[34:41] myself said brother you was God is so
[34:43] good he has opened our eyes to ex
[34:46] understand even we who are nothing the
[34:52] least in the kingdom of God now I
[34:55] understand the Bible says the least in
[34:57] the kingdom of God is greater than John
[35:00] the
[35:01] Baptist why
[35:03] because it is the Mondays are
[35:09] over people may not accept it but it's
[35:12] the truth M days of preaching the word
[35:16] of God with their own ideas their own
[35:22] ability is
[35:25] over but God has come down hiding in the
[35:30] wife his own seed bringing the word and
[35:35] you have to catch it like our old Pastor
[35:38] used to say Pastor John Simon he says
[35:42] when the
[35:44] word Abel was born and Cain was born
[35:48] where was the written way how did Abel
[35:51] know how to offer the lamb there was no
[35:55] book for him to co 30 or something
[35:57] something to write he offer it by what
[36:03] Revelation it was what the
[36:05] beginning we are what at the end so
[36:09] shall it be so all man knowledge have to
[36:14] come to an end so that they as able
[36:20] offer a better sacrifice unto God and
[36:23] God accepted it the wife of Christ at
[36:26] this hour we are going to offer what
[36:30] sacrifice unto the Lord not by you using
[36:35] the letter to the letter yes the letter
[36:37] is good that's why the Bible says what
[36:40] the letter kill it but the spirit gave
[36:44] life so the spirit will lead you to say
[36:49] things that if they don't have the seed
[36:52] of God they will never know what you are
[36:55] talking about it will be like to them is
[36:58] you are
[36:59] insane because you know what it's
[37:02] written but it's not written for your
[37:05] natural eye to see to go read
[37:09] it you understand it's not written for
[37:12] your natural eye to go read it and and
[37:15] speak it but you led by the spirit and
[37:20] when you speak it those that have the
[37:23] seed of God will will know this is God
[37:27] this is my father because when Jesus was
[37:31] here that's what you know the Pharisees
[37:35] were trying to use the same Bible to tid
[37:39] him
[37:41] up they're using the letter to tie Jesus
[37:44] up but forgetting that he was the word
[37:48] the things he was speaking Moses has
[37:51] spoke and said the Lord your God will
[37:54] raise a prophet like unto me whom
[37:58] soever will not hear him when he come
[38:01] will be cut off and here he
[38:05] was revealing the word but because it's
[38:09] not written physically the Pharisees
[38:12] couldn't cease it he says destroy this
[38:15] temple in three days I will raise it up
[38:18] he was speaking what exactly like us
[38:21] able offer a better sacrifice than King
[38:26] and those that were
[38:28] elect saw it and follow him but those
[38:33] that were not elect couldn't cease it
[38:38] brothers and
[38:39] sisters we know a prophet has come on
[38:43] the scene this 20th century he the Seas
[38:46] has open but our God is what marching on
[38:50] the holy spirit is what marching on
[38:54] because what when God move the devil
[38:56] move when God moved the devil move he
[39:00] tried to catch everything that God is
[39:03] making or God is speaking to his
[39:06] children so God what he has done
[39:10] is he has taken man
[39:15] away and he himself is here he's here
[39:20] and giving the
[39:22] word by
[39:24] what he spoken word is what the oral
[39:27] what seed so he's bringing his own
[39:31] spoken word and his own elect will catch
[39:35] it we will catch it by what by
[39:39] Faith by
[39:41] Revelation because it's flesh
[39:44] Cass is the flesh word of God because
[39:49] Eagles doesn't eat no dead meat when you
[39:52] kill it
[39:53] today and leave it for tomorrow eagle
[39:57] eat it he want the flesh ccass that
[40:02] blood is in then he will eat it that
[40:05] make the eagle strong and I want to tell
[40:09] you the true bride of all every day they
[40:14] want flesh ccass week by week not just C
[40:20] you're going to stick with the quot and
[40:22] quot and quot and quot and after the C
[40:27] quot sorry after the quote then what
[40:32] quote of the prophets are good to back
[40:35] your
[40:36] word but if there is no life coming out
[40:40] I tell you get away from
[40:43] that you need the life the flesh ccass
[40:47] coming out from the
[40:50] world
[40:52] because if you are
[40:55] sick you don't need to th000 years what
[40:59] Jesus
[41:01] heal and Jesus can't heal you
[41:04] today then what is he good to
[41:08] you you you see what I'm saying what is
[41:11] he good to you you need Jesus Christ
[41:14] that will heal you
[41:17] today Jesus Christ that's why the
[41:20] scripture says Jesus Christ is what the
[41:22] same yesterday today and forever
[41:27] so if he does it today then you know
[41:30] your God is alive with
[41:32] you then you take him as
[41:35] real then that will make you it give you
[41:38] what faith
[41:40] confidence
[41:42] Assurance
[41:43] truthfulness then you are willing to
[41:46] even if there is dead you don't care you
[41:48] are willing to die for it
[41:53] otherwise you are just serving God on
[41:55] the wall because you are not
[41:59] sure am I telling the truth or
[42:02] not am I telling you the truth or I'm
[42:05] lying to
[42:08] you because let me tell you the god that
[42:14] the word that we receive here look at me
[42:18] you all know me some of you sister
[42:21] Vanessa brother Brian sister
[42:24] Rosemary uh Philip
[42:29] sister brother Mike wife they know
[42:34] me sister El know me okay and look at me
[42:41] even bringing the word like this I went
[42:44] to Ghana by bringing the word and I can
[42:49] tell
[42:50] you the spirit of God I preach the
[42:54] message I brought here on Genesis
[42:56] chapter 7
[42:59] I spoke
[43:00] here for indeed have I seen
[43:03] righteousness before me the same thing I
[43:06] testify what the Lord did with
[43:09] me and I preach it for about 1 hour I'm
[43:14] ready to stop the pastor was sitting
[43:17] jumping on the back get up I was I
[43:21] wanted to give him the mic he said no
[43:25] you haven't finished continue
[43:28] as soon as he give me back the mic God
[43:31] is my witness I was say what am I going
[43:33] to say as soon as I hold them out the
[43:36] Lord put into my heart call the people
[43:39] those that have the problem they should
[43:41] come up front I don't want to
[43:44] know believe me to my surprise people
[43:48] were crying even young young boys young
[43:54] some of them young girls
[43:57] and I said
[43:59] Lord
[44:01] wow I'm so shocked I'm so surprised like
[44:07] what did I say that here is the people
[44:10] coming to hear your voice but it's not
[44:14] me it's
[44:16] God God coming out even the
[44:22] testony that how God has dealt with me
[44:26] how I I was sick my pastor came and
[44:30] prayed for me with his wife and I saw
[44:33] God sitting in the chair and I came back
[44:37] to
[44:38] life raising me up and here I'm standing
[44:41] in front of them preaching the gospel I
[44:44] cannot do it God is the one and I was
[44:47] typing to them what do you think this is
[44:51] the sign of Abraham God showing Abraham
[44:55] a last sign
[44:57] before Sarah and Isa came God visit
[45:01] Abraham and design Sarah I said that
[45:05] thing I have seen it I am not talking by
[45:09] God on the wall or God just on hidden on
[45:12] the book I have seen it in
[45:15] reality God Is Ring My Soul now I don't
[45:20] care what whoever spoke I know my God is
[45:25] real I'm talking because I am eyewitness
[45:29] of that you have to be an eyewitness of
[45:33] that
[45:35] otherwise I told them I said listen me I
[45:39] believe what all the prophet preach I
[45:42] may not able to preach it like my
[45:45] brothers or some of the brothers preach
[45:47] God bless them God use them my heart I
[45:53] pray for them but one thing I could know
[45:58] God is real to
[45:59] me God is so real to me that I don't
[46:05] take him for granted because his word is
[46:09] in my heart his word he has revealed to
[46:13] me and says Kofi you are my son you are
[46:16] one of my wife you are one whom I love I
[46:22] came to Calvary to die for you I came to
[46:25] Calvary to for so that you could know
[46:29] that yes I'm alive forever more and I'm
[46:33] in you the people so many of even
[46:39] believers they go to church but this
[46:42] thing is hidden from them I'm just
[46:45] speaking my heart it's hidden from so
[46:48] many we shouldn't take God for granted
[46:52] not so many have seen Jesus Christ is
[46:55] the truth we are just so many are in the
[46:59] message but they never seen Christ
[47:02] Christ has never visit them only few
[47:06] individuals because salvation is an
[47:09] individual and not everybody preaching
[47:12] is 54 Ministry but few that are hidden
[47:17] inside that God is visiting so if God
[47:21] has visited you and let you know you are
[47:24] one of the of the few you have to
[47:26] rejoice
[47:27] you have to give him praise you have to
[47:30] give him thanks let me tell you the
[47:33] prophet William Braham when God visits
[47:36] him he says the Bible has become a new
[47:38] Bible to me why because he know now he's
[47:44] in his office not just in his office he
[47:47] know he God's son to be a God Son the
[47:52] world is over 7 billion how many people
[47:56] are are God's children take this message
[47:59] to people they tell you you are cucko as
[48:02] our pastor was saying like you are
[48:05] insane but you know and I know God is
[48:10] real God is in our soul the Cass we eat
[48:15] here is building us every day drawing us
[48:19] closer every day you getting closer to
[48:22] what God every day you getting closer to
[48:26] what to to see
[48:29] your oh my to meet your maker every day
[48:34] is getting you closer one of these days
[48:37] this word that you eat here will take
[48:39] you to bust you in the air to meet the
[48:42] Lord the Bible says we will meet the
[48:44] Lord what in the air you'll be cut
[48:48] off and yet a lot of
[48:51] people wherever the gospel is preached
[48:54] like
[48:55] this people want to stay
[48:58] home
[49:00] people I says let let me tell you if God
[49:04] is in your heart no matter what happened
[49:06] to you there's no
[49:09] sadness no
[49:12] sadness yes I'm not saying you not be
[49:14] quiet but you you as soon as somebody
[49:18] talk about Christ your heart just lift
[49:22] up because you know
[49:24] why God has done something great thing
[49:28] for
[49:28] you God has done something great thing
[49:32] for
[49:33] you 33 years when God has revealed
[49:37] himself to
[49:38] me and I'm not tired yet I am not tired
[49:43] yet let me tell you I thank him every
[49:47] day of my life this is greater than
[49:51] anything in the world greater than the
[49:54] whole world money even let's say I was
[49:57] rich like H this Tesla Guy what's his
[50:00] name I I don't I forgot the
[50:03] name El

[50:08] right but can he have this Joy can he
[50:11] have what I
[50:13] have let me tell you I'll rather take
[50:16] this and give up all his money because

[50:24] everything even if God just G give you
[50:27] air to breed and you struggling for food

[51:44] to church you need to go to
[51:46] Christ if you are a Believer watching
[51:50] me and your
[51:53] heart is H backsliding

[52:03] people they go to

[52:54] difficult that time I had Paul living in
[52:58] shelter tough life and when I go I have
[53:02] to eat orange and sleep because the food
[53:07] that I'll get there is
[53:08] gone and I'll still coming to church
[53:12] take train and come into church when God
[53:15] know you are serious like that a time
[53:19] will come you will do something for you
[53:22] he open the windows of heaven and pour
[53:25] out his Blessing
[53:26] upon you because you know you have
[53:30] confidence in
[53:32] him am I telling the truth all
[53:36] life let me tell you time for us to be
[53:41] serious you know why I don't know why
[53:44] I'm like that but when I was a kid from
[53:47] 11 years I live with
[53:51] soldiers my uncle was a
[53:53] soldier as soon as they hear the Trum
[53:56] trumpet sound every trumpet means
[53:59] something and when a soldier hear a
[54:01] trumpet you will see how they
[54:04] react they don't joke because
[54:09] sometime the trumpet
[54:11] mean they coming after you the
[54:15] soldiers because there is a coup they
[54:18] have overthrow the
[54:20] government in Africa in here I don't
[54:23] know but in Africa so when you he hear
[54:26] the
[54:27] trumpet you have to get your rifle ready
[54:31] your dress your clothes within a few
[54:33] second you have to dress up your gun
[54:36] have to be sharp because if you joke the
[54:39] enemy will take your head
[54:41] off you from Africa brother you know how
[54:44] it is the cool the soldiers Nigerians
[54:48] Ghana Bina for all those
[54:52] areas so when a soldier there here the
[54:55] trumpet
[54:57] they know they have to
[55:00] react and as a believer in Christ we are
[55:05] living in the last
[55:07] hour the trumpet is sounding every day
[55:11] it's almost getting time to
[55:14] close we don't know when the last one
[55:16] will come only God knows so while the
[55:21] trumpet is sounding we should do
[55:24] everything to get into God Ark and the
[55:28] Ark is the word of God is the Cass for
[55:32] this day for you to eat so that it will
[55:35] fortify you for the journey because this

[57:31] you don't need to
[57:33] worry I'm sorry to say so many of the
[57:38] message people but it's the truth are
[57:41] too much intellectual they have packed
[57:44] knowledge knowledge knowledge knowledge
[57:46] knowledge knowledge
[57:49] knowledge but they don't want to allow
[57:53] the the quicking power to quick
[57:56] that knowledge that they have
[57:59] pack there's a time that we used to pack
[58:03] knowledge but the knowledge days are
[58:06] what
[58:07] over now we have to turn to Quicken
[58:11] power now you have to let the Holy
[58:14] Spirit Quicken that knowledge that you
[58:16] have take so that you know that God is
[58:19] on your side then you have confidence in
[58:24] him let me tell you
[58:26] when a man married a
[58:29] woman sometime they don't know where the
[58:31] future will bring to them but that woman
[58:34] put his faith in the man and that man
[58:38] put his faith in the
[58:40] woman and they says honey we're going to
[58:44] make it thick or cold or hot right am I
[58:49] telling you sisters or brothers that
[58:51] have married wrong or truth it says
[58:55] thick or cold or heart we going to make
[58:57] it right you coming to
[59:02] Jesus he has chose you you have come to
[59:05] him put your life in his
[59:08] hand wherever you want to lead you so
[59:12] be but sometime oh my life is with Jesus
[59:17] Jesus I give you 50% of my life but that
[59:21] 50 I
[59:24] control you understand understand I
[59:27] control this is mine they don't say it
[59:31] but their action will speak better than
[59:33] what
[59:35] w the Lord wants all of
[59:39] you all you have within you put it
[59:43] before the table and say here Lord I am
[59:47] take as I am do with me as you want do
[59:52] with me as you will and you watch
[59:57] you watch then greater things you will
[1:00:00] see in your own life greater
[1:00:05] things the Lord will use you greater
[1:00:08] things that it will shock you think
[1:00:12] about it how did John the Baptist a
[1:00:17] literate could
[1:00:19] preach and saw Christ coming and
[1:00:22] identify
[1:00:24] him what make him do that because all he
[1:00:30] was he gave it to Christ when Christ
[1:00:32] called
[1:00:33] him all he was at the age of nine the
[1:00:37] Lord told him go into the Wilderness he
[1:00:40] went
[1:00:44] right he didn't trust his own mind
[1:00:48] brother brah was not trusting in his own
[1:00:50] mind but let me tell you you compare
[1:00:54] listening to the T me I can't read the
[1:00:57] books by listening to the tape but let
[1:01:00] me tell
[1:01:01] you the whole
[1:01:04] world if you check the knowledge that or
[1:01:07] the
[1:01:08] wisdom that come from that
[1:01:11] man and put all this their PHD this that
[1:01:15] that people to me he have sense more
[1:01:18] than all of
[1:01:22] them you may say k why are you saying
[1:01:25] this you are you are ignorant that's
[1:01:27] fine for me but I'm telling you the
[1:01:30] truth because God wisdom is good
[1:01:34] knowledge but the wisdom of the Lord the
[1:01:37] world is foolishness unto the Lord don't
[1:01:41] you know that so if a man or a woman you
[1:01:46] don't have the wisdom of God all the
[1:01:49] wisdom you have is what foolishness unto
[1:01:52] the Lord and who is stronger than God
[1:01:56] God wisdom is wiser than
[1:01:59] Humanity am I telling the truth or
[1:02:03] lie because since his wisdom created
[1:02:06] this world I will challenge any
[1:02:09] scientist he shouldn't take one leave
[1:02:12] and make me one
[1:02:14] leave not taking what God has done they
[1:02:19] call it nature but that nature God made
[1:02:21] it
[1:02:23] yes you have to take this and mix with
[1:02:25] this Miss with that and get this and you
[1:02:27] say you are s this God didn't take
[1:02:30] nothing he just spoke it and he
[1:02:33] came you understand and that's what God
[1:02:36] is getting you and I
[1:02:39] to that his
[1:02:42] word we will
[1:02:44] surrender and speak it and it will
[1:02:49] happen because we are am mature
[1:02:53] God when we speak we we have our
[1:02:57] characteristic is like our
[1:02:59] father right and when we speak it it
[1:03:03] happened
[1:03:05] right that's what the Lord want us to
[1:03:08] get into we lose the mind of this
[1:03:12] world even though we have to go to work
[1:03:14] we have to eat we have to uh sleep if
[1:03:18] you are manager you are manager this but
[1:03:20] don't put your heart into those things

[1:03:35] walk by faith those things are real the
[1:03:38] things your eye cannot see because
[1:03:40] that's what our father Jesus is trying
[1:03:43] to get us
[1:03:45] into that's why sorry to say we the
[1:03:50] uneducated
[1:03:52] people when we see something

[1:03:59] heart when God speak and we like it he
[1:04:02] says oh I see this is God they we we go
[1:04:07] with our heart it's just like a woman

[1:04:40] education between it the heart and me
[1:04:45] when I saw this message that brother
[1:04:48] Brown brought the Bible begin to open up
[1:04:52] wow when Pastor Salon preached I said
[1:04:56] that's it that's it for brother Kofi you
[1:05:00] may come in Dy literate this it does not
[1:05:04] matter to me but in my soul it is thus
[1:05:09] say the
[1:05:10] Lord when the prophet William Brown
[1:05:13] preach with I listen to the tape all I
[1:05:17] can see in my heart I don't understand
[1:05:20] everything but it does say the Lord and
[1:05:24] it will take me to meet the Lord in the
[1:05:26] air so my heart is open so that every
[1:05:32] word of God if it is not good Lord take
[1:05:35] it away those things that are good Lord
[1:05:40] help me to know more and more help me to
[1:05:44] eat more and more and let me tell you

[1:05:54] beloved Son in him I'm well pleased to
[1:05:58] dwell in him I'm not talking about Jesus
[1:06:01] only you are part of
[1:06:04] that then God can use you God can
[1:06:08] manifest through you God can do greater
[1:06:12] things in
[1:06:14] you
[1:06:17] but most of all the
[1:06:19] times we human
[1:06:22] being even though the Lord is to us we
[1:06:26] become
[1:06:27] lazy I'm number one God have to come and

[1:07:35] me he as you to eat the
[1:07:38] book eat it be like a

[1:07:49] fail what do you do the cow do eat the
[1:07:53] grasses how you going to produce me

[1:08:00] glasses by next year he produce
[1:08:04] milk be like
[1:08:06] that when it's not good that's why he
[1:08:10] have his Pastor there you call me behind
[1:08:15] and say kof you says this okay move it
[1:08:18] this way move it that way I will
[1:08:22] listen me I'm not here for
[1:08:26] popularity God don't call me to be
[1:08:29] popular he called me to be
[1:08:31] humble God didn't call you to be popular
[1:08:35] he called you to be
[1:08:37] humble right oh yes he call us to be
[1:08:43] humble too many
[1:08:47] Believers I seen some girls some ladies
[1:08:51] they wear long dress long the the close
[1:08:56] here but the spirit in them hasn't
[1:09:01] changed the spirit in them hasn't
[1:09:03] changed one
[1:09:07] bit it's not what God
[1:09:10] want is the heart the
[1:09:14] mental the heart is the heart clean
[1:09:19] heart God want
[1:09:21] humility God humility not man humility
[1:09:26] then God can use
[1:09:28] you God can possess you because the
[1:09:33] ccass he's given to you the word is
[1:09:35] opening
[1:09:37] up and once the word is open up he want
[1:09:41] you to eat that's why it
[1:09:46] says the spirit of Jesus Christ the
[1:09:50] spirit of the Bride are what
[1:09:53] one if you are testing come and
[1:09:57] drink let's say you walking on the
[1:10:00] Arizona
[1:10:01] desert and you are test you there's no
[1:10:06] water and somebody has brought
[1:10:10] you drop PL passing and dropping water
[1:10:14] for you are you going to scrutinize the
[1:10:17] water oh this is clean water this is
[1:10:20] that water this is this you have no time
[1:10:24] I remember 1998
[1:10:27] 1983 I was in
[1:10:29] Nigeria and they deported ghans were
[1:10:33] about 1 million people deported and
[1:10:37] let's see all of us to have to pass
[1:10:41] Buffalo so many of us some even stay in
[1:10:46] the bush no water to drink this that the
[1:10:49] only thing you could get is you see a
[1:10:52] helicopter running on the sky
[1:10:55] very hot and dropping blood and
[1:10:59] water people were going
[1:11:03] crazy and look at me now around that
[1:11:06] time I was so skinny and so
[1:11:09] small right the life was so tough we
[1:11:12] hustling to go to Better Life another
[1:11:15] country but when you get that one water
[1:11:19] people running and fighting and doing
[1:11:22] everything to get water to drink people
[1:11:24] have live in the bush for three 4 days I
[1:11:28] was
[1:11:29] inside but by God's
[1:11:33] grace when you get that water you don't
[1:11:36] check oh the water have worms and this
[1:11:40] and that no you drink it you don't drink
[1:11:43] it you
[1:11:45] die if you don't hear the word of God
[1:11:48] what are you going to
[1:11:49] do that's why even sometime Believers
[1:11:53] become weak they become
[1:11:56] sick you see them they come here once in
[1:12:02] a two months 3 months then you wonder
[1:12:06] how can he even how is he
[1:12:09] surviving naturally when you don't eat
[1:12:12] don't you know you get
[1:12:14] sick so when the food is cooked every
[1:12:18] day the pastor is taking his time let me
[1:12:21] tell you don't take it for granted it's
[1:12:24] not just we wake up and come and stand
[1:12:26] here
[1:12:27] and then we close the Bible and we go
[1:12:30] home no you don't know why you were
[1:12:35] sleeping I was thinking oh God what am I
[1:12:40] supposed to bring for my brothers and
[1:12:42] sisters which way you want me to say
[1:12:47] what do you want me to say to
[1:12:50] them Lord I don't have knowledge to
[1:12:54] speak but I'm trusting in you I'm laying
[1:12:57] my heart to
[1:12:59] you have mercy on me so that I I won't
[1:13:03] speak my mind I'll speak your mind to
[1:13:06] them I'll speak what you want that they
[1:13:10] will receive it and it will be a
[1:13:13] blessing to
[1:13:14] them I believe every five four Ministry
[1:13:20] that stand here do that
[1:13:25] so you the
[1:13:28] congregation pray for the pastor pray
[1:13:31] for everyone that stand
[1:13:33] here it's not
[1:13:36] easy Once you come in to preach you are
[1:13:38] not
[1:13:40] sleeping you may be on bed my mind is
[1:13:44] thinking this way that way and the devil
[1:13:46] is fighting this you try to to try to
[1:13:49] bring the word right you you you you
[1:13:52] want your mind to channel to God so that
[1:13:55] y all of a sudden you see the Devil
[1:13:57] comes in and he show you all kinds of
[1:14:01] scriptures and he doesn't tied up and
[1:14:04] you says oh God then you realize hey
[1:14:08] Lord I am nothing without
[1:14:12] you but last minute you'll find out that
[1:14:16] something will be
[1:14:17] cooking then you know that hey if I come
[1:14:21] here the Lord is with me so he will feed
[1:14:25] his children brothers and sisters I
[1:14:29] really appreciate you so much I love
[1:14:32] this good neighbor
[1:14:34] Ministry I love the people that you are
[1:14:37] in you are my brothers and sisters you
[1:14:40] are you are
[1:14:42] my uh I say I'll be with you in eternity
[1:14:47] with God so you are my real sisters and
[1:14:53] brothers I'm not
[1:14:56] joking I am not I speak from my heart I
[1:15:01] love you in
[1:15:03] Christ and I will always love
[1:15:06] you if I do something wrong or you see
[1:15:09] something wrong Don't Be Afraid point me
[1:15:13] to the right way even if I don't cease
[1:15:16] it and it's trueth God will show me and
[1:15:21] I will obey once God show me I will obey
[1:15:26] because without him I am
[1:15:29] nothing that should be your attitude and
[1:15:32] be willing to subject to the pastor
[1:15:35] whatever the pastor says to you obey and
[1:15:40] follow don't do your own
[1:15:43] things obey the pastor because
[1:15:47] everything God wanted to do it go
[1:15:51] through the pastor first
[1:15:56] and if you obey you get
[1:15:59] blessing if you obey the holy spirit in
[1:16:03] the past that some will broke and come
[1:16:05] to you why do you think look at me God
[1:16:09] will put me here I came to the
[1:16:13] church I my heart I want a
[1:16:17] clean always I want a
[1:16:20] clean sometime I'm cleaning Pastor Simon
[1:16:24] that time everybody is not there I'm
[1:16:26] alone you come and hold the broom trying
[1:16:30] to clean with me and I wish I could
[1:16:32] divide myself into two so that I hold
[1:16:36] half he hold half and we clean the I
[1:16:39] clean I hold half and the Half of Me
[1:16:43] Hold the broom from his hand and we
[1:16:45] clean the church God saw that and I'm
[1:16:49] not saying for poity take it the right
[1:16:52] way
[1:16:55] right because when you do those things
[1:16:58] God
[1:17:00] somehow whatever you doing not just
[1:17:03] cleaning alone do with all your
[1:17:06] heart for the Lord you'll get
[1:17:10] blessed the Lord won't forsake you he
[1:17:14] will bless you e let your eye first go
[1:17:19] in the
[1:17:20] ccass what is the ccass the word of God
[1:17:23] for your day everything you doing if
[1:17:27] your eye don't go on the word and you
[1:17:29] are clearing and you are doing
[1:17:32] works then it become a
[1:17:35] hypocrite but when your eye go in the
[1:17:38] word
[1:17:39] first before anything add
[1:17:43] up God is
[1:17:45] pleased because Jesus said I honor my
[1:17:49] word above my name is that not
[1:17:53] right so once the word is first absolute
[1:17:57] in your
[1:17:59] heart then the works
[1:18:02] follow then the words to you do it with
[1:18:07] all your
[1:18:08] heart then God will bless you God will
[1:18:13] honor you God will let the people even
[1:18:17] cease
[1:18:19] it those that have ey to see that oh
[1:18:22] this brother have the Holy Spirit they
[1:18:24] will know
[1:18:27] they will know God will show
[1:18:31] you to them that yes I'm in my
[1:18:36] servant I'm in him regardless what you
[1:18:39] think I am in him so when he speak hear
[1:18:44] him it's not him speaking it's I the
[1:18:48] Lord speaking hear
[1:18:50] him because he said I honor my word
[1:18:53] above my name
[1:18:57] because those that are not
[1:19:00] his when they speak they speak worse but
[1:19:04] those that are his he honor the
[1:19:08] word you know it's the
[1:19:11] Lord you have
[1:19:14] confidence why the word is coming and I
[1:19:18] believe in here we are so
[1:19:23] blessed we are so so blessed that we we
[1:19:27] don't realize
[1:19:28] it when I go some place and
[1:19:32] preach I see how God even I'm let's say
[1:19:36] I'm in
[1:19:37] montre and some are calling me let's say

[1:20:27] God will show that is not coffee coffee

[1:20:34] doing
[1:20:36] everything so let us love one
[1:20:40] another bind our heart with God love
