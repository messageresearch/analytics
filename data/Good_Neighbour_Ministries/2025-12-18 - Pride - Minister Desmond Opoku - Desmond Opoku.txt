Amen. &gt;&gt; Every word you have to be happy &gt;&gt; because the word they have a correction, &gt;&gt; they have a rejoicing, they have chastisement, they everything is inside the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We're going to read our scripture today. Uh the book of Acts chapter 12 verse 12- 24. The book of Acts chapter 12 verse 12- 24. Let us pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for this great evening. We thank you for giving us a life once again to be in your house of worship, healthy and strong, boldness and and happiness and joy of our salvation. Father, we give you all the glory and praise and honor that you deserve for saving our life. Give us a salvation, eternal life. Father, we are here to hear your word. We are here to have a fellowship with you. Father, won't you come down this evening among us and speak to us for a while? Father, we bid you welcome in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. And amen. Okay. the book of Act 12:2- 24 and when he had considered the thing he came to the house of Mary and mother the mother of John whose surname was Mark where many were gathered together praying and as Peter knocked the door of the gate a dam came to Harkin named Roda her. And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened he opened not the gate of the for gladness, but running and told how Peter stood before the gate. And they said unto her, Thou are mad. But she continually affirmed that it was even so. Then said the it it is his angel. But Peter continued knocking. And when they had opened the door and saw him, they were astonished. But he not he beckoned unto them with a hand [clears throat] with a with a hand to hold their peace. declare unto them how the Lord has brought him out of the prison. And he said, And he said, "Go show these things unto James and to the brethren." And he departed and went into another place. Now, as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter. And when and when Herod had sought for him and found him not, he examined the keepers and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judea to Cesaria, and there and there abode. And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tara and Sidon. But they came to they came with a they came with one accord to him and saying made blastors the kings chambering their friend desire peace because their country was nourished by the king's country and upon a set day Herod arrayed in royal apparel sat upon his throne and made an oration unto them. And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of God, of a God, and not a man, not of a man. Immediately the angel of the Lord smoked him, because he gave not God the glory. And he was eaten up. He was eating off worms and gave up the ghost. But the word of God grow grew and multiply and Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem. And when they had fulfilled their ministry and took with them John whose surname was Mark. You may be seated. My my topic tonight is about pride. Pride. Pride. Pride is uh the meaning of pride is an excessive sinful self exaltation that elevate one's own will, wisdom or strength above God leading to arrogance, rebearing and ruin. When you read provert said pride good before destruction and healthy spirit before a fall. So Paul uh uh Herod you know we are the children of God and when God is doing something he deserve his glory. &gt;&gt; God doesn't share his glory to no man. Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how wisdom you have, how learned you are, how how how spiritual you are. God is God. &gt;&gt; He challenged his word above anything. So this man, this man uh uh Herod, when God did something that nobody ever seen before about Peter, why did they put Peter in jail? Because of the word of God. They wanted us to kill him. But I'm telling you tonight, no Satan can put his hand on you. Nobody can kill you because the word of God is in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you are eternal. Your mouth is God mouth. &gt;&gt; Your heart is God heart. God is jealous of you. Because only you can glorify God. &gt;&gt; Only you can give praises to God. &gt;&gt; Only you can worship him the way that he want you to worship him. Hallelujah. So we ARE A SPECIAL and pecurial people in the face of this earth right now. &gt;&gt; As we always say the word of God is growing, growing, growing every day. We becoming like him. &gt;&gt; It's going to reach a time everything that you speak will come to pass. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. THE TROUBLE COMES, STAND ON THE POST OF your duty as a son or daughter of God and see the hand of God in your life. God is building us perfectly. We are the bride of Christ. Do you believe that you are bride of Christ? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have to walk with confidence, faithful as a a child of God. Do not fear nothing. God, nobody can touch you. Don't lose your God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; STAND FIRM with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Pride is very very dangerous in Christ in in Christian life. Pride pride can make you fall. You always have to be who you are. Don't ever lift up yourself. Don't ever lift yourself up. Be humble and stay. God is ready to use us. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; And when God uses you, the glory belongs to him. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO PRAISE HIM. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO GLORIFY HIM. GOD LOVE WHEN YOU DANCE around his word. WHEN GOD USES YOU and you start dancing around what he has DONE THROUGH YOU AND GIVE HIM THE GLORY BECAUSE WE OURSELVES we cannot do nothing. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you and B I see when somebody is laying down with pain he has no place to turn. He can't turn to his wife. He can't turn to his mother. He can't turn to his aunt. Nobody. Your faith only belongs to God. That's where you can get your help. The doctors can do as much as they can, but it will reach a certain point of time they will tell you, "We cannot do nothing. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do? Build your faith in God. &gt;&gt; We be coming here hearing the word of God. God is building that. He's adding precept upon precept. A little here, a little here, a little here. Don't take it granted. Every time you comes to the service, you think you don't get nothing, you get something. Let something happen to you. Then you know what you got. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; NEVER LOSE. NEVER LOSE HOPE. &gt;&gt; Never ever lose hope. &gt;&gt; God is real &gt;&gt; AND GOD LOVES YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Pride is not only happen in the holy congregation. Pride can happen to the ministers we see around ourself. So ministers can have the wisdom to bring forth the word and some has faith to bring forth the word and some have knowledge to put things together. You cannot touch it up. But it reach a certain point of time THEY LIFT THEMSELVES UP ABOVE other ministers &gt;&gt; TRY TO TELL THE OTHER ministers what to do for their congregation. But this message is not like that. &gt;&gt; The minister is the head of that church apart from God to him to his congregation. No minister is above your pastor. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you believe in him, you will see the hand of God &gt;&gt; in your life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let us say with the word, THE WORD DOES NOT CHANGE. &gt;&gt; I will give you scriptures. MANY OF GOD people whom the prophet the kings whom God has called and they fail to lift they fail to glorify God and they lift up their yourself above what God gave it to them and they get into trouble. This message is a warning to everybody. &gt;&gt; Stay humble. God want to use you. &gt;&gt; That there the word is real. It's not a joke. It's real. You apply the word and let something happen. Then you know TELL YOU YOU WHAT I CAN TELL YOU. Exercise the word of God. What you hear, you have to put in practice. &gt;&gt; Then you will know the HAND OF GOD. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHAT GOD USE ME, he cannot use you. He cannot he cannot you God will use me different God will use different God will use that's why I always say God has a tool box and whenever he need that tool particular tool that time he pick it up &gt;&gt; SO YOU HAVE THE tool is always there ready the hammer is always there READY THE PRIZE is always there ready when you need it you pick it up and you use it and you put back there So you have to be ready to be used for God. And when you use for God, don't think you are above any you're above uh you above uh everybody. No. Stay humble. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. You know, I I I got to have uh this this now God is doing a body check. Check yourself. It doesn't have to be the word of God. You can be your sister. It can be your brother. You look higher than him. Maybe the way he dress, you think you dress higher than him or her. Maybe the way you do things, you think you are above her. You you put your brother or your sister down. We are all the same. &gt;&gt; Nobody's above anybody. &gt;&gt; We are the children of God. And the same place we are all going to the same place. &gt;&gt; If your sister single and sing nice, you you [clears throat] you enjoy the you enjoy the song. Don't think that oh this man his voice squeak then you just go around and and joke around with the sister or the brother or I'm just saying I'm just making a a a point. Don't don't get me wrong like I'm picking. I'm not picking up anybody. I'm just making a point. Okay. Let us love one another and cherish one another. We are one another's keeper. &gt;&gt; When you see your brother, your sister is in trouble, help that person. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what situation, TRY TO DO THE BEST AS YOU CAN. &gt;&gt; Because you see this body here, when somebody something affects me here, straight down, it goes to my brain and my brain send all the signal to my body. Right. &gt;&gt; Is the same thing to you and your brother and your sister. Let us live godly life. Let us live life for one another. In that way, God can use us mightily because the Bible said they were in one accord. When they were in one accord, there's nothing that you can penetrate between them. THEY LOVE ONE ANOTHER. &gt;&gt; YES. HALLELUJAH. ONE CAN DIE FOR ONE ANOTHER. ONE CAN SHARE HIS LAST FOOD WITH HIS BROTHER OR HIS HIS SISTER. So when they get together to pray together, something take place right there. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. LET US JOIN TOGETHER. LET'S WORSHIP TOGETHER. LET US LIFT THE NAME OF GOD UP. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND GOD WILL BLESS US ABUNDANTLY. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE SO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Let me tell you, there's more abundance of rain, more abundance of blessing is on the way for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SITUATION in spiritually, financially, health, everything, THERE'S MORE ABUNDANCE OF blessing God has in store FOR US. WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO DRAW THEM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] WE HAVE TO DRAW THEM. THE SAME THING LIKE a a a a honey draw bee, right? Anywhere there's a a a honey there, the bee will go over there, right there. So God is ready to do something among us. We are the one who going to embrace it by the word of God through the love of God in our heart. Hallelujah. You know pride always take things away from you. God cannot use you because you glorify yourself. You lift up yourself above everything. Even God also. You don't have power. I don't have power. It's the grace OF GOD. THAT'S WHY WE ARE ALL SITTING HERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU SEE MY English is not good like brother Mike. But it doesn't matter whether I speak African through it. You still can hear. &gt;&gt; Go hear every every languages. Hallelujah. They say, "Oh, maybe his English is doesn't put his grammar or this." Brother Abraham, brother Abraham doesn't have no grammar. They say they say but one one brother said brother Abraham we sell poet or pit pit. But you understand I don't I I HE TRIED TO DO THIS IN the and they grab him here but what make Abraham the Holy Ghost is behind him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT THE WORST. IS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE WORD OF GOD THAT BEHIND YOU. MAKE YOU CHRISTIAN, MAKE YOU BELIEVER, MAKE YOU A SON OF GOD, A DAUGHTER OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THE WORD OF GOD [screaming] MAKE YOU DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. I'm telling you, prepare yourself. As the prophet said, run this I see a crowd. RUN FASTER. There's abundance of rain coming down. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND I AM HAPPY TO EMBRACE THAT. AND I BELIEVE IT'S COMING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S COMING. &gt;&gt; AND I BELIEVE I WILL GET MY PORTION. WILL YOU GET YOUR PORTION? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND THE PEOPLE MAY KNOW THAT YOU HAVE been with the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. We are not sitting here for church. &gt;&gt; WE ARE HERE FOR CHRIST. THE CHILDREN OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Do you know Peter, the the Holy Ghost took Peter out from the prison? IS NO MAN IS GOD [screaming] HIMSELF? &gt;&gt; IF GOD HIMSELF TOOK HIM OUT OF PRISON, ARE YOU NOT A son of God? ARE YOU NOT A DAUGHTER OF GOD? IS THAT GOD CAN WITHHOLD anything from you? No. GOD CAN GIVE YOU ANYTHING THAT YOU NEED. IT'S IS THE WAY THAT YOU ASK &gt;&gt; OR YOUR FAITH. Do you really believe what is coming? If you really believe, stand firm. [snorts] Something great is about to happen. &gt;&gt; We are not praying church. This is not this is not a joke. You see the whole world around you what is coming. They prepare to coming after us and that's the time we're going to go. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. WE ARE INVISIBLE. GLORY TO GOD. SOMETIME I'M SO HAPPY I START dancing at factory there. &gt;&gt; YEAH. SOMETIME I I FEEL LIKE I CAN TURN THE WHOLE WORLD upside down. And I believe that it GOING TO COME. WHATEVER YOU speak it going to come to pass. &gt;&gt; It's a demonstration for brother Abraham. FOR THE BRIDE. THE LORD HAS NOT CHANGED. HUMBLE YOURSELF. STAY WITH THE WORD OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. And believe what God has given to you. GOD DID NOT BROUGHT YOU HERE for just to sit on the pew. He brought you here PER PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; AND YOUR PURPOSE IS ABOUT TO SHINE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Oh, glory to God. Amen. Pride cannot take you nowhere. Humble thou yourself. Stay with the stay under the the ministry and ripe be juicy. HALLELUJAH. NOBODY don't want or sour orange. Everybody want sweet oranges. SEE APPLE BE SEAT AS SWEET can be WHERE PEOPLE CAN NEVER avoid you. You know what? Some some time ago, not long about maybe a six or eight months ago, I went to buy something from somewhere and I start share the word of God with them and they get so excited. I I I left last week. This woman had a problem. He said his daughter or his son has a problem. He said he went to the Catholic place and he told him that their son in the night it seems that he's tormented in their home. So he went to the Cath place to go there and pray for that place there. He said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't deal with that. He's scared." So he said he look around. He couldn't find nobody. He couldn't have anybody mind. And then I crank his mind. Then he called me and I said okay I will come and pray and if you believe you will get what you believe and God when you God give you something you got to worship him. &gt;&gt; You don't nothing give you nothing. &gt;&gt; You scared you cannot leave. If God deliver you what you GOING TO DO? GLORIFY HIM. &gt;&gt; GIVE HIM GLORY. &gt;&gt; PRAISE HIM. &gt;&gt; ADORE HIM. YOU KNOW YOUR CAR CANNOT HELP YOU. IT'S ITALIAN. CATHOLIC CANNOT HELP YOU. YOU ARE PRIEST EVEN SCARED. He asked me what should I buy? I buy rosary. I buy I buy incense. I said no no no no. I don't need that. The devil doesn't The devil doesn't SCARE THAT. ALL WHAT HE SCARES IS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST, THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. HEY, WE HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. THE WORLD KNOW THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, YOU LOOK AROUND ALL HER WORLD WHERE I pass through her mind. Why he pass through her mind? Because what I told her, he saw the reality and THE POWER BE BEHIND IT. My brethren, don't underestimate yourself. Amen. You know what happened to Saul? Saul was a God called Saul to be the king and God WAS WITH HIM ALL THE TIME. He answer HIM THROUGH THE PROPHET. THERE IS NO ONE WORD GOD EVER failed to answer Saul. But Saul left his heart and what happened? The spirit of God, what did he do? It left him. IF YOU LIFT UP YOURSELF WITH A PRIDE, THE SPIRIT OF GOD WILL LEAVE YOU. GOD WILL NEVER HEAR YOUR PRAYER. THEN YOU GET STUCK. Whatever you do, it cannot work. God doesn't like pride. PRIDE DOES NOT WORK. IF YOU LOOK AROUND YOU, even our message, THE BROTHER MESSAGE, ALL THE MINISTERS WHO LIFT THEIR SELF UP ABOVE ALL THE ministers where they are every GOHEAD THAT GOHEAD PRIDE, [screaming] PRIDE CANNOT TAKE YOU NOWHERE. AND PRIDE. THE WORD OF GOD IS NOT FOR ANYBODY. It's for God. By his grace, he has called us to use us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; The love The Lord love you so much. &gt;&gt; God left po Saul. Then what he has to do? Even the prophet told told them go do you do this when he come? He took the the the the fat one, the good one, the poorish one. So this one I can use in my chamber. Oh, this one I can use my chamber. Oh, this one I can use my chamber. And the prophet came and said, "What did you do? What God told you to do? He didn't do that. You took whatever you want today. God strip everything that he have from you. So end up to where the witchcraft because he can hear if you God take his hand from you, you are nothing. YOU ARE DEAD AS DEAD CAN BE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU ARE DEAD. A Christian without the Holy Ghost is nothing. If you don't have a Holy Ghost, then what are you doing here? YOU NEED THE HOLY GHOST. YOU NEED THE HOLY GHOST to guide you. &gt;&gt; SO WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST, GOD TAKE the Holy Ghost out from you. Where where would you be? &gt;&gt; You're done. By what? By pride. pride. He lifted himself up. Uzziah, King Uzziah, he was A A GOOD MAN. SERVE THE LORD ALL HIS DAYS. And one time he lift himself up above the prophet. And what God did RIGHT THERE instantly it struck him. leprosy. He never come back again. Through leprosy, he died. He died through the leprosy. 2 Chronicle. Hallelujah. So pride is not good for no nobody. I don't know why God give me this message, but this message is for everybody. Set yourself up. Sometime there's something inside there you don't know but you think you are right but you're not right. Sometime I I I know somebody perfectly healthy. I I I I I saw I saw this lady every morning. I said, you know, we we do this. We we say hello, good morning, how are you? And this and that. We talk, we laugh, and this. The next time, the lady was not sick. The same morning he went to work. From work he gets sick. From from work he gets sick. From that sickness, they take him to hospital. Two days he die. He was sick. He didn't know he was sick, full of debt. ALL everything is inside of her is done. But she was working. He was doing like you see him as a normal. Sometime you look like normal. But inside there's something there. That's why I said it's a body checkup. Check yourself. Don't let nothing hinder you and your salvation. That's only thing you have right now. If God has given you salvation, the eternal life, make it work for you. He gave it to you to use. If you DON'T USE, WHO GOING to use it? I'm using mine. What about yours? Use it. WHEN YOU MEET SOMEBODY IN THE IN in the in the street or anywhere, say hello. You don't know what the person going through. Just a say good morning. How are you today? And you smile the smile on your face will take him for take him or her for the whole day. Cuz when you smile, God smile. You understand? Who going to smile for God? YOU.

He's always there with him. One guy from from Africa during the war, he lost, they were coming to catch him. He was a king and he ran to the bush and God found him in the bush so many years. So everywhere he go my father God is always working with him and he called him my father and God brought him these people God brought him to United States. This is a true storyh this is not just a talk he DID SO MUCH MIRACLES SO MUCH IN AMERICA and they want to take him to school and that's where they kill him. They kill his his spirit. The spirit that was using him was no schooling because he know God face to face. He talked to God face to face. You take me to school for what? I don't care about my grammar. I KNOW THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. I DON'T CARE HOW I SPEAK. I CAN SPEAK AFRICAN TO YOU. HALLELUJAH. AND I'M NOT AFRAID AND I'M NOT SCARED. I'M NOT ASHAMED. I'M NOT ASHAMED FOR WHAT GOD HAS GIVEN TO ME.

BUT MY JOB is I'm a Christian and I believe the only one true maker, only one God who created heaven and earth, who made me, who called me and make me and give you a salvation. I GIVE YOU ETERNAL LIFE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S ONLY HIM I I I I I worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Okay, I have a tape there. I'm going to pray for you about Moses. How Mo Brother uh Moses God spoke to him. Speak to the rock. Hit the rock. Okay. The water come. You went smell the rock. Smile the rock. And God said, "Come here. YOU GR BY YOURSELF. [screaming] YOU DIDN'T DO WHAT I tell YOU TO DO. COME HERE." YOU SEE, you will never see that land that I I I I'm taking you. I promise you. But you take my glory. You take MY GLORY FOR YOURSELF. THEY ARE MY PEOPLE. You are his people. Right now, God has placed you under him. You have to listen to him. You understand? IT DOESN'T MATTER. YOU KNOW THE OLD days sometime they brought a a a a a 12 year old, six year old to be the king over Israelites. Who dare go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go and stand that king there because he's a kid or anything or whatever it is and say something to him you are dead when God set this his his things up his church up don't play with it stay with it and let God have his way and you'll be blessed &gt;&gt; you are blessed you think when I say you are blessed you think I'm just joking. YOU ARE BLESSED. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T KNOW YOU are blessed. I AM BLESSED. YOU GOT TO EXERCISE and and get what you are blessing from yourself. You don't do you cannot see. You don't you don't search, you cannot find. You have to get it. You get it. You know, Brahma said when he when he goes to the bush and he want to see, he just pick up uh leaves, he throw it like that and he create a whirlwind and by the time you realize God is there speaking to God, do something to attract God. leaving your job, your skills, wherever you are, everything concern you, God is interested about it &gt;&gt; because you are his son, you are his child, you are everything you he depend upon you. Please can you play that tape? show himself above somebody else. You remember when Moses did that? &gt;&gt; You remember God gave him power &gt;&gt; to do whatever he wanted to. Made him a prophet. He walked down to that rock and he smoked the rock the second time. That was against God's will. &gt;&gt; God said, "SPEAK TO THAT ROCK. &gt;&gt; DON'T SMITE IT AGAIN. You break all the all the the tithe here. The rock's only going to be smitten once. But he spoke of the weakness of the word when he did that. That wasn't sufficient. Yeah. The word was what was going on that rock was the word. &gt;&gt; See, he first time he smoked the rock and the waters come forth. And then they got thirsty again. He said, "Now go back and speak the rock." He's only smitten once. &gt;&gt; See the insufficiency of the word. Moses testified to it. The word wasn't right. He had to be smitten again. So Moses went down there and smoked the rock like that. He said, "Come forth." Did come forth. SO HE SPOILED AND SAID, "COME FORTH. I COMMAND YOU to come forth." The waters come. God said, "Come up here. Come here. YOU GLORIFIED [screaming] YOURSELF. YOU TOOK MY POWER. INSTEAD OF SANCTIFYING ME, you sanctified yourself." Yes. &gt;&gt; Now you're not going over in the land. Look over and see what it looked like. But here you're going to leave right here. Oh my. And never has been one like Moses, you know. &gt;&gt; No. No. When he come to that show off with Jesus, HE SAID, "GET UP FROM THE TEMPLE HERE AND JUMP OFF." HE SAID, "IT'S WRITTEN." AMEN. &gt;&gt; Don't tempt the Lord thy God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He met him at the word, not every major assault. No true servant ever tries to show himself off in with God's power. If he does, he loses his right hand. &gt;&gt; Third greatest song. SATAN OFFERED TO FORFEIT THIS KINGDOM to him. He did. &gt;&gt; He did. Satan said, "See these kingdoms OF THE WORLD, THESE ARE MINE. I'LL DO THEM WHATEVER I WANT TO. I'LL FORFEIT THEM TO YOU." But you remember he was trying to get him to forfeit it without the cross. &gt;&gt; If he would be lost, &gt;&gt; he could have kept the kingdom, but he must follow THE HE MUST COME BACK. HE WAS TEMPTED to do it now. &gt;&gt; That's a hard thing. He was tempted to take his liberty and be the king of the earth without the cross. But if you do, you're subject to the doubt. Satan would gladly made that proposition with him. &gt;&gt; But he said, "Get behind me, Satan." &gt;&gt; He didn't do it. &gt;&gt; He come and suffered and took the hard, rugged route. &gt;&gt; He took the route of persecution. He took the route of death. Are we this morning willing to do that same route that he taken? &gt;&gt; Are we willing to die? Are we willing to give ourselves up to God? forfeit all the world and things to serve for him. See, now he failed to do it willingly to to forfeit it. Satan was to him, but he didn't do it. Though Jesus was tempted, he overcome for us. He He endured all temptation for me and for you. See, he could have took it right there. But what did he take the other out for? so that we could come be with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if he paid such a price as that, then how little would we be &gt;&gt; not to take it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And remember, there's nothing here anyhow. &gt;&gt; If you live a 100 years, what are you going to come to? Mental in your mind gone, all crippled up and old and shaky. That's where you're going. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the end of it. &gt;&gt; You come now. &gt;&gt; Overcome the things. How do you do it? by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What the word says you do. Walk humble. Live before Jesus. He endured all things for you and I. He is our example. How to overcome our evil generation as he overcome his evil generation. Remember when he comes to the earth just as much unbelief or more than there is at any time. It didn't bother him a bit. &gt;&gt; Well, they called him a devil instead of God. When they call him, &gt;&gt; see, humble thyself. Satan is always try to get you. You lose you you lose your guard, you're going to tempt you. So always let your your sword be sharp and you can reel like this. Satan scared of you cuz he know who you are. You have the power. You overshadow. You are threat to him. You see, so this is what I have for you today. Let down your pride and let the Holy Ghost have his way in your life, please. Is for you. Can the can the the musicians come? &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is a little exotic that I have for you. Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Let us stand this evening. Do you believe that God is here? &gt;&gt; He's here. There's not a service that God never be there. He's always there. If you need anything, don't look at me. Look at the word. The Lord Jesus Christ whom we worship. He is your peacemaker. He is your provider. He's your healer. He's your everything. Always give him the glory and honor [music] and praises.
