here in the house of the Lord praise God God bless you all we're going to go to the word Isaiah 54. we want to just read one verse and that way we'll be able to advance with our Bible study it's on unless the battery is bad it's on yeah okay I'm so happy to be here praise the Lord always to be in the presence of the Lord and to uh bring the word to you because um you know you normally as a human you have an idea of what you want to say but you don't know what God wants to say and how he's going to take that and turn that and use that for his glory and for his honor praise the Lord uh Isaiah 53 I have it in front of me here and let's read that 54 sorry Isaiah 54 verse 1. sing O Baron thou that didst not bear Break Forth into singing and cry aloud thou that did not travail with child for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife see it the Lord gracious Heavenly Father we thank thee tonight for this great opportunity as children of the most high god of our great king we ask your blessing upon this the water of the word May the spirit of God travel move upon the water's father and bring the word to life and reality to our hearts that we might enter in the Lord into this divine presence of the Lord as in the temple of Solomon but thank you Lord we have something greater for the greater than Solomon is here and oh God we are pulled into his Dimension we are pulled into his Spirit we are pulled into his atmosphere and we take you Lord that we can come in here so simply but yet knowing within our hearts that we are seated in Heavenly places in Jesus Christ Our Lord take your Lord none may understand none mayor appreciate what you're doing Lord but the wise the simple The Humble your children they recognize and they understand Lord what you are doing father and we praise and honor you and glorify you Lord that we have come to this hour from all the years of time and oh God as the song says through many dangers toils and snares we have already come and it's your grace that has brought us safe here Lord and brothers thus far and it's that Grace we are trusting that will lead us home we give you praise and honor in Jesus name amen God bless you please be seated Hallelujah now uh going to uh Corinthians 2 1 to 8 we're not going to read that because uh the verse that's important to us is where Paul was trying to not Paul was telling them that I don't come with the Excellency of man's speech I don't come with the Excellency of man's Wisdom but I come in the power of the Holy Spirit the demonstrations of the holy spirit amen praise God that your faith may not stand in the wisdom of man but that your faith May rest or stand upon the word of God now saying it that for our day and time Paul was literally saying as he himself was a great intellectual and academic Paul was trying to tell them I don't come here to bring you my Seminary knowledge I don't come here to bring you what I was taught by Gamaliel it's useful but that's not what I come here to bring bring to you at all amen praise God because he did not want the people's faith the or the people to have faith in a man because of the man's intellectual Talent our capacity or the left Lover's education people are attracted by such things but that is carnal because God has nothing to do with that you see once you come to the place where you understand that what God is seeking is not a man with great knowledge or whatever he wants somebody regardless of knowledge or no knowledge that could surrender themselves so that he can uh use them or flow through them to bring his wisdom his word and his power to his people so Paul is literally saying if a man comes with all the training the intellectual knowledge and the wisdom and the attainments and accomplishments that he has made from the Seminary the the whatever the the Bible school or whatever then the people's feet will tend to look towards that their faith will want to rest on that uh and if oh he's a great preacher because this this this this you see Hallelujah and then their faith will not rest on the Simplicity of the Gospel amen and uh under demonstrations of the power of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah so when God flows through ordinary or simple people or even a one that was educated but come to be humble and simple then uh God is even more glorifying because it's not expected that such a one will be able to speak that way or to be able to deliver the word in that way what God showing that he can pick up anything and use it for his glory and for his honor as long as it's surrendered to him Hallelujah and then the faith of the Believers will not be uh bounded or best or founded on worldly success it will not be bounded on intellectual attainments it will not be bounded or resting on how many degrees the man has or whatsoever like that amen yes sir oh sir but I tell you the people's fate amen what just rest on what they see that God that person has a Divine gift by which God can work through and deliver his word for his glory and for his honor amen praise God forevermore Hallelujah and you know uh Revelation is by grace and therefore it's all by grace that means that when that sort of a man is preaching or speaking he is speaking as we would say by faith because every sentence every other sentence every paragraph every every thought that's got to be by grace doesn't mean that he will have a sense of direction of knowing what in the heart God placed there to be said but every word for it to be inspired it can't be it can't be already in a mold in a form in a shape he's got to come speak him delivering the word ministering by faith by grace by revelation this is how that man comes in the presence of the Living God to deliver the word of God hallelujah amen praise God now let's read again our text I will read it sing all barren thou that didst not bear Break Forth into singing and cry aloud thou that didst not travail with child amen you you didn't travail with child but you got a whole lot of children right that's what the prophet is saying you you you you didn't travail with child you didn't really go through any child birth but yet you have a whole host of children all around you like that for more of the children are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife said the Lord quoting brother Branham now although the denominational churches will [Music] a thousand to one they will outnumber the bride in number one thousand to one do you believe that then he calls Isaiah 54 1 here amen you see four more are the children of the Harlot church amen you will have greater numbers the Harlot will always have greater numbers then they married wife see oh my Lord hallelujah but though they have more numbers they have no true father amen they have no true father whatsoever oh my why because they are incubator chickens they're incubator chickens they come through a denominational mechanical system and they are born from in this machine so there is no father they don't know no father they just know that they come from that machine and uh you know when they come through that machine the the machine can always put out more uh and more and more and more it's like uh I'm just remembering a quotation where it says that you know all the most of the other words can have a whole lot of eggs and bring forth a whole uh flock of uh of uh children or chickens to follow them but the eagle one year and maybe they'll get one egg and one child following them right and so it's the same thing the the Harlot Church may have a whole ton of them but it takes God an aid sometimes to produce one Abraham or one Noah in a whole age might be one man amen and even in the time that we're living in that's why Jesus said it's going to come down when the pot boils down it's going to simmer right down and it's going to come to a few few there be that find them you hear brother brother who sung it over many start in the race but but the past began to get hot the law the road began to get long the weather the outside is hot the wind is blowing everything else trials trouble this that oh my goodness and what many started in the race but not many can continue in the race not to say that some kid uh drop out together glass of water and drop back in and run again but but my friends this is what we are looking at we are in the middle of that right now that I'm talking about amen by the way my subject is spiritual eunuchs foreign spiritual eunuchs now we just said they are incubated chickens they don't know who their father is and they unconsciously start to worship their Church the church become their Idol right now if I become practical I know this for a fact because we had chickens and stuff like that and you you maybe you know that too that the you put the duck eggs with the with the uh with the ham because there's no the same kind of warmth that that helps to hatch those eggs and uh you place them and the duck gets hatched out amongst the chickens and do you know when that duck hatches out he's following the hen around because they think that him is their mother is that right so they're born in this uh um denominational machine or Machinery right and they come to and when they come to it now they can get the same jumping shouting and warp that you can have in a message Church seeing the real truth but over there they can shout and jump too and they feel another kind of work and because they feel that and they look around see all these programs see the system see everything well formed well shaped everything moving every piston in line like that they just come and they believe that that is their mother and saw their misdirected from the word of God that they don't really know who their father is they're still tied up in the Trinity they don't know who their father is they don't recognize who their God is God Danielle 12 I believe said you are in that day in the last day then shall they the people that do not their God hallelujah will be wise in that hour when they come to know their God hallelujah I believe that there's people here today that come to know who God is and start to get some wisdom from God about who God is and who know their father and they can clearly say I and my father are one because I recognize Hallelujah who he is now once you are born inside or claimed to be born again inside the denominational system you have already entered into this spirit and atmosphere of woman worship and that is why you have these Idols that's why you have the emphasis on Mariola tree and a mother this and mother that and emphasis on that is because this kind of spirit around that that is what it emphasizes right to get that person to a woman worship to worship the woman or to worship the church the denomination that they're in and you know there's one thing when you come to that talk about anything else but if you want to get any real man really mad you go talking about this mother foreign sitting here get to talking about this mother and and his right will go up right yeah the hears on his on his head and his body will just rise up because that you don't touch a man's mother not by word not by deed not by thought nothing whatsoever that's the same spirit that comes on the people when you talk about the church are their Church they don't care if their mother is a harlot you talk against that Harlot it's my mother I don't care see and they're ready they don't realize what is motivating them is not the spirit of Christ they think it's the love for their mother but that is just a filio that is not uh God's love right because that's not Zoe and that moves them in that kind of a way whatsoever now listen see there will outnumber her by many times my but though they have more numbers they have no true father amen why because they had stopped by a machinery the Machinery of a system you know every Factory has their systems and you put the cookie dough just throw the dough in there and when you come to the end they pass through the whole process they come out here's beautiful cookies right it's the same thing happening in the churches they got this systems out there that well teach how to produce how to bring forth members how to do it by assess them that they have studied over years and it does work but there and they produce many many like that but we are not looking for many many though God can give many we are looking for that one that they have the life of God the seed of God within them The Germ of God to recognize the word of God for their day and for their hour hallelujah amen yes sir oh my praise God so Paul said I don't come with the Excellency of man's Wisdom and man's speech but I come in the power of the Holy Spirit and in demonstration amen hallelujah amen praise God so you see uh I'm just going to quote a note here that I wrote here while I was studying this that these intellectual means that they use of conveying the teachings of the Bible often will produce more memberships than a simple gospel preacher or teacher who's taught all dependence is upon God for without him God hallelujah that person knows they know nothing and they have nothing and it's only if God flows through them only if God speaks through them then they have something to offer to the bride because the bride doesn't want to listen to anything else oh my uh not that she won't hear other things but she really doesn't want to listen to anything else but to hear the voice of Our Lord coming true hallelujah oh praise God forevermore they know they have nothing to say it's God has to be able to say it by his word through that servant listen now the denominational kinds is represented here in Jude it right right to 13. and he calls them the secular Church that we have today clouds Without Rain we had a lot of that for this past week their predict rain for almost every dead week it's going to fall rain is going to fall all day the next day there's going to be a storm oh it's going to really be terrible and you know the clouds come up the winds begin to blow the skies get dark and you say to yourself oh my God I better get my stuff inside because it's going to rain oh my the next thing you know another win the doctrine blow and blow the clouds and the clouds gone and what happened the Sun comes out and begin to shine and and there's no rain whatsoever oh my friends that's exactly they're clouds Without Rain in other words they look good they're admirable they're fluffy and nice but they're they got no rain they got nothing to give you oh my listen brother Branham says and they're forming out their own shame see that Pentecostal church is represented out of the whole denominational group God has in second Timothy 3 18 that they are the ones having forms of godliness but denying the power thereof they have lots of forms of godliness but denying the power thereof and their seed will produce after its kind see we are produced members like that that will uh you know have a form of godliness but they will not come to the word right here he begins to speak now notice the eunuch we're getting into something deep here now notice the eunuch now let me let me just pause here because he doesn't you know he just mentions it and he goes on so let me say to you what this is really about he's talking about the relationship of the true Sons and Daughters of God and the true Servants of God having this unique position of being spiritual eunuchs to the word of God right this is what now he's talking about now watch you see for for the Sea church the real Church the Sea church the one with the real germ right that's the one notice again he said the eunuch oh Hallelujah he's talking about Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch and the eunuch had gone to all the places there in Jerusalem and none of them could give him answers to his question because there was something in him different to what they had and that Gene in him was thirsting for life and so uh brother Branham doesn't vocalize all of this but here he says he just jumps to the to this point notice the eunuch had been with all them DDS remember but I want you to see this now God never committed his preaching his gospel his word to any angel see oh my Galatians 1 8 if Paul said if any Angel come down from heaven and tell you anything different to what I am saying Paul said a man speaking of an Angel is saying let him be a curse Amen brother Bradham said notice the angel if is wrong if he is different from the word when God came down below if below Angels the level of angels he came down past the level of angels and went and committed this gospel to a man and man which was Sons see but he never committed it to Angels because what men are sons and daughters but angels are servants and Messengers Hallelujah but we are Sons and Daughters of the Living God aren't you glad for that Hallelujah and you know that uh in in certain cultures very important to have your own Sons and Daughters because they carry on after their kind bring forth the family line and and so on it goes on why but if you don't have that then it can't go on Amen so the the mule the denominational uh mechanical systems can't carry that life on the blood does not pass through there amen for the church is the blood of Christ through the holy spirit amen hallelujah oh my so you see men are Sons amen they are not servants praise God hallelujah amen I'm so glad that we are Sons and Daughters of the Living God it's marvelous to to think that one day you you die and when you go up there you find out you're an angel some people think that's great oh when a baby dies that's oh that angel took his flight right but it's not like that you're either an angel or your sons and daughters of God and the angels are Servants of God messengers of God but we are Sons and Daughters of God to do the will plan and purpose of the Living God hallelujah amen praise God Amen so you see now that that is great but Philip had been up to Pentecost and was there for worship and God used him to speak to that eunuch uh I pause here again now you'll find out that God works through spiritual eunuchs and this subject of course somebody can pick it up and expand it and grow it by going into the word but if you go to Esther 2 2 15 we're not going to go reading that now you know the story of Esther and you know how a eunuch is such a man that the Kings the Emperors the sheikhs the caliphs could give their whole harem to end their responsibility and not have to worry whether they have one wife or they got 300 wives they put them in the hands of that eunuch and why would they do that trusting a male a man uh to to have responsibility over all his wives and the reason why is because a eunuch has no seed he has nothing yeah he can't pass on anything and therefore he can be trusted oh my so God works true not natural eunuchs but spiritual eunuchs praise God hallelujah because they have no seed of their own you will find that the eunuch was called The Keeper of the women right the the king's Keeper of the women now back to Philip now notice the eunuch had been with all them DDS llds and everything else but why didn't he get something from them see and here he had to come back studying the prophecy of Isaiah because he got nothing from them oh my praise God he couldn't get anything from them you can see that clear because the sea doesn't go pass through them their life doesn't operate through them I'm talking about the real life not Natural Life everybody that's alive as that amen but the Life of Christ the life of God doesn't work through that amen see it's it doesn't work from Machinery it works through his sons and his daughters to bring him glory and honor and praise hallelujah oh my now watch we see here that this an angel had to direct Philip to him well he's trying to say is not here like that but it was not the angel that brought the word to the eunuch God could have easily sent the angel but it's not the angel that brought the word to the eulog see the angel directed Philip where to go amen and even as you know moved him into the desert there uh by Supernatural Transportation he was moved into the desert Hallelujah but you know you must understand that the germ of Life had to come through Christ's body Hallelujah later on he says and Philip was a part of that body and the life only goes through Christ's body Hallelujah that's why I can say I'm glad to say that I am one of them I don't know when he wants to use me for something uh else or something this or that whatever how simple or humble or great I don't know but I want to be ready whenever the Holy Spirit wants to do something through you through me through any one of us that he has vessels that he can use for his glory and for his honor spiritual eunuchs for the glory of God hallelujah amen glory to God hallelujah watch amen I tell you friends spiritual eunuchs the thoughts striking me here now uh uh carriers of the word of God Amen to be a spiritual carrier of the word of God knowing that the word can Flash true you are passed through you at any time any moment well you don't even have to think what you're going to say but the holy spirit will work through you for his glory and for his honor brother or brother we're on a line here oh where did that germ come from did it come through the angel no my goodness the angel showed him where to go an angel is a messenger but over here this one is a song praise God a son versus an angel if you were to put a mighty Angel standing here before you like that and you put a son standing over there or most people which one they're going to believe most of the time they want to believe the angel rather than a simple human being like themselves no sir but God says no that's not how it is the Angel is only a servant he can only come with a message telling that servant that son what to do and where to go but it's the servant that's the son that's going to carry the word it's the sun that's going to be the bearer of the world Hallelujah because the word seed can only pass through Christ's body and we are a part of that body so we are in line for the operations of the Holy Spirit and demonstrations of the Holy Spirit to work through us hallelujah that's not even what you think about yourself it's gone past that now it's not what you think about yourself what your heart thinks what your heart condemn you whatever but God by his Spirit working through his body for his honor and for his glory amen oh my see so let me repeat here now Philip hug the germ Hallelujah do you have a gene do I have a gene I believe I do I believe you do praise God Philip have the germ see he had the germ he had the message Hallelujah he had the word oh what how beautiful but let's not I'm just going to go over that quickly he had the message he had the word you see the flow of it we all got the message until you're breaking the Revelation then you got the word you know the word revealed the word unto you so this is what he's talking about here he says uh Philip God the message The Germ and because he had the germ the shout had to come to him and once the shout come to him the progression of it it ends up in him being able to see the word revealed before him amen praise God hallelujah oh my now see ah now that's the way that's how a child can be born Philip laid his hands upon him it was Philip that baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ and their comfort of birth there came forth the spirit of God upon him what he's saying there is it wasn't the angel that go and opened the word to the you knock it wasn't the angel that laid his hands upon him it wasn't the angel that baptized them in water in the name of Jesus Christ I wanted you to see the the power that the true church has I want you to recognize what power is in the true church but yet not because it's the church means the church itself is going to run around saying we're going to lay hands over here they're going to do that over there we're going to raise this dead over here but God working through his body to perform his will in his time for his glory amen it's just that that body is there that individual that elects sin that person with a Divine Purpose that was set here on the earth for this age this time so that God has some body to work through for his glory hallelujah amen praise God you're in a time you're in an age you're in a place all purpose by God before the foundation of the world you know you know every person every person that you meet God already plan and purpose and all of that do you know every situation you ever get in good or bad God already purpose know all about it every place that you go every scenery that you see all God purpose it and God knows all about it we have an awesome existent not existence not only us Mortals as humans but we are recognized in our position as sons and dust of God we have a off awesome existence here now with with Divine recognition upon us and recognizing the things that are happening around us for God's glory amen hallelujah see Philip baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ and there came forth the spirit of God upon Him of birth Hallelujah so it's sons and does of God can bring these people or these children to a birth remember brother Brandon repeats Remember The Germ has to come from the body what body Christ's body see and Philip was a member of that body Hallelujah and might not hear and being a member of that body he was subject to being used at any time by God because he was a part of that body Sam for URI don't just look at yourself oh I'm just a believer I just come to church and I serve God I sing I pray everything else like that no you are just as subject to the Holy Spirit as I am God may choose to use me more times and different ways then he will use you if you read your Bible you will see God will only sometimes he'll use one man of God one Prophet one servant once and you never hear of them again and you your job may even be done and you don't know it because he used you once and the rest of it you just using up your time until he calls you can use another one back and forth doing all kinds of thousands of this and that and the other yes but as I always repeat we all come back to the same pay at the end of the day one may have a little more Earthly Glory but all that can pass away is that right it's not Earthly Glory it's what God looks down there and he knows that you got like my father had when we were boys you have the Sheep he has the garden he got the chickens he got the Ducks he got the turkeys in this one this is the list here today you're gonna do this this this this is that right oh my the other of course you know I won't add that part but at the end of the day if you don't finish it then you will have a good talk with him a little talk with Jesus but the fact is that God knows exactly what every one of us our purpose here and what we have to do when we are here in this realm on this Earth for his glory and for his honor and he only has you and I as his hands his eyes his feet his ears his body is that right for him to flow true and to use for His Glory Hallelujah for The Germ has to come from the body and what body Christ's body and Philip was a member of that body I want you to see that this took same thing took place in Acts chapter 10 verse 48 you remember Peter was on the house stop praying amen everything has not changed from law yet to Grace because God was going to use Paul as the Apostle to change law to Grace now Allah over to Grace for them to recognize it but here it is he was in the house stop praying and uh God he saw all these unclean animals that according to the Old Testament they're not supposed to eat shrimp and rabbits and they're not supposed to eat cloven hoof goat and all this stuff you know they're not supposed to eat all those kinds of animals uh whatever and and while he was praying all of a sudden some men are knocking on his door and he's knocking on his door and they said well they came from this man called Cornelius and when we come here to um to for you to go and visit him because he wants to know more about this Jesus Christ and uh he he turned around the spitter that had told God that this is unclean Lord because the boy said rice Peter kill and eat kill and eat this is the very same thing over here you told us not to eat it now you're telling Michaela need it that the Bible contradict how can you do that but you see God revealed to him whatever I call clean it's clean whatever I say on in other words you're talking to God and if he says today this is a chair and tomorrow he said this is a throne it's a it's a throne it's whatever he says it is right but thank God God doesn't change anyway but the fact I'm just illustrating something there but the fact is God's word does not change now now notice where the Brandon says Oh my he says just talking about this I feel pretty good I I feel like traveling on oh my you see it's an angel come and said don't worry don't call nothing clean unclean just go on up don't think nothing just go right and then you see the the angel directed him right to Cornelius but the scripture says while Peter yet speak these words you see it was Peter that the word had to come true it's Peter The Germ had to flow through and while Peter yet speak these words notice the prophet says not the Angels speak in those words amen but the man Peter speaking those words oh my look look look at this look at this thought that maybe he was thinking that uh uh uh a angel that never sinned an angel that don't know about repentance don't no trouble don't no trials don't no griefs don't no sadness and and here is a man that sin that a man that was born in sin and shaped iniquity and have to be born again and God bypassed the angel and come to that man and use the man instead of an Angel we blessed brothers and sisters I said we are blessed Hallelujah that God would love a sinner such as I amen and change us in our whole lives in our whole walk and our sorrow changes as the song says into Bliss you see it is wild Peter yet spoke these words not the angel not no Cardinal not nothing else but while Peter was speaking these words Hallelujah why was that he was the body for that hour he was the body for that moment he was the body for that situation he was the body and under those circumstances you may be the body under a different circumstance you you may be the body that God can use and say lay your hands on that sick wall you may be the body that God will say pray pray pray for them amen you may be the body that God will say oh say to this one this or ask this person that or it might be something you're not even thinking about and before you know it you're saying this you're saying that or doing this because what you are part of that body and therefore you are subject to being used of God for his glory and for his honor amen he was the body and he had the word and that word took a hold oh brother the angel directed him but the life came through the body of Christ Hallelujah and the life always flows through the body of Christ amen praise God now notice also Paul and then I'm going to wind this up Paul on his way to Damascus a vision directed him see but ananias had to come for ananias had the germ he had the word for the word comes to the prophet let me say it in the words of a message we preached years ago the word always comes to the predestinated vessel because that's what it predestinator use in that age it has to come there oh my like Mary a virgin will conceive and bear a son God knows that words in the moment you know he knows the virtually remember you see so so where else is the word going to go where else is the Angel going to go where else is the holy spirit going to go to fulfill his word hallelujah it has to go to the body for that age to fulfill the word through that body oh praise God hallelujah and I'm glad to say I believe I'm a part of that body oh yes Paul ananias had the word amen and he had a vision saying go up and lay your hands on him and he said brother Saul the Lord appeared to you on the road and told him what happened amen praise God how did he know because he had the word amen that's how he knew he had the word oh my see oh my the word of the Lord come to the prophet he come and sent me here that I might lay my hands upon you that you'd be healed and receive your sight Hallelujah and the scales fell off his eyes he rose up was baptized in the name of Jesus and went to studying Angels directed it but you see then ananias had the germ is that right then he wanted to go on to Paul but he ended it around that thought somewhere around here he said you see Paul had all the studying and everything else but now Paul had the seed germ and you know all them Epistles the rest of it you see the effects of him recognizing who he was what was in him amen and he starts saying all these things about the power that worketh within us amen you're talking about God in us talks about the quickening power quickening us from the dead Hallelujah we thank God for brother Paul amen you see he says because it takes only the spirit of God moving on the seed to give life eternal praise God only the spirit of God moving on the seed in a person's heart can bring them to recognize that they are a part of that eternal life that we all call God we are a part of him Hallelujah revealed here on the Earth and God needs spiritual eunuchs do you believe that may God help each one of us to be faithful and true to be humble and to be surrendered so that he can use us as spiritual eunuchs that will not contaminate the word dislocate misinformed the but the word but we will always keep our hands off spiritually speaking and let the Holy Spirit have his way amen so that we can always be useful in the Kingdom of the Living God God bless you tonight I trust that you have got something here that can shine light upon your fruitful life and ripen unsweeten it and prepare you uh for that day when we are all called away praise the Lord Heavenly Father we thank you for the word that we have
