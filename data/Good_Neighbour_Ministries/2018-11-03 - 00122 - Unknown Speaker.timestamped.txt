[6:28] music a brother/sister the real
[6:39] fellowship comes around the mystery the
[6:43] revelation of the word of God as Isaiah
[6:46] prophesied in that day the Watchmen on
[6:49] the walls desire to see I they will have
[6:53] to put it on or make it up because it

[6:57] help when you
[6:59] you're describing it when I'm describing
[7:01] if you can't describe two things you to
[7:03] describe the same thing and we love to
[7:05] stand each other clearly because it's
[7:08] not quite magical spending it's by
[7:11] revelation of the word of God how the
[7:14] new drapes the name of the Lord Amen or
[7:21] up to the power and oh that's for the
[7:25] scene everybody was partying and you
[7:31] know very clearly and then you get
[7:44] baptized and walk through the name of
[7:45] the Lord Jesus in the sea we all gave
[7:54] you the prophets message right then

[8:02] same spiritual brother Brendan simply
[8:11] understand
[8:12] he said devil he says some believers
[8:16] some people can eat as much as they want
[8:18] and the other one just eat you know
[8:23] regularly the work and the growing in
[8:25] Christ he says about how even if you
[8:28] feed a cup nearly all the vitamins it's
[8:33] still gonna remain a cup there can't be
[8:36] anything else but if you see them evil
[8:39] that evil is going to be an eagle but
[8:42] the canary will remain canary because
[8:44] that's what's supposed to be so when you
[8:49] sell off babies gonna help later on
