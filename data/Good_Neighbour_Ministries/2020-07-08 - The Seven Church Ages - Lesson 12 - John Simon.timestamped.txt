[0:05] [Music]
[0:18] good evening friends
[0:21] once again we are gathered together for
[0:24] a marvelous and wonderful Bible study as
[0:29] I teach on the Word of God and made a
[0:31] great holy spirit anoint the Word of God
[0:34] to our the heirs of our hearts and to
[0:40] the eyes of our understanding let us
[0:44] pray our gracious God and Heavenly
[0:48] Father we ask thy blessing upon this
[0:52] life word today made a great Holy Spirit
[0:56] take praise honor and glory in the name
[1:02] of Jesus Christ our Lord amen and amen
[1:08] as we said before our subject tonight
[1:13] will be the believers rest and my aim is
[1:22] to show you that there is no rest there
[1:26] is no peace until our satisfaction until
[1:31] we come to a place a condition a zone in
[1:38] which we live in continuous inner rest
[1:44] inner wrist may God bless our hearts
[1:49] today as we sink upon these things now
[1:55] first of all we find that there are
[2:00] wonderful brothers and sisters in Christ
[2:05] that call the Lord's Day the Sabbath day
[2:10] or Saturday
[2:13] they believe it's Saturday then there
[2:18] are other wonderful justice wonderful
[2:21] wonderful fine folks that will call
[2:25] Sunday the Lord's Day the first day of
[2:31] the week now we understood stand it
[2:36] could not be either one of these days or
[2:41] even if we were to put those two days
[2:43] together Saturday and Sunday they still
[2:48] will not be really and truly the lord's
[2:54] day for we know that John was in the
[2:58] spirit and he was in the spirit over a
[3:02] period of about receiving visions over a
[3:06] period of about two years ninety five
[3:12] eighty to ninety six eighty and actually
[3:18] what happened is that John was caught up
[3:22] in the spirit he was transported by the
[3:30] Holy Spirit transported into the future
[3:34] by the Holy Spirit God's time capsule or
[3:40] like Captain Kirk was beamed up God
[3:45] beamed him or transported him
[3:50] spiritually into the future so that he
[3:56] could come back and John write these
[4:01] things in a book and so John was able to
[4:05] write his visions his experiences while
[4:08] he was caught up in the spirit of God
[4:12] and transported into a future day the
[4:18] lord's day that is in the future because
[4:22] we know the Bible tells us that the
[4:25] Lord's Day is coming God's Day is coming
[4:30] and John is seeing those things of that
[4:36] future date meanwhile we are here now in
[4:42] some of that future that John was
[4:46] speaking about and the question is that
[4:51] we want to find out exactly what is the
[4:54] Sabbath day today what is it today
[5:00] when we know that the Sabbath from the
[5:04] New Testament is not the keeping of a
[5:08] certain day let me repeat we know from
[5:12] the New Testament and the teachings of
[5:15] the Apostles that the Sabbath day is not
[5:21] a certain date now in the book of
[5:25] Hebrews chapter 4 verses 8 9 and 10
[5:32] let's read from verse 9 there remaineth
[5:37] therefore I rest for the people of God
[5:42] for he that is entered into his rest he
[5:49] also has ceased from his old works as
[5:53] God did from his may God help us to
[5:59] cease from our fleshly Whirley works and
[6:05] our human efforts and to learn how to
[6:10] rest in the blessed holy spirit who has
[6:14] come to lead us to guide us to
[6:17] straightness encourages comfort us and
[6:20] to take us all the way from Earth to
[6:24] glory rest upon him back there they had
[6:28] the pillar of fire they could see with
[6:30] their eyes but now he talked also told
[6:34] us clearly that he will go away
[6:37] what book return in the
[6:39] farm of the Blessed Holy Spirit our eyes
[6:42] may not be able to see him but we love
[6:45] him with our hearts and he promised even
[6:48] though you would see me I'll be with you
[6:51] even in you to the very end of the age
[6:55] so here we are friends Hebrew Hebrews
[6:59] tells us clearly that the this rest when
[7:06] one enters into this rest he ceases from
[7:10] his Labor's now the key phrase there is
[7:16] God ceased from his own works
[7:21] no God gave Israel the nation of Israel
[7:25] this seven-day for their Sabbath or
[7:31] Saturday if we want to call it that God
[7:34] gave Israel the seventh day as their
[7:39] seventh now and that was in
[7:43] commemoration for them to remember or as
[7:48] a memorial that he created the world
[7:53] over that period of time and that he
[7:58] rested from his own works and if he
[8:04] rested then they ought to rest now we
[8:09] know clearly friends that this Sabbath
[8:12] day was given to Israel as a memorial to
[8:18] commemorate God's work it was not given
[8:21] to the Gentiles as a commemoration of
[8:25] his works but it was given unto the
[8:29] Jewish brethren as a memorial to God and
[8:35] His great works of creation now we find
[8:41] friends that when God had finished
[8:43] creating when he has cease from his
[8:48] labors then he rested and
[8:52] it was fine to give a day as of rest to
[8:58] his people in Memorial of that for at
[9:02] that time the people in number were few
[9:06] in the world and they had to they were
[9:11] in one place one area one timezone and
[9:17] so God could designate to Israel one day
[9:23] as a day of rest but of course with
[9:27] natural argumentation we understand that
[9:31] the world is now many many time zones
[9:34] and when it's that Saturday or the
[9:36] Sabbath day or whatever on a certain
[9:40] part of the world then it's not in
[9:43] several other parts and that will create
[9:46] a form of confusion but that's just
[9:48] normal natural argument but what does
[9:52] the Bible say about it the Bible tells
[9:56] us that he that is entered into his rest
[10:01] he who was entered into his rest or the
[10:06] rest that Jesus Christ gives it's not a
[10:10] date but it is an eternal rest in which
[10:14] God is giving us an eternal Sabbath in
[10:18] other words we understand that the
[10:21] seventh day is but a type of the eternal
[10:27] Sabbath for sin with my friends is a
[10:30] number of completion it is the number of
[10:36] a new beginning so 7 or Saturday or the
[10:43] Sabbath day that was given to the Jews
[10:46] is a symbol of completion it a type of
[10:53] Sunday type of the resurrection is a
[10:57] symbol of a new week a new beginning
[11:02] it's a new beginning so but
[11:06] days have their significance in the
[11:10] natural no so we see God could not give
[11:14] us any certain one day in a natural week
[11:19] as a day of rest but when we remain
[11:24] until you come into his rest we enter
[11:28] that rest we remain in that rest now
[11:31] Israel of course that work were able to
[11:35] enter into but could not remain in that
[11:38] rest because that day will be passive if
[11:41] it's one day that they will be pass and
[11:44] then they go back into restlessness and
[11:46] they have to wait for another week and
[11:48] then they go back into arrest and then
[11:51] they go back into restlessness because
[11:53] that was a one day affair they had back
[11:59] there but Jesus is saying that he who
[12:03] has the Bible is saying who he who
[12:05] enters into this rest has ceased from
[12:09] his labors he would ever have to go back
[12:13] out and be restless a wandering soul a
[12:18] tryst would on the tides of time but one
[12:22] was entered into the rest of the Living
[12:25] God and there he has entered as the Sun
[12:29] rises I have entered the Amen of rest I
[12:33] sailed a white seas no more for Jesus is
[12:38] a rest may God help every one of us
[12:41] today to enter into God's eternal rest
[12:44] and to rest in his love his care praise
[12:48] God hallelujah amen no we don't want to
[12:53] go backwards for that seven-day that was
[12:59] given to Israel was a shadow a type a
[13:04] pre figure of the substance reality that
[13:10] was to come but I'm afraid that many of
[13:14] my beloved brethren are crying
[13:17] and went backwards they went back and
[13:21] holding on to the shadow they're holding
[13:24] on to the substitute instead of reaching
[13:28] out and taking a hold of the reality of
[13:32] the substance of the manifestation of
[13:36] the Word of God and the application of
[13:39] the truth of the word of God to our day
[13:43] and to our age and time that God hath
[13:48] given unto us now what a blessed singing
[13:52] this my beloved brethren for us to be
[13:55] like this great Apostle John who the
[13:58] Bible said God the Lord Jesus loved John
[14:03] the Apostle and about two or three times
[14:06] we read in the Gospels he who Jesus
[14:10] loved John he who Jesus loved and one
[14:15] time it says and that disciple that lay
[14:19] upon Jesus bosom whose name was John or
[14:24] what a place for everyone to come and
[14:27] enter into this believers rest where we
[14:31] can rest our case or problem rester
[14:35] situation rest their trials rest our
[14:39] Technic lights our mental anguish our
[14:43] pain or depression or oppression if we
[14:46] can enter into that rest and rest our
[14:49] heads upon Jesus breast or bosom not
[14:53] that presence bosom but rest in Jesus
[14:56] bosom rest in his care rest in the
[15:00] shadow of this great wings let him watch
[15:04] over us I will not leave you comfortless
[15:07] he said but I'll be with you I'll be
[15:11] even in you to the very end of the age
[15:14] and in that day they will know that I
[15:18] and the father are one and that I am in
[15:23] you
[15:24] you and me and together we are one amen
[15:29] the oneness of God in His people how
[15:32] blessed how wonderful to know that as
[15:36] the tea cup of water from the ocean has
[15:40] the same properties as the water in the
[15:43] ocean itself praise God we may be human
[15:46] but the soul that is in us never dies
[15:50] and is apart from the great oceans of
[15:53] God and we come from God like the tides
[15:56] of the sea and we got back to contour
[15:59] original position how happy we should be
[16:03] brother sister that we can come for a
[16:06] place of rest and Christ and know that
[16:10] we are one in him this would be the name
[16:13] of the Lord amen so we know friends it
[16:18] is not the keeping of any day not
[16:22] Saturday nor Sunday and no matter I want
[16:26] to tell you this is an eternal rest for
[16:30] the rest my friends is that blessed Holy
[16:33] Spirit of God's Sabbath within your soul
[16:39] let me say to you it doesn't matter how
[16:42] long you have been laboring under your
[16:44] habits under your sin under your problem
[16:48] under your situation whether it is 10
[16:52] years 30 years 50 years or even longer
[16:56] Jesus is saying come come you weary cut
[17:01] all of you that are troubled thus that
[17:04] those are the scarred those are the pros
[17:08] he's saying come and I will give you
[17:11] life I will give you rest if you come to
[17:15] me you will find rest Jesus said in the
[17:18] Gospels rest for your soul you will find
[17:23] rest in him the true Sabbath in other
[17:27] words is he himself for he said I will
[17:31] give you rest
[17:33] Jesus
[17:34] you is your rest Christ in you your hope
[17:39] of glory that is your rest know you'll
[17:42] see the meat brothers brother Simon what
[17:45] is that rest that Jesus will give what
[17:49] is that rest now in Isaiah 28 8 to 12
[17:53] please listen
[17:55] excuse me we find that in the Word of
[17:59] God that he said here in Isaiah the
[18:02] tables are full of vomit even some of
[18:06] the groups the churches are all messed
[18:09] up in other words and sometimes even in
[18:13] the building even in the community
[18:16] called the church a person may not be
[18:20] able to find rest there no clean place
[18:24] whom shall I teach knowledge whom shall
[18:28] be he made to understand the doctrine
[18:31] then other wind from milk and drawn away
[18:36] from breasts for precept must be upon
[18:39] precept line upon line here a little
[18:43] they were written for mr. manleigh and
[18:47] with another term will I speak to his
[18:49] people to whom I said this is the rest
[18:54] this is the Sabbath where would you make
[18:57] caused the people to rest or keep the
[19:01] truth Sabbath this is the refreshing yet
[19:05] they will not hear that would understand
[19:08] so here it is prophesied in Isaiah that
[19:11] the Holy Spirit coming into a life
[19:15] refreshing it invigorating it anointing
[19:19] it bring you to a big place of peace and
[19:22] a place of rest that he is the risk in
[19:27] our souls the true Sabbath of course is
[19:31] the person of Jesus Christ now in the
[19:35] form of the Holy Spirit God residing and
[19:40] resting within the human soul praise God
[19:45] for the Bible tells us
[19:47] chapter 2 McMahon when they were filled
[19:51] with the Holy Ghost the Apostles cease
[19:55] from their worldly works this cease from
[19:58] their worldly doings this cease from any
[20:02] evil ways that they had and the Holy
[20:06] Ghost took charge her their lives and
[20:09] they became the sports and I am a
[20:12] prisoner of Jesus Christ because Herod
[20:15] ills that they surrendered their lines
[20:19] to him they rested in him and he did the
[20:24] acts are the works through them praise
[20:28] God hallelujah they entered into his
[20:32] rest there is the rest according to the
[20:35] Word of God there is the rest you need
[20:38] and I need according to this Bible that
[20:41] is the Sabbath we should put our faith
[20:44] and trust in Jesus Christ himself it's
[20:47] not a spirit of the Living God amen
[20:58] it is you ceasing from your works your
[21:02] fleshly endeavors and to rest in the
[21:06] achievements and the overcoming of Jesus
[21:11] Christ himself and what God is doing and
[21:15] willing and acting and working through
[21:19] you for it is god that's working in you
[21:23] to do of his good pleasure and of his
[21:26] good will praise be to God hallelujah
[21:29] amen praise God now we understand that
[21:34] persons who worship on Saturday
[21:37] my friends claim that we meet on the
[21:41] wrong day of the week which is Sunday
[21:44] they believe that that's the wrong day
[21:47] of the week and that they are worshiping
[21:49] in the right day of the week now I'm not
[21:51] saying anything against anyone that
[21:54] wants the wash of God on Saturday that's
[21:57] you can wash it bottom anything
[21:59] that you wish to worship him but don't
[22:03] impress on anyone that Saturday is that
[22:06] day of rest and is the rest of God for
[22:10] it is not the rest is the Holy Spirit of
[22:14] the Living God and we want to rest on
[22:17] that the Saturday is not the rest spoken
[22:20] off we find that that Justin Martyr in
[22:24] the second century said on Sunday a
[22:27] meeting is held that they repeat he said
[22:31] on Sunday a meeting is held of all who
[22:36] live in the cities villages we read the
[22:40] memoirs of the Apostles and their
[22:42] writings as long as time permits when
[22:47] the reading is finished an exhortation
[22:49] is given to imitate those noble things
[22:53] after this we authorize and offer
[22:57] common prayer in the presence of God
[23:00] then the congregation says Amen after
[23:04] this the elements of distributed bread
[23:07] and the wine we partake of that and then
[23:11] those that are upset the Deacons go to
[23:14] their homes and serve them that Lord's
[23:17] Supper and the wealthy then give gifts
[23:20] every one of us we receive a collection
[23:24] freewill and it's deposited later
[23:27] distributed to orphans widows prisoners
[23:31] and strangers and those that are in need
[23:34] praise God so we see even in the
[23:37] Apostles past aaalac times or even
[23:40] slightly after the Apostles they did not
[23:44] keep the Jewish or Judaic tradition of
[23:48] assembling on the last day of the week
[23:52] but instead they were meeting on the
[23:57] first day of the week and it's not that
[23:59] they were grossly ignorant because there
[24:02] were many many of them most of them were
[24:05] mainly Jews they were not ignorant they
[24:08] were well aware but they recognized
[24:10] there was a
[24:11] from law to grace there was a change
[24:14] that we are not on the law but we are
[24:17] under grace that was to the Jews now
[24:20] this in our day is to the Gentiles
[24:23] neither Saturday nor Sunday but to enter
[24:28] into the rest by being in filled by the
[24:32] Blessed Holy Spirit who comes to rest as
[24:36] the dove of peace within our souls and
[24:39] we in turn rest in him our peace
[24:43] hallelujah for years our peace and he
[24:47] has broken down every wall praise God
[24:50] hallelujah
[24:51] every wall between us and God he is
[24:55] broken on every wall and giving us rest
[24:58] and peace within our souls oh that
[25:02] person's may come or that you may come
[25:06] to him my friend and find rest in him
[25:10] for there is a thirst there is a craving
[25:13] within the hearts of men but the
[25:16] majority my friends don't know the
[25:20] answer and so to steal their conscience
[25:24] to suppress their hunger they they and
[25:31] their hearts that is trying out for the
[25:34] conscience is speaking to them and
[25:36] crying out and they want to death that
[25:39] they want to dull the cry their hearts
[25:43] cry and the crave their soul so they
[25:46] give up my friends go into drinking they
[25:51] going to smoking they're going to
[25:53] carouse and partying busying themselves
[25:56] with business running to and fro and all
[25:59] of this activity is trying to shake off
[26:04] the voice of their conscience that's so
[26:07] let's speaking to them and telling them
[26:09] to to cease their human labor and find a
[26:13] place of rest in Jesus Christ all my
[26:17] friends they grew up there and tried to
[26:21] engage
[26:22] physical excess of sensuality
[26:26] promiscuity lying stealing backbiting
[26:30] and such things and ends up there is not
[26:34] in arrest there is no rest there is no
[26:38] peace until you let the Lord Jesus
[26:41] Christ come in and give you his glorious
[26:45] remedy the remedy is not smoking the
[26:49] remedy is not pills
[26:52] sleeping pills the remedy is not drugs
[26:56] it's none of those things their remedy
[27:00] with is given to you by the great
[27:03] physician Jesus Christ himself who said
[27:07] the Scriptures are there is a balm in
[27:10] Gilead that makes the woman spirit all
[27:13] jesus said come unto me all ye that
[27:16] labor and are heavy laden and I will
[27:20] give you rest
[27:22] would you come to him now and let him
[27:25] give you rest and peace within your
[27:29] souls there is no rest from earthly
[27:33] pills or potions or or any medicines or
[27:37] capsule loser or vitamins my friends the
[27:40] rest comes from Jesus Christ and Christ
[27:44] alone what the world needs today above
[27:47] all else is Jesus Christ hallelujah they
[27:51] need God's heavenly remedy of the rest
[27:55] of the Holy Spirit all glory be to God
[27:59] very friends then we find the other
[28:02] group that insists you must go to church
[28:05] on Sunday one group in systems go on
[28:09] Saturday the seventh day one insist you
[28:12] must go on Sunday you know the day or
[28:17] the first day again of the week see but
[28:22] Jesus said me neither
[28:24] they don't know how to approach God
[28:26] because the real approach to God is not
[28:29] here it's not
[28:31] it's not on this day it's not on that
[28:34] day but the rest is in Christ hallelujah
[28:39] the true worship is the worship God
[28:42] we're in spirit and in truth
[28:47] hallelujah oh praise God John 4:24
[28:51] friends tells us get that kind of
[28:54] worship you only find it in Jesus Christ
[28:58] hallelujah amen oh praise God how can
[29:02] you find rest someone to a church how
[29:06] could you find rest just in the church
[29:08] not to say the church is a is an aid the
[29:12] church is a community that can give you
[29:16] spiritual comfort and social support a
[29:22] social blanket a community of faith but
[29:26] friends the kind of church I'm talking
[29:29] about how can you find rest and peace in
[29:32] a church that will tell you you know God
[29:40] allows them to put up Santa Claus in the
[29:44] church God allows them to put up
[29:47] Tenenbaum the Christmas trees in the
[29:51] church God allows them at Easter to have
[29:55] bunnies and eggs in the church how can
[29:58] you find peace in the place like that it
[30:01] is not in the Bible it is not found
[30:06] within the Word of God that is painted
[30:09] worship that is speaking teaching it
[30:12] comes from the paganism and Christianity
[30:15] as
[30:17] paganism into Christianity or paganism
[30:21] has blended itself to deceive within the
[30:26] ranks of Christianity and many have find
[30:30] themselves entangled in its veins come
[30:34] out of her my people and be not
[30:37] partakers of her sins
[30:40] leave that harlot and come to the one
[30:44] grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[30:46] Christ when one turns to the Lord one
[30:50] can find my friends the infilling of the
[30:54] Holy Spirit and then you can cease from
[30:58] your officially working up yourself
[31:01] struggling striving being tossed about
[31:04] not knowing what life is about not
[31:07] finding any purpose then when you come
[31:10] to him you'll find rest in your soul
[31:12] find your real purpose you'll really
[31:16] begin to live and to love God and to
[31:19] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[31:23] now let us recap briefly my friends
[31:26] let's get back here and see what God's
[31:29] Word says we know then in our final
[31:33] conclusion here that the Lord's Day is
[31:37] not Saturday nor is the Lord's Day
[31:43] Sunday you say well what is it my
[31:48] friends today is not the lord's day it's
[31:53] not the Lord's age we are now living in
[31:57] the age of man or the time of man or or
[32:02] man's day or the day where men controls
[32:06] on the earth everything it's a day of
[32:11] man's works man science men trying to
[32:15] achieve men trying to build another
[32:19] Tower of Babel again man's doing this
[32:23] man's working man's church not God's
[32:27] church but it's man building up their
[32:33] vision their idea of what God's church
[32:37] should look like instead of going back
[32:40] to acts 2 and seeing God's original
[32:44] blueprint and pattern and build on work
[32:48] according to God's commands and God's
[32:51] blueprint that he has laid
[32:54] in his word Oh blessed be his name but
[32:57] God's blueprint breath since strange to
[33:00] men today it doesn't seem so ordered
[33:03] systematic theologies and systematize
[33:07] they say they don't see it that way they
[33:10] have to have what they think is his
[33:13] proper administration's orders and
[33:16] things all lined up like that and I love
[33:19] themselves to be clearly being able to
[33:22] attract TRACON and being able to be
[33:25] anticipated their every action by no by
[33:27] Satan when the Bible says the sons and
[33:31] daughters of God are led by the Spirit
[33:33] of God and the wind blows where it lists
[33:36] and no man need those miracles it seems
[33:40] as if there is no order in the way the
[33:42] wind moves or the Holy Spirit moves but
[33:45] God knows his own doings and his own
[33:49] ways and his own orders as the scripture
[33:53] of the songwriter said our God moves in
[33:56] a mysterious way his wonders to perform
[33:59] he plans his footsteps on the sea and he
[34:03] rides upon the storm oh what a blessing
[34:06] blessing what a complaining God we serve
[34:10] something no it's a day of man's ideas
[34:14] about everything
[34:15] man's works man's everything man's idea
[34:19] of how we should worship God when God
[34:23] has plainly given us in his work no
[34:26] matter how beautiful your worship how
[34:28] wonderful it sounds if you're not in the
[34:32] spirit it's a Kanis watch it though can
[34:35] had every beautiful thing on that altar
[34:37] Cain was religious he was crying of all
[34:41] God God of course is an object of
[34:44] worship that's not the name of anybody
[34:46] but it will have a revelation and you
[34:49] who he watch it let's come back to the
[34:52] Word of God and never recognition and a
[34:55] revelation of who we truly worship may
[34:59] God help every
[35:00] one of us today but thank God when men's
[35:02] Day is over that day the Lord is coming
[35:06] I said gods day is coming that's the
[35:10] great day of the Lord when man's day is

[35:33] our God and when the day of the Lord
[35:35] comes then judgments will begin to fall

[35:42] judgment my friends then we will enter
