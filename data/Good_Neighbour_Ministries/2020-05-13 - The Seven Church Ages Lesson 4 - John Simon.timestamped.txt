[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] good evening dear friends it's good to
[0:17] be here again may the Lord bless you
[0:21] real good
[0:23] let us pray our gracious God our
[0:27] Heavenly Father we ask thy blessing upon
[0:31] this broadcast tonight bless each one
[0:36] that is tuned in and made a great Holy
[0:40] Spirit descend upon the word and give us
[0:46] a clear understanding father we pray
[0:50] this and we believe this and we trust in
[0:54] your your wonderful great presence in
[0:59] Jesus name Amen and amen I'm reading
[1:05] tonight from the book of Revelation
[1:09] chapter 1 verse 4 to 6 and my subject is
[1:19] the salutation or greeting John to the
[1:26] seven churches which are in Asia grace
[1:31] be unto you and peace from him which is
[1:35] which was and which is to come and from
[1:40] the seven spirits which are before his
[1:45] throne and from Jesus Christ who is the
[1:49] faithful witness and the first begotten
[1:53] of the Dead and the Prince of the kings
[1:58] of the earth unto him that loved us and
[2:02] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[2:07] and had made us kings and priests unto
[2:11] God and his father to him be glory and O
[2:17] Union forever and ever amen
[2:22] praise God the Sanitation now to the
[2:30] seven churches which are in Asia this
[2:34] does not mean all of Asia but this spoke
[2:40] of Asia Minor
[2:42] it spoke particularly of Asia Minor and
[2:47] actually Asia Minor is is about the size
[2:53] of the state of Indiana and these seven
[3:01] churches were identified by God because
[3:08] of their individual characteristics
[3:12] every church has its own character its
[3:16] own church life and because of this
[3:22] difference in nature God had chosen
[3:27] these seven churches so as to be a
[3:31] picture of the seven ages that were to
[3:38] come and that the character of each
[3:43] Church describes and gives us a
[3:48] foreshadow of what the character and
[3:52] nature of these seven ages were going to
[3:57] be now the seven spirits John speaks off
[4:04] hair in the Bible they represent seven
[4:10] portions of the Holy Spirit Himself that
[4:15] will rest upon seven men seven
[4:21] messengers each one to a church age and
[4:28] the Spirit
[4:30] that portion of the Spirit of God that
[4:34] would be with them and working through
[4:38] them will provide the wisdom power
[4:44] texture and character for their entire
[4:50] ministries suited to the age in which
[4:55] they live now as we read further in this
[5:02] text it says grace beyond to you and
[5:10] peace from him which was him which was
[5:18] amen him which is to come and from the
[5:24] seven spirits of God now listen to these
[5:27] expressions again him which is him which
[5:33] was and he that is to come the faithful
[5:41] witness the firstborn from among the
[5:45] dead Prince of the kings of the earth
[5:52] the Alpha and Omega they are mighty
[6:00] these are all titles and descriptions of
[6:06] one and the same person who is none
[6:11] other than the Lord Jesus Christ Himself
[6:18] did he's the one that washed us and
[6:22] cleansed us in his own blood
[6:26] thanks be to God for the washing and
[6:29] cleansing of the blood of the Lord Jesus
[6:33] Christ now the Spirit of God is as
[6:37] setting forth that first in order to
[6:44] point us to the supreme deity of the
[6:49] person of Jesus Christ and reveal to us
[6:56] the Godhead as being one God now we know
[7:04] today there is a gross error in the land
[7:09] the gross error of the doctrine of the
[7:14] Trinity and their teaching is that there
[7:22] were three gods instead of one but this
[7:27] revelation was given to John by the Lord
[7:33] Jesus Christ himself to establish
[7:39] without any shadow of doubt of who was
[7:44] speaking and also to give us a clear
[7:50] revelation of the Godhead it is Jesus
[7:56] all it is Jesus himself who corrects the
[8:00] error it is not that there are three
[8:04] gods my friends but one God with three
[8:08] offices there is one God with three
[8:13] titles Father Son and Holy Ghost now
[8:21] this mighty revelation is what the early
[8:24] church had and it gave them prevailing
[8:29] power under the jurisdiction the
[8:33] leadership the guidance of the Holy
[8:36] Spirit as he took them into the truth of
[8:40] the word of God and then vindicated that
[8:44] truth thanks be to God
[8:47] this is what he did and so we win
[8:51] need a restoration of this mighty
[8:57] revelation that God gave to these
[9:00] apostles that this person this one that
[9:05] they had walked with with all those
[9:07] years was not just on anybody but he was
[9:13] him which was which is which is to come
[9:16] the Lord God Almighty and his name is
[9:21] none other than the Lord Jesus Christ
[9:25] also along with the name of Jesus they
[9:32] we need to have the restoration of the
[9:36] correct formula for the baptism in water
[9:40] or water baptism we need to correct the
[9:45] correct formula the correct means of
[9:48] doing it according to this Bible no I
[9:53] know that modern teachers modern
[9:58] theologians seminarians they will not
[10:04] agree with what I'm saying here
[10:07] certainly not but here is what was
[10:11] written in a certain Christians magazine
[10:14] from which I quote that the teaching on
[10:19] the Trinity is at the very heart and
[10:24] core of the Old Testament it is every
[10:28] width as much at the heart and core of
[10:33] the New Testament the New Testament is
[10:38] just as much opposed as the Old
[10:42] Testament is to the thought that there
[10:46] are more gods than one yet the New
[10:52] Testament with equal clearness teaches
[10:57] us that the father is God
[10:59] this son is God and that the Holy See
[11:04] it is God and the three are not three
[11:13] aspects of the same person but three
[11:18] persons let me repeat that again not
[11:23] three aspects of the same person but
[11:27] three persons standing in truly a truly
[11:34] personal relationship one to another and
[11:39] there we have the great doctrine of the
[11:43] three persons but one God it further
[11:48] states God according to the Bible is not
[11:54] just one person but he is three persons
[12:01] in one God that is the great mystery of
[12:07] the Trinity and may say it surely is how
[12:13] can three persons being one God not only
[12:19] is there no scripture no Bible anywhere
[12:24] for that but it even displays a lack of
[12:30] proper and intelligent reasoning three
[12:35] persons though identical in substance
[12:41] Homo Swiss of one substance Greek three
[12:51] persons different from each other yet
[12:55] one God that if that don't make three
[13:01] God's language has lost its meaning
[13:06] entirely in the light of what I've just
[13:10] coated I want you to listen not to my
[13:15] words but
[13:16] so this picture as I go over it again
[13:22] Jesus Christ get this revelation to John
[13:26] and he is speaking this is the Lord
[13:29] Himself speaking to John and telling
[13:33] John who he was I am Alpha and Omega the
[13:43] beginning and the end said the Lord
[13:50] which is which was and which is to come
[13:57] the Almighty this is Jesus speaking this
[14:03] is the mighty God in Christ speaking
[14:07] that he is Alpha Omega the beginning and
[14:11] the end I am the Lord God Almighty this
[14:17] is the voice of God Jesus Christ
[14:19] speaking only believe all things are
[14:23] possible yes sir I tell you this is
[14:28] nothing less than deity speaking this
[14:33] was not Jesus Christ was not just a man
[14:37] Jesus Christ was not just a holy prophet
[14:43] he was God their one God they are mighty
[14:48] God that formed himself were placed
[14:51] himself in flesh but for that day and
[14:55] for all time this is not just not a man
[14:59] that was speaking but it was God that
[15:02] was speaking and declaring himself
[15:04] through the man Christ Jesus it is not
[15:09] of course a revelation of three gods but
[15:16] it is a revelation of one God the
[15:20] Almighty God making himself known now
[15:25] for your inspiration
[15:29] they never believed in three gods in the
[15:34] time of the Vedic beginning of the
[15:37] church we cannot find anywhere in the
[15:43] scripture that form of belief in the
[15:49] Word of God we cannot find that kind of
[15:54] a belief among all the Apostles from
[15:58] Peter to Paul to John to Polycarp and
[16:03] those who just left the scene none of
[16:06] them believed in such a thing whatsoever
[16:12] now it was after their past Alec age
[16:17] that this theory of the Trinity came
[16:21] into being and became an issue at the
[16:29] council the Nicene Council I believe it
[16:34] was 325 AD it was this doctrine of the
[16:42] Trinity became an issue and created a
[16:48] split in the church at that particular
[16:52] time because the split went to extremes
[16:57] one God or three gods and so there
[17:03] became a split and the side that
[17:07] believed or those that believed in three
[17:10] gods their prevailed and that was handed
[17:16] down as the preeminent doctrine and was
[17:21] propagated propagated and pressed upon
[17:25] people brought in by those dark ages I
[17:29] spoke of some time ago and so that
[17:33] doctrine prevailed even to this very day
[17:37] and it prevailed even am
[17:41] the Protestants to this very day but our
[17:46] God the truth church is marching on here
[17:50] o Israel the Lord thy God is one Lord in
[17:55] the book of the Old Testament and their
[17:58] God said he was one God and God has
[18:03] never changed his mind about his word
[18:06] about his person his personality of who
[18:11] he is now
[18:13] so this doctrine caused a split first of
[18:16] all it caused the division this doctrine
[18:19] did certainly that in one side the side
[18:24] that believed in three gods went you
[18:29] know they adopted a system of polytheism
[18:34] which means many gods believe in many
[18:39] gods but yet those many gods become one
[18:44] God and they move from believing in many
[18:49] thoughts because we remember we're not
[18:51] talking about the time when it was in
[18:55] the days of pagan Rome let me
[18:58] differentiate pagan Rome under all those
[19:03] different emperors right on down to
[19:06] constant time who was the one that
[19:09] brought this Nicean Council together to
[19:14] settle the argument between the these
[19:19] two groups in his empire and so we know
[19:24] that this caused a split in the early
[19:28] church after that these apostles had
[19:33] left the scene and one side move from
[19:38] their original place when it was pagan
[19:43] Rome believing in many gods polytheism
[19:48] and compromise by moving to a position
[19:54] where they began to believe or set they
[19:57] began to believe in three gods the other
[20:01] side maintain the position that there is
[20:06] only one God and those teachings and
[20:12] those things have come right on down
[20:17] until our day and our time that we are
[20:22] living in but the revelation that came
[20:25] through John by the Holy Spirit to all
[20:29] the churches said I am the Lord Jesus
[20:33] Christ in other words I am all in all I
[20:38] am alpha i am omega there isn't any
[20:41] other god how about the almighty i am
[20:44] the lord I am the first I am the last of
[20:47] the beginning I am the end I'm him which
[20:50] was in the first time in the middle and
[20:53] I will be there at the end in which was
[20:55] which is and is to come the Lord
[20:59] Almighty he is making his deity known to
[21:05] all and he has put his seal his stamp of
[21:10] approval upon this book of Revelation
[21:13] and upon all genuine holy spirit given
[21:19] revelation no think about this consider
[21:22] this my friends who must the father of
[21:27] Jesus Matthew chapter 1 verse 18 says
[21:33] she was found with child of the Holy
[21:38] Ghost strange for Jesus himself when he
[21:44] was asked the question said my father
[21:48] God is my father God is my father then
[21:54] we are left with the problem who is the
[21:59] father of Jesus Christ if they were
[22:01] truly three distinct persons in one God
[22:05] was the holy
[22:07] ghost his father or was it God the
[22:11] Father that was his father did he have
[22:15] one father or two fathers certainly not
[22:19] because of not understanding the
[22:22] revelation that it is one God amen one
[22:26] God and the name of that God that
[22:29] wonderful God that revealed himself and
[22:34] made himself form the body went into it
[22:38] God in Christ amen
[22:40] yet God was in Christ hallelujah and
[22:43] here it was one God not two not three
[22:47] but one God we'll get to all of these
[22:51] finer things as we go on with this
[22:55] lesson in the future maybe not tonight
[22:58] because there's a lot of meat lots of
[23:01] things to cover and we want to take our
[23:04] time and cover it properly and
[23:07] appropriately so that you might have a
[23:09] clearer understanding if you so desire
[23:12] and if you open up your heart to receive
[23:14] it now we see historically and
[23:18] scripturally people have wondered where
[23:23] these three came from where did this saw
[23:27] this theory of three gods being one came
[23:32] from now we know that that foundational
[23:36] doctrine of what modern Christianity
[23:41] from the time of 325 AD until now
[23:45] because that sort of tree gods was never
[23:49] has never been there in the scriptures
[23:52] at all until that time we understand the
[23:57] only nations that help those kinds of
[24:01] beliefs and thoughts were the Babylonian
[24:04] Sumerians various other peoples of of
[24:09] the pagan a Dark Ages of the Old
[24:13] Testament but we know that
[24:16] Joe always declared himself that he is
[24:20] one not three but one now this Trinity
[24:26] of course using the word fringe is
[24:29] absolutely unscriptural it's not
[24:32] anywhere in our Bible but never mind
[24:36] that we understand that it's absolutely
[24:41] unscriptural unbiblical and it's really
[24:45] based upon the the many gods of pagan
[24:51] Rome the Romans at that time had many
[24:56] gods and they prayed to those many gods
[25:02] and they also prayed to their ancestors
[25:11] and use our prayed to their ancestors as
[25:17] mediators who they believed if they pray
[25:21] to their ancestors their ancestor could
[25:24] intercede with God beyond the veil on
[25:28] their behalf you see my friends the thin
[25:34] skin veil that is there then it took
[25:38] them just one step one step to give new
[25:45] names to their own gods and so we have
[25:53] Saints today to make it more biblical
[25:58] they call some of their ancestors Saints
[26:04] thus we find instead of openly
[26:09] worshipping Jupiter or Venus or Mars we
[26:16] have the worship of Peter and Paul and
[26:22] uh all these various ones the worship
[26:30] fatima christopher and many others
[26:35] you see they could not make their pagan
[26:39] religion work or their religious system
[26:43] work with just one God so the closest
[26:49] they could get still maintaining their
[26:52] many God's system was to uh kind of
[26:57] bring it down to three gods and they
[27:03] were then they done split him this one
[27:08] God that we're talking about this him
[27:11] industry to get their religious system
[27:15] to be able to work and they men
[27:20] intercessors or mediators of the Saints
[27:27] and demand intercessors of their
[27:31] ancestors ever since then the entire
[27:39] spiritual atmosphere was polluted and
[27:44] people fail to realize that the teaching
[27:51] of God is that there is one God era
[27:56] blotted out the knowledge of one God
[28:03] took away completely
[28:05] then it was not three gods but one God
[28:09] manifesting himself in three various
[28:13] offices that's how I'm a father I am a
[28:18] son I'm a human being doesn't make me
[28:22] three people I am one person but I move
[28:27] in three different offices three
[28:31] different rules but one person and so is
[28:37] it God is one God now we also know
[28:42] they tried to make it into some
[28:44] fantastic theory that God is like a
[28:47] bunch of grapes three persons but
[28:54] mysteriously become one sharing their
[29:00] divinity equally by all three of them
[29:06] but plainly says here in the book of
[29:09] Revelation by the Lord Jesus Christ
[29:12] himself him that day which is that which
[29:19] was that which is to come he is the
[29:27] Alpha and Omega nothing which means that
[29:32] he not they he is the eighth to Z they
[29:38] all in all this means he is everything
[29:45] he said they are mighty he is the Rose
[29:51] of Sharon he not say he is the lily of
[29:57] the valley he not they he is the bright
[30:02] and Morning Star he not they the
[30:08] righteous branch he or him the Lord
[30:13] Jesus not they he is the Father the Son
[30:19] and the Holy Ghost he is God Almighty
[30:24] one God operating or manifesting himself
[30:28] in three distinct offices first Timothy
[30:34] chapter 3 verse 16 says and without
[30:39] controversy that is to say without
[30:45] argument without debate without question
[30:50] without any dispute God was many
[30:56] grant is the mystery of godliness that
[31:01] who God was manifested in the flesh who
[31:05] was manifested in the flesh God was
[31:08] manifested in the flesh justified in the
[31:13] spirit God was justified in the spirit
[31:17] seen of angels who was seen Avengers God
[31:22] was seen of angels preached on to the
[31:28] Gentiles God was preached unto the
[31:32] Gentiles who is this God Jesus Christ
[31:36] amen
[31:37] believed on in the world and was
[31:42] received up into glory who was received
[31:45] up God was received up into glory this
[31:49] is what Timothy is saying that grid is
[31:52] the mystery of godliness that God was
[31:56] manifested in the flesh and that God
[32:00] that was manifested in the flesh
[32:02] preached on inter in the world that same
[32:06] God was received back up into glory not
[32:12] another God the Bible says it clearly
[32:15] it says God one God was made manifested
[32:20] in the flesh and that one God that we
[32:23] know I believe is the Lord Jesus Christ
[32:26] I think that ought to settle it right
[32:28] there I just love the words of this
[32:32] beautiful son he's God in the Father
[32:35] he's God in the son he's God in the Holy
[32:39] Ghost he's got the only one I know God
[32:43] he's God and God don't ever change I
[32:47] know God he's God and Jesus is his name
[32:53] all thank God there's only one God and
[32:57] his name is the Lord Jesus Christ
[33:00] they're these apostles knew who he was
[33:03] and they did not
[33:05] to make him into another God or a second
[33:09] God or a third God but the only God he
[33:14] was God very you he was very God he was
[33:18] that only God and it is it is this
[33:22] marvelous revelation that is now being
[33:25] restored to empower the church to come
[33:28] back to the word come back to God and to
[33:31] recognize what was erased by era now
[33:37] being restored by the righteousness and
[33:40] revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ back
[33:42] into the church that is the revelation
[33:45] one God and I thank God for that that he
[33:49] is Lord he is Lord he is risen from the
[33:53] dead and he is Lord every knee shall bow
[33:57] and every tongue shall confess that
[33:59] Jesus Christ is Lord may God bless you
