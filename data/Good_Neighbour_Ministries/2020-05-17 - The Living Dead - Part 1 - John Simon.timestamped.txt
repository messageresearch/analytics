[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] dear friends good Sunday morning I'm
[0:17] happy to be here I'm here to speak on
[0:22] the subject of the Living Dead I'm
[0:25] Pastor John Simon let us pray
[0:28] gracious Heavenly Father we pray your
[0:31] blessing upon this wonderful time in
[0:35] your presence bless the hearers and the
[0:38] speaker and take all the glory honor and
[0:41] praise in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[0:45] and amen let us read our scripture of
[0:51] first Timothy 5 verse 6 which reads thus
[0:59] but she that liveth in pleasure is dead
[1:04] while she liveth may I repeat first
[1:08] Timothy 5:16 but she that liveth in
[1:14] pleasure is dead while she liveth the
[1:22] scripture of course is speaking about
[1:25] wanton widows who enjoy the pleasures of
[1:31] sin by loose living it is saying but she
[1:42] that lives in sin or for sin or for the
[1:48] pleasure or the enjoyment of sin is
[1:52] already spiritually dead why she is yet
[1:58] alive in other words she is a literal
[2:03] Walking Dead the scriptural extension
[2:08] and the compound application of this
[2:12] scripture would not only say she
[2:20] but she he or they that live in sin or
[2:26] lives for the pleasures and the
[2:29] enjoyment for sin those that live with
[2:35] an appetite and constant desire for sin
[2:41] one is one of the Living Dead
[2:45] [Music]
[2:46] certainly my friends I want you like
[2:53] Lazarus to come out from amongst the
[2:56] dead don't live that way don't associate
[3:01] yourself with the Living Dead but the
[3:06] call this morning is for you to come out
[3:10] from a mouse the dead now we know that
[3:15] November 1st is usually celebrated as
[3:19] the day of the dead All Saints Day and
[3:26] also called All Souls Day then we see
[3:33] this time also ties in with Halloween
[3:42] which is generally October 31st and it's
[3:49] the observance of this Day of the Dead
[3:55] night of the Dead Halloween is usually
[4:00] observed by the burning of candles by
[4:05] prayers for the dead and by visits to of
[4:12] all places to the cemetery now both of
[4:18] these traditional observances of
[4:22] Halloween and of All Saints Day are
[4:27] literally of pagan origins that have
[4:33] sucks
[4:33] that's fully inserted themselves into
[4:38] Christianity one speaks of the day of
[4:42] the dead and the other speaks of the
[4:47] night of the dead considered to be the
[4:53] one and only night where it's believed
[4:57] that on that one night the dead are
[5:02] allowed to come out of their graves
[5:05] and to cross back over into the land of
[5:10] the living and to walk amongst the
[5:14] people of the earth now you say well
[5:18] brother Simon what has that got to do
[5:21] with me friends as a fact a literal fact
[5:28] no such a thing really exists as the
[5:32] dead coming out of the graves and coming
[5:36] back to walk and to live among us and
[5:40] move around for that one night upon the
[5:44] face of the earth well friends it's
[5:48] midnight it's midnight in America it's
[5:53] midnight in Canada and it's midnight all
[5:56] over the world spiritually it's midnight
[6:01] everywhere and gross darkness covers the
[6:05] land and covers the heart of the people
[6:09] certainly suffocating spiritual darkness
[6:14] as in Egypt is now upon us and in this
[6:19] spread everywhere now this is not a
[6:23] surprise to Christians to believers in
[6:27] it's not a surprise because this was
[6:30] already prophesied by God's prophet of
[6:34] the 20th century William variant brand
[6:38] hand now these moves as you see
[6:42] represented behind me are simply
[6:47] something that happened at a time when
[6:50] he prophesied many many years before
[6:53] that something like this was going to
[6:57] happen and drew upon a wall this
[7:01] marvelous description of the seven
[7:05] churches moving from late in the days of
[7:09] Paul right to our day of the Libyan
[7:13] church age a day of darkness and
[7:16] deception and death and this is the time
[7:21] we are living in it's midnight friends
[7:24] it's the midnight hour all over the
[7:27] world and he said also there will be a
[7:32] total blackout or God reflected this to
[7:37] us in the moon sea and these seven
[7:42] stages of the Moon with the last one
[7:46] going into total darkness speaks of our
[7:51] day when truth will be pushed out and
[7:57] spiritual darkness gross darkness
[8:01] darkness can be felt and sense will
[8:05] cover the land cover the earth and rest
[8:08] upon the people what time is it sirs
[8:11] it's midnight
[8:13] owl x clock is striking the owl
[8:17] Jesus will soon descend and yet people
[8:21] are living and walking in sin caring not
[8:27] that our Lord was crucified for them and
[8:30] died for their sins and is waiting with
[8:33] love as a great Shepherd for his
[8:36] children to come back home to him
[8:39] wherever you are let me sum the call let
[8:43] me sound the cry return while there is
[8:46] yet time to return come to him while
[8:50] there is yet time to come submit your
[8:53] life to him and he will change you by
[8:56] his
[8:57] find power and make you into who he
[9:01] wants you to be there was the ending of
[9:04] this seventh church age of low vision
[9:08] this age of spiritual darkness of sin
[9:13] sin has blinded the minds of men
[9:19] everywhere every nation of retirement of
[9:23] every language it's universal this virus
[9:28] this poison of sin has covered the
[9:32] hearts of men and women everywhere
[9:36] certainly we see a trends governments
[9:40] covered in darkness courts places of
[9:44] worship schools universities I tell you
[9:50] homes
[9:51] entire families taken over by the
[9:55] darkness flowing and swirling around
[10:00] everywhere like a dark and foggy night
[10:03] where none can see their way or see any
[10:07] light or truth anywhere suddenly the
[10:11] spiritual zombies are out the ghouls are
[10:16] out the ghosts are out the demons
[10:20] impersonating the souls of the so-called
[10:23] dead and Damned are now stalking the
[10:27] land we know according to the Gospel of
[10:32] Luke chapter 16 verse 19 to 31 a matter
[10:38] of fact let me read a few verses because
[10:42] Jesus tells a marvelous story of how
[10:46] there was a rich man and a beggar and
[10:49] let me continue and it came to pass that
[10:54] the beggar died and was carried by the
[10:57] Angels into Abraham's bosom the rich man
[11:02] also died and was buried and in hell he
[11:09] lifted up his eyes
[11:11] being in torments and seeth Abraham afar
[11:15] off and seeing Lazarus the better in his
[11:20] bosom
[11:21] and he cried and said father Abraham
[11:23] have mercy on me have mercy on me send
[11:27] Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his
[11:31] finger in water and cool my tongue for I
[11:35] am tormented in this flame but Abraham
[11:39] said son remember thou in thy lifetime
[11:42] receive us like good things and likewise
[11:46] Lazarus evil things and now he is
[11:50] comforted and thou art tormented and
[11:54] beside all this between us and you there
[12:00] is a great gulf fixed so that they which
[12:07] would pass from hence to you cannot
[12:12] neither can they pass to us that would
[12:18] come from this Oh friends oh stop the
[12:23] reading right there that is enough so we
[12:27] understand he from the word of God from
[12:30] the Lord Jesus himself telling about
[12:33] this saying clearly that no one none can
[12:41] return back to the land of the living
[12:45] after that they're dead so let no one
[12:50] deceive you let no one mislead you let
[12:55] no one listen for you distract you from
[12:58] the truth of the word of God therefore
[13:03] from this we know that these are evil
[13:12] demonic spirits that are impersonating
[13:17] the souls of the Dead intent these are
[13:23] of the invisible armies
[13:25] darkness unseen Devils that I here to
[13:30] kill to steal your joy your life your
[13:36] future and to destroy your entire
[13:39] existence in every possible way
[13:43] now these soul eaters and Body Snatchers
[13:47] at earth and spiritual zombies are out
[13:52] because the darkness of the spiritual
[13:56] atmosphere invites them to activity here
[14:00] friends it's midnight it's midnight all
[14:04] over the world now you say well pastor
[14:08] Simon what what is a zombie now
[14:12] according to Google if you will look it
[14:15] up yourself you'll find it there a
[14:17] zombie is a walking corpse and the
[14:24] people who are living in sin are already
[14:28] spiritually dead or Darrell are you
[14:32] dying and rotten from the insulate out
[14:39] dead spiritually dead but physically
[14:45] they are convinced that they are living
[14:49] nothing but a wonderful life and that
[14:53] their life is good and everything is all
[14:55] right
[14:56] meanwhile they're rotten and the stench
[15:01] rises up in the nostrils of God ah their
[15:05] very nature on the inside compels them
[15:10] to send and sin and sin again but Jesus
[15:15] said speaking about the religious
[15:18] leaders of his day he said in Matthew 23
[15:23] vs. 27 but you are like weddings if
[15:28] graves that appear beautiful on the
[15:32] outside but are full of uncleanness and
[15:39] men's bones on the inside you see the
[15:44] pharisees the sadducees the religious
[15:48] leaders of that day and at that time
[15:53] that were opposed to the word of the
[15:56] hour the word made flesh was being
[15:59] opposed by religious leaders of that day
[16:03] and he said in appearance they were
[16:07] literally almost perfect and attractive
[16:12] by their dress their wear their walk
[16:15] their talk but really on the inside
[16:20] there was a stench that not all the
[16:23] perfumes of Arabia could destroy there's
[16:27] that the rottenness to the core was from
[16:31] the inside coming to the outside yes and
[16:36] so is any religious person or any
[16:39] persons whatsoever that lives the way
[16:44] they did rejecting the Word of God for
[16:48] your day and for your hour you will also
[16:51] have that a good man a good woman a
[16:55] wonderful a church-going person
[16:58] perfection on the outside but on the
[17:01] inside rotten to the core
[17:04] Kim was a zombie for he was a child of
[17:12] the evil one half man and half beast
[17:18] with no seat jean of god no soul of God
[17:23] in him in fact he had a soul that sins
[17:28] and the Bible tells us when you have a
[17:31] soul that sin the soul that sinneth it
[17:35] shall surely die according to ezekiel
[17:39] 18:4 and also verse 20 but thank God
[17:45] first John chapter 3 verse 9
[17:49] there's but the seed of God cannot sin
[17:55] one soul that sins shall die not eternal
[17:59] but they are the gene of God that's in
[18:03] the other person is eternal it cannot
[18:07] sin and it cannot die no wonder jesus
[18:10] said he that liveth and believeth on me
[18:14] though he were dead yet shall he also
[18:17] live for the scene of God first John
[18:21] says abideth in him
[18:24] all thanks be to God hallelujah all yes
[18:28] here we see the seeds of death and the
[18:32] seeds of life and the seed which shall
[18:37] not be heir with the shop now the people
[18:41] of North days for as it was in the days
[18:44] of Noah so shall it be in the days of
[18:48] the coming of the Son of Man when the
[18:50] Son of Man would be revealed again now
[18:55] the people at Mars day were of the kind
[19:01] of similar to Cain for their work mainly
[19:05] of his generation with that beast nature
[19:09] that would listen to the preaching of a
[19:12] god-sent prophet Noah who was a knower
[19:16] of the world and rejected his message
[19:21] for their day proving that they were
[19:25] Antichrist empty word and against the
[19:29] principles and teachings and warnings of
[19:32] the Word of God may God help us friends
[19:36] that we do not have a spirit like that
[19:38] but that we will cooperate we will
[19:41] submit and surrender and obey that
[19:44] precepts principles and teachings and
[19:47] warnings that comes from the Word of God
[19:50] so we see friends that all that were in
[19:54] the day of Noah that did not heed the
[19:57] Word of God their perish and all outside
[20:02] of the ark pair
[20:03] all outside of Christ will perish and
[20:07] here we are all those men out and Jean a
[20:12] seed a life of God that was placed
[20:17] within them they oh praise God will
[20:21] perish friends certainly we see also
[20:24] feral was nothing but a Walking Dead
[20:29] Cora Dayton they were in that army of
[20:33] the Walking Dead the Pharisees and
[20:37] Sadducees in the days of Jesus they were
[20:41] in the army of the walking dead then we
[20:44] see Judas who inserted himself into
[20:48] Christianity and was right beside the
[20:51] Lord Jesus right there with his love of
[20:55] money and with his desire that he had
[20:59] been in his heart oh my friends there he
[21:03] was but the Bible tells us clearly that
[21:07] he was a son of the devil he was of that
[21:12] wicked one he was evil to his very core
[21:17] but outwardly he was very religious
[21:22] these spirits these evil demons they
[21:28] were also active in the days of Paul and
[21:33] Paul spoke of them and call them
[21:37] ravening wolves Jude described them as
[21:43] spots within our feasts these demonic
[21:48] powers make no mistake about it these
[21:52] demonic powers though may be appears
[21:56] like Angels of Light
[21:58] religious are in our midst again and we
[22:02] must be aware of it friends they are
[22:04] here today John the revelation gives a
[22:09] description in Revelation 9 of some of
[22:13] these frightening
[22:15] Devils and spirits that are to be loosed
[22:20] on the face of the earth I tell you my
[22:23] friends it's a dark day we're living in
[22:27] and a frightening time but for the
[22:30] Christian it's a glorious and wonderful
[22:32] time because on one hand when there is
[22:36] darkness for the devil his demons and
[22:40] the dis followers there is light for the
[22:44] Christian and a believer for they can
[22:46] look up for the coming of the Lord
[22:49] joint 9 the coming of the Lord is here
[22:51] takes me to God how happy we should be
[22:54] we also see the scriptures one beautiful
[22:59] song that says turns clock is striking
[23:03] the hour
[23:04] Jesus will soon descend clad in the
[23:08] garments of power there are reign of sin
[23:12] to end it is the rising of the Sun and
[23:15] when the Sun comes up it tries the
[23:18] darkness away the fog away all of the
[23:22] doubts your fears your your presumptions
[23:25] are driven away but the rising of the
[23:29] Sun oh praise be to God we are so
[23:34] confident in him and happy in the Lord
[23:38] because we know we are more than
[23:41] conquerors through him that loved us and
[23:44] Satan's legions of the already damned
[23:48] and his armies of darkness made up of
[23:52] demons and humans are already defeated
[23:57] in the name of Jesus Christ by the blood
[24:01] of Jesus Christ and by the testimony of
[24:04] Jesus Christ
[24:05] yes it's midnight in America it's
[24:09] midnight in Canada it's midnight
[24:12] all over the world and spiritual
[24:15] darkness is everywhere whoa mitt
[24:19] in the world for the world lies in a bed
[24:23] of worldliness and drunkenness it's
[24:28] midnight in God's church and I'm here
[24:31] blowing a trumpet in Zion to warn God's
[24:34] people heaven or hell Christ or chaos
[24:38] judgment is at hand and heaven is near
[24:41] Oh make up your mind to live for the
[24:44] Lord and for him alone this is the hour
[24:48] when we must choose Hussein we are on
[24:52] yes the church living in worthiness
[24:59] comfortable like a frog in the kettle's
[25:03] with the spirit of lukewarmness resting
[25:07] upon her wine drinking from our cups a
[25:13] spiritual fornication do you who are
[25:17] watching is it nighttime in your life
[25:23] are you Mary existing are you walking in
[25:28] the dark
[25:31] are you a message believer and you just
[25:37] blindly following the message without
[25:39] the clear revelation of thus saith the
[25:43] Lord you do not have a clear revelation
[25:47] or a clear understanding of what God has
[25:52] done by sending a prophet and what he is
[25:57] doing now through the message of the
[26:01] Prophet which is for running the second
[26:04] coming of Jesus Christ
[26:06] o my brother my sister I ask you look up
[26:11] lift up your head and cry out to God and
[26:15] ask God for wisdom who gives liberally
[26:19] to anyone that will ask it God will give
[26:23] you revelation not from some book of
[26:27] theology not from a universe
[26:29] not by higher learning not by becoming
[26:33] some so-called trained counselor or
[26:36] becoming some great theologian that's
[26:38] just nonsense in the eyes of God for
[26:41] that's knowledge accrued by the five
[26:44] senses of man which is totally limited
[26:47] but I'm talking about youth talking to
[26:50] God and asking him lord help me to tap
[26:53] into your wisdom your knowledge your
[26:56] understanding and don't let me interpret
[26:59] your word
[27:00] but God come fill me and you be the
[27:03] interpreter of your own word I ask it in
[27:06] the name of Jesus Christ and surely God
[27:09] will hear you God will help you God will
[27:12] lift you up and like you dip the part in
[27:15] yes the scales will fall from your eyes
[27:17] like he did the pole the scales will
[27:21] fall from your eyes and you will be able
[27:23] to say oh I wish I could make all men
[27:27] see the what is it fellowship of this
[27:30] mystery
[27:31] Oh for Jesus will reveal himself to you
[27:35] personally by the opening of the Word of
[27:38] God for the hour yes friends wake up
[27:45] wake up out of your sleep get up
[27:49] as Paul said arise and cotton to the
[27:54] light it's frightening ly dark very dark
[28:01] and except my time with demon powers
[28:06] become active whipped or without the
[28:12] light of the Moon witches wizards demon
[28:17] powers are always active when things
[28:22] become dark but hope thanks be to God we
[28:25] are not children of the darkness we are
[28:27] the children of light we walk in truth
[28:30] we walk in light but we must know the
[28:33] fact that when darkness the same
[28:36] spiritually or naturally it's when the
[28:40] evil deep
[28:41] powers begin to become active if at
[28:45] night Center profit when rats roaches
[28:50] snakes and all other creatures of the
[28:54] night that's the time when they begin to
[28:58] come out I want to notice friends it's
[29:01] usually at midnight or after midnight
[29:06] when all the crazies come out all the
[29:11] moonstruck come out when all the parties
[29:17] really begin to rock and the music
[29:23] begins to boom and sound and the screams
[29:30] and cries of stupefying japanesse
[29:37] adulteries fornications four versions of
[29:42] all kind of which Paul says they which
[29:47] do these things will not enter into the
[29:52] kingdom of God they will not do it one
[29:57] time the Prophet being in a hotel going
[30:04] to his room after meeting and down the
[30:07] hallway of the hotel runs a half-naked
[30:11] woman with her with a camera or glass of
[30:15] liquor in her hand half drunk and saying
[30:20] hey this is life he couldn't help
[30:24] himself he turns there's no woman that
[30:27] is not life that is death and I say to
[30:31] you
[30:32] Tintin today that is death if you live
[30:37] that way that is death oh my friends
[30:41] it's this kind of darkness that shows up
[30:46] at least office parties be honest with
[30:51] yourself man
[30:52] be honest
[30:54] think about it that's when the darkness
[30:58] sometimes shows up office parties
[31:02] Christmas parties champagne gatherings
[31:08] but remember in the midst of all that
[31:12] they that live in sin or death will they
[31:18] appear to be a life successful rich or
[31:24] even appear to be physically healthy for
[31:28] she that liveth into the pleasures of
[31:32] sin is dead once you live it my friends
[31:35] true Christian believers know that we
[31:40] are in a midst of a ferocious war we are
[31:45] here fighting against unseen powers of
[31:49] darkness operating in high places we
[31:54] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[31:56] are fighters with spiritual wickedness
[32:00] everywhere my question to you is which
[32:04] side are you on
[32:06] are you with the horse of heaven are you
[32:10] with the Lord's army are you with God's
[32:14] salvation army are you with the armies
[32:18] of light let by Michael the Archangel
[32:22] under the power of the Holy Spirit or
[32:26] are you with Satan and his viral
[32:30] parasitic evil army of Darkness Oh God
[32:37] lives in his army that is why it cannot
[32:41] be defeated for he is the mighty
[32:43] Conqueror who has ripped the veil into
[32:47] God empowers his army by his presence of
[32:51] living in them and they walk as children
[32:54] of the light but Satan also lives in his
[33:00] Ernie
[33:00] he possesses them and he walks and lives
[33:05] anoint and
[33:07] inspires the Living Dead who are alive
[33:12] physically but dead spiritually oh my
[33:17] friends get away from that I want you to
[33:20] know my friends right now that when you
[33:24] live like that you qualify as a member
[33:29] of that army as a soldier in that evil
[33:33] Legion of darkness that you are a member
[33:37] of however your situation is not
[33:41] hopeless for Jesus proves that he has
[33:47] the power over life in this he
[33:52] challenged Satan by saying even if you
[33:55] destroy this body in three days I'll
[33:58] raise it up again he also proved it at
[34:02] the grave of Lazarus Lazarus who was
[34:06] dead and Jesus came it appears as if he
[34:12] was late but he Jesus Christ the God is
[34:16] never late even though it seems like his
[34:18] Delaine and he maybe hasn't answered
[34:21] your prayer just yet just wait upon the
[34:24] Lord because Jesus keeps all of his
[34:27] appointments and so he came on the scene
[34:31] and one of the sister said Lord if you
[34:36] had been here my brother would not have
[34:39] died and you know Jesus felt sad the
[34:45] scripture says he wept he says you know
[34:49] he live again they said yes Lord we know
[34:52] in the resurrection in a nice way he was
[34:57] correcting and he said but you don't
[34:58] understand the resurrection is not a
[35:01] time it's not some event only that's
[35:05] maybe coming up the road I am the
[35:08] resurrection I am the personification of
[35:12] the resurrection I am the life that's
[35:15] all in me and he says take me to where
[35:19] they
[35:20] laid him they took him to the tomb of
[35:24] Lazarus I can see the crowds with the
[35:27] Pharisees his detractors his critics all
[35:31] crowding about dances now he's gone too
[35:34] far now we really got him and he stands
[35:38] there this man's dead for four days and
[35:41] he's asking that to roll back the storm
[35:45] all my friends I tell you if the stone
[35:49] of doubt and fear and darkness and
[35:52] habits can roll away from you today I'll
[35:55] tell you you'll walk out of your path
[35:57] you'll walk out of that old life and
[35:59] you'll walk into a new one in the name
[36:02] of Jesus Christ and the Bible further
[36:05] tells us the Rope they did rolled back
[36:09] the stone but not wittingly they said
[36:11] Lord why should be ruling that he's
[36:14] thinking and of course your life will
[36:17] stick if you're living in sin your life
[36:20] will have a rotten seated order to it if
[36:23] you are living and existing and walking
[36:26] in the darkness of sin that takes me to
[36:29] God he is the mighty Conqueror he is
[36:33] Lord and so he said roll back the stone
[36:37] and then the Bible says he lifted up his
[36:40] voice and he says Lazarus come forth and
[36:45] the Bible tells us Lazarus came for
[36:49] wrapped in his grave clothes and Jesus
[36:52] said lose him and let him go
[36:55] no matter what happens no matter what
[36:57] conditions or situations may hold you
[37:00] bound Jesus Christ is saying to you
[37:03] today lose him Satan let him go Satan
[37:08] let her go let them go doc can't believe
[37:12] all things are possible to them that
[37:15] will believe the Word of God far away
[37:18] where the soul of Lazarus might have
[37:21] been traveling he threw the cart of the
[37:24] time heard the voice of the Lord over
[37:28] life and death calling him back
[37:31] Lazarus come forth that same voices
[37:34] coming to you come out of your darkness
[37:36] come out of your dirt come out of your
