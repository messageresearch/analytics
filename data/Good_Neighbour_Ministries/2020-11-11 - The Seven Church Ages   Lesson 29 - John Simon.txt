TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening friends it's good to be here once again thank god for his marvelous grace at this time i would like to recognize the contributions to our society made by our marvelous veterans veterans of various wars that have given their lives that have surrendered themselves to preserve and to protect our civilization and our countries thank god for the veterans especially of canada and of the united states we thank god for them and pay respects for them we thank god as we remember a wonderful veteran that used to be in our midst but has now gone to his reward brother henry gagnon a guard of generals that were brought from europe to canada and were guarded by him may god rest his gallant soul and may god rest the lives minds and souls of these various veterans that have given themselves to preserve the and protect the freedoms and the liberty that we enjoy but there's another liberty that i am going to speak on now and this is found in the book of revelation chapter 2 verse 7 and it reads thus he that had an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcome it will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god hallelujah father we thank you for the reading of your word we pray father as you water the word with the blessed holy spirit reigns we pray father that it will come forth and be a blessing to every heart life and mind and may you be lifted up and glorified as we surrender ourselves to thee for service in the name of jesus christ our lord amen tonight i'd like to speak on the overcoming life the overcoming life as our scripture has said to him that overcome it will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god think of it the tree of life in the garden of eden out of which came death but yes what a blessed thought that the tree of life was standing there in the garden of eden but this tree could not be approached on because of the fall of man they could not approach the tree anymore and adam was not and could not become an overcomer because he had fallen away from that tree and now the flaming sword of the guardian angels the flaming swords of those cherubims that were always there around the throne around the tree of life to protect the weight to the tree of life with their flaming swords their swords had been cheated or kept in their sheets but it was kept in the sheet because my friends its blade was now bloody with the blood of the lamb of god think of it the tree of life was denied to adam and his all of his descendants for adam was a representative man who represented the entire human race whatever he did or had done reflected upon every person that came of this human race but thank god we are now allowed once again to go and eat from the tree of life because of the shed blood of the lamb which allowed the cherubims to step aside and to make way for god's people and god's bride to eat from the tree of life why could not adam eat from the tree at first they were commanded to and then after he could not eat from the tree and i see according to the word it was because of sin it was because of him bypassing the word of god he could not go to that tree of life to eat you see my friends adam lived in a state of continuous fellowship with god before the fall he lived a marvelous and wonderful life of where he was in constant connection constant fellowship a constant reception of continuous revelation into the mind of god whatever god wanted done whatever god wanted said whatever it was adam had that connection which was later broken by the fall oh man so he lived in a state of continuous connection and revelation in the presence of god and so is every overcomer when a person comes to the place where god recognizes them and they recognize themselves that they have broken into once again the mind of god the truth of god the revelation of god the spirit of god then they begin to live in a state of grace a state of continuous reception of revelation pouring out from god unto them for what was once given to adam is now given to the believers that will stay with the word in the word and walk with the word of the living god what was the night adam because of the fall is now restored reinstated to those who will accept his promised word for this hour now i would want to encourage you to read study or listen to the sermon how can i overcome by our precious brother william marion branham you'll find in our text today that the overcomer is promised by god that he would once again eat from the tree of life but that is not the only promise given to overcomers we find that in revelation chapter 2 verse 11 that the god promises the overcomer that he shall not be hurt by the second death thank god also in revelation chapter 2 verse 17 god said i will permit him to eat of the hidden manna praise god hallelujah the overcomer is also promised revelation chapter 2 verse 26 that i will give him a white stone oh thank god hallelujah and that he will have power over the nations praise god it doesn't say denominations here it says nations but he will give you power over the nations according to revelation chapter 2 and verse 26. in revelation 3 verse 5 god says of these overcomers that i will clothe them with raiment white raiment bright and fair thank god the overcomer are those who have walked through this filthy dirty blackened world and came out with their robes white and clean yes these are they who washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb for they have overcome in the name of the lord jesus christ glory to god hallelujah revelation chapter 3 verse 12 to the overcomer i will make him a pillar in the temple of our my god so here is the overcomer with his white robe being a pillar not hurt by the second death able to go in and eat from the tree of life and then we find i will set he will i will bring him to set with me with in the in my throne praise god hallelujah that overcome again is no one else but the wife the bride of jesus christ who has overcome the world of flesh and the devil and now she stands sits by the word she is settled in her position of who she is side by side with the word of god jesus christ thanks be to god hallelujah now of course we know that god's original intention for his creation man what's the expression is to express his words amen now in genesis adam was given the word of god to live by as we are given the word of god to live by and any life lived by the word of god becomes the word of god expressed or the word of god in expression or manifestation or thanks be to god that's not back only in the bible that's here right now to anyone that will surrender their lives into the power permit preeminence and control and prisonership of jesus christ to him be glory and praise and honor forever and ever praise god adam lived by that word but yet he was not an overcomer because he did not live by every word for god requires us to pay heed and to live by every word of god my friends i want to say to you that the very best of the entire human race from adam on down to christ everyone failed to try to live by every word of god we know adam failed because he listened to the voice of his wife he bypassed the word knowing full well what he was doing but he failed god and failed god's word we realize moses failed because moses my friends got angry david failed because of his adultery according to god's word but we find hebrews chapters 1 and chapters 2 that there came one there came a mighty one there came a man named jesus who overcame and live by every word of god for hebrews 1 and 2 if you will take your time to read those chapters you will find out that jesus being still being a man yet he was greater than the angels jesus the man christ jesus approved of god anointed of god used of god god lived in him he was the fullness of the godhead bodily he was wonderful cause of the mighty god everlasting father and the prince of peace of course we know there are not three or four everlasting fathers but here we find out praise god that he was greater than the angels he was the creator of the angels oh he was greater than the high priest he was the one that ordained the high priest praise be to god he was greater than moses and all the prophets gloried be to his precious name and then he was greater than all the kings for he is the king of kings and lord of lords he wasn't his greater than all the wise men of the earth amen greater than solomon for he said that greater than solomon is here oh my he was greater than daniel daniel is spoken of because of his wisdom and because of the anointing and his judgment but this one hallelujah was not uh was god in flesh and so he was greater than danielle praise god hallelujah i'm thank god that jesus is greater i said jesus is greater our lord is greater he is greater than anyone anybody and anything that has ever come upon this earth glory to god for he never failed amen he never failed and will never fail and that means that when he lived by every word of god for he said it is written it is written it is written amen and satan was foiled he was defeated and and destroyed by jesus christ making the word of god expressed and manifested from his mouth here he was here was one that despite all the tricks and traps and tribulations and trials of satan here was one who overcame them proving that those who would follow him and would accept him in their lives can and will also overcome for he who has already overcome will be living in them to overcome any trail that our tribulation test trick trap or whatever temptation that satan will bring they would overcome it by the one who has already overcome that lives in them and makes them overcomers by his grace by his presence and by his power within their lives thanks be to god that in this fullness of time he came along he jesus jesus the christ jesus the head or headship of the spiritual body of the living god oh praise god amen so he overcame and he was god's in other words god's masterpiece he was like the blueprint of god from which all others could uh could line up their lives into the structure of a perfect to be a perfect man of the perfect man jesus christ masterpiece perfection of perfection the masterpiece of the living god and he became the masterpiece by being a perfect clean reflection of the fullness of the word of god he overcame by being a perfect reflection of the word of god how can i overcome by being a perfect reflection of the word of god how can i do that by allowing him who is the perfect reflection to live in me we can be overcomers by letting him reflect his life through us praise god hallelujah thank god for we know friends the stars have no light of their own but the stars can only reflect shine by reflecting the light of the sun after the sun has gone down thank god amen so here we are friends that we as overcomers overcome by being a piece of that original masterpiece by being a part of him and there he was that perfect one reflecting the word and he was he went to the cross as the perfect lamb to be the perfect sacrifice and there on a tree listen he received death on the tree that he might bring us back to be able to receive life from the tree of life so in symbol he had to die on the tree that we to show the sign the symbol in type that we are now restored back to the tree of life and that we are no more under the curse we are not under the bondage of satan we are not under the slavery or troubled um of this evil one but we have been set free and we must be conscious and aware that and live our lives as free men not just free by word only excuse me but free indeed by the grace of god set free by the blessed holy spirit amen thank god i am free i'm free from this world of sin i've been washed in the blood of jesus i've been born again hallelujah i'm saved saved saved by his marvelous grace thank god forevermore that jesus went to calvary's rugged tree and there he laid down his life as the bloody bleeding lame of god oh praise god hallelujah to show us that he is the way maker and that the way is open for us to go right back to the very tree of life and to eat from that tree so that we may live forever more for if a man eat or from this tree he shall never hunger or never fast again because now he and the tree becomes one amen and amen praise god hallelujah so now my friends these sons of god in this hour and of every day of the church ages we overcome and are given the privilege and we are given my friends this wonderful blessing rewarded by the living god for seeing his word i see let him see he was an ear to hear let him hear and we are rewarded for hearing and seeing and recognizing the word of god the holy spirit manifesting himself through the word hallelujah and because we have recognized it god rewards us by giving us the paradise of god hallelujah in that wonderful that god has given us back the paradise of god no not that paradise back natural back in the garden of eden but god has brought you back to an endearing state god has brought you back to a a condition that you live in a position of of knowing your sonship awareness of your position of who you are where you come from and ready to receive and reveal in your marvelous reward the reward of being given the paradise of god it's called that in the bible to remind you of natural then and it also points to the supernatural eden to come to which we are going but now we are as as overcomers he gives to us the paradise of god the atmosphere the anointing in other words he will now allow you by revealing his word to you allowing you to feed from the tree of life you will be living in heavenly places in christ the anointed revealed word of god for this hour thanks be to god hallelujah glory to his marvelous name that we can live in a state of constant fellowship like adam did in the garden in the paradise of god live in a state of constant revelation tapping back into the mind of god and not going in and coming out like many of the prophets did but by stating living dwelling and abiding in this marvelous condition of being alive and knowing that you are living in heavenly places in jesus christ oh praise god forevermore hallelujah yes sir return back to an original or identic condition the symbol and type of the present spiritual condition of the true believer who is in christ who lives in those heavenly places in jesus christ as i've said the anointed word for the hour praise god hallelujah oh do you know what this means as a true son daughter child of god to live once more back in fellowship back with the communication connected back with the thoughts of god where god could speak freely to his sons and his daughters and they are living in literal and spiritual paradise for they have that upon their hearts and minds and god leads them in shady green pastures oh my god hallelujah so sweet god leads his dear children along oh thank god sons and daughters are led by the spirit of god and they live in the presence and atmosphere of the blessed holy spirit never more no more separation from him their husband jesus christ their the word no more separation from the revelation of the word of god and where wherever he goes she goes whatever he says she does whatever he commands she obeys because there is no more separations and whatever is his becomes her what becomes hers whatever is in that word that belongs to him he whispers it in her ears and it is now hers whatever knowledge that he had or has is now hers for he he shares it all with her for she is his beloved she is his elect lady she walks with him and him alone the dark things of god begin to be revealed to her the secret things of god begin to be revealed to her takes me to god that all the wisdom and knowledge and the treasures of god that were hidden in christ now being made available by the presence and teaching of the blessed holy spirit who will guide us and is guiding us into all truth and showing us the things that are to be the things to come oh thank god hallelujah amen praise god and now we find out that we shall be known as we are known we shall be known we will be recognized why not for us not for what people know of us as human beings but they'll see and know there is something flowing through you that is totally and absolutely different because it's god by the holy spirit revealing himself this great heritage to be like him and to walk in this heritage and inheritance of the overcomer who has overcome by the blood of the lamb the holy spirit and by the word of the testimony glory to god hallelujah amen all my friends we have a longing to live in that day and i believe that day is this day praise god we are in a compound part of it the rest is yet to come but thank god we live in that day when the crooked roads will all be made straight and we will meet be with him amen the crooked robes will be made straight think of it all those denominational roads which we were led down by the nose by doctrinal diversion all these tangled tales will be undone and god will make it plain to us for god is his own interpreter and he will make the word so plain that a wayfaring man though he be a fool can not air therein oh my and many today are airing in the very simplicity of the word of god we will be with him friends when you are in the word you are with him already spiritually speaking living in a realm of time without end amen you are still an art so you're still in time so you're living time without end and in the words of of a wonderful marvelous anointed preacher of god that god has used brother donnie reagan time blending into eternity just follow that thought time blending things together and then time blending into eternity when you don't know where time ends and eternity begins and you are a part of it by the grace of god how marvelous to know that we are in that position and in that place at this present time where time is blending into eternity time without end amen glory to god hallelujah we say world without and amen thanks be to god hallelujah and here we are may god hasten the appearance of that marvelous and wonderful day as we hasten to obey his word in every place and prove to him our worthiness to eat from that tree of life and to share his life his light and his glory amen and amen praise god him that had an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit see it unto the churches amen but how tragic that the first age did not listen to the word of god and did not allow themselves to be led by the holy spirit instead they listened to man man with imposing personalities man with their nicolaitanism their theology and so on they listen to men who came with man's authority instead of the authority of the blessed holy spirit but thanks be to god in this last day god has raised up and is raising up a group amen the true bride of jesus christ the true bride of the last day what will she do she will go back to listening to the voice of the spirit of the living god she will listen to the holy spirit she will my friends recognize and receive the light of god for her day and for hour the light of revelation by the word of god she'll recognize it and she will receive it praise god and by it she will begin to experience a return to the or the power of the original true pentecost not this not the the copycat of pentecost not the motions and emotions of pentecost but true petty cause she will return to the power of pentecost amen thank god hallelujah amen i tell you friends this is wonderful for the purpose and the reason of this marvelous glorious return to pentecost is that we may welcome back the lord jesus by being rapture ready being made ready for the rapture by the word revealed hallelujah by this rapturing faith this rapturing revelations out of the word of god makes her ready for the bible said the bride his wife has made herself she has made herself ready why she's stressing herself with the word of god she's dressing herself with these revelations these things god is making known to his beloved wife to his children everywhere even so come lord jesus come to your people come for your people lord amen we thank you lord and we give you all the glory for the first time you came you came above your people here he was pillar of fire hanging above israel and then he came in flesh created a body called it his son and the father went to live in the son for the father that live it in me he do it the works god in christ god with us his name shall be called emmanuel which is god with us it was god with us and now where are we god in us oh thanks be to god god above us god with us now god in us praise god and with him being in us the wife makes herself ready and so we say with joy in our hearts with the love of god enjoying the mercy and the grace of god even so come lord jesus may god bless you right now may you repent if you need to repent may you return to god if you need to return all backslider oh just moonwalk your way back to christ hallelujah walk into the great love of and grace of god and accept him now and there is room at the cross room at the tree of life for you come eat drink and live for his glory amen and amen may the lord bless you have a wonderful wonderful night may your dream dreams may you see visions and may the great holy spirit make
