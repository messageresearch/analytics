[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] welcome friends here we are again
[0:18] another wednesday evening
[0:21] giving praise honor and glory to his
[0:25] marvelous and wonderful name
[0:28] i'm happy to be with you
[0:30] and may the lord bless us all together
[0:33] as we look into the perfect
[0:37] law of liberty
[0:39] wherever you are at this particular time
[0:42] especially at this time
[0:45] a days before the christmas
[0:48] celebration
[0:50] let us look into god's word
[0:53] and give praise and thanks for god our
[0:56] savior jesus christ and may the lord
[0:59] bless us together as we think on these
[1:02] things
[1:04] out of the book of revelation
[1:07] chapter 3
[1:09] verse 8
[1:11] it reads
[1:13] i know thy works
[1:16] behold i have set before thee
[1:20] an open
[1:21] door
[1:24] and no man
[1:26] can shut it
[1:28] for thou hast a little strength
[1:34] and has kept my word
[1:37] and has not
[1:39] denied
[1:40] my name
[1:42] what a marvelous piece of scripture
[1:45] how wonderful it is
[1:48] let us pray
[1:50] our lord and savior
[1:53] lord jesus
[1:55] how thankful we are
[1:58] to be numbered in the great shining
[2:01] strong
[2:02] of the saints who have gone before us
[2:07] we pray thy blessing on this
[2:10] broadcast here today
[2:14] and we pray that the great holy spirit
[2:18] of almighty god
[2:19] will anoint
[2:21] the words of life
[2:23] that we are here to express today
[2:27] we give you all the glory lord
[2:30] and may this be
[2:32] long remembered
[2:34] in jesus name we ask it amen and amen
[2:40] well
[2:42] this evening
[2:45] we are still in the philadelphian church
[2:47] age
[2:49] at this point
[2:51] we want to take for our topic
[2:54] the age
[2:56] of the open door
[3:00] the age
[3:02] of the open door
[3:06] if you will look at this this verse
[3:10] you will find four things that we
[3:13] can look at
[3:15] one
[3:18] i know thy works
[3:22] and
[3:23] those works
[3:25] are analyzed by these four things
[3:29] the open door
[3:33] secondly
[3:35] little strength
[3:38] third
[3:39] their word
[3:41] and forth
[3:43] the name
[3:46] let me share with you also a principle
[3:50] by which we can
[3:52] better understand the flow
[3:55] of the church ages
[4:00] as each church age comes to its ending
[4:04] there is actually an overlapping
[4:08] of these ages
[4:10] a melting into
[4:13] fading
[4:14] into
[4:16] the other age
[4:18] none of these ages
[4:21] actually comes to an abrupt
[4:23] end
[4:24] whatsoever
[4:26] and so
[4:28] it is not the edges are not clear cut
[4:33] like that
[4:34] but they overlap melt or blend
[4:38] into each other
[4:40] as time
[4:41] marches
[4:42] on
[4:44] so one age flows over
[4:47] into
[4:48] the next age
[4:53] the seventh church age which is the
[4:55] leodycian church change
[4:57] which we will consider
[5:00] later on i would say next year
[5:04] is a very short age
[5:08] and it gathers itself up for a quick
[5:13] short work
[5:15] for it must work quickly
[5:18] uh and uh it it because it has a a fight
[5:23] it has a contest
[5:25] it has the saints of that age
[5:29] must be particularly strong
[5:32] in the grace of god
[5:35] the light of the day that they might
[5:39] fight against the
[5:41] uh works of the devil
[5:43] for you must understand
[5:46] that
[5:47] they have to face
[5:49] not one devil from the first day first
[5:52] age or two
[5:54] of the princes of the second age but
[5:59] they face
[6:01] the
[6:02] accumulated evil
[6:06] a cloud of devils
[6:09] are accumulous of them
[6:12] that have come together
[6:14] to
[6:15] come against this church age
[6:18] but when they come
[6:20] against this church age
[6:23] to us we have received
[6:25] the revelation of jesus christ
[6:28] therefore
[6:30] we'll draw the sword
[6:32] and the christian soldiers of the lord
[6:35] will go forth in jesus christ's name in
[6:39] the name of jesus christ we hold the
[6:42] devil
[6:44] accountable
[6:45] to the word of the living god
[6:49] all the realities of pentecost
[6:53] will be in this
[6:54] great age
[6:57] and once
[6:58] this philadelphian church age of which
[7:00] i'm speaking has run its course
[7:04] the ledecian church age quickly comes in
[7:09] and when it comes in
[7:12] it brings in with itself
[7:15] bought the tears
[7:18] and
[7:19] also the wheat
[7:21] because it's ripening time
[7:24] there was a planting season
[7:26] during the
[7:28] great ages of paul
[7:30] and the reformation and here comes
[7:35] the time of growth
[7:37] and now
[7:38] we are coming towards the judgment after
[7:41] the rapture then the judgment
[7:44] and
[7:45] the
[7:46] fruits on the vine are ripening
[7:50] both true and false
[7:52] amen
[7:54] yes both tears and wheat
[7:57] are ripening at this particular time
[8:02] listen matthew
[8:04] 13 30 says
[8:07] first bind the tears
[8:10] to burn them but gather their wheat
[8:14] into my barn
[8:16] oh praise god forevermore
[8:20] now remember the sardis church age
[8:23] started the great rev
[8:26] reformation
[8:29] the resurrection
[8:31] of the pentecostal church of the
[8:33] apostolic age
[8:36] being reformed reshaped
[8:38] resuscitated brought back to life from
[8:41] its entoment
[8:43] and now
[8:44] as the holy ghost begins to move my
[8:47] friends
[8:49] that church that had gone through the
[8:51] planting cycle
[8:53] and come up now
[8:55] through the cycle of planting and
[8:58] watering
[9:00] and nourishing
[9:02] comes right back
[9:04] in at the end of laodicea
[9:08] after the original seed
[9:10] of course we know the original seed is
[9:14] none other but the lord jesus christ
[9:16] himself for he itself says except the
[9:20] corn of wheat fall into the ground
[9:24] it abides alone
[9:26] but if it goes into the ground
[9:29] then it'll come forth multiplied and
[9:32] it'll come forth in a hundred fold and
[9:35] so on
[9:36] and so
[9:38] from the word
[9:40] seed original jesus christ
[9:44] from him came forth the great blast of
[9:47] pentecost
[9:49] and pentecost traveling through the ages
[9:53] through the seven church ages
[9:56] has come to its fullness
[9:59] that seed that was planted
[10:02] there
[10:03] now
[10:04] comes to its fullness
[10:07] after it has gone through
[10:09] its
[10:10] cycle through the ages
[10:13] and it's supposed to come back
[10:16] not to pentecost
[10:19] but back to the original grain the
[10:22] original seed the original word amen and
[10:27] that word
[10:28] is none other but jesus christ himself
[10:33] so when we speak about the restoration
[10:37] of the church
[10:39] we speak about the return of jesus
[10:43] christ
[10:44] we're really talking about the seed
[10:47] going through its cycle dies goes into
[10:51] the ground goes through its cycle what
[10:54] planting watering growing nourishing
[10:58] and now
[10:59] back to when it comes back as an
[11:02] original seed but now
[11:05] in a multiplied form
[11:08] not in the form of the headship of jesus
[11:12] christ but in the multi-pride form of a
[11:16] bride a bride hallelujah praise god for
[11:21] the two are one as adam and eve their
[11:25] name was called adam oh thanks be to god
[11:30] for this wonderful day in which we live
[11:34] praise god jesus said
[11:38] behold
[11:40] i come quickly and that makes the age of
[11:44] laodicea
[11:45] which is to follow
[11:47] this philadelphian church age
[11:51] it's the age of a quick work
[11:55] it is going to be cut short
[11:59] cut short for the elect's sake
[12:02] that a this age
[12:04] of love this year
[12:06] will be cut short
[12:08] watch therefore
[12:10] you know what not when our lord shall
[12:12] come
[12:15] when you least expect
[12:17] he comes upon the scene
[12:20] and takes his waiting bride away
[12:23] north thief keeps noise to let you know
[12:27] he's coming
[12:29] but the thief slips in
[12:31] and slips out
[12:33] hallelujah a certain secret catching
[12:36] away
[12:38] of this last day bride of jesus christ
[12:41] oh praise god hallelujah i pray god that
[12:46] you are elected to be a part of of her
[12:50] oh blessed be his marvelous and
[12:54] wonderful name
[12:56] he said
[12:58] behold i set before the unopened door
[13:02] and no man can shut it hallelujah
[13:07] well of course the open door
[13:10] signifies the tremendous missionary
[13:14] efforts
[13:16] that occurred during this church age of
[13:20] philadelphia
[13:22] of course paul in second corinthians 2
[13:25] 12
[13:27] paul called the new missionary endeavor
[13:29] for the lord and open door listen
[13:35] furthermore
[13:36] when i came to truass
[13:38] to preach christ's gospel
[13:41] a door was opened unto me
[13:46] of the lord or praise god so we clearly
[13:50] see the meaning of the open door of
[13:53] missionary endeavor missionary works
[13:57] that will be carried on and was carried
[13:59] on during this age of course god works
[14:04] in the number three
[14:06] so we find here in the pergamus church
[14:10] age
[14:11] how that the church in that church age
[14:15] was married to the state
[14:17] there was a state and church union
[14:21] which it which it carries on unto this
[14:24] day
[14:25] state and church
[14:27] and the deeds of the nickelodeons
[14:30] became the doctrine of the nicolaitans
[14:35] this
[14:36] time
[14:37] during this
[14:39] pergamos church age
[14:42] it was an age of open door
[14:45] for the false vine
[14:49] but thanks be to god
[14:51] do during this age of philadelphia
[14:55] it is an open door for the true vine the
[14:59] true believers and the elect of god
[15:03] for as the false vine had an open door
[15:07] to spread and spew their
[15:10] lives spawn their systems
[15:14] of evil
[15:16] so
[15:17] is
[15:18] the
[15:19] true
[15:20] vine
[15:21] given an open door
[15:23] for the spreading of the truth
[15:26] that it might go forth
[15:29] reaching the hearts
[15:31] and lives of all those who will believe
[15:36] the promise of this hour thanks be to
[15:39] god
[15:40] yes
[15:41] they had their time
[15:44] of higher keys
[15:46] setting up their systems
[15:48] which spread like wildfire
[15:52] and three ages later
[15:55] after a long and a hard struggle
[15:58] we find that the open door comes to the
[16:03] for people to be open to the truth in
[16:06] other words god says i'll i'll open the
[16:08] door to the truth
[16:10] that evil cannot prevail continue to
[16:13] prevail
[16:14] over you hallelujah praise god and so
[16:20] the age the fifth age
[16:23] was an age that gave us exploration
[16:27] it gave us communism
[16:30] gave us colonization
[16:33] gave us the printing of books
[16:36] and so on
[16:38] was a great age
[16:39] but god opened the door
[16:42] for the spreading of
[16:44] the truth and i thank god for it now
[16:48] in the book of mark the gospel of mark
[16:52] chapter 16
[16:54] verses 15 to 20
[16:57] and he said unto them go ye into all the
[17:01] world
[17:02] and preach the gospel to every creature
[17:06] he that believeth
[17:07] and is baptized
[17:10] shall be saved
[17:12] and he that believeth not
[17:14] shall be damned
[17:17] and these signs
[17:19] shall follow them that believe
[17:22] in my name
[17:25] shall they cast out devils
[17:28] they shall speak with new tongues
[17:31] they shall take up serpents
[17:34] and if they drink
[17:36] any deadly thing
[17:40] it shall not hurt them
[17:43] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[17:46] they shall recover
[17:48] o praise god so then after the lord has
[17:51] spoken unto them he was received up into
[17:55] heaven and sat on the right hand of god
[17:59] and they went forth preaching everywhere
[18:02] the lord
[18:04] working with them
[18:06] and confirming the word
[18:09] with signs following hallelujah now
[18:12] notice carefully
[18:14] he never told them now they're in the
[18:17] edge the open door is here the door is
[18:20] open for the spread of the truth and he
[18:23] never told them
[18:24] go ye
[18:26] and establish bible colleges
[18:30] goyi
[18:31] and
[18:32] open up great seminaries
[18:35] goyi
[18:37] build great monasteries everywhere in
[18:41] colleges
[18:42] oh no he did not say goyi
[18:46] and give out tracts
[18:49] spread literatures everywhere that the
[18:52] people may know that i am the christ
[18:55] amen now all those things as i have
[18:58] spoken of they're all fine they're
[19:01] wonderful
[19:03] but what jesus told them
[19:05] was to preach the gospel
[19:08] go and be witnesses unto me
[19:12] stick with the word stay with the word
[19:15] of god and then when you do that these
[19:19] signs shall follow them
[19:22] that will believe the word of god
[19:26] hallelujah amen
[19:28] many
[19:29] people have the idea
[19:31] that the ministry given to the apostles
[19:34] has already died out
[19:37] it's not here anymore
[19:39] but i beg to differ
[19:42] amen
[19:43] the ministry apostolic ministry
[19:47] signs wonders miracles preaching of the
[19:50] truth jesus the christ risen from the
[19:53] dead alive forevermore and we are
[19:57] witnesses of these things that message
[20:01] and the confirmation and vindication
[20:04] is still here with us and it is taking
[20:08] place around the world that he is jesus
[20:12] christ the same yesterday today and
[20:16] forever for this i give him praise honor
[20:20] and glory that he has not changed but
[20:23] he's alive forever more oh bless his
[20:27] holy name
[20:29] down to the ages
[20:31] we cannot deny the apostolic power
[20:36] continued on
[20:38] anointing and using
[20:40] men like philip
[20:44] who would dare to deny the ministries
[20:48] of men like irenaeus
[20:52] saint martin
[20:56] columba
[20:59] saint patrick
[21:01] and countless others
[21:03] that god chose to use
[21:06] with his mighty anointing upon them
[21:10] using them for his glory and for his
[21:13] honor hallelujah amen
[21:16] the bible way
[21:19] is the believer's way
[21:22] the bible way
[21:24] is god's open door for every true
[21:28] believer of the living god hallelujah
[21:32] amen i know for a shortie that jesus
[21:36] christ is the same yesterday forever and
[21:39] the power of god is still available to
[21:43] those who will believe and receive it in
[21:48] his great and mighty name hallelujah a
[21:53] matter of fact no man ought to be out
[21:56] there
[21:58] on the mission field
[22:00] preaching the gospel
[22:02] unless
[22:04] he's filled with the holy ghost
[22:07] and preaching the true gospel
[22:11] hallelujah
[22:12] and preaching it in the demonstration
[22:16] of the parable mighty god moving
[22:19] hallelujah power of the holy ghost and
[22:23] if you're not seeing
[22:24] such results
[22:26] you're not seeing that in your life
[22:29] it's because you're not preaching the
[22:31] true gospel
[22:32] back to the word back to the original
[22:35] seed back to the original life let the
[22:38] lord have his way in your life today
[22:41] before behold i set before thee an open
[22:46] door blessed be god hallelujah glory to
[22:50] his name
[22:52] now getting back to
[22:55] the missionary door of this philadelphia
[22:59] age
[23:01] this age was a wonderful missionary age
[23:05] or an age of missionary exploits
[23:09] but it did not have the open door
[23:13] of the
[23:14] demonstrated power of almighty god
[23:18] that it ought to have
[23:20] for the bible mentions
[23:23] for thou hast a little strength there
[23:27] were a few
[23:28] that had the parent presence of god with
[23:31] them
[23:32] but in general
[23:35] that age had little strength
[23:39] oh praise god forevermore the word was
[23:43] preached
[23:45] but the power of the spirit
[23:47] was missing
[23:49] in that age
[23:52] they were anointed
[23:54] to make souls wise unto salvation
[24:00] but the great power of god
[24:02] that showed itself
[24:05] and shot shot his micey works
[24:08] and bearing his arm of strength on
[24:11] behalf of his own was missing
[24:14] except
[24:16] among a few small scattered groups of
[24:19] people who god wanted to use yet we
[24:22] praise god for this age yet we give god
[24:26] for this glorious age
[24:28] where
[24:29] man
[24:30] like william carey
[24:32] who was called the uh father of modern
[24:36] missions from the baptist church of
[24:39] molten england was used of god for that
[24:44] with that great purpose
[24:47] i have set before thee
[24:49] an open door hallelujah
[24:53] oh yes
[24:54] it was in this age my friends
[24:57] that revelation
[24:59] 3 8 speaks of
[25:02] open door then it says little strength
[25:06] word
[25:08] name
[25:09] hallelujah so the open door has to do
[25:12] with all these other three things
[25:17] the open door of course signifies what
[25:22] it signifies john 10 7
[25:26] and jesus said verily verily i say unto
[25:30] you
[25:31] i
[25:32] am the door of the sheepfold behold i've
[25:37] set before you an open door
[25:40] and now
[25:41] john 10 7 says i
[25:44] am the door of the sheepfold hallelujah
[25:50] so the i am
[25:52] is
[25:53] the door
[25:54] of the sheep oh praise god
[25:58] so he gives this parable to about
[26:00] himself as a shepherd and calls himself
[26:04] the door
[26:06] and that is what a real shepherd is
[26:09] to the sheep
[26:11] you have to get past the shepherd to get
[26:14] to the sheep so jesus is actually
[26:18] the door to the sheepfold
[26:21] lord said that over in the east eastern
[26:25] part of the world a shepherd would
[26:27] gather his sheep together and he would
[26:29] put them in a fold and when they're
[26:32] there he'll conquer them he'll see it's
[26:34] night and then what would he do he would
[26:38] lay down across that doorway
[26:42] making himself the door
[26:45] that none could come out or none go in
[26:50] because he is the door
[26:54] and
[26:55] it said
[26:56] that often time in the mornings
[27:00] he'd get up and take his sheep
[27:02] and while he's going he'll pass by some
[27:05] of the markets or bazaars
[27:08] and they're all mineral goodies there
[27:11] you would think those sheep would run
[27:13] and try to grab those goodies but now
[27:16] good sheep keep their eyes on their
[27:19] shepherd shepherd
[27:21] they follow the shepherd and don't run
[27:24] everywhere and when if you are genuine
[27:28] truly born again true believers of the
[27:32] message of this hour then you belong to
[27:36] the great shepherd
[27:39] you'll follow the great shepherd only
[27:42] right in his footsteps
[27:44] just as those sheep did
[27:47] you won't be tempted
[27:49] to turn aside leaning to your own
[27:51] understanding
[27:53] turn aside we are all judgments
[27:56] amen
[27:58] oh turn aside attracted by some big
[28:02] shining perfume flower option theology
[28:06] or church
[28:07] listening to the voice
[28:09] of some dd phd or ld some popular
[28:14] preacher of your day you won't do that
[28:18] you'll stay with the shepherd you'll
[28:21] stare with the voice
[28:23] of god in these last days
[28:26] for the bible says my sheep know my
[28:29] voice
[28:30] and a stranger
[28:32] listen a stranger they will not follow
[28:38] a vo
[28:39] a matter of fact a stranger's voice will
[28:42] cause them to flee and run into the arms
[28:46] of their shepherd all glory hallelujah
[28:49] praise god i'll run to him anytime all
[28:53] the time for he is my lord and he is the
[28:57] shepherd
[28:58] of the sheepfold praise god hallelujah
[29:02] now when we come to think of the word or
[29:05] the name shepherd
[29:08] it does not only apply
[29:10] to sheep
[29:14] but do you understand that a man can be
[29:16] a preacher
[29:18] or a so-called shepherd
[29:21] and yet he is a shepherd
[29:23] or a preacher to muse
[29:27] he can be a shepherd to pigs
[29:30] a shepherd to goats
[29:32] a preacher to camels virtually speaking
[29:37] oh my
[29:38] you see
[29:40] a shepherd is one that just my friends
[29:44] grazes
[29:45] herds
[29:47] animals together
[29:49] that person is then called a shepherd
[29:54] while the other shepherds of those other
[29:57] herds
[29:58] will go to their homes
[30:01] and leave their
[30:03] herds whether pigs or goats or mules out
[30:07] in the fields while they go to their
[30:09] homes and rest the true shepherd
[30:12] will lay across the doorway
[30:15] where his sheep are
[30:17] and be right there with them to protect
[30:20] them speak to them
[30:23] and calm them
[30:25] down praise god i want to thank god that
[30:29] jesus is the door
[30:31] and then when the night time of lordisia
[30:34] comes that he will be with us there
[30:38] protecting us caring for us for he is
[30:41] the door of the sheep
[30:45] now
[30:46] the door he said before i set before the
[30:49] unopened door watch it now the door is
[30:53] opening and he claims he is the door
[30:56] what is he speaking of the time coming
[30:59] when he would open the door of
[31:02] revelation of himself for he is the door
[31:06] praise god hallelujah amen oh my that is
[31:11] nothing but a revelation
[31:14] of himself
[31:16] and the revelation is opening up
[31:19] to give you what strengths that
[31:22] strengths could pour out of the word of
[31:26] god into your heart so that you might be
[31:30] able to wrestle against or not flesh and
[31:34] blood but against
[31:36] principalities powers spiritual
[31:38] wickedness
[31:40] demons
[31:41] devils and religious realm of the
[31:44] religious places of a higher ranking
[31:47] than just the regular devil that you
[31:50] will meet when you pray for the sick but
[31:53] these are now enticing spirits religious
[31:56] devils dressed up
[31:59] counterfeit and covered with religious
[32:02] garb religious speech religious words
[32:05] but contrary to the word of the living
[32:09] god and so
[32:11] this great revelation of himself
[32:15] is to give us strength
[32:17] by him
[32:19] illuminating or giving us light
[32:22] upon the word
[32:24] and as the word opens up
[32:26] it gives us strength
[32:29] to meet the challenge of this hour
[32:32] that in the midst we can glorify his
[32:36] great and mighty and wonderful name
[32:40] hallelujah isn't that wonderful friends
[32:43] isn't this a marvelous hour to recognize
[32:47] what god is doing hallelujah amen was in
[32:52] the midst
[32:54] of these last two ages
[32:57] that the deity of jesus christ
[33:00] began to blossom forth back into the
[33:03] knowledge
[33:05] of the people
[33:07] that followed the word of god amen
[33:11] we knew that jesus christ
[33:15] was and his god
[33:18] amen
[33:19] how else could he be your savior
[33:22] god is our savior
[33:24] god is our salvation salvation is of the
[33:27] lord redemption is of the lord oh
[33:30] hallelujah but we know that he is our
[33:35] only god
[33:37] our only savior
[33:40] that jesus christ is god
[33:43] alone
[33:45] that he is our alpha
[33:47] he's our omega
[33:50] he's wonderful counsel almighty god
[33:53] everlasting father
[33:55] prince of peace the bright and the
[33:57] morning star amen the babe born in a
[34:01] manger the word born back there in flesh
[34:05] in that day but there we see him born
[34:09] again the word born again hallelujah
[34:14] when it came down and made itself known
[34:17] in the heart of a prophet the manger of
[34:20] a heart and now the word has come to
[34:24] coming to its full stature going through
[34:26] its cycle ready to go out in a rapture
[34:30] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[34:32] hallelujah amen
[34:35] god alone
[34:36] that jesus this jesus is both lord and
[34:40] christ
[34:42] making jesus christ

[34:46] son
[34:47] and holy ghost
[34:49] in one
[34:50] praise god one person hallelujah thank
[34:55] god amen and that truth
[34:59] was lost since the first or earliest
[35:03] church ages
[35:05] and just it was destroyed and taken away
[35:09] by the false vine
[35:12] oh
[35:13] thank god that he's opening up the door
[35:18] now we are seeing it
[35:20] again
[35:21] in our midst
[35:23] the revelation
[35:25] of who he was and who he is
[35:29] is back in the church again
[35:31] back in my heart again
[35:33] back in your heart again if you can see
[35:36] what we're i'm talking about indeed the
[35:40] godhead is not a tree person god
[35:45] let me repeat that
[35:47] that the god we serve is not a tree
[35:51] person god
[35:54] with one
[35:56] personality where it takes
[35:59] a personality to make a person
[36:03] amen
[36:04] there is one personality only
[36:08] and there is one person from that
[36:12] amen and we believe that one person of
[36:15] god is jesus christ
[36:18] many others believe
[36:22] in three persons being
[36:25] in a three-person godhead
[36:28] and they are guilty of breaking god's
[36:31] first commandment
[36:33] hero israel the lord thy god is one lord
[36:38] amen the lord god is a jealous god
[36:42] no other gods before me thou shalt not
[36:45] bow down before them nor serve them
[36:49] that's the word of god as god spoke even
[36:52] in the old testament but thank god the
[36:56] revelation of god the godhead is back
[37:00] amen i said the revelation of the
[37:03] godhead is back praise god now the true
[37:06] church on the basis of the opening door
[37:10] open door of the word and of the
[37:13] revelation of who god is that he is
[37:16] jesus christ is now
[37:19] recapturing and regaining our strength
[37:24] amen hallelujah and all this time
[37:28] she knows
[37:29] now fully who her lord is who her god is
[37:34] and once again we're baptizing
[37:38] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[37:41] for jesus himself told us to baptize in
[37:44] that name
[37:46] when he says baptize them in the
[37:49] the name
[37:50] one name of the father son and holy
[37:53] ghost
[37:54] and i know peter understood that so when
[37:57] he was asked
[38:00] peter unto what shall we be baptized and
[38:03] he said you baptize them in the name of
[38:06] the lord jesus christ hallelujah amen
[38:10] praise god just as they did on the day
[38:14] of pentecost or praise god forevermore
[38:18] hallelujah if you will look from genesis
[38:21] 1 1 to revelation 22 1 which is to say
[38:26] from cover to cover of the entire bible
[38:29] the only thing you can see is one god
[38:34] if you are seeing three then you've got
[38:37] a blur you see in stars you've got
[38:40] amnesia you hit your head and you don't
[38:43] know what you're seeing oh lord have
[38:46] mercy the people have been blinded by
[38:50] this foul
[38:52] trinitarian dark spirit of dogmas
[38:55] god have mercy yes sir and that dogma is
[39:00] so universally accepted
[39:04] that when anyone preaches or teaches
[39:06] like this
[39:08] back to the word
[39:10] check even your original history
[39:13] check way back as you can
[39:16] you will find
[39:18] that even in the catholic church
[39:20] at one time they're baptized in the name
[39:24] of the lord jesus christ
[39:26] they know it
[39:27] but they have changed their so-called
[39:30] unchanging god
[39:32] they have changed it but god never
[39:34] changes god never lies god knows his
[39:38] word and he stays with the word let
[39:40] every man be a liar and let my word be
[39:45] the truth amen
[39:46] oh yes
[39:48] oh praise god it's almost
[39:52] a struggle
[39:53] to get
[39:55] persons to see
[39:57] the revelation of one god
[40:00] one god
[40:02] amen
[40:03] if people can't see the truth of the
[40:05] godhead
[40:07] they'll fight it
[40:09] they'll fight you or fight that truth
[40:12] if they can't see it
[40:15] they can't ever see the rest of the
[40:17] truth
[40:19] and if they can't see
[40:21] the revelation of the godhead
[40:24] they can't see the rest of the truth
[40:27] amen
[40:28] because the revelation of jesus christ
[40:33] in his church
[40:35] under his works
[40:38] through the ages
[40:40] in the midst
[40:42] of the church for the chapter changes
[40:45] will not be clear in their hearts and
[40:49] minds
[40:51] revelation 3 8

[40:56] and has kept my
[40:58] word
[41:00] and has not denied
[41:02] my name hallelujah the strength
[41:06] returning
[41:08] by the return of the revelation of the
[41:11] word
[41:12] strength is returning into the church
[41:16] dunamis
[41:17] of acts 1 8
[41:20] acts 2 4 is returned to the church of
[41:23] god but you shall receive power after
[41:27] that the holy ghost is come upon you and

[41:39] truth
[41:40] the power of the inquisition had waned
[41:44] the philadelphia church age was on the
[41:46] rise
[41:48] many people left their homelands
[41:52] traveled across the seas
[41:54] demanding freedom of worship which was
[41:57] one of the causes
[41:59] of the french
[42:00] revolution
[42:02] for the york of hierarchies
[42:05] was being broken
[42:07] governments
[42:08] were finding it wise not to take one
[42:11] side or the other
[42:13] but to stand there just as a government
[42:16] within the middle
[42:18] amen
[42:20] poorly led people
[42:22] were marching for their
[42:24] rights
[42:25] their religious rights
[42:27] france as you know fell in the
[42:30] revolution but thank god
[42:33] because of the revival
[42:35] of the ministry of john wesley britain
[42:39] was spared that kind of a problem and so
[42:43] god was able to use britain
[42:47] as his instrument
[42:50] in his hand for many many glorious years
[42:54] before they began to rain the preaching
[42:58] of the word was never greater
[43:01] but while the word was growing greater
[43:05] satan was raising up hordes
[43:07] masses
[43:09] black clouds of mosquito theologians
[43:13] claiming that they had uh that could be
[43:16] called cannons when they had nothing but
[43:19] pipsqueak

[43:25] dynamite of revelation
[43:27] of acts 2 4 you shall receive power
[43:31] after the holy ghost has come upon you
[43:33] brought in all manner of multitudes of
[43:37] free sinkers
[43:41] liberal theologians
[43:44] and these days
[43:45] he's infected even the so-called
[43:48] conservative theologians
[43:51] spreading their filthy rotten
[43:54] unscriptural wares contrary to the word
