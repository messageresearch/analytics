[17:17] that
[17:18] you made a way for us to be here
[17:22] lord search my heart don't leave mine
[17:25] out and say the heart of your children
[17:28] if any one of us has disbelieved you in
[17:31] any way shape or form
[17:33] father we ask for forgiveness
[17:36] because the blood of christ it washes us
[17:38] from all unbelief
[17:40] father may your spiritual control
[17:43] take me aside
[17:45] help me to say something
[17:48] that will help your children
[17:50] father anything all id we come against
[17:53] it in the name of jesus christ
[17:55] may your great holy ghost have
[17:57] permanence
[17:58] with the same pillar of fire that was
[18:01] following the prophet ministry
[18:03] may come and speak to our heart again
[18:06] but i thank you for the victory
[18:09] in jesus name amen
[18:12] and i think we continue the same
[18:13] scripture we are doing the part two of
[18:16] praying throughout
[18:18] the day
[18:19] and the scripture i used that time was
[18:21] ephesians 6 18.
[18:23] um
[18:28] grace do you have that slide on
[18:29] ephesians 6 18
[18:36] yeah it says that
[18:38] pray in the spirit at all times with all
[18:41] kinds of prayers
[18:42] ask them for everything you need to do
[18:44] this you must always be ready and never
[18:47] give up and always pray for all god's
[18:49] people please be seated
[18:53] and
[18:54] the other time we talk about it
[19:00] we talk about praying all that because
[19:03] we have
[19:04] um
[19:05] two types of prayer
[19:09] that you can do through your day one day
[19:11] you make a schedule
[19:13] another one that is a continuous prayer
[19:16] throughout the day
[19:17] and i think breakfast i forgot but chris
[19:20] was able to
[19:22] clarify it more right
[19:25] by saying that
[19:27] this is not a law i had wanted to say
[19:30] that at times
[19:32] and
[19:33] it's not like in stone or you don't want
[19:35] a situation that when you're going to
[19:38] work and you've slept you're going to
[19:40] felt guilty that you didn't pray
[19:42] so you want to take all those elements
[19:44] out and make sure that we're doing this
[19:47] by the grace and the love of god and the
[19:50] prophet of god all said that if you make
[19:52] a schedule time and you pray
[19:54] consistently respect god will meet you
[19:56] on those times
[19:58] if you're on time the angel of god will
[19:59] be there before you so it has to be
[20:01] taken in balance you don't want to like
[20:03] go on way off so that's why i was i
[20:06] wanted to bring
[20:07] our attention to it and
[20:09] back to that i remembered one time
[20:12] i went to a barber shop
[20:14] and then in the baba shop
[20:17] something came up and i talked about
[20:20] lord says right no man i don't say the
[20:21] best something came so i have to speak
[20:24] and somebody just came in
[20:26] and he had a conversation
[20:28] he said i wanted to have against
[20:30] christians
[20:32] is that they said that if you don't go
[20:34] to church
[20:35] you go to hell you go to church you go
[20:37] to heaven
[20:38] and i said oh you speak the wrong person
[20:41] because i'll go through a pastor has
[20:43] thought it's right and not only has the
[20:46] personal thought there's everything god
[20:48] has also revealed to me so it has become
[20:51] personalized to me so i can talk like on
[20:54] first and experience and i said no
[20:56] um
[20:57] you're talking the wrong person because
[21:00] yes i go to church yes i paid my sight
[21:03] yes i paid my offering yes i do all
[21:06] those things but i'm not doing it as a
[21:09] duty and i'm not doing because i want to
[21:11] escape hell
[21:13] i'm doing this because i love god if i
[21:16] look what the lord has done for me
[21:20] he left all his throne
[21:22] the beauty
[21:24] everything that he had he left it and
[21:27] came down to shed his blood to save as
[21:29] soon as i said such as i
[21:32] nothing that i can do
[21:34] to pay him back
[21:36] so this little things that i do i do it
[21:38] out of appreciation of my heart for what
[21:41] god has done for me
[21:43] i can't pay him back i ordered that i
[21:45] could not pay you know so
[21:47] as i spoke in that fight the guy said my
[21:50] goodness i haven't heard this in this
[21:54] passion before
[21:56] now you're hearing it
[21:58] amen our god is awesome
[22:01] praise god so um
[22:03] just to recap we talk about praying all
[22:06] the time having the schedules and then
[22:09] you also talk about um why it's
[22:11] important that you try to pray in the
[22:13] morning because
[22:14] um
[22:15] they have make research to show that
[22:18] your attitude during the first eight
[22:20] minutes in the morning affect the rest
[22:22] of your day and then you also talk about
[22:25] how you have to put god's face the
[22:26] kingdom of god with the elisha and all
[22:29] those things so today we're gonna move
[22:32] further on
[22:33] give me slight number 20.
[22:49] slide number 20. i think i said give us
[22:53] today our daily bread
[23:01] okay yeah
[23:04] okay that's fine so
[23:06] it's said
[23:08] yeah give us our daily bread yeah my two
[23:10] sisters living and then
[23:12] the way he did they said in the lunch
[23:13] time that's where you have to list your
[23:16] petitions the things that you have need
[23:18] of
[23:19] and the
[23:20] bread type so many things you have the
[23:23] bread of life
[23:25] breath
[23:26] for our
[23:27] natural
[23:30] substances
[23:31] you need the bread to eat breast like a
[23:33] food and the bible said that mind shall
[23:36] not eat by bread alone
[23:38] but by every word that came out from the
[23:41] word of god
[23:42] so bread is important without you
[23:45] eating
[23:47] a day or without you taking natural food
[23:49] in your system you're going to die
[23:52] you cannot survive you can survive
[23:54] without food for a couple of years
[23:56] days or weeks but you can't survive
[23:58] without water so you need bread in your
[24:01] life to sustain you naturally so in the
[24:04] spiritual realm you need the bread of
[24:06] god the word of god
[24:08] and it has to be balanced and
[24:10] i was thinking about it and last week a
[24:13] thought came to my mind someone who
[24:15] didn't want to take the
[24:17] the shot the vaccine
[24:19] and the scripture came to my heart was
[24:21] they were saying that
[24:23] when
[24:24] he said that fear not who will kill
[24:27] this body
[24:29] fear was able to destroy both the body
[24:31] and soul so what is happening is that
[24:34] people are putting so much emphasis on
[24:36] the natural body which there's nothing
[24:38] wrong taking care of your body but it
[24:40] doesn't matter how much you take care of
[24:42] this body one day you're gonna leave it
[24:44] on the ground
[24:47] you we take care of faith we i do
[24:49] outside but it's important but no matter
[24:51] how you take care of it one day you're
[24:53] gonna leave it here but the bible said
[24:55] they saw that senate
[24:57] that social died so you need to feed on
[25:01] the word of god for your sustenance of
[25:04] your soul because man shall not live on
[25:07] bread alone but on everywhere that
[25:09] proceeds out of the mouth of god as a
[25:12] revelation of the world that's what you
[25:14] need to keep your spiritual active
[25:18] amen so you have to take into
[25:20] consideration and have a balanced life
[25:23] hey man we not
[25:24] want people to be too much spiritual and
[25:28] not good in the natural life and we
[25:30] don't want to be too much natural or not
[25:33] goodness spiritual life they always they
[25:35] have to be a balance
[25:37] amen so they have to have to balance
[25:39] both your natural and your spiritual
[25:41] life
[25:42] so you need the word of god and the
[25:44] scriptures give us our this day our
[25:48] daily bread that means that the present
[25:50] truth
[25:51] present daily bread the word for today
[25:54] not yesterday where do not do because
[25:57] the children of israel the mana they
[26:00] were supposed to eat it
[26:02] fresh and don't keep it for the next day
[26:05] the next day is going to be perish so
[26:07] you need the manner for the day the
[26:09] present truth the present stage of his
[26:13] ministry
[26:14] it is not the s-u-n day son of god day
[26:19] sunday is a cess or end day when he
[26:22] resurrected on the first day of the week
[26:24] who is the eighth day which is the
[26:26] eighth day the eternal church age now is
[26:30] the mighty angel
[26:32] riding the trail through the bride once
[26:34] more amen because not we fiscally in the
[26:37] seventh
[26:38] eighth the nordician they said that you
[26:40] are so changed didn't it the spirit is
[26:43] your source on the eighth day eternal
[26:46] church and back to the first day it was
[26:48] the eighth day so we are no more in the
[26:50] seventh the body you are so um you say
[26:54] change that you are living you say you
[26:56] are in heaven sit in heavenly places in
[26:59] christ jesus amen so we are not the
[27:02] mighty angel who is riding the trail
[27:05] through the bride of christ amen praise
[27:08] god
[27:09] that god was in the prophet of god
[27:12] and that same god who was the prophet of
[27:15] god when god took his prophet he didn't
[27:18] take his spirit
[27:19] and that's why elisha asked elijah i
[27:22] want a double portion of your spirit
[27:24] amen so it's elijah elijah it's elijah
[27:28] time now it's a spirit of christ in the
[27:30] bride the same god
[27:33] who was in the prophet is that same god
[27:37] leading the bride again because it says
[27:39] that this marriage of the lamb is come
[27:42] and his wife has made herself ready amen
[27:46] praise god so it's a present stage
[27:49] of his
[27:52] ministry eagles eat fresh food
[27:57] hallelujah
[27:59] the man that fell for luke will not work
[28:03] for today
[28:04] the one that fell for wesley was not for
[28:07] our day the one that went for pentecost
[28:10] is not going to work for a day it is a
[28:12] present stage of his ministry amen and
[28:15] on the day of pentecost
[28:18] they were justified they were satisfied
[28:20] they were filled the holy ghost him and
[28:23] the bride of christ also are justified
[28:25] in the sight of god we are satisfied we
[28:28] have the baptism all over you have the
[28:30] holy ghost himself in the bride leading
[28:33] him to
[28:34] walk back to god again amen so you need
[28:37] that fresh the fresh anointing the fresh
[28:41] way because
[28:42] we are in a different age
[28:45] so you need that present truth
[28:48] to confront your day
[28:50] without that you can't make it amen
[28:52] because the eagles can go all high the
[28:54] house will just fall and vote as
[28:57] on
[29:04] on the word of god the freshman of god
[29:06] for today
[29:08] amen eternal church is a said mighty
[29:11] angel was in the revelation 1 came into
[29:14] revelation revelation 10 1 came to
[29:16] revelation 10 7 to reveal the seals amen
[29:20] is the mighty angel amen that is eternal
[29:24] church age hallelujah praise god
[29:28] thank you jesus hallelujah give me slide
[29:31] number 21

[30:00] my name
[30:02] hallelujah
[30:04] why
[30:05] you can ask for anything in mind
[30:08] anything you ask my name you'll get it
[30:10] so what is happening is that as the
[30:12] beginning of this 40-day series bradley
[30:15] advised us to write all our needs
[30:18] is that right so this one is the bank of
[30:20] heaven
[30:21] and pastor gave us this about a couple
[30:23] of years ago and i can testify of faith
[30:26] that everything that i wrote on it
[30:29] it might not happen on that same day or
[30:32] but after a while i go back to check all
[30:34] those things i wrote that back of
[30:36] chairman check
[30:37] everything came forth i can see god
[30:40] manifest himself through all that amen
[30:43] and god used blood um
[30:46] tim last week to let us know that
[30:49] god doesn't always say yes sometimes you
[30:52] say no
[30:53] but if you really love god
[30:56] you will also rejoice the same way he
[30:58] say no and yes your rejoice has to be
[31:02] the same that shows your love of god
[31:04] amen because whether i say no yes you're
[31:06] still gonna rejoice anyhow anyways
[31:09] because it's the same yesterday today
[31:12] and forever so he said you can ask for
[31:15] anything in my name i will grant it
[31:18] there's nothing that god do not grant
[31:20] for you so you have to if you have
[31:24] written things down and has not been met
[31:27] yet don't give up
[31:30] keep them there and pray over it
[31:33] it will come to pass
[31:35] one day those things you see them happen
[31:38] because your prayers he said god will
[31:40] say yes or sometimes you can say wait
[31:43] and sometimes no
[31:45] so i wrote them i wrote a lot
[31:48] and i can testify
[31:51] of that god
[31:53] gave i said every one of them after
[31:56] years back i'll go back and i read them
[31:58] so wow so if you have some
[32:00] you can still write them if you don't
[32:02] have it that's fine so i read this
[32:04] quotation here
[32:05] um
[32:07] yeah twenties whatsoever you asked
[32:10] the father in my name
[32:13] i will do it
[32:15] every promise in the books belongs to
[32:18] you
[32:19] when you are saved
[32:22] he gives you a check with his name
[32:25] wrote at the bottom of it that check was
[32:27] there his name was sweetheart
[32:28] don't be afraid to fill it out
[32:31] cause the bank of heaven will recognize
[32:33] it if it goes through the pentecostal
[32:36] clearing house
[32:38] see
[32:39] that's right
[32:40] see if you got something
[32:42] here on your deposit yourself
[32:46] if you are recognized if you got
[32:49] identification to show that check
[32:51] belongs to you it's only for believers
[32:55] now if you got that identification
[32:59] why god will recognize your check
[33:03] that's right no matter what you ask for
[33:05] any redemptive blessings belongs to
[33:09] you
[33:11] amen
[33:12] hallelujah
[33:14] oh that redemptive blessing belongs to
[33:16] you
[33:17] amen praise so ask for anything
[33:20] and god will grant it to you
[33:22] and if your motive is right
[33:25] and your objective is right god will
[33:28] grant it why do you want god to heal you
[33:31] some people they want god to heal them
[33:33] and go back to dance
[33:34] it won't work
[33:36] all the people i'm just speaking the
[33:38] people on the youtube like wherever you
[33:40] are
[33:41] you want god to heal you you have to
[33:42] give me a reason
[33:44] hezekiah told god
[33:46] that i need 15 years more
[33:48] to what to prepare my house
[33:51] so you must have a reason why you want
[33:54] god to do certain things for you and if
[33:57] that reason lines up with his word and
[34:00] your motive is right your objective is
[34:02] right god will grant it to you
[34:05] it doesn't matter what it is
[34:08] he's more than able
[34:10] to what answer all your requests that's
[34:14] why i said if you ask anything
[34:17] in my name
[34:19] i
[34:20] will grant it to you
[34:23] so no matter what you have made of
[34:25] tonight
[34:26] you ask him
[34:28] he's able to grant all
[34:31] your needs
[34:33] because my god has never changed
[34:35] he's the same yesterday today and
[34:38] forever he will not give some people ice
[34:40] cream
[34:41] and you come there he's gonna give you a
[34:43] different thing you give me the same if
[34:45] you come the same that's why he told ken
[34:48] if you have done what your brother has
[34:50] done
[34:51] i will have answered your request i will
[34:53] have a testify of yours
[34:55] so he will show him to follow what is
[34:57] better date
[34:58] so if you are doing stuff if you see god
[35:01] is blessing somebody and the way the
[35:03] person that if you go that same way and
[35:05] you have right objective god
[35:09] is able to give it to you because it's
[35:11] not an indian giver he will give you
[35:13] something take it back
[35:15] and he give to others he'll give it to
[35:18] you too amen because god loves everybody
[35:22] he's
[35:23] he's not like um what do you call some
[35:25] parents that have their favorites or
[35:28] this he loves us all the same he treats
[35:30] us all the same you come the same way
[35:32] he's gonna treat you exactly
[35:35] by the word of god
[35:37] so the word is the main thing the
[35:40] revelation of the word how much the word
[35:42] has revealed to you and how much you can
[35:45] take
[35:46] it's according to the level of your
[35:48] faith some people have that fail to
[35:50] receive one billion one million some
[35:52] must have a little faith maybe thousand
[35:54] ten times is enough for them so it
[35:56] depends on how much you want
[35:59] it depends on how much you can take
[36:01] and also god will give you something
[36:03] that's going to be a burden on you he
[36:06] knows what you can take he knows how
[36:08] what you can handle
[36:10] so we give you according to the measure
[36:12] of your faith so that i don't be a
[36:14] burden on you it won't be something to
[36:17] be a stumbling block
[36:19] amen
[36:20] he's awesome god
[36:22] hallelujah our god is good praise god
[36:28] hallelujah
[36:29] amen grace give me slight 24
[36:32] hope i'm on the same page with you
[36:39] okay so
[36:41] that's right
[36:43] so
[36:45] i'll be standing against the lord if i
[36:46] fail to pray for you
[36:48] as believers we need to pray for one
[36:51] another
[36:52] it's very very important that satisfies
[36:54] somebody say that i'll be saying
[36:57] against the lord if i fail to pray for
[37:00] you
[37:01] because
[37:02] sometimes we got caught up in our own
[37:05] word in our own situation and forget
[37:07] about the need of others so we need to
[37:10] pray for one that is very very important
[37:14] and then i think
[37:16] give me
[37:17] 24 24 25. i could go 25.
[37:24] okay you missed this one that's fine um
[37:27] he said that as for what other people
[37:29] need to intersection
[37:31] you need to intercede for one another
[37:34] the intersection
[37:36] you need to intercede the intercession
[37:39] is the spirit of christ
[37:41] one time the children of israel
[37:44] they were
[37:45] wrong as wrong can be
[37:48] but moses with a spirit of christ in him
[37:52] he intercedes at god before you destroy
[37:54] them destroy me
[37:56] the same intercession spirit that was on
[37:59] abraham
[38:00] when the time came
[38:03] for god to destroy sodom and gomorrah
[38:07] that people in sodom were as strong as
[38:09] strong can be
[38:11] but abraham with the spirit of christ in
[38:13] him
[38:14] he interceded and plead with the angel
[38:18] if you can find 50
[38:20] will you destroy this city
[38:22] and they just say no yes if i found it i
[38:25] would not destroy it
[38:27] and there was no 50 righteous
[38:30] i wonder what time are we living in
[38:33] when everything
[38:36] that is good is now treated as bad
[38:39] and the bad has become good
[38:42] what time are we living insane
[38:46] is worse than that time now
[38:49] but there were spirit of intercession
[38:52] the spirit of god in abrahamic seed is
[38:55] also crying out
[38:57] for abraham was was at the back of his
[39:00] mind of his fault of his falling knee
[39:02] and his fallen nephew
[39:04] lord
[39:06] he didn't want not to be destroyed with
[39:08] the unrighteous the bible said that the
[39:10] sin of sodom
[39:12] verse
[39:13] lord soul
[39:14] i wonder
[39:15] how many lots are living in this time
[39:19] that the people are scared to even stand
[39:22] for the truth
[39:23] because of their belly
[39:25] just for the natural life they're scared
[39:28] to tell the truth
[39:30] but truth is only one
[39:33] you have only one truth that's the word
[39:36] of god
[39:38] what we obey the loss of the land don't
[39:42] get me wrong but if the loss of the land
[39:44] is contrary to the bible we're gonna go
[39:47] by what this bible says
[39:49] because our absolute is the bible
[39:52] that's what we stand for this is the
[39:54] absolute
[39:56] so if the law of the land is contrary to
[39:58] this we stand by this and the same god
[40:02] that sued for daniel sued for the
[40:05] shadrach music
[40:07] that same god will stand for his
[40:10] children when he stands for his word
[40:13] because if you stand for him he will
[40:14] stand for you here over there
[40:17] if you are ashamed of god he was gonna
[40:19] be ashamed of god of you
[40:21] amen if you are ashamed to stand for him
[40:23] he's going to be ashamed to stand for
[40:25] you
[40:26] we have to stand for god
[40:29] we have to stand for the word of god
[40:33] because
[40:34] he said fear
[40:36] him not
[40:37] who is able to destroy just the body
[40:40] but the one that can destroy the body
[40:42] soul and the spirit
[40:45] so it's time to stand for the word of
[40:47] god
[40:48] and he will stand for you
[40:51] that's why
[40:52] and one of the story that abraham said
[40:54] about
[40:55] after mccoy pronounced the name right
[40:58] when he had a dream then
[41:00] the the angel asked him did you lie on
[41:04] this on the earth
[41:05] he said he thought
[41:07] i have been truth and honest about it
[41:10] but in the presence of that light
[41:13] he realized that some views that he
[41:15] didn't do it right he said did you steal
[41:19] historically never stole
[41:22] but in the presence of that like little
[41:24] things
[41:25] it all flashes
[41:26] he was about to tend to go to their
[41:29] condemnation but the voice said father
[41:32] forgive him
[41:33] on end he stood for me
[41:37] and i'm also standing for him so all
[41:39] that god is requiring is to stand for
[41:42] the lord jesus christ here
[41:45] don't worry about your mistakes mistakes
[41:47] we make mistakes he understands you are
[41:50] in this flesh
[41:51] he understands or makes you understand
[41:53] the way we are born and everything he
[41:55] understands his flesh
[41:58] but all that he wants is that stand for
[42:00] me stand for jesus
[42:04] get as many as you can for the lord
[42:07] pray for this pray for the sick pray for
[42:09] your brothers and sisters intercede for
[42:12] them
[42:13] and god will take care of the of his
[42:16] business
[42:18] amen because
[42:19] nobody can follow the ten commandments
[42:23] by the lord what is guilty
[42:25] the grace of god
[42:28] grace grace grace amazing grace
[42:31] grace that is greater than all my sins
[42:35] is a grace
[42:37] that is taking us through
[42:39] it's not your self-righteousness his
[42:41] righteousness
[42:42] that is in you and me
[42:44] amen
[42:46] so don't worry about this flesh
[42:49] because the flesh will go wherever it
[42:51] came from anyway but the soul in the
[42:53] mind
[42:55] yeah
[42:57] you that matters
[42:59] praise our wonderful god
[43:02] amen hallelujah
[43:06] praise god
[43:09] okay grace give me 26.
[43:16] okay
[43:21] okay
[43:23] yeah
[43:24] 27
[43:29] 27
[43:32] do not get anxious about anything
[43:36] yeah do not get anxious about anything
[43:40] but in everything
[43:43] by prayer and petition
[43:46] with thanksgiving
[43:50] present your request to god
[43:53] and the peace of god
[43:56] which transcends all understanding
[43:59] will guide your hearts
[44:02] and your minds in christ
[44:04] jesus
[44:06] amen that means you got to pray in the
[44:09] spirit
[44:11] you got to be in the spirit last week i
[44:13] was telling the prophet saying that all
[44:15] that you need brother sister
[44:17] just prayed up
[44:20] and go during the day god will take care
[44:24] of your business
[44:26] you will be in the presence of god
[44:28] he will take care of your business
[44:32] it doesn't matter what
[44:34] bread up and relax and god will take
[44:36] control because when you are
[44:40] on the line of duty
[44:42] he'll be there for you
[44:44] because moses was on line of deity
[44:47] when they were crossing the red sea and
[44:50] their sea was
[44:52] all up
[44:53] they couldn't go anywhere
[44:55] but in the line of duty he cried out
[44:59] and god said i just use your
[45:01] rod and pat directly it brings me to two
[45:04] and then when they went to the middle
[45:06] there was the enemy here rest in here
[45:10] amen if he goes back these guys the
[45:13] details are on their truth
[45:15] and this happened they were after them
[45:18] when they went the other side and god
[45:20] said use that sin again
[45:23] and then it swallowed all the egyptians
[45:26] so and on the point of duty god will
[45:29] take your business
[45:31] all you have to do is just spray it up
[45:34] and just live your life
[45:37] don't worry about anything
[45:39] god will take control
[45:41] amen because joshua
[45:43] was also on the point of duty
[45:47] and you understand
[45:49] he says son stands too still
[45:52] sansa understands truth why because he
[45:55] was on the point of duty
[45:58] so you are on the point of duty because
[46:00] remember
[46:02] god is interested in everything that we
[46:05] are doing
[46:06] the steps of righteousness are ordered
[46:09] of the lord
[46:11] so once you are making yourself to work
[46:14] wherever you are going during the day
[46:16] god is very mindful about you he cares
[46:19] about you he loves you he cares to take
[46:22] care of your business
[46:23] so you just give everything to me in the
[46:25] morning
[46:26] go don't worry
[46:29] he will bring things to pass
[46:31] he'll bring your desires to pass

[48:52] today and forever amen i'm not worried
[48:55] for nothing because i know papa god will
[48:58] take your business

[49:07] lord amen
[49:09] hallelujah praise god just be just be in
[49:12] the spirit just pray and go he will take
[49:15] your business
[49:16] hallelujah
[49:19] praise our god
[49:22] amen and amen
[49:24] amen
[49:26] hallelujah
[49:29] grace give me 28
[49:40] yes ask for forgiveness in the afternoon
[49:42] confessions
[49:45] hallelujah
[49:48] i was talking somebody last couple of
[49:50] weeks a week ago said
[49:52] and she was saying that somebody has to
[49:53] forgive somebody
[49:55] and i say how can the person forgive if
[49:58] the spirit of forgiveness is not in
[49:59] heaven
[50:00] you need god and you need to forgive
[50:03] if somebody just said i forgive from
[50:05] their lips doesn't mean nothing
[50:08] that forgiveness has to come from the
[50:10] heart
[50:11] amen so we just can't tell people
[50:13] forgive forgive forgive
[50:15] something in them
[50:18] has to be willing to give that
[50:20] forgiveness
[50:21] you don't push people
[50:24] forgiveness or by revelation
[50:29] the people has to forgive from the depth
[50:31] of their heart and you don't press
[50:34] and pressure people
[50:36] and they will just do it to please you
[50:38] but might be sky in their in their heart
[50:41] because what is happening that god
[50:44] has the ability
[50:46] to forgive and forget
[50:48] maybe as a human being we can forgive
[50:51] but we don't have that thing to forget
[50:54] so if the person doesn't have
[50:57] that grace
[50:59] to forgive you just leave them let god
[51:01] deal with your heart
[51:03] at the right time they will do it and
[51:04] everybody will be free
[51:06] amen so it all has to be done by
[51:08] revelation because anything
[51:10] done without faith is sin
[51:13] amen hallelujah forgive us our sins as
[51:17] we forgive those who forgive sin against
[51:20] us hallelujah
[51:21] praise god
[51:23] and
[51:24] give me 30
[51:30] 30 admit my sins
[51:34] and forgive others who frustrated me
[51:38] the thing of it is some people
[51:41] they don't want to be
[51:43] what we sell it say it
[51:47] some people when they are wrong they
[51:49] don't want to accept it
[51:52] they want to always go around things
[51:56] work work around the bush
[51:59] they don't go
[52:03] they don't go right to their source that
[52:05] made their fault
[52:07] if you have that mistake with that
[52:08] mistake
[52:10] just be a money now for a lady enough is
[52:12] that enough to accept your mistakes
[52:14] and admit it
[52:17] you have to be honest with yourself
[52:19] that's why you stand 50 when i say that
[52:21] um
[52:23] there's some 51 here
[52:27] 51. yeah i just want to use the right
[52:29] way that i want to use
[52:38] he said
[52:38] 51 behold thou desires
[52:42] the truth
[52:43] in the
[52:44] inward past
[52:46] in the hidden path

[53:24] accepted his line told the person and
[53:27] the person respected him more
[53:29] than before he said i respected you more
[53:31] than before why because he had made his
[53:34] mistakes

[53:39] let feel guilty felt have anybody
[53:42] conscious
[53:44] let things go
[53:46] amen praise our god give me 31.
[53:54] blessed is huge transgressions forgiving
[54:00] okay some said psalm 32 verse 24 he said
[54:03] that blessed
[54:05] is he whose transgression is forgiven
[54:08] whose sin is covered
[54:10] blessed is the man unto whom
[54:13] the lord imputed not iniquity
[54:16] and whose prayer there is no girl
[54:18] when i kept silenced by both works would
[54:21] do my roaring all the day long for day
[54:24] and night the hand was heavier for me
[54:27] my muscles turned into drought of summer
[54:30] stila okay
[54:32] as we spoke the other time
[54:35] we're saying that
[54:37] the letter killing
[54:39] when the spirit give life
[54:41] if the spirit of god that quickens the
[54:44] letter to you
[54:46] without that is just a letter
[54:49] and one
[54:50] time in my christian work
[54:54] i made a mistake
[54:57] and
[54:58] i was down
[54:59] very down because we were praying for a
[55:01] situation fasting and praying and i went
[55:03] to work outside supervisor on that time
[55:06] and i have a co-supervisor
[55:08] and
[55:09] he did something that make me very angry
[55:12] and i was fascinating pray on that day
[55:14] for a big situation
[55:16] so
[55:17] it only came
[55:19] face to face between me and him and
[55:21] people has to intervene
[55:23] to separate us
[55:24] and when i get home i was so down
[55:28] and i was so like
[55:30] felt guilty for destroying what we are
[55:32] doing
[55:33] and god is my witness when i opened this
[55:36] bible it went to romans 8 4
[55:39] he said that blessed is the man whom i
[55:42] will not impute sin and whose iniquity
[55:44] is forgiven then everything was wrong
[55:48] all the guilt everything was wrong like
[55:50] that
[55:52] amen the spirit of god to contradict and
[55:54] from that time i have confidence no
[55:57] matter what i done no matter how i did
[55:59] mistake that scripture always comes back
[56:02] to me that blesses them whom i
[56:04] who are not imputing whose iniquity is
[56:08] for god is my witness
[56:10] the scripture just the bible just went
[56:12] right in my heart you know how your
[56:14] heart and how to express when something
[56:17] pops up
[56:19] and that scripture has been with me
[56:22] like david said he realized that the
[56:25] same god that delivered the lion and
[56:29] and the bear to him is able to take off
[56:32] or circumcise philistine
[56:34] and that scripture always comes up
[56:37] anytime i'm in trouble anytime i have
[56:39] any situation
[56:41] it just kind of builds me up
[56:44] that god will not impulsing against his
[56:47] own self amen because i'm part of him
[56:50] hallelujah and the brabram said of this
[56:53] over here he said that first of all
[56:56] we know most assuredly that the purpose
[56:59] of god
[57:01] can give us lightening to you
[57:06] first of all we know most assuredly
[57:10] that the purpose god stands in election
[57:14] it was purpose in himself
[57:17] it was god's purpose to bring forth
[57:20] people like
[57:21] unto himself
[57:23] that would be a red bride
[57:26] she was chosen before the foundation of
[57:29] the world
[57:30] in him
[57:32] she was foreknown
[57:34] and beloved before she was ever brought
[57:36] forth
[57:37] during the ages upon the earth
[57:40] she was redeemed by his blood and can
[57:43] never come into condemnation
[57:46] she can never be in judgment because sin
[57:50] cannot be imputed
[57:52] onto her romance eight for it blessed is
[57:56] the man to whom lord
[57:58] will not impute sin
[58:01] so god will not imprison to you because
[58:04] you are part of him
[58:06] you make mistake on the flesh
[58:08] but don't worry about the flesh
[58:10] he will not impute anything to his
[58:12] attribute
[58:13] you are part of him
[58:15] amen and somewhere he said that you are
[58:18] justified you didn't even do it in the
[58:20] first place
[58:21] amen you never have as you have done
[58:24] nothing
[58:25] you are justified by faith
[58:28] so don't look at your mistakes
[58:31] don't look down upon yourself because
[58:33] god do not impute things to you
[58:36] hey man that's sin less bride
[58:39] you wouldn't do it in the first place
[58:42] you are justified amen our god is
[58:46] awesome
[58:47] so don't feel guilty
[58:49] some people every little thing they feel
[58:51] guilty about it though just brush it off
[58:53] just repent and move out your life
[58:56] all that god wants you to tell lord i'm
[58:58] sorry
[58:59] you admit it you die something against
[59:01] somebody my dad always tells me it was a
[59:03] film
[59:05] even if you have to take somebody to
[59:07] call for a situation
[59:08] you want the person to admit their fault
[59:12] so if you know you have wronged somebody
[59:15] don't wait to go to court
[59:17] settle the person tell the truth just be
[59:19] honest
[59:21] just live your life
[59:23] and don't drag things
[59:26] and god will bless you
[59:29] amen because he will not impute sin
[59:31] against you
[59:33] and if you read down there he said that
[59:35] but she shall be with him in his throne
[59:37] of judgment
[59:39] judging the world and even angels
[59:43] here named
[59:45] each of her members was written in the
[59:47] session of the lamb's book of life
[59:49] before the foundations of this world
[59:53] amen so you are sinless bride
[59:57] don't be scared to judge nevertheless
[59:59] because you're going to judge
[1:00:01] over on the other side amen
[1:00:03] hallelujah
[1:00:05] said that he that believes this shall
[1:00:07] pass has far from death into life and
[1:00:09] shall not come onto condemnation
[1:00:12] judgment begins at the house of god
[1:00:15] now the word of god is judging us
[1:00:18] and taking away any lessons from us that
[1:00:20] sound like him slowly so little by
[1:00:22] little amen hallelujah praise our god so
[1:00:27] what that so don't
[1:00:29] get down
[1:00:30] don't let nothing worry you
[1:00:33] because as a son or daughter of god
[1:00:37] there's nothing that god will not
[1:00:39] forgive you
[1:00:41] the only thing god should not forgive
[1:00:42] the blasphemy of the holy ghost and a
[1:00:44] son or daughter of god cannot
[1:00:47] and will never be will never bless him
[1:00:49] against god
[1:00:51] so what are you worried about
[1:00:54] you are justified those on the youtube
[1:00:56] land i'm telling you you are justified
[1:00:59] don't feel guilty about anything repent
[1:01:02] and go forward
[1:01:05] just be honest
[1:01:07] because god wants truth in the hidden
[1:01:10] path
[1:01:10] in the inward path
[1:01:13] that's where god requires the truth
[1:01:16] i'd rather be right in my heart
[1:01:20] inward than the outside i don't care
[1:01:22] what anybody thinks about you whatever
[1:01:24] talks about me
[1:01:26] once my heart is right with god and once
[1:01:29] i make things right i don't care about
[1:01:30] anything you are wearing yourself for
[1:01:33] nothing i want to make sure i'm right
[1:01:35] with my maker that's the most important
[1:01:38] thing
[1:01:38] amen that's why david said i ran at god
[1:01:42] god judge me that
[1:01:43] human being because there's a
[1:01:45] forgiveness with him
[1:01:48] he's a loving father christ
[1:01:51] amen
[1:01:53] but you human being know
[1:01:55] i want to make sure i make things right
[1:01:59] with my maker
[1:02:00] it's very important to me than anything
[1:02:02] else
[1:02:03] amen praise our god
[1:02:06] hallelujah
[1:02:10] slice 33
[1:02:16] i think the same that i confess my sin
[1:02:18] to you
[1:02:20] and didn't try to hide them then you
[1:02:22] forgive me and now all
[1:02:25] my guilt is gone that is your sins have
[1:02:28] been thrown into the world the sea of
[1:02:32] god forgetfulness he doesn't even
[1:02:35] remember them anymore
[1:02:38] so don't let nothing
[1:02:40] worry you little bride
[1:02:42] somewhere enjoy he said that even if
[1:02:43] your heart condemns you
[1:02:46] god is greater than your heart
[1:02:48] amen
[1:02:50] hallelujah
[1:02:51] so don't let nothing condemn because you
[1:02:54] can't approach god the condemnation
[1:02:56] that's why the master if your heart
[1:02:58] condemns you not ask anything and i'll
[1:03:01] grant it to you
[1:03:03] so god doesn't want us to feel
[1:03:04] condemnation i believe that's why he
[1:03:07] gave me that scripture to let not from
[1:03:10] that
[1:03:11] blessing that my whom i would not in
[1:03:12] peace but that time i was feeling so i
[1:03:14] was feeling so condemned oh god i've
[1:03:16] done this
[1:03:17] that he came at the right time
[1:03:20] and let me out from it
[1:03:22] amen and he will do the same thing to
[1:03:24] you he doesn't want you to feel
[1:03:26] condemned to feel guilty not because he
[1:03:29] came to take our guilt on the cross
[1:03:32] so that we can become him
[1:03:35] he became us
[1:03:37] he was not guilty guiltless but he came
[1:03:40] take our guilty upon him
[1:03:43] so nobody take any guilt upon him or
[1:03:45] herself
[1:03:47] because that guilt is gone already
[1:03:50] and do you know that
[1:03:52] even a true son or daughter of god
[1:03:55] when you do something wrong god hasn't
[1:03:57] been hold it against you because he knew
[1:03:59] that down the road you make sense right
[1:04:02] so he forgives you in advance
[1:04:07] hallelujah
[1:04:09] praise our god so you are justified in
[1:04:12] christ jesus
[1:04:14] amen
[1:04:16] praise our god by bill
[1:04:19] amen hallelujah
[1:04:23] yes sir
[1:04:28] okay
[1:04:29] so i'm just gonna
[1:04:32] work to wrap up very soon
[1:04:36] give me 34.
[1:04:42] okay
[1:04:58] okay he said that ask for the help
[1:05:02] ask for to help me
[1:05:04] make wise
[1:05:06] decisions decisions are very very
[1:05:10] important
[1:05:11] because
[1:05:13] your present condition
[1:05:16] that you are in
[1:05:18] is based on the scene you made five
[1:05:20] years ago
[1:05:22] in the next five years
[1:05:26] decisions gonna make now
[1:05:28] will determine your your next stage
[1:05:31] so decisions are very very important
[1:05:36] that's why brabrand preached about the
[1:05:38] greatest battle ever fought
[1:05:41] because that's because these things take
[1:05:43] place over here
[1:05:45] and because this thing takes place over
[1:05:47] here there's always a battle
[1:05:50] so before you make every decision you
[1:05:52] got to
[1:05:54] take the lord in prayer
[1:05:56] that's why joseph at one time forgot
[1:05:58] about himself
[1:06:00] and he was just carried away by the
[1:06:02] situation
[1:06:04] then he was not go to the wall but he
[1:06:06] asked have you prayed have you consulted
[1:06:09] god
[1:06:12] and when god was consulted you realize
[1:06:15] that all those 400 prophets were lying
[1:06:18] and there was only one mayaka who has
[1:06:20] the truth amen the same thing happened
[1:06:22] in our prophet's life when four hundred
[1:06:24] of them
[1:06:25] pentecost are there to challenge him on
[1:06:27] the doctrine of the separate student
[1:06:29] baptism in the name of our lord jesus
[1:06:31] christ he said that i'm standing here
[1:06:33] the angels behind me who can come and
[1:06:35] refuse what i'm saying
[1:06:37] he said you can't come because you're
[1:06:39] not scared of me you're scared of that
[1:06:41] angel that is behind me
[1:06:43] and that same mighty angels here with us
[1:06:46] who do you think was with peter
[1:06:49] who took him from the prisons or the
[1:06:50] angel of god
[1:06:52] paul
[1:06:53] when they were going to have a shipwreck
[1:06:56] he said a chair up
[1:06:57] the angel of india came to me and spoke
[1:06:59] to me that none of you will be perished
[1:07:02] that who was behind brad brown ministry
[1:07:04] towards god the angel of god that same
[1:07:06] angel of god is here with us tonight
[1:07:09] if thou canst believe all things
[1:07:12] are possible to tempt that belief
[1:07:13] because the same mighty angel
[1:07:16] is with the bride again
[1:07:19] doing the exact same thing he did
[1:07:21] hallelujah so you you have to pray over
[1:07:25] your decisions
[1:07:26] it's very very vital
[1:07:30] amen because the greatest battle goes on
[1:07:33] in the mind
[1:07:34] it's your thought
[1:07:36] god knows every thought that passed
[1:07:38] through our mind even right now whatever
[1:07:41] is going through your mind god is aware
[1:07:42] of it
[1:07:44] amen and somebody said oh
[1:07:46] i cannot do nothing by the thought yes
[1:07:50] yes some thoughts will come contrast to
[1:07:52] god read but he said that the bear don't
[1:07:54] let it nest on your heart on it he
[1:07:56] doesn't have to you can just refuse it
[1:07:59] reject it the bible said that
[1:08:02] resist the devil and what he will flee
[1:08:06] you you you cannot
[1:08:09] prevent them from coming but you can
[1:08:11] also
[1:08:13] let do not allow them to nest on you
[1:08:16] don't feed on those thoughts
[1:08:19] feed on god's thoughts
[1:08:21] what are the thoughts of god said
[1:08:22] whatsoever things that are of good
[1:08:24] report whatsoever things that edifies if
[1:08:28] there are any virtues think on those
[1:08:31] things
[1:08:32] those are things that i defies
[1:08:34] change the identifies things that will
[1:08:36] draw you to christ as they think on
[1:08:39] these things that god appeared on them
[1:08:42] on their way to do what in miles they
[1:08:44] were thinking about him they were
[1:08:46] talking about him
[1:08:48] god likes to hear talk about him
[1:08:51] let's talk about jesus
[1:08:53] the king of king supreme
[1:08:55] why is he talking about him you appear
[1:08:58] amen he's awesome people wasting their
[1:09:00] time to gossip
[1:09:02] spend their time with him talk about him
[1:09:04] think about him
[1:09:06] and you appear
[1:09:08] because the same years later forever
[1:09:10] when he appeared he break the bread
[1:09:14] and the eyes were open
[1:09:16] amen that same god is here tonight to
[1:09:20] break the bread again so that our eyes
[1:09:22] can open
[1:09:24] amen to see the word when the well
[1:09:26] resurrected
[1:09:28] what part are you
[1:09:29] is it resurrected in you
[1:09:32] where path was the path
[1:09:35] amen because when it was resurrected
[1:09:38] they were thinking about him we were
[1:09:39] talking about the past
[1:09:41] he said that all slow and full of was it
[1:09:44] slow and
[1:09:46] slow and what
[1:09:47] slow and full is whatever it is
[1:09:50] have you forgot this this this that
[1:09:54] he revealed it back to them and
[1:09:57] when you break the bread
[1:09:59] the eyes pop up oh they knew it was him
[1:10:02] and he vanished
[1:10:04] is it the same thing yes
[1:10:07] is that breaking the price even and time
[1:10:09] again
[1:10:10] their bride is preparing for her mate to
[1:10:13] meet hey man
[1:10:14] harlow is even in time again he's the
[1:10:17] same yesterday and forever amen
[1:10:20] his evening time breaking the bread
[1:10:22] when he see all things going on
[1:10:25] because
[1:10:27] remember i was telling someone the bible
[1:10:29] says it's going to get
[1:10:31] worse
[1:10:32] and worse cold
[1:10:34] it's never going to go back
[1:10:37] it's poured ever backwards never
[1:10:41] so we we're not going back
[1:10:44] we're going forward
[1:10:47] it's getting worse dark out there
[1:10:50] and the spirit of god is also moving
[1:10:52] mightily in his children
[1:10:55] amen is a battle going on now
[1:10:58] between right and wrong between liberty
[1:11:01] and and
[1:11:02] and bondage
[1:11:04] it's your choice
[1:11:06] amen because the battle is going on
[1:11:08] right now
[1:11:10] it's getting dark every day
[1:11:12] but there is a light coming off that
[1:11:14] light is only in the bride of christ
[1:11:16] amen they are the only one
[1:11:18] that god has also revealed himself more
[1:11:21] in them becoming flesh because people
[1:11:24] are looking for the word back then but
[1:11:26] they forgot that the word has put on
[1:11:28] flesh and on two feet again walking amen
[1:11:31] on two feet again the same god
[1:11:34] he's in his bride
[1:11:36] doing the exact same thing he
[1:11:39] they are putting in the future
[1:11:41] they are putting in the past
[1:11:43] and they can talk more about the past
[1:11:46] but they forgot what he existed who
[1:11:48] would deny that
[1:11:50] christ has not come in the flesh is of
[1:11:52] the antichrist he's in the flesh now in
[1:11:54] his bread
[1:11:56] he's the same god
[1:11:59] so it's very very vital
[1:12:03] that
[1:12:04] we
[1:12:05] consult god
[1:12:07] in every decision that we make
[1:12:11] amen praise god
[1:12:13] i'll be wrapping up very soon
[1:12:24] okay
[1:12:25] he said i remember that the temptations
[1:12:28] that come into your life
[1:12:30] um 36 grace
[1:12:35] remember that the temptations that come
[1:12:37] into your life are no different
[1:12:40] from what others experience
[1:12:43] and god is faithful
[1:12:45] he will keep the temptation from
[1:12:47] becoming so strong
[1:12:49] that you can stand up against
[1:12:51] it when you are tempted you show you a
[1:12:54] way out so that you not
[1:12:56] giving in to it
[1:12:58] in other words god will not give you
[1:13:00] anything that you cannot bear
[1:13:02] he know your limits
[1:13:05] he will give you more that you can you
[1:13:07] can carry
[1:13:09] so anything that comes your way know
[1:13:11] that god is take care of you know your
[1:13:13] capacity you know your capability know
[1:13:16] what he
[1:13:17] has placed in you
[1:13:18] that's overcome because greater is he
[1:13:21] that is in you than he that's in the
[1:13:24] world
[1:13:25] the overcoming power dwells in you
[1:13:28] so you overcome everything you overcome
[1:13:30] death and everything you're going to
[1:13:32] overcome everything through you too
[1:13:35] because he that overcometh will also sit
[1:13:38] with me at my throne
[1:13:40] amen that that overcoming power is in
[1:13:42] you so no matter what come your way you
[1:13:46] have to have confidence
[1:13:48] that it's not there to kill you
[1:13:51] it's there to shape you up
[1:13:54] it's there to prepare you
[1:13:56] you pressurize when the people are going
[1:13:58] toward the soldiers they train them very
[1:14:01] hard
[1:14:03] they go through all sorts of training
[1:14:06] for the battle so when the battle comes
[1:14:09] they know what they are going through
[1:14:10] the train because even if you check the
[1:14:13] natural life the
[1:14:15] basketball players and other things
[1:14:17] those that excel very much they say that
[1:14:20] they go beyond the regular people
[1:14:23] they go they get the practice before
[1:14:26] everybody gets their the last person to
[1:14:28] leave
[1:14:31] so your preparation
[1:14:33] is praying and reading the bible every
[1:14:36] day and listening the word of god
[1:14:38] when you make that preparation
[1:14:40] it will show up
[1:14:42] if you are not preparing that
[1:14:44] area it's gonna show up people will see
[1:14:47] when the battle comes
[1:14:50] it will say how if you can stand or not
[1:14:54] amen so you got to be you got to be
[1:14:57] trained
[1:14:58] you have to be trained for battle
[1:15:01] amen
