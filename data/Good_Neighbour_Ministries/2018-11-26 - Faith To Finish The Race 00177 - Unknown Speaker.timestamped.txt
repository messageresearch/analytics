[0:00] [Music]
[0:11] it's good to be the house amen praise
[0:17] God
[0:17] you're blessed to be here to be tonight
[0:24] I know it's cold up there animal was a
[0:27] sacrifice temptation to stay warm
[0:32] just relax
[0:35] fireplace you know pour a nice hot tea
[0:39] but I'm tired God do something reader
[0:44] for us tonight because he promises to
[0:48] assemble with us every time that we
[0:53] [Music]
[0:56] praise God we're gonna read tonight from
[1:00] the book of Hebrews we're not going to
[1:02] keep you long we're trusting that we're
[1:04] just gonna have some time with the
[1:07] Spirit of God just to minister to our
[1:11] needs a little bit because that's what
[1:22] we come for Hebrews 11 from verses 1 to
[1:28] 6 it says now faith you need to do
[1:32] something with the mic here it's just
[1:33] bringing back faith is the substance of
[1:37] things hoped for the evidence of things
[1:41] not seen
[1:42] for by it the elders obtained a
[1:46] report through things we understand that
[1:50] the worlds were framed by the Word of
[1:54] God so that things which are seen were
[1:59] not made of things which do appear by
[2:04] faith and you could just replace the
[2:06] word faith by revelation Abel offered
[2:14] unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
[2:18] Cain by which he obtained witness that
[2:22] he was righteous God testifying of his
[2:26] gifts and by it he being dead yet
[2:30] speaketh by faith Enoch was translated
[2:35] that he should not see death and was not
[2:38] found because God had translated him for
[2:42] before his translation he had this
[2:44] testimony that he pleased but without
[2:50] revelation it is impossible to please
[2:54] him for he that cometh to God must
[2:56] believe that he is and that he is a
[3:00] rewarder of them that diligently we are
[3:08] so grateful tonight Lord every time we
[3:12] come into your presence and the assemble
[3:14] around new word and the word especially
[3:17] the word of this day in this power and
[3:19] God just excites our hearts that our
[3:22] souls and excites our spirit Lord to
[3:25] know that this is what excites you that
[3:29] your people can recognize what it is
[3:32] that you're doing the day that we're
[3:34] living in brings us into such unity
[3:37] father where we can be led by your
[3:39] spirit and we can fulfill the purpose of
[3:42] the plan that you have for each and
[3:44] every one of us
[3:46] Lord bless our time together tonight
[3:49] father we we just are under great
[3:52] expectation Lord that you will do
[3:56] something special one word from you
[4:00] [Music]
[4:08] blessed be your wonderful day bless us
[4:12] in your presence now we pray in Jesus in
[4:18] Bruce chapter twelve verse 1 it says
[4:25] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[4:29] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[4:33] let us lay aside every weight and the
[4:38] sin which doth so easily beset us and
[4:41] let us run with patience the race that
[4:45] is set before us looking unto Jesus the
[4:49] author and the finisher of our faith you
[4:56] know I want to talk today a little bit
[5:00] about having the faith to finish the
[5:04] race I believe that you know there you
[5:09] know when we think about races there's
[5:12] there's a lot of preparation that goes
[5:16] into a race you know what an individual
[5:19] training to run a race he goes and he
[5:23] you know he feeds properly he he he
[5:26] hydrates himself properly he exercises
[5:30] he you know he does all the necessary
[5:33] things to prepare his vessel to get his
[5:36] body into ultimate shape so that he can
[5:40] run the race because his desire to run
[5:43] the race is not just a book and
[5:45] robberies but to actually win and this
[5:50] is you know there always comes a point
[5:53] but you know you're at that final stage
[5:56] in the race where you need that certain
[5:59] amount of energy that you just that you
[6:02] have endurance when you train that when
[6:05] you've done what you know is necessary
[6:08] to cross that finish line you know all
[6:12] the things that that you sacrificed at
[6:14] the time that you sacrifice and the life
[6:17] that you left you know you gotta
[6:19] sacrifice you gotta give up certain
[6:21] things you know professional athletes
[6:23] they're not just doing the things that
[6:26] that you know other people are regularly
[6:29] out doing and you know eating whatever
[6:31] they want and just you know doing
[6:33] whatever they want no they take the time
[6:35] to actually feed right they take the
[6:39] time to do the things that they know
[6:43] they must do you know there's a scene
[6:45] that I've always heard and the same is
[6:49] this that you do what you gotta do what
[6:52] you gotta do it
[6:53] they will come you can do what you want
[6:56] to do what you want you know I know that
[7:02] there's coming a time when we going to
[7:05] be so set free that we're going to be
[7:07] having fellowship divine we're going to
[7:10] be not at all the I know it's easy to
[7:11] talk about it
[7:12] it won't like talk about the other side
[7:14] but it's a reality Saint the other side
[7:18] is a reality this is our goal this is
[7:21] what we strive for this is why we you
[7:23] know we give up the things of this world
[7:26] we give up certain things because we
[7:29] know that there's a great victory when
[7:31] the race is about what the race has done
[7:35] but we need like the scripture says to
[7:38] put aside all those things that so
[7:41] easily drops away from the focus and and
[7:46] then the purpose and the plan of God for
[7:48] each and every one of our lives so that
[7:50] we can finish the race but in order to
[7:53] finish the race you you need to know
[7:55] that your injuries you know you know
[7:59] just see spectators running it off the
[8:02] you know the audience and decide that
[8:04] they're gonna just decide to run that
[8:06] race they're gonna get pulled out of the
[8:08] water they're not gonna have a chance
[8:11] they need to be prepared
[8:13] [Music]
[8:18] there's so many ladies in the race and
[8:21] what the organizers prepare that race
[8:24] they exactly who's gonna be a great
[8:28] destiny he's going to be in the race so
[8:32] that's sort of when they get there they
[8:33] can take their position there's only
[8:39] going to be one but you need to know
[8:42] that you're in the race in order to win
[8:45] the race you need to know you're in the
[8:48] records there's a lot of races going on
[8:52] out there right now there's a lot of
[8:53] different Church interpretations of the
[8:56] Word of God and they're all leading to
[8:58] certain places there's Trinitarian
[9:00] baptism there's there's teachings up
[9:03] it'll mighty God Almighty God you've got
[9:06] all kinds of different interpretations
[9:07] these are all different races these
[9:11] people actually believe that there's no
[9:13] one in the race that there is but God
[9:18] he's not the author of confusion or
[9:20] darkness God has prepared a church in
[9:25] the last days that's gonna win the
[9:28] ultimate race you know when we think
[9:32] about the children of Israel the ones
[9:35] that doubt it they couldn't possibly
[9:38] live the race there's no way you can
[9:41] belt and win when you go into a race
[9:46] you've gotta have confidence you can't
[9:48] have a negative report you can't be
[9:53] negative and run in a race you try going
[9:57] into the race and saying oh I can't win
[9:59] this
[10:01] [Music]
[10:03] because you've already told yourself
[10:05] that you can't win the race you've got
[10:08] to have the right attitude you've got to
[10:11] know who you are and why you have been
[10:14] ordained to win and to perfect the faith
[10:19] that's in you in order to overcome and
[10:22] win the race I just want to talk to you
[10:28] tonight about faith to finish the race
[10:31] you know brother Branham talks about
[10:35] here in the easter cele says but if God
[10:39] said in this day back in the beginning
[10:43] John Doe will be my servant millions of
[10:48] years ago
[10:48] now turn dough is born in sin shaped in
[10:53] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[10:55] because he's a mortal but maybe he gets
[11:00] a little religious feeling he'll go join
[11:03] the church maybe he'll join a
[11:04] Pentecostal church
[11:06] oh no he might join anything but let him
[11:10] get under the atmosphere of God once
[11:14] John Doe is bound to recognize who his
[11:18] father is just as that Eagle recognized
[11:22] he the mother was it got to realize it
[11:27] see only that junk know as God's
[11:29] attribute that's become a word spoken
[11:34] and then all these spirit seats that
[11:37] word out here it is
[11:39] he calls it gives him everlasting life
[11:42] and brings him into his presence
[11:45] it's God's work and you see what-what
[11:49] were you when you came into that
[11:52] atmosphere and you received the Spirit
[11:54] of God in your life at the right time at
[11:57] the right season it awoke something
[12:00] inside of me that was ordained to live
[12:04] they were dating that you are
[12:07] predestined to win this race and it's
[12:10] not the time to give up it's the time to
[12:13] stand it's the time to to continue to
[12:16] your position it's the time to allow the
[12:18] Spirit of God to mold you shape you and
[12:21] prepare you for what you have been
[12:24] ordained to achieve the finish line for
[12:29] the holes that are better outside the
[12:31] price seems impossible but to those that
[12:35] are in Christ those haven't been read
[12:37] birthed by the Word of God those that
[12:40] have been placed into a body into a
[12:43] church where they know that that God is
[12:46] placing and given them faith those
[12:48] people they have certain endurance they
[12:51] have a certain desire they think they
[12:55] want to serve God they want to get into
[12:57] their position frame to allow
[13:01] place them lead them into guide them so
[13:04] that they can fulfill the purpose in the
[13:06] plan God has ordained that you you're an
[13:10] attribute of God even you cannot fit you
[13:14] give up you cannot not win because you
[13:18] are ordained to finish this now we know
[13:33] that there's a time of the season for
[13:35] all things and here we are now we've
[13:38] done you know over fifty three years
[13:42] since the Prophet went off the scene and
[13:45] we're seeing the events that are taking
[13:47] place worldwide we're seeing the events
[13:51] that that that we've never seen before
[13:54] I don't know if you noticed it but every
[13:56] year there's there's like another
[13:59] historical you know historical breaking
[14:03] event something that happens that that's
[14:06] never happened before
[14:07] why because we are at a time where all
[14:11] things are gonna culminate and where
[14:13] there's going to be a people that's
[14:15] going to surface but we can have a
[14:17] certain level of faith to overcome
[14:22] dimension after living in you've been
[14:25] ordained to overcome this dimension
[14:28] because of the word that you've been
[14:30] given in the word that's placed in you
[14:32] you have to be a god that's in you is
[14:34] ordained to be changed to eventually
[14:40] change
[14:43] do you have to come into the atmosphere
[14:48] that God has prepared for you for that
[14:51] dimensional change to take place and how
[14:55] is it coming it's coming
[14:57] by faith it's coming by a word that's
[14:59] being released into your hearts and into
[15:04] your lives as you walk and as you you
[15:07] serve the Lord this faith is being
[15:10] released it's actually being released in
[15:12] you and through supernatural it brings
[15:20] us up inside of us because in that
[15:23] attribute is everything that you need in
[15:27] order to fulfill the purpose of God
[15:31] you're given a position in the body and
[15:34] you must actively involve yourself in
[15:38] that position is he recognizing who you
[15:43] are and knowing brother Graham said that
[15:46] they'll know what to do with the word is
[15:48] when you can actively get yourself in
[15:52] the position that God has given you by
[15:54] faith and operating in that position
[15:57] don't be looking for some super high you
[16:02] know Revelation position that's not what
[16:05] God is looking for God is looking for
[16:07] this
[16:07] that you can just recognize that you've
[16:11] been called and that you've been placed
[16:12] into this body now I'm going to read
[16:17] here it's not based on intellectual
[16:21] faith this is based of supernatural
[16:26] thinking this is the faith that goes
[16:28] beyond human understanding you cannot
[16:32] describe faith you cannot you know
[16:35] interpret faith because faith is what
[16:38] God reveals to you what he wants you to
[16:41] do amen
[16:43] so intellectual faith all right that's
[16:45] as far as the nominal Christian knows he
[16:50] hears the word he believes it he has a
[16:53] mental conception that's why we believe
[16:57] that but notice when the matter come to
[17:00] the waters of separation which was word
[17:03] he cometh by hearing hearing of the word
[17:06] we believe that God wants us to believe
[17:09] it that's part of it but that's as far
[17:12] as he ever gets he never gets into
[17:15] fellowship yonder he just comes through
[17:17] the water separation and when he comes
[17:20] to that part he finds a mental
[17:23] conception
[17:24] yes I believe thinks it's in his mind
[17:27] raises up his hand accepts it and twenty
[17:30] days from there he's in fact in the same
[17:33] room he was in the first place
[17:35] because it never
[17:36] any farther than is that's not the kind
[17:42] of thing that is going to produce a body
[17:44] change it's not that kind of faith the
[17:48] kind of thing that's going to give us
[17:50] the power to finish this race it goes it
[17:53] goes beyond it's the kind of thing that
[17:56] you you have a receiver to receive
[18:02] perfect faith comes by hearing the words
[18:05] if you look back in the book of
[18:08] Revelation it says he that hath an ear
[18:11] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[18:14] the churches
[18:16] to him that overcometh will I give to
[18:19] eat of the tree of life which is in the
[18:22] midst of the paradise of God
[18:25] revelations 2:11 he that hath an ear let
[18:29] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[18:32] churches
[18:33] he that overcometh shall not be hurt of
[18:36] the second death you see all these
[18:38] promises that he's talking about here
[18:40] it's Gd and he that hath an ear let him
[18:48] hear what the spirit saith is constant
[18:50] revelations
[18:51] 36 he then happened here even happened
[18:54] here than 3:13 he that hath an ear now
[18:57] notice in ephesians church age brother
[18:59] bill says it says the spirit is speaking
[19:02] to the churches that is plural not
[19:05] senior the spirit did not have John
[19:08] write this down for a local TV ginger CH
[19:11] North for the first page only is for all
[19:16] the church ages this Bennett is a
[19:19] message for every Christian through
[19:21] every age until Jesus comes yes it is
[19:25] for it is the spirit speaking he that
[19:30] happened here that him hear what the
[19:31] spirit saith under the term
[19:33] servus how tragic it is that the first
[19:37] age did not listen to the spirit
[19:40] instead it listened to them but they got
[19:44] in the last stage there will be a group
[19:47] rise up the true pride of the last day
[19:51] and she will listen to the spirit in
[19:56] that they have lost darkness the light
[19:58] will return by the pure word and he will
[20:02] return to the power of Pentecost the
[20:07] Lord Jesus Christ so the Holy Spirit in
[20:12] every age and progressing the word
[20:16] bringing us on to that perfect faith but
[20:19] this brings us on to the completion of
[20:22] the faith because the scripture said
[20:25] he's the author and the finisher so
[20:28] whatever he started in you he's gonna
[20:31] finish even happier that I'm here with
[20:35] the spirit saith unto the churches this
[20:37] is not one church age where this verse
[20:40] is not mentioned every single age has
[20:44] the same admonition to the people of
[20:47] every age he that hath an ear let him
[20:51] hear what the Spirit said but it is
[20:54] absolutely impossible for all men to
[20:58] hear what the Spirit says to the
[21:01] different ages it's not possible that
[21:05] everybody's gonna receive what we
[21:08] receive
[21:10] therefore they can't finish this race
[21:13] it's not for everyone it's for you
[21:18] it's because God ordained it for you we
[21:22] see there's only one group of people
[21:25] that a very special group of people were
[21:29] able to hear what the Spirit says in
[21:31] each age it is one special group that we
[21:35] seize the revelation for each age that
[21:39] group is of God because that group
[21:43] because the group that cannot hear is
[21:46] not the group that can and thus hear
[21:51] what the Spirit is saying and we sees
[21:53] the revelation thereof is that group
[21:56] described in 1st Corinthians chapter 2
[21:59] and so we're gonna read them
[22:03] it says howbeit we speak wisdom among
[22:06] them that are perfect yet not the wisdom
[22:10] of this world nor of the princes of this
[22:14] world that come to nought but when you
[22:18] look at perfect because we're talking
[22:21] about perfect faith it talks a full age
[22:26] brought to its end finished the kind of
[22:30] thing that you're receiving now which is
[22:33] going to produce this change is a
[22:35] perfect thing it's a supernatural thing
[22:38] it will override all the circumstances
[22:42] in your life it will override all the
[22:45] things that are good doing you right now
[22:48] we all have things that are better ahem
[22:51] you eNOS we also have situations that we
[22:54] don't want in our lives that you know
[22:56] that that you know it's called fear it's
[22:59] those things in our lives that
[23:02] they seem to have an evidence but their
[23:05] thoughts they did that's why fear is
[23:08] false evidence it appears real but it's
[23:11] false and we need to overcome those
[23:15] things but we can't we can't do it as
[23:19] human beings we can't do it as as
[23:23] intellectual believers we must do it by
[23:26] revelation No thank God we started the
[23:30] work in us is not going to fail he's not
[23:32] going to stop he's not going to quit
[23:34] he knows what needs to be done and each
[23:37] and every one of our lives and he will
[23:39] do it but we speak listening in jetan 7
[23:45] Corinthians chapter 2 verse 7 he says
[23:47] but we speak the wisdom of God in
[23:49] mystery even the hidden wisdom which God
[23:54] ordained before the world unto our glory
[23:59] he ordained a certain about faith that
[24:04] we were going to need to finish this
[24:06] race right the very end you're gonna
[24:09] need perfect faith to pitch this race
[24:11] brother Richard we are going to need it
[24:14] and God has prepared it he's ordained it
[24:17] and it's going to come in its time and
[24:20] in its season and there's no way you're
[24:22] gonna miss it because it was for
[24:24] ordained before the world unto your
[24:29] glory it was worth a to you which none
[24:35] of the princes of this world knew for
[24:39] half they builded they would not have
[24:42] crucified the Lord of glory but as it is
[24:46] written eye hath not seen nor ear heard
[24:49] neither have entered
[24:51] into the heart of man the things which
[24:53] God hath prepared for them that love but
[24:58] God hath revealed them unto us by his
[25:01] Spirit for the spirit searcheth all
[25:03] things yea the deep things so you see
[25:09] here that God prepared a level of faith
[25:14] for each and every one of you in order
[25:18] to overcome this dimension and in order
[25:21] to win this race for let them know what
[25:27] the things of God or what and the things
[25:31] of Matt save the spirit of Man which is
[25:34] in him even so the things of God will no
[25:39] man but the Spirit of God he see it's
[25:43] the Spirit of God that's in you it's
[25:45] that it's that election from before the
[25:49] foundations of the world that was placed
[25:51] in you that knows the things of God now
[26:01] we have received not the spirit of the
[26:04] world but the Spirit which is of
[26:07] government that we might build things
[26:10] that are freely given to us of God which
[26:14] things also we speak not in the words
[26:17] which man's wisdom teaches but which the
[26:20] Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual
[26:24] things with spiritual but the natural
[26:28] man receiveth not the things of the
[26:30] Spirit of God for they are foolishness
[26:32] unto you neither can he know them
[26:36] because they are spiritually discerned
[26:42] but he that is spiritual judgeth all
[26:45] things yet he himself is judged of no
[26:49] man for who have known the mind of the
[26:53] Lord that he
[26:54] Stockton but we have you see there's a
[27:01] big difference when God graduates you
[27:04] and places you into the body of Christ
[27:07] to fulfill his plan and purpose for your
[27:12] life in the summary interchange brother
[27:18] Brown talks about he told us the
[27:21] evidence or what would happen after
[27:24] being baptized with the Holy Ghost was
[27:27] that we would have the teacher come and
[27:29] teach all truth but that teacher was
[27:35] inside and inside of us everything that
[27:40] you have either many of you are facing
[27:44] certain situations maybe it's a health
[27:47] issue maybe it's you know a financial
[27:50] issue you know relationship issues
[27:54] whatever it is God has placed inside of
[27:57] you everything that you have either and
[28:01] he's he's saying I am the teacher I am
[28:03] the inner teacher that's gonna give you
[28:07] the faith that's going to give you the
[28:09] instruction it's gonna give you
[28:10] everything that you have Nina amen not
[28:14] an outside teacher if the spirit does
[28:17] the inside you wouldn't hear the truth
[28:20] and we seen it by revelation if you
[28:23] heard it every moment of the day you can
[28:27] read this Bible from front to back you
[28:31] can listen to brother
[28:32] messages you can feed constantly but if
[28:35] that inner teacher is not inside which
[28:38] is the Holy Ghost that you received when
[28:41] you were awakened by the Spirit of God
[28:43] by the spirit spoke and the prophecy
[28:46] came forth and called you into your
[28:48] position if that they didn't take place
[28:51] if that season didn't come in your life
[28:54] you would be able to receive this you
[28:56] would be able to overcome you would be
[28:58] able to know what to do it just be
[29:03] another Church memory you just be like
[29:05] anybody else up there just join the
[29:07] church become a member in a church
[29:09] there's a lot of people here becoming
[29:11] members of church it's not about being a
[29:14] member
[29:14] it's about being a son or daughter of
[29:17] God not the Spirit of God lives in you
[29:22] thousan you that direction got you it
[29:25] leads you praise God that was the side
[29:39] of the imploding spirit in the days of
[29:44] Pop those who were filled with the Holy
[29:46] Ghost heard the word received it and
[29:50] lived by you never aim to live this word
[29:55] you could ordained to overcome this by
[29:58] mention you've been ordained to live
[30:00] this race there's nothing that can stop
[30:03] you now you're gonna do this II just
[30:06] need to believe that you are what God
[30:09] said that you are
[30:10] [Music]
[30:13] not every promise that God made to you
[30:16] you can fulfill that promise because
[30:18] greater is He that is in you than he
[30:21] that is in great glory to God those who
[30:27] did not have the spirit heard it only as
[30:30] Carmel men putting on a rug
[30:33] interpretation and they live and they
[30:36] continued in sin you would continue in
[30:40] sin if it wasn't for the attribute that
[30:43] God placed in you from before the
[30:45] foundations of the world it'd be just
[30:48] like anybody else you go out there and
[30:50] you would live just like the rest of the
[30:52] world and you would have a religious
[30:54] spirit and you could think because you
[31:01] know they say if you just confess with
[31:03] your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord you
[31:06] will be saved you know they did watered
[31:09] down the word of God but you can't
[31:11] deceive a son or daughter of God you
[31:14] can't be fooled by something like that
[31:16] you know that there's more the church
[31:27] you know disciple I you know now I can
[31:30] see them on religious and I've joined
[31:32] the church it's more than that to you
[31:34] it's a reality because you know that God
[31:37] is a part of your your entire life
[31:41] everything that you do you think about
[31:44] what's possible you don't look at your
[31:46] circumstances and see that you know I
[31:49] hope I can do it know if you're a
[31:52] separate daughter of God you've been
[31:54] retained to overcome in this hour you
[31:57] should have the kind
[31:58] that allows you to walk through every
[32:01] situation regardless of what it is you
[32:05] listen you know you might think as a
[32:09] kernel individual that that is not
[32:12] possible but we're not looking at those
[32:14] things since when did we look at
[32:18] circumstances according to the Word of
[32:20] God where it said some things are
[32:23] possible
[32:23] it didn't say some things it said all
[32:27] things are possible that's what we come
[32:29] into the church that's what we come here
[32:31] every Wednesday every Sunday we try we
[32:34] try to get into the presence of God
[32:36] because we know that the Word of God
[32:38] that's be spoken right now by the Angels
[32:41] giving us faith to overcome in this life
[32:45] and circumstances seem to be things that
[32:52] we can't do because this is a fitness
[32:56] and this is a season or there's going to
[32:58] be people that are gonna literally
[32:59] disappear from this earth and beautiful
[33:03] bugs that are going to disappear all
[33:06] these events all these situations you
[33:09] know like I say all the time there's
[33:12] gonna be a day you know I keep saying to
[33:15] my wife and said well maybe you know you
[33:17] don't need you know this situation
[33:25] because we
[33:31] [Music]
[33:51] morning and sometime between you know
[33:54] brother said so morning you know maybe
[33:56] around yeah there's gonna be a sweet
[33:58] spirit of god that's gonna sweep down
[34:00] over your life you're gonna give that
[34:03] anointing that's gonna lift you up so
[34:05] much you're gonna be changed right there
[34:08] in bed and we're gonna believe this
[34:10] dementia-related behind the pressures of
[34:14] this right because listen Saints my god
[34:17] or cuz of the under pressure especially
[34:21] the pride we're constantly under
[34:24] pressure
[34:25] but because we're supposed to be under
[34:28] pressure it's because we are being
[34:31] squeezed out of this dimension we're
[34:34] being pushed by the Word of God there's
[34:37] a Word of God that keeps coming to us as
[34:40] sons and daughters of God that's giving
[34:43] us a faith to push out of this dimension
[34:47] it's a supernaturally that there's a
[34:50] there's a there's a there's a power
[34:52] that's being released released by the
[34:58] preaching of the word because cometh by
[35:03] hearing not hearing words but receiving
[35:09] the Lobos of God the word that can
[35:13] change you because it's going to take a
[35:16] supernatural word that's gonna change
[35:19] it's going to take a supernatural that's
[35:27] because the Spirit of God speaks it's
[35:59] you know looking at ability listen I

[36:16] when I set up the schedule and I missed
[36:18] a certain thing God knows and you know
[36:21] like why should I fear why what should
[36:25] we be afraid if I tell bastard
[36:27] assignment another brother it's not a
[36:29] maybe I could step in you know it's not
[36:31] a matter that he could step in or that I
[36:34] could step in but because there's a
[36:36] faith that's moving right now

[44:59] that brother branham had to preach all
[45:02] these messages so that they could store
[45:05] it up as food anybody can get all of
[45:09] those messages and there's a lot of
[45:11] people that listen to them three times
[45:13] or ten times more than you and they
[45:15] thought the Holy Ghost they've got the
[45:19] Holy Ghost so it's not matter just

[46:44] brother branham's back in those meetings
[46:46] back there in 1933 all the way up to
[46:52] 1965 he's the same with us

[47:04] looking for something new look for
[47:06] something real something that's gonna
[47:10] prove to you that you're gonna know that
