is not all then my brother my sister then you better get it right because God is doing something that is new in our life everyone if only you can believe that God is good it's nice you know when you stand here it's not easy it's not a place of joke it's a place whereby you put it everything that God has shown you you dedicate your life to bring the word you take it seriously because it's not everything you are saying you are going to stand before God and make account to it so you take it seriously and only God thanks be to him the Lord is good the Lord is good hey the Lord is good I'll listen I want you to shout and praise him because when you shout and praise him do you know all your tiredness all the pain you have or all the tries leave you that is a sign that Satan is getting away from you so that the Holy Spirit can come in and fulfill the word in your life in my life so when we come here we have to praise him no matter what happened pushing aside and giving praise push everything out of the door so that Jesus can come in and fulfill his word in your life because without him we are nothing without him I am nothing and you are nothing without him so let us shout and praise him as the word gonna come forth blessed be the name of the Lord as I said that is the appetite because I have to give appetite face before anything and I won't keep you long for stunning let's turn into the Bible I think John [Music] John chapter 8 verse 12. and it will be the second scripture will be second Corinthians 5 17. and my topic will be the light of life is God's wife for this hour so uh brother Desmond can you come and pray before we start read the scripture you can stand just in a way and pray then we read the scripture foreign yes Lord verses and guidance as we are the greatest speaker Mighty let the word of God for the tree through the house in Jesus name we pray amen amen the scripture is John Saint John chapter 8 verse 12. then speak Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life second Corinthians 5 17. therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature All Things Are pass away behold all things are becoming new may the Lord add his blessing may everyone sit down that's my scripture for tonight I think you got my topic so you see at this present hour the bride or you say the wife of Christ if I say the bride that means maybe his noun getting you but when I say wife when a man put a ring and married that woman becomes the man wife That Woman become so setting and know who she is that woman know that now that man is for me and me alone and Christ's children we know at this hour who we are what we are raised up for because the seed of God easyness before the foundations of this world and God has come down through the prophet and opening up the seventh seal told us what happened at the Garden of Eden through the how the serpent seduce if and begotten right so because of that when we came here spiritual Amnesia came to us and we didn't know who we are but at this hour we whom the Lord has called and let us know who we are and especially use the fight for Ministry which is our precious brother to train us by the word of God now we know who we are we know that the word is in us we know and we are so second of the word of God we have confidence that in Christ that oh now we see that the plan of God what was hidden in God's mind even the prophet didn't know some what God is doing at this hour God has made it known unto his wife because it was hidden that's why when the brother Abraham came his message was a mess age and the life has come out now when the Life come out we know we are the life that was hidden in that message we know that now we are the light of the world because Christ in us well the world is looking for Christ Christ means the anointed word and who is the anointed where you me working as the light of the world but to the world is hidden and to the even intellectual in the message is hidden but to the elect those that has received the light that came out the life that came out from the message we know who we are and what we have raised up for what the prophet is talking is now in reality in US we are not scared we we're not going to be pushed around no more because now we know who is our husband and her husband is with us like I and my father are one the father that dwell in me he does the words the father that dwell in you he does the words so it brings confidence he'd bring the power of God and bring the holy spirit in your life to shine that whosoever is looking for Christ the Lord come and contact you he will receive that light because you are the light of the world and this present hour the wife the wife of Christ in these last days in this generation we are the people there's no other people coming we are the last one and God has pour everything because the Bible says the least that was is in the kingdom of God is greater than John the Baptist that's why God has made no his word by his Spirit coming out to anoint the seeds the Seas who are his wife and no man can impersonated the word that is coming because they can is not by education it's not by man opinion or somebody teaching you is by the Holy Spirit himself God may know to his wife that hey you are the light of the world when I came here I I was the light of the world two thousand years back but I didn't do it all I hate some of you and now you are here my word I hate some of you now you are here so you whom I have made my word known to you you are part of me you are born of my bone Spirit of my spirit as our Pastor said we are portion of root of Devi the root of David so we are now made known make known to the world so whosoever one Christ let him come and take the Water of Life freely revelation 22 17. that's why the scripture says the spirit of Jesus Christ and the spirit of the Bride are what one because the Father the Son they are one and the Father the Son the Holy Spirit are one and it is you at this hour you that God is counting up you that the Holy Spirit has come to so the holy spirit is counting on you he's making himself known that now you are my wife you are not my friend or you are not my servant you are not somebody I just pick on the street and just use one day and throw out because a wife married a husband for the rest of the husband life and we marry Christ to Eternity he as many as to what eternity as he himself is eternal so are we eternals because nobody can impersonate the word of God because Jesus said my sheep will hear my voice who do you think he was talking to he know man with their ability as the serpent with his intelligent produce if so would man will come with Republic mind intellectual mind even in the message to coming calling themselves preachers but they are not calling themselves fight for Ministry but they are not so God by his grace at this hour just the seed that we're hidden that nobody thought don't cease are part of the faithful Ministry where it is sometimes churches hate them the message churches they don't allow them to come to the prophet that they don't allow them to to to to to for God to make manifest God is saying no I won't allow that I am I've come down myself at this hour just like a woman got pregnant and it's nine months when it's nine months the baby tried to do what push up and there's nothing gonna stop it no man can stop it because God has designed it and it's God Alone the holy spirit is doing it because it was him beginning and it will be him at the end that's why he said I am the first and the last because no man can do it no man can listen when I said secret things to my wife no matter how you come and try to hear it to peel it to understand it you know it because there is some things my wife know even I can bring my eye to her that's meaning my wife know that which PhD person can know that they cannot because it's not written it's not written okay but my wife understands that either I bring what it mean she knows how I behave certain ways my wife knows alone because why I and her are one and Christ and his bride are one so he goes to the bride individuals and reveal himself the unwritten part of the word and they come and they speak it you will stand there you will say what are they saying it's not what the brother Brown says this brother yes the prophet said that but what about the unwritten part of the word what about God's spirit coming down to reveal the word because God is doing that that part the devil can impersonated it because he has impersonated the written word of the Bible he has to impersonated the written word of the spoken word which is the written part which brother Brown spoke he has impersonated it all of it but he can impersonate the spirit of God which is life the life come out and he goes to the bride the wife of Christ Alone and God put a ring on them and they begin to know who he tell them who they are what position in him because let me tell you if I ever thought I will be standing here I'll be like a liar but when the comforter came when the Holy Spirit has come he let me know so I am second of God I have confidence of God listen I I respect any man but now it has gone beyond any man it has gone beyond personalities there's no such a thing God is the only one that interp is his own interpreter God is the only one that interpret the word even if you can't read and write like me better but God spirit will show you because at the day when he came Peter and John that people took knowledge that they were electric but they took knowledge that they are being with who Jesus Christ because the great Holy Spirit was upon them revealing the work interpreting the word without the Holy Spirit watch Peter and Peter he ran away he denied the Lord he was cow he was a man that whom couldn't even wanted to die for the gospel because why that time he don't have the Holy Ghost showed him yet but when the at the door of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit Came Upon them you saw because Judas has no part Judas know the letter he have a gift that's why they went out in Casa devils guests and calling our without repentance it's in the Bible and the prophet said it yes but the most important is when a man or a woman you have representation in heaven before the foundations of this world you were part of Christ others our God is looking for his own wife the wife that he has told before the foundations of this world if you are part no matter what you can even deny this but the Holy Spirit Will Reveal to you and you're gonna come out that's why the gospel we don't need to go bad people to come and join Church [Music] because the gospel is calling God is calling his own attribute those that were part of him that he has ordained and Trust now he's calling that's why when you meet somebody gone quick to judge don't quick even if they denying the gospel don't quit to judge because Satan has used so much tradition so much intellectuals dies and it has blinded the people so much that they don't know who they are some of them I remember even me when I heard about this gospel I fought with it you may say brother coffee you yes I fought with it I don't want to do nothing with it but the more I tried to run the more because it's like a horse that they have put chain on your neck where are you gonna run to you can't run nowhere you can run but you can't hide thank you my pastor you can run but you can't hide because it's not a man doing it it's not even a priest doing it is God himself the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ himself think about it but Abraham do you think it was him if it was him he could have make a mess a man with great servant in America one of the advanced countries in the world is America like a man like that who what church who allowed him in their puppet they were never allowed him they don't want him as a matter of fact his words will be like stinking their nose they don't want it but God says I have chosen I will confirm him to the world I will let him demonstrate my power that no man even his own enemies they couldn't deny it was the Lord it wasn't William Branham it was the Lord and at this hour God is saying I God came down 1963. open the sins God was here but the bride was not ready yet because we were born as babies so the Lord have to allowed us to grow grow in the world but he was here it's just like a man married to a woman they have to study one another so sometimes each and everyone tried to cover their fault to show to their husband oh I'm good I'm this I'm that but it will come to a time everything they are doing does complained you before one another they fight they do everything but they grow together like a barn God is saying my pride I have trained you since 1963 I came down up in the seals and begin to call the elect I have trained you I have opened up my way to you now I am showing things to you who you really are you are not just came to the world and die like anybody else or just go to church like everybody else let me tell you and let me say some of us we if we really know who we are we're not gonna stay home we're not going to stay home unless we are sick or something or work or something serious you'll be dedicated to the word you'll be serious put away you won't take it for granted you'll be serious about the word your life will be balanced your life you are not afraid listen sickness pay poverty riches those things you don't even care about it even though you have to work you will need money to do this that you not nothing once you there's a breath in your life and you can be you always will surrender to this you're surrendered to the way you won't be hypocrite you won't be a person that like this no sir you are serious about the way because the word is like the way you eat natural food so is it your spiritual food because Jesus has done great thing for you Jesus has let you know who you are when you know who you are you don't walk with your head down those days you see brother coffee walking with his head down has passed I don't remember it no more because now the king is in the camp the husband is in the camp when a woman don't have a husband and he has grow do you know how desperate some of them are they got so desperate it's not like a man women have certain age when they're rich and they don't have man then they have so much sadness in their face but let them get a husband which woman that is married that have the ring they're gonna hide a ring as soon as they go in party they're showing forgive me sisters but it's part of it their story that they are married as soon as they see their friends the first thing they show my ring do you know I married right right it's the truth they show the ring because they are married and so is it with a genuine Christian flies in with the wife of Christ when Christ is coming and showing you who you really are you can't walk with your head down you walk we're revering respect but you show that you have the ring you saw the ring is there and let me tell you everybody that sees it that knows you they will know this man this woman is married they'll know this sister is married to Christ they will know this brother is married to Christ because who have the light that will go and hit the light under the pillow am I lying on truth come on don't be like symmetry to me like I'm preaching to myself come on just pull the gift if you don't put a gift the gift doesn't go pray but when you pull it it will come out you understand when you pull that gift you're gonna see what is there I have gone some places even I have it on my phone baptizing people in Ghana my wife was right there baptized the girl as soon as he got baptized me and our last pastor know him but I baptized the guy finish the power of God hit her screaming fall down there get up speaking tongues he interpret it even denomination peace they were baptizing the river he knocked his head to me like this I know what God can do I'm not here for popularity oh off no I am just a simple coffee the way you see me the way I am if I make mistake I'll be ready to repent if I know if I don't know then I don't know but if God saw me I'm ready to repent I'm not a hip Pastor someone know me we went to Ghana and a guy we are driving prayer off sister Palmer was there Pastor Samos in the car I screamed with the guy I fought with the guy because I want to get things right I'm not gonna say it's my pastor so I'm Gonna Leave the guy like that to behave to do things that is not right even to do no I'll do everything right because let him know who you are if there is anything wrong he can help me but if I go ahead it under the ground you think my pastor can know and help me that's how so many people are they come in the church they want to hit things underground and and thinking why my life is this why my life is that put everything on the table when you put it the pastor can help you if it's a true Pastor he will help you because we know the hypocrite preachers has done so much message the people but the good ones when you know you know when you see you see some of us will be sitting here long time we know who is a true preacher like one brother tell me he says if I don't have Pastor Simon pray to me at this area I'm not going any church he says no he says I know what I got what God ordained him for me so the word that he gave me he does the job what should I need let us get serious it's not a man it's the Holy Spirit he is coming out he's showing himself in the form where even we we think not where let me tell you no man knows God's mind unless God reveal it with all your education all your big shots without God you are like us come with my literature all my literate and my everything without God I'm like skunk I think what what shall it profit a man or a woman if you gain the whole world and lose your soul so brothers and sisters let us love the Lord let him be our priority let him be our number one because he has told us who we are in him the church out there don't know some people they are better than us walking in the street they don't know rich people educated better than us they don't know God Came To You by grace he came to me by grace it's always Grace so when Grace has come to you don't make it turn like a disgrace because the Bible says the sense of God will judge the end who do you think is going to judge the air is you and me we are the face we're gonna judge that the people that we have preached to they turn the gospel down Grace was offered to them the light of the world was showing to them and they turned it down Jesus says the world will not see me but you will see me I will be with you to the end of the world wherever you go I'll be with you if you are abiding me my word abiding you as what you will what do you want from Christ what do you want that the Lord cannot do is the Lord hand too short that he can't do let me tell you me I'm not scared of anything because God I have seen him in reality I have seen him in reality I know before when I used to hear people talk god raise the day the Lord raised the day it was like a joke to me and they are talking and I used to say in my heart if the Lord raised the Dead I want to see it I want to see do you know what you did I keep it quiet or I didn't come out but this is the hour he did anything you ask him you do it if you abiding him people don't want to abide it with God like bro that's what I was saying you come to church even their tight pain it's a struggle they are offering pains a struggle how can you be blessed how can God use you you don't want to come to church how can God demonstrate all these things I'm talking you're gonna think when your brother or sister is talking you're gonna think you're joking you're gonna be like a something in here this guy is crazy this sister is crazy you talk too much because they have surrendered their life to Christ like that's what I was saying can God use me yes he can can God use you yes he can after all we came here some of us God has demonstrated himself doing prayer meetings during a Sunday service during a weekdays he even used to come down and tell us he said as during the week I send my way to you but when you come pray and I I come around and speak but I just want to sit in here brother Philip you come you saw some of it right they're all told us and yet people won't come to church you wanna see that race you want to see people walking you want to see blind eye open those things are not joke one time me and brothers when we used to come to church snow so much till we we can't see our way from Toronto to Wauna we have to go under the bridge we reach home midnight draws this brother that's when you have your white granddaughter I used to meet brother of issue brother Mark things was tough on me till I reach I used to sleep at Dupont and dandas uh until they have a community from Tallow if you need otaro housing that's where we were staying with my wife that time Paul was born I believe work four o'clock I meet bra Vision at Subway Kipling Subway Station I come to church in wawuna he dropped me at Subway by the time I go home that time I don't have money by the time I go home no food so I have to eat oranges next money I'm going to work I put the Lord first brother Philip one time I'm sitting in brother my car brother Mike Alvin your brother sister Rosemary and the Lord spoke to me he wanted me to go live in general French people want the Lord to use them sometimes Pastor Samuel is talking about his life and I'm seeing my I'm sitting in the church and I'm seeing similar things happening to me then I'll says what is the brother knows me it seems most of the thing he's talking is about me we want to China and French live there one of the bedroom two they give us two-bedroom Montello housing four fourth uh 415 driftwood we're living inside there one of the room no heat and every Friday night that time even I don't have money to buy carpet for the womb so I went and bought pieces of carpet pieces that they are selling remain every Friday night around 12 to 1 o'clock water will come in the room and wear the carpet and they come I've reported to the office they come they broke it checked all the pipe nothing is wrong but the water don't come 12 o'clock to one o'clock Friday night my wife have to sit down crying cleaning it the womb smells thing I'm so even ashamed to bring my brothers and sisters to the room but all those things were tries all those things God want me to go through because he wants somebody in that area and I will be I obey the Lord one time me and my wife was eating we had power power because they have reported and they caught the person we looked the window somebody shot somebody 13 years boy they have shot him even I call police they catch the boy so I can sell it and my wife was criminal in his life he never see something like that but me I have seen all those things so it wasn't new to me right people want God to use them but you watch brother Philip is sitting down there it was the same area I met brother Philip so if I didn't go there this brother won't come and if I didn't go there like my wife's sister Rose will not get a husband he live in Africa and you need a husband and see how the Lord orchestrated it I won't say they are married let them talk I don't know right so people they want God to use them but you think you're gonna use you in your comfortable Zone they come to church what they want to do is what they want to do but sometimes God what you don't want to do God gonna say do it would you the thing you don't like the thing that the most thing that was thinking your nose God will tell you do it and you let listen I have claim the church more than anybody and I've seen things some people you even call them brother help me oh the Lord didn't call me to clean Brown Philip is there the Lord didn't call me to clean but one day one becomes they want to go for it when they want trustee they want to go for it I've seen all that the Lord show listen sometimes I don't know God show me things and I'm just down there and he said you see I say yes Lord even sometimes my with my mother I want to open he says no keep your mouth zip it's not yet okay because why you want God the things you don't want that's where you get his glory when you do it he will get his glory the pastor May patch your back for what you are doing but is that what God wants in your life is that what God called you for you think me I want to stand here and preach you think I want to you don't know how hard God get me because I know I can do it I'm literally I cannot do it so I don't want it but if I don't come I didn't obey him I didn't obey him then who am I gonna please please a man no sir let God get a glory Let Jesus get the glory when God God get a glory I am nothing that is okay because God is the one that I come to worship God is the one that give me eternal life God is the one that giving you eternal life and he's telling you I came here I give all for you would you give all for me would you do things that I don't want you don't want things that I will show you sometime a look you are dying you look you are going the grave but you are praising him you are lifting him up you don't care about your life you don't care what anybody thinks but him alone him alone in you and you will say thou good and faithful servant like Stephen that people didn't like Stephen there's told him after preaching the gospel but when they stole him and he was dying all the Angels stood for him because he did the job the Lord was so pleased about Stephen he saw a priests about Moses he saw a priests about William Abraham is your turn your thing the Lord wants you to do what he wants you to do we sing a song where he Lead Me I will follow would you follow him would you give all of your life would you allow him to lead you because sometimes he Lead You In a Strange way a strange way not the way people think because he is God and his God Alone he said I am jealous God is jealous of you you everywhere whether you are sleeping whether you are working whether you are coming to church even if you are not coming still jealous of you because his grace he has given to you he has already placed the seed of himself in you and that seed won't return void whether you serve him you don't hit the series there like Saul he went to the winch of Endor did that didn't stop God allowed even the witch of Andrew to see his servant Samuel and a woman scream he told so what you like me do you have lied so I went to heaven he wanted to kill David God servant god king that he anointed that didn't stop God and says Saul has done bad so I push Saul away and so is you no matter what you do once the Holy Ghost is on you but do you love Christ are you willing to obey him are you willing to Shine the Light sometimes it take you to Dark Places places nobody know one time I want to place in Africa I was sitting in a car at the bottom of the car we're driving in that wood and that's what's coming I have to use this kind of big one to cover my nose to go and tell about Christ and when I was I read there the Lord was saying to me why did you do this I could not speak but it's coming some it's like somebody talking from my heart why do you do this you did this because of me I cried the whole day and when I read the let me tell you I saw God says you did this I will let you see this I begin to see the power of God people even Muslims people that God was displaying himself in front of me some time till I I'm sleeping I'm crying I say Lord I know I can't do this this is sup like you you doing so much for me to see I can't even go testifying the church they may think I'm crazy or some will say I'm talking too much I'm too low and this didn't happen that didn't like they begin to question me let me tell you enough America we have too much knowledge I'm gonna stop not too long sometimes too much knowledge let's blow all that knowledge out and take God at his word when we take God as his word we become like dummy in the eyes of the people that's how God can move you're you're all you like like one minute you don't know one minute God can come and speak through you and do things show you things that you yourself you know you it's not something you reason you're thinking look listen me I preach I don't use that's the way the Lord has shown me he says Coffee you are literally I'm not going to use you like the way I use Pastor Simon or Philip or Desmond or or Danny or tembie or Christopher I have them in that way but you just go there with the the little scripture I gave you go there with it open your mouth and talk I will be there I know that from him so every time I come here I have confidence I have confidence that's what I have I don't know the quote but that's why you don't see me quoting brother Brown this that I listened to the tip of all I know I listen to the third brother brown paper sermon preaching days that how are you gonna do it coffee don't know but I'm just like a cow I just threw it and I come here but you you pray with me God gonna show you that is not coffee you see God gonna show to you that is not me it's him and that's what we must be too much knowledge will make us puffed up we think we know and yet we don't know nothing we will miss the simple things the way God moves the way God do things me I want to be simple like Isaiah he told Isaiah go sleep on the street cut your bomb and the fabric how many of you if the Lord told you tonight to go do such a thing would you do it and yeah they called himself believer they will say no no no no this is like to mean leprosy the people gonna laugh at me I'm crazy up this and maybe educated maybe I'm too much days he's the same God never change if you use Isaiah Moses Noah brother Abraham John the Baptist he's the same God look at how he has come in this church he's preaching you you can see his English and his case but if you are looking for God you're gonna see Mighty God in his preaching God doesn't care about your education or how much you can talk you only care about his word and your only concern about his predestinated seat he has placed us here under his servant that he himself has trained from 12 years he called him surrender his entire life build him and give us to him some of us I want to buy a decimal town a small village and I was standing there and I said my goodness I thought I come from Village but this one come from Village anyway he's one of the king they they have so much land over there and if you see how God brought him out from that place when I was there I was even lifting my hand and thanking God I said God if you have done this me like I'm on Main Street like going to the big city and the capital I'm in the middle but that's more it's like you go out of nowhere right some like it's nowhere and God move and go and bring this brother here and see how the Lord has used this brother then you know that God is God that tells you God is God and he turned the hand of God to do that God showed me that first I am God you see what I've done I can do for you I can let you do whatever you think is impossible and God is doing that with me it's beyond me I can't do it no I can't I don't have that brain but the grace of God has told me I am the light I should let the light shine they see this in me they see this in you let your light shine you are the light of the world that's the message I have God
