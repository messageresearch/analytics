[0:51] and the honor and the praise
[0:54] our our topic for today
[0:58] or the thought god would uh
[1:01] wants me to express is
[1:05] water from the well
[1:08] of bethlehem i repeat
[1:12] water from the well
[1:15] of bethlehem our scripture
[1:19] is found in ii samuel
[1:23] chapter 23 verses
[1:28] 13 to 17
[1:31] shall we read
[1:34] you may open your bibles and we
[1:38] can read together i will read
[1:42] now from 2nd samuel
[1:45] chapter 23 reading from verse
[1:49] 13 to 17
[1:53] and three of them
[1:56] mighty of the 30
[2:00] uh chief went down
[2:03] and came to david in the harvest time
[2:08] unto the cave of adullam
[2:12] and the troop of the philistines
[2:16] pitched in the valley
[2:19] of rifahim and david was then
[2:24] in and hold and the garrison
[2:29] of the philistines was then
[2:32] in bethlehem
[2:35] and david longed and said
[2:39] oh that one would give me a drink of
[2:43] water
[2:45] of the will of bethlehem
[2:48] which is by the gate and the three
[2:53] mighty men break through
[2:57] the hosts of the philistines
[3:00] and drew water out of the
[3:04] well of bethlehem that was by the gate
[3:09] and took it and brought it to david
[3:14] nevertheless he would not drink
[3:17] thereof but
[3:20] poured it out unto the lord
[3:25] and he said be it far
[3:28] from me o lord that i
[3:31] should do this is not this
[3:35] the blood of the men that went
[3:38] in jeopardy of their lives
[3:41] therefore he would not drink it these
[3:45] things that these three
[3:48] mighty men praise be to our god
[3:53] let us pray sweep
[3:56] by our head spirit of who we are whether
[4:00] in our homes
[4:02] whether in the a house of god
[4:05] whether in a field whether
[4:09] under a large tree in africa
[4:12] whether in a great uh
[4:16] uh high-rise building
[4:20] in singapore
[4:24] or somewhere
[4:28] among the brethren in hong kong
[4:32] wherever the believers are gathered
[4:36] africa india china

[5:02] spread out his great power of his divine
[5:06] self and manifest the word and declare
[5:11] himself

[5:14] glorified and
[5:16] crowned king of kings and lord of lords
[5:20] father this day may thy name be
[5:23] glorified
[5:24] may you receive all our praise all or
[5:27] the honor and all the glory as we commit
[5:31] ourselves into your
[5:33] hand for service in
[5:36] jesus christ's name we pray
[5:39] amen and amen
[5:42] praise god water
[5:46] from the well of bethlehem
[5:50] now in the bible there are
[5:54] many mentions of wells
[5:58] several wells are mentioned four in
[6:01] particular
[6:03] i mentioned tonight today
[6:06] so that you may be familiar with them
[6:11] there is first of all the outstanding
[6:14] will of abraham
[6:20] then that is the well of course that was
[6:24] stopped up uh by the philistines and
[6:27] isaac had to uh dig out the rubbish and
[6:31] let the waters flow again
[6:36] oh then there is the well of
[6:40] nehor that is the well by which
[6:43] eliezer met
[6:46] rebecca and spoke to her
[6:50] about isaac
[6:54] then there of course is
[6:57] the well of bethlehem
[7:00] of which we shall speak of
[7:04] then there is jacob's will
[7:08] by which jesus met the woman
[7:12] of samaria it's very significant to me
[7:17] how that god would meet and
[7:20] deal with lots
[7:23] of believers in the bible
[7:27] by a well and so i believe
[7:31] that a well has great significance
[7:35] in the eyes and in the mind of god
[7:40] of course my brothers
[7:44] we are speaking about the will
[7:47] of bethlehem in connection with this
[7:52] story of david
[7:56] now david as you know
[8:00] was elected by god to be king of all
[8:03] israel
[8:05] saul was then popular among the people
[8:11] great in size his shoulders his reach
[8:15] his organ his organization
[8:19] or his body was was really
[8:22] big large powerful and of course
[8:26] being a king he was uh very
[8:29] wealthy and had lots of
[8:32] financial support he had lots of
[8:35] membership
[8:36] lots of soldiers that were there to
[8:39] carry out
[8:41] his will and here we
[8:44] find while he was
[8:47] apparently yet in power
[8:50] god had already anointed his replacement
[8:56] god had already anointed or elected
[9:01] david and then
[9:05] sent samuel to his father's house and
[9:08] his father
[9:09] called him so he was elected
[9:13] and he was called and while
[9:16] there samuel was able to identify
[9:20] and anoint david
[9:23] as king never mind his brothers
[9:27] were more handsome or they were taller
[9:30] or
[9:30] bigger in stature or even admired
[9:34] more by the people yet god
[9:37] chose david as simple
[9:40] and as humble a shepherd that he
[9:44] was but here
[9:47] we see david
[9:51] a fugitive in his own land
[9:56] because of the jealousy of saul
[10:00] the fear of this king
[10:04] and that's usually what happens to
[10:07] denominations whenever
[10:08] a real god set heaven set revival breaks
[10:12] out
[10:12] they become fearful they become jealous
[10:16] because they don't know what the holy
[10:19] spirit will do
[10:20] and they may lose soldiers or members
[10:24] they may lose people who will then
[10:28] recognize the evil of this
[10:32] man-made
[10:35] organization placed on the earth calling
[10:39] itself the church of god
[10:42] and so they get very angry and worked up
[10:46] assault was the bible said it was an
[10:49] evil
[10:49] spirit that entered into saul that
[10:52] caused him to act that way
[10:54] and i don't i don't think there's been a
[10:57] change i think it's the same thing
[11:00] it may be a religious one but it's still
[11:02] an angry
[11:03] evil spirit that gets upon the
[11:07] organization and causes the people
[11:11] to act that way so here was david
[11:16] a tape of christ who
[11:19] is the word of god
[11:22] and yet when he should be accepted
[11:26] in the house of god when the true
[11:29] word of god should be accepted in the
[11:32] kingdom of god
[11:34] we find that the word of god
[11:37] is rejected by the people
[11:40] and by especially the leaders
[11:44] think of it the word
[11:47] david the king jesus the messiah
[11:52] a fugitive among his own people
[11:57] came into his own
[12:00] and there received him not
[12:04] all but as many as received him
[12:07] that them gave he the power to become
[12:10] the
[12:11] sons and daughters of the living god
[12:14] amen so here was david
[12:20] my friends i believe it was a really hot
[12:24] day
[12:26] and david
[12:30] in the cave of adolem
[12:33] no doubt the sweat
[12:36] was pouring down from his body
[12:40] from his face he was
[12:43] thirsty and hot
[12:48] and there he was protected
[12:52] by three mighty men
[12:55] many others but the bible in particular
[12:59] mentions these three mighty men
[13:03] three mighty men in other words he had
[13:06] these
[13:06] three bodyguards or we may say
[13:10] three armor bearers around him
[13:14] and i believe every pastor needs to have
[13:19] mighty men around him trusted
[13:22] men around him loyal men around him
[13:26] oh yes god would have
[13:30] that had david protected
[13:34] by these mighty men
[13:38] oh praise god hallelujah
[13:41] amen and those men
[13:44] protected them physically and i believe
[13:48] god unless brother branham said a
[13:51] pastor his deacons
[13:54] his mighty men should be protecting him
[13:58] even naturally physically
[14:01] then that should protect him spiritually
[14:03] his reputation
[14:06] the things that are said about him were
[14:08] done around him
[14:10] there to protect him every in
[14:13] every possible way
[14:17] there was david sun shining
[14:21] down in the hot heat of the middle east
[14:26] there in the hills of judea
[14:30] as the bright shade sunshine
[14:34] came down with its blistering heat
[14:37] david was thirsty
[14:41] thirsty for water oh
[14:44] he needed to have a fresh drink of water
[14:49] and i believe every true
[14:53] seed of god will thirst for the moisture
[14:58] that comes from the spirit of god
[15:01] every true seed of god will thirst
[15:05] for the refreshing reigns of the holy
[15:08] spirit
[15:10] that only comes from the presence of
[15:13] almighty god
[15:14] only he can bring no
[15:18] bands no groups
[15:21] no amount of shouting singing running
[15:24] the floors
[15:25] that's good for your emotions that good
[15:28] for the release of your
[15:30] stress and your pressure but that will
[15:33] not refresh the soul of a true believer
[15:37] oh praise god amen brother sister
[15:41] the great holy spirit of almighty god
[15:45] in this day and in this hour
[15:48] wants his seed his children to
[15:51] thirst after him because every seed
[15:56] will have that thirst because in them
[15:59] and you know naturally for a seed to
[16:02] grow
[16:03] we you would place some water on it
[16:07] place it in the soil place some water on
[16:10] it
[16:10] and the water and the soil around it
[16:15] will cause it to germinate
[16:18] and sprout and begin to show
[16:21] the life that was in that seed
[16:25] that appeared dead your life
[16:29] your past you may have appeared
[16:33] dead even in a church
[16:37] yet you may appeared as if there was
[16:41] nothing
[16:41] much in you oh but you
[16:45] once let this water of
[16:48] la everlasting life the living waters of
[16:52] the holy spirit of almighty god strike
[16:55] your soul
[16:57] and the holy ghost amen will move within
[17:00] you
[17:01] wake up the seed that god planted in you
[17:05] the great sore
[17:06] went forth to sow and planted seeds upon
[17:10] the earth not the dirt but
[17:12] in you and me who is the earth
[17:15] of this hour and the spirit of god
[17:18] now waters it and causes it to come to
[17:21] life
[17:22] and to spring up into genuine
[17:25] everlasting life not church life
[17:28] not just religious life but the
[17:32] life of christ in you projecting itself
[17:36] making itself known that others may
[17:39] see him and come to know him
[17:42] in the power of his resurrection
[17:45] hallelujah and while
[17:48] david was in that cave
[17:52] with the sweat and the heat
[17:55] the itching is scratching upon him
[17:59] and he was thinking
[18:02] about that well down there
[18:06] in bethlehem
[18:09] and speaking to himself as we would say
[18:14] the english would say is in a solidify
[18:18] which means to say he's unconsciously
[18:21] speaking oh i i oh i
[18:24] wish i could have a drink of that fresh
[18:28] cool water down from the
[18:31] uh the well there at the gate
[18:34] of bethlehem hallelujah
[18:38] and while david was speaking to himself
[18:42] solely quizing not realizing that he
[18:45] could
[18:45] be heard overheard and it just came to
[18:49] pass
[18:50] that these mighty men overheard
[18:54] david's desire
[18:57] david did not command them david did not
[19:00] tell them
[19:01] david did not ask them but they
[19:04] overheard
[19:05] him he overheard the desire that he had
[19:09] in his heart
[19:10] to be able to drink fresh
[19:14] water from the well of bethlehem
[19:19] that is just similar to us praying
[19:23] or sitting or reading our scriptures
[19:26] and then all of a sudden we catch a
[19:29] revelation
[19:30] from the mind of god god doesn't didn't
[19:34] command you
[19:35] god didn't beg you god didn't do
[19:37] anything but the revelation strikes your
[19:39] soul you know what you must do it
[19:42] strikes your heart you know
[19:44] how you should obey praise the lord god
[19:47] amen oh it's those mighty men
[19:52] are types of
[19:55] believers who are
[19:58] walking in relationship with the word of
[20:03] god the word of god which is
[20:06] our king word our word which is
[20:10] god king god hallelujah
[20:14] and we walk in a relationship
[20:17] with him glory to god hallelujah
[20:21] amen yes sir praise god
[20:25] these were not just ordinary men
[20:28] claiming they're christian or claiming
[20:29] their believers
[20:30] these were men who mightily
[20:34] believed the word and held on to the
[20:37] word
[20:38] loyal to the word o faithful man
[20:41] praise god and these men were of such
[20:45] that they are named in the bible first
[20:48] of all
[20:50] there was a dino the
[20:53] s knight this man
[20:57] slew 800 men
[21:01] with his spear within his hand
[21:04] what a warrior a mighty man of god
[21:08] that would win souls to christ that
[21:11] would win
[21:13] hundreds thousands amen to jesus christ
[21:17] here it was he slew 800 philistines
[21:23] with his spear there was eliezer son of
[21:26] dodo
[21:28] he slew the philistines
[21:31] until his hands were so
[21:35] weary that he gripped the sword
[21:39] and fought with the philistines and when
[21:42] the fight was over
[21:44] he couldn't he could not open his hand
[21:47] to get the sword out because his hand
[21:50] had a grip upon that sword of course the
[21:54] sword is a type of the word of god
[21:57] when the true believer gets a grip
[22:00] of that word of god and the word of god
[22:03] is held in their hand
[22:05] of faith revelation
[22:08] they're using the word by revelation or
[22:11] by faith
[22:12] dear you're understanding the word by
[22:15] faith
[22:15] they're cutting the devil left right
[22:18] center
[22:19] disease sickness pain depression
[22:23] blood pressure just you're destroying
[22:25] the devil's kingdom
[22:27] oh praise god and he was able
[22:30] to defeat those philistines praise
[22:34] god hallelujah then there was
[22:37] shama son of aggie
[22:41] who slew a whole troop of philistines
[22:46] imagine an army troop of philistines
[22:50] came out and they were gonna rob the
[22:53] israelites
[22:54] of a field of lentils beans that they
[22:58] had planted
[22:59] and they began to run away
[23:03] when they saw the philistines and shama
[23:06] stood there
[23:07] and dared them to come and they came
[23:10] down
[23:10] and the bible tells us he destroyed the
[23:14] entire troop of philistines with the
[23:18] spear that which was within his hands
[23:22] we give god the glory hallelujah
[23:25] so there was david
[23:29] filled with frustration
[23:34] walking back and forth within that cave
[23:38] oh what a hot day
[23:41] sweat pouring down his brow
[23:46] and saul may even come this way
[23:49] along with the philistines not only do i
[23:52] have the sinners against me
[23:54] not do i only have the unbeliever
[23:56] philistines against me
[23:58] but there is you know saul
[24:03] type of the denominational religious
[24:06] believer who should really be for me
[24:10] who should really say i don't understand
[24:12] what you're doing
[24:13] but brother sister will support you will
[24:17] will will stand by no he
[24:20] david was afraid of being attacked at
[24:23] the same time
[24:24] by saul on one hand and by the
[24:27] philistines
[24:28] on the other hand and that's where the
[24:31] true believer
[24:32] find themselves in this hour but we are
[24:35] not afraid but we hold the sword of the
[24:38] word of god
[24:40] and hold to god's unchanging hand and
[24:43] chop the head of the devils off right
[24:46] left
[24:46] center this way that way we hold to
[24:50] god's eternal word and press the battle
[24:53] air the night will veil the growing
[24:56] skies
[24:57] amen hallelujah amen praise
[25:00] god oh he said i want to get
[25:05] some of that fresh water from the
[25:08] gates of bethlehem's well there's no
[25:12] water like that water
[25:14] david did not just want any water
[25:17] but he wanted the specific water
[25:20] cool refreshing water that
[25:24] comes from the well of bethlehem
[25:28] well you know bethlehem
[25:32] was the center the water where they can
[25:35] get water
[25:36] it was also the bread center which we
[25:39] will touch on that
[25:40] later on for bethlehem means god's
[25:44] house of bread house of bread
[25:47] it was a provincial center of water
[25:51] and of wheat and other grains
[25:55] but in palestine
[25:59] there's known to be some bad water
[26:03] not all the word of god you hear
[26:05] preached
[26:06] is good for you
[26:09] some may be using that word for their
[26:12] own purposes
[26:15] but in palestine there is some bad water
[26:19] evil waters within that
[26:23] place if you drink it
[26:26] you may end up have a black water fever
[26:31] and you start to groan and you start to
[26:34] jump
[26:35] and move because you got some kind of a
[26:39] black water fever got a hold of you
[26:43] all kinds of stuff in that kind
[26:46] of water and a lot of that water
[26:50] can even kill you if you drink too much
[26:53] of it it may want to
[26:57] tend to kill you david in the
[27:01] mouth of that cave looking down in the
[27:05] valley
[27:06] and let me say i've actually been there
[27:11] and seen from where those
[27:14] three mighty men had to fight
[27:17] their way over the mountains
[27:21] and go down on the other side to
[27:24] bethlehem
[27:26] draw the water and fight their way
[27:29] and come all the way back to where david
[27:32] was
[27:34] and it is said that the distance was
[27:37] 18 miles they chopped their way
[27:41] they used the spear they used the sword
[27:44] in every possible way and fought their
[27:48] way
[27:48] back to back hallelujah through those
[27:52] demons through the philistines and they
[27:55] chopped their way for 80 miles
[27:58] into the city of bethlehem to go
[28:02] and get some fresh water from the well
[28:05] of bethlehem
[28:06] to bring it for david hallelujah
[28:10] go brothers and sisters think of it
[28:13] think of what kind of a battle and
[28:15] remember this
[28:16] the philistines knew they were coming
[28:20] and when they were coming back the
[28:23] philistines had time to prepare for them
[28:26] to attack them when they were coming
[28:28] back but they
[28:30] went got the water and
[28:33] came back with it without spilling it
[28:36] and they destroyed all of those
[28:39] philistines
[28:40] that stand in their way let me tell you
[28:44] this word of god is true one will chase
[28:48] a thousand
[28:49] two will change ten thousand if people
[28:52] are united if the sons and daughters of
[28:55] the living god
[28:56] are united as one we can tear
[28:59] down the walls of jericho we can
[29:02] break chase out those devils out of our
[29:06] homes out of our
[29:07] houses out of our places of worship out
[29:10] of our hearts praise
[29:12] god we have the authority we have the
[29:14] power
[29:15] amen we have this word that's been
[29:17] revealed to us
[29:18] in this day and in this hour blessed be
[29:22] the name

[31:32] word as such
[31:33] but testifying telling the goodness of
[31:36] jesus telling of their deliverance
[31:38] talking to god
[31:40] telling the people how good god is how

[52:58] you got supernatural protection
[53:00] hallelujah
[53:01] where the holy ghost the spirit of god

[53:16] believer may hurt the sinner over there
[53:18] is that
[53:19] but a real believer it will not hurt you
[53:22] so take it as soon as you can
