[0:00] but God just sits back and says he was
[0:16] gonna call somebody else to preach
[0:18] Wednesday night it was gonna be this
[0:23] video looking for excuses because the
[0:25] arrows fight that was was it for this
[0:28] idea for that side
[0:29] Oh what are you gonna do what when you
[0:31] can't do nothing I can do absolutely
[0:32] nothing
[0:33] I totally never comes the time that I
[0:39] come up here think you know I got
[0:40] something unless I tell you that I have
[0:44] something Lord but if I come to bring
[0:49] some kind of history or something the
[0:54] hidden mysteries Christ Himself coming
[0:58] down fast
[1:00] amen and how he's doing it his warrants
[1:05] say you can impersonate this no well we
[1:08] were experiencing right now right here
[1:11] sink another person in this because he
[1:14] said very
[1:20] I can figure what it is that these
[1:23] people constantly Halloween because he
[1:27] cannot receive revelation this is a mr.
[1:32] this is what brother Brett was talking
[1:33] about he says the mystery you know you
[1:37] look at Ephesians talks about the
[1:39] mystery of the fellowship well this is
[1:42] it what we're experiencing is the
[1:45] mystery of the fellowship of the sons
[1:48] and daughters of God coming together and
[1:58] when you get into an experience with God
[2:10] [Music]
[2:20] [Music]
[2:23] it's the part of the word that you are
[2:26] that represented you from before the
[2:29] foundations of the world you cannot be
[2:32] beaten you cannot be deceived
[2:34] you cannot that's why Jesus people he
[2:37] was he knew exactly who he was we stood
[2:40] there before all those Pharisees and
[2:42] Sadducees and said father because they
[2:48] did exactly what the word said it would
[2:52] never pass but he knew a son of God
[2:59] cannot sin he knew that there's this
[3:02] there's no way that you can sit as an
[3:06] attribute of God you are sinners because
[3:09] it's the part of God that you are that's
[3:13] what God is positionally please oh look
[3:17] at yourself
[3:19] I don't have this I'm not very good at
[3:23] that though look at that's colonel see
[3:29] the attribute of God that's in you
[3:31] that's who you really are
[3:33] that's what has overcoming power that's
[3:37] the one that's greater that's in you
[3:39] it's in he that it's greater the one
[3:45] that's in use really the events in the
[3:47] world that's what it's not you you don't
[3:51] have anything but you've been anointed
[3:55] for before the foundations of the world
[3:58] to manifest a son or a daughter of God
[4:02] and this is what you are consciously
[4:05] coming into this is what that spiritual
[4:08] amnesia that gets lifted from your life
[4:10] brings you into it brings you into
[4:14] recognizing before the fall and this is
[4:28] what we're PB snort back to we are being
[4:32] restored back to from before fall where
[4:36] we were two terminal sons and daughters
[4:38] of God
[4:40] there's potentials in that position in
[4:43] that sonship in that daughter ship they
[4:47] could speak the verb and the elements
[4:51] would have to obey because they were
[4:54] given supreme authority we are now being
[4:59] restored back to this Sunday of the
[5:05] ministering again so please keep it in
[5:07] Brereton we're going to be moving into
[5:10] that realm we're going to be seeking the
[5:15] Lord into this area of how it is that be
[5:19] as sons and daughters of God would sure
[5:21] to a place where we can speak the Word
[5:24] of God not just speaking out
[5:29] that's not what we're talking about it's
[5:31] coming into a revelation of who you are
[5:34] and that when you're in your decision
[5:36] something takes place something
[5:39] supernatural starts to speak out of you
[5:41] and starts to place others
[5:45] it's this is a body movement this is the
[5:48] manifestation of the sons of God the
[5:51] adoption is all about placing it's all
[5:54] about you know if you go back into the
[5:56] Old Testament you look back Josh he came
[5:59] into the promised land you will notice
[6:01] that everything from that point on was
[6:03] alcohol the placing of the tribes of
[6:06] Israel giving each one their position
[6:09] what it was that they were doing and
[6:11] every mother that brought forth that
[6:14] child actually was in birth pains that
[6:17] she was bringing for that child an
[6:19] inspiration a revelation would
[6:22] strengthen their heart and their names
[6:24] would be spoken which actually
[6:27] positionally placed and gave them the
[6:30] character the and the ability to be what
[6:33] it was that they were supposed to be
[6:34] that's all part of the placing of the
[6:37] body of Christ of the placing of the
[6:40] sons and daughters of God and this is
[6:43] what we're coming into we talked about
[6:46] we've read it we've studied it in the
[6:49] past but there there has to come a
[6:51] season where it comes into season into
[6:56] its present stage isn't into the present
[6:59] stage of its ministry and where
[7:02] individuals now begin to read
[7:04] how about how is actually operating
[7:08] around their lives how to become
[7:09] conscious of it because perfect faith is
[7:14] what you can consciously recognize what
[7:17] the Holy Spirit is doing in your life to
[7:20] affect the body of Christ we don't want
[7:23] to go too much further
[7:24] let the musicians come we're gonna close
[7:30] it off here but tonight was how it is
[7:38] that God is building the body and love
[7:42] building the body and love because of
[7:45] that relationship
[7:46] because we've come into that
[7:47] relationship it's a it's a different
[7:50] purpose it gives you different
[7:54] motivation for coming to church it
[7:59] should get you excited about about your
[8:02] purpose in being here and being a part
[8:05] of this ministry at this time this
[8:08] you're a part of this ministry at this
[8:11] time it's not a coincidence it's not
[8:14] listen everything isn't the perfect plan
[8:16] of God you may have been in another
[8:18] Church five years ago you may have it in
[8:22] another city five years ago but then you
[8:26] find yourself here
[8:31] God has a purpose for that you want to
[8:35] recognize that is because God God needs
[8:39] to fulfill his word and you're a part of
[8:42] that word and you can't miss it
[8:44] and there's no way he's gonna let you
[8:46] miss it you can't miss it if you
