to thank god for his goodness god bless you brother glad to have you here amen uh and to let you know that this is a wonderful wonderful day and opportunity for us as believers in christ just please be seated just for a moment uh first of all um i must bring to your attention of course you're aware in the natural world that there is a war that is ongoing right now right well we know the prophet already told us watch russia watch russia king of the north we know the scriptures tell us that gog and magog tubal and meshech when you look those words it tells you plain top lost moscow it's in the bible right it's in hebrew so people don't realize that then the cities were named the countries were named and tells how um um the the beer and the dragon are going to go after the oil in israel which we know the bear is russia and the dragon is china and the bible already tells these things so modern events are now being made clear by the vindication of prophecy [Music] we are seeing it we're experiencing it we're a part of it and we're in the middle of it but we must thank god that we have eyes to see millions are there out there and they have no idea of what is really happening why do you you can sit back and rest because this is the time of ruth waiting waiting for the coming of the kinsmen redeemer to take her out of this world full of human effort and works and and and this and that just to stay alive you rather grasp here and grasp a little there gleam here and clean a little over there and the kinsman redeemer thank god is on his way and i want to praise and give glory to god for this golden hour that we are living in and that he has brought us into a state of perfect realization that we can clearly see and understand the unfolding of prophecy mighty god making himself clear and plain before us oh thanks be to god god bless you brother thinking of you just last night and thinking of all the older believers sorry for calling you older but some of the older believers i'm thinking of the different ones that started out this race way back from the old white church there um some are still here today but myself and wife are remarking most are gone amen some others barely slipped in before we moved from that church amen praise god but we thank god for his grace but see it's not that building is the tent and it's not some tent in some city or some state or someplace like that it's not some tent like brother branham first used to think that he had to get a b tent and have people in it the tent was his message amen just like is called his thing a net right and all the people would be in that and then out of that god is going to now do the separation and division and things of that nature so i thank god that i am here today and it's becoming so real that my thank god is even becoming more real to me amen it's not just this flippant uh without any depth or understanding where christians go around they're saying hallelujah thank you jesus thank you lord no no no no no no no this is with a reality that has struck the soul something that will never die can never leave because if he has got a hold of us it's not like me telling you it's not me telling you oh i got the holy ghost so you got the holy ghost well it's turned the other way he'd better have you hallelujah this is not the child trying to i'm holding on lord i might make it no the child is not now holding on to the parent the parent took his hand and grabbed a hold and said look we're going to cross this river of jordan and i got a hold of you don't worry about to sing because i got you thank god we're in his hands is that right i haven't lost one and i want last one not one every one of joseph's bones coming out of egypt praise god i thank god for his grace on and the overflowing of his holy spirit amen oh my praise god inspiration is starting to strike me i was about just about to say something that is that that little thought alone that just passed by me the whole message so i just leave that i can pick up on it and expand another time praise the lord i want to say though before beginning to preach that um we would like to have you donate towards the ukraine and the people of the ukraine who are suffering we know there are wars all the time but we we certainly feel a an urge to do this you know when i say the people of ukraine we are not going to donate because we have brethren there we literally have a lot of churches there but outside of that we our hearts are open for everybody we don't care because we don't even know amongst the rest who is uh hiding up or who is still hidden waiting to be unveiled we don't know so we want to support them as much as we can let's do the little we can right and our little with somebody else's little and whatever it will come together right and i'm saying that not because uh brothers churches uh you know people sending me uh email and texas and then i'm getting it even from the government like donations centers stuff like that right but other than that we must pay attention to those things amen that doesn't mean we're gonna donate to every war every time we are we're going to be donating but i feel that we ought to do something here now all right so those of you would wish to do that and you're able to do it today fine if not during the week you can always send something to our treasurer uh here and it will be a blessing amen we'll put it together and we'll send it out the government has said they will match whatever so if uh if we give 10 million well bless god i'm correcting myself i'm not saying if you give 10 million but of course if the lord has blessed you quietly and you want to give that that's up to you but i'm just saying whatever we give the government has promised to match it right and to be a blessing to those people don't let the devil get you to become so callous that because you've seen war on tv war and tv killing on tv bombing on tv until there's no more of this it become a picture on the screen and it's not real anymore except for a video game you see he's desensitizing the people and they don't know he's doing that all the time but that's not my subject today but i thought i'd like to mention that before going in to the word praise the lord hallelujah now we're going to um look into the bible but before i give you that let me say this that we will be talking from revelation chapter 5. and uh brothers put this up on the screen because we're going to read the entire chapter revelation chapter 5 and we are going to pay um a little more attention to revelation chapter 5 verse 5 and 6. and i just want you to know before we start that 5 is really the number of grace and i believe in the mathematics of god's scriptures and in everything god does he is accurate and he has placed this opening of the doorway of grace right in chapter five and then verse five this is when the kinsmen redeemer steps forth five grace again and the last will be our rapture amen so this is not six six six but five five five and we're out of here by the grace of god blessed be his name look let us read god's precious word and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written with in and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth nor under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book needed to look there on and one of the elders said said unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david had prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders there stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of orders which are the prayers of the saints and this song and new song saying the word worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof and has redeemed and and i was slain and has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth and i beheld and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitted upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever and the four beasts said amen and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth forever and ever you might say they worship the eternal one him that liveth forever and ever may the lord bless us and bless his word praise the written word amen shall we pray father we thank you for the reading of the word we pray that the holy spirit will help us to express the word and may you bless us and in every possible way in jesus name amen and amen god bless you please be seated today i'm not apparently here to bring something that may sound deep to you but i like i said i just want to be here to give thanks to god amen i want to praise him and thank him because as i understand more of him and what he has done for us my heart reaches out to him to give him all the glory honor and praise now in this chapter the scene is set in heaven i let us read the whole chapter because i wanted everybody to have a a distinct um starting point in their hearts to be able to understand what is happening or what happened and the cry went out for somebody that can take the book the seven seals of the gods mystery of course we know the seven seals have the names of the redeemed they their their names known only to him which he said ah you got a name now on earth but i'll give you a new name right so uh you'll be restored back to that name which you always had it's just that we are not amnesiac condition right now we some of us are slowly coming out of it but uh god is bringing us back to the original of where we come from but he made it made it plain is no man on the earth no matter how holy or reverent he thinks he is that that that could have taken this book for no man was found no man was found so god himself had to become a man so that he could do the the work of redemption and we hear the cry go out who who can take this book and john said when i looked at one of the elders stepped forward you know and and touched me on the shoulder because i was weeping i was crying why because he knows the names of the redeemed of all ages was in that book and not that god made him see his own name and so he began to weep in the presence of god and while he was weeping there one of the elders touched him on the shoulder and said weep not john behold the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed i want to thank god that that lion of judah has prevailed i want to ask you who is that lion who is that lion praise god what's his name [Laughter] who is this root of david oh my david come from him because he was the root of david then later on physically he come out of david so he's called root and branch so here oh my who is this root of david who is this lion of the tribe of judah see when i look to see the person who was this lion of the tribe of judah when i looked to see this person who was the root of david i looked and all i saw was a lamb amen amen now we asked ourselves brother simon who is this lamb who is this lamb that stood there a lamb looked like it was bloody like it was slain as if it was in a battle as if it was a not just a regular lamb but a ram with two horns all the new testament and it being a battle amen and there to the land praise god hallelujah but this was no ordinary lamb it was a lamb that had seven horns seven horn seven perfection horns power saw person with perfect power amen we know that could only be god himself and he had seven eyes which we know seven again perfection eyes vision perfect vision god himself amen praise the lord and we ask who is this lamb praise god listen to a little old song here i am that speak to moses in a burning bush of fire i am the god of abraham the brighton morning star i am the rose of sharon of whence do you say that i came do you know my father can you tell his name oh who do you say that i am and whence do you say that i came do you know my father can you tell his name i am alpha and omega the beginning from the end i am the whole creation and jesus is his name what is the name of that lion jesus what is the name of that lamb jesus hallelujah so my subject today is really what what john was told by the elder he says the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed but when he looked he saw a lamb so it's the lamb that has prevailed by the grace of god so i'm thankful today that the lamb of god has prevailed against every work of the devil and has defeated him at every point wherever he raises headache amen thank god the lamb has prevailed to open the seven seals because remember he said the lion has prevailed but he says there's to the lamb and he took the book hallelujah from the hands of the one hallelujah why because he's the one that had died he is the one that paid the price so thank god the lamb prevailed to open the seven seals on the mount of temptation the word was tested as to its truthfulness its veracity and whether it could stand the test of time and every time the devil came to him he came back it is written every time he came to test the word it is written every triumph temp not the lord thy god amen oh my and again he rebuked the devil hallelujah by making that statement to him a lot of people don't even see little things like that that jesus is plainly telling you i am the lord god chap not the lord thy god hallelujah oh my i want to tell you if the devil lost in that battle that battle of temptation which every one of us have to go through if you say you're so holy you are not tempted i've never been tempted in my life well something's certainly wrong with you because the bible tells us he was tempted and he was tempted in everything that you think you're tempted by only that he didn't give him to sin he did not he was not defeated at no point the devil lost the battle hallelujah the lamb prevailed over him praise god and so you must now believe no matter what the devil taps you with no matter what he does no matter how he comes you will prevail over the works of the devil because the ladder has prevailed [Applause] [Music] hallelujah israel was under roman rule the roman uh the roman sandal was upon their necks telling them you're defeated you are under our control in every way hallelujah and i want you to know when jesus the word made flesh came to this earth that listen this is a war i'm talking about really because i use the word prevail and that is a word used when there's a great battle and one side overcome the other side so here it is i want you to see it's a long running battle i didn't want to go back to heaven and michael and the angels and the war and i would come down in the garden and right on down i'm just picking them up at this point where the devil is still warring and fighting against the word god jesus christ and now he comes and meets him there and in israel and he challenged him by always going and hiding and he operates behind the scenes like you see he is glamorized how jesus healed the sick how brother branham healed the sick how this prophet healed the sick he's made a glamorization out of it not the people don't realize that when that sick person was healed that was a war that just took place there between the spiritual forces of darkness of satan against jesus christ the word because every sickness brought before him is satan's attempt to see him fail and if he failed with one of those sicknesses discernments or or whatever came before him he'll say look see the word you can't trust the word you can't trust him you can't trust jesus more i'm trying to let you see this is not wasn't just a glamorized thing in the new testament when you're reading all those things all through the book of acts you think it's just funny it's nice the devil make it sound they're great man they you know they heal the sick they raise the dead and so it was a war and he brought the height behind the sickness and come to jesus lord my son is sick lord did not the people said this what do you think about it it was a constant war going on hiding behind all men or sickness all manner of blindness all venera deafness dumbness palsies strokes this has nothing to do with the people who needed the help but satan just imprisoned them and brought them to jesus as a challenge those sicknesses and those people and those demons that faced him were direct challenges of satan operating from the supernatural realm and he came against jesus the lord constantly trying to prove him that he is not true and you can't trust him whatsoever he even challenged jesus through a man that had legions of demons or praise god hallelujah and hid behind the man's depression and mental problems to try and say uh help him let me see you help him now let me see how you can get him uh oh this is not written in the bible but this is what actually let me see what you're gonna do here now since the world began nobody ever delivered let me see but jesus spoke the word cast out the devil from the man and proved that he was the supreme one amen hallelujah and we know that the lamb prevailed over the devil the devil is nothing but a loser [Applause] i said it for his disgrace and shame he's a loser and he's a liar and he will never be able to come against prevail the word against the word of the living god hallelujah oh my he even used jesus's best friend lazarus and use the little maiden you see those are things when you outwardly it will give you human sympathy because it's your friend it's a young girl yes but it was satan hiding behind that and challenging him with a spirit of death because he had tried every other trick in the book and the last enemy to be defeated was death so he brought death before him amen since the world began being seen nobody raised up from the dead like man raise up another man from the dead let me see what you're gonna do here but jesus just took up the challenge four days late deliberately to show him his lord of life and everything four days late amen and then when they're absolutely sure the devil can't play on nobody's mind and say he really wasn't dead because four days passed and he under the earth for four days and and then he just rolled back the stone amen oh my lazarus comfort hallelujah and it has as it has been said that soul that was traveling away in the eternities to go in the presence of god or the voice calling him back to himself praise god and he came right back to that body lord of god i don't know what kind of thing how he hopped out of there whatever because he was trapped right up like a mummy but thank god he said lose him and let him go [Applause] thank god that lamb has prevailed the devil is a loser hallelujah and while i'm speaking here i want you to know if you're sick if you're blind if you're deaf if you're dumb if you're crippled amen whether you're even the spirit of death hallelujah the lamb has prevailed and if you believe it you can be free right now for the glory of god and i'm not saying that because of me because the day is when these evangelists go out and and they do things like that because they want to become famous or they want people to look at them the great man or great woman or this that's gone when you recognize who is here amen whenever we come together to worship my friends you must be conscious of god you must have a real sense that there's another being inside of this building wherever you are there's another person here with us oh glory of god may the holy spirit of this world amen make his word live again and bring the realization closer to our hearts to re you see he is wanting you to know that he is not dead the devil has lied to you hallelujah but he is alive it's only that you can't see him but now and again he'll do visible things for you to know that he is behind the scenes and that he's alive that's why your sickness can leave you right now if you believe the word of god whatever it is it can grow from you if you believe the word of god [Music] hallelujah oh my thank god the lamb has prevailed the devil [Music] you know the devil he's not one that just stops and gives up because you defeat him a couple of times even jesus said that he said he goes around he circles around he's come back another way and he's going to attack you again you see he knew exactly what the devil was doing with him so he can easily tell you that the devil is going to come back so the devil come back now and he used natural depth that didn't work so he come in with spiritual death now all them s worst shimmers that he could find he start to throw them at jesus send them to him bring in spiritual death now let me see what you're going gonna do with spiritual death and the first one he confronted me the woman at the well oh my what you gonna do about that now how you gonna bring her out but you know the story how he sat by the well and deliberately waited you challenging me you think i'm going to run somewhere and hide and dive and slip slide and try to escape from this no i'm meeting it head-on how you got to meet your troubles that's how you got to meet your trials that's how you got to meet your temptations whatever you're facing now we do it with boldness and certainty because we know who is with us who is in us hallelujah amen and we know our real enemies not these natural things we see with our eyes filled with our emotions and body and stuff like that but we're fighting against spiritual power fighting against demons of of death and sickness and pain lies and everything else that's what we're fighting against and we ought to recognize what is going on in this day and hour bring before him the woman at the well and he turned around the whole battle and got the devil running in the opposite direction woman run back to the tongue oh my and you heard my message on that and as she run she threw off the bangle on her foot she threw off this she wiped the the rouge from her face she wiped off all the stuff in her mouth oh my why because she's changed transformed by the power of almighty god amen the lamb had prevailed over her life the love of god had prevailed over her life amen brought to him zacchaeus amen brought to him the rich young ruler successful businessman doing well making tons of money and everything else and that desire is upon them and he was able to say zacchaeus come down off of that high through europe amen the society might tell you that you're way up there but come down humble yourself amen hear the word of god for the day and for this hour praise god hallelujah and then the last thing he did was throw at him the teeth on the cross are you going to get out of this this man is condemned hallelujah and more than that he's condemned to die he himself tells you that he is guilty he said we know we are guilty but this just man so so in saying that he admits he was guilty he was a murderer he he he was a robber and everything else amen but the moment he turned and he said lord when you come to your kingdom remember me hallelujah that one word lord he's look a jew doesn't call nobody lord except god himself so somehow he got a slash of revelation oh my he said lord when you come into your kingdom remember me because what the kingdom was not of this world and he sees that his soul is going somewhere else and it wants that lord to be king over his soul over his life and to be right there he says today you'll be with me in paradise not after you pay indulgences not after you do 13 stations of the cross not after you go through all kinds of general flexions but today thou wilt be with me in paradise absent from the body present with the lord glory be to god that i am prevailed the blood of the bleeding lamb hallelujah prevailed over all the works of satan praise god hallelujah amen he's a loser how many knows that say it satan is a loser say he's a liar he's a chief and more than that he's nothing but a failure he's a failure and he'll continue to be a failure a creature trying to fight against his creator oh my i used to do sculpting carving and when i carved and sculpt something a man-like figure what is that thing going to do i can take it and break it and throw it away for a wish but that can't do anything to me so it's the same thing the devil who is nothing but a creature that was creature that was created to be good at the time lucifer and the bible says but his own heart turned him to evil oh my i tell you my friends he is losing a battle here he will never win you know because he can't get it in his head he thinks he's always smarter than god but he's always a loser so thinking that he still can win he went and tried to hide behind the systems the religious systems using the great teachers of the day what school you went to see it was a devil hiding behind the great rabbis and teachers of that day challenging jesus but hiding behind a religious guard and using that so in the public not in the spirit where they both know each other but in the public where the public are listening and watching when he's openly challenged jesus had to be the greater than solomon is here so that when he answer there's nothing to be said they challenge him they bring all kinds of coins to him as if they're innocent and they just want help i want to be healed i want to be held lord should we pay attacks to caesar you know and jesus just look at them and say whose emergency subscription on that coin say well well caesar he's about to render to caesar what is jesus in other words what do i have to do with that it's his so you give it back to him amen right but at the same time the devil knew he was putting out the truth there but my own with my image in it the concrete mind image in it it has to come back just like how that image kind of go back to caesar amen the lamb prevailed over him amen he used even the high priest and i think haifas and he used the legal system hiding behind pilot and try to condemn him using that to get him uh crucified thinking he's doing a great thing hallelujah but you know what paul said that that if the princes of this world knew they would not have crucified the lord of glory is that right but there when they thought that he was defeated that's when he overcome amen amen in the garden of gethsemane the devil came there with another well another warfare against him and there he was the disciples can't see in that realm so they let's think that he you know is just like he's just there praying uh praying quietly in the garden bible says he was in great anguish and he was there praying praise the lord oh my where we went where the garden is they have great big cathedrals around it it's nice beautiful but i can imagine i tried to take myself back when i was there to see when it was wild and when there was just trees and of course those some of those trees that were there is the original trees those things don't die like that and my brothers he was in anguish praying and praying to god the battle was raging because remember listen it's only when i'm going to this that i see that the holy spirit said this i want you to see what happened to him is what what daniel was going through when he prayed and he got to have an angel come and bring a message to him and he could not just answer like that he had to fight he had to be in prayer amen and he prayed and straightened the angel lord of god hallelujah and when he did glory to god all the powers of darkness all the powers of hell fighting against him in every possible way amen hallelujah but the devil didn't reckon with a fierce counter-attack from jesus he thought that he might give up at this point but no when it comes that you yourself don't die now just know yourself one day you don't have to raise nobody it's you yourself i'll challenge you now that you yourself won't die but he forgot jesus already said destroy this temple i'll raise the top in three days amen hallelujah and so he challenges him and so satan lose all the powers of hell against him that helped you see the whole human race and the devil is coming you know you know where he took the battle in the garden of gethsemane why why are you going to the garden of gethsemane because he knew that's where he got man to fall the first time in a garden so here he comes with his attack playing on the mind of playing on everything else every power he can use to play on him and attack him in the garden of gethsemane there where where he wants him to remember that's his whole your whole race fell right in the garden and you're gonna fall here again whatever amen but he battled against him and the bible says he sweated drops of blood amen look it's not ordinary that was not the ordinary battle of prayer that was the lord himself battling against the prince of darkness this was a great one of the greatest battles ever fought hallelujah but i want to say thank god the lamb prevailed oh praise god the lamb of god has revealed amen yes sir oh at calvary the lamb prevailed again because he said father into thy hands i commit my spirit it is finished the battle is over lord of god the lamb has revealed praise god forevermore lord of god hallelujah the devil said you think i'm done with you they're gonna put you in that grave let me see how you're gonna come out i'm telling you the devil is not one that just gives up like that he'll fight he'll fight till he's put into the pizza hell yeah amen he's gonna fight right to the end and my friends so in that great battle on the ground in jesus's ministry that went on according to peter when he preached to the spirits that were in prison amen my friends he went there preaching to the old testament saints patriarchs that were imprisoned by satan because the blood was not yet shed they were believing unto eternal life amen but now the lamb and the lion was on the scene praise god you know how he went down into hell and preached the word to them amen when is he look oh there's the one that that what was the wheel that i saw in the middle of the wheel amen danielle said oh my that's the stone that i saw that was you now to the mountain the next one said oh my goodness that's the light that i saw in the desert that was above israel oh praise god hallelujah abraham and all them saints begin to praise god then you turn to the devils and give you those keys grab the keys a death of hell and the grave and everything else took them out praise god hallelujah amen yes sir satan fought him with all those angels a darkness that he had on his side but thank god the lamb revealed over him i said thank god the land prevailed amen then in the words of this song as i was preparing this amen up from the grave he arose with a mighty triumph over his foes he remains the victor over the dark domains and he reigns forever he lives forever with his saints to reign he lives he lives christ jesus yesterday for he walks with me and he talks with me all along life's living way o thanks be to god listen matthew 27 and when jesus got cried with a loud voice he yielded up the ghost and behold the temple veil of the temple was ramped in twain from top to the bottom and the earth did quick and the rocks rent and the graves were opened and many of the bodies of the saints which slept arose hallelujah not one lazarus now all of them in the graveyard come out praise god hallelujah after his resurrection and they went into the holy city and appeared unto many and i say as a testimony that the lamb had today amen because we couldn't be out here walking around if the lamb didn't have victory over the devil if the lamb had not prevailed but we are the very proof and the evidence that the lamb has to be there glory be to god on high amen oh praise god amen i tell you i'm glad that he reigns even today i said he reigns over saints and because he has risen here's what he said in john 14 because i live you shall live also in other words the devil couldn't overcome me he can't overcome you the devil couldn't defeat me he can't defeat you because i live you shall live also you have the victory in the name of jesus christ the lamb prevails you're not talking about a dead lamb but the lamb that lives in you and me hallelujah that lamb lives in you and me the devil can't prevail against him dead and he can't do it now where is he that is in you then he that is in the world praise god hallelujah revelation 1 17 fear not john i am the first and the last listen to this i am he that liveth and was dead listen all other men you're going to read and metusa lived for a thousand years and he died you know read about the next one or he lived so many and he died and you read them and he died but this is one who say this is not that this is the opposite now i am heath and livid and was dead amen i was dead i was under the grip of the devil and everything else but here i am as proof that the lamb has prevailed because i live forevermore praise god for he lives forever lord by the grace of god hallelujah nothing could hold him none could put him in the grave and hold him there hallelujah and so his resurrection proves that the lamb has prevailed oh my i tell you friends it must be it's a great battle this is a great battle has been and is a great battle because for the great battle now over real estate over the souls of men of course praise god you understand what i'm talking about the man's heart is the no man's land so it's a battle for real estate it's a battle for the souls of men or uh in there amen and that battle rage from the streets of bethlehem right onto the hill of gaza battling every way that he was amen and until the battle came down to the end and the devils stripped him he had over 500 disciples known disciples there were many other secret ones but he had 500 known disciples uh and by the time he got to the end the devil stripped him away of all of them and he left with only 120. by that time you would say his ministry is a failure because instead of it growing growing growing growing it seemed to let it come down to just 120 amen hallelujah oh my by telling my friends he he had forgotten that jesus said i'm going away but when i go away i'll come again oh praise god you remember that general over there in germany when he was defeated by hitler's forces i think it's patton he said i am going away but i shall return oh and he did and defeated the powers of the german amen and took over that area for his for the glory for the glory of his nation amen hallelujah and the same jesus said that i'll go where i will return he returned on the dinner taking across to the power of the holy spirit amen and instead of one jesus the devil end up with 120 of them anointed with the same holy ghost for he broke himself up into pieces and put himself inside the spirit amen hallelujah and now hallelujah the devil tried to stomp off the fire and instead of that is scattered oh hallelujah he's end up with a forest fire a holy ghost and is keeping us alive moving in our hearts moving in our experience amen that's what he's facing now oh glory to god hallelujah amen hallelujah and since then the ministry of jesus christ has spread all around this world from that one individual whom garden dwelt and used is spread to 120 and now it's a blossoming flame across the face of the entire earth amen and it's still spreading you believe that it's still spreading amen he's still searching he's still seeking amen calling out for his own hallelujah and i want to thank god that i can praise god that i'm one that he found one that was lost that was found that was blind but now i can see and i can say with all the others that went before me the lamb has prevailed amen hallelujah oh praise god hallelujah i think there's a psalm i don't know it but some of you may know it it is finished the battle is over it's finished and jesus has won praise god hallelujah it's done the lord jesus has taken the glory and the praise i'm gonna shift now um from that point of view and come to this now you know what jesus said in matthew uh when he spoke of peter receiving the revelation flesh and blood hasn't revealed this unto you but my father in heaven has revealed this unto you and upon this revelation amen this rock of revelation amen i will build my church the church was built on the word of god which was given by inspiration and should be received by inspiration and revelation but now they're queasy and they're scared and they don't when they hear that word revelation no they want everything already calculated uh systematized and already worked out by wise men of the earth and document it before they can believe if it prophet had come in them all days and said thus said the lord no i don't believe that i got to see rabbi jones after show me that in the talmud first before i believe it no that's where the church world has drifted away from the original word you remember there was no written bible when abel believed god there was no written pages of a bible when abraham believed god noah believed god elijah believed god elisha believed god no there was nothing like that but the people's faith now has gone from the unseen invisible god the invisible spirit of god and their faith is now just upon the writing of these pages and it's true it's good and we should believe it but there is this powerful being behind the scenes trying to get people said that's good but it's not that it's me i'm behind all creation i'm behind everything that's going on turn your eyes upon jesus look full in this wonderful face and the things of earth will grow strangely there in the light of his glory and grace oh thanks be unto god who given us the victory through jesus christ and so he said upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against her the gates of hell shall not prevail against her so it's already prophesied that the gates of hell will not defeat god's church he already prophesied that gets ahead will come against the elect lady the gates of hell will come against the bride but let me give you an assurance oh they will not prepare against the bride of jesus christ [Applause] with all this lies despite the seven ages of warfare against the church fighting against every single messenger every one of them had a battle with the devil at their own level they had to battle him but every one of them defeated him and they established a portion of that building that he was building with his justification sanctification baptism holy ghost now the holy ghost himself is on the scene hallelujah i don't just want to be baptized with him i want him to possess me control me i have preeminence over me amen hallelujah i want to thank god that no matter all these seven church ages of blinding god's people call grinding them amen doing all the works of man and things of that nature all of that i want to thank god that all seven locks of samson has grown back all of the word that was lost during the dark ages of church history have been restored like a word of god and the power of the holy spirit and it's through that restoration that we are here today seeing what you're seeing and rejoicing in what we're rejoicing amen oh what a hour what a day what a time we're living in whoa very few can even see and recognize what i am talking about matter of fact i go into some churches and try to preach like this they'll kick you out yeah i was in detroit preaching there and the bishop was so mad he lost all his senses because instead of walking you know how they walk like a real real gentleman reverend like that he got so mad he was climbing across the views he forgot about the people and everybody he met to tear me limb from limb anyway i will tell you that story oh my praise god hallelujah oh my thank god that he sent an angel to us like he did to daniel to bring a message to us but that angel turned around and said daniel you think i got here easy i had to fight against the prince of persia before i could get here oh my and you must imagine that the angel to the church of this last day what a battle he had no we got to enter in and understand he didn't just come and bring out a chocolate message or some nice deliberation to us he paid a price he had to fight against the works of the devil the works of the flesh temptation sin everything else he had to fight and to overcome for the glory of god before he can deliver that message to us hallelujah amen and so this bride ultimate thankful that god sent a messenger that god sent an angel and the word has come true to us and now we can rise up in the name of jesus christ knowing that the word has come into our hearts amen the lamb has prevailed not that the lamb prevailed back then but the lamb has prevailed now in our day and in our time seven church ages the devil tried to overcome god's bride with all kinds of spiritual blindness i was spiritually blind i was in uh the assembly of god denomination and uh i spent years in there and spiritually blind but then when god began to open my eyes not from bible school not from bible teaching but from lots of prayer and and waiting in the presence of god read the scripture then he begins to show you look at this over here look at this over here then then i told you men are casting out of a devil and then the devil starts speaking in tongues and right away the holy spirit said see thomas is not the genuine evidence of the holy spirit it's an evidence but it's not the initial evidence so that is a false doctrine it's wrong and right then even though i was still in the nomination i recognize that so it doesn't matter who come to me speak in the dumps it didn't matter the spirit of god would still discern that thing and recognize exactly what it was praise the lord amen but the church had to go through a period of spiritual blindness not recognizing the word not recognizing who was really their god distracted by the devil clouds of darkness and the devil put on you times of depression you're in the church you're reading your bible you're praying and still you're mentally confused you'll get an oppression right in there because something in you is thirsting and longing but what they were giving you could not bring you to that place of satisfaction to recognize who you really are amen but thank god just as in the battle that he had down in under the earth in the pit of hell let me tell you hell is on earth now and the holy ghost has come down and there's another battle going on for the souls of men that are imprisoned not then now oh my the same one who preached back there to them spirits in prison is preaching the word again the ministry of the holy spirit continues by the word of god to set his people free oh lord god hallelujah amen imprison you in all kinds of denominational systems and as i've used the term prisons with stained glass windows got you in there it's so glamorous it's so wonderful you fail to realize you're in a prison like a nice race horse that's right there kept inside of the paddock and he's allowed to run around as long as he stays within the boundaries of our teaching as long as he stays within the boundaries of our paddle he is free yeah yeah you're free but only in that but you're not free to go wherever god's holy spirit will lead you oh my oh praise god my brother i tell you i thank god the devil use every possible thing even knock us over the head and let us go deeper into the spiritual amnesia amen you know praise god god bless you because look if he hits you so hard you might start seeing stars [Music] and if you see stars you might start to see some light once you start getting some light the whole thing may open up to you and when you see the book open to you the bible will become a new bible becomes a new bible when the book opens up to you and you begin to start seeing god amen i want to thank god he's brought me out to my depression he brought he has brought me and he is bringing me day by day out of my spiritual amnesia amen [Music] i'm reading the bible and i pass by a familiar place it brings me back to myself right when i read certain scripture oh my it's like i read this before how can i know this i never really read it naturally but spiritually it's like i knew this before how did i know that how did you know it you're coming out of your amnesia amen you know when people get amnesia they try to take them back to their old school room back to their old house make them meet some people that they used to know hoping that one day they will say oh oh i know you oh praise god hallelujah amen that's what happened that the word of god was preached in front of us oh praise god until one day we woke up oh it is jesus praise god hallelujah and the lamb prevailed over my soul and i'm his and he is mine amen thanks be to god hallelujah i'll tell you friends there was a time when i'm going to wind this up now when israel was on the occupation and the devil had his hands upon them the more bites and all those people were all around them and there came forth one by the name of goliath and goliath was threatening god's people behold the threatenings oh and he started to threaten god's people in every possible way there but thank god there was a little david and you know how david rose up against goliath and what did david have that goliath could laugh at him because he didn't have nothing all he had was uh a slim shot and some uh stones from inside of a brook hey man he pick up those revelations out of the waters of the world and uh five of them stones he got there and he grabbed one of them put it in a slingshot and whipped the slingshot right straight and it hit the devil right in his forehead it didn't hit him in his neck to stop him from talking it didn't hit him on his shoulder to stop him from using his weapon but it hit him right in the center of his forehead amen you realize that david a little boy couldn't throw that stone like that that far with that kind of force when david lose it god's hand took it hallelujah it was the hand of god he struck the devil because remember those philistines and those people where they wear a steel helmet that cover called a hogwarts or something like that it covered right over their forehead they know that people are going to go after that and it covered them and only this part of their faces out so it went and it punctured and pushed in that metal until it burst his brains when the word of god struck him and that was just a picture of a little rough-hewn church a little rough bride god look what the god the church will come back to primitive religion primitive faith primitive believing original believing in the word of god and come back to the foundations that she had amen and pick up this word of god and don't let the devil come after you we going after him praise god hallelujah that's what we're here for [Applause] that's what the apostles said the devil coming after us no the church of god grew and multiplied and they came after the devil with the vengeance the counter-attack praise god he forgot we we got a we got a general here that's the best general the world ever had when it looks like it's sunny he's sending you to trap you we're at the back of a river and the devil said ah we got them in the trap now now we're gonna be able to take them take them to pieces there but really he was leading them into a trap right they didn't know what the general was doing but suddenly the general so don't worry with them he said reach out your rod open up the waters and they walk through hey amen oh we got the same bible you got we're gonna read the same thing you got we're gonna walk over just like you and when we're trying the waters cover them up the waters cover them up thank god that all we have brother is a little slingshot is that right but let me tell you behind that slingshot is the mighty arm of god the arm of jehovah for the lion of the tribe of judah has become the lamb the lion that was a lion to the old testament and the new testament and the patriarchs and prophets has become the lamb under the for the gentile dispensation the lambs that they were killing was just pointing to him coming to call out the people from among the gentiles for his name amen praise god and it has come to pass and has come in the past in our day and i'm so glad that i can say i am one of them because he has prevailed amen over death helen the grave he's proved it by rising up the resurrection proves that the devil is a liar amen the devil is saying oh god is dead jesus is dead no he's not there he's left a natural body that you can see him but he's still here and he's saying i am alive i'm he that liveth and was dead that was a past tense something that he tried to pull but you know how you're going to kill life you understand life is life you can't death is death but you cannot kill life i am he that was living and was dead but now i am alive forevermore the lord of life amen the lord and the originator of all life says i live forevermore nothing can kill me nothing can destroy me the lamb has prevailed now let us all stand and read revelation 5 again with this background let us all read together this is not me reading but all of us reading it together as one before we leave this place let us together start and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the box neither to look there at all and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book needed to look there upon and one of the elders said unto me would not be all the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david had prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the troll and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the troll and when he had taken the book four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them hearts golden vials full of orders which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying the word worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou slain and has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and town and people and nations and has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth and i be hell and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the peace and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand ten thousand and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice worthy as the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which was in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i saying blessing and honor glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne unto the lamb forever and ever and the four be said amen and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever jesus the eternal one receiving worship of all the angels and of all the elders praise god and we are here today to worship him and glorify him once again it is not all over yet we're in the midst of this raging battle but thank god for us will soon be done with troubles and trials satan johnson will soon be done hallelujah victory is ours for the lamb has prevailed the lamb has revealed god bless you praise the name of the living god amen the blood prevails the blood of god your blood prevails just as in olden days the blood prevails the blood of the bleeding lamb thank god the blood prepared thank god the blood of that dying bloody bleeding lamb has prevailed god bless you all as you worship with him or so before we leave this place praise the lord hallelujah god bless you [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] redeem let the redeemed [Music] greater
