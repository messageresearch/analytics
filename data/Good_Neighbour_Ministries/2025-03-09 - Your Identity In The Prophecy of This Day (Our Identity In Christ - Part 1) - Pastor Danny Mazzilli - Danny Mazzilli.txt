an offering onto thee father take thy Glory and Honor we commit everything into your hands in Jesus name amen and amen all right see [Music] just before we sing this I read a something that jumped out of me out of the Psalms 107 it says they that go down to the Sea and ships that do business in Great Waters these see the works of the Lord and his wonders in the Deep for he commandeth and raises a stormy wind which Lift us up the waves thereof and they mount up to the heaven can you imagine being a ship and the wave is so big that it mounts up to heaven they go down again Into the Depths their soul is melted because of trouble they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are at their wit's end then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distresses and maketh the storm to come so that the waves thereof are still then are they glad because of they are are quiet so he bringeth them unto their desired Haven praise the Lord he can create the waves and he can steal the waves praise God someone say bless the Lord bless the Lord he's got it all in control I said he's got it all in control am my Bo of Life say on the troubled sea ever

know this week is the beginning of March break a lot of our young people are going to be on March break this week we pray that the Lord will watch over them bless them Prosper them we've got a activity uh set up for them at tanley Woods the church has provided uh some time for them to get together I believe on Saturday so parents please bring your children come yourselves fellow Fellowship one with the other amen take time to uh set aside this time of rest in this March break amen praise God also next Sun next Sunday we'll be having the Lord's supper and then you'll be getting upcoming announcements regarding our Easter services praise God but today we've come to Rejoice around the word of God amen amen amen and I'm excited about the word because it is God's provided way for us to receive strength to receive instruction to know better who we are make clear our identity in this day and in this hour and what it is that God is doing and where we fit into the whole program of the Lord amen am praise God and so today we're going to be looking at um we're we're still in in uh in the lines of what we've been ministering you know one thing you're going to come to realize and what I'm realizing is that you know the word just keeps expounding itself and you'll see that regardless of the topics that you take and the themes and and the titles that you take from the scriptures once your your your understanding has been opened to the word of God you've received the Holy Ghost for your day all you can see is Jesus Christ throughout the word and what you're going to be seeing more and more in this day is not just Jesus Christ but Christ and the church everything of the Old Testament was calling on the Messiah the coming of Christ the coming of the Lord Jesus but I want you to notice in the New Testament it's all about Christ to his church amen because Adam was restored Eve is now being restored the Church amen and so we're still um you know I can't get away from uh the thoughts that uh the Lord has just been placing on my heart and so we're going to be go to the next slide today we're going to be looking at um you know our identity in Christ but even more so go to the next slide you'll see that it's your identity your personal identity in the prophecy of this day amen amen amen praise God we know that we're in the midst of Prophecy don't we amen praise God well we need to recognize where we fit let's read our scripture and then you may be seated first scripture is from 1 Corinthians 13 veres 9 and 10 it says for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away amen amen God bless you you may be seated may the Lord add His blessings to the word of God Amen father we thank you for everything that you are about to unveil and make known more clearly there's nothing new that I can bring father it is only your inspiration and your spirit that can interpret the word of God to each and every one of us personally and that is our desire this morning Lord as we would Minister your word that that the spirit would would stand behind the word and move through the pews and into the hearts of the people oh God and make it real make it live make it an overcoming victory for each and every one of us Lord the present truth the word of God for this day and for this hour Grant it we pray in Jesus name amen praise God Saints we're living in the day uh when that which is perfect has come amen praise God we need to realize that that uh you know these scriptures they were spoken but this was like 2,000 years ago here Paul was speaking in in the in the book of Corinthians and he was saying that that when you know when that which is in part uh that which is perfect comes that which is in part will be done away and this is the hour where the word himself the fullness of the word that which is perfect has come unveiled the word of God to us in these last days to make the word come alive and real and identify you and me exactly where we fit in the word of God Amen praise God when Jesus Christ came to the Earth he was the word made flesh and yet only a handful of people could actually identify with him amen all those religious leaders of that day they were they were they were astounded by the things that he was saying making himself God imagine saying that I am the son of man he that is you know he he he spoke to the woman at the well he says she says only Messiah only only Messiah could do these things and he turns he says I am he it was a time where he was unveiling himself but it was only to those that he chose to unveil himself too amen and so the mighty Angel has come down open the mystery of Christ to us made the book a brand new book to us through the opening of The Seven Seals amen the word is now in its fullness revealed to the called out Church there's a people that have wreck recognized that the mighty Angel has come that the spirit of God is now anointing a people to recognize and to live this word and to identify in the prophecy as the church that's going in the Rapture amen amen praise God we need to know which scripture it is prophecy is being fulfilled all around us and if your eyes are open to see it you'll be able to recognize the players the actors the political landscape the kings of the earth Prime Ministers presidents there those are the kings of those Nations and they all represent those Nations but they they didn't just come into uh uh representation now all scripture is is prophecy the Old Testament spoke clearly of the things that would take place in the end time and how these kingdoms would rise and who the players would be and what part in the prophecy they would fulfill we looked at it last week when we were talking about Donald Trump and his position as the king of North America of of uh of of the United States of America he wants to make himself king of the world now by his by his statements and by you know USA we will make USA great again what's he trying to say he says we want to be the superpower of the world that's his decree to the world and and he wants to fulfill this and but he doesn't realize himself that he is fulfilling prophecy amen he's being used to bring certain kingdoms into their positions so that they can fulfill the word of God parts of of assisting Israel and how Israel is the center focal point of it all they fail to see all of of that but unto you it has been given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom you're blessed so where do you identify with the current day prophecy do you identify with second Timothy where it says people will be lovers of themselves proud boasters were they're going to be disobedient to parents lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God you see you need to you need to look at your own life and you need to see where your priorities are that's what we're going to be looking at here you know maybe over the next uh few weeks as the Lord would would lead I don't know how how long we're going to go with this but let's just pray and believe and see what it is that the Lord wants to reveal to to our hearts personally because that's what the word of God is for the foolishness of preaching so that we can know clearly Who We Are how we fit are we just churchgoers are we just you know are we about uh those that um you know about the day that don't know the day and the hour like it says in Mark chap 13:32 the Lord will come as a thief in the night it says are you still waiting for something to happen or have you recognized that he has already come and like a thief in the night he's pulled you out of the world amen pulled you by a revelation into the message of this day so that you can recognize Christ in the present stage of his ministry to see where prophecy is being fulfilled around your very life and how it is that prophecy is being spoken and lived through your life amen where do you see yourself Saints first Corinthians talks about that that uh in verse in chapter 15 it talks about that we will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye that's a prophecy amen but yet in second in in uh 1 Thessalonians chapter 4:1 16 it says that the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and we know that the shout is the message amen and the voice is the voice of the Archangel it's the voice of God it's the spirit of God amen glory to God with the Trump of God so that so that we could receive rapturing Faith so that we can receive perfect faith for for a Rapture amen and God is using a a natural Trump and God is using his his Trump which is his word which is a which is a call to the Sons and Daughters of God back to the word of God Amen are you looking at this event as something to come is it a future prophecy or is it something that you are identified with now amen that you've received the message you've heard the voice amen you've recognized the the the scripture that's being fulfilled around you Revelations have you recognized Malachi 4 verse 5 behold I send unto you that's personal unto you personal have you received received God's messenger of Malachi 4:5 in this day and has he turned your heart back to the word you see you can't miss that prophecy to miss that prophecy is to miss the message of the hour amen you can't you listen you can't get to the message of the hour without going through Mali 4:5 amen praise God but listen Malachi 45 was William Mary and Branham but it's not you worshiping him or making him the absolute it's recognizing the word that that came through the the instrument through the prophet amen amen the prophets were not God but they spoke as God Amen they spoke the word of God they represented the word of God Amen so the minute that we make a person other than than Jesus Christ other than Elohim other than God himself the absolute we are committing adultery amen you cannot make anything anything deity other than God himself amen and when deity operates in you it is God operating in you showing that you are a part of God amen amen praise God so have you recognized Malachi 4:5 have you realized that he's come to you personal to turn your heart right back to the scriptures right back to the word of God because to miss that you miss Revelations 10 1-7 amen which is the mighty Angel himself coming down to the Earthly Angel of the seven Church age messengers of which William Branham was the seventh angel Messenger to the leodan church age to the Pentecostal age have you recognized that he has come down to open the word of God to unveil the mysteries of the Seven Seals or are you looking at those seals as a future event but have you recognized that they have been unveiled that they have been open that the mystery of Christ has been unveiled and is being unveiled and this is everything to us amen the coming of the Lord amen praise God this is prophecy in progress Saints these are things and so when we look at Prophecy in the word of God and we go back to the very beginning it's important for us to recognize where it all started everything started in the mind of God but when it comes to you and me here on Earth it started right back in the Garden of Eden amen and so let's read our next scripture as we move along here and we look at prophecy and us being identified in the prophecy in Genesis 1:27 to 28 it says so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living creature that moveth upon the Earth amen that was a prophecy and Eve was the woman who the prophecy would be fulfilled through understand that when God created himself and made it in his own image Adam and Eve were in Adam it was one God expressed in the image of God and when God took the dust of the earth and created the body for Adam God says to him he says now multiply he goes on to say multiply and replenish the Earth amen it was it's always been listen whenever we talk about God and Jesus Christ we need to also see the plan of God Adam and Eve Christ and the church never see it any other way because this is the hour where this becomes completely unveiled made clear and that's why we can identify as the church that goes in the Rapture the wise virgin it's always been a woman a type of the church that the word would operate through that's why Eve her name was given Eve mother of all living because we're talking about the whole plan that that that we're fulfilling here on Earth let's stay let's stay clear on on the plan of God Amen Eve went ahead of the program by being deceived by the serpent let's look at the next slide here Adam's bride could not wait God had told Adam and Eve multiply and replenish the Earth it was an oncoming thing of promise when when you look at that oncoming thing of promise you know what that says it was a prophecy God was saying we're going to replenish the Earth and when you look at the word replenish I know a lot of people but you need to see what it's actually saying replenish means to replenish that there was something there before and now it's going to be replenished we know that there was previous civilizations we know that there was things that happened that are hundreds of thousands and millions of years but that has got nothing to do with who you and I are here today we can understand that we can know because God has given us the ability to be in the mind of God and to know what what what God is doing today that's what's important why would Jesus Christ have to come to the Earth and die and give up his own life two thou 4,000 years after this was said if it was so important everything that happened before the foundations of the world if that was all so important then then then we would need to know those things but we don't need to know those things but we do need to understand that God is Sovereign God is eternal God had no beginning and no end and so dinosaurs could have existed 250 million years ago it's irrelevant because in God there is no time time is relevant to us because we die because in these human I'm only talking about the human bodies now that's why Christ came so that we could have eternal life not just have eternal life but be given and taken back to our Eternal position in God Amen if you are a son or a daughter of God there's never been a time that you were not but you came into a spiritual body a spiritual Amnesia by coming into this body and now you've got to live out this whole Plan of Redemption but blessed are your eyes and blessed are your ears for unto you it has been given to know the Plan of Redemption and this is what we this is why we Rejoice amen so so we know that that there was these previous things but we're not interested in that I keep telling my friends you know they'll want to bring up oh you know the anunaki well the Bible talks about the the the children of anak they were giants but I want to remind you that the children of Israel went and walked around Jericho and that city fell along with all the Giants the children of Israel overcame them so where do they fit in the prophecy of this day those are the demons and the powers that constantly fight Us in that spiritual real we don't fight against flesh and blood but we fight against Powers principalities and dominions and the and the easiest way for Satan to get to you as a son or a daughter of God is to distract you from The Plan of Redemption and put you into theories and put you into this well this is a possibility well this could have happened and this could happen and they could still be here yeah they are still here in spirit form they're the demons that are trying to take our minds away from the word of God away from God's plan and God's purpose for us so that we can come into our rightful positions as Sons and Daughters of God for the Rapture we're not to be distracted Saints be careful of all of those new age movements and all of those teachings and and oh you need to understand this and understand that if Jesus Christ is not the focal point and Jesus Christ is not their lord and savior and if they don't recognize that God had a restoration to his word they don't realize the seven Church ages the seven Messengers through those Church ages the great Reformation Luther breaking away from the Catholic Church Wesley breaking away from Luther Pentecost breaking away from from Wesley uh and then and then Christ himself through the messenger of Malachi 4:5 Revelations 10 1-7 where he introduced Christ himself again amen amen amen so that Christ could come and identify himself the second coming of the lord they're all talking about it but they'll make him something different they'll say oh yes Jesus was this Jesus was a master Jesus reached the highest level of Consciousness Jesus Is God Amen and he is he has a Plan of Redemption and he has a people that he's come to call amen praise God those he said that are that are in the palms of his hand he says not one of them will be l lost that my sheep will hear my voice amen I believe there's sheep that are hearing his voice this morning praise God hallelujah and so we can see these things and we can see from this quote that this was a prophecy of things to come amen praise God let's look at the next slide he says here in uh in uh this is all from the spoken word is the Original Seed now Adam's bride could not wait but she went forward first that's the way today the bride today she wants to manufacture something now when we're talking about the bride we're talking about church we're talking about the woman anytime you hear woman in the Bible when it comes to the New Testament understand that it is talking about the church she's known as women amen and she wants to manufacture they want to come up with their own ideas their own teachings their own do amen glory to God she's got to work it up on the platform she's got to have something she's got to have everything see what is she doing manufacturing something but not the True Church the true church does not manufacture the word of God she interprets the word of God by the life that she receives by the Holy Ghost to man to to manifest Christ to manifest the word amen praise God and so here now in the next slide he says now when God give a commission which cannot perish listen what whatever God says something he said heavens and earth will pass away but not his word God's word is eternal it cannot fail when he said multiply and replenish the Earth that's what God's that was God's Eternal purpose he's still doing it he never changed the plan nothing Chang changed Saints this is being fulfilled and you're going to see how this prophecy is now being fulfilled in our day and how you identify in that prophecy to carry that out you cannot die because it's his word you can't you have to live thank you Lord God's listen he goes if that child had been brought forth right they'd have been there' have been no death but she couldn't wait you understand what he's saying there he's talking about when Eve was beguiled by the serpent went ahead of God and accepted the the the serpent seed amen instead of accepting and taking God at his word praise God hallelujah it's all about the Plan of Redemption had we come according to God's original plan which was by the spoken word in the same way that he did it in the Virgin Mary and that's what we're going to continue to look at then it would have been a perfect son every single time a perfect daughter of God every single time expressed in the image of God every single time attributes of God praise God forever more let's read on in Genesis 3:14 he says now and the Lord God said unto the serpent pay attention because thou Hast done this Thou Art cursed above all the cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel praise God listen don't tell me that the serpent was a snake and that it was an apple on the tree tree no no sir the serpent was an upright being that could speak that went to Eve was was beautiful because Satan is talked about as as as uh you know Lucifer the lightbearer he was he was beautiful he was he was smart a woman's seed well wait a minute here a woman doesn't have a seed a woman has an egg so what seed is he talking about Christ he's talking about the prophecy of the Christ Jesus the Messiah that would come through the church amen that would come through a virgin birth that would be nothing but the unadulterated word of God Amen people want to worship Mary they want to make her something else let's see what she actually represents in the scriptures amen amen and and the prophecy is very clear here there's going to always be enity between those two seeds and that's why when Cain and Abel came forth one was the seed of the serpent there was twins born and one was the seed of Adam amen one was an eternal seed one had a time because it came forth by the procreative power of God's word that every SE seed would bring forth of its own kind what nature was it that went into Cain remember the serpent had a beastly nature it did not have a human nature or the nature of God it had a beastly nature it's wild it cannot it all all that it was given was the ability to communicate by voice but its nature was a nature of a beast and it and and it's and it's clear here in the prophecy that there's no way that he's going to that that Beast is ever going to override Christ it'll bruise its heel but that ain't going to kill him it's going to bring to pass the Plan of Redemption amen praise God here we see the prophecy is clear about the woman that there would be enemity between her seed and the Serpent's Seed and what we've been ministering on over the last few Services we've been seeing that those those lineages and how we saw the natural the the the the the the seed that came through unbelief through Hagar and then the seed that came through a through a natural sex act through Sarah but yet it brought forth the nation of Israel which was the promised Nation but then it was the spiritual seed word of God that came to Mary by no sex it was God the blood of God the seed of God the word of God and unadulterated untouched of men that Mary brought forth Christ to restore Adam in his Perfection amen praise God and so here now we're we're just we're just continuing on that thought let's go to our next slide as we move along here Isaiah we're talking about prophecy here now back 800 years before the Virgin conceived this prophecy came through Isaiah therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel well what is Emmanuel God With Us his name was called Jesus Jehovah Savior Jesus Jehovah of the old test Testament is Jesus our savior of the New Testament amen praise God and so here now Isaiah was the prophet who caught the word of God in his day under the inspiration now listen Isaiah was a known Prophet you can go back and you can see how many prophecies go basically the whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation is in the book of Isaiah did you know that go back back and study it again you'll see prophecy after prophecy after prophecy and the people that knew Isaiah in his day they knew that the things that he said when he would say things they would come to pass things that he would say they would come to pass but a lot of the prophecy was for a future event on the coming of the Lord and I can imagine you know when when Isaiah made that prophecy on that day that a lot of the young virgins were like whoa is it could it be me and they were all preparing that potentially they could be that virgin that would conceive without having to be with man and that she would be that that one that that would be exalted like they do to Mary today because God chose her listen when Isaiah spoke that prophecy he saw the Virgin Mary 800 years down the road he saw her he saw exactly who it would be he saw her lineage he saw where she would come out of what Town what out of Nazareth she he knew exactly who this woman was because he's God his prophecy is clear in his mind all it is is that he needs to interpret it and bring it to pass he does that not you not me we manifest it when we believe it amen praise God and so here now let's read this uh next quote here brother Bram speaking here at a court trial and he's talking about Witnesses you know you've probably heard this message but he says all right let's call another witness right quick he says Isaiah the prophet let's ask him something why he said the Lord spoke to me one day in Prophecy I was a prophet everybody know that that that's what I said the Lord honored and they all believed me as a prophet and one day there comes something rash and it set a virgin shall conceive well now that was unusual and it's usually in that unusual thing that God works see it's too strange like Joseph he wanted to believe Mary but it was so unusual you see to it was too unusual so he said when I made that prophecy everybody believed me so every young girl got ready that was unmarried got ready to have a virgin born child day after day year after year passed on and then they begin to believe that I was a false prophet you know you've been talking about the coming of the Lord you've been talking about what God has done in this day you've been talking about the end time prophecy you've been talking about how this world is going to go into tribulation you've been talking about political uh positioning and and all of these players and you've been talking about what God has done but the people look at you year after year after a year and you're still here you've been talking about the Rapture but you're still here they're looking at you wondering when is all of this going to come but I know it was the same God that had always made these promises so I stayed right with it and it was some 800 years later before the baby come but a virgin did conceive his words come to pass and we can stand on that today Saints to know that God's word it does come to pass am amen there is nothing that God has said that he will not bring to pass and so let's just continue on here and let's look at the life of Mary let's see what we can draw out of it let's see where where where we identify in the prophecy in Luke chapter 1 verses uh 26-31 and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man who whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that are highly favored and the Lord is with thee blessed art thou amongst women Oh Glory to God Saints there's so much that we can draw from this and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou H has found favor with God Don't Fear Saints don't don't don't be worried about the things that the angel have has told you don't fear what the mighty angel of Revelations 10 1-7 what what the the the prophet of Malachi 4 verse5 Has Told You Be not Afraid for for behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son and shall call his name Jesus glory to God imagine what was going through Mary's mind at that moment hallelujah praise God but here let's read the next quote it says as Adam found his wife pregnated with the seed of death of Satan's lie she had accepted Joseph found his wife pregnated with the seed of God which the word she had had accepted praise God forever more listen Adam found his wife pregnated by by a by a by a serpent seed amen but here now God uh impregnates a a bride a a virgin with the pure word of God somebody that had not come into contact with any kind of religion she might have had some upbringing and teachings on the word of God and the and and her priest her Pharisee you know would would have it it it ex it expounded it it it blew their minds when they found out that she was with child why couldn't they recognize the prophecy of Isaiah why were they blinded to that very prophecy to where they would call her that that that she said that she was a prostitute that she was with child before she had been married why couldn't they see it because of the enity that was placed in Eve and come down through that lineage that is there for one purpose to turn the people away from believing the pure word of God and we deal with it today the same things if you talk to a a hundred priests out there they will tell you about what happened in the Garden of Eden was Eve ate an apple and it brought about the sin of the world they have no idea about the lineage about the mystery of iniquity the serpent seed and how that lineage runs from Genesis all the way down through Revelation light and darkness amen but listen she found favor in God Amen and when we look at the word you know if you look at the Greek and you look up favor it says make accepted to make graceful charming lovely agreeable to pursue with Grace compass with favor to honor with blessing Grace God's grace because when God spoke that prophecy through Isaiah he needed a woman praise God and when God saw the prophecy that he would have a bride in the end time without spot or wrinkle he saw you and he saw me only by his favor and by his Grace and also of course by his forn knowledge because he knew that you would say yes amen glory to God hallelujah when you look at the word find it says to come unto to meet with after searching to find a thing that was sought without previous search to fall in with those who come or return back to a place while you are a son or a daughter of God if God found you it's not because he found you by accident it's because you always were a son or a daughter of God and now he's bringing you back to your place and now you're identifying yourself with the prophecy of the hour and realizing that you are that church amen you are identified with the rapturing church those that will recognize the Trump of God the voice of God the the the mighty angel of God Amen praise God that has come down to gather his elect praise God to return back to a place means you had to be there and by forign knowledge he predestinated you like it says in First Peter for his purpose and by his election and by his predestination Ephesians 1:1 Mary says how can this be listen to her response when when when the angel said said that this was going to happen you see she started to think well wait a minute well what do I got to do I got to like you mean you mean like how's this possible that that that like there's there must be something that I need to do the angel said there was nothing that she needed to do he said you found favor there's nothing that you need to try and put on there's nothing that you need to try and be a church goore and try to be better and try to live the the word of God better than anybody else once the word gets inside of you this is the time where Christ himself takes control the angel of the Lord said there's nothing you found favor Mary he says you just found favor there was going to be no human faculty no thinking that she would have to do something but notice what the angel says the Holy Ghost shall come upon you Hallelujah glory to God have you received the Holy Ghost for this hour have you receive the Angel's message of this hour which is the evidence of the Holy Ghost in your life because if you have there's nothing more that you need to do but Surrender Your Vessel unto the Lord and do like Mary when she said be it unto me according to thy Worden glory to God Amen the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee you have nothing to do but believe and she says be it unto me it was time for God to reveal the prophecy of the Virgin that was made not just 800 years ago but the one that was made back in Genesis chapter 3 that I will put enmity between your seed and her seed her seed need to come to the Earth the word needed to be restored and God had to find not some woman that could be artificially or or could be inseminated by another man because God wanted the plan that he had from the beginning when he said replenish multiply he meant speak the word all he had to do was speak the word eve bring forth brother Desmond Hallelujah bring forth Sister Sarah bring forth brother Derek bring them forth in the name of the Lord and they would have been they would have come into manifestation by just a dimensional change and saying hallelujah what's the plan and what are we doing I know the Lord said that we're coming down because God was God had a plan but this plan unveiled in a different way it had to be a Plan of Redemption so that we could come into our position so that we could find our place so that we could be a part of this great plan that we're rejoicing around today amen glory to God Jesus Christ Adam was the Old Testament while the Bride of Jesus Christ is is she she's all about the New Testament amen praise God you can't have the old without the new because the old is the new concealing the old and the old is the new concealing the new Hallelujah it was always Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it'll always be him amen praise God it was time for the prophecy to be fulfilled the anointed word which was Jesus who was the prophecy of the seed that would come through the woman Mary amen praise God I just want to read a little quote here uh may I add to this woman Grace Mary may I place her in the Bible also is called the elect lady brother Brandon from the invisible Union of the bride of Christ this misg Grace I'm going to talk about know the Bible declares said to the elect lady that if you notice elect come from the word elected lady if you go back and search it that he says our lady amongst all other ladies was elected like the Virgin was to bring forth the body of God on the earth she was an elected woman God chose Mary and also God has chose an elected lady which is his bride in this hour remember everything is in type form if you can't see Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever from Genesis all the way through Revelation go back and read it again by the open word that's been revealed to you now by the Holy Ghost you can't miss it you'll see it everywhere you'll see Joseph in his type Joseph a perfect type of Jesus Christ when he when he when he was sold for for so many pieces of silver like Christ was sold for so many pieces of silver thrown into a pit just like Christ when he went to to to Calvary and then he was risen by the by the god of that time the the the the the the god of Egypt uh and and put right next to uh to to the throne of pharaoh just like Christ sat at the right hand of God Jesus Christ had a gentile bride he's got a gentile bride just like Joseph he had a gentile bride amen and when Jesus when God when when Joseph went to reveal himself to his sons and and to his brothers he put his wife in The Palace a type of the church the Gentile Bride In The Rapture and Jesus goes Joseph goes to unveil himself to the 144,000 the 12 tribes of Israel you can't you can't miss Christ all the way through the Bible he's there I'm just giving you a quick example of Joseph as a perfect type amen it was all prophecy it was all prophecy in their lives being fulfilled they had to come into the identification of their position like Joseph he had to realize what God was doing and realized it when he said God has done all of this for good amen so that he could save the world so that he could save his bride and he could save the 144,000 the elect of Israel amen praise God forever more amen glory to God let's continue reading here in Luke chapter 1 verses 32- 38 he shall be great this is just continuation and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be see and I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee and I say the same thing to you the Holy Ghost needs to come over thee you need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen and if there's an elected attribute seed of God in there and when the spirit of God comes on that seed it'll awaken back to its original position as a son or a daughter of God Amen praise God and it'll guide you the Holy Ghost it'll what guide you into all truth the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the high shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which be born of thee shall be called The Son of God God now was coming to restore Adam in his fullness amen and there was only one way that it could be done it had to come through Mary it had to come through the original plan of God otherwise every single man regardless every single man that would come as a result of sex would be born in sin shaped in iniquity would be speaking lies it would it would not reverse the original curse that took place back in the Garden of Eden man man has got a beastly nature on him whether you know it or not that's why you get this this desire this lust uh you know passion for for for the things of the world because you're you're of human nature there's a character on you that came as a result of the beastly nature that came through the the serpent seed because that seed got injected into all of humanity doesn't matter if you're born of of blood that resulted from back from the Garden of Eden through through a a sex act then you're born in you're shaped in iniquity Jesus had to reverse the curse in order to bring Eve on the scene because Eve was in him and he wanted to fulfill the whole Plan of Redemption amen praise God and so God himself had to come a son listen he goes on he says and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called Barren for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the hand made of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word she believed the word amen we cannot overemphasize why we we so emphasize the word we tell somebody we say listen I see you rejoicing as a Christian but you can ask him this question have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed because I can see outwardly that you go to church you name the name of Jesus you worship Him you go to Sunday school your children go to Sunday school but my question is this have you received the Holy Ghost just like Acts 19 when Paul come across those disciples they were rejoicing Around Jesus Christ he asked them what do you what you know I see that you're rejoicing what's going on here oh we're rejoicing over the baptism of of John the Baptist he says but if you receive the Holy Ghost since then because Jesus said he baptized you with water but I'm going to baptize you with fire which is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is the is Christ himself in your day amen when Jesus came to the Earth he was he was in flesh God in flesh the Holy Ghost is in spirit but even in the flesh when he stood before all those religious leaders of that day they couldn't recognize that he was the Messiah that he was Christ and they rejected him and they'll do the same thing today when the Holy Ghost is in you and you will go to them and you will speak about the word of God and the message of this hour and what God has done let's read on here says and the angel departed from her amen glory to God and Mary said behold the handmaid of the Lord beat unto me Accord and the angel departed from her now let's go on Amen what can we draw from this well the Lord sends a sends a messenger to the Virgin and says she's highly favored says the Lord is with her she is blessed among other women types of all the churches yet she's astounded by what she heard the angel tells her she's found favor and so forth tells Mary that she is not alone in this Supernatural calling glory to God aren't you glad I was glad when I went into Gabriel fet's uh uh you know uh furniture store there and and and the Holy Spirit uh awoke me because then I realized when when I came to realize what had taken place and I come into that little white church on Winona there praise God I I I I was I was mesmerized that there was other people that actually believed this word glory to God because it was unusual it was very unusual it happened in a very unusual way all my family thought what in the world is going on with you glory I said praise God the Holy Ghost has come upon me [Music] what do you mean Holy Ghost what what what Holy Ghost I can't explain it but I'm reading the word of God and I can see it as clear as day that there's a great deception in the land and the people are worshiping things that they know not what they worship oh yes in vain they're worshiping the Lord but here when your eyes are open to recognize the word you come to realize that there's others God didn't make it just you no Hallelujah tells her tells her that listen your cousin is going to accept this word because I've done a miracle in her life too amen praise God let's move along here how do we know that she recognized she was a part of the prophecy how did she how did she understand that she was a part of the prophecy amen praise God glory to God let's read on uh next uh scripture here we we we move on here from 39 to 45 let's read it and Mary arose in those days and went into the Hill Country with haste glory to God let me tell you when the when the fire of God gets under you and you've received something that's real in your life you can't wait to tell people hallelujah doesn't matter how strange it looked I had friends down at the market that man I go down south with them we'd party together drink together gamble together do all kinds of things and the very next month after the Holy Spirit had taken a hold they're looking and they're going what what's what what's going on here they couldn't understand but I was zealous I wanted to tell them the holy ghost is real I would say I would tell them God is real you know you know the god that that that everybody talks about and you know all these religions and all these yeah yeah yeah they're talking about all the time it's on TV Danny come on it's everywhere this and that yeah no no but he's real he delivered me from a cocaine addiction that I was that I was under bondage for 13 years I was just like that blind man that his eyes were open don't you tell that blind man that his eyes aren't open don't you tell me what what what's taking place in me I I can't understand it but it's gone the addiction is gone he's opened my eyes I don't care what your priest says I don't care what your your pastor says I can tell you that that he is a living God and he's still a miracle working God and he and he's got a word it's not only the miracle but now the word has become a reality Hallelujah that's what really listen the Miracles is to just draw the attention Jesus did many miracles but it was to the word they he wanted them to recognize who he was he would get frustrated with his disciples they'd come to him and say Lord you know gee we you know we see that you're the the the the Messiah uh can I sit on your right hand John and J can I sit on your left hand can can we be and he look he says oh my gosh what's the matter do you guys realize what's what's going on here you see you got to recognize your day and its message amen it brings you and it grounds you into a reality of God being a reality so she hasted into the city of Judah and entered into the house of Zacharias and saluted Elizabeth and it came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary the baby leaped in her womb glory to God hallelujah listen when you tell somebody about this message if there is a seed germ of God an attribute of God in that individual and they hear this message something is going to change in them don't you worry you won't have to do anything they're going to just realize something has just come to life in me and so here now the moment that she heard the salutation she heard the testimony the word it came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation the baby leaped in her womb and spake out with a loud voice and said and and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb she understood and she believed Mary's testimony amen glory to God Amen because she was a part of that testimony she was a part of that prophecy she was going to bring forth John the Baptist amen who would be the one that would introduce the Messiah to the world 30 years later praise God Amen but here the prophecy is now in progress we've been listen I've been in this message now for I'm in my 31st year I was sitting back yesterday while I was here studying and praying and I was just thinking about everything and the Lord brought it all he just flashed my whole life before me again he says you know it's been 30 years that you've been serving me and now you're in your your 31st year I said yes Lord he says you know that Jesus Christ came into his public Ministry after 30 years listen God will show you types God will show you how he's in your life he does that not to exalt me I'm not telling you this listen I've had some Supernatural experiences trust me when I tell you I've seen the pillar of fire I've been in his presence I know what the things that have happened that's why I can be as zealous as I am amen but praise God he started bringing all these things and and all these thoughts start coming in my mind and here now we are in our public Ministry Jesus comes to Mary at at at at a time and 30 years later Jesus goes and starts into his public Ministry Hallelujah what's going on Saints prophecy God wants us to identify with the prophecy these planetary alignments and these all these things that are going to happen next Friday there's going to be a red there's going to be a blue moon it's going to be a a dark red moon it's something that only happens uh very very uh uh periodically doesn't happen hundreds of years whatever it is I can't remember the last one but but it's significant because we know that God's Bible the first one was written in the heavens and so we need to be able to identify the prophecies identify the things that are happening around us and then identify ourselves in the prophecy Hallelujah glory to God God doesn't do anything by accident here he is he says he goes blessed are thou amongst women blessed is the fruit of thy womb and then she goes on and whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me now don't get messed up when she says mother of my Lord okay mother just means carrier amen carrier she was the carrier of the seed amen okay amen she was the carrier of the seed which was the the Bible says that that we are that we are saved by the blood of God Amen it's not through the blood of any man Joseph had nothing to do with it Mary egg had nothing to do with it it was pure word Gene attribute that was placed inside of Mary's womb amen and so but she recognizes the supernatural element Elizabeth she's she's she's realizing here and and and she's going how can this be for low as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears the baby leaped in my womb for joy and blessed is she that believed she's saying glory to God Mary I am so grateful to know that you believe this word amen because it's it's going to bring to pass look at and blessed is she that believe for there shall be performed of those things which were told her from the Lord when he said he's going to be the the Messiah he's going to be the god he's going to be the the the the the true one he shall be Emmanuel God the word made flesh it will bring about the plan glory to God she was excited when she heard what had been said blessed is she she believed amen glory to God listen he says here in Mary's belief uh brother brandham in 1960 says it made it listen it made this little baby come to life in the wombs of its mother and in the womb of the mother and leap for joy and the Bible said that John was born from his mother's womb full of the Holy Ghost not only that by but while he was in the womb the Holy Ghost upon him his own mother received the Holy Ghost and prophesied saying and gave prophecy concerning him and concerning the Lord Jesus hallelujah praise God listen when when somebody comes to you and shares this message and you receive it it's going to transform your life and all of a sudden you're going to become a conduit for the word you're going to you're going to be you're going to believe all that the prophet said because the Holy Ghost upon you is going to discern the word of God for this day and for for this hour amen praise God the moment Mary spoke to Elizabeth that attribute came and leaped for Joy she was also in the prophecy M Mary was in the prophecy and so was Elizabeth in the prophecy and they both came to realize that they were a part of the prophecy of the day amen she knew she was able to bring forth her part in the word and Elizabeth could see that it was Revelation glory to God you know that there was a prophecy in Isaiah chapter 40 that talked about John the Baptist the voice of him that crith in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord amen make straight in the desert a highway for our God amen glory to God but listen I want you to notice here now we're going to look at the other side of the coin here because the angel first appeared to Zachariah if we go back now to the next slide here notice here in Luke chapter 1 we're going to go back now to verse 11-6 and there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense now Zachariah was a priest and he'd been praying that the Lord would give him a son amen would give him a child and and now the angel of the Lord comes and appears to him and when the and Zachariah saw him he he was troubled and fear fell upon him but the angel said unto him fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name John you see God gave him a a a revelation was coming to unveil the plan and make him a part of the prophecy but he couldn't quite see it and then and thou shalt have joy and glad and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be a great he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of Israel shall be turned to the Lord their god listen when Zacharias heard this he didn't believe it he couldn't believe it and you know what ended up happening to him read on he says and he shall go before him in the spirit and the power of Elijah Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord glory to God and Zachariah said unto the angel whereby shall I know this he's questioning how how you know in other words how's this possible and how am I going to know that you're actually going to do this imagine the angel appears to him and Zachariah said unto the angel where for I am an old man and my wife well stricken in years and the angel answering said unto him I am Gabriel I am the Messenger of the Lord amen listen until you come to a place where you've got a supernatural experience with the angel of God God where with the spirit of God unveils himself and makes himself real to you you will you will fall in doubt you will you you you'll be questioning this questioning that you'll be looking for an interpretation on this trying to make something come about by your own means amen he said I am Gabriel that stand in the presence of God and have sent to speak unto thee and to show these that show thee these Glad Tidings and behold th th shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season I'll tell you something Saints you're going to talk to people and they are not going to believe and I'll tell you they will just get Dumber they will not they they'll they'll get further and further away from God they'll reject the word word it'll take until it actually comes to pass and then it'll be too late at that time it'll be too late for them to recognize what God has done it'll be too late it'll be because remember Mary represented the wise virgin and Jesus gave a parable of the wise and the foolish virgin the wise virgin she's got the Holy Ghost she's got oil in her lamp amen the the the foolish virgin they're they're going to come to a place where they're going to look and they're going to see wait a minute here you know Danny John Mike Tim Phillip the they've been talking about all these these prophecies that would take place all these things that would happen in the political uh landscape how the world would just go further into turmoil further into confusion how there would be corruption to the levels of government like they've never seen we we said it because we saw thought back in the Old Testament and history was just repeating itself remember the Old Testament is is a concealed version of the New Testament revealed amen all the things all the unbelief all the the the the mystery of iniquity they thought that the big church that the Catholic Church would be the greatest Church on Earth but in there lies the greatest deception I'm not talking about the people the people that recognize they're going to come out of her my people they will come out of that deception they won't bow down to a worship of Mary this is the real understanding of Mary if you want to know what Mary represented you need to listen to this message you need to pay attention go back and read the scriptures and see how Mary represented she's a sister she's a daughter of God Amen she was a vessel she was used as a vessel because the Holy Ghost Came Upon her to bring forth the Son of God and Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost has come upon you in these last days amen hallelujah to bring forth the Son of God again into perfect manifestation through a a bride Ministry that believes the word of God that says be it unto me according to Thy word she will not bow down to man's tradition man's teachings man's man's injection of himself try to make himself something praise God the way up with God is go down get humble before the Lord humble yourself before his presence he's still the Living God that can open the eyes and shut the eyes when he wants to amen amen glory to God hallelujah and he says and he he he says that uh he's going to do his part in his season God is going to bring about these things now let's let's go to the next slide here we're going to close here in a minute now this little virgin was all excited notice here's what I I like about Mary amen instead of doubting like Zacharias that preacher she said behold the hands made of the Lord be it unto me according to your word she didn't try to figure it out all like like he did why he said now look my wife's old and so forth like this we have plenty of examples look at Hagar at the temple look at Sarah many of the old women had many children by God's blessings upon them and he had plenty of examples but he had she she had to believe something that had never happened glory to God Amen and I'm telling you that we are living in a day let the musicians come we are living in a day where something is going to happen that has never happened Hallelujah glory to God amen there's going to be a church that in the moment and in the the twinkling of an eye she's going to be changed in a moment and this Mortal shall put on immortality glory to God in the moment in the twinkling of an eye this Mortal shall be changed and we which are alive and remain are going to not hinder those that are asleep because those that are dead in Christ that died under the revelation of Jesus Christ in their day you can go back into the old you listen you can go back over the last seven Church ages all the way back to the day of Pentecost and you will see that down through all those ages God had representation in the prophecy he had those that were identified in each and one of those ages and they had to bring forth the portion of the word that they represented some were anointed to be to be cut into pieces some were were anointed to be burned at the stake some were anointed to deal with with W with what the the the Dark Ages would produce women having their children cut right out of their bodies in front of their husbands had to endure those things but God gave them an anointing God placed on them the ability to overcome the age that they had to face how by the Holy Ghost amen and how are you going to overcome this age of of intellectual understanding where there's putting so many interpretations on God's word that how you going to know what's the truth there's only one way that you will know the truth Jesus Christ said I am the way the truth and the life and I will give you the comforter which is the Holy Ghost and he will guide you into all truth so that when you read about Mary you can understand her position you can see her part in the prophecy and then you can see where you fit in and how you
