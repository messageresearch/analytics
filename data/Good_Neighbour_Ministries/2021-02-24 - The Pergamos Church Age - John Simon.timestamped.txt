[0:45] now our study today
[0:49] is the church age of
[0:53] pergamos pergamos
[0:56] church age we have gone through
[1:00] the ephesian church age
[1:03] and the church age of smyrna and
[1:06] now here we are at the
[1:10] church age of pergamos
[1:13] i will read our scripture reading
[1:16] now
[1:21] revelation chapter 2
[1:24] verse 12 on
[1:27] to verse 17 and
[1:31] to the angel of the church in pergamus
[1:35] write these things saith he
[1:39] which had the sharp sword with
[1:42] two edges i know thy works
[1:46] and where thou dwelles even where
[1:50] satan's seat is and thou
[1:54] hold as fast my name
[1:57] and has not denied my faith
[2:01] even in those days
[2:05] wherein antipas was my faithful martyr
[2:10] who was slain among you where satan's
[2:14] seat dwell dwelleth
[2:17] but i have a few things against thee
[2:21] because thou has there them that
[2:24] hold the doctrine of balaam
[2:28] who taught balak to cast
[2:31] a stumbling block before the children of
[2:35] israel
[2:37] to eat things sacrificed onto idols
[2:43] and to commit fornication
[2:47] so as thou also them
[2:50] that hold the doctrine of the
[2:54] nicoletians
[2:56] which thing i hate
[3:00] repent or else i will
[3:03] come unto thee quickly and
[3:06] i will fight against them with this
[3:10] sword of my mouth he that had
[3:14] an ear to hear let him hear
[3:18] what the spirit said unto
[3:22] the churches to him
[3:25] that overcome it will i
[3:29] give to eat of the hidden manner
[3:32] and will give him a white stone
[3:36] and in the stone a new
[3:39] name written which no
[3:42] man know it saving he
[3:46] that receiveth it
[3:50] god's blessings upon his marvelous
[3:53] and wonderful word our gracious father
[3:58] we ask your divine blessing
[4:01] upon all those presently
[4:05] listening watching the
[4:08] declaration of the word of truth
[4:12] may the great holy spirit who hovered
[4:16] over the waters of the
[4:17] deep in the in the very beginning of all
[4:20] things
[4:22] may he move across the
[4:25] deep waters of the human heart
[4:29] may thy spirit unveil the word
[4:33] giving us divine understanding
[4:37] and wisdom true revelation
[4:40] by the great holy spirit this we ask in
[4:44] jesus name
[4:46] amen and amen
[4:51] praise the lord praise the lord
[4:55] praise the lord it's good to be here
[4:58] once again
[4:59] in this study of the perdamos
[5:03] church age our topic today of course
[5:08] will be
[5:10] martin god's messenger
[5:14] martin god's messenger
[5:18] now as you know in all the other church
[5:21] ages
[5:22] god had messengers from revelation 1
[5:26] we understand jesus was seen with the
[5:29] seven stars
[5:30] within his hands and walking around the
[5:34] golden candlesticks
[5:36] now those seven stars represent
[5:40] his seven messengers
[5:44] men in the bible called angels
[5:48] angels meaning messengers
[5:51] but these were not heavenly angels but
[5:54] earthly ones
[5:56] sent by the lord jesus christ here upon
[6:00] the earth
[6:01] to bear testimony of his name
[6:05] in every church age
[6:10] upon true time on the face of the earth
[6:14] the seven candlesticks represent the
[6:16] churches that he's walking
[6:18] among his churches and he's looking at
[6:20] them and observing everything they're
[6:23] doing and protecting
[6:24] them meanwhile within
[6:27] the church ages he has those seven
[6:31] messengers we indicated that the apostle
[6:35] paul
[6:36] was the first identified
[6:40] church age messenger even though
[6:44] that that paul was
[6:47] converted after peter and james and
[6:51] many of the other apostles yet god
[6:54] chose him as the book of acts will tell
[6:57] you
[6:58] i have called him to be a light to the
[7:01] gentiles
[7:03] hallelujah and god used paul
[7:06] to bring the light of the word to the
[7:08] gentiles
[7:10] amen and so here it was god used paul
[7:14] and paul being the first messenger
[7:18] his life ministry
[7:21] and ministry and his teachings
[7:25] were all a blueprint or a pattern
[7:30] for for us to be able to recognize
[7:34] the rest of the messengers
[7:37] as they will come through down through
[7:40] the
[7:41] tunnel of time we will see the same
[7:45] characteristics
[7:47] the same approach and attitude to the
[7:50] word of god
[7:51] the same desires tastes and dictates of
[7:55] their mind
[7:56] as we look into the word and so we came
[8:00] through ephesus
[8:02] smyrna and now we are in
[8:05] this great age of pergamus
[8:09] now just to give you some background
[8:11] before we begin to
[8:12] talk about martin himself
[8:16] of course the catholics called him saint
[8:18] martin
[8:20] but according to history he is brother
[8:22] martin
[8:23] we you can call him either one whichever
[8:26] you wish
[8:27] but he was the one identified as the
[8:31] messenger
[8:32] for this pergamos church age
[8:35] now uh pergamum the greek word for
[8:41] pergamos we say pergamos
[8:45] in english was basically in the district
[8:49] of maisea
[8:50] uh of uh asia minor
[8:54] it was watered by three rivers
[8:58] and was one of the greatest and most
[9:00] illustrious cities
[9:02] of asia
[9:05] it was a very a city that was a
[9:08] center of culture you know this
[9:12] high-class dignified culture
[9:15] was in this city and a city that had
[9:20] great libraries especially
[9:23] one great library that was second to
[9:25] none
[9:26] after alexandria
[9:29] they had irrigate irrigated groves
[9:34] and public walks
[9:37] parkways parks where
[9:41] people could walk and talk and relax
[9:44] and let off their stress
[9:49] a city given to great shows
[9:52] and entertainments parties
[9:56] it was truly a great
[10:00] city of sin
[10:04] and their sin was great because
[10:07] of the religious worship
[10:12] that was in the city
[10:16] it was given over the licentiousness
[10:20] sexual sin everywhere
[10:24] and that sexual sin was mixed
[10:28] into the worship for the worship was
[10:32] mixed and intermingled with sexual sin
[10:37] and their god
[10:44] yes which
[10:48] my friend was nothing but a large snake
[10:54] and this large snake was housed in the
[10:58] temple
[11:00] and there that snake
[11:03] was fed it was
[11:07] worshipped as a god within the temple
[11:11] this great big snake was
[11:14] in there fed house and worshiped
[11:19] as their god
[11:22] however thank god
[11:26] in this great city of sin
[11:30] as the bible says god
[11:33] never leaves himself without a witness
[11:38] and within the the very
[11:41] they bought this city
[11:44] was a little flock
[11:48] a small body of believers
[11:52] anointed with the word of god
[11:56] carrying the message of the hour
[11:59] the same message that paul preached
[12:03] they were preaching it within that great
[12:07] city
[12:09] a small group just like elijah had
[12:14] a small group just like
[12:17] gideon had just about 300 people or so
[12:21] that's what what he had against the
[12:23] great mighty empire of the time
[12:26] but god used him with 300 men to defeat
[12:29] them
[12:30] in the name of jehovah amen
[12:33] jesus came on the scene in his day
[12:37] what did he have 12 disciples
[12:40] 12 disciples friends i tell you
[12:45] numbers are wonderful but it's not the
[12:48] number
[12:50] it's the god who is behind you
[12:53] but the battle is not yours but the
[12:55] battle is the lord's
[12:58] samson anointed by the holy ghost
[13:02] was able to defeat the entire philistine
[13:05] army
[13:06] with what a rotten piece of a
[13:09] jawbone of a donkey an
[13:13] ass defeated them everyone why
[13:17] because the spirit of the lord was upon
[13:20] him
[13:21] the spirit of the lord was with him
[13:24] and when the spirit of the lord is with
[13:27] you
[13:27] you are invincible you are the conqueror
[13:32] you are the overcomer when the holy
[13:35] spirit
[13:36] rests upon your life and you are certain
[13:39] of
[13:40] god and convinced by the holy spirit
[13:43] that you are a child of his amen
[13:46] glory to god hallelujah this small
[13:49] group of believers they were in the
[13:53] minority
[13:54] you know most people have to run after
[13:56] the majority run after the majority
[13:59] well every people are in this church or
[14:01] that big church or
[14:03] that big over there oh but god always
[14:06] has a hidden
[14:07] few off to the side that's different
[14:11] that he was used in his
[14:14] own way for his glory and honor
[14:18] and so this small group was not
[14:22] charmed hypnotized or
[14:26] fooled by the richness
[14:30] and beauty of the city
[14:35] but they hated the satanic warship
[14:39] that filled the place the
[14:43] foulness of sin was everywhere
[14:47] the incense of unbelief
[14:50] was everywhere and they
[14:54] lived above sin and they avoided that
[14:58] temple and the people of that temple as
[15:00] much
[15:01] as they could now this age of purgamos
[15:07] lasted for about 300 years
[15:11] that is from 3 12 80
[15:16] to 6 0
[15:19] 6 a.d
[15:24] so much versus the city of the fergamus
[15:27] now let us talk about this great
[15:29] messenger
[15:31] our brother martin
[15:35] the messenger of god for the pardonless
[15:38] church age
[15:40] join me as we go into
[15:43] this graphic journey of the
[15:47] life of our brother martin not martin
[15:50] luther
[15:52] brother martin of chores
[15:55] amen now
[15:59] we know friends that martin was
[16:03] born 315 a.d
[16:07] in the nation of hungary
[16:12] however most of his great ministry and
[16:16] work
[16:18] was done in the nation of france
[16:23] and especially in the city of
[16:26] tours where he became
[16:30] bishop of tours and later
[16:33] died in 399
[16:37] a.d
[16:41] he was a wonderful believer
[16:44] a marvelous christian a
[16:47] man anointed and used of god
[16:50] and and let me say this he was also
[16:54] the uncle of
[16:57] saint patrick of the irish
[17:02] or of ireland his story
[17:06] is another story but he was
[17:09] the nephew of
[17:12] uh saint martin or saint martin was the
[17:16] uncle
[17:16] of saint patrick
[17:20] now martin was converted to christ while
[17:22] he was following
[17:24] his career as a soldier
[17:28] and while he was a soldier a great thing
[17:31] happened
[17:34] a cold winter day
[17:38] and there before in the street
[17:42] was an old beggar
[17:45] the bishops passed him by
[17:50] the archbishops richly dressed past the
[17:53] beggar by
[17:57] that did nothing even though he cried
[18:00] for hunger
[18:00] and cried for cold
[18:05] no one paid any attention to his needs
[18:08] or
[18:08] or his desires or his calls or his cries
[18:12] for help
[18:14] but one day as martin was passing by
[18:17] he called out for help
[18:20] martin seeing this poor man's plight
[18:25] and not having any extra garment
[18:28] but the coat that he had on him
[18:32] he took off his coat took a sword
[18:36] cut the coat in half and
[18:39] wrapped his coat around the poor
[18:42] freezing man there
[18:46] in the street and attended to him
[18:50] no doubt you know bought food or
[18:53] something gave it to him
[18:54] the best that he could and then went on
[18:58] his way
[19:01] but that night the lord jesus
[19:05] appeared to martin in a vision
[19:10] and there he stood like the beggar
[19:17] wrapped in martin's half garment
[19:21] that he had wrapped around the beggar
[19:24] it was wrapped around jesus
[19:27] showing that he was that beggar
[19:32] in the street that they all passed by
[19:38] and then he spoke and said martin though
[19:41] you were the least among them yet you
[19:44] are the only one
[19:46] that did this for me
[19:53] and from that time martin who was not
[19:58] yet converted was only a soldier
[20:01] he became converted because
[20:05] of the visitation of the lord
[20:08] and what god did within his heart
[20:12] his life god began to manifest himself
[20:17] through martin's life
[20:18] in a marvelous and wonderful way he left
[20:22] the army
[20:24] and became a leader
[20:28] in the then church which was the
[20:32] roman church he became a leader in it
[20:37] and being a leader in it yet he was
[20:42] very militant against idolatry
[20:45] he could not stand idolatry in
[20:48] any way he cut down their groves
[20:52] and broke up their images
[20:55] and pulled down their so-called high
[20:59] altars confronted
[21:03] the pagans with their evil deeds
[21:06] that they were committed and he
[21:09] challenged them
[21:11] like elijah did with the prophets of
[21:14] baal
[21:14] with the word of god hallelujah
[21:18] and so they caught him
[21:21] and tied him to a tree
[21:24] and took the tree and
[21:28] placed it against a a cliff
[21:31] where they knew there was a gully below
[21:34] and the
[21:35] the tree was already leaning
[21:38] and they did not tie him on the side
[21:41] where he would be
[21:42] safe on the land but that tied him
[21:46] towards the outside of the tree that
[21:49] they knew would surely
[21:50] fall down into the gully
[21:54] and he challenged them that he serves a
[21:57] god
[21:58] that will protect him and provide him
[22:00] and watch over him
[22:03] and he says oh yes we'll
[22:06] cut down the tree and see what your god
[22:09] will do
[22:10] and so they sat down to cut down this
[22:13] tree
[22:14] which they knew already was leaning over
[22:16] the gully
[22:17] or over the cliff and they knew by
[22:21] gravity it will fall towards and over
[22:25] the cliff with him and he would be
[22:27] instantly killed but to their surprise
[22:33] when they cut down the tree
[22:36] it started to fall into the
[22:40] gully and just as it began to fall
[22:44] and they're rushing forward to see what
[22:46] would happen the tree
[22:48] turned back and came back up with martin
[22:52] and fell on them and
[22:56] crushed most of them while the others
[22:59] ran and scattered in every
[23:03] possible way amen hallelujah my friends
[23:09] god used martin in this manner
[23:13] it is written in the historical records
[23:17] that this man our brother martin
[23:21] a believer of the word hallelujah
[23:26] was empowered by god to raise the dead
[23:30] at least three times
[23:34] in recorded history not
[23:37] man-made but recorded
[23:41] by others that were there on the scene
[23:45] that god used him to raise the dead
[23:50] how that a baby
[23:54] my friend was dead
[23:58] and like elijah in the bible
[24:02] he prayed for that dead baby
[24:06] and the dead baby came back to life
[24:11] and health and growth
[24:16] on another occasion
[24:20] a brother was caught by the authorities
[24:24] and carried away for persecution because
[24:28] of believing in the true fullness of
[24:32] the word of god
[24:35] and there martin
[24:39] rushed to find a brother but when he got
[24:42] on the scene
[24:44] the brother was already hanging on a
[24:47] tree
[24:48] his eyes bulging out in his face
[24:51] out of the sockets but martin took him
[24:55] down
[24:58] from off the tree laid him on the ground
[25:02] laid his hands upon him and
[25:05] prayed in the powerful name of jesus
[25:10] and lo and behold in the sight of the
[25:14] pagans and of the believers
[25:17] the brother rose up once more to full
[25:20] health
[25:21] and life and lived for many years for
[25:25] the glory of god
[25:26] they scattered they ran everywhere while
[25:29] believers were praising and thanking and
[25:31] glorifying god
[25:33] for god was using brother martin
[25:39] brother martin had a lot great faith
[25:43] and he believed in acting on the word
[25:46] also brother martin was fearless
[25:50] when it comes to the word he had no
[25:53] he had respect for people but he did not
[25:56] have partiality
[25:57] or respects for all manner of positions
[26:00] dignitaries
[26:01] wealth and all that type of thing he
[26:04] stayed with the word
[26:07] all at all times one time he went to
[26:10] face to face
[26:12] to visit the emperor
[26:15] who was responsible for the death of
[26:18] many of his
[26:19] spirit-filled brethren
[26:23] and the emperor would not uh
[26:26] have an audience with martin he would
[26:28] not
[26:29] allow him to be let into the palace
[26:32] into the throne room and so
[26:37] martin went to a bishop that he knew
[26:40] and the bishop wanted nothing to do with
[26:43] it for he didn't want to be involved and
[26:45] has his position
[26:47] uh undermined or brought into any
[26:50] troubles
[26:52] so martin left when he got
[26:55] back to uh the palace
[26:59] not just the throne room was closed but
[27:03] the
[27:03] doors of the entire palace was closed
[27:07] up to him according to history
[27:11] martin knelt before that doorway
[27:15] and prayed and prayed under the power of
[27:18] god
[27:19] until the holy spirit
[27:22] the people just watched those great sick
[27:25] doors suddenly began to sway
[27:29] open before him
[27:32] and he opened his eyes and the palace
[27:35] doors were
[27:36] open because the guards were all scared
[27:39] nervous ran away they didn't know what
[27:41] was happening
[27:42] but it was the power of god on the scene
[27:46] hallelujah brother martin picked himself
[27:50] up walked in the palace
[27:54] and went into the tron room
[27:58] and there he began to
[28:01] speak to the emperor to tell him
[28:04] what he was doing but with his pride his
[28:08] arrogance
[28:10] the emperor refused to even turn his
[28:13] face to him
[28:14] and turn away to the side and would not
[28:18] listen to martin's uh
[28:22] requests and report of what was
[28:26] happening
[28:27] to the people of the lord
[28:30] while the emperor had his face turned
[28:34] all of a sudden fire came from heaven
[28:38] fire beneath his throne and the emperor
[28:42] had to stand quickly to his
[28:44] feet in front of martin all my friends
[28:48] a servant of god anointed with the holy
[28:51] spirit
[28:52] upon this earth is greater than anyone
[28:55] or anything
[28:56] else upon the face of the earth
[29:00] you remember when pilate said to jesus
[29:05] i have power over you to set you free
[29:10] amen because they brought you up in
[29:12] front of me
[29:14] and i have the power to set you free
[29:17] amen
[29:18] but what pilate did not know
[29:22] it's not that jesus was up before him he
[29:26] was the one that was really up before
[29:28] jesus
[29:30] he was the one that was really in
[29:32] judgment
[29:34] of the word for jesus was the word
[29:38] as simple as he seemed as downtrodden as
[29:42] he seemed
[29:42] as poor as he seemed oh my
[29:46] yet he was the word god was now
[29:50] it was being looked at his reaction
[29:54] how would he act to the word but with
[29:56] his great pomposity position
[29:58] power and and maybe his wealth he said i
[30:02] have authority over you and jesus said
[30:04] you have no authority over me i can call
[30:08] right now ten thousand angels
[30:11] one angel alone would do it but i can
[30:13] call ten thousand
[30:15] just think of it he could have called
[30:18] ten thousand angels
[30:20] to free himself get away from the
[30:23] suffering
[30:25] and not worry about going to the cross
[30:27] to save
[30:28] our sins but the bible tells us he
[30:31] did that he went to calvary he
[30:34] died for you and me and for the glory of
[30:37] god
[30:40] and here it is this emperor would not
[30:43] turn his
[30:43] face towards martin and god taught him a
[30:47] lesson
[30:49] that you should always show respects for
[30:51] god's servants
[30:55] god's anointed servants god's
[30:58] proven vindicated servants
[31:03] always honor and pay respects
[31:07] for genuine vindicated
[31:11] servants of the living god
[31:14] and there my friends god forced him by
[31:17] fire underneath his seat to stand up
[31:21] and pay respects to the servant
[31:24] of the living god god knows how to
[31:28] humble the proud
[31:31] god knows how to
[31:34] lift up the lowly god knows how to lift
[31:37] you
[31:38] up and god knows how to humble the proud
[31:43] but you know when a man a woman a
[31:46] believer is
[31:46] zealous for the lord
[31:50] they get victories but then satan begins
[31:53] to
[31:54] uh rail up against them satan becomes
[31:56] angry
[31:57] against that true believer for stirring
[32:01] up his nest
[32:02] for shaking out the true believers
[32:06] from unbelief and away from him
[32:10] and so these enemies of the truth hired
[32:14] assassins
[32:16] to come against martin
[32:20] and to find him and to assassinate him
[32:26] they caught martin they surrounded him
[32:30] and when they wanted to assassinate him
[32:34] history says he was not scared
[32:38] he did not run you know
[32:41] he turned and raised his neck
[32:44] here is my throat if you're to
[32:47] assassinate me go ahead
[32:49] and do the job that they sent you
[32:53] to do and they
[32:56] leapt to cut
[32:59] his neck with the sword and as they leap
[33:02] forward the power of god struck
[33:06] all of them and threw them backwards
[33:09] against
[33:10] the walls of the room and they
[33:13] fell upon the ground in fear and begin
[33:16] to
[33:16] call out to the martin's god
[33:21] and ask brother martin there for mercy
[33:26] and there martin was able to
[33:29] lead them to jesus christ oh glory to
[33:33] god hallelujah
[33:34] blessed be the name and that god is the
[33:37] same
[33:38] god today that's god is doing the same
[33:41] things today
[33:42] for his glory and for his honor
[33:44] believers now this
[33:46] do you believe the word of god do you
[33:49] receive the word of
[33:50] god may the great holy spirit grow with
[33:53] you
[33:54] may the holy spirit accompany you may
[33:56] the holy spirit my friends
[33:58] vindicate your life your walk your
[34:01] ministry
[34:02] and the truth that you have received
[34:05] and that you are receiving now thank god
[34:08] many have gone before us
[34:12] simple humble people but walking
[34:15] under the influence and inspiration
[34:19] of the blessed holy spirit of the living
[34:22] god
[34:24] amen too often
[34:28] when god begins to use men and anoint
[34:31] them
[34:32] and use their ministry with the healing
[34:35] of the sick casting all the
[34:37] devils the raising of the dead instead
[34:40] of them
[34:41] realizing they're not doing it it's god
[34:43] doing it
[34:44] and if they rise up in pride the holy
[34:46] spirit will
[34:48] take his flight away from them
[34:52] and many times they're raised up in
[34:54] pride
[34:56] they come full of themselves
[35:00] as if they are mighty men
[35:05] but god doesn't want your intelligence
[35:08] your
[35:08] might your power your humanity he wants
[35:11] your surrender
[35:14] he wants you to humble yourself to him
[35:18] that he could lend you his power his
[35:21] presence
[35:22] his wisdom his knowledge his inspiration
[35:26] and that he will be with you all he's
[35:29] asking
[35:30] is for us to be humble simple reverent
[35:34] oh praise his wonderful name and god
[35:38] will use us for his glory and for his
[35:41] honor
[35:43] lifted up with pride but thank god
[35:46] martin remained humble
[35:50] for all his days it is said
[35:53] at one time while in his
[35:57] little office in the back praying
[36:01] preparing for his sermon to come out
[36:06] that a beggar came into the church
[36:09] and asked the deeker deacon for
[36:12] sustenance
[36:15] the head deacon filled with pride for
[36:18] his position
[36:20] that he's a head deacon drove the beggar
[36:23] out
[36:24] and told him to vacate the place
[36:29] there upon the beggar
[36:32] as you know circled around came by the
[36:36] back way and
[36:37] went in and was able to see
[36:41] martin in person
[36:44] martin immediately stood up
[36:48] and took the beggar
[36:51] took off his robe
[36:54] that he had on him and put it
[36:58] around that dear brother
[37:02] and asked the deacon to bring him
[37:06] a regular ordinary robe
[37:10] the beggar went out
[37:13] into the cold street
[37:16] saint martin stood up
[37:20] and stepped into the pulpit to preach
[37:23] the word of
[37:24] god under the holy spirit
[37:28] and to their surprise
[37:31] around martin they saw a glow
[37:35] of light emanating
[37:38] from around his entire body from
[37:41] head to toe light was all around him
[37:45] that he was unconscious of
[37:48] but he was preaching the word
[37:53] surely my brothers truly
[37:56] this was not just only a great man
[38:00] but he was our brother and he was the
[38:03] messenger
[38:04] to this that pergamos
[38:07] church age never never
[38:11] desirous of anything else
[38:14] a pleasing man but always wanted to
[38:19] please the living god and he lived a
[38:22] pure
[38:23] holy and consecrated life
[38:27] and god used him it was said
[38:33] many times he would not preach unless he
[38:36] had
[38:37] a wonderful time and season in the
[38:40] presence of the lord
[38:43] and to know how and what to deliver
[38:47] from the very mouth of the living god
[38:53] and i want to quote the history says
[38:56] often
[38:57] martin would keep the people waiting
[39:02] while he stayed in his vestry
[39:05] office praying for full assurance
[39:10] before he came out to his pulpit
[39:14] a man that was
[39:18] steeped and soaked under the
[39:21] anointing of prayer oh
[39:25] prayer will bring god's blessings down
[39:29] so let us pray pray pray pray
[39:33] only believe all things are
[39:36] possible to them that will believe the
[39:39] word of god
[39:40] oh brother sister pray that the holy
[39:44] spirit
[39:44] will use you pray that the holy spirit
[39:48] will meet the needs of the people pray
[39:50] that god will
[39:51] fill our hearts with love and use us
[39:54] for his glory and for his honor oh
[39:58] praise god hallelujah amen
[40:03] yes my friends just to know
[40:07] he had such a mighty ministry
[40:11] you think that would just give him a
[40:12] wonderful marvelous
[40:14] life but it brought much persecution
[40:18] the saints got persecuted
[40:22] and destroyed by the devil and no doubt
[40:26] the devil
[40:26] will attack some of you tell you all
[40:29] manner of things and maybe even
[40:31] physically attack you
[40:32] amen and there
[40:36] through the instrumentality of the devil
[40:38] many wicked
[40:40] people were used by the devil
[40:45] burning believers at the stakes
[40:50] nailed to logs face down
[40:55] and their stomachs burst open
[40:59] deliberately for the intestines
[41:03] to be exposed and then they would lose
[41:07] a bunch of wild dogs to
[41:10] pull and rake and tear against the
[41:12] intestines
[41:14] of that believer laying upon that
[41:17] log oh they're flesh and
[41:20] bowels bloody and torn by these
[41:24] wicked wild dogs
[41:28] babies were often ripped out of their
[41:32] out of the not only the arms of their
[41:35] mother but they'll
[41:36] cut their stomach and rip the child out
[41:39] in their hatred for this message and
[41:42] this
[41:42] word this true true word
[41:46] of the lord jesus christ oh thank
[41:49] god i am one of them i am one of them
[41:53] hallelujah oh praises marvelous name
[41:57] i am glad that i can say i am
[42:00] one of them i separate and dedicate and
[42:04] consecrate my entire youth and
[42:08] entire life to this hour and will
[42:11] continue
[42:12] to do so for god's glory until the day
[42:16] he calls me home then i'll drop this
[42:19] veil of flesh and rise to seize the
[42:22] everlasting prize
[42:24] and shout while passing through the air
[42:27] farewell
[42:28] farewell hour of prayer
[42:31] yes my friends
[42:35] they would take expectant mothers
[42:39] rip their stomachs open and throw them
[42:43] before the hogs
[42:46] women were made to stand up tied to a
[42:49] post
[42:51] and they will cut off their breasts and
[42:54] leave them to bleed to death while the
[42:57] blood comes
[42:58] pouring out and never crumple
[43:02] in death
[43:07] the tragedy is worse when you come to
[43:10] realize
[43:12] that this was not just the work of the
[43:15] unbelieving heathen
[43:18] but this was the work of some of the
[43:21] so-called church people that were in the
[43:25] church
[43:27] not knowing what true faith is what true
[43:30] the true word is the one god is
[43:34] the true baptism is they know
[43:37] nothing about that and so they come
[43:40] against the saints of
[43:42] god back in that day and they'll come
[43:45] against you in this day
[43:47] oh my god may your fate stand
[43:50] firm in the midst of tribulation and
[43:53] trial
[43:54] as you haul to god's unchanging hand
[43:59] but it was not just unbelievers
[44:03] but a lot of so-called christians
[44:06] who felt they were doing god a favor
[44:10] and they were more righteous
[44:13] in helping god to get rid
[44:17] of these elements by exterminating
[44:21] the true loyal soldiers of the cross
[44:25] marching onto victory they one
[44:29] they were killing out and exterminating
[44:32] the sons of the lord who stood for the
[44:35] word
[44:36] and walked in obedience of the holy
[44:39] spirit
[44:41] listen to the scripture john 16
[44:44] 2 they shall put you out of
[44:48] synagogues yay
[44:51] the time comet that whosoever killeth
[44:55] you
[44:56] will think he do it goddess service
[45:01] matthew 24 9.
[45:04] then shall they deliver you up to be
[45:07] afflicted
[45:09] and shall kill you and shall be
[45:12] you shall be hated of all nations
[45:16] today we'll set denominations
[45:20] you'll be hated by all
[45:24] nations and denominations
[45:27] for my name's sake you took on the name
[45:31] of jesus
[45:32] christ and the devil becomes
[45:35] mad he wants you to walk in darkness
[45:39] and to still say eve at an apple
[45:42] and not to realize she committed sexual
[45:45] sin
[45:46] he wants you to believe in the titles of
[45:49] father
[45:50] son holy cross and not to know
[45:54] that those titles have one person behind
[45:57] them
[45:58] with one name and the name is jesus
[46:01] christ
[46:02] and to no other name given under heaven
[46:06] whereby we must be saved but the name of
[46:09] jesus
[46:10] christ our lord they want to keep you to
[46:12] walk in darkness
[46:14] and to tell you that the holy spirit
[46:17] can't lead you
[46:18] the denominations will lead you but back
[46:21] to the word
[46:22] back to the promises of the bible back
[46:24] to the original
[46:25] faith that paul had amen back to the
[46:28] truth we find here
[46:30] in god's word for the day and for this
[46:33] hour
[46:34] blessed be his holy name amen yes sir
[46:38] i tell you martin was a truly
[46:42] vindicated messenger of the living god
[46:47] but not only was he gifted
[46:50] with an anointed gifted ministry
[46:54] as god will anoint and give to some of
[46:57] you that are listening to me
[46:58] right now for his glory amen
[47:02] hallelujah amen not only
[47:05] was he like that the main thing he was
[47:10] true to god's word
[47:13] he would not swerve sway
[47:16] duck dive bend
[47:19] in any way amen he will stay with
[47:24] god's word history says
[47:27] he fought against organization
[47:31] history says he withstood sin
[47:34] in high places not only among the poor
[47:38] and the lowly but he stood against sin
[47:41] in high places spiritual wickedness
[47:44] in high places he stood against it
[47:48] and he championed the word of truth
[47:52] and he lived it in word and
[47:56] indeed amen and he
[47:59] his life was a life of full christian
[48:03] victory amen hallelujah
[48:06] i'm so glad to have a brother like that
[48:11] i'm glad to have brother martin as a
[48:14] son and saint of the living god
[48:19] victorious over sin
[48:22] victorious over the flesh and over the
[48:26] devil
[48:28] one biographer wrote of him
[48:32] no one ever saw martin angry
[48:37] or disturbed by anything
[48:41] or grieving
[48:44] or laughing too much he was always one
[48:49] in the same
[48:51] seemingly beyond mortal
[48:56] wearing on his countenance a continuance
[49:00] continual sort of celestial
[49:04] joy never
[49:08] was anything on his lips but christ
[49:11] and christ alone never
[49:14] anything in his heart
[49:18] but piety holiness consecration
[49:21] peace and pity for those that were
[49:24] down lowly and needy
[49:28] often he would weep for the sins
[49:31] even of those who would come against him
[49:35] he would pray for those and weep for
[49:38] them and for their salvation
[49:41] who when many times he was quiet
[49:44] and when he was not around many of them
[49:48] as we would say in colloquial talk
[49:51] would talk about him behind his back
[49:58] he had with using their viperous
[50:01] lies and their snake-like
[50:04] attitude and their
[50:08] poisonous tongues
[50:11] would spread rumors and speak all manner
[50:14] of evil against martin
[50:16] behind his back
[50:19] and they hated him
[50:23] they hated him for what his virtues
[50:26] hated him for the miracles and presence
[50:30] of god
[50:31] in his life which they themselves did
[50:34] not
[50:34] possess and they could not imitate
[50:38] his life and his walk with god
[50:42] and sad to say his
[50:45] worst and his bitterest attackers
[50:50] were bishops preachers
[50:55] and a lot of religious church people
[50:58] of that day as it was then so is it now
[51:02] listen to this scripture as i'm about to
[51:05] close
[51:06] matthew 5 10 verses 10
[51:10] to 12. jesus speaking
[51:14] blessed are they which are persecuted
[51:17] for righteousness sake
[51:20] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[51:25] blessed are ye when men shall revile you
[51:30] and persecute you and say all
[51:33] manner of evil against you
[51:36] falsely for my sake
[51:39] rejoice rejoice
[51:43] and be exceeding glad for

[52:04] the great holy spirit
[52:06] place it as blood upon the doorposts of
[52:10] your heart

[52:15] your position in christ who your father
[52:18] is
[52:19] and where we are going i'm on my way to
