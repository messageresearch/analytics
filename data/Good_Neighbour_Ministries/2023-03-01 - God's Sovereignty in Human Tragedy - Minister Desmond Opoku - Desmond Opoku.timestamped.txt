[31:14] but the children of God
[31:17] we always desire things because
[31:20] you have a good intention to have them
[31:25] because God give us cash
[31:29] what we do with the cars we take it to
[31:31] work
[31:33] and we drive DACA we dedicated that car
[31:37] to God and drive every day and night to

[32:00] abundance
[32:02] God children are rich

[32:08] we are rich in properties
[32:12] not here only
[32:15] by the world to come
[32:18] everything that you have
[32:21] you will never lose it
[32:26] if you use it wisely
[32:28] for the glory of God
[32:31] we have houses
[32:33] we have Fellowship
[32:35] we we do so many things
[32:39] in our houses
[32:42] we
[32:45] we live inside there
[32:48] and put it God gave us that houses
[32:51] that's a roof on our head
[32:54] to live to enjoy
[32:57] the world that we are living in
[33:00] Hallelujah
[33:06] but we fail
[33:07] remember nothing good comes from Satan
[33:12] all good things come from
[33:15] God
[33:16] Hallelujah
[33:18] Satan will never give you any good
[33:21] things
[33:24] his intention is to destroy
[33:29] he can make you be he can why God give
[33:33] you in riches or something
[33:35] he can turn that riches
[33:38] to benefit for himself
[33:41] sat down
[33:42] some some time we are not allow the
[33:45] people to use that riches for the glory
[33:48] of God
[33:50] he used it for his own benefit
[33:55] God is sovereign
[33:58] he can do all things
[34:01] there is nothing that God cannot do
[34:06] there is nothing can
[34:09] God cannot do he can do all things
[34:13] but let me tell you
[34:16] we human beings whether Christian or not
[34:20] Christians
[34:22] when anything anytime bad things happen
[34:25] to us
[34:27] we always
[34:29] have questioning our mind
[34:33] you always go
[34:35] we started rebuking
[34:38] we decided to do all do all kinds of
[34:40] things
[34:41] have questions in our mind in our
[34:43] thoughts everywhere you can't even
[34:46] that's the way the fresh Acts
[34:50] you can't sustain it
[34:53] but sometimes we fail
[34:56] to recognize that God is suffering he
[34:59] can do all things
[35:01] Hallelujah if God is suffering he can do
[35:05] all things anything that comes to your
[35:07] way
[35:08] if you read the book of Romans as we
[35:11] read it
[35:13] because I read it again
[35:16] and we know that all things work
[35:20] together for good to those who love God
[35:26] right
[35:28] if all things work together for those
[35:31] who love God
[35:33] why sometimes things happening
[35:37] we don't go to him
[35:39] and pray I ask
[35:42] I see
[35:44] whether the hand of God isn't it
[35:48] I will turn around
[35:50] and frustrate ourselves
[35:53] and put yourself in jeopardy
[35:58] for instance if you go to the doctor
[36:00] just right now and you have let me tell
[36:03] you Satan is doing all kind of things
[36:08] if you turn around whether you're a
[36:11] Believer you're not believer the
[36:13] sickness is everywhere
[36:15] somebody has diabetes
[36:17] somebody had the blood pressure
[36:19] somebody have this somebody have this
[36:22] somebody have this
[36:24] are you going to stay all night
[36:27] without sleeping
[36:29] and thinking about all these symptoms
[36:33] it's a question
[36:35] to all of us
[36:38] if all things work together for those
[36:41] who love God
[36:44] you don't know
[36:46] whether it's from God
[36:49] or what it is
[36:52] first thing what you have to do
[36:55] you have to go to God your heavenly
[36:58] father
[36:59] and pray to him
[37:03] he can do all things
[37:05] he can he can heal you right there or
[37:10] you can hear you in the future along the
[37:13] way or there's something in your life
[37:17] somewhere God wants to use that tragedy
[37:23] for his own Glory
[37:25] sometimes you use those things that to
[37:28] bring his children in line
[37:30] all his ministers in line
[37:34] but we always want something good
[37:39] sleep you always want to be happy who
[37:42] don't want to be happy everybody wants
[37:44] to be happy
[37:45] I don't want to get sick
[37:49] I don't want to get into problem I want
[37:51] to have money
[37:53] I Want to Be Free who don't want to be
[37:56] free everybody wants to be free
[37:59] but let me tell you the freedom God has
[38:02] given to us is more than anything what
[38:06] you're looking for in this life because
[38:07] the Bible said this world will pass away
[38:12] this world that we are living it will
[38:15] pass away
[38:17] whether you live before Rapture or you
[38:21] stay on the Rapture You're Gonna Leave
[38:23] This World Behind
[38:25] Hallelujah glory to God so why don't you
[38:29] lift up your eye
[38:32] to your heavenly father
[38:34] when something happened
[38:37] whether you're gonna use that thing
[38:38] there for me to go home earlier
[38:41] you remember one Prophet God told him
[38:44] man set you up set your house in order
[38:48] tonight I'm gonna take you
[38:50] what happened he turned his back
[38:54] because why he has
[38:57] riches God bless him
[38:59] abundantly
[39:01] and the world was good he was living
[39:04] right and the brother the brother was
[39:07] right with God
[39:09] he don't want to leave this world here
[39:11] so he turns back
[39:13] I wept saw
[39:16] Lord I don't want to leave
[39:19] I want to stay a little bit
[39:21] do you want to stay a little bit
[39:24] Hallelujah glory to God Amen God is good
[39:30] I love the Lord
[39:32] his words are marvelous
[39:35] his words are perfect
[39:38] he made you perfect he's guiding you
[39:42] perfect
[39:44] oh Hallelujah we serve a sovereign God
[39:50] Hallelujah glory to God
[39:55] thank you Lord
[40:00] I'm gonna read something for you here
[40:03] we read we read the scripture
[40:06] and that scripture that we read pertain
[40:09] to
[40:11] we're gonna see
[40:15] it is common to hear people rejoice
[40:19] or sometimes even boast
[40:23] that their material properties is a
[40:27] blessing from God
[40:29] yet
[40:30] have you ever had anyone
[40:33] say my business failure was a blessing
[40:37] from God have you ever ever had anybody
[40:40] anybody say like that
[40:41] my business failure is a blessing from
[40:45] God hallelujah
[40:48] whoever lose the business and rejoice
[40:51] Hallelujah
[40:58] oh what he's doing is going up and down
[41:01] up and down up and down instead of him
[41:05] to turn back to his maker who gave him
[41:08] that business to run for his life
[41:11] because that business as a Believer the
[41:13] business that he ran is for a purpose
[41:16] because
[41:19] the scripture says all good things come
[41:21] from God and everything that you have is
[41:24] is is a purpose
[41:27] Hallelujah
[41:29] thank you Lord
[41:32] nobody nobody rejoice when you lose
[41:35] business
[41:37] why is it only good things are seen as
[41:41] blessing
[41:42] why
[41:45] Hallelujah bad things is not a blessing
[41:49] but Bible said all things work together
[41:52] for those who love the Lord hallelujah
[41:55] so you have to count everything that
[41:58] happened in your life a blessing
[42:01] don't tell your heart your face to your
[42:05] brother your sister and have a long face
[42:07] Rejoice smile God knows everything in
[42:12] your life
[42:13] and his interest is he has interest
[42:17] every little thing in your life
[42:20] there is nothing in your life God is not
[42:23] interested
[42:25] Hallelujah because he call you and me
[42:28] for a purpose
[42:30] thank you Lord
[42:31] amen
[42:37] why is it that only good things are seen
[42:39] as blessing
[42:41] why bad things are viewed as tragedies
[42:47] bad things are viewed as tragedies
[42:51] human beings
[42:57] from a very limited
[43:00] perspective
[43:06] what looked like a tragedy may be the
[43:10] best thing that ever happened to you
[43:16] maybe what you look that this is bad
[43:20] thing that ever happened to me
[43:25] is the best thing that I have ever
[43:28] happened to you you that's why you
[43:31] always recognize the god that you said
[43:35] he's he can do all things
[43:40] he is God he never changed he started
[43:43] his strategy
[43:45] when he speak wanting that thing is
[43:48] forever it's eternal
[43:50] he does not turn back
[43:53] Hallelujah God don't save you today
[43:57] and you lost tomorrow

[44:12] let your life lie
[44:15] in line with the gospel the word of God
[44:20] Hallelujah
[44:39] particularly when God's hand is
[44:43] super
[44:44] superintendent it's very intending an
[44:47] outcome
[44:48] for example a poor youth whose family
[44:51] sold him into slavery
[44:54] May emerge later as a wiser person fit
[44:58] to be fit to be the king
[45:01] you understand what he's saying there
[45:04] Joseph
[45:07] when Joseph was put in the pit
[45:13] and he went to Egypt they sent him to
[45:16] prison why are you going to think about
[45:18] that oh it's a big tragedy yes
[45:23] but you don't know
[45:27] how the hand of God is into it that's
[45:31] why when something happened to somebody
[45:34] don't
[45:36] sit there or stand there and criticize
[45:41] I said all this all this you gotta say
[45:43] something at last you're gonna regret
[45:47] pray for one another
[45:50] live for one another

[46:29] when he told his dream
[46:31] they do not understand
[46:34] but God has prepared him for a special
[46:37] purpose and he has passed he has to pass
[46:41] through
[46:42] something tragic tragic
[46:45] that
[46:47] you think
[46:49] is not of God
[46:51] something
[46:53] or maybe sometimes we view people oh
[46:58] something happened secretary
[47:01] secret sin as job his own friend told
[47:05] him oh that's a secret thing
[47:07] he that's the secret that's it

[57:27] tragedy to fix you up
[57:32] are you lock you up
[57:35] as a Shepherd when a sheep he doesn't he

[57:42] he run what what do you do you take the
[57:45] leg
[57:47] and then he break the leg
[57:51] and the Sheep now he can't go nowhere so

[58:23] God can use his use tragedy to perform
[58:27] his duties
[58:30] for example
[58:32] let's talk about Jonah
[58:35] Jonah
[58:37] a prophet
[58:42] was a sinful City God cannot control
[58:46] that City
[58:47] and God children were there
[58:52] and because the city was so much Idol
[58:56] adultery
[58:58] this
[58:59] City all the children began to worship
[59:02] join themselves to worship that adult
[59:06] and you know the other God they were
[59:09] worshiping was away
[59:14] somebody may look at
[59:17] Jonah how did Jonah somebody
[59:22] somebody we don't know whether God has a
[59:25] a a a oxygen tank in the belly there
[59:29] that sustained Jonah Jonah found himself
[59:32] where because let me tell you the city
[59:36] was so bad Jonah don't want to go
[59:39] you understand he does not want to go
[59:43] so God said you don't want to go the the
[59:46] reason why I'm sending you these people
[59:48] they worship
[59:50] the will
[59:52] so if you don't go I'm I'm giving you a
[59:56] ride a special ride
[59:58] then he put him right in the Jonas
[1:00:01] birthday and then the waist belly
[1:00:04] and Jonah found himself Hallelujah
[1:00:06] that's the time he was praying that's
[1:00:08] why I told him when you get it some
[1:00:10] things track you don't stay there you're
[1:00:13] not remember
[1:00:14] could you imagine a way badly
[1:00:17] he doesn't know whether Jerusalem is
[1:00:19] here
[1:00:21] Bethlehem is here Jordan is here Egypt
[1:00:24] is here
[1:00:26] and he already know what Solomon said
[1:00:30] when you are in trouble and you tell
[1:00:32] your heart and before the temple of God
[1:00:36] and you pray God will hear you
[1:00:39] now where is the temple of God that's
[1:00:42] here
[1:00:44] in your heart
[1:00:46] you understand that's why you have to
[1:00:48] pray when tragedy strike
[1:00:53] and

[1:00:59] when everybody

[1:01:05] when they're worshiping diagnosis it's
[1:01:06] not just the city

[1:01:13] worship they they have drums dancing
[1:01:18] with the drinking with all kinds of
[1:01:20] rivalries

[1:09:12] but God made it for good
[1:09:18] Joseph God sent him over there to
[1:09:22] preserve one life
[1:09:24] yes
[1:09:26] he's telling me there to preserve life
[1:09:30] if God didn't send Joseph there and use
[1:09:33] him and tell Pharaoh what to do to to to
[1:09:36] to to to save the Grain and stuff like
[1:09:39] that the whole world will perish
[1:09:43] you you don't know why how God gonna use
[1:09:45] you anything that happened to your life
[1:09:48] you don't know
[1:09:51] he said
[1:09:53] anything that happened to us has a
[1:09:56] purpose
[1:09:59] so not every time
[1:10:01] you're gonna you're gonna something
[1:10:03] happened to you
[1:10:06] I rejoice
[1:10:08] Lord what do you have me to do
[1:10:11] I rejoice when I say is it my time to go
[1:10:15] let that perfect will be done
[1:10:18] the lord giveth the Lord take it
[1:10:21] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:10:24] if we believe we don't own our lives
[1:10:29] anything that happened to you
[1:10:32] there's the hand of God is in it because
[1:10:35] you don't know how what time you sleep
[1:10:37] when you go to bed you know what how you
[1:10:39] sleep you know what are you gonna wake
[1:10:41] up tomorrow you know we don't know what
[1:10:43] what are you gonna wake up tomorrow
[1:10:45] so many people sleep they don't wake up
[1:10:49] so many people sleep by the time they
[1:10:52] they get up their eye opening but they
[1:10:54] can't get up
[1:10:56] God has to turn around and tell them
[1:11:00] what to do the doctors cannot heal
[1:11:04] one day somebody's sick and they take
[1:11:06] him to the doctor Hospital
[1:11:08] they they knew that what what they have
[1:11:12] to do but they don't know whether that
[1:11:15] person could have survived or he doesn't
[1:11:16] survive they try the best as they can
[1:11:19] it's God that healed that person
[1:11:22] yes
[1:11:24] so God control every life
[1:11:28] God every life here God control it
[1:11:32] but we have blessed that we have found
[1:11:35] God has colored an open understanding to
[1:11:38] know the God that he control the life is
[1:11:41] in the heart
[1:11:43] hear me that's a blessed blessed bonus
[1:11:47] blessing and this life is going on
[1:11:50] toward eternity
[1:11:52] glory to God
[1:11:55] amen
[1:11:57] so I'm gonna uh
[1:11:59] I'm going to pray something for you now
[1:12:03] our own prophet
[1:12:06] brother
[1:12:09] Brown
[1:12:12] when he was beginning his ministry
[1:12:15] the time when God was directing him
[1:12:17] somewhere somewhere he stumble
[1:12:21] and God
[1:12:23] has to bring him
[1:12:25] back
[1:12:26] in life because why he has a work
[1:12:31] for God for you and me if God is Abraham
[1:12:34] to reveal to us who we are
[1:12:38] now he has introduced to because he has
[1:12:42] to introduce for Christ to Christ
[1:12:46] so if there's anything that will
[1:12:51] will hinder the word of God God
[1:12:55] human beings sometimes as a lamb real
[1:12:58] arms
[1:12:59] God has to break our leg
[1:13:02] for us so that he can work control us
[1:13:06] so I'm gonna play this Tafe for you to
