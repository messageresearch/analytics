amen learn to depend on his word you may be seated god bless you amen i have so much of my heart amen the word has been so rich and sweet lately amen it's just filling me up and filling me up amen and i just thank god for the opportunity to be here this morning it's i can't get into detail but it's it's supernatural how god just deals with our lives and and places us where we need to be in the time we need to be amen hallelujah there's so much uh so much to say here to this morning but um we're just gonna preach the word and preach a thought this morning and hit it on many different angles amen i'm not gonna preach anything uh different than what you already heard or what you've been hearing but i believe that we're all reflections of the great light amen i mean i believe i believe without the man of god he's our pastor but i call him the man of god because he's first the man of god before he's our pastor amen if that light never came to me through him it would not be reflecting through me amen we can't live any higher than our pastor we can't be any more spiritual than our pastor because it doesn't line up with the word of god because we are just reflections of him amen so i i pray this morning that you will see my portion that is being reflected through me and that you will see your portion of the word of god and for you for your day amen that's reflected through you because that's what that's what perfect faith is that's what the new birth you've got to come to recognize who you are and what you are called for amen it's not to exalt any man no man is being exalted here jesus christ is being lifted on high and being exalted amen hallelujah and and i believe we're we're feeding off present truth present prophecy that's coming forth to the bride of jesus christ because remember she must prophesy again amen my title this morning is the bride knows the interpreter of the word amen the bride knows the interpreter she knows the interpretation of the prophecy that is coming forth and she is starting to recognize where to place the prophecy in her own life in her own position because without that you're lost without that you you're blind you can't see amen it's not believing we're going to see without just believing in the past here amen i believe god sent a prophet 100 and the ministry here believes god sent a prophet but the prophet came eliezer to introduce the bride amen to jesus christ amen that's what that what the purpose was for amen not to not to to rely on the past but look what god is doing today amen i can't be i can't come into my full manifestation and be who i am if i'm looking back there at his portion i believe his light reflected down here to this age amen i believe the light of the prophet came through the prophet because the word comes to the prophet it came to our pastor amen it came to the ministry here and it come through him to come to me and come to you and that's where we are this morning hallelujah i believe the bride is at a place of maturity amen i believe the bride is at that place of maturity this morning that that that uh you know she's not deceived by denominations out there she's not deceived by all the denominations 300 000 or whatever that they are all they claim to have the truth the way the light they're not to see the bride's not deceived by that because she's coming into such a maturity she knows but remember the scriptures what the scripture says it'll be so close if it were possible it would deceive the very elect so where is that so close lying this morning we've been hearing being preached but i'm just going to preach it over again let us turn to ii peter 1 19. we've got three scriptures reading here hallelujah hallelujah thank you father ii peter 1 19-21 we have also a more sure word of prophecy where unto ye do well that ye take heed as unto the light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in old times by the will of man amen but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost there it is today that's not just past there that's today i see that scripture being fulfilled in our midst you know when jesus was standing there and he was declaring amen when he was in the temple he was declaring this is the day of salvation this is the day of deliverance tonight and they all the people were sitting there amazed at the law that was being spoken but when jesus stood up and said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes then they look to say what is this what is this romans 8 27. and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what's in the mind of the spirit because he make it intercession for the saints according to the will of god and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did for noah he also predestinated to to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn amongst many brethren moreover moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and them he called he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say then to these things if god before us who can be against us revelations 19 10 a quick scripture here and i fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not many mistakes are happening today in the message with that interpret the scripture it wasn't they felt at jesus's feet see thou do it not i am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy amen thank you lord father bless your word it is blessed father bless your people give us ears to hear give us eyes the sea lord i pray in the name of jesus christ fulfill your word according to your prophecies lord according to your perfect will this morning as we commit each one into your hands father take every spirit subject to the holy spirit this morning to the word of god this morning put a wall of fire and a hedge around us i bind every spirit of doubt and unbelief father in jesus name we pray amen you may be seated hallelujah amen thank you lord what a day we're living i'm going to take a lot of quotes this morning and a lot of scripture this morning and read amen and and try to just bring what god wants to be brought out this thought this morning i know i was preparing this message uh five six weeks ago on god god struck my heart about god as his own interpreter and then i think a week or so later i was i was laughing because the holy spirit brother simon started preaching on it and i was looking through all my notes and it was like lining up and i said oh my i said uh the the the mess has already been preached and and then a brother came to me says no no brother and it's true he says god gave you that message because you are a different reflection of the of the light on on a different angle that we all bring something different so this morning hallelujah we are living in a day of confusion we are living in a day where men and women hardly know what to do everything seems in turmoil everything seems to be sold so many different ways to look satan is doing that amen we can we can see that today that that if he's talking back then the world and and everybody was in turmoil what what about today what about the condition of the people's minds today the conditions of the people's hearts today where they where the bible says that in the last days their hearts will be their conscience would be snare with a hot iron they'll have no conscience anymore we are seeing this manifest in this day and remember prophecy always follows the maturity of the bride amen so we can recognize what day that we are living in we look at we look at the everybody's trying to uh you know cove it everybody's trying to uh interpret covet what's going on with covet why was cole was sent for right ev god has a purpose in everything everything that is happening everything that's taken place is all exactly lined with god god is not confused he's not mixed up with anything he knows exactly what's taken place in the world today and why it has to take place and we need to just rest the bride dresses and trust us in him and what's going on she has in fear amen she's not she's not she's not uh unwise either she's wise in these things right in all the protocols and things that we have to do in our lives is common sense god gave us common sense we know that there's not much common sense left out there but i believe the bride of jesus christ has common sense right but we see how things are starting to line up amen you start seeing how you know we we've seen the pieces of the puzzles for many many years how this rapture is going to take place how this new world order how the market of beast is going to come into its power is going to happen many years we've been seeing pieces of the puzzle but i believe those pieces of the puzzle are starting to be clicked in clicked in clicked in the picture is becoming a lot clearer to us and if that picture is becoming a lot clearer to us i believe the picture of the bride of jesus christ and her portion in the word is becoming a lot clearer i believe she's recognizing who she is where her position is in this hour where's her position her position is not in the other court the inner court be behind the veil where the glories never fail there's a kind of glory that's where she's standing that's where she's placed this morning oh my watch out watch out when you start seeing that arise now oh my my my whoa jesus amen thank you lord amen amen the bible teaches us that god is all-knowing omniscience when we say that god is omniscient we mean that he's perfect knowledge in all things he does not have to learn anything and he has not forgotten anything like we do god does not have to reason things out he doesn't have to figure things out or learn them gradually he knows everything that has happened and everything that will happen and god also knows every potential thing that might even happen god even knows those things that humankind has yet to discover his knowledge is the absolute the omniscience of god means that he has perfect knowledge perfect understanding and perfect wisdom as how to apply that knowledge and that is the god i believe in that is the god that i trust this morning to lead and guide my life and to control my life amen that's his characteristics when i approach god into prayer when i believe god for anything this is the god that i believe that knows all things oh my hallelujah to god that's the faith of the bride of jesus christ that's the faith that's rising up in this hour amen that's coming into maturity hallelujah hallelujah all god's word is written by inspiration brother branham speaking here in the law having a shadow there's not a contradiction in the entire bible if there is i want to see it it's nothing in there it's written that cannot there's nothing written that cannot be straightened out by the word of god if it's rightly put in its place and that's the problem without faith without revelation without god revealing it and interpreting it to you is not put in this right place and that's man and man has always done it and that's why their religion and and even in the message is in the mess that it's in because they don't let god wait upon god to interpret his word and make it plain to us we always go ahead of god we always try to go ahead but wait on the lord those who wait on god shall renew their strength amen he's the one that's in control i'm not speaking about the bride of jesus christ this morning that she can do anything she want to do she can say anything she wants to say no that's not the revelation she's under the control of the headship she's under control of the leading of the spirit of god within her she says nothing amen unless he gives it to her he puts it in her heart by faith to speak through her lips or she doesn't say nothing at all amen and our life speaks hallelujah but we never do it but we'll never do it by man's interpretation the holy spirit wrote the bible and the vibe and the holy spirit is the only one who can interpret the bible and he'll give it to us listen as we have need hallelujah why are you pulling why are you fearing why you're frightened he'll give it to us as we have need of it he knows exactly what we have need of then he say i'll supply all your needs get out of the car no thinking i you know i'll supply your knees by my my rent money or my this money and my grocery money jesus said you you have little faith to think that way you go don't don't you know that seek the kingdom of god first and his righteousness and all things shall be added freely unto you that means whether you pray about it or not that's up to you but it will be added on to you i want to focus my life my heart amen on the word of god in my life and fulfill what he wants me to fulfill more than anything my desire is to fulfill because i know i i'm not saying like paul says uh you know my i know my time is short i know my departure short but i don't you know i'm not trying to interpret that but i can tell you by prophecy by by the day that we're limited by the word of god that is being manifested in the bride our time is short here on the earth never been a day like this day amen hallelujah glory to god amen what a day we're living in we're people what an hour we're living in where people are doing what's right in their own own eyes what's that have to do with us this morning remember all the spirits that are manifested out there right you have to fight you have to overcome all these spirits out there because whether you like it or not you can't stay in these four walls and all of us together seven days a week you gotta go out there in the world you gotta face the world amen and the spirits that are out there and judges 17 6 in those days there was no king in israel but every man did what was right in their own eyes proverbs 21 2 every way of man is right in his own eyes but the lord pondereth the hearts at which was right in his own eyes proverbs 16 2 all the ways of men are clean in his own eyes but the lord weigheth the spirits second timothy 3 1 it says this no also in the last days previous prayers times shall come for man shall be lovers of their own cells covenants bolsters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affections truth breakers false accusers incontinence spice spice despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god that's them out there not the bride of jesus christ to be lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away so here he is talking about all the spirits that are manifested on the sinners out there and then right at the end he says having a form of godliness but denying the very power thereof oh my from such turn away listen this morning hallelujah when man leads their own life with their own wisdom and knowledge and you try to interpret things your own way it misleads them off the path of life people today say they don't want religion they want to be spiritual you know that's a great movement out there they don't want religion they don't want they want to be spiritual listen that spirit is here in the message too they don't want religion because they don't want to come to a church they don't want to be subject to a pastor they don't want to be subject to elders and you know but they want to be spiritual what a spirit themselves they want to lead themselves but look at how that is turning out look at society look at families governments look at all the churches look at all the walks of life and see where man leaves themselves doesn't the bible say that man will destroy the world again and job 21 13 they spent their days in wealth and in a moment down to the grave therefore they say unto god depart from us for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways listen this is an hour of complete surrender to his ways amen a total surrender in our lives the spirit of god amen in us is leading us into that kind of life as the words being spoken to us what is it speaking to you if it's not drawing you closer amen and drawing you in more and more and as you get closer to god you get more separated from this flesh and this life and you overcome the weaknesses in our lives amen isaiah 24 10 the city of confusion is broken down every house is shut up that no man come in there is a cry for wine in the streets all joy is darkened the laughter of the land is gone in the city is left desolated and the gates is smitten with destruction my is not the world today is that not prophecy happening today amen hallelujah glory to god amen i'm just gonna start preaching now amen amen it's good for brethren to dwell together in unity amen the anointing oil coming down hallelujah glory to god we get an opportunity every once in a while we got to let out amen i'm not leaving before one o'clock and if i leave after one o'clock then you just forgive me and let your grace and mercy be extended to me amen hallelujah glory to god i'm just letting you know don't throw any thoughts at me amen i don't want those thoughts being thrown at me hey when are you going to be done when are you going to be finished listen when i'm tired and i'm sitting back there or whatever i don't throw those thoughts i say brother simon whoever is up here preach what's on your heart get it out speak the word of god because i know it's life amen it's going to bring life to me i shake it off amen i shake the carnality and the unbelief off this is the lord's day oh my god amen and i'm not justifying myself amen this is in the spirit of god amen don't limit god don't tell him when it's over they were up in the upper room until [Music] god will shut my mouth he'll stop it don't worry when he's done amen alleluia glory to god thank you father living in a glare brother brad i'm talking here a glare is a mirage the sun reflecting itself through a false light and any glare of another age now i want you to listen i want you to listen because i want you to listen to what's being preached to us and see what's being revealed to you brother tim brother simon cannot place the word for you in your life the holy spirit got to place that word that's being spoken to you in your life the people always are walking in something that happened years ago the lutheran are walking in a glare luthen's glare luther sunlight was fine for his day wesley was good for his day now listen pentecost was good for its day now what is pentecost my brothers and sisters of course we know the restoration of the gifts and that but who was who was the messenger for pentecost wasn't it the seventh church aged messenger okay now here's the seven church age messenger speaking here we are going on up the ladder now we are living in another age okay we're living in another age we're going on we keep looking back we haven't we have to see that the prophet's prophecy being fulfilled in this rapture age this eternal age brother branham was the seventh church age messenger amen and remember the junction of time that happened in his life by his experience that he expressed to us he said when those seals broke amen and open up didn't he not say it became a new bible to him after all the years he's been preaching to the pentecostals he said i don't see things different anymore you know what happened there that happened with the turning and switching over there no more in the seven church age no more the seventh church age messenger amen but the eternal messenger jesus christ himself he was bride he was a manifestation of bride at that time amen just like we are today he was displaying amen in the spirit he was displaying what we would be today amen as he was displayed he was bride now he was the noob the book was open to him christ and his fullness has come to him and his portion and christ was his messenger and look at all the messages afterwards oh my i was the mighty angel a different age amen oh my that's why i'm saying i believe god said a prophet i love brother branham god knows my heart this ministry everybody believes that god sent a prophet but we're not in that day and age anymore amen i know who my god is i know who my jesus is no man touched me he touched me no man revealed anything to me he revealed it to me he keeps me every day he walks and talks with me every day it's the supernatural god the eternal messenger that is here walking with me that is changing me changing my body giving me faith on the faith on the faith oh my oh hallelujah oh fulfilling the rapture age we live in now when we get ourselves all settled down in things and we think we got it all made and our traditions all wrapped up listen i'm not talking the denominations out here i'm talking here remember so close to deceive the very elect i'm talking right here amen this is not for uh a day you know he preached against and and going beyond the camp he hit that spirit of denomination in every way go listen to that message but let me tell you that spirit is still alive spirits spirits don't die people die who operate those spirits but they don't die that's right oh my i thank god for and then let me boast i thank god for what we got here i thank god because i i tell you i would be deceived it's so close it's so religious it's so right you're taking the message and the quotes and everything oh my oh my but we're moving on search the scriptures and see what is promised and prophesied for this day see what the message has prophesied to the bride of jesus christ see what she has to fulfill see how she will be walking with him and her relationship to him and see where we're at today then we'll know where we're at when we can tell where we're standing that's the problem most people don't know where they're standing they don't know where they're at today oh i got the message i got the quotes i can do all this i can i don't mean nothing won't mean you're standing on anything unless you're standing jesus said i built the church upon revelation that is the rock that i built it upon unless you're standing on that rock revelation this morning of the word of god being interpreted for your day to you recognizing the prophecies that are being fulfilled today not yesterday i recognized the prophecies of the prophet for yesterday i recognize i thank god but i know because that is fulfilled there is something here today there's something for me here today amen thank you lord come on zeku said there's three different types of believers in every church make believer unbeliever and a real believer you know i don't know i can't i can't interpret i'm not here to interpret when that door is going to close but that door is closed and i know that for sure like i can tell by my my spiritual eyes what i can see that door is closing but when it does close it will interpret itself because then the fullness of the preaching to the loss will be manifested and nobody else will come into this revelation everybody else will be left back out and be foolish and be called foolish virgins foolish with the word of god and i i you know we know that that that is just what the word of god is we can't change that i know i i speak and i preach it because it says it that but we all know it's by predestination like we read in the scriptures by election that this comes to pass amen there are many camps there are always been camps in jesus day there was a lot of camps the pharisees and sadducees in every age there was religious camps formed to try to interpret the word hallelujah what were the camps in jesus day that came against him what did they say what did the pharisees were what were the pharisees doing they were they were keeping the law of moses weren't they they were they were so precise but by keeping that law and not having revelation amen they they they created traditions they they created their own interpretation how messiah would come they started getting a delusion in their minds and and that delusion started interpreting the scriptures the law for the day it started mixing everything up of how jesus christ would come to the earth and they and the scriptures were plain to see before them for behold the virgin shall conceive he shall come you know all the scriptures pertaining that were prophesied of jesus they were in a delusion they couldn't see it because they were looking back at the law and they even said to jesus you know who who are you joseph and mary's son are you a carpenter you see the delusion who gave you this authority who gave you this teaching they said we we we are moses disciples we know where we stand we know what we believe we're moses disciples oh my i said i believe god's not a prophet but i ain't brother brown's disciple no no no i'm jesus christ disciple amen but that was the delusion of that day then came after jesus the pagan rome denominations killed the word again amongst the people so they couldn't get faith to overcome then god sent reformers then he sent a prophet to the end to restore back again so that church can receive the holy ghost that took in life again but in the same thing is happening today in the message the same spirit that the prophet hid amongst the churches again deceiving people away from the revealed word of this hour so they cannot you know they can't receive it they can't come in jesus said you pharisees and sadducees be you dead man bones inside amen you can't come in so you don't let anybody else in and there's people here today i believe there's a few men of god that are speaking the word of god in this message but most of them are dead man bones amen they don't go in themselves they can't go in and they keep everybody else under the law under tradition oh you're saved you believe moses is law you're saved you believe the message of the hour you're saved you're going to heaven you're going in the rapture but no vindication no revelation no interpretation by the holy ghost himself in their lives no token life being on display no token life manifesting out of their lives dead hallelujah what an hour bless blessed be you bride of jesus christ you're blessed this morning without faith no understanding of the spirit and the prophet's message bringing people under a delusion in this day thinking that they're saved but have no birth no token no life these preachers can't go in so they don't let anybody else in the bride has been given a promise that it would be so close but you see the bride knows her husband and getting to know him very well as he reveals himself to her they share secrets all the time jesus said i show you things to come and it's given to you to know the mysteries of the token life but it's not given to them hallelujah what's the matter what's the matter with the age in every age the word of god is foreign to the people it's un it's too unusual god always does things in unusual ways it's unusual anyway god is is against the systematic of the world because they have gotten things the way that they think it should be god comes and he does the unusual that's the way it is today my brothers and sisters the way the words being listen let me tell you something the way the words being preached here in this ministry under this anointing of this hour which i believe is present truth ah it's unusual to a lot of people oh yeah it's unusual what what in the world is that amen well where did the prophet say that where do you find out i've had i've had it said to me amen what are you going to do argue with them debate with them amen it's like jesus said amen how can brother brown went to the person how you know what i smite your blind he said how can i split spite me by he says he said how can i sweat you blind when you're already blind blind leading the blind blind laocia the prophet cried out in the spirit blind laocia blindness coming not only out in the world but right here in the message blindness coming over darkness the spirit of death coming over but not to the bride of jesus christ not to the bride of jesus christ she's a light in the darkness and she's starting to shine brighter and brighter and brighter as that day approaches oh satan try to stop her you can't stop her if god before us who can be against us what can be against us amen oh i hide behind my big brother hey man like brother brown says look who's behind me saying that he knows who's behind me he's know who's in me he knew he knows who's speaking oh yeah amen now if joseph would have just looked back in the scriptures the prophet said there would be a virgin it would only it would it it was only god interpreting his word but it was unusual to them how could god this virgin how can this virgin conceive he was honest he's thought he's joseph was honest he sought god he sought god about it and when god spoke to him in a dream and said joseph thou sent a day of fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy spirit oh joseph many joseph today why don't you go back in the scriptures why don't you look back in the scriptures and see what's prophesied of today and then you will see this unusual thing that you see moving in the bride and speaking through the bride that is prophesied of her in this day in this hour if he only went back and looked into the scriptures and see what was prophesied why didn't he go back think about it why did he go back he was a righteous man he was a good man but god had to speak to him in a dream and said joseph this is of the holy ghost if it only went back in the scriptures and see what's prophesy asserts the scriptures my brothers and sisters search these things out seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open unto you that is our that is our commission that is our our our our motive and our drive and our intentions in our life go back into the word and see what's prophesied in this day and see what has to be fulfilled and when the virgin mary when the angel gabriel met her and told her that she was going to have a baby without knowing a man brown says there's never been she never learned upon her own understanding she never leaned upon her own understanding that woman could not have a baby without having a husband she didn't lean upon that but she said behold hands made of the lord feed unto me according to thy word amen hallelujah hallelujah how am i going to do it and when is it going to be done how's it going to happen how is it going to take place the holy ghost shall overshadow thee and that holy thing that is born of thee shall be called the son of god a bride of jesus christ how is going to be done unto me how are these prophecies for this last day going to be done unto me you as an individual in your own heart say like mary said the angel said to mary the holy ghost shall overshadow you the holy ghost shall overshadow me how am i going to overcome how am i going to overcome this flesh how am i going to overcome this carnal mind how am i going to overcome the things i need to overcome to see that word come the holy ghost shall overshadow me amen and bring forth the baby the son of god in my life bring forth the prophecies that he promised me my portion of faith i will overcome i am an overcomer i will be victorious i will end strong amen the bride will end strong she will end victorious she's going to leave here with great substance amen great substance she's going to leave here with she's not going to leave here uh all beaten up and all down and out no way she's going to be victorious why because brother tim says sorry the other one no the word said so oh my the greatest time when jesus was on the cross was the greatest victory of all time of all history was the greatest victory when he was on the cross triumph oh my hallelujah it's time for the bride to rise up and get a grip on the word for this day and she and her husband are one in the same she is part of him she recognizes the intellectual educated people who claim to know the way and know the scriptures and all the quotes and can tie them together and make you think you know nothing that only that only they know the way yes so many camps just like the pharisees and sashi's what did jesus say to them you cut jesus where did you come from amen hallelujah glory to god thank you lord i already spoke on that amen romans 10 1 brethren my heart's desire and prayer to god for israel that they might be saved for i bear the record that they have a zeal of god but not according to knowledge for they being ignorant of god's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of god today this scripture is fulfilled matthew 16 17 and jesus answered and said unto them blessed thou simon blair jonah flesh and blood has not revealed it to you upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it now i give you the keys of of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind shall be bound in earth whatever thou shall loose shall be loosed in heaven we have those keys that key of faith the key of david this morning the key of revelation to start binding amen where brother brown says you speak the word and create the world your own world and you go live on it what world is he talking about that world of uh that token life world that world that life that walks behind the inner veil amen and you speak that word of god in your life you speak to areas you bind them and you believe amen hallelujah so that they may loose but while a true believer is the revelation of god being revealed in the age we're living in my words are spirit and life it's god in word form and can only be interpreted by himself the human mind cannot comprehend and interpret god's mind how can a little human mind interpret the infinite mind when we can even interpret one another's mind and notice to whom he revealed it and he also designed that he can hide himself in the scriptures to the smartest theologian there is he can just hide himself set right there in the scriptures and you look all day long and never see it look a lifetime and never see it he can just hide himself sitting there now please everywheres let this soak in that god in the word can hide himself so in the word that there isn't a theologian or school in the world that could ever find him there yet he is sitting right there this day this scripture is fulfilled hallelujah brother bran was speaking here the importance of revelation to a true believer it's everything we know that everything in him was attributes it was the attributes to be god he was attribute he had attributes to be father son savior healer all these attributes were in him these things that has unfolded since the beginning of time are just his attributes being made manifest what i what i mean attributes was his thoughts a word expressed is his thoughts and now remember you christians you were in his thoughts before the world was my my my what's taking place here and you are the manifestation of his thinking that makes you his subjects and the whole thing is god himself materializing himself tangible so that he could be handled seen and known by his bride i was speaking here not long ago in a meeting and somebody said to me brother branham you have the wrong interpretation you don't interpret that right now you go to the methodists and they say the baptists don't interpret it right you go to the baptist and the pentecostals don't interpret a right you go to the pentecostals they say the oneness don't it the one to say the assemblies don't each of them say they don't but god is his own interpreter he don't need anybody to interpret him how can we interpret him think about it the the you know when your eyes are open to see how can how can we interpret god my my my ma this this can't be touched by man's hands you know brother i'm seeing that serpent and he tried to cut the head off that serpent but he's seen that serpent sneaking in that spirit of denomination that spirit of man sneaking into the message amen man trying to interpret god will make his word plain he always makes his word plain he always will confirm his word by manifesting his word look for the manifestation look for the vindication to build your faith my brothers and sisters look in the scriptures and see what has been spoken what you've been hearing go back and search the scriptures what is going to give you faith and perfect faith and let your faith grow is when you can identify what's being spoken and god interpreted it bringing it to pass hallelujah amen hallelujah glory to god i'm going to skip over some things here i want to get to the the end here there's a lot of things spoken about the bride of jesus christ and i want to make sure i get get that in hallelujah amen we need to surrender to the hugh we we need to surrender the human part of us to the god part the word can interpret the portion of the word of faith in us you see there's a human part of us which is most of us and then there's a god part of us you see the fullness of the godhead dwelt in jesus christ he didn't bypass his theophany amen he was the fullness of god yes he was human but not sinful human like we are but we are sinful human there's a part of us that are still sinful human which we preach we call the flesh but also don't emphasize on that there's a god part of us there's a faith part of us inside amen hallelujah that's that's the part that's bringing this human part under subjection that part is overcoming this part amen all the doubt all the fear that torment people in this part the god part is overcoming it and we gotta let the god part we gotta surrender to the god part the revelation inside of us amen overcome this wow that was simple brother tim no it's not simple oh man there's a lot of revelation behind that statement individually to each and every one of you because we're all individuals we all have different battles all different struggles all different everything every circumstance every condition around our lives amen even in our own families our own marriages our own kids everything is different but we still gotta let the god part amen take over the human part of us let his word be exalted amen above everything oh my god you can do it be prophesied yes you're going to see we're going to get to it you're going to see where you're at in the word romans 7 23 but i see another law in my members working against me paul's talking about bringing me under captivity to the law of sin which is in my members he kills oh wretched man that i am my he's seen it real clear oh wretched man that i am here's a prophet of god paul signs wonders what a life what a life you know the life he goes oh wretched man that i am but he said thank god hallelujah through jesus christ my lord through that new birth amen i got victory oh my i got victory hallelujah that means more to you than you perhaps think this morning you don't even realize sometimes how much bondage that you're in through the flesh how it's holding you and trapping you and holding you back but if you can claim the word and look in the scriptures and ask god for faith give me faith father that i got victory over this wretched man hallelujah because entering behind the inner veil by the third pull to an individual cannot be carnally impersonated people are trying to live act dress talk like the prophet did or someone else who is living the third pole manifestation of perfect faith let me tell you my brothers and sisters that ain't gonna work you wanna there's i always thought it was weird to me though i didn't know much but when i seen people walking around forgive me forgive me everybody forgive me but walking around with boots like the prophet buckles like the prophet had like the prophet going like the profit i like the profit i eat what profit eats i do this like the profit everything like the profit i mean i go what the world is on like i don't got much brains as it is but i know that there's something wrong there hallelujah glory to god amen that's not what i want i never wanted that from the beginning the first time i came and i heard the word of god in the upper room amen where that light was revealed to me and was spoken to me and it changed my life it was jesus christ then it is jesus christ now i know no man can do it but i know god works through man yes sir oh my it was a light reflecting amen and it was my time it was my appointed time to come and see the light and be awakened by the seed of god amen and ever since that day yes it's been hard it's been battles it's been struggles there's been ups and there's been downs well i'm here today in victory i'm walking and pressing on by the grace of god and i'm overcoming i'm overcoming why because i don't care how i feel when i wake up in the morning how this body feels i know about body feeling bad they're getting old amen but i'm overcoming the spirit of god is raising the standard in me amen because why i'm going right to the rapture i'm going right to the resurrection this seed of god is pulling me it's pulling me it's pulling me forward oh my regardless of the elements regardless of what the government's what everything is going on in my family my life my flesh my human part of me something inside of me is pulling me it's glory to god rejoice in that rejoice in him glory to god he is so good to us so good to us oh my his love is beyond comprehending it's so deep it's so wide it's so thick i can't get around it oh and i think i should be gone when i think i should be lost here he comes again here he cuts again and raises the standard amen oh my when the enemy comes in as a flood oh god god raises the standard and comes with his word and what word the word inside of me what can he come with me but might the word that's inside of me and he reveals it to me makes it more real to me what real who i who i am who i raised up for what i'm raised up for oh my that's okay that's faith it's individual fear the husband cannot give it to the wife the wife can't give it to the husband we can't give it to our children but we can apply the life and live that life of that token on display amen to one another amen we can get that life with that token manifested in our life surrendered in our lives and we can apply the token to our wives our husbands and they'll be sanctified our children that's what we can do and that's what we should do amen i'm not saying your children are going to be saved i'm not saying they're not i'm not saying your children are going into rapture i'm not saying that or not and he doesn't say it he doesn't say it anywheres either he says apply the token get the token in your life get the token on display in your own life first parents get it in your life surrender your life to god get away from this bride pride stuff see it's the unwritten word as we've been hearing the secrets it's the word but it's not written like paul said i was caught up into the heavens i seen and i heard things i could not utter with human voice or understanding that's what it is revealed to the bride when she enters into the king's chamber where the shekinah glory is and the world is shut out of her heart is shut out of her mind the only voice that the bride hears is the voice of her husband whispering secrets of love all day long to her oh my how can how can you know brother so-and-so whatever myself you want to say myself pastor simon be such joyful happy such on top of the mountain because the our beloved is whispering secrets of love all day long that's what it is my brothers and sisters it's not coming it's here it's manifesting we sing the song it's manifest in time the group the fruits are on the vine behold the lovely one is coming in plain view oh yes he's in plain view amen have you got eyes to see amen hallelujah amen let's let's let's move it down here i got i still got a half an hour hallelujah lord i prayed lord slow down the time i think he's slowing down the time amen hallelujah time shall be no more amen hallelujah glory to god oh jesus thank you lord amen he deals he deals with everybody differently amen hallelujah in the high calling brother branham said some will be it will not be able to act or live or speak like other christians are allowed to for he will put a jealous love over you and correct you with a hard testing and try you if you don't line up why because god is an interpreting god is interpreting the part of himself in you that is why every seed shall bring forth of its own kind isaiah 55 11 so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth amen it's already gone out of his mouth amen to this day in this hour it's already been prophesied the bride's word has already gone out you have already been released you have already been spoken in this hour oh my and gone forth out of my mouth and it shall not there it is again it shall not return unto me void but it will accomplish what is pleased what which which i please and it will prosper the thing i will send it that's god speaking how can i be so confident and perfect fake brother brahms's perfect faith gives you confidence gives you confidence in where you're standing why on his word he spoke it he said it stop relying on yourself stop relying on your own abilities stop trying to interpret things for yourself amen look in the scriptures and see what's prophesied you heard this all this stuff millions of times over and over but here look and see what's prophesied look and see what he has said i look to that when it's hard when i look to the i looked at that when i can't see in front of me i look to that when i don't know what the future holds i look to that and it speaks to me and then i have faith in my god the god inside of me amen this token life revelation pulls us out of a carnal life and into a spiritual life out of the old ways and reveals a new way we are new creatures in christ all things have passed away in order for new things to come in and let go of the old life notice we are not just to just come together and talk about the message i love this quote now we're going to start getting into some prophecies here for the bride and what's taking place to come together and just talk about the message which is going on we're to get in to it get under the blood now come now not come and say you know moses told us go into fellowship i'm going to break it down for you go into fellowship amen come together you know brother brown said brother adam said brother adam said so what he's saying here and you're going to see what he's saying here what i'm saying you know moses told us this the messenger he s he said he told us that this should that we should have the blood what do you think about this boys what do you think about this believers what do you think about this brothers and sisters what do you think about all these quotes what do you think about this i've heard it so many times what do you think about this what do you think about that what do you think about this boys that wasn't it that wasn't it get the lamb kill it get the blood up there we can come and sit and agree with the word and everything else but don't have that token what good does it do no good get beneath it it was not responsible for anyone out of under the blood and he is not responsible for anybody today out from under the token the whole family is only safe when you get under the token and the token was displayed the entire family do you believe that today we ought to remember that people get under the blood get the token on display and even our children speaking in the token message hallelujah glory to god the answer lies in the position of the key got two pages left almost done lies in the position of the key it's not in his hand is not worn around his neck it's not it's not placed in his hand or an other man's hands or the verse could not be saying that he alone has the key of has the key for he alone opens and shuts and no man opens has the right no man has the right but jesus himself isn't that right but where is the key is on his shoulders but what does shoulders have to do with it read isaiah 9 6 and the government shall be upon his shoulders but what does this mean the answer is this the phrase government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the east when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulder signifying that not only is she under his dominion that she has transferred her rights to him that he is head but also that he bears the responsibility and care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right or responsibility to that beloved is the key of david god being sovereign for knew by his divine exactly who would be in his bride he chose her he did not she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her he washed her in his blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and him alone she is wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation he is her head for christ is the head of the church as sarah called abraham lord even so the bride is happy to be lord call him lord he speaks and she obeys for that is her delight now he has cried out in the last age you have the word you have more bibles than ever but you are not doing anything except dividing and hacking it into pieces taking what you want and leaving out what you don't want you are not interested in the living it but debating it that's over for the bribe that's over she doesn't walk there anymore other people walk there but she doesn't walk there hallelujah the people who took revelation from god became the living epistles read of all men all men in their generation there it is again another people in the land under their their message their eternal message will be the final voice in the final age the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god now let me tell you something my brothers and sisters i'm just that's just me right the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god the message is no longer the mouthpiece of god no more wow okay let's read it is its own mouthpiece so god is turning on it he will speak through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in the bride yes it is for this i say in the last chapter of revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride the spirit and the bride in this day say come once more the world will hear directly from god through the bride of jesus christ let us stand musicians come hallelujah glory to god thank you lord jesus they want a great awakening they're crying believing there will there will be a great awakening there are good people in the message but they have not recognized the awakening of the bride being a christian they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done that's what's making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen but they see they're looking for it way off in the future to come when it's already happening right now before you this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears hallelujah the bride has been chosen it's getting her ready now the revival is over there's no more revival spirit two hours of service everybody's complaining and so there's just gleaning abraham had to sweat it out until he found character that's what the spirit of god is doing now and when he found character the next thing was prepare her to meet the bridegroom you remember when he found her in the evening time the evening light but the spiritual royal seed of abraham which believes every word of god there is a confirmation of a living resurrected jesus christ in them the church goes on through the tribulation period but not the bride the message goes on through the tribulation period but not the bride wow listen this isn't an hour this isn't an hour i know where i stand i know what revelation i've been receiving amen let god be his own interpreter let god discern in the thoughts and intense discern the spirits of the day we need discernment more than any other days today to discern the word and it's given to her the bride of jesus christ to discern the word just like jesus deserved his day just like brother branham deserved his day the bride deserves this day amen and what's being fulfilled in this hour hallelujah glory to god amen hallelujah and a man that once walks into god and that veil drops behind him shutting off the things of the world he's in the presence of god eating manna what a beautiful picture it is today of a consecrated life who has entered into christ dead to the things of the world hid away with god that veil drops down around her all things of the world are shut out there's where the shekinah glory where the light that halo that ball of fire that comes in behind the altar and went down and settled on the mercy seat where the blood was there and there that light lit up the room lit up the room i believe you are that light that's lighting up the room today hallelujah amen glory to god thank you jesus amen thank you father lord as we heard your word oh god god is his own interpreter you've always interpret your word right from the beginning of time lord jesus the lord has never been man when man tries to interpret it it always messes up brings religions and this day is no different than brother branham's day lord your prophet father oh message it's a message father but didn't your prophet speak the prophecies of the bride that what she would be how she would come forth how she would be peculiar how she would be different strange amongst the people lord well here it is been 50 or 60 years now lord since your prophet left the scene and the message was left to us lord and it took that long lord jesus that amount of time to produce the same things the same things re occurring because what what can what can what can change lord it was fulfilled in your day jesus you came into the world and that was what you came into and you had to bring forth the word of god and call your people the prophet came into the world and here we was again denominations lord and here it is again the bride after 50 60 years now the message has formed camps has forms interpretations oh everybody has an interpretation everybody has the truth the way the light that the prophet had lord but here it is again father that you are interpreting your own word again in this day and you are making it plain to a people that you call the bride that you have chosen predestinated in this hour and lord she is maturing come into that place of maturity where she can come and stand with with perfect faith with confidence in in in the word in her position lord and and speak the word oh god not not speak fables not speak emotion not speak out of the flesh but speak by faith lord speak by revelation because she knows what you want done with the word in her life lord you know she knows where you want her to be led and directed the word is directing her lord god oh bless her this morning wherever she is father around the world lord maybe under pressure persecution wherever she is all the true ministers of god give them faith give them strength this morning to stand against once again in this hour lord these spirits that have creeped in lord men that are creeped in ungodly men denying the truth denying the power lord give strength to the man of god lord to stand strong continue to bless our pastor lord the man of god here lord continue to give him strength that he may stand strong that he may be separated lord unto you and you alone lord they may preach the gospel right to the end lord preach the truth right to the end lord and father we'll fail not to give you the honor and glory and praise in jesus precious name we pray hallelujah god bless your saints amen rejoice thank you brother anthony god bless you [Music] if [Music] yes [Music] for yourself [Music] from this body [Music] [Music]
