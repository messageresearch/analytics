god the praise that we all recognize who we are in jesus christ may the lord bless you uh we today will approach the scripture of matthew chapter 24. matthew chapter 24 reading from verse 36 to 51 it's a little lengthy reading but will give us some foundations and background for the word of god amen hallelujah brother tim can you come up here and read a part of it for me please matthew 24. it's all right you don't need your i have the words here so it'll be a blessing for us all read to about 42. right amen but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only but as the days of noah were so shall also the the coming of the son of man be for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating drinking marion and given in marriage until the day that noe entered into the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be then shall two be in the field and one shall be taken and the other left two woman shall be grinding at the mill and one shall be taken and the other left watch therefore for ye know not what our your lord doeth come hallelujah brother gabriel would you come read the rest of it thank you brother temple praise the lord reading from this verse thank you jesus but note this that if the good man of the house had known in what watch the thief that will come he will have watched and will not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be also ready for in as an hour as he think not the son of man cometh who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord had made the ruler of his household to give them meat in due season blessed is the servant who is lord when he cometh shall find so doing thank you jesus praise god hallelujah let us pray gracious heavenly father we thank thee so much for the reading of the word and we ask your divine blessing upon us as we consider these things for your glory and honor we ask it amen god bless you please be seated and i continue the rest of that scripture verily i say unto you that you sh he shall make him ruler over all of his word all of his goods but if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord delayed his coming and shall begin to smite his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of and shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites there shall be weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth weeping and gnashing of teeth amen god bless that word to our hearts now if you'll notice in this scripture i'm speaking on the topic of quickened to see his coming now jesus did not say we will not know the year nor the month nor the week but he says no man know it the hour in which the son of man comes and i'm saying to you here by the word of god uh we are in the season and we are quickened to see recognize be aware and sensitive to the season in which we are living the same quickening power from the rising of the sun of god present was represented as we spoke on last week and both of these prophets of elijah and elisha amen one representing the dead that dies and sleeps in the grave and the other representing the living saints that are caught up in the presence of the living god these are the two wings of the old and new testament and of course they also represent the the church of this last day the living saints and the dead saints of the church of this day and this is what i want you to see praise god and i want you to know as the scripture said the prophet says here that the quickening power that was back there still lives today do you believe that now remember now he says remember he repeats remember now remember you are quickened to see these things amen these things that are in other words are going on right now you're quickened to see and that's where the thought comes from god's holy spirit has quickened us to see these things now watch the quickening power but watch it for this day what is the action of that quickening power what does it do what is it supposed to accomplish in this day in which we are living and remember he says we are quickened by that spirit hallelujah praise the lord now you know under the first and second polls the anointing the holy ghost the quickening power came upon them and they're quickened by the holy ghost to heal the sick they were quickened to cast out devils they were quicker than my friends to even see visions and dreams and all these things quickened to even raise the dead many men were so anointed that god used them to raise the dead manifest great gifts and great works but under the third pull now when they are looking for greater works we are quickened to see the world making itself manifestated manifest manifested and the interpretation of god in this hour praise be to god because uh this is how the prophet says it back there but you gotta understand what he's saying he says when god said let there be light and the light appeared that was the interpretation hallelujah now he's just talking about that but he's left it to you now to see at evening time it shall be light again praise god and the manifestation is the interpretation for the hour praise be to god think of our lord what he said then think of paul of what he said what the father showed me i held nothing back and in these last days when we see the quickening power upon us he even gave them power to see the sick heel to seeing the quickening power working amongst them like it was them to bring visions to raise the dead to make the sick well you see that quickening power but it comes now to make you see hallelujah all the other things are going to take place but first of all you it comes to make you see the coming of the lord amen now just before going further you know we will see his coming but many who are expecting him what she is coming just like it was at his first coming the rabbis that all the wise men they were watching waiting for his coming but yet when he came only elected pre-destinated group were allowed to really recognize see and understand the coming of the lord oh hallelujah now o praise god now you see john the revelator was so filled with the quickening power remember john takes the bride that he when he stood up there he was anointed to see the very end from the beginning or in other words from beginning to end praise god and so john being a type of the bride that same quickening power comes upon the bride then she also is anointed to see the word running from beyond the foundations right back through the bible right back through time right back into eternity by the quickening power of the holy spirit striking the soul of that believer amen don't you see it what it did then to john elijah isaiah was so full of that quickening power he stood up and prophesied about the millennial kingdom oh praise god that quickening power raised up christ from the dead oh my and that quickening pearl dwells in you it dwells in you he says then he repeats it dwells in your mortal body not when you're dead but it dwells now while you're living it's dwelling in you praise god while you're alive the quickening pours in you oh my remember this what we've seen in this day the quickening power has come to us to do what open the seven seals see what was that the intelligence of a man no that was the that was the quickening power of course we know the mind the thoughts of god now being made manifest amen see the quickening power of god caused the world to testify to it by taking that picture you see there from the natural eye he showed them that he is here praise god you see we see his coming they're looking for him to still to come but he's already here by time that coming they're thinking of happens and they can visibly see it's done taking place because that's just a consummation of everything and the bright is gone it's too late then praise god what we we're seeing now and we're seeing the progress of it until it comes to the event building itself up by the grace of the living god hallelujah amen remember it's our lord that was up there hallelujah that cloud it was the lord he said up there he is the one who opened the seals he is those seals for the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seals that was opened what is the opening of the seals then revealing jesus christ hallelujah not some of him but all of him revealing christ to the true believer is revealed praise the name of the lord and the very seven angels you seen there they represented the seven churches and it completed all of it all seven angels appeared which was revealing to us all the seven churches are over because all seven of the angels appeared he said showing that representing the seven churches are now all completed amen but we could not see it then but that's what it is the seven ages are completed hallelujah the quickening it's the quickening power that lets us see his coming praise god hallelujah quickening power that snatched us from death into life praise god hallelujah paul said we've been snatched like a brand from the burning in other words like a twig that's on fire but before it could be burnt up a hand snatches it and bring and knocks out the fire and that's the way we were everyone headed to hell and before you got there he grabbed you and knocked the fire off amen hallelujah delivered from guests into life for the glory of god hallelujah amen oh yes it's that same quickening power that gives you discernment hallelujah discernment hallelujah not just and i'm speaking now not just to heal the sick or discern the things uh as we saw in brother branham's ministry back there but listen what the word says but now to discern what's wrong with you and what to do about it to discern what you have done what kind of life you live and what you ought not to have done and also now what you should do amen you see the quickening power comes to make us aware of all those things that we could walk under that power of the holy spirit the quickening power of the holy spirit to know how to live and what to do oh my quickening power does all these things and our lord jesus was so full of that quickening power he was all of it all of it together he says he was he said you destroyed this body amen and i'll raise it up in three days talk about confidence in that quickening power that was in him he's telling us you better have confidence in the quickening power in you now amen praise god hallelujah amen remember remember this he said destroy this body this temple this house i'm living in destroy it that's all that can destroy anyway amen and i'll raise it up i'll bring it up in three three days now you understand that this is not uh what was said but i'm telling you here this is speaking prophecy hallelujah because this same body we were still in him and he's telling them that if you destroy this body i'll raise it up in three days and we were still in him but now we are separated from him it took luther wesley pentecost to raise that body back up here again under the anointing of the holy spirit hallelujah he has done it again for the glory of god let's give him praise and honor right now behold the mighty conqueror behold him in plain view praise god forevermore oh my yes sir and remember he also said i will not suffer my holy one to see corruption neither will i leave his soul in hell he knowed what it would do he not that quickening power would not let one cell become corrupt hallelujah i don't care what you've done before you come in contact with the word of god you're quickened to see the coming of the lord and the fires of god so quickens you no corruption that might have been your life in your soul not one will be corrupt not one of joseph's bones are going to be left in egypt not one bloodshed hallelujah raised up by the power of god hallelujah the bride raised up hallelujah after jesus had the three days he was resurrected is that right after he was resurrected you know what happened next he walked with the disciples for a while and then he ascended now the bride has gone through her resurrection spiritually which i told you was in a process to an event hallelujah now that the process is coming to an end what is the next thing to happen the bride's ascension by rapture by the word of god raised up in a rapture to go into the presence of the living god hallelujah amen now you see when he said destroy this temple i'll bring it back in three days why that was prophecy hallelujah the word of god it cannot fail the same prophecy and word of god that said he'll raise him up hallelujah he'll raise horror we are already raised with him hallelujah praise god no wonder he said fear not the spirit that is that was in him is now in us and is here to quicken our mortal body amen fear not friends the sun is up shining upon us oh praise god i'm so glad the sun is shining here today shining outside shining inside we praise god give him glory and it quickens our mortal bodies hallelujah amen now what do we see in the great transfiguration there back there i'm speaking on quicken to see his coming the coming praise the lord of god now we look at the transfiguration what do we see represented there again we see there in type the saints that are raptured elijah was standing there and moses was standing there one representing the living saints and the other the dead saints oh my but remember though living or whether one had died they both had in them that quickening power they both had the seed they both had the germ the gene well they both had it didn't matter whether their humans said they're dead but it didn't matter if they were living or dead the quickening power abides it can't be taken away from you it can't be carried anyway from you because uh you are caught up in this great mystery oh look whether one died and the other didn't die they're all there anyhow look what we are now seeing in these last days amen by the quickening power the same thing that he promised to take place and certainly it's here praise god there on monk transfiguration even though they knew amen well these things praise god see it wasn't them going around now he's talking to about them but he's talking to us moses saying oh see who i am i'm up on the mount of transfiguration i'm going to be raptured i'm i'm in the bride i'm going up in the first resurrection see moses didn't go around saying see who i am when them disciples got it they didn't go around saying see who i am see who i am oh my they weren't concerned about that they wanted to see jesus glorified jesus in them glorified oh so it is today let us not try to be some big person can you say amen we don't care what these people say about us our name is nothing don't mean nothing to them right now there is thousands of johns in this world so what is your name your natural name oh mr so-and-so mr so-and-so you know that's just a human pomposity you see it's not our life and it's not our name this is not about our name or about our life our life is just a messed up bunch of everything else that he had to wash and clean by his blood our name don't mean nothing it's his name it's his life his life in us makes the difference it's his power amen this only thing we want and we love to do is to see him glorified amen it's not what you love to do is not what you want to see through your life oh praise god how can it be you see he is being glorified in us now by his presence by his resurrection that is in us i i i i spoke how i was thinking but the words here are he is glorified in us by his resurrection that is in us amen praise god so that resurrection in us glorifies him praise god see he is represented again as he was he is represented today but not in the one member body the headship he is represented again son of man then and son of man are real again as we have said over and over but now in the form of a bride and they are missing it because through tradition they're looking back and looking for that one back there but that was only the manifestation of the head while we were stealing him but he's paid the price of our redemption christ eternal has released us from his side as much as eve came from adam's side and our souls are here represented in human bodies eternity trapped in time until the spirit of the living god sets you free from this prison house that we're living in oh praise god forevermore hallelujah oh my see did you get that our desire is not to be glorified can you say amen i want you to get you to uh agree with that that's being said that you don't want to be seen you don't you want him to be glorified because you realize that you are nothing you are only a predestinated prepared vessel from the for the foundation of the world that the quickening power could come to in this age and use for this age to display himself to manifest himself his word and the manifestation is the interpretation [Music] you see that is why our desire is not to be here to boost up some church you see we are not here just to make some great big sunday school nothing wrong with that but that's not our purpose here amen we are not here trying to bring thousands in or to do it by tying them bringing them in or to push them in we are not here to offer them uh you know picnic parties you're attracting them by picnic parties rather than what is the attraction on the mountain amen or to bring them in by bringing stars amen giving them a badge with a star on it that's one and bringing in high credibility people in this world bring in the mayor bringing the this the governor the president bringing this great star in hollywood and bring them in for the attraction amen some football player or something else like the other right praise god you see or something else like that give them some kind of button or whatever it's not how we desire our desire is to see jesus glorified hallelujah not with self-pride but in us in our lives every day to prove he's not dead but he is alive and now living in us praise god hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord oh he says don't you see that's why i say if i can get myself out of the way where the people cannot when william branham the people cannot think of him or he isn't sought off anymore amen i want to get myself out of the way that you not even thought of till we can see jesus glorified among us you see and he repeats i want you to see him recognize him not me not william branham you know he's a prophet you know god sent him to the 20th century but it's not me i want you to recognize i want you to recognize him praise be to god that's our desire that gives us the quick new power that gives us the joy to know that we are with him hallelujah remember this bought flesh and bone of him hallelujah the two shall be what flesh your flesh bone of bone praise god he's just referring to you gonna you're natural but your soul is word of word and your flesh you know your flesh now you're his flesh now that he's able to operate through even you don't have to think about that because he's going to do it it's not you going around trying to be a christian or trying to manifest christ i'm going to be perfect like jesus i'm gonna do no you of course want to do that but you realize that does not lie in you he has to do it through you amen and that's why i say in a natural way brethren all we have to be like brother branham said it too he says just go out and be a christian just just live your normal life he says be humble be sincere be reverent and god will bless you he'll just work through you even when you're not thinking about it god's spirit will work through you hallelujah being the bride of christ seeing those same vindicated methods and by that proving in us that he is now risen from the dead by his action in you and through you he has proven to the world he's not dead i'm alive because look i'm hearing this man look i'm in here not woman look i'm in here over there in that child look i'm here there he's proving to them hallelujah oh praise god so we are flesh of his flesh for him to use and manifest himself true you see god is his own interpreter you say brother simon is a wonderful coach you know you should give me every quote where you got it from and this and that well i'm preaching to believers and when you're speaking to believers you don't have to prove every sentence you say because they're part of the same truth is that right yes you don't have to prove it you see and not only that not only are they believers and you don't have to actually prove it but also i'm no more feeding babies that i have to give you every chapter force so that you know exactly where it's coming from is that in the bible is that in the uh is that brother bran said that this is that over here is that over there i'm not feeding babies is that right so when i say something when it catches your thought your heart then you go find that food because there's spiritual food that's been provided for you in your season there's food in the storehouse for you to find praise god but no the days are gone for man or papa to break the spoon with the food and open your mouth and then they're gonna put it in and they say hallelujah amen praise god no no no that time has passed this is no spoon feeding time this is for you now like a little eagle you swoop him down to pick up your fresh meat of the word of god hallelujah fresh kill for the day under the quick new power and inspiration of the holy spirit praise peter god hallelujah amen you see god is his own interpreter and back in the beginning when he said let there be light there was light and that light was the interpretation of his word and when god does that in any age any time and it's manifested you see the manifestation is god's interpretation of his word when he said let there be light that light had to be in his thinking before light could spring up into the skies see and when it did come forth that's the interpretation of his thinking that was back there praise god hallelujah nobody has to interpret that for him god said it and when he speaks and what he speaks is manifested then that is the interpretation of his word hallelujah see oh my my god don't you understand in the beginning that happened in genesis but he also allotted his word to each age right from the beginning right to the end amen amen in other words he said let there be light in every age whether it be on the luther justification that was the light for that day but that was just the sun coming up in the morning and then let there be light in the next age the sun get a little brighter every light then it's getting brighter and then at evening time it shall be light again oh praise peter god and the manifestation when the prophet said don't you understand it the evening lights have come it is a fact that god and christ are one in other words he started to see some people catching the word amen god and christ are one hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord amen just a moment praise god hallelujah thank you lord jesus how wonderful to know friends that he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah oh praise god it is god himself doing his own interpretation right god and you and me doing his own interpretation every verse of the scripture whether it be what is faith what is patience what is love what is this you see but they are thinking they might even think something wrong with you because they don't know what really is love so when the spirit manifests love through you they might think it's it's even hatred they might even think it's crazy you might think it's nonsense when they see patients they said oh this guy something is wrong with him when they see those virtues they see it from the human standpoint of how human beings will approach that or what they think it is but when it is interpreted through you sometimes it surprises you yourself hallelujah because god is doing his own interpretation and he don't need no anybody to interpret it for him he interprets himself by manifesting what he promised that he would do for when he said from isaiah a virgin shall conceive hallelujah and i've said it to you before i say it again the moment he said let every light said he he already saw that light it was in his thinking a virgin will conceive that virgin wasn't mistaken he knew exactly which one in the billions that were gonna comport this one he knew already wasn't mistaken when he says and i generally use this term i use a general term when he says there gonna be a bride in the last day son of man will be revealed in the last day there's gonna appear people in the last day then he had to have the thought back in his mind what is going on now is the manifestation of those thoughts and the manifestation of those thoughts is the word interpreting its own self through you and me flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones hallelujah amen you see oh my they didn't think it but god said it and she did it praise god who the believer virgins can bring for the child but god said it and he said when god said it she just did it hallelujah you see but when she did it the church of that day was too blind to see it see and they were blind be they couldn't see because they had their own ideas see they had a different it come a different way than what they were expecting and this is what blinds the people today when you talk about the resurrection you see their thoughts are um like sunglasses if your glasses is clear you're seeing clearly but then if they put some nice glaze and tell you it will keep the sun out of your eyes and so on and you put on the darkness on the shades right like that then you can't see and the darker they make it you can't see true at all and so they put so much uh ideas in the thoughts of the people that they're thinking of of what the word should say is being colored by these years of theology uh church systems and what they taught you and what they tell you what you accepted the ideas that you tried to live by and so on like that we've been colored by it is that right praise god like you know one time i had to tell somebody after i made a mistake and i said to this person i said i said uh uh you understand and this was actually the the um the superintendent of uh south america there of the whole assembly of god and we were talking or something like that and i said something to him and i said oh i'm sorry i shouldn't have said that you see i i am influenced i'm still influenced by the environment that i've lived in and on and the way what i'm coming out of i still have some of that influence on me so i said have patience with me the lord is still working and he's going to take all of those things off and there's nothing one of us is not in that condition here right now the holy spirit has to continue to work on us the quickening power of the living god has to swirl around this place into every life every cranny every crook of every heart uncleanness by the holy spirit that's not the work of man that's the work of a psychiatrist that's not the work of a preacher man that's the work of the holy ghost himself it's between you and god between me and god in the little chamber of the heart the little room that's where he meets you and you have a conference with him and he cleans us up every day praise god by divine grace amen praise god you see you understand now the edition church age why jesus said jesus did not say no man would know the year no man would know the month or even the week in which his coming was to be completed i want to understand that what i was teaching on you before that the coming started from the time that he come on the earth that was the beginning of his comment right that was his coming because he expected messiah to come jesus to come emmanuel to come and he came that was just the beginning of his comment and he's been coming down through the ages that's the condescension right that's the condescension coming down to us till this last age see my but now he's coming to be completed praise god so here he doesn't explain it but he's letting you know it's a whole process going on and then the thing is going to come to an end right it's going to be completed the edition church age and so he comes first you know when he comes to redeem his bride he comes second as a rapture to take his bride he comes third with his bride as king and queen with her amen oh my oh that's what many but you see that coming is what many people are expecting to be the coming of the lord when the real comment already took place and he's coming back now with her that is what they're looking for as the coming of the lord listen i think as i go on here praise god i'm preaching and at the same time i'm teaching you understand that's why i'm speeding up and then you finally slow down at the same time now you see that's what many people are expecting to be the coming of the lord but when he comes this time hardly none but those who are ready will even know when he comes they'll just be be an actions of the people they wouldn't know what even happened to them they'll just be caught away in a moment that they just come up missing in the rest of the world they themselves don't even know what happened but in a moment they are just caught up and come up missing changed in a moment in the crinkling of an eye oh my you see a misinterpretation again denominational misinterpretation of that change in the moment twinkling and i they don't understand that by time that happens you can't get in it anymore it's over it's done it's gone amen you see so just be ready for that amen oh my some morning oh yes you'll be gone and no one can find them wouldn't be too bad to know it wouldn't it would be so bad to know it's done past and you missed it at this very moment in which we are living we are in the completion of the fulfillment of matthew 24 24 praise god bear with me here today by the grace of god and so much as it were possible they were deceived very elected who is it in this day would attempt to deceive the very elect you see it's the same spirit of the antichrist right through the ages what do you think else you're going to be facing in this age right in working through in the false anointed ones of this last day those false ones they come also claiming in jesus name see claiming that they too have been anointed of god for these last days they are the faults of messiahs false messiahs they claim their two are prophets but are but are they one with the word are you going to be claimed to be a prophet and you're not one with the word for my the the prophet is the word of god to his generation praise god personified of course praise the lord oh my now and they claim to be a prophet yet adding to it or taking away from it no one denies the spirit of god is manifesting upon them in gifts surely amen but it's the same spirit that was back there like upon balaam having all their programs making all appeals for money can you say amen to that is that going on in our day exercising gifts but denying the word or bypass it for fear that they may cause some controversy that controversy that might diminish their chances for greater gain and glory is that right oh my yet they are preaching salvation yet they are preaching deliverance through the power of god just like judas did he said even with a ministry that was imparted by christ but because we see he had the wrong seed wrong seed to begin with so what else are you going to be producing how can you that's why he said don't you understand every seed must bring forth after its kind oh glory to god he says you can't be if the seed is supposed to produce an orange branch you can't have it suddenly producing lemons though coming from the same tree and claiming oh i'm from the same tree no you are not the original branch praise god but he's saying god has his original branch praise god amen yes sir they have the wrong spirit wrong seed wrong spirit motivating and moving them making them religious they're religious they're in the church they're in your midst like judas was with even jesus not that jesus was deceived not that jesus couldn't see it but he left him alone you don't tear up the tears like that well unless there's a purpose and a reason for it but you need to recognize so that you can fortify protect yourself and not be caught up with a naive so-called a christian belief of the holy spirit in you god these spirits come around you and try to wrap you up in the coils of their of their argumentation and say oh you know i'm so needy i got this problem and you by the way they might say plain like i'm saying maybe you got six blankets and i don't have none look how i'm shivering in the cold and you're supposed to have love you see the argument's so deceiving that if you're not watching you'll be caught up with human sympathy and not led by the real love of god and the holy spirit working in and through you and you don't let that happen to you even when i'm on the street and there is people begging at every street corner right there could be a hundred beggars i passed but do i go on uh and give them all money as i'm going out the lord said to give so therefore i give all of them money oh oh this money might have a bible while he's begging so i'll give him more no no no no no only if all of a sudden some this the holy spirit strikes me and said now give that one give this one it's only then other than that i'm going my way jesus said it's so plain he says were there not so many lepers in israel i mean elijah go out and heal everyone no he only gave and delivered those ones god gave him he said who do you think i come to i just come for everybody i came to the lost sheep of the house of israel a comforting elect hallelujah praise god hallelujah whosoever will may come you may come it's all right to come nothing's wrong with that at least you'll be a better person but i come for the elected seed of the living god hallelujah amen yes sir you see wrong spirit is motivating them and they'll even outshine the elect in all their efforts and with all their zeal you know in another message he said that he said don't you understand they're gonna elect they're gonna outshine you don't even try to don't even try you said because a mule will always outwork a horse is that right if they don't have nothing else we got heaven to gain they ain't got nothing else so they got to work work work they didn't even work this work that and and it's great it's wonderful they're building hospitals they're building universities they're building great things great they're helping the poor they're feeding thousands millions good it's wonderful and we even want to help them do those kinds of things but we know exactly the difference right there and then amen hallelujah oh my they're allowed shiny left in their zeal and in their efforts but it is all of the ledesian spirit it is not of christ for that spirit looks for big crowds always looking for big crowds big programs and their desire to see stackling signs taking place amongst them they preach about the second coming of christ and turn around and deny the advent of the prophet messenger of this age they don't realize that what was a sign that being the wave chief was assigned to the rest of the elect that he had come down christ had come down the seals were open and now here he is among us interpreting his own word and making himself plain to us do you get it blessed be the name of the lord oh my he said even though through him in power and in signs and in revelation eclipses them all ah yes even though that this false spirit in this last day is so close to the real can be distinguished only by its deviation from the word outwardly they look just like you amen everything religious everything sometimes he said the lord do you look more holier than you and perfect and walking in the walking in the bible better than you memorize it better than you know the quotes nor the scripture better than you he says i'll do you at every turn hallelujah but watch he said they can do all that and they're so evening you might not pick it up but how you pick it up what's their deviation from the world amen and whenever it is caught when it is caught being anti-world it always like to fall back on this one argument that it's always had through the ages that shows them to be false well look how the lord is working through me i get results we get results don't we get results then we have to be of god uh because we're getting results and holy spirit is walking through us working through us amen that is in the uh the resume of the ages uh under the seven church ages see in the days of the prophets that's exactly what happened they did the same thing they didn't recognize them people till they had done come done their ministry and had finished took out of that elected and after they were gone then they recognized that there was a prophet that was there walked amongst them jesus came to earth he said not even 19 of the people on the earth even knew in that time that he the savior the world had come until they crucified him they buried him he rose on the third day before they ever knew who he was and it comes in and it goes out just like that all the time and people don't recognize it until it's over see because it never why does that happen why don't they recognize it it never fits their theology their rigid in other words their religious church teachings that they've been receiving and like i told you that that that shapes your mind when you're young and it shapes your environment your whole background and you come up to this time and it's a whole backwash of things that unconsciously been laid the devil make sure he tries to lay that in you and now the word the washing of the water of the world comes to take that all away amen and wash us clean and make us white as snow hallelujah amen you see wow let me give you some things i made a note here the people don't recognize what's happening he said because it never fits into their theology it never fits into their time of the day in other words they don't recognize that they um which time of the week they're in the time of the day they don't know which time of the week they're in so you know somehow still think they're they're lutherans they're lutheran age sometimes they're baptists they're back in methodist and wesley age they don't think like that that they're spiritually back in that age but what their spirit that is in them is spouting identifies it that it identifies with that age back there amen and those that are under that pentecostal influence that may even be under the in them in the message amen they may not be acting jumping and carrying on like pentecostals but when they speak and their response to the word their reaction to the message and the revelation of the word of god their activity as he said the motivating thing of that spirit that's back there oh and their reaction to the word proves what is back there what's inside that skin what's hiding in there it proves it see they it doesn't fit the time of the day they got their lines tangled up they got everything next mixed up hallelujah oh he said here not only that they don't recognize what's happening because they're always living in a glare of another age that has already passed amen they're living in the glare of another age in other words they are still allowing themselves or not even conscious sometimes that they're being influenced or motivated by the glare that they're getting from another age hallelujah he said see they're blinded by that glare also like it was back then oh we call it traditions but he never come according to traditions and the people are blinded by keeping to their church traditions amen oh my and so much but that they thought that when he come preaching the truth that he jesus had come to break up their churches you know what they thought about brother branham the truth that they're exclaiming their worship the god they claim to serve is standing right before them preaching the truth to them but you see the devil and the church leaders and elders had led them so far away from the truth of the word of god that when it comes and it's announcing itself he look like he is way out and they you see that's the way it is they couldn't accept jesus himself because they were living under the glare of the law and jesus didn't come contrary to the law he came to fulfill the law amen he come to make it real hallelujah but he says listen but because his message back then wasn't exactly the way the way they had it it was it was called them traditions they didn't come according to their traditions see they couldn't receive him but it was because of his message hallelujah we know you you are you are so-and-so's son but there's things that you're saying his message they couldn't receive him because of his message they think when brother branstad towns is not the evidence of the holy ghost he come to break up all the churches and he comes to town as one god they think he comes to break up all the churches but they don't realize he's bringing them back to the original truth of the word of god my friends that could happen again do you know it and if it happens again maybe we wouldn't even know it oh my i imagine if he would actually were to appear here tonight while i'm speaking to you he's talking to them and he's saying if he were to appear here amen and i i wanna just i won't give you the whole quote but another place he said if he were standing here in my place wearing a business suit on you know like i'm wearing and speaking to you you wouldn't many will not even recognize him it's not the truth oh my yes think of it if he would actually appear here again tonight it would be so contrary to what they all got figured out and drawn up on their charts what they are teaching in them schools and all them things they are giving out only a very few would recognize what was really going on he said it would be so and how that he would come hallelujah and men always have to have that is from this message called the presence of god amongst them unrecognized is that the truth is that happening again is it repeating again in our time as simply and plainly as we see it it's happening again praise god hallelujah they have their own their ideas of how god ought to be and what he when he appears what he's going to do amen but i've always made a spirit man always gives god praise for what he did and always looking forward to what he will do and ignoring what he is doing right now is that right that's the way they miss it nine times out of ten out of 10 the thing is already happening around them and it's so simple and it's happening around them they don't know it is that right you're looking at it but you don't know what you're seeing when you look what do you see you heard the other quote where i said someone could tell you to go get such and such from the barn and because you don't know what's a hammer you can be looking at the hammer and you go pick up a saw because you think the saw is the hammer because you don't know what you're supposed to see you're looking but you're not seeing right and so the holy spirit has come to quicken us to see the coming of the lord praise god hallelujah now remember god hides in simplicity reveals himself in the same remember this is the complete revelation of jesus christ hallelujah the seven seals had the mysteries hid if that's what it all was but it was supposed to open and it's supposed to open in the last days at the edition church age but at the end of time at the end of the ladies and church age when time shall be no more when the changes are over that's when it's supposed to make itself manifest and reveal itself see in the last day at the end of time thanks be to god when that happens that shows and finishes the message of the church ages he repeats that now finishes it when you look back now and see what has been see where it all it's all brought up to and then now it finishes it yes it now finishes the age of the church right so it's now we can see it's not just mike coming to you a long while ago and saying he's talking about those the the the church ages the man who come to the last of those church ages statue of a perfect man and has entered into that eternal church age at the end of the seals he said it over and over in many different ways it's all done completed and now it's time for the bride to enter in hallelujah praise god and go into the word see it finishes the age of the church you know what he's saying one edge closes and another one opens it's always the case one edge closes another one opens so when those church ages end what opens up it can't be another church age that we're preaching or talking about don't let the devil mess your mind up to tell you that that's what i'm talking about that's a lie because he's talking about people that have eternal life and so people that has an eternal life their messenger can't be a man it has to be that mighty angel that eternal being the mighty elohim god the covenant angel i'm just saying it many ways but all eternal messenger to an eternal people that will live in the eternal church age if we call it church edge for the mortal heirs but to break back into eternity by the revelation of the word to enter back where you come from for we are not creatures of time we come from eternity we're going back to eternity we come from the beginning in the mind of god we're going back to the mind of god hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah what oh he said i know this chokes you up when you hear that just so that you'll be sure hallelujah you must understand don't just read your bible like this like you're reading a newspaper you must read between the lines and see when you read hallelujah you're not just to read your bible but read and see what you read we are quicker to see he said see oh then when you read like that then the picture will begin to come oh praise god hallelujah amen feast of the trumpets oh the picture will begin to come and you recognize it's christ revealing himself in his own word oh thank god oh my continuing feast of the trumpets now you see the church of the pentecostal age is done finished it's over and now the bride has to prepare herself to step of the out of the way to go up now so that them two other servants of god them two spoken of in revelation them two prophets can appear on the scene to sound the seventh trumpet to them to make them make known to them christ like we know christ now when he said seventh trumpet there you gotta understand he's talking really about the seventh seal the seventh seal and that when that's the seal to us but the trumpet to them right praise god and he says and you see uh we have to go out the way he said because two two like that supernatural beings can't be on the earth here at the same time one has to go so that the other one can manifest and so the rapture is near the bride has to go out of here so that those can be man manifest hallelujah and the spirit of the living god can move upon the earth amen god has other things praise god if you have a little more time i'll speak a little more and bring this to an end i'm not going to keep you forever here but i want to get this thought out praise god hallelujah remember he was god remember he was the genuine mercy seat remember he was the atonement hallelujah we sing the hymn we say lo behold him in front of you oh he has the mighty conqueror since he rent the veil in two unveils a tradition he's talk he's singing about there there's a tradition veils of ideas he rent them into to cause you to see what you're seeing today by the opening of the word of god amen and now you see he he came and the bright sea the mercy seat is now hanging in clear view of the congregation but many of them being under popular opinion can't see the word of god for their age are you thinking of what i'm saying you're thinking about what i'm saying right praise the lord hallelujah amen but in the view of today in the view of what we have here today i'm afraid the traditions of the church fathers had has hid this from many people since the holy ghost has come in these last days as he prophesied and the veil has been rent past tense the veil has been red now while i'm talking there just strike me the scriptures just coming to me now remember when jesus was there on calvary on calvary and gave up the ghost and screamed with a loud voice to call for the resurrected dead while i'm talking to you all that came right into me remember did not say an angel came with a mighty sword and rip that veil from top to bottom you've got the same thing in your day an angel a seventh angel come with the perfect word of god hebrews 4 12 and rent the veil of traditions and ideas from the minds of man that you might see the mercy seat plain view before you oh praise be to god hallelujah yes it is in plain view of those who believe for he hid the word the real promised word of this day he hid that word and them traditions made a veil to hide that word behind but he quickened us to see what was there praise god mighty god unveiled before be before us praise god his mystery now is known to his bright tree as it was in the beginning fruit in the beginning and it is now bringing forth the same fruits that was in the tree there in the beginning now let me get to some things here now praise god first world war second world war right around us we're ready for the third world war how many realize that that's where we are right now everything around you see that's telling you that we we are right now on the brink of having the third world war started i'm not saying this war that is going on is going to be it we're going to be it but all these things are winding up to that world war right israel is back in their homeland we see the war brewing everywhere around us the gentile church the pentecostal church all of it has got lukewarm and he's spitting them out he's spewing them out oh my he spewed out of his mouth already the pentecostal age it's done spewed out oh just before the world to be destroyed jesus said as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man hallelujah this gentile church would then receive the same power an angel the same witness they'll receive the same thing when you look you see the world nervous the nation's nervous the the insane institutions filled with the people amen nations around us shaking oh yes let's sing that nations are breaking and i'm just giving a little break here praise the lord nations are breaking and israel's awakening the signs that the bible foretold gentile this numbered with horrors and cumber return o dispersed to your own for the day of redemption so near men's hearts are failing for fear be filled with god's spirit your lamps trimmed and clear look up your redemption is near we are aware he says who do you say this is we are aware that the earth has gone through some great burnt pains the church is also going through some birth pains let me just break this quickly to move away from much of this quote the world is going through its board pains through war the church is going through its birth pains through the presence of a prophet being in its midst and his preaching is the pulsation that causes that work pain in the church war is the pulsation that causes the birth pains in the world oh praise god hallelujah but see now all that the world has went through now it's getting ready for a third world war can you say amen and it's birth pains time again but there's only one thing that can bring peace and that is christ not the u.n not all these things that they're claiming let's go here to stop the war let's do this let's do that only christ amen all our schemes all our ideas all our ecclesiastic build up all of our politics all our science everything else they are proving themselves to be nonsense amen and then they're praying to god lord help us lord help us lord help us lord come and intervene come in do something for us lord and then when he does come in and intervenes i wonder if we would be able to understand what he's doing recognize what he's doing would we be able to receive what he's doing would we even be willing to consider what he's doing amen people a lot of people may be praying right now lord stop the war stop the war but he can stop the war but when he stops it in such a way that you don't recognize that is god stopped it and why he stopped it how he stopped him praise the lord i hope god opens your eyes to this now for i'm not just speaking to this church here i'm speaking where this tip will ever go worldwide i don't mean to hurt anybody's feelings but you see it's the ecclesiastical realm right that has loosed these spirits again are you getting that they've lose the spirits from out of all pagan rome that went forth back there on them jews who have always been their enemy right and rome has always been god's enemy it has turned loose that same spirit see by and on the dictators of the world can you say amen see what spirit is working through why do you think that people are just getting blown up by the thousands the rest of the world sits right there nothing's happening because they don't understand it looks natural but there's something supernatural going on right there now and god is saying see that in other words that same spirit that worked in the inquisition where they killed 25 million in the world what's the world done nothing right and they're still killing whether it's up whether it's up in the north here of canada where what is down in the united states in whatever city that was there all around the world is going on and they're killing by the thousands and the world is doing nothing about it why oh my he said it's that ecclesiastical spirit amen hiding behind the cross and committing evil deeds in the name of christ oh my what a deceiver oh my lord have mercy think of it see that it's moving on the dictators of the world because the religious system was still there were holding it but now it's loosed and it's being loosed how many of you recognize that it was an orthodox priest that actually told mr putin not my saying it is in the paper so you can go and search it on the internet that told him that he is doing this in the name of god and he is supposed to deliver those people from the godless nazism back to the original fate of the orthodox religion which is the eastern catholic church it's the same spirit is eastern that's the eastern arm and what we call rome is actually the western arm of the same catholic church and the bible already tell you they're going to come right back together like that anyway but it's that ecclesiastical spirit that's causing this war and you can go back far and you can see it was a catholic spirit that was there anointing hitler when he came forward to the war it's the same thing they were behind the scenes urging him on egging him on taking all the paintings and all the wealth and hiding it and passing it through the vatican and so on like that it's right there in history and in the world right you can see it and so that spirit has always been god's enemy and it's loosed but you see you must see the hour of slaughter bringing that slaughter for is the spirit the same spirit of the antichrist bringing protestant a ecumenical council of the churches together and taking them to a slaughter just like they did oh my but in the same hour the calling of the bride hallelujah why because loose in ecclesiastical church spirit that spirit is loose upon what or upon who not upon the denominations see they are now loosed upon the bride do you get it oh my then you'll find if you go back to revelation it talks about that woman's that was there and and made the antichrist spirit the dragon spew out of our mouth his mouth lies and spew out things upon that woman and trying to eat up that child that she brought for the man child amen praise god but you see it's war against the bride spiritual war amen these spirits i was telling you earlier in the year i just feel like like it's more devils around and more activity going around attacking the mind attacking the body attacking your being in every possible way my friends we talk about the war but you really are now living in the midst of an ongoing war that's taking place and those spirits are amongst us working in every possible way for the bride but the bride you see she is there it's there upon the bride do you get it but the bride will not go through the tribulation the bible says no the church will but not the bride but the church has to go through persecution for her perfection but the bride is perfected by the blood of jesus christ hallelujah church perfected by persecution but the bride perfected by the blood of jesus christ hallelujah oh praise god hallelujah just give me just a i'm on my last coats here praise god so directly at one o'clock if you i'm going to say watch at the clock but i don't watch the clock watch listen to me and today he is standing among us but he's standing here in the person of the holy ghost christ come back what are you talking about the return coming lord what are you looking for what do you expect he says he has he's here but he's standing here in the person of the holy ghost manifesting himself and he is manifesting himself listen to this more and more as he is coming into his church and making himself known because him and the bride the groom will making himself known to her and one day you'll see that the one that you feel in your heart and you begin to see his identification around you will become personalized before you then use you'll know you and he are one because you are united by the word hallelujah and when i say the word that word that was back there in him in the beginning will go back again to the beginning which is god and in that day you'll know that i am in the father the father in me i in you and you in me the prophet says hallelujah we are here now hallelujah i'm so glad to see him personifying himself right now amongst us we see promise for the world not what somebody's come amongst us with their emotion making himself no not by their singing not by their jumping up and they're dancing around this is all here in the quote trying to do god the servants without doing his will the will of god amen he is making himself known and remember this is a secret catching away how many believe that it's a secret catching away hallelujah oh my millions of people in the world and at least 500 people every day back then it was 500 maybe it's thousands every day missing they come up missing they just don't know where they are they're gone i'm not saying they're gone in the rapture but they can be dead some accident something can happen some can be gone in their portion of it i don't know but they come up missing hallelujah we don't even know where they went see the rapture is going to make up all of those who sleep in the dust of the earth that's right with god and when it does go somebody will say i thought the rapture was supposed to take place it's already passed it's just that you didn't know it here he said i said that he says and you know it not you are left everything is going like that it's a secret coming he said the coming of the lord which i tell you he's already been coming hallelujah and the bride going he says is a rapture see like his secret coming not was like a secret rapture going on for this he is coming like a thief in the night what is he coming to do to steal her away praise god like the book i read of romeo and juliet when juliet come romeo come at night time when all them people who are sleeping in their worldliness all in their churchianity all in them things then all of a sudden the cry come and away the two of them went praise god hallelujah i want to thank god that our lord jesus has climbed up the seven rungs of that ladder and got to the window at the top and he was able to cause her to come out of that dark room and seen the light the light of his word recognize him so and there away he catches her away through the window of time caught up into eternity praise god aren't you glad as we talk about it that we are in it right now praise god because right now this is where you are now where the spirit is drawing you from time through this little window of time that we lived in is drawing you out of that back into eternity by his great magnetizing presence how his word thanks be to god hallelujah when the musicians come steal away steal away steal away home i ain't got long to stay here my lord calls me he calls me by the thunder the trumpet sounds within my heart oh still away still away home i ain't got long to stay here i'll get you in a minute brother praise god you know i was while studying the word i came across um uh a rare quote if you want to put it that way brother branham was just relating uh our dream that brother junior jackson had he said then junior and that boy is really gifted with dreams and all them dreams that he tells me they are right he said but in this dream that he was telling me he says i don't know you were having a meeting and i see myself coming to that meeting in the meeting thousands of people around then i heard thunders thunderings

the name of the lord just before brother sorry i was just forgetting this but this from this monday night 7 30 at the holiday inn here in burlington the international assemblies of god independence sorry assemblies of god you know brother hutchinson was here last week with his wife he is the superintendent for the ontario region and you know that independent assemblies of god was founded by the mother and father of brother paul macphail who is the general their general superintendent and they knew brother branham and from they noticed that none of the churches want to ordain or to certify their ministers to go preach the gospel so they formed this independent assemblies of god and had it registered so that they can do that and they have been doing that up to this day and this time and so uh of course i told them i said you know you hear me preach you know what i believe and the stuff that you guys are saying it's good it's wonderful people but all your doctrines don't line up like that but we are still friends we are brothers in christ why do you think he's still coming here he knows what i believe one god what a baptism in jesus name adam and eve in the garden and the serpent's seed and all that but the spirit that he feels and it still pulls them draws them won't be close to it so anyway they've asked me to give a testimony on tuesday night um there praise god uh on a monday night i believe the mayor of burlington is supposed to uh be there monday night tuesday night they have a preacher that will preach but i will just give a testimony i'm not the preacher

me for some help they do have ushers but they'd like to have four uh men that can help them with the ushering i said we will see what we can do by the grace of god hallelujah so we're thanking god that he will empower us and enable us to be a blessing to them in every way because he comes in there and you see the order that of the spirit and how god works so that they want to make a blessing so i said okay i'll put it to some of the brothers and we'll see if they have the time and the willingness to be able to do it but i'm telling you this so that you may know what is happening what is going on and of course on tuesday night monday night tuesday night wednesday night any night you feel like coming i appreciate your your support even for a brief period even if they have me talk for two minutes uh just to see your face somewhere in that uh crowd of people because they have people coming from around the country right uh at the point when he spoke to me there were already over a hundred people already in town in preparation for the meeting so there might be i don't know how many people but very crowded people in there so your support will be really um desired uh by me just seeing you all in the audience would be a real blessing and we really appreciate that god bless every one of you and continue to pray and ask god to continue to pour out the water part what the word and give me the message you might be able to bring it to you is that right praise the name of the lord i believe i'll announce to you too that in a few weeks i've been leaving to go down into south america and i'll be returning to my own home country where they have asked me to relate to them the history of the beginning of the message in that country and so they're gathering the ministers um from around i don't know anything about it who they where they are how many but they'll be gathering in the capital and i'm asked to go there and she'll just give them because in their eyes i am now along with myself brother nelson and a few others the last ones left so they don't want anybody to go anywhere without a proper you know relating of what actually happened back there so i said okay i haven't been back there over 20 something years but i will now go back to do this and may god bless them in every possible way so start praying for me start praying for those meetings i'm praying that god will pour out the spirit upon the people in every way amen praise god and don't remember don't forget you hear me say oh i'm going but i can't do these things unless because of your giving because of your pray because of your support praise the lord that is how i'm able to do this that is how this church is able to grow and survive and press on by the grace of god hallelujah i think i'm going to leave the pulpit now because yeah you know what's happening the anointing of god's spirit still being on me it makes you just wanna god bless you brother [Music] keep the devil away [Music] the
