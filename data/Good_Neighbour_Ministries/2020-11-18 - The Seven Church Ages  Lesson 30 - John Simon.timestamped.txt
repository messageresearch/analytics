[0:14] how wonderful it is
[0:16] to be in the house of god once again
[0:20] thanks be to our blessed lord jesus
[0:24] christ
[0:26] uh last week we came to the end
[0:31] of our talk
[0:35] and today we begin the
[0:38] end of the ephesians search age and now
[0:41] we come to the introduction
[0:45] and entry into the
[0:48] church age of smyrna or the smyrnian
[0:52] church age our
[0:55] scripture is this today
[0:58] out of the book of revelation chapter
[1:02] 2 verse 8
[1:06] and unto the angel of the church
[1:10] in smyrna right
[1:14] these things said the first and the last
[1:19] which was dead and
[1:22] is alive our gracious heavenly father
[1:28] as we have read out
[1:32] of the book of life we
[1:35] pray in the name of the lord jesus
[1:38] christ
[1:39] that your great holy spirit will
[1:42] speak through your temple and glorify
[1:46] your name
[1:48] make your word clear father that we may
[1:52] hear
[1:53] that we may understand that we may
[1:56] see and perceive
[2:00] what it is that you are
[2:03] doing and making known to us for this
[2:06] day and hour
[2:08] we ask your blessing in the name of
[2:10] jesus christ our lord
[2:12] amen praise god hallelujah
[2:16] amen and
[2:19] unto the angel of the church of smyrna
[2:25] right these things
[2:28] saith he that
[2:31] was the first and the last
[2:34] which was dead and is
[2:38] alive now we just want to
[2:42] refresh your mind again at this time
[2:47] and show how we arrive
[2:51] at the names of these messengers
[2:55] to the various church ages
[2:59] now of course god
[3:02] has allowed us to be able to recognize
[3:05] this
[3:05] first of all by history
[3:10] history of the new testament church
[3:13] was not lost we know we have the
[3:17] scripture but the history
[3:19] of the new testament church was not lost
[3:23] but
[3:23] god allowed that also to be preserved
[3:28] so that we may have a record of the
[3:31] actions
[3:32] activities and methods of these
[3:35] various messengers down through the
[3:40] ages of the church of god
[3:43] just as much as the history of israel
[3:47] the nation of israel god did not let
[3:50] their history go
[3:52] but he recorded it in what we
[3:55] know as the old testament
[3:59] helping us to have a clear understanding
[4:03] of what happened to israel
[4:06] and now we see god
[4:10] allowing the knowledge and history
[4:14] of the new testament church
[4:17] to be kept so that
[4:20] we may be able to ascertain
[4:25] who the various messengers
[4:28] of these church ages are
[4:32] and now of course we know that
[4:35] the bible that was given to us
[4:39] israel's part that they played in the
[4:43] formation of the bible and then
[4:47] god supernaturally allowed
[4:50] divine corroboration of
[4:54] these facts by
[4:57] multitudes of scrolls that were
[5:01] kept that were uncovered
[5:04] discovered multitudes of of scrolls that
[5:08] were
[5:09] found in kumram
[5:12] there in israel and god blessed me and
[5:17] been able to visit there to see where
[5:20] the
[5:20] goat herder true stone
[5:24] to be able to get his goats to go moving
[5:27] and the stone
[5:28] went into the mouth of a cave and struck
[5:32] on a vessel and the hollow sound
[5:34] attracted his attention
[5:35] and there he went into the cave
[5:38] and found these uh scrolls within these
[5:43] uh these uh great big urns
[5:46] that were in there and other
[5:50] artifacts and other forms of archaeology
[5:55] have been uncovered that actually
[5:59] approves and corroborates the
[6:03] words of our bible the places the names
[6:07] the cities
[6:08] are all there in the bible
[6:12] and when they are followed up they can
[6:15] be
[6:15] found to be true and they
[6:19] they match what is being said
[6:22] in history concerning them
[6:26] praise god hallelujah so in reading the
[6:30] history of the new testament church
[6:34] we know paul was the first the original
[6:39] messenger to the church age
[6:42] and we particularly place paul
[6:45] as the messenger of the ephesian
[6:49] church age now all the other messengers
[6:53] that were to follow
[6:55] in history the closest
[6:59] of them to approximately with paul
[7:04] are the ones that may be and can be
[7:08] and will be identified
[7:11] as the messenger to that particular
[7:15] age so you see as paul was used
[7:19] to bring the people back to the word
[7:23] so were these messengers
[7:26] these angels angels meaning
[7:30] messenger messenger of god
[7:33] all these great uh messengers
[7:38] that were used of god were used of god
[7:42] to bring the people of the
[7:45] age back to the word
[7:49] the age that was before may have drifted
[7:52] away from the word of god
[7:56] and when they have drifted away from the
[7:58] word of god
[7:59] god brings a man on the scene
[8:03] and he will use that man as his
[8:06] his anointed vessel to
[8:09] bring the people back to his
[8:12] original word and so
[8:16] those are the ones that we will examine
[8:18] and look at
[8:19] as we see the ages progressing
[8:23] down through the corridors of time
[8:27] and out of these we will find
[8:32] one for every age will will stand out
[8:37] i will find that the one is friends
[8:41] one that is the closest uh
[8:44] to the word
[8:48] and one that will closely hold to the
[8:51] word of god in his pattern of life
[8:56] pattern of ministry and in the power of
[8:59] the word
[9:00] that flows through him
[9:04] now that one such a one
[9:08] would be the messenger for that
[9:11] particular
[9:12] age praise god
[9:16] now just read the read the
[9:20] history read histories read the book of
[9:23] revelation
[9:25] and you will find friends
[9:29] of all the patterns all the things said
[9:32] in the book of revelation
[9:34] and when you check it against history
[9:38] you will see how it matches or our
[9:40] history corroborates
[9:43] the things lots of the things
[9:46] that were said in this
[9:49] book of revelation lots of the
[9:52] conditions
[9:53] spoken of in this book of revelation
[9:57] can be seen through the lens
[10:01] of history we will be able to recognize
[10:05] the age and time in which
[10:09] we are living
[10:12] now of course the history must
[10:15] follow what the bible says forth
[10:19] we look at the history and where the
[10:22] when the history matches the bible and
[10:25] it shows the
[10:27] life of that man or messenger
[10:31] matches the bible and what was spoken
[10:35] of that particular messenger
[10:38] how he will be and how he would live
[10:40] it's there within
[10:42] the word of god now thank god
[10:47] the the bible is not a
[10:50] book of my friends that is difficult
[10:54] it's god really hiding himself
[10:57] in simplicity and revealing himself
[11:02] in the very same thing and we thank god
[11:05] for that
[11:06] so we ascertain this as we look
[11:09] at the bible we see god
[11:12] operating in simplicity
[11:15] praise god amen and we
[11:19] also look to see god's vindication
[11:23] not only is the man the season and time
[11:28] identified by history
[11:32] cooperating with the words
[11:35] of the bible what it says about the
[11:38] conditions of the
[11:40] end times that would exist but
[11:43] also we recognize the
[11:46] by the vindication of the holy spirit
[11:51] the same god that vindicated
[11:55] abel in the garden of eden
[11:58] of eden the same god who vindicated
[12:03] moses by the pillar of fire
[12:06] the same god who vindicates his
[12:10] servants down through the ages
[12:13] right to the last messenger william
[12:16] marian
[12:16] branham over whom appeared the great
[12:20] halo of light
[12:21] the great appearance of the angels of
[12:24] god that came down and
[12:28] spoke with him on sunset mountain in
[12:31] arizona
[12:32] vindication by god also by science
[12:37] wonders mighty miracles and prophecy
[12:40] by the declarations of the holy spirit
[12:45] so god identifies his messengers
[12:48] then god vindicates his messengers
[12:52] and proves that they are his
[12:55] they are sent from him they are anointed
[12:58] by him
[12:59] they are used by him and vindicated by
[13:03] him
[13:04] to him be all the praise the honor
[13:07] and the glory are blessed lord jesus
[13:11] amen praise god now
[13:14] to look at the messenger my friends
[13:18] and using the principles and rules of
[13:22] god's own
[13:23] choosing we can unhesitately declare
[13:29] that irenaeus was
[13:32] exalted by the lord to this position
[13:37] of the messenger of smyrna
[13:42] now to speak of iranians first of all
[13:46] he was a disciple of
[13:49] the great saint polycarp
[13:53] amen so he was a disciple he sat
[13:56] at the feet of polycarp was
[14:00] taught the word by polycarp
[14:03] and moved and lived after
[14:06] the the model
[14:10] lifestyle and walk
[14:13] of the great saint polycarp
[14:17] it is no doubt that all the christian
[14:22] virtues and graces that flowed
[14:25] from his life my friends
[14:30] life that was consecrated
[14:33] was just marvelous and wonderful to
[14:36] behold
[14:38] now polycarp was a man holy
[14:41] dedicated to the lord and a great man
[14:46] an illustrious saint through all the
[14:50] ages
[14:51] his life lights up the pages of history
[14:55] and gives us a magnificent
[14:58] example of what it means
[15:01] to be a son of the living and servant
[15:05] of the living god when we look at his
[15:08] life
[15:10] he lived a blameless life in the
[15:12] presence
[15:13] of almighty god he
[15:16] lived a sincere honest life
[15:20] righteous in the presence
[15:23] of the lord and in view of the
[15:26] saints of the living god you will
[15:30] remember
[15:31] or you will if you don't remember let me
[15:34] make this known polycarp was martyred
[15:38] he was killed because of his
[15:42] faith in the living god
[15:46] and polycarp what a wonderful man
[15:50] no he felt that he was too old
[15:53] to flee for his life
[15:56] and he was such a sincere man
[16:00] that he did not want to endanger the
[16:03] lives of those that would try to hide
[16:05] him
[16:05] keep him or protect him
[16:08] so he told them to go and he gave
[16:12] himself
[16:13] up unto death
[16:16] but before when the authorities took him
[16:20] and carried him away before
[16:23] executing him he asked for permission
[16:27] to have a time of prayer and there
[16:30] history records that he
[16:32] prayed for about two hours
[16:36] and he prayed for the governor
[16:39] and he prayed for his brethren and the
[16:42] lord
[16:43] that god will keep them safe and
[16:47] protect them he prayed for his enemies
[16:52] that hated him and he prayed for his
[16:55] captors
[16:56] who had captured him praise the lord
[17:00] and he did this i am sure because in his
[17:03] heart
[17:04] of hearts he desired to have a better
[17:08] resurrection
[17:09] and to walk with the saints above glory
[17:13] be to god
[17:14] hallelujah he stood firm on the word of
[17:17] god
[17:18] they wanted him to deny the lord jesus
[17:22] they wanted to be to him to deny his
[17:25] faith
[17:26] but he stood firm in the light
[17:29] of opposition and refused to deny
[17:34] jesus christ and deny the true
[17:37] faith of the living god
[17:40] and so he died with a free and
[17:45] clear conscience of being
[17:48] ready to meet the lord
[17:52] the scene was of such they had prepared
[17:56] a stake
[17:59] and they tied him the great polycarp
[18:03] was tied secured to that
[18:07] particular stake
[18:10] but when that tied him to their surprise
[18:14] he told them he would not run he would
[18:16] not try to escape
[18:18] untie me i don't want to be tied
[18:21] so they took off the ropes from him
[18:25] and there he was surrounded by the wood
[18:29] around him and there lit
[18:33] all of the wood
[18:36] around him so the fire was lit
[18:40] and with the fire roaring around him
[18:43] the captors noticed that instead of the
[18:46] fire
[18:46] consuming him the fires
[18:50] moved away from him and would not
[18:53] touch him where he was a
[18:56] man kept by the power and presence
[19:00] of almighty god like daniel
[19:03] and the four boy and the boys and the
[19:06] free boys in the fairy
[19:08] furnace there it was the fire
[19:11] refused to touch him and when
[19:14] the fire would not touch him they
[19:16] reached through the fire and pierced him
[19:18] in his sight
[19:19] with a sword and when they did that
[19:23] out of his body gushed so much
[19:26] water that it drowned all the flames
[19:30] and killed the fire that was
[19:33] set to consume him
[19:37] oh my and then
[19:40] they saw his spirit
[19:44] leaving his body you see how can they
[19:47] see a spirit
[19:48] well it came out in the form of a snow
[19:51] white dove
[19:53] as it left his body and ascended in the
[19:56] air
[19:57] oh thanks be to god hallelujah
[20:00] on the wings of the snow white
[20:04] dove god sends his pure
[20:07] sweet love a sign
[20:10] from above on the wings of
[20:14] a dove on the wings of a snow
[20:18] white dove that was released
[20:22] out of his body his spirit in that form
[20:26] went to be with the lord
[20:30] hallelujah uh but for
[20:34] all this marvelous
[20:37] wonderful testimony of polycarp
[20:42] uh we find out that he
[20:45] of course was a disciple and student
[20:49] of john the revelator
[20:52] take this follow it john the revelator
[20:56] polycarp was one of his disciples taught
[21:00] by him
[21:01] walk with him finally he leaves the
[21:04] scene
[21:04] polycarp continues on
[21:08] taking the fullness of the word and
[21:11] walking with
[21:12] it with sincerity honesty and dedication
[21:16] to god and he was martyred
[21:19] when he was smart as we've said his
[21:22] spirit
[21:23] left his body in the form of a snow
[21:26] white dove
[21:28] and now we are looking through his
[21:31] religious walk
[21:33] he was not a militant he was not
[21:37] militant at all matter of fact
[21:41] he was not against the nicolaitan system
[21:47] he tend to believe in cooperation with
[21:50] them
[21:51] association with them
[21:54] and that he would be able to
[21:58] find fellowship by being able to
[22:01] get along with them not realizing
[22:06] see that that was a trick
[22:09] of the devil the devil can
[22:12] act smooth and and so
[22:15] nice like a cat and the moment
[22:19] that he is aroused the claws come out
[22:23] so we must be very careful of the
[22:26] nicolaitan denominational systems
[22:30] systems as a whole that we have
[22:34] around us amen so here was
[22:37] polycarp ending his days
[22:42] being tricked by satan
[22:45] and thinking that the fellowship and
[22:47] association
[22:49] with the nicolasians was all right
[22:53] then along comes irenaeus
[22:57] irenaeus was not so he was
[23:01] militant and against every
[23:04] form of organization
[23:07] his life's history tells us that
[23:11] the way he served the lord the
[23:14] powers of god the manifestations of the
[23:17] holy spirit
[23:19] that flowed through him and he taught
[23:22] the word
[23:23] with such clarity and confirmity
[23:28] praise god when we think of irenas his
[23:32] militancy
[23:33] when we think of the manifestations
[23:37] of the holy spirit a man who believed
[23:41] in the operations of the holy spirit of
[23:44] god
[23:44] in the midst of the church a man who
[23:48] believed and taught
[23:50] the clarity of the word
[23:53] of the living god
[23:57] now we know this
[24:00] because from history of irenius
[24:05] and his the churches he had raised up
[24:09] in the nation of france
[24:13] these churches were known
[24:16] to have the gifts of the holy spirit
[24:19] moving amongst them
[24:23] the saints of god were anointed by the
[24:25] holy ghost
[24:27] many spoken towns and prophesied
[24:30] under the divine inspiration of the holy
[24:34] spirit
[24:36] it was known by history that the
[24:40] dead was even raised up amongst them
[24:43] many a time under the holy spirit of the
[24:46] living god
[24:47] oh praise god healings
[24:51] miracles signs and wonders
[24:54] amongst them by the prayer of
[24:57] earnest prayer of faith hallelujah
[25:01] amen but the point that is being made
[25:05] he had the vindication but he
[25:09] himself stood against all forms
[25:13] of organization because he saw
[25:17] the danger in organized
[25:20] brotherhood let me use a word that was
[25:24] clearer
[25:26] in other words he was against
[25:27] ministerial fraternities
[25:30] ministerial some may call them holy
[25:34] orders he was against such things
[25:37] and stayed with the fullness of the
[25:41] word of the living god so he he went
[25:44] against these
[25:46] organized uh ministers
[25:49] uh meetings and ministers fraternities
[25:53] and
[25:53] ministers orders he stood out against
[25:57] that but
[25:58] with pastors and on other elders
[26:02] of the church of god and stood my
[26:05] friends
[26:06] solidly unified
[26:09] with the holy spirit's power and gifts
[26:12] manifesting within the his local
[26:16] church of the living god and god honored
[26:20] him with the powerless presence and
[26:24] vindication
[26:26] manifesting among the saints of god
[26:29] that were there with him
[26:33] thank god for a man like this
[26:37] we need more men of iranian's quality
[26:42] in this our day and our time
[26:45] to cut through the chaos cut through the
[26:48] madness cut through the blackness
[26:50] and bring the marvelous glorious light
[26:53] of our lord jesus christ
[26:55] and bring to the people what they should
[26:58] hear
[26:59] not what they think they should hear but
[27:01] what god
[27:02] wants them to hear and many times they
[27:05] will
[27:06] not be happy no child is happy when
[27:09] given
[27:10] the medicine that they really need
[27:13] they think they don't need it but you do
[27:15] need it
[27:16] you do not need to have one aspect
[27:20] of a thing but you want to hear god's
[27:23] point of view
[27:24] you may have your view you may have your
[27:27] idea
[27:27] with our human minds we think we have it
[27:31] and then god come overrides that
[27:35] and sends his word and speak to us
[27:38] what is thus saith the lord that we may
[27:41] understand
[27:42] the day in which we live
[27:45] we find that polycarp
[27:48] was clear and definitive
[27:52] in his understanding of the
[27:55] godhead i'm speaking now
[27:58] of how polycarp understood
[28:02] the godhead and since
[28:05] he was a disciple of polycarp
[28:10] who in turn was a disciple
[28:13] of john the revelator
[28:17] we know from that that he had the
[28:20] perfect
[28:21] correct biblical and scriptural teaching
[28:26] directly from god through john
[28:30] through polycarp then to him that there
[28:34] is
[28:34] only one god and the trinity
[28:38] or trinitarian doctrine did not
[28:42] exist it was not part of the world
[28:46] it came much later in human
[28:49] history it began to be presumed and
[28:53] propounded
[28:55] by so-called men of human learning
[29:00] but ignorant and
[29:03] like contrary like a mule
[29:06] to the fullness and clarity
[29:10] of the word of god for they are
[29:13] entrenched in their own ideas
[29:16] entrenched in their own ways and
[29:19] will not look to the word of god oh
[29:22] look and live my brother live look to
[29:25] jesus now and live
[29:28] oh praise the lord hallelujah
[29:31] lord of god look to jesus now and live
[29:35] now in volume 1
[29:39] page 412
[29:42] of the anti-nicean fathers
