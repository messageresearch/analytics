bless you glad to see all the sun beams are out today and we give God praise for you praise the Lord God bless you please be seated briefly we welcome our visitors praise God we welcome back our sister from Germany we're happy for every one of you that are in the house of God here this morning may the great Holy Spirit minister to all of us in a wonderful way because our our our duty now is that we are preparing um to leave uh the Eleazar first found character then he had to get her ready once he found the character that he was searching for his next Duty was to get her ready to meet Isaac that is where we are right now getting the bride the elect ready to meet our Isaac Jesus Christ in this day and in this hour and it's a marvelous thing to be involved in such a great Duty because not anyone can do that if we go to the book of uh Esther we find that before any uh of the women that were going to be chosen to be Queen after vashti were to come into the king's presence or to meet the king first they had to be prepared they had to be made ready and not anyone could do that job he chose the eunuchs today he chooses spiritual eunuchs in other words men that will not plant their own seed you know they're speaking but they don't have any word of Their Own they don't have nothing that they can give to you of themselves only the great Holy Spirit can grant to you the opening of your eyes of your heart of your mind only by Revelation can he do that not we of ourselves but him now I once as a minister ministered under that impression that we have to know so much about the word and know so much about the Bible and history and hermeneutics and apologetics and this and that and the other you have to know all of that mixed with a little greek and some Hebrew and whatnot and be able to really put that into a great stupa to Mel you you know and be able to feed that out and it's very impressive but when you do that it's pointing back to you it binding back to your years of schooling pointing back to your knowledge but the real sermons of God want to take the word and point away from themselves and let your eyes see Jesus only amen I mean naturally you're going to see the person but your thoughts your your whole being must be caught up with being able to come to church come to this assembly every Sunday Wednesday or whenever you are here you're expecting not to see a miracle but to see a person to see the manifestation of Jesus Christ by the opening of the word of God I just grant you one more thing you see when Jesus came on the earth he was God's original seed and then after him when it multiplied itself after uh uh crucifixion Resurrection Ascension Pentecost multiplied himself there and that now the seven Church edges began the great cycle went through with the grain until it came back to a sprout back up until now it's bearing what what's got to go back to back to the original seed again and the Original Seed was not Pentecost The Original Seed was not the apostles as great as they were the original seed was Jesus Christ the word so when the people see the ministry changes from like the one brother Branham had may I say this Malachi 4 5 has already been fulfilled we are not here to copycat we are not here to simulate but the fact is that scripture has been fulfilled and is being fulfilled right the ending of it is is being fulfilled not by him but by the Holy Spirit carrying that out what what I am saying we are not to look back because you see all these Miracle signs wonders and things like that look to where we are now we are in the grain we are not in the shock we are not in the leaf we are not in the Sprout we are back to the grain again when the son of man would be revealed again the who's the son of man Jesus Christ that's when he was in the flesh name Jesus he was called Jesus Christ of course we know that was Jehovah in a body that he himself created and then he called that body the son because God the father's Spirit lived in the visible Sun God in Christ Christ now come back to be in the church and the great Rapture in the kingdom of God come into His fullness praise the Lord oh my well it's wonderful I tell you when you can see the word of God as plain as they making and shaping itself to the glory of God you know um we we want to let you know that ahead of us of course we have Easter praise God there is no command there for you not to eat fish during this week uh uh praise the Lord uh yeah uh it sounds funny but that's true those are Traditions it's not in the Bible praise God I know they'll quote scriptures like Jesus told Peter them and prepared fish for them on the shore and all of that during this time but that's not what we are here for we are here for the bread of life so um we we may even use the terms lent we may even use the term Easter which is not in the scripture either right that is named after the god estar right astarte uh that's like that but when we use it now of course we know what we're talking about so it's not we're going to be legalistic to say oh we're not going to say Easter anymore we gotta find another name no just go ahead and live that's what we're here for once you know the truth everything else has to line up with the word of God it's it's that simple praise the Lord oh lest I keep just chatting with you like that let's go to the word is that right praise the Lord our scripture is found in the Book of Job chapter 2 and then we'll turn quickly to Job chapter 13. and uh if you'd like to read with me before a brief prayer and then we'll go and break the bread of life praise the Lord the Lord said unto Satan behold he is in thine hand save his life so when Satan that's just to tell you that I see the gene of God can go through all kinds of Trials but Satan has no right to take their life amen amen you strain you strain you strange you'll pull you he'll stretch you pressure test you and everything else right and just before your bubble birth he steps in because he knows as the scripture says how much we can bear okay so when Satan so went Satan fought from the presence of God and smote job with sores from the soul of his foot onto his crown and he took him a pot shirt to scrape himself with all and he sat down among the ashes then set his wife unto him thus thou retain thine Integrity Curse God and I job 2 10 but he said unto her thou speak it as one of the foolish women speak it what shall we receive good at the hand of God and shall we not receive evil in all this job did not sin with his lips job 13 15. though he slay me yet will I trust him but I will maintain my own ways before him praise the Lord may God bless the word that he has given to us and may he give us wisdom and understanding by the great Holy Spirit father we come this morning together as a people as a family of God gathered here with you your Invisible Presence that's here to confirm your word we welcome you and we feel privileged that we are invited to enter into your presence your August presence your Royal presence of our great and invisible King father as we enter the gates of this great kingdom of God May the Holy Spirit take the word of God and may the word of God go through our hearts go through our lines go through our souls father and bring our hearts to an understanding and to the light of the word for this day for we ask it in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you please be seated when you are I want a quote from Brother Branham out of an old message that he preached many years ago actually 1957 and the message is called Divine love my life has been a mysterious one that is true people don't understand it see but it's been because I just loved him when God seen fit to take my wife baby and everything I had they never thought of my my little baby my wife was a corpse my baby started dying I ran down to the hospital fell down before God I said God don't take my little darling don't do it Lord I know he was going to take her then Satan spoke to me he said Yonder in the mark lays your wife 23 years old here's your nine-month-old baby and he's taken that and you mean you'll serve him then I looked down and said though he slay me yet I'll serve him for something happened down in my bosom that made a love for him that the Bible said there's nothing present neither Triumph or nothing can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ if he would send me to torment at the day of judgment he is still just and if I have the mind that I have now while I am in hell I'll still love him why it's a part of me amen that's what it is that's what it is to you friend that loves the Lord that's what I want him to be a part of you love amen praise the name of the Lord God bless every one of you here today I'd like to take first subject here shaped by suffering shaped by suffering trials trouble tribulation trespasses shaped by God using that to shape us and form us and to make us what we want to be what he wants us to be praise the name of the Lord amen now Revelation chapter 1. now here we see Jesus is walking up and down amidst the candlesticks right he's walking up and down among the great candlesticks and you know the seven candlesticks were made of solid gold solid gold and a shape like that and I want to bring that to your attention it was made of pure gold and he was walking up and down among those candlesticks many times we want to think in our hearts does Jesus care he is walking up and down the golden candlesticks that are right there before him we understand that that is how our God cares for us the prophet preached The Marvelous message he cares do you care amen so we must understand that so character in the Bible is likened to pure gold and the reason why there's a scarcity of character especially in this day in which we live therefore it's valuable if someone has pure Godly Christian character now you may say there are men in the world that have character but that is a different kind of character that's produced by the flesh that's produced by human nature when we speak of character we talking about the character of Christ now Christ in you that character is what God is looking for he's looking for his Gene he's looking for his attribute in you because you of yourself cannot produce these Seven Virtues impossible you cannot and this is just a part of his character that he revealed for us no get to know him because God is so wide the heavens of Heavens can't contain him and the different facets of his personality as the great Diamond described by the prophet tells us we know that this is just a portion of him but the fact is true genuine character can only come by the gene of God that was or is already in you I'm preaching so you get to know more of yourself of who you really are I want you to realize what God is doing in our lives that we are here with God's divine plan and we are here for a purpose we are not here to wonder about we are not here to drift about we are what we are here following God's word a god with a plan God is not a god of Chaos or confusion but he is not a god of systems he has his own the world has his systems and it's working perfectly they may look at the field and say oh that's terrible I gotta get all these weeds out I'll move it and I'll make a beautiful lawn that's man-made to your eyes this looks beautiful but when God looks on a field with the flowers nodding their heads the perfume spilling on a breeze and and the beauties of the different colors of those flowers out there to him that's Beauty Amen to any real artist that's Beauty not a cultured lawn with the man plants this hair takes something God put on the mountain bring it down and put it in the valley and and then calls that beauty that's just Satan in the spirit of rebellion putting it on men causing them to do that amen now that don't say brother Simon told you not to keep your lawn anymore all right yeah I'm just in passing before you take me and go out there and take my word saying that you're supposed to leave it natural and let it go that's just as much as if I should tell the sisters don't fix your hair right leave it natural right just leave it however it is but that's not what I'm talking about now so we understand of course that um character was liking to gold and the golden candlesticks as you know uh were really made by workers whom God had told uh you know told Moses told Solomon and them I am going to anoint men with the ability to shape gold and I'm gonna make them into Craftsmen that can handle gold let them go and make these candlesticks and any other golden um vessels that is needed for the Tabernacle now I won't stop on that but that's typing the various Ministries fivefold Ministries as God has in this church that differ in shape and form in expression in every way possible now we see that but in actual fact he was using a type of himself because God himself is a greatest person to shape your character he's the greatest worker in gold and he can shape and make anything better than anybody else right so Jehovah was just uh showing himself symbolizing that he is the one that truly shapes and forms character wherever it really is but you know character light gold must go through Refinery before you can do anything with it other than that it's just a piece of rock or metal in your hand but it has to pass through refinery and that is where Satan gets a lot of believers they feel they can become Christians and somehow they got a prize without running the race they got a testimony without having tests uh that believe that they come to Christians to Christ and it's all joy and peace and happiness but not castings and trials but God using the type of job using the figures of what I'm speaking of is letting us know every son every daughter every child must be chastened everyone has got to surrender themselves so that they can be shaped and formed by the word is this making sense to you praise the Lord so God has to First Prospect uh ministers again find the gold wherever it's hidden in the dirt right not that ground this ground there are millions out there the ministers need to take the word use it as a filter and find those elect that are hidden in human flesh and uh hidden in the dirt and and then that's the job isn't done you're a Christian now you're going to heaven you're going into Rapture you believe the message you believe the prophet you're going in the Rapture no you now have you've just come out of all the dirt all the world all the flesh all the devil all the influences all the environment that was around you and now you have got to be refined by the fires of God and our God is a consuming fire future home of the Heavenly bride amen Earthly bright uh the Earthly bright and Heavenly bridegroom he says look the fires of God is coming he says to burn up not the Earth but it's also it's a spiritual fire it will burn up even devils in the atmosphere amen it'll burn up germs Devils everything else and so when the Holy Spirit in the form of the word set on fire or revealed to you comes to your mind comes to your heart it begins to transform you hit me against the burn up your old ideas it begins to burn up the germs the tries to Lodge in your mind and in your heart and begins to purify you and begins to refine you to bring you in to the perfect character of Jesus Christ not you're going out and trying to work to bring that character because if you're born a human you don't have to work to be a human you automatically as you mature you walk into that role of being a human being you start acting like one even when you don't think you're acting like one you're still acting like one because that's who you are so so God brought us here and this is why he has a bride there are Saints everywhere I don't want to go into the book of life but you know the book of life has classes in it where where you have the bright class of sense which is the highest form because they're going to sit behind it beside him in the throne Prophet said and then there are going to be others in The Book of Life that's going to be saved too not in the bright but Faith too but they will be like servants you have some going to be guards you got the 144 000 and have their other duties and so on so so we understand now don't get this idea that oh we're in the bright we're the only one going to be saved no you see light your thoughts so you know I'm the only one God says no I got seven thousand to hit not you don't know about that you don't worry about that worry about your group that has to get in there now I'm gonna deal with the others right so understand that clearly praise the Lord so now we see God has got to now refine us he's got to take us and refine us like that for his glory now I was reading where Michelangelo was seen every day as he was passing by he would stop by a big rock that was by the side of the road and keep looking at it and looking at them people wondered why every time he passed by he would look at this rock keep looking at the Rock and they don't know what was he thinking is he going mad is he crazy those every Sunday they're coming to look in the word my every Sunday Bible Prophet message work every Sunday they're staring at that what are they coming here for what is Michelangelo looking at that rock and somebody had the courage one day to ask him why are you looking at the Rock every day like that and he answered them and says because when I look I see an angel in that rock when God looks at you no matter how rough your exterior might seem no matter what or what you went through no matter not the rough situations you might have endured God sees an angel in that rock in other words he is seeing his Gene he is seeing his elect seed in that rock and now he's going to refine that he's gonna work with it to bring out what is in it the beauty in it the grace in it the power of God in it pays good Hallelujah God will work with it to bring that out that he might glorify his name amen do you believe that [Applause] [Music] oh praise God praise God praise God that is why we are here hallelujah we love to sing them songs but sing with your understanding to be like Jesus to be like Jesus on Earth I long to be like him all True Lies Journey from Earth to Glory I only ask to be like him so you see it's not taken virtue and adding one on top of the other until you come to the top of the pyramid and then you get born again no it's not like that that adding Peter was talking about is like a sheep that as they eat the word as they eat what they're supposed to eat amen they grow into a mature sheep and then they automatically start to bring forth the wall they don't have to work at bringing it Forward oh I don't have this virtue I don't have that I do not no no no no no no you have him in you in baby form in seed form and now the seed begins to grow as the moisture of the Waters of the word of God from the River of Life sweeps over your soul it begins to cause that seed to germinate and as the gene of God begins to germinate it it reproduces as a seed after its kind its kind as the Christ's kind it's a bright kind it's God's child's kind it can't help it it's got to become seen back to sin seed after its kind hallelujah praise God and God can only have fellowship with his own children is that right do you think that a man can have real fellowship with a parrot just quoting quotes you think you're going to have fellowship with a monkey that just tries to copy the prophet where the buckles and the blue jeans and stand and move like him and rather talk like him no you don't have fellowship with or a monkey that is caught up with dazzling stuff and shiny things you know catching your eyes and no no no it's not like that you see you get a goat bring sport goat she brings forth sheep and God brings forth what Jesus said it he said you are Gods Not Capital God of course but common little ones amen and those were the little ones that were in him the logos the great one before the foundation of the world and they were in him because you can't be Eternal now if you're really eternal you there was never a time when you were not there will never be a time when you will not be for Eternal means without the beginning and without an ending and we know that God is the only eternal then if God is the only Eternal you are in him before the foundations of the world I repeat you are not creatures of time amen we are now caught in the TR the Trap the prison of time because of these bodies we were in we come down from the presence of God like Daniel said I saw trolls and crumbs cast down upon the Earth hallelujah praise God and here we find ourselves trapped in human bodies and God now because Satan now through multiplication caused the whole world to be filled with billions of people and the the goodness mixed in with the false and the true and everything else and so Jesus had to come and save the Lost lost somebody had you so you so you that's how you got lost right you you couldn't be lost if if no one owned you or you want it like that he came because you are in him I come for the lost sheep they were in him so he comes for you for me praise God a part of him is in you that's why Prophet prayed son spoken word The Original Seed so we are Eternal beings trapped in a body of time it's not right we are uh we are souls imprisoned now but by the opening of the word just what happened in Jerusalem when he rose from the dead at the rising of the Sun the word also Rose and it broke the bars broke the shackles and command Satan who had you imprisoned in denominationalism imprisoned by your own thoughts in your flesh with all kinds of thinking and everything else he took you out and made you walk around and we are still walking around and they're going to see us and after this we'll Ascend with him we'll go into the presence of the Living God praise the name of the Lord amen praise God hallelujah so God is seeing his own Gene inside of the rock this person is rough that don't mean nothing to God he's looking beyond all of that is that right oh praise God now let's go to the church age book and in the church age book there uh and I don't have the actual page number or whatever written here but I'm quoting him now the Lord God Almighty says I know there he is walking in the midst of the people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock and he says I know praise God my friends no matter what you are going through God knows all about it there is nothing secret to God that we can hide from him and you can say he doesn't know he said I know amen and he's walking up and down observing watching seeing what is going on because he's the chief Shepherd but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation does he not simply say I know your tribulation and I'm here to tell you this morning no matter what you have gone through no matter what you may be going through in the name of Jesus Christ God is saying from his word I know your tribulation right now at the present time not in the Bible but right now God says I know your tribulation that you are going through and I am not unmindful of your sufferings what a stumbling block that is to so many people amen oh because right the way the Devil comes that God is allowing us God is doing that you got to do that well it's not God doing it it's Satan doing it as you could see Satan is doing it but God had to leave him and say look I got to test this one but you you do you do that let me see how they're going to react action brother Brandon preach for a reaction right so now we see God is now allowing that by his word what does stumbling block this is to so many people like Israel amen like the Jews in the Holocaust oh my this is why what the uh blinded them they couldn't understand how how can Jehovah love us and leave us to suffer like this to burn us in in these ovens melt them our bodies to make soap uh to for the soldiers to use and burn them chop them up grind them every every possible uh thing you can think about they were doing to those uh their people like that and it became and is a great stumbling block and they wondered if God really loves them amen hallelujah and though you sometimes the devil will come to any and every one of us and say does Jesus care does he really love you if he loved you how could he allow this how could you let that happen but you've got to come to a place like Abraham came to when he says shall not the judge of the earth do right can God do anything wrong and if you allow this what am I all I got to do is put my faith my trust in him no matter how it looks no matter how I feel I put my trust in him no wonder job said though he is slam me yet will I trust him though he sent me to Hell Brother Brad himself I'm still gonna love him will you but the prophet said he took my wife he took my baby everything else oh my but though he slammed me yet will I trust him and though he put me in Hell yet will I trust him oh my you can feel like if you in hell on Earth while you were here amen praise God my goodness Hallelujah we find out here that we live in an age where this message has become a burden to a lot of people and I'm taking the thought from the fact of Malachi 1 3 because brother Branham mentions it here and when Malachi said the burden of the word of the Lord the word of the Lord has and is becoming a burden and that's because of lack of Revelation if the preachers don't have a revelation and can't convey to the people the life that's behind the veil of this word then it becomes boring it becomes something of human effort it's not something of the spirit of the Living God hallelujah I'm not talking about what they call the spirit which is music beat up music can get you to the state where you feel you're in the spirit by emotion and everything else I'm talking about the word itself when it lights up that puts you into the real joy that puts you into the real emotions of the spirit of God not of us working ourselves up into the music and all of that that's not what it is at all but back to the word here praise the Lord so we find out the burden of the word of the Lord because the word of God has become a burden to Israel why is all these preachers uh prophets come in and rebuking us why are they saying this or saying that or saying the other amen praise God uh uh why why why do pray I have to do this uh I have to do that to believe the word I've got to do this I've got to do that so the word becomes a burden to the people of burden in the hearts of the real Believers amen so they end up fussing and fighting with the very word of God and yet claiming to be bride amen yes sir but God wants a bride with cancer he wants one with his seed in him who loves him and loves the unfolding revelation of the word of God you know the prophet said the seals don't just open like that like a Roman Candlestick it opens it opens it and keeps going Higher and Higher and Higher by the Holy Spirit not man's study not not all the 24 hours of study and I spent all night with the Midnight Oil and all that brother sister uh you know if I might call people Pharisee the Pharisees you are the Jews I receive this Not By Any Man calling me to the ministry I was sleeping as a child of 12 years old and a man appeared to me and at 14 not being a member of any church felt the pulsation to preach preach the word and a Revival broke out this is a Pentecostal church with over 2 500 members still sitting there in Guyana South America where I'm from still there it's still there praise God no I just I'm saying that that you might understand I'm not just talking words but we were praying as young men five six hours a day we're studying the Bible fasting 10 days 20 days 21 days 40 days fast and I'm real fast not eating and fasting but with water only and this type of thing like that and God sent us a prophet God sin of prophet God send a prophet okay then hear about the prophet and the word came and things changed and the Holy Spirit began to move in a different way altogether because back then being under a miracle type of ministry where demons were being cast out the sick were being healed and souls were being saved stuff of that nature amen praise God and then the message came and all of a sudden I wasn't seeing all those signs Once In Miracles like before but I started to get a rich understanding of what God was doing in this day and in this hour and it sounds so strange to some of the others that they something is wrong with you what what are you talking about you see they couldn't see it as yet some are just getting a glimmer of it and a glimpse others don't want to do nothing with it but let me tell you something friends this is the old time religion and summing up wanted but I want to hold to God's unchanging hands God wants us to surrender ourselves to him that we can be molded by him in his refinery formed and shaped as a bride ready for her husband I'm just throw a few thoughts here remember the boys in the fiery furnace yes you understand what that type is now God loving them to be in the fiery furnace the devil throwing them in a fiery furnace but God allowing it that's what Daniel was saying you think if oh God wants us to go in the furnace we will go and if we don't he don't want us to go we ain't gonna go you can't do anything about it it's whatever he wants that's what's gonna happen amen and then if we want us to go in the furnace then I don't have to worry he knows what he is doing and when the king look he saw there was a fourth man in the fire he was there there with them all the time I want you to know he is there with you all the time no matter what you're going through he's all the time he is with you oh God in the shadows watching over his own what love that God has given to us brother Billy Paul told me he says you know um Danny told me uh you know I wanted to see the angel and he said to me he says the angel has already told me you stay back over there and then don't just take your hands off your eyes like that do it slowly he says and when I did that slowly there was this man 250 pounds ants folded white garments just looking at me from behind just standing near the drips of the hotel window and just looking at me I looked at him he looked at me then all of a sudden he formed into a ball of fire that begins to world and then it Whirled and went right up through the window and up into the heavens amen and I want to say just like that you may be in a room all by yourself but God is standing somewhere in the shadows watching over his own watching over his own amen praise God hallelujah I'm so glad one like unto the son of man is here with us and but whatever furnace you're going through whatever uh whatever Foundry you are in a man a one like unto the son of man and it had to say that way at that time because he was still in a theophany state condescending down to the flesh that we know as Jesus Christ right this condescension was taking place from the Garden of Eden to Melchizedek Melchizedek ciafani forming itself Pillar of Fire on Angel of the Covenant coming down until it comes to its fullness in Jesus Christ amen now again brother bran was speaking in the unveiling of the Mighty God he says now like a man building Chimes or making Chimes the Mulder takes each Bell and each Bell has got to have a different ring from the other do you believe that every one of us is a different personality God can reflect himself in a million ways through every one of us through his uh let me use the term his great prism of light God can express and manifest himself in so many ways and so God the prophet speaking of God molding our character like one who is molding Bells right listen oh my the same material see so much iron so much still so much brass to give it that right thing that right ring see my that's the way God did he bred this one battle to the other one metal to the other one until he got exactly what he wanted that's how he come down he unveiled himself in a perfect fire then you come down through them prophets then into the Son of God which was God himself it was the same God bringing himself out exactly from Perfection to Perfection from Glory unto glory and that's the way the church goes amen he bring himself all the way down through Jesus Christ now it's your turn now it's your turn not Jesus in the Gethsemane there but you in the Gethsemane here you now having to pass through certain things that God has in store for you amen praise the name of the Lord God remember brother Branham said we are God called God trained God sent in the denomination my friends that we find out they call you for training and you get your training and then they call you to the ministry right and then they'll send you out but God's doing differently you actually get your uh you get your training rate on the job right you got your training through experience you'll get your training in the School of Hard Knocks is that right instead of learning psychology makes you learn neology yeah he passes you through his school where he shapes you informed every believer to his perfect will every one of you in here is unique everyone is different brother Branham I think he mentions that God never met two things of the same kind in the same way ever that's why he is the he's a master he's the master of masterpieces and everything he puts out is a masterpiece you believe that the ears on your head everyone is different every ant every leaf every every snowflake is different because it comes from the master's hands your unique praise God there is nobody else like you on this Earth but I have a twin to Man's eyes they call that twin but not the God he knows every individual he knows all your likes your dislikes and everything else like that you're absolutely different from everybody else so I want you to have the confidence in yourself amen say together let's say it I am unique [Applause] praise God you are the only one that God made like the way he made you and let me praise God that's why Paul said don't compare yourself with anybody else there's nobody else like you is that right what do you compare yourself nobody else like you praise God but don't think too highly of yourselves too so God is telling us that he forges his family his his sons and daughters in his furnace you are being forged in the furnace of fire no wonder they Apostle says count it all joy when when you are allowed to pass through the fiery trials for the trying of your faith work at patience God is working something out God has a plan and you trust him in whatever he is doing praise the name of the Lord amen praise God hallelujah yes sir God wants us to surrender ourselves to be molded right in to the Rapture listen now this Bible is full of gold nuggets oh my and I just like to prospect you see when he talks people were reading these things it just sounds like he's just oh it's just this is not the real deep uh gospel here this is not deep Revelation here he's just talking about the fox or some squirrel on a branch or something but if you've got spiritual mind and eyes and the Revelation hits your soul you realize he was teaching by object lessons he was teaching in this way and you've got to understand what he's saying that you might uh read between the lines that you might understand not what the word that you may see written what what is the innuendos what is the what what is the underlying truth that is under there without the spirit of God reveal that to you by the great Holy Spirit now watch see the prospector goes and just got in there see then he'll try to shake all the dust off of that thing and God is trying to shake all the dust off of you praise God I don't know about you but I got a lot of dust on me and I gotta shake it off amen even dogs know that they go like this and you know trying to shake off all the dust and we're gonna shake off the dust from yourselves amen praise God hallelujah now the jewels God's jewels oh my great Jewels but where do they come from from the dust of the Earth amen where do you come from the dust to the earth oh my all the stuff we're mixed up in and everything else like that but we had to come from the dust of the earth you don't condemn and judge yourself because I did this and I did that and I was here and I was that God don't care about those things amen God come to shake you up from the dust of the earth that you might look away into Jesus amen hallelujah I see Jesus only oh praise God now God's Jewels are brought out always from the dust do you believe that hallelujah we're so happy and he gives us the privilege of taking us into his refineries amen thank God he brought me in to his Refinery we are so happy that he gives us that privilege and that is that he might get all of the draws out you are once in the dirt he brought you out the dirt but some of that dirt somehow end up inside you so he got to pass you through the refinery to get the dirt that is on the inside of you in your heart in your mind in your life in your habits the environment shape you and and your friends your peers shape you your parents different habits they might have uh it don't mean that we're perfect they just try to do the best they could they shaped you but there might be things God wants to check them out of us he wants to get the draft out of us amen all of it and to take it out listen now we know before there were smelters how they used to refine gold we learned that from the Indians the old Indians used to take the gold and beat it my they used to take the gold and beat it put it on a rock take another rock and keep beating on that gold day after day you come into church at one stage I used to do the same thing and I'm taking the word and beating on you beating on you beating on you notice Masters will and do it not shall be beaten with many stripes right praise God but you see God in this great wisdom was trying to shape us form us give you patience give your temperance allow all these virtues to begin to come out automatically not by human effort not by you know well God says if we slap you on his cheek you're supposed to turn your other cheek and some devil get on a man who comes with a big hard shoes stomp on your toe looking in the face and begins to grind your toe and he said well and then he slaps you on this one well the Bible says I I need to you know slap you on the other cheek so stop doing the uh and you're repressing yourself you're not being yourself if you were a real self you would say what you think you're doing at all your pain right like the old Italian gentleman said he says you hit my nose I break out your face your rights end right on the tip of my nose if if your hands stop there that's fine that's your right you can move it wherever but once it hit my nose I break your face so therefore we understand that God tests us trains us and shapes Us in the furnace of this word amen you see they beat the drop draws out of it amen and so they beat it and they kept beating it until the bitter of that gold can see his reflection in it see he says remember that until he can see himself reflected in the gold that he was beating on he is not going to stop he's going to keep beating until he see Jesus in you reflected until he sees his character reflected in you and I so you said oh why did God do this no something in you is trying to come up take out from you praise God hallelujah I know this is not the kind of preaching that makes you so happy and everything else like that praise God this kind of preaching is not the amen kind you know Hallelujah you see what God is doing is beating all the world out of us and that's what he wants to do to his church to beat it like that to get the world up so that we may reflect him his life in US amen praise the name of the Lord that's what he's doing because he is the example or example he is our author and the finisher of our faith amen he is the alpha in your Miracle is that right he is the one who starts the race and he's going to finish the race he's finishing it now praise the name of the Lord God hallelujah I'm thinking of a man from I think it was Kenya that Tanzania was in the Olympics and I think he was running um some mile or 22 miles or something and everybody passed him so many times and he was the last and and somebody says why didn't you drop out he kept running and the whole field people ask seeing him it's like embarrassed man he's still running running until he finished the race and they interviewed him and said well why you kept running everybody else ran ahead the races already finished and everything else he said because my country didn't send me here to start the race they sent me here to finish the race and we are here to finish this race that we are in here now we are here to finish the race can you say Amen do you believe that we are here to finish this race amen oh there are many you know what song is that I just got that flash in my my thought let's go let's sing it amen praise the Lord you don't mind praise the name I am going through Lord I am going through ah no whatever others do I'll take the way with the Lord's despise you I started out with Jesus and I am and the verse that struck my mind they're all there are men need start in the race but with the light refuse to keep peace others except it because it is new but not very many expect to go but I am going through Lord I am going through I'll pay the price whatever others do I'll take the way with the Lord's despise you I started out with Jesus I'm going through thanks be to God we're the last man standing last woman standing you see there was the uh Marathon I think a road race here in Burlington just last Sunday it starts out in Hamilton you see thousands of people when you come to the end of the race just few just few Crossing in that finish line all the rest dropped out this happened that happened whatever the accident they dropped out they get too thirsty whatever distracted but very few make it over the finish line and brothers we are thank God we are here amen sometimes you'll stretch to your limit but God no he knows how much Temptation how much trial we can take and he is watching over his own praise the name of the Lord hallelujah oh my I love that that God took the uh he took the figure of bells be informed and forged in the fire of his Refinery the prophet said and God forges them until that Bell begins to get that thing that ring it gets a certain ring in it praise the name of the Lord and you know sometimes they set up music with different bells of different tones and he may take a piece of stick and hit one Bell another Bell and they're making music with the Bell is that right and God is a great uh one who knows the great composer who knows how to take his word coming through different men different bells and many things things things each one has its own ring and together making a great Harmony or to the hands of the Great pause up don't you hear the bells now ringing can't you hear the angels singing there's a Glory Hallelujah Jubilee [Music] in that far off sweet forever just beyond that shining River when they ring those gold and bells for you and me can't your hair those bells now ringing can't you hear the angels singing there's a Glory Hallelujah you believe in that power of sweet forever just beyond The Shining River when they ring them golden bells for you and me amen see the burden of the word of the Lord God even said I have loved you said the Lord yet you said to me uh how do you love me yet you understand what's not Jacob Esau Jacob's brother yet I love Jacob but hated Esau would God hit a little baby think about it God loved Jacob but hated Esau and he said before they were even born before the Forge the little baby is in the spirits are not are ageless right it's not baby Spirit and the adults no no no nothing of the kind so therefore he knows what spirit is in this one and what spirit is in the other one and he hate the one and loved the other not because it's a baby or it's an adult or it's a this or that but because of the in other words let me say it this way God loves his jeans and hates the serpent seeds God loves his jeans but he hates serpent seeds and he sees them before you do or I do or anybody knows anything about it God says I love Jacob but he hated Esau Esau the prophet said outwardly look like such a gentleman love his old daddy killed dear first daddy makes two for his daddy and he's always around his daddy taking care of him and Esau Jacob like a rascal and he said like a renegade running out there and doing every possible thing he can do and pulling tricks and smart man and pulling schemes and everything else he outwardly he looked like the red again and the Rascal amen and the other one look righteous this happens in the church a lot of people that knows how to put on the Christian Act you know I'm still preaching now but but this is done to Earth preaching is that right this is not one up that puts your head up in the heavens you get two spiritually minded you know Earthly good it just puts you to a place where a lot of people sit in the church their knows exactly the proper length of skirt they're supposed to wear whatever whatever they know exactly so they have they act on and they know how to walk how to talk how to to be able to even though they're mad at you how to hold their Temple and still look Pleasant and then as soon as you're gone something else flares up out there oh no the real Christian is who they are brother Branham said be simple be humble be reverent and God will bless you just be yourself is that right but we're not supposed to get angry who said so Paul said be angry but sin not you want to tell me somebody do something that you're not happy but you're not going to be angry you might be angry but you try to hide the angle but the Bible doesn't tell you that be yourself we who you are let the Holy Spirit teach you if not first you outwardly think like that God will begin to work on that amen and that's what a lot of people they hide up all their faults so nobody can help them nobody can pray for them this is a secret thing this is a over there hidden up no allow the Holy Spirit to deal with you praise the name of the Lord I'll know when to stop don't worry about that praise the name of the Lord amen praise the name of the Lord so that's exactly what it is God knows his genes wherever they are remember the parable of the sore and the seed the good man sowed seeds in this field God's intention at the whole human race uh from Adam and Eve would have comfort by his word and his way they would have all been spoken word right they will be informed by the spoken word because God was creating everything by his Spoken Word by faith we understand the worlds were framed by the word of God so it would have been by the spoken word but Satan changed it right and and he changed the entire thing that God has God's reproduction by his spoken word amen Satan change it and therefore created confusion upon the Earth God put now is showing what he intended the good man he says telling a parable had a field and in the field he just put good seeds but in the night an enemy came and he planted weeds and tears amidst all of these good seeds and that's the problem God now has to come the Great Eagle has to fly over and scream and cry out to find his genuine seed missed all the tears that are out there it's got to search and find them and so it's there so but God knows what is tears and what is the true seed and he loved one but he hit the other right he loves one and he hits the other oh praise God forevermore oh my think of it Jacob God says I love you and he was suffering I hate you and he was prospering is that right the Bible talks about all the words and all the this and that that he gotten all his father's natural resources Esau got it all he inherited all of that and they are going to inherit almost everything down here they're gonna inherit it and you're gonna Wonder but I'm Godly I pay my times I do this I do that and I just seem to be getting on yeah look this is their time this is their world this is their stuff not that God God doesn't want to bless us I have a series on preaching that so don't worry about that I'm leaving that now the point is God wants you to keep your eyes on him and all other things will be added on to you is that right put your eyes on him and all the rest of the material things are going to be added on to you twins in the beginning twins in the end twins in in Eve's womb back there twins in the church room at the end here you believe that oh my and yet the one has to rub shoulders with the other and say God bless you my brother God bless you my sister and you know that the devil back of that Veil dealing with the Devil in my case because of the Holy Spirit I shook hands with people and they're up in the air and they fall on the ground and the devil begins to manifest what can you do that's the way it is God works his own purposes out for his glory amen praise the Lord you see quoting brother Brandon I'm going to bring this to an end soon now he says here you see the problem was they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering right they thought that love meant baby love with parental care in other words God should surround them with his power and and take care of them with parental care like that in other words what he's referring to there I'm going to try to make a picture of that every time the baby whimpers a Christ any natural mother doesn't matter you might think he's in a deep sleep but if that baby only go he's up right away she's built that way she's right there to meet that baby that's what he's referring to that Christians think God is like that that he just respond to baby love and a baby whimpering and baby crying and some babies that can't get their own way I am going to command God I'm gonna make God give me this and God give me that so I'm gonna scream I'm gonna stomp I'm gonna carry on he says I'll tell you you do that you gonna sure get a tanning from from the Sun and not that one up there but Mr branham's son down here oh my stomping and carrying on like that God doesn't give us that kind of baby love no that's not what it is whimpering crying and screaming but the Press of God's love is an election that he elected you that you would be one of his own that you would come to him see see God said his love was an elective love and the proof of his love is his election and no matter what happens amen that was his love in other words no matter what happened from the time you're born to the day you die you must understand that you are not one in a million one in billions that God chose to be one of his own that is his love and he's saying what you may suffer in between this temporary period of time that you live whether it be a hundred and 120 years God bless you if you live that long but if you live that long what you go through there is nothing to be compared with the glory that is to follow amen that is why those Apostles said come to the all joy when you pass through these fiery trials I'm not saying it feels good when you're going through it and you may even say brother Simon it's good for you to say are you not passing through what I'm passing through man let's change places and let me hear how are you going to scream well I I don't know but I know God built each one of us to Bear exactly what we are supposed to bear it's in the scripture he's not going to allow us to be tempted tested tried beyond what we can take praise God look there's an engineer there he knows about pressure testing under pressure test pipes rubber hoses the pressure test things right to the limit to see how much pumps per square is that thinking take amen and when they know it's in a perfect position then they pass the test and God will do the same for every one of us we're going to be pressure tested if we haven't been already he's going to pressure test you you say oh I I already got tested up there look till you leave this world all right tests are going to come and the one that's coming is stronger than the one you had before because he is maturing you to a higher level until after a while you come like job like brother Brandon it doesn't matter what test he brings God Knows Best God is working things out I said God is working things out no matter what happens in your life God is working things out everything is going to be all right you're hurting me there that's not Bob Marley this is me saying it everything is going to be all right because God is working things out praise God hallelujah you can't see the end from the beginning but no matter how it looks God standing in his Shadows is working things out for you for his glory amen just think of it his love is frozen proven by the fact you were chosen unto salvation you are chosen unto salvation and of the spirit and belief of the truth of the word of God I'm going to end Here Right Now Praise the name of the Lord God bless every one of you here I know that kind of abrupt but um that's not the end of the message but uh I'm gonna end now and let's just worship sing praise the Lord and let us chew on our cods like brother Branham say after you heard the word just sit under that tree and and just think on these things and let it come down into your soul and if you are passing through the chilly Waters or the Muddy Waters of Trials chess tribulation Temptation then this message was to was presented here to speak to you and to comfort you and knowing that God is watching you watching what you're going through and he knows every element of it and he knows exactly how to bring you out of it amen so regardless of what it is God is working things out do you believe that if you believe it let's say it God is working things out say it again God is working things out God is working things out for me every tangle of life he will undo everything he will undo it just place your life in this plan stay secure in his hands for God's he is working things out blessed be the name of the Lord may God shape every one of us through testing trial whatever he has in mind may he bless us and keep every one of us praise the Lord let's have a song There Brother [Music] I am going through I hear the price foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] goodbye [Music] [Applause] I'll take it away [Music]
