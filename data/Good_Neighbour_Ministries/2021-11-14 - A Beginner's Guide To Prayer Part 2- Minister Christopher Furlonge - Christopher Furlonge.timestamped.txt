[25:11] then
[25:12] me and alex went and brought my wife
[25:15] from hotel

[25:19] so in the evening service that was our
[25:21] last church
[25:23] the lord lay on my heart i preached the
[25:25] message right there about 10 people
[25:27] wanted to get baptized
[25:30] so
[25:31] i told them okay you're gonna get
[25:33] baptized
[25:35] i went
[25:36] with my wife the next day friday with
[25:38] alex to go to my village to
[25:41] do my mommy
[25:42] sell money things pay for everything i
[25:45] had the money with me while we were
[25:47] going he forgot to put the
[25:49] radiator water in the radiator the car
[25:53] was on smoke on the way it was getting
[25:55] to evening so i bought my head all the
[25:58] money is with me
[25:59] about my head and i pray to the lord i
[26:02] said lord your servant need help
[26:05] and as soon as i lift up my eye i saw a
[26:08] man sitting on the motorbike coming
[26:10] he came
[26:12] help us
[26:13] everything was done we reached our home
[26:16] my village eight o'clock
[26:18] we slept there the next day i have to
[26:21] come with my wife
[26:22] to the city again because sunday i have
[26:25] to preach far less i came back
[26:28] preached sunday
[26:29] so
[26:31] then 10 people that wanted to be
[26:33] baptized
[26:35] another four was
[26:36] sorry trey was added
[26:38] from the tailoring shop the seamstress
[26:41] shop
[26:42] so we go
[26:45] baptizing them in the water when we read
[26:47] there there was so many crowds
[26:49] different churches
[26:51] wanted to baptize their people but
[26:54] i don't care bosses and every
[26:57] so many groups
[26:59] so i went to the water
[27:01] expressing the word of god to the people
[27:04] began to baptize in them
[27:07] while i was baptizing them i felt to
[27:09] tell them hey jesus is the only way
[27:12] jesus is the one true god
[27:14] you have to baptize in his name heaven
[27:17] and head there's no name whereby we must
[27:19] be saved
[27:20] they believe like that baptizing the
[27:22] power of god just me and are less on the
[27:25] water the power of god was right in the
[27:28] water there
[27:30] touching the people
[27:32] as soon as they get out they're
[27:34] screaming
[27:35] crying one lady big lady that fall on
[27:39] the ground
[27:40] crying crying she get up then all of a
[27:43] sudden speaking in tongues
[27:45] the power of god was upon her and god
[27:48] began to say it's me that is doing that
[27:51] i'm calling all of you come out
[27:54] and
[27:55] the prophecy was going forth like that i
[27:57] was still baptizing the people and the
[28:00] denomination two were baptizing their
[28:02] people i didn't know that it was
[28:05] they were baptizing father son holy
[28:07] ghost and i was screaming and telling
[28:09] them to baptize in jesus name why i
[28:11] didn't know
[28:14] my wife was standing there even he
[28:16] recorded some a little bit for
[28:19] speaking my language both english and
[28:21] whichever way the lord is deleting on
[28:24] the word of god
[28:25] because god understands all languages as
[28:28] this one said
[28:29] so
[28:30] while we were there there's a rich man
[28:32] pastor someone and i friend
[28:35] a
[28:36] wealthy man in the country
[28:38] and i went and visited him
[28:41] and while visiting me says when i was
[28:43] going he says
[28:45] let's pray i bow my head with him pray
[28:47] for him told him about my mommy he says
[28:49] i'm coming i have about six minutes i'm
[28:52] checking the time
[28:54] and why
[28:56] he told me he will come to the phone so
[29:00] i was thinking maybe he won't come
[29:01] because he's too
[29:04] rich and
[29:05] powerful so in terms of financial
[29:07] distance
[29:09] so
[29:10] during the day of my mom she was coming
[29:14] and
[29:19] big brother and i saw him
[29:22] sitting down there he turned to my
[29:24] brother
[29:26] he says
[29:27] do you realize what person you have in
[29:30] your the family
[29:32] he turned to my big brother he says
[29:34] let me tell you
[29:37] through this your brother
[29:39] i am becoming a christian he already
[29:42] told me he started going to church
[29:44] and i told him i says the broadway
[29:47] churches jesus is not there jesus was
[29:50] born where she was born so when you go
[29:52] into jesus you have to close your eyes
[29:55] because that place think
[29:57] all your clothes gonna be stink
[29:59] stink like sheep so that's where you
[30:01] find jesus
[30:03] and oh i said so many things i preached
[30:06] to him very hard
[30:07] so he turned to my brother and says
[30:10] let me tell you sick person they are
[30:13] born into a family one in a season
[30:16] and he says because of him
[30:19] i believe i will become a strong
[30:21] christian for the lord of the word of
[30:23] god
[30:25] and it was powerful to me it wasn't joke
[30:28] i go my mommy ceremony was going on
[30:32] that time
[30:34] they called me to the top the priest set
[30:36] me beside him big church almost closed

[30:51] boys sitting in the church they come
[30:52] back to me outside they says what you

[46:07] of prayer amen
[46:09] was taken from
[46:11] james 4 and 2 amen
[46:15] you don't have to turn to it but if you
[46:17] would like to very
[46:19] short
[46:20] i think it's seven words
[46:22] you do not have
[46:24] because you do not ask amen hallelujah
[46:29] you do not have
[46:31] because you do not have so god is
[46:34] instructing us
[46:35] to ask
[46:37] that we should have
[46:39] amen you all may be seated may god bless
[46:42] this world today amen
[46:45] we can go to slide two
[46:50] and i'd like to take a little reading
[46:52] from our prophet
[46:54] amen
[46:57] which is the word of god for our
[47:01] for us today
[47:04] and he's instructing us
[47:08] and i tell you don't let the world creep
[47:12] into you
[47:14] and what is the world worldliness
[47:17] so it's instructing us don't let
[47:20] worldliness creep into us

[47:25] churches

[47:31] fast it out until god comes down and
[47:35] take
[47:36] hold that's right keep the joy of the
[47:40] lord
[47:42] among the saints

[47:48] and guard every little place
[47:52] now if noah seen a leak in his ark

[48:03] know to keep the leak out

[48:10] man
[48:12] it's to stop up the leak the best thing
[48:14] that i know how to do
[48:15] the only way to do it that is
[48:20] prayer
[48:22] so you got to fortify yourself with
[48:26] amen and that's what it's all about

[52:32] could you go to
[52:33] the
[52:35] the other slide please thank you
[52:39] hallelujah
[52:41] okay we
[52:42] we we just want to conti we spoke about
[52:45] we are wired to pray amen amen
[52:49] so in every human being just want to
[52:52] recap a little bit amen
[52:56] we spoke about amen we are wired to pray
[52:59] so in every human being there is a
[53:01] desire to pray
[53:04] amen
[53:05] in some form or the other you know
[53:07] everybody prays
[53:08] the muslim praise the hindu all
[53:10] religions oh they'd have some form of
[53:12] prayer and worship amen hallelujah
[53:15] thank my brother
[53:18] hallelujah
[53:20] there's an internal desire into every
[53:23] human heart
[53:25] to pray
[53:26] in some form or the other because we
[53:29] were created in the image of god
[53:32] man to have that if there is a desire
[53:35] for us to project that deep inside of us
[53:38] calling to that deep amen so just got
[53:40] that deep to respond there is a god out
[53:43] there to respond to that desire that we
[53:45] have in our lives
[53:47] in our heart amen hallelujah
[53:50] and then we learn that we are not good
[53:52] at pray
[53:54] we don't know what to say amen
[53:56] we don't know how to say it
[53:58] you know we we feel so incompetent when
[54:01] we pray amen hallelujah and we said if i
[54:04] should call anybody up here to pray they
[54:07] will cringe
[54:08] because
[54:09] they will they're going to say i i'm not
[54:12] good enough to pray
[54:14] my words are not you know fluent you
[54:16] know my speech and i can't make a good
[54:18] presentation but god is not asking you
[54:21] about that
[54:23] you pray from your heart
[54:25] amen hallelujah thank you lord
[54:30] and you hear we spoke about
[54:33] jesus was the greatest teacher that
[54:35] passed through this world there was none
[54:37] greater than him
[54:40] preaching
[54:41] teaching and all that healing is sick
[54:44] and everything but his disciples didn't
[54:46] ask
[54:47] the lord
[54:48] for them to
[54:50] to teach us how to preach and teach and
[54:52] whatever and how to heal is sick what do
[54:55] you what do you what did the disciples
[54:57] ask
[54:59] teach us how to pray
[55:02] amen hallelujah
[55:05] thank you lord
[55:07] and we also learned our frustrations
[55:10] with prayer
[55:12] amen
[55:15] are caused by misconceptions
[55:19] amen
[55:20] there's a lot of misconceptions out
[55:23] there we just want to recap a few
[55:24] minutes just take a few minutes so you
[55:26] know repetition
[55:28] is the mother of learning
[55:31] and humans need to be reminded over and
[55:33] over again
[55:35] amen so if we tend to forget it's good
[55:38] to repeat sometimes
[55:40] amen to remind us to bring us back
[55:42] amen hallelujah
[55:44] man
[55:45] there are a lot of phony baloney ideas
[55:47] out there man
[55:49] a lot of lies myths and
[55:51] misunderstandings
[55:53] amen
[55:54] legends and misconceptions
[55:56] amen there are a lot of information
[55:58] that's
[55:59] information that are not simply true
[56:02] amen
[56:03] amen so a man developed all these things
[56:07] right
[56:08] and it led us astray for all these years
[56:11] that you got to pray in a certain way
[56:14] repeat certain words and everything like
[56:16] that amen
[56:18] for prayer but it's all misconceptions
[56:21] amen hallelujah amen praise god
[56:25] and
[56:26] when we don't do that we feel guilty
[56:29] amen we feel kind of guilty
[56:31] because we can't pray like how they pray
[56:35] and how they speak and how they bring
[56:37] forth these things amen god doesn't want
[56:40] you to feel guilty about prayer
[56:43] because prayer is a conversation with
[56:46] the almighty god
[56:50] hallelujah
[56:52] hallelujah
[56:54] move on to the next slide four please
[56:56] amen hallelujah and we also pray is not
[57:00] a magic one
[57:03] amen
[57:04] that you just wave it
[57:06] amen
[57:07] and everything is going to be all right
[57:12] amen
[57:13] amen hallelujah
[57:15] prayer is not magic
[57:17] amen or you say some
[57:19] some words some familiar abracadabra or
[57:24] some kind of uh concoction i mean we
[57:27] have a lot of that down in the islands
[57:30] and a lot of men you go up to them we
[57:32] call them we call them ob men
[57:35] and and and i i believe some people must
[57:38] be listening to that right now oh dear
[57:41] they know what is that
[57:42] we call them here i believe
[57:45] maybe
[57:46] witch doctors or something like that men
[57:50] but
[57:51] phillip there a lot of that in africa
[57:53] right a lot of that over there right by
[57:55] the husband oh yeah
[57:57] amen

[58:06] husband or your wife
[58:09] you just
[58:10] wave a wand over them and they just
[58:12] change instantly
[58:14] from a frog into a princess
[58:19] or something like that amen hallelujah

[1:04:59] anything
[1:05:01] according to our will
[1:05:04] oh i hope you're listening to this
[1:05:06] morning are you with me according to
[1:05:08] whose will
[1:05:10] according to his will
[1:05:13] so you're just not going to be asking
[1:05:14] any anything
[1:05:17] you've got to be asking according to his
[1:05:19] will
[1:05:20] to his perfect will for your life
[1:05:23] there's permissive will you could be
[1:05:25] bartering and begging and battering and
[1:05:27] everything and sometimes god because he
[1:05:29] said you see god is he keeps his water
[1:05:33] just because you ask us you say ask and
[1:05:35] it shall be given
[1:05:37] and and most a lot of times we ask
[1:05:40] for our own self according to our will
[1:05:42] remain and then god say you're asking
[1:05:44] but i got to give it to you
[1:05:46] but it's for your own detriment

[1:06:32] praise god it's not according to our
[1:06:34] greed

[1:07:03] about how god meets
[1:07:06] needs

[1:07:09] some of the things are secret in your
[1:07:10] heart the desires and you know just god
[1:07:13] just come on the scene and just display
[1:07:15] them and sometimes you forget about it
[1:07:18] but god is mindful
[1:07:20] about your needs your desires amen amen
[1:07:24] and in supernatural ways he meets them
[1:07:27] hallelujah
[1:07:29] hallelujah
[1:07:31] praise god
[1:07:33] now we spoke about a lot of the
[1:07:35] misconceptions
[1:07:37] before now we would like to continue
[1:07:40] slide number seven
[1:07:42] prayer
[1:07:44] is a conversation
[1:07:47] not a ceremony
[1:07:50] amen
[1:07:51] what is a ceremony
[1:07:53] it's something with a bunch of rules and
[1:07:56] restrictions
[1:07:58] we have a lot of that audio
[1:08:00] amen a lot of that
[1:08:02] you got to do this and this and this
[1:08:04] rituals
[1:08:06] and everything form amen
[1:08:09] and and things like that amen
[1:08:12] amen
[1:08:13] you have to do it in a certain way
[1:08:16] or it doesn't work
[1:08:18] amen
[1:08:19] hallelujah you got to say a hundred at
[1:08:21] this 200 or not and then god is going to
[1:08:24] forgive you
[1:08:26] man and you got to
[1:08:29] do the beads and the sharp plays and
[1:08:31] whatever
[1:08:33] rituals
[1:08:34] amen hallelujah and then
[1:08:36] then the prayer is going to work
[1:08:38] man
[1:08:39] it's not a ceremony
[1:08:41] amen
[1:08:43] hallelujah
[1:08:46] prayer
[1:08:47] is a conversation
[1:08:52] and in a conversation
[1:08:54] it means you talk
[1:08:57] yeah you only talk right
[1:09:00] amen
[1:09:02] it means also you have to
[1:09:04] listen amen so get that amen
[1:09:09] one of the reasons you're bored with
[1:09:11] prayer is because you do all the talking
[1:09:15] and you don't listen
[1:09:18] to that still
[1:09:21] small
[1:09:22] voice
[1:09:24] amen hallelujah
[1:09:26] if you're just doing monologue to the
[1:09:29] sky or in the dark amen you don't get
[1:09:32] any answers
[1:09:33] you don't hear any impressions of course
[1:09:36] it's going to be boring to you
[1:09:39] man because it's just like a one-way
[1:09:41] street
[1:09:43] lord give me give me give me lord i want
[1:09:45] this i want that i i i want this i i i
[1:09:49] what you're failing to recognize you're
[1:09:52] feeling to stop a little while
[1:09:54] and listen
[1:09:56] because as we always say god gave you
[1:09:58] one more but two is
[1:10:00] so because you have to listen twice as
[1:10:02] much as you speaking
[1:10:05] amen
[1:10:06] hallelujah
[1:10:08] amen
[1:10:09] so prayer is a conversation
[1:10:13] amen
[1:10:14] yes you speak but you got to listen
[1:10:18] hallelujah
[1:10:20] praise god
[1:10:22] hallelujah

[1:10:50] to wait upon the lord but you don't have
[1:10:52] to do all the talking you have to do

[1:10:56] hallelujah praise god
[1:11:00] hallelujah
[1:11:03] thank you lord jesus prayer is not a

[1:43:37] and every single prayer is answered
[1:43:42] not yet this is not good for you it does
[1:43:44] not you are not grown up enough as
[1:43:47] brother than you say
[1:43:49] you're not mature enough to receive it
[1:43:53] it's not good for you because god is a
[1:43:55] good god and he only gives us good
[1:43:56] things
[1:43:58] and if it's not good for you then he's
[1:44:00] not going to give it to you he said wait
[1:44:02] a little while
[1:44:04] for when you can handle it
[1:44:08] you're going to give a little child a
[1:44:11] million dollars
[1:44:12] or you're going to put a gun in their
[1:44:14] hand or a knife in hand just because
[1:44:16] they ask for it
[1:44:19] it's going to destroy them
[1:44:22] it's not going to be it's going to be to
[1:44:23] their own detriment to their own heart
[1:44:26] because they don't they're not mature
[1:44:29] enough how to handle earth
[1:44:31] so sometimes god said not yet hold a
[1:44:34] little bit when you grow up then you can
[1:44:36] get this
[1:44:38] and some things are blank no it ain't
[1:44:40] good for you
[1:44:41] because if you wanted to marry that man
[1:44:44] that you want so long in before after
[1:44:48] god sees in the future he said no
[1:44:50] anything good for you
[1:44:52] oh that's cute you've been after for the
[1:44:54] longest while god said
[1:44:57] i can see anything good for you you're
[1:44:59] my son no
[1:45:01] no this isn't good for you at all
[1:45:04] amen
[1:45:05] so we must
[1:45:07] we must be
[1:45:08] confident

[1:45:14] amen hallelujah
[1:45:17] amen thank you lord
[1:45:19] blessed be his wonderful name
[1:45:21] and also
[1:45:23] sometimes god said no because you know
[1:45:25] you have better things in store for us
[1:45:29] better things in store
[1:45:30] he said he's going to give you
[1:45:32] above even what you ask or what you
[1:45:35] desire
[1:45:38] amen
[1:45:40] so god knows
[1:45:42] god knows better things in store
[1:45:46] for us amen hallelujah
[1:45:48] thank you lord jesus
[1:45:50] my my my mind time is just fleeting on
[1:45:52] us today

[1:45:56] hallelujah god sometimes says no to our
[1:46:00] for our own correction
[1:46:03] to correct us
[1:46:05] sometimes god said no for our perfection
[1:46:10] amen to help us grow in our character
[1:46:14] amen
[1:46:16] sometimes god say no for our inspection
[1:46:21] he looks inside of us and help us to see
[1:46:24] what we couldn't not see
