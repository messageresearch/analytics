TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] coming soon it's jesus in all of his glory thank god not just an imagination not just a worldly prince but here comes jesus coming soon coming in all of his glory the effulgence of his glory and we are here to welcome him back our lord's return to earth again thanks be to god that we are alive in this glorious marvelous time the golden age of the elected seed of the living god that with our own hearts and eyes we shall behold him as he makes known himself to us once again my friends brothers and sisters in christ united us one in him i come to you in the name of the lord with the word of god again i enter into god's storehouse which was stopped full with the goodness of god by this prophet of malachi 4 5 brother william marion branham you wonder why do you mention him so often it's because i recognize who and what a prophet is how that a genuine prophet especially this 20th century prophet at the last part of his ministry the lord jesus himself used this vessel to speak through it and to bring to us the fullness of his word to him be the glory the honor and the praise and tonight we will enter into the storehouse where there are wonderful fresh green vegetables and fruits of the life ministry and the holy spirit's own products original so god bless us as we go into revelation chapter three uh reading verses one and two and speaking on the topic bible teaching of the seven church ages on the denunciation or condemnation of the age of sardis let us pray gracious heavenly father for the reading of thy word we are thankful we are grateful may your great spirit so anoint us and anoint the word to thee be the glory the honor and the praise as we attempt to step aside lord and let you have the forefront from this word of god in the name of jesus christ amen and amen revelation chapter 3 shall be turned in our bibles and read verse 1 and unto the angel of the church in sardis write these things said he that had the seven spirits of god and the seven stars i know thy works that thou hast the name that thou liveth and are dead be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for i have not found thy works perfect before god amen hallelujah in every other age that we have studied we found that god always praised the believers in that particular age and then he would denounce the false vine or the false church that had intertwined itself within the that age but in this period because of the disregard for the lord himself disregard this respect for the very word of god itself his entire words to this age rings with condemnation for the actions of and deeds of the people of this age true and false listen to the voice of god he says i know thy works oh praise god that's not just like when a man says with partial knowledge i know this or i know that this is the all-knowing all-seeing god saying i know your works in entirety i know thy works beginning to end from the very motivation to the very fullness of action god says i know thy works hallelujah my friends works in their rightful place are good for faith without works is dead you can have all the revelation you want but actions must follow that the revelation may be made manifest but something about these works that incurred god's dysplasia you see as i've said some works are good but somewhere in there in their works the works of the people of sardis there was some spiritual deficiency there was some kind of uh wrong motivations and intentions that was discerned by the spirit of god that caused these works to come up before god into god's attention now what were these works that we are speaking about first of all the people of sardis had superseded the leadership of the holy spirit by establishing a church hierarchy a church hierarchy of church leadership by man instead of accepting the leadership of the holy ghost similar to when god provided israel with with his leadership and they said well uh we still need a king they wanted a man that they could see hear touch feel before they could believe and follow god and here again that same spirit raises up its head not in israel but in the church of god and rejecting the leadership of god himself which was satan's intention from way back before the foundation of the world when he wanted to reject god's leadership and bring everything under his tales now notice carefully they also their works were tainted because you see they were presenting the word of god but they presented it tainted mixed in or intermingled with creeds with dogmas with church orders and various things whose origins were man-made and were not of god their worship was also tainted for they did not worship in the spirit as god wanted his church from the beginning to worship in the spirit and having an invisible union and communion by the presence of the holy spirit revealing the same thing to all the believers so that there could be an inner oneness achieved by the works of the holy spirit in them instead they cast aside the worship of god up through the holy spirit an accepted a system of liturgies they accepted a system of man made uh sets of how to worship how to do this certain creed how to do this certain worship at a certain time a certain season all laid out for them in the form of a system because in their minds that is orderly that is organized that is predictable we know what's coming next but this holy spirit it moves like a wind it changes it it does things in such way which we can't predict you see satan hates revelation but sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god and the spirit and the wind blows where it lists and no man no devil none knows where it comes and how it goes but we who believe we only know to or surrender submit and to follow to the direct will promise of god their works were tainted there were spotted feasts coming before god because instead of producing the full pure word they were presenting god with the worship of mary olitree and she began to take a greater place in their eyes than the very jesus christ who died for their sins and rose again they started to worship her lift her up instead of lifting up jesus so that he could draw all men unto himself and their worship of mary to the point where they started to subtly begin to insert her into the godhead itself and brought down the son jesus christ to a lower place and position rather than him being exalted as the mighty everlasting god in christ they spiritually demoted him and saying that his mother is greater mary greater than jesus christ they demoted him so far down until they brought him to it the subservience under the title of a man called the pope you see they put a man over the head of the eternal god and brought him in subservience you say what are you talking about brother simon let me let me give you some understanding of this in the old days when there was a king and that king got very old and he was ready to die then what would happen is that when he died or after he died the people will say well we know that the sun is the ear we know he is the new king but he is young he doesn't have political experience he doesn't have the maturity to be able to lead the kingdom so we will appoint a royal regent to be able to uh guide the king train the king until he comes to maturity then he will be able to take over his kingdom well under religious ranks and religious terminology we have the term where the popes call themselves vikers of christ vikers of christ so in other words they brought the christ the word the the god in flesh is brought into subservience a law order then the regents that men have declared upon this earth until the word comes to its fullness he will reign supreme he will advise the word think of it a man born in sin shapen and iniquity come to the world speaking lies and will present himself as a viker of christ a regent to rule over the word to advise the word to walk beside it and to take its authority and to use it as if it his own is it his own and to say i am here representing the word and i'm in place of christ i am here as the one to be in place of christ you see this is really spiritually what folks ought to understand and recognize that is really happening now we know those who fought in the early church many of them their lives were lost destroyed given up unto death and those who would not became pawns in the hands of the so-called church of that day even peasants kings scepters and crowns tumbled down at the feet of that jezebel religion see and soon the lives of the saints of god were not even their own anymore neither were their lives christ belonging to jesus christ anymore because now they were captured and belong body and soul to the spirit and leadership and vikrant or vicarage of the church of rome church of rome which taught and still talks about the blood of christ and yet encouraging or encourages the purchasing of salvation with money they're brought there paid and bought for the forgiveness of their sins either by paying true gold or the gore of penance the wealthy ones in the church then and now they find themselves that they could buy or pay for indulgences because pope leo the tenth allowed them to buy these indulgences for their sins that were not yet even committed in other words you could pay ahead for sins that you may even commit in the future and the pope will then supposedly forgive those sins now therefore those wealthy ones could plan their crimes ahead of time with no compulsion no feeling no conscience they didn't have to think about it because they believed their sins were already forgiven and paid for so they planned their awful crimes and proceeded to carry them out knowing that their their sins were already forgiven and permitted remitted by the pope of course the word of god was kept from the people so they could not know the truth what god has in store it was as it were that there were spiritually shut up in a dungeon of the church of rome yes my friends there they were they were shut up there as a man awaiting death already as a debt sentence of denomination upon him and he is waiting in these prisons with stained glass windows awaiting the sentence of death to be carried out upon him of course after natural death comes the judgment amen this great drunk with the blood of the saints of the ages before that time until that time and will do so again in the future right now she is on a pause where she she puts on her beauty that that throws you off your guard and lets you think that she's harmless but my friends that spirit will revive itself again with inquisition and a gore and rivers of blood that will be shed by this harlot of the book of revelation with no thought for she has no thought of any judgment or any such a thing upon her lake of fire and all of that she that that doesn't cross her thoughts she just goes ahead savagely killing men women the saints of god both with spiritual and physical death now towards the end of the fourth age and you know on the beginning of the of the fifth age uh let me repeat myself or let me reiterate something here listen says the servant of god we we know that each church age overlapped into the next age you see the church ages overlap even when it is announced that they have ended that is the official announcement but the age still keeps traveling through time and the other one starts and also traveling through time so all the ages are traveling parallel to each other and going all out and they will all end when we come back to eternity again so the official announcement just made but the ages left over so the first the fourth church age officially ends but then it laps over with the fifth as they continue traveling out there together now in this fifth church age the invasion of constantinople took place and i must say we have to thank they the turks the turkish people and the learned scholars of the east with their greek manuscripts that were brought to the west and so the purity of the word of god again began to be disseminated amongst the people amongst the believers but not only were these brothers these men fine wonderful teachers of the world of and of great importance but also from there came the invention of what today we know as modern printing presses printing presses were invented back then they were discovered and this facilitated the mass production of books and so we find the great hunger and demand for for for the bible uh could never be answered for the people's hearts were so hungry for the word of god then god enriching mercy and grace raised up great man anointed with the holy spirit man such as martin luther who was one man such as john calvin there was zwingli and these were just some luminaries of that time but there were many many more whose names we don't know because they were not uh like mainline figures we don't recognize them or they're not too well known however the mighty work of god turned around and these mighty men that god used some of them they were turned around and hindered the very work that they started they did not oppose how did they hinder the work they did not oppose the marriage of church and state at the nicean council they actually fostered it they actually wanted it my friends they actually spoke about the defenders of the faith and the defense of the gospel just imagine man whose life is like the like the evening breeze and moves and goes off like the smoke in the evening turns around and says we are the defenders of the face of the um of an omnipotent eternal god that there were going to be the defenders of the faith and the stamped documents and made it official oh my lord god have mercy amen yes sir in spite of all of luther's teaching and preaching against outside interference into church matters he could not stop the thought the idea the the false teaching of archbishops bishops neophytes and whatever else in the midst of the church they were setting up the spirit of the devil was setting up a hierarchy within the church and luther tried his best to stop it but he could not stop it and it prevailed and this concept of church government took over and though there came out of the uh church at that time out of the harlot yet in mind they were still shackled to her by this church government i wan i'm i'm i'm still i'm i'm pointing now how'd that form of church government taken on various names whether we want to say superintendent instead of pope one whether one is a general superintendent instead of pope whether we want to say chief presbyter instead of pope whether we want to say chief apostle instead of pope whatever terminology we want to use that or that form of false man-made church government has traveled down through time to this very hour in which we're living has been accepted by the daughters of the harlot and my brothers it still is here prevailing today their thoughts of what a bishop should be a church bishop and a bible bishop is absolutely far apart and not to be understood by them in their minds the bishop a bishop of the church should be won in glorious rich regalia robes gold covered with rubies precious stones until they must be addressed as princes of the church forsaking the very truth of the word of god that they who want to be the greatest let them be the least let them be servants amen jesus rode on a donkey no now they're riding in the best that the world could provide they wear the best the world can give they eat the best they live the best my friends contrarian in opposition to the word of the living god oh praise god hallelujah we know that luther used poor judgment and incited a battle between the peasants and their lords which caused hundreds of thousands to die zwingli later his party persecuted into prison a godly brother dr hubey meyer oh my lord have mercy and then was later responsible for his death of burning by fire calvin also no less he demanded the arrest of our precious brother servatus who had seen by revelation and began to teach the doctrine of the oneness of god the state of course stirred up the state which is what the church usually does hide in the background stir up the government and the state and they arrested brother servatus and tried him and took calvin's dismay they burned him at the stake now this was not really calvin's intent for this brother to be killed and burned he just wanted to put the fear of god in him and to scare him a bit so calvin was actually sorry that he did that but nevertheless his caller calling out to the state caused the death of this brother now in their denominational zeal bringing about all these tragic results we find out a brother that lived in those times who was a a a historian of note coming yes he wrote one thing is needful of us for we have a great number of teachers and that is the reason for the multitude of sex that we have no names are even left each church reckons itself as the true one and of the and the purest one and the truest one while among themselves they persecute what each other with the bitterest of hatred oh my think of it brother sister he further said scarcely anything is said of the power of the keys of the church for the church has lost the power of binding and of losing the sacraments were given to us they claim oh my and now faith revelation has been split or fragmented into a thousand ver different parts amen what can help us the only thing that can help us is return back to the word back to christ back to the original faith the original position and condition that god wants us to be in amen hallelujah the return of jesus christ as the only true leader and that we should walk in the footsteps of our king no wonder at the beginning of this i said coming soon coming soon our jesus in all of his glory oh thank god amen coming back to earth again hallelujah amen i believe he's here i believe he's with us amen until they are of his physical are coming amongst that amen but now brother sister hallelujah we find out amen that we should not be satisfied with anything else but the revealed word of god which belongs to us all and i stress that because we are not here to franchise the word of god we are not here to hold any kind of a document that gives us a franchise on the word of god yes this one he his franchise is on hot dogs or hamburgers his franchise is his fried chicken his franchise is on roast beef now uh his franchise is on healing his his franchise is is on holiness his franchise is on this his franchise is on the sacraments his franchise is on and so on i'm trying to say none of us not true believer has a franchise on any part of the word for the word of god is given to us by revelation true grace alone not true learning wisdom knowledge or inheritance we don't inherit faith but it's by the grace of god hallelujah amen my friends i believe god is revealing himself in and through this book we call the bible amen and we will obediently submit and follow his commands there is only one life but death comes in a four in a thousand forms now we know that denominationalism is spiritual death there's only one christ hallelujah but thousands of antichrists there's only one life but thousands and thousands of denominations amen if we are wise as true believers we'll come back to the word of god and come and walk in the true light of life jesus christ our heavenly leader now as you can see this era of time gave growth to the spirit or of denominationalism because since the time of paul the spirit of denominationalism was in its infancy and just about starting to rear its head to grow itself through the ages into maturity to this time and finally will come into its power and glory under the one world church that is yet to come but has now already started to emerge in the book of corinthians when the saints of god already had dissension where paul had to say are you not colonel listen one says i am of paul another said i am of apollos another one says i am of saint peter they already had the spirit of genomic nationalism rearing up its head in the first church age it was in its infancy but it has been growing through the ages until this time when it is now my friends preparing for the end of it all to come to the fullness of a one world church an image to the beast now my friends at that time they started out by having one was of luther the lutherans one was of john huss the hussites one was of zinc zwingli the zwingli party and so on that was the fragmentation of the body of the lord jesus christ and they were living under a name but they were dead because that name was not the name of christ they died the minute they organized and those great groups wanting to have the preeminence just united themselves together and grew bigger and bigger as as a church they grew bigger and bigger by taking over the others like nimrod conquered the nations around him that conquered all the other churches around them brought them under their fold and grow into this great religious monstrosity and this evil harlot beast image system according to this bible of the book of revelation that now presents itself as the holy mother church now we see it here friends that when they did that that this first denomination the lutherans coming out of the roman church who is the mother of denominations she is the first organized church when they make that claim it's true they are the first certified organized church all the other denominations regardless of what they claim protestants are not they actually are daughters to the harlot taking various tweaking a little bit here tweaking a little bit there but somewhere in there maintaining the original shape and form of charts government order and doctrine as was given to them by their mother and they don't recognize it but this is a proven fact that this is what they're doing oh my think of the word of god fulfilling itself in this hour my lord today what do we have the baptist would be glad if all the methodists came over to them and filled their ranks pentecostals would be happy if all the baptists all the methodists all the other churches will come together and come to them and fill their ranks as if they're the open door to heaven but we know that the only door is jesus christ himself now the this then i'm a national spirit as motivated certain works that god abhors and is against because it has motivated them to write manuals amen they began to write manuals trying to protect their so-called revival of their age and their time it's dying out so before it dies let's let's have a skeleton of it let's let's put together a manual of it and then they began to teach creeds and dogmas furthermore they started to set up offices positions attractive to ambitious spirits of man who love to have great titles great names they they don't want to be great in spirit but a nobody in the world no they want to be recognized known and to have great titles gilded and gold oh my what a world we live in and they want to know that they are part of a great church government and then each one claims he or she alone speaks for god the best trained the best qualified amen to speak for god but that's exactly what the popes have done and is doing and so they're right back where they started they may not realize it but they're back to mother again they're back to being with her under the feathers of our wings again and don't know it as revelation 3 tells you're blind miserable naked and you don't even know it you don't recognize where you are and when someone tells you about it you claim i'm not blind i know what i'm i'm doing i know exactly what you're doing oh well continue my friends thou ask the name says the word of god that thou livest and you are dead spiritually once you are denominated you are spiritually dead you say yes but we are having revival and we're jumping and we're speaking in towns we're having healing we're having holy sacraments we're having charisma we're charismatic uh catholics we're charismatic methodists we're charismatic my friends that's as much as if you cut off the head of a snake or a worm and the body keeps wiggling and twisting that's moving around that does not mean it's alive thou hast the name that thou live us and our dead back to the word of god repent of your sins repent of your past and to those of you are hearing this think upon these things back to your bible search the word of god and see whether things these things that are being said to you from god's storehouse of his word of this day amen whether these things are so for they are so they are in the bible they are thus seek the lord not from me but thus set the lord from god himself through the prophet of this hour amen hallelujah yes sir praise god this age was blessed to bring about the great reformation but instead of being praised it finds itself in a unique position of being rebuked by the lord because it brought the reformation but at the same time it sought the seeds of denomination that will grow and flower in the ages that were to come amen yes sir and we know it will organize itself back until it organizes itself back into the bosom of the harlot church after god opened the door of reformation of revival for them to escape god open the doorway for them to get out of the roman dungeons and away from the a pagan church of that time amen and we find what when that came out there was not truly a spiritual body as it should have been but they came out and instead of following the fullness of the word they had a streak or strain of political things mixed in a mix of them at the time i want you to understand that the people of that time were crushed crying bleeding suffering under the yoke of rome the financial strain the physical tortures the hunger in their hearts and they were longing to run or to flee from rome god opened the door through reformation my friends so protestantism they did not just see it as a spiritual escape but they saw it as the means of a political escape from their natural financial and political religious systems that they were imprisoned in i'm showing you the birth of modern protestantism my friends they hated that roman system with its politics and financial bondage and hardships that it placed upon them instead of them having a great spiritual move of god with all the earmarks of the influence and power of the holy spirit uh upon them god using the holy spirit to bring about another pentecost in their midst instead of them allowing god to do that my friends they have turned the work of god and used the influence of god and the holy spirit the righteousness of god the wrath of man started to work out thinking it will produce the righteousness of god that parallels of course israel in history when they left egypt they wandered in the wilderness for many years and many of them did not make it to canaan's land so will it be today many will not make it into the glory land amen oh my so the yoke of rome let us have this clearly even at that time the beast whose head the beast was not killed but his head was only wounded and so a romanism its power was just partially broken was never completely broken whatsoever and man could receive the word of god and now yield to the holy spirit without the former fear that was upon them and this my brother sister gave us a window of time between then and now when men can freely praise god receive the influence of the holy spirit and do the works of god back then when they have that window great men begin to come forth and it opened up the doorway for the wesleyan church age it opened up the doorway my friends for the great missionary age that was to follow this age of sardis may god help every one of us to recognize the denunciation the condemnation of this denominational spirit that was allowed to grow from its infancy in the days of paul come up in its childhood through the lutheran age and now come into its maturity in our day and in our time forming itself into an image and finally we'll come to its fullness in the one world church government under the domination of the lawless one may god bless every one of us as we take sight and look before us through this telescope of god's word and see what lies ahead see what is happening now and see what lies ahead may god bless us everyone may god anoint our hearts may god anointed our eyes with eyes of may god open up as we sing the song open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i want to see you i want to see you to see you high and lifted up oh shining in the light of your glory oh praise god god bless you my dear beloved friends and let us come together on sunday morning we have spoken on the seven mysterious thunders of revelation chapter 10 and we will speak on sunday on another marvelous subject in line with that which already has gone forth may we come with thirsting hearts hungering lives and may he fill us with his fullness in the name of our lord jesus christ amen god bless you [Music] you
