[27:18] genesis 17
[27:21] verses 7

[27:24] praise the lord

[27:32] us and i will establish
[27:37] my covenant
[27:39] between me and thee
[27:41] god speaking to abraham
[27:46] and
[27:47] thy seed
[27:49] after thee
[27:52] in their generations
[27:55] for an
[27:56] everlasting covenant
[27:58] for as long as time
[28:00] lasts right
[28:03] doesn't have to have a covenant when
[28:06] you're in heaven so this
[28:08] is what he's saying here
[28:10] praise god
[28:14] and
[28:15] i
[28:17] to be got to be a god unto them
[28:22] and to thy seed after thee

[28:44] and i
[28:45] will be
[28:47] their god amen praise the name of the
[28:50] lord god bless us as we
[28:53] look into his word
[28:56] we
[28:56] realize that uh sometimes the music
[29:01] it moves very slow in an orchestra not a
[29:04] movement it's
[29:06] up another way that
[29:08] it depends on the great sim
[29:12] composer of the symphony
[29:15] and he directs the music
[29:18] and we just fall in step with the music
[29:22] and we give god praise and thanks for
[29:25] him
[29:26] for his word
[29:28] that he
[29:29] is giving to us here tonight may the
[29:32] lord bless us all together heavenly
[29:34] father
[29:35] as we
[29:36] we have read from out of the bible
[29:40] now lord we look to the
[29:42] for the unwritten part of that word
[29:46] we we look for the great white horse
[29:49] rider of the holy spirit
[29:52] of almighty god to descend upon the word
[29:57] and cause that word of god to live again
[30:02] live in our hearts living our beings
[30:05] lord may the great holy spirit father
[30:10] take the word and make it so real so
[30:13] crystal clear to our hearts
[30:16] that we might see lord jesus
[30:19] what thou has done what you are doing
[30:23] and what you will do
[30:25] at the end of this all
[30:27] we give you all the praise the honor and
[30:30] the glory in jesus name amen and amen
[30:34] praise the lord please be seated
[30:37] ah praise god hallelujah
[30:40] amen
[30:42] now we know that
[30:44] jesus
[30:47] was
[30:49] predestinated
[30:52] jesus
[30:53] i'm not talking about the christ i'm
[30:57] talking about jesus the flesh
[31:00] that god was living in
[31:02] while he was here on earth
[31:04] that
[31:06] part was pre-destinated
[31:09] by the father that's why he called god
[31:12] the father
[31:14] and he came as
[31:17] the
[31:17] son or the son with all the other sons
[31:21] and daughters in him
[31:23] he came
[31:24] uh being the royal seed being the
[31:26] original seed
[31:28] being the gods
[31:31] seed word amen
[31:33] he was
[31:35] predestinated hallelujah hallelujah
[31:39] therefore being predestinated he could
[31:42] not help
[31:43] doing and being who he was
[31:47] amen because he was under inspiration of
[31:51] predestination
[31:54] amen
[31:55] but he was
[31:57] and still is
[31:58] the son of god hallelujah amen praise
[32:03] god and so
[32:06] are we in the same way
[32:09] because we are sons and daughters of god
[32:12] there are
[32:13] predestinated by the holy spirit
[32:16] we cannot help being who we are
[32:20] amen because god places here with under
[32:26] divine command hallelujah we are here
[32:29] not by our own will
[32:32] we didn't make a choice
[32:35] uh in this matter that i am going to be
[32:38] this i'm going to be a christian i'm
[32:40] going to be that i'm going to be the
[32:43] other no
[32:44] we are here by the grace of god and true
[32:49] predestination hallelujah amen praise
[32:53] god listen brother branham
[32:56] if you were intended to see
[33:00] the word of god you will see it
[33:04] and believe it
[33:07] hallelujah praise god amen
[33:11] if you were predestinated by god you
[33:14] understand
[33:15] then you will see it if you're in that
[33:18] group
[33:19] if you are in that
[33:22] part of god if you're one of god's genes
[33:25] germs you will see it
[33:27] and you will believe it praise god
[33:30] hallelujah amen and this is when i'm
[33:34] just recapping this part here with his
[33:37] when he says
[33:39] do you see
[33:41] there is something
[33:43] out there
[33:44] have you ever heard of a strain in a
[33:48] family
[33:49] family traits
[33:51] house one son will be like the father or
[33:54] the mother or another child like the
[33:57] grandfather or the great grandmother
[34:01] that's a strain
[34:03] in that family do you believe it
[34:07] you see you heard it amen that's the
[34:11] same thing
[34:12] with
[34:13] predestination
[34:15] and from predestination
[34:18] hallelujah
[34:19] you're supposed to be here in the right
[34:22] way
[34:23] at the beginning hallelujah see you're
[34:26] supposed to be here on the
[34:28] predestination you are supposed to come
[34:32] the way of the spoken word how jesus was
[34:35] born by the spoken word through an angel
[34:39] from the beginning you should have come
[34:42] that way
[34:43] by the spoken word from adam
[34:47] at that time praise god
[34:49] and then we would have come
[34:52] living
[34:54] a life his life
[34:56] through the spoken word and as genes of
[35:00] god as his generation and after his kind
[35:04] we would be like that from the very
[35:09] beginning see
[35:10] oh
[35:11] but now
[35:12] you see because you come
[35:16] the other way
[35:18] you are subject to the fall
[35:22] no man can say he's without sin if you
[35:24] go to paul that's what he's saying here
[35:27] you're subject to the fall
[35:30] being that you are
[35:34] predestinated to hear this word
[35:37] that brings you right back to where you
[35:41] were procrastinated hallelujah what he's
[35:44] saying it reverses the curse satan
[35:47] interrupted the whole thing when you
[35:50] should have gone with a spoken word
[35:53] birth through eve or by eve through adam
[35:57] bringing the word hallelujah
[36:00] this
[36:02] uh seven angel
[36:04] brings back the spoken word to
[36:08] reverse what satan did and bring back
[36:12] the original birth hallelujah bring back
[36:16] the right birth hallelujah a sister uh
[36:20] wright would have said praise god i
[36:22] believe that do you believe
[36:24] in praise god the right work will make
[36:28] you believe it and see it praise the
[36:31] lord hallelujah amen now what makes you
[36:35] believe the word of god
[36:38] and turn down the other things
[36:40] that you are hearing
[36:42] it's because there's something in you
[36:46] do you believe it
[36:48] something in you he says that was there
[36:52] way
[36:53] back way back yonder it was there praise
[36:57] god hallelujah and that's why you reject
[37:00] the other things
[37:02] you're hearing it like everybody else
[37:04] you're seeing it like everybody else but
[37:07] your reaction is coming from the gene
[37:11] that was already predestinated
[37:14] from before the foundation of the world
[37:17] glory to god hallelujah amen praise god
[37:22] oh my
[37:24] yes praise god now
[37:27] all he for knew he called and all he
[37:30] called it justified he was and glorified
[37:34] hallelujah amen you say well brother
[37:37] branham what's the use of him preaching
[37:38] them oh my oh
[37:41] bro there's a crop out there
[37:44] amen hallelujah and the reason why god
[37:48] could manifest through jesus
[37:52] is because he was a predestinated
[37:55] messiah lamb body that was supposed to
[37:59] be there in that age at that particular
[38:03] time for the father to be able to
[38:06] manifest through
[38:08] is that right
[38:10] now we know in the this age brother
[38:13] branham took that place or was given
[38:16] that place that god put messengers in
[38:19] each edge that whenever when he wants to
[38:22] manifest himself when he wants to
[38:25] restore his word he will come to that
[38:28] messenger whoever he was and reveal
[38:31] himself through that person
[38:34] amen oh that's what has happened in our
[38:38] age
[38:39] god
[38:40] revealing himself
[38:42] not god
[38:44] but there
[38:46] looking back at jesus
[38:48] and the devil has got the people looking
[38:52] back and not seeing what god has done
[38:55] and is doing right now in this age to
[38:59] glorify his great name
[39:02] and they're missing it again
[39:04] why
[39:05] god
[39:06] hides in simplicity
[39:08] and reveals himself
[39:10] in the very same thing you see the
[39:14] reason why god could manifest work
[39:17] through
[39:18] jesus he was a manifested son to be the
[39:23] lamb
[39:25] that was slain before the foundation
[39:28] of the world praise god hallelujah amen
[39:32] and the reason why god will work through
[39:36] you
[39:37] is because you are predestinated
[39:40] children of the living god
[39:42] amen praise god hallelujah amen glory
[39:47] blessed be his name now
[39:50] you see
[39:51] he did the will of the father
[39:53] and he was the word man manifest
[39:57] when he did the will of the father
[39:59] and every one
[40:02] of the other sons and daughters will
[40:04] have the same manifestation
[40:07] what will there be the word
[40:10] it will be the father working through
[40:12] you
[40:14] it's god making himself manifest not
[40:17] back there that's already happened
[40:20] that's fulfilled amen but we are here to
[40:23] fulfill the rest of the scriptures
[40:26] concerning him praise god so that the
[40:30] holy spirit could use this part of the
[40:33] body to manifest himself in this
[40:36] hour sons and daughters
[40:39] placed
[40:40] strategically by god
[40:43] in this age

[40:48] that no wonder paul said even if your
[40:51] heart starts to doubt you god is greater
[40:54] than your heart

[40:59] place itself out there and because
[41:02] you're in this flesh out there you may
[41:04] struggle you may fall you made this you
[41:06] made that but he has got a goal

[41:15] take them away they're going to press
[41:17] their way through it all amen no matter

[41:45] wants in you
[41:47] he can put all the dirt he wants on you
[41:51] he could give you all the names that he
[41:53] likes on you but god has spoken there's
[41:57] going to be a little group in every age
[42:00] and they're going to come up glory to
[42:02] god hallelujah yes now i tell you

[42:16] they ran their race
[42:19] and they fulfilled their part of the
[42:22] body of the world they fulfill their
[42:26] part now as the prophets it is becoming

[43:29] amen amen praise god so you may have
[43:34] nothing to eat

[43:40] uh digging out here and have to double
[43:43] their persecuted hair persecuted there
[43:47] like them was isaiah and them oh my see
[43:52] that happened but remember
[43:55] isaiah and them were
[43:58] predestinated even before the world

[44:02] and so were you
[44:04] and he should have come true see the
[44:09] womb of eve by the spoken word of adam
[44:12] but when he came through the womb of a
[44:16] woman
[44:17] then you see god let his spirit come
[44:21] here and be on the earth as a witness
[44:26] so
[44:26] your being is here as a witness
[44:31] no matter what the devil does no matter

[45:15] trust in him
[45:18] brother brethren it said if he decided
[45:21] to send me to hell then i'll go and i'll
[45:24] still love him
[45:26] praise god because that's what he
[45:29] purposed for us amen
[45:31] glory be to god on high lord of god amen
[45:36] you see jesus also came predestinated
[45:40] for a witness
[45:43] a witness of what death
[45:46] a witness of what burial
[45:49] resurrection
[45:51] all to show
[45:53] that man will die
[45:56] because of what satan did
[45:58] but listen here to show that man will
[46:02] die
[46:03] but they will live again
[46:06] through believing him for he is the seed
[46:10] amen praise god hallelujah all praise
[46:14] god and it has to come up
[46:17] because it's part of that seed amen he
[46:21] came up you've got to come up because
[46:23] you're part of that seed you are in him
[46:26] before the foundation of the world it's
[46:28] not maybe so you're not wondering now
[46:32] you're not hoping that you make it
[46:34] you're not trusting god i escape hell
[46:37] hell is not even in your thoughts
[46:40] anymore your heaven bound with the grace
[46:42] of god
[46:45] the holy spirit will take you nowhere
[46:47] else
[46:48] the pillar of fire will lead you nowhere
[46:50] else
[46:51] the word will light up and guide you and
[46:54] lead you right into the perfect light by
[46:57] the grace of god hallelujah amen i tell
[47:02] you
[47:03] my friends
[47:04] amen you see
[47:07] pre-destinated
[47:08] as he was
[47:11] the word seed was made flesh
[47:16] and
[47:17] now him
[47:19] the seed becomes flesh in you
[47:24] amen in other words you become the flesh
[47:27] of the world
[47:28] another quotation he said the word is
[47:32] becoming flesh and flesh is becoming
[47:35] worse
[47:36] amen praise god amen
[47:39] hallelujah amen surely brother branham
[47:44] you'll say
[47:45] i believe every word
[47:49] oh my that's wonderful
[47:52] then if you believe it don't back up
[47:56] don't slow down
[47:59] oh stare right with that word
[48:02] oh my
[48:03] he said remember i want you to it's by
[48:08] your constant belief in the word
[48:12] amen
[48:13] that life
[48:14] that you live
[48:16] never denying nothing amen the life that
[48:20] you live you see
[48:22] the devil's got them believing the life
[48:24] that you live the the natural life that
[48:27] you live but he's talking about you
[48:30] living the life of that gene that is in
[48:33] you you're letting that the life of the
[48:36] gene which is jesus christ the word in
[48:39] you live out through you and that's the
[48:42] life that you live and you don't go
[48:44] about worrying and wondering about that
[48:47] god promised in this word he's gonna go
[48:49] float through your life amen praise god
[48:53] hallelujah and what when the spirit fell
[48:57] on him
[48:59] what kind of a life did he bring
[49:02] speaking of abraham now remember abraham
[49:05] was predestinated
[49:07] and when the spirit fell on him
[49:10] what kind of a life did he bring he
[49:13] brought forth a faith life
[49:16] can you believe that do you say amen
[49:19] he brought forth a faith life
[49:22] what kind of a life did he bring forth
[49:25] when the spirit fell on him he brought
[49:28] forth a fair life
[49:30] he repeats here but you know faith is a
[49:32] revelation it's not just believing
[49:35] because you got to have something to
[49:36] believe and something has to be revealed
[49:39] to you to know what to believe
[49:42] is that right praise god hallelujah so
[49:45] he brought forth a life
[49:48] of revelation and of believing god
[49:52] that is what abraham brought forth amen
[49:56] praise god now remember
[49:59] abraham believed god's word regardless
[50:03] of the circumstances let me stop a
[50:05] minute here and bring a thought here you
[50:08] say abraham believe god
[50:10] do you know what the bible tells us in
[50:12] genesis uh there
[50:14] how that abraham was with his father in
[50:16] aura of the chaldeas
[50:18] and
[50:19] all that abraham heard was a voice
[50:23] a voice saying abraham rise up
[50:27] leave or if the child is going to the
[50:30] land where i have called you
[50:32] and the bible tells us he rose up not
[50:35] knowing where he went but just following
[50:37] this voice
[50:39] that was speaking to him oh it's so
[50:41] beautiful it's so simple
[50:44] do you realize abraham never read a book
[50:49] do you realize abraham was following
[50:52] what we call the unwritten word
[50:55] [Music]
[50:57] he was following the unwritten word of
[51:00] god
[51:01] because he recognized that voice that
[51:05] was leading him was the voice of god
[51:09] many voices in the world but as we said
[51:12] before you don't listen to those voices
[51:15] but there's one voice when it sounds it
[51:18] strikes something in your soul
[51:20] it strikes the gene within your soul you
[51:23] know it's different praise god
[51:26] hallelujah amen cause him to recognize
[51:30] and believe the unwritten word of that
[51:34] day so the unwritten word is a voice
[51:37] is that right
[51:39] it's a voice it's not written and so
[51:41] abraham believe the voice of god praise
[51:45] god hallelujah amen and why did he
[51:48] believe the voice praise god
[51:51] why why would he believe the voice
[51:53] just hear a voice come out of the
[51:55] atmosphere like that and right away
[51:57] believe the voice because when the voice
[52:00] sounded
[52:02] the voice sounded familiar to him
[52:06] other people might have been scared of
[52:08] that voice
[52:09] but to him the voice was familial
[52:13] and the reason why the voice was
[52:16] familiar because the germ the gene was
[52:21] there with them other sons and daughters
[52:24] of all the other ages singing and
[52:26] shouting and praising and worshiping god
[52:30] up in heaven that's why he asked job
[52:33] have you come out to spiritual amnesia
[52:35] as yet let me ask you where were you
[52:38] when them other sons and daughters of
[52:39] god were singing and shouting for joy
[52:42] where were you when they were praising
[52:45] and worshiping me hallelujah amen that's
[52:48] the reason why abraham recognized the
[52:51] voice when it came out of god is that
[52:54] right let me go a little further i won't
[52:56] go down that line but i just want to
[52:58] show you something here when melchizedek
[53:01] right up on the horse or whatever to
[53:03] abraham and started speaking to him
[53:07] right away abraham said my lord
[53:11] he recognized not the shape the form
[53:15] god can make himself manifest in any
[53:17] form he wants to make himself but he
[53:19] recognized the voice hallelujah of the
[53:22] one that was speaking oh because the
[53:25] deep cross to the deep and the deep will
[53:28] respond hallelujah oh praise god amen
[53:33] glory to god forevermore that my lord
[53:37] don't you understand that's why wha it
[53:40] seems like sometimes when
[53:43] brother brethren is speaking
[53:45] i am speaking some other preachers speak
[53:47] in the word sometimes before they can
[53:50] say it it's already in your heart
[53:54] it's ready in your heart and not only
[53:56] that it sounds familiar like you heard
[53:59] it somewhere else before
[54:02] you don't know how but you know you it
[54:05] sounds i don't know can't remember where
[54:09] but it seems like i heard that you're
[54:12] dead but not on earth your heart is in
[54:15] glory amen you're only set down here to
[54:18] be a witness to the word of the living
[54:21] god amen oh praise god we're in this
[54:24] church we are preaching the word you are
[54:27] believing the word there are other men
[54:30] of god really truly called of god let me
[54:33] tell you something is going on
[54:36] this message is starting to rise into a
[54:39] crescendo
[54:41] it's coming to a place where everything
[54:44] is going up amen praise god we're going
[54:48] up in the first resurrection and the
[54:50] spirit of god is witnessing to it and
[54:53] striking it amen hallelujah amen praise
[54:57] god pray praise god my friends you must
[55:01] believe this or you are lost
[55:05] you say
[55:07] believe what brother branham
[55:10] are you saying
[55:11] we must believe you
[55:15] i've never really seen this before
[55:17] he says
[55:18] must be we have to believe you
[55:21] or you're lost well you know brother
[55:23] brandon he said well no sir
[55:26] not me
[55:27] but
[55:28] but i am saying believe the word
[55:32] praise god i'm saying believe the word
[55:36] and the word in him speaking i believe
[55:39] the word but yet he knows it's not him
[55:43] amen praise god glory to god see oh my
[55:47] the bible says to believe this word
[55:52] and now i'm speaking it
[55:54] and he has confirmed it and he's
[55:56] confirming it
[55:58] praise god that is the same word you had
[56:01] in that bible
[56:02] that is now back here again and is
[56:05] confirming that it's that same word
[56:07] praise god forevermore as you're happy
[56:10] we have the same word the apostles had
[56:13] the same word every one of the sages had
[56:16] not a different word but the same word
[56:20] but it sounds strange to them
[56:22] because their
[56:24] soul
[56:25] never heard that voice before praise god
[56:28] hallelujah
[56:30] amen oh my
[56:33] don't you understand it
[56:36] predestinated
[56:37] as he was he had to be the word seed now
[56:41] the church today the bride today she is
[56:46] predestinated
[56:48] what did god say
[56:51] she would be a bride without spot or
[56:53] wrinkle
[56:55] that's her being predestinated right
[56:58] there already
[57:00] amen you know what he's talking about
[57:02] here i mean he couldn't talk all these
[57:04] things and take up a lot of time but he
[57:06] is talking about when god
[57:10] had a bride in his mind
[57:12] amen
[57:14] of course just like when god said a
[57:16] virgin will conceive
[57:17] god doesn't have to wait for to see mary
[57:20] to know who he's going to be he already
[57:23] knows from the time he spoke the word
[57:26] who the virgin is going to be so when he
[57:28] says there's going to be a bride
[57:31] and that bride is going to be without
[57:33] spot
[57:35] and she's going to be without wrinkle is
[57:38] that right
[57:39] you know what what that is talking about
[57:42] he's already guaranteeing that no matter
[57:46] what the devil tries to do with that
[57:48] bride she is going to come out of this
[57:51] world walk in the world and wait she's
[57:54] going to come out
[57:56] spotless she's going to come out without
[57:58] a wrinkle amen it's got to happen it's
[58:01] going to happen not just by your effort
[58:04] because he spoke it and it has to happen
[58:09] without spotter without wrinkle
[58:13] it's predestinated
[58:15] just as christ jesus christ was
[58:18] predestinated
[58:19] hallelujah amen praise god now when the
[58:25] spirit came on jesus
[58:27] he bore record and testimony of the word
[58:31] of god
[58:32] and when the spirit water falls on this
[58:36] lord seed of abraham
[58:39] all of abraham's faith in god's word it
[58:42] will produce the same kind of crop
[58:46] same kind of manifestation same kind of
[58:49] crop by the grace of god hallelujah amen
[58:53] yes sir and if that seed comes up it
[58:57] will have to be
[58:59] after
[59:00] abraham's kind
[59:02] it'll have to be after jesus christ kind
[59:06] no wonder isaiah says in that day he
[59:09] shall see his generations amen he shall
[59:13] see them praise the name of the lord oh
[59:17] my praise god you believe you're
[59:19] abraham's seed
[59:20] [Music]
[59:22] hallelujah so you got some of the family
[59:27] peculiarities of god believing
[59:30] the word amen you can't help that
[59:33] because it's just natural to you when
[59:35] you're in that family that you just
[59:37] believe the word you you don't have to
[59:39] be trained into it you don't have to be
[59:41] schooled into it you don't have to give
[59:43] enough bibles class to be in it you are
[59:46] just you're just part of the family of
[59:48] god
[59:49] you're part of the spiritually abrahamic
[59:52] family and they behave a certain way and
[59:56] all they know about is to believe god
[59:59] and to follow the word follow the pillar
[1:00:02] of fire wherever he leads amen genesis
[1:00:07] 17

[1:00:28] now i want you to watch now listen and
[1:00:30] watch
[1:00:32] between me and thee

[1:00:59] covenant with you

[1:01:04] we are covenanted people we're not just
[1:01:07] walking around like that we are kept by
[1:01:10] the power of god through faith
[1:01:12] oh the spirit of the living god moving
[1:01:15] across the soul moving across your being

[1:01:22] holy spirit wakes up the life that was
[1:01:25] in you praise god and brings you back to
[1:01:28] your original life that you should have

[1:05:06] that's what i hope you see
[1:05:08] and understand because i am now talking
[1:05:12] to this congregation
[1:05:16] amen
[1:05:18] this morning
[1:05:19] those that are already
[1:05:22] in jesus christ that are faithful in
[1:05:25] jesus christ amen
[1:05:28] according as he has chosen us
[1:05:33] in him
[1:05:35] praise god
[1:05:37] according to the word
[1:05:40] see
[1:05:41] you
[1:05:42] were chosen in him
[1:05:45] now stop and think he says
[1:05:48] did
[1:05:49] we choose him
[1:05:52] but that's what the denominations are
[1:05:54] teaching
[1:05:56] that is how the devil is so cunning
[1:05:59] that will take the very word he'll quote
[1:06:02] the same scripture but put a different
[1:06:05] meaning or a different thing on it that
[1:06:08] the people can't see the truth
[1:06:11] right
[1:06:12] but
[1:06:13] according as he has chosen us
[1:06:18] and he chose us when we were in him
[1:06:22] and then you see the scripture goes on
[1:06:24] before the foundation of the world
[1:06:27] so
[1:06:28] so all these little jingles and jangles
[1:06:31] that they have i took jesus as my savior
[1:06:34] you take him too
[1:06:39] oh i
[1:06:40] oh
[1:06:42] they'll speak in tongues and they'll say
[1:06:44] oh i can remember
[1:06:46] the very night
[1:06:48] on
[1:06:49] november there's so so date in a year so
[1:06:52] and so when i
[1:06:54] give my heart to jesus and i chose jesus
[1:06:58] to be my lord and savior and they're
[1:07:00] sincere
[1:07:02] when they're doing it
[1:07:04] but the prophet said sincere has nothing
[1:07:06] to do with it
[1:07:07] see it's good you're sincere
[1:07:10] but if there's no g no germ no seed in
[1:07:13] there isaac saw
[1:07:16] what's his name he saw sought repentance
[1:07:18] with tears
[1:07:20] but he couldn't find it he couldn't find
[1:07:23] it because he was not in god's
[1:07:25] predestinated plan and though jacob
[1:07:28] appeared like a rogue and a renegade he
[1:07:31] was the one that was elected and
[1:07:33] predestinated
[1:07:35] god is gonna clean him up when he's
[1:07:37] ready god is gonna shape him up when he
[1:07:39] wants to god will put him in position
[1:07:42] once the hour and the time praise the
[1:07:44] lord are you following me here
[1:07:47] praise be to god according as he has
[1:07:50] chosen us in him
[1:07:52] according to the word you didn't choose
[1:07:55] him
[1:07:57] jesus himself said that
[1:08:00] you never chose me
[1:08:03] i chose you
[1:08:06] oh yes
[1:08:07] when did he choose you when did jesus
[1:08:11] choose you
[1:08:12] the scripture said jesus he chose his
[1:08:16] church before the foundation of the
[1:08:20] world
[1:08:21] praise the lord hallelujah praise god oh

[1:08:59] foundation of the world

[1:09:18] this night or this day or this hour you
[1:09:21] are always eternal you are always in him
[1:09:26] you are always a part of him so he is
[1:09:29] eternal you are eternal praise god
[1:09:31] you're only living for a time imprisoned
[1:09:35] in a body
[1:09:36] amen hallelujah that this body that's

[1:10:09] certain time again no you won't find it
[1:10:12] in there therefore he says he let me
[1:10:15] repeat according as he has chosen us in
[1:10:19] him

[1:11:04] shock from eve sin amen cause you not to
[1:11:08] remember and to know who you really are
[1:11:11] but the word of god has come now to
[1:11:14] bring light to bring truth to bring you
[1:11:17] back to the familial places that you

[1:11:45] the mother of jesus to bring forth the
[1:11:47] word
