TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] goodnight folks I beloved brethren it's wonderful to be together again we live in a marvelous time much is happening and then you are there Here I am we're just in our homes by ourselves we're passing through the wilderness and it's a testing time a time when God tests us after our faithfulness to him and his word as of tonight I will begin this study on the seven churches I will begin tonight starting on page 12 of the church age book you may find that while I'm yet making my comments now next this coming Sunday I will speak on the second part of the Spirit quickens the word actually the Spirit quickens the word to the elect of the age in which we are living in so that will be the approach on Sunday morning but for tonight's lesson let us pray and read out of the book of Revelation chapter 1 verses 1 to 3 Lord Jesus we thank you for another day you have kept your people thus far safe covered by the blood protected by your love mercy and grace take all the praise all it honor and the glory father we give all that we are and all that we have we surrender it to you Father forgive us of our sins cleanse us by the precious blood and make us fit for service both hearers and speaker and in all of this father may you be glorified we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ give us the understanding of the word as we read it Lord in Jesus name Amen and amen no the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John who bare record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand blessed be the name of the Lord thank you Jesus now let us commence we understand looking into the seven churches page 12 beginning from page 12 that the scribe not the author of this book is st. John the Divine that is clear who is the scribe John is the scribe he is not the author now bring that to heart in our thing we have received a revelation by the Word of God and we understand that this crane not the author this speaker of the spoken word not the author is brother William Marion Branham God used him to be the scribe pick up your pen and write God use him to be the speaker to voice that he might use him and the Spirit of God might speak through the Prophet to bring the Word of God to our age that we might know these things for God's glory now for the writing of this book he was placed on the Isle of Patmos I will not make any commentary on that now but we understand that this of course is not John's life story the book of Revelation is not the ruminations of a sick man this book of Revelation is not the hallucinations of a man suffering from colic because of over eating this book of Revelation is a book where while we were yet studying it the Bible says you're already blessed just to read it and blessed is he that understand it it's a marvelous and wonderful book now the third thing is that this book of Revelation is not the biography of John the Revelator it is the revelation of Jesus Christ himself his works all his plans and the things that would come to pass in the future ages of John's time of course referring to our time and the times that are yet to unfold like the rapture the tribulation the hundred and forty-four thousand the the Third Temple the the restoration of the red heifer the sacrifice of atonement all these things are they Armageddon and so on all those things are written and in this book so blessed is he that readeth and understand it what is in the book even if a person reads this book with no understanding they're still blessed and then if they have an understanding they're even more blessed so it is very important that we read this book and understand it by the precious Holy Spirit now this book of Revelation is a book of prophecy let us understand that clearly that it is a book of prophecy let me cook now the book is usually termed a revelation of st. John but that is incorrect it is the revelation of Jesus Christ given to John for Christians of all ages who wasn't given for for Christians of all ages which means this book is meant for you just look book is meant for us we should receive it in our hearts where great delight in this day and in this out now it's the last book in our Bible it's the last book in our Bible but yet it tells the beginning and the ending of the entire gospel the dispensations of the gospel right from Genesis right through the various ages of the patriarchal age in the age of law and the age of plants and the age of prophecy right on them it comes right to us in listening and in this time where we break into the seven ages of the Church of the Gentile the dispensation now the this word revelation in the Greek is apocalypsis in other words an apocalypse which is to say an unveiling and uncovering revealing something that was previously hidden it's uncovering the revelation of the person of Jesus Christ and how his future works in the oncoming 7 Church ages at that time today we are standing physically in the last church age so John looked from the eye of Patmos under the anointing of the Holy Spirit and saw through the ages and years of time he saw this age and right to the end and beyond our age John even saw the things that were going to be and all of the future works that were going to come John saw it all now notice carefully let me give you a quotation from brother branham and it's this the sign of the answer page 62 what uh a mystery he's speaking about a mystery and I'd like to say it what is a revelation a revelation is a mysteries scripture or previously hidden truth now divinely revealed which is a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation praise be to God hallelujah no we see friends that some truths that was hidden now revealed in our wonderful time thanks God hallelujah so here we see clearly in the Word of God the importance of Revelation to the true believer it cannot be over emphasized and revelation means more to us than we have realized prior to this prophet coming and making it clear to us so I'm not he said I'm not talking about the book of Revelation I'm talking about all revelation it's tremendously important to the church see oh oh you must realize that revelation is the key to understanding the entire Bible no wonder he said I all the key of David I shut and no man opens I open and no man can shut it let me repeat the principle and truth of Revelation is the foundation for the understanding of the entire Bible now when Jesus here he said who do you say ina son of man and who do you say him and one they gave the opinions of men rather than their by the spirit of Revelation going into the Word of God catching the application bringing it back and saying oh you are the seed of the woman or you were the ram caught in the thicket tomorrow or to catch the relation or you are buaas here I can see you pictured in in such-and-such you see but they went by the opinions of men they said some say as we will say in our time the people say some say that you are Isaiah the prophet and others say you are Jeremias or one of the prophets and he says that's good people's opinions anyone can give their opinions about this Bible about this Word of God what they think and you can have schools that were founded on the basis of trained to investigate penetrate and interpret what this Bible is all about whom do you but he asked the question not men's opinions from their colleges from the seminaries from the universities from their higher institutions of learning or from the rabbis or or whatever not who people say I am he says but who do you you personally say that I am right so Revelation is a personal thing God dealing with individual God loves to deal with us as individual and when we come together each with his individual revelation in union and in harmony then it's the restoration of his wonderful body and all of the Godhead brought back into unity for his glory amen so here he says but whom say ye that I am then rose up rough fisherman Peter and he says thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this honor you thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it oh praise God for evermore you see these disciples were influenced by the opinions of men we should not be influenced by the opinions of men are coming out of their colleges their Bible schools keep your eyes upon the world keep your eyes on Jesus and ask God for wisdom for understanding and for revelation if there is something in the Word of God you do not understand something in the message that's not clear to you go to God and prayer and ask God to open up the word which is himself to reveal himself to reveal his word to you that you might know him in the power of his resurrection see no we understand just as it was back there when the question was asked who who do men say I am and they said well some say you Jeremiah some say you're Isaiah No right down through history and even in our day the Roman Catholics say that the church is built upon Peter now we know that's a carnal interpretation and that God could not build his church on sinking sand he could not build this church in words to say on an unstable man at that time before his conversion he could not be the foundation of God's church so Jesus was not telling them to that his church would be built upon Peter then came the protesters and they said we are sure the church is built on Jesus now watch the Roman Catholics say that is built on Peter of course that's a false opinion that is a false proposition and that is false teaching contrary to the Word of God now the Protestants come along and this is history repeating itself and the Protestant opinion proposition and teaching is that the church is built on Jesus but Jesus himself was just the body that God dwelt in and you see so we're not going to discuss that particularly here now but many today the point is that many today are going by the opinions of man and many don't know it thank God for those whose eyes are open and can recognize it in our day now we understand friends that he says that gates of hell shall not prevail against the church and I've taught on this before but you understand there right there we understand we have a marvelous wonderful promise from this we recognize his prophecy Satan will come against the church Satan will attack the church Satan will do everything to destroy the church Satan will do everything to overcome the church and overcome the entire believer but jesus said that gates of Hell shall not prevail against the church he will try to prevail against the church by by bringing sin to bear you in a dream of sin he will come against the church by Brandon gates of Hell denominationalism opening up their gates to receive you and there you'll find your way into hell see now we understand that he will try to overcome the true church but this promise we must hold to it it it shall not prevail against us because we are more than conquerors through him that loved us with with him with our sight with him in the inside of us we are more than conquerors through him that loved the strength God hallelujah so they're taking men's opinions rather than reading their own Bible and receiving the revelation of God's Word now clearly Jesus said to Peter he says now this it was by revelation read it the way it is written flesh and blood has not revealed it but my father in heaven has revealed it and upon this rock what rock the rock of Revelation the rock of day of the very truth and principle scriptural principle of Revelation is what the church will is built on that's once melt on it's built on the same Oh God hallelujah no what does the Bible say the foundation of the true church is to be we know the true church is built on the truth and scriptural principle of Revelation take your stand right there that every word of God in this Bible must be revealed to you it's not to be read like a novelist not to be read like a a biography it's not to be read like old history or a book of poetry or a higher learning of literature any of those things but the Bible must be read prayerfully sincerely humbly reverently while asking God for wisdom and revelation for he alone can give you the understanding now the prophet of God speaking how did ml know what to do in order to offer a proper sacrifice to God Hebrews chapter 11 verses 1 to 3 you'll find there by faith by revelation we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God and then it goes on to say by faith Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than Cain see why now the question has been asked how did he offer a more excellent sacrifice why was a sacrifice for excellent let us recognize that there was no written bite at that time there wasn't let me repeat there was no written Bible at that time so how did people know exactly what to offer to God it means that there was a spiritual communication between God and emails heart and God spoke right into the heart of a bell and revealed made known to him that what he desired was a land and that lamb of course was a bell was given the understanding that there was a our Redeemer with a lamb light nature that was to come so by revelation evil offered a better sacrifice to God see no it's the revelation of God that made the difference in his offering Cain made an offering to but he had no understanding of what he was supposed to offer he was blind to the understanding of the holy spirit he had no connection he had no real communication he had no no sonship see so anyway the Holy Spirit spoke and revealed to Abel what it was so if I did not have to guess he did not have to go to a school of learning to to presume and to try to penetrate the deep things of God by human skill and by human knowledge by by research and comparing Scripture with Scripture which it's all good but revelation comes like a flash of light from the presence of Almighty God knowledge that was previously hidden not sense knowledge not knowledge that can be accumulated by the five senses but revelation knowledge knowledge that comes from God alone with that comes from above and fills the human heart and makes things clear for this day thanks Peter God for his marvelous and wonderful grace see no he says Lord clearly here Abel offered a better sacrifice and gave that made the difference and God gave evil eternal life this year salvation is my revelation salvation is by revelation no matter the seminary teacher the pastor teaches you God reveals to you that Jesus Christ that Jesus is the Christ that is the blood that cleanses you and God is your Savior you will never have eternal life it's the spiritual revelation that doesn't in other words it's the spiritual revelation that gives you genuine salvation the revelation of Jesus Christ who is the word of God in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh the spiritual revelation of him Jesus Christ not just Jesus but Jesus Christ revealed and make clear to you is what gives you salvation hallelujah now the disciples asked Jesus in the book of Acts Lord who at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel see they were taking of an earthly Kingdom they have no understanding or revelation yet that his kingdom was not yet of this world and to a great degree we understand that even Jesus could not give them a clear revelation on that because before his revelation he says I don't know what the father I in this mind concerning these things but after his resurrection he rose up and he it was able to tell them clearly about his ministry his mandatory of ministry oh and the Word of God glory fight now the glorified Word of God kid could now make itself clear to these various apostles quotation now the father had not yet revealed it to him but now after his death and resurrection at this particular time in this editorial ministry he is able to set forth here in this revelation of himself and to John what his glory and presence in the church would mean and do hallelujah now what is his glory and presence in the church supposed to do o believers what a revelation do you recognize what I'm saying that you and I and many others have caught this revelation just of that this talk of the glory of his person and presence his presence in the true church what that would do what did it do to you well it was revealed to you that you are his gene you are his attribute and that he was in you and is in you from the for the foundation of the world and puts you in the position that you recognize Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever his power his presence his glory in the church today brother he lives he lives he lives Christ Jesus lives today oh he walks with me and he talks with me all along slice wonderful way amen glorious revelation is what reveals to us and gives to us the authority the power and the boldness and the certainty of who we are so that we have instead of the devil prevailing against you or I or against the church that Church the true church will prevail against him and overcome him by the Word of God and by our testimony to the token blood of Jesus Christ than a sprinkler that has been dubbed upon the doorposts of our hearts where God said I'll pass over you hey man thanks me to God as sons of Duns of the Living God that we can be here tonight looking at the Word of God and saying I can see clearly now because all the darkness is gone the gloom is gone the clouds are gone and I can see Jesus only I cannot see all of these denominational opinions I can't hear the opinions of men anymore I can't hear anymore of the voices in the world all I can hear is a voice of God in these last days speaking to my heart thanks God for evermore no Satan hits this revelation and he hits all Revelation and a reason why is because this especially of Revelation tells about the end of the devil of course the book of Genesis tells about his his past and where he came from and a book of Isaiah and many other prophets reveal his rise his deceit trail of the serpent his lies his murders his destruction and his his being cast down out of heaven the emotion the motive he was action they demoted from his original position and became nothing but a loser a wastrel a wayward blackguard a renegade and one that is a wonderer of the wastelands here we see clearly in the Word of God why Satan has the cause to hit Revelation he hits Revelation instead of education education is good he hates revelation and he hates but he he just loves systems because by systems he can anticipate he knows what is coming but revelation comes upon the sons and daughters of God and in the words of Jesus the wind bloweth where it listeth and no man knows where it would but he that is born of the Spirit so Satan cannot anticipate what God is going to do through your life and that sends him wild and crazy whipping his tail around doing everything possible to upset unbalance and try to prevail against you discourage tempt lie rumors whatever against you but thank God the word says he shall not prevail against the true Church of the Living God but he hits on Revelation he hits this book of Revelation and he spews out his lies true lots of preachers teachers tell no jokes scientists bringing up all kinds of theories conspiracies against the Word of God and so in this in this book these books of Genesis and revelation and one we find his original in the other book in the book revelation we find his total destruction and his end it's all written before it actually happens we see all of his awful ways of destruction that he will bring on the face of the earth and Jesus made it clear John 10:10 but the thief cometh not but for to kill not to steal but I am come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly oh the devil is a father of lies the devil is a destroyer but God is a healer for he said I am the lord that he let me he God is our God is a deliverer and we thank God for that now Satan hates revelation because revelation exposes him every time he tries to ambush you ambush the church hide behind some disguise is unveiled he's uncovered he's revealed his work is made clear and so the believer can take the necessary steps to withstand him so this book of Revelation tells of his end and it tells us the end of his followers those that will hold on to his tales his line tales that he tells and follow him all the way and allow him to drag them right into hell along with it with himself for if you identify with Christ you have gonna Hammond you're identifying with the devil and be a slave of the devil with his habits with his sin with his evil thoughts on this evil character then you paying the price with your representation certainly we see friends that these two books expose him and Satan hates to be exposed lay because the word expose is is like saying casting light on a person or a spotlight on a person or a situation so Satan hates the light he hates to be exposed or revealed to who he is he loves to make himself appear as a as a angel of light but then when God's light is turned on it's revealed that he is an angel of darkness he is the devil and that is he's a creature of darkness his people and his children are a children of darkness by darkness I mean Satan lusts to keep people in spiritual ignorance and in spiritual darkness of who they are who their father is their real origins where they come from and where is their destiny this is what he does he hits the entire Bible and keeps trying to keep it from people he tries to do it one he does it first of all by hindering its writing first of all the Bible was not yet written and after believers begin to write the Bible Paul and some of the others Luke Matthew and the others began to write the Bible then certain ones he began to try to hinder it because what he'll take it and hold on to it lock it up within his various seminaries and monasteries and places like that and claim ownership over it like that and then when that began to creep out or seep out into the population then what did he do he began to try to hinder the printing of it men like William Tyndale in 1494 that began to try to print the final so that can be had by the common people under the auspices of this wonderful this King James I think it was good King James or later on that wanted this Bible printed so that all the common people can have access to the Bible once the Bible got printed he changed his strategy and started burning the Bible burning the people that read the Bible killing them persecuting them oh thank god I say again for King James who began to proliferate the Bible and then once he continued doing that the next thing he did after that was start locking the Bible up in the churches and as a boy I literally saw one of those Bibles in one of those churches with a literal brass padlock on it it had a latch and had a key and a padlock was on it and only the priests had a key that he could open that lock and read out of this book which brought fear and mystery upon the people and they were given this lie that only the priests only the preachers could understand the Bible but thank God that's been lifting away from the people that's been the scales have dropped off all right and we could recognize that when we look we can see Jesus only standing there in all of his marvelous glory yes sir no he began to perpetrate that lie that only the priests and the preachers had the right to interpret the Word of God but we know that God is his own interpreter and he is the one only he the author can tell you about himself only God can reveal his own word to his own people and make it plain and clear to them blessed be the name of our Lord God for evermore thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah now we understand revelation does not come by study it does not come by burning the midnight oil it is not based upon human intelligence but it's based upon God's grace and to whom he would reveal his word and make it known to themselves Oh blessed be the name of the Lord friends I thank God that he opened my eyes one day and you ought to thank God wherever you are that he opened your eyes to be able to see this message of this hour and if you have not heard of this as yet if you do not know that God sent a prophet by the name of William Allen Branham in our age o friend you can write to us text us at info at GN ministries dot org info at Jian ministries dot org we were being happy to receive your request for a book on the seven churches and all the marvelous and two full truths that God has made known to us in this age now this study will be continued next Wednesday and we are going to trust God that as we go into his word it will be made clearer and clearer and clearer oh I wish I was in my actual own church preaching and declaring the Word of God but here I am in this wonderful situation that we are surrounded by the devil does all he can to confine the Word of God to imprison the Word of God but thank God I am free I am free oh and the Word of God is freely given to you receive it within your hearts wherever you are believers rejoice feed on this and I will encourage you also at this time to go and read the revelation the revelation we find out that that is the series where brother Branham actually preached on these seven churches and brother Vale assisted him in doing the proper grammar and spelling and paragraphs stuff of that nature and while I might not let me say this some people have said that oh brother then wrote the seven church ages so they're not going to read it well you'll find there are quotations where brother Branham called this seventh seal this these seven churches just my book several times he call it nine book and talked about brother Vail assisting him with the grammar and the spelling for he was just an ordinary man oh but thanks be to God the way that flowed through him was endless and we thank God for a precious brother let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father thank you for your word here today we pray you bless your people and quicken father this part of the word that we have set for today to encourage and straighten and focus the hearts and minds of your people in the weeks ahead and they must have come until we are back in our own place free to declare your
