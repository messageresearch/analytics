Fink and then we're going to be reading from the book of Ephesians and then I'm going to also read from the amplified version the spring for the word father you just want to thank you tonight Lord that we could have this opportunity of joining our faith bringing each and every one of our little fire together at your to bring such a hapless fear of God or we could be under such great expectation and more to receive such a blessing from your word and what that is all we desire father that we could just be so caught up into heavenly places together Lord that we could see each other we could see each other's placing within the Word of God Lord just give us a perfect faith positive to be translated out of this dimension Lord we give you all the praise and all the glory inspiring our speaker inspire heroes or gods be set ourselves together in the Jesus Ephesians chapter 2 verse 21 it says in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord amen he may be seated in the Enterprise version it says in the book the whole structure is joining together and it continues to increase growing into a holy temple in the Lord a sanctuary dedicated set apart and sacred to the presence of the Lord isn't that beautiful next right brotherbrother says here we've got a ministry coming that's just exactly like the life of Christ what does that ministry identify the coming of the Lord amen now look at the age coming now right up to the headstone in the coming of the Lord then may know God in all creation is waiting for the church to find its place amen praise our Lord this is something that's just been stirring so much I must have been stirred in my heart I'm sure it's been stirring at your heart you know that as we draw closer to the final combination of this church being translated you know we don't want to be wasting time you want to know that we're in the service of God we want to know that that we're in our positions we want to you know sometimes we question court what is it that I'm supposed to be doing how is it that I am so important to your body why is it that you called us according to your purpose and that each and every one of our colleagues is very very important to the Lord that we it's not just about Oh God you know just decides to bring together a group of people and you know whoever is going to hear him and is willing to accept what it is that he's singing love will just totally turn turn they'll join in this church because you know it sounds good it's it kind of fits with what you know you know I believe or you know because you've got so many different interpretations of the Word of God out there now so many different denominations so many teachings on the body of Jesus Christ how can you possibly know which one is is the right one unless you yourself personally have come into a revelation of your personal calling in the body of Jesus Christ you will be a wonderer you will be wandering you will be you know you just won't be settled you just will feel completely satisfied but I believe that this is the outer where the bride Christ the church she will know the words the word she will recognize that she is a part of the word and that her part is important even he learned for this final aspect the final pact which is going to be a translation can take place amen break up next so what we're going to be looking at tonight is how it is that you have been shaped for your position you know other people back into the part 2 we looked into you know shape right and how it is that God has personally been working on our lives from the day for before the foundation to the brain and into exactly way needed you to be in order to properly fit into the body of Christ and into the church for this house because there's been a church that started from way back you know the Christianity started but when Christ came down to redeem the church it was then that the church had not even you know seed in the mind of God and now I was going to come into manifestation here on earth known as Christians known as the church that God was going to fulfill the New Testament Scriptures through amen and so this church has been coming down and there's been vigils all the way down you know they look at the pyramid we look at all the different ages and we know that there were individuals that were called under each and every one of those agencies and they all recognized the word for their day and wasn't allowed to do like Luther you know who threw us in the Catholic Church but when the revelation came to Luther that the just shall live by faith revelation of Revelation what they do we'll watch he was in the Catholic Church he talked to Revelation and what they do he left any marks every individual the Word of God is gonna cause them to be changed to be moved for whatever situation two three times a year right maybe no not at all you might miss a few years but the word comes to you in its season it comes to you to you you the son of God [Music] because God was preparing you all the way that's life and so the scripture says here in Psalms 139 I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well God was preparing you from before the foundation to the world he saw you he saw me if you both didn't shake too and when he saw that you would have to come into this world and he knew that you would be an attribute that would come to this up to his top of the come to his purpose that would be positionally placed in the body in that certain church age and dispensation he created you just the way he wanted to be he made you he prepared to he wonderfully made you so here next time so God has been molding and shaping you for ministry since you were born you know your past life you know here on earth and talking about ok because when you're born again it's a brand-new life but when you look back at your old life you start to see certain things certain attitudes certain ways that you were built you know I look back at you know going through grade school I was I was a bit of a troublemaker it's just you know I would always be kind of like you know at the office the principal you know and I thought I was going to Catholic school that was sister Xena she was about four foot tube and about four foot wide but she had a belt and she cared at that belt that she would use that belt and it would be you know like the strap back then used to get the strap and it was like calluses don't you roll her eyes like that you see there was a makeup and so God was using all of that shaping and molding and preparations because at some point in our lives God is gonna possession us and use us in a certain way this one I was always and I still have I love I love I love soldiers I love policemen I love secure it's just you know it's just something about it I love those those action you know heroes right they have super abilities I just just you know I'm fascinated by it and I've always loved and that I've come to realize is because we are super human beings in and just like Superman with the way he flies the strength we're gonna have that same time because we're can return to this earth one day for a thousand-year millennium [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and so he was preparing you and giving you all that you have got started you just read the scripture and so the next slide what is this verse telling us next it says that I am wonderfully complex and therefore I unique listen every single one of you is unique in the body of Christ you need to realize that and that's important to you to realize that actually sets you free from trying to duplicate or be something that you are not you need to be careful of that because God didn't you didn't didn't purposely call you so that you can call somebody else that's not the way he's built his body every one of us has a body there's only one liver there's certain organs that they operate in a certain way and they do things uniquely and without that you cannot live and so in the same way we're going to be looking here at the scriptures we're going to be seeing on this and God has purposely uniquely designed to achieve you individually for this purpose and for this birth and so I am unique as God's original masterpiece God doesn't make mistakes God knows exactly how you need to be and he wants you to be just happy I lose next he says I was created with meaning for any purpose it's that simple he called us and created us for a purpose and so next God gave me my personal [Music] it's not coming it's not moving are you using we'll just PowerPoint no amazing and you just go back to that just reopen it and just use the PowerPoint that just start from the beginning and bring us right to this slide please and so the first thing we read says that we were wonderfully complex we were unique as God's original masterpiece we were created with meaning for a purpose and God gave me you your personal and when we look at that next slide it says that he gave us spiritual gifts he gave us a heart he gave us abilities he gave us personalities and he gave us eat for experiences just keep yeah so exactly myself exactly yourself will help you review your history and discover how God has prepared you for a unique ministry that only you can fulfill okay so that's why if you want to know all the purpose of this study tonight is for us to just kind of reflect look back exactly your life look back in the way that God has shaped you and prepared you because it's going to give clues as to how who can move more effectively into your position in the body of Christ amen the next slide says all spiritual gifts have a common origin but her handed out what might work by the Spirit of God he decides who gets what and exactly how he was going to mold and shape you so now I'm gonna read from the book of first Corinthians chapter 12 it's not on here okay I'm just gonna read and you're kind of looking and you don't have to be read and I want you to see things I want you to recognize these people we've read the scripture before but now in the context of what we're looking at it says here you know Paul the signal concerning spiritual gifts brethren I would not have you England you know that you were Gentiles every way under these dumb idols even as you were left you know we can look back and it's just so true in a weaver you were moving about doing just of those what a part of getting you to understand that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calling Jesus accursed and that no man can say that jesus is the lord of my Holy Ghost he's naked so clear here that I recognize that you've been filled with the Spirit of God you've been awakened by the Holy Spirit which is Jesus said when the Spirit of God comes he will beat you with a guide you into all truth he's gonna beat you invited you into your position the Holy Spirit is going to guide you into your position because all the same here clearly you cannot recognize or call Jesus Christ Lord without the Holy Ghost there's so many teachers out there recognize Christ in your day the message for your day and so he says now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit it's not a different spirit that operates in the body of Christ it's the Holy Spirit that opens the body of Christ and there are differences of administration's but the same Lord you see it's all Christ it's all about recognizing that he's in control of his body and all he wants you to do is to come into harmony with his his and there are diversities of operations but that is the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal in other words if you've been given a gift it's because God wants you to edify the body of Christ not what you do to build up to encourage to strengthen the body of Jesus Christ regardless the position is the purpose is to strengthen the body to strengthen the planet the purpose of dog right here at good deeper mysteries in Burlington Ontario we need to we need to keep this focused because this is where God has placed you didn't place you in the world out there that can be placed you here this is where it all starts this is very you you start to act and operate in your position and so he says to another to another to another the working of this is all part of the operations of the [Music] [Music] [Music] actually strengthen fortify and build the church strengthen the leadership strengthening my pastor give them authority and and such confidence because of me being in that position and allow myself to be humble to whatever way that God wants me to be humble so that it can fulfill the purpose of God because Saints we're not here to stay here we're not here to get rewards here on earth we're not looking for rewards here I just deal them it makes so much xx a call about this is amazing you know a whole month and get excited sometimes and then realize in an hour he's on my mind together and there's nothing that can override for the rapture because you know you can sit down and you have a lovely meal with a family and a bit of that meal you think wow we're gonna have a supper with the Lord [Music] you see the purpose the priority here from your in this world you've got word don't get you know so spiritually minded they could go earthly good because this is all about balancing but listen don't you need to balance the fact that you're a son or daughter of God because if you are and you are you have authority and so you know as you read this there's so many gifts there's discernment of spirits and you know sometimes you wonder well how does that operating or is it what God has spiritual offices within the church has individuals that have the ability to discern certain spirits they don't realize it because it's a gift it's just that God is a place that they remember the gift is of God but it's not your gift maybe it's God's gift which is the same spirit that operates miracles [Music]
