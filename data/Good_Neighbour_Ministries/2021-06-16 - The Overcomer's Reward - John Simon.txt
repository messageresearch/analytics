TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] it's another wonderful wednesday night again and we are overjoyed to be gathered in the name of the lord it has been indeed a very eventful first part of the week we must encourage you by the grace of god to pray for one of our precious brothers that is preaching the word of god in this of this wonderful message on the island of jamaica that has been imprisoned build out of prison now um free taken right out of his pulpit placed in the jail and then the saints bailed him out and now he has to wait for trial on friday i would like to encourage you in the name of the lord to be in prayer for our precious brother asking the lord to give him words of inspiration direction wisdom protection and that god will overshadow the judge and give the wisdom of solomon that we might have just fair judgment by god's great purp to fulfill god's great purpose that his will may be done and the work of god continues and the message is growing and expanding everywhere and our faith is rising to a greater and higher height and we thank god and praise him for this last day as we see the message on a divine ascent upwards onwards may we ever go until we step right into the realms of glory but while we still we are still here let us watch wait work and let us give glory to god and honor to his marvelous name just to remind you this sunday is considered in a world as father's day for the christian every day is father's day mother's day christmas day and easter too but since it is considered that we would like to speak along those lines of fatherhood and what it takes to be a father and may god grant us inspiration to speak along those lines in these troubled times of mixed messages and misinformation my friend may the holy spirit direct us to the word amen i'd i would also love to make a local announcement to our local church here in burlington in ontario canada that our church will be partially reopened for service next sunday sunday the 27th partial reopening the deacons and the deacons in particular will deal with this matter and will alert those who will have the freedom to attend for all cannot attend because of the 15 restrictions that we have upon us but we are anxious we are rearing the goal we want to be together with the saints of god lifting up holy hands without wrath and without doubting giving praise and glory and honor to his name amen but now we are in the church ages we are in the study of god's word we are in the reception of truth and we are rejoicing here today our topic for today directly from the word of god is found in revelation chapter 2 verse 17. and we will uh say take for uh a theme the overcomers reward now let us read a scripture in revelation chapter 2 verse 17. he that had an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches to him that overcome it will i give to eat of the hidden manner and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knew it saving he that received it praise god righteous father once again we are privileged to approach you at this great in the throne room of prayer of mercy and grace and we have this privilege by the shed blood of our lord jesus and we thank you for this now father as we gather together in your name with partial human understanding forgive our frailties forgive our humanity and may the great holy spirit empower us and enable us that we might lord take the the portion of the word that is before us uh many have read these church age books but none of us if we think we know it or we read it before we know really nothing about it until you will take your word and speak to us so whatever father no matter how many years i might have read and reread it or anyone might have read it yet we account ourselves as knowing nothing unless you would speak to us again and so we want to receive this fraud father fresh from your precious presence and you take the glory honor and praise father in the name of jesus christ amen amen praise god hallelujah he that hat an ear to hear let him or her hear the word of god today may the holy spirit speak to us from the word now we know that each message to each age god always holds a carrot an incentive in front of believers to keep believers going to keep the saints of god always spurred on to come to fulfill his will and to carry out his word now the incentive of this age for the believer god is now presenting that to us the overcomers reward like anyone that will run in a race that will box in a ring anyone that will will take part in any sport they are looking forward to the victor's crown the overcomers reward now friends the scripture tells us hallelujah that uh this is what spurs the believer on we may use the word encourages the believer just strive to press the the battle to to go on with the lord to be an overcomer in all aspects of life whether in personal life church life whether it's since civilian life social life we want to be overcomers in the expression of the life of god in us and so we find that god offers a reward to every age and to every believer that will fight the battle stand firm with the word only believing the promise for your age and so a promise or a reward was made for this age and this age in this age the holy spirit promises the great reward an incentive to overcoming believers and he mentions two of these rewards first the hidden manner and secondly the white stone now we can make it three but it's mentioned so two hidden manner and the white stone for in the white stone is hidden a new name and that new name will only be known to the person who receives it because every heart knows its own joy the joy of salvation and none can intermittent with the joy that is in the heart of the true believer when they are recognized there made into a new creation a word creation brand new people men and women young people children changed by the power of god oh praise this marvelous name thank god and so god promises us hidden manna and this white stone god in in these two things let me touch a few things here god is giving us insight into the fact that once we have come in to his grace we will be having a constant continuous uninterrupted flow of revelation by the holy spirit once you are broken into this realm once the door opens once the portals to god's revealed truth once this dimension is open to you and you step into it you are now come into a time of a continuous flow of divine revelation hallelujah praise god secondly these two rewards is telling us that we from this moment we are not guilty because we have received forgiveness and cleansing by the blood of jesus christ we also have no condemnation within our hearts amen because we have allowed ourselves to be judged by the word amen as jesus himself said if you are allow yourself to be judged you will not be judged praise god you won't have to go into the white throne judgment amen because you allow yourself to be judged here on earth by the same word that is going to judge them amen back there ahead of time when god judges men and women for their sins done within this body now to illustrate you know in the old days the roman judges had a way of bringing forth judgment and their way was to have a pile of white stones on their desk and a pile of black stones on their desk and depending on the guilt or innocence or pardon for the person that is before them the judge will then call the one that is before him and give him a stone if the person is guilty then receive a stole a black stone which is a stone of guilt and a blackness of death then if the person is innocent he'll give them a white stone meaning that they are not guilty they are justified meaning that they are now free to go they are free praise god hallelujah and that there are accounted righteous in other words it's not on your record it's not even in the record anymore and nowhere on the earth can anyone uh bring that against you you were up before a judge or you were in jail or you were this no the scripture tells us here that the true believer has been judged not guilty amen not just pardoned but not guilty and justified by the grace of god not dwelling on this but it also speaks to us that we will we are given a new character a new expression of ourselves a new life a new manifestation of our walk with god and so here we see it friends we have a new character for real recognizes that our character is what paul spoke about he says it is not i that live here anymore not i that live but christ the word that lives within me and that's what has happened to us it is not i that live it is not you that live amen but the word is finding expression in you and through you and it's the word jesus christ that is living in us today hallelujah praise god forevermore amen praise god now friends receiving the word is greater than even receiving any vision and i want you to know the bible tells us how that we will be caught up and so shall we ever be with the lord but i want you to know that caught up being caught up is not something that is going to happen down the road somewhere that is when it comes to its culmination or its fullness amen that's the end point of it the literal physical caught up but by the revelation of this word of god to you you are already caught up and being caught up amen into the presence of the living god because right now you're being caught up into heavenly places amen in christ amen you're being caught up in the heavenly place of recognizing who you are where you come from your journey of life amen and where you are going that's a heavenly place and you're already being caught up you're being caught up by seeing these revelations of justification amen you never did it in the first place and many others but that's not our topic for today but just to show you that we are in the very process now we are in the rapture process we are in the caught up process we are in the resurrection restoration process right now the holy spirit with the divine convergence is bringing everything to its fullness glory to god hallelujah and he has placed us in a position as receptors amen of his righteousness of his peace of his goodness and of his resurrection and rapture power that is catching us up into the presence of the living god amen hallelujah now we know the bible tells us revelation 1 i john was on the isle of patmos and there on the isle of patmos where there were snakes where there were scorpions like a believer in a world full of trouble and trial but while you are on that island your own personal trials and your own personal problems john said that was going on around me what kind of snake serpents everything else trying to bite me and sting me but in the middle of that i was caught up in the spirit on the lord's day glory to god of course that doesn't mean saturday that means god's day the lord's day hallelujah amen but he was caught up in the spirit of the in the of the lord's day amen and i thank god that that same spirit of revelation that caught up john and took him up to see all the unfolding of the word to the very ending of the age of man my friends that's the same spirit of revelation amen john type in the bride that now has come upon the believers praise god to catch them up by the process of revelation from the word of god caught up into heavenly places in jesus christ amen the revelation that was being made known to john met him raped sometimes mad him cry sometimes mad him laugh sometimes make him feel sad sometimes but he was caught up by the revelation amen and i want to repeat that is what is happening to us right now that's why sometimes we are beside ourselves because of the supernatural operation of the holy spirit in your wine skin the same holy spirit that dropped on john that caught john up amen to look into tomorrow amen the same god is anointing his beloved bride in this hour and he or she that happened here to hear let them hear what the spirit is saying to this age now last sunday i touched on beyond the curtain of time and that is exactly where this revelation is taking us beyond the curtain of time until we step fully over right now we're back and forth having glimpses come back having glimpses back and forth but one day we'll step right into that dimension never to return anymore but to live with him in the eternal ages to come glory to god but in that beyond the curtain of time i told you how brother branham met these multitudes of people in heaven as he was caught up as paul was caught up and so was this messenger caught up and saw multitudes that believed his message crying our precious brother and then when he he spoke about his message and answered the angel of god or the person speaking to him i preached exactly what paul preached and i did not divert in any way from what they preached hallelujah amen oh praise god and oh glory to god and he said i preach exactly what paul preached and the entire multitude shouted we are resting on that oh glory to god hallelujah we are resting on that praise god when once you know that you have received the perfect word amen you have received the fullness the seven course meal from the word of god the totality the fullness of all the seven messengers pouring out the seven thunders of truth through this last messenger amen my friends you come to a place of rest you come to a place of peace you come to a place of understanding of patience all the get fruits of the spirit and you can say like those multitudes that were up there in glory we can say we are not there yet but we can say while we are here i am resting on that you can say it again i am resting on that thank god hallelujah amen praise god i believe god has a special reward for all of his messengers that were faithful and discharged their responsibility in preaching the word now those were the seven church age messenger but he's also speaking of every real preacher of this message every man every woman and every child that would testify of this message amen praise the lord hallelujah god has a special reward for you and i as we discharge our responsibility for we have received the revelation i have received it and from the day i received it i began to faithfully preach it without fair favor without any type of financial incentive praise god hallelujah not looking ahead at anything else but looking straight to jesus and i heard it i believe that and i began to preach the word and also to live the word of the living god for we are asked to receive it but and then we're asked to testify of it but then we must also become living voices we must live the word and let our actions speak louder than our voices are our spoken word amen god promises i will give them the hidden manna amen of course mana was angel's food manna was also perfect food for them they just had to eat manna and it was perfect food manna was also a supernatural or miraculous food it was a healing food it was an amazing food for them to eat because they at that manner and was never sick they ate that manna and it was miraculous effects within their natural body and in their march hallelujah the bible doesn't tell us that they got tired or or anything of that nature but just miraculous supernatural health and strength was excluding from them it was pouring into them from the crown of their heads to the soul their feet they were just bursting with health their skin oh their blood clear their their hearts beating with vitality amen and they were able to march and walk all day in the hot sun for 40 years because they were eating angels food amen may god give us strength not to walk in that wilderness but we are in the wilderness of this present world with all kinds are snakes and all kinds of poisonous snakes and all kinds of hot troubles and trials temptations all around us and we are required to be tried and proven in the wilderness by this prop word of god hallelujah on the hunger thirst need everything else just as they did but we are receiving it for our day and for our time amen praise god god's word is always looked upon as bread hidden manna hidden bread given to us perfect bread given to us now man on earth doesn't have a real perfect food they're trying to put together the vitamins that they might have the perfect element and every once in a while they said they discovered the perfect food but the perfect whole food for man is that he should not live by natural bread or things alone but by the word of god hallelujah that feeds his soul that he can grow into the spirit of the living god hallelujah now right after the death of the early church fathers and by that i mean john the revelator being the last apostle that actually died and then some of the other saints that followed him like polycarp and so on we find that after they left the scene nobody seemed to know the exact truth of the word of god like the apostles had and so the devil made sure that he mixed up everything and the truth of god was lost and in short this word this manner seem to become hidden to the people let me repeat seems like the original word the manna that fell under their pentecost to the apostles seem to become hidden to the people so god by revelation giving to every age god allah to the messenger and every age which is every age to israel god's god sent a messenger to us to bring his word and he reveal a portion of that to that messenger until our day when he gave the revelation through the messenger of revelation 10 7 how that the prophet in this last day will come and reveal not some but all of the mysteries and then the lord will come again and i want to say that in each age these messengers receive the word for their age let me express it this way you see for israel they receive fresh manna for each day that they were marching and they could not keep the manna over into a next day but they received fresh manna for each day for us as gentiles god sent a messenger with fresh manga of revelation for each age or each gentile day and for each age god sent fresh hit manna to each gentile revelator or messenger that he sent and as i've said to you in the early church ages on the nickelodeon ism that balaamism and so on a romanism their truth of god was mixed up and the manna seemed to become hidden amen hallelujah but then god promised he would restore the word again and give it to his people amen and so praise god god always does it this way the lord repeat give the bread to the disciples and tell them to distribute it to the multitudes and so is it in this day god gave his word to a messenger who distributed it out to the multitudes preachers men called to be ministers caught the revelation of that word and it is their responsibility now to share that word out to the multitudes that are waiting for the broken bread of the word of god hallelujah we thank god he has opened his treasure house and poured out his word upon us and would not do it for those who reject him and reject his word hallelujah amen so i thank god that what we have received is not some uh rotten stored up in a denomination word but this is the same fresh word that the apostles had that was stored up in the golden pot under the altar of god and the manna stayed fresh one portion stayed fresh hallelujah and only the high priest the priest could go in to get from that pot thank god he had messengers that he allowed to get from that pot and take god he had a messenger a high priest in our age that was able to receive the word for our age and bring it back to us fresh like the day it was sent from the presence of the living god hallelujah amen this does not speak my friend only of us partaking of the word now but it also points to the fact of our future partaking because we will partake of the word now and when we are tr when we translate or when we are brought in raptured in to the literal very presence of the lord we will continue to partake of the knowledge of the word in other words we will still have a thirst to know jesus and more about jesus and we will have all our questions unanswered questions answered while we are there in heaven and we'll be able to talk with him walk with him about queen's justice answered by him through the endless eternal ages our hearts will be filled with joy with the passion presence glory of god as we talk about the lord continuing to eat the word hidden manna hidden in his presence walking with him talking with him on the golden streets by the flowing streams of life revelation hallelujah flowing from the presence of god amen and our hearts rejoicing night and day as we walk with him amen sometimes we think we get to know a little bit of the lord down here and just that little bit that we begin to know about the lord down here causes us to feel so good make us rejoice and shout sometimes cry in the presence of the lord somehow sometimes pull off the road amen and stop by the side of the road before we drive again because the anointing hits us the joy the lord becomes our strength fills our soul and rejoice in him amen but think about the hour when we enter into our eternal partaking of the word of god the knowledge of the lord jesus christ being unveiled to us as we sit in his divine presence and that word think of it we're receiving the little we're receiving in this flesh but one day when this flesh is completely changed by the presence of god and we seated in the presence of the lord and the word is making himself known to us he himself the interpreter of the word the author of the book is making himself known to us and we are receiving that hallelujah and we have no limitations of him of feeling emotion or anything oh praise god you're limitless in everything you do say think whatever and the word is making itself known to us he'll become so real it's beyond anything we might have a dream i have a thought about praise god we might not have thought it possible but praise god it will be because he has promised it in our day thank god he said to the overcomer not only will i give the hidden manner but i'll give him a white stone lord of god and give you some insight into what is the one meaning of receiving that white stone and what it actually means praise god for in that white stone hallelujah is a new name and not to uh expand on that but name nature all that works runs together he'll give you a new name amen a change nature praise god hallelujah you recognize your change nature your change name praise god in other words you recognize who you really are to begin with and who you really are in time lord of god hallelujah we know according to scripture abraham's name was changed abram to abraham say right to sarah jacob his name was changed after testing trial wrestling with god to israel prince with god and you know also simon peter his name was changed to peter and for saul to paul by the grace of god after the great revelation and so with every one of us as the word makes itself known to us hallelujah and so today each one of us true believers have had a change of name praise god amen in other words you've had a change of nature you have a change in your actions your activity your your unconscious responses and reactions being changed you don't know but you know that is repentance it's reception by the blood of christ the forgiveness of god in your whole life that has transformed you and changed you to this hour this moment of time and space that we are living in and now are true we are named christians amen the new name is christians that we have received but that's only a general name but god will grant to you the knowledge of your own individual name amen the name christian is coming to all of us praise god but some future name will be made known to you as the lord makes it clear within your heart and one day we are going to have another change and it's not going to be the one that we just had on earth from from reckon you were once uh acting and living like a sinner to only know that all that time while you thought you were a pig you were not really a pig you are a lamb or a sheep that thought you were a pig amen lord of god you did not change from a pig to a lamb but you were always a lamb but acting and fooling around in a dirt and a mess but you are always a lamb acting like a pig but the power of god and the word make itself clear to you until you recognize who you were and begin the way to live the way that god wants you to live live the way the nature in you wants you to live live the way that your new name your new lifestyle wants you to live amen you certainly will receive a new name with this new change that will come in the future remember i'm separating it you have a change here on earth and you name here on earth but then there's another change the rapture brings another one total deliverance and you receive a new name fully oh praise god i want to quote directly from brother branham amen now friends it could well be that was our true original name that was written in the lamb's book of life from the foundation of the world and he knows that name but we do not now we don't know that name now you see that's blackened from us that's gone from our memories because of sin and being on the earth here but at one day in his good pleasure we will know that new name also praise god for we were the sons and daughters of god praising and worshiping god in his presence and he said it clearly in the book of john the gospel of john i know my sheep and i know them and i call them by their name hallelujah and they know me and they answer me oh praise god hallelujah my friends we can't remember all of that that we were once there and that he knew us and we knew him and he knew our name and we knew our name we can't remember it while we're here but slowly he's bringing our memories back by revelation and by catching up into uh heavenly places in christ bringing us back into familiar places of the world that we might recognize who he is who we are and where we come from for he knows our name oh a white stone how beautiful amen receiving recompense from the presence of god receiving rewards from the hand of god for the trials we have gone through for the testings we have born for the temptations the buffetings the persecutions that we have gone through receiving from the very hand of god the white stone now on earth in the days of crescent time that false church received their rewards here they were given out of the state treasury out of the government's treasury constantine gave them beautiful cathedrals lovely buildings lovely beautiful artistic statues and statuary or statuaries and these statues were usually made of white marble to this day you may go witness some of them made with white marble which were actually roman idols renamed as saints yes my friends and the church's furnishings to this day are exceptionally beautiful indeed and god but god was not with them amen but where was god if he's not in such a beautiful place not in such beautiful places with sun births high altars beautiful dressed priests with wonderful processional grounds and colors and statues statuaries and so on my friends god is not there with them where is he listen tell you god is with his saints some little house meeting somewhere god with his little people fear not little flock it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom he is in some cave where the believers have to hide because the the the religious leaders are the false church will go and report them and call for their persecution but god is watching over his own and protecting his children amen what praise god amen the true church sometimes don't have beautiful buildings the true church don't have those ground choirs dressed up like angels no sir fine clothes the true church doesn't have those wonderful programs and beautiful ceremonies like that my friends they don't have all the fine clothing amen but god has given us a special promise that he has promised to believers that will live for him that he will give them rewards of eternal beauty hallelujah that will not like buildings not one stone will be left upon another but eternal rewards of eternal duration that will never fall apart but will be there forever and forever so let the wealthy look down upon the poor them give their large sums to the churches let them give it to the church knowing full well that they're going to be recognized actually some of them give it to be recognized amen some of them deliberately give it to get the tax breaks from the church just the church has just been used for their own means and so on amen hallelujah yes sir or that they're going to be praised by the priests pope or pastor my god and that's what is happening my friends that they will receive all that and they will have a statue maybe put up in their honor in public so that everybody could recognize their goodness and how they walk amen oh my goodness and so that's what would happen that there would be applauded but someday god promises in his word that he sees and knows everything that we do and we are doing for him hallelujah and that he wants more is going to command us like he commended that widow the woman that gave two mites amen hallelujah and placed it in the church and the pharisees who came with large sums and through it also and jesus said that woman gave more than them all together amen and he said he would reward her and so he will reward us in this hour amen for your all husbands are dead your all denominational husbands are all dead amen and we are now married to this the true revealed word of god for the hour and he has promised that he would reward us with eternal treasures from heaven out of the eternal treasure treasuries of god the great storehouse that god has yes honored blessed rewarded with the hidden manner which has started already within your name which is ready start to phase in itself in a white stone hidden in the revelation how good is the lord to us to reward us so wonderfully and yet we are so undeserving undeserving everything we receive from god we should not go around expecting anything back from him but god by his own grace by his own choosing turns around and blesses us and rewards us amen that we will get ready for this day and for this time and as the bible tells us don't you worry about the laying up of treasures here on earth where mart rust corrupt and destroy but lay up presence for yourself lay up treasures in heaven amen that's where we need to send our investments and our treasures is lay them up in heaven oh praise god may god bless you with this wonderful time of spending in the word of god speaking on this wonderful topic of the overcomers reward may you and i may we together receive the overcomers reward and live the rest of our earthly life with excitement with anticipation and incentive to receive that reward from the hand of the living god may the lord bless you and may you turn around and shake the hands of your brothers and sisters or give them a call encourage somebody tell them how much you love them and the grace of god be with us all amen [Music] you
