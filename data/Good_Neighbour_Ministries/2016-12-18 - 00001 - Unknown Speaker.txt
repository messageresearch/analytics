Eagles took their flight and we are happy for her and uh we're happy for the family too they took it in the right way of course they WEP they GED and everything else but they're believer and they

people came from everywhere uh and uh you know different people from everywhere and the the funeral Hall was spilled and spilled over into the foe uh there were people all around so we were happy to

with him until they can see that he's kind of adjusting and stuff like that so uh let's continue to pray for them right that God will help them in every possible way of course I'll be calling them from time to time and we'll see how the Lord will lead glory to God but I'm happy to have been associated with a wonderful Saint like that a wonderful believer like that we talked about her and uh used the the the topic she did what she could she did what she could and I believe that she did what she could well God bless you we know our livs here are like a Morning Mist the sun comes up and it's gone so all of us ought to be ready as the scripture says prepare to meet thy God we always have to be prepared amen okay so let's uh go into our topic for tonight uh God's grace and uh this

you're welcome everybody's welcome let's get together there and let's just have a wonderful time together on that wonderful uh day after after the service 5:00 in the afternoon turn to Psalms 23 it's a beautiful song and I'd like to use the last verse and just like as a background uh topic here hallelujah okay let's read this together I believe everybody knows this so some of you I know maybe know it by heart but I have still read the Bible the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want how wonderful feel like preaching on this tonight instead can you say that read scripture like that and just read it like you're reading a novel does it mean what it says and do we really believe what it say if the Lord is your Shepherd am I going to lead you into triying pastors where there is nothing no food or nothing is God going to lead you there that is why David said the Lord is my shepherd if he's not leading anybody else I he's leading me amen the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want be want amen I shall not be in want because the Lord is my shepherd he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake y though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table for me in the presence of my enemies now anointest my head with oil my cup run over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever that's my thought is right in those words I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever father we thank you once again for the great privilege of your sending us your written word and sending us the prophet and the Holy Spirit to interpret the word we pray that you'll bless us in the Simplicity of the this moment like you bless us on Sunday and father may your great Holy Spirit take all the praise the honor and the glory in Jesus name amen the Lord bless you richly Hallelujah now uh just to get right to it we know that when Israel crossed into the Promised Land one of the first uh stories that that we uh we find there is the story of RAB the Harlot and spiritual people understand that the story of RAB the harl is your story and my story spiritually speaking we were uh uh harlots to the denominations we jump from one to the other because we were searching for the love of God understand that's a Lev meaning there but I hope you understand what I'm saying they really uh searching for love searching for the love of God and jumping from one denomination but is Mr Baptist Mr Methodist where you know we're jumping from one to the other uh like that but in the middle of that there was something buried inside of rahab's heart and Reon said notice that she was a gentile woman but she asked for Mercy praise God even before the invasion of Israel she had a revelation that they were coming she had a revelation that there was going to be a change amen the age was going to change something was going to take place and she uh decided uh she knew that the denominations could not the Nations couldn't beat Israel God from their uh former uh uh their former uh what should I say what's the word I want here record every nation that came against them when they were coming out of Egypt even the mighty Egyptian Empire was defeated by Israel and the god of Israel so she knew these lesser uh demonic Nations uh could not defeat Israel and therefore when she got in contact with the spies she asked for Mercy amen not for herself only but for her household amen if they were willing to come into her house and the signal that would she would leave a Scarlet colored cord hanging in the window it wasn't a cord it was actually a rope right uh it was actually a fat red rope that they could see clearly and so she was asked to leave that but you know many times we sing and we read the scriptures and and we use the term about uh bringing all your loved ones in and in the message it was preached in such a way as if you can just whale pray every one of them in but brother gr and before used to say every baby that was born is going to heaven the said no if it's elected it goes to heaven right praise the Lord hallelujah it's the same way with our relatives if they are elected they go to heaven amen so it's the same way RAB had the right to tell them what was going to happen just like how we're telling them right now what's going to happen we have the right to tell them what's going to happen what dangers lie ahead tell them about coming events how was made clear by indicated prophecy yes and they have absolute right to come into her house or come under the protection of the blood but if they refus they would perish like anybody else it's the same thing today you be by becoming a True Believer of the word of God has a right to share what you have with all your relatives and friends and and give them a heads up a warning right to come under the protection of the blood and if they do not he the warning warning then son of man the blood is off of your hands amen but if you don't warn them the blood will be on your hands amen we must warn them of the things that are going to be so that they have the opportunity of being able to to take themselves out of peritter Amen anyway the fact is the sign was to place a rope a red Scarlet colored rope in the window which is symbolic of the token which is a symbol of the blood of Christ and if I might that's individ but prophetically and scripturally it speaks of the blood of Christ redemption's plan running from Genesis right through to Revelation from Genesis where he says the seeding woman will bruise the Serpent's head that red cord of redemption runs right through the entire Bible right to the Book of Revelation it ties that also okay but it tipes now the holy spirit for God is a spirit and he can't shed natural blood that's he had to take a body down from his glory and die so that he can shed blood that you and I could see but really it wasn't the chemicals of the blood when we see the There Is Power in the Blood but it was the life that was in the blood and the life that was in the blood was the Holy Spirit so God shed Spirit blood if you want to put it that way God shed Spirit blood amen and so uh this cord typ the token of the Holy Spirit and we want to thank God that we have the talken today in the form of the Holy Spirit it took a prophet to make that clear to us even when I was in all Pentecostal denomination we sing There Is Power in the Blood Power in the Blood power the blood we s about the blood of Jesus and we were visualizing the red blood dropping from his head and down his face which we still can but now we have the understanding that it wasn't the red chemistry brother BR put it this way he says not to be uh sounding Blasphemous and sacriligious but that blood dried up 1900 years ago but the life that was in the blood lives today and that life is the holy spirit if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you he shall also Quicken your of God even if the devil puts you in a grave he'll bring you out amen the Bible said even if you were in the sea even if you are eaten by lions he'll call and you'll answer amen amen praise God hallelujah so here it is that uh she uh had that token and she had to put it outside of her window you know what type that is telling you it's all right to say you have the Holy Spirit but it is not effective until you put it on public dis you must put it on public display suppose she said oh if I put the the cord in the window all the rest of the of the inhabitants of this city that knows that that that these Israelites are coming are going to think I'm a spy and and they going to grab a hold of me they're going to call me names they're going to throw me in jail at that point she had a revelation and she didn't care what they said and what happened to her life anymore she knew she was saved by the blood amen and we are saved by the blood but we must put it on public display you can't keep it in the house who knows about it if you got it covered in the blood covered up in your house the doors all locked your mouth locked everything locked up you have locked jaw you can't speak about it you can't talk about it you can't display it in your walk in your talk in your life all you got to do is say oh I'm a Christian I'm a citizen here I'm a Christian no it's got to be on public display so that they will know I am never going to be ashamed of him praise the Lord every Christian to take up their cross and follow Jesus UNAM and bear the reproach for the word of this hour amen oh there's a lot of reproach with it before it was a wonderful thing saying you're in the message oh praise the Lord you know a prophet has come he's got healing he's got miracles he's got gifts but now there's people that were once with the spirit of Judas right in the message head with him slept with him and then walked away from him and then used whatever he Tau them to turn it back against him until now uh the prophet's name start to become a b word and a proverb and just like the name name Christian was not something digifi it was like a curse word back there it was call you a criminal wasn't something to be proud up oh he's a Christian you Christian you see it was used in a disparaging way but now the devil come into this denominations and made it so dignified and high and mighty until every fil star want to say they're Christian even though the mascara streaks down their face while they're crying on their they have to be careful they don't stick themselves in the eye this still Christian every Governor every mayor they feel it's a part of your resume that you have to have there to give you credibility is that right oh my God Corin you know two Corinthians will certainly give you credibility in other words you have to show that you know the Bible or something about the Bible right that's what it was but praise the Lord God wants us brothers and sisters to stay under the blood amen she had to dwell in her house and we have to say I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen you're under his protection you're under his blood you're under his provision you're in his house and you're under his provision you're under his protection you're under his preservation you're precious to him and you're under the blood oh I want to stay under that blood I want to stay under the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen you see when reab after she was spared she got all of her people in everything that was under the core was saved in Egypt everything that wanted to be under that blood Strike the Blood over the door and anybody in that house where the blood is on the door everyone in that house will be saved you know the Egyptians even had an opportunity if they rushed in there and I think there were a few of them the Bible said that believe uh what Moses preached and ran some of the Jewish arms they were no minority but they were saved under that blood that sign of the blood amen praise God and Hallelujah he said they were saved under the blood in Egypt all was under the scarlet cord were saved and now all under the blood of Jesus Christ is saved am Hallelujah yes sir that's the way it is glory to God and you know the rest of our story how she uh she fell on the the eyes I think it's was Solomon uh Solomon uh here in the book brother R said Solomon but it wasn't Solomon you know and that's why they pick up all these stupid little things and oh he he made a mistake there Solomon wasn't even there whatever it's salon right and so Salon Prince of Israel got married to her H and and here that she was uh saved praise the Lord amen so brothers and here you can see already Jesus as Gentile connection you understand here also he's setting up the symbol the type and the shadow that he the prince is going to marry a gentile bride right with a questionable background of sin but he is going to redeem or save her or deliver her by marrying her is that right how are we Sav by the invisible Union of the brighten Christ by the word with your soul that is how you're saved by the word with your soul salvation is by Revelation amen the denominations have it salvation is just confession amen but we know that people today use that as a as a c oh I'm sorry they kick you one time I'm sorry and said but you're supposed to forgive me and they kick you again you're supposed to forgive me and they use that as a c that's what the devil is doing today oh the man apologized so you should forget that oh yeah but it's not coming from the heart is that right salvation is by Revelation amen how you going to even confess if it wasn't reveal to you that you sin are going to be are you going to even confess and hope to be saved if you no revelation of your Savor how you want to how you going to be saying you have no revelation of the blood you don't even know what you repenting for see so salvation is by Revelation amen amen remember that just simple statement salvation is by Revelation something had to be revealed to you before you could truly be born again and now after uh Rahab we read the story of Naomi and Ruth and here again we see another he's setting up another type and another symbol of course uh this another type this other symbol is Ruth a gentile woman who was formerly thought to be a moabite priestess and again the moabite Priestess which was uh similar I'm not saying every Catholic none is like that but the Babylonian system was that priestesses were there to serve the needs of those priests and certain times of the year they they had festivals Under The Groves that's why God start was against these Groves and and these Mountain uh uh altars that they used to have it was pure harlotry and homs on certain nights of the year when the moon was in certain uh positions and so for her to be come out from the background of being a m Priestess I'm let you know it plain clear so you understand what actually God did CU you just read the Bible Ruth left with you know the background of actually what it all is about so she comes from that kind of a background but she saw something in the light of Naomi and when Naomi left she said oh your God is not going to be my God what she c a revelation she caught a revelation enough to sell out or kick out our all Babylonian religion like we did amen and be able to follow her mother-in-law change the age from Pentecost right to the message of the hour what's the message of the hour Mo I love you I want Maria praise God I'm taking your home with me that was the message that she got and the same message we got praise God hallelujah amen and so we see here that Ruth this great moabit just like Rahab the Harlot was saved by the blood amen saved by marriage to boas what a background that they came from but to think about it that Solomon was the one that founded uh Bethlehem founded Bethlehem and he founded Bethlehem all with along with Rahab amen praise the Lord amen and now we see it come to the place where uh we get back to the text that we were touching on before how why he live with Bethlehem why was he born in Bethlehem in the Book of Psalms of Prophecy already said behold Bethlehem among the uh tribes of Judah uh this man was born there that's before Jesus was born uh those words were spoken and and the priest didn't recognize that uh none of them recognize that but brother BR said a crack named Simeon a blind woman named Anna is that right a carent a nobody and all priest that was ready to retire my God a bun of them no man people recognized that the Christ was upon the Earth Messiah was on earth now amen they recognize it and the priest didn't know anything about it oh my when the wise man came he came knowing and the priest didn't know where is he born King of the je they knew he was born King of the Jews but we come to worship him oh we don't know of any King the Jews accept the denomination I mean that's ruling over us all these years that's all we know about the that's the only King that we know that's ready to kill anybody that come against him or differ with him in his doctrine of of his kingship uh and rulership uh that's all we know about but the king said you know go and investigate this and the Bible says after the priest went which means they didn't know they came back and say yeah we found where it is written in the prophets and they quoted him about Bethlehem thou Judea art not thou the least amount the princes but out of the shall come a governor that shall rule My People Israel amen praise be to God they found it but look a whole bunch of no man people founded before them what a what to think about it they were blinded by the holy spirit amen yes sir praise God and God has a way doing things he keeps his spatter amen if God with simple Ordinary People he will continue to do just that amen now when job died he told them where to bury him when Abraham died he B SP of land and told him to bury him there now by the way uh brother BR isn't saying this here but in other places he said none of them like physically knew that that was actually the spot where Adam died and then uh they they come and joob wanted to be buried there by inspiration he wants to be buried the same place not knowing that Adam died on that Hill they want to be buried there and Abraham comes behind and and and he goes and buys that spot land and say oh bury me and Sarah you got Buri us right there and they got buried there and Jacob went up into Egypt you know with his sons to meet Joseph up there and when he was dying he made Joseph put his hand behind his thigh and swear to him that you are not going to leave my body here in Egypt but take me up and bury me beside Abraham and he took him back and buried him where Abraham was a man Joseph died if you read I believe around the end of the book of Exodus or J where he says take every one of my bones up with you don't leave one bone back here bury it back there right there praise the Lord outside of Egypt praise the Lord listen to The Prophet what was it they recognized and knew the first fruits of the Resurrection was coming from that land because that's where job said I know my redeemer Li and at the last days he will stand upon the Earth and those skin worms destroy in this body yet in my flesh I God imagine at the first of the Bible job already have a revelation of the body change is that right that I'm going to die but at the same time yet in my flesh I'm not going to be coming have some Spirit In My Flesh I'm going to see God praise the Lord he had a revelation from Genesis right on down to Revelation so is it today friends many people hold on to things of the world or hold on to same great system but all bury me in Christ amen for if those that are in Christ only those that are in Christ will God bring with him in the resurrection praise be to God hallelujah amen yes sir very important oh praise God now we know that the bride will be made up uh the bride will be made up many of Gentiles because it's a gentile bride am and you know in the book of Acts he said that he will call out people from among the Gentiles for his name not all the Gentiles but from among the Gentiles is that right he said I'll take one I'll leave one I'll take one I'll leave one do a bed I'll take one I leave one do feel I take one I leave one amen praise the Lord but he'll take out from among the Gentiles of people that he would Mar amen for his name give them this name so I'll take them out I'll choose them by the choosing of a bride praise the Lord you'll see the character in them and the character is not something we put on but the very seed that he himself placed on there will have the same character as himself for the word can only marry to the word if he is the word she has to be the word because God didn't take a separate part of dir to make Eve but she took a part of Adam and made Eve is that right now he's taking a part of Christ the word to make us hallelujah the new creation amen amen praise the Lord so we are a part of him now being revealed he was revealed back there but you being revealed now veiling of the Mighty God Hallelujah the Mighty God being unveiled not just before us in the form of brother BR but the mighty mighty God Demon veil in US and true us you are the veil that veils him you are the skin Veil that veils him not the badger skin and skin and all these other skins but you are the veil that fails him today praise the Lord so we bail him we reveal him is that right he be hide him and yet we reveal him praise God you are a part of that mystery amen praise the Lord that's now ongoing praise God hallelujah amen so there it is brothers and sisters we see it here bury me in Christ amen now David was born in Bethlehem I forgot to carry on that thought we know that also of course that when they took Jesus and they went and crucified him they crucified him on the same Hill also where Abraham was going to kill Isaac and so on the whole thing just kept going right on down and they were doing it by inspiration because remember they didn't have Telegraph and internet to know what this other one did so many 100 years ago or whatever inspiration amen praise the Lord you know they kind of felt I don't know if they had all of them had a clar revelation but they felt that this ground here when the Messiah comes again Resurrection is going to start at this place and I want to be sure I'm going to be there amen praise the name of the Lord that resur starts glory to God of course that's a type of being buried in the world because the resurrection will be take place with the word Prophet said if there is no seed word in that heart there uh there is nothing to be reborn there's nothing to be reborn there has to be a seed in there to be reborn praise the Lord for a person to be saying I'm born again again amen there would have to have had a seed in there before to be born again glory to God hallelujah and then how are they going to deceive you and tell you they're born again but they're not seeing the word of the Y they're not recognizing the word when it's the word that sees the word and the Deep calls to the deep and the Deep will responden because the two are like the jigsaw apostle that the prophet spoke about they are made like hand and glove to feat each other right and when a True Believer hears the truth that thing fits your soul until sometimes youing know I I used to think that or I used to believe that I never heard it like that before but I already I had this feeling in me that that's right amen praise God why because you are a part of the word but it's now being revealed amen praise God this is your time this is your season and God is making himself to know know amen of course David was born in Bethlehem amen and he was the one that anointed was anointed also when Samuel came to him he was anointed also in ble him amen and praise the Lord and now you see I just showed you where a lot of them died and how they all got buried in the same place now I'm taking you the other way David was born in Bethlehem David was anointed in Bethlehem and David his greater son the Lord Jesus Christ The Royal seed comes and where where else is he going to be born yes be bor in Bethlehem for the word comes to the predestinated vessel Hallelujah it has to come to that vessel or place that God already had prepared amen you were prepared don't you understand that you're living beem today amen you are the place that with all a stinking straw and manure where the king of glory came down to come and live in our hearts a God that's rich in Mercy that come and dwell in us we we weren't better than anybody that stable wasn't better better than any other stable it had animals and had mess and had straw it had swaddling bands of clothing which the swaddling clothes is a sweat they put a cloth around the the neck of the animal and rest a yoke on it so that it wouldn't Scar the neck of the animal because the cloth would soak up the the salt from the sweat uh perspiration on the animal and not give it what they call G which is to say that it start to get red and bloody and everything else so that that's what the Clock Was and when he was born that's all Mary could find they was so poor she didn't have nobody knitting booties and fixing up everything else she did just grabb a a cloth that was filled with the animal and just wrapped him in that hallelujah amen when God come down in his AG all he could find is US and he took us as sinful as we were and wrapped him in that amen amen praise the Lord you understand what he did for us understand what he did for us amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah you would think that baby will catch disease or that sickness or whatever else like that I think it was the reverse he Sanctified that clot he made that clot if they could find that today they would have that up in the Catholic church as a holy shroud or something my God I tell you because he's the one that transforms everything around him amen praise the Lord glory to God when he touches the light he changes touch Elijah he was so anointed that years after he was buried he still had the holy ghost in his bone amen you tell me that when you have the Holy Ghost now and even if they bury you the Holy Ghost is going to be your B to th years later whenever the Rapture comes the Holy Ghost will be there and he'll raise you up the grace of God you can have this assurance amen amen oh what a blessed thought to know that we've lost our fear of death for death is The Last Enemy and when you overcome the fear of death you are an overcome you already overcome praise the Lord hallelujah I'm not saying that you going to rush to your death but uh you know we have no real fear of death that our lives are going to end it's your natural life is going to end not the real you the life that is in there and God can give you another body and he will a glorified body praise the Lord hallelujah how wonderful to know that we are born again free from sin happy night and day want to make me shout there is no doubt I know that I've been born again praise the name of the Lord hallelujah oh think of it poor people Joseph and Mary real poor but how humble God makes himself God humbles himself and take the things that are not that he might bring to pass his great promises amen think about it how Jehovah laying in a Manger wrapped in the cloth taken from the Yoke off the neck of an ox they wrapped the Prince of Peace in it who are we then what do we deserve if God can humble himself like that ought we not to be able to Humble ourselves to become his servants and to serve him amen would that be the truth simple but that's powerful if God can do that for us we can do that for him praise the Lord hallelujah no matter how poor you are how little or insignificant you might be God can use you only if you let him is that right God doesn't Force anybody to do anything noely but he will use you if you let him amen no matter what condition or state you are in there is something lacking somewhere amen we try to twist it this way we pollut it just like the Nations have done Christmas all polluted that's right but if we could just get back get the tinel of off all these things and get the humility back in the human heart Bring humility back to Christmas that's the way it ought to be not commercial not light not most Santa Clauses but back to worshiping the God of all creation Jehovah God Amen praise the Lord get all the shiny things out of the churches get all this fancy stuff they're trying to put on all kinds of attractions on religion is that right that's what they're doing you know the attraction towards religion is not all these shows and programs and all these things that they're doing let me tell you in the book of ask what was the attraction that they needed the holy GH just came down and that was the attraction is that right one man that was going to that inational church for 40 years H Peter and John said take up your bed and walk and the man left them walk on the crow start to together 3,000 were saved in the one day that's thect is that right they didn't need a big advertisement bu they didn't need public relations you know that the churches have uh uh administrator they got people trained in marketing and religious public uh publicity and all this stuff they have people train religiously to do all these things amen what we need is not those things even though they are helpful we need the Holy Ghost back in the church again we need the churches to Humble themselves under the the mighty hand of God we need to see the word born in the church again the word manifesting itself in the church again the prophet of God puts it this far he said if a church does not
