TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] with joy i come before you it's wonderful to be here in the house of the lord with you the saints of god believers in christ and with people everywhere may the lord richly bless you last week we were able to witness the conjunction of the two stars in the heavens and of course we recognize that symbol not to be three stars as it was at the birth of jesus christ the headship or the head of the body but now two stars joined together an invisible union the head coming to the body i and my father are one thank god and so now we see that wonderful holy conjunction being showed are displayed in the heavens while god is doing it upon the earth and we thank him for it but now that is that phenomenon is over and here we are this sunday looking to the lord for help from above from manna from heaven and we want to we would remind you that we spoke some time ago on the twins of the end time revival twins of the end time revival i'm going to pray as we read the word of god and then we'll go into our message for today the place where god put his name now let us read out of the word of god deuteronomy chapter 16 verses 2 and we will read to verse 6. thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith even the bread of affliction for thou camest forth out of the land of egypt in haste that thou mayest remember the day when thou comest forth out of the land of egypt all the days of thy life and there shall be no unleavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days neither shall there anything of the flesh which thou sacrifices the first day of evening remain all night until the morning thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates which the lord thy god giveth thee but at the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place his name in there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at evening at the going down of the sun at the season that thou camest forth out of egypt praise the name of the lord let us pray our gracious god and our heavenly father we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for the display in the heavens for the manifestation here upon the earth and be a praise and magnify you that we are able to recognize it oh and to give you glory for what you are doing in this day so you be all the praise the honor and the glory for we ask it in the name of our lord jesus christ god bless you my friends as i've said before i spoke on the topic of twins of this end time revival and in doing so we talked about the twins that came out of eve cain and abel one being the son of adam and cain of course being called by in first john the son of that wicked one and we traced them or the spirit that anointed them we traced that through the entire bible by showing how it came right down through and went into the evil ones while the spirit went to noah then on to esau and jacob it moved on again right through moses and those that came against him and his message we followed it all the way until we saw those twins rear their heads again judas and jesus christ justice cain and abel were in the same womb from the same womb even so jesus and judas were in the same church now of course we see clearly that the spirit of judas walked with the spirit of jesus christ for his entire earthly ministry walking with him everywhere but we know that that same spirit also left and came into the church ages and we clearly understand that as the ravening wolves that paul spoke about he was there but they were there then later we seen the rise of the nickelodeons and the true servants of the living god so this is a a battle that has been going on from heaven to earth and true time right on and this battle will not really end until we're back in eternity again in the presence of the living god judas of course walked with the lord jesus for his entire ministry until his death which he helped to engineer and he thought that this ending of jesus or what appeared to be the ending of jesus was the end of the ministry and the end of it all but we know it was not the end in souls imprisoned now the same spirits here today living in the same kind of people condemn people that can never be saved because they were condemned before like judas iscariot he was born son of perdition you said judas sure remember judas was religious jew just was a like a church boy he went and heard every sermon that jesus preached and still it didn't help him at all yes sir very religious but you see he couldn't go all the way with jesus message and even so we find even in our day many can't go all the way with the message of the hour you see he couldn't he couldn't take part of jesus message he could take the healings the miracles the wonderful things but when jesus began to say i and my father are one when he begin to say before abraham was i am then that stuck in judas's throat he he could not accept that we could not take it in it was just too much for him couldn't stomach it and so is it in our day many following this message take healing they can take speaking in towns they can take signs and wonders they can take miracles and things like that but when it starts getting into the area of god speaking through man and speaking squirrels into existence that's too hard for them to believe and they can't walk in into that whatsoever because it starts getting too deep for them and they don't want to hear that their heart their thirst their hunger is still for the miracles the signs and the wonders but that was judas in the bible and that's the same spirit of judas here again today because you see judas's spirit can live all the way right up to that spot where the word goes into a a a different dimension and then he can't follow it he can't go after it anymore oh may god help us today my friends let me say this that you can walk in the seven church ages but after those ages have come to an end you believe you followed this message and the message seems in the eyes of many to have come to an end and so they can walk away from it because it seems to have ended the prophet is dead he's gone and there's lots of questions surrounding that and i don't know and and uh that drift away because my friends that's the up to that spot is where their spirit can go and after that they can't see anything anymore let me say my friends if god doesn't call you how are you going to come how are you going to repent if we have relatives and children who are not borned again how how can they be saved how can they be transformed by god's presence and power if god doesn't move within their hearts what are you going to do with them my lots of uh people in this message and in christianity as a whole have made a terrible and awesome awful mistake because they've tried to uh i use my own colloquial term lasso them and wrestle with them with the bible and and you know just shackle them to the church and in the house and then brand them with the name of our denomination baptize them do something to hold them like that baptize them into that denominational franchise or message franchise whatever you want to call it we do our very best to get those ones that we love to get them in in our way of getting them in oh praise god hallelujah amen but friends you must recognize that this work or that work is entirely in the hands of god for salvation is of the lord and salvation is only by election it's god's election and what are you going to do about it how can you change it you can't do it by prayer you can't do it by crying by fasting by offerings by indulgences by giving or something like that god already chose his elected bride from before the foundation of the world and we cannot change god's choice at all we can pray we can intercede we can beg we can isolate those people uh in and surround them with everything that we believe they would love and they would like and we could even take them and place them into our socially protected cocoon we can provide them with a uh you know our own protective incubator and place them in there and place them in that atmosphere of our love oh my and keep them we are keeping them from sin we are keeping them from the world we are keeping them from all of these various things but you see friends with that pattern the moment they are released or they get out of there all the sin diseases the sin viruses all of the sins of the world begin to come upon them and they are more likely to contract those sin diseases of the soul and take them in and god help them in that hour for without god's election without god's germ of god's attribute in them they are long gone may god help us my friends today we are talking about the place where god chose to put his name and here we see friends that if his name if their names are not on the lamb's book of life you just pray and labor and work your sweat yourself to death and if they're not in god's election it won't make any difference they have to be in god's election and then you don't have to push up pull uh you know persuade and and all those things you the word itself will do the work for salvation is of the lord my friends let us not take those kinds of substitutes our own efforts church efforts man's efforts for the work of god for the election of god for the choosing and the ordination of god let us not take any substitutes we must have the genuine token we must have the genuine gene of god within us of course a token is a small piece of something or a small piece if i say a token of god a small piece of god or a small part of god's life within us amen to really be able to have a reverse for and non-seed cannot have a rebirth only one who has already in them a token of the life of god can experience a genuine rebirth or as we say you must be born again amen hallelujah don't rely on the fact that you might have spoken in towns whether in the past or in the present don't you rest your faith in the fact that in every meeting you go you feel goosebumps all over your body don't rest your laurels on the fact that you might have felt the fire of god going down the back of your spine oh my don't take the fact that you have gifts in your life [Music] and you have the faith the anointing to operate those gifts and to pray for people and see miraculous wonderful healings and people excited and running the floors and praising god because they're healed under your ministry and they receive healings signs and wonders and genuine miracles happening around you because of that ministry that god has placed within your life oh my don't take anything like that as an evidence that you have the token it's clearly said in the future whom to receive the holy ghost to have the evidence of the holy ghost is to have a clear understanding of the word of god and then go out and live it wow when does he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth and show you things to come oh praise god forevermore hallelujah oh my friend if you have one tickle of doubt one little moving affair within your heart get desperate and say lord god today i want to know whether i have that token within my life it oh father for years for even though i'm reading the bible i'm going to church and following the message but i feel as if there's something missing in my life there's a link there's an ingredient that i just can't grasp onto for something is missing somewhere help me lord help me lord jesus i know i must have this token lord in me oh praise god hallelujah amen my friends remember what i said judas could live right up to that spot where he thought the life of jesus had ended completely many believe that this message has come to an end and so their fate begins to drift they begin to wonder about they begin to doubt fears doubts begin to come in they start looking for human teachers everywhere oh instead of looking to god looking for help from heaven looking for heavenly sunshine to shine upon them from above instead of doing that my friends they're caught up with every substitute and every false gate that would lead to god and they are led astray and completely out of the will of god amen amen hallelujah my friends this spirit of judas could live right up to the end of the seventh church age could live right up to the second pole and even partly go to the third but not all the way oh that spirit is a copycat spirit it's a counterfeit a religious deceiver or religious actor in this message in the christianity but particularly in this message for we are coming to the end all things are beginning to wind up for the rapture to take place and so everything is becoming magnified under the bride's discerning eye as she looks into the word of god oh my impersonators they are everywhere now scattered around traveling moving all around within the the message of this hour the true bride is not deceived anymore by denominationalism or by denominations she is not carried away by their dogmas doctrines creeds and litanies she is not carried away by their programs or their precepts for she is founded upon the word of god and so we look for the deceit and the deceiver right within the message of this hour where there are impersonators lot of actors but without the token life of god in you my friend my friend that jew the spirit will anoint you and will have the power to deceive and lead you away but take god the true believer keeps looking away to jesus christ the revealed word of the hour notice the invisible union of the bride page 55 some of you people believe this to be the truth do you believe this to be the truth i believe it with all my heart to be the truth of god's word we are entering another age we are entering the rapture age you know the church can't go in this condition friends did you hear that we are entering into another age not being in the seventh church age spiritually physically you might be confined to the seventh church age but spiritually you're entering into another age and that age is called the rapture age in the stature of a perfect man he calls it oh i'm looking for that man or that woman oh who after the seven see seven ages have ended well enter into that eternal church age that comes at the end of the seals may god help you you can re look that up yourself my friends but here we are of course we know an eternal church age is going right back into the very mind and heart of god and back where we come from spiritually while we are yet here on the earth for we shall be changed in the moment in the treatment of an eye by the power of the word of god working within our hearts and within our lives amen hallelujah listen we are entering the rapture rage the church can't go in his present condition can you send amen amen the church cannot go in its present condition and it can't get any better either for it's rejected and rejecting the word of god so it's going to wax worse and worse and worse but there's something else moving right now lord of god hallelujah i said something else is moving right now listen he's speaking in the invisible union of the bride here saying yes the move is on but the move is on for the bride the move is on for the bride that's the truth that's thus saith the lord hallelujah i want to say here the move is on that move is on my lord the move is on hallelujah the move is on my lord the move is on i can hear the rustling in the mulberry trees and i know i know i know the move is on the move is on this is not petty cost this is none of the other ages this is the fullness of the word this is the word making itself flesh again this is the transforming power of god god and morphe in himself the revelation of the son of man being revealed again as was promised by the word of god by jesus himself as it was in the days of lot so it wasn't the days of sodom so shall it be in the day when the son of man is being revealed being revealed how not in the form of the head jesus christ but he is now being revealed in his bright form are in the form of a bride a people called out to take his name oh blessed be the name of the lord that blessed wonderful place where god has promised he would place his name amen oh praise god forevermore the move is on my friends it's moving everywhere thank god the fire is moving there it's moving there it's moving over there it's moving everywhere the fire of god is everywhere and lighting up her pathway as the pillar of fire did to israel now the light of god lighting our minds our hearts hallelujah as we sing open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart lord show your word to me reveal to me lead me oh god like you did the prophets of old you spoke to them you revealed yourself to them from abel right on down to paul and to all the other apostles and you are the same god and you are able to do it and you are doing it now for your glory and honor today we give all the praise and the honor for you are the same yesterday today and forever all believers believe it receive it and may the holy spirit activate it within your heart and life for god's glory and for god's honor now we find in the seven seals speaking page 263 and where did eve fall from she fell from the word oh my how is he going to get back by the word see people go into them systems and the system runs them away from the word instead of to the word but only the word will bring them back now notice after so long a time the word is coming back to you to eve how did she fall how did he fall where did she fall from she fell from the word and god said to her he would make a way to redeem her back to the word again after a long time the word would become known to her again oh blessed be his holy name the word would become known to her all right the word then would come for one purpose now oh my the word would come to her for one purpose and that was for the purpose of redemption just jesus came he the word and he came then for the purpose of redemption and now in these last days the opening of the seven seals the revelation of the word to the true believer has come and it's come to us for what reason what purpose has come for your redemption to buy you back and bring you back into the presence of god into the mind of god into the life of god hallelujah so that he could live in you walking you talk in you and live his own life through you which is genuine christianity or christ in you glory be to god hallelujah amen amen oh praise god hallelujah listen the word come for one purpose for redemption until that time she had substitutes and substitutes would only work until the time arrived for the original word amen now he told her the word would come to her again but until that time comes he gave her a substitute until the original word arrives on the scene he gave her an offering that she could make a substitute for the blood until the real lamb's blood came now the blood was of bulls and sheep and goats and things but that did not take away her sins it only covered her sins it didn't take it away it only covered it for it was animal's blood and the animal's blood in the animal's blood was animal life it was a substitute until the reel came along hallelujah praise god so before the lamb could take his bride to be ever by his side he the lamb the word must first redeem her amen hallelujah thank god all through the other church ages they could not uh experience full redemption they only had partial faith partial faith partial redemption but now when the perfect fullness of the word has come we can now friends have total deliverance we can now my friends have perfect redemption to purchase my blood amen and be brought into the very uh presence of the living god hallelujah amen so the other church had just fell from grace i will not touch on that now but that fell from grace uh somewhere along the line but this uh end time genuine little flock oh praise god she can't fall she won't fall because uh she has a anchor she has in her typos she has herself anchored in jesus she'll she'll go over every storm and every wave every trial every temptation and every trouble amen hallelujah amen praise god they took part of the word but this end time bride takes all of the word within our heart and so not until this age could she come and experience perfect redemption hallelujah oh praise god he said how will it redeem her it will come to her so that she will know the word again hallelujah and i believe right now there are some people that the word is revealing itself to and they're annoying the word of god again oh thank god forevermore oh hallelujah glory to his name god is making himself known in this hour he's doing something big and i believe i'm a part of it oh blessed be his name hallelujah the word has come the word has come for your redemption the word is revealing itself to you now so that you can be born again oh praise god impersonators are still here they're in the message they're none other than our opposite twin oh the message of the seventh church age messenger has certainly produced twins and out of this message revival we can plainly see it and we can clearly say twins have come out of this last day message revival but here is the thing friends these impersonators no matter how religious how godly they appear or or seem or are they are satisfied with the substitutes but the elect are only satisfied by the opening of the word the word being revealed to them hallelujah oh glory to god justice jehovah gave his people in israel a natural paschal lamb until the real lamb word of god came along to save them so we see that god has sent his word and that word was crucified and have a rising of the sun and has come back to its spirit form revealing and making itself known to his beloved elected and so we find now a trashing time a sifting time approving of his word time is here upon us my friends when some are accepting the substitute that they already have and god gave that substitute god gave that first that second poll god gave that substitute god gave it right up there friends and you can't say god didn't give it but it was only for a season now you just take the thought and follow that little further i'll stop i'll move on with what i have to say but to the spiritual mind take it and throw along with it yes you see so they accepted those substitutes and such people all they can see is a prophet but the true elect look past the veil they look and all they can see is jesus christ revealing himself revealing his word and making himself known to his people through the manifestation of revelation 10 7 malachi 4 5 amen the mighty angel of revelation 10 1 coming down and going to revelation 10 7 to fulfill amen the book of luke 17 amen 30 praise god the revealing of the son of man the opening of the word the manifestation of our day our time and of our hour amen yes sir the blood of bulls and god served their purpose they were substitutes until the real blood or life of the lamb of god came along and was shed on calvary for us amen but when the blood of jesus the lamb of god the real lamb was shed our jewish brethren and their rabbis even to this day have been so wrapped up in the substitutes that god himself gave them that they are blinded to the truth and to the revelation that jesus christ was that lamb that passed the lamb that died to take away their sins our sins not cover our sins but take them away block them out carry them away praise god in the sea of god's forgetfulness hallelujah amen and so israel and their rabbis have focused on their substitutes and denied and rejected the redemptive coming of the word of the lamb they rejected the coming of the word not realizing it and even saw today in our day and in our hour i'm speaking about spiritual israel now he's talking about those who were called out by the message in an exodus entered into the wilderness that would herein cries being proven and tried by the word of god and so we find even so today many people being called out in a similar way have their own ideas of what the bible and the message is saying to them you see they don't understand or have not received that opening of their heart that opening of the soul amen to recognize that god gave substitutes it was god who gave the rhema god gave the written word that we can all read it we can all compare we can all study late hours of the night early hours of the morning we can fast and pray over the rima we can be able to um you know hear a little dare a little uh we can place it in various ways oh my friends but you see that was only a substitute to bring you to christ that was only a substitute to bring you to him who is the supernatural being the presence of the great mighty illuminating pillar of fire that was with israel is now with us and we we are privileged and blessed to walk with him to be led by him by his spirit and walk wherever he says to walk amen praise god but friends the rhema is one thing we can become doctors ability maestro's message doctors of divinity and great teachers of the message in the reamer in the courts in the message my friends but i'm talking about being able to enter into the logos or have the logos itself reveal itself to you and to know him in the power of his reappearance the power of his resurrection the power of his divine reality and his presence in our hearts and lives now if we were to go to the book of deuteronomy back to chapter 16 god is speaking in his word and there thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates which the lord thy god giveth thee verse 5 16 5 deuteronomy 16 5 and 6. he says look i know i gave you those gates but now the time is over for that don't you go sacrificing anymore within those gates which i the lord thy god gave you but the place this is where you must worship this is where you should sacrifice but the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place his name in there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at evening at the going down of the sun evening time oh my god hallelujah it's evening time again oh end up the season that thou camest fort out of egypt blessed be the name of our god oh hallelujah praise god forevermore what a place to be in brother and to recognize where you're at this is the evening time do you believe it i believe it this is the evening time amen and god for a season permitted us to offer sacrifices at gates which he provided and permitted and allowed us to worship him and to praise him and to serve him in because he permitted those gates like the blood and the of the bulls and goats were permitted but only for a season until the reality came until the perfect lamb came and so we find we were allowed to worship at lutheran gates we were permitted to worship at presbyterian baptist catholic uh whatever gates god received it at that time because it he allowed it he permitted it at that time but we are now in another age and god our god has moved on and is marching on for his glory and honor and the move is on within the bride of jesus christ hallelujah listen speaking not in any of these gates thou may not sacrifice the passover within any of these gates which the lord thy god giveth thee now remember not in any of these gates lord permitted it but now he doesn't want the worship in any of these gates but the place which the lord shall choose to place his name only at that gate that's the only place amen that we should worship him the place or the gate in which he place his name o glory to god not in in any of those gates but the certain gate that god has provided for his people oh as i wind this down now my friends i tell you the only place god will receive your worship or your sacrifice is the gate where he plays his name which gate is that then which gate is it the bible tells us he placed his name in christ amen and the gate is christ for jesus himself said i am the way amen no man cometh to the father but by me why he is the gate he is the way past thee the angels with the flaming swords he is the way back to spiritual supernatural eat then in the eden and god oh my hallelujah amen the revealed word of the hour he has placed his name there in the midst of all these substitutes we're able to discern discern all these substitute gates we can discern them and put them aside if you haven't put your gate aside that you've lived in been and brought up in worship in and it's time for you to put that gate aside and realize there's only one way to god and jesus christ himself is the way he is the gate to god himself glory to god hallelujah so in the midst of all these we can brush them aside and place our hands on hold to god's unchanging hand of his revealed word but watch the other twins what does our other twin do they hold on to what they have and go along with their substitutes even if it's a message substitute they their interpretations of what they think the bible is saying their interpretations are thoughts of what they think their word is saying the message is saying of what the prophet said as so-called and many message teachers are giving their various interpretations of what they think the message is saying amen but remember jesus said i am the way hallelujah oh my but his name is not in just the written word my friends his name is now in the gate of the revealed word of the hour god making himself known by an act of grace to reveal himself to an individual in whom leia gene seed germ of god and attribute from before the foundation of the world that's now coming into the manifestation of the children of god sons and daughters of the living of god and we have crossed over the gap into the capstone for this day and we have done it my friends we have done it by the gateway of god through the opening of the word of god hallelujah oh my this is the gateway into glory this is the gateway into the glorious presence and the glorious liberty of the children of the living god the countdown is on now my friends and thank god our only way out of here out of this mess unto this madness that we have here and this chaos the only way out is to get into christ get into the capstone get into the the great capsule that you might be able to be taken out of here and not treat them tonight by the changing of the grace power of the word of god and by the grace of god hallelujah i'm glad that i'm i believe i'm walking in christ i believe i'm living in that capsule and i'm looking out of its windows i'm looking at the world going by i'm looking at the rest of believers who are might be up there i come in contact with them some i may not know but i recognize in them lays that eternal seed they are particle of the being of god themselves and thus they carry with them the potentials of eternal life oh may god bless you may god bless every one of us as we come to this we are in this marvelous time may the christ of bethlehem be born in you today god bless you my friends to god be the glory we'll meet again god bless you and i'll be with you here to preach the word of god as we come to the end of this year and may the holy spirit pour out himself upon us god bless you there'll be other announcements coming forth that'll come true our website and come true uh uh our uh our communicator who will do that through text and various other means may the lord bless you you
