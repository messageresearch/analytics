[17:16] amen praise God that's what the Lord
[17:19] wants amen praise our God forever more
[17:22] so tonight we're just going to continue
[17:24] along um where we started on Sunday that
[17:26] was just uh sort of laying in a
[17:28] foundation
[17:30] and um we were looking at uh at rolling
[17:34] away the
[17:36] stone and um how the
[17:39] resurrection is a key element for us to
[17:42] recognize you know we were looking at
[17:44] recognizing our role in the plan of
[17:46] God's redemption in this hour amen
[17:49] calling the Sons and Daughters of God to
[17:51] the message of the hour to the
[17:53] revelation of what God is doing in our
[17:56] day amen praise God but you know um as
[18:00] human beings we run into all kinds of
[18:03] situations and our faith gets tested and
[18:06] we looked at Martha we looked at Mary we
[18:08] saw the differences we saw how um you
[18:12] know Martha was kind of a representation
[18:14] of of works and the law and then how
[18:18] Mary was a representation of Grace amen
[18:21] knowing that uh the the master had
[18:24] called amen and that um you know there's
[18:27] nothing greater for us to recognize in
[18:30] this day and in this hour that the
[18:31] master has called us it's it's it's it's
[18:36] a miracle Saints it's a paradox when you
[18:39] think about it because you know
[18:41] Christianity is not something it's it's
[18:44] uh you know it started when Christ rose
[18:46] from the dead 2,000 years ago amen and
[18:50] um and we've got thousands and thousands
[18:53] probably hundreds of thousands of
[18:55] churches worldwide that are that are
[18:57] worshiping Jesus Christ Christ but yet
[19:00] there's there there must be an
[19:03] understanding that that God is an
[19:05] absolute and that God cannot be the
[19:08] author of
[19:09] confusion that um he's in the present
[19:12] stage of his ministry and it's important
[19:15] for us to recognize his present stage
[19:18] and what he's doing in this hour okay
[19:21] we're not saying we're better than
[19:22] anybody we're not making any kind of
[19:24] claims we're only claiming the word of
[19:27] God and what the word of God says says
[19:29] amen and so I believe that um you know
[19:33] as we look at um at the word
[19:35] tonight we're going to look and see how
[19:38] you know um rolling away the stone is
[19:40] not just rolling away the stone that
[19:42] Jesus came and spoke and told them to
[19:45] roll away the stone there back then
[19:47] 2,000 years ago but there's stones that
[19:50] need to be rolled away
[19:51] today amen and that's what we're going
[19:53] to be looking at tonight some of the
[19:55] things that God is going to be um
[19:58] showing us
[19:59] in the word of God tonight let's um
[20:01] let's read our scripture before we do
[20:02] that we'll we'll pray father what an
[20:05] honor and what a privilege once again to
[20:07] be here in your presence Lord tonight is
[20:10] Wednesday night bible study so we we get
[20:13] to search the scriptures in a way Lord
[20:15] and your spirit just comes um in the way
[20:19] that you would have the preeminence to
[20:21] speak to the needs to the hearts of your
[20:23] children here that are gathered in this
[20:26] place and Lord that are gathered in in
[20:29] um
[20:30] YouTube and listening in live as we
[20:34] Minister your word father you there's no
[20:36] distance in um in your spirit so I know
[20:39] that you can speak to every single
[20:42] individual Lord that has um uh chosen to
[20:46] be here tonight Grant it father take
[20:49] control and just bless us tonight Lord
[20:53] we need you more than ever father I'm
[20:55] just a human being we're all just human
[20:57] beings that are that are saved by grace
[21:01] and Lord we're just asking for your your
[21:03] mercy to come and and uh humble us with
[21:06] your presence oh God we pray in Jesus
[21:08] name amen praise
[21:11] God St John 11: 39-41 Jesus
[21:16] say take ye away the stone Martha the
[21:21] sister of him that was dead saith unto
[21:23] him Lord by this time he stinketh for he
[21:27] had been dead for days Jesus saith unto
[21:30] her said I not unto thee that if thou
[21:33] wouldest believe thou should see the
[21:36] glory of God then they took away the
[21:39] Stone from the place where the dead was
[21:43] laid praise God you may be
[21:47] seated amen glory to God let's read the
[21:50] next scripture um 1 Thessalonians CH 4:1
[21:55] 16 says for the Lord himself shall
[21:59] descend from heaven with a shout with
[22:02] the voice of the Archangel and with the
[22:05] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[22:07] shall rise first then we which are alive
[22:11] and remain shall be caught up together
[22:14] with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
[22:18] in the air and so shall we ever be with
[22:22] the Lord wherefore Comfort one another
[22:26] with these words amen praise praise God
[22:29] you know that's a wonderful scripture
[22:31] but I want I I want you to recognize and
[22:34] draw your attention to that scripture
[22:36] here tonight that we just read in that
[22:39] it types us
[22:41] today we are on our walk to the
[22:45] resurrection we're walking with God the
[22:48] Bible says for the Lord himself shall
[22:51] descend from heaven with a shout you
[22:53] know the Lord descended 2,000 years ago
[22:57] amen and he came with a message praise
[23:00] God and he was the voice of God in that
[23:04] particular day he was God's voice in
[23:08] Jesus Christ representing the word made
[23:10] flesh coming to those that were that
[23:13] were waiting on him but yet only a dozen
[23:16] actually really recognized who had
[23:18] actually been in the midst that it was
[23:21] Jehovah God himself the word being made
[23:24] flesh amen and then we which are alive
[23:29] and here we are today and there were
[23:31] then you know it was Mary it was Martha
[23:33] it was Lazarus it was the disciples back
[23:35] then they were alive and they recognized
[23:38] that Jesus Christ had come on the scene
[23:41] that here he was amen listen to The
[23:44] Prophet the first thing comes when he
[23:47] starts descending from from the heaven
[23:50] there's a shout what is it it's a
[23:52] message now we know that God sent us a
[23:55] prophet in this day and in this hour and
[23:58] he had a message that would turn the
[24:01] hearts of the children back to the faith
[24:03] of the fathers what is that it turned us
[24:07] back to the word it turned us back to
[24:10] where we would read the word recognize
[24:13] the word receive the word allow it to
[24:18] possess us take control of us and then
[24:20] manifest through Us in this day and in
[24:24] this hour amen what was it it is a
[24:27] message to get the people together
[24:30] praise God Amen a message comes forth
[24:33] first now lamp trimming time rise and
[24:37] trim your
[24:38] lamps what watch what what's that the
[24:42] seventh not the sixth the seventh behold
[24:45] the bridegroom cometh rise and trim your
[24:48] lamps and they did some of them found
[24:52] they didn't even have any oil in their
[24:55] lamp see but it's lamp trimming time
[24:58] and so we received a message in our day
[25:01] that has turned us back to the word of
[25:04] God that's the difference between all
[25:07] the other churches that are that are out
[25:10] there claiming Christianity and the True
[25:13] Church of God Amen that they've
[25:16] recognized what God is doing in their
[25:18] day and that God said that he was going
[25:21] to send a
[25:23] prophet in the Fulfillment of Malachi
[25:26] 4:5 in the Fulfillment of of Revelations
[25:29] 10 1-7 to turn the hearts of the
[25:32] children back to the faith of the
[25:35] original fathers back to the word of God
[25:38] now listen he goes on brother Brandon
[25:39] and this is from the Rapture message the
[25:42] second is a voice of the
[25:45] Resurrection the same voice that a loud
[25:49] voice in St John 11
[25:53] 38-44 that called Lazarus from the grave
[25:58] amen and this is what we were talking
[26:00] about on Sunday that unless you come to
[26:03] recognize the
[26:06] resurrection that the voice of the
[26:08] Resurrection is now present you will
[26:11] stay in your unbelief you'll stay in
[26:15] that cave and the stone will stay rolled
[26:19] in front of your
[26:21] grave because the denominations out
[26:24] there and all the teachings of man the
[26:27] teachings of man is not what gives you
[26:29] Faith it's not the doctrines of man
[26:32] that's going to give you rapturing faith
[26:35] in order to fulfill that that we shall
[26:37] be caught up together with them in the
[26:39] clouds to meet the Lord you're going to
[26:42] need a supernatural faith in order to
[26:45] fulfill that scripture amen and so you
[26:48] need to come out of the graves you need
[26:51] to be woken out of out of your your your
[26:54] sins we're going to look more into this
[26:57] here so he says here that called Lazarus
[27:00] from the from the grave getting the
[27:02] bride together and then the resurrection
[27:05] of the Dead see to be caught up with it
[27:09] now watch the three things takes place
[27:12] the next is what was a trumpet a voice a
[27:16] shout a voice a trumpet now the third
[27:20] thing is a trumpet which always at the
[27:22] Feast of trumpets is calling the people
[27:25] to the feast that'll be the bride supper
[27:29] the Lamb's supper with the bride in the
[27:32] sky Hallelujah see the first thing comes
[27:36] forth is his message calling the bride
[27:38] together the next thing is a
[27:41] resurrection okay so you you heard the
[27:44] word you know hey don't you know that
[27:46] God sent a prophet oh no I I didn't know
[27:49] that God sent a prophet well you need to
[27:51] look into it you need to look into why
[27:54] God sends his prophets God does nothing
[27:57] less he reveals it first unto his
[28:00] servants the prophets that's what makes
[28:02] God the same yesterday today and forever
[28:06] he will never change and so oh so God
[28:09] sent a prophet yes you need to look into
[28:12] the word of God you need to look into
[28:14] see what he said we know what Luther
[28:17] said when he went to the Catholic church
[28:19] and he says hey wait a minute here I
[28:21] don't need to be going to an intercessor
[28:23] I don't need a man interceding for me or
[28:26] or Mary interceding for me I need my own
[28:30] Revelation and experience and
[28:33] relationship with Jesus Christ that's
[28:35] what Luther recognized and so Luther
[28:38] broke away from the church and it
[28:40] started the Reformation everybody knows
[28:43] about the Reformation you can talk to
[28:45] anybody uh any of the Christian churches
[28:47] they all know about it well the
[28:49] Reformation has to continue to the point
[28:52] where the Rapture is
[28:54] fulfilled and now you know there's a
[28:57] progression in the word of God that we
[28:59] need to recognize and in order for us to
[29:02] get to the destination we need to know
[29:04] where we're at praise God Amen and so
[29:07] the church he's saying here now um it's
[29:11] it's so the next thing is a resurrection
[29:13] of the sleeping bride okay we which are
[29:17] alive and remain shall not hinder them
[29:19] that sleep those that received Jesus
[29:23] Christ in their age you can go back and
[29:26] look at the history okay you can start
[29:29] right 2,000 years ago and you'll see
[29:32] what took place through the Dark Ages
[29:34] the church the you know the the Roman
[29:37] Catholic Church took control of the word
[29:39] of God and there was millions of
[29:42] Christians that were
[29:45] slaughtered they were slaughtered
[29:47] because they wanted to have a personal
[29:49] relationship they had a personal
[29:51] relationship with God God was restoring
[29:55] his word and the only way he restores it
[29:57] is is he gets into
[30:00] individuals and when he gets into
[30:02] individuals their lives start to reflect
[30:04] Christ but when when any at any time
[30:08] when when the Life of Christ was being
[30:10] reflected in the people the enemy didn't
[30:13] like it Satan listen if you believe that
[30:15] there's a God then you need to
[30:17] understand that the scripture says very
[30:18] clearly that there's a devil he's our
[30:21] adversary he's the one that's going to
[30:23] try to stop us from believing the word
[30:25] of God Amen so we need to realize that
[30:29] we have to fight if we're going to Reign
[30:32] we need to overcome the enemy the
[30:35] bombardment of all the traditions of man
[30:38] and so we don't need any intercessor we
[30:42] need to have a personal relationship
[30:44] with Jesus Christ amen praise God so the
[30:47] next thing that's going to happen is the
[30:49] sleeping Saints are going to
[30:51] rise and then we are going to be caught
[30:54] up together with them for a meeting in
[30:56] the air which is called the Rapture and
[30:59] we'll meet with the Lord and this world
[31:02] is going to go into Great
[31:04] Tribulation I'm just going to tell you
[31:07] what the scripture says you want to
[31:08] argue don't argue with me you're going
[31:10] to have to argue with the scripture amen
[31:13] praise God and the trumpet the feast in
[31:16] the heavens in the sky why that's the
[31:19] thing that takes place friends we're
[31:21] right there ready now the only thing the
[31:25] church coming out has got to lay before
[31:29] the sun to ripen right now this is
[31:32] what's taking place we're at the end
[31:34] time Jesus talked about the Harvest at
[31:37] the end time it's the ripening of the
[31:39] grain it's where the true Sons and
[31:42] Daughters of God will come under the
[31:44] leadership of the word for this day and
[31:47] for this hour and they will allow the
[31:49] Holy Spirit to do in them whatever is
[31:52] necessary to prepare them for the
[31:56] Rapture amen amen praise God you want to
[31:59] know more about the Rapture you can find
[32:02] out Lots about the Rapture just go and
[32:05] Google search or listen to YouTube and
[32:07] and pick up messages go back and listen
[32:10] to the message of William Mariam brandom
[32:13] on the Rapture you will learn a lot
[32:16] about what the Rapture represents and
[32:18] how it's going to be fulfilled in this
[32:20] day and in this hour amen praise God so
[32:25] we need to recognize you can put up the
[32:27] next
[32:30] slide we need to
[32:33] recognize
[32:36] that go to slide number
[32:42] six so it's recognizing and
[32:45] acting upon the resurrection that's
[32:47] taken place in our personal lives amen
[32:50] praise God I'm just going to read here
[32:53] from um uh uh go to the next slide St
[32:56] John chapter 14
[32:59] 14:12 it
[33:01] says verily verily I say unto you he
[33:05] that believeth on me the works that I do
[33:08] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[33:12] these shall he do because I go unto my
[33:15] father now why do I read this scripture
[33:18] because we need to understand that the
[33:21] resurrection took place Jesus went back
[33:24] to his position as Supreme author
[33:27] Authority and now he has come down and
[33:30] broken himself up into individuals in
[33:34] this day and in this hour and these
[33:37] individuals represent the body of Jesus
[33:40] Christ praise God and you've been you've
[33:43] been given a portion of the word of God
[33:46] it's been placed in you as the attribute
[33:49] of God and and so how can you possibly
[33:52] do Greater Works than what Jesus did
[33:56] well the same way that if you go back
[33:57] back and study the works that were done
[33:59] through William Mariam Branham through
[34:02] the 1940s 50s and 60s you will see that
[34:06] there was so much Supernatural there was
[34:08] dead raised doctors affidavits FBI
[34:12] reports we're not talking about just
[34:15] hearsay sure you can search the
[34:18] scriptures and search uh or not search
[34:20] the scriptures but search the internet
[34:22] and find oh well they'll say well
[34:24] William brandham was was uh you know a
[34:28] you know they'll they of
[34:30] course when Jesus Christ was here on the
[34:33] earth they said be
[34:36] alub they called him the head of the
[34:39] Devils imagine the word was made flesh
[34:43] was doing Miracles right before all the
[34:46] Pharisees the Sadducees right there in
[34:48] front of their faces but yet they said
[34:50] be
[34:51] elub they called our Lord a devil so how
[34:56] much more now when he does these Works
[35:00] in our day that the people are going to
[35:02] try and place it and say that's the
[35:05] devil that's a cult that's something
[35:08] that you you got to stay away from no
[35:11] what I tell people is
[35:13] listen you need to search the scriptures
[35:16] you need to look for yourself into the
[35:18] word of God to see what the word says
[35:22] and then you make your own decision
[35:26] don't listen to to what other people's
[35:28] interpretation is because the enemy The
[35:32] Devil is still alive and
[35:35] well and he will do everything in his
[35:39] power to turn you and others against the
[35:43] word of God for this day and in this
[35:45] hour and so we need to recognize that
[35:48] there's only one way that we could
[35:51] possibly do Greater Works and that's if
[35:53] his Spirit dwells in you well how do I I
[35:57] get his Spirit you need to repent you
[36:00] need to be baptized into the name of the
[36:03] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[36:05] your sins you shall receive the gift of
[36:08] the Holy Spirit which is Christ now it's
[36:12] not as simple as I just said it the
[36:16] statement is simple but in order for you
[36:19] to receive Christ you had to be with him
[36:22] before the foundations of the
[36:26] world you need to have had
[36:29] representation in you before you came
[36:32] here Jesus said all that the father hath
[36:37] look at the word hath it's
[36:40] past past tense your name was written in
[36:44] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[36:47] foundations of the world so in order for
[36:50] you to respond when your name is being
[36:53] called well how's my name being called
[36:55] when you can recognize the word that's
[36:58] being revealed in your
[37:01] day that's how you recognize that your
[37:04] name is being called people say well how
[37:06] come you believe this message because my
[37:08] name was called not Dan missil not not
[37:12] uh uh Michelle Brennan not Michael
[37:16] Peltier but because I had the ability to
[37:19] recognize wait a minute this makes sense
[37:22] let me check the scriptures baptism I
[37:25] see it as clear as a bell I don't I
[37:27] don't see any other mediator between man
[37:29] and God but Jesus Christ so if I got to
[37:32] take the Bible says right there
[37:34] clearly in word or deed do it all in the
[37:38] name of the Lord Jesus
[37:39] Christ so a deed is when you go to
[37:42] baptism and you're baptized and immersed
[37:46] fully in the water it's your your old
[37:49] life being completely buried so that you
[37:52] can receive a new
[37:54] life and all that does it doesn't save
[37:58] you but it shows that something took
[38:01] place within you and has led you to
[38:04] represent Christ now to the world in
[38:06] your personal
[38:08] life amen you know these are simple
[38:11] truths but unless these simple
[38:14] foundations are not in you there's no
[38:17] way that you can progress and move on to
[38:20] the Fulfillment of the Rapture of the
[38:22] church amen let's go to the next
[38:26] scripture
[38:28] First
[38:30] Corinthians now if if
[38:33] Christ be
[38:36] preached that he rose from the dead how
[38:39] say some among you that there is no
[38:41] resurrection of the Dead you know
[38:44] there's there's there's people like
[38:46] there's people that just don't believe
[38:47] that Jesus Christ rose from the dead
[38:49] that's
[38:51] right you know but if there is no
[38:54] resurrection of the dead then is Christ
[38:57] not RIS
[38:59] risen in other words people are saying
[39:01] that you know Christ is not risen I want
[39:03] to read this from the Amplified version
[39:07] and it'll help you you know understand
[39:09] the point that I'm trying to bring out
[39:11] here because it's important for you know
[39:13] we know that the resurrection is a
[39:16] reality but there are people out there
[39:19] that that reality has not struck them
[39:21] yet they need to know that the reality
[39:24] of Jesus Christ and the power of his
[39:26] resurrection is what changes your life
[39:29] it's what opens your understanding it's
[39:32] what gives you the ability to recognize
[39:34] the word for your day but now if Christ
[39:38] the Messiah is preached as raised from
[39:41] the dead how is it that some of you say
[39:44] that there is no resurrection of the
[39:46] Dead question mark But if there is no
[39:50] resurrection of the dead then Christ has
[39:52] not risen then it's then we're sitting
[39:55] here in vain we haven't received a new
[39:59] birth we haven't we haven't received
[40:02] Christ amen and if Christ is not risen
[40:06] then our preaching is in vain it amounts
[40:09] to nothing and your faith is devoid of
[40:12] Truth and is fruitless without effect
[40:16] empty imaginary and
[40:20] unfounded this is what the enemy is
[40:24] trying to tell you trying to tell the
[40:26] people
[40:28] there is only one way that anybody will
[40:31] be saved and that is through Jesus
[40:33] Christ and through the power of his
[40:36] resurrection unless you accept Jesus
[40:39] Christ as your savior in the power of
[40:44] his resurrection there is no
[40:46] salvation
[40:48] period we are even discovered to be
[40:52] misrepresenting God for we testified of
[40:55] him that he raised Christ
[40:57] whom he did not raise in case if it is
[41:01] true that he that the dead are not
[41:06] raised they're arguing that that you
[41:09] know like that Christ is not raised this
[41:11] is from the book of Corinthians and
[41:13] there was there was a lot of dispute
[41:15] that was going on amongst them and there
[41:17] was those people the Sadducees that did
[41:19] not believe in the
[41:21] Resurrection the Pharisees believed in
[41:23] the resurrection but they couldn't
[41:24] recognize the word just like a lot of
[41:27] the Christian churches out here today
[41:29] they believe in the resurrection but
[41:31] then when the word is put right there in
[41:33] front of them in the present stage of
[41:35] his ministry Christ right now possessing
[41:39] the hearts and the lives of individuals
[41:41] and all that those individuals you me
[41:44] all we can ever do is go right back to
[41:46] the word we'll tell them well how are
[41:49] you baptized have you received the Holy
[41:51] Ghost since you
[41:53] believed oh well no I don't know if I
[41:56] receiv received the Holy Holy Ghost
[41:58] that's the that's the answer that I get
[41:59] from a lot of people I go you know I
[42:02] understand you believe Christ but have
[42:04] you received the Holy Ghost which is the
[42:08] resurrection of Jesus Christ in your
[42:12] life here we are coming into the Easter
[42:15] celebration and that's why the Lord led
[42:17] me to this you might think oh it's so
[42:19] simple we've heard this before no
[42:22] there's some that have never heard this
[42:23] before they've never caught the
[42:26] revelation of the
[42:27] Resurrection because if you catch the
[42:30] revelation of the Resurrection it'll
[42:32] draw you right to the message of this
[42:35] hour it'll allow you to see what Christ
[42:37] is doing it'll it'll it'll make you run
[42:41] from man's teachings man's doctrines
[42:44] man's interpretation on the word telling
[42:47] you that you need to say 10 hell Marys
[42:49] you need to do a 100 our fathers you
[42:51] need to you need to repent and and and
[42:53] and and and do Works in order to be
[42:56] saved there is no Works in
[42:59] salvation Salvation is by the grace of
[43:02] God Amen it only comes through God's
[43:04] grace it comes because God knew you
[43:07] before the foundations of the world and
[43:09] he knew that when he would come to you
[43:12] personally like he did to me 30 years
[43:14] ago when when I was in a condition where
[43:17] I had no idea how I was going to get out
[43:20] of the condition that I was in just like
[43:23] blind barus when Jesus was on the earth
[43:25] just like the woman that had the blood
[43:27] issued just like the woman at the well
[43:30] they had no idea how they were going to
[43:32] get out of their condition but then when
[43:35] he came and he said I am he to that
[43:38] woman at the well let me tell you her
[43:41] life changed when he came and he said to
[43:44] me I am he my life changed amen
[43:47] hallelujah when he came to you and you
[43:49] knew that that that you actually met the
[43:52] Living God your life had to
[43:55] change you could never you can never be
[43:58] the same
[43:59] amen and so here let's just continue
[44:02] reading here um from verse
[44:07] 19 he says here
[44:11] nevertheless no sorry let's let's
[44:13] continue then here from verse 15 yes
[44:17] then what am I to do I will pray with my
[44:21] spirit by the holy spirit that is within
[44:24] me but I will also pray intelligently
[44:29] with my mind and understanding God
[44:33] doesn't want you to be a
[44:35] robot God wants you to be
[44:37] sincere God wants your heart that's
[44:41] where God deals with individuals he
[44:43] wants your heart I will sing with my
[44:46] spirit by the holy spirit that is within
[44:48] me but I will sing intelligently with my
[44:52] mind and understanding also your
[44:55] conscious mind
[44:58] and the revelation of God's word comes
[45:01] together from time to time it's called
[45:03] divine
[45:05] revelation and when it happens it brings
[45:09] stimulation amen it brings you into a h
[45:12] it brings you out of your spiritual
[45:14] Amnesia and all of a sudden the word
[45:16] makes sense all of a sudden what you're
[45:18] reading comes to life what is that it's
[45:22] the stimulation of the spirit amen
[45:25] praise God and so he says here otherwise
[45:28] if you bless and render thanks with your
[45:31] spirit thoroughly aroused by the Holy
[45:35] Spirit how can anyone in the position of
[45:38] an outsider or he who is not gifted with
[45:42] interpreting of unknown tongues say the
[45:47] amen to your Thanksgiving since he does
[45:50] not know what you are
[45:52] saying Amen to be sure you may give
[45:56] thanks well nobly but the bystander is
[45:59] not edified it does it does him no good
[46:03] but I thank God that I speak in strange
[46:06] tongues more than any of you oh I'm on
[46:09] the wrong scripture I'm so
[46:13] sorry it flipped over on
[46:16] me but it still pertained
[46:19] there because we're talking about the
[46:21] spirit and having an understanding of
[46:24] the spirit and even when and even when
[46:26] when the Holy Spirit speaks in tongues
[46:29] there's an interpretation but it's only
[46:31] supernaturally revealed amen it's all by
[46:35] The Same Spirit praise God so let me go
[46:38] to verse
[46:40] um 17 but if Christ from from chapter 15
[46:45] but if Christ has not been raised your
[46:47] faith is mere delusion futile fruitless
[46:50] and you are still in your sins under the
[46:52] control and penalty of sin and further
[46:56] those who have died in spiritual
[46:58] fellowship and Union with Christ have
[47:02] perished have are lost if you who are
[47:06] abiding in Christ have hope only in this
[47:09] life and this is all then we are all
[47:12] people most miserable and to be pied if
[47:17] our Salvation is not based on the
[47:20] resurrection of Jesus Christ in our
[47:22] personal lives and that he has
[47:25] Resurrected then our worship is all in
[47:29] vain our coming to church is in vain
[47:33] there's no good in US assembling
[47:35] ourselves without knowing that the
[47:38] resurrected Christ has taken control but
[47:41] the fact is that Christ the Messiah has
[47:44] been raised from the dead and he became
[47:47] the first fruits of those who have
[47:49] fallen asleep in death it's because
[47:52] Christ raised from the dead that we can
[47:54] stand here tonight and rejoice and know
[47:57] that we are the sons and daughters of
[47:59] God because he lives in us he says on
[48:03] that day you shall know that I am in the
[48:04] father ye in me and I in you amen praise
[48:09] God glory to God for since it was
[48:13] through a man that death came into the
[48:15] world it is also through a man that the
[48:18] resurrection of the dead has come amen
[48:22] for just as because of their Union of
[48:26] nature in Adam all people die so also by
[48:31] the virtue of their Union of nature
[48:34] shall all in Christ be made alive that's
[48:38] why Jesus said you must be born again
[48:44] you must receive my spirit if my spirit
[48:48] dwells in you the works that I do you
[48:52] shall do why because he's dwelling in
[48:56] you you it's all about the resurrection
[49:00] in you praise God let's read on
[49:03] here let's go to the
[49:07] next let's go right to uh number 10 and
[49:10] you hath he quickened who were dead in
[49:13] trespass and in sins so we've been
[49:16] quickened how are we quickened by the
[49:19] word that we received in our day you
[49:22] could never have have been quickened
[49:25] unless you receive the word in this day
[49:29] you couldn't listen if Moses message was
[49:32] to come out right now and say we're
[49:35] going to go and we're going to cross the
[49:36] Red Sea that's not the message that's
[49:39] going to Quicken you you wouldn't you
[49:41] wouldn't be drawn to it remember there's
[49:43] a supernatural element that God placed
[49:46] in you from before the foundations of
[49:48] the world he placed you in
[49:51] 2024 for a purpose those that were
[49:54] placed in the 1300s they were there for
[49:56] a purpose they had to go through the
[49:58] Dark Ages those that were there in
[50:00] Luther's day in the 15 the 1600s they
[50:03] were placed in that age they received
[50:06] the word for their day and they
[50:08] manifested the word in their day amen
[50:12] praise God but they had to be quickened
[50:15] they had to be birthed in that
[50:17] particular season just like you there's
[50:20] no other message that would Quicken you
[50:23] or any of the last few
[50:27] remember not everybody's G to receive
[50:29] this
[50:30] message this message is for the bride
[50:34] it's for the Church of the last days all
[50:38] the churches that's why the scripture
[50:40] that we read at the beginning the dead
[50:41] in Christ those were all the previous
[50:44] ages those were the ones a lot of them
[50:46] they called them Heretics but they were
[50:49] the real
[50:50] Christians they burned Jon of Ark to to
[50:53] a stake because she was spiritual and
[50:55] she had re Revelation from God and then
[50:58] they realized years later that they had
[51:01] actually burned a saint and they wanted
[51:03] to to to you know dig up the bones of
[51:06] the priest that that had done it at the
[51:07] time and you know to show punishment and
[51:10] to show repentance they're always
[51:13] rejecting God's word in the day that he
[51:16] comes he's the same yesterday today and
[51:19] forever they rejected Jesus Christ back
[51:22] then they're going to reject him today
[51:26] he's Jesus himself said if they hate you
[51:28] it's because they hated me
[51:30] first they hate and and who is he he is
[51:33] the word you go to somebody you show
[51:36] them acts 238 baptism in the name of the
[51:39] Lord Jesus Christ there was nobody ever
[51:42] baptized any other way in the scriptures
[51:45] I challenge any minister or any
[51:47] Christian teacher out there to show me
[51:50] scripturally where anybody was ever
[51:53] baptized into the titles of the father
[51:56] son and Holy Ghost when Jesus said go ye
[51:59] out into into and and be my disciples
[52:02] teaching them baptizing them in the
[52:05] name listen Peter was right there when
[52:09] Jesus was resurrected and stood there he
[52:11] said all power has been given unto me in
[52:15] heaven and on Earth and they want to say
[52:17] there's three gods they want to say
[52:19] there's a Trinity there's no such thing
[52:22] as a Trinity there's no scripture for
[52:24] Trinity Jesus said said all power he
[52:27] didn't say some power he said all in
[52:30] heaven and on Earth well is there any
[52:33] other
[52:34] power there's no other power there was
[52:38] one that was sitting on the throne it
[52:41] was
[52:42] Christ but he went back to his fullness
[52:45] again and then when he resurrected and
[52:47] he stood in front of the of the Apostles
[52:50] and the disciples and he said go ye into
[52:52] all nations baptizing them in the name
[52:57] of the father and of the son and of the
[53:00] Holy Ghost the name was Jesus
[53:04] Christ why did Peter on the day of
[53:07] Pentecost go back and read it acts
[53:09] 238 when they asked him what must we do
[53:12] to be
[53:13] saved did he say repent and be baptized
[53:17] in the name of the father and of the son
[53:19] and of no in the name of Jesus in the
[53:22] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[53:25] remission of of your unbelief because
[53:28] you believing a trinity you're stuck in
[53:31] unbelief you can never be born again by
[53:35] believing something that is not truth
[53:38] Jesus himself said the truth shall set
[53:41] you free not a lie I don't care how
[53:45] sincere you might
[53:47] be if you're sincere about God you'll
[53:50] honor his word you'll go back there and
[53:52] you'll say wait a minute I was wrong
[53:54] just like I did 30 years a ago and I
[53:56] realized being baptized as a baby I was
[53:59] not
[54:01] baptized I had no understanding and so
[54:04] when Jesus said repent be baptized in
[54:07] the name of the F the name of the Father
[54:10] the Son and the Holy Ghost there's no
[54:11] other name whereby man must be saved was
[54:14] Jesus
[54:15] Christ Jesus Christ was the name given
[54:18] to the son which was a body for the Holy
[54:24] Ghost the Father the Almighty Elohim to
[54:28] dwell in the word was made flesh it came
[54:33] into the body so that it could go to the
[54:35] cross and take your place and when he
[54:38] gave up the ghost he gave it up so that
[54:40] it could come back on you but he would
[54:42] only give it back to his own he can't
[54:45] give his spirit it's just like a father
[54:48] a father can only birth his own children
[54:53] they will have his blood you try to give
[54:56] you know an individual the wrong blood
[54:59] they're going to die yes amen and the
[55:02] same blood that was in Jesus Christ
[55:04] which a blood is only a type of the holy
[55:07] spirit is what dwells in
[55:11] you
[55:12] amen and so when they
[55:15] repented and they listened to what Peter
[55:18] said they received the Holy Ghost the
[55:21] Bible said 3,000 on that day when Peter
[55:25] told them what what they must do to be
[55:27] saved to repent be baptized in the name
[55:29] of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[55:30] remission of their sins they received
[55:32] the Holy Ghost amen praise God and so
[55:36] God cannot go against his word he's got
[55:39] to stay with the word amen praise God
[55:43] it's just as simple as that Allelujah so
[55:47] let's go on here we're going to read
[55:49] we're going to read a quote here from
[55:52] brother
[55:53] brandham have I have not I sent thee
[55:57] and as we're reading we're going to just
[55:58] draw from it what we've been saying here
[56:01] tonight amen we're going to be done in
[56:03] about 15 minutes so Martha when she come
[56:06] up she fell down at his feet and she

[56:16] was you know you this is this is so
[56:19] important we need to recognize the word
[56:22] for our day amen that's what he was if
[56:25] you'd have being here my brother would
[56:28] not have died see he said but but even
[56:31] now whatever you ask God God will do it
[56:36] she knew that he was the
[56:38] Messiah she knew that he was the
[56:40] representation he was the Fulfillment of
[56:43] a child shall be given his name shall be

[57:07] the Rapture that you're going to be
[57:09] saved from a world that's falling apart

[57:52] whether you you did come or you didn't
[57:55] come whatever you ask God God will do it
[57:59] to you he said thy brother shall rise
[58:03] again he he was telling her he realized
[58:06] that that that she had
[58:08] recognized and he was now in the present
[58:11] stage of his ministry he was the
[58:14] resurrection and the life he said thy
[58:16] brother shall rise again she said y Lord
[58:19] he will rise in the last days he will
[58:22] rise he's a good man he will he will
[58:24] rise in the general Resurrection
[58:26] Resurrection but Jesus turned around and
[58:27] said I am the resurrection and eternal
[58:33] life you don't have to wait until the
[58:37] end time you can receive Christ right
[58:40] now you can receive the benefits of
[58:44] transformation and change in your

[58:59] he can take you out of your lying your
[59:01] cheating your stealing he can remove you
[59:03] from all of those things so that you can
[59:06] feel that you've got a future and that
[59:08] your future is
[59:10] clear amen praise God he's a good man
[59:14] nobody could say that but him he's the
[59:17] only one that could say I am the
[59:18] resurrection though he were dead yet
[59:20] shall he live nobody could say that but
[59:23] him he that he liveth and believeth in
[59:25] me me shall never die believest thou
[59:28] this she said yay Lord I believe that
[59:32] you are the Son of God that was to come
[59:35] into the world there you are what is it
[59:38] she's acting she's moving into acting on
[59:44] her faith and in order for you I don't
[59:47] care who you are if you've not come to
[59:50] that place where you've recognized Jesus
[59:54] Christ is the only way way true in the
[59:56] life and you're not going to the Waters
[59:58] of baptism you're not acting on the
[1:00:03] word you're stuck in your tradition
[1:00:06] you're stuck in your in in in what your
[1:00:09] your your your priest told you or what
[1:00:12] you've been taught by your mom or by
[1:00:14] your dad or by the books that you read
[1:00:17] you're stuck in those traditions of man
[1:00:21] until you come to the place where you
[1:00:23] recognize that your birth certificate
[1:00:26] Bears record that Jesus Christ died and
[1:00:29] Rose
[1:00:31] 20,24 years
[1:00:33] ago until you come to that place what
[1:00:37] whatever religion you might be caught up
[1:00:39] in you need to search the scriptures and
[1:00:42] you need to come to a place where you
[1:00:44] experience the
[1:00:46] resurrection Hallelujah she wants to see
[1:00:49] a miracle so she's finding out what the
[1:00:51] word
[1:00:53] says that's what everybody needs to do
[1:00:56] you want a miracle in your life I
[1:00:58] remember when I was at that point in my
[1:01:00] life I was coming to the church I was
[1:01:02] coming to the services I was hearing the
[1:01:04] word of God but I knew that I was still
[1:01:07] addicted to the drugs I knew that it
[1:01:09] still had such a strong hold on me but I
[1:01:12] said this this preacher is talking about
[1:01:16] miracles constantly and I need a miracle
[1:01:20] and then I came to realize the only way
[1:01:22] that I could experience a miracle is to
[1:01:25] know that he was a reality and that he
[1:01:28] could do what he said he would do and I
[1:01:30] took him at his
[1:01:32] word I challenged him I went up to the
[1:01:35] Altar and I said I need I I went right
[1:01:38] to Pastor Simon I said I want the Holy
[1:01:39] Ghost because I knew that the Holy Ghost
[1:01:42] was the power of God was Christ himself
[1:01:46] he was the strong one he could be the
[1:01:48] one that could kick out this addiction
[1:01:50] and and change my life and turn it
[1:01:52] around so that I wouldn't have to be in
[1:01:54] constant shame because that's how I was
[1:01:58] living so here he says it's standing
[1:02:00] there in the form of the Son of God I
[1:02:03] believe the word it's standing there in
[1:02:05] the form of the Son of God his words is
[1:02:08] not his not me that speaketh but the
[1:02:12] father that dwelleth in me whatever
[1:02:15] comes from them little lips of yours
[1:02:17] that speaks I'll believe it's the
[1:02:20] commission of God oh my my there you you
[1:02:24] are the Messiah
[1:02:26] what is Messiah the anointed one you are
[1:02:29] God's anointed one God had an anointed
[1:02:32] one in a lesser measure one day and His
[1:02:35] Name Was Elijah and there Elisha and the
[1:02:39] woman had a baby that died and she went
[1:02:42] up to this servant of God and she said
[1:02:45] thou man of God she recognized him she
[1:02:49] and and that the anointed one of God
[1:02:52] come and walked through the floor laid
[1:02:55] his body upon this little dead baby and
[1:02:58] it sneezed seven times and come to life
[1:03:02] and if God did that for his anointed
[1:03:04] Prophet how much more will he do by
[1:03:07] Emmanuel by God
[1:03:10] himself see Mary these are thoughts that
[1:03:13] brother brandham was bringing out here
[1:03:16] that you know she she was she was in
[1:03:18] that moment she came to realize wait a
[1:03:20] minute here he is the resurrection he's
[1:03:22] here right now he can whatever he says
[1:03:25] can take place whatever God says he can
[1:03:28] do in your life amen if you if you can
[1:03:31] believe that it's possible Jesus Christ
[1:03:33] said all things are possible to them
[1:03:36] that believe go to the next slide as we
[1:03:39] continue and she said I believe that you
[1:03:42] are the Son of God if you ever get
[1:03:45] anything from God you've got to believe
[1:03:47] God's servant God's word
[1:03:50] see you know that those that carry the
[1:03:53] word in this hour those that are
[1:03:55] ministering ing in this position those
[1:03:58] like you that are out there working that
[1:04:00] are carriers of the word you are God's
[1:04:03] representation and you are carriers of
[1:04:06] the word and you're the mercy seat for
[1:04:08] somebody people can find Mercy just by
[1:04:12] getting to know you because the spirit
[1:04:15] that's in you can be trans it can be
[1:04:18] sent from you just by speaking the word
[1:04:21] and if there's an attribute of God if
[1:04:23] there's representation in that
[1:04:25] individual just like it was in me just
[1:04:28] like it was in you that's why you find
[1:04:29] yourself here it has to respond to the
[1:04:33] word you don't have to coax you don't
[1:04:35] have to try to convince somebody you
[1:04:38] don't have to you force your children to
[1:04:40] come into the house of the Lord we can't
[1:04:42] force our children to come and serve God
[1:04:45] that's foolishness we train them up in
[1:04:49] the way of the Lord yes when they were
[1:04:51] younger we raised them here we brought
[1:04:53] them into the house of the Lord but then
[1:04:55] they become adults they become capable
[1:04:58] of making their own
[1:05:00] decisions and every individual must make
[1:05:02] their own decision you're not to be
[1:05:05] ashamed if your children are not serving
[1:05:08] the lord you're to continue to pray for
[1:05:11] them and believe that God can do for
[1:05:13] them what he did for you because God is
[1:05:16] Not uh you know uh he doesn't have
[1:05:18] grandchildren let's put it that way he's
[1:05:21] got Sons and Daughters of God Amen
[1:05:24] praise God and
[1:05:26] so if you ever get anything from God
[1:05:30] you've got to believe God's servant
[1:05:32] God's word see and he was the word I
[1:05:36] believe just tell me what to do where
[1:05:39] have you laid him down he went to the
[1:05:42] Grave weeping like a man you got to
[1:05:45] remember when Christ was in that human
[1:05:47] body he was human but yet he was God he
[1:05:51] was human when he was weeping but he was
[1:05:54] God when he cried with a loud voice
[1:05:56] Lazarus come forth that had to be God to
[1:06:00] speak and call Lazarus from the grave
[1:06:03] where have you laid him down he went to
[1:06:05] that grave weeping like a man when he
[1:06:07] got there what did he say now do when
[1:06:11] what did he say now do when you get
[1:06:13] there see you got something to do too
[1:06:18] listen to what he saying here you got
[1:06:21] see you got something to do too you know
[1:06:23] said take ye away the
[1:06:26] stone if you want to see a miracle you
[1:06:30] sick people tonight if you want to see a
[1:06:32] miracle take away the
[1:06:34] stone take away that stone that sin that
[1:06:38] lays at the door that's why I got this
[1:06:40] whole thought about rolling away the
[1:06:42] stone you know here we are we're
[1:06:44] entering into the Easter season but
[1:06:46] people need to recognize that the
[1:06:48] rolling away of the stone was not
[1:06:50] something that happened 2,000 years ago
[1:06:53] it's something that needs to happen in
[1:06:55] individual lives if they're going to
[1:06:57] come to recognize that Jesus Christ is a
[1:07:00] reality and that they can be saved amen
[1:07:03] praise God they need to roll away some
[1:07:05] Stones what is it say brother brandham I
[1:07:08] don't do nothing but if you don't
[1:07:11] believe it it can't
[1:07:13] happen it's to them that believe Jesus
[1:07:16] said all things are possible to them
[1:07:20] that
[1:07:22] Bel
[1:07:24] Hallelujah but if you don't believe it
[1:07:26] it can't happen take away that stone of
[1:07:31] unbelief and watch what
[1:07:34] happens just take away the stone and
[1:07:37] when she obeyed the word of the Lord she
[1:07:41] saw a
[1:07:43] miracle
[1:07:45] sure we're going to end it right there
[1:07:48] and when we come back next time we're
[1:07:51] going to look at how we have some stones
[1:07:56] to roll away in our lives let the
[1:07:58] musicians come praise God I trust that
[1:08:02] that somehow you can you can recognize
[1:08:05] as we're entering into the Easter
[1:08:08] season that the power of the
[1:08:10] resurrection and the importance of
[1:08:12] recognizing that he is now present he
[1:08:15] wants to change your life he wants to
[1:08:17] draw you out of that denominational
[1:08:20] thinking he wants to pull you away from
[1:08:24] from the traditions of man he wants you
[1:08:27] to know him personally and he wants to
[1:08:30] come into your life and he wants to roll
[1:08:32] away stones in your life that are
[1:08:34] hindering you from serving him to the
[1:08:37] fullness to the capacity that he wants
[1:08:39] you to to to to serve him many of you
[1:08:42] have come into this ministry this is
[1:08:46] not just an ordinary
[1:08:49] Ministry this is a Supernatural Ministry
[1:08:53] not because of Pastor Danny or former
[1:08:56] Pastor John Simon or the other ministers
[1:08:59] that are preaching here but because we
[1:09:02] are under the leadership of Jesus Christ
[1:09:06] he's the king he's the high priest he's
[1:09:09] our Lord he's the one that controls and
[1:09:12] leads and directs this church he is our
[1:09:15] leader and our guide sure we have
[1:09:17] offices we have positions God has a
[1:09:20] provided way of leading guiding and
[1:09:23] directing his church and we're going to
[1:09:25] be looking at things here when we come
[1:09:27] back next time we're going to be looking
[1:09:29] how how how Christ is the mystical body
[1:09:33] that we are a part of and when we when
[1:09:36] we can think that we can just be off on
[1:09:38] our own and that we don't need Christ
[1:09:41] which is the
[1:09:44] body you deteriorate real
[1:09:47] fast and you cannot progress with God
[1:09:50] your walk
[1:09:51] stops but God wants us to come out of
[1:09:55] that
[1:09:56] the only way that we're going to be
[1:09:58] changed in this day and in this hour if
[1:10:00] is if the word progresses in our lives
[1:10:03] and takes away all
[1:10:05] self puts all of our Humanity our
[1:10:10] carnality all of our own mental thinking
[1:10:13] as human beings unless we move that
[1:10:16] aside and we allow the mind of Christ to
[1:10:18] take control will never be fully changed
[1:10:21] remember you heard the prophet when I
[1:10:24] read the quote at the beginning all
[1:10:26] that's left to do is she needs to sit in
[1:10:28] the presence of the Sun and ripen and
[1:10:32] how you going to be in the presence of
[1:10:33] the son you're going to be coming under
[1:10:36] the leadership of the word for this hour
[1:10:38] you're going to come under a Ministry
[1:10:40] you're going to come under a pastor
[1:10:42] you're going to recognize that there's
[1:10:44] that there's a provided way where God is
[1:10:46] feeding his sheep he told them feed my
[1:10:49] Lambs feed my sheep that's why you're
[1:10:52] going to hear I'm not going to be coming
[1:10:54] here with deep messages on the opening
[1:10:56] of the word and the Seven seal and all
[1:10:58] those things those things will be
[1:11:00] revealed to individuals as the Lord
[1:11:03] wants to reveal it in their time and in
[1:11:06] their season as they feed on the word of
[1:11:09] God remember the spirit of truth will
[1:11:11] guide you into all
[1:11:14] truth it's the holy ghost that feeds you
[1:11:18] and gives you what you need when you
[1:11:21] come here under expectation no matter
[1:11:24] how simple the word might appear or how
[1:11:26] simple and how you've heard the
[1:11:28] scriptures over and over and over again
[1:11:31] when the mighty Angel comes and stands
[1:11:33] behind the the the speaker and and
[1:11:36] allows his Spirit to start ministering
[1:11:38] to individual needs in the midst you
[1:11:41] might not recognize it and the reason
[1:11:43] you won't recognize it is because you're
[1:11:45] coming with a carnal
[1:11:46] mind thinking that you need man to feed
[1:11:49] you that's denominational
[1:11:52] teaching that's not what we come under
[1:11:54] here
[1:11:55] when we come into the house of the Lord
[1:11:57] we come under the supernatural presence
[1:12:00] of the Living God where he takes the
[1:12:02] preeminence and he starts to speak to
[1:12:04] individuals he starts to correct
[1:12:06] individuals he starts to deliver
[1:12:09] individuals he starts to open their
[1:12:11] understanding so that they can progress
[1:12:13] with him instead of sit
[1:12:16] idle in their own mental
[1:12:21] perception does that make
[1:12:24] sense it's what the spirit of God wants
[1:12:27] to do in this hour it's not about
[1:12:30] joining a church we're not a church full
[1:12:33] of thousands of
[1:12:35] people but we're a church that have
[1:12:38] people with the spirit of God that the
[1:12:41] amen can respond back to the amen and
[1:12:44] say Amen to the word of God and not be
[1:12:47] ashamed because oh I'm going to be I'm
[1:12:49] going to be I'm I'm going to feel
[1:12:50] ashamed by going to that church because
[1:12:53] they don't have any High influential
[1:12:54] people going to that church like they do
[1:12:56] down here at
[1:12:59] Harvest God's not looking for high
[1:13:01] influentials you show me in the
[1:13:02] scriptures where he did
[1:13:05] that he rebuked all those individuals
[1:13:08] when he came to the
[1:13:10] Earth he said I come for those that are
[1:13:13] sick all the high influentials they they
[1:13:16] rejected him and they called him be elab
[1:13:19] they'll do the same thing
[1:13:22] today praise God that's why we're
[1:13:27] here that's why we come under this
[1:13:30] revelation of this word that's what
[1:13:33] excites my soul that's why I want to
[1:13:35] come into the house of the Lord on
[1:13:37] Wednesdays and Friday night prayer
[1:13:39] meetings and Sundays because I want to
[1:13:41] meet with the Living God I need
[1:13:43] Deliverance in my life we need
[1:13:45] Deliverance in our lives we're never
[1:13:47] going to be fully delivered until we're
[1:13:50] changed you think you're going to not
[1:13:52] have problems after you leave this place
[1:13:55] sure I'm talking about all the wonderful
[1:13:56] things about God and his word and how he
[1:13:59] delivers and he's he's your deliverer he

[1:14:04] he can take you out of your alcoholism
[1:14:06] he can pull you out of your drug
[1:14:07] addiction but then you need to overcome
[1:14:10] as an
[1:14:11] individual you still need to overcome
[1:14:14] the shame the reproach oh I go to that
[1:14:17] church yeah search the scripture and if

[1:14:22] down on your knees and you trust God and
[1:14:24] you pray to God you don't look to man
[1:14:26] you don't look to what somebody you
[1:14:28] trust God you will have the same
[1:14:30] experience that every son and daughter
[1:14:32] of God has and they can be zealous and
