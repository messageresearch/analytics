TRANSCRIPT
========================================
part of the materials they used was was HZ us to help so we have to dig out the As and we have to get this out of the forde and whatever else and yet we're saying we're we're boasting that we're better and everything that they built we are not going back totir because it's still standing amen that's right so signs of the times are everywhere amen when we look around us we see the signs of the things are everywhere and I believe that uh people are not worried about these signs of the times the only time when they get worried is when there is a a worldwide disaster then their minds turn to God their minds turn to judgment I don't care which human being it is and how they say oh I don't believe in God but when exhaust traes the first person they call I thought you don't believe in God but it's human heart they're built that way to believe in God the fool has said in his heart there is no God you just have to ask where did you come from my mother where did your mother come from and then we keep going back there a chicken in the egg story go right back but you got to you either have to have somebody made that chicken or made that egg because it just can't be like that they have to some super being that did that and whatever you want to call him that's what we call God Amen praise God and more than that he became flesh and we know him as Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen so we know that it's when there's critical points in history that people turn to God you know 911 they said the Bibles in the bookstores were sold out there wasn't a Bible that you could find we were almost godly people now we all people the churches were jammed couldn't find Space people were calling on God and talking about Revival and everything else and judgment and everything else after that once they see everything calm down they run you know the one Prophet said like a dog to his b they go right back you know go right back to the FI of the world and the things of the world right like that oh Mar but we know that we living in a day of turmoil song says trouble sometimes are here filling man's hearts with fear Freedom we all hold there now is that St we living in trouble sometimes second D he says perilous times shall come your selfishness will abound where uh some people got 100 billion and and they don't care you know oh more for me me me me me and one more more more and past the guy Starving in the street and say why doesn't he find a job why does he pick up himself from his bootstrap like I did never mind my father loed me a million dollars to get started so we have to understand the perilous times you live in amen and it's so bad now that people are going insane like the prophet said they will go and save cuz they don't have no more answers they don't even believe the doctors they don't believe the scientist don't believe the politicians it's lies lies lies lies lies and it's all coming from the father of lies because he's the one that's inspiring it and so the people don't have answers to their problems anymore they sending them into depressions oppressions and all kinds of phobias and fears and complexes and anxieties and getting all kinds of things coming upon them because they have no answers you know your your brain you're trying to use your own brain to solve problems and after while can't do it it's like a machine that charge circuit is that right you know you overload certain types of machines all sudden you and smoke because it it just can't take it and the human being is wired to worship wired to serve God and you're trying to overlo it by doing something else after a while that thing is going to short circuit and a lot of that is taking place right now yes people are going ins s and they W away from God and wondering where to turn to and what to do and the funny thing about them is that God has in you will simply tell them Christ is the answer and they laughing uh I was in the lawyer's office and talking to him and he said well how did that happen I I don't understand how did this all of a sudden happen like that said well you know it was just the hand of God oh yes God as if when mocking way to everything you is God that is too simple an answer how can it be God you must have some contact with some powerful person for that to happen well I do have a contact with the most powerful person but you don't want to believe it you want to think it's a natural person amen but God is still in control God is still Sovereign and he he sits and he looks down to the Lord and he knows everything that's going on and nothing can be hidden from him his eye is in every place Lord praise God hallelujah and his word the Bible says run swiftly throughout the Earth to fulfill whatever he says amen praise God so we know that the people don't know where to turn where to turn to but we know that the Bible and the message that we have received has the answers for this day and for this hour Hallelujah iined that we have been given the answers to meet the challenge of this hour and that's the only reason we as a as a people as a people will overcome that's right we will not overcome by our own study wisdom research or knowledge but we will we will overcome by him who has already overcome the wor amen which they triy to in history but he's risen from the dead and he's alive forever more and that's the only reason we are overcoming not by our strength but his strength made perfect in our weakness by that we will overcome praise God so to him be all the glory and the praise everything you ever accomplish to his glory and praise everything that we do it's not by our strength or by our Grace but it's by the grace of God raise our hands us us what he will do for us that day I will not leave you alone but I'll be with you to the very end of thee he PR in the word and I believe this promise amen I hope you do also praise God the people are searching everywhere for they're running all everywhere amen just to think of it is goat yoga going to save you listen to such a ridiculous nonsense you know watching the goats the Z they jump and then you get a yoga system from that goat yoga you know you're making yourself a goat and then you know all kinds of foolishness you know because they don't have an answer I think somewhere brother BR said turning back to spiritualism and Witchcraft and all these things because man heart yearn to worship a spirit being God right but because they reject God we said because you reject what I'm telling you I'm going to turn you over to every un natural and wicked and evil thing to make you believe nonsense to make you believe all kinds of Stuffy nonsense that's where the world is today they're Believing on things that should be un believable they are believing and what should be believable they're not believing it and so they're running into all kinds of trouble they don't know where to look anymore but we know how to look away to Jesus Hallelujah we know how to look to the finisher of ourish Hallelujah yes Jesus and amen here is Son of Man the bottom the alpha H but there the son of man in the top Oma praise God he started it and he finish it amen for he's the author and and the finisher a revelation comes from him and he's going to perfect it and bring us right out into the perfect statue of a perfect man glory to God hallelujah amen yes sir praise God so we have to listen to what God is saying in this hour and watch the signs of the times now Jesus of course in the Bible was asked again and again over and over what the signs should be asked that by whether it was John the Baptist whether it was Sadducees by by his own disciples Matthew 24 you know that uh Matthew 24 when they asked him what what would be the sign your coming and use our scripture here tonight it was the SES ofes ask what will be the sign in the end like that and then John the Baptist is asking are you the Christ and he wants to know are you the one that's supposed to come right he was actually asking about his first Covenant right like that so you can see it right down man always want to know when is the Messiah come even now the Jews are over there in Israel they asking the same question when will the Messiah arrive when he's going to come amen see that's always the question praise the Lord hallelujah so the sign that he he was the Messiah of course he showed them many signs while he was alive but the crucifixion actually uh settled it off they should have known by that crucifixion they didn't believe his virgin birth even though Isaiah 800 years before had said it it shall be a sign that a virgin will conceive and their my God that should be a miraculous thing and they should be looking for a virgin to conceive and bear a son but when the Virgin did come and tell them that she did conceive and she was bearing a son they called they called her a for amen CU said they tell them Jesus you you want the fornication right so they didn't recognize that sign it passed right by and that's why Jesus knew that many signs would given right like that and they uh you know they were asking this questions first of all you know John the Baptist art thou the one that should come amen and then Jesus referred him to many signs there in the Bible if you go find the scripture this is a Bible study right so you need to go back when I'm finish here and look and read your Bible around the subject so that you can Enlighten yourself even more personally okay praise the Lord cuz if I were to ever put all the scriptures all this and that be there for hours is that right we've been there for hours we don't need I don't need to do that you are the one that needs to go and dig in the word of God to get the actual scriptures that are there amen excuse me hallelujah amen amen now the scripture we read tonight Jesus were was rebuked the religious leaders of this day because they were religious leaders and he says you're the religious leaders but you don't even recognize the sign of your time which is he was the Super sign standing there amen he was the Super sign all the wonders of miracles signs wonders and you still ask him what it is but said if there if if this room was in total darkness and then God spoke and said let be light something bright up there you going to still ask what is that he just said let there be light and something bright appears you and it has never been before but now something you have never seen happen and and something bright appears you don't have to ask the he said the manifestation is the interpretation CU once the thing appears before you that is the interpretation you know what it is and you recognize what is going on praise the Lord hallelujah so here it is amen he says you that to these men that you know the signs of nature that when the sun comes up a certain way in the morning you know it's going to be a good day that's right when it goes down with this red lowering and have certain things around it you can read those signs of Nature and you recognize What's happen and the next day you know it's going to be a bad day he said you can read the Natural Science but you got no Revelation to understand the spiritual science written in the word because it was already there in the word as it was in the of soal as it was in the of so shall there's many scriptures there well did Isaiah say he was even giv them the scriptures well this other one say so and so and so oh you Hypocrites you can read that but you can't see what the signs of the times are right there he was preaching the message that brother BR saw that's why he put it in mod terms recognize your day and it message Hallelujah this the same thing Jesus was preaching but brother caught that Revelation what he was telling him and he preached the message to meet our time and our season and our day amen that if we're going to make it true we must recognize what day we in now if you didn't recognize that a prophet came okay if you did not recognize that Malachi 4 was fulfilled 45 Revelation 10:7 was fulfilled Luke 17:31 is now being made manifest the unveiling of the Mighty God Son of Man now being revealed if you didn't know that every one of us would be sitting right in that Cemetery uh back in the old denominational houses or religions or faith that amen you know that that's right plus I would have never known you brother then right I would have never known you sister we all come from thousands of miles apart but brother B knew that a miracle was about to occur from his ministry that's why he said they they come from the East and West they come from the lands ofar to Fe with the king of the Revelation to die as his guest how blessed those PMS are beholding the face he means catching the Revelation for the day amen hallelujah with light theine the word L up amen bless partakers of his grace by grace alone amen as GS in his crown to shine amen it polishes us and makes us into jewels in the king's crown glory to God hallelujah amen and so if you didn't recog it I didn't recognize it we wouldn't even be here tonight amen this as simple as you see it you're looking at a predestinated miracle we are here by predestination Prophet said you think you just walk in there by your own will and you decide you're just going to come to church you are here because the spirit of God LED your here that's right because other people heard the same thing you didn't do anything to them but you heard the same thing and it did something to you and still doing something for because you're tracking on in you're Journey to the promised land beyond the river praise the Lord something is leading and guiding you hallelujah amen oh praise God Jesus was saying to them in other words if you be the leaders of the people you can deser the natural signs but you can't discern the supernatural signs how in the world are you going to be able to teach the people War the people and preach to them about hell judgment sin uh Redemption repentance how we going to teach all these things because we yourself not seen the danger you you go back read the Bible you see he tried to refer that to them so many times so they can catch on but they never fall blind leaving the blind would they not both fall in the ditch and so many other scriptures he used like that even had to explain to the disciples unto you it is given to know the Mysteries but unto them it's not given praise God to them it's a mystery to use a revelation to them it's a parable to use a promise amen praise God he was just doing everything he can being the wave Chief to try to wave something in FR of them just like when a baby's just born you know their sight is not good like Paul said now we see through a class Darkly amen praise God so the mother puts up toys and stuff like that and hands it up so that when the colors move and and and and the wind sways it or whatever she might even shake it it's so that that child's eyes can start learning to focus right and then after wife can see clearly and then it's able to know it's Mom then it's able to know it's Dad but when they just born there sight is not clear as yet it takes a while for the uh the sight to open up like that but that's what Jesus he was the way sheep God was waving him in front of that now to say see this see that see this see this see that see this see this other the thing here just for them to catch on they didn't catch Hallelujah and in our day God picked up brother BR raised him up amen with the spirit of God waved him in front of him of us hallelujah amen this is a prophet amen he has the word for the hour praise God attract your attention first B second B praise God I see the word being made flesh I see the word come back I see the restoration I see the resurrection and R progress I see beond the river never fa Now by we gain that P here and there one by one began the portal there to dwell with the Immortals Prophet said the moment you cast the Revelation and break in you recognize that you always was an eternal being amen it's only an eternal being is understanding Eternal being is that right only God can understand God that's why no man can see God and live is that right you just another human you can't see God who live but by revelation we see God seeing God and it made us live amen praise God hallelujah here we are praise His wonderful precious name amen hallelujah well we know in the Old Testament times God gave a lot of signs to kind of inform people about the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ it's whether or not they were willing to read the science recognize the SS and obey the science so that it could be made manifest clearly to them amen hallelujah so we know if they had done that they would have an apostate uh not the day the hour but they will recognize the season of the coming of the Lord now we even us we don't recognize the exact day because he already said no man is going to know the exact day right I'm using the word in two compound ways to recognize the exact day like Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday but no man is going to recognize the day which the son of man comes right but Hallelujah he didn't say you're not going to recognize the day or season in another sense you would recognize the season it's a season and when that season comes in for the word to be fulfilled just like uh if I would put it the way when Simeon uh start coming to the temple because it was revealed to him by Revelation it was a time for the Christ to appear in the temple amen hallelujah so he just started going to the temple Anna she CAU the same thing she started going to the temple and waiting there and looking looking at all them uh young women coming to offer up their child and everything else and that one day he felt a strong feeling she felt the S and they walk both out and when they come both of them set their eyes on the one young virgin with her child in her hand amen oh Lord let the Ser depart in peace my eyes have seen the salvation of the Lord hallelujah I see the SA God hallelujah he saw the sign of the day praise God hallelujah now if there were pain mind they would recognize when this woman started talking about being a virgin and still bearing her son this even if one of them was really spiritual they would have recognized then here's another clue the Bible says and thou Bethlehem a from thee it's from you that the king is going to be born amen and he's going to come out of the root of the seed of David Hallelujah both Mary and Joseph of course come from that L and he was born in that L right so they should have immediately recognize that he was a son of David because you know David's connection with Bethlehem and the Bale and all of that and the real well was Now dog right there Bethlehem he they had that one dog there but that was just a symbol the real well was now here in Bethlehem and they failed to recognize it amen and there many other scriptures that was pointing to him where he was born lying he would come from you know how a virgin would conceive and so on many things like that and they still would did not recognize it if they did they would have recognized at least the season and time amen praise the Lord hallelujah but they did not recognize the season and time and they didn't understand what was happening or else they would agree with him Hallelujah but they had their own ideas amen amen would you write down John 7:27 because when Jesus spoke to them they turned around and said when Christ comes no one will know when he come whence he is from not there were so blind that that the scriptures there were Masters in the scripture boasting that they were theologians of their day there were scribes of their day and they read all those scriptures and yet they're saying the scripture doesn't tell from whence Christ will come but it's not till Herod threatened those wise men and said you got to tell me an answer what these men are talking about you know the wise men that came and asked him uh where is he born King of the Jews then he told his wise men find the answers let me know then the really search the scriptures because desperation Herod never fooled around if you didn't bring him the answer your head was off so desperation they dou and it said oh we found the prophecy of the Prophet out that out of Bethlehem the Christ would be born amen hallelujah but then recognize that in the first place amen and here they read the scripture and yet they're looking at Mary Joseph and his child in Bethlehem and they still didn't recogniz so you can read the scripture and not have a Revelations true you had Theologian you can study the scripture all your life and you'll have no understanding of what you're reading praise the Lord hallelujah well friends we know the signs of times are very important and you know that that even if we got GPS and all that today and you also have signs on the streets you can read the signs but let me tell you if you really don't follow the signs you're going to be in a mess you be going in circles is that right you be going in circles now uh not to say America is any less than Canada but when I go over there I don't understand their system of signs because a matter of fact somebody can take the sign and turn it in the opposite direction it can be pointed this way or that way or whatever and you don't really know where to go and sometimes the signs are too abrupt in other words if you have to turn here the sign is right there there is nothing up the road way to tell you in order you going have to make a right you we are used to having our science place maybe one two coming up to a you know a turn off you know all of a sudden the sign is there and you got turn amen and you happen to be in the outside Lane God help you but when you go up to the next turn off and think it's easy for you to just make you turn and come back when you come off up in the city your T there the streets are so I don't know B mess that might by time you get back around to come you might be lost up there before you get back down to the highway amen so signs are very important amen amen and God brother B said never brings man to judgment without giving a fair warning first so he sends prophets but he sends them way ahead of time so that you have a lot of time to get yourself ready and do whatever you have to do so that when the changing of the age come the change of dispensation comes you can make the time because you recognize your day and this message recognize also the sign post that God placed there that in this day Mal 45 will be the sign in this day and you have to go where it's wanted of course a lot of people still get lost because they sit down under the signpost oh great signpost oh great prophet oh and that's wonderful but that's not getting know where you're supposed to go if you sit right underneath the sign and because the sign is big enough to give you some shade you shade yourself out of the sign and you're not going on to where you're supposed to go you got to go out there never mind that hot son is going to hit you trial tribulation and you're going to be many times tested whether you're ashamed of him or persecuting whatever you got a hallelujah thank you Lord amen hallelujah amen now we know when we speak about the signs of the times we mean signs that will give us light in our day not concerning the Jesus being born but the coming of the son of man that's what we looking at the coming of the son of man in our day praise God Hallelujah for the head to return to the body which he was building through seven Church anges like we spoke on Sunday amen praise the Lord so the head is now going to come back on the body and like we describ the flange like he described it's got to fit in that pocket so they can settle them solid and the whole thing will be cemented together by the love of God Amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen is this making any sense praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen hallelujah oh my so when when we look now we're not looking back like a lot of the Pentecostals Methodist Baptists not to be critical but they're looking back and they are looking for Jesus to come again but they're looking for the Jesus that they saw back in uh you know back when he came the first time they don't recognize that this is a different common amen and they are not because they don't recognize that they don't know how to prepare for the events that are to take place are are taking they don't know how to prepare how to pack up how to get ready the bright has made ready only Revelation gets R and if you don't have Revelation how you going to get ready amen praise the name of the Lord like let me give you just a small example oh come to the altar Pentecostal uh Pentecostal um altar call come to the altar come to the Lord so be born again all some all some scripture repent of your come repent to the AL and everything else now to be honest how are you going to repent if you don't even have a revelation of what original sin is amen you understand what you doing is only repenting of maybe few things you did smoking drinkly but we're talking about a total Deliverance now that's right we're talking about repent original sin we talking about your sin and we talking about even taking our future sin M amen and you just you run to the Altar and say Lord I used to use drugs Lord I smoke forgive me praise the Lord and you talk like that but you don't have a revelation of the enormity the cruelty and the real Corruption of sin that it goes from the out inside out complete total death amen sin brings death amen hallelujah it don't just twist your mind and twist your body twist your thought piss your soul and then somehow you going to be all right no it kills right sin destroys you and only he can bring you back to life amen give you life out of death praise God so without the Revelation a person really can't really repent they really can't even believe because you say oh I believe Jesus believe Jesus well faith has to have a foundation what do you believe when you say you believe what you really believe if something has been revealed to you where you your Fai how is your faith going to your your find a res in place amen it's got to have a rest in place and that res in place has to be not just the Bible but a revelation of the word of God that's right amen so you rest on that the revelation of the word of God they are still back where they are just resting on the readings of the Bible amen and they can make money off of it manufacture it do this sell things do that do whatever else but that's just the the the written part of the word they're masters of it and they're building on that but but that's building on S amen but we are building on the Rock revelation of the word of God amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen yes sir oh praise God hallelujah what does that what did Brother BR say Watchman what the night morning cometh and what the night Hallelujah the Rapture is coming do you know what time it is now three minutes of midnight is it midnight what hour is it you going to know what is the that you must wake up to go to work or wake up to go on your trip your journey or take your flight or whatever do you know the hour are you aware what's happening J of God times and we living in recognize your day and a message for your day praise the name of the Lord so we got to keep our eyes also on God's time peace that's right and we know according to scripture that Israel is last time Beast amen hallelujah when we see all these signs combining themselves and everything else conglomerating and and getting together Hallelujah said watch he says when he s about the combine is coming he says I need the world C amen check sometime in your computer and you'll find that he actually use that to say he's talking about the world com to the churches they're going to churches going to combine together to push the word out amen so the combine is com he knows what is happening praise God so we see all these signs coming together like that and all the focus is going to turn on Israel and it is turning on Israel amen and he says when you see that begins to happen the kinds of the Gentiles are over hallelujah how you going to recognize if you don't recognize Revelation 107 amen 10 10 1-7 the angel put his foot one of the land one on the sea and he says what time shall be no more in other words the time for these prophecies has come to an end the age is over it's run out not time for the world run out but he's talking about the time like when Jesus was to be born one and when the fullness of time had come God s for his son doesn't mean time for the world ended but the time for the prophecy is now here and it's got to be fulfilled praise God hallelujah amen now if you have no Revelation you will recognize that sign right you wouldn't recognize the sign how many of them recognize that Jesus already descended they don't know anything they're read the Bible child boys trumpet but they have no idea no Revelation that he stepped down already and he is here appearing to his bride preparing her for his com amen Prophet said he's already come and you didn't know it but right now he's here in word for all praise the Lord and soon he'll fulfill all that he has spoken of in his word praise the Lord hallelujah amen hallelujah so if you are a people a revelated people let me use that word a revelated people a people who have receive the Revelation then you also know that you have a great responsibility because with wisdom knowledge experience comes responsibility and that responsibility God will hold us guilty because he said son of man I show you these things if you don't warn the unbelieving and the wicked I'll hold you guilty your their blood will be on your hands you at least need to warn them whatever they do that's up to them am God said because when you speak to them he says if they don't take what you say then from there on I know their blood be on their own head right so we don't have any excuse to say Well they're not going to take it whatever he says whether they take it or they don't take it War you got to war that it's coming soon Jesus coming soon morning and night and do no many will meet their Doom Hallelujah so therefore we must warn our friends our family our neighbors everybody that we meet whenever we have an opening or an opportunity we need to warn them that the Lord Jesus is coming again and you're doing it by Revelation amen hallelujah amen and I want to thank God for one thing God don't speak to his people in rhyth right that's right is that right amen he speak to the people outside in rhythms amen but to us he speaks to us in Revelation amen he puts his lips to our ears and he whispers to our ears just like he did with Moses he said Moses is special for I speak to him lip to air amen is that right Whispers of midnight when you lay on your bed praise God hallelujah you hear a voice you don't even know where it come from you're in the middle of sleep God speaks to you amen you're half awake and God speaking to you you know somebody spoke to you but you weren't really fully awake but then you come awake later and realize oh my goodness I was listen to speaking glory to God hallelujah amen God doesn't speak to people in rhy he speaks to us by Revelation amen God will use somebody familiar your mother your father your aunt your grandfather something like that if he's going to speak to you you'll see their image in in your dream or in your vision and then they'll speak amen I said had a dream of my grandfather and he told me this that that but God used that because he knows you're familiar with that so he used him he says you know you're you're not scared of it praise the Lord uh brother Bron was okay but I don't know me even if an angel appear how I would react if I fall over pass right out or whatever I don't know so he'll use something familiar with you so that you would't be so scared that you would listen to his voice amen praise the name of the Lord so he speaks to us by Revelation amen praise the Lord and we know right now a lot of things is happening in our present world Amen and we need a lot of men of isachar that can able to interpret the times praise the Lord amen men like brother Vin men like brother auy amen men that can interpret the times and apply what's happening out there back to the world and bring it back to our day in our time so we recognize what is going on there many other brothers I just mentioned those um to um Brothers there because I know about their Ministry and what God is doing with and through them for his glory amen hallelujah amen now right now we know that uh we look back and we see so much history but do you know that in the modern and the present generation we are making more history in 5 years than they made in a thousand years you realize that prophecies have been fulfilled like that and brother Bon like was with Jesus on the day when he was crucified about 400 prophecies fulfilled just like that and now we are nearer to his coming again scripture and prophecy be fulfilling like that fast is been taking place like that he said what he said he'll Mak it a quick short work and then they going home praise God the scripture is being fulfilled and much is happening it's just that Hallelujah not all of us but but some of us have enough wisdom knowledge and interpretation to read the newspapers and even you sometimes you reading your newspapers you catch something here something there uh some of us will catch it a little deeper and recognize what is really going on but much is taking place brother amen we are not living a boring day this is not a boring time brother then it's an exciting hour that's right you read your papers you look around you see what's happening just got to stop at the street street corner and and just watch the crowds go by amen go down the Young Street and just watch the the crowds go by

every year then they change them every 6 months then they down to changing them every three months and a businessman was telling me said every time you do one cup I got to change mine because I got to keep up with the speed I got to keep up with the memory amen praise God now we know Jesus is coming in the clouds is that right amen hallelujah oh my Paul talks about that which was reserved in the heavens for you now do you know what they're doing they're starting to take hard drives out of the computers and your tablets you don't need any memory anymore slowly it's going to fade away and all
