[0:00] okay without further Ado may we
[0:05] please read our
[0:15] scriptures um it's first Peter
[0:20] 5:8 first John 4:4
[0:37] [Music]
[0:40] when okay it says
[0:43] that be
[0:46] sober be
[0:48] vigilant because your adversary the
[0:52] devil as a roaring lion walk about
[0:57] seeking he made devour and then first
[1:01] John
[1:09] 4:4 ye are of God little children and
[1:14] have overcome them because greater is
[1:19] he that is in you than he that's in the
[1:23] world let's
[1:25] pray our gracious Eternal God you are
[1:29] you are the Fanon of life and The Giver
[1:32] of all good things father we so grateful
[1:36] we so thankful that you made a way for
[1:39] us to be here tonight father you saw it
[1:42] before the foundations of the world the
[1:44] people that you chose you selected you
[1:47] made a way to be here Lord I pray God
[1:50] that you bless every individual here
[1:53] Lord may you help me get myself out of
[1:55] the way Lord you help me to see
[1:58] something to bless your people may you
[2:01] help them to receive it oh God open
[2:04] their heart and my heart my mouth father
[2:07] to say the right way father I pray oh
[2:09] God In The Name of Jesus in the contrary
[2:13] spirit that try to raise his head up
[2:15] cast it out in the name of Jesus be B in
[2:19] the contrary Spirit may the great Holy
[2:21] Ghost have his free cause and set your
[2:24] children free in the name of Jesus for
[2:27] whom the Son of God has set free is free
[2:31] indeed Hallelujah please be
[2:35] seated my topic tonight is greater is he
[2:40] that is in you than he that's in the
[2:55] world I first got this thought in one of
[2:59] our prayers meetings I think the last
[3:01] one Chris was there just God played my
[3:05] heart to just speak a little bit more
[3:07] about
[3:08] here so my topic here is greater is he
[3:12] that is in you than he that is in the
[3:17] world Amen Hallelujah and as a son or
[3:21] daughter of
[3:22] God you have to know that God lives
[3:26] inside of you amen but at the same time
[3:30] Jus we
[3:33] have an
[3:35] enemy that we fighting every day and
[3:40] that enemy is a devil he has his own
[3:43] tatus trying to F the joy of the
[3:47] Believers so if a true Christian like a
[3:51] boxer when any boxer goes into a ring he
[3:54] knows his big point and whilst before
[4:00] even fight the best boxers they try to
[4:04] get a sparing partners that fight the
[4:07] same way as their enemy so when they get
[4:11] the ring before they get there they have
[4:13] studied and fight with that um sparing
[4:17] partner so that they know how to knock
[4:20] that um their opponent out so is every
[4:26] Christian you got to know the devices
[4:29] and the ways of the devil I'm not saying
[4:32] that spend all your time to stud the
[4:33] devil spend more
[4:36] time spend more time in the presence of
[4:39] God and let God be inside of you but at
[4:43] the same cling don't have to be ignorant
[4:45] of the devices of the enemy so that when
[4:48] he rises up you'll be able to him off
[4:52] from the sin and if you check when God
[4:57] first called me in Montreal there was
[5:00] one brother white brother that I met he
[5:03] told me to listen to this greatest
[5:06] battle ever forth and it's a very good
[5:09] message so listening to it most of the
[5:11] time and I remember one time brother to
[5:14] was speaking and said that that message
[5:17] is so good that he listened to it like
[5:19] once in every six months so once in a
[5:22] while just go back and listen to that
[5:25] and every time I get something new from
[5:28] it it blesses my so there's so much
[5:30] nugget in that greatest battle ever
[5:33] forth
[5:36] and said there that I don't have the
[5:39] quot here I think that I just there
[5:43] there are two fores is the devil and God
[5:47] Amen God is a real God it's a living God
[5:52] God is a person
[5:54] yes that when he the Holy Ghost comes it
[5:57] means that first personal Pro now God is
[6:01] a person the devil is also a person so
[6:04] as a true Christian always going to face
[6:07] this people but the greatest battle that
[6:10] ever fought is in your mind that's when
[6:13] the Battle Ground take place and the
[6:16] tactics of the enemy is to cause the
[6:19] human race to disbelieve God's word
[6:23] right and God also put his faith in the
[6:27] human heart so that you will believe
[6:29] human heart so you have a
[6:32] choice you have a free moral agency to
[6:36] allow God's word to be in your heart and
[6:39] have that faith in God's word to defeat
[6:41] the enemy every time or you have a
[6:44] choice to accept the devil's lie because
[6:47] remember a lie always contains about 99%
[6:50] truth and then he just m one little way
[6:54] that's what he did to deceive e in the G
[6:56] of he gave 99% and Mer just not that
[7:01] shall not that's why the whole human
[7:04] race is in chaos because the devil dece
[7:08] a Woman by just adding one little way
[7:13] and that has always been the same that's
[7:16] why the Bible said that a woman is a we
[7:18] vessel and being that we vessel the
[7:20] enemy goes that Channel all the time so
[7:23] he said that I suffered a woman not to
[7:26] preach or to ass authority over the man
[7:29] for for the woman being deceived fall in
[7:32] transgression why God knows that they
[7:34] have that weakness part in them so he
[7:37] said that they should not preach the
[7:39] word I'm not preaching the sisters now
[7:41] but I'm just um expressing my
[7:46] point am okay
[7:51] so so with that said in mind if your man
[7:58] every true mature man that is married
[8:01] you have to always be on the leg because
[8:04] the enemy in the Garden of Eden he went
[8:07] to eeve the weig vessel and you as a
[8:11] Christian the devil knows that you are
[8:13] saved that one you can't do nothing
[8:16] about your salvation you going to heaven
[8:19] no no doubt but what he does is that if
[8:23] he wants to get the man could not get
[8:25] you he go to the big vessel to try to
[8:28] cause to tries to bring chaos at home
[8:33] and if he doesn't get the woman he goes
[8:35] and their children and then the the
[8:39] husband and the wife their mind always
[8:40] toring on their children because what
[8:44] he's always have those devices so you
[8:47] have to wake up and recognize that it's
[8:50] not your wife it's not your children is
[8:52] the enemy try to cause so you have to go
[8:55] on your knees and cast him out from them
[8:58] because the Lord Jesus Christ cast out
[9:00] the devil in the name of in my name you
[9:04] shall cast out Devils so we have the
[9:06] power in the name of Jesus tonight cast
[9:10] out Devils from your mind from your from
[9:12] every part because you got a power you
[9:15] got power in Jesus name you got power in
[9:21] Jesus got power in Jesus to get
[9:25] everything Jesus Christ is all powerful
[9:27] God he's the greatest of
[9:31] the
[9:33] devil every
[9:36] day all what him if you don't power Hees
[9:42] have any power so why you give him power
[9:45] spend your time on chist on the word of
[9:48] God and have that power of God in you
[9:51] and you run the Bible said I resist the
[9:54] devil he he will flee from you so chance
[10:00] don't give any opportunity you have all
[10:03] the right you know your you protect all
[10:07] your weak PR say in the presence of God
[10:10] he can do you anything you are more than
[10:12] a conqueror through him who conquer the
[10:15] Lord and Jesus Christ he's still coming
[10:18] for you he hasn't changed
[10:22] hallelu God is good isn't it he's more
[10:25] than able Hallelujah and the guide of
[10:28] eating
[10:30] Hallelujah there are two things that
[10:31] happen sorry on calary there are two
[10:34] things that happen first of
[10:37] all the Lord Jesus Christ strip off when
[10:42] he was crucified he strip up all the
[10:45] power of the devil he is powerless he
[10:48] was wounded that Beast was wounded once
[10:52] and for all so he has no power what he
[10:56] does is that your power that you have
[10:59] when he comes and put those thoughts and
[11:01] doubts in your mind because the greatest
[11:04] B ever
[11:05] F say that you have you have five senses
[11:10] your body which is you contact by your C
[11:14] taste hearing and smelling those five
[11:19] senses and
[11:21] then in the soul has another five senses
[11:26] that is your conscious memory
[11:29] reasons affections and that stuff but
[11:33] then the spirit has only one source it's
[11:36] either Faith or without so God put his
[11:40] faith in that in that Spirit and the
[11:44] Devil comes and put what unbelief in
[11:46] there so that's where the battle goes on
[11:49] so you have the power to resist the
[11:52] devil and just stand on the word of God
[11:55] no matter what it comes because you
[11:58] always going to use your
[11:59] memory and he W tell you the right that
[12:02] you have done you only go all com and
[12:05] tell you your past mes but God comes and
[12:09] tells you your past victories so you
[12:12] have to dwell on the past Victory you
[12:14] hear from God two voices it depends on
[12:18] the one you more to one more to have
[12:21] more control so don't listen to that
[12:24] voice that is not Victorious voice
[12:26] always listen to that Victorious voice
[12:29] when you listen to that Victorious voice
[12:31] you remember become like Samson because
[12:33] when Samson was in when Samson eyes was
[12:37] all gone and there was no hope anywhere
[12:40] when in that Darkest Hour of his of his
[12:43] life he began to think on the V that he
[12:46] T and said where is that V where can't I
[12:49] have that anymore and then he repented
[12:52] and made things right when he make
[12:55] things right have the victory more than
[12:57] his entire life because he was able to
[13:00] defeat the Philistines more than every
[13:03] fight he has ever fight why he REM the
[13:07] victories and made things right so what
[13:10] I'm saying tonight that remember the
[13:13] good times with your lord Jesus Christ
[13:16] think on those good things with God
[13:20] those things that edifies those things
[13:23] that blesses your
[13:26] soul Johnson lik it why should I praise
[13:29] God he been so good to me for blessing
[13:33] one by you see what the Lord has done
[13:37] for God has done so much for we have to
[13:41] thank him and praise him every day
[13:43] because he so good to me he so good to
[13:46] you he's a wonderful God he never lost a
[13:50] battle just thank you every day every
[13:52] morning because you are victorious in
[13:55] Christ Jesus amen hallelujah Cal
[13:59] the other thing that happened was so
[14:01] great I was so good was God himself gave
[14:06] up his Spirit he gave up The Ghost and
[14:09] on the day of Pentecost he divided
[14:11] himself and came on the 120 people and
[14:14] multiply himself and from that time his
[14:18] Spirit has become available and he lives
[14:21] in you he lives in me that's why is
[14:25] greater is he that is in
[14:27] you amen amen
[14:29] am amen hallelujah that he that is in
[14:34] the world Amen because he is he lives
[14:37] inside of you the God of all creation he
[14:41] made himself available so that he lives
[14:44] inside of you and when he lives inside
[14:46] of you then you'll be able to do exact
[14:48] same thing he did when he was on this
[14:51] Earth because him living in you anyways
[14:54] and when he
[14:57] was he was able to tell the
[15:00] wind to be quiet when there was a storm
[15:04] on that boat he said the wind calm down
[15:08] and calm down why because greater is he
[15:11] that was in him than a wind that was giv
[15:14] the disciples trouble because the
[15:17] creator of the wind was in the Lord
[15:19] Jesus Christ so when he tell that wind
[15:21] to stop it C down there's any R in your
[15:24] life you have the authority to tell that
[15:26] R to go and is he that in the Lord Jesus
[15:31] Christ Lazarus who have been D 4 days
[15:35] and
[15:36] S when he said laus come forth that was
[15:40] more than a Manus has to come forth and
[15:44] what come back to life because greater
[15:47] is he in the Lord Jesus Christ than that
[15:50] thinking death and that same God is here
[15:53] you said oh brother Phil that was God
[15:56] himself yes but remember
[15:59] when someone like
[16:02] Moses when he has a battle when God
[16:06] promised Israel to move them from Egypt
[16:10] to Palestine he gave them promise after
[16:14] 400 years I will bring you out what was
[16:17] a mighty end when that time came Moses
[16:21] came on the scene he led them from Egypt
[16:27] going to promised land and and they have
[16:29] their
[16:30] first crisis there was Red Sea in front
[16:34] of them behind them was that Egyptian me
[16:39] pharaoh and his group and there was no
[16:42] way out I don't know he said anyone here
[16:46] tonight that have a situation that you
[16:49] can't see your way forward you can't see
[16:51] your way back you have a resting
[16:53] situation in your in your life right now
[16:56] I don't there anyone with any rest
[16:59] situation just believe that that same
[17:02] God who was greater than Moses on on on
[17:07] the he said speak and come forth and
[17:12] Moses
[17:14] said Grace his Ro and that calm down and
[17:19] God Cal the situation down and they were
[17:21] able to walk in that sea Hallelujah
[17:25] greater is SE that was Moses than
[17:29] so anyone situation that you can't go
[17:33] your way remember that same God that
[17:37] [Music]
[17:38] wases to stand that
[17:41] [Music]
[17:43] tonight in
[17:48] Jesus God is here he has changed he's a
[17:52] con he's the same God still conquering
[17:57] Hallelujah amen hallelujah God is good
[18:01] is am praise God hallelujah I feel good
[18:06] over here because I'm serving a living
[18:08] God he hasn't
[18:11] changed and after the death of Moses
[18:17] Joshua who was faithful to his servant
[18:19] Moses he also have a condition he has a
[18:23] situation that he fa he has a battle to
[18:27] go through
[18:29] and when the battle started he needed
[18:32] the
[18:34] son and Joshua who needed a son to stand
[18:38] still told the son to stand still And
[18:41] that son obey Joshua why because greater
[18:44] is he that was in josua the when he
[18:47] spoke that has to stand still the moon
[18:50] has stand still Moon don't come stand
[18:53] stand still because I need the victory
[18:57] they still they obey Joshua why because
[19:00] greater is he that was in josua than the
[19:04] son that same God is here with
[19:08] us greater is he that was in David than
[19:12] the philis that he met that g because
[19:16] both David has had a victory in his life
[19:20] before and one thing that Believers have
[19:24] to always remember that David never
[19:27] forgot
[19:29] David
[19:30] remembered that the same God that gave
[19:34] him victory over the B and over the lion
[19:39] is more than able to give him victory
[19:42] over that uncircumcised Philistine why
[19:46] because the children of Israel Joshua
[19:49] and all the rest they know that God is
[19:52] good God they know God is more than able
[19:56] to deliver them from the hands of the
[19:57] enemy
[19:59] but
[20:00] when go was standing there knowing only
[20:05] that God can could do it they never have
[20:08] the revelation of the word it wasn't
[20:10] revealed to them that they can defeat
[20:13] that go but it was revealed to him and
[20:18] that revation was able to defeat go and
[20:22] Revelation is the most important thing
[20:24] that every believer needs it's what the
[20:27] devil hates but the children of God
[20:30] loves it because God reveal to you you
[20:33] have that Authority you have the power
[20:36] has no CL what is going on with you
[20:39] because God has revealed it to you and
[20:42] re and because of Revelation that's why
[20:46] Abel was able to offer an excellent
[20:49] sacrifice but it was revealed to Abel
[20:53] what he has of what requirement that God
[20:57] and God testify of his gift so without
[21:01] Revelation you can't pleas God Amen that
[21:05] without faith no one can please Jesus am
[21:07] and you need is what the church needs
[21:10] all the time more than anything else
[21:13] because the Gate of Hell cannot Prevail
[21:15] against
[21:16] Revelation that reation
[21:19] is a victory so when that Revelation
[21:22] anything you have need of when it's
[21:25] fully revealed to you nothing can stand
[21:28] for you you be more than a conquerer no
[21:31] wonder when the bride recogniz who she
[21:34] is she will be an invisible Army you
[21:37] really recognize that the god that
[21:40] created the whole world lives inside his
[21:42] heart and greater is he that is in you
[21:46] that he that is in the world Amen
[21:51] Hallelujah God is good isn't it amen
[21:55] amen hallelujah greater is he
[21:59] that was in the Hebrew children when
[22:02] they have a situation and everything was
[22:06] going wrong one thing I like about those
[22:09] Hebrew children they believe God they
[22:12] trust
[22:13] God
[22:15] and I encourage the Believers it doesn't
[22:18] matter what situation that you are in we
[22:21] believe that God is more than able to
[22:23] deliver you from there's nothing that
[22:26] God canot do he can do all
[22:29] there's nothing that God cannot do but
[22:32] those Hebrew children said we know and
[22:36] we believe how God is more than able to
[22:40] deliver it but even if you chose not to
[22:43] we still not going to bow down to this
[22:46] not going to bow down to the to that
[22:49] situation so what I'm saying is that no
[22:52] matter what condition you are in God is
[22:55] more than able to deliver you there is
[22:57] nothing that God cannot do
[23:03] [Music]
[23:04] chose best for at the right time you
[23:08] turn everything around at the right time
[23:11] all things work together for
[23:13] good God in his own time he will make
[23:17] all things
[23:19] beautiful he's God isn't it is so great
[23:25] Hallelujah so what I'm saying tonight
[23:29] is that greater is he that is in you
[23:33] than every situation anyone of is facing
[23:36] tonight you pH I got problems I got days
[23:42] with my children I got days with my M
[23:45] like this that remember there is no
[23:49] situation God canot solve is he that is
[23:52] in you tonight that
[23:55] every just let that s inside of you
[23:59] because the god that created the whole
[24:00] universe he is inside of you and greater
[24:04] is he that's in you than every situation
[24:07] that you face today I remember when I
[24:09] have my first my second daughter Grace
[24:12] when she was born the doctor said that
[24:15] she can't hear and it bring H in her
[24:18] home but I pray and trust God and
[24:21] greater is he that was in me that that
[24:24] year that he said cannot hear God came
[24:27] on the scene pray and we trusted God the
[24:30] next time everything was
[24:38] fine
[24:40] tonen report listen to the true report
[24:44] because greater is he that is in you
[24:47] than any report that those doctors will
[24:50] tell you amen trust God his report is
[24:53] the best he has change amen h
[24:59] hallelujah thank you Lord
[25:02] amen God is good isn't it aen Hallelujah
[25:07] God is so great I love God with all my
[25:09] heart and one other thing
[25:12] to of believe us because the devil tried
[25:15] to distract us of our past mistakes you
[25:19] know there's no even a believer canot
[25:21] even sin right you only make mistakes
[25:25] and one thing that sometime people
[25:27] forget
[25:29] there is no such as a small sin or a big
[25:32] sin every Sin is Sin only God's period
[25:37] but
[25:39] sometimes have a white
[25:41] [Music]
[25:43] that's white what I'm trying to say is
[25:45] that when you did that white L you did
[25:50] something mistake that was little tiny
[25:53] in your eyes you went to God and God
[25:56] what forgave you because you thought
[25:59] something small you still ask when the
[26:02] Holy Ghost is in you it will convin you
[26:04] of every little that you do is that
[26:06] right so you ask God and he G you
[26:09] Deliverance but at the same token when
[26:12] you make a big mistake that God for I
[26:16] don't know what kind of
[26:19] to express it here but whatever mistake
[26:23] that you do in future or in the past
[26:26] that in the eyes of people think is so
[26:29] big Sometimes some preachers do some
[26:31] nobody want to talk to them everybody
[26:34] kind get away from them but if God could
[26:37] forgive you for that small thing then he
[26:39] can forgive you for the big one too the
[26:42] same God the same Fai that you have for
[26:46] that little small you got have that same
[26:49] faith for the big that people in

[32:12] last Point God wants I go go and the
[32:15] last point I want to say is that this
[32:18] wicked
[32:19] devil the enemy one of his main
[32:24] Tes one of his
[32:26] devices is to call cause the Believers
[32:29] to distract you he causes
[32:33] distractions that's right I'm not saying
[32:37] that TV is wrong you need to have the T
[32:40] have the balance and was I was going to
[32:44] bring
[32:46] here that's I have this here thisone
[32:51] here when I first came to this country
[32:54] 1995 until 978 only people have
[32:59] and they give it to me my job side but
[33:02] now it's too everybody Village in Africa
[33:06] way they all the grand grand they all
[33:09] have it they start with a good thing but
[33:14] the enemy has been
[33:16] so um has used it and slowly
[33:23] slowly distracting Believers with it you
[33:27] have to wake up even myself I get up in
[33:30] the morning I have
[33:33] um place that I go for like maybe to
[33:36] read some scriptures after I read my
[33:38] Bible some of
[33:40] the once I go to gole to try to find it
[33:44] you see they bring so many news they
[33:47] bring so many
[33:51] sports you right away to read your Bible
[33:56] you don't think your mind just your eyes
[33:58] just goes on those things I have to
[34:00] literally push it aside and go and read
[34:04] my scriptures what I'm trying to say
[34:06] that he's using it as a distraction so
[34:09] you have to know how to use it and when
[34:12] to use it because if he can only
[34:15] distract you he know he can weaken you
[34:19] right so he uses this I'm not saying
[34:22] this bad with the Facebook with the
[34:24] WhatsApp with this and people sending
[34:27] every you go to people even having a
[34:29] dinner they still testing going to a
[34:32] meeting they still testing Adam send
[34:34] some and every time he getting out of
[34:37] hand and the devil is using it without
[34:41] even the people being aware why is he
[34:44] using that because he knew that a
[34:47] Believer will have time quiet time with
[34:50] God spend time with the Lord Jesus
[34:52] Christ they will be what hot potatoes he
[34:55] can't do nothing with you uses those
[34:58] things to distract to what take away
[35:02] your time your precious time that could
[35:06] be used to be of service to the Lord
[35:09] Jesus Christ he's stealing it slowly
[35:12] slowly slowly without you even being
[35:15] aware but God if you want to be able to
[35:21] be a hot potato to be in the presence of
[35:24] God every time in your life so that when
[35:28] you get in this situation either it is
[35:31] bad or good you still going to be able
[35:32] to thank God you have 10 million your
[35:35] account have Z in your account say
[35:38] praise God you got to spend time with
[35:40] your you got to go back to the T you
[35:43] have to listen to those T he said after
[35:45] long gone get into your cool place and
[35:48] listen to those voices have time with
[35:50] the Lord sister read your Bible pray
[35:52] every day don't let the devil steal your
[35:55] joy because he knows that the importance
[35:59] of the believer being in the presence of
[36:02] the king
[36:04] amen if being who just cast everything
[36:07] out and be in the presence you going to
[36:11] be what victorious in Christ so that's
[36:14] one of the P that the enemy is using in
[36:18] the last day to kind of take your joy
[36:21] I'm going to read this
[36:24] go God keeps his word Miss yourself
[36:28] together and have Union
[36:31] revivals get preachers who stays with
[36:34] God's word and not scatter
[36:37] about read the word some of you don't
[36:41] read the word once a week you ought to
[36:45] read chapter after chapter every day
[36:48] meditate if you get your head out of
[36:52] them old magazines and things you are
[36:55] reading and out of this old so many
[36:59] papers and so called religious lit that
[37:03] Ed to never be on the market that's just
[37:07] as bad as reading some of other
[37:10] magazines stuff that is false Doctrine
[37:14] and all kinds of dogmas and basing upon
[37:19] the truth why do can based upon some
[37:22] experience Doctrine is based on God's
[37:25] word not on experience
[37:28] people can have experiences
[37:30] everything so what I'm trying to say is
[37:33] that the T of the
[37:37] enemy is to distract the
[37:40] Believers so we have to spend time with
[37:43] the maker you have to wake up spend time
[37:48] read your Bible pray every seek God face
[37:51] so that you can be have a Victorious
[37:54] life every day in your life Hallelujah
[37:58] amen thank you Lord amen so without
[38:02] further Ado I think I'll bring the
[38:04] service to end and one thing I leave to
[38:08] everyone here is I remember greater is
[38:11] he that is in you he in the
[38:16] worldend your make
