[0:00] You cannot accept Christ because Christ
[0:04] is he is the revelation of God.
[0:08] &gt;&gt; He's God revealed in flesh.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; Therefore, the whole church is built
[0:14] upon divine revelation. Amen.
[0:17] &gt;&gt; So when you know like like THAT'S WHY
[0:19] YOU CAN TALK TO people about the word of
[0:22] God and you know you get into fellowship
[0:24] around the word and you know they they
[0:26] they hold to their trinitarian doctrine
[0:29] and you tell them but you know I believe
[0:31] that if if you you know you know and
[0:33] I've said it many times I believe if if
[0:36] you're sincere in your heart and you
[0:38] know because I see that you're sincere
[0:40] but you're holding on to a trinitarian
[0:42] doctrine of making God three in one.
[0:48] But if you would submit yourself to the
[0:50] Holy Ghost
[0:52] and recognize what is the Holy Ghost,
[0:56] IT'S GOD HIMSELF.
[0:58] &gt;&gt; WHEN JESUS SAID, "I will send you the
[1:01] comforter."
[1:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; Which is the Holy Ghost,
[1:05] &gt;&gt; and he will come in you
[1:08] and guide you into all truth.
[1:12] AND SO THE HOLY GHOST is the spirit of
[1:14] revelation.
[1:15] &gt;&gt; And when revelation comes, it can never
[1:19] deny the word of God.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that.
[1:24] &gt;&gt; And that's why, you know, William
[1:25] Brandham says to, you know, to the to
[1:26] the Baptist, he says, well, you could
[1:28] never accept the Bible then because the
[1:31] Bible is the revelation OF CHRIST.
[1:36] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THEY'LL look at the book of
[1:37] Revelation. Yes.
[1:39] &gt;&gt; The last book in the Bible is THE WHOLE
[1:41] BOOK THAT sums up the complete
[1:44] revelation of God.
[1:48] &gt;&gt; And John was given that so that it could
[1:52] be expressed in word form to tell us
[1:56] what the word was going to produce in
[1:59] every age.
[2:01] Showing us through the seven church ages
[2:03] and the building up of the body.
[2:06] &gt;&gt; And here we are today. in that final
[2:09] age. Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. He
[2:14] came to his own and his own could not
[2:17] receive him. You can look at the next
[2:19] slide.
[2:21] They didn't receive him as a baby. They
[2:23] couldn't receive him as an adult. And
[2:26] many today are saying, "Give me gifts
[2:28] and parties." But unfortunately saying,
[2:30] "Sorry, I got no room for Jesus in my
[2:34] heart."
[2:37] you're a little bit too zealous about
[2:39] Jesus. They'll tell you, you know,
[2:45] but Isaiah 53 said very clearly, he was
[2:49] despised and rejected by men, a man of
[2:53] sorrows, and he was acquainted with
[2:56] grief. Imagine that. He walked
[2:59] throughout this whole
[3:01] 33 years of his life.
[3:05] But yet when he came into his public
[3:08] ministry,
[3:10] &gt;&gt; they rejected him.
[3:12] &gt;&gt; They loved him when he when when he
[3:14] would feed them.
[3:16] &gt;&gt; They loved him when they would when he
[3:17] would heal them. But when he spoke the
[3:20] word,
[3:22] &gt;&gt; he said, "Unless you eat my body and
[3:24] drink my blood,
[3:26] &gt;&gt; you have no part of me."
[3:29] &gt;&gt; You see, he wasn't talking, he wasn't
[3:31] cannibalistic. He wasn't talking about
[3:33] that. He made it very clear. I am the
[3:35] bread that cometh down from heaven.
[3:38] &gt;&gt; He was trying to let the people know
[3:39] that, hey, I'm the word.
[3:42] &gt;&gt; I'm the word for your day.
[3:44] &gt;&gt; That's your message. Did you know that?
[3:46] YOU CAN TELL THE PEOPLE, "HEY, I'm the
[3:48] word for this day.
[3:50] &gt;&gt; I'm the word that's being expressed in
[3:52] IN 2025
[3:54] THAT WANTS YOU TO know what the true
[3:56] meaning of Christmas is all about."
[4:01] &gt;&gt; They couldn't receive him.
[4:04] He was in Nazareth. They and and and
[4:06] they and they rejected him. He came to
[4:08] his own. The very world he had created,
[4:11] the very ones who had received the
[4:13] breath of life that he had given into
[4:16] their nostrils
[4:18] rejected him.
[4:23] And one of the greatest battles
[4:27] at Christmas
[4:30] for people is to make room for Jesus,
[4:34] the word.
[4:37] The true meaning of Christmas.
[4:41] Glory to God.
[4:47] in John,
[4:49] you know, he was in the world. The world
[4:52] loves its own.
[4:54] You want to talk about, you know, the
[4:56] regular Jesus? You want to talk about
[4:58] the one that believes in Santa and that
[5:00] you know that wants to have the Santa
[5:03] Claus plays at church and wants to, you
[5:06] know, uh, you know, commercialize it
[5:08] and, you know, if you talk to Jesus in
[5:10] that way and all the great big parties
[5:13] and all the booze, you know, hey, make
[5:15] sure you Bob Yob, you know, bring your
[5:18] own booze. We're having a big Christmas
[5:20] party, right? Long as you're as long as
[5:22] you're in that category. Oh, they love
[5:24] you. Oh, come to our party, you know,
[5:28] come to our party. But the minute that
[5:31] you want to bring the word
[5:34] &gt;&gt; into their midst, the reality of of of
[5:38] what holiness is all about,
[5:40] &gt;&gt; it's not putting on holiness. But when
[5:42] you've received the Holy Ghost in your
[5:44] life, you can't act that way anymore
[5:49] &gt;&gt; because it's the power of God in you.
[5:51] Remember the Holy Ghost is God's purpose
[5:55] in your life
[5:56] &gt;&gt; to fulfill his word,
[5:59] &gt;&gt; his purpose. That's why when when you
[6:01] receive the Holy Ghost, it's it's a new
[6:04] birth. And and every birth is a mess.
[6:07] &gt;&gt; Your families are not going to Wait a
[6:09] minute. We used to put, you know, all
[6:11] kinds of Christmas ornaments up
[6:14] everywhere and and and you were, you
[6:16] know, you were right there, right there
[6:18] with your bottle of whiskey at every
[6:20] Christmas. and you know you were there
[6:22] partying with us at every Christmas.
[6:24] What's going on here? No, Christmas has
[6:27] become different because you've received
[6:29] the Holy Ghost.
[6:32] &gt;&gt; It brings a whole new life, a whole new
[6:34] purpose, it changes Christmas. I told
[6:36] you this kind of preaching when you
[6:39] understand what Christmas is truly all
[6:41] about, which is the worship of Christ.
[6:44] And you can only worship Christ if you
[6:46] come subject to Christ. And he is the
[6:50] word. Amen.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:52] &gt;&gt; It's all it always comes back to the
[6:53] word.
[6:57] &gt;&gt; In John 15, you can go to
[7:01] slide 11 there. It says, "If ye were of
[7:04] the world, the world would love his
[7:07] own."
[7:10] That's how you know you're not of this
[7:11] world.
[7:13] &gt;&gt; Because you're not loved by everybody.
[7:17] Be glad that you're loved by him. Be
[7:20] glad that you have a family that that
[7:22] that that knows him. That's that's a
[7:24] part of his family
[7:27] &gt;&gt; that loves you according to genuine
[7:32] love.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; Not artificial love. Oh, hi. God bless
[7:37] you. Oh, hi. How are you? And meanwhile,
[7:39] in the back of your mind, you got
[7:40] different thoughts.
[7:43] The birth hasn't happened yet. If that's
[7:45] still going on,
[7:47] you're still you're still struggling
[7:49] with this. You could be birthed and
[7:51] actually still be struggling with those
[7:53] things. I correct myself. You can
[7:56] actually be born again and be struggling
[7:59] with with
[8:02] your brothers and sisters.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; It's just that you haven't died enough.
[8:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says here, "But because ye are
[8:10] not of the world, but I have chosen you
[8:13] out of the world, therefore the world
[8:16] hateth you."
[8:19] &gt;&gt; He chose you. You never chose him.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; People come and say, "What are you
[8:24] doing? You know, giving yourself to this
[8:28] church and giving yourself to the to
[8:30] this cult or, you know, where you where
[8:32] you know, you you're you're you don't
[8:33] come to our events anymore. You're
[8:35] always going to their church services. I
[8:37] don't see you anymore at the New Year's
[8:39] Eve parties, man. Last year we got so
[8:41] drunk. We missed you.
[8:45] &gt;&gt; You can tell THEM I GOT DRUNK TOO
[8:48] &gt;&gt; in the spirit.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; Remember the word that I said unto you,
[8:56] the servant is not greater than his
[8:58] lord. If they have persecuted me, they
[9:01] will also persecute you.
[9:05] If they have kept my saying, they will
[9:08] keep yours also. You see what that's
[9:10] saying? That when when true unity takes
[9:14] place in the Holy Ghost,
[9:17] they'll believe you because they believe
[9:19] the word.
[9:22] They've come subject to the word of God.
[9:25] And when they become subject to the
[9:27] word, all of a sudden, they become
[9:29] subject to you
[9:31] &gt;&gt; because you're a part of the word.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; You're a part of the body. That's what
[9:36] Jesus was talking about here. The
[9:38] servant is not greater than his Lord. We
[9:41] can't be any better than the Lord.
[9:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. But the moment we
[9:48] submit to the Lord and others submit to
[9:51] the Lord, it brings the unity of the
[9:53] body of Jesus Christ.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; It brings you into the true meaning of
[9:58] Christmas.
[10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:02] It gives you the ability to become
[10:06] glory to God.
[10:09] All of a sudden, those few recognized
[10:12] him while they were while Jesus was here
[10:15] and being rejected by the majority. But
[10:18] there was a few that recognized him. He
[10:22] come to Peter. He says, "Peter, who do
[10:23] you say that I am? Thou art the Christ."
[10:26] He recognized. He was the word for for
[10:29] that day. Amen.
[10:31] the son of the living God. He came
[10:35] subject to God. He recognized that God
[10:38] was made flesh. There was just a handful
[10:41] that recognize. Imagine. So don't be
[10:44] thinking that the whole world is going
[10:46] to agree with you when you bring this
[10:48] type of teaching on the word of God
[10:52] on the true meaning of Christmas.
[10:56] only a handful.
[11:00] Yet to all who did receive him, go to
[11:04] the next slide, he gave power to become
[11:09] the sons of God.
[11:11] &gt;&gt; Now, this is where this is where, you
[11:13] know, we get the juice, the meat. Amen.
[11:19] There were a few, not many at first, who
[11:21] risked
[11:23] the insults, the ridicule,
[11:26] being called dreamers, and oh, you're
[11:29] too, you know, you're too religious, you
[11:31] know, you're just you're you're you're
[11:33] too uh you know, uh you're almost like
[11:37] overzealous about Jesus.
[11:41] But the ones that recognized,
[11:43] they did not fear any of that.
[11:48] They were willing to take on the uh and
[11:52] become like radicals
[11:54] because they wanted desperately to
[11:57] understand who they were.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; They were coming into a place where
[12:02] things started to make sense in their
[12:04] lives.
[12:06] &gt;&gt; They started to realize that they didn't
[12:07] have to be, you know, uh under under the
[12:11] conditions that they were under. They
[12:12] had been set free by the word for their
[12:15] day
[12:16] &gt;&gt; because Jesus was the word for their
[12:19] day.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Listen, let's read
[12:23] our scripture here in Colossians
[12:25] 1:26-27.
[12:27] He says, "Even the mystery
[12:30] which hath been hid from ages and from
[12:34] generations,
[12:35] but now is made manifest to his saints."
[12:39] Who are his saints?
[12:41] his children, his sons and daughters.
[12:45] Amen. To whom God would make known what
[12:48] is the riches of the glory of this
[12:51] mystery among the Gentiles,
[12:54] which is what? Christ coming in you
[12:59] &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden now it's the hope of
[13:03] your Christmas.
[13:05] &gt;&gt; It changes Christmas alto together.
[13:07] Amen.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; It places an understanding in your heart
[13:12] that you you know all of a sudden when
[13:14] you hear Jesus and he says that day ye
[13:17] shall know that I am in the father ye in
[13:20] me and I in you. All of a sudden IT JUST
[13:23] STARTS ALL COMING TOGETHER. THE family
[13:26] of God coming back together again
[13:28] because that was his goal from the very
[13:31] beginning. God wanted to become man on
[13:35] earth
[13:37] with his sons and daughters so that he
[13:39] could have a family
[13:42] &gt;&gt; in fellowship
[13:44] and in perfect harmony.
[13:47] &gt;&gt; And that's still his plan.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; That's the meaning of Christmas. That's
[13:52] the purpose why he came. So that he
[13:55] could go back and and and get that
[14:00] portion of eternity that we are so that
[14:04] he could bring it back and give it to
[14:07] you. IT'S CALLED THE POWER TO BECOME.
[14:11] It's called the Holy Ghost in you. Your
[14:13] hope of glory.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. It's a super sign.
[14:19] Let's read the quote here. Oh God, if
[14:21] the world could only see that that God
[14:24] and man are one.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; The super sign was that first man that
[14:30] God could come into. All that God was,
[14:34] he poured into Christ.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; And all Christ he he poured into the
[14:40] church.
[14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's you. The body. Amen. All
[14:46] Christ he poured into the church. Super
[14:48] sign. He says, "Oh, listen. This is this
[14:51] is the sign of this Christmas." Amen.
[14:54] [laughter]
[14:55] You're you're a super sign. He says,
[14:57] "Listen,"
[14:59] he says, "God and man together," that
[15:01] was to be the super sign of the last day
[15:04] when the entire Bible was to be
[15:07] fulfilled in the last day. This is when
[15:10] the whole word comes together.
[15:12] And those that are a part of the word,
[15:15] they're going to see it as clear as a
[15:17] bell. But to them that are lost, it'll
[15:21] they'll just go on with Christmas. They
[15:24] just go on with all their traditions.
[15:27] They'll they'll make no room for Jesus
[15:30] at the table.
[15:33] Amen. But no, he says he says uh that
[15:37] that it'll be fulfilled in the last
[15:38] days, a super sign. And what was a he
[15:41] says a virgin shall conceive and this
[15:44] conception when it's brought forth will
[15:47] be God manifested in flesh. THAT WAS A
[15:50] SUPER SIGN of that day. The Virgin Mary
[15:53] was a super sign of that day because she
[15:56] HAD BEEN GIVEN THE POWER TO BECOME AND
[15:59] TO BRING FORTH the word in her day.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; A SUPER SIGN. THEY STILL don't believe
[16:07] it, but it was anyhow. It's still a
[16:12] super sign. There's a people on earth
[16:15] that have received the angel of the Lord
[16:19] through the opening of the word. They've
[16:21] received their prophet. Amen. That's
[16:23] restored the word back to them. And what
[16:26] have they said? Be it unto me like the
[16:29] Virgin Mary. Be it unto me according to
[16:32] thy word. Amen. Go to the next slide. He
[16:35] says, "Notice super sign. They've got
[16:38] Superman today. They've got fictitious
[16:41] fictions of Superman. All these other
[16:44] kinds of super things. But the church
[16:46] has got a super sign. God back in the
[16:50] church.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; Manifested in human flesh.
[16:56] &gt;&gt; God united with man. His sure super
[16:59] sign. Notice the eternal sign. An
[17:02] unfailing sign. It will never fail. Why?
[17:05] It's the word and man become one.
[17:11] &gt;&gt; That's the meaning of Christmas.
[17:13] &gt;&gt; Christ wants Listen, THE CHRIST OF 2,000
[17:17] years ago when he was born as a baby in
[17:19] a manger, that's not our message.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; That's not the the the the super sign in
[17:28] our day.
[17:30] Amen.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; That was Christ coming to the earth to
[17:33] the people of that day to fulfill his
[17:36] word according to Isaiah that a virgin
[17:39] shall conceive. Unto us a son is given.
[17:43] His name shall be the counselor, the
[17:45] prince of peace, the mighty God. It's
[17:47] all right there in that one scripture.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; God is one.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; He was the son. He was the comforter. He
[17:55] was the counselor.
[17:58] The everlasting father,
[18:00] &gt;&gt; THE PRINCE OF PEACE,
[18:03] &gt;&gt; THE MIGHTY GOD.
[18:06] &gt;&gt; Only one.
[18:07] &gt;&gt; THERE'S ONLY ONE.
[18:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; Do you see? You see now? Now, do you
[18:11] understand Christmas a little better?
[18:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[18:14] &gt;&gt; This is what Christmas is really all
[18:16] about.
[18:18] &gt;&gt; Understanding that, let's read on. He
[18:20] says here, "When God's word and man
[18:22] become one, as St. John the first
[18:24] chapter says in the beginning was the
[18:26] word and the word was with God and the
[18:28] word was God and the word was made flesh
[18:31] and dwelt among us. That's the super
[18:34] sign
[18:35] &gt;&gt; that the word was made flesh and dwelt
[18:37] among us.
[18:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, if that was the super sign of
[18:41] that day
[18:42] &gt;&gt; when the same spirit that was on JESUS
[18:45] CHRIST COMES INTO his church
[18:48] &gt;&gt; to manifest the written word for today.
[18:51] That is still the super sign.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. That's the word
[18:57] that we're preaching here this morning.
[19:00] &gt;&gt; THIS IS CHRISTMAS.
[19:02] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE POWER TO BECOME.
[19:05] &gt;&gt; This is the element of the word that
[19:07] THAT THAT THAT THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING
[19:09] in our lives. It delivered you from your
[19:12] oppression. It deliver and it continues
[19:14] to deliver you from your depression. It
[19:17] continues to deliver you from BROKEN
[19:19] RELATIONSHIPS. IT CONTINUES to deliver
[19:21] you from health issues.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; What is a health issue? Whether it's A
[19:26] CANCER OR WHETHER IT'S A minor cold in
[19:30] the name of Jesus.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; I am the LORD GOD THAT HEALTH ALL.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; All he didn't he didn't name them cancer
[19:38] this that. No, HE SAID ALL.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN CLAIM Christmas totally healed
[19:45] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE'S GIVEN YOU THE POWER TO
[19:47] BECOME.
[19:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU CAN BE HEALED. YOU CAN BE
[19:50] RESTORED. YOU CAN BE REFRESHED. YOU CAN
[19:52] BE REFILLED. You can have a a new start.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; What do you need this morning?
[20:00] &gt;&gt; He's given you a GIFT THAT GOES BEYOND
[20:02] WHAT YOU COULD EVEN POSSIBLY IMAGINE.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; Are you WILLING TO RECEIVE THAT GIFT?
[20:08] &gt;&gt; Receive the gift.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Listen uh in
[20:14] Ephesians next slide he says here and
[20:16] hath put all things under his feet and
[20:21] gave him to be the head over all things
[20:24] to the church
[20:26] &gt;&gt; all things
[21:08] He says here, he says, uh, um, see down
[21:12] through the ages, we started off from
[21:14] the foundation from the first church age
[21:17] when the seed went in the ground, the
[21:19] complete seed. Then it come up through
[21:22] the feet. He's talking about the body
[21:24] here. Amen. Luther come back out then
[21:27] through Wesley then into Pentecostals
[21:30] the tongues in the lips. See now it's in
[21:34] the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4. Brother
[21:37] Brandham was talking about his his time
[21:40] his season. But that prophetic ministry
[21:42] is upon you. IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN PASSED
[21:45] DOWN UNTO YOU BECAUSE the lamb came down
[21:49] so that he could come and and and unite
[21:52] with you. So now you've got the fullness
[21:55] of the word. Amen. You've got the
[21:57] fullness. And he goes on and SO FORTH.
[21:59] AND NOW THERE'S NOTHING else left for it
[22:02] to come but him himself TO STEP INTO
[22:06] THAT CUZ THAT'S THE LAST THING THERE IS.
[22:09] WHAT IS HE STEPPING INTO? You and me.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that we can be the super
[22:15] sign in this in this age. Amen. So that
[22:18] we can display Christmas to the people.
[22:21] Glory to God. He says here in the next
[22:24] slide, he says the next is the
[22:25] intelligence and we have no intelligence
[22:28] of our own.
[22:30] Don't put your own interpretation on the
[22:32] word of God.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; God says, "MY WORD IS OF NO PRIVATE
[22:36] INTERPRETATION. I'M GOING TO interpret
[22:38] it. I'm going to send it. I'm going to
[22:41] raise up a people. THEY'RE GOING TO HEAR
[22:43] MY WORD. THEY'RE going to recognize my
[22:45] word. when they recognize it, they're
[22:47] going to come into the limelight to say,
[22:50] "This is the word for this day. I am the
[22:53] interpretation of Christmas in 2025."
[22:56] Hallelujah. Which is Christ in me, the
[22:58] hope of glory. Amen. I'VE GOT THE VOICE.
[23:02] I'VE GOT THE WORD. I'VE GOT THE THE THE
[23:04] living God that's that's infilling me.
[23:07] Amen. He says, "How can a man foresee
[23:09] these things? He can't do it. It's God
[23:12] himself." See, it's becoming to a place
[23:14] and he's governed the body all the way
[23:18] through. Then the complete body of
[23:21] Christ is revealed in the form of a
[23:24] bride,
[23:25] &gt;&gt; which is what the the the bride is
[23:27] always known as the church. Amen. That
[23:30] was taken out of his side like Adam did
[23:33] at the beginning. Like Adam was rather
[23:36] at the beginning. Where did Eve come
[23:39] from?
[23:40] &gt;&gt; The side of Adam. WHERE'S GOD'S
[23:43] [screaming] BRIDE? GOD'S WIFE. WHERE IS
[23:45] SHE SEATED?
[23:48] &gt;&gt; At his right side. At his at his side.
[23:50] Amen. They two shall be one.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; You see the whole plan was at the
[23:55] beginning God when he created Adam in
[23:58] his image. He He made He made him male
[24:01] and female. Made them male and female
[24:04] and called their name Jesus.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[24:10] THE FIRST ADAM FELL, BUT THE SECOND ADAM
[24:13] WENT TO CALVARY
[24:16] &gt;&gt; TO CREATE A WAY BACK FOR HIS WIFE TO
[24:19] COME INTO HIM.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Glory to God. Here we're winding
[24:25] down here. Uh just go to the next slide
[24:29] here. In Ephesians it says, "For no man
[24:32] ever yet hated his own flesh, but
[24:36] nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as
[24:39] the Lord the church." Where are you
[24:42] getting your nourishment? Where are you
[24:45] getting your strength? Where are you
[24:47] getting your love? Where where where's
[24:50] your confidence, saints? Who's who's
[24:53] your encourager? It's the word. Amen.
[24:56] Even the Lord, the church. For we are
[24:59] members of his body and of his flesh and
[25:02] of his bones. Amen. We are the literal
[25:05] body of Christ in bride form. Son of man
[25:10] being revealed in bride form in these
[25:14] last days.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; NEXT SCRIPTURE IN CORINTHIANS. NOW YE
[25:21] ARE THE BODY of Christ and members in
[25:24] particular.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; There's a scripture I'm not making this
[25:28] up. I'M SHOWING YOU FROM THE word of God
[25:30] who you are. Amen. Glory to God. In
[25:33] modern events made by made clear by a
[25:36] vindicated prophecy, he says, "And so
[25:38] will the church come through
[25:40] justification, sanctification, baptism
[25:43] of the Holy Ghost, restoration of the
[25:45] gifts, right on into the formed image of
[25:49] Christ."
[25:50] Christ is the bridegroom and the church
[25:54] is the bride and the bride is a part of
[25:57] the bridegroom.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They are one. That day
[26:02] you're going to know that he's in you
[26:04] &gt;&gt; and that you're in him.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. In Christ, the
[26:09] mystery of God revealed and his church
[26:11] stands alone.
[26:15] &gt;&gt; SHE IS NOT HOOKED WITH NOTHING.
[26:18] WE'RE NOT GOING TO CONNECT with the
[26:20] Christmas of of of this modern age.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; No, sir. THIS IS CHRISTMAS.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; THIS AND to you who believe, HE'S GIVEN
[26:28] YOU THE POWER TO BECOME.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; HE'S GIVEN YOU THE POWER TO OVERCOME.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE AGE. DON'T WORRY
[26:36] ABOUT THE THE THE THE THE pressures that
[26:38] are going to come to you from friends
[26:39] and family. NO, SIR. SHE IS NOT HOOKED
[26:43] WITH NOTHING. BUT HE WAS IDENTIFIED by
[26:46] God being the body that God dwelt in.
[26:49] And the CHURCH IS IDENTIFIED BY HIS BODY
[26:52] DOING the same thing. SHE IS HIS BODY,
[26:56] THE MANIFESTED truth of his promised
[27:00] word for the last days. And she and she
[27:04] alone stands by it.
[27:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Let the musicians
[27:11] come. Praise God. Listen, Jesus came as
[27:14] a baby, not just to surprise us, though
[27:18] surprise us it did. And not as a
[27:21] disguise, though we certainly didn't
[27:23] recognize him. Jesus came as a baby
[27:26] precisely because every new life begins
[27:29] with a birth.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; And you're going to need that same birth
[27:35] to understand the true meaning of
[27:36] Christmas. Hallelujah.
[27:39] Glory to God. And and in his case, it
[27:42] was a miraculous birth.
[27:45] It was it was a miracle.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was without the aid of a human.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; God sent an angel
[27:54] &gt;&gt; and said, "Mary, you're blessed.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you today, church, YOU'RE
[28:01] BLESSED.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE RECEIVED AN ANGEL." HALLELUJAH.
[28:05] IT WASN'T BY HUMAN HANDS. YOUR BIRTH IS
[28:08] NOT SOMETHING SOMEBODY CAN, OH COME TO
[28:10] MY CHURCH. YOU'LL YOU'RE THIS IS WHERE
[28:12] YOU need to come.
[28:15] YOU MIGHT COME, BUT IF YOU DON'T HEAR,
[28:18] you're going to go.
[28:21] &gt;&gt; But if you're sheep,
[28:23] &gt;&gt; you're going to listen. You're going to
[28:25] hear. You're going to recognize. You're
[28:28] going to manifest. A sheep doesn't
[28:31] doesn't try to put on wool. A A SHEEP
[28:34] JUST AUTOMATICALLY BRINGS FORTH and
[28:36] produces wool. IT'LL AUTOMATICALLY
[28:39] PRODUCE THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN.
[28:42] It won't be through some human aid
[28:45] because he was the son of God. But our
[28:48] new life in Christ begins with a new
[28:50] birth just as miraculous. I don't know
[28:53] about you, but I know that this was a
[28:55] miracle in my life.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; I stand here by a miracle. Amen.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; That I can see this word. Recognize the
[29:04] word that's been MADE FLESH IN MY DAY.
[29:08] HALLELUJAH.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; THAT'S BECAUSE THE POWER TO BECOME THE
[29:12] HOLY GHOST IN YOU gives you the ability
[29:15] to recognize the word for your day.
[29:17] Amen. That's the same way. Amen. Glory
[29:20] to God. Listen, verse 13 says, "He gave
[29:23] us the power to become children born of
[29:27] NA NO NOT OUT OF natural
[29:30] descent.
[29:32] You're not the son or daughter of your
[29:35] mom and dad. Naturally, you are, but
[29:37] you're a son or daughter of God.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; BEFORE YOU WERE A SON IN THIS WORLD, YOU
[29:43] WERE A SON OR DAUGHTER BACK THERE."
[29:46] &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS THE REALITY OF CHRISTMAS.
[29:48] This is what the word does for us. Amen.
[29:51] It brings us back the same way that he
[29:53] was born. This is the very good news. We
[29:56] have the power to overcome
[29:59] by believing his word. Be it unto me.
[30:03] And now as his sons and daughters, we
[30:06] recognize him and we receive him. As we
[30:09] recognize him, we can recognize who we
[30:12] are. And I can recognize who you are.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
[30:20] I'm just going to close here in a word
[30:22] of prayer.
[30:24] Amen. [music] The prophet prayed back in
[30:28] 1964.
[30:30] I came across this and I said, "Lord,
[30:34] this is a prayer that pertains to right
[30:38] now, to this church, to us." And he goes
[30:42] and he says, "Heavenly Father, bow your
[30:44] head, saints. Heavenly Father, we are
[30:47] grateful to see the risen Messiah.
[30:52] 2,000 [music]
[30:53] years ago, all kinds of theology and
[30:56] movements, but still in the darkness of
[30:59] it all, you promised that you would
[31:00] appear here in the last days in this
[31:03] Sodom day where the world is falling
[31:06] apart. And you would make yourself known
[31:08] to the children of Abraham, the called,
[31:11] the elected. And here you are tonight,
[31:15] this afternoon, after 2,000 years. You
[31:18] are just as much alive this afternoon as
[31:21] you were when you talked TO THE WOMAN AT
[31:23] the well.
[31:27] It's God manifested in flesh, now in
[31:31] flesh of his bride. For the bride and
[31:35] the husband is the selfsame flesh. These
[31:39] two are one and the church is becoming
[31:41] the bride all the time by believing the
[31:45] word. So that the word and the church
[31:48] becomes the same. The word in the church
[31:52] making it the bride the last sign. God
[31:57] identifying himself the word in the
[32:01] church.
[32:03] Oh blessed
[32:06] God, Jehovah God, our Lord and Savior
[32:09] Jesus Christ. Lord, may this Christmas,
[32:12] Lord, may it be uh like never before.
[32:16] Father, may this word so manifest in our
[32:19] lives, Father, that as we go and we rub
[32:22] with the world and as we display the
[32:24] meaning of Christmas in our lives, Lord,
[32:27] may it bring light. May it bring a a a
[32:30] joy unspeakable. May it bring something,
[32:34] Lord, that the world did not expect that
[32:37] maybe a friend or a family member would
[32:40] would just say, "Oh, now I understand
[32:42] Christmas. Now I see what IT'S ALL
[32:45] ABOUT. NOW I can recognize how to become
[32:49] an overcomer. How to become a son or a
[32:52] daughter [music] of God. Granted, Lord,
[32:55] bless your people. Father, as we gather
[32:58] at our Christmas tables, oh God, may you
[33:00] be the invisible guest at that table.
[33:03] And may we rejoice and give you praise
[33:06] and glory [music] and honor.
[33:09] Lord, we love you. We appreciate you.
[33:16] Have your way in each and every one of
[33:18] [music] our lives.
[33:21] And Lord, as we now
[33:24] move into the
[33:27] order of the service where the young
[33:29] people will be Sunday school [music]
[33:31] will be bringing a play. Father, Lord,
[33:34] may you reflect through that play the
[33:37] word
[33:39] that was brought forth today. Father,
[33:42] may it vindicate your word. [music] May
[33:45] it become a reality to the people. May
[33:47] they realize, Father, this is Christmas.
[33:53] Blessed be your wonderful name.
[33:57] In Jesus Christ's name.
[34:00] Oh, joy to the world, the Lord has come.
[34:07] Let earth [singing]
[34:09] [music] receive
[34:11] her king.
[34:14] Let every [music] heart
[34:17] repair.
[34:20] And heaven and [music] nature sing.
[34:24] And heaven and nature sing.
[34:28] Heaven
[34:29] [music]
[34:30] and natures.
[34:33] Oh yes. Joy to the [music] world.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; [music]
[34:50] [music]
[34:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, [singing] we need a song.
[34:59] [music]
[35:06] Joy [music] to the world.
[35:11] and let her
[35:13] receive [music]
[35:15] her king.
[35:18] Let every heart [music] prepare
[35:23] his room.
[35:30] [music]
[35:36] [music] Oh [singing] no.
[35:41] [music]
[35:48] [music]
[35:49] He come to me. His blessings.
[35:56] [music]
[36:05] [music]
[36:08] For [singing] he rules the world
[36:12] and place [music]
[36:14] and make
[36:20] [music] the glory of his rightousness.
[36:25] [music]
[36:29] Oh,
[36:34] [music]
[36:38] joy to the world. Joy [music]
[36:40] to the world.
[36:45] Oh,
[36:47] see
[36:51] [music]
[36:55] [singing] you.
[36:58] [music]
[37:00] Oh, and heaven and angels sing. [music]
[37:10] Hallelujah.
[37:12] How many [music] enjoy the word today?
[37:15] Give us the power to become like him.
[37:16] Amen.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; So, at this time, I know we have a a
[37:19] play that's coming up and um there's a
[37:22] couple of refreshments for the people
[37:23] for [music] a little bit. We're going to

[37:29] leave and have some refreshments. They
[37:31] get to set the stage and then we come
[37:33] back in probably about 20 minutes. Half
[37:35] an hour probably
