[28:02] [Music]
[28:10] that was wonderful praise the Lord God
[28:13] bless you thank God for you being here
[28:16] on this one this wonderful night amen
[28:20] it's a night of uh fog on the outside
[28:23] that's what led you see us anyway and we
[28:27] are here tonight to worship and praise
[28:29] the name of the Lord God bless you all
[28:31] thank you so much sister God bless you
[28:33] praise God we are it's just a joy in my
[28:38] heart to be here gathered together with
[28:41] you in the presence of the Lord
[28:43] you see we had just caught in these
[28:47] dimensions of time we say heaven but
[28:51] it's almost like uh you know there's
[28:54] just we are just here and the other
[28:57] level is up here
[28:59] oh praise God one step amen and you can
[29:04] cross over
[29:06] you can cross over alive look around
[29:08] like brother Branham did and God says
[29:10] well you got to go back you have more
[29:12] work to do praise the Lord than he did
[29:15] praise God and he told us what happened
[29:19] when he was over there so we know that
[29:23] what we have received is not uh the
[29:26] thoughts of a man
[29:29] it's not something man-made and the
[29:33] Vindication of it Supernatural
[29:35] Vindication of it
[29:37] independent of the Prophet or the
[29:40] presence of the prophet in certain
[29:42] situations and things that took place he
[29:46] was he's not even around and the
[29:49] supernatural events are still following
[29:53] this message
[29:54] so then we know that this is beyond the
[29:58] prophet it's more than the prophet it's
[30:01] God almighty
[30:03] he's just using his word as a means of
[30:07] of the white horse rider is traveling on
[30:10] the word and we come because we love him
[30:14] and we worship Him
[30:17] he tried to get people to believe that
[30:20] he is in this upper Dimension that they
[30:23] can't see feel hair taste or whatever
[30:25] Hallelujah under rejected they reject
[30:29] him because they can't see him they
[30:32] can't hear his voice because he can
[30:35] speak as loud over there and we can't
[30:38] hear over here unless we've been given
[30:41] receptors to hear and to pick that up
[30:44] and so the mass of human being living on
[30:49] this realm
[30:51] they reject the fact that there's this
[30:54] real person and to others they believe
[30:58] it temporarily then it starts to become
[31:00] like fiction and blacks come like
[31:03] ordinary and they get you know used to
[31:06] it but we continue with a firm faith
[31:11] not because we're trying to work
[31:14] ourselves up in a faith
[31:16] but I'm just talking because this is how
[31:19] I feel this is what I see the fact is
[31:22] brother sister that uh this has always
[31:26] been real to me maybe to you
[31:30] uh it's real it wasn't a guess praise
[31:34] God hallelujah uh sometimes you believe
[31:38] it almost as you want to say uh to the
[31:41] extreme as Solomon said be not over much
[31:45] righteous that you've gone you know
[31:47] you're falling on the other side but
[31:49] keep your balance and walk in line with
[31:52] the word of God
[31:54] but the main thing is that you always
[31:57] are something strange you knew it was
[32:01] strange strange about you strange about
[32:05] certain people you might meet but you
[32:09] know you were different you you can't
[32:12] explain it you don't know what it was or
[32:15] if something following you all the time
[32:18] praise the Lord feeling even if you're
[32:20] alone that there's another presence with
[32:23] you praise God brother sister when you
[32:26] begin to recognize the reality of the
[32:30] other world and the other worldliness of
[32:34] this world the reality of it praise God
[32:38] it gives you such a courage such a faith
[32:42] praise God waiting to serve God's
[32:45] purpose glorify him amen so let's work
[32:48] till Jesus comes
[32:50] let's work till Jesus comes because he
[32:55] has come and physically he's coming
[32:57] again praise God so let's trust in him
[33:01] and believe is the promise of his word
[33:04] Isaiah
[33:05] chapter 53
[33:07] verses 1 to 5
[33:11] and tonight uh being in church I know
[33:16] this may sound funny strange to some
[33:20] simplistic to others but I just like to
[33:22] tell you a story
[33:26] and I trust that God will uh bless it to
[33:30] your heart and to your life praise the
[33:33] Lord if you have Isaiah 53 up there we
[33:38] will read it together
[33:40] and then beloved short brief prayer and
[33:44] then we'll go into the word of God
[33:47] praise the Lord
[33:49] Hallelujah
[33:51] who hath believed our report
[33:54] and to whom is the arm
[33:57] of the Lord reveal your arm is what you
[34:01] use to move things of course that's the
[34:03] word Jesus amen praise the Lord for he
[34:07] all of a sudden it changes to a person
[34:10] for he shall grow up before him
[34:16] as a tender plant tree by the river and
[34:20] as a root out of dry ground he had no
[34:25] form nor comeliness when we shall see
[34:29] him
[34:30] when we shall see him when the human
[34:34] breathes sees him he has no form no
[34:38] comliness
[34:40] and when we shall see him there is no
[34:43] Beauty
[34:45] that we should desire nothing attractive
[34:51] nothing to attract your senses uh you
[34:54] know see touch peace you know those
[34:57] things
[34:58] he is despised and rejected of man
[35:03] a Man of Sorrows
[35:06] and acquainted with grief
[35:09] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[35:14] he was despised
[35:17] and we esteemed him not we didn't see
[35:20] any value
[35:22] in him nothing valuable about this
[35:27] and I thought so at one time right you
[35:31] have the feeling there is something but
[35:33] it wasn't of any real big value praise
[35:37] the Lord surely
[35:39] he had borne our griefs and carried our
[35:44] sorrows yet we did esteem him
[35:48] stricken smitten of God and afflicted
[35:55] but he was wounded for our
[35:58] transgressions
[36:00] he was bruised for our iniquities
[36:04] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[36:08] him
[36:09] and with his stripes
[36:12] we are healed thanks be to God
[36:16] hallelujah gracious Heavenly Father
[36:20] we thank you for the reading of Thy word
[36:23] now we pray you'll grant us faith
[36:27] by your hearing of the word
[36:31] and you receive all the glory and all
[36:34] the praise in the name of Jesus Christ
[36:37] amen God bless you please be seated
[36:41] foreign
[36:45] if this should have a topic we'll just
[36:48] call it a Christmas parable
[36:51] a Christmas spiral
[36:53] you know of course that Jesus spoke in
[36:56] parables
[36:58] matter of fact the Bible says and
[37:00] without the parably spoke not right he
[37:04] always spoke in Parables uh in a simple
[37:09] words we see uh brother Branham came on
[37:14] the scene
[37:15] and he himself said unveiling of the
[37:19] Mighty God
[37:20] 's appropriate gifts and a few other
[37:24] places where he also a lot of people
[37:27] don't think so but he spoke in parables
[37:32] now uh you'll say well brother Simon
[37:36] what is a parable
[37:39] and I checked the Oxford Dictionary
[37:43] a parable is a story
[37:46] that points to some moral
[37:51] some Morrow
[37:53] back there
[37:55] according to Dr
[37:57] FM Club
[38:01] a parable is a short narrative or story
[38:06] right under which some important truths
[38:12] is veiled or hidden
[38:18] and to be unveiled I'm just putting that
[38:21] is to be unveiled but there is a truth
[38:26] hidden in that what appears to be a
[38:30] Simple Story
[38:32] there is a truth in there to be unveiled
[38:37] so here
[38:38] we find brother Branham saying now he
[38:42] says I have to speak in a parable here
[38:47] today I have to speak in a parable right
[38:51] you see because this is Leo this year
[38:56] and it is a fitting time
[38:59] Hallelujah for him to speak in a parable
[39:03] you see why it's coming down to the time
[39:07] now when things are going to come where
[39:11] the opening of the word will come to go
[39:15] to the elect Hallelujah and uh the rest
[39:20] will not understand
[39:22] they'll be blinded or they won't hear it
[39:26] they won't understand it the same
[39:29] pattern with Jesus a certain time of his
[39:32] ministry he's preaching he's preaching
[39:34] he's preaching then he gets to this
[39:35] point and he tells them a simple story
[39:40] and he said Master how is it we
[39:42] understand but they don't understand
[39:45] what we're saying amen he says because
[39:49] unto you it's given to know the mystery
[39:53] of the Kingdom you see he says I spoke
[39:56] to them in parables
[39:59] deliberately as the prophet said again
[40:02] uh in unveiling of God he says uh I I
[40:06] spoke in Parables deliberately he says
[40:10] what God do a thing like that he has
[40:12] done it he is doing it and he will do it
[40:15] yet
[40:15] right because it's it's geared for some
[40:19] to go out
[40:21] some to come in
[40:24] others to be left wondering what's going
[40:28] on see but that's the reason why he
[40:31] spoke in Parables because the elect will
[40:35] pierce through all of that and go Beyond
[40:39] the Veil
[40:41] and they will receive what God has
[40:45] transmitted to them without it going out
[40:49] to Satan and his crowd
[40:52] so we are thankful to God that he has
[40:55] brought us to this place
[40:57] where he is able to hide himself in
[41:01] simplicity
[41:02] and every day it seems to be growing
[41:06] simpler
[41:07] and simpler and simpler and then after a
[41:12] while it appears like it's nothing what
[41:15] is he talking about when I say he what's
[41:18] the prophet talking about and it'll come
[41:20] right down to me then it'll come right
[41:22] down to you what are you really talking
[41:25] about because it goes into simplicity
[41:31] but God is doing that
[41:33] that he might protect his gifts
[41:37] is that right
[41:39] at that point I don't know he was
[41:42] looking through time but at that point
[41:44] he was talking about that gift that was
[41:48] in him that was to be used for the glory
[41:51] of God and saying that God was
[41:55] protecting that gift all the time but at
[41:59] the same time we know it also reflects
[42:02] that every true gift of God God's giving
[42:06] you gift uh praise God I'm not talking
[42:09] about just the nine gifts of the Spirit
[42:11] uh there but I'm talking about the gift
[42:15] of eternal life I'm talking about God's
[42:18] gift to you and me praise God and God
[42:22] wants to protect that Hallelujah and
[42:25] many times through our youths through
[42:27] our childhood we were protected but we
[42:31] didn't know it
[42:32] amen and often time when he takes us
[42:35] back down memory lane or we realize that
[42:40] there was something Supernatural there
[42:42] or I would have been dead I would have
[42:46] been in an accident uh this would have
[42:49] happened that would have happened but
[42:51] thank God he brought me out and I'm here
[42:53] today by the grace of God hallelujah and
[42:57] I believe his word praise God Amen
[43:00] praise His Wonderful Name Hallelujah so
[43:03] you see he he protect his gift
[43:08] because it's true that he was to
[43:13] identify himself
[43:15] Hallelujah why God protect his gifts
[43:18] because he's going to use those gifts to
[43:22] identify him
[43:23] [Music]
[43:24] just as much as John the gift of John
[43:29] the Baptist was used to identify the
[43:33] word him praise God and at the same time
[43:37] while John was identifying him it was
[43:42] vindicating and John and also personally
[43:46] giving John an assurance that you are
[43:50] who you realize you are but I'm letting
[43:54] you know for sure you are exactly that
[43:56] what you are Hallelujah because that's
[43:59] the reason why you saw the word that's
[44:02] the reason why you could identify that
[44:04] that's the word and now the word is
[44:07] turning around to identify you
[44:09] hallelujah praise be to God we are
[44:12] thankful that we are one with the father
[44:16] so he protects the gifts that it might
[44:20] you see and uh he deliberately do it
[44:24] that way and put this I know he's
[44:27] talking in a way but I clearly
[44:29] understand what he's saying but he
[44:31] allowed he's put this speaking in
[44:33] Parables as a stumbling block in their
[44:37] way see put it as a stumbling locked in
[44:41] their way but let me tell you in this
[44:45] lab this year it's the fitting time
[44:49] he repeats it remember that is right it
[44:55] is fitting for this day Hallelujah that
[44:59] God spoke in Parables and he's letting
[45:02] him now also speak in Parables amen
[45:07] hallelujah and that's the reason God has
[45:10] protected it he will protect it I tell
[45:14] you until his purpose is served amen
[45:19] praise God hallelujah he'll do that with
[45:22] any gift protect it until their Earthly
[45:25] Service uh to him for him is serve for
[45:29] his glory and honor he says now let me
[45:34] tell you a story
[45:37] praise God
[45:38] amen and I'm going to retell that story
[45:43] the best I can for the glory of God
[45:47] not long ago
[45:51] there in the great city of New York
[45:55] it was on a Christmas Eve and that's why
[45:59] I called this a Christmas Parable right
[46:03] amen
[46:05] and there was a very poor family
[46:11] the daddy
[46:13] had TB
[46:19] and the wife also
[46:22] had tuberculosis
[46:26] they had been underprivileged
[46:30] and he was so weakly
[46:33] but being a man he still went out
[46:36] looking for work
[46:39] God help those able-bodied men that give
[46:42] up and don't go out and look for a job
[46:45] and sit down and cry about it no matter
[46:48] what the situation is we found out this
[46:52] man knew he was a man and he had to work
[46:56] to maintain his family amen just I mean
[47:01] just like Jesus knew he had to go to the
[47:03] Cross even though you were going to die
[47:05] because there's a bride has to be taken
[47:07] care of Amen see now
[47:12] he was so weekly and so nobody would
[47:16] hire him
[47:18] he had no education
[47:21] none whatsoever
[47:23] and the people didn't want him
[47:27] so was Jesus
[47:30] Isaiah 53 despised
[47:33] rejected of men nobody wanted him
[47:37] whatsoever listened
[47:40] remember
[47:41] he was just an outcast so was Jesus
[47:48] and he become a in the street
[47:52] amen
[47:54] and so was Jesus
[47:56] you know what a is today we call
[47:59] them by different names homeless we call
[48:01] them bad people we got different
[48:03] terminologies for for a but you
[48:06] know back then when they talk about a
[48:09] is somebody that you just went
[48:12] around the city slept in the streets or
[48:14] did jump on a train and end up in
[48:16] another city and somehow try to live
[48:21] right and today uh as it was you know in
[48:27] a day when Jesus was there we have a lot
[48:30] of
[48:30] tramps beggars in the streets if you
[48:34] haven't noticed it I notice it
[48:37] all over the city they're everywhere
[48:40] everywhere
[48:42] now but there are real tramps
[48:46] and there are a lot of fake tramps
[48:49] and I'm telling you because I I actually
[48:53] know of somebody that was living that
[48:56] kind of a life and and they got out of
[48:59] it but they were saying that it's it's
[49:01] it's very like a narcotic because they
[49:04] can make so many hundred dollars a day
[49:07] uh without going to a regular job and in
[49:11] a week they can make uh over a thousand
[49:15] two thousand depends and so therefore uh
[49:20] and that time that part they're not in
[49:23] the church here so don't look around
[49:24] thinking it's somebody I'm talking about
[49:26] here
[49:28] now
[49:30] there's no Trump here
[49:33] praise the Lord anyway
[49:38] um God changed that person's life but
[49:40] the point is they're saying it's easy
[49:44] for somebody to fall into that trap
[49:47] right and so be aware of it and I am
[49:51] aware of it when I'm out there there's
[49:52] fake traps and there's real traps how
[49:55] are you going to know the real well God
[49:57] and you will have to make a judgment of
[49:59] your own at that time and you decide for
[50:02] yourself it don't make any difference if
[50:05] they think you they're deceiving you and
[50:07] that sort of thing they'll have to
[50:09] answer to the Lord if God had put it in
[50:12] your heart to give and that person
[50:14] happened to be fake don't worry about
[50:16] that don't even go back looking for them
[50:18] leave them alone God will work it out if
[50:22] it's a true and you give him the
[50:24] person that be really in need
[50:27] amen
[50:29] now
[50:31] you know how what Trump will do this is
[50:34] a real one it'll pick up something
[50:37] pedal it sell it get what he can
[50:41] see try to make a little profit on it uh
[50:45] he says royalty here but I'm just uh
[50:48] bringing it up for you to have Clarity
[50:51] all right amen see to make it he's just
[50:56] trying to live and to get by
[51:00] now this trip or if you want to call him
[51:05] this little Peddler living on living out
[51:09] there on the street now you may buy some
[51:13] pins some needles
[51:15] and symbols whatever you can and maybe
[51:19] buy for a
[51:21] buy for a buck so much for a pack and
[51:25] sell them for
[51:27] a higher amount amen and maybe uh in one
[51:33] day he'll make a Great Commission just
[51:36] think of it all he'd sell in a day amen
[51:40] and when he ended up might be 20 30 but
[51:44] ever since now it's dollars
[51:48] but he had a family
[51:51] and he had to do it by the way I know of
[51:55] a man like that
[51:56] actually that used to just go around
[51:59] picking up uh you know uh picking up
[52:04] first of all he started picking up
[52:05] sticks and selling them as firewood
[52:09] um and then he bought tread and he
[52:12] bought timbals needles he starts selling
[52:14] them selling them I'll make it short the
[52:18] man is now a multi-millionaire
[52:23] his sons have studied in England and in
[52:26] America and their doctors and their
[52:28] lawyers and everything else
[52:30] and uh he's actually moved he died and
[52:34] most of the family moved over here in
[52:37] the Canada some are in Toronto one
[52:40] brother is back home holding the
[52:43] Holdings that are uh back there because
[52:45] they ended up or he ended up owning a
[52:50] trucking industry that spanned the
[52:52] entire country
[52:54] and I am a witness to that because he
[52:57] was living right next door
[53:00] right next door
[53:02] and I'm a witness to that so this is a
[53:05] story but yet it's not just a story
[53:08] it's the reality of the lives of people
[53:12] who are ready to get up and go and to
[53:15] believe what God can do for them
[53:19] Hallelujah
[53:21] no
[53:24] that little wife was at home and she
[53:27] also was weekly
[53:30] and being weak one day she up and died
[53:36] and he was left
[53:38] with their little girl
[53:42] well it was coming on to Christmas time
[53:46] and the little girl because of their
[53:50] poverty and their situation
[53:54] she had developed malnutrition you know
[53:57] that's easy malnutrition
[54:00] not having the right Foods at home she
[54:05] developed malnutrition
[54:08] and
[54:09] she also took TB also well you know
[54:15] that's what happened to the true elect
[54:18] of God within the household of the
[54:22] Church of God that because they couldn't
[54:25] be fed with the right food and they
[54:28] couldn't take in or what they're
[54:30] supposed to properly eat stacked filled
[54:33] with vitamins and filled with the uh the
[54:37] the truths that they're supposed to
[54:39] receive all they receive is grilled and
[54:42] and little soups as the prophet said
[54:45] made from the shadow of a skinny chicken
[54:48] and they had to live on that so they
[54:51] also grow weekly week and start to
[54:55] suffer from tuberculosis in other words
[54:57] we were all dead and sins and trespasses
[55:00] we all were in that state like that and
[55:04] that little girl just ate or nine eight
[55:07] or nine years old
[55:11] and she had never had a doll for
[55:13] Christmas and that's what she wanted for
[55:17] a gift was a doll
[55:20] and the father not being able to give
[55:22] her medical attention and so forth he is
[55:26] seen that his little girl was also going
[55:31] fast away from him
[55:34] the wife already died he's struggling
[55:38] trying to keep the family to feed them
[55:41] and then he sees his little girl also
[55:45] about to leave the scene he tried his
[55:49] best to get enough money to get her a
[55:51] doll for Christmas he could not just get
[55:54] enough to buy her that doll
[55:57] and so Christmas time was coming on
[56:00] and the snowy bad weather set in
[56:05] and a little girl developed and
[56:09] pneumonia
[56:10] maybe just a few weeks
[56:14] Before Christmas
[56:16] and of course the father you can imagine
[56:19] he he was broken-hearted
[56:22] with that situation his morning from the
[56:26] wife then the daughter Upson she's ready
[56:29] to go he's working as hard as he can
[56:33] begging working doing whatever it can
[56:37] but being an outcast being weak as today
[56:41] some people don't know I won't hire that
[56:43] guy he might die on the job oh I
[56:45] wouldn't hire that guy maybe he's got a
[56:47] back problem I wouldn't hire this woman
[56:49] because she might get this or that or
[56:53] whatever you see it's like that and so
[56:56] many of those people they are trapped
[56:58] within a cycle right just just a evil
[57:02] vicious Wicked cycle and it can't and
[57:06] they are genuinely some people like that
[57:09] right oh my friends so here it is
[57:13] hallelujah amen and he thought of his
[57:16] little girl
[57:18] and she wanted a doll like little girls
[57:23] because in her
[57:27] is that to be a mother praise God is
[57:32] that right my God in us was always a
[57:36] desire to be a part of that brain amen
[57:42] we wanted to be sure we are part of that
[57:45] bride hallelujah amen and we want to be
[57:49] able to at least have the stature of a
[57:52] perfect man so there she is you see
[57:55] because that's the nature
[57:58] that's the nature of her thinking like
[58:00] that that one day she may become a
[58:05] mother Hallelujah and being motherly
[58:09] someday if she lives by her nature she
[58:13] will want to have something like that
[58:17] amen no matter where we were in our
[58:21] nature we wanted the truth we wanted the
[58:24] word we wanted a revelation for our day
[58:27] we wanted the stature of a perfect man
[58:31] Hallelujah we wanted to recognize it
[58:34] amen look at it and see it amen by God's
[58:38] word hallelujah amen so God is saved
[58:43] everything he could to get her a little
[58:46] doll but no matter what he did
[58:49] she died
[58:53] and because of her death
[58:56] that father
[58:58] begins to have a lapse of mind
[59:03] in other words you start having mental
[59:05] problems
[59:06] like that his wife
[59:09] had been taken
[59:11] and now his little girl had been taken
[59:16] and his mind got out of place see and he
[59:23] thought he'd go to bed every night
[59:27] and talk to his little girl
[59:30] though she was already buried
[59:33] he talked to her when he'd go to bed
[59:36] telling her honey it wouldn't be long
[59:39] now and that is going to get you this
[59:42] doll for Christmas because Daddy's
[59:45] promise you this doll and I'm gonna do
[59:49] all I can and I'll get this doll for you
[59:53] for Christmas
[59:55] well finally Christmas arrived
[1:00:01] and of course the rich had their big
[1:00:04] parties
[1:00:06] they were worrying about their big
[1:00:07] parties
[1:00:09] were worrying about the how many candles
[1:00:11] they could have burning in their windows
[1:00:15] they were caught up with their great
[1:00:18] High masses in their churches
[1:00:22] and talking about Jesus and so forth
[1:00:26] and going through all kinds of religious
[1:00:29] routines and mass and singing and carols
[1:00:33] and everything little did they know
[1:00:38] that in a back alley right there
[1:00:42] Hallelujah behind all of this
[1:00:45] was that
[1:00:49] there
[1:00:50] out of his mind talking to his daughter
[1:00:54] you know we've been reminded
[1:00:57] that in the midst of all that's going on
[1:01:00] not just to remember the poor the Fallen
[1:01:04] the needy
[1:01:06] but they don't see behind the facade of
[1:01:10] things that back there there is a living
[1:01:14] reality of lives being going on
[1:01:18] Hallelujah that little that fellow got
[1:01:22] beside himself he wanted that little
[1:01:25] girl to have the doll so bad cause she
[1:01:28] had begged for this little doll so he
[1:01:30] went out in that weather and bought her
[1:01:35] a little rag doll
[1:01:38] just a dirty little use something he had
[1:01:43] bought down on the side of a street
[1:01:47] and was was a real cold night
[1:01:51] The Winds of the blizzards were howling
[1:01:54] and blowing
[1:01:56] snow was falling hard there in New York
[1:02:01] City and right along the coast
[1:02:04] the streets were filling up the people
[1:02:07] in their great limousine cars were
[1:02:11] driving by
[1:02:13] the jumping parties were taking place
[1:02:17] people were out in masses drinking
[1:02:20] all claiming to celebrate the birth of
[1:02:24] Christ
[1:02:25] and of these things that we speak of
[1:02:28] here tonight
[1:02:30] oh but right away there were many also
[1:02:34] trying to drink off their old sorrows
[1:02:38] and them things the way many of them do
[1:02:42] some drinking off their sorrow some
[1:02:44] drinking off their guilt and you can you
[1:02:47] see the the drink is just to mask their
[1:02:50] mind to deafen their senses so that when
[1:02:53] you hear the voice of God's spirit
[1:02:55] speaking inside to them turn around turn
[1:02:58] around oh praise God God is calling amen
[1:03:03] oh praise God so God's speaking to them
[1:03:07] yes sir hallelujah amen oh my so we find
[1:03:13] out
[1:03:14] that this man wandered a long knowing in
[1:03:18] his heart the girl was gone but he still
[1:03:21] went and bought that doll anyhow because
[1:03:24] he had made a promise to her that he had
[1:03:28] buy her a little doll
[1:03:31] so he didn't have anywhere to go
[1:03:35] no one was home waiting for him
[1:03:39] so he just started walking in the snowy
[1:03:44] blizzard
[1:03:46] he couldn't fool himself
[1:03:48] she wasn't back in a little shanty and
[1:03:52] in that little sleeping in that little
[1:03:54] ragged dirty bed that they had for her
[1:03:59] because she was already buried he knew
[1:04:04] but he thought he'd find her
[1:04:08] from his mind he thought he'd find her
[1:04:10] somewhere on the street so he just said
[1:04:15] I'll just keep walking maybe I'll find
[1:04:19] her oh my and while he was going down
[1:04:23] them alleys he could hear many singing
[1:04:27] carols to the Lord
[1:04:31] and going down the alley packing in his
[1:04:35] hand that little dirty doll
[1:04:39] holding on to his coat
[1:04:41] amen his heart only thinking of his
[1:04:46] little girl finally a policeman happened
[1:04:50] to see him and the policeman had a few
[1:04:53] drinks himself
[1:04:56] and he ran into the alley and grabbed
[1:04:59] the old man turned him around and said
[1:05:02] what are you hanging around this alley
[1:05:04] here for uh you see he says now he told
[1:05:09] him where he lived where do you live
[1:05:12] um oh I live such and such he says uh
[1:05:15] what is that in your hand I have a
[1:05:17] little doll here sir
[1:05:18] what is it for he says I I have it for
[1:05:22] my little girl sir he says all right
[1:05:25] well you're going away from the place
[1:05:27] where you're supposed to be going that
[1:05:30] address you're you're drunk go back the
[1:05:33] other way then he said no sir I'm not
[1:05:36] drunk but I promised my little girl I'd
[1:05:41] get her a gift for Christmas
[1:05:45] and he said I'll get her this little I
[1:05:50] get her this little girl for this little
[1:05:52] girl I'll get her this doll the cop said
[1:05:56] let me see it
[1:05:57] he showed him a little dirty rag doll he
[1:06:01] was holding the policeman half drunk
[1:06:03] himself just shook them and said I'll
[1:06:06] get away from me and he started on his
[1:06:09] way and so the old man went down the
[1:06:12] alley snow falling fast all around him
[1:06:16] well
[1:06:18] the midnight parties broke up and I
[1:06:21] think about time the parties that these
[1:06:24] churches been having in this age of Leo
[1:06:27] this year I believe it's breaking up now
[1:06:29] uh everywhere it's breaking up now it's
[1:06:33] all falling apart amen praise God the
[1:06:36] next morning the snow had let up the sun
[1:06:40] come out and all the people from the gay
[1:06:43] parties with their snacks in their hands
[1:06:47] and sucks sorry on their uh in on in
[1:06:51] their hands and on their heads too much
[1:06:54] drinking celebration remember they're
[1:06:57] claiming to celebrate the birth of
[1:07:00] Christ
[1:07:02] oh my horse many of them from carrying
[1:07:06] on oh but way down in the alley
[1:07:11] they found the old man
[1:07:14] and when they turned him over he had
[1:07:18] that little doll right next held right
[1:07:21] next to his heart
[1:07:24] I suppose
[1:07:25] that's the way
[1:07:27] he was able to take his gift
[1:07:31] to his daughter
[1:07:33] but he kept his promise
[1:07:36] he took his gift
[1:07:38] to that girl
[1:07:40] Prophet says I suppose
[1:07:44] he found her
[1:07:47] he found her in a better land
[1:07:51] not here
[1:07:54] but in that land beyond the river oh
[1:07:58] thank God there's a land beyond the
[1:08:00] river
[1:08:02] Hallelujah that we call the sweet
[1:08:04] forever amen we shall meet again brother
[1:08:07] sisters we shall meet again praise the
[1:08:11] Lord amen glory to God hallelujah think
[1:08:16] of it
