of you that is here today and may the lord bless you it's cold outside it's dark a little damp but we are here in the house of the lord we are thankful to god for his marvelous and wonderful grace amen um just before you see that i want to correct that i spoke about the um i a o g i which is international assemblies of god independent convention that they're having at the burlington holiday inn on the service road you know near mother tuckers just up there and this is the marvelous and wonderful brochure that speaks of it and by the grace of god i see they have me penciled in just for a testimony right i was asked to speak but i said brother it may be best for me just to give a testimony um just for you know your sake and the sake of the entire group you have lots of other people and preachers and so that was a wonderful way but on tuesday night coming up which is this coming monday tuesday wednesday thursday will be their convention and i will testify at the 7 30 7 30 session part of that session i will give a testimony and there will be songs there praise god uh god bless every one of you if you can attend any of those any of those nights it will be wonderful and marvelous praise the lord some of the brothers are going to help with the um ushering praise god and i believe one sister um has volunteered to sing um they have their their music leader worship leader so they'll coordinate with that person and then but just to let you know so that you don't get shot when you get there the lead preacher for the entire meeting is a woman preacher from toronto so that you you're not shocked so you know praise the lord and you decide what you want to do about that praise the lord um so because the word never comes in domination to the church the word is the leadership of the church but anyway i thought i'd let you know those things for tonight we'll speak about how the church died and lived again and lives again praise the lord hallelujah can you put this up there revelation chapter 1 verses 19 and 20 revelations chapter 1 verses 19 and 20. shall we read write the things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be here after verse 20 the mystery of the seven stars which thou saw is in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sourced are the seven churches praise the lord gracious father we are so thankful for the reading of thy word and knowing that we are serving a living god and that when we come into your house like this though we can't see you you have made our soul our spirits more sensitive to your divine presence and lord we are so thankful that uh you're pleased with us when we get together in the spirit of god gathered around the spiritual feast of thy word for this we give you glory we give you honor and father we ask your divine blessing not just on your word for your word is always blessed but our gathering together unto thee as we see the bright shining light of the revelation of the world growing brighter and brighter and brighter as we approach that great day bless us everyone we pray father in jesus name amen god bless you praise god please be seated hallelujah now we are coming to the ending of our studies of the seven church ages there maybe three or four more lessons to go however this that we are touching on these rest of lessons are really going to be a review a recapitulation of the entire seven church ages just to remind us of what we have heard and to drive the stake down a little deeper that we might be able to advance in our walk in our lives and in our entire approach to god hallelujah now what you have been receiving was a complete historical uh pattern of the growth and manifestation of the church as we know it and tracing her through the ages right on down by a bit of the history also scriptural that was given by john the revelator by god himself praise god well of course we are not adding anything new but we are bringing out that which is already in the word praise god much of the modern understanding or revelation of the word is misunderstood and that is why a misunderstanding has come about with the word church when we say church we we we tend to have a wrong understanding of that because that word church even though it means ecclesia or called out wands called out assembly in this case god is not speaking directly just to his elect he is not speaking just to the ecclesia or the called out ones because you see what satan did was to expand the meaning of that word church or coliseum he's expanded it so now when the word of it says church or you say church now that means to include all that claims the name of jesus christ all that names themselves as christians all that makes that claim is considered within this word when we say the church right because you understand that the real pure and true called out ones are the bride of jesus christ are the elected ones according to the word but satan loves to waffle and uh he loves to cause things to have shades of difference to confuse confuse and and have people in a state where they can't really focus on that which is the truth right so in this case uh when there was only one church now he has created so many variations of the same thing that the people are out there confused wondering well what is the true church who is the true church what is this all about you see god didn't do that god established one church but since the book of acts satan has created an atmosphere of confusion on belief and chaos in the minds of the people until now when the word church is used it means the all those who claim they're christians all who carry that name amen they say they are christians just like uh now siesta are the jew when you are not and then you say i'm a christian they don't live the life of a christian they don't know what really a christian is but because they born in a christian church because they were baptized maybe as a baby in a christian church or confirmed or something they make a claim of a christian they didn't make a conscious repentance and talk to god that god will speak to their own heart and then make a then that they will serve the lord hallelujah from the bottom of their heart so then they become a what we call a nominal christian you see that's a christian only by name praise god but god is looking for people who are christians by nature which he gave to them praise god those are the people that he's looking for his own praise god amen so what we're talking about when the spirit is speaking to the ages and particularly even in this age and he says the church it means he is talking to the entire field the entire group or of people around the world that claims that they are christians but we understand that within that uh that great group our swat of people is the true vine and the false mind it's made up of the true vine and also of the false vine amen and those two vines are motivated by two different spirits hallelujah your motive is your desire your action something that motive means puts you into motion right emotion power motivation what causes you to act what causes you to act the way you act right so one spirit causes its people to act a certain way and the other spirit act causes its people to act another way the true and the false vain hallelujah praise god oh one has the spirit of god and the other has the spirit of the antichrist and we say antichrist because uh it acts like a christian but it's acting against christ right it acts just like a christian but its works its actions its attitudes its plans its it's calculations all of it it's working against christ it's like a bugs eating at the foundations of the word of god secretly until one day your household your whole house crumble and then you find out that these wood ants were eating at the foundations and that's how satan tried to seed them in to the body of christ so that he might ruin it that he might destroy it and tear it down completely amen both of them claim to be known of god but one knows that they are known and the other one is hoping by their by zeal by works by emotions by worship by everything they do that they will earn god's attention hallelujah but he only has attention for his wife he doesn't have attention for nobody else right so this is what is happening with these two vines exactly out there so both claim to be known of god and both are claiming that they speak or preach or testify for god they're making that claim that they can do that i am one says i am the lawful legal wife so i have a right to speak for god don't you see all these dresses i have don't you see all of the wonderful uniforms i carry don't you see all the crosses he gave me don't you see all the emeralds and the gold and the power that i have that he that he gave me oh my but that doesn't prove anything amen usually most of the time those are the signs of a harlot to the word of god amen but there they are both are claiming they're carrying his name right and by that if they claim to carry his name they are claiming a relationship with him which he doesn't have with them meaning that they now become false accusers they become false witnesses of the word of god claiming the man christ jesus is doing something that is not doing because they're claiming his name and saying he gave it and he never did right and so they're bearing false witness against him claiming a relationship with him which god calls marriage spiritual marriage in an invisible union of your soul with the word of god hallelujah and uh that my friends no one can visibly look and see that union except from what comes out of you except by your action but satan knows that and through the ages he has perfected his christian act or his actions so that even now when you act like a christian walk like a christian then uh he has a his group walking and talking the same way but they are mouthing the words what makes the difference is the revelation of the word of god for flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my father in heaven has revealed this unto you and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it that rock is the rock of revelation which the other one doesn't have and this is their downfall for their self-deceived deceivers of themselves they are distal they are uh self-deluded or as in modern times we'll use a word they're like legends in their own mind not according to the word of god here it is we find my friends they're not really married to him and therefore they don't have the revelation of the word but because they're claiming his name they put themselves in a position where everybody all that claims their christians have become responsible to him for their actions activities and whatever else they put out claiming to be the word of god we know that the false vine through the ages no matter what it did it could not overcome the true church the true vine it couldn't do it amen because jesus said the gates of hell the gates of hell oh my praise god look every time i'm talking like just just one sentence one word one verse and the whole thing just blooms and blossom you can go talk about the gates of hell now and oh jesus from way back there already seen them and talk about them and that the word of god his true elect are gonna have opposition and the gates of hell will will not prevail which means they're gonna fight against the world and fight against his children but they will not prevail is that right hallelujah i've said it before i'll say it again the devil thinks you're born to lose but thank god he already prophesied there it shall not prevail against it you already prophesied you will overcome the true vine will prevail the true vine will be the overcomers for they shall not prevail against the church no matter how wonderful how glorious how beautiful they look no matter how dumb and out she looks but yet the true church will prevail and they will make sure they bring the church to that position where she's brought down low and she looks like if she has nothing to even bother with but that's where the power and the presence of the living god would be living within her heart the quickness and power will reside there oh praise god forevermore hallelujah amen now you remember i was talking about how um that the the false church always wants to take its credibility and authority from the fact but look we have great works we got miracles you say you have signs we got signs they did that to moses they did that back in moses day and now they're doing it again oh you threw a snake down gonna turn into a rod and turn to a snake look weed can do the same thing look we do the same thing we have miracles we have tongues we have uh we have discernments we have all these signs wonders we've got visions and everything else like that but they failed to realize my friends that jesus said to his disciples have not i ordained you every one of them 12 of them right have not i ordained you and one of you is the devil a devil that was ordained a devil that was actually called out to carry out a purpose like it was in the old testament when um with micaiah and with another prophet when the devil come up before god and say you want a liar i i'll go down there and lie i'll go dumb in the mouth of that king and i'll lie i'll go down in the mouth of balaam's prophets and i lie i'll lie or oh my you see they don't realize that that was a devil and the devil and his cohorts does the same thing so jesus said i called all 12 for you fully well knowing what and who you are what one of you is a devil and one of you is going to betray me and you are going to put your hand and eat the same bread that i am eating the same word uh i have here you're gonna eat from it and you'll turn around and you will betray me amen do you believe that's happening spiritually now people that supposed to be christians denying the very word of god denying the very presence of the living god wanting to call it a false spirit wanting to call it something else when it's the spirit of god and you you must decide what do you believe or who do you believe or who do you say this is who do you say this is praise the name of the lord amen and judas had a definite holy ghost ministry it was definitely it was the holy ghost but we'll touch on that a little later here praise god amen but just like the first adam was given a brain and shortly after he was given her she was defiled or beguiled by satan according to the bible but she came from the hand of god clean virgin on the file but satan corrupted her way in a brief span of time look at the same thing happening with the second adam but now not just one woman it's a many-membered body as typed in the life of solomon who had the 3 000 wives or something like that but all those 3 000 women were considered to be his wife right and the same way all the millions of believers or around the world who truly believe they together are considered to be the wife of jesus christ now we understand like with the first adam whose wife was the file like that we find out clearly friends that even the wife of jesus christ was defiled in the same way because she came forth pure and fresh and anointed under their pentecost and she came out like that and remained separate from the rest of the world and undefiled for a short while and then the bible testifies to that by saying and of the rest of them there's no man join himself unto them acts chapter 5 verse 13. in other words nobody was running to join that church as we see today people are running to join churches but there was nobody running to join that church why they heard about ananias and sapphira telling a lie to the preacher and prop falling down dead and having to be carried out to the graveyard amen they heard about this one telling a lie and the apostles just strike him blind you'd be blind for a season from this time and so on why would they want to join the church like that only if you are 100 true other than that you don't want anything to do with it because once those men speak on their word come to pass you are in serious trouble is that right listen to the scripture and of the rest there's no man join himself to them praise god but the lord added daily such as should be saved the lord who's adding the lord oh no i've got a a program of assimilation i've got a program of multiplication they they come up with the scientific programs from this doctor this and after that that they worked out programs of how to increase your church numbers and how to increase your attendance and programs of how to increase your sunday school programs and so on like that but the bible says what god himself added to the church such as should be saved is that right god added nobody else could add and when god add them they can fit right in but when god didn't add them the rest doors no man joined himself to them it wouldn't work whatsoever hallelujah amen how long they continued like that you know they continued eating eating the word of eating bread and having prayers and fellowshipping together as one in jesus christ hallelujah but one day just like eve was tempted the church was also attempted she was tempted and seduced by satan and contaminated by the entrance of an antichrist spirit right it was an antichrist spirit that entered into their thinking processes their believing processes amen for john said and we know it happened because in john 4 3 amen that this is the spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come and even now is already in the world amen so he was acknowledging that it was already there amen and jesus himself said concerning the bride in that first age i have something against thee because thou has what left thy first love amen you left your first love you fell from where you were and you left your first love remember from whence the word fallen and repent amen praise god so what he's saying here is that the church the the ephesian church after paul left the scene became a fallen woman fallen from our righteousness fallen from our purity of the word and into darkness of the deceit of satan that was upon her amen praise god hallelujah well really what caused the church to fall at that time revelation 2 6 tells us did you have within you the deeds of the nicolaitans the deeds of the nicolaitans amongst you and so they dropped off what god is saying you you pulled away from depending upon me completely and now you want to have me and at the same time take on a hierarchy of human leadership you start leaning on human leadership contrary to the word of god rejecting my way and taking the way of this human leadership that is here upon the world amen so nickelodeonism their form of organizing human organization human systems of governing and ruling and you'll see right now the denominational churches each one has a different form of what they call church government amen ruling or dominating over the church oh but god has his way in his own bible and that's not that's not the same thing one is an organism the other is an organization its strength lays in its organization uh the strength of god's church lays in the fact that it is a living thing it's an organism infused and indwelt by the holy spirit who is motivating or moving her causing her to do and say the things she's doing and saying praise the name of the lord hallelujah amen oh my look the only reason for a government is to legislate rules for people is that right it's the legislative rules and then the the people will be ruled by what the laws that they created that's why you'll hear all around the world different nations saying we're a nation of laws we're a nation of laws we're a nation of laws we're ruled by law and that's really what it is and they're right but that's the natural level right when we come to the spiritual level we are ruled by our invisible king the holy spirit the lord jesus christ amen who lives in our hearts and governs us from the inside out praise god we are moved and motivated by him this great god in our midst we take god for that hallelujah that he's honoring us or honors us with his divine presence and we give god the glory you see the moment they took on religious government or organization denomination spiritual death entered to the church of god spiritual death entered right in just like how death entered by sin in eden again the spirit of spiritual death entered in into the church of the living god down through the ages in the very same way amen but thank god the spirit of god says to him that overcome it overcome what that spirit of organization that spirit of human government and systems to him that overcome it i will give to eat of the tree of life in the paradise of god well we know the tree of life is jesus christ himself who is the word amen i will give him he'll give you a revelation of himself he'll open up the word to your understanding he'll cause you to see things and he said he will give you that to you praise god but you see the church had already imbibed or taken in so much of the poison fruit of of the spirit of death in it that it was already dying and didn't know it right they were having meetings carrying on but they didn't know it just like modern pentecost today is dead and some parts dying but they don't know it they still think revival is going on revival is going on but they don't know the spirit of death has already entered in that is working within the organizations everywhere and they become so colors and hardened to it uh like the frog in the kettle that kind of heat to them seems nice but it's death in the pot to be that way according to god's word amen hallelujah oh my of course i repeat the message to that first church age was not just a message to that uh local church in ephesus but it was to the entire ephesian spirit that will be in all the church ages right on to the end of it for the church ages all run parallel is that right when we say oh the first church age ended in 64 80 70 a.d whatever that ended that means it officially ended but the spiritual life of that church age continues on right to eternity and likewise when the second one started maybe it started later but that continues on the third one starts it starts a little later but it continues on and so we come down to this end of time and that's why people are under such mental spiritual supernatural pressure because all those supernatural devils and demons of all them ages have now accumulated and they're coming against the saints of the living god is that right so you understand that that that that woman that had the seven devils in her uh a type of the church with all seven of them coming against her but at the end of it jesus cast them out the word will do the same thing again hallelujah it'll do the same thing again it takes the word of god to do that amen praise god hallelujah because uh we look at the church from another point of view like the seed and the sore when you had a field and uh the source sowed good seed but then uh an enemy came and he also sowed seeds well any field is able to take any seed whether it be good or bad whether it be grass or wheat it's all going to grow but because it grows doesn't mean it's of god you see it's just god just let it happen that way he sends his reign on the just and on the unjust oh my think of it that that you'll have uh all together one a devil one a true seed of god and the holy spirit's anointing falls in the church and all will say praise god all will say amen oh my but you see it's not the rain that's falling on you is that right it's what seed for every seed must bring forth after its kind the rain that's coming now is only to bring out what seed is buried in you to show what nature was planted in you before you even do it as the bible says before the foundation of the world god for ordained hallelujah i'm so glad that the true baptism of the holy spirit is not just the latter rain falling on you for you to have an enjoyable wonderful time but it's to bring out the life of the seed that is in you for every seed must bring forth after its kind then whose seed are you i was asked that question you are being asked that question whose seed are you what fruits your beer is going to show whose seed you are amen you don't have to try to work up real christianity oh i'm supposed to be an orange tree so even though i'm a lemon i'm going to try to see if i can bring forth an orange you see that's what's happening right oh christians are supposed to be lambs but i have the nature of a pig or a goat or a donkey but i'm going to change and i'm i'm just going to start acting like a lamb no it doesn't happen that way every seed must bring forth after its kind that kind of christianity is unconscious that kind of christianity is not made up that kind of christianity it comes from the core of your being from your nature inside hallelujah praise god those kinds of people from since they are small they always knew somewhere they were different but they didn't know why why am i acting like this why am i thinking like this why am i talking why am i letting people go they do me this they do that they do the other they tell a lie on me they do that yeah and somehow you don't have a spirit of vengeance you don't have a spirit of killing retaliation and all these kinds of things because there is a nature that god planted in there in your heart in your life and you can't help it that's the way you built praise be to god i'm glad i can say i'm one of them i said i'm glad that i can say i am one of them it is not i that live but christ that lived within me praise god i am what i am praise be to god hallelujah amen beat and the tears hallelujah the wheat and the tears growing up together like that and so the church became organized the church placed itself on the human government in contradiction to the word of god but you know tears if you put let me use grass so you will understand a little better if you have grass and wheat growing in a field the weeds always grow up faster than anything you can plant is that right your true planting will always come afterwards and so with the false church you have a true church and you're trying to teach people and grow them in the grace of god and you just see one sprout come up here another day or another and it looks like it's coming up so slowly but let the the false church just goes into an area oh my and just buy a piece of land in that housing project and they don't have no members there but we're going to have a church do you know from the first sunday that building is packed it's packed right away when i say that it's not that all the people are false what i'm saying that the making of that church is to pull in as many people as they can in there might be true and false you know a mixture of fish and frog but nevertheless they they'll pull a a great crowd in and so they're flourished in a great way praise the lord and they'll just be mighty in that way and they carry great influence and credibility by forming themselves into organizations because remember federal governments world governments government government at every level come down until you get local government right down down down down and all supporting each other even if you don't see any visible connection they are behind the scenes supporting each other is that right and so what happens my friends is that that gives the church credibility oh i am a registered corporation of so-and-so uh supported by the government and and the government minister comes and this and that and the other my friends they are supported by the government of the of the age that we are in right now hallelujah but think about it my friends it's just like when um a woman gets married man gets married or he's just oh he's over the top he's enjoying his honeymoon but you see um after a while all the passion and everything else start to die off and it continues on but maybe it's a steady strong steady love that continues on right on down but you know what some of those marriages change from honeymoon to blue moon i'm sorry it's just i'm not thinking while i'm talking i just i'm just explaining to you here that's what happened it becomes a blue moon and uh you know the guy the guy or the woman maybe have to go out and and maybe sing one of those old songs the blue moon of kentucky is something or the other and tears are coming down it changes and so the church changed with this devotion with its love with this passion with desire for the lord jesus christ completely amen my friends and so it influenced even some of the church leaders like polycarp who allowed himself to be established as a bishop it's not like a minister any minister that's really anointed with the holy ghost and if he has a congregation he's really the bishop of that church which means shepherd doesn't mean he's some exalted person he's just a shepherd right but when it says history tells you this that after polycarp uh may was made bishop this means that he was enthroned as a bishop they have a nice big chair and they put him to sit down they put a crumb on his head then they give him a staff and they gave him certain chains that must wear for everybody to know he's a bishop he was enthroned as a bishop and although he was a good man he accepted that see that shows he was a direct disciple of john the revelator it just shows you the deterioration of the true faith as it went downwards downwards into what historians would call the dark ages and the church entered into the dark ages of the church now i'm not going to keep you here forever praise god i'm just going to let you go because i can keep speaking like this but i just want you to be aware that after the true church lost this love it began to fall into all of these eras after that cooling off period period that she had after the period of blissful wedded life of pentecostal faith and power and the presence of the living god then she began to wander away revelation 2 1 amen hallelujah it describes the lord jesus christ in the midst of his church holding the messengers in his right hand because the bride has fallen hallelujah and because the church was not become coming a corporate structure right rather than a spiritual and supernatural body led by the holy spirit now we will talk more about i'll think i'll end this tonight but i just you you know what i'm saying is that in our modern times the true church is looking like it's a primitive something that's it's not people don't even know what the real true church is and they're looking at these like when jesus himself came on the scene the pharisees had presented such a false picture of what a real jewish believer ought to be so when jesus came on the scene he seems like he was bucking all these things in the against this and against but he says but this is wrong did not uh isaiah said such and such oh wow you're doing the opposite did not moses say so and so oh how can you come you're you're doing this did not jeremiah's well did jeremiah say even your father abraham and he quoted from these different different ones and proving to them and they got so enraged and so angry the only way they can keep establishing themselves as the true ones was to kill him get him off the scene and so will it be with the true church of the living god whom the bible calls the little speckled bird sprinkled with the blood of our mate we free into into the glory of god and one day that's what we look forward for may the great holy spirit bless each one of you here tonight that have come to hear the word of god i trust that these few words would enter into your hearts and life keep you preserve you to the very end our gracious heavenly father as we have preached the word may the word now take its position and its preeminence may the word take its lordship and rule in the hearts of these believers for we commit them into your hands in jesus name praise be to god and as we go from this building now father not from your presence may your presence go up with us and as we go may you take us safely to our various homes protect us on the road surround us with your great love oh god bless granting health strength prosper your people in whatever they put their hands and minds and thoughts to and then bring us safely again that we might fellowship around the world with thee and with each other to thee be all the glory in jesus name amen we are dismissed brought tonight god bless you praise the lord it's okay we are dismissed and we can file out quietly praise the lord god bless you hallelujah that's that's
