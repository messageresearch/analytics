[0:59] to partake of the lord's supper

[1:06] him as we have been commanded
[1:10] and as the apostles also
[1:14] practiced may the great holy spirit
[1:17] bless us all let us pray before we read
[1:21] our scripture our gracious heavenly
[1:24] father
[1:26] we thank thee for thy word
[1:29] we ask thy blessing upon this
[1:32] congregation we ask your blessing upon
[1:36] your
[1:37] called out ones
[1:40] we call your blessing upon the glorious
[1:44] assembly of god
[1:47] the firstborn from on high
[1:51] take all your glory lord and
[1:54] speak to your children in the name
[1:57] of jesus christ amen
[2:00] and amen reading from
[2:04] first corinthians
[2:07] 11 verses 23
[2:11] to 25
[2:15] for i have received of the lord
[2:20] that which also i delivered
[2:23] unto you that the lord jesus
[2:27] the same night in which
[2:30] he was betrayed took bread
[2:35] and when he had given thanks
[2:38] he break it and said
[2:41] take eat this
[2:45] is my body which is
[2:48] broken for you this
[2:52] do in remembrance
[2:55] of me after the same manner
[2:59] also he took the cup
[3:04] when he had sucked saying
[3:07] this cup is the new testament
[3:11] in my blood this new ye
[3:15] as oft as you drink it
[3:19] in remembrance
[3:22] of me
[3:25] now brothers and sisters
[3:30] we are here to talk about the lord's
[3:32] supper
[3:33] and together around the lord's table
[3:39] of course the lord's supper
[3:42] tells us a wonderful story
[3:47] it is the story of redemption
[3:50] that we can see in the emblems
[3:54] that the lord himself gave to
[3:58] us that whenever we
[4:01] look at them whenever we partake of them
[4:05] whenever we are together in
[4:09] fellowship we do this
[4:12] in remembrance of him because
[4:16] it tells us the story of how a savior
[4:20] came from glory came and
[4:24] died upon the calvary's cross
[4:28] how he purchased a redemption
[4:31] it tells the story these
[4:34] very emblems tell the story
[4:37] if we have the mind and the instruction
[4:41] of god
[4:42] to understand
[4:45] these emblems also
[4:48] point to the person
[4:51] of this story and that person
[4:55] is none other than the lord jesus christ
[4:59] for he is the center of
[5:03] all things he is the wheel in the middle
[5:07] of the wheel he is the one
[5:10] that controls all things
[5:13] and he is the beginning he is the
[5:17] ending he is the same yesterday
[5:20] today and forever he
[5:23] is all in all and the
[5:27] entire story of redemption
[5:30] it just centers around
[5:34] him as he is the central figure
[5:39] of this entire story and the lord's
[5:42] supper
[5:44] speaks of him
[5:47] the lord's supper also my brothers and
[5:50] sisters
[5:51] reveals the bride
[5:55] as the purpose of the story
[5:58] why did jesus come why did he leave the
[6:03] ivory palaces of glory to come to
[6:06] sinful earth what was his mission
[6:10] what was his the purpose of him
[6:13] fulfilling the word
[6:15] it was that he might come and redeem
[6:19] his bride who were
[6:23] in the devil's pawnshop
[6:26] of sin and so the
[6:29] bride is the purpose that made him
[6:33] leave the glory of heaven
[6:36] and come into this sin curse
[6:39] world for you and i
[6:43] i am so happy today that this savior
[6:47] this
[6:47] jesus this great redeemer
[6:51] thought about us and came to redeem us
[6:55] by his precious blood hallelujah glory
[6:58] to god
[6:59] amen these emblems
[7:04] points to this great
[7:08] time of the calling out of the bride
[7:13] we're taking the lord's supper and as we
[7:17] take it
[7:18] may we meditate upon these things how
[7:21] blessed we are how privileged we are
[7:25] how honored we are that the king
[7:29] will come to save beggars
[7:32] beggars apparently beggars
[7:36] slaves apparently slaves
[7:39] my brothers but underneath that
[7:42] exterior there lives within
[7:46] that human body a
[7:50] chosen one part of the body of
[7:53] christ the bride of jesus christ
[7:56] the called out once the ecclesia of god
[8:00] the real new jerusalem
[8:04] the bright church of the living god
[8:07] in the last day for whom he
[8:10] shed his blood oh the father
[8:14] planned the savior bled and died
[8:17] and now the holy spirit is here
[8:20] executing the plan to bring
[8:23] forth as i say to you now this
[8:26] lord's supper also points to the
[8:30] consummation of this story
[8:33] what a beautiful ending story a what a
[8:36] story of
[8:37] love and redemption of how the prince of
[8:41] glory
[8:42] came to redeem a
[8:45] captive bride and to take her out
[8:48] from the prison doors the prisons
[8:52] and the walls of sin and to bring her
[8:55] out and take her back to his
[8:59] father's house for in my father's house
[9:03] there were many mansions
[9:05] and so we see this this this story
[9:08] has a beautiful ending where the
[9:12] bride and the bright groom the prince of
[9:16] life and his wife
[9:19] the story ends with them living
[9:22] happily ever after within the millennial
[9:26] kingdom of god
[9:27] and after that into the eternities you
[9:31] never ending eternities way beyond
[9:34] tomorrow
[9:36] in the very presence of almighty god oh
[9:39] what a day what an hour i live for the
[9:42] great hour
[9:43] of the manifestation of the fullness
[9:47] of the word and therefore
[9:50] when we come for this lord's supper
[9:54] we do not come with sadness
[9:57] we do not come with weeping and wailing
[10:01] but we come to have a celebration
[10:05] oh this lord's supper is a celebration
[10:09] of his life and of
[10:12] ours his life in us
[10:16] we celebrate this fact that
[10:19] god has come to take his home
[10:23] and his dominion within our hearts and
[10:26] life aren't you happy
[10:28] aren't you glad that out of
[10:31] one in a million he called you out of
[10:34] the my reclaim
[10:35] when a million people perished under the
[10:39] trolls of sin satan and
[10:42] suffering at the same time he
[10:46] brought you out and he unveiled you
[10:50] that you are part of him
[10:53] and actually you are a part of him
[10:56] revealed
[10:57] all things beyond a god oh
[11:00] for this marvelous and wonderful deposit
[11:04] this gift that was given to us
[11:07] from before the foundation of the world
[11:10] and because it's eternal in us
[11:14] we can never die for he delivered and
[11:16] believeth on me shall
[11:18] never die thanks be the god hallelujah
[11:22] may the spirit of almighty god live
[11:25] in our hearts now and forevermore
[11:28] this is a great celebration we are here
[11:31] for
[11:32] the lord supper this is a festival
[11:36] a festival a feast praise the lord
[11:40] that we are here for we are not here to
[11:43] fast
[11:45] i said we are not here to fast but we
[11:48] are here to
[11:49] feast and when we eat the bread and we
[11:52] drink the wine
[11:53] we think of the supernatural spiritual
[11:57] feast now upon the revealed word of god
[12:01] and the quickening power of the spirit
[12:04] of god
[12:05] that comes upon that word and makes it
[12:08] live again and that places us
[12:11] also at the great supper time
[12:15] we shall have in heaven with all the
[12:18] saints of all the ages
[12:20] oh blessed be the name of the lord most
[12:23] high
[12:24] glory god so we are here for a festival
[12:28] oh praise god be a here for a feast
[12:32] and not for a fast may god help you to
[12:36] feast upon this fact upon this
[12:39] word of god here today and may your sin
[12:43] so
[12:43] rejoice in him the lord god your savior
[12:47] as mary's soul rejoiced in the lord
[12:51] praise his marvelous and wonderful name
[12:54] this lord sappa is also
[12:58] a sacrifice but
[13:01] not because it's a sacrifice
[13:04] where we see him hanging on the cross
[13:08] dying on the cross being pierced on the
[13:11] cross
[13:11] being mocked scuffed up spat upon
[13:15] while he was on the cross but we with
[13:18] our open
[13:19] eyes can now see that that which
[13:22] appeared because remember my brother
[13:24] sister that this symbol
[13:27] my friends we see here this symbol
[13:30] the sacrificial symbol following
[13:34] all the substitutes until him hanging on
[13:38] the rear as the reality
[13:39] upon that cross to the true believer
[13:43] with open eyes we see it as a
[13:46] scene of joy we see it as a
[13:49] scene of victory the lord's supper
[13:54] represents his victory his glorious
[13:57] victory in his love divine for
[14:01] us to bring us back to himself
[14:04] for god was in christ redeeming the
[14:08] world
[14:08] unto himself glory be to
[14:11] god forevermore hallelujah amen
[14:15] thanks be to god yes sir we know
[14:18] that this lord's supper
[14:21] also is not a symbol of
[14:24] shame for hanging on a cross
[14:28] in the time of israel
[14:32] back there back in the old days my
[14:35] friends
[14:35] was a sign of shame it was a sign
[14:39] of being a criminal an outcast from
[14:43] society
[14:44] one that was rejected they were not
[14:47] realizing they were rejecting the chief
[14:50] cornerstone
[14:51] they were rejecting the keystone they
[14:54] were rejecting the foundation stone
[14:56] they were for uh rejecting the capstone
[15:00] oh praise god the glorious
[15:05] stone that god said i lay in zion
[15:08] a cornerstone a beautiful stone
[15:12] and jesus christ is that stone that
[15:15] rock of all ages that ever present
[15:19] what rock that gives up ever living
[15:22] water
[15:23] life-giving water for the soul of the
[15:25] true believer hallelujah
[15:27] so this hanging on the cross this lord
[15:31] suffered to us
[15:32] is not a symbol of shame
[15:36] but a great symbol of
[15:39] glory hallelujah it's a symbol
[15:42] of glory it's a glorious symbol
[15:45] praise god hallelujah can you see it
[15:49] it's not shame but it's glory praise god
[15:52] hallelujah lord god amen
[15:56] so when we look we don't just see
[16:00] punishment punishment on that cross
[16:05] we don't just see that yes
[16:08] yes uh oh praise god hallelujah
[16:12] according to isaiah how did the
[16:16] lord have placed upon him
[16:19] the inequity of us all and isaiah said
[16:22] the lord struck him
[16:24] amen god struck him he bore
[16:28] our sins god struck him but we do not
[16:32] see just the fact that god struck him
[16:35] and he took
[16:36] the punishment but we see our glorious
[16:39] relief
[16:40] a release because the day he was
[16:43] punished
[16:44] that was the day we were set free for he
[16:47] became poor that we may become rich
[16:50] he becomes sin that we may become the
[16:54] righteousness of god
[16:56] hallelujah oh he went to a devil's hell
[16:59] that we might avoid it praise god
[17:02] he took her place at calvary so that
[17:06] justice may be able
[17:09] to be fulfilled and the wrath of god
[17:12] can pass over you and i and we can
[17:16] come into the volley before the troll of
[17:19] god under the blood of christ in the
[17:23] name of the lord jesus christ set free
[17:26] by this great thing that happened
[17:29] upon golgotha's hill so the lord's
[17:33] supper
[17:33] is more than just seeing the bread
[17:37] and the wine but it's seeing the
[17:40] revelation the understanding behind the
[17:43] symbolism
[17:45] of the bread and wine the lord
[17:48] support hallelujah praise god
[17:52] we see it with our open eyes and realize
[17:56] that it's not just seeing the punishment
[17:59] but seeing that precious one
[18:02] that set us free by his precious blood
[18:06] praise god our eyes have been opened
[18:09] have your eyes been opened
[18:11] my eyes have been opened i believe it
[18:14] our
[18:14] eyes have been opened by the revelation
[18:17] of god
[18:18] we have accepted the dabbing
[18:21] of the i saw the cross our eyes by
[18:24] prophetic hands
[18:26] that has open our eyes to recognize the
[18:30] word of god
[18:31] for their hour and for this day what a
[18:34] hour praise
[18:35] god hallelujah oh my
[18:38] we look at them at him hanging on the
[18:41] cross
[18:42] and let me say this we do not
[18:45] only see punishment but we see
[18:48] atonement we see that we
[18:51] come back to end at one
[18:55] met with god we have come back to
[18:58] oneness with god hallelujah glory to god
[19:03] god and i walking down life's road
[19:06] together
[19:07] walking in a fellowship in the union
[19:11] once again like he did with adam and eve
[19:14] when he came down at the evening time
[19:17] at the cool of the day to have
[19:20] fellowship with them
[19:21] and hear the end of the world here he
[19:24] comes again the mighty god in christ
[19:27] to have fellowship with his beloved sons
[19:31] and daughters
[19:32] here in the evening time once again
[19:35] this is the evening time it's later than
[19:38] you
[19:39] think and god keeps all of his
[19:41] appointments
[19:42] and here he descends by the opening of
[19:46] seven
[19:46] seals and presents himself to his people
[19:50] that we might recognize that we are a
[19:53] redeemed
[19:54] people we are a atonement
[19:57] a people that have received a tall man
[19:59] and we have come
[20:00] back into reconciliation
[20:04] with god the fellowship that was broken
[20:07] has been restored
[20:09] our joy of salvation has been restored
[20:14] our union with him has been restored
[20:18] how happy can we be to
[20:21] recognize the shining of this heavenly
[20:24] sunshine in the dark caverns of our
[20:27] souls
[20:28] and bringing us light and we may become
[20:31] children of the light who walk no more
[20:33] in darkness and
[20:34] ignorance but having in us the light of
[20:37] life
[20:38] praise god hallelujah for in us
[20:41] god has placed a tabernacle for the son
[20:44] o glory god who resides in his
[20:48] residence within the hearts of the true
[20:50] believer
[20:51] thanks be to god hallelujah amen
[20:55] this lord's supper also
[20:59] is symbolic and points
[21:02] to the bond of brotherhood
[21:06] of all believers
[21:09] of all time all
[21:12] nations all places
[21:16] of all ages one loaf
[21:20] one cup one god
[21:24] one baptism one one
[21:27] one oneness praise god the unity
[21:31] of god's people in him
[21:35] knowing that he is in us and
[21:38] we are in him praise god hallelujah
[21:41] the great revelation of the mystery of
[21:45] god that brings us to a place where we
[21:48] can say
[21:49] like paul oh i wish i could make
[21:52] all men see what is the fellowship
[21:56] of the mystery what is the revelation
[21:59] what is the fellowship that this
[22:02] revelation
[22:03] of the mystery of god gives to us
[22:07] it brings us into an invisible union
[22:10] with christ and with each other and
[22:14] praise god we have communion with him
[22:18] and we also have communion
[22:21] with each other the fellowship
[22:24] of all the saints of all the ages don't
[22:27] you think the scripture is real
[22:30] where paul said we are encompassed
[22:34] with my friends a cloud a great cloud of
[22:39] witnesses
[22:40] don't you think when we come together to
[22:43] celebrate
[22:44] and to have a festival of the lord's
[22:46] supper
[22:47] that they are observing and watching
[22:51] what we are doing and are happy and
[22:54] rejoicing in heaven
[22:55] that they have caught the revelation of
[22:58] the last prophet's message
[23:00] they've caught the revelation of who
[23:02] jesus christ
[23:03] is this caught the revelation of the
[23:06] true
[23:06] water baptism they've caught the
[23:09] revelation
[23:10] of the opening of the word the calling
[23:13] out
[23:13] of their names they have caught the
[23:16] revelation
[23:17] of the things that are going to be and
[23:20] they are
[23:20] fully aware of the modern events
[23:24] causing them to look up for the
[23:26] redemption snare
[23:28] for their recognized modern events
[23:31] being made clear by the vindicated
[23:35] prophecy of the son of god that he sent
[23:39] as his messenger in this age and
[23:42] in this hour praise the lord so
[23:45] when we come to the lord's table let us
[23:49] be conscious
[23:50] and aware we are not alone
[23:53] but we are encompassed by this
[23:56] great innurable host this
[23:59] great this great cloud of witnesses
[24:03] oh please god that are rejoicing
[24:06] along with us and we are in fellowship
[24:09] with those saints according to the word
[24:12] of god
[24:13] shall i read now which out of revelation
[24:18] chapter 19 verses
[24:21] 5 to 9. and the
[24:24] voice came out of the throne saying
[24:27] praise our god all his servants
[24:31] and ye that fear him both
[24:34] small and great and i heard as it were
[24:39] the voice of a great multitude
[24:42] and as the voice of many waters and as
[24:46] the voice of
[24:47] many thunderings mighty thundering
[24:50] saying
[24:51] hallelujah hallelujah for the lord
[24:56] god omnipotent reign it
[24:59] let us be glad and rejoice
[25:03] and give honor unto him
[25:06] for the marriage of the lamb is come
[25:10] and his wife has made herself ready
[25:15] and to her was granted that she should
[25:18] be arrayed in
[25:19] fine linen clean and white
[25:22] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[25:26] of the saints and he said unto me
[25:29] right blessed are they which are
[25:32] called unto the marriage supper of the
[25:36] lamb
[25:36] and he said unto me these are
[25:40] the true sayings of god hallelujah
[25:43] thanks be to god for being called to the
[25:47] marriage
[25:48] supper of the lamb of which
[25:51] this is only a pre-figure
[25:55] of that which is to come the lord's
[25:58] supper
[25:59] that we partake of praise god oh
[26:02] hallelujah prefigures the
[26:05] marriage supper that is to come
[26:08] this great supper of the lamb
[26:12] praise god so this
[26:15] communion this
[26:18] great fellowship will come to its
[26:22] fullness
[26:24] when we are together again
[26:26] [Music]
[26:28] in our father's house now the family of
[26:32] god is scattered here and there
[26:34] as one songwriter says but lord we
[26:38] love them there and wherever they are
[26:42] we love them dearly oh
[26:45] god where whichever so-called
[26:48] pastor denomination church group
[26:52] wherever they are we know salvation
[26:55] is not a mass event but it is an if
[26:59] individual affair of god speaking to our
[27:02] hearts
[27:03] and our prayer today and our work and
[27:06] our mission
[27:07] our zeal and our desire is to find our
[27:10] brothers and sisters
[27:12] your loved ones your hidden ones your
[27:15] chosen ones
[27:16] wherever they are father and bring them
[27:20] to attention of your word
[27:22] so that we can go together and
[27:25] meet again in our father's house
[27:28] meet them in the morning by the eastern
[27:32] gate where they will be rejoicing and
[27:35] praising the lord hallelujah
[27:37] then brother sister
[27:40] we know then with all these truths
[27:45] that the lord's supper is a solemn
[27:49] affair it's joyful
[27:52] but it's something sober
[27:56] and solemn and this
[27:59] observance of the lord's supper is not
[28:02] based on the matter of our
[28:06] moods on any certain day
[28:09] well i i have a bad mood
[28:12] i don't feel like taking the lord's
