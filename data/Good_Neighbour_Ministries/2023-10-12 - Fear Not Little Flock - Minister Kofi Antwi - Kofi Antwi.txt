not easy the hour is late but we have to keep on pressing on because God is coming soon to get out get us out from this mess the world is in a mess but God is up to something big always as our beloved pastor says and I want to be a part of it you must be a part of it so I won't delay tonight we will go into the scriptures please thank you so much for your contribution every single one of you that support Good Neighbor with your support uh my scripture will be taken from Luke 12 32 and first John 3 chapter 1 uh Tim please can you play for us tonight before I start yeah lead us in prayer yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord amen Luke 1232 which will be my topic it says fear not little flock for it is your father good good pleasure to give you the kingdom and first John 3:1 behold what manner of love the father had bestowed upon us that we should be call the sons of God therefore the the world knowth knowth us not because it knew him not may the Lord had his Blessing please be seated fear not why is it that any time in human race the Lord or angel of God will appear onto Humanity the first word the angel will speak is fear fear not because in knew human heart there's always fear fear is something even the animals when they want to catch one another you see the animal that wanted to catch the strong one that wanted to catch the weak one he always put fear in these days if you watch the church and the world the world is in fear that is the ttic the enemy is using people can't come to church or can progress in their life is all because of what fear because when you fear you can't progress in natural life when you are a Christian and you allow the devil to put fear on you you cannot progress the way God want you to progress because fear is something we have to get out from from and you cannot do it unless you are a seed of God and you recognize that at this hour you are portion of the root of David that have to be made flesh then once you recognize it it takes the fear from you then you begin to know who you are what you are rais up for then the enemy no matter what he bring on you he can't overcome you because you'll be strong like a like an eagle wanted to catch hyena the the the devil is the hyena Eagle is not hyena but when hyena see the eagle he is running for cover when the devil see you like our pastor says when you become a hot potato right the devil can't handle you because God you have know who you are am you know that God didn't raise you just to be an a chicken or just to come to ordinary church because these days the churches have so many coming going coming going people have stay in the church long but they don't know who they are they coming and they going but you become so certain of God because you know that you know because God has made known to you that's why the Lord himself said fear not it is your father pleasure to give you the kingdom what is the kingdom the kingdom is the word of God and it's within you Hallelujah the kingdom is the word of God and God says the kingdom of God is within you so you have to recognize who you are what you are here for what is your purpose on Earth do you know when you recognize who you are no matter how situation appear in your life you are not shaken by it you are not worried about it as this man outside man here will be always worryed that's his job but I'm not talking about the outside man I'm talking about the Inner Man the in man has no revealed to you that God you are one of the little FL because not Jesus said many are called few are chosen if you are one of the chosen one God made known to you and it become R to you who you really are no man can take it from you it's not a church give you eternal life it's not your father give you eternal life it's not your mother give you eternal life your husband give you eternal life you could wear long dress up to here you could wear long hair up to your long hair up to down here and don't paint your face it's all good but that does not make you a Christian Christian you were born as a Christian because when Jacob even while he was yet in his mother womb he has not stepped up to the Earth God says I love Jacob I hate Esau when job was sick all kinds of boy the Lord revealed to him when the Sons and Daughters of God shout for Joy where were you job where were you job saw himself there that he was a part of God do you know when you begin to see that for yourself put yourself into that condition you will see all things that that are not good that used to hold you begin to leave you yes let me tell you it doesn't matter what happen once you have this breath in you and you are walking on the head there's no time your head going to walk down because you know why the perfect one has come and reveal himself to you you become set you know this Bible become a new Bible unto you the Bible become new Bible to you now when you reading the Bible you're not reading it like the way you used to read or you listen to the tape of brother Braham you not listening to it like that or reading it like that letter to the letter but you are seeing yourself in the in the script scripture brother thank you you finish it for me you look into the mirror what did you look brother BR says when you look into the mirror what did you see do you see yourself this is the mirror the mirror of God word hallelujah when you look into it what do you see do you see anybody or yourself and who knows you better than yourself when God made known to you let me tell you there's no fear fear run from you because fear is of the devil fear is not of God let me tell you when even you don't have money you are not shaking you are not panicking you speak it you know you're going to get it because you know what everything God have for you is there already before you came here and you speak the things God have for you and bring it to you before you seen it because you listen let me tell you me I believe God God is real to me God I may not be a big preacher or that that but let me tell you Norman the point I reach can deceive me on the scriptures you can deceive me on the letter form but in inside my soul God speak to me and The God Who lead me from Africa jungle straight down all the way to North Africa come right to Europe come right to Canada Toronto you think that God will will let me down sir you think now you're going to let me down sir he's read to me as you are sitting he so real to me I'll go down my knees when I go down my knees I open my heart to him said Lord I don't know this this brother says so this sister says so this if I'm wrong I'm ready to repent so father show me let me tell you God does not lie I lie you lie any human being lie God is the only one that has in lie he will come he knows my heart better than any Humanity God knows my heart no human because we human being we hide we hide that's why sometime if you Pastor Simon knows a lot because he been preaching at the age of what 14 years you have seen people they look real like a Believer and as the word come and blow on that person all of a sudden sometime you see them wash away because what most of them they are cha they can't take the fire where the fire is they don't want to draw closer to the fire they want to stay away from the fire because a lot even in the message they love it but when the Holy Spirit that the L ghost passing through the mess age because they are not part they want to stay in the mess age which brother Braham preached the letter part brother Brown says I preach what Paul preach I ask some people go in the Bible where did Paul says if commit adultery in English word you cannot find it like that and yet the prophet said it he preached what Paul preached by Revelation amen that time it was the unwritten part of the word that the prophet was speaking it was written but it was hidden but God allowed him to bring it play and now the Bride As we have come we have to step in into the mind of God things that are hidden Hallelujah so that God will come and speak it and the same people that are saying they believe in brother Braham when you tell them if you believe in brother Braham you supposed to believe this there you see the war there you see the fight because why you are speaking the unwritten part of the word am because the letter the intellectuals has learned it they know it they can memorize it better than you and me but let me tell you our father Jesus said fear not little flog it is your father pleasure to give you the kingdom remember every sin must bring forth His Kind everything you need where is the word of God is already in you in the sea form before you were born but now as the water of the word come and water it come on it have to bring forth yes sir if is a true seed of God it will bring for as God has said am let me tell you fear not you go some places they try to use the prophet code to slap you left and right fear not amen just stand still because people has studied the message 24 hours they on it on computer on the letter part and they coting they'll make you look like you are Grand supper but don't worry but don't worry the Holy Spirit the father that dwell in you he who does the works it is not you going to do it I can do it you can do it the father that dwell in you the portion of the seed of the root of David when he himself choose to come out she will speak and and vindicate it right in front of that person you will see sometime they become dummy in front of you I have seen him many times because otherwise Who Am I who are you because God hide himself in what Simplicity and reveal himself the same way so fear not let it flop you are not chosen today don't esate yourself don't think you are small God sees you bigger than what you think God knows you more than what you think he has brought you here for a purpose his purpose is the seed in you will come to maturity the seed in you will make manifest the seed in you will bring forth after his own kind because every seed must bring forth after his kind and no matter what you do I do we are going to bring forth our kind and if you are a true seed of God let me tell you when Jesus was here he said something says I know my sheep he know all of his children from AEL to tribulation all those that going to come they are all in they are all his children what about those ones that won't come that are not his sheep that means those ones are what woman being by their serpent children they cannot come they will not come in Jesus said I know my sheep my sheep know my voice so the seed in you if it is of god you think he going to be lost you think he going to be somebody can twist it no man can twist that seed because God has spoken and God will perform it because you are a prophecy already before you get here do you know that you sitting here you are a prophecy I am a prophecy before I was born to this world Amen so that prophecy have to be fulfilled no matter what I think no matter what I do no matter what you do or think you will fulfill your prophecy H because God is telling you as the hour is drawing closer and closer know who you are let me tell you when you know who you are all fear gone I am not saying you're not going to get sick I am not saying you're not going to get H sometime short of money or things won't happen natural it will come but you don't even worry about it one bit because you know what all things work together to them that love what God and and because the seed in you is part of God you love God hallu the seed in you is Christ in you is your hope of what Glory so it can fail so it give you what rest it give you what peace it give you what an ankle it give you what future he give you what eternal life that seed is your everything because that seed no you put it there no your mother not your father not the church not a priest not a pope not a king but the Creator himself did it and once he has done it is for eternity is for what eternity do you know you are Eternal as God is eternal the seed in you I'm not speaking to the flesh those that are not Eternal they can come around the message do whatever they want but they not going to be inside but when it's revealed to you boldness Authority power strength energy oh my you begin to see you have conquered de you begin to see absent from this body present with the Lord you begin to see that while you are here you stand here you are in heaven you know where is Heaven any place Christ is Christ the lord is is Heavenly places and once you are part of him that's why he said you are born of my bone Spirit of my spirit Flesh of My what flesh so if you are born of his born Spirit of his spirit in the seed form in you don't you know everywhere Christ stand you stand there everything he conquer you were part of [Music] that recognize who you are do not just ordinary person walking on the street you not just coming here to eat die grow old and die and that's the end of you no you are more than what you think I know now I am not scared nothing nothing I'm scared of because Jesus when he was here he told them destroy this temple in three days I'll raise it up that sickness can destroy this Temple the seed in me part that is the word of God it will raise it up Hallelujah you said brother Kofi who are you to say that because that seed portion of the seed come from God Amen and God won't let his seed die God's seed cannot die and if the seed that raised up Jesus Christ dwell in you what it will do for you the SE that raised up Jesus Christ dwell in you don't you know that when your eyes close absent from this body present with the Lord if it becom so certain to you you are not even scared for if you are preaching and they put you let's say they put you in jail if they're going to even do anything with this flesh you don't even care because you know that you know you know God become real to you you become so certain because your eye is so single to the word of God it is you and Christ Christ and you the hope of glory brother Abraham while he was preaching he came to a point even all the gifts he came to a point he said this Bible has become a new Bible for me why because that time he has entered into his office he recognized who he is what God brought him here on Earth what he must do that he was a gentle Prophet for the seven Church age messenger the prophet came to that point that he wasn't sent here just for the miracle alone the miracle was just like eating bread giving them bread to eat and so is it with so many people they come to church they want to use the church for fish and bread this age and they will dress up right they will wear scare right the men will put tie right the men will dress right but the pastor can tell them to do anything in the church to help they TI they won't pay they are offering they won't pay to clean the church they won't do H to support anything in the church they won't do right fish and bread Christianity people no sir during the time of Joshua Joshua was a man with no nonsense Joshua was a man who straighten things up look to the people Li we going to Cross River Jordan we going this is not something we come here to play it's reality support it brother Brown says if this gospel is TR support it with all your heart all your mind all your soul everything you got for it and let's go forward [Music] am oh my my my my my yes support it because you know what you don't come here to joke you come here to seek God you you want to go to heaven you see is right because they were playing they were sleeping ishma doesn't sleep you know what ish type all of us know who is ishma once you sleep he is working and if you are blind you sleep the enemy doesn't sleep you joke the devil will struck you with all kinds of things but when you wake up the devil is always cared about you the devil knows you know who you are what you are raised up for now look when Israel wake up you see what the Palestinians are saying they running for cover and what their leaders are saying we're going to root heras out type of what Joshua we're going to go into the Promise Land and possess the land we're going to possess it we are not going to sleep because God has given us the land God is saying I will have my bride and I they will come to me I'll meet them in the drinking of an eye in the air so God says so we don't understand it we believe it amen that's settl it and let us move up because plain Church won't do it playing tricks will not do playing jokes will not do have fear have the word taking half of the word and fear mixed together won't do it right that means you become what lukewarm lukewarm Christianity won't do it but Hot Potato Hot Potato do the job then the devil is always scared of you the devil is always scared of a True Believer a True Believer who know who he is whether it's a brother or a sister the devil don't like you he'll try to take your life he always want to shorten your life he give you heart but you know what the more you do that the more you rejoice the more you lift up your heart and give the Lord Praise because you know and you recognize God is up to something big and you are part of it you are part of it because you know why you don't give him chance you are not just a chicken you are eager and eager eat hard meat hard hard meat anything that you do for the Lord do it with all of your heart oh otherwise don't do it you become a hypocrite because God don't want halfhearted halfhearted people that are like this no he want a solid what we woman we call Humble what is humble humble is you walking like this oh brother God bless you Sister God bless you it's nice but sometime do you know the devil hide behind that the devil hide behind that right like Jacob and Esau came that was the trick of Esau he was trying to use that to deceive his father but God says I Sease him I know I can see behind I I I can read I am God I can I know what's behind all that I know it do it from your heart if you going to be angry angry because Jacob he want the best right he would do anything to get it you think it was easy he look sometime in his brothers and sisters eye rough I think even the reason why Esau was able trying to deceive his father because Esau look holy in his father eye and Jacob look rough because Jacob you do something he not going to let it go he makes sure everything you try to hide he sees it no way get that thing out of me not until it's right that person I see it not until that is Spirit kind of spirit go out his father oh this my son too rough but what he didn't realize God has already revealed to Rebeca Jacob have I love Esau have I hate let's go to David David with his F father Jesse and the children the way Jake David look even his own father don't didn't like him he loved the big guys says this guy will be good for nothing let him put him to look for the Sheep just be in the bush he won't be good for nothing this one will be a good for Soldier for world this that but God has looked into Jacob High said this is the man after my own heart right a man after my own heart and when his time came for Samuel to anoint Jesse one of his son even the prophet Samuel wanted to anoint those brothers that are like giants God says no I didn't choose them no matter what they do I didn't choose them I have one reserve one his father has reject nobody knows about him even his father don't like him he push him in the bush he's like a rascal to him God says David you are that man he has already revealed to David what David was going to do so David God has let him kill a bear he has let him kill a lion already God has already who do you think did that you think it was David was God let me tell you a True [Music] Believer if you going to be a priest a pastor God will reveal to you before the before you become a pastor Pastor Salon knows that God will tell you before it become plain it's not just you going to say I'm going to be a pastor no that's why for me my life no matter what you do I'll never be a pastor no I will never ever something is not my position I am not going to step into it until God told me not until that not on my dead bones because when God revealed to you God will back you up he will vindicate you up because he will let a pill of fire come around you the church will see it that people will see it and know that this brother this man was not ordained by men he was ordained by the Lord Jesus Christ himself the Mighty God cuz God never lie we human beings lie so when Samuel chose wrong person God says no this is my anointing pour the oil on him for I have chosen to be the king of Israel and see no matter what Saul was doing or Israel was doing when David became a king see what he did what God instruction that he gave it to him he was able to accomplish it not because he have too much sense like the way we think all too much education I don't know back then whether they have highly education like today anyway but because God chose God won't fail him because he have already seen the person and design him his way of talking the way he move the way he would do things God all all his flaw is in Christ so God has know everything before he plac him the person to the people that's why the Rapture has taken so long because so many churches mess churches so many of them they are not choose by God I'm saying that few but let us fear not those ones that God has chosen in the message he going to make it plain at the day of Pentecost he made it what play right Judas wasn't part of it the root of David was not in Judas portion of the root of David for that day wasn't in Judas but those that have the portion of David which is representation of the pill of fire came and sat on their head and pro the 120 that they were the chosen one you and I we shouldn't have no fear no fear where we are walking no fear where we go because the holy spirit is within our heart he will make it plain he will identify himself that's why he says when you reach a place think not when they begin to question you ask you this that that think not what you shall say that moment your heavenly father who dwell in you will speak he will speak and make things plain hallu listen I know what God can do I was sitting here in the church one time even before Pastor Salon says I feel in my heart to go to Ghana with brother Kofi I want to work that time I was so poor I'm thinking how I'm going to get money till I have headache I'm working I can't work so I says okay forget it every time I go job I have to cover 20 H sofa chair love seat and I said I'm going home I come I used to live 2765 I walk in elevator I have seen the man before white man dress up with tie so many blacks were in the elevator the elevator close I turn my back God is my witness on the corner like that the man as soon as the elevator close he goes sir sir sir nobody people were turning their head but me my face on the elevator wall so I turn like this say sir I'm speaking to you I go what's he going to say say say I'm telling you you God call you you going to do this that that you going to Mission it will come don't don't worry God will bring him I go everybody the way he spoke everybody in the elevator was looking at me and I was thinking maybe he's lying or something I followed the mind to 11 floor elor jump he get out that Pastor Salon hasn't said nothing to me the man looked like he's going for the door somebody room I asked him said what am I supposed to do that going to come he says you don't need to do nothing just go your way it will come when it come don't think you can't read you can't write this is of the Lord he told me what exactly what I'm going to do so I said okay I run to my wife I told my wife a man told me this that that that that that in the house all of a sudden my headache was gone I tried to watch the man he go through the door like this back of the door step out gone I never see him again okay we were here I was here I don't know nothing I don't say that to nobody that time come in his heart he said it in the church he want to go Africa with me God plac in his heart he want to go to Africa Mission feeling with me I qu me that time said okay do you know it was exactly what the man told me come from the pastor Li Pastor don't know even up to today that I'm still saying this the man just told me so for me I know what I'm going to do I am not going to be here thinking even getting into the P bed if God don't call me here I will don't want it because I am not a person who going to do for popularity or for money or something no let him gather Glory only him only Jesus let my eyes see Jesus if I sit in the Pew if I clean the floor if I I have to warm the people for my brothers and sisters who brothers who can preach for me this is the place God sent me and this is the place I dwell this is the place I will support with all my heart I I know I am a part of Good Neighbor okay I know I am a part I know I am solid P God placed me here and nobody can move me me you can because even me I try many times the Lord says no you I put you here as a pillar you got to stay here for me and be a pillar for me you're going to do what I command you to do not what anybody wants but what I the Lord positionally Place you you're going to do it and it's him that's why me you give me any place of the Mery Church I can go maybe visit preach this that if the Lord want I I'm coming right back this is my gas station to fill my tank this is my gas station to fill my tank and charge and go forward cuz listen lot of people think oh I go here it's a Mery church I go here it's a mage I don't care what you got like brothers one told one brother his brothers back home and his Pastor that time you eating your food eat your food the Lord has given to you I'm eating my food why do you leave your food and come and look into my food what I'm getting here is enough it does the job for me I believe all my heart this gospel I have got here is taking me right home if I close even my head tonight I know where I'm going I am so certain that's why when you reach that point staying Hess you don't want yes unless something serious has happened right otherwise 24 hours you'll love to be in the church and hear the word of God hallelujah you don't take it lightly you are absolute you want to hear the word you are solid you are you are not black and white or yellow or green or this or that no if the church is going down something is going down you going down with it if the church is going up you going up with this because why you want God God has show you this is what I the Lord brought you for why do you want a change no God listen God knows me God knows me better than anybody so Brothers and sisters let us charge fear not God has brought you here fear not because not every place there are so many message churches and I'm saying that not every one of them is the true message which have the life inside it's all about the life it's all about the life and the life is passing through the message so catch that life that has passed through the
