[28:43] a royal priesthood
[28:46] and holy nation
[28:48] A peculiar people
[28:51] that yea should show forth the Praises
[28:55] of him who had called you out of
[28:58] Darkness
[28:59] into His Marvelous Light
[29:04] which in times past were not a people
[29:08] but now the people of God
[29:12] which have which had not obtained Mercy
[29:17] but now have obtained Mercy
[29:21] Hallelujah Colossians chapter 3 verse 1.
[29:37] if ye then be risen with Christ
[29:42] seek those things which are above
[29:46] where Christ sitteth on the right hand
[29:49] of God
[29:50] set your affections on things above not
[29:55] on things on the Earth
[29:58] for ye are dead and your life is hid
[30:03] with Christ in God
[30:06] when Christ who is our life shall appear
[30:09] then shall ye also appear with him in
[30:14] glory
[30:16] you may be seated God bless you
[30:19] Hallelujah
[30:21] identifying who we are in this last day
[30:25] the scripture says we are a chosen
[30:28] generation
[30:31] out of all the generations we have been
[30:35] chosen Amen to bring forth
[30:39] this end time word
[30:41] to bring forth a Rapture a body change
[30:45] in this day and age
[30:47] we are a royal priesthood
[30:50] and we know that priests Minister
[30:53] unto God
[30:55] we are called and identified
[30:59] to minister directly to God
[31:03] we don't come through any other channel
[31:05] we don't come through a denomination
[31:08] we don't come through the law but by
[31:10] Grace we Minister unto God
[31:14] a holy nation A peculiar people we're
[31:18] not we're not we're not we are different
[31:22] people believe me
[31:24] we and as time goes and as this word
[31:28] matures in US you're going to see more
[31:31] and more you don't fit in
[31:34] I know that my mind when I when I start
[31:36] thinking I'm just getting drawn away
[31:39] more and more into the word and the more
[31:42] farther I get into the word I realize
[31:45] the the farther I'm getting away from
[31:47] the world the farther I'm getting away
[31:50] from my flesh and the carnality more and
[31:53] more and that's what is prophesied and
[31:56] supposed to happen in our walks
[31:59] that's who we are identifying with in
[32:03] these last days is the word of God is
[32:06] identifying itself
[32:09] in US
[32:10] we don't have to in ourselves identify
[32:13] nothing the attribute the seed of God
[32:15] when it's awakened and it comes to life
[32:18] and is born again it starts identifying
[32:22] with itself
[32:23] God swore by himself it wasn't not
[32:27] nothing anymore under Abraham's Covenant
[32:30] that what we could do but it's what he
[32:33] has already done what he has completed
[32:35] what he has finished
[32:38] my word has been spoken my word will go
[32:42] forth and it will accomplish what I set
[32:45] forth it to do where's his word it's in
[32:49] you it's in me it's in living vessels
[32:53] today
[32:55] Hallelujah
[32:58] Ephesians 5 8 we're in a little bit of
[33:00] Bible study so we're gonna do a little
[33:02] bit of uh you know teaching a little bit
[33:04] of preaching
[33:06] Ephesians 5 8 for ye were sometimes
[33:10] Darkness
[33:12] but now yea our light in the Lord
[33:16] walk as children of light
[33:18] speak in the light
[33:20] let your actions your reactions be in
[33:25] the light let your conversations your
[33:28] words your thoughts be in the light
[33:32] you say oh I can't you can't stop
[33:37] what what Satan puts in your mind
[33:40] but it's what you're feeding on
[33:43] you don't realize everything carries
[33:45] like my mom said to me one time you talk
[33:48] like everything carries a spirit yes
[33:51] everything every influence that is out
[33:55] there in Satan Eden carries a spirit
[34:00] and we gotta watch what we're feeding on
[34:03] sometimes the thoughts in our mind that
[34:06] we battle with because the Bible says
[34:09] bring every thought captive to the word
[34:12] of God
[34:13] and you can only do that if you are a
[34:16] surrendered vessel and you're feeding on
[34:19] the things of God
[34:23] this is not my words it's the Bible
[34:28] you are sometimes Darkness
[34:31] see we walked in the flesh
[34:34] we were living in the flesh we some of
[34:38] us have a past
[34:40] in the flesh
[34:42] mistakes in the flesh
[34:45] things we've done in the past we walked
[34:48] in that Darkness
[34:49] but when the light come when the new
[34:53] birth came amen
[34:55] we now walk in light that Darkness has
[35:00] passed away
[35:02] I can testify by the grace of God in my
[35:06] own life that that darkness when I look
[35:09] back at my life
[35:11] it's not connected with me it's departed
[35:14] for me it's gone for me
[35:17] because I'm walking
[35:19] in his light
[35:22] in my life
[35:25] John 12 35
[35:28] then Jesus said unto them
[35:31] yet a little while is the light with you
[35:36] walk while ye have the light
[35:41] lest Darkness come upon you
[35:44] for he that walketh in darkness know it
[35:47] not whether he goeth
[35:49] he don't know who he is
[35:52] he can't find the Lord he can't find
[35:56] that place of rest and peace in his life
[36:00] and his mind because he's not walking in
[36:04] the light and it says right here that
[36:07] while a little time and we know that the
[36:12] time is short in this hour
[36:14] this is no time for fooling around this
[36:19] is no time if the Prof if the angel of
[36:22] God said to brother Branham back then be
[36:25] more sincere
[36:27] and he's seen this day how much more
[36:31] are we up here recognizing the
[36:35] manifestation of the word being
[36:37] fulfilled in modern events that are
[36:40] taking place in the world
[36:43] the light is only here for a little time
[36:47] Saints
[36:48] and I know that those who are of the
[36:52] light that are children of God will walk
[36:55] in the light they can do nothing else
[36:59] but walk in the light
[37:03] what is the true meaning of identity
[37:07] identity is a unique set of
[37:10] characteristics
[37:12] that can be used to identify a person
[37:15] as themselves
[37:17] and no one else
[37:19] the word can be used in different ways
[37:22] in different contexts
[37:25] on a personal level identity often
[37:28] refers to a person's self so sense
[37:32] of meaning
[37:34] how they view themselves
[37:37] as compared to others
[37:41] it's not about
[37:43] how we see ourselves
[37:46] it's not about
[37:48] viewing ourselves
[37:50] what other people see and how they see
[37:54] us
[37:55] not in Christ it's about how he sees us
[38:00] it's about what he has said about us not
[38:04] other people
[38:06] and not even ourselves what we think of
[38:08] ourselves
[38:09] that's where condemnations comes in when
[38:13] we start thinking about ourselves
[38:15] because one minute you can think you're
[38:16] doing great
[38:18] you're on top of the world you're a
[38:19] Christian one minute and the next minute
[38:21] you're not a Christian
[38:23] you're a sinner you're no good God get
[38:27] rid of me you see it testified many
[38:29] times in the Bible when they looked at
[38:32] themselves and thought what they thought
[38:34] of themselves and how they projected
[38:37] themselves
[38:38] and what they thought their identity was
[38:41] there's two identities here it's this
[38:44] human identity what we think of
[38:46] ourselves and what this world puts on us
[38:48] and there's God's identity
[38:56] what is identity
[38:58] simply speaking identity is a
[39:00] combination
[39:02] of your physical
[39:04] and behavioral traits
[39:06] that Define Who You Are
[39:09] for example your name is part of your
[39:11] identity
[39:12] now type it both back natural and
[39:15] spiritual
[39:17] as is the form of color of your eyes or
[39:21] your fingerprints
[39:23] this set of characteristics allows you
[39:27] to definitely and uniquely be
[39:31] recognizable
[39:33] and that's what it is
[39:36] these things identify who we are you
[39:38] don't you see me up here you look at me
[39:41] and you when you think of brother Tim
[39:44] you have a vision of me and what I look
[39:47] like because this identifies that name
[39:50] brother Tim beers
[39:52] but you don't see the real me
[39:56] you don't see the only way that you can
[39:59] see the real me or the word that's in me
[40:02] is when it manifestes and you have eyes
[40:06] to see that manifestation which we know
[40:10] the prophet said the bride has the
[40:13] ability to see that word in
[40:16] manifestation in action
[40:19] that's what gives her discernment how to
[40:22] walk
[40:25] yes
[40:30] what is identity and why is it so
[40:34] important
[40:36] have an identity can give you a sense of
[40:39] belonging
[40:41] which is important to your well-being
[40:43] and confidence
[40:45] now this is what they this was what
[40:47] they're saying out there there's there's
[40:49] so much positive mental speakers
[40:53] there's so much things written about
[40:56] being positive being confident being
[40:59] successful you are who you say you are
[41:04] there's all kinds you can there's
[41:07] thousands and thousands of things that
[41:09] people are feeding on out there
[41:12] but there is a crisis of our identity
[41:17] people are collapsing
[41:19] the more information and knowledge that
[41:22] there is out there that you can be the
[41:25] best that you can be is the worst that
[41:27] the people are getting
[41:29] because you cannot be anything
[41:32] outside of Christ it's Christ who makes
[41:36] us who we are
[41:41] Hallelujah
[41:47] instant identity identify changes
[41:51] shifts in our lives
[41:54] changes in our life happens throughout
[41:58] people are confronted with new
[42:00] challenges and Tackle different
[42:03] experiences
[42:05] thus an identity crisis can occur at any
[42:09] time
[42:11] in identity involves the experiences
[42:16] relationships beliefs and values and
[42:20] memories that make up a person's subject
[42:23] sense of self
[42:25] this help creates a continuous
[42:28] self-image that remains fairly constant
[42:31] even as new aspects of itself are
[42:36] developed or strengthened over time
[42:40] that's what
[42:41] they feed off of
[42:44] constantly
[42:46] trying to evolve in this
[42:52] in our society many people have a done
[42:55] easy crisis
[42:57] from the time we're born different
[43:00] voices tried to tell us who we are and
[43:04] what we are isn't that the truth
[43:07] we know about all these voices
[43:10] amen we know God is speaking to us and
[43:14] the devil's speaking to us just like he
[43:16] did in the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve
[43:19] lost their true identity
[43:22] when they listened to the devil's lie
[43:26] and Satan is the father of Lies and he
[43:31] puts lies everything he speak is a lie
[43:37] but we need to come to a place
[43:39] and recognize his voice and not listen
[43:43] to it
[43:45] because some people believe a lie
[43:49] and when they believe a lie it's very
[43:52] important because when you start
[43:54] believing not lies just like a Doctrine
[43:57] it's a rumor then it's a thought and
[44:00] then it's a saying then it becomes a
[44:03] Doctrine and a spirit comes behind that
[44:07] and what it leads the people away from
[44:10] the truth
[44:11] and that's the same order and process
[44:15] that Satan does with us to believe a lie
[44:18] about ourselves and our identity
[44:21] and he only has
[44:23] what does he have to use against us
[44:27] is our flesh is this carnal mind
[44:30] it's our mistakes
[44:33] it's our weaknesses that's all he has to
[44:35] use
[44:37] but when we come to a place when we
[44:39] recognize that's why when the bride
[44:41] recognizes who she is she's going to
[44:44] recognize these things these lies of the
[44:49] devil
[44:50] that he's trying to tell her
[44:53] she won't listen to those lies anymore
[44:59] look at transgender
[45:02] people
[45:04] how can I respect you for who you are
[45:07] they want you to respect them for who
[45:09] they are
[45:10] when they could not even accept
[45:14] and respect for who they were
[45:19] God made male and female
[45:22] period
[45:24] science testifies of it
[45:28] nature testifies of it
[45:31] there's only two genders two
[45:35] identifications that God created
[45:39] that's it
[45:43] that's it
[45:49] he reserves the right to tell us who we
[45:52] are
[45:54] Through the Bible we can see God
[45:56] changing people's identities
[45:59] see when God changes people's identities
[46:02] it's different
[46:05] but when Satan
[46:07] tells the people to change their
[46:08] identities what do you get you get that
[46:12] perversion that is happening out there
[46:15] and that that perversion comes through
[46:18] and is proven scientifically proven
[46:23] caused by mental illness
[46:26] and doesn't even the Bible says that
[46:29] he'll give them over to a reprobate mind
[46:32] to believe a lie about everything about
[46:37] genders about everything that is going
[46:39] on to make them manifest a perverted
[46:43] Spirit yes
[46:47] sure they believe it oh I believe that
[46:50] you know you know a grown man I believe
[46:53] that I'm a kid
[46:57] I believe I'm a dog
[47:00] so I should eat dog food and and live
[47:02] like a dog and stay home
[47:07] no this is true
[47:09] this is what's happening out there
[47:14] Hallelujah
[47:21] who God said we were because
[47:23] there was no evidence
[47:26] When God Says
[47:28] that existed in our lives when he told
[47:30] us who we were
[47:33] when he when we came in
[47:35] and God said you're my son you're my
[47:38] daughter
[47:39] you're the Bride of Jesus Christ
[47:42] the first thing we looked at is there's
[47:43] no evidence of that in our lives
[47:47] but God don't need your evidence
[47:49] God don't need you to prove him
[47:52] when he says who you are he's
[47:55] identifying Who You Are
[47:57] amen
[47:58] in this age of identification
[48:01] we are we are recognized by our
[48:04] identification in this age we must have
[48:06] a driver's license or a social insurance
[48:09] number a health card or some kind of
[48:12] identification to identify Who We Are
[48:15] we can't even cash a check without it
[48:18] well we know that this is a digital age
[48:20] now it's all about identification
[48:24] and we know that Satan is bringing his
[48:27] identification in with the new world
[48:30] order with all these things that are
[48:33] taking place
[48:35] Hallelujah and Jesus Christ is bringing
[48:38] his bride to her identification so
[48:42] there's two identifications that are
[48:44] taking place right now
[48:47] in this world
[48:49] Hallelujah
[48:52] it's not denomination
[48:54] that identifies her
[48:56] or religion
[48:58] but it's only the word made flesh that
[49:01] identifies the bride today
[49:03] outside of that revealed word by a
[49:06] prophet she can never find her
[49:08] identification perfect faith lies in the
[49:12] tapes and only can be revealed by the
[49:15] spirit
[49:16] and only reveal to the elected that are
[49:19] predestinated to receive it
[49:22] that's it they're the only ones that God
[49:26] is identifying himself with in this day
[49:28] is the elected predestinated seed
[49:32] and he is and will more and more
[49:36] identify her to the world that's what he
[49:39] said I'll make I'll do uh I I won't make
[49:42] a public show but I will show her off
[49:44] there will be a quick sweet move of the
[49:47] word of God in her life
[49:49] people are going to recognize even in
[49:52] this message there's something different
[49:53] about her
[49:55] the way she walks the way she talks the
[49:58] Supernatural is just gonna move around
[49:59] her life
[50:01] and manifest it's going to be effortless
[50:06] things being revealed constantly I'll
[50:10] show you things to come I'll show you my
[50:13] manifestation
[50:15] oh yes that's the hour we're living in
[50:18] that's what we're moving into
[50:20] God needs consecrated separated
[50:24] Hearts lives
[50:27] just like it was spoke on Sunday molding
[50:30] and shaping and chipping that stone
[50:33] chipping you
[50:34] pulling you out
[50:37] pulling you out bringing you in
[50:40] to be locked behind that inner Veil
[50:44] where the world can't get you
[50:47] the world behind their silence
[50:52] you want to live a life
[50:54] of Silence of this world
[50:58] people plagued people tormented in their
[51:01] minds in this message from the world and
[51:04] the noise of the world
[51:06] but God is calling you behind the inner
[51:09] Veil where it's all quiet from the world
[51:12] where it's just his Pillar of Fire the
[51:15] glory of his light and his word being
[51:18] revealed that's where he wants you to
[51:21] walk with him there
[51:24] it's going to take a sacrifice yes it's
[51:28] going to take a dying out yes
[51:30] die in Daily Paul says to the things
[51:34] that try to identify us
[51:37] this flesh is always trying to identify
[51:41] but it's the wrong identification
[51:45] and I do not identify with it only what
[51:48] the word of God says
[51:52] in this life sometimes we think
[51:56] we are artists accountants teachers
[52:00] truck drivers business owners mothers
[52:04] or we think is what we have achieved
[52:07] in life that identifies us
[52:11] we might be honored students when all
[52:13] kinds of rewards Achieve Financial
[52:16] success
[52:18] or by the things we've done right
[52:21] or by the things we've done wrong in
[52:23] life
[52:25] or I am what others think of me
[52:29] and their opinions of me
[52:31] but what does God think of me
[52:34] how does God identify us
[52:38] you say you you say that
[52:41] you know brother Tim listen we're
[52:43] dealing with every level of Faith here
[52:45] every level of believer here
[52:47] people still
[52:49] are battling with this
[52:52] battling with all these things here
[52:56] thinking that oh you fail in life you
[53:00] don't you're not successful in your
[53:02] finances you're not you know in your job
[53:05] you look at your job that identifies you
[53:07] how good you do on your job
[53:09] how good you are at home as a mother all
[53:13] these things as a student if you don't
[53:15] have uh top grades or all the success
[53:20] that you had
[53:21] all the awards that you won or you
[53:24] didn't win
[53:26] all these things try to identify us
[53:29] and people still battle with these
[53:32] things
[53:33] in a lot of different areas in our lives
[53:35] but God is speaking those things do not
[53:39] identify you
[53:41] when I have awakened you and I have
[53:44] called you and I've spoken to you it's
[53:47] my word it's what I have done that I
[53:50] will do in your life identifies Who You
[53:52] Are
[53:58] we sing the song this world is not my
[54:00] home I'm just this world
[54:02] is not my home and anything in it
[54:07] it has no right
[54:09] I'll tell you the truth it has no right
[54:12] to interpret it has no right to try to
[54:15] identify
[54:17] or put any kind of identification on the
[54:20] Bride of Jesus Christ
[54:21] She Belongs to the Lord Jesus Christ and
[54:25] the word and the word only
[54:28] nobody can touch it
[54:30] nobody can touch this word
[54:33] no man can touch this word
[54:37] it's only God
[54:41] for examples
[54:43] in the Bible
[54:46] where people
[54:49] who thought they were nothing
[54:53] but God said differently you look at
[54:56] Gideon
[54:58] a mighty man of Valor
[55:01] when he was defeated and hiding from the
[55:03] enemy
[55:04] but God called them something different
[55:08] God was identifying him
[55:11] but he didn't identify himself like that
[55:18] you see when when you get into God's
[55:21] mind
[55:21] and you think as God thinks it changes
[55:25] things
[55:27] it'll change your life
[55:30] when you I know it it sounds funny
[55:34] come on brother Tim
[55:36] we're in a message preach it like this
[55:39] but when you believe what God says to
[55:42] you you are
[55:43] truly believe it
[55:45] it brings light to you it changes you
[55:50] you don't even recognize until God
[55:52] reveals it what you're believing about
[55:55] yourself
[55:56] and how you're seeing yourself
[55:59] and every time you look and you think a
[56:02] negative thought or you think you're not
[56:03] worthy you're identifying yourself
[56:06] you're putting identification on
[56:08] yourself that God did not put on there
[56:16] many times God calls us
[56:18] things that there is no physical
[56:21] evidence to support
[56:23] then he's say in the book of Hebrews now
[56:25] Faith is the substance of things hoped
[56:27] for for the evidence of Things Not Seen
[56:32] that's where God moves in that Realm and
[56:36] when you receive faith and God speaks to
[56:39] your heart
[56:40] when you receive it by faith like that
[56:44] there's no evidence but God said there's
[56:47] evidence there he just spoke to me and
[56:49] told me that it is there go get the land
[56:54] go do it I have called you do it
[56:59] when he says there's evidence there
[57:02] that's where we walk by faith not by
[57:07] sight
[57:09] God's evidence is what we walk by
[57:16] Hallelujah
[57:18] since he is God he reserves a right as
[57:21] Creator to reveal to us how he sees us
[57:25] and what he sees in US
[57:29] he changed Abram's name to Abraham
[57:33] which means father of many
[57:36] we can preach a whole sermon on
[57:38] Abraham's life many sermons
[57:42] when he had no children
[57:45] you see there was no evidence
[57:48] we know what he went through
[57:51] we know the process of faith that he
[57:54] went through the battles he went through
[57:56] the trying and the testing of time that
[57:59] he went through
[58:01] there's no evidence of him being a
[58:03] father of many Nation no evidence of a
[58:06] child even as it got worse and worse and
[58:09] Sarah became barren
[58:11] past the age
[58:13] but God said differently
[58:16] God identified Abraham as the father of
[58:20] many nations
[58:22] and he identifies Abraham's seed today
[58:26] with that same kind of Faith to bring
[58:29] forth not that a child but bring forth
[58:33] this word born in US
[58:37] Hallelujah
[58:40] amen Sarah I
[58:43] name was changed to Sarah
[58:45] which means princess
[58:48] Jacob's name was changed from deceiver
[58:51] to Israel
[58:53] which means Prince with God
[58:56] oh we were Liars we were cheaters we
[58:58] were deceivers oh yes our name was
[59:01] identified with all these things but he
[59:04] changed our name when he called me amen
[59:08] he called me by his grace and revealed
[59:11] himself to me he gave me a new name
[59:16] and change my identity
[59:19] oh my people don't really know you your
[59:22] family don't really know you
[59:24] we're talking Fellowship many times you
[59:27] get together and you try to you know do
[59:29] the natural things with family and that
[59:31] stuff but they don't know who you are
[59:33] they don't know what's happening inside
[59:35] what's what what you believe inside your
[59:38] heart
[59:45] these are all people that hide identity
[59:48] changes
[59:49] to carry spiritual inheritance God
[59:53] wanted them to carry
[59:55] in the same way we must have identity
[59:58] changed and fulfill our destiny and the
[1:00:01] plan that God has for us there are all
[1:00:04] kinds of seeds today
[1:00:06] there are Incorruptible seeds there are
[1:00:09] corruptable seeds there are seeds of God
[1:00:11] and there are seeds of the devil the
[1:00:14] serpent seed there are seeds that are
[1:00:17] alive and there are seeds that are dead
[1:00:21] regardless of what ground it falls on
[1:00:25] every seed must bring forth of its own
[1:00:28] kind because in the seed Awakening
[1:00:32] manifestes its identification
[1:00:35] Cain had to manifest his identification
[1:00:38] Judas had the Manifest his
[1:00:40] identification Esau had to manifest his
[1:00:43] identification
[1:00:45] and so does the Sons and Daughters of
[1:00:47] God have to manifest their
[1:00:48] identification
[1:00:50] oh yes this is the hour
[1:00:52] you can't escape it you can't run from
[1:00:55] it
[1:00:56] all seeds are bringing forth in this
[1:00:58] hour of its own kind
[1:01:01] oh my
[1:01:03] and what a glorious thing when you start
[1:01:05] recognizing what seed you're of
[1:01:08] oh what a glorious time
[1:01:10] brother Brandon one in a million like I
[1:01:13] was saying the other day there there's
[1:01:15] been a hundred billion people that exist
[1:01:17] on this Earth so far they're saying
[1:01:20] and
[1:01:22] one out of a million is born
[1:01:26] think of how many
[1:01:29] did not come into existence
[1:01:32] I'm talking Naturally Speaking
[1:01:35] billions and trillions did not even come
[1:01:38] into existence
[1:01:40] and then here we are in this last day
[1:01:44] called out predestinated
[1:01:48] in this hour to see this truth to see
[1:01:50] this word you see why God is so
[1:01:52] determined
[1:01:54] you see why he won't let go of your life
[1:01:56] you see why he won't let you do the
[1:01:58] things that you think you want to do or
[1:02:00] you think is right to do you see why
[1:02:03] he's taking so much control over your
[1:02:05] life and putting such restrictions on
[1:02:07] your life restrictions on your thoughts
[1:02:10] and your thinking and your words and
[1:02:12] where you go what you listen to what you
[1:02:14] look at
[1:02:16] you will never have rest
[1:02:19] I don't care if you call this legalistic
[1:02:21] or not you will never have rest until
[1:02:24] you surrender to his voice to his will
[1:02:28] and stop doing the things that he's
[1:02:30] telling you not to do
[1:02:32] everyone is made up differently
[1:02:35] God knows us individually he knows what
[1:02:39] we can handle he says I won't give you
[1:02:41] anything more than what you you as an
[1:02:44] individual can handle
[1:02:46] don't look at what brother Tim does
[1:02:48] don't look at her brother Danny or
[1:02:50] brother Simon or anything that Brothers
[1:02:52] do
[1:02:53] look at what you do look what God's
[1:02:55] speaking to you to do
[1:03:01] Hallelujah
[1:03:03] we did not become seed
[1:03:06] by the rebirth
[1:03:09] see there's a greater Revelation with
[1:03:11] predestination
[1:03:13] like we're Way Beyond that we one day we
[1:03:15] came to the Altar and we were saved way
[1:03:17] beyond that
[1:03:19] they're not out there but we are here
[1:03:24] and then
[1:03:25] being born again
[1:03:27] The Awakening took place in our lives
[1:03:31] but that is even not it
[1:03:35] listen what Brother Brad I'm speaking
[1:03:37] here and the Sumerian Church age
[1:03:40] we did not become seed by the rebirth we
[1:03:43] were seed and therefore were reburned
[1:03:46] reborn again
[1:03:47] for only the elect can be reborn
[1:03:51] because we were seed is the reason we
[1:03:54] could be quickened
[1:03:57] in a non-seed there is nothing to be
[1:04:01] quickened
[1:04:03] nothing in there to be quickened
[1:04:07] but in a seed of God
[1:04:10] there's something to be quickened and if
[1:04:12] God quickened me and I recognize in my
[1:04:16] own life you recognize in your own life
[1:04:18] that God quickened the seed the word
[1:04:22] inside of you and he's changed you
[1:04:25] how do you know brother Brian I'm in the
[1:04:27] token message they said brother Branham
[1:04:29] how do we know we got the token because
[1:04:31] he said you must have the token you must
[1:04:35] have the token
[1:04:36] he says you changed didn't you
[1:04:40] your desires changed didn't it
[1:04:43] you you have you can see spiritually
[1:04:46] that you can live above sin which is
[1:04:48] unbelief in your life then don't you
[1:04:51] he says there it is
[1:04:52] now keep moving with it keep growing
[1:04:55] with it keep feeding it
[1:04:57] keep feeding that
[1:04:59] we come in here we hear the word of God
[1:05:01] we get strengthened we get encouraged
[1:05:03] you wonder why people lose the victory
[1:05:06] you wonder why because they come and
[1:05:09] they get fed they get encouraged and
[1:05:11] they go out there and they start
[1:05:12] listening to the world
[1:05:15] and everything that evolves around their
[1:05:18] life all the dentifications
[1:05:21] that are trying to identify them they
[1:05:23] listen to the wrong voices
[1:05:25] and that's how they lose the victory
[1:05:27] but if you can get into a place I know
[1:05:29] what what did it for me is that when
[1:05:31] that word opened up and it started
[1:05:33] delivering me by Supernatural
[1:05:36] experiences one after another all I
[1:05:39] could do is feed on that word more and
[1:05:42] more I didn't realize what I was doing
[1:05:44] but it was identifying me amen it was
[1:05:47] showing my identification show me who I
[1:05:49] am amen show me my calling and I just
[1:05:53] kept feeding on that more and more call
[1:05:56] me a fanatic that is good I'd rather be
[1:05:58] a fanatic for this than a fanatic for
[1:06:00] that because you're either going to be
[1:06:01] one or another you're either going to be
[1:06:03] influenced from above or below like it
[1:06:06] or not that's the truth
[1:06:12] Hallelujah
[1:06:14] glory to God Galatians 3 6.
[1:06:19] now to Abraham and his Seed where the
[1:06:21] promise made to overcome
[1:06:25] we will live
[1:06:27] and not die
[1:06:29] we will be raptured
[1:06:32] we will come to perfect faith
[1:06:35] and perfect realization of who we are in
[1:06:38] him
[1:06:39] it's the bride's identification in this
[1:06:43] hour we will
[1:06:45] there will be a bride without spot
[1:06:49] without wrinkle
[1:06:51] and it's not because of what you think
[1:06:54] it's not because of what you think in
[1:06:56] your life is because of what God has
[1:06:58] spoken he will bring it to pass
[1:07:02] you're here tonight you look back at
[1:07:05] things in your life that you thought at
[1:07:07] the time that you couldn't overcome and
[1:07:10] here you are tonight and you look back
[1:07:12] and you overcome that
[1:07:13] what made you overcome that not you
[1:07:16] not how much you prayed how much you
[1:07:19] fast how much confidence that you had
[1:07:21] it's the life inside of you
[1:07:24] that overcame
[1:07:26] amen
[1:07:28] look in John
[1:07:30] First John 3 9.
[1:07:33] what is scripture
[1:07:35] whosoever is born of God do it not
[1:07:37] commit sin for his seed remaineth in him
[1:07:41] and he cannot sin because he's born of
[1:07:45] God
[1:07:48] when we recognize we will
[1:07:53] the difference
[1:07:55] between
[1:07:57] the attribute the seed and the flesh
[1:08:00] there's going to be great victory
[1:08:04] in her
[1:08:06] there's going to be great victory in
[1:08:08] your life
[1:08:09] because the seed
[1:08:11] that's what God sees and God don't see
[1:08:15] sin
[1:08:17] it cannot sin that inside of me
[1:08:22] so when this sins
[1:08:25] when this makes Mrs makes a mistake
[1:08:29] I don't identify this mistake or this
[1:08:33] sin with this inside
[1:08:36] no I don't
[1:08:38] this cannot sin but this can so what
[1:08:42] this does is goes to the father goes to
[1:08:46] the atonement goes to the blood and says
[1:08:49] wash this away
[1:08:54] when you walk by faith in that kind of
[1:08:58] perfect faith in this hour
[1:09:00] you see how this great work Supernatural
[1:09:04] is going to take place you see how
[1:09:06] Christ is going to come and do what he
[1:09:09] said he's going to do in the bride and
[1:09:10] manifest on her
[1:09:12] this hinders too much
[1:09:15] this gets in the way and God has been
[1:09:18] dealing with that circumstance in every
[1:09:21] one of our lives from day one trying to
[1:09:25] separate the flesh from the attribute
[1:09:27] the flesh from the seed
[1:09:32] and then when it is separated and you
[1:09:35] just believing and having faith in what
[1:09:38] God said you are the seed of God
[1:09:41] then you start moving and walking in
[1:09:44] that kind of power
[1:09:46] oh my
[1:09:49] look what he says here
[1:09:51] in uh the first seal
[1:09:53] every born-again believer
[1:09:56] is perfectly absolutely sinless before
[1:09:59] God
[1:10:00] identification
[1:10:04] is this not words this is identification
[1:10:08] he is not trusted in his works
[1:10:10] but in the blood of Jesus
[1:10:12] the Bible said he that is born of God
[1:10:14] does not commit sin for he cannot sin
[1:10:17] how can you make a man a sinner when the
[1:10:21] bleach blood
[1:10:23] of Jesus Christ is between him and God
[1:10:27] that's what I just said
[1:10:29] the blood is between me this and God
[1:10:34] God inside God in the seed the blood is
[1:10:38] between
[1:10:40] Hallelujah the blood is in between
[1:10:44] there's a recognizing there's a
[1:10:46] realization in her that there's a blood
[1:10:49] in between it means everything to Earth
[1:10:52] it's life and death to her
[1:10:55] that's what this gospel is to her life
[1:10:58] and death
[1:10:59] it's not a game it's not religion it's
[1:11:03] not just trying to be good
[1:11:06] it's life and death with her
[1:11:10] she must have the token she like like
[1:11:15] Jacob wrestled with the angel she must
[1:11:19] have the blessing the blessing of who
[1:11:21] she is
[1:11:22] to recognize who she is to recognize his
[1:11:25] word to recognize the word in her
[1:11:29] that's all that matters to her
[1:11:31] that's all that the desire is in her
[1:11:34] heart
[1:11:36] that's what's in the bride's heart
[1:11:39] that's what the word the spirit of God
[1:11:41] in this age is leading her to
[1:11:45] and everybody outside of that
[1:11:47] will be left behind
[1:11:50] that is the rapture in her
[1:11:53] Hallelujah
[1:11:55] amen
[1:11:57] how can that pure blood of Christ ever
[1:12:00] let a sin pass there he cannot
[1:12:04] Jesus said be perfect even as your
[1:12:06] father in Heaven is perfect
[1:12:09] how could we even start the thought of
[1:12:12] being perfect because we can't
[1:12:14] he said how can we
[1:12:17] that's us identifying to us we can never
[1:12:20] we can never with our own mind even
[1:12:23] start the process of the thought of
[1:12:26] being perfect that's why so many people
[1:12:28] stumble over it but let me tell you I am
[1:12:32] perfect
[1:12:33] as my heavenly father is perfect
[1:12:36] it depends what you're looking at
[1:12:38] well I know brother Tim
[1:12:40] no you don't
[1:12:42] no you don't do you know this
[1:12:44] identification you don't know brother
[1:12:45] Tim
[1:12:46] no you don't
[1:12:49] he only he
[1:12:52] Hallelujah
[1:12:54] amen
[1:12:56] but Jesus required it and if he required
[1:12:58] it he's got to make a way for it and he
[1:13:01] did that's what we're talking about he
[1:13:04] made a way
[1:13:05] Amen on a day of Pentecost he revealed
[1:13:08] it he made a way he came back
[1:13:11] he came back in this day amen
[1:13:15] that's what the cloud the mighty angel
[1:13:18] that was up front he made a way he came
[1:13:20] back he's here
[1:13:23] he's here now
[1:13:28] they're coming today where the bride
[1:13:30] will be the same example that he was
[1:13:34] word made Flesh on this on the earth
[1:13:36] when he read the scriptures and he said
[1:13:39] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:13:41] before your ears and in your sight
[1:13:45] he's gonna do it again
[1:13:49] and not everybody in this message is
[1:13:51] going to accept it
[1:13:53] because there's denominational burials
[1:13:56] in people's minds spirits of doctrines
[1:13:59] of devils that are here that are trying
[1:14:02] to take that away from the bride but
[1:14:05] brother Brown said the bride can never
[1:14:07] be denominated she will be free to bring
[1:14:10] forth this Living Word and what does
[1:14:12] that mean she in the word have become
[1:14:15] one and the same it will be him and her
[1:14:18] speaking him and her living him and her
[1:14:20] speaking through her
[1:14:23] and believe in what they're believing
[1:14:25] out there oh God God said a prophet we
[1:14:28] just got to listen to the tapes we've
[1:14:30] got to listen to that it's all good it's
[1:14:31] all part of the process but they put a
[1:14:34] period they have a truth they put a
[1:14:37] period Thunders period
[1:14:39] prusa period
[1:14:42] two Soul period anything with a period
[1:14:45] stops
[1:14:47] that truth from marching on
[1:14:51] that's the denominator there is no
[1:14:52] period with the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:14:55] it's just word revealing truth unveiling
[1:14:59] over and over and over again
[1:15:03] that's what it's all about
[1:15:07] yes it's eternity it's moving and
[1:15:11] revealing I know more today than I know
[1:15:13] yesterday about myself and him
[1:15:17] Hallelujah
[1:15:21] spiritually speaking we must carry legal
[1:15:24] identification to do business in the
[1:15:27] spiritual Realm
[1:15:28] the Bible contains our official legal
[1:15:31] identification to become aware of who
[1:15:35] you are in Christ the word of God must
[1:15:38] be engrafted into the inner man through
[1:15:41] Revelation the anointing of the holy
[1:15:44] spirit is the guaranteed that we are who
[1:15:48] God says we are
[1:15:50] and we have what God says we have
[1:15:55] everything he says we have we have
[1:15:58] and we are who he says we are
[1:16:08] Hallelujah
[1:16:11] even the devil knows who you are
[1:16:15] or if you're a child of God he knows who
[1:16:16] you are
[1:16:18] when you have been born again look at
[1:16:20] Acts 19 tells us of a story of the Seven
[1:16:24] Sons of Siva who tried to cast out a
[1:16:27] devil
[1:16:28] in the name of Jesus whom Paul preached
[1:16:33] I cast out this devil because brother
[1:16:35] Branham said so
[1:16:37] I can do this because brother Branham
[1:16:39] said so
[1:16:44] the demons are not stupid
[1:16:47] there's a lot of sorry
[1:16:52] it was
[1:16:55] the demons said Jesus we know and Paul
[1:16:58] we know but who are you
[1:17:03] nobody in Hell identified you
[1:17:06] but Jesus was identified in heaven and
[1:17:10] in hell and Paul was identified in
[1:17:13] heaven and in hell
[1:17:15] and so are we
[1:17:17] just as much identified in heaven we are
[1:17:21] identified in hell
[1:17:23] oh yes
[1:17:24] you say oh brother I'm scared I'm scared
[1:17:27] no no no I want to be identified because
[1:17:29] if I'm identified down there oh that
[1:17:32] means there's something greater inside
[1:17:34] of me Hallelujah
[1:17:37] Oh Glory to God
[1:17:39] amen
[1:17:41] Hallelujah this word is doing something
[1:17:44] great inside of her something great
[1:17:48] Hallelujah
[1:17:50] amen thank you Lord let us move on here
[1:17:53] I got 15 more minutes and I'm going to
[1:17:55] use it
[1:17:57] hallelujah thank you Lord Satan wants to
[1:18:01] hide your identity
[1:18:02] he wants to confuse your identity
[1:18:05] he wants to deceive you in believing in
[1:18:08] a lie about your true identity we know
[1:18:11] that that's been his battle
[1:18:13] and if if Satan has battled you then
[1:18:16] thank God he has battled you because
[1:18:18] there's something if he's not after you
[1:18:21] he's already got you
[1:18:23] he's got you sealed up but if he's after
[1:18:25] you constantly
[1:18:27] constant battles in your mind
[1:18:30] that means there's something
[1:18:33] inside of you
[1:18:35] Hallelujah
[1:18:39] Satan's the perverter of the truth
[1:18:42] he uses hate pain trauma bitterness and
[1:18:46] other people's opinions to try to take
[1:18:49] away your identity in Christ the
[1:18:51] greatest battle ever fought is in the
[1:18:54] mind our thoughts create our words and
[1:18:57] our words create our identity
[1:19:01] that's why God sent a message to the
[1:19:05] church
[1:19:06] which was the greatest battle ever
[1:19:09] fought and that process is still going
[1:19:13] on today
[1:19:15] brother Brown I'm talking back then that
[1:19:17] process that fight started with Michael
[1:19:19] and the Archangel and Lucifer and he
[1:19:23] said it's going on today let me tell you
[1:19:25] it's in the greatest hype of that war in
[1:19:29] this hour
[1:19:30] because never has there been an hour
[1:19:33] We're God hallelujah is going to take
[1:19:36] over our people
[1:19:38] amen and produce a rapture
[1:19:43] a body change
[1:19:48] now where the battle begins brother
[1:19:49] Brown is speaking here
[1:19:51] I want you to recognize this process
[1:19:53] here
[1:19:56] we need to hear it over and over again
[1:19:58] until and God will continue just like
[1:20:01] you with a child
[1:20:04] you tell your child over and over and
[1:20:06] over again to what
[1:20:08] to what
[1:20:11] why do you tell your child
[1:20:13] you can be a participator here you know
[1:20:15] not just a sub you know why do you tell
[1:20:18] your child over and over and over again
[1:20:21] so they can listen so they can obey
[1:20:25] that's why you do that
[1:20:27] and that's why God keeps speaking his
[1:20:29] word over and over and over again you're
[1:20:32] going to realize two things when you get
[1:20:34] there you're going to realize how small
[1:20:36] Satan really was
[1:20:38] I was afraid of that
[1:20:42] well you're going to realize that here
[1:20:44] because once you overcome this thing and
[1:20:46] realize this thing is not of you
[1:20:48] then when he tries to do whatever he
[1:20:50] tries to do in this flesh you're going
[1:20:52] to realize that's not me
[1:21:03] to take away your identity in Christ the
[1:21:06] greatest battle of what now listen now
[1:21:09] where the battle begins right in your
[1:21:11] mind now remember it's not Christian
[1:21:12] Science Mind Over Matter
[1:21:15] that's what we do sometimes we try to
[1:21:17] mind over matter it's not about that
[1:21:19] Saints
[1:21:21] it's not how much you can you know think
[1:21:23] this think that or try to think positive
[1:21:25] it's not about that
[1:21:27] we don't realize that we do that
[1:21:28] sometimes the mind
[1:21:31] accepts the life
[1:21:34] which is the word of God
[1:21:36] and there brings the life
[1:21:40] just your thought doesn't do it
[1:21:44] very strong very powerful when it opens
[1:21:46] up to you it does not do it no other
[1:21:50] process does this
[1:21:52] there's only one channel and one process
[1:21:55] is your mind accepts the life the word
[1:22:02] the word of God brought through the
[1:22:04] channel of your thoughts see
[1:22:07] I love when he says that if you go back
[1:22:09] and you read you if you're familiar with
[1:22:11] brother Brown's message and you read it
[1:22:13] you'll see he says see constantly C it's
[1:22:17] not the thought
[1:22:20] but it's the channel
[1:22:22] that
[1:22:23] but your mind accepts it it grasp it
[1:22:27] it's good you're it's good to grasp the
[1:22:30] word it's good to
[1:22:34] what is your mind controlled by
[1:22:37] your spirit
[1:22:39] and your spirit catches the word of God
[1:22:42] and that's the thing that's got life in
[1:22:45] it it brings life into you
[1:22:48] okay
[1:22:50] let's he's going to start getting into
[1:22:52] the spirit now okay my mind grasped it
[1:22:54] and then it brings through the channel
[1:22:56] to my spirit okay
[1:22:59] that should be simple right
[1:23:01] I do that all the time hmm
[1:23:04] when that takes place when life comes
[1:23:07] down that channel into you the word of
[1:23:09] God is manifested in you if you abide in
[1:23:12] me and my words abide in you then ask
[1:23:14] what you will and it will be done
[1:23:17] from the middle of the heart which is
[1:23:19] the soul from there goes out forth feed
[1:23:24] in every channel
[1:23:26] all the senses
[1:23:29] the word of God is feeding but listen he
[1:23:33] says right here
[1:23:34] in all these channels
[1:23:37] that the word of God is supposed to go
[1:23:38] forth that life is supposed to come
[1:23:41] forth
[1:23:42] he said the trouble of it here it is we
[1:23:46] are standing here with a lot of Doubt
[1:23:49] trying to accept that that what is out
[1:23:52] there the word of God
[1:23:55] he says we've got to get rid of that
[1:23:58] that doubt
[1:24:00] in those senses
[1:24:03] in the spirit
[1:24:06] that dealt sometimes we got to go to war
[1:24:10] in our spirit
[1:24:12] go to war take the word of God within
[1:24:15] ourselves and take the word and chop
[1:24:18] your way through that devil of doubt
[1:24:21] that's in your spirit
[1:24:24] every time the word god comes up a
[1:24:26] memory comes up a conscience comes up a
[1:24:29] feeling comes up emotion comes up and
[1:24:32] rubs you from that word you gotta go and
[1:24:36] recognize that and go into prayer
[1:24:38] sometimes fasting things are not cast
[1:24:41] out but by prayer and fasting in your
[1:24:44] life
[1:24:46] These Are Soldiers
[1:24:48] these are children of God
[1:24:52] this is what we're called to
[1:24:56] not to play Church Message Church
[1:25:00] I belong to the message
[1:25:03] I'm in a message Church
[1:25:05] my pastor's anointed preacher
[1:25:08] that's all gone that ain't going to
[1:25:11] produce this
[1:25:13] no way not in this hour
[1:25:18] the trouble is you're standing here with
[1:25:20] a lot of Doubt trying to accept what's
[1:25:21] out there you've got to stop that and
[1:25:23] come down the Channel with the true word
[1:25:25] of God and then goes out
[1:25:28] of itself automatically
[1:25:32] when you say no
[1:25:34] when you die to that certain thing and
[1:25:36] you say I accept the word
[1:25:39] all you you think is easy
[1:25:42] to die
[1:25:43] you think it's easy
[1:25:46] when God comes and tells you
[1:25:49] I'm just saying late examples to stop
[1:25:51] doing this stop going there
[1:25:54] change this in your life change that in
[1:25:56] your life
[1:25:57] don't speak this way
[1:26:00] don't do this this way
[1:26:02] don't behave don't act whatever it is
[1:26:08] and you have to die to that
[1:26:10] but let me tell you until you die to
[1:26:12] that you're not going to get more of
[1:26:14] Christ that you are seeking for
[1:26:17] that must die
[1:26:21] there must be a death in that area of
[1:26:25] your life
[1:26:26] that is the thing
[1:26:28] that's making you stagnated that is the
[1:26:31] thing that's holding you back
[1:26:33] and you know what your conscious God
[1:26:36] speaks into every conscience and even
[1:26:39] morsel to the bride your conscious
[1:26:42] identifies with that with his voice
[1:26:46] in that area
[1:26:48] oh brother Simon brother Tim brother
[1:26:50] Danny might not speak speak specifically
[1:26:53] what it is but the word of God the
[1:26:55] spirit of God it's his spirit is it
[1:26:58] discerner and thoughts and tends of your
[1:27:00] heart
[1:27:04] you won't get the victory until you die
[1:27:08] to that thing and Let It Go
[1:27:11] that's been my only process in my walk
[1:27:16] in my growth in God and in the spirit
[1:27:19] and in Revelation outside of the gift in
[1:27:22] my life my personal walk and personal
[1:27:26] Victory with Jesus Christ which there
[1:27:29] must be
[1:27:32] is that process and that's what he's
[1:27:35] talking about here
[1:27:36] that's what he's breaking down here
[1:27:39] Hallelujah
[1:27:42] let me just start winding this down real
[1:27:44] quickly
[1:27:45] I got a lot more to say but we're going
[1:27:47] to do another part
[1:27:48] identity theft is a big thing in this
[1:27:51] world today
[1:27:53] oh my isn't it
[1:27:55] oh big thing
[1:27:58] but Satan can never steal it
[1:28:02] or you can never lose it when you got it
[1:28:04] with Christ
[1:28:06] he can't take that away
[1:28:08] he can try to steal everybody's identity
[1:28:10] in a natural REM whatever but he's one
[1:28:13] thing he can't steal tonight is that
[1:28:15] identity
[1:28:16] that Christ put inside of you
[1:28:19] Hallelujah Romans 8 38 and 30 and 39 for
[1:28:23] I am sure
[1:28:25] I am sure
[1:28:27] that neither death nor life nor angels
[1:28:30] nor rulers nor things present nor things
[1:28:33] to come nor powers no Hypes nor depths
[1:28:36] nor all anything else in all creation no
[1:28:40] matter what this world can do we'll be
[1:28:43] able to separate us from the love of God
[1:28:46] in Christ Jesus our lord nothing
[1:28:51] nothing is going to separate us
[1:28:55] when Peter recognized that he was going
[1:28:57] to be an old man he was Fearless he was
[1:29:00] bold let me tell you nothing is going to
[1:29:03] separate you from God
[1:29:06] nothing
[1:29:09] what without fear
[1:29:12] get rid of fear
[1:29:16] is a false evidence of pure and real
[1:29:18] it's a lie of the devil
[1:29:21] all things work together for good
[1:29:25] because God is in all things and he is
[1:29:29] all things
[1:29:33] John 10 27.
[1:29:35] musicians can come
[1:29:37] my sheep hear my voice
[1:29:40] they don't hear any other voice they
[1:29:42] have no identification with any other
[1:29:44] voice but the shepherd's voice
[1:29:48] and they know them and they follow me
[1:29:51] now listen I give them eternal life
[1:29:56] whoa

[1:30:09] and no one listen No One nothing nothing
[1:30:14] that this life can bring to you will
[1:30:17] snatch you out of the father's hands
[1:30:20] why why
[1:30:22] my father who has given them to me is
[1:30:26] greater than all things
[1:30:28] and no one is able to snatch them out of
[1:30:31] the father's hand
[1:30:33] and I and the father are one
[1:30:38] and Jesus said in that day this day
[1:30:42] today you'll know that I'm in the Father
[1:30:45] the father and me I and you and you and
[1:30:49] me
[1:30:51] who can snatch you out of his hand

[1:31:17] what he said
[1:31:20] it's the hardest thing to do isn't it
[1:31:22] the most simplest instruction but it's
[1:31:24] the hardest thing to do
[1:31:30] the bride knows that her identity will
[1:31:32] never be found
[1:31:33] outside of Christ
[1:31:36] Hallelujah
[1:31:39] Hallelujah
[1:31:45] thank you Lord
[1:31:47] we need to identify with Jesus and his
[1:31:49] resurrection
[1:31:50] when he rose from the dead
[1:31:52] he shattered all powers and authorities
[1:31:54] of Satan the Bible says he destroyed
[1:31:57] powers and principalities making them an
[1:31:59] open show of them
[1:32:01] Colossians 2 15 being identified with
[1:32:04] Jesus in his resurrection we received
[1:32:07] the benefits and the authority of his
[1:32:09] resurrection Ephesians 1 16-23
[1:32:14] when opposition comes against us we need
[1:32:17] to make a stand and take the authority
[1:32:21] that we have in our new identity in
[1:32:23] Christ Jesus
[1:32:24] we have to speak to the opposition and
[1:32:28] tell it that we have been risen with
[1:32:32] Christ and now in a position of
[1:32:35] authority
[1:32:37] speak God's word over your life
[1:32:42] don't listen to the devil
[1:32:45] speak God's word every day over your
[1:32:49] life

[1:33:04] say because
[1:33:06] I rose with Christ
[1:33:08] I have the authority of Christ over all
[1:33:11] the forces of darkness in my life
[1:33:14] Luke 10 19 behold I give unto you power
[1:33:18] to tread on serpents and scorpions and
[1:33:21] over some
[1:33:23] no all the power of the enemy and
[1:33:28] nothing listen and nothing shall by any
[1:33:31] means hurt you

[1:33:38] smart Marcus say but we're going to
[1:33:40] continue it let us stand
[1:33:43] oh what an identity we have in Christ
[1:33:47] what an identity when we start
[1:33:49] recognizing Who We Are
[1:33:51] recognizing the word of God within us
[1:33:54] these simple truths coming alive within
[1:33:57] our lives

[1:34:32] God has to be real to me
[1:34:36] if God ain't real to me
[1:34:38] that he ain't God to me
[1:34:42] God has to be real in our lives
[1:34:46] if you can believe tonight
[1:34:48] if God has spoken to your heart you can
[1:34:51] believe his word
[1:34:53] you don't have to believe me or anybody
[1:34:55] else you can believe his word I spoke
[1:34:59] his word tonight
