and followers good sunday morning to you i'm trusting that you will thoroughly receive the word of god for today with great joy and at the same time with a sobriety and reverence that will touch your hearts and lives may the lord richly bless you now last week we spoke on the first part of the cheapening of the message in this we used the scripture of after solomon's death how that uh the shields of gold that solomon had given to his guards for his palace were taken away out of the land of israel robbed from them and solomon's son rehoboam decided that he would produce or reproduce replicas of the shields of solomon but instead of creating them with the same qualities of gold he devalued them he degraded them he cheapened them and brought them down my friends to the level of brass by passing silver on down the brass and from this we brought this thought of the cheapening of the message speaking of the devaluation of the dollar and of the devaluation of faith now today we would like to continue now to those who have truly caught this message of the hour the gospel message of the day may god send to you and restore to us the joy of our salvation and the excitement of our spontaneous worship back into the church and into our personal lives that we may serve him with joy with gratitude and appreciation for our gracious and righteous heavenly father i praise and thank god for what this message has done and is doing around the world touching the hearts and lives of tens of thousands yeah even millions now in the midst of all this wonderful uh accomplishments and the things that are going on the testimonies that are being given they all of that yet i can see a horrible thing taking place i see the cheapening of the message from the time of the messenger of the seventh church age from the time of the prophet of the hour sent with the word of god for this day i can see a cheapening a devaluation of the message of the hour now what does chicken mean according to various dictionaries the word cheapen means to trivialize just to think the trivialization of this message is now in progress to the base to mark down to contaminate to pollute to make shallow to make skin deep so we are beginning to have a lot of skin deep believers with skin deep experiences carnal from the inside to the outside and really does not have this message within the heart the message has not grabbed the whole of their heart they say i have the holy ghost but really you have the holy ghost but does the holy ghost have control of you this is the problem here today oh my friends as we look on this problem here today this message is also being cheated not by only believers but even by ministers that are ministering this present day gospel message of the present stage of the ministry of our lord jesus christ they are adding to the word and some are taking away from the word of god as it's written in the scriptures in the book of matthew and luke particularly how that one day jesus said a sore went forth to soul and he sold his seeds and at night an enemy came in and also sowed seeds and when he was told that when his his field his seats began to grow the thorns and twistles were in the midst he said an enemy had done this i must say my friends it's the same thing that's taking place in our day how god sold his original word with one god water baptism in the right way the the conduct order and doctrine of the church of god revelation of the original sin not being an apple but being adultery in the garden all these various truths true justification representation condemnation by representation oh my friends all these various truths make clear to us now being forgotten lost cheaten by some and put away adding to the word and taking away also from the word of god the messages being changed for the price of living for this message the price of accepting reproach for the word is being taken away until it's becoming a fashionable thing a marvelous wonderful thing to say i'm in the message i'm in the gospel i'm in the word for the hour i follow the message of the hour and so it's being cheapened i'd like to speak now concerning one a preacher who gave a marvelous example of this by the name his name is anthony campolo and he said that as a as a boy himself and his best friend on uh devil's night that's the night before halloween decided to do some uh you know boys mischief and so they broke into a corner store not to rob not to steal not to take anything away just for the fact that they could uh cause mayhem they could cause confusion and chaos and what did they do they went in and changed the price tag now if a refrigerator or something costs let's say 800 dollars they change the price tag and place on it two dollars and if a pin or something else was valued at 50 cents then they will value it at five dollars or something like that my friend so the price that's been changed the expensive things were their prices were brought low and they cheap things were elevated and their prices were really high and that's the trick that satan has played upon the church cheapen the things of god and cause his uh his things that are worthless and carnal to be elevated in the church whether it be preachers whether it be believers whether it be whatever it is in the church that's the switch that satan has done in our day and in our time and so we're ending up with a an army of ministers membership and preachers we increase in numbers but not in the quality of the believers or or messengers preachers that are in the word of god we we have preachers that have the tendency of looking for and also trying to accomplish having a a get happy congregation a congregation that's so interested in being happy all the time matter of fact they'll send these services are you happy and everybody will fail amen and the preacher says everybody happy hallelujah the preacher will say to them oh i feel a whole lot of love in this room the people will say hey man want a a happy shouting congregation and believe that that is the accomplishment that this word of god came to do but the word of god came to ship characters the word of god came to change lies the word of god came to bring us back to the original faith that was once delivered unto the saints and so we have left the serious as the sobriety the reverence the sacredness that oozed out of the apostle that flowed from the prophets and the patriarchs down now to a day where we are actually invaded and infected by uh hordes of snake oil snakes salesmen that are selling the gospel instead of preaching the word of god to change hearts and transforms lies by the power and presence of almighty god you see these electric oil preachers don't really understand what the real move of god is they don't understand that a real move of god makes a lot of people unhappy mad convicted and sad before they can be made glad this is how the holy spirit of almighty god works but they're concentrating on making congregations and people happy these are the ones in this message that will pick it up and cause it to say whatever they wanted to say so these cure all medicine men these religious quack druggists don't realize that a real move of god the real move of the holy ghost will cause you to weep before you laugh and shout for joy for instance if we were to read which we will out of the book of ezra we shall read chapter 13 reading from verses 10 to 13. and when the builders now this is the return of israel under ezra out of babylon back to the land and now rebuilding the temple and when the builders had laid the foundation of the temple of the lord they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets and the levites the sons of israel with symbols to praise the lord after the ordinance of david king of israel and they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks to the lord because he is good and his mercy endureth forever towards israel and all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the lord because the foundation of the house of the lord was laid but many of the priests levites and chief of the fathers who were ancient men and had seen the first house when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes they wept with a loud voice and many shouted for joy so the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people for the people shouted with a loud shout and the noise was heard afar off now here is the scenario how that they were laying the foundation of this second temple under their second exodus first exodus out of egypt second exodus out of babylon back into egypt laying the foundations for their second temple and as the foundations were being laid the people began to have a shouting and a joy in their hearts oh they were playing their musical instruments with their choirs singing in their course and they were giving glory and praise to god that god and his mercy endures forever towards israel but while they were doing that while the majority of the people were doing that there were little pockets of levites of these ancient or all men ancient fathers these ones chiefs elders of the people that were present at the time of the land of solomon's maybe solomon's temple and having some evidence of that house or the glory of that house and they wept and i would like to suggest that they wept because they realized that no matter how magnificent they made this temple laid the foundation no matter how beautiful and wonderful it was ichabod was written across the doorpost of the for former temple the glory of god has departed my friends no matter what your institution how beautiful you're building how big your building how many thousands may follow you if the glory of the lord is departed you may be a wonderful speaker a marvelously trained man you may have it within your heart all sincerity but if the glory is departed if the presence of god is departed from his house my friends if we are here but he is not here then it is no use for us being here oh think of that contrast one group rejoicing and shouting and the other group that knew the original were weeping and the bible says they are weeping loudly and so my friends even today we hear folks speaking about pentecost we hear them speaking about the presence of the god in the church but they have no idea of those original days you say do you yes i do i was around the time when it was just drifting away i came at the tail end of it when the presence and power of god was still being displayed spontaneously when the clouds of glory will pass above the congregation while they were praising giving glory and honor to god all friends not reading it in a book not hearing about it but absolutely experiencing god in this supernatural way when no folk could not just walk into the church just like that ah that's all right but if they were demon possessed if they were in any kind of state of that nature those those wicked spirits would have to leave them in the house of the living god not because somebody said that they have the power to cast out devils it happens spontaneously under the presence and the anointing of the holy spirit by the by the dedicated consecrated lines of holiness of god's people and the saturation of prayer and fasting and surrender soul surrender to the living god and the destruction of of a carnality from among the saints of god and they live to let the sword of the word of god bring death to self and life of jesus christ to be manifest within their hearts and lives amen so a real move of god will make people unhappy convicted mad or sad before it will make them happy or glad and so these crack druggists these cure all medicine men will say anything do anything sway in any direction as long as they can have a crowd as long as they can have a mass meeting as long as their names can be lit up in lights as long as they they can have their names written on books and papers and their names to be elevated they don't seek the shadows anymore they don't seek my friends the humility of the spirit anymore the simplicity of god anymore they seek the they seek the spotlight they seek my friends all the bright lights the fame is the name of the game in this day and in this hour in which we are living i place i i would like to put it to you that a lot of them are suffering from eye trouble because everything is i i i i i you might as well say yeah oh lord help us father they have eye trouble and may the holy spirit give you i serve to take away your eye trouble that you may be able to recognize the word of god for your day the message for your day and surrender and fully submit yourself to christ and get away from this shallow cheap thing called modern day christianity here upon us oh glory to god hallelujah so these priests wept because they realized everything was cheap and shallow you realize that was a shouting of joy without knowledge that was a rejoicing without revelation the people were shouting at what they really didn't know or really never experienced before they had not seen the glory of the former house and here they were rejoicing at the laying of this second house not that we blame them for doing that for they didn't know any better but these older men that recognized they could discern the deterioration the rottenness the corruption that was creeping into the body of politic the body of israel and the body of christ today we see that creeping in completely in it you see it creeping in into our church worship services cheap shallow worship cheap behavior church behavior before service during the services after the services and a loss of reverence in the house of god i am not talking about street uh strict legalism as if you are in a a school that the school room and you're dominated over by a fearsome school master my friends but being in the sacred presence of god uh the holiness of god will make you one of us moses take your shoes from off your feet for the ground on which your stand is holy ground god was god's spirit the presence of the genuine anointed of god makes you feel unworthy makes you feel ashamed of yourself oh but i've not not done anything wrong my friends never mind in your heart if you can go through your life and think you have not done anything wrong you never said anything wrong you never thought anything wrong you never acted in anything wrong and you cannot remember or 100 you don't know if you ever come into a genuine presence of the great holy spirit with his awesome divine presence without any human knowledge you will find yourself feeling inadequate unworthy you will even feel unholy and unclean in the presence of god oh and want to humble and surrender yourself to god and cry out and ask him for his mercy his grace and his love my friends even their after services is terrible and it's also a proof of this modern day cheapening of the message of this god smell cheap no more glowing embers after the worship services are over no more real after blow at the elders no more calls of fire when we come to the end of our meetings you understand what i'm talking about you come to if you were to go on a camp uh you you went to camping out in the wilds and you had your tent and you let your campfire after a while later in the night or evening the the fire will go down and all that will be left will be glowing embers glowing in the dark until you put them out yourself completely for natural safety reasons for the forest but my friends spiritually now speaking after the meetings are over that sacredness that sincerity that love of god that grip the hearts of true believers it's beings lost it's being leaked out let's go it's going away amen yes sir because what there is no afterglow there is no glowing embers that's left in these meetings the meeting ends and the church sometimes becomes a roar of conversation some are weeping at the altar others are crying some are praying seeking god seeking him for the holy ghost and while they're doing that there's this buzz of conversation going on where one can hardly concentrate or meditate in the presence of god it reveals shallowness within our churches and within our worship oh friends after a real holy ghost meeting in the presence of god there is always these glowing mem embers a fire that remain in the hearts of believers long after that these meetings have been declared ended oh yes congregations in this hour concentrating on having financially well-off contribute contributors many of them that are educated pagans baptized but pagans in the presence of god religious sinners lukewarm backsliders that are elevated in position and presence in the house of god while the poor are pushed to the back or pushed away are suppressed in every possible way many of these are rebellious self-willed disloyal and these are they that will use their presence power of their personality power their purse to undermine the kingdom of god to divide the house of god and to be so ungrateful many a preacher has seen himself preach the gospel counsel speak to certain ones and marriages that were about to be broken to pieces or was already broken and god used that faithful man of god to bring things together again or lies that were wasted and the preacher takes them under his wings points them in the right direction their lies are cleaned up when they begin to prosper and grow within their walk and soon many of these walk away in gratitude the sin of ingratitude is very prevalent amongst the people of god my friends i think that we are not to ask is everybody happy now they ought not to be that kind if they're living like that they are not to be made to feel happy they ought to feel the conviction of the holy spirit as preachers preach the genuine gospel to cut away at the circumcise the fleshliness from the hearts of men and bring them back to the presence of almighty god and introduce them to this person of jesus christ the same yesterday today and for uh and forever both minister and believers both people and priests many are shallow in the word and shallow in their experience with god many of god's people don't read their bible and pray every day and seek his blessed face they would repent they would turn away from their sins and from their habits that rather to hide them they rather to cloak them they rather to keep them away from the from the people of god not knowing where they can pray for them that's the kind of lies that we see within the body of jesus christ but i'm going to read now out of ezekiel chapter 22 a remarkable passage which you ought to open your bible ezekiel chapter 22 and read along with me from verse 24. in verse 18 son of man the house of israel is to me become dross all they are like brass and tin and iron and lead in the midst of the furnace they are even the dross of silver and now over to verse 24 son of man i say unto her israel thou art a land that is not cleansed now i'm speaking to the church of god thou art a land that is not cleansed nor reigned upon in the day of indignation there is a conspiracy or an unspoken understanding a conspiracy of our prophets or preachers in the midst thereof like roaring lions ravening the prey they have devoured souls they have taken the treasure that's what they're interested in they have taken the treasure now this is not me this is in your bible this is god speaking i'm bringing it up to our modern day and age and applying it to our day and the characters that are on the stage of life at this particular time think of it they have taken the treasure and the precious things they have made her many widows in the midst our priests her priests have violated my law and have profaned my holy things they have put no difference between the holy and the profane or unholy no difference the lines have become blurred between truth and error between godliness and ungodliness between the christian and the non-christian the believer and the unbeliever they have blurred the lines because of making things so acceptable and comfortable that these unclean birds and spirits can find a resting place right within the branches of the very church of god they have put no difference between the holy and the profane neither have they showed difference between the unclean and they clean and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths and i am profane amongst them even god himself is profaned they curse and blaspheme his name they swear in his name using his name in vain and god is speaking out of this word how ungodly this is her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey to shed blood and to destroy souls and to get this honest gain tell any lie do any deal anything whatsoever to grow and prosper and develop some huge marvelous so-called ministry or monastery and her prophets have dobbed them with untempered moth murder seeing vanity and divining lies god hasn't spoken to them but they're seeing all kinds of vanities and divining lies unto them saying thus saith the lord when the lord had not spoken they're using god's name in vain saying the lord told me this and the lord told me that the lord says this is going to happen whether in september november or october and god has not told them that for the lord has not spoken the people of the land have used oppression to oppress the poor oppressed the dumb trodden who were already down but they pressed them down further oppressed and they exercised robbery and have vexed the poor and needy why they're robbing them of their wages robbing them of anything they can rob them because they're not smart they're not wise and they believe that that gives them the right not to tell them what their rights are not to tell them what they genuinely earn but to steal from them to rob them and to oppress them and take away from them what is theirs in the name of prophets and then call themselves prophets now my friends they have also oppressed the stranger wrongfully and i sought for a man among them that will make up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land for the church that i should not destroy it but i found none all my friends think of it shallow in the word shallow in supernatural experience god's people won't repent today's baptism of the holy spirit or the reception of the holy ghost is so shallow and cheap for many young people come to the altar have hands laid on them prayer made over them and soon there they're they're shivering and shouting and then somebody's you got it you've got the holy ghost oh my and shortly after that meeting is over they got the holy ghost and they leave that meeting with all manner of laughter and frivolous jokes and head right over to the nearest burger joint or off to somewhere for boxes of pizza or buckets of fried chicken the mind is no more on god or their mind is no more on what the holy spirit did for them but friends that's not the holy ghost i'm talking about that's not the holy spirit i know the great holy spirit when he really genuinely gets a hold of you my friends for it never leaves you for days for weeks maybe for months maybe forever it will never leave you but that high atmosphere when you first receive the holy spirit it will linger for a long time upon your life and for days if not for weeks you feel as if you're walking on air or in the air why because your soul is living in a heavenly place under his shadow of his wings of the great holy spirit here is his young one that has just come in and he overshadows them with his great and mighty wings that kind of a holy ghost when he comes upon you it takes some time for you to become adjusted to to the atmosphere the presence and even the natural feeling of him upon your natural flesh my friends it's so sacred and holy in the presence of the living god i tell you friends that kind of holy spirit doesn't change you and then yeah all you're looking for is for the next camp meeting my friends this kind of a holy spirit when he indwells you and possesses you it's going to stay with you and change your life for all time and for all eternity we see this cheating and shallowness and it can be seen in the easy backsliding with our members within our churches they're coming quickly and out the doors quickly oh they say well it's your fault you did not go to the theological seminary to learn the appropriate science and system of assimilation of how to hold and keep and entrap uh the people within the the church within the body of christ my friends these things are actually being taught i don't know that jesus taught that to his disciples i don't think the apostles were teaching that to their believers but my friends i believe the magnet of the word of god when jesus said if i be lifted up i'll draw all men unto myself but we will help the lord along we want to help him a little marketing a little bit of promotion we want to help him a little bit of this psychology and science of assimilation and how we can proliferate the gospel using man-made wisdom and man-made means my friend this is what is happening in our day and time and no wonder we have all these mighty numbers of believers but the quality is not there anymore because the christians have become so cheap cheap cheap we have chicken christians that are so cheap think of it my friends the liberty i usually call this stock market christians also these are they that buy into the church or the movement while it's riding high while that pastor is well known once he is not criticized once no one brings any uh any besmirching his reputation or launch any uh campaign of gossip against him oh my friends once he is like that then oh he rides high in their estimation and they're ready to buy into that program and to assist them to volunteer and to support and to sing and acquire and to give solos and to do everything possible but the moment they have the first smell of any kind of a problem coming up in that group that church or with that particular person that's preaching leading them in the gospel of jesus christ they sell out and they are gone what a day my friends in which we live with these kinds of stock market christians that are watching everything on every hand they won't stand for anything amen they won't stand for anything they're always on the borderline borderline christians where where they can place their foot on one side oh and quickly slip on the other side if there's a change in fortunes or a story was told many years ago how down in the old south in the united states there was one soldier that thought he was smart that he would just kind of desert but not really because he thought he would be safer during the war if he placed on a blue jacket of the northern troops and the grey bottoms of the confederacy oh he felt neither side would take a shot at him and to his surprise he got shot in the chest with his blue uniform and he got shot in the you know what in his gray bottoms my friends that is the case with a lot of believers today you can't play both sides you've got to make your choice you've got to decide who you will serve if you're on the lord's side then serve the lord and if you be on the world or be else sign then go serve mammon sir bill some other god but if you're on the lord's side stand for jesus stand for the word and he will stand for you oh hold to god's unchanging hand and this great holy spirit of almighty god will see you through your life's journey there may be ups and downs there may be hills and valleys but in the end he'll see you through he'll see you over every river that you think may be uncrossable he'll see you through any mountain that you think you can't tunnel tree god will make a way where there is no way if you place your faith and your trust in him here we live in this day and time a time my friends of cheap reproductions of christianity look at the christians in the book of acts look at them in the bible see them even up to the days of 1906 and what came out of that the revivals of wesley and whitfield and and these various men of god the new england awakening the presence of god the holy spirit overshadowing the place it wasn't one spot it was everywhere god was seizing and taking hold of cities and casting out the prince of the power of the air that ruled over certain cities and territories and taking control of it oh friends but the darkness began to creep in until in this day and in this hour we're finding cheap reproductions of christianity i walk the halls of great museums of the world the rum here in toronto canada i've walked through the museums of the vaticans the vatican i've moved into various museums in new york and in other states of the united states and admired the marvelous paintings and artworks displayed within them and had such wonderful fulfillment in taking these things in but after i've left there and manif ministered many parts of the world going places i noticed that i would come up against reproductions of these very things i've seen within the various museums of the world the ones that i've seen were priceless they were so expensive and priceless but oh you can easily cheaply buy one at a street corner you can buy one cheaply for just maybe a hundred dollars fifty dollars maybe it'll buy one maybe even cheaper than that i don't know but cheap reproductions of the original are for sale christianity now is for sale depends on how much uh you know indulgences how many offerings how many whatever that you gave uh you know your elevation your position your your the various uh things that well uh crew to you my friend but that's the day this is the day that we are living in of cheap reproductions of paintings cheap reproductions of sculpture pre-cheap reproductions of music of art various ways that's what i'm bringing to you today has befallen our beloved faith the faith of our fathers but thank god forevermore it has been restored to us again amen and the faith of our fathers is living still in spite of fire and dungeon and sword in spite of the devil's works of trying to destroy the work of god and the people of god the word of god still stands here forever for his glory and for his honor oh glory to god hallelujah amen and amen oh glory to god we find there's a lack of holiness ministers are falling left and right on every hand i'm not talking about rumors about ministers because a minister can be absolutely 100 pure and walking living his life oh and someone spreads a rumor tells a lie and that lie will move across the land faster than the truth and that man is marked and black his name batten his reputation blackened and it's no use in making any explanation he just leaves it alone and let it go because it'll just be worse god will take care of it don't worry about it god will take care of it for touch my anointed and do my prophets no harm god help you to fall into the hands of an angry god ministers are fallen left and right you've read the stories you've seen them in the newspapers you read it on the internet even recently you're seeing examples of it men of high station men of great reputation oh god help us when leaders and men of god find themselves in these situations not only find themselves many of them are drawn away by their own lusts many of them are drawn away by their own desires and this is what's happened memberships are fallen and standards are fallen oh my friends no true holiness being produced anymore and i'm afraid that in our day instead of following in the footsteps of our lord jesus christ who turned the water into wine i believe many preachers are turning the wine into water and cheapening the entire effects of the gospel and the power of the word of god with its stimulative effects to change and transform the lives of people and to heal their them heal their bodies minds and spirits awaiting a cheating a sense of a watering down of the that which is real and true in the house and presence of god waxing less and less of the presence of the supernatural oh blessed be the name of the lord my friends i believe i'm going to not rush this or push this any further i am going to go into the third part of this message next sunday if the lord is willing and will allow me i will go into a third part but right now i feel that i should now uh ease this down and cease now and just come to a place where we bring this to an end for today may you feel the after effects and the after glow of this meeting go tell it on the mountains tell it everywhere tell them about this glorious gospel that you have been hearing that won't just make you laugh or feel happy but it'll challenge you it'll convict you it'll make you see yourself whether you be a saint or a sinner or an unbeliever and come to attention of their word of god thank you my friends for listening many will have turned off their computers or turned away from something like this it's not smooth enough it's not polished it's not professional enough it's not beautiful enough it's not with the lecture ability that they expect because these so-called uh many pharisees and sadducees have created this uh unreal picture of what a man of god should be even in the times of jesus and we will speak on these things later but for now god bless you my friends have a great week well we'll speak with you again on wednesday night when we speak on the seven church ages and we are in now the ephesian church age the first church age and may god bless us and let's pray for that well that meaning that the holy spirit will come down upon it anoint it and use it and that what we're trying to do here will spread like wildfire around the world into homes and hearts and lives and nations changing transforming and drawing them to jesus christ to know him whom to know is life eternal god bless you goodbye friends until next week when we'll see you in the house of god to rejoice to weep to cry to repent together to lift up our hearts to the lord giving him all the glory and the praise of the honor now and forevermore amen and amen [Music] you
