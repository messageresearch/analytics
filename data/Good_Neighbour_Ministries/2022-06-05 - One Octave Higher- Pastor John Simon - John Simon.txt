praise the lord [Applause] we are indeed happy to be here this morning and to give praise and honor and glory to god we are here to worship him and as the song says we're together again praise god no matter what we have been doing during the week now god has gathered us together in his marvelous and wonderful grace and i'm happy to be here and i hope you are too may the lord bless you real good as we prepare to have the dedication of this wonderful fruit of life from the cradle of life thanking god and giving him grace please be seated we welcome all those visitors that are here remember uh brother tim who's gone to the doctor has a physical problem and asks sincerely for our prayers there may be many others here that have uh requests within their heart there are some that are listening online and they may have requests within their heart let us pray that god touches them right now just before we go into this a gracious god and heavenly father we present before thy august presence these desires of the heart of the saints of god we ask in your goodness and in the riches of your mercy reach down your hand and touch them lord for we ask it in jesus name amen god richly bless you praise god may i ask the parents joshua and sarah goosens to step to the front with their beautiful daughter their child zoe bell goosens praise god hallelujah what a lovely couple isn't it praise god oh and i forgot there lily rose goosens hair she was dedicated right here also we're glad to welcome you back uh and god bless you praise god hallelujah i will not step down as i usually do you know precautions of the times as such but i certainly will pray god's blessing upon both of you and upon the child praise god that god bless her richly in a wonderful way of course the scripture says in psalms 103 the mercy of the lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness onto children's children to such as keep his commandment and to those that remember his commandments to go do them thus saith the lord suffer the little children to come on to me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and bless them praise god now of course you know that in presenting your child to the lord for dedication by this you are confessing your faith your action speaks of your faith in god and that he will bless you for you are here asking for his blessing upon this child praise god and i as a minister acknowledge that you are doing this and not as a duty but you're doing this because of the faith that is within your heart that this is something you should do and that god will respond by blessing you and the child praise the lord now i i know that you are both uh believers you are both people of faith uh people who serve the lord in sincerity and we give god glory for that amen now of course as much as this responsibility has carried is carried out by these parents as they're doing now it is also shared by us as a community of faith for as the old proverb says it takes a whole village to raise a child i know they got modern laws from dr spock and many others but in the old days anybody in the village can give you a whipping and if they go and tell your parents afterwards you'll get a second dose [Music] so you do everything in your behavior to avoid the first one so you don't get the second one we are thankful that there are parents here that recognize the importance not only of their duty and their work and their faith but to be surrounded by a security blanket of a community of faith that will encourage them strengthen them and surround them with the warmth of love and the grace of almighty god of course [Music] i i can say to you will you train up this child but i would say that because i believe what uh you have learned from the scriptures will inspire you to raise this child in the knowledge and in the fear of the lord hallelujah let us all rise at this time for a prayer of dedication for this child it's okay praise god that's okay let her cry is better she crying here than anywhere outside is that right praise god our gracious and eternal god we offer this child in dedication to you as samuel was offered by hannah his mother [Music] in service and in dedication to your divine will [Music] we thank you that they have come now you have given them this child and now they are here to give this child back to you its life in service and its walk in this world that we are living in we pray that you will accept this our prayer today share your grace father thank you for the aunts uncles thank you for those who are here to witness this marvelous saying father for the seed of life that is in the mother and father may be activated in the child today father from this hour let her be aware and conscious that she is not just a not a child but one raised in the purpose and will of god this we ask in no other name that glorious marvelous and illustrious name of jesus christ our lord and savior amen and amen may god richly bless you both praise the lord bless you [Applause] go ahead and take i forgot to mention the aunt who i believe she sang here is that is that the aunt that sang here praise god lord god give us more angels like that to come down from heaven and a body and sing for us we thank god for that voice and for that service [Music] and uh is daniel here oh he's behind me that's why i couldn't see him oh god bless you brother danielle i acknowledge you as an uncle for the second time oh praise god hallelujah he's a double uncle god bless him real good god bless you all now shall we go to the word of god do you know that the the singers and the musicians of the tribe of judah always went before the armies of the lord they sang they played and it encouraged the hearts of the of the warriors to go out and all all the armies know that that's why they have the drum room it's to stir up the heart of the warriors as they go to war praise the lord well we are christian soldiers isn't that right and we are gathered here to give glory to god but satan won't just allow you to do that just because you're in a building called the church he'll still speak to your mind and he'll suggest things he'll give you makes you distract you obstruct you undermine you whatever but let's go into this spiritual warfare of preaching the word of god and you encourage me and i will encourage you amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah let us look to the psalm chapter 61 reading verses 2 and 3. and it reads thus from the end of the earth will i cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i for thou has been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy thank god hallelujah father thank you for the reading of your word bless us together for we ask it in jesus name amen i'm speaking on the subject of one octave higher one octave higher now david with his sheep on the mountain hillsides in israel at that time and you know when you are in the mountains like that and whatever you're doing storms can suddenly come up uh you'll suddenly be standing there and the mountain is so high you can't see the storm coming from miles away so all of a sudden you'll see the black clouds and the winds and storms will come on you suddenly and then uh flash floods is called water will just come in a hurry and sweep you away if you don't get to higher ground on time so with some of that in the back of his mind and his whole flock being swept away david is saying to the lord lord god i know in this natural life that we're living not only will the sheep have storms come in their life and flash floods but every one of us will also suffer storms of life we will suffer from the flash floods of life that will seek to overwhelm us and drown us in the cares of this human life so he's saying lord whenever that happens i can't depend on myself i can't depend on my strength lead me to the rock that is higher than i o praise god i'm thankful that we have a rock and that rock is a rock of ages i'm thankful that that word when it's used in some saying rock it's almost saying lead me to your fortress lead me to your place of defense where you can defend me where it can be behind the walls of your word that i can be protected by your grace and by your holy spirit hallelujah now you remember lot when a lot was done in the plains of sodom and the two angels came to him and say flee run lot run for the mountains run to the top for we can't bring judgment on this place until you are out of here amen god is saying to us the same thing come out of the world come out of your works come out all of these human things and climb into another dimension a little higher where the grace of god can encircle you where the spirit of god can embrace you with his divine love and grace and you feel the warmth as you are there in abraham's bosom spiritually speaking amen so he had to flee to the top of the mountains hallelujah now i know and i believe you are aware that storms are even right now striking the coasts of florida storms are striking uh parts of the united states and uh stories have been told that some people have been so overwhelmed with water that they had to climb to the top of their houses they had to climb to the top of their houses because you know they have to get away from the snakes they had to get away from the gators that they won't get them and they went to the top of their very houses i want you to know that that's where we have to go is the top of the mountain that god has provided for us now i want to make a slight uh change here to bring this out a little clearer to you now how many of you know uh somewhat about music let me see your hands i just want to know i got some support here are you scared of putting your hands up like that what kind of stuff this queen elizabeth isn't here with this no raise your hand up like a real west indian like a real canadian and tell me there you you know something about music okay well god is a music composer how many knows that god is a music director do you know that certainly he is and god has created and given to the world some are the most beautiful music that you can ever conceive of and he has inspired that music through a lot of of creative men uh mendel's many many others let me not go into names but the fact is that even the hallelujah chorus do you know that he actually had a vision of seeing the angel singing it in heaven and all he did was when he come to himself is copied off the same scores and copied off the same things they were doing and singing there that is why that song can never leave human consciousness because it's not just an ordinary song he actually got it from the very presence of god and there are many others that were inspired like that in every way but there's a higher form of music and scientists will tell you that that music carries healing it will calm you down that's the music of creation you just go in the woods or laying some part that we may have just listen to the birds singing just listen to the the gentle walks of the breeze going through and rustling in the leaves of the trees and that's the music of nature that we cannot duplicate and uh we can only lay back and allow ourselves to be healed by it to have recovery from it because of this music but there's another higher form of music and scientists call it the music of the spheres they said you know there's a music that's being played but we can't hear it with the natural ear and it's the music formed by the harmony of all these planets constantly whirling we know they're in harmony because they don't miss one second or one nanosecond of time they don't miss they're in perfect harmony and symmetry and while they're moving like that we know they're making some kind of music but our ears can't hear it and they call it the music of the spheres oh my great musicians you'll see where i'm going from here have spoken of the lost cord and the lost cord as they describe it is music that they know is they can feel it they can sense it but it's just beyond the realm of human senses just beyond it's almost like you trying to recall a thought and you can literally almost taste it you can almost see it you know it's there but but you don't know how to express it and they call that the lost cord now i want you to know that god who is the greatest composer of all time has given us a signal because you know directors of music how they do when they're directing the music and they have their wand in their hand when they wanted to go up the nil they'll tell you it's got to lift it's got to go up a little higher you got to come up higher is that right chris amen see so he's calling on his musicians and his singers to go into a higher octave he wants them to lift that music lift that message that they have received lift it up into another octave higher all right see now we know that under the force polls the first uh polls of the gospel or climaxes or if you want to say it crescendos in the message right the in this marvelous music of the message of the hour that we have been enjoying the grace of god we have received a signal from god himself i want the music to go into another octave higher and that's what i'm talking about one octave higher thank god the music the message that we have received before under the first two poles were beautiful how many can say that beautiful none can touch it the beauty of that was always so beautiful amen and we were always wondering can this message go any higher can this word go any higher and we always wondered that hallelujah but i want you to know the composer has given his signal for it to go higher and one time while brother william branham was speaking quoting not knowing of course being spiritual you watch spiritual things and god knows it but if you'll turn and look up the clock it's on the dot of two o'clock the end of the second pull the third pull is at hand did you notice it went into that other octave did you notice the holy spirit took the same song and picking it up and taking it up to the higher octave see that next ball is now at hand so not another song not a new message not anything new but taking the same song the same word the same bible that we have but taking it higher to her level other than just the common bible study the common uh hermeneutics apologetics whatever you want to call it amen praise god my friends this gospel has gone to another dimension it's the mention beyond human intellectuals it's beyond human intellectuals is now given by god by supernatural revelation for this gospel we have received the bible tells us clearly it was holy men of god wrote as they were inspired by the holy ghost now if there were inspired to write that same holy spirit if we are going to have a clear understanding must also come back and inspire us to hear to receive and those that speak to be inspired to speak the word on the divine direction divine inspiration not my will not your will not what i compose or i i just put together something here and come tell you but to be inspired by the living god anointed by the holy ghost to see exactly what god once said listen while i'm speaking here god is going to go beyond what even i am saying i'm only here to demonstrate the holy spirit that he lives he's not dead but he's alive he's a living god and he lives in me he lives in you if you believe all things are possible to them that will believe the word of god amen hallelujah oh my yes sir the message goes into a one octave higher hallelujah now musicians know this i'm a neophyte but i think there are eight uh tones uh to music and i think every child almost know the remy facility and it ends up back to the original dough it starts with do and it ends up back with dough right you're back to the original again like that and uh when you look to an october octagon or something with eight sides uh you know and that's we have to understand that we have come through the seven church ages as illustrated there and we have gone right back after the seven church ages we go back originally where we come from we originally go back to what we call the day well there is no it day the it there really speaks of going back to the first day and that's what we are here talking about going back to original uncommon contaminated unconfused by all these doctrines by all these so-called wise teachings of wise men and they're good men they're wise men but we're not looking for that we're looking for the original word of god on the inspiration of the holy spirit strike your soul hallelujah the lightning of god's word and the thunder of the spirit of god speaking into your hearts amen bringing forth life life light power for his glory and for his honor oh praise god amen oh i repeat it again but for god to be received the glory preached in the nation of guyana left five churches behind i went back came back just a week ago and found there are now 36 churches that are functioning for the glory of god and growing every day why the word still has its power he is the same yesterday today and forever praise be to god hallelujah amen yes sir so the same message that we have always been hearing the holy spirit is letting us know that the message itself is being quickened by the holy spirit and taken to a higher realm taken to a higher dimension praise god one octave higher now i have something i have here from google talking about what is an octave in music and listen with spiritual ears typically the man sings in a lower pitch voice is that right how many knows that man voice just naturally tends to be lower if his voice tends to be higher well you know it's kind of strange but uh but here it is we find out friends that certainly the man's voice is a lower pitch but a woman sings in a higher pitched voice she doesn't have to put on anything to have a higher pitched voice whether we call it a soprano or whatever you know she doesn't have to do anything that's just the natural tones and notes of a woman's uh voice right but notice between the voice of a man and of a woman while the woman sings in a higher pitched voice it is essentially the same notes being sung in related harmonics you see that's what an octave is right for the octave is an interval between the two keys that carry the same note vibrating at different frequencies right so between the first church age and the last church age going back to the eighth day hallelujah the man's voice was sounding at one frequency but now the bride is supposed to speak the woman is supposed to sing and the thing goes into a hierarchy anointed by the holy spirit because what she is going to bring forth the word of god this is not the hour of the headship of the body though he is still in preeminence and control but this is the body ministry this is where she is able to express the word express him her life expresses christ her walk her words whatever her actions expresses jesus christ is this making any sense to you or am i just you know rambling around like that i hope you're getting what it is uh that i am really saying amen thank god hallelujah so friends i want you to know that right now we are hearing the same bible not anything different nothing added nothing taken out of it we're hearing the same message the same quotes we even hearing the same preachers everywhere with the same message but some seem to be singing in a hierarchy bringing the word in a higher level of spiritual tones for the glory of god now we have the same audience some of you have been hearing the word of god here with me for 27 years and others are here for maybe less time but it's the same audience i know it grows from time you know you baptize it two more three more four more ten more whatever praise god hallelujah but you know my policy i don't believe in just having one great big church with thousands of people i could have had that if i wanted that right and uh but always there are churches coming off of the original as soon as a a young man a young couple seemed competent they're able the spirit of god inspires praise god like brother joshua charlotte out in new brunswick this one here this one there whatever it's always like a human body it's constantly what should i say renewing itself is constantly growing multiplying like that praise god so it's not just growing bigger bigger bigger bigger bigger because that human human senses are satisfied by that and numbers the human senses are satisfied by that it speaks about whether the man that is preaching is successful rather than god's word being magnified and him being glorified but god's we have gone through the church has gone through not this church but the church all those stages and it's back to the book of acts how the apostles had it whether they were under a house or whether they were in some back street somewhere and i believe sometimes we are better off with we went back to them all days with a guitar and a tambourine and singing and praising god seeing the power of the holy ghost and the demonstrations of the holy spirit my what we have now we got to use music to drum it down we got to work it up are we not here to work up ourselves we're here for the holy spirit to come and move and trouble the waters oh praise god that you might step into that anointing and just being in the presence of the resurrected christ that anointing healing miracles signs and wonders not because i call for it but because his presence is here his power is here there's another being in here that is not me there's no glory to me i better watch what i say because that person is listening and if i exalt myself you say okay let me see you do it by yourself and he just stepped back no so a real sermon of god watches careful careful why because he does those things right you see this is what book of acts said while peter yet speak the holy ghost fell on all them that heard the word amen praise god hallelujah and you have said it you've seen it before speaking in the middle of speaking some cough the cancer up on the floor you don't have for me to go and then oh that is a miracle man that man has a lot of power in the holy ghost and no no no no no no no the cancer got scared of the presence of jesus christ in the church in the believers hallelujah this is not me or you or anybody it's him glory to our god in the highest be his holy name praise god hallelujah amen look the spirit takes the same song it's the same bible same word same message but god begins to reveal it and inspire it by the holy ghost let me show you what i mean luke chapter 24 reading from verses 27 to 32 we're not going to read that now but just so it's on the tape also it goes out on the internet this is about jesus our risen lord not the word that they're buried in a grave of theology in a not cemetery but seminary that buried him there it's okay to go to one i'm not calling them down because as you know i went to one but then i'm out of it just i'm not saying like paul but paul said that dumb and ash that i might win christ the anointed one within my heart and life a reality praise god not knowledge of word praise god but here my friends i want you to see that the r is here when jesus the risen word for he was always the word they put him and entombed him in a a roman tomb with stones of doubt and fear to block the people from the world but thank god an angel rolled the stone away eyes were opened hearts were encouraged and jesus began to walk again on the earth and as the disciples were mourning and crying at the cross at the cross jesus died and easter time all in black crying but then what happens suddenly like the pillar of fire did when moses was looking to sheep the fire was in the bush and here comes this man stepping out of the bushes beside the roadway and he says uh who is this christ that you're talking about don't you know i mean you have you been to jerusalem don't you know and they began to relate to him how their lord came and he was sick he was good and he was kind and everything else and then they crucified him and rather to uh align themselves with barabbas a known murderer and a thief of faith and not only of money but they align themselves with him and they be and said now he's buried dead and they were we're going back to where we came from going back to our old church our old home wherever and they were mourning and jesus said all you fools and slow in heart to believe and the bible says take and from moses he took the scriptures and began to explain to them the bible says about himself the word for he is the word so he was explaining and interpreting and teaching their word to them after he was risen why before he was risen the bible said he spoke in parables but now here he is talking to them plainly listen friends god is his own interpreter and he will make it plain praise god everything i say check it with the word recognize whether these things be the truth oh my praise god hallelujah he went back over the same things that they had already heard from him wouldn't that be boring but it was not because he was opening up the scriptures to them in a new way so that they can see what was hidden back there in the word the types the shadows the substitutions and so on the the various transformations coming forth out of the word of god and so then as they began to hear it praise god we know friends that they they said uh come and stay with us and and so you know the rest of the story he went with them and then all of a sudden he disappeared and they said oh is not this the christ amen did not our hearts burn within us as we listen him along the way praise god i trust this morning your hearts are burning within you that you are recognizing the presence of almighty god that he's the same yesterday today and forever oh praise god in the greater witness than john this was said we know that there is a higher realm that we can climb into and we are going into it higher someday i believe that's this day that we are living in right now this is the hour when god is lifting us up into a higher level praise god forevermore hallelujah don't we sing the song lord plant my feet on high your ground lord lift me up and let me stand by faith on heaven's table and a higher plane than i have found lord plant my feet on high your ground a higher ground of understanding a higher ground of revelation a dimension just beyond the sound of human heirs just beyond the reach of human intellectuals it can't go there it cannot because it's another dimension whatsoever to illustrate do you know tv waves are passing through this room right now why you can't see them you don't have the you're not built with equipment to see them but a real prophet standing here i am not one so look at me but uh could look and see those waves passing right or praise god and there is an actual other realm out there another dimension amen and that's what god would take the prophets and put them in that realm and when you're lying to them they are seeing what you did and what not and what not and what you said and you can't escape because he just bring them on the border of his thoughts and of his mind and so that's what happened and they begin to be able to see those things for the glory of god now understand clearly here also that um dealing with dogs i have a whistle at home when you blow it there's nothing that my ears can really hear but like the wind passing through it but you know the sound they say is coming out at a high pitch in another dimension that only the dogs can hear and they use those bristles to train dogs you can ask a real dog trainer and they'll tell you that those whistles dog whistles are used to train dogs because it does emit a sound but it's not the sound the human heirs can pick up and i'm trying to tell you by the word of god that the holy spirit has lifted this word of god into a higher dimension and it takes the spirit of god to anoint you that is why the book of revelation says let him that had an ear to hear let him or her here that means some wouldn't hear but if you were elected you were anointed you're born with a purpose you're born with god's purpose in his mind in your life he will open your ears and you will hear the disciples were puzzled by this they said master how is it while you are teaching that that we understand we we hear but the pharisees the sadducees they don't understand what what you're saying he said because unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom but unto them it is not given let him that an ear to hear let him or her hear the word of god amen praise god forevermore yes sir so we know that the word is going forth but not only what your natural ear can hear but beyond that it's speaking and each one of you right now are receiving your portion of what god intends for you and that is what you are hearing yet we are hearing the same thing but yet i am hearing something a little different from what you were here but that depends on your needs and what he knows that you need let me back up a little bit here you understand that eternal life did not begin on a certain date where you can go and say oh i was saved on september the sun nineteen or the fifth or the twenty first uh in nineteen hundred that's wonderful that's when you became aware that you need to repent or turn around and commit your life to jesus christ but like like i said in the school while i was in there and the question asked and um how come you saying hell's eternal uh i said yes it's eternal well how come can you say that when the bible says hell was created for the devil and his angels so therefore um you know i carry the thought a little further therefore that means that those personal people will have eternal life just like i do because they'll have to burn in hell eternally and if they're burning eternally that means they have eternal life are you trying to tell me eternal life is just based on your geographical location and position no of course not right eternal means without beginning and without end which means the true child of god or children of god were in the mind of god before the foundations of the world and my thoughts on me are one right i'm one with my thoughts uh but then i have to speak those thoughts and then if i have to work or do something or carve or paint or create it then you'll see my thoughts now expressed that's what god did with the human race and in the human race is his elected children and those elected children have eternal life but he has to make them conscious of what is in them and who they are that you are not just anybody walking around but you are a son of the heavenly king your kings and priests are god by the holy spirit amen glory to god i thank god for that that oh that he made me aware of this conscious of his divine presence and of his word within my heart and life amen praise god and i'm glad that every day we can go higher and higher praise the lord of course there's a lot more i can say about these things and i'm going to do my best begin to wind this up praise god hallelujah oh praise god we're going up in the first resurrection higher every day wiser blessed lord and thy blessed holy word oh praise god forevermore first round justification second round sanctification third round what baptism holy spirit but now what lot of pentecost doesn't realize god has gone past that for our god is marching on this is not just a baptizo uh to be baptized in the spirit but the bible says my friends clearly that the holy ghost himself praise god i you know jesus was a seed corner of each seed he told how he would go in the ground how he would multiply himself a thousand fold or whatever but when it comes back up it will be what seed again but in a multiplied form he is just saying here i am in the head ship as one seed of god the one seed and now i go into the ground i multiply myself and i come back up looking like a church looking like a many member body but yet that many member body is him expressing himself truth uh through true believers that will believe his word thanks be to god so i give you the call again come up higher i think it's in isaiah chapter 55 verse 9 he said my thoughts are not your thoughts my thoughts for my thoughts are higher than your thoughts see god's thoughts is in the higher realm and the holy spirit wants to take us there oh praise god hallelujah let me end this now it hasn't ended but i'm going to end here because i feel that you've had enough for today i won't be guilty of feeding a banana or a plant in or a steak to a baby or to children they have to be ready to receive everything they've received or you over feed them is that right you overfeed them and then they get colic or something like that you know praise god god bless every one of you thanks for being here thanks for putting up with me right because when when the spirit begins to move sometimes you you behave different than you normally do praise the lord god bless you can the musicians come [Applause] hallelujah god is god praise be to god hallelujah wanted me wonderful there having no burdens to bear joy and sweet singing hallelujah praise god sister elaine's dad as you know has gone to be with the lord has passed on and our hearts go out to her and to her mother of course we pray the holy spirit will continue this great healing process that uh they will of course miss him but we know that when a real christian dies it's not a leap into the dark but absent from the body present with the lord that's where it's at amen so thanks be to god for his goodness praise god help me out brother won't it be a wonderful day [Music] happy birthday joy
