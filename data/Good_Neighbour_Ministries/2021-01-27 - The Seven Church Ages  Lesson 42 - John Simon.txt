TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] when i see the blood when i see the blood when i see the blood hallelujah i will pass i will pass over you good wednesday friends may the lord bless you real good as we come together in the house of the lord may the great holy spirit apply the word of god to our hearts and lives and to our understanding that we may grow in grace as we mature in jesus christ the lord bless you as we read from exodus chapter 12 reading verse 13 and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt praise be to god my friends it's roundup time it's going home time now you know in the old west or in the pampas of brazil uh uh or any of those great south american nations there's a time when all the ranchers all the cattle ranchers move their herds to one place for ship shipping uh to government locations and places where there is the need and market for beef and therefore the government will send their their their inspectors and rangers to uh inspect the cattle that have been rounded up now of course because the cattle are owned by many many ranchers they will all have different differing brands various brands just as in like the churches of today and like the hour and time that we are in the great governor above is now gathering in and so all the churches all the people that name the name of christ and claim him as their lord and savior are gathering their people in each one carrying their church brand or the name of their various churches upon them but even though they have the brands the government inspectors the angels the the men anointed of god by the great holy spirit are not there on the scene to check the brands so much of those cows or of the animals or if you want to say the angels checking the individual believer not as to their membership god is not interested in what church you're a member of or i belong to this or i'm a baptist or i'm a methodist or i'm a uh anglican or a presbyterian congregational jehovah witness whatever name you would like to stamp brand on your self your forehead your neck whatever that is your concern between you and your maker but what they are checking for not your church name not your brand name but god sifting out the wheat from the tears separating the chaff from the grain separating the genuine from the make believe he sends them to check out those animals with the blood test and i want to say the day naturally speaking all of us we need a blood test and more importantly we need a spiritual blood test because unknowingly uh we may look well we may act well or behave uh well a person may even behead like a christian and that could be evil in disguise so you must have the blood test you must be tested by the spirit of god as to the condition of your blood because you may be having bad blood uh you may be having mad blood you may be oh lord have mercy god help me i tell you friends you may be having some kind of mixed up blood flowing within your veins and it will take a real doctor of the scriptures like dr simon peter act acts chapter 2 3 and 4 you'll find dr simon peter there checking the people and finally coming to the conclusion that they have some bad traditional blood in them and they need to cleanse their blood and the only cleansing they can have is by the cleansing of the blood of jesus christ the name of jesus christ repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit amen may god help us today as we look into the word of god and see we need to have god's blood test for it's he is the one the great governor the government of heaven government of the kingdom testing his children trying them proofing them so that he uh or they will know who they really are who their real father is where they come from and where they are going so we are not here to look at brands uh we are not here to look at church names we are looking for the blood for the scripture says when i see the blood i will pass over you but i believe in our modern age lots of people are making the mistake or misreading misunderstanding this scripture for it does not say when i see your brand when i see your church name i will pass over you no god is not interested in that he is only interested in the blood and he wants to test us to see what blood we have in us as i before said you may have bad blood you may have mad blood uh you may god is not arrested in your race god is not interested in your religion god is not interested in your affiliations god is not interested in your educational level god is not interested in your financial matter for nothing matters to him except that you need that blood test your blood must be tested and if you delay you don't want to get it tested then you may find that you uh you suddenly grow sick or you're suddenly ill or you could even die just yesterday afternoon i was speaking with an individual who was letting me know how that their mom who is up in years now went to the eye doctor for uh an eye test and in testing the eye the doctor said from the way the blood is moving in your eye you have a problem with the blood flow in your heart and you'd better rush now and have yourself tested for you can you you're now open to getting a sudden stroke or you can die so this is an emergency you need to have a blood test and thank god that dear woman went to have her blood test and uh when she was tested the doctor says no you cannot even go home you have to stay right now they took her in operated she had a problem with her heart and if she had delayed her heart would blockage what would have gone on and she would have expired and gone to the great beyond however as of today the woman is fine and she is strong she is in a state of recovery and rejoicing because her life was saved praise god hallelujah oh praise god my friends uh i may not be a natural eye doctor but the holy spirit allows me to see things in the word amen and may the holy spirit by the holy spirit i want to advise you that you should have this blood test have your blood tested your cholesterol your different levels have it tested see what kind of a blood you may need some bitter experiences come into your life to cleanse your blood to purge your blood and to make it the way god allow it to be the way god wants it to be oh praise his marvelous wonderful name amen hallelujah god looking down says the soul that's in it it shall die because that soul is separated from him and it cannot approach him whatsoever for all have sinned and have come short of the glory of god amen but thank god as we look into the old testament when the entire human race was caught in the trolling of sin god took tell the priest to take an animal and took its life and there the life of the animal was taken instead or in substitute for the life of the sinner and so without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins and so that sinner would have to bring a lamb up to the temple and the high priest would let the sinner lay his hand on the head of that lamb and there the high priest would then cut the trout of the lamb the blood will be spraying and sprinkling everywhere blood will be on the on the person that brought the lamb as their substitute amen and so the sinner would feel the bleeding and the bleed hair the bleeding of that lamb he will feel the body quivering body of that lamb before him as it stiffened in death before him and then it would be placed on the fire he will see the smoke of the sacrifice ascending up to heaven unto god and then my friends with joy in his heart he knew the lamb had died in his stead he knew the lamb had taken his place he knew that that innocent lamb that did nothing had forfeited his life instead of the sinner forfeiting his own life but and he knew that the lamb had forfeited his life so that the innocent life of that dying lamb could come back and rest upon that person that was a sinner as a covering to hide their sins from the holy eyes of god and so the blood of an animal not being equal or the life of animal not being equal to the life of a human could only cover sin but it could not take away sin therefore back in the old testament we find that they would go out with the same desire with which they came in though they were protected though they were covered they will go out with the same desire to commit sin as when they came in and thus you will find in the old testament scripture that they had to come back year after year to make sacrifices and offering for their sin all my friends but thank god the scene changes glory to his marvelous name for in this new testament we find this dying lamb the son of god jesus christ hallelujah the bible says he gave his life as a ransom not for one sinner but a ransom for all for many and by faith we walk up to him and we lay our hands upon the head of our dying lamb as in the words of the song dear dying land thy precious blood has never lost its power and there may i o praise god we lay our hands upon our dying lamb and that dying lamb being jesus christ hallelujah we believe that by holding on to him by faith amen amen and seeing his bloody wounds seeing the blood flowing from his head his hands and his feet his lacerated back with the roman whips upon him we feel the pain we hear him cry eli elia lama sabach and i amen my god my god why hast thou forsaken me and what happened the bible said he gave up the ghost he gave up the ghost hallelujah what ghost the holy ghost was in him and he gave up the ghost and so the life that was in him or the holy ghost was in him was now released the life that was in him was now free it was once in one man named jesus christ our representative but when our dear dying lamb laid his head down and gave up the holy ghost the holy spirit is now made available it's in the atmosphere in the world today available for everyone that will sincerely believe that with all their heart that the reality of the power of the holy spirit and the presence of the holy spirit to fill you to anoint you to take your life and make it over again and to express himself through you and use you for the glory of his marvelous name thank god the holy spirit who is the life that was in the blood has now come back and is here to come upon every one of us repentant sinners oh precious is the flow that makes me whiter snow no other fountain i know nothing but the blood of jesus hallelujah the life of him came back upon us you see as i said god has to give us the blood test amen because you need a blood test for the purposes of your natural health and of your spiritual health you need a blood test to show what is your origin who really is your father we're living in a day in the hour when the bible says that i will come when they're gonna take women they're not just gonna marry women they're just gonna take them live with them making a whole lot of children but not taking responsibility for them instead of marrying them and protecting them and preserving them and watching over them but no the bible says they're going to marry in giving they're going to just take women and carry on like that and so the children are born and one woman may have children from so many different fathers that they don't know which one is their father so many people joined so many churches going to this church that church there are baptismal methodists they're listed after a while their head is spinning their denominational mental chaos and don't know where they come from don't know where they're going uh they're more interested are am i going to be buried in the in the catholic they're real ground am i going to be buried in the anglican burial ground i'm not going to be buried in the methodist battleground that's not important to the real child of god because my friends when you get the real blood test it'll tell you that your father is not mr baptist mr methodist mr catholic mr anglican mr whatever he calls his name but your father is jehovah jesus god in heaven and you look up to him oh my father i repent i'm coming home lord i rest my navy soul in thee oh i give thee back the life i owe that in thy crimson flow it might be richer and fuller be oh praise god forevermore yes brother and sister that is why we come to him by for this wonderful blood test amen so that we might know who our father is many times people have a genealogy test and when their blood is checked they say oh that person whom you think is your father is not really a father this blood test shows that this person over here is your father oh my friend we got to have the real blood test i'm talking in the natural but i'm trying to point you to the fact that we don't go by church names affiliations who brought you up how many years you spent in this church i was too you know my entire life and childhood was in this certain that has nothing to do with it when god checks you you'll find out oh lord my father my mother is not this one that one or the other one but i recognize lord jesus you are my real spiritual father i'm coming home to you lord i turn away from my past i turn away from the mistakes that i have done lord i walk away from it all let the dead pass bury its dead god with heart within and god overhead forgetting the kings which are behind i now press to the mark which is in christ jesus my lord and my savior to whom i commit my life now seriously sincerely oh god reverently i repent i ask for your forgiveness and i ask for the cleansing of the blood of jesus christ to flow through my veins all the blood from emmanuel's veins may the blood from his body flow through my body and made the blood from him that cleanse me let it cleanse me now and purge me of all the things that were in my life and make me a true uh uh a new creature a new person in jesus christ to have a new beginning a new walk and oh god and new fatherhood with my father and his family praise god hallelujah forevermore all glory to his marvelous and wonderful name amen praise god with the cleansing of this blood all the bad blood all the mad blood all the evil wants to pass out from you and you go back without this desire to go around sinning around and now you possess a hatred for the works of the flesh and the lusting of the flesh and desires of the world you're still in the flesh body and the devil will tempt you but you have no desire to respond to his evil tests trials temptations tribulations whatever he may bring your way you trust that the blood of jesus christ cleanses you from all sins and make you a child of god what is our life it's like a vapor like a smoke what is your natural life where did it come from your natural life was passed down by your daddy your father for the life is in the blood and the blood comes from the male the female provides the egg and together with that uniting time the blood cell and the egg produces that child who comes forth and that is why the blood from the male egg from the female praise god that is why the woman takes on the man's name and the children that are born for him by her take on not the woman's name but the man's name hallelujah he has a place that he put his name and he put it on his children he put it on his wife it's like a claim i claim this woman as my own i claim these children as my own i am now responsible for her i'm now responsible for them i now protect her uh i now protect these children i now provide for her i now provide for these children for i am their father all glory be to god hallelujah or friends that is what happened at redemption remember the bible tells us that the holy ghost came upon mary overshadowed her and she bore a son and they called his name that's the earthly name of god is jesus christ amen let me repeat god's earthly name is jesus christ all the others before were only titles father is a title son is a title holy ghost is a title jehovah a title these were all titles but now this name is jesus just like you and i were born and then when you were born you were given a name here on the earth that they call you by and so god being the eternal spirit elohim when he came to the earth in a flesh body they had to give it a name and the name it was given was jehovah our savior and that is what jesus means jehovah has become our savior and so we see that the blood cell came to mary through the spoken word of the angel gabriel thou shalt bear a son and his name shall be called jesus and he will be the savior he will save your people from their sins hallelujah praise god and so friends down from his glory to become our savior our god and savior came and jesus was his name and he came from galilee to gethsemane golgotha to become our sacrifice the hebrew word will be our goel he came to be our kinsmen redeemer to take our place as the old song says he took my place at calvary oh glory to god hallelujah and that is what he did shed his blood and gave up the ghost now as you know when i was in pentecost many other people are still caught in those various uh traps or those various denominational names i was taught to believe that the blood of jesus was just the red chemical that we could imagine and believe flowed out of his body but they forgot one thing the bible already told us the life is in the blood the life is in the blood so when jesus died and the blood flowed out it wasn't so much the red corpuscles of the chemicals but that life he gave up the ghost went back to heaven and under their pentecost the bible says he came back down upon the believers in the form of the holy spirit the holy ghost that came out of him came back down for their life was released from in that blood and came to us hallelujah and that same spirit of life to dwell within our hearts within our lives and to set us free amen and so we don't have to come back year after year amen like jesus told peter uh you don't need to be for me to wash you again right it's just your hands and your feet that's why you need to have the washing of the saints feet which is to say your daily walk you can repent of that every night every day ask god to cleanse that part of you but as far as your soul is concerned once you're truly genuinely washed you're washed forever and cleansed by the blood of jesus christ and by one sacrifice he has set us all free if we are willing to accept the change and allow him to turn our lives around repent to turn back turn around go in the opposite direction from which you might be living now and let god have his way and have the victory of dominion over sin by receiving the life of christ in you and then he reigns as lord of lords having victory over the world of flesh and the devil god promised by the great prophet isaiah i'll give you a sign and the great sign that i will give you is that a virgin will conceive and bear a son that will be your saying oh praise god that will be an everlasting sign and his he shall be called emmanuel which is meaning what god with us glory to god hallelujah and thank god he has come down amen once more to dwell not in jesus back there but in you and me here today praise god and making you another manifestation of emmanuel god walking up and down amongst the people in you and me the unrecognized presence of the living god living and moving in the life of the true believer walking here upon the earth oh glory to his wonderful name amen thank god the blood cell for mary came to her not by her going with a man but the blood cell came to her through the spoken word of god and that brought life amen to fulfill genesis chapter 3 verse 15 how that you will bruise the serpent's head amen and he will bruise his heel praise god and there in the body of mary in the church in the body of mary was created a body for god to dwell in type of the true believer of course amen praise god and so we know how he was born how he grew and how he was sacrificed he was washed by john the baptist as a sacrifice and the holy spirit came upon him like a dove amen praise god hallelujah oh this is my beloved son hallelujah in whom i am pleased to dwell in that's the life that came back upon the sinner and that is why when that life is in you he says because i live you shall live also amen thank god born again free from sin i'm happy night and day oh hallelujah aren't you happy today or if you're not fully happy if you're not certain then while i'm yet speaking or after i'm finished may that brother that minister that person lead you to christ where you can repent of all your past the mistakes that you made oh my yes sir all the r's that you have wasted are so many oh the hours that you've taken up oh my friends may god forgive us cleanse us wash us and make us all over again that he might live in us that we might not produce an imitation of christ but we will produce the reality of the very life of christ living in us and through us for his glory for real christianity is not you trying to be like jesus but real christianity is the real christ living in you and living out his own life and you cease from your own works your own trying your own striving and allow him to live through you christ in you your hope of glory blessed be the name of the lord how striking it is the great jehovah come down crying over a manure pile jehovah born in a manger take a nip born not in only a manger back there or a manure pile back there but in this stinking heart mind and life of ours rotten with sin that he would come and lay in the manger of your heart and mine amen to a proud puffed up intellectual annoyed all generation oh my friends god has come and manifested himself in the lives and hearts of the true believer think of it baby jehovah allowed himself to be represented in the form of a baby crying in a manger the form of his holy spirit crying in me and you crying out the gospel sound of the word of god and to them it seems foolishness the doors that know not the wisdom of god it seems rough crude and foolish not systematic intellectual uh presentational and all that sort of thing which that is good but to hear the voice of god speaking through the heart of the true believer and crying out come to me son come to me child come to me my people god the great shepherd calling out his sheep and my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not fall follow no praise god jehovah living dying rising and coming again amen that same day on mount calvary the sun set and darkness fill the land you can place it the s-u-n set there naturally but the spiritual mind shows you that it was the s o n of god sun set and spiritual darkness covered the land that tried to put him in a tomb as they've done did with the church during the dark ages of of spiritual babylonian inquisition and they tried to hold him there three days three nights but god brought him out luther wesley back to pentecost and pentecost gives what resurrection came out of that praise god hallelujah he raised up and brought back a glorified body in which he lived to fulfill his word jehovah come back like a mighty rushing wind moving by his spirit amen now coming to stay and live within his people to heal his people to live in his temple to raise up his people to baptize them and fill them with the spirit of of all kinds of interpretation and anointing and miraculous divine power in the world that would attract the attention of the people that they might know he lives in me he lives in me oh the god of all heaven and earth now lives in me and when they recognize that it's god in you not you but him working in you it brings their attention back to the word of god hallelujah we serve a mighty god not only able to heal sickness but he can heal the sensitive soul he can save the sin sick dying soul save the prostitute save the adulteress and the adulterers the fornicators the dirty living people in this world he can save the intellectual oh the financially so-called successful but dead in your sins and in your iniquity oh the same god that does that can save the champagne drinking official as well as he can save the drunkard in the street god can save the secret smoking woman or man as well he can save the cigar puffing banker up there a mighty god and his love and grace is great and mighty oh praise god hallelujah down from his glory ever living story my god and savior came and jesus was his name oh what condescension bringing us redemption that in the dead of night not one faith hope in sight god gracious tender laid aside his splendor stooping to woo to win and save my soul thank god that he came and shed his precious blood as i wind up and conclude what i'm saying here tonight shed his blood to set the captives free came and redeemed his lost sheep some of these things i'm saying here i wouldn't even bother to expand or come comment on them captives free lost sheep somebody owned you before you got lost and he's now calling you back again giving us eternal life eternal life life on ending where we cannot perish for he that liveth and believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he also live and the bible tells us he won't lose not one of them that believes on him but he will raise them up in the last day lord hallelujah thank god we cannot be hurt by the second death yes the first death of natural body we all grow old and we may physically die physically in the natural body but that soul when it's repented once it's come under the power the empowerment and the transformation of the blood of jesus christ it cannot die and the second death has no power over us and it has no power over us because we belong to the lamb his name is on us he owns us he claims us he is the great victor the mighty conqueror the overcomer and we follow him wherever he goes and where does he go he says i go to prepare a place for you that where i am there you may be also and what do we know he's gone into the past the veil into the heavens where the glory never fails oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah to the lamb may the lord watch over us cleanse us may the lord take us with him as we surrender our lives to him that we might rise up live for him while we're on earth that we may be caught up together with him in the air the rapture and live with our lord forevermore may god forgive us of our sins everyone cleanse us wash us and bring us once more together again on sunday morning with a new life with a new hope a new walk a new future praise god thank god we serve a god of a second chance that he can give us a second chance of life a second chance to walk with him live for him represent him and to just allow him to live his own life through us that we can become a living manifestation of the presence of god in these last days may the lord richly bless you and watch between us until we come together again god bless you my friends [Music] you
