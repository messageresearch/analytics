========================================
Wednesday night Bible site so we're just going to be looking at some things that many of us are familiar with Thank You Michelle tonight we're gonna be looking at our title tonight is lent to me time it's the hour that you know things really start to company and we need not so much to be looking at others around us and all the circumstances we need to be looking at our walk and looking to see what it is that the Lord is requiring us in this hour because God didn't just decide about I'll choose there than ever hope she was for her and you know maybe this one here looks pretty good she's pretty this one's good you know it has nothing to do with any of that it's all because God had a wonderful place God so let's pray then we'll go to the word tonight and if you can pray and you're in need of something to might have the Holy Spirit will meet your need praise God that's what the cavity that's why it's so important for us together what a privilege and what an honor it is to gather with saints of light precious baby oh god it just pleases you father when there's faith in the house and that there's desires and needs or God and it's based on green or based on you know so likes and dislikes but it's based on the power of the Living God deliver to meet needs to challenge Lord that your word is true and that Lord that your promises you never fail to honor your word and your promises and with the people gathered in that way when they know they are they know why they've been elected why they've been called an abrasive of pain and a presence in the house and people can just Lord be blessed and receive that which they have beaten and that is our desire to pay sincerely father that we would just fellowship with you and let your spirit come and minister to every lead Greta we pray father we just commit every need into your heads Lord those that are not present Lord may it be with that watch over them all the current requests that have been going on all the needs that have been his soul relevant this week in the hearts of your children Lord may there be an answer tonight father may be something that we could leave here insane was good to be in the house of the Lord blessed be a wonderful name in Jesus [Music] so let's head back to chapter 25 verses 1 to 13 very familiar we're just going to look at it a very simple way the Holy Spirit is gonna you know give you what you have made and show you where you are what you know we're the time of the season that were living in because of so relevant that we know the time you know the season we know what God requires we you know God has always made it clear and simple when he wants to make something no he just brings it to pass you just simply use it some people to manifest his word and that's how he interprets his word he's his own interpreter Matthew 25 he says then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and fell to meet the bride by foolish and five were wise those who were foolish what they took perhaps they took no oil with them otherwise they took oil in their vessels with their lamps a lot of the privately delayed they all slumbered and slept but at midnight there was a cry behold the cried through is come come out to me in then all those virgins arose and trimmed their necks notice they all through their lives the bluish said to the wise give us some of your oil for our lamps are going out of the lives as and what if there isn't enough for us and you you go rather to those who sell and buy for yourselves while they might away to buy the bridegroom came and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast and the door was shut afterwards the other virgins also came saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered we'll certainly I tell you I don't know you watch therefore for you don't know the day or the hour in which God bless you Lord on his blessings of the word tonight wow you know we read this and we the current preached over and over again and you know every time I read that scripture it just excites my soul it just gets me so excited because I know in this day in this hour the key to the to the door the key to a lot with God the key to know that you recognized your David's message is that you know that you've received the Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost it's impossible it's impossible to please God and the Holy Ghost is faith the Holy Ghost is Christ himself come to you in a personal way and come to you correctly at certain time in your life that you thought you know that you know many of us have different testimonies be come from different backgrounds we come from different situations a lot of us you know we have been in a religious environment you know where we were product and in the church believing you know Bible believing family where you know they went to church every week you know you could have been a Catholic you could have been a Baptist you know the Presbyterian whatever your background was it really became you grounded with only goals came into your life everything that you thought maybe that you needed and everything you thought that by tradition you thought that everything was going to be fine then you know you could you could just go to church like like myself you know when I was young I was an altar boy and I would go to church and I would go on Sundays you know because my sister was born every week and I thought you know I would be you know able to go there and because she would be up there singing all the time and I would be up there ringing all the time you know and I thought that that was you know that was a way of feeling justified that you know you know somehow God was gonna you know do something or that you know I would you know go to heaven one day you know it's all these conceptions in our mind and then there was a lot of people you know some they went to church every week and you know they would pray and it would give they would go out and believe you know Lord very work and they would you know live live forgot they were they were living and they could be good by works they could outshine you a million lives but yet let the Holy Spirit King regardless and I'm talking about look now when I talk about the Holy Spirit I'm talking about the revelation for your day because that is the evidence of only ghosts and God comes to the individual the Living God the mighty God the God that wants to manifest his word the thought that one supreme reality to look to the people and to the to the generation he comes and he interprets his own word and when he came to you as an individual you you had no idea that what was gonna happen to you you had no idea that you were gonna actually come in contact with the Living God and this is what we're talking about in this hour and what we read about this scripture here we hear of wise and foolish virgins you know it really starts to hold it you know because it's not that we're looking for you know that we look out there and we see all the different churches you know 2000 different operations out there and we thought that's the coolest virtue no it's not the foolish virgin remember she's a virgin she looks just like the bracket but there's a big difference one has an attribute that has a purpose in order to fulfill God's plan and the other has religion teaching clothes all kinds of you know history all that was brought up in the message I was you know I was you know every I was in the message that's great that's fantastic but that doesn't mean that you're in the classical lies hurt see we're gonna we're gonna look at things that that you know sometimes you know we knew we were poor this is a holding time this is this is where the the metal hits the road this is into the road this is you know this is where it's gotta count you know this is the last mile this is where everything comes together where there's gonna be a time where we are gonna see this world three and a half year period there's a lot you have to happen that rapture is coming to pass whether whether we think we're going to do it whether we are doing it on it it's because God's plan is good people fill it about turns over tongue and it's gonna go and one for you you think you're ready are you you you're wondering are you this is not a time for her for wondering it is is the time for you gotta know is doing something to this day to this hour and then your apartment and that you're feeding on revelation your be instructed on a regular basis by the revelation of God's Word this purpose is plan is destiny pop develop you're not just a church member in deep belong to this church and you can wander in Megiddo but it's convenient for you you know and you know you've got an opposite you think but I don't have to be there on time this is the house of the Lord this is this is where God meets with his people this is working he has a plan he has a ministry in it and it starts writing them from the sunday-school with the young people of the young children and God deals with this is his little babies and entities he's positionally placing each and every one of us even her children you wonder you think God just getting you children or do you think that God no in the end from the beginning knew exactly exactly which one he was gonna use to keep you on your knees exactly which one he was going to use to be an example to some of the other young people and you might think because no people well my children are like this listen you guys see God's pardon yeah this is not a book you're like your family and your little domain this is a body movement this is a season where the pride moves it into her position by the faith she walks by faith in she walks by inspiration she is not controlled by the emotion she's not looking at her all the emotions listen next time the lesson of the prize and the prize dates there's only ever one pride in every part of the way these days you might see - I was riding my bike along the bike path there the summer and like it was such a beautiful day was a gorgeous data and then all of a sudden I heard beautiful music my violins that sound so sweet it was so nice we were driving along and as we were coming along it was it was like a a couple of people there they were playing there you see nowadays due to see two brats it's going to become very common and it's edits and it's all because Satan is always mocking the Word of God that's a perversion of God's Word and then there's a big blood pride and there's only one group amen we got power they've just they mixed and matched it up and every kind of rich media you gotta tell you this neutral gender because didn't even know what they are anymore why because this is the hour that son and Laura right here on the earth before your very eyes don't get complacent and think that that's not yes it is normal in the world and it's not so I should have you should rejoice to know the word said as it was in the days of Sun so shall be when the Son of Man is betrayed and you've been blessed to hear the son of man to receive his word were similarities between the lives of his virgin they are were virgins indistinguishable from the outside all had their lamps at the ready so you know the scripture says they both had ups they both trim their legs these people what had the real oil that never runs drunk you see what you received as a son or daughter of God is not just like they said when I got converted I remember a lot of people said oh yeah Danny you know he's excited about something again because I'll design me that way McKenna yeah that's the way God designed me you know sometimes just my makeup it's the way God designed so when I got converted a lot of the bottle you just hop on another because I was into you know positive mental attitude I go to the seminars and I would get a lot you know I was constantly looking to improve you know self development you know like all the the teachings of the world and the New Age movement and everything else so that was just another movement you know just connected with something else and you know even myself you are just naturally got excited when something stirred me with something got a hold of me what I believed in something I believed in it I could sell it because you know that the true salesman they gotta believe in the product and somebody sees you and sees you as a Christian they know whether you believe it or not you're just trying to sell something because you've got an alter your motive you come in contact with the money there's a big difference so they thought oh he's just going home and then six months went by you received in the toil because listen you can see the supernatural to tell me after being delivered from a drug addiction that I hate that spirit out of control over my life back give it up but what I top delivered the day that I run into that got this little tank and came out of it I just knew that it would never be the same [Music] try to know because people asked me and I said you really want to know tell me what you know what really happen because the further on we go in we were neighbors and in a lot of you might know here on the Galapagos course you know they're they're huge there's well the the owner of Lagos you know the only surviving brother of all of them was a very very that he stood as a good friend and he came up to me and he Danny what happened he took this is what he said to me I said okay so I said I came in contact with the living not many I got supernaturally delivered from things in my life that has changed my life that is taking my life into a completely different direction I actually meant that's the way I expressed I said that's all I can tell you it's a reality and it bubbles and he never stops and he just keeps feeding me [Music] the desire to start to rise up he just raises the standard inside [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so you can never take that away from the Sun that the people that they're talking about in the word of God the one that word it just never goes track you know that you can never take away and you can always overcome because of that because [Music] place you into this ministry to fail I realize that was supernaturally placing and giving giving baby to over countless situations and to give you a destination and a home this way beyond hope it's a reality there's hopefully they can tell me that has any kind of [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is Gloria you know this one fear don't live here anymore when I say do we use is to try to bring you down you know what he uses to try to get you this fear evidence [Music] the only gear that you should have the fear of God [Music] you conference because God promised they are all profess to know Christ intimately as the silence you know you go there you know you can right here in the midst and in the ranks of this message you know the revelation is holding it's getting it's getting more and more personal as we would entitle the revelation of Jesus Christ and the rapture is not getting more of an international knowledge an international public show if that's what you're looking for you're gonna miss it it's becoming more and more personal to you as an individual it is God speaking to you personally giving you revelation of the fishes that are going on around you you just need to watch your mind watch your spirit get yourself settled down don't get so anxious and gets so excited you know just settle down to learn only spirit speak to you he'll give you the instruction and the leadership that you need and because why because you haven't interviewed walk with God that's what the pride has been to groom the bride's babies they sit back they look they wonder they see oh they're gonna be going on I wonder where they're going the bride knows where she's going the bride knows what pleases husband you see this is the hour that were limited and now these are the differences that separate us from the rest of the church Christian world so this is people go to church this you know people are filling the house of the Lord every Sunday they're all good to me to figure I'm going to meet with the bridegroom and then there's the few that the bridegroom is going to meet it's not so much that here gonna be him it's more in that he's gonna meet you Pixlr speak your name he's going to tell you about your situation he's going to get personal with you he's going to show you things that matter but come to pass in your life he's going to get more personal with you he's gonna give you more confidence you know what better way to start the day than to know that when you put your feet on the ground you've got a partner that's gonna walk with you who he's going to talk to you he's gonna destruction goddess goddess has given [Music] angels instruction to minister to you to provide for you because God could be here right now that can be right on the other side of the world right now ministering to this children because his ugly side he's he's eternal he can do all things he said we cannot living God in the way that we perceived him with our own understanding we have to see him in the way that he he he emanates himself through the Word of God he says all things not some things but all things so everybody goes up everybody goes you know to do to be with God but you know we're living in to the Lord because remember this careful it shows us from the beginning to the end what actually happens how the you know the the the bridegroom came and he shall be called and all of these things have given us so many things in the message and then the prophet of God all of the books above the shovel to the the Trump of God and we can look at all those different things but that's not my intention tonight my intention tonight is to get personal is to get personal with God to see where we couldn't you know fine-tune our own block where we can trim our lives because what happened is that after the project we would call came they all started to slumber and sleep because they heard he was going to come God said the Prophet said he's coming and when you listen to the proper to God and you hear him preach it and you think but I remember when I was back at the early you know the mid nineties when I was first listening to these messages and I thought then and the Holy Spirit under the building God Jesus could come tonight that's how real the word was and he'll be our twenty-some-odd you know it's twenty four and a half years later of still right here and I'm more excited about the Word of God a more excitable a toastie it hasn't gotten complacent oh yeah we can we can you know get like lazy in certain ways because you're dealing with this flesh and we can get to you know stages in our rocking together you haven't learned how to differentiate and not that the devil you know start playing with your mind okay you can't expect that you know that you're you're 55 or you're 65 and you're going to still be able to have you know the ability that God knew time's good luck if God gives you the energy to do that fart but don't let the devil you know put it in here right you know because there's stages in your life there's there's their seasons of your right where you do start to you know enjoy certain aspects of your life with your wife whether it be through vacations and time together and certain seasons and vacations and so forth right and not thinking that you just got to be constantly you know you got to constantly be working for God constantly up in train constantly reading the burdens of the viola that shouldn't actually be here desire regardless but you should be a free people Raymond you should not be under and customs of bondage and Latin you should not be about the law of this message oh yeah there's a listen this churches out there you might go one time you're on vacation and you go to a church people in there everything is just like so perfect and so every woman every person do you think oh my goodness is this like you know this this is like wow and then you go you had lunch and you sit down you start the fellowship and you realize the Holy Ghost is not there you can't figure it up like you know it's whatever it is I remember if I remember you know state like getting above any churches or anything else I'm not going to stapler to us or that's got nothing to do with me but I know what I've done went with the Spirit of God is it is it an individual there's a special kind of fellowship there there's a difference in the fellowship there's a there's the 19 there's a spirit there's something different because you think God is the author of confusion listen this is this is the season where we've gotta find two things we've got to see things as they should be god is love if God corrects you gives you a whipping you're still gonna feel the love if you don't feel the love of God that it wasn't the love of God it was an anger spirit it was some other kind of spirit that struck you that came against you whatever it was that counteracted you because God is perfect he is perfect on those hot breakfast children and deal with his children in such a way that you should not be after be corrected you should not be so depressed and soul so beaten up and lovely should be feeling the love of God and the Spirit of God here repenting and feeling those tears of joy coming on you yeah it's it's not tears of joy in such a way that you know that that can be sometimes experienced it's still different because God is correct you're beaten that dr. pepper it is that's this thing here that points up this thing is going to fight up you actually think that you're going to be perfect here on this earth to be in the body of Jesus Christ [Music] or whether it's race or emotion you had a winning attitude you've gotta be in a winning attitude this is the hour this is the body of Jesus Christ is a positive body your people you should be a positive person you just should be if you're not because you're feeding up too much negativity it's just that simple because you know this thing here whatever you feed it that's what's going to produce you've heard what you become what you eat well it's the truth and if you're feeding on negativity all you're speeding us now but there's something going up so sometimes you just kind of give up the right side of things you know and your attitude will determine your altitude I don't care what anybody says I've been an employer and I've hired hundreds of people over my ears and the negative people come to work for me see them okay there's there's no I'm not talking about negative there's there's there's constructive negative you know like if you've got a partner that sees things in a different way that's constructive because of their there they're the way that they perceive but when you because because you both understand each other you you create a positive result is you and me so there's there's a difference but if something's just all the time that I was fear I don't like why because the Spirit of God is not negative the Spirit of God is impossible we should be positive people the Bride of Christ she's a positive person she's a positive body people feel blessed when they're around positive people people like the energy of positive people it's just the plain fact they visit so what happens you go going back to our God there's a season now that's going on where it seems like wow you know you can get the skirt if you wonder where God is good why is this situation not changing it's a submarine time it's a time where you kind of almost fall asleep because not enough is going on around but you need to be aware the fact that the bridegroom is here he is here it's not a matter of that that he's coming he see people put him up into a into a future event we should do that that's what that's what's that's what delivered you from your situations was because he came it was in the press and he came to the moment of your need and he was present and it was thought that the liberty of that time and it's bad you should get sleepy we shouldn't get the skirt and civil awareness to cover the floor we all experience it we all get discouraged but we need to understand the season the rhythm the time and what what we can actually experience in those seasons and not get so discouraged but understand of the season you don't wanna get to the point where you just fall asleep and you're not useful anymore in the body of Christ there's a lot of people that's what's happening they're actually slumbering they're not taking their positions seriously and it affects the body it has an effect upon the ministry amen we don't want to be going to sleep but that's like the difference between the wise and the foolish virgins his son picked up this know you should be doing it says suffer done the others have only a form of godliness now put on the dummies that's not going to work you cannot pull down you can't pulled up so don't employ honor you gotta get serious with your watch you gotta get to a place where you just want because you need it before God let deal with your situations let's scatter out the unbelief to your right because that's all it is it's just ugly it's just stubbornness is just things that you would want to make go up because this thing here is gonna fight you it's going to decide are the things of this world it's gonna possibly love know I deserve this I'm deserve that we all deserve hell that's what we deserve it's a little place where you realize you gotta surrender certain things you gotta let go certain things you got like you know some have Christ in their heart some have made the commitment only that just you know taking on a because you think you think you can't do it some you know they they they make it a social thing this is not about a social ministry Facebook and all these things and you know they do all these these different social medias and stuff like that that's all training the people do you know what that's training the people to do not bring them together actually separate because people don't get together people just tax fine [Music] [Music] [Music] because because here you're being molded by society you're not by society you're not to be controlled we use these tools we use one purpose and that is to serve because you're right you can have you can have peace you can have rest you can have vacations you can lots of nice dinners up you can do all those things and still serve God you can because you are free as people under but we've got to get things prioritizing our lives only those likes only those who are ready and truly know Christ will be admitted into the kingdom these are things have that depth that we see from this parent because Christ was before the time came he just didn't let anybody in look at the ones that came knocking on the door he said absolutely [Music] [Music] [Music] which is an attribute of always because to be a convenient remember and in order to be DC something it has to be lost and it's gotta be lost somewhere it's got to be this equipped with a watch when you take the watch when something steals your watch it takes it to the pawn shop your watches is enough is enough a cabinet with another thousand other launches over stolen will new every single one of them he had the place of my most creative beings beings that would be used for his purpose they would have to be given and they would have met and so the foolish virgins she falls under this category that she boss to the wedding but she doesn't Rose chain she witnesses and hears about all the things that he's going to do but he will be reduced it turned her and that is the difference is that he knew you from before the foundations of the world he pleased himself a portion of himself in you and when the time came that he wanted to manifest his word in the season of this 21st century and he needed you to be positioned into the body of Christ into a certain church under a certain pastor not on your son take ministry not herself General Assembly all things differentiating the foolish in the wife virgin a wise virgin my wife she's not going to Kobe you know anything this husband one time to the Bluebird [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and that rises up for you you better watch it I'm telling you right now it'll it'll suck you right to a little an ugly and you'll wish no puffy because Shannon will always get further than you ever wonderful it's just the witness god pull this out if you are you a couple of place where you realize your past you realize your position mr. you realized the part of the body and then where God has placed you and then you give yourself you surrender you attended church on a regular basis you felt that to assemble yourself you feel that because of some excuse yes some kind of works
