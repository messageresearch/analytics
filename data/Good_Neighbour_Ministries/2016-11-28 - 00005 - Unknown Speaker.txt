========================================
tempil the world has we have got Christ amen that's right and what we ought to be letting shine in this dark hour that we are now living in is Christ let him shine out of your life amen what the world has got tensil what is really saying the world has got cheap tens the world is putting more emphasis on style rather than on substance amen hallelujah but we want to put our emphasis on the substance of the word of God or the revelation of the word of God that's where our faith is lying on Amen when you come to when you come to teaching you go on the TV those guys on the TV or those women on the TV will make us look like we are country bumpkins Dr Charles Stanley doct this doctor that everybody's a doctor to write reverence so and so your lordship so and so and whatnot my goodness wow and when they begin to present their stuff like that why we I tell you it's amazing I admire some of them but the fact is of course I don't look look at them really I don't really look at them but if you know they turn the TV on they happen to be there cuz they start to listen and in a short while they're talking nonsense they're off the word and I can't take it I've got to I just got to turn it off cuz I I can't take it so the fact is brother sister that um that's what it is they got a whole other style but listen to them simple as we are you are listen to them the least in the Kingdom in that day the Bible says the least in the Kingdom will be great G than John is that right greater than John hallelujah praise God forever more what I'm saying to you is never mind don't be intimidated by these modern day giants walk in the land just because they have a dumb whatever behind their name praise the Lord I'm breaking into preaching I'm let me stay with teaching but uh you know ba this and PhD and whatnot and and they used that to do what they use all those titles to just gain credibility right off the bat once people he they got those letters behind they start to swallow everything that they say is that right yeah and who are you you come from out to Nowhere uh by the way what uh what university did you go to did you go to Yale haard Berkshire where what MIT [Music] whatever they don't want to hear that they want to be able to know where you went and if you don't have that say oh well yes and they'll accommodate you now right just they'll tolerate you they'll just tolerate you now and and you can say whatever you want but it's just passing through one ear go through the other a and they're not listening anymore because you don't have the credibility that comes from their educational system but you see brother Bron said God takes men we'll we'll talk about that when we get there uh he takes men um usually Sometimes some have some and some don't have nothing he took Isaiah who was a friend of the king and was in and out of the palace you know he took uh Daniel that was a prime minister in there and then turns around he takes a fisherman right uh that couldn't be read and right you see like that takes another one that was a Doctor Luke and takes another one that was this or that so the Bible is written over a period of 1600 years you know 66 book and and we have these all different authors from Kings and Priests down to fishermen to lowly people uh you know a whole range of people God is no respector of persons amen and that P fire can come into a come into a great big meeting with thousands of people bypass everybody and go right to a woman sitting there and said oh oh I see that woman is standing over her it by pass everybody went over that woman I go right over there and goes over there and it goes over oh there's that my colored sister I see or my colored brother gone over there then it goes back over there brother I see you oh I see I see uh trees they he you from Pines oh you come from the Lost Pine area of California on he call it out like that God has no respected person a farest moves and he go wherever he Wills amen is that right and the sons of God are like that they're unpredictable led by the spirit of God sons of God are led by the spirit of God and the wind blows worthless and no man knows what they're going to do next and that unpredictability is what uh gets the devil heart attack and give him all kinds of problems cuz he doesn't know what you're going to do next that's why re ation is our deadly weapon is that right you see you reading a book The Devil can read it too he's reading over your shoulder and you talking brother BR said you think you're going to use your brain or your mind or your your intelligence to uh defeat Satan he said he's a being that was there before this world was formed and he had 6,000 years of practice with his lies and tricks and everything else and you come along with 50 60 70 whatever even if you have 200 you going to think you're going to challenge him with intelligence you can't do it but Revelation now Revelation everybody that's true child of God is subject to that you can be sitting there and you're not even doing nothing and revelation will be pouring into your heart amen see Prophet says as long as you don't say anything he doesn't know what what's been revealed to you he said that's the reason why I know better when certain things are revealed to me not to say them until it happens and then it's too late he can't do anything to muddy the waters says because if you speak it sometimes before the time the devil will run ahead mess up everything mudy the waters and everything else praise God so let's live like Sons and Daughters of God that on that are living every moment of every day under the influence of divine inspiration praise the Lord and walk like that we are not simple ordinary we're not ordinary people and simple doesn't mean stupid is that right so they used to call Simple Simon I sure met the p man oh praise God but simple doesn't mean foolish see when you read the Bible and God loves simple things he wants you to act simp simple but that doesn't mean being foolish amen you see being he says except you become like a little child but that doesn't mean being childish it just means to be simple and humble be reverent and God will bless you let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father we're happy that once again we can have fellowship with the saints that we can share the word of God and build up the body of Christ bless us everyone here tonight and may we feel strengthened night after night by the word of God pouring into our souls may we walk in the light as you are in the light and as the that this great season approaches keep our our our minds and our eyes on the north star that we head in the right direction and not be the distracted by anything else but to keep our minds and our eyes on Jesus until he comes we ask this in Jesus name amen bless you just to remind you this is the weekend when the petroleum Believers are going to be here how many knows that I'm not checking up on the brothers to see if they do their job so don't think of that amen I'm just reiterating or repeating it so that not
