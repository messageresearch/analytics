prayed for me uh in the preaching of the word i pray that the holy spirit will honor your faith and bless every single person represented here thank god for the worship team here may god bless them great job we appreciate them very much let's give them a hand right now [Applause] hallelujah praise the lord yes brother i totally forgot to turn this on thank god have to turn on the mic right amen that makes a big difference when that's turned on just the same with us as believers we can believe but until the holy spirit quickens everything uh you know you just just another christian just another believer but when the holy spirit hits that when the fiery hits the combustion chamber of the heart and the spirit of god begins to move within that believer then he gives you motivation power amen it drives you you're not your own no more you belong to him praise god so we are driven and moved by the holy spirit but unless i get to talk in that way i might as well be preaching hey praise the lord we thank god for his goodness and for his grace and we will look into john chapter 14 verses 19 to 20 just two verses and i'm just going to talk with you and praise god we trust that you let the simplicity of the message reach your heart and life hallelujah chapter 14 says yet a little while and the world seat me no more but ye shall see me isn't that wonderful when the world can't see him yet we are seeing him everywhere making himself manifest because i live you shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in the father and ye in me and i in you praise the lord we'd like to emphasize that verse here today and we'd like to talk about the manifested life of christ amen the manifested life of christ our gracious heavenly father once again we are here in your presence like ruth in the field we are waiting on your coming waiting on your coming not the rapture but here with us in this building while we are yet bringing the word we pray that you will walk with us like you did on the way to emmaus we're not we are headed home to the new jerusalem but we pray that as we walk towards it that you will walk with us talk with us oh god show us the things from the prophets and announce the entire scripture unfolding yourself day after day as we walk this road with you god bless us today we pray as we surrender ourselves to thee in jesus name amen praise the lord may the lord richly bless you please be seated amen now this really is about the life of christ manifesting through you but manifesting through you without human efforts human struggle and that sort of thing amen because there's still a belief and still um shadows of teachings that tell people that they have to they have to add these things on to their lives they got to work these things until it comes to a perfection in them and uh you see the brothers that were preaching that had only a partial revelation and they were saying what they knew but the word has unfolded more until this hour and this time and now we know that salvation is of the lord it's not of the will of man it's not of you it's not of me it's not of anybody but salvation is of the lord and it is not by works of even righteousness that you might have done it's not by any human instrumentality we have been redeemed by the blood of christ not our works not our works which is only our sense of gratitude to the lord for saving us amen you already saved that's why you're grateful that's why you produce the good words to show him that you appreciate heavenly father i appreciate you i adore you i magnify you i thank you lord because you have done this for me lord hallelujah that's the reason why we're here today in the house of the lord glory be to god amen thank god [Applause] and that life the manifested life of christ amen manifesting through you doesn't manifest uh with your help with your strength with your intelligence with your wisdom he is either there in you or he is not if he is there and i believe he is with the true believer then perfection already dwells within all wisdom dwells within all knowledge dwells within all of the all of the righteousness holiness everything that you need is already dwelling within you may not be able to manifest it fully but in the mind and wisdom of the paul when he said but you've got to work out your salvation with fear and trembling you may know you're saved but that's inside of you but how you gonna work it out so that people outside of you can see that you're really saved you're really born again christ is in you of a truth amen hallelujah so that's what we're talking about and when that life begins to manifest through you then you see you don't have to walk around and say oh i better hold my temper i wouldn't look like a christian if if i don't hold my temp in this situation uh when the boss talked to me if if i react in a certain way he's going to say i'm not a christian you don't even have to think anymore you don't even have to think anymore because you are living now a life as i've said of unconscious godliness it's not you but it's him living through you and him living through you is also your spiritual identification that you are truly sons and daughters of the living god not by your effort but by his identification listen the scripture said abel offered a better sacrifice a more excellent sacrifice god testifying of his gift amen of his sacrifice that it was the right sacrifice that it was his inspired sacrifice that it was revealed sacrifice and god testified to that son abel had to say nothing about it they don't have to walk around saying oh i'm i'm a believer of jehovah i'm a christian i'm a message believer i'm i am bride and maybe the person as i've said before maybe a bridesmaid but they're calling themselves bright but the fact is that god testifies of it of himself amen until it amazes you it begins to surprise you you are shocked by the supernatural reaction of the holy spirit working through your life amen and then you know you can take no praise you can take no glory because it wasn't you to begin with you see you see now true humility is not trying to put on something to make yourself look humble he that is in you is already overcome and he is already humble so he manifests himself through you in that way so you don't have to do anything you just got to live the life of christ let him live his life working through you for his glory and honor praise the name of the lord hallelujah you remember brother branham in christ the mystery of god revealed once said at that day they'll know that i am in the father the father in me i and you amen praise god and you and me praise the lord he said what day that day he said that day is this day hallelujah and i'm glad today to let you know that this is this day that we are in that these things are supposed to be taking place now we read all the crisis the mystery of god revealed page 44 so therefore there is no school that can teach you the light he doesn't say the life of christ he says no school can teach you but the fact is no school can teach you how to live the life of christ you understand what i'm saying i want this to be so clear when you walk out here why the prophet preaches and prophesies against theologians denominations bible schools systems everything else is because it is he himself that has has to be in you living out his own life for it to be the original life it has to be him he himself hallelujah for it to be the authentic life not one that you've been trained as a hypocrite as the brother branson hypocrite means actor yeah how to act like a christian your dress is supposed to be this length your your pants supposed to be this way all these outward things which we should pay attention to because you don't have to think the holy spirit will tell you what is modesty and how to walk and how to live but the fact is they emphasize all kinds of bible studies to teach you how to be a christian is that right now to teach you how to talk like a christian how to walk like a christian how to dress like a christian how to act like one but we are finding out now as he is blowing away these chaff from before us that that was not it that's a denominational conceptions that have come down to us through the ages but is his life being lived through us by himself that is the word being made flesh again that is the son of man now being revealed in human tents just bones covered with a a skin a tent of made of skin tabernacle covered by skin and god living within the individual and making himself manifest praise the lord that is what i'm talking about here today he said so therefore you see there is no school teach you the life of christ there is no theologian can do that no teaching that any man can bring that can teach you how to be a christian is that right he's teaching you only how to be an imitation of christ he's teaching you how to be a counterfeit a faker of christ or even though you're doing that unconsciously because some people live become christians out of a good intention amen but it's just like what's happening in russia now they told them they were communists and the first couple of generations they had to force them into it after that the new generation just walk in it and take it for granted that that they are communists you see and that's the way they think about it and it's the same lie satan spreads it and then after a while people just accept what all these teachings and scores of uh what should i say uh smoke you know he chose a lot of smoke uh bombs and cause people not to see clearly out of the world what it's really all about it's not about us it's all about him amen it's not how beautiful the church not how wonderful the singing though we need that it's none of those things it's all about him in his beauty in his power and his strength glory god hallelujah is him being revealed that's the whole story christ is the mystery of god being revealed hallelujah when you stop to think of it all these bible schools and uh have probed satan lucifer has probed at the bible the written word because the written word was god in a mystery and he was probing at that to find out what was under there not knowing god already has the principle upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it oh praise god the church is built on inspiration hallelujah and now inspiration is given by grace i mean revelation is given by grace hallelujah the prophet himself said you can't dream it you can't go and discern yourself for discernment you you don't give yourself a real genuine vision like that god by grace has to give that to you and by that he identifies his elect by that he identifies his sons and his daughters his real genes and germs he identifies them by the word so satan all through the centuries been probing probing probing and he has inclinations that are very close but he can never get to the exact truth until this day when the bible declares that this will the mysteries of god would be made revealed in this hour hallelujah by a seven angel that would come down praise god now you understand that sharon angel brother branham was just a physical person standing there but like we said last week the seventh angel the one with the swept back wings that was leading all the rest of them hallelujah that was really the mighty angel of revelation 10 1 and the angel of revelation 10 1 came down to the revelation 10 7 and manifested himself through the prophetic ministry of our brother million million brethren because remember god always manifests through prophets and then prophets in the old testament prophets through the old testament and then he came on the scene emmanuel god with us and then he was not another great prophet of god as the muhammadans will say another great prophet but he was god come to be his own prophet amen god come to be his own prophet and now the cycle of truth goes on and we come back when he is no more in a one man one member body but now the corner wheat fell on the ground come up and it has multiplied itself and comes back on the scene as a as a many member body that we call the bride born from his side bonus part of him hallelujah for she is him being revealed in this last day christ in you and me making himself manifest hallelujah praise god let me just calm down here this is this making sense to you praise the lord hallelujah so you see no school no theologian no teachings in the bible done by any school that knows anything about it they cannot know anything about this for god has hid the senses of knowing that knowing it from the very even their elected teachers and everything else they cannot know it it's because it's a personal affair with the and christ himself is revealed to them hallelujah there is no no church group that that will catch the revelation all at the same time because it's an individual affair between you and god that's why we say me and jesus we got a good thing going me and jesus we got it all worked out hallelujah because it's you and him hallelujah praise be to god hallelujah amen see that's the way it is see and then if you say he has been revealed to you and that life christ produced here that was produced here in the bible if that same life that was in him does not produce itself in you now then you got the wrong revelation what is the identification not of what you are saying not of what anybody is saying about you you can tell mother teresa she's a saint you can tell this one that they are they're an apostle you can tell the other one he's this he is that but until god himself let that life project through you without your human effort you are just moving on receiving those things in vain praise the name of the lord hallelujah the life has got to be produced and projecting within your heart and life hallelujah amen and the reason why real christianity like it was in the book of acts has not been produced through all these seven church ages except for a few for god never left himself without a witness in every age you had some that were real genuine the holy ghost flow through them in every possible way but the fact is listen that this life was never been produced because the people have had wrong revelation through the ages and wrong revelation can't bring you the divine projection of the holy spirit amen it's the right word of god made known to you when you you eat the book and you project what life is in you by the holy spirit of god working within your life praise god it's out of your hands i say i said no christianity is really out of your hands amen oh i studied for for every night i studied until they break i i dedicate myself for five years ten years i went in the wilderness i did this i did that that's all good that's wonderful but that's not what did it it's he himself got to come and come to your life and begin to expand his wisdom his understanding to you and unveil himself to you and then you'll live in you and manifest himself through you amen lord of god hallelujah amen oh my praise god see the genuine life of christ could not reproduce itself and could not project through the people because it's being it was being water watered by the wrong teaching and being watered by wrong teachings that germ life could not come into germination and manifestation within the hearts of the people yet they could call themselves a christian like a woman with a stillborn born child saying she has a baby she does have a baby but it's a stillborn one amen but when the one of the holy spirit strikes the soul and that life comes forth makes itself manifest with a scream hallelujah born again free from sin i'm happy night and day oh praise god forevermore oh there's no more doubt amen because you're walking in him you are certain of god amen praise the lord oh praise god they go around this this is that it's the other if you if you if you fall in the ground if you speak in towns is you got it if you did this you got it if you walk under a certain church flag you got it if you shake the elder's hand you got it if you do this you do that they're all guessing at what it is that's just satan through his religious uh enticing spirits amen not the people now now the people don't know that he's manipulating and using whatever assets he has on the earth but he is doing that to cast smoke screens that people can't see what the truth is because he himself doesn't know the truth amen because it's been healed hallelujah and that's why that manifested life could not produce be produced hallelujah and then you'll see real manifested sons and daughters of god amen praise god listen here he says page 45 i think of christ the mystery do you know god is known by simplicity hallelujah and when god manifests himself it's going to be so simple and it can't be that that man that woman has to walk around with the air of holiness that preacher act in such a way he doesn't have any real gr as you call it princely religious graces as the catholics would say a prince of the holy church and you got you or any of these denominations they got that same daughter-like attitude they don't realize it doesn't work like that god goes the total opposite where the wind blowing where it lists that no man knows where it goes don't know what's going to be said next then what's going to be done next you can't be anticipated because you are not bound in a system and that system satan knows it better than you hallelujah but you're out of the system even in natural things if i might illustrate do you know you got the internet now and all this thing going out do you know that if you don't put your credit cards you don't put this put that on the internet and you come off of it completely do you know they're literally they're saying it but you literally shut out you won't have access to the rest of the internet somebody that has connections will have to do it but you can't you can't even get your own money out the bank if you're not connected to the internet so i'm just saying satan is setting that natural one up that's going on now on the earth at the same time spiritually he's doing the same thing but god is known by simplicity hallelujah you see uh when brother brother or the holy spirit used brother branham because we know that brother branham broke the seals the lamb broke the seals so the lamb had to be there with him to break those seals and we explain to you about the covenant angel coming and moving through him and the spirit speaking through the prophet making known the word of god to the people amen hallelujah and so when the seals were given all of them were great and manifest but when you come to the seventh you couldn't see nothing it don't seem to be nothing what did he really say he just said the seventh seal and you know because the seventh seal wasn't writing on a page the seventh seal was is a person the seventh seal was christ revealing himself not therefore uh before he used to be preaching uh preaching there and saying second coming of chronic say amen hallelujah he would preach about who do you use all this type of thing but then from the day he preached the seventh seal who do you see this is who do you say this is who do you say the son of man am then he'd be preaching a greater than solomon is here praise god hallelujah what was he doing letting you know that the jesus christ who was in word form is now back here now in spirit form hallelujah and he is now manifesting himself to his people amen god working through his own people making himself known so a lot of people came out a lot of people that would follow brother branham's ministry began to say i don't see i don't see nothing outstanding about that i don't see nothing miraculous about that hallelujah i didn't see nothing at all exciting and thrilling but while they were saying that there were other people there that were sitting trilled to the bone with hot troubling excitement waiting for the rest of the word of god to come forth they couldn't stand it because god was revealing himself and making himself known by the opening of the world praise god hallelujah amen oh praise god listen god is known by simplicity of the revelation of jesus christ in the most illiterate person god is known by simplicity of jesus of the revelation of jesus christ in the most literate person you see it's when that revelation get in the most illiterate person they don't have to have wisdom of their own they don't have to know anything they don't have to this or that because it's him doing it through that illiterate person it's him revealing himself to the person regardless of the condition hallelujah amen you see we're moving away from that uh babylonian teaching that they've been given the people until it's entrenched in everyday religion telling the people that oh you you've got to work work for the lord you've got to sacrifice you you've got to do this no he said i died that you might live so oh the poverty of of our lord don't set your eyes on on riches give the church your riches you see that see they got your eyes off the word and they tell you you suffer for the lord he but he said i already suffered you don't have to suffer he said oh you know our poverty proves that we are really living for the lord he said i became already poor that you might be rich i know a lot of christians don't believe in getting rich but he just said it i became poor that you might be rich hallelujah oh that means spiritual things no it doesn't mean spiritual things alone that's part of it because when peter doesn't say master what shall we have for following you he didn't say come on be more spiritual than that peter the you i i'm fixing to give you the key of the kingdom and you're asking me about carnal things and he turned no jesus turned and said for following me you shall have houses you hear that not one house you shall have houses and you shall have lands and you want them to understand that he was not talking spiritually only he said in this world now and also in the world to come [Applause] i got kind of sidetracked there praise god years ago the holy spirit broke me into brother branham couldn't preach on those things but he left them in the word and so i preached a series on that and i've never really preached it again but the fact is god wants you to prosper is that right god wants you to be healthy god wants you to be happy god wants you to have joy walking with him following him serving him with joy amen for my yoke is what easy and my burden is light but they were telling you no it's not easy sorrow for the lord you know on easter you're supposed to take wires and uh barbed wire and flagellate your body to show how sorry you are for the sins what he said i've done it all already you don't need to do it again is that right you are justified the judge can't put you in jail because i am taking i took the whole sentence that you supposed to serve i serve the sentence so you can't be sentenced again you're free you've been set free by the grace of almighty god hallelujah amen what are you fighting up yourself threatening and fussing and everything else to live the life of christ let him manifest himself and his life through you amen oh praise god hallelujah amen so you see it is by the simplicity of the revelation of jesus christ even in the most illiterate person praise god so even if you are most highly intelligent person it still is not you that's why paul realized that and he said not that he threw away his wisdom he can't get rid of that because he already know what he know what he knows but but he said i count it down and ash amen hallelujah to gain the wisdom of jesus christ hallelujah praise god amen so that's the importance he said therefore you see it is not your theology it is a revelation of jesus christ for he said upon this rock i'll build my church no other rock is accepted here upon this rock amen nothing else no school no nothing but egg but on exactly the revelation of jesus christ himself in a new birth because it's him in you is in your birth you are born in him and he is born in you again not in mary back there but in you again the word of god made flesh again in the true believer not in born virgin-born flesh but in redeemed flesh purified and justified by the blood of jesus christ hallelujah o praise god amen oh praise god he is not this is not built on any roman rock it's not built on any protestant rock no other school no nothing it's not built on that it's him when he is born in there and injects his own life amen and your life then is gone and the life of christ is projecting itself through you with the preeminence to the people in other words his life in you now begins to take preeminence over all your desires all your actions what you used to do before all of a sudden you start changing my god's power to transform hallelujah it's not you transforming yourself but god's power him in you begins to transform you hallelujah amen brother brenham said one time he said you know when i was a boy i wanted to be a soldier amen but god called me praise god you understand that when we were child we think as a child we want to do this we want to do it but when the holy spirit takes over and begins to take the preeminence the leadership the control over your life he begins to take away a certain taste he took away certain friends from you he take away certain things that you used to love from you it's not you i gotta do away with this if i want to be a real christian i gotta get rid of that it's not you doing this doing that get rid of this or that it's him and you beginning to move across your heart across your leg change your taste amen oh praise god oh yes he is born in there and injects his own life through you with the preeminences to the rest of the people seeing that change and there begin to see that very life hallelujah doing the same thing through you and outside of that the rest of it is not even called at all in other words they're not even elected the rest that don't get that come in them not even elected it's not even called he said at all praise the name of the lord how wonderful to know that that he's identifying the individual by projecting himself hallelujah amen glory be to god amen how when the life of christ comes forth it it's such a simple form that uh it's not funny because this is christianity where i'm free i'm not boned i i'm not bummed by mans and humans ideas but yet my life is being conducted by the word having preeminence over me but yet i'm not feeling like i'm tied up i'm bound up i can't do this i can't do that i can't go here i can't do go there i can't do the other whatever i'm free but the holy spirit keeps you within the boundaries of the world not by throwing a lasso or chaining you to a post like a johnny crow no but you are free any race thoroughbred knows that it can run out like all the other horses it can run out and jump on the fields run up the mountain run up the hill but they're not going to win no prices they don't stay on the racetrack is that right you got to stay on the racetrack and we got to stay between the white lines of the world we've got to walk with the word hallelujah and the word walks with us in us and leads us into a perfect light for the glory of god hallelujah amen thank god forevermore oh glory be to god now today he wants to get somebody that can begin to see that what i'm telling you here and teaching here back then brother branham was saying oh he's here trying to get somebody to see that do you see that do you see that do you recognize what i'm talking about here oh praise god then the prophet's prophecy is now being fulfilled at this hour with you you people i don't mean in this church alone it's been fulfilled around the world with anybody else and any preacher any church that would receive the fullness of the revelation or the word of god but i'm speaking here locally now that's why i said it that way amen that you see that that's him working out his own will amen you see that they can lift the world jesus uh seeing it that it could be perfectly born for this day hallelujah amen praise god born again for this day and i'm so glad that we can have that new birth for this day not mary carrying the word but the bride the elected members of the body of the bride carrying the world bearing the reproach for carrying the world not being ashamed of him for carrying the word because they're carrying the word hallelujah and we know the word that we received is not of man it's not of william branham it's not of any man it is of god but god had to use a man to manifest his word and to make it plain praise god hallelujah so the word we have received is from god himself for the spoken word is the original seed and that's what we have received from the living god that pregnants the soul and brings forth the life of christ made manifest and elected for the hour and for the day thank god amen yes sir oh my he back then you see he was god's revelation god revealed on the earth oh hallelujah amen praise god and is the bride today god's revelation for this day she is the one it's god revealed again in flesh it's the son of man being revealed through you and me and we are moved by the holy spirit god is moving his men and women on his chest board and the devil don't know what autumn move he's going to make until he plays the last trump and the whole thing goes up and he pulls in the whole pot glory to god hallelujah i just put it that way but my god that's what's going on and we are caught up in the middle of all this we are caught up in the middle of all this and we thank god for his grace amen hallelujah now think of it amen he sanctifies with his spirit and uh true and by the blood a church that he might make every promise in this last day be revealed hallelujah the promises that are left in the world it's becoming unto us to fulfill all righteousness is supposed to be fulfilled through the bride jesus fulfilled all the prophecies 400 and whatever at that time grew his life there and now it's a bride's time for she is part of him and she's to fulfill the rest of the world by her works but by his works the continuing ministry of jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah through the bride of jesus christ amen oh praise god remember for the church is the blood of christ by the spirit because the life is always in the blood you get that oh the life is always in the blood and he sends the germ life into the elected on that life being elected he is saying it now here the church is the blood of christ the carrier for the life is the blood you never no doctor sees that life but he sees the red chemistry of the blood but the life is in the blood even though he's not seeing it and that's what that what he is saying to you here now that the real church is the blood of christ the carrier of his life amen praise god forevermore hallelujah and that's the baptism of the holy spirit into his body see for he recognized only his flesh his own body in other words he he recognizes only those elected beings or bodies that he already prepare for a body has now prepared me before the foundations so he knows where he is coming to in this particular age in every other age he knew where he had to come to and a body that's prepared to him he knows exactly he's coming to that body and he recognizes only that those ones he recognizes the other ones may look the same like the woman's pattern same clot same everything but he recognizes this part and not that part amen because that is of his own choosing see the holy spirit the living god hallelujah that's what we're a part of amen we're a part of his spirit we are part of the pillar of fire we're part of this war we're a part of the husband for we are not made of another material separate from him we are made out of the same material if he is eternal you are eternal amen your flesh will die but the man inside that man is eternal and he lives on and on and on and last forever praise peter god hallelujah amen that's why god will come and claim you and baptize you with the holy spirit not because you get up like ahab's prophets and jump up and beat the drums and holler and scream and you're going to influence god you think god is somebody yet can be influenced to change his opinion god is mo god sits still and he moves but he is not moved by men and the actions and and their persuasions and things that they will do amen the great rock of our redemption jesus christ hallelujah amen yes sir o praise god amen so the gene of god is laying there i know i can end the service because the spirit of god has pushed out enough to you here but praise the lord i'm not done you don't mind hallelujah amen the gene of god may be laying within the heart and life but it will lay there dormant until it is recognized by the holy spirit claimed by the holy spirit called by the holy spirit amen oh praise god so his part is that he's playing right now but this holy spirit only recognizes those of his own body what i'm talking about is what brother branham spoke and he speaks it so simple and leaves it like that is about the eagle in this last day once more flying over the barnyard but the barnyard of this earth of this world with all this terrible stenches and sticks and all kinds of worms and everything else he is the great jehovah evil flying over the barnyard amen i'm looking and looking for his sons and his daughters hallelujah and then he lets the prophet let out to scream hallelujah amen and they don't know what it is but the deep calls to the deep and the deep can't help it it jump on a fence post it jumps on a fence post it knows it's got to do something so it jumps on the fence post but oh my and it's still on the fence post that's good you jump in the messages and do what you call yourself believer and everything else but she screamed again and said son come up hither amen come into a high accord come into a higher level of realm of the dimensions of the spirit of christ amen call you from that post amen where you've been sitting there for 40 years and 30 years the holy ghost is crawling you into the perfect light by the grace of god hallelujah amen praise god hallelujah oh isn't that wonderful brother sister that we are like that looking around for his prepared bodies amen you know we've preached on that prepared ground the farmer don't just go and plant seed or pick fruit from ground heat and prepare the crumb has to be prepared prepared ground praise god he saws the seed on what prepared ground lord of god and the seed of god was sown within your hearts that was prepared before the foundation of the world and so when jesus spoke and said a body has now prepared me hallelujah now the spirit is moving over the world searching for those prepared bodies prepared people prepare ground that will receive this word amen and when the word strikes the soul that comes to life begins to come out of your spiritual amnesia before that used to think i am this i am that i'm going to be a fireman i'm going to be a soldier i'm going to be that i'm going to be the other but when the spirit strikes the soul the soul wakes up it begins to rise up praise god up to the sunlight up to the rain up to the word of god back to life walking in the power of the holy spirit amen all glory be to god forevermore i trust that wherever this goes wherever people are hearing what i'm saying here today won't take it as a partial thing or uh or saying something to glorify man or glorify a church or glorify anything but this is the glorified word glorify jesus christ even if one out there can recognize and say that's right i believe it i see it hallelujah amen praise god amen looking for his prepared bodies amen and recognizes that body baptizes anointed and that's what and he brings that body let them be aware that they are part of the bride body his body amen you're just a part of it whether a toe a finger a hand or whatever but he brings you into your position connects you to the bride body worldwide wherever it is not in any church i'm not saying the church message groups is the bride or is the body but the invisible body of christ that will know and recognize each other not based on any church doctrine but based on the revelation of the world that's why you meet a brother or sister said within five minutes you'll know it's not that you're going to scrutinize in search but you don't have to do that prophet said be simple be humble be reverent and god will bless you but the holy spirit will make you aware right praise the lord you talk to somebody all of a sudden something catches your attention makes you aware praise the lord somebody may think you're guessing but you're not guessing in that moment because you've seen something something's been shown to you and you recognize what is really happening amen listen see he recognizes his own body his own flesh his word it's a revelation and she the bride knows it hallelujah she knows it rebecca recognize her bridegroom that the bride recognizes the word she knows it hallelujah nobody didn't have to explain to her nothing she just the moment she sees him she knows him amen she'll recognize it right away because by the holy spirit of the living god amen oh my you see now he saw that if but eve knowed it but she still fell and but this one knows it and she will not fall thank god hallelujah she's ordained not to fall she would fall she's predestinated by god blessed is the man whom god will not impute sin you're blessed to have a germ of jesus see you're blessed to be an attribute of god he can't impute sin unto you hallelujah praise god because he set you free already he redeemed you already and if you're redeemed you've been washed by the blood of christ so somebody said but i see this i see that i know this about you i know that you can know whatever you like what you know doesn't mean nothing it's what the blood has done [Applause] [Music] [Applause] praise be to god hallelujah amen so the bride of this day is predestinated just as mary was hallelujah because elijah said you know isaiah said virgin shall conceive and bear a son the word and bear the word in flesh amen praise god it's the same thing happening again today in this hour but in such a simple way it's not gabriel coming down from heaven and saying as they portrayed that way i don't believe it that way but they portrayed gabriel saying oh i am gabriel sent from the presence of almighty god mary you are really blessed you will bear us up no i believe she met an ordinary man but his presence alone she knew it was the angel of god that brother branham said sometimes he would come and be sitting in a congregation dressed in a regular clothes like people but he's sitting right amongst the people he said but i can't tell you anything i can't say nothing he's sitting right in the church but i can't say nothing to you because he's looking at me i'm looking at him and i'm preaching what a condition to be in praise the lord it's like sitting you know what it was like when you sat there and the school master is sitting right there watching at you and then you have to go on the board and do something man right the angel of god sit right there in the church and he's preaching the word praise god so it's that same kind of thing but you see mary was predestinated of god i i want to say this way so you can get it clear she was predestined of god as the one that will produce the life of christ for that age but then the life had to be produced and come in a flesh form in the form of a baby boy who later became jesus christ when the word matured it revealed itself that it was jesus christ god in christ emmanuel now in this day god sent not gabriel but the seventh angel is that right explain to you who the seventh day angel really was amen and the word came to us and now in this this manger of our souls of our hearts this manger of this sinful body uh you know with all kind of cattle urine and straw and everything else the word came to be born in you and i that it would create a paradox about how could god be in you what would you talking about somebody like you i know you i know him i know her that's got nothing to do with it it's happened and it's going on right now it's just the fact you're saying that means you ain't see it you recognize what is happening amen so god brought us some places in this age that the eagle might find us that he might have another virgin bride amen that will produce the life of jesus christ not create the life but produce the life because jesus christ was not from mary jesus christ the word the seed of god the original seed only pass through mary so that he could make himself manifest hallelujah and that is what is happening right now the word passing through processing itself until it comes to a full manifestation and revelation in the bride of jesus christ amen at that day then you'll know that i'm in the father and the father in me and i in you praise god brother branham said that is this day this day that we are living in god is doing that praise the lord jesus christ oh my there's so many things you because if i go in those angles you know these quotes let's say he says the true anointed of god he comes to them that's deity speaking do you know he said little messiah x why they are children of the most high god [Music] god produce goat horse produce horse god is going to produce what there's got to be little gods that's why he said don't you know jesus himself said that the prophets were already called god what what is it strange that you will think that i tell you that i am the son of god i am the body that jehovah is now dwelling in but we're not saying that we are many many little parts of him praise god that he could live in move in and have his being to fulfill the scripture that's on the wall jesus christ is the same yesterday today praise god living not in jesus back there because jesus no let me not go there but you see living in jesus back there but living in you and i here of course you feel yourself unworthy and if you feel yourself worthy then forget it but but uh you feel unworthy because brother brown said you're still gonna be making mistakes he says this sticky nature here gonna be with you till you go out to here why because it's satan that's got the prerogative to work and influence and maneuver and manipulate this outside man that he got some control over it as a as a so-called elder brother he wants to play across this but he can't touch the gene that was in other side [Applause] hallelujah and that gene is only anointed to believe it's only anointed to do certain things all these things you see up here it'll do all those things all you have to be certain of god that the gene of god in that day he said what day this day at that day when this revelation is being made known you will know i am in the father the father in me i and you when the revelation now begins to be mad manifest hallelujah at that you will know that i and the father are one hallelujah that you and the lord you and the pillar of fire you and him are one praise god that day this day you begin to know that praise the lord glory to god hallelujah amen oh my i'm gonna have to start winding this up and i still have to go go go praise god hallelujah but i want you to know no no [Music] amen glory to god hallelujah amen now i'm quoting out of christ as a mischief god revealed because these books these sermons we have heard at least me hundreds of times and read them and or mark and everything else and and now the holy spirit is making you see things that were always there but it wasn't the time for you to see that he's making themselves known listen now that day when the revelation is making itself manifest i'm talking about the manifested life of jesus christ amen hallelujah at that day you shall know amen i'm just going to pause in the sentence there so you get the emphasis that this is the day when you shall know praise god are you starting to know are you starting to know are you starting to come up to your amnesia are you starting to recognize understand and see what god's plan was which he could not make known to the princes of this world but he made it known to his with his love secrets to his beloved bride that she will recognize and know who she is and who he is where you come from and where you're going to amen praise the name of the lord amen i am in the father the father in me then when the revelation comes forth then it's i then it's i in you when the revelation begins to come forth it's not you no more it's not not not you no more having to put on anything act anything struggle with anything fighting to be a christian or whatever it's not you anymore brother branham says here amen i think that's page 65 crisis he says but you see it's then it's i in you and you and me praise the name of the lord glory to god hallelujah amen now this is a thought where we will turn a little corner here because i've been preaching a lot to this and showing you that we were always in him before the foundations is that right how many hear me preach that many times different angles emphasize it what i'm doing and what i'm saying is that he's turned our attention yes you you were in him but i want you to see now this is the time and the hour and the season when the emphasis is on me being in you i in you praise the name of the living god hallelujah because we know that that we were in him before the foundations of the world amen before there was ever a time something called time or there ever was a world we were already in him praise the lord amen but we found out praise god that we he is now in us and talking to us giving us clear revelation and giving us uh not a denominational interpretation but a clear revelation and interpretation of himself for it is god who is his own interpreter interpreting his own word praise god doing that it's god doing that and we give him glory praise and honor may the lord bless you i trust that even if you received only uh you know a little toast with butter this morning that the holy spirit will satisfy you and like elijah on those bread that dry bread brought to him by by the birds i trust and he went 40 days in the strength of that bread i trust god will give you the same kindness as the musicians are coming we'll give you that same kind of strength and grace hallelujah praise god when all them brooks dry up and they're drying up fast until they're saying all kinds of ridiculous stuff when they're saying all these ridiculous stuff you can more see clearly they don't have a clue they may hear with the ears somebody's saying what's going on but they don't have any part in it and they're saying all kinds of stuff prophet said you start from one point and if when you started you were off even just a teeny weeny bit later on when that thing mature and you go out out you find that you're hundreds of miles away from your original destination of where you wanted to go is that right a lot of ministers a lot of believers that just one little thing little here and they start to as he said they start to go off into the weeds hey man you know how it is if a person come off the road then the vehicle go down in the weeds we don't want to find ourselves in the weeds we want to find ourselves in the world praise god may god bless you keep pressing keep pressing god bless you bless you brother i am free covered [Music] is [Music] i am free i am [Music] who i truly

when you start seeing yourself your picture is like you get excited you know that's what we was today we look and we see ourselves in the album [Applause] hallelujah oh god i'm justified i'm justified
