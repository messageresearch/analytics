2017 just around the corner what a been striking me what a strange number 17 anybody feel that what a weird number man 17 I just I was looking at that thinking what is what is 17 what does it mean 2017 what does 17 mean so I decided to look it up but before I did I thought you know what if I think about the message something that always stuck with me ever since I first heard it is that when brother Brandon was baptized in the 17th person I said why do would have to be the 17 person and why do we have to know it's a 17 person right it would always stuck with me and I I I said I don't know why the 17th person and uh then I thought 2017 so I looked at up I was thinking pillar fire came down over the 17th person declared the message right as as your uh what you say joh as John the Baptist went for to the first to coming to the Lord you're going to go forth you in your message you're going to introduce the second coming to the Lord right so when I looked it up you know what 17 means in the Bible it means overcoming amen the enemy also complete victory praise the Lord amen no wonder he had to come down because without him right right we're no match for our enemy but with him our enemy and we believe it is no match with this people praise God hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord that blessed me so much when I seen that I sing there the Unseen hand see that's the trouble

mother but I say the Lord did for him how many you agree with me amen praise God lord you want to do something for me how about my unsaved son do it for me Lord praise God amen glory to God my brother's going to give us that this testimony amen I just want to give a small testimony what my my Lord told my mom a couple years back um she was um going to get her her pension that for for security that from the governments and um she started back couple years back and she was applying for it and um I end up my brother called me and told me about it that she want to get all our phone Bo there's four of us my family right by myself my brother my two sisters and uh they were fighting against her that saying she never worked at all in her life I remember as a kid growing up with her and seeing her go to her job that they were denying that she work in C she came from Scotland into here work and they were fighting her on that so when my brother told me that I knew that we came to a prayer meeting I brought a prayer request for that ask the Lord to intervene in her life for that and then not soon after that like within a couple of months or so of that I get a phone call back from him saying everything was going through for it was cleared up and everything and everything she had applied for before that when she asked for it so they had to backtrack and give her all the money from that but they wouldn't give her and then all the rest for that afterwards so in the end everything worked out for her and she got back more than she would ever could imagine back CU had to give her back that stuff but I just want to thank the Lord for what he did you know sometimes we feel to give him glory but now I'm giving him glory because what he did and I thank him so much for that I give him [Applause] prise thank you Lord done for a faithful mom faithful dad sister de sister Jennifer got a song for us uh if they can come and uh sing for us and if you got a little short testimony we might be able to squeeze in uh here tonight but uh you can let somebody know and then we can judge it as to whether we have the time or not but if you do have ask you [Music] the father has a plan though it's hard to see it now you're feeling you feel your want walking all alone but he is there no doubt when the storm around you rages and you're toss to and from when you're faced with life's decisions not sure which way to go stand still and let God standing still it's hard to do when you feel you have reached the end he'll make a way for you stand still let God move [Music] the enemy surround you and the walls are closing in When the tide is swiftly Rising you wonder where he's been friend there's never been a moment that his arms wer reaching out you can rest assure and be secure God is moving right now stand still and God standing [Music] still is hard to do when you feel you have reached the end he'll make a way for you stand still let God move when you feel you have reached the end he'll make a way for you stand still and let God move the answer will come but lonely in his time so stand still let God move stand still and let God move amen [Applause] amen praise God well the Lord bless yall I know we're coming to the end of another year we've got a couple hours left and you know um on Wednesday night I was just inspired by the Lord to just Minister you know just a simple thought from Luke Chapter 13 Jesus speaking he says a certain man had a fig tree planted in his Vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none then said he unto the dresser of the vineyard behold these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find that cut it down he says why cth it the ground and he answering said unto him Lord let it alone this year also and you know we can sometimes look back on our lives and you know the Lord wants to come and pick some fruit off of our lives and he doesn't find any because for some reason it just hasn't been bearing fruit but then listen to The Gardener he says Lord let it alone this year also I believe there's Mercy God's given us Mercy for another year amen praise God he says and it bear fruit he says Lord let it alone this year also till I shall dig around about it and it bear fruit well and if not then after that thou shalt cut it down well praise God I thank God for his mercy and his grace that he would send the Holy Ghost to give us Mercy one more year and so so we've got to realize that that Mercy is ours to accept and we've got to let go and leave that year behind this is time now to move on and listen to what Jesus says here he tells us in in John 15:5 those who remain in me and I in them will bear much fruit so it's a simple lesson it's very simple we just need need to remain in the word of God we need to do different than what we did in 2016 if it didn't bring about fruit amen praise our God forever more listen to brother Bram here he says in Revelation the message Revelation 4 he says our heavenly father as this New Year Eve just about two hours now and it'll be over there will will be a new year what we have done this year we have did many things that I've done that I'm ashamed of myself I Repent of those Lord and there's a lot of things that I've done that many of my brethren didn't understand many of my brothers out in the fields don't understand in why I did them but father I did them because I was led to do them I pray father that you will never let me be ashamed of that leading but Lead Me Lord to continue to do as I am led to do help me God because I seek sincerely to know your will that I might do it to bring as you showed me many years ago when I left this church the bread of life to the people of the world I believe 27 17 is going to be a very significant year Luke 17 yes sir this is the time where the son of man is going to come and he's going to do things in our lives that we never ever expected this is a jubilee year for Israel in 1967 they faced the greatest battle but they overcame that's right and here we are 50 years later and I believe we're going to overcome in 2017 so I I'm going to encourage you you to leave 2016 like brother Philip prayed completely behind I don't want to bring nothing but that experience with God and that walk with God and let 2017 be a tremendous year for you that is my desire for each and every one of you God bless

what was the brother's name and I was like Al good thing I got is now I can call him but it's good to see them and God wish we bless them [Applause] it's our custom to have a testimony a full testimony if if you would of someone in the congregation that they could come and and give God thanks and praise for doing great things and this fell here he's only been with us uh less than 5 years maybe four years maybe somewhere in there I could be wrong but uh he was born in uh in the raised in the message and I'm going to let him fill in details but what a what a life what a what a testimony and I can say it because uh we can see that God's hand is on his life and is taking him and bringing him forth we're about to be blessed not just by testimony but by a life of a Believer who uh is coming forth and will be a great benefit in his congregation amen trust me I believe that and not only me but I've some others believe it too because we've seen what God has done so without further Ado I'm going to ask brother Daniel Bessie to come and give his testimony for the glory of God all right there is power in the name of Jesus oh there is power in the name of Jesus there's so much power yes there [Music] is every CH break every CH break every CH break every CH break every ch amen God bless you I a littleit nervous brother Mike uh called me about a couple weeks ago and asked me to do this and of course my my a words where I can't really say no we you're ready to give uh to give U to get give a witness a hope that is in us if we're supposed ready to do it and we're called to do it we do it so but I'm very nervous I'm not i' I've done a lot of public think in my life but I've never stood in front of a church and uh it's different I think standing in front of uh standing in front of God's people is not like standing in front of the classroom I've um a testimony is not it's not just a bunch of events it's not just it's not just a person's life story testimony is if it's a testimony the true testimony it's the word being fulfilled right that's um as brother Mike was just saying a little that's something that you only see you can only truly see if you're the one living the testimony how do you give that testimony is is how do you make it felt for others or let others see it is a little more difficult um I was raised in the message I'm a third generation message believer if that makes sense phrase goes around but it's uh brother Mike said to me so when you when you get up there there's a lot of people in the congregation who have also been raised in the M each and not everybody is as uh has come to um the same experience whatever else he said you can you know sort of speak about your experiences in that light being raised in the message so I I'm trying to speak from that perspective um so there's a lot of things about my testimony that I could I could speak about as some notes here but it's too hard to read them so I'll just go from um a lot of things I can speak about I mean testimony is very there's there's it's very multi faets there's a lot of things you can say uh but I'm trying to stick with that point of view so as as uh I had the best of intentions I think as a child I was raised I pretty much idolized my pastor um I very spread for ministers I just remember I remember wanting to be one wanting to be a preacher and um just my my my pastor was very he's very Dynamic when I was younger he very Dynamic I remember one time sitting in the front pews and I was sitting one side and the the other little guy was sitting in the other side and the pastor would run down he jump up and he jump on the back of the Pew and the PE almost tipped over and it was all so exciting right but he would get in spirit he would be so alive and I thought man you know what something moved me to want that kind of life but that's not the way my life went my my life became very ugly um became very broken I U I became somebody that I was very ashamed of and I don't know how I got there I started out going one way and I ended up somewhere very very different uh I was baptized around age8 um and and that's probably where my early sort of spiritual life almost ended which just had to say but that's that's kind of where where it wasn't long after that that I kind want to real but I was baptized I didn't uh I didn't really know why I was getting baptized I remember my a pastor called U called my dad and my dad turned to me said well there's a baptism service you want get baptized and to me it was sort of a right of passage it was something you're were supposed to do once you did your had your baptism uh you were you were a Christian so you could do all things you take communion you could be involved in the church in whatever way and so I so I did it I didn't know anything about confession I didn't know I had any sin so I didn't know that I had anything in confess I mean we're born in sin but I didn't understand that there was no um you don't understand that as a child you look at what your parents teach you you look at what they live and being ra raised in a mess Church in one sense you're raised with the power of God around you but in another sense it's no different to being raised in any other religion it looks like ritual it looks like you just do what you you're expected to do so it becomes meaningless um and it wasn't it wasn't very long after that that I started to fail I remember my um I'll try try to give some sort of understanding of of why I think I I I fell away the way I fell away if those are the right words um my dad had had I I I believe he loved me loved loved the song he had had the best of intentions but he also had his own struggles uh outside he seemed like a very good man a very good Christian inside the home he was he was angry bitter um he wasn't very encouraging at least by the time I came on I'm age my brother Ron is first it was a little different when he grew up but when about time I got along you know after eight kids I guess life gets pretty stressful but uh it gave me a lot of self-doubt there was never any real encouragement I felt not I knew my Dad loved me and and tried to show it at times but there there was a lot I end up a lot of self-doubt a lot of self-loading I felt like I could never I was never good enough for him there was nothing I could do to be good enough um and I struggled with that need in the sense to for acceptance and why am I saying that I'm saying this because when you're when you're a a parent in the world you're just a parent par when you're a Christian raising Christian children you're not just a parent anymore what your children see in you is what later they will think about the heavenly father and that that like I know that that lays a big weight on us any of us who are parents but that's the truth when you're child grows up and there they seeking God and seeking to be close to him the struggles they will have are the struggles that they had with you if you show them anger if you showed them nonacceptance if you show them they could never be good enough that's you're going to feel coming to God it's it's we have a loving God we also have a just God he does want us there is we need just as we are corrected by him we need to correct our children but just as he encourages us we need to encourage our children we can't just constantly be rate them and tell them what's wrong we have to tell them what they're doing right we have to have a balance and that's what I struggle with when I try to come to God in in my uh in my later teenss I couldn't see the grace of God I couldn't see forgiveness I couldn't see love I couldn't understand that what I saw was what I heard when I heard God I heard my father's voice um but soon after of course everybody hits their U teenage years and teenage years are are especially in this sort of society we've set up teenage years are a rough time and when I when I got to my teenage years I started to really sort of uh move in a in a completely different direction that my life have been going um as I sought for acceptance of course when you don't find it at home you find it outside the home there's a there's a statistic um about uh Teenage promiscuity in my but in young girls often girls that are more promiscuous statistically
