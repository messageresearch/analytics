[1:09] no when it's our not fool and I don't
[1:14] know what it was my brothers my sisters
[1:16] when I came in what drew me it's very
[1:19] important my brothers and sisters that's
[1:21] why the Bible says how to love some of
[1:24] the scriptures hear my message but have
[1:27] love one for another what true me when I
[1:29] stood at a level cognitive people I have
[1:32] all kinds of indifference as I come from
[1:33] a big Catholic Church big thing you know
[1:39] what religion was amen when I came
[1:43] amongst simple people in that level
[1:45] upper room
[1:46] I remember walking into brother Simon
[1:48] and then in the kitchen there trying to
[1:50] keep warm with the snow and do it is
[1:52] known so that up looking around you know
[1:55] my natural eyes when my spirit my heart
[1:57] was going what's these people what is
[2:01] this is the other dimension I was
[2:05] speaking up me I was calling me and I
[2:11] don't think I said
[2:15] [Music]
[2:23] over there you see the mental state
[3:07] heavyweights at that time wouldn't my
[3:09] condition some of you know that I think
[3:11] I was a staple my blog they go right to
[3:13] peddle she you know all right
[3:25] [Music]
[3:35] that's all I know what I wanna through
[3:40] those doors my wife lived attorney with
[3:42] me for three and a half years I'm going
[3:45] to get into some of my Technica's where
[3:47] the demon possesses you takes control of
[3:50] your life she lived with me through
[3:53] three and a half years in that condition
[3:55] nobody could help no pills not the good
[3:59] healthy and I walked through that door
[4:01] she didn't got the church the first
[4:03] night I feel about the daughters of st.
[4:05] Regis as she said there's other counsel
[4:08] she's just staring at me drink there she
[4:10] can be a witness she's staring at me
[4:14] what happened that was a stable
[4:21] unlikable what do you need what happened
[4:23] - she goes there's a leg around you and
[4:26] she said that she testified from that
[4:29] day she never seen that spirit of know
[4:33] that condition that was upon me what I
[4:37] didn't even understand what was nice for
[4:40] me but I gave into the presence of God
[4:45] [Music]
[4:47] this is what I be
[5:04] [Music]
[5:13] strictly business presence at the
[5:19] preaching of the word of God and all
[5:21] these things that we do in our lives
[5:23] whether the church doesn't bring us into
[5:24] the presence of God we're missing
[5:26] something that we read sets up there yes
[5:31] let me try to write this down
[5:34] Oh My thank you Lord we look at piling
[5:41] up lump on the road to Damascus and x26
[5:46] emanuelle learning what changed our when
[5:51] God spoke as if lying persecuted now
[5:55] even a light came down from heaven to
[6:01] every true child of God
[6:12] because that's what reveals himself to
[6:14] you is hit and Shop both like to reveal
[6:17] himself to you but him and said bark
[6:23] growl earned it man I wonder if there's
[6:26] well the message today that colors
[6:30] everything the far you are if the
[6:33] presence of God would ever come down
[6:35] some people Jesus oh my god a the word
[7:06] God has a powers were convicted of sin
[7:10] ox to 37 it brings a deep conviction
[7:17] when Peter preached that great sermon
[7:20] that one could not carry by the Spirit
[7:24] amen and it pricked the people's hearts
[7:29] that's what it does it prints your heart
[7:32] it shows you where you are shows you
[7:35] where we should be it moves you forward
[7:39] God hallelujah his power his word
[7:46] ready regenerates and James 1:18 Amen
[7:51] hallelujah this process is simple the
[7:55] human heart is the soil and he is his
[7:58] somewhere the Word of God is the seed
[8:00] and drops into the soil
[8:02] amen
[8:18] amen
[8:19] and it marks from the heart I do like it
[8:24] parts of the nature gods featuring us
[8:29] Alleluia
[8:30] new tonight Springs how does that give
[8:32] the soul to produce fake amen nah this
[8:40] doesn't come by crate or your effort to
[8:42] read their studies but faith comes by
[8:45] hearing and hearing by the Word of God
[8:47] doggie is about you Romans 10:17 so then
[8:52] faith comes by hearing the word amen and
[8:56] then I was wearing a couple of quotes
[8:59] here in the seventh Church ages we did
[9:02] not become seed by the rebirth we were
[9:04] seen and therefore we were reborn we're
[9:08] not only the elect can be reborn because
[9:10] we were seen this is the reason we could
[9:13] be quickened I'm not seeing there is
[9:17] nothing to quicken oh this beautifully
[9:20] in mind now take the next step redeems
[9:23] means divide them what are the goddamn
[9:26] it restores to the original order that's
[9:30] who we belong to say yeah we come from
[9:33] God we got
[9:37] the spoken word she cried
[9:40] my sheep hear my voice and they follow
[9:45] me
[9:47] they told me I can't I can't stand up
[9:54] for anybody else but myself but that's
[9:58] the word says my sheep hear my voice
[10:01] why is his first politics or both of
[10:03] disabled positive my sheep hear my
[10:07] thoughts and a stranger they will not a
[10:11] [Music]
[10:13] men you see you're always the Sheep you
[10:19] never pick RDoc turn into she that's
[10:22] impossible for any kind of light
[10:25] produces the same time and there is no
[10:27] change in species you know that doesn't
[10:31] thing with the gospel today my brothers
[10:33] and sisters this revelation was way high
[10:35] above everything you know the Gospels we
[10:37] have reached out there that we were some
[10:39] kind of paper or some kind of dog we
[10:42] were some kind of this and the dog has
[10:44] come no we were always the revolution of
[10:50] the hour is that I was with the father
[10:52] and then I came down in a body of sin
[10:57] might come slightly off me
[11:00] and I'm kidding and my amnesia I just to
[11:03] go my watch
[11:06] [Music]
[11:23] [Music]
[11:30] oh by the revelation the power
[11:40] revelation they have worked a revelation
[11:42] to us true believer to a spirit believer
[11:46] can never be over emphasized it means
[11:48] more to you than perhaps you realized
[11:50] I'm not talking about the book of
[11:52] Revelation but a part of the whole
[11:54] revelation that I'm certain she would
[11:56] give left it's tremendous to the church
[11:58] forever Matthew 16 where Jesus said to
[12:01] his disciples this questions who do you
[12:03] say that I am Wow this day this age who
[12:09] do you say that people are preaching the
[12:16] message of preaching another thing the
[12:19] bible scriptures tonight but she chooses
[12:23] standard in this day and age when a
[12:27] where god's coming forth talking word
[12:30] inspired were in an anointed word coming
[12:34] down by the Spirit of God who you say
[12:39] why is there so many interpretations on
[12:42] this way
[12:43] interpretations the message start
[12:46] developing what do you say to later this
[12:52] message is so simple the guidelines are
[12:55] so simple the instructions are so simple
[12:57] everything is so simple to follow God
[13:00] gave us a message amen to follow by
[13:04] faith we can follow so simple when it
[13:06] opens up to the bride of Jesus Christ
[13:08] and people are making it so complicated
[13:10] they always have been so complicated all
[13:13] about through the agency lesson when
[13:20] Peter got the revelation of flesh and
[13:22] blood has not revealed it my father
[13:23] which is in heaven
[13:24] on this rock of Revelation we know the
[13:27] scripture I will build my church and the
[13:32] gates of Hell shall not prevail against
[13:35] any power of the flesh and he power
[13:39] about this world the seeking to try to
[13:41] use against us and Eddie the Scriptures
[13:56] tells me that there is no power and the
[14:03] gates of hell so what does this mean
[14:09] Saints what does it mean to me I don't
[14:14] know what it means to you but what does
[14:16] it mean to me it means the Word of God
[14:19] not here the Word of God has been
[14:21] revealed they strike in my heart you
[14:26] know maybe you've got to a place where
[14:28] the runner goggles are speaking to you
[14:30] as you're growing in chroma and then
[14:33] there's there's a place that you wonder
[14:35] is
[14:38] you want me do this every step that we
[14:46] change the fight some people don't want
[14:50] to take steps to change some people

[15:27] Billy Paul said brother better have the
[15:29] devil's number at the end of his life he
