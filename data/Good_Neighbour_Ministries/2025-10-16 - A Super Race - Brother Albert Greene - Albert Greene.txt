And it's so good to be in the house of the Lord tonight and especially this evening where we have our precious brother Albert Green here all the way from Trinidad. He is a wonderful seasoned minister of the gospel of this message. Amen. Praise God. I met Brother Green back in 1995 for the first time. I absolutely fell in love with him. Amen. because he's a wonderful man of God with a heart for the people. Amen. And then I remember, you know, in 1997, we went to visit and um we went to minister myself and brother Tim and brother Green was so gracious to set up nine days of preaching. When I came home, I had to minister the prayer meeting that Friday night, and I ministered, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" I was so uh overwhelmed, but the Lord knew exactly what he was doing and uh used our precious brother to to start the roots to go deep. So, with great honor and respect, I welcome our precious brother, Albert Green. Brother, have your liberty. May the Lord bless you and bless us. God bless you. As we are standing, may we take our scripture reading musicians, as somebody say in South Africa, thank you kindly. Singers, thank you kindly. I don't say that in Trinidad. In Trinidad, um, they know it's time to get up. Okay. Wonderful. Just just read a little scripture before you have your seats. Genesis 1 26- 28. Let us join and read together. And God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." 27. So God created man, &gt;&gt; created he him. &gt;&gt; Verse 28. And God blessed them. And God said unto them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." May we bow our heads, bow our hearts. Father, what else can we say but thank you for a glorious opportunity to be in your house. We believe tonight, Lord, this is the best place we could be in. So we thank you, Lord, for your servants. We thank you for this church. We thank you for the officers. We thank you, Lord, and your servant have already told us, Lord, we would leave here better than we came in. We commit ourselves to your care. We pray your blessings be upon us from the pulpit to the pew. Lord God, as your prophet already said, Father God, I've never ministered a message yet, but as the Holy Spirit minister through me and Lord is a prayer of my heart that the Holy Spirit will minister through me and hear through you, Lord, bless them all in Jesus precious name. Amen. And amen and amen. God bless you. be seated by God's grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Over, as brother Danny was telling you, over 30 years ago, we have a close relationship with this church and back home. Certainly, special regards to Brother John. Amen. Brother Danny and the officers of the church. If you'll permit me to say uh your precious pastor John as pastor, he set what is a precedent throughout the world. We having a there are a lot of problems throughout the world in what you call succession planning. But brother John has set a model example that I believe would help a lot of people through the world. &gt;&gt; So he had to have a good church to support him. He had to have a a a a good team of people. But what he did, he has set a precedent. &gt;&gt; Amen. Throughout the world. So as brother John was uh brother Danny was saying, you know, they say first impressions are lasting. So brother John and his team came to Trinidad over 30 years ago and they were my first visitors as a pastor. Right. first visitors and as a matter of fact this church is the first church I ministered in in Canada. So we have a lot of first together over 30 years ago. Uh it is said that first impressions are lasting. So for sure brother Danny never forgot those times he had at the Ramla's residence and his visit to Trinidad. There was something about it stays with him. I don't know if brother Mike is here but he will always remain. It was a special time for brother Mike here because when brother Mike came across with us it was during a special time he was going through and he taught us a little chorus in moments like these. So at least let him know we still remember that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bless the Lord. I glad to see the Trinies here. Wonderful Jagenard family. Amen. [Applause] and also our precious sister who was a part of the singing group. I had the honor of marrying them some years ago. So certainly glad to see them. And above all, I do have my nearest dear ones, Canadian visitors with me, my sisters and nieces. I trust God that God richly blessed them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh other than that, they volunteered to come, right? I didn't have to cajul them. They wanted to do something for me and they volunteered to be here. So I pray God's riches blessing be upon them. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; So I want to share a little thought with you tonight. Amen. The Lord help us. I want to speak to you about you. &gt;&gt; And we come to church to hear hear what the word say about us. &gt;&gt; So I want to speak to you a little. Amen. to you about you and a little thought by God's grace. Amen. A super race. And I will start by using two quotations from God's prophet. The message super sign build a taught by God's grace. The message super sign paragraph 66 and 67. Not what you call a super race, but what God calls a super race. You thank God for that. &gt;&gt; God have a super race. &gt;&gt; What God calls a super race because they got what? Super that super race got supernatural power &gt;&gt; with supernatural sign through a supernatural belief in a supernatural word. &gt;&gt; You see what make us super? &gt;&gt; You see what make us super? &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe in a supernatural God. &gt;&gt; Amen. We we identify with a to believe the word is something supernatural. Yes. &gt;&gt; Everybody cannot believe. There are somebody who born to believe. &gt;&gt; There's somebody who has received the gift of believing. Amen. Given a supernatural word from a supernatural God. Amen. You talk about super. Do we have it on the screen? Sorry. Bless the Lord. Should I be getting it on the screen? &gt;&gt; Thank you. Supernatural God paragraph 67 in a supernatural body in a natural people. &gt;&gt; Are are you following us by God's grace? &gt;&gt; We talking about a supernatural God in a supernatural body in a natural people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Giving supernatural signs. Hallelujah. a super race. They that know their God shall do exploits, &gt;&gt; great exploits, &gt;&gt; and show a supernatural sign, a people, Abraham's seed, a sign of the supernatural Christ risen from the dead supernaturally. So this is about us. Amen. This is all about us is God's prophet is identifying to us is not what you call super but what God calls super. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message Pogameanian church age. Amen. Paragraph 171. Here is what I'm trying to say to you. The law of reproduction is that each species bring forth after its kind. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even according to Genesis 1:11, and God said, "Let the earth bring forth grass and herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed it is in itself upon the earth." And it was so. Whatever life was in the seed, came forth into a plant, &gt;&gt; and then into a fruit. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The very same law applies to the church today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever seed started the church will come forth &gt;&gt; and will be like the original seed &gt;&gt; because it is the same seed. &gt;&gt; In these last days, super race. In these last days, the true bride of Christ, bride church, Christ seed will come to a headstone &gt;&gt; and she Amen. will be the super church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She will be the super church. &gt;&gt; She will be the super race. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. as she nears him. &gt;&gt; They that in the bride will be so much like him. They will even be in his very image. &gt;&gt; This is in order to be united with him. They will be the very manifestation of the living God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So church, &gt;&gt; this is what we are called to a super race. Now we are living in a day when everything is super. As a matter of fact, it's no longer super. It's mega. &gt;&gt; You even have mega churches. &gt;&gt; So everything has to be huge. Everything has to be very large. So we are living naturally in a super day. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Naturally we are living in a super age. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have super jets, super highway. Everything is super. &gt;&gt; Amen. So man by nature making himself a name. By nature, man want to get make something super. Amen. Man want to make something big. Amen. Man wants to make something bigger than the other. Everyone. Amen. And so there is throughout history the cry about a super race. Amen. A super race is one race ruling over the other. &gt;&gt; Hitler once said that we the Germans we are the super race. Amen. Stalin said no we the Russians are the super race. England would say as long as there's a world there will re be an England. So everybody and America saying we'll be great again. &gt;&gt; So throughout the world there is that longing in man to be the super. &gt;&gt; Every country, every government, every people wants to be super. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. They all have a super idea. &gt;&gt; But just like Pharaoh, &gt;&gt; just like the all the Caesars, &gt;&gt; all their kingdoms will come to the dust. &gt;&gt; So we thank God for a real super. &gt;&gt; We thank God that we could identify ourselves this evening with a real super. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So by nature, every one of us by nature a sinner man, a fallen son of God, but by nature we want to make something better. Amen. The birds still make the nest the same way. But we are not birds. We are human beings and we want to do something better. Every time in life we want to show improvement. We want you know because something why because something in a man tell a boy there is a better place. &gt;&gt; There's a cry in the human being. There is something more to life. &gt;&gt; So all of us our aim is to have a better car, a better house, a better this, a better that. It is because deep in us there is a cry for something that is better. &gt;&gt; You thank God we know what is better. &gt;&gt; We can appreciate what God what what what we have found what the human being is searching for. By the grace of God we can say thank God I'm anchored in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. So the desire for something greater has always been with man. You remember fallen Adam fallen Adam tried to make get some fig leaf because he wanted to make a super religion. He wanted to make his own way and that that is the human being today. They want to make their own way without the word of almighty God. So church this evening we live in a super day. We live in a world of super people. You know that everybody have the fiction. You remember the days of Superman &gt;&gt; because man don't want to be self and that kind of superman led many lives to suicide because man want to be something else. Amen. So man wants to find their own super way and man attitude to find something super is really devil counterfeit. It is not the real thing but we thank God for a super. Amen. Man's achievement will end up as nothing but there is something that is super. There is a super race. So the message super sign where we share that quotation from. Amen. Tells us not what you call super. We call the mega stores, the mega churches, the mega houses, the mega thing, the mega car. Everything natural we look upon to call that super. But brother, sister, by the grace of God, Amen. Amen. is not what you call super. You think about you remember the the Titanic. The Titanic was a man achievement. Amen. That this is the super boat. But where is the Titanic? In the bottom of the sea. So what it means your achievement means nothing without God. &gt;&gt; No matter what we achieve, thank God for what we achieve. &gt;&gt; Thank God. Because brother, sister, we thank God for shoes. Amen. &gt;&gt; We thank God for clothes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We thank God otherwise we be walking bare feet. &gt;&gt; But that is not God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That just make life a little easier for us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We thank God for a good motor car. It makes life easy for you. But that is not what is super. Amen. So there is a super. God's prophet is speaking about a super race. So, it's not what you call super, but we want what God calls super. &gt;&gt; And I'm saying this evening by the grace of God, we are speaking to you about you. Amen. This is not about somebody else. We are this evening what God calls super. Amen. So, let's get back to Genesis. In Genesis, when God made Adam, everything that God was was reflected in Adam. &gt;&gt; Are we in church? &gt;&gt; Amen. God made Adam. And in Adam, everything that God is was reflected through Adam. a super in Adam. Adam had supreme control over the earth. Amen. Adam was in supreme control over the earth. Adam had the authority. Amen. Adam had the authority to subdue the earth. And God, the scripture said, Genesis 1:28, "Bless them," and said unto them, "Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish over the sea, over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that move upon the earth." So God gave Adam the authority. Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam had the authority to subdue the earth. Adam was really a God man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was not a man. He was a God man. &gt;&gt; Everything that God is was reflected in Adam. &gt;&gt; Adam was the God of the earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Adam controlled the earth &gt;&gt; as God controlled the heavens. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God gave Adam the authority. We want to show you where we fell from. Where we fell from, God gave Adam the authority. Adam was a minor God. Do you know Adam didn't have to pray? Adam didn't have to fasten. &gt;&gt; Adam didn't have to beg. &gt;&gt; Adam didn't have to plead. I don't say, "I don't like you there. You go there." Adam was in control. When Adam spoke, everything obeyed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything obeyed Adam. God made Adam after his likeness. &gt;&gt; Remember the word said, you know, every seed after its kind, &gt;&gt; right? God made Adam in his likeness. Amen. Every seed after its kind. And God said Genesis 1:1 and 12, "Let the earth bring forth grass and herb yielding seed and fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, whose seed it in is itself upon the earth." And it was so. And the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after its kind, and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself a after its kind. And God saw it was good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God, you see now as God's servant taught us, God said it was good. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you something about you. Everything God made was good. &gt;&gt; Everything God made was good. &gt;&gt; God had no fault in his first creation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And my God's prophet tells us if God could not find a fault in his first creation, he could never find a fault in his second creation. &gt;&gt; Are you a part of his second creation? &gt;&gt; Are you a part of a group that is born a new? &gt;&gt; Are you a part of a group that's born out of him? He said God found no fault in his first creation. &gt;&gt; Everything God did was good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That was his first creation. &gt;&gt; We thank God we are his second creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are his second creation. So we see with Adam, he had power to subdue everything. Amen. Adam was just like God. Every seed after its kind. Amen. Adam was automatically like God. Adam was a supreme being. Adam had supreme control. Adam there was an eternal person. &gt;&gt; Adam there was the king of the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam had rulership. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Think about where we fail from. Adam had dominion. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was the God of this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam was in God's image. &gt;&gt; Adam was in God's likeness. &gt;&gt; Oh, church. &gt;&gt; But it is after the fall. &gt;&gt; After the fall, man was born in sin. After the fall, man was born in sin. Amen. After the fall, we end up to be in the likeness and image of fallen Adam, not in the image of God. So the fall in the garden of Eden distorted a good pity. The fall in the garden of Eden spoiled the pitier. Now since then man was born without godship. Man born without power to subdue. Now we had to run from a dog. The power to subdue. We born without it. We born without power to have dominion. Amen. Man now born because of the fall. Before the fall, Amen. Man was man had rulership. Man had dominion. Man was the God of the earth. But now since the fall, Amen. Man was born in a fallen image. So Adam then lost his godship. Adam lost his position. Adam lost his place. But the scripture of Job Joel, sorry, 2:25 tells us, it gives us a promise. Amen. Joel 2:25 gives us a promise. And the promise is, "And I will restore to you." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I will restore to you the years that the locust had eaten, &gt;&gt; the kangaroo and the caterpillar and the palmer, my great army which I sent among you. Hallelujah. So God has promised &gt;&gt; a restoration. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God has promised a restoration from the fall in the garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; God have promised a restoration that you could be born again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God has promised a restoration to give you a new birth. &gt;&gt; God has Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God has promised a reconciliation. God has promised to get back man to God. &gt;&gt; That is why hallelujah that in this body we are in Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; In this body we live in Satan Eden. But in these souls we have shalom with God. &gt;&gt; In the in our soul we have peace with God. &gt;&gt; Eventually what God intended in the Garden of Eden some of us have the privilege of enjoying it today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the message shalom is an incident. Man has been restored. We still live in state and Eden in these bodies. But the inside of the inside is a part of God &gt;&gt; is a part of God's word. &gt;&gt; That's why the message tell you greater is he that is in you &gt;&gt; than in this world. &gt;&gt; This is the world. &gt;&gt; This is not a believer. &gt;&gt; This flesh of ours is beast. That's right. &gt;&gt; I said the flesh of ours is animal. &gt;&gt; That is why we behave like animals sometime. &gt;&gt; This flesh is not God. &gt;&gt; This bless this flesh came the perverted way. &gt;&gt; It came the wrong way. &gt;&gt; Who could make a clean thing out of an unclean thing? &gt;&gt; Amen. But thanks be to God, there's a greater is he. &gt;&gt; There's a greater is he that is in in you. Hallelujah. So I want to tell you something tonight by the grace of God. There is a people right now have the ability to subdue this piece of earth. &gt;&gt; This piece of earth. Sometime you know people want to control the world but start by controlling yourself. &gt;&gt; Start by getting yourself under control. Start by telling this body what where it could go. &gt;&gt; What it could say. &gt;&gt; How about subduing? You know people want to subdue the storm. You want to subdue &gt;&gt; but you can't subdue the hurricane in your own life. &gt;&gt; In our lives we have hurricane &gt;&gt; in our life. We have storms in our life. This flesh running a mock will make us do what it want to do. But thanks be to God there's a greater is he that is within you &gt;&gt; and a greater than he that is in the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, thank be to God, we have a promise tonight. A promise of a restoration. &gt;&gt; Amen. The message foundation, fundamental foundation for faith. Amen. E10. Quote number three, God's prophet tells us here, "And Adam never had to be sick. He never had to die. &gt;&gt; He never had a worry. &gt;&gt; He never had a heartache. He never had fear. He just climbed up in the arms of the father and just like a child, everything was his &gt;&gt; and whatever he asked for why he got it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything obeyed him because he was God's child and a child is the heir of all things. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But church, when man fell, he lost this. &gt;&gt; When man fell, he lost this. Hallelujah. Amen. But but what he lost in the fall, Christ come as a redeemer. &gt;&gt; What he lost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What he lost in the fall, Christ come as a redeemer. &gt;&gt; Did you ever stop to think what Christ redeem us for? He give us everlasting life. &gt;&gt; Amen. He brought us back to eternal fellowship and relationship with God &gt;&gt; to be sons and daughters of God again. &gt;&gt; He to restore us back all that Adam lost in the fall. &gt;&gt; He has restored us. &gt;&gt; Come on church. We only waited for this bodies to change &gt;&gt; but deep inside of us we are restored. &gt;&gt; He walks with me. He talks with me. Hallelujah. We have fellowship with him. We have a relationship with him. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We have a relationship with God. Amen. We have fellowship with God. &gt;&gt; We and God are not enemies. &gt;&gt; I say we are not enemies. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We have shalom. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have peace. &gt;&gt; We still live in this body of flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. In this body, this body that will war have a battle with us. This body going to fight you till you go to the grave. So don't think the fight finish. You have instant coffee, instant porridge, but you don't have instant deliverance. You know, you living a super data. Everything is instant. &gt;&gt; You get everything fast. Everything you want. Fast food fast everything. But you don't get fast deliverance. &gt;&gt; You have to die daily. &gt;&gt; Not monthly. No, not every Sunday when you come to church. I the apostle Paul say for I to live I have to die daily. &gt;&gt; Daily I have a battle because I know something. And I you know sometime in in fellowships and we have a tendency to look to somebody to be the enemy but your greatest enemy is you. Watch the mirror. &gt;&gt; I say your greatest enemy is you. &gt;&gt; Your greatest hindrance is you. &gt;&gt; Our greatest enemy is ourselves. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; That sound strange to some of you. &gt;&gt; No. You you want to look at somebody else as your enemy. Is you who standing in the way of God. is you give yourself and God a lot of trouble because you're not willing to surrender. You're not willing to heal yourself. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Blessed be his holy name tonight. Amen. So, Christ come to restore. Christ didn't come to open a church. He didn't come to open some religion. He didn't come to start some church. He came to restore. Amen. &gt;&gt; Restore to us all that Adam lost. &gt;&gt; All that Adam lost. You remember the first message our Lord preached? He said he must be born again. His first doctrine, you must be born again. &gt;&gt; All that Adam lost through the new birth, we are restored back to God. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are restored back to God. Come on, church. Think about it. &gt;&gt; Adam fell in God's Eden, but we having a victory in Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; Come on. Are you having that victory? &gt;&gt; We are having a victory in Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. We overcoming. We are victorious. This is the devil's world. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the devil's world. But we have the ability to move contrary to the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What happened to the first Eve will never happen to this Eve. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What happened to that Eve will not happen to this woman. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a special people. &gt;&gt; This is a special people. &gt;&gt; This is his bride. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. So through the new birth, thanks be to God, we have the opportunity to be restored back to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our first birth, right? Because of Adam, because of what took place in the Garden of Eden, our first birth, Amen, produced sin, our first birth produced sickness. Our first birth produce fear, but our second birth correct the error. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Correct the error. So who you are, you are a new creation. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. You are a new creation in the same body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say in the same body. That's why God's propheted the William Brandham that used to live here don't live here no longer. &gt;&gt; Is someone else living here? &gt;&gt; Amen. A new creation. And what the word of God tells us in 2 Corinthians 5:17, "Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature, old things are passed away, and behold, all things have become new." &gt;&gt; Amen. The second birth, Amen. correct the error. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are a new creature. Old things have passed away. So it is your second birth that produced this evening the new race. &gt;&gt; It is your second birth this evening that produce the superior race. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is your second birth that have you born in the image and the likeness of almighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we praise God. Amen. We thank God for a natural birth because it takes a natural birth to bring us to the new birth. But we but a natural birth is a birth of sin, is a birth of sickness, is a birth of death. But thanks be to God for a new birth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Naturally, you are born a loser. Naturally, you are born defeated. Naturally. Hallelujah. We are born defeated. No matter where you born, how you born, you may feel I had everything. But you are born a loser. &gt;&gt; Amen. The wages of sin is death. &gt;&gt; Amen. The gift of God is eternal life. &gt;&gt; We are born defeated. &gt;&gt; We are born losers. But thanks be to God for a new birth. &gt;&gt; Thanks be to God for a new birth. &gt;&gt; All things are passed away. &gt;&gt; All things are passed away. Oh, glory to God. that you will realize by God's grace who you are. You are the beginning of the creation of God. You are the beginning of the new creation. So Adam was the beginning of the creation of God. But now through Christ, you are part of that new creation. &gt;&gt; Now through Christ, Amen. Christ is the beginning. But uh Revelation 3:14 tells us, "Unto the angels of the church of loud decision and right, these things said the amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God." Amen. So Adam was the beginning of that creation, but now Christ is the beginning of our new creation. Through Christ, we are part today of a new race. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Christ is the first of this new race. Christ is the beginning of this new creation. Christ is the last Adam. Amen. Christ is the last Adam. Hallelujah. Christ is the last Adam. Amen. So we are not born into a race of failures. With the new birth, we are not born in a race of defeated people. &gt;&gt; No, with the new birth, we are born into a super race. &gt;&gt; With the new birth, you are born in a race of overcomers. &gt;&gt; Come on, remember the scripture said every seed after its time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we are of a different kind. &gt;&gt; We are of Christ kind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So thank God for the new birth. &gt;&gt; We bless God for the new birth. Amen. Because without a new birth, you could never be a part of the new creation. &gt;&gt; But we can say thanks be to God. Everything that Adam lost, you become. I said everything that Adam lost you become. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. We were born. Amen. We were born in this new birth. We born with his nature. &gt;&gt; That nature breathes out all imperfection. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; In simple language, you were taught, you know, when a child is to be born into this world, the great God know what diseases this child is going to confront. The great God in his great plan, natural plan knows exactly what condition will be in the world at that time. &gt;&gt; And that child is born with an immunity. Before you take her to the clinic to get tablet vaccine and install some vaccine, that child is born with something &gt;&gt; and they don't get it from the tin of milk. I don't know where is it. Where's the brand they use today? In my days was Clayman. No, it don't come from a thinner milk. &gt;&gt; It come from the mother's breast. &gt;&gt; That child is fed. Amen. And in in in in that feeding, that child has an immunity &gt;&gt; to withstand what is there in the earth for that time. But the truth be told, the truth be told, you could have natural imperfection. You could have a child born with some kind of fault. But thanks be to God, there will never be an error with your new birth. &gt;&gt; Thanks be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So God, when you your new birth, you are birthed to face with whatsoever &gt;&gt; challenge that is here to confront you. You're born with that in your genes. &gt;&gt; It is a part of your spiritual genes that you are born to withstand. That's why you could believe no devil could put something too hard on you. You have what it takes &gt;&gt; to be an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So brothers, sister, we are born into a new race. We are born into a race of overcomers. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are born tonight into a new race. Remember every seed after its kind. Every seed after its order, we thank God. What order we have been born with. So church, everything that Adam lost by the grace of God, we now become. We have what it takes to breathe out every imperfection. &gt;&gt; What was released unto us? Not the life of Christ. &gt;&gt; The life of Christ is. Do you not recognize? Amen. What Christianity is really is? Christianity is not I living. Is Christ living his life in me? &gt;&gt; I say it again. &gt;&gt; We could never try to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; We could never be Christians on our own. It is Christ living his life in me. &gt;&gt; Is not I living, &gt;&gt; it's I giving up. &gt;&gt; Is I surrendering &gt;&gt; and Christ living his blessed life in us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we are part of the new creation. Jesus was the first. Hallelujah. He was the beginning of the new creation. Jesus was the beginning of the new order. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when we see in the scriptures Jesus walking on water, he was showing us what Adam lost. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus show us what Adam was supposed to be. &gt;&gt; Jesus showing us exactly what Adam lost. So we heard what Adam was, but we never see Adam in action. But in Jesus Christ, we see what Adam lost. Amen. And think about it this evening. If you don't re re recognize nothing else, recognize with our new birth, everything that was in Jesus is in you. &gt;&gt; Say it again. &gt;&gt; Everything that was in Jesus is in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every ability of God is within you. &gt;&gt; Lord help us. We have every ability of God within us. But we need to do something. We need tonight to recognize that. We need to recognize that what was in Jesus is now in you. Amen. The fall Amen. The fall caused man to lose his true identity. The fall caused man to lose who he really was. Amen. Like the eagle. Amen. The power and ability of the eagle was always in the eagle. &gt;&gt; But the eagle was in a bar. The eagle had to come to a recognition. Something had to give the eagle an awakening. &gt;&gt; I am saying by grace of God, the power of God is within you. Amen. &gt;&gt; The ability of God is within you. &gt;&gt; Everything that was in Jesus Christ is in you. &gt;&gt; But what we need to do is to come to our recognition. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. Take back go back to that quotation. Amen. Foundation quote number four. Man was made. Amen. Man, fundamental foundation of faith. E9. Man was made as a secondary God on earth. That was how man was made. Man was made a secondary God on earth. He was given power to control all things, all the elements of the earth. That was Adam. Adam was given these great powers. But then the power that he was given to make himself is where he fell. Adam could speak to the winds and it would stop. He could speak to the trees, they would obey him. He could speak to wildlife, it would obey him. He could speak to the waters, ever what it was. Everything obeyed Adam. Now, that's the beginning of man. That's what God gave him power over everything on the earth through the fall. He lost that power. Then he became unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship and friendship and fellowship with the father. Then he lost that and all the great channels become clogged up and he could not get through. So he's showing us where the fall carried man. But now what Adam was in God, Christ has redeem us back to that. [Music] &gt;&gt; That is why I think our message fellowship by redemption. God's prophet tells us what God intended in the Garden of Eden, Amen, is happening right now. &gt;&gt; What God intended, the great plan of Almighty God &gt;&gt; is true. Amen. When we leave, a body change will take us to even the redemption of our natural body. But the real you and the real me, what God planned in the Garden of Eden, there are people today have in that relationship right now. &gt;&gt; That is what we that is what your ministering is all about. &gt;&gt; That is where the word has taken us back to that place by the grace of the Lord. Now what Adam was in God, Christ has redeemed us back to that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A redeemer is to redeem anything to bring it back to its origin again. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Super rest. &gt;&gt; Super rest. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, we have been brought back to origin again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Like the eagle. Amen. The power of the eagle was always there. The eagle was always an eagle. &gt;&gt; Paul in a baniard didn't change him. He was always an eagle. Amen. Hallelujah. Living under whatever little he could live under. He was still an eagle. But brother, he did not. He lost his identity. The eagle did not even know he could have fly. The eagle did not even know he have these wings and that wings have a purpose because he was growing up in a wrong environment. But one day by the grace of the Lord, hallelujah, the eagle get an awakening. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The eagle come to a recognition of who he is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He heard a voice. Hallelujah. And it brought an eagle to a recognition. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I thank God we have been wakened. I tell about you had he quickened. &gt;&gt; You had he quickened who were once dead in sins and trespasses. &gt;&gt; You had an awakening. &gt;&gt; If you did not have awakening, you'd have still be dead. &gt;&gt; I said if you did not have awakening, you'd have still be dead. But you heard the word &gt;&gt; and he he quickened you. &gt;&gt; He made you that was dead, he made you alive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have he quickened. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I thank God for awakening. &gt;&gt; I thank God for a quickening by God's grace. Amen. Is that brother Fred voice? Somebody sound like brother Fred. All right. I expected him here. Or is this brother here? Maybe. See when voices sound. So when God placed Adam on the earth, Amen. Adam did not have to do anything to get authority. Adam did not have to do anything &gt;&gt; to get power. No, he didn't have to do nothing. Power and authority was in Adam by creation. &gt;&gt; He did not had to walk up anything. &gt;&gt; He did not have to beat up himself. &gt;&gt; You know, as some of us try to do, &gt;&gt; he didn't have to do nothing to get authority. &gt;&gt; He born with authority. &gt;&gt; He was born with power. Amen. Hallelujah. Do you believe? &gt;&gt; Do you believe? &gt;&gt; And one of you believe you too when you are born again, everything we have need of is in us. &gt;&gt; You You tell me you believe Adam had power and authority. But do you believe everything you have need of us of sorry is in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So maybe what we need to do church amen is to check and see where we are lacking. If we are lacking on recognizing what God has done for us, remember the eagle in the barard lack recognition. He was out there. He lacked the recognition that he was an eagle. We see, Amen. When God placed Adam on the earth, Adam did not have to do anything to get authority and power. We know is when sin came in mit is poor. But Adam power and authority was in Adam by creation. But I'm suggesting to us by God's grace, we the born again need to come to a recognition that what we have need of is in us. &gt;&gt; You remember the prophet said healing is in you. &gt;&gt; The rapture is in you. &gt;&gt; It coming from nowhere. Hh they coming from nowhere else. &gt;&gt; Do not recognize naturally. Naturally you look at an orange tree. Every orange is in the tree. &gt;&gt; Every orange is the seed. &gt;&gt; It just has to come to a maturity. &gt;&gt; It has to have a certain amount that caring. But no, but you don't go and stick orange in the tree. No, the orange is in the tree. So what we have need of is in us. Hallelujah. Now think about Adam in the garden of Eden. Adam, amen, did not have to eat anything to become what God was. He didn't have to eat anything. He was what God is. &gt;&gt; Amen. But remember, Satan came to Eve. And when Satan came to Eve, what Satan told her? If you want to be like God, eat this. If you want to be like God. So she did not even know who she was. &gt;&gt; She had no recognition what she was &gt;&gt; and what the devil was doing her was questioning her ability. The devil was questioning what is already in her. Remember before the fall they were already like God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what the devil was doing is attacking her position. &gt;&gt; And that's the work of the enemy to attack what Christ has done for you. &gt;&gt; We got to stand up and war against the enemy. &gt;&gt; The work of the enemy is to attack Yes. &gt;&gt; Attack what Christ had already done. &gt;&gt; It is a finished work. &gt;&gt; It is already done. &gt;&gt; God has already done it. &gt;&gt; God don't half deliver anybody. God do complete deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. God completely deliver. It is a finished work. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is the high priest of your confession. &gt;&gt; You have to confess what he has done for you. &gt;&gt; So the devil attack today is to cause you to doubt the word. &gt;&gt; The devil's attack today is to cause us to doubt our position. &gt;&gt; The devil don't want you to know who you are, &gt;&gt; right? You know, you you you you you don't find it strange and great that God's prophet over 40 times make reference to the African slave. He make reference to that boy. Is was he short of illustration? Or doesn't that illustration mean something specific? That African boy, he was a slave living in slavish condition. But he know who he was. &gt;&gt; He know he even know he dream he could ever get back to Africa. But he is the child of a king. &gt;&gt; He is the son of a king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And because he know who he happened to be, no condition pressing them. &gt;&gt; Nobody could depress him. &gt;&gt; Nobody. He getting licks like everybody. He eating his slave slave food like everybody but he operate like a son of a king. &gt;&gt; I am the child of a king. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that is what the devil is fighting us about. The devil don't want you to recognize your position. Super race. A new race of people. He He wants you to see yourself in a different way. &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil don't want you to come to that place. Amen. And amen. To know who you are. Amen. Not who he was. God's prophet was a child of Charles and there. But he's now a son of God, &gt;&gt; a daughter of God. You got to know your position. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you believe according to the word of God that you are co-equal with Christ? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe? Amen. That you can recognize through the word of God you are co-equal with Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the devil fears. The devil is afraid of you. You know &gt;&gt; he is afraid. You don't realize how the devil afraid of you. &gt;&gt; The devil don't want you to know your position. &gt;&gt; He don't want know you to know who you are. He don't want you to recognize your day. He don't want you to recognize your position. Hallelujah. Let's hear how God's prophet express it in the revelation of Jesus Christ. Church age book page 15 paragraph 3. Now remember 153. Now remember quote number five. This Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the book of Revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it, make it lukewarm, formal and powerless. But it exposes Satan revealing his work attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting discrediting of God's word right down to the time he's cast in the lake of fire. He fights that. That's the devil. He cannot stand it. He knows if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is. Hallelujah. And what she stand for. She can do the greater works. &gt;&gt; She will be an invincible army. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is what you are called for. &gt;&gt; We are not called to be a group of cowards. We are not called to be a group just surrendering ourselves. No, the devil don't want you to know who you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He cannot stand that. He knows if the people get the true revelation. That is why we are told in the word of God, pray for revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pray for revelation. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Pray that God open up his word to you. &gt;&gt; Pray because power is in revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit. Amen. Satan will powerless before her. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; That's our promise to the new race. &gt;&gt; That's the promise to the super race. Hallelujah. Satan will be powerless before her. He will be definitely thwarted today as when Christ withtood every effort to gain power over him in the desert. Amen. Remember the temptation of the Lord and what the Lord used? He used the word. &gt;&gt; He used the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatsoever the devil come with, he fight the devil with the word. The devil cannot take the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As one would say, amen. If Eve in the beginning there would have would would have tell the devil, wait a minute, let me go and call my pastor. Pastor Adam, the devil had gone. But the devil know how to operate. Amen. We have to know how to operate. Amen. To withtood every effort to gain power over him. Yes. Satan hates revelation. But we love it. &gt;&gt; We love it. &gt;&gt; Pray for revelation. Ask God for revelation. We love revelation with the true revelation in our lives. The gates of hell &gt;&gt; cannot prevail against us. &gt;&gt; We will prevail. &gt;&gt; We will prevail. Oh, glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it takes us this evening to recognize who we are. And if we would recognize who we are this evening, we will be an invincible army. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If we would recognize who we are, we would be an invincible army. Do you want to be a part of that army? &gt;&gt; Are you in the church triumphant? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you in the Savior's bride? &gt;&gt; Come and be baptized into the body. Amen. God calls you to be a superior race. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. As we wind down by the grace of God, Christ is the mystery of God. Paragraph 240. The new birth is Christ is a revelation. God has revealed to you this great mystery. &gt;&gt; You see, sometimes we go ahead believing. Amen. We go ahead believing that revelation is a church revelation, you know. No, this is an individual thing. &gt;&gt; God revealing to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Revealing to you the individual. Christ has revealed to you. It's not a collective revelation, you know. No. The great mystery and new of the new birth. Now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and God expressing himself through his word by the same action same things that he did making the word manifest. Oh if the church only knew its position. Oh, if the church only knew its position and thanks be to God, it will one day. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If the church only knew its position and thanks be to God, it will one day then the rapture will go when it when she know what it is. About to close. Take a last quotation from perfect faith. Hallelujah. So from the scripture we will see our Lord Jesus knowing who he was. He overcame every demon. Amen. The Satan come to misquote the scripture for the Lord. Amen. Thou shalt throw yourself down and thou shalt do this. The Lord defeated the enemy on the word of God. man shall live by the word of God. That why he could have answered the devil and tell the devil with all your preaching get thee hence Satan &gt;&gt; because anything contrary to the word is the devil. Jesus knowing who he was overcame every demon. Amen. And that is what the enemy used with Eve. get her to question who she is. God's prophet in a quotation said, "Amen, the bride asks no questions." Amen. We don't question the word. &gt;&gt; We believe the word. &gt;&gt; We don't question the word. We don't question what go be it unto me. &gt;&gt; What Mary said, be it unto me according to thy word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If the word said cast it, then cast it. If the whatsoever the word said, be it unto me according to your word. The message perfect faith. Maybe you all stand. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now remember they had the word and the word was flesh. Then the word tell them I give you power. They had the power. Amen. They had the power, but they did not have faith to operate that word that was in them. See what I mean? Jesus had it. He was the word and he had faith that what he said would happen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, bring him here." Paragraph 64. He had faith with his power and he said I can do nothing in myself. He relied on what he was. He relied on knowing who he was. He had faith in God who made him the word. know that he was because the scripture said he was this and every scripture tied to prove he was exactly what the scripture said he would be. He knew hallelujah what he was. Do you know who you are? &gt;&gt; We need to examine ourselves. Do we know what Christ has wrought for us? Are we able? Amen. Should we be? You know, there was a illustration God's prophet made. This lady from India, she she had a lot of checks in her Bible, but yet she was impoverished. She didn't have no food to eat, but she didn't even know there were checks. She had them in in the word of God. She had it there. She didn't even know what it was. And she lived an impoverished life. We are called by God's grace to recognize who you are. Recognize not what you have done. Recognize what God has wrought in your life. &gt;&gt; Recognize what God has made you to be. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Father God, we thank you for a glorious opportunity to be a part of your plan, to be a part of your program, Lord God, to be with the saints at this time. We certainly thank you for lives, Lord. We have seen even amongst us, Lord God, have been in your word, serving you and being faithful to you. We pray your continued blessing upon them. Continued blessing upon this church. The pastor Lord God as even my said and early father Lord God what you have wrought even amongst them here is a great example for many parts of the world. We pray your continued blessings be upon us as we love you and we appreciate you in Jesus precious name. Amen. God bless you, brother D. God. Amen. Thank you, my brother. God bless you, brother Green. Amen. Glory to God. Here, Brother Green, these are yours. Praise God. How many enjoyed that this evening? Amen. What was the Lord telling us? You know, when Adam was created in the image of God, we were in Adam. We've heard that we we were in Adam. When he fell, we all fell. Amen. And that's why the whole human race fell. But Jesus Christ, when he came, he came to give us his life and to bring us back, to redeem us back. And what was lost in the Garden of Eden was the book of inheritance, the book of life. He forfeited the book. But here in 1963, what does God do? He sends us a prophet. And and what does that prophet do? Identify Jesus Christ in the opening of the word. And here he comes. The mighty angel comes down. Christ himself. And now he's got the book back in his hand. Amen. Glory to God. And that's what that's what he's doing here tonight. That's what he was doing here tonight. He came in 63 with the open book, but he knew that there'd be some in 2025 that would need to hear their name. Amen. Because that's what the book of inheritance is. It's calling the names of the sons and the daughters of the living God. Amen. Did you hear your name tonight? Glory to God. If you can identify with the super race, it's because you've heard your name. Oh, she's a glorious church without spot or wrinkle. She's a glorious church washed in the blood of the lamb. Oh, it's a glorious church without spot wrinking gold washed in the blood of the lamb. Oh yes, she's a glorious church. Oh, wash in the blood of the lamb. [Music] She's a glorious [Music] wash in the blood. [Music] Oh, are you in the church triumph? Are you in the Savior's [Music] baptiz into the body and forever more? Oh, have you been baptized into the body? Baptized with the Holy Ghost. There is but one way to enter today just as they did on. Oh, are you in the church triumpher? Are you in the Savior's Christ? Come and be baptized by thee and forever. [Music] I'm a new creation. I'm a brand new man. All things are passed away. I'm born again. Born and a coner. That's who I am. I'm a new creation. I'm a brand. Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. He redeemed me. I've been born again to it. I thank God he justified me of this fullness we have all received of him. I'm a new creation of brand new man. All things are passed away. I'm born again. All might conqueror. That's who I am. I'm a new creation. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How many enjoy that tonight? Hallelujah. You are dismissed. Amen. Hallelujah. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that oh greater is he that is in me that greater is he. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Satan's like Satan is like a roaring line roaming to and fro seeking whom he may devou. The Bible tells us so. Many souls have been spread to fall in some weak hour. But God's promise us today. [Music] No one's greater is he. No one's greater than me. [Music] On the day on the day of Pentecost came a mighty Russian and it blew into the upper room and baptize all with a power with a power greater than any earthly f I'm so glad I've got it too. I'm going to let the home go. Oh, grace. Oh, grace that is in me. [Music] Greater is cleared. Oh, no one's greater is he that is in me. [Applause] [Music] One more time. Greater receive. Oh greater. No one's greater. Greater is he that is in me that one more time. [Music]
