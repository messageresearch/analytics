[2:02] God bless you
[2:04] Saints welcome into the house of the
[2:06] Lord this
[2:07] morning read from the book of Psalms
[2:15] 130 says out of the depths have I Cried
[2:19] unto thee Oh Lord Lord hear my
[2:22] voice let thine ears be attentive to the
[2:26] voice of my
[2:28] supplications if thou Lord should Market
[2:33] iniquities oh Lord who shall
[2:36] stand but there is forgiveness with thee
[2:39] that thou mayest be feared I wait for
[2:43] the Lord my soul doth wait and in his
[2:48] word do I hope my soul waiteth for the
[2:51] Lord more than they that watch for the
[2:54] morning I say more than they that watch
[2:57] for the morning let Israel hope in the
[3:01] Lord for with the Lord there is Mercy
[3:04] and with him is plenteous
[3:08] redemption and he shall redeem Israel
[3:11] from all his
[3:15] iniquities you know it's at um this time
[3:17] of the year that many churches they they
[3:20] look to
[3:22] Advent um you know it's a season of
[3:26] Advent um and when you look at the word
[3:28] Advent it means
[3:30] his
[3:31] coming waiting on his
[3:34] coming and you know this morning I was
[3:36] reading um you know a little
[3:40] devotional
[3:41] and with respect to this scripture here
[3:45] in Psalms David speaking he says I wait
[3:48] for the Lord my soul doth wait my soul
[3:51] doth wait and in his word do I place my
[3:56] hope we're waiting on the word
[4:00] if we're in
[4:02] Advent we're because we're waiting on
[4:05] the word this morning amen we're waiting
[4:07] to hear from the Lord you know the
[4:09] Psalms uh the psalmist said it like this
[4:13] I wait for the Lord my whole being Waits
[4:16] and in his word I put my trust this is
[4:19] one of 15 Psalms known as pilgrim songs
[4:24] or the songs of a scent comprising of
[4:27] Psalms 120 to 134 sung by Jewish
[4:31] Travelers making the Trek to
[4:34] Jerusalem are we like Israel on our Trek
[4:39] to the promised land amen praise
[4:43] God if you read the rest of the chapter
[4:45] you'll notice a heaviness a t a
[4:48] tenderness a tone of
[4:50] repentance the psalmist cries out from
[4:53] the depths wanting to be heard begging
[4:56] for mercy longing for Redemption in his
[5:00] people all the while hoping and waiting
[5:04] on the Lord waiting on the
[5:07] word amen if you've ever
[5:11] wondered uh how you know um if if you've
[5:16] ever wondered who other than you has had
[5:19] to Hope in wait on and trust in the Lord
[5:23] It's
[5:25] everyone everyone needs to be waiting on

[5:30] under great expectation this morning to
[5:34] hear from the Lord to hear his word

[5:40] expectation the thing is they're waiting

[22:50] thanks if I the words don't come out
[22:53] it's because I'm still shaken this
[22:56] morning
[22:58] I had to give sister Sheila and her
[23:00] family a lift this morning I got into my
[23:03] truck and Android the Android would not
[23:08] connect I sat in my driveway for 10
[23:11] minutes I plugged in my charger cuz that
[23:14] usually connects it kept connecting to
[23:16] my
[23:17] husband and would not allow me to put
[23:20] her address
[23:23] in that was the first challenge this
[23:26] morning I called the sister and I said
[23:28] sister I'm on my way I'm
[23:32] sorry on the drive I called brother
[23:35] Anthony and I let him know Android was
[23:38] giving problems I'm sorry it was not
[23:42] intentional for me to miss this
[23:45] morning's practice but I may miss it
[23:48] because I'm running
[23:51] late Justus then I just looked at the
[23:55] time and it said that I would arrive at
[23:57] at the sister's house at
[24:00] 9:39 and the thought that came after I
[24:03] looked at the time was God could still
[24:05] get me here for 10
[24:08] o' just as the thought came into my
[24:13] mind and I was getting off King making
[24:17] my way onto the link not going
[24:21] fast my truck
[24:24] drifted and was going towards the GU
[24:27] Garden
[24:28] there was nothing I could do in that
[24:30] split two seconds to stop it it didn't
[24:33] swerve and then you know you have where
[24:35] your vehicles just drive off and then
[24:37] you put it back there was nothing I
[24:40] could
[24:41] do but
[24:43] God took the
[24:46] truck and moved it and put it onto the
[24:51] lane there was no wind there was no
[24:53] feeling I did not steer it I didn't
[24:56] change it just like when you go through
[24:59] the snow they tell you turn your your
[25:02] your wheels in the opposite direction
[25:04] when you you're
[25:06] skidding it was not a skid and the ABS
[25:10] never picked it
[25:12] up I averted that I
[25:17] knew that in my heart I do everything to
[25:22] be here because I am always on duty for
[25:26] God
[25:28] and he stood for me and he put me back
[25:33] where I needed to
[25:35] go and I got there and when I got there
[25:39] sister Sheila had to hold me because I
[25:41] was shaking in that Split Second there
[25:44] was nothing I could do God did that for
[25:48] me at the prayer meeting on Friday
[25:52] brother brother Danny ministered prayer
[25:55] and
[25:56] Thanksgiving dar's enough faith in this
[26:00] house and in this house you're under
[26:03] full
[26:04] coverage enough but in need of you and
[26:08] your brother and your sister and them in

[40:21] just beautiful not only is he is the
[40:23] Great and Mighty One of Israel but he's
[40:25] our God God Amen he's expanded his
[40:29] Dominion beyond the Israelites right
[40:32] down to the Gentiles and we are a part
[40:35] of the Gentile bride we thank the Lord
[40:38] for that God bless you uh please be
[40:41] seated just for a minute um we thank God
[40:45] this morning um I heard from three of
[40:47] the ministers not heard but they called
[40:51] but I could not answer at the time and
[40:55] so I'll talk to them and I get back but
[40:57] I guess brother uh Desmond was in uh one
[41:02] church and the young Pastor from another
[41:05] church that heard the word and is all
[41:08] excited about it he couldn't sleep all
[41:10] night and he said he was crying all
[41:14] night brother Desmond said just weeping
[41:17] weeping because he's caught the
[41:19] Revelation that he's been in the message
[41:21] all these years following it and leading
[41:25] it and helping to lead a church and just
[41:28] when the older Pastor has just retired
[41:32] when I was there and he's taken over
[41:36] right the Revelation breaks on him and
[41:38] so we thank the Lord for his goodness
[41:40] and for his grace everything happens in
[41:43] God's time right so we are a free people
[41:47] we don't worry about
[41:49] anything it's just because of our flesh
[41:52] that we have these worries and stuff but
[41:55] the but the be being that lives on the
[41:57] inside here has nothing to worry about
[42:00] uh it's Eternal it comes from God it it
[42:03] it's it's part of God himself praise the
[42:07] Lord but I'm getting into the spirit of
[42:09] preaching so let me go to to the word
[42:12] itself and then we'll talk one with the
[42:15] other I I pray that God will I just
[42:18] about to say I didn't see over there I
[42:20] was just saying I'm going to pray for
[42:21] brother Tim that the Lord will help him
[42:25] with his pains and maybe he's praying to
[42:27] the Lord to help me with my
[42:30] pains and both of us are praying for
[42:32] help brother Christopher with his pains
[42:35] praise the Lord I spoke with him this
[42:38] morning um he still has the pain he's a
[42:41] lot better but we thank the Lord God
[42:44] that he's brought him out they have
[42:46] identified it uh very much uh what it
[42:50] was uh broken ribs that are now
[42:53] healing so he's still going to have some
[42:56] pain especially with uh when you take a
[42:59] real deep breath but he says when he
[43:02] doesn't do that the pain is not there as
[43:05] much and it's just subsiding but we pray
[43:08] that God will bring him a perfect
[43:11] healing it'll take time but pray God
[43:13] will help him and bring him out of it
[43:17] well this morning as you know I've
[43:20] returned from Africa and maybe I could
[43:23] talk about that but I won't because just
[43:27] to let you know that um about uh last
[43:32] week about uh this week actually about
[43:36] uh Wednesday uh then the Holy Spirit
[43:39] gave this to me and started building on
[43:42] it so I have to dismiss all of that and
[43:45] just get to the word here uh and it's so
[43:51] it it's just just God and how God deals
[43:54] with things and look at the timing of
[43:56] when he's dealing with it praise the
[43:58] Lord God bless you glad to have brother
[44:02] Danny and sister Jennifer back here with
[44:04] us praise the Lord uh we know they had a

[44:41] to go to our
[44:43] scripture

[44:47] use uh
[44:49] today uh let me not read it at this time
[44:52] let me just go uh we're going to get it
[44:55] but it's uh uh 1 Corinthians 15:
[44:59] 51-58 praise the Lord for those who are
[45:02] doing the media in the
[45:09] back and in this scripture you will
[45:12] find that uh Paul talks
[45:17] about uh let's look at the first verse
[45:20] please
[45:24] stand behold
[45:28] I show you a
[45:30] mystery we shall not all
[45:34] sleep we shall be all be
[45:38] changed I'd like to call this The
[45:41] Mystery of the
[45:43] change see the mystery of the change
[45:47] praise the Lord
[45:49] hallelujah let's continue to
[45:52] read in a moment in the twinkl of an eye
[45:57] at the last Trump for the trumpet shall
[46:01] sound and the dead shall be raised
[46:05] Incorruptible and again he presses and
[46:08] we shall be
[46:10] changed amen praise God for this
[46:15] corruptible must put on
[46:18] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[46:24] immortality so when this corruptible
[46:28] shall put on in
[46:31] corruption and this Mortal shall put on
[46:35] immortality then shall be brought to
[46:38] pass the say that is written death is
[46:42] swallowed up in Victory praise God oh
[46:48] death where is thy sting oh grave where
[46:53] is thy victory
[46:56] The Sting of death is sin and the
[46:59] strength of sin is the
[47:04] law but thanks be to God which giveth us
[47:08] the victory through our Lord Jesus
[47:12] Christ amen isn't that wonderful amen
[47:16] our gracious father as we enter to this
[47:21] uh miracle moment of receiving the word
[47:26] this
[47:27] Supernatural time when you send upon us
[47:33] your word your spirit and your word for
[47:36] the spirit rides on the word and we
[47:38] thank you Father that as the word Goes
[47:40] Forth the spirit of God will go forth
[47:43] and minister to the people Lord and
[47:46] speak Beyond just lit my literal words
[47:50] and give them the unspoken the unwritten
[47:53] father that they might hear Beyond their
[47:56] natural hearing but to uh see recognize
[48:00] what it is you are saying and what it is
[48:03] you want us to know in this hour and in
[48:06] this day and time that we may be better
[48:08] established in the faith knowing who we
[48:11] are and what we were raised up for to
[48:14] thee we give the glory honor and praise
[48:17] be thou great and worthy one in Jesus
[48:21] name amen God bless you praise the Lord
[48:26] so we are here today to talk about the
[48:31] change praise the
[48:33] Lord
[48:35] and Paul calls this change that we are
[48:41] now
[48:44] ongoing it's
[48:47] ongoing but and Paul calls this ongoing
[48:51] change that we are going through he says
[48:54] behold I show you a
[48:57] mystery so he's saying it's a mystery
[49:01] how we're going to be changed one your
[49:05] soul change your body change and the
[49:09] Rapture your total
[49:12] change total Deliverance that's what the
[49:16] Rapture is going to give
[49:18] you but we are now in the process of a
[49:23] change yes for when when the scripture
[49:26] says we shall be changed and in the
[49:29] twinkling of an eye that's the the
[49:33] ending of the
[49:34] change that is the whole thing winding
[49:38] up at that point in
[49:40] time praise the Lord praise God now we
[49:46] know that in I believe it's
[49:49] taloni he begins to speak about this
[49:53] change and he talks about the change uh
[49:56] in the last part of it coming in the
[49:59] part of the
[50:00] Rapture by saying the change will be
[50:02] brought about not by man not by humans
[50:06] not by anybody else no Theologian no
[50:10] instructor no no supervisor no Bishop
[50:15] but the Lord himself amen shall descend
[50:19] with a shout the voice of the Archangel
[50:23] and the Trump of God
[50:26] Hallelujah so we know that that that is
[50:29] what will bring about this change now we
[50:34] know our first part of our change
[50:39] began when we came out of the
[50:42] world maybe you came out of the world
[50:45] and you just joined a church some church
[50:48] doesn't have to be this one but you were
[50:50] in some church you already started on
[50:54] your change just you you didn't know
[50:56] it God already started that process but
[51:01] you we had no awareness of it and we
[51:04] were going from one Glory one stage to
[51:07] another to another until finally we come
[51:10] here into the message of the hour the
[51:14] fullness of the word which is
[51:17] continually changing us until we come to
[51:21] the uh final stage of that change
[51:26] which we know as the Rapture amen amen
[51:30] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[51:33] so here we are chains coming out of the
[51:37] world coming into a church
[51:39] atmosphere starting to do good deeds
[51:43] being of good
[51:46] service uh of Good Works doing things
[51:49] that would please God and man and touch
[51:54] the lives around around you praise the
[51:56] Lord so we find out that that's the way
[52:00] it
[52:02] was
[52:03] now later we came moved up into another
[52:07] level of that change when we came in
[52:12] contact with this message
[52:15] right no matter what church you were
[52:18] in when you come in contact with this
[52:21] message it lifts you to another height
[52:24] another
[52:26] Dimension it puts you into an entirely
[52:29] different place than you have ever been
[52:32] before you begin to recognize something
[52:36] has happened something is
[52:39] happening I'm being change from Glory
[52:43] onto Glory Hallelujah and I'm starting
[52:45] to believe that one day I'm going to
[52:48] step right into the glory amen because
[52:51] my change is in progress right now glory
[52:55] to God hallelujah and it all happens as
[52:59] the Rapture happens because the Lord
[53:02] himself shall descend with her
[53:05] shout now if you were we're going to use
[53:08] at this point in time Nathaniel in the
[53:12] New
[53:13] Testament how he was a good church man
[53:16] he was a righteous Jew uh kept every
[53:20] word you couldn't touch his life but
[53:24] still he needed somebody to witness to
[53:27] him about the
[53:29] message he needed somebody to tell him
[53:33] about the
[53:34] word he needed to have somebody tell him
[53:38] about
[53:39] jesusall but thank God that he had a
[53:43] friend who was in the
[53:46] message a friend who knew
[53:49] Jesus and that friend didn't keep Jesus
[53:53] uh to himself
[53:55] Jesus was not a secret in his back
[53:58] pocket but he said first of all he
[54:02] called his own brother Andrew called
[54:06] Peter and tell him come and see the
[54:09] Christ Hallelujah I got the word I seen
[54:14] the word I recognize the word and the
[54:17] things the word is doing is getting my
[54:20] faith growing stronger and stronger
[54:23] every
[54:24] dayen and you know Peter came we W talk
[54:28] about him the scripture is right there
[54:30] where he recognized and said I know Thou
[54:33] Art the Christ the son of the Living God
[54:36] but now Andrew didn't stop there and
[54:39] said praise God I done my bit I already
[54:42] witnessed I I just LED one person to
[54:45] Christ and and that's over I can relax
[54:49] now because I've done the part no every
[54:53] one of us have got to be wor working for
[54:55] the
[54:57] Lord every one of us has got to talk
[55:00] about the faith that is in us that's
[55:03] another part of your change I'm talking
[55:04] about there now amen so now here it is
[55:08] that he went and he told his another
[55:12] friend a friend he has for him some of
[55:15] us not even told our own family much
[55:18] less some of us haven't even told our
[55:20] own brother our own sister much less to
[55:23] talk about a friend others of us are
[55:25] ashamed we embarrassed we scared to tell
[55:29] the boss to tell your friends about it
[55:31] it's just how you do it you just wait on
[55:34] the holy spirit let him give you wisdom
[55:37] and guidance amen and you'll see how
[55:41] smoothly that word will slip in on them
[55:44] that's the way how Jesus is he'll just
[55:47] stand right beside you and wait until
[55:49] you ask him a question and then when he
[55:52] the way he answers the question
[55:54] recognize there's something back of that
[55:56] Veil Hallelujah there's something about
[55:58] that message that's different from just
[56:01] reading the Bible and not having any
[56:04] understanding
[56:05] amen so I want to encourage every one of
[56:09] you it's not what you think I don't
[56:12] think he will receive it I don't think
[56:14] she will receive it I don't think my
[56:16] mother will receive it when I went to my
[56:18] own parents at first as a young boy of
[56:21] about 16 and said to them I found the
[56:25] the word the message of the hour the
[56:28] prophet of this day and there's only one
[56:31] God and his name is Jesus Christ my
[56:34] parents said the boy is teaching us
[56:38] now the boy is teaching us now we taught
[56:41] him we were teaching him the Bible now
[56:44] he's teaching us amen but she went to
[56:47] bed and God has gave her that gift that
[56:49] she was one that gets visions and dreams
[56:53] and while she is there early ear in the
[56:55] morning she saw a vision of the Lord
[56:58] standing on a rock and the wind blowing
[57:01] his robes moving and hearing voices in
[57:04] the background singing and it was
[57:08] singing one verse of Jesus Keep Me Near
[57:12] The Cross that was long stricken out
[57:14] from the hymn they don't put it in the
[57:16] himm books when it goes on to say
[57:19] Jesus my God I Know Thy Name the thy
[57:25] name is all my trust she didn't need
[57:29] anything else she came jumping out of
[57:31] that bed woke up the whole house I got
[57:34] it I understand now it's Jesus he is God
[57:39] Jesus Is God he's God the Lord
[57:41] hallelujah praise God Amen I baptized
[57:46] them both in water not waiting for a
[57:49] nice uh baptism day we had a a a let me
[57:54] say and we call that a ditch in my
[57:56] country that's just about 10t across
[58:00] amen we call that a ditch that's not
[58:02] even a river but praise God but water
[58:05] was always flowing from the river in and
[58:07] out and they did not wait they don't
[58:10] want to wait the rap chicken come
[58:12] anytime so I baptized them in water in
[58:15] the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and
[58:18] they both lived and followed the word of
[58:20] God till the day they left and went to
[58:23] glory amen praise God but you see how
[58:26] important your testimony
[58:29] is you're telling somebody else ear
[58:34] because that is the command that was
[58:36] given to Adam when they came here God
[58:39] said what is your
[58:41] commission
[58:43] multiply and replenish yourself amen and
[58:47] that is our commission here today that
[58:49] we have to multiply ourselves we are not
[58:52] church goers we're not church pew
[58:56] warmers we are here as Believers we are
[58:59] here as Christians when they hit
[59:02] Jerusalem the Bible said the whole
[59:05] Jerusalem was turned upside down
[59:08] Hallelujah why there were on fire with
[59:11] the word of the Living God and God is
[59:14] asking us if this Revelation has really
[59:17] struck your heart you cannot sit still
[59:21] you've got to share it with somebody
[59:23] else amen and not just because I'm even
[59:25] telling you here today but you should be
[59:28] having that desire within your heart
[59:31] that that that you cannot keep this to
[59:33] yourself I don't care who the person is
[59:36] amen praise God oh my at 14 there was a
[59:40] accountant listening to the word of God
[59:43] hallelujah there were doctors there were
[59:45] all kinds of people high and low that
[59:47] were hearing the word of God Amen
[59:50] because we're caught up with the word
[59:52] and the spirit of Christ was upon us
[59:54] amen let that same Spirit be upon you in
[59:58] the name of Jesus Christ glory to God
[1:00:01] hallelujah amen yes sir I tell you
[1:00:05] Nathaniel's life was was
[1:00:09] changed when he answered the call and he
[1:00:13] came in contact with the Lord Jesus

[1:00:18] Jesus said oh yeah before philli called
[1:00:21] you uh Andrew called you I I saw you

[1:00:29] and he says Lord amen he recognized

[1:00:40] came out of churchianity he came out
[1:00:43] from under Traditions he came out from
[1:00:45] under the law and he came right into the
[1:00:48] word of that hour and God asked for the
[1:00:52] same thing today that when we have
[1:00:54] caught this revelation we enter with our
[1:00:57] whole hearts into the word of this hour

[1:02:56] the Holy Spirit tells you to do that you
[1:02:59] you start praying you preparing your
[1:03:01] heart amen who has to tell you to when
[1:03:03] to fast who has to tell you when to miss

[1:03:08] morning I don't want you to take any
[1:03:09] breakfast just turn up to the service
[1:03:12] there so that your spirit will be sharp
[1:03:14] able to receive the word who tells you
[1:03:15] to do that the holy spirit amen I maybe
[1:03:19] even talking to somebody that did that
[1:03:20] this morning and I don't know but the
[1:03:22] Holy Ghost knows what he's doing amen
[1:03:26] hallelujah praise God Amen yes sir oh I
[1:03:30] tell you that Daniel heard and he
[1:03:33] believed and he followed he followed why
[1:03:35] because now he's not following or coming
[1:03:38] because of Andrew's Faith yeah Andrew
[1:03:42] invited him but when he seen for himself
[1:03:45] he caught the Revelation and he
[1:03:48] following based on his own
[1:03:50] Revelation his own Revelation that he's
[1:03:54] following the word of the Living God
[1:03:56] hallelujah praise the Lord and as he
[1:03:59] followed the message Jesus Christ he
[1:04:03] began to change every sermon every
[1:04:06] message was changing him he didn't
[1:04:08] realize it but every message was
[1:04:10] changing him every message when you come
[1:04:13] into the house of God regardless of who
[1:04:15] is the minister there's really only one
[1:04:19] voice now the voice uses many ministers
[1:04:23] but it's one voice
[1:04:24] and all it's saying is to to to build us
[1:04:28] up into his stature that we might walk
[1:04:32] in the uh in the stature of Jesus Christ
[1:04:35] in the fullness of the word of God
[1:04:38] hallelujah so we must follow the message
[1:04:42] and as we follow the message we are in
[1:04:44] the process of being changed is that
[1:04:49] right I've said it through the years I
[1:04:51] mention it once more again saved

[1:04:57] saved and the Rapture is the total of
[1:05:01] your salvation amen you understand right

[1:05:05] saved from original sin you're being
[1:05:08] saved from uh your own sin they

[1:05:40] being changed and I know we are being
[1:05:43] changed you know really let me let let

[1:05:48] message yet so so bear with me and have
[1:05:51] some patience okay uh um we find out
[1:05:55] that we are being changed because God
[1:05:58] sent a prophet with a pillar of fire and
[1:06:01] I believe whenever I come into this into
[1:06:04] a a a service like this even when I get
[1:06:08] with a few individuals I can be just
[1:06:10] talking and at one point when I start
[1:06:13] talking I can sense the pillar of fire
[1:06:16] is Right nearby somewhere here praise
[1:06:19] the Lord and let me tell you something
[1:06:21] this is not
[1:06:23] imagination the pillar of fire is not
[1:06:25] some story we read in the Bible it's not

[1:06:30] the pillar of fire over brother bram's
[1:06:34] head let let me tell you the same Pillar
[1:06:36] of Fire is here with
[1:06:39] us look I was a young man by that time I
[1:06:44] was 18 years old and I never seen
[1:06:47] brother Brandon we read about brother
[1:06:49] Brandon but we never seen him we we
[1:06:51] never seen any Pillar of Fire but here
[1:06:54] we are one night around midnight talking
[1:06:56] about the message standing on a bridge
[1:06:59] with some bushes behind us out of that

[1:07:16] said do you see anything I didn't want
[1:07:18] him to be influenced but why what I was
[1:07:21] seeing because what I was seeing I could
[1:07:24] say the thoughts struck me they could
[1:07:26] you know they'll say you believe that
[1:07:29] message about Prophet with pfy that's
[1:07:31] why you're seeing that but we don't see

[1:20:23] the Holy Spirit can do that with you you
[1:20:26] believe that we could be so Anointed
[1:20:29] with the holy spirit that until God
[1:20:31] starts making your thoughts and your
[1:20:34] words begin to materialize even when you
[1:20:36] are not thinking because it's not you
[1:20:39] that's going to think that you're going

[1:21:00] thoughts then my thoughts become so real
[1:21:03] till they become words in my lips they
[1:21:06] materialize now I'm a Christian I'm a
[1:21:09] different person he spoke that in the
[1:21:11] word made flesh now listen here again
[1:21:15] now just the other
[1:21:19] night how can you make a pig believe is
[1:21:23] wrong eating
[1:21:28] slop How could a leopard change his

[1:21:48] want to try to reform yourself or do a
[1:21:52] little better better you got to be
[1:21:54] completely changed from the inside to
[1:21:57] the outside amen now get it right you
[1:22:02] must get it right inside at the
[1:22:06] beginning because you begin with a soul
[1:22:11] that was there there before the world
[1:22:14] was ever formed you heard what he said
[1:22:17] there you were there before the world
[1:22:21] was ever formed
[1:22:23] if you were an elected seed your soul
[1:22:27] was there in God before the world was
[1:22:31] ever
[1:22:33] formed Hallelujah now you get that right
[1:22:37] that what has to be born again that's
[1:22:41] what has got to be born again is that
[1:22:45] right so that seed that Soul has got to
[1:22:48] be born again now what he's talking
[1:22:51] about is that seed that soul that came
[1:22:54] was sent down here came down here get
[1:22:56] trapped in flesh and so it's got to be
[1:22:59] borned again praise the name of the Lord
[1:23:02] you find later we'll quote from the
[1:23:04] churches book where he says really only
[1:23:07] the elect could be born again the
[1:23:11] non-elect can't be born again there is
[1:23:14] no seed to be born again right praise
[1:23:18] the Lord oh my praise the Lord and if
[1:23:21] you get your Your Heart
[1:23:24] Right your intellectuals will move right
[1:23:28] along with it praise the Lord I want to
[1:23:31] move right along here quickly I'm
[1:23:34] talking about the soul change now
[1:23:37] through the years of this message there
[1:23:40] have been teachings of the Soul change
[1:23:45] in the form that you'll have two Souls
[1:23:49] not one but
[1:23:51] two and one will be the old soul and one
[1:23:55] will be the new soul I know what I'm
[1:23:58] saying now uh would sound controversial
[1:24:01] but when the spirit of God makes the
[1:24:04] thing clear and makes it right then it
[1:24:06] straightens everything and everybody
[1:24:09] amen praise the Lord and in actual fact
[1:24:14] this is what brother
[1:24:15] Bram
[1:24:17] said about the soul being the nature of
[1:24:21] the spirit
[1:24:23] he said that in let me give you the
[1:24:29] message for those who want to look it up
[1:24:31] you must be born again
[1:24:34] 1961 right he says that it's now he said
[1:24:38] it clearly the soul is the nature of the
[1:24:41] spirit right praise the Lord now and the
[1:24:45] two Soul Doctrine that's where it came
[1:24:47] from how many ever heard about the two
[1:24:49] Soul Doctrine okay if you never heard
[1:24:51] you're hearing now to be insulated so
[1:24:54] that you're insulated because he said
[1:24:57] now he says it's your soul that's been
[1:25:01] changed that your old soul died and the
[1:25:06] new Soul was born into you brother

[1:25:36] you were close to it but that's not it
[1:25:38] is this is this is this is this and

[1:30:20] day just what I was telling you in the
[1:30:22] early stages so you recognize the
[1:30:24] prophet is saying it here now too he's
[1:30:27] saying you are already

[1:31:23] raised up from sin we've been raised up
[1:31:26] from the dirt and the of the devil we've
[1:31:28] been raised up from the world into the
[1:31:31] presence of the word of God and of the
[1:31:33] holy spirit amen yes sir praise the Lord
[1:31:37] so this great mystery of our change to
[1:31:40] the Rapture it starts with the genuine
[1:31:44] Soul change or the changing of your soul
[1:31:49] amen praise the Lord
[1:31:52] listen again he's speaking
[1:31:54] 1965 now he's beginning to realize Rec

[1:32:15] husband must be dead your new husband is
[1:32:19] the word we'll speak about that a little
[1:32:21] bit more later but here it is he says
[1:32:24] now seven days seven days shall they eat
[1:32:29] on leav bread seven days what does that
[1:32:33] typify it tells you of the complete
[1:32:36] seven Church ages it tells you of the
[1:32:40] ending of that them seven days why they
[1:32:44] have to eat it seven days oh my they had
[1:32:47] to eat it before going out the whole
[1:32:51] church AG hallelujah oh my like Israel
[1:32:54] in Egypt they had to eat it and then
[1:32:57] they could go out so we have got the
[1:33:00] fullness we are in this last Church age

[1:33:06] accumulation of all that they have in
[1:33:08] the church Jus before us amen praise God
[1:33:13] so we are eating on all of them praise

[1:34:32] you were taking uh rituals and
[1:34:35] traditions and denominational teachings

[1:34:41] say there will produce what denomination

[1:48:00] they that Soul can break out of that
[1:48:03] prison that they were in but the other
[1:48:06] one is a still a soul imprisoned now it
[1:48:11] can't come out from there because it's
[1:48:13] the same original one under that sinful
[1:48:17] nature and it will continue to be under
[1:48:19] that sinful nature and never be able to
[1:48:22] come out from it amen oh praise God
[1:48:25] hallelujah yes sir oh my
[1:48:29] see the initial evidence of the Holy
[1:48:32] Ghost how people can live in the spirit
[1:48:36] dance in the spirit shout in the spirit
[1:48:40] they go to church in the spirit they can
[1:48:43] absolutely have the real spirit of God
[1:48:46] anointed on that spirit now listen close
[1:48:51] he's talking about that spirit that was
[1:48:53] permitted by God that worldly Spirit the
[1:48:57] devil was able to rest on every child
[1:49:00] born into this world right see see they
[1:49:04] can have God's spirit resting on that
[1:49:07] spirit and still be
[1:49:10] lost still be devil possessed as they
[1:49:14] can be with that Spirit oh my do you see
[1:49:19] how clear that is now because in the
[1:49:21] first place they can't they can't get
[1:49:24] rid of being
[1:49:27] imprisoned that spirit is already
[1:49:29] imprisoned only the elect that come here
[1:49:32] with a seed soul from God can receive
[1:49:36] the rising of the sun uh the Waters of
[1:49:40] the word and and break out of that
[1:49:43] prison that they were held in for the
[1:49:46] grace of God you see oh my see for the
[1:49:52] rain falls and the just and the unjust
[1:49:54] the same rain that made the grain of
[1:49:57] wheat grow makes a cocklebur grow the
[1:50:01] inside of that seed is a nature and the
[1:50:04] nature displays itself it can stand in
[1:50:07] the field right there with the weed amen
[1:50:10] and rejoice oh my but by their
[1:50:14] fruits you shall know them praise the
[1:50:18] name of the Lord hallelujah praise God
[1:50:22] are you willing to give me some more
[1:50:26] time ah praise the
[1:50:28] Lord I want you to see here this is the
[1:50:32] church age
[1:50:34] book uh page number I don't know but
[1:50:38] he's speaking here he says now that
[1:50:40] Bride is a literal spoken word seed
[1:50:45] bride do you believe
[1:50:47] that though she is feminine in Des
[1:50:50] designation she is called the body of
[1:50:54] Christ see it's apparent she ought to be
[1:50:58] called that for she was predestinated in
[1:51:02] him see came from the same Source
[1:51:06] Eternal with him and now manifesting God
[1:51:11] in a many membered body here see where
[1:51:15] once God was manifested in one member
[1:51:18] even our Lord Jesus Christ here we are
[1:51:21] coming to a conclusion amen praise the
[1:51:24] Lord I just going to move up a little
[1:51:26] further
[1:51:28] now we did not become seed by the
[1:51:32] rebirth we were seed therefore we were
[1:51:38] reborn Hallelujah in other words this
[1:51:41] stuff they tell you in the church that
[1:51:43] that you go and you get born again and
[1:51:45] then you become a child of
[1:51:47] God that's when you become a child of
[1:51:50] God when you go into the church and you
[1:51:52] repent and you get born again you become
[1:51:54] a child of God Prophet saying no no no
[1:51:58] you had to be a child of God from being
[1:52:01] part of him from before the foundations
[1:52:04] of the world and it's now open your eyes
[1:52:07] to recognize who you are where you come
[1:52:10] from who your father is and where you're
[1:52:14] going back to where your real home is
[1:52:17] our home is not on this Earth amen we
[1:52:20] are not from time we come from eternity
[1:52:23] we're going back to Eternity Sons and
[1:52:25] Daughters of the Living God Eternal
[1:52:28] beings that are now living in time to
[1:52:31] fulfill God's purpose and God's plan
[1:52:34] here upon the Earth thank we did not
[1:52:36] become seed by the rebirth we were seed
[1:52:41] therefore we were reborn for only the
[1:52:46] elect can be
[1:52:48] reborn amen
[1:52:50] because we were seen is the reason why
[1:52:54] we are quickened in the nonse there is
[1:52:58] nothing to Quicken amen oh my hold this
[1:53:02] carefully in your mind redeem means to
[1:53:05] buy back and you can read the rest for
[1:53:07] yourself it it begins to tell you there
[1:53:10] all about that praise God Mr
[1:53:13] buback only the true seed
[1:53:17] Eternal so this do that used to be
[1:53:21] taught of having two
[1:53:24] Souls because brother Bram talk qu have
[1:53:27] all those quotes and many of them which
[1:53:30] I didn't bother to read to you is not
[1:53:32] immaterial at this point if you choose
[1:53:35] to and you're a person that has to teach
[1:53:38] or preach you might want to check that
[1:53:40] out but we find out that we understand
[1:53:43] when the angel broke the Revelation to
[1:53:45] him that you come with one soul and that
[1:53:50] Soul come from God and that Soul can't
[1:53:55] die and you you don't get a New
[1:53:58] Soul it's the same soul that is in you
[1:54:03] but that Spirit nature that Satan put
[1:54:06] upon that soul to suppress it when you
[1:54:09] were born God sends the word and the
[1:54:14] word takes away the Gloom and the
[1:54:16] Darkness and rip the veil from off of
[1:54:19] you rips that evil thing from off of you
[1:54:22] lifts off that nature from off of you
[1:54:25] completely amen so that you can blossom
[1:54:29] and grow praise the name of the Lord
[1:54:31] hallelujah amen oh your soul changed
[1:54:35] didn't it so some say see it say you are
[1:54:39] clear your soul
[1:54:41] changed but the Holy Spirit at least
[1:54:44] that's what he he showed me he says what
[1:54:47] that was saying is not that it changed
[1:54:50] to a different soul but the condition of
[1:54:54] the Soul
[1:54:56] changed is that right the condition of
[1:55:00] the Soul change the CH it Remains the
[1:55:03] Same Soul not a new one but the
[1:55:07] condition Amen to another not a new or a
[1:55:12] different soul not the old man amen not
[1:55:17] the sinful Soul become a new man
[1:55:20] no sir that's not what it is the soul
[1:55:23] that sinth it shall die amen but your
[1:55:27] Original Seed Soul coming from the
[1:55:30] presence of God that cannot die amen
[1:55:34] that was covered up that was suppressed
[1:55:37] under the influence and nature of that
[1:55:41] worldly Spirit of Satan amen praise the
[1:55:44] name of the Lord let me let me I just I
[1:55:47] I just want to let you have what I wrote
[1:55:49] wrote here as this was coming to me but
[1:55:52] your original Eternal being woke up to
[1:55:56] the revelation of the word amen and was
[1:56:00] made new or Changed by the water of the
[1:56:04] word of God your whole outlook your
[1:56:07] whole uh mental your whole spiritual
[1:56:10] everything changed but it didn't change
[1:56:13] in the sense that you become a different
[1:56:15] being a new being you be it's the same
[1:56:19] person amen but you're Changed by the
[1:56:21] word of God in you amen praise the Lord
[1:56:25] you can look up these quotes where
[1:56:27] brother Brandon said you were never a
[1:56:29] pig turned into a
[1:56:34] lamb he uses terms like every species

[1:58:36] week went to this church to preach the
[1:58:41] word of God and when he went to the
[1:58:44] church where he was invited to go he
[1:58:47] went there and there was no church
[1:58:48] anymore more and then he stood in the
[1:58:52] street wanting to know oh Lord what
[1:58:55] should I do there was a Sunday morning I
[1:58:58] should be somewhere where can worship
[1:59:00] God what should I do and while he's
[1:59:04] thinking like that all of a sudden in
[1:59:05] the marketplace he heard a voice saying
[1:59:08] hello brother hello he turns around oh
[1:59:13] praise God he says one of the sisters
[1:59:15] from that old church and I recognized
[1:59:18] her and somehow in all that crowd she
[1:59:21] recognized me and I said praise the Lord
[1:59:24] sister said what happened to the church
[1:59:26] and she told me and and said where do
[1:59:28] you worship she said well you know I
[1:59:30] still believe the word but there's no
[1:59:33] place I could worship except there is an
[1:59:36] Apostolic Church they don't know
[1:59:38] anything else but one God and baptism in
[1:59:41] jesus' name but I said that's a better
[1:59:43] than anything so I started going there
[1:59:46] amen so he said well I go along with you
[1:59:49] this morning and I'll go worship
[1:59:52] there when he walked in and I told you
[1:59:57] about these kinds of things happening
[1:59:59] when he walked in it's an old preacher
[2:00:02] the old man got up he he says you you
[2:00:07] are here he says you're a preacher last
[2:00:11] night I I had a dream that I saw a
[2:00:14] stranger

[2:00:41] shocked and everything else he says but
[2:00:44] the supernatural just take over and I
[2:00:46] got up there and I start preaching the
[2:00:48] word of God and everything else and in
[2:00:51] the middle of the preaching the all
[2:00:53] preacher beside himself he says what you
[2:00:56] mean to say that's the truth that's the
[2:00:58] word of God and I never knew that oh my
[2:01:02] God and that man was beside himself and
[2:01:06] God took a hold of that church and rock
[2:01:09] it and shook it praise God and bring
[2:01:12] them people to the knowledge of the Lord
[2:01:14] Jesus Christ another message of this
[2:01:18] hour
[2:01:22] but that's not what I'm really that's a
[2:01:24] testimony that's just to let you know
[2:01:26] but the old man said oh praise God
[2:01:28] brother I just want you to come with me
[2:01:31] and I want you to come pray over the
[2:01:33] spot we bought the spot and we're going
[2:01:35] to build our our little church there so
[2:01:39] he took brother uh Desmond to pray over
[2:01:42] the spot he says brother
[2:01:45] Simon when he took me to the spot I
[2:01:48] started to ball I start to cry he says I
[2:01:53] start he says because there was the old
[2:01:57] mango tree that myself and my mother and
[2:02:01] my brother used to sit under when we did
[2:02:05] the farming and it was so hot and tired
[2:02:08] and we sit down on there to take some
[2:02:11] lunch there was the old mango tree and
[2:02:14] the spot this man by and brought to show
[2:02:17] me is the same spot that he
[2:02:20] bought
[2:02:23] Hallelujah who know about that only the
[2:02:26] god of Heaven could know something like
[2:02:28] that to bring us out of our spiritual
[2:02:31] Amnesia I said brother Desmond maybe you
[2:02:34] thought you were fully out of it but God
[2:02:36] absolutely like the prophet said will
[2:02:39] bring you back to some familiar places
[2:02:42] make you meet some familiar people
[2:02:44] familiar circumstances and all of a
[2:02:47] sudden your soul wakes sh and you
[2:02:49] recognize what is happening around you
[2:02:52] oh what a day we're living in brother
[2:02:55] sister oh thank God I'm so thankful amen
[2:02:59] praise the name of the Lord I'm glad
[2:03:01] friends that we are now passing through
[2:03:04] our own phase of that Amnesia but when
[2:03:07] the Rapture comes with all its fullness
[2:03:09] and I'm going to end this
[2:03:11] now Brothers could you come with the
[2:03:16] music I know I said a whole lot here
[2:03:22] here but when the Rapture comes Paul
[2:03:26] said then we shall
[2:03:30] know as we are
[2:03:32] known cuz right
[2:03:34] now we still seen through a glass
[2:03:38] Darkly right we seen through a glass
[2:03:41] Darkly but
[2:03:43] then face to face amen you think I'm
[2:03:47] seeing you face to face no Gabriel no am
[2:03:50] I seeing you face to face sh yes but you
[2:03:53] don't no I'm just I I'm just seeing the
[2:03:56] outward man the prophet said this man
[2:03:58] here this is Satan that's the one right
[2:04:02] that's your biggest enemy is this man on
[2:04:05] the outside right oh my but he said but
[2:04:09] what a glorious day that will be when we
[2:04:11] come together in the presence of God and
[2:04:14] we see each other face to face am amen
[2:04:19] I'll see you as you are supposed to be
[2:04:23] praise the name of the Lord I don't know
[2:04:25] if you're going to see me
[2:04:28] taller you can always have a
[2:04:33] wish I don't think so because we shall
[2:04:36] be known as we are known I trust the
[2:04:39] Lord bless you amen cuz what I tried to
[2:04:43] what the Holy Spirit not me but what the
[2:04:45] Holy Spirit has tried to do here at this
[2:04:48] time
[2:04:49] helping me to bring this
[2:04:52] message because this subject is a very
[2:04:56] and was a very controversial
[2:05:01] subject and most and many didn't
[2:05:05] understand fully what it was about and
[2:05:08] others were pressuring people that if
[2:05:11] you see this Revelation you you're not
[2:05:13] born again and so on all this type of
[2:05:16] thing and now we understand the opening
[2:05:19] of the word the holy spirit makes it all
[2:05:22] clear they were on to something but that
[2:05:25] wasn't it that was not the fullness of
[2:05:28] the word the fullness of the word comes
[2:05:30] now and let us know what it was that we
[2:05:34] come here as a seed soul of God and then
[2:05:38] Satan comes with his worldly Natural
[2:05:42] Spirit and put that spirit that nature
[2:05:46] of that Spirit on top of your soul
[2:05:49] because every child brother brandham
[2:05:51] said well good bad or whatever born
[2:05:55] because of how they were born in sin
[2:05:57] shapen and iniquity he God permit him to
[2:06:02] put that Spirit on every one of them one
[2:06:05] of us right but one had Redemption plan
[2:06:10] for them already one set had Redemption
[2:06:13] planned for them already and their names
[2:06:16] already on the book already God know
[2:06:18] know they're going back because he has a
[2:06:21] plan in progress the other ones Souls
[2:06:24] imprisoned now can't come out already
[2:06:28] trapped praise the Lord can't come out
[2:06:31] of it but one day the word would break
[2:06:36] and with Redemption we would be bought
[2:06:38] back and brought back to where we come
[2:06:41] from and we will recognize who we really
[2:06:44] are amen that we are not just every
[2:06:47] human being walking walking around
[2:06:49] doesn't mean we're all the same some are
[2:06:52] just Mortals and other ones are
[2:06:56] Immortals amen because this Mortal if
[2:06:59] you're elected will put on immortality
[2:07:02] will put on your real body is that right
[2:07:04] you put on your real body your word body
[2:07:07] you put it all on and you walk out of
[2:07:09] here in the grace of almighty God Amen
[2:07:12] praise God I hope it made sense to some
[2:07:14] of you at least and that you recognize
[2:07:17] what we're trying to say so somebody
[2:07:19] comes to you and raising up those uh
[2:07:23] kind of old doctrines that used to be
[2:07:25] there and raising it up now you know how
[2:07:27] to address it amen praise the Lord amen
[2:07:32] how many Souls do you have brother
[2:07:35] Brian one oh thank God so thank God you
[2:07:41] only have one praise the Lord so I can't
[2:07:45] go into too much more but the the old
[2:07:48] hus usand that he's talking about is
[2:07:50] that old sinful nature that Satan was
[2:07:54] allowed to put
[2:07:56] on Persons when they were born that's
[2:08:00] the old husband that he's talking about
[2:08:02] you divorce that when the word reveal
[2:08:05] itself to
[2:08:07] you and you are married to the sinless
[2:08:10] Son of God the revealed word for this
[2:08:13] hour by an invisible Union through Jesus
[2:08:16] Christ you see so wonderful these things
[2:08:19] used to be massive conventions of of uh
[2:08:24] altercations and Division and fighting
[2:08:27] and I don't not physical but spiritual
[2:08:30] fighting and quotations and everything
[2:08:33] else like that and hearing the other
[2:08:35] preacher saying sit down man I'll bury
[2:08:37] you with coats and yeah no no no those
[2:08:41] days are pass the holy spirit is opening
[2:08:44] up the word and saying look it's this
[2:08:47] simple
[2:08:49] is this simple if they had just waited
[2:08:52] because as the prophet said they will
[2:08:55] know when it is time for them to know
[2:08:59] amen is that right am sometimes we even
[2:09:02] tell our children that you will know
[2:09:05] when it's time for you to know it's not
[2:09:08] the time
[2:09:09] yet but you will know when it's time for
[2:09:11] you to know and you sitting here me now
[2:09:15] many things you may still have in your
[2:09:16] mind wondering about you will will know
