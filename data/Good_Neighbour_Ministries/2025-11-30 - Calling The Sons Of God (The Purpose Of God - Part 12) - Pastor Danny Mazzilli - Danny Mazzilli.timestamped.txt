[41:39] I'm a part of his word.
[41:44] It's a revelation
[41:46] [Music]
[41:52] on Calary
[41:55] died
[41:57] to redeem his lost bride.
[42:01] The King of Kings
[42:05] became my Savior.
[42:10] This is God's great mystery. Come on
[42:13] someone of love expressed to me
[42:18] that CHRIST
[42:23] have been made.
[42:27] Oh I am
[42:32] who I am.
[42:36] I can see now
[42:40] who I am.
[42:44] I'm a part of my savior.
[42:50] [Music]
[42:52] It's a revelation
[43:01] on Calary.
[43:03] He died. Thank you for that, Lord.
[43:06] his
[43:09] &gt;&gt; the king of kings.
[43:14] He became my savior.
[43:18] This is God's great mystery
[43:22] of love expressed to me
[43:31] might be made one.
[43:34] Oh,
[43:36] I am Lord. Come ahead with me.
[43:45] [Music]
[43:56] I'm a part of his
[44:07] one more time.
[44:18] [Applause]
[44:35] It's
[44:40] who I am.
[44:47] Amen.
[44:49] Praise God. Hallelujah.
[44:53] Thank you, saints. Thank you, musicians.
[44:55] Praise God. Welcome everybody into the
[44:58] house of the Lord this morning. Amen.
[45:01] Glory to God. We're so glad to be here
[45:04] this morning. I feel an atmosphere in
[45:06] this place.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, praise God. I'll tell
[45:11] you, you know, you had to break through
[45:13] a little bit of the battle to get here
[45:15] and the enemy tried to raise up a storm,
[45:17] but you know what? He's just a bluff
[45:20] anyway.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Praise God. God wants his sons and
[45:23] daughters to gather. He makes a way.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm grateful. And you should
[45:28] pat yourself on the back this morning
[45:30] that you you press through. Now, there's
[45:32] some saints that are like two hours
[45:33] away, okay? They called and they let me
[45:36] know they wouldn't be here and stuff
[45:37] like that. And I said, "Absolutely." I
[45:39] said, you know, the weather's going to
[45:40] kind of pick up again maybe and you
[45:43] know, they're further away. And so they
[45:45] they said, uh, it'd be safer. And I
[45:48] said, absolutely. So, praise God. But,
[45:50] uh, we're so happy that that you all
[45:52] could make it here this morning.
[45:55] And, uh, I'm, uh, I'm especially blessed
[45:58] this morning to have my nephew, uh,
[46:00] Christian
[46:02] Mazili
[46:05] with us this morning.
[46:07] I was so uh blessed to hear from him a
[46:10] couple of weeks ago and sent me a text
[46:12] message and he says uh you know I
[46:14] listened to the message and uh you know
[46:17] I was blessed and you know I said wow I
[46:19] said wonderful wonderful I'm so happy to
[46:22] hear that uh Christian is my my brother
[46:24] Lenny a lot of you know my brother Len
[46:27] um his eldest son and uh you know
[46:30] Christian um you know he was uh uh in
[46:35] modeling for many years. Okay. He had a
[46:38] like a like a a real career. You know,
[46:41] I'd go to the malls. I'd be at like the
[46:43] big malls at Square One and, you know,
[46:45] downtown and I'd see these huge
[46:48] billboards of my nephew, you know, and
[46:50] and in these different stores and, you
[46:52] know, I'd walk in there and I'd see the
[46:54] people at the desk and, you know, young
[46:56] ladies. I go, "That's my nephew." They
[46:57] go, "What? Can can you give me his
[47:00] number?" I said, "No."
[47:03] And then, you know, a few years ago,
[47:05] probably five, six years ago, I heard
[47:06] that Christian was uh um moving into the
[47:09] uh farming,
[47:11] you know, and and I said, "Wow, that's
[47:15] that's an extreme." You know, he went
[47:17] from from like he had a career where he
[47:19] was booked. He was he was going
[47:21] different places around the world doing
[47:23] what he was doing. He was being called
[47:25] by big companies. But something inside
[47:28] him drew him to farming and here he is
[47:32] today and he's a self-sufficient farmer.
[47:34] He um he raises cattle, he raises uh
[47:37] pork, chickens, um you know uh he
[47:41] supplies to many people now. Um he has
[47:44] customers, you know, right throughout
[47:46] the province here that he serves. I buy
[47:48] his meats and they're fantastic and his
[47:51] eggs and and uh chickens and wow, you
[47:55] know. So, um I'm just very very blessed
[47:59] to um to have you here today, Christian.
[48:02] So, uh God bless you. I trust that the
[48:04] word of God will uh do something. And uh
[48:07] we're all here for the same purpose.
[48:09] Amen.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're here, you know, because
[48:12] we're a strange kind of people. Call it
[48:15] what you want, okay? But um you know,
[48:17] we're we're we're not like uh you know,
[48:20] like the rest of the world when it comes
[48:21] to Christianity, right? There's there's
[48:24] a mystery of God that has been unveiled
[48:27] to us that makes us peculiar. Um all of
[48:31] a sudden we understand that you know
[48:34] that uh we become a part of this mystery
[48:37] that we were you know that we weren't
[48:39] just regular people like all of a sudden
[48:42] you know when the word of God came to us
[48:45] at a certain time and season because we
[48:47] can all look back and you can always
[48:49] look back into the scriptures. God has a
[48:51] time and a season to unveil himself to
[48:56] whom he chooses. You know, that's the
[48:59] one thing about God that we need to
[49:00] understand, right? Is that that we
[49:03] didn't choose him. We weren't searching
[49:06] for him.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; A lot of people, oh, I gave my heart to
[49:09] the Lord. No, he was searching you out.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you if you're a son or a
[49:16] daughter of God, it's like what we've
[49:18] been ministering on for the last three
[49:20] months here, okay? On the adoption of
[49:23] sons of God. If you're a son of God and
[49:27] God is eternal, God had no beginning and
[49:31] no end. That means you an expressed son
[49:34] cannot have a beginning.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; You were always a son.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; It's just that we come into this
[49:40] dimension here and we go through what's
[49:42] called spiritual amnesia. And then God
[49:44] awakens us one day. You know, he chose
[49:47] to do it when I was 33 years old. He
[49:49] chose to do it for you when you were
[49:51] whatever. Some younger, some older. It's
[49:55] it's all his time in all his season. We
[49:57] can't we can't fathom God's plan, but he
[50:00] had a plan from the beginning.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is the element that we
[50:04] need to realize that, you know, if we
[50:06] come into that plan and all of a sudden
[50:08] we start to see things different than
[50:11] how the rest of the world sees it, it's
[50:14] because something's been revealed to you
[50:17] &gt;&gt; to see it differently. Amen. And there's
[50:19] a mystery that was under every
[50:21] dispensation. And that's why you go back
[50:24] into the Old Testament, you'll see that,
[50:26] you know, David all of a sudden, you
[50:28] know, who was one of uh, you know, the
[50:30] sons of Jesse. Uh, God sends Samuel to
[50:33] anoint a new king over Israel. David had
[50:36] no idea that he was actually going to be
[50:39] the king of Israel. He was just a
[50:41] shepherd. He was shephering sheep in the
[50:43] field. And, you know, and one day, you
[50:46] know, God's prophet shows up to Jesse's
[50:48] place and says, "God says there's a king
[50:50] in this house.
[50:52] just like he did to you and me. Like you
[50:54] know there's a son in this home, in this
[50:57] family,
[50:58] &gt;&gt; in this group here,
[51:00] &gt;&gt; in this city over here.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm coming to anoint him."
[51:04] &gt;&gt; And you know, and so David had no idea
[51:07] that he had representation
[51:09] as a son of God to be a king. But God
[51:13] saw him and and sent his prophet. And
[51:16] when he sent the word,
[51:19] he anointed him with the oil, which is
[51:21] the word of God, which is the Holy
[51:23] Ghost. Amen. When the Holy Ghost comes
[51:25] upon an individual, it awakens something
[51:28] inside them to recognize that they're
[51:30] not who they thought they were, but
[51:33] they're actually a son of God.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. For the purpose of God. And so,
[51:37] I'm already starting to preach. But
[51:40] anyways, this is the thing. And you
[51:42] know, uh, too many people are living
[51:43] under the wrong dispensation. And that's
[51:45] why to be living under just what's known
[51:48] today as Christianity and belong to a
[51:50] church and go to church and fall asleep
[51:54] uh you know leave the same way you
[51:56] entered in you know um that's you you're
[52:00] not hearing the word
[52:01] &gt;&gt; because when faith comes it changes you
[52:04] &gt;&gt; there's a change in your life and people
[52:07] know it
[52:08] &gt;&gt; they know that there's a change. Amen.
[52:10] Praise God. So we don't want to hold to
[52:12] traditions. We don't want to be held
[52:14] under uh traditions of man like when
[52:16] Jesus came to the earth and he's talking
[52:19] to the priests of that day, all the high
[52:21] priests. Imagine here's the word made
[52:24] flesh, God in human form talking to the
[52:27] priests of that day. Go back and read it
[52:29] in St. John chapter 6. And he's telling
[52:32] them and they're saying, you know, the
[52:34] priests are saying, "We are the sons,
[52:36] the children of Abraham. We would
[52:38] recognize that, you know, if you were
[52:40] the Messiah." they were actually they
[52:42] didn't believe that he was God. He says
[52:44] if you were the children of Abraham, you
[52:48] would know me.
[52:51] Okay? And so so understanding that
[52:54] there's something that's in you to
[52:56] recognize the word. Amen. And because
[52:59] their traditions have had made God such,
[53:03] you know, the way man wants to, you
[53:04] know, they want you to do the rosary and
[53:07] they want you to do all these different
[53:09] traditions of man and you can go to this
[53:11] church and they'll give you this
[53:12] teaching, that teaching. This is not a
[53:14] church with with with teaching. This is
[53:17] a church that's anointed by the Holy
[53:20] Ghost.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. To bring the word of God. And so
[53:23] this is what we're under um this great
[53:25] mystery. So, um, let's go to the word of
[53:28] God. I'm sorry to keep you standing so
[53:30] long. We're going to go and we're going
[53:32] to continue, um, where we sort of left
[53:34] off last week. Amen. We've been on this
[53:37] series of being called unto adoption.
[53:39] We're at part 12 now. Uh, today um, we
[53:43] want to look at calling of the sons of
[53:46] God. calling sons of God because this is
[53:50] this is all part of the whole process of
[53:52] what God is doing by the word in our
[53:55] day. The word is calling us to our
[53:58] place. Adoption is about placing sons
[54:02] into their rightful positions. You came
[54:04] into this world and you thought this is
[54:06] what your life was going to be. But God
[54:08] had a different plan for you. And this
[54:11] is what the word does. It it changes
[54:14] your position as to what you thought you
[54:17] were into what you are today. Let's look
[54:19] at our scripture in the in Colossians.
[54:21] We read this scripture last week. It
[54:24] says here, let's just pray quickly.
[54:26] Father, we just commit this now, this
[54:29] portion of the service where we look
[54:32] into your word and we allow your spirit
[54:34] to come and and take control of the
[54:37] word. Lord, anoint the speaker, anoint
[54:39] the hearers. Let the let the uh let us
[54:42] move together into heavenly places where
[54:45] your word just becomes alive to us and
[54:49] becomes more real. Father, grant it. We
[54:51] pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[54:55] Whereof I am made a minister according
[54:58] to the dispensation of God which is
[55:01] given to me for you to fulfill the word
[55:06] of God. Just what I was just commenting
[55:09] on. This is a different dispensation and
[55:12] to each minister under that dispensation
[55:16] is given a portion of the word that they
[55:19] will bring to the people. Amen. Now, I'm
[55:22] not the only minister. They're all over
[55:24] the world, but they've come under this
[55:27] anointing of the spirit of God. even the
[55:30] mystery which hath been hid from ages
[55:34] and from generations.
[55:38] So this is this is something that God is
[55:40] revealing now that was not available
[55:43] generations, not even in the time when
[55:45] David was king.
[55:47] This mystery that we're feasting on now,
[55:50] which brings us into our rightful
[55:52] positions as sons of God, was not
[55:55] available then. Why? because Christ had
[55:58] to go to the cross in order to give his
[56:01] life so that his life which is God's
[56:05] life could come unto the sons of God by
[56:09] the Holy Ghost. That's why Jesus says if
[56:11] I don't go you can't come.
[56:15] And so here now he says, "But now is
[56:18] made manifest to the saints to whom God
[56:21] would make known what is the riches of
[56:23] the glory of this mystery among the
[56:27] Gentiles which pay attention now which
[56:31] is Christ in you
[56:35] &gt;&gt; the hope of glory. God bless you. May be
[56:38] seated."
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. What a wonderful
[56:42] revelation God has unveiled in these
[56:46] last days to the children of God that
[56:49] would give us something that would
[56:52] inspire us to actually serve God to be
[56:56] inspired to to uh you know be uh uh a
[57:01] witness in this hour a reality of
[57:05] Christianity. Not just some oh I go to
[57:08] this church or I go to that church and
[57:11] you know arguing over this doctrine and
[57:13] over that doctrine. We are way down the
[57:16] road saints from arguing about who is
[57:20] right and who is wrong. We're not here
[57:23] to to you know to to tell who's right
[57:26] and who's wrong. We're here to bring the
[57:29] word of God. And when the spirit of God
[57:32] comes forth through through the
[57:35] preaching of the word, sons and
[57:37] daughters of God will hear the word and
[57:40] recognize the word and it'll put them
[57:43] into action
[57:44] &gt;&gt; to actually live the word for their day.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what true Christianity is
[57:50] all about. To be Christlike means to
[57:53] have the spirit of God in you. That's
[57:57] what the scripture says. That's what the
[57:59] great, you know, the riches of the glory
[58:01] of this mystery among the Gentiles. And
[58:03] then he goes and says it right clear
[58:05] which is Christ in you. And people go to
[58:08] church, they don't understand. I I asked
[58:10] people, I said, "Have you received the
[58:11] Holy Ghost since you believe?" Because I
[58:14] see you go to church. I see you, you
[58:17] know, praising God and and you know,
[58:19] like, but have you received the word for
[58:23] your day, which is the Holy Ghost? And
[58:25] they they don't understand that. They
[58:27] don't understand what the Holy Ghost is.
[58:29] But it's very clear in the scripture.
[58:32] Jesus says, "I will send you the
[58:35] comforter,
[58:37] which is the Holy Ghost,
[58:40] the Holy Spirit, and he will guide you
[58:44] to truth."
[58:46] &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; So when somebody has the Holy Ghost, it
[58:51] guides them to the truth because the
[58:53] Holy Ghost is the word. It's God. It
[58:57] can't go against the word. That's why I
[58:59] asked somebody. I said, "So, you were
[59:00] baptized in water in the name of the
[59:03] Lord Jesus Christ?" They said, "No." I
[59:06] said, "Well, how are you baptized?" They
[59:08] said, "Oh, I got baptized as a baby." I
[59:11] said, "No." Well, I said, "That's fine,
[59:14] you know, but can I tell you what Jesus
[59:17] said?" He said, "He that believeth
[59:21] and is baptized
[59:23] shall be saved."
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. How does a baby believe? Well, my
[59:28] parents are Catholic and you know that's
[59:30] what I did so I'm okay. No, you're not.
[59:34] Unfortunately, that's not what the Holy
[59:37] Ghost
[59:38] in the word wrote. Because I can show
[59:40] you Acts chapter 2:38 where everybody
[59:44] that received the Holy Ghost in the on
[59:48] the day of Pentecost when when Peter who
[59:51] was present there when Jesus says, "Go
[59:53] ye into all the world baptizing."
[59:56] Peter was right there when the people
[59:58] asked him, "What do we do to get saved?"
[1:00:00] He says, "Repent every one of you and be
[1:00:02] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:06] Christ
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; for the remission of your sin." In other
[1:00:09] words, you get buried your your your old
[1:00:12] life gets buried into the water and it
[1:00:15] comes up brand new and that's the new
[1:00:18] birth. It's not some harrishna and you
[1:00:21] start dancing and singing. No, you're
[1:00:23] just you're the same person, but now
[1:00:25] you've had this awakening of a new birth
[1:00:28] within your life. Amen. Praise God. And
[1:00:31] it changes your entire life. All of a
[1:00:34] sudden, now the Holy Ghost, which is God
[1:00:36] in you, Christ in you, has a different
[1:00:39] purpose than what your purpose was.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; You start to have different desires. You
[1:00:45] start to read your Bible. You start to
[1:00:48] listen to the word. You start to read
[1:00:49] the word. And all of a sudden, where
[1:00:51] before I remember, I'd pick up the Bible
[1:00:53] and I'd fall asleep after one paragraph,
[1:00:56] now I pick up the word, I read it, and
[1:00:58] it becomes alive.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; It It speaks to my heart. It It unveils
[1:01:03] things that I never understood before.
[1:01:05] Why? Because it takes the Holy Ghost to
[1:01:08] interpret his own word.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; That's why you cannot force somebody to
[1:01:13] believe this.
[1:01:14] It took me a long time to realize when I
[1:01:16] first came to the Lord, I try to convert
[1:01:18] the whole family, the whole the whole
[1:01:20] Ontario food terminal. And then I come
[1:01:22] to realize, wait a minute here. This is
[1:01:25] not something that I can give to
[1:01:27] anybody. The only thing I can do is just
[1:01:30] live it,
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; experience it,
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; allow it to to manifest in my life. So
[1:01:35] that that you know that that if in my
[1:01:37] testimony and sharing it with somebody,
[1:01:40] God would speak to them. And if there's
[1:01:42] representation there,
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; because there's there's an attribute,
[1:01:46] remember that's the that's the son of
[1:01:48] God that you always were. If it's if
[1:01:51] it's locked up in this clay and it needs
[1:01:54] to be awakened, the word will awaken it
[1:01:56] in its time and season.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; And so this is the element that, you
[1:02:03] know, um, we experience as sons of God.
[1:02:06] So I want to read a quote here from
[1:02:09] William Brham. um you know in Christ the
[1:02:12] mystery of God revealed
[1:02:15] this that we're talking about that we've
[1:02:17] been talking about over the last
[1:02:21] three months it's all surrounding this
[1:02:24] okay the mystery of God but we're not
[1:02:27] going to make it complicated we want to
[1:02:29] make it as simple as possible so that
[1:02:30] you can see Christ
[1:02:34] is the mystery of God revealed 1963 he
[1:02:37] says now God had a purpose and a hidden
[1:02:40] mystery
[1:02:41] And that's what I want to speak on to
[1:02:43] the church this morning. The hidden
[1:02:45] mystery of God that he had in his mind
[1:02:49] before the world ever began and how that
[1:02:52] it's unfolded itself right down to this
[1:02:56] present hour that we're living in. So
[1:02:59] when you're reading this, bring it to
[1:03:01] today. All right? See, then you will
[1:03:05] understand clearly then you uh you you
[1:03:08] will understand clearly then you see I
[1:03:12] believe what is being done. God's great
[1:03:15] mystery of how it's a secret. He kept it
[1:03:19] a secret. Nobody knowed nothing about
[1:03:22] it. What he's talking about is about God
[1:03:26] in the beginning. He had his own
[1:03:29] thoughts that he was going to express
[1:03:33] because he had a desire to be God on
[1:03:36] earth.
[1:03:38] God and man united together. That was
[1:03:42] his desire.
[1:03:44] God and man becoming one so that they
[1:03:48] could have dominion on the earth. This
[1:03:51] was his original plan. This is still his
[1:03:55] plan. He's going to fulfill it when we
[1:03:58] go from this dispensation into the
[1:04:00] millennium
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; for 1,000 years of peace on earth. And
[1:04:06] the Bible says that the lamb and his
[1:04:09] wife are going to rule in that thousand
[1:04:12] years of peace. Rule meaning not that
[1:04:14] they're going to rule and bind, you
[1:04:17] know, uh, evil and this. There's not
[1:04:19] going to be any evil because evil is
[1:04:23] going to be bound up by chains of
[1:04:26] circumstance.
[1:04:27] All right? It's circumstance that holds
[1:04:31] people into the conditions that they're
[1:04:34] presently in. It's certain teachings and
[1:04:37] certain uh traditions and and it becomes
[1:04:40] like a circumstance that holds them into
[1:04:42] a certain understanding of the word of
[1:04:45] God that leads them away from God. But
[1:04:50] it's a consciousness and a and a and an
[1:04:52] understanding of God in you and
[1:04:56] receiving the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:04:58] in your life that places you into the
[1:05:00] circumstances that lead you to sunship.
[1:05:05] as a son or daughter of God. That's why
[1:05:08] people are are bound by their own
[1:05:10] circumstances.
[1:05:12] They're bound by their belief in the
[1:05:14] word or disbelief in the word. When you
[1:05:17] believe the word, Jesus said, "All
[1:05:19] things are possible."
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; When you reject the word and you deny
[1:05:24] the word and you you're not willing to
[1:05:26] accept the word, then you are an element
[1:05:29] of circumstance. you become subject to
[1:05:33] the teachings of the world. All of a
[1:05:35] sudden, new age movement thought comes
[1:05:37] along. Oh, that sounds interesting. I
[1:05:39] think I'll adopt that. Or Jehovah
[1:05:41] witness. Oh, I think I'll adopt that.
[1:05:44] But a son or a daughter of God, they
[1:05:46] only hear the word. That's the only
[1:05:50] thing that catches them. It's the
[1:05:52] authenticity of God. It's it's it's
[1:05:55] common sense. It's an understanding
[1:05:58] where they when they read the word, they
[1:05:59] they they they believe it. They actually
[1:06:02] believe the word first and then they
[1:06:05] allow God to confirm what they're
[1:06:07] believing.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; That's how that's how the attribute is
[1:06:11] designed. You know that the attribute of
[1:06:13] God, the seed of God cannot disbelieve
[1:06:16] God's word.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; It can't.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; This can disbelieve God's word.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; That's why you struggle with this. It's
[1:06:23] it's it's your greatest enemy. It'll
[1:06:26] fight you to come to church. It'll fight
[1:06:27] you to stop to read your Bible. It'll
[1:06:30] stop you from listening to to to the
[1:06:32] services.
[1:06:34] But the attribute which is God in you,
[1:06:37] it desires the word.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's let's move along here. So
[1:06:44] next slide. He goes on and he says, even
[1:06:47] the angels, we're going to be looking
[1:06:49] into this now. Even the angels didn't
[1:06:51] understand it. See, he didn't reveal it.
[1:06:55] That's the reason under the seventh
[1:06:57] mystery. When the seventh seal was
[1:07:00] opened, there was silence in heaven.
[1:07:03] Revelations
[1:07:04] 8 verse 1. That when the seventh seal
[1:07:08] was open, there was silence in heaven.
[1:07:11] Why was there silence in heaven? when
[1:07:14] when when when before the seals were
[1:07:16] open, there was praising, worshiping,
[1:07:19] the cherubims were rejoicing because God
[1:07:22] was sitting on his throne. But when the
[1:07:25] seventh seal was open, which which is
[1:07:28] very important for us to understand, and
[1:07:30] we're going to be looking at that a
[1:07:31] little deeper as we go along here,
[1:07:34] understanding the ministry of William
[1:07:36] Branham. Very important. You know,
[1:07:39] people say, "Oh, I'm a Lutheran." I say,
[1:07:41] "Oh, Martin Luther." Yeah, you
[1:07:43] understand what Martin Oh, yeah. Martin
[1:07:45] Luther, he broke away from the Catholic
[1:07:47] Church back in the 1700s, you know, and
[1:07:50] or 1500s, you know, and he broke away
[1:07:52] from the Catholic Church and and and you
[1:07:54] know, his teachings. And today, you've
[1:07:55] got Lutheran churches all over the
[1:07:57] world. They're Martin Luther's
[1:07:59] teachings. And then Wesley, you know,
[1:08:01] later on in the 1700s, God gave him a
[1:08:04] revelation to take because you've heard
[1:08:06] of the Reformation. That's why that's
[1:08:08] why you've got the Catholic system and
[1:08:10] you've got the Protestant system because
[1:08:12] Luther was was the start of the
[1:08:15] Protestant restoration
[1:08:17] bringing the people back to the word
[1:08:19] again. And so Wesley, John Wesley,
[1:08:22] everybody know Presbyterian churches,
[1:08:24] they're all over the world. You talk
[1:08:25] about John Wesley, everybody knows
[1:08:26] there's a statue of him in England. I
[1:08:28] stood right next to his statue, took a
[1:08:30] picture with, you know, with his statue
[1:08:32] because I recognize
[1:08:34] his part in the word.
[1:08:37] I saw what God used him as a messenger,
[1:08:40] as an angel to bring a portion of the
[1:08:44] word so that we could come to the day
[1:08:46] that we're in. And then Pentecost broke
[1:08:48] out in the 19 early 1900s where the
[1:08:51] speaking in tongues and and and and you
[1:08:54] know the gifts of the spirit because God
[1:08:56] was restoring his word. Justification
[1:08:59] broke away from the Catholic Church.
[1:09:01] What was Luther's message? The just
[1:09:02] shall live by faith.
[1:09:05] In other words, I need my own
[1:09:07] relationship with God. How come I got to
[1:09:08] go to a a priest and he's got to and I
[1:09:11] got to confess my sins to him? No. The
[1:09:14] Bible says, "Confess your sins one one
[1:09:16] to another,
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; but before God,
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; not before man."
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so Luther had that
[1:09:26] revelation and understanding that he
[1:09:28] needed that people would have to have
[1:09:30] their own
[1:09:32] experience and personal
[1:09:35] relationship with God.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; But he was still drinking, smoking,
[1:09:40] cheating,
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; you know, because he was he was just,
[1:09:43] you know, a man that was, you know,
[1:09:45] maybe well the people, you know, maybe
[1:09:48] Luther, he he was more consecrated. We
[1:09:51] don't know. I don't go into all his, you
[1:09:53] know, detailed history. But Wesley comes
[1:09:56] along and brings a revelation on
[1:09:58] sanctification. You've got to live a
[1:09:59] sanctified, you got to have a life
[1:10:01] that's kind of, you know, expressing
[1:10:03] that God is a reality in your life.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; You can't be fbombing here and, you
[1:10:08] know, this and that and and claiming
[1:10:10] Christianity. It's not what goes in that
[1:10:12] defiles a man. It's what comes out that
[1:10:14] defileth the man. Right?
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; And so, so, you know, he had this
[1:10:18] understanding. And so William Brham now
[1:10:22] was the messenger to the Pentecostal age
[1:10:26] who was the one that would actually
[1:10:28] bring a revelation of restoration of the
[1:10:32] faith of the children back to the faith
[1:10:35] of the fathers bring bringing us back to
[1:10:37] the word.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; He was a prophet.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; He had a prophetic ministry.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; And we're going to look at that a little
[1:10:44] bit deeper so that we can understand the
[1:10:46] importance of that ministry. We we we
[1:10:49] have to acknowledge the age and the
[1:10:52] messenger to our age.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; It was G Jesus was the messenger to the
[1:10:57] age when he came to the earth.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; He was the actual messenger. But how
[1:11:01] many actually recognized them?
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; A dozen.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; There wasn't many that they followed him
[1:11:06] when he did the signs and wonders and
[1:11:08] when he when he would heal the sick and
[1:11:10] everything else, but when he when he
[1:11:11] said, "Unless you eat my body and drink
[1:11:14] my blood, you have no part of me."
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; What? All of a sudden, you see, they had
[1:11:19] no understanding what he was talking
[1:11:21] about. Unless you eat my body, which the
[1:11:24] my body is the word, the word
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; and my blood, which is the spirit,
[1:11:29] receive the Holy Ghost, you'll have no
[1:11:31] part of him.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Unless you're a part of his body and
[1:11:34] you're willing to take and eat his body,
[1:11:36] which is eat the word.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; You have no part of him.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; And the people couldn't understand that.
[1:11:44] And that's why the messenger to each age
[1:11:48] is vitally important to the people so
[1:11:52] that they know what God is doing in
[1:11:54] their day.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; That's the element that we must
[1:11:58] understand. And that's why we don't
[1:12:01] follow a man. We're not a cult. We don't
[1:12:03] we don't we don't worship William
[1:12:05] Branham.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Do you see people worshiping John Martin
[1:12:09] Luther? No. You don't see people
[1:12:12] worshiping Wesley and you know this and
[1:12:15] that. But people, you know, they don't
[1:12:18] understand that we've recognized the
[1:12:20] messenger to our age
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; that has given us a restored word. And
[1:12:25] more importantly, as John the Baptist
[1:12:28] was to introduce the first coming of
[1:12:31] Jesus Christ under an Elijah ministry,
[1:12:34] William Branham had an Elijah ministry
[1:12:37] to introduce the second coming of the
[1:12:41] Lord Jesus Christ. A lot of people are
[1:12:43] still waiting on his coming, but he's
[1:12:45] already come.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; This is very important. I know this is a
[1:12:50] this is a a profound statement. You mean
[1:12:53] he's already come? People are waiting to
[1:12:55] see him in the clouds. No, he's already
[1:12:57] come.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; He's come to redeem his sons and
[1:13:01] daughters.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; He's here by the word of God, living in
[1:13:05] a five-fold ministry of ministers that
[1:13:07] are all over the world that he's
[1:13:09] anointed to speak his word.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Not traditions, not teachings of man,
[1:13:15] not you got to do this, you got to do
[1:13:17] that. No, his word. You are my word. and
[1:13:21] and and the deep will respond. If
[1:13:24] there's an attribute of God, which is
[1:13:26] his word in you, that word has to unite.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; It's got to come to the word.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; It can't it can't you can't miss it.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; But it's very few. It's always been a
[1:13:38] few. Remember that. Don't don't think
[1:13:40] Listen, the fact that you're in a
[1:13:42] minority
[1:13:44] is exactly in line with how it's always
[1:13:47] been. So don't be looking for, oh, I go
[1:13:49] to a church with 10,000 people. They
[1:13:51] must have the truth. You show me. If
[1:13:55] it's not true that, you know, birds of a
[1:13:57] feather flock together and people will
[1:14:00] follow because there's a crowd, people
[1:14:02] will follow the crowd thinking that they
[1:14:05] actually have it. Let me tell you, it's
[1:14:07] always been the opposite. When Jesus was
[1:14:10] walking with 12 disciples and the crowd
[1:14:13] of 5,000 that had just been fed left to
[1:14:16] go home because now their bellies were
[1:14:18] full.
[1:14:20] The disciples looked at Jesus and they
[1:14:22] looked the other way. They said, "Lord,
[1:14:26] they're all leaving."
[1:14:29] He says, "What's going on?"
[1:14:32] Jesus says, "Unto you it has been
[1:14:36] given." Read the scripture to know the
[1:14:38] mysteries of the kingdom.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; But look what he says. But unto them it
[1:14:43] has not been given.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Now, not people are going to be saved,
[1:14:49] okay? Because they believe in the Lord
[1:14:51] Jesus. Don't get me wrong here. I'm not
[1:14:53] saying we're the only people that are
[1:14:55] going to be saved. No.
[1:14:57] God has sons and daughters and then
[1:15:00] there's people that are going to live
[1:15:02] outside the kingdom
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; that are going to accept Christ because
[1:15:06] God so loved the world that he gave his
[1:15:09] only begotten son that whosoever would
[1:15:11] believe that's why I if you can just get
[1:15:14] somebody to accept Christ
[1:15:17] that they're going to live a better life
[1:15:18] and they're going to have a better
[1:15:19] future.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; But sons and daughters of God are
[1:15:24] eternal. They have a different part in
[1:15:28] the word. They have a different placing
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; on earth. There's only one queen.
[1:15:36] There's a king and there's a queen.
[1:15:39] There was Adam and there was Eve in the
[1:15:41] garden in the beginning. Remember, we
[1:15:44] are playing out what was already in the
[1:15:46] mind of God. What he desired from the
[1:15:48] beginning. When he placed Adam in the
[1:15:50] garden, he placed them. He says, "And he
[1:15:53] called he made them in his image, which
[1:15:55] was God.
[1:15:57] And he called and he made them male and
[1:16:00] female and called their name Adam." It
[1:16:05] wasn't until Eve was taken from Adam's
[1:16:08] side that God took from the dust of the
[1:16:11] earth and created a body for Eve and for
[1:16:16] Adam. Now that they become living souls,
[1:16:19] that they became two. But Eve was in
[1:16:23] Adam. They were one. Their name was
[1:16:26] Adam. That's why if you're a son or a
[1:16:28] daughter of God, it's because you are a
[1:16:32] a part of the body of Christ.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; You're the second Adam.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; But you're expressing Eve for the end
[1:16:41] time.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; You are the expression of Eve. What God
[1:16:46] wanted in the beginning to have dominion
[1:16:48] over the earth, you are now being called
[1:16:51] into your position as Eve, the bride.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; That's why the woman is always typed as
[1:16:56] the church.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; And so your position is to be the queen
[1:17:03] with the king
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; and the two. That's why the Bible says
[1:17:07] the lamb and his wife
[1:17:10] are going to rule in the millennium.
[1:17:13] rule, meaning they're just gonna have
[1:17:15] dominion. That's what God wanted from
[1:17:18] the beginning.
[1:17:20] Praise God.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; And so here now,
[1:17:24] even the angels, like we said here,
[1:17:26] right? Even the sun. So he goes on, he
[1:17:29] says he he didn't reveal it that reason
[1:17:31] under the seventh mystery. When the
[1:17:34] seventh seal was open, there was
[1:17:35] silence. Jesus when he was on earth,
[1:17:38] they wanted to know when he would come.
[1:17:40] He said, "It's not even the Son himself
[1:17:43] don't know when it's going to happen."
[1:17:45] See, God has this all to himself. It's a
[1:17:49] secret. Now, here's where, you know,
[1:17:51] people get confused because here Jesus
[1:17:55] is saying, "Not even the Son knows." You
[1:17:58] got to understand that the the the plan
[1:18:01] of God
[1:18:03] was from the beginning
[1:18:06] that if a man's sin, a man had to die.
[1:18:10] So when Jesus came to the earth, he came
[1:18:14] through a virgin birth showing how sons
[1:18:18] of God would actually be birthed back in
[1:18:20] the beginning by the spoken word. That's
[1:18:23] why the angel went to Mary and said,
[1:18:25] "Thou shalt have a son. and you shall
[1:18:28] call his name Jesus. He had to take on a
[1:18:31] human form.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; And so he was man and God.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Emmanuel was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:18:40] us.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; But he came for a purpose. He came so
[1:18:45] that we he came so that he could go to
[1:18:48] Calvary
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; to die
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; so that he could send the Holy Ghost
[1:18:53] back on us so that we could live.
[1:18:57] But he himself didn't. He says this is
[1:19:02] all in the plan from the very beginning.
[1:19:04] It was a part of the mystery that he
[1:19:07] would not unveil at that time.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; The fullness of the mystery could only
[1:19:12] be unveiled in this day.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; It's not something that he made
[1:19:16] available back then. even though he
[1:19:19] spoke it in many ways through his
[1:19:21] teaching and and and uh you know when he
[1:19:24] was talking to the people but it's today
[1:19:26] now by the Holy Ghost that we we we read
[1:19:28] the word and and and we get the mind of
[1:19:31] God. We get the understanding and the
[1:19:33] revelation of what he was saying and and
[1:19:36] that's why the Bible becomes alive to
[1:19:38] us. Amen. So, all of this was was was uh
[1:19:42] designed to unveil itself in this day.
[1:19:48] And Jesus knew this 2,000 years ago. And
[1:19:51] that's why he says that time is
[1:19:53] appointed. It's going to happen in God's
[1:19:56] time. But I I I can't reveal it to you
[1:19:59] right now. It's still a mystery that's
[1:20:02] going to unveil itself because God Jesus
[1:20:05] would not allow the enemy to know about
[1:20:08] it
[1:20:10] because one thing that Satan always did
[1:20:12] was he's an impersonator.
[1:20:15] He'd take the word and he'd impersonate
[1:20:17] it. And that's why through all the
[1:20:19] church ages, you see all the
[1:20:21] impersonations of of why the churches
[1:20:24] every church age when the Holy Spirit
[1:20:26] would come to that church age through
[1:20:28] the messenger, the people would be
[1:20:30] infiltrated by the enemy to get them off
[1:20:33] the word. Before you know it, they
[1:20:36] weren't baptizing in the name of the
[1:20:37] Lord Jesus Christ anymore. They were
[1:20:39] baptizing in the name of Father, Son,
[1:20:41] and Holy Ghost. And then they were
[1:20:44] baptizing children. And now before you
[1:20:46] know it, 95% of the people believe that
[1:20:49] you can just be baptized any way. It
[1:20:52] doesn't even matter anymore. See,
[1:20:54] they've made the word of none effect.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:20:59] And so here now, let's go to the next
[1:21:01] slide.
[1:21:03] And that's the reason there was silence
[1:21:06] in heaven for the space of half an hour
[1:21:07] and seven thunders uttered their voices.
[1:21:10] And John was forbidden to write it.
[1:21:13] the coming of the Lord. He's talking
[1:21:15] about the opening of the seventh seal
[1:21:18] and he's tying it together with the
[1:21:20] coming of the Lord. And that's why
[1:21:22] William Brandham's ministry of
[1:21:25] Revelations 101:7, I can't get into the
[1:21:28] full depths of it, but you you know what
[1:21:30] I'm talking about. You need to go back
[1:21:32] and read the revelation of the seven
[1:21:34] seals. The importance of it is what
[1:21:38] brought Christ to the earth again in our
[1:21:42] day. It happened in 1963.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not going to elaborate on it
[1:21:47] right now, but we're going to look at it
[1:21:48] more. That's one thing he hasn't
[1:21:52] revealed yet of how he will come and
[1:21:56] when he will come. It's a good thing
[1:21:59] that he doesn't see. No, he has shown or
[1:22:03] revealed it in every type that's in the
[1:22:05] Bible. Therefore, the entire Bible is
[1:22:09] the revelation of God's mystery in
[1:22:12] Christ. H you see you see what he's
[1:22:15] saying here? He's saying that that that
[1:22:18] the coming of the Lord and the calling
[1:22:21] of the sons and daughters of God, it's
[1:22:24] always been a mystery
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; and it's something that will only be
[1:22:29] revealed to the individuals that can
[1:22:32] recognize the word for their day. Amen.
[1:22:35] Amen.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; It's not something that that that God
[1:22:38] was going to explain.
[1:22:41] It's not given by explanation. It's not
[1:22:44] taught in any seminary. That's why you
[1:22:46] can go to whatever church you want.
[1:22:49] You're not going to hear this teaching
[1:22:54] and then have the ability to understand
[1:22:58] it by the Holy Ghost.
[1:23:01] Unless God brings you into it. Amen.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; You you must be brought into the mystery
[1:23:08] of God. That's why, you know, at the
[1:23:10] very beginning I said there's you're
[1:23:12] you're you're a peculiar you're a mystic
[1:23:14] people. You're a peculiar people because
[1:23:17] there's an element of the mystery of God
[1:23:19] that you are a part of
[1:23:22] that others are not a part of. And you
[1:23:25] don't join it. You don't decide I'm
[1:23:27] going to be a part of it.
[1:23:30] You were a son before you came into this
[1:23:33] church,
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; but something is speaking to your heart.
[1:23:37] Something is happening on the inside.
[1:23:39] Amen. Glory to God. So here he goes on
[1:23:42] and he says every
[1:23:44] if you go back and you you know like
[1:23:46] that's why Jesus Christ his whole God's
[1:23:50] whole plan of redemption and his whole
[1:23:52] condensation of him coming from God to
[1:23:56] man he kept coming into a lower form
[1:23:59] into a lower form into a lower form
[1:24:01] until he actually took on human flesh
[1:24:04] himself which was the lowest form
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; of humanity.
[1:24:10] and comes into this human realm.
[1:24:14] He was showing it and you can see it in
[1:24:16] so many types throughout the Old
[1:24:19] Testament and all the way leading up to
[1:24:22] the day that we're living in.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll see it in the types of
[1:24:26] Joseph and you know, you go back and you
[1:24:28] see how Joseph, you know, how he was
[1:24:30] rejected of his brothers. Jesus was
[1:24:33] rejected by his own people. He was loved
[1:24:36] by his father. Joseph's father loved
[1:24:38] him, but he was rejected by his own
[1:24:40] brothers. They threw him into a pit.
[1:24:43] Just like they they they they threw
[1:24:45] Christ into a into a pit and crucified
[1:24:48] him. Threw him into a prison. But then
[1:24:52] God raised him up out of the prison.
[1:24:55] Raised him up from the dead and put him
[1:24:58] and sat him at the right hand of
[1:25:00] Pharaoh. a type of Jesus Christ being
[1:25:04] risen, seated at the right hand of the
[1:25:07] father, meaning the the the power of
[1:25:09] God. You see the type? And every knee
[1:25:13] had to bow when Joseph come into Egypt.
[1:25:17] And who was Joseph? He was the son of of
[1:25:20] of Jacob. And he and and he had a wife
[1:25:24] and his wife was a gentile woman. That's
[1:25:27] why Christ is taking a gentile bride.
[1:25:30] Amen.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see all the types like I don't
[1:25:33] there's there's many other types you
[1:25:34] know Isaac and Rebecca and and Eleazar
[1:25:38] and Eleazar typing William Branham the
[1:25:40] messenger and leading Rebecca to to
[1:25:43] Isaac and all of these different types
[1:25:45] throughout the Bible. Amen.
[1:25:50] All in a mystery but all unveiling
[1:25:53] itself and God bringing you into a part
[1:25:55] of that understanding. And so he goes on
[1:25:58] here. He says no, he has showed or
[1:26:02] revealed it in every type. Let's go to
[1:26:04] the next quote. He says the entire Bible
[1:26:07] is an expression of one goal that God
[1:26:10] had one purpose he wanted to achieve in
[1:26:13] the entire Bible. And all the acts of
[1:26:17] the believers in the Bible has been a
[1:26:20] type and expressing what God's great
[1:26:24] goal is now.
[1:26:27] And now in this last day,
[1:26:31] he has revealed it and shows it.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; So this is now being unveiled before us.
[1:26:39] This is why we assemble ourselves
[1:26:42] because this mystery is continually
[1:26:46] being unveiled before us, bringing us
[1:26:49] out of our amnesia,
[1:26:52] making sense of our lives, why we were
[1:26:55] the way that we were, why we were, you
[1:26:57] know, in certain conditions. You didn't
[1:26:59] understand why, you know, you were you
[1:27:01] were a certain way and you you couldn't
[1:27:03] understand why, you know, you you were
[1:27:05] bound by certain things. But yet when
[1:27:08] this word comes along, it comes to to to
[1:27:11] liberate you from those things. It sets
[1:27:13] you free from those things that you
[1:27:15] thought you were bound by. This was the
[1:27:18] only word that would set you free. I
[1:27:20] remember I was under drug addiction for
[1:27:22] years. And I would look at that cocaine
[1:27:25] and I'd wonder, how in the heck is this
[1:27:26] thing going to take my life? I can't
[1:27:28] believe that this thing has such a hold
[1:27:30] on my life. But then all of a sudden,
[1:27:33] God had a different plan. And when he
[1:27:36] came and he called and he set me free,
[1:27:38] it was it was a miracle. It was an
[1:27:41] instant uh change in my life. And that's
[1:27:44] why there's no way I could deny what God
[1:27:46] had done.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; But only this message could do that for
[1:27:52] me. Amen.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; It was the only revelation that would
[1:27:56] answer every question that I had about
[1:27:59] my life.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Why I was I was a certain way and why I
[1:28:03] could see things in a certain way and
[1:28:05] see things different than the way others
[1:28:07] would see them.
[1:28:10] You were ordained to this.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; You couldn't miss it if you tried.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And he says here, he
[1:28:20] says here, and so so the believers in
[1:28:22] the Bible had been in type and
[1:28:24] expressing what God's great goal is. And
[1:28:26] now in the last days, he has revealed it
[1:28:29] and shows it. And with God's help, well,
[1:28:31] you'll see it right here this morning.
[1:28:34] What the Lord has had in his mind all
[1:28:36] along and has expressed it. Therefore,
[1:28:40] you can see the great meaning of what
[1:28:43] it's been to know this and then to try
[1:28:46] to bring it to the people. You see, now
[1:28:49] here's where we need to understand
[1:28:52] the prophet. We need to understand his
[1:28:57] part in the word of God.
[1:29:02] God sent him for a purpose.
[1:29:06] God ordained him from the womb to be a
[1:29:10] prophet in the 20th century
[1:29:13] so that he could display
[1:29:17] and bring God by the opening of the word
[1:29:21] by the fulfillment of Revelations 10:es
[1:29:24] 1-7 where an angel
[1:29:28] he was the seventh church age messenger.
[1:29:32] Okay, you got to go back and study the
[1:29:33] seven church ages to understand it. He
[1:29:37] was the seventh church age messenger to
[1:29:40] this Leodysian age.
[1:29:43] He had a commission.
[1:29:46] He was fulfilling a son of man ministry,
[1:29:50] prophetic ministry. A prophet is someone
[1:29:53] whom the word of the lord comes to.
[1:29:57] You go back into the Old Testament, you
[1:29:59] will see all the books, all the prophets
[1:30:02] books and the and the word of the Lord
[1:30:04] came to the prophet Elijah and the word
[1:30:07] of the Lord came to the prophet Ezekiel
[1:30:09] and the word of the Lord came to Moses.
[1:30:11] Who do you think was in Moses when he
[1:30:14] went and stood before Pharaoh and said,
[1:30:16] "Thus sayaeth the Lord,
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; set my people free."
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; That was God in Moses.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. that was speaking to Pharaoh.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; They didn't understand it, but God
[1:30:29] proved it and vindicated it when he
[1:30:31] brought all the plagues upon Egypt.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Moses that brought the
[1:30:37] plagues. It was God in Moses.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; And so, we can look all down through the
[1:30:45] ages when God sends a prophet and and
[1:30:47] that prophet comes and says, "Thus
[1:30:49] sayaeth the Lord."
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; That's not the man speaking. Yes,
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; that's God in a man.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; That's a God man.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. And so we need
[1:31:01] to understand that. So I don't want to
[1:31:04] get too far ahead of myself here. I want
[1:31:07] to go through through this element here
[1:31:10] of of uh my notes and it's going to lead
[1:31:12] us to that. But keep that in the back of
[1:31:14] your mind, okay? that William Branham
[1:31:18] was a prophet to this 20th century and
[1:31:21] that he had a commission and his
[1:31:23] commission was to fulfill Revelations
[1:31:25] 10:1-7.
[1:31:27] He would be the one that would be on the
[1:31:29] earth introducing
[1:31:33] the son of man
[1:31:36] to the earth.
[1:31:38] a son of man receiving the word, the
[1:31:40] mighty angel coming down to bring and
[1:31:43] open those seven seals. I'm going to
[1:31:46] leave it right there for now. Let's go
[1:31:48] to the next scripture.
[1:31:50] This is where we want to draw our
[1:31:52] thought from on calling of the sons of
[1:31:55] God. In Job chapter 38
[1:31:59] verses 4 to7,
[1:32:02] where was thou when I laid the
[1:32:04] foundations of the earth? declare, if
[1:32:06] thou hast understanding,
[1:32:09] who hath laid the measures thereof, if
[1:32:11] thou knowest, or who hath stretched the
[1:32:15] line upon it? Whereupon are the
[1:32:18] foundations thereof fastened? Or who
[1:32:21] laid the cornerstone thereof, when the
[1:32:24] morning stars sang together, and all the
[1:32:27] sons of God shouted for joy? Now, this
[1:32:32] we talked about this last week. this
[1:32:34] scripture, this is God having a uh, you
[1:32:39] know, a discussion
[1:32:41] with Job because Job went through, you
[1:32:45] know, go back and read it. Job's, you
[1:32:46] know, the the whole the whole story of
[1:32:48] Job and how God allowed the enemy to
[1:32:50] take his whole family to took his
[1:32:54] children, took his crops, everything to
[1:32:56] the very point where his own wife was
[1:32:58] telling him to just curse God. Why do
[1:33:00] you still believe God? But God was
[1:33:03] showing through Job that there was a
[1:33:07] part of him in Job that could never fail
[1:33:11] or disbelieve the word. Amen.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; And that's why when when he got to that
[1:33:16] place where Job, you know, got to a
[1:33:18] place, he told Job, he says, "Job,
[1:33:22] where were you when when when the
[1:33:24] foundations of the world," in other
[1:33:25] words, he took Job right back into his
[1:33:28] own mind and said, "I laid the
[1:33:31] foundations of the world. I'm the one
[1:33:33] that created this whole plan." You're so
[1:33:36] focused on your own little life and what
[1:33:38] it is that you think life is all about
[1:33:42] and you and and you're so discouraged.
[1:33:44] But where were you when the sons of God
[1:33:47] when the when the morning stars sang
[1:33:49] together and all the sons of God shouted
[1:33:52] for joy? This is what we're saying. If
[1:33:54] you're a son of God, you were always a
[1:33:56] son of God. God allowed Job to see back
[1:34:00] before the foundations of the world who
[1:34:03] he really was, what he was representing,
[1:34:07] what the whole plan was. And that's why
[1:34:09] Job eventually says, "I I I know I'll
[1:34:12] see my redeemer now. I I know that I'll
[1:34:15] I'll I will be on the earth as a son or
[1:34:19] a daughter of God." He came to that
[1:34:20] revelation. But the thing here that I
[1:34:23] want to draw from this is the
[1:34:26] understanding of what the morning stars
[1:34:31] and how they differentiate from the sons
[1:34:33] of God.
[1:34:35] Angels, okay, morning stars are angels.
[1:34:40] That's what they are.
[1:34:42] Sons are expressions of God. They are a
[1:34:47] part of God. Angels were created. They
[1:34:50] were created to worship God. That's why
[1:34:53] God could be worshiped because he
[1:34:55] created angels to worship him. God is
[1:34:58] only a word that is an object of
[1:35:00] worship. That's what made him God. But
[1:35:03] he's Elohim. But he needed something to
[1:35:06] worship him. So he created angels that
[1:35:09] would be able to worship him. Sons,
[1:35:13] they're always sons. But notice the
[1:35:15] difference. Morning stars sang.
[1:35:19] Sons shouted for joy. Amen. Angels and
[1:35:24] stars are messengers.
[1:35:26] Even the word morning star means angels
[1:35:30] from the beginning. Morning stars,
[1:35:32] right? The beginning.
[1:35:36] In Isaiah 14:12,
[1:35:40] you hear here in the scripture, "How art
[1:35:42] thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer,
[1:35:46] son of the morning?" How art thou cut
[1:35:49] down to the ground which did weight
[1:35:52] weaken the nations? He's talking about,
[1:35:55] you know, that Lucifer was an angel.
[1:36:00] Let's get this straight. Lucifer is not
[1:36:02] a son of God.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; he's an angel.
[1:36:06] He's an opposer of God.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; That's what he is. That's what his
[1:36:11] desire was right from the very
[1:36:13] beginning. That's why he went to Eve in
[1:36:15] the Garden of Eden. It was the serpent
[1:36:17] that went to Eve in the Garden of Eden
[1:36:19] and got her to come under his spell of
[1:36:24] deception to bring forth children
[1:36:26] naturally.
[1:36:29] That's why the original sin was not an
[1:36:31] apple that Eve ate. The original sin was
[1:36:35] an adultery. The serpent was an upright
[1:36:38] man that could speak. That was that he
[1:36:40] was it was Lucifer himself taking on a
[1:36:43] human form.
[1:36:45] That's why God said, "Of the tree of the
[1:36:46] knowledge of good and evil, you shall
[1:36:49] not eat from it." What's the tree of
[1:36:51] knowledge of good and evil? It was
[1:36:53] Satan. He was the deceiver. And that's
[1:36:56] why Eve when she went that way, it broke
[1:37:00] the continuity. God said that the day
[1:37:02] you eat thereof, you shall die. It
[1:37:05] brought death into humanity. And that's
[1:37:08] why we need to be saved. Originally,
[1:37:12] Adam and Eve were eternal. They could
[1:37:14] have been in the Garden of Eden for a
[1:37:15] million years. That's why dinosaurs and
[1:37:17] all this. People try to say, "Oh, you
[1:37:19] talk about the Bible. It's only 6,000
[1:37:20] years." There's dinosaurs that have been
[1:37:22] this proof that fossils this and that,
[1:37:24] 200 mill. Yeah. Adam and Eve could have
[1:37:26] been in the Garden of Eden before they
[1:37:28] went and actually ate from that tree.
[1:37:30] They could have been in the Garden of
[1:37:31] Eden for a billion years. There is no
[1:37:34] time in God. It's it's eternal. So
[1:37:36] things were evolving in the eternities
[1:37:40] if you want to say evolution of God
[1:37:43] because it has no beginning and no end.
[1:37:45] Amen. So understanding now the morning
[1:37:49] star that's why Lucifer oh son of the
[1:37:52] morning he was one of the morning stars
[1:37:55] that fell
[1:37:58] in the original plan. That's why the
[1:38:01] fall
[1:38:02] started before Eden.
[1:38:06] It was when they were there in the
[1:38:08] foundations of the world and the angels,
[1:38:12] they could fall. They could disbelieve
[1:38:15] because they had a beginning. They will
[1:38:18] have an end. But sons of God, they come
[1:38:21] from God. They could never have a
[1:38:24] beginning. They can never have an end.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; They're eternal. And they cannot
[1:38:29] disbelieve God because they are God.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; They're a part of God.
[1:38:35] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; This is the element that that we're
[1:38:38] coming to that that a lot of people they
[1:38:40] they find it hard to, you know, like
[1:38:42] people want to they want to take the new
[1:38:44] age movement and you know like I hear it
[1:38:46] all the time. We are God. We are we are
[1:38:49] the universe. They don't have a
[1:38:52] revelation. There's there's a revelation
[1:38:54] behind that when you place God in his
[1:38:56] rightful position.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; And you understand the whole plan of God
[1:39:02] for this earth. You see, that's the
[1:39:04] other thing. There could have been a
[1:39:06] thousand other earths before this one. I
[1:39:08] don't know. You don't know. Nobody
[1:39:11] knows. But all I know is I'm on this
[1:39:13] earth.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; And God has a plan for this earth.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; God has a plan for your life. God has a
[1:39:19] plan for this earth. God's going to
[1:39:21] allow this earth to go into tribulation.
[1:39:23] This world is going into total chaos.
[1:39:26] It's already happening. You don't have
[1:39:27] to be a a scientist to know that. I
[1:39:30] don't have to try to convince you to see
[1:39:32] what's going on out there and the
[1:39:33] condition of the world and where the
[1:39:35] world is headed. All kinds of confusion,
[1:39:39] neutral gender this, that, you know, not
[1:39:42] under. Listen, God created a man and a
[1:39:45] woman.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; There's a male and a female. Yes, the
[1:39:49] two are one. Satan is perverting that by
[1:39:53] saying, "Well, I I want to identify as
[1:39:56] the the woman."
[1:39:58] But wait a minute. Have you checked your
[1:40:01] gender? Have you checked yourself?
[1:40:04] You know what I'm saying?
[1:40:08] Were you born with or without?
[1:40:11] If it's with, you're a male.
[1:40:15] like like just like just it's but you
[1:40:17] see
[1:40:18] the confusion
[1:40:20] is what's got the people off the word.
[1:40:25] You see the author of confusion. Satan
[1:40:27] is the author of confusion.
[1:40:30] Okay? He's not some ugly, you know,
[1:40:33] people want to paint as a as some ugly,
[1:40:35] you know, monster that's that looks gory
[1:40:38] and he's got all this blob flowing from
[1:40:40] him and he's a terrible. No, no. He's in
[1:40:43] Hollywood.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; He's handsome. He's He's He's in the
[1:40:48] He's in the movies. He's in the He's in
[1:40:50] the the the the the billboards. He's
[1:40:52] He's everywhere. He's He's there to
[1:40:54] looking so beautiful, making That's what
[1:40:57] That's what's the problem with our young
[1:40:58] people these days. They want to fashion
[1:41:01] themselves a after some some beauty
[1:41:03] queen or some some hunk, you know, some,
[1:41:06] you know, they want to fashion
[1:41:07] themselves over that instead of
[1:41:10] fashioning themselves over the beauty of
[1:41:12] God's holiness,
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; God's character.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; God's desire for the world. God's desire
[1:41:19] is perfect peace and love.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; He is love. God is love,
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; but he's not perverted love.
[1:41:30] Amen. Praise God.
[1:41:32] So, so here, lightbringer, morning star.
[1:41:35] That's what lightbringer is. Sons of God
[1:41:39] were gods, are gods. They're a part of
[1:41:42] the father. God could not be a father
[1:41:45] unless he had sons. That's why he became
[1:41:47] father because he had sons. Amen. And
[1:41:51] notice the sons, they shouted.
[1:41:56] So this whole series on manifesting the
[1:42:00] sons of God and how you know we are in
[1:42:02] this process of adoption
[1:42:05] that you know when the word came to us
[1:42:08] it was actually God showing us that we
[1:42:11] had an inheritance that we were not just
[1:42:14] the son or daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
[1:42:18] Mazili or or or so and so or whatever.
[1:42:21] We come to realize that we actually have
[1:42:23] an inheritance because we are sons or
[1:42:26] daughters of the living God.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; And a part of that inheritance is to
[1:42:32] manifest what he originally had in his
[1:42:35] mind from the beginning. Sons of God
[1:42:39] manifested here on earth.
[1:42:43] And so God had a plan in order to bring
[1:42:47] that about.
[1:42:49] and he's always done it by his word.
[1:42:53] That's why if you look in the Old
[1:42:55] Testament, the word of the Lord came to
[1:42:59] the prophets. God could have done it,
[1:43:02] bypassed everything, but he had a plan.
[1:43:05] You see, Eve back at the very beginning,
[1:43:08] the original sin, he disbelieved God's
[1:43:12] word.
[1:43:14] That same
[1:43:16] problem exists today. that when you
[1:43:20] disbelieve God's word, it sends you into
[1:43:24] a different
[1:43:27] existence.
[1:43:29] You now become a circumstance that lives
[1:43:32] in a different existence. You fall under
[1:43:34] the existence of of the fifth dimension.
[1:43:39] You're, you know, like, you know, how we
[1:43:40] talk about how we're in we're in three
[1:43:42] dimensions, light, time, and matter. The
[1:43:45] fourth dimension is the ether which is
[1:43:48] where you know uh Wi-Fi and and
[1:43:51] television and radio waves and
[1:43:53] everything move through that. Well, the
[1:43:54] fifth dimension is where where Satan,
[1:43:57] the fallen angels and those that
[1:44:00] disbelieve God when they die, they go to
[1:44:04] the fifth dimension. When sons and
[1:44:06] daughters of God or people that believe
[1:44:08] the word of God accept Christ are
[1:44:12] birthed by the word and they die here in
[1:44:16] this dimension, they go to the sixth
[1:44:19] dimension which is where the redeemed
[1:44:21] are. That's the place Jesus said, I go
[1:44:24] to prepare a place for you that where I
[1:44:27] am, you may be also. But those that
[1:44:30] disbelieve the word, those that reject
[1:44:33] the word, when they die, they go to a
[1:44:35] fifth dimension.
[1:44:38] Okay? That's why you'll you'll hear you
[1:44:40] you'll hear like people that have
[1:44:42] near-death experiences.
[1:44:44] The people that have neardeath
[1:44:46] experiences and they come back and they
[1:44:48] give their testimony, they say they go
[1:44:50] into this place, they it's like a like
[1:44:52] they can't they it's such awesome love
[1:44:55] and and and it's it's it's remarkable.
[1:44:58] It's because they haven't gone to their
[1:45:00] full destination. And it all depends on
[1:45:03] how they're living and what they believe
[1:45:05] when they actually have this experience.
[1:45:08] Okay? And it determines what they come
[1:45:11] back with in the way of a testimony.
[1:45:15] That's why they come back. They didn't
[1:45:17] go to fully to the dimension that their
[1:45:20] that their circumstance that their
[1:45:22] belief system is going to take them to.
[1:45:25] as a son or a daughter of God, you die,
[1:45:27] you go to that redeemed dimension. And
[1:45:31] if if you're meant to stay there, you're
[1:45:33] not coming back. And don't be looking to
[1:45:36] to communicate with that dimension
[1:45:38] because they do not communicate with
[1:45:40] this dimension.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; There's only one mediator between man
[1:45:44] and God, and that's Christ Jesus.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; The only contact that you have right now
[1:45:50] is by the Holy Ghost.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's you coming into the
[1:45:54] recognition of who you are as a son or
[1:45:57] daughter of God. And the message of this
[1:46:01] hour is going to produce what we know as
[1:46:04] the rapture because there's going to be
[1:46:06] those that are not going to die that are
[1:46:09] going to be translated from this
[1:46:10] dimension into heavenly places in a
[1:46:14] moment in the twinkling of an eye. We're
[1:46:16] going to look at that here as we move
[1:46:18] along.
[1:46:19] Amen. So, so God has this whole process
[1:46:23] by the word of bringing sons of God into
[1:46:30] a recognition of what God is doing in
[1:46:33] their day.
[1:46:35] And there's a portion of word that God
[1:46:38] has made available. And that word always
[1:46:41] gets passed on down to whom God chooses
[1:46:45] to be the voice in that particular age.
[1:46:50] Amen. So,
[1:46:53] sons of God,
[1:46:55] like you know, I was I was saying last
[1:46:57] week when I gave that testimony where,
[1:47:00] you know, brother John Simon had been in
[1:47:02] South Africa and, you know, he he went
[1:47:05] and met brother Alistister there and
[1:47:07] and, you know, he ended up preaching
[1:47:08] instead of brother Isaiah and he
[1:47:10] preached and he took this very scripture
[1:47:12] on where were you when the morning stars
[1:47:15] sang together and the sons of God
[1:47:17] shouted for joy and then he made this
[1:47:18] statement. He says, "If the sons of God
[1:47:21] shouted back then, then why wouldn't the
[1:47:23] attributes of God, sons of God, shout in
[1:47:26] this last day?
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; They'd have to have something that
[1:47:30] they'd be shouting."
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; There's something that's in them that's
[1:47:34] going to produce the word in their day.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so this whole element it it it
[1:47:41] just you know it broke open for brother
[1:47:43] Alistister and it broke open for me when
[1:47:45] I heard it too when he mentioned that
[1:47:47] you know that there's these attributes.
[1:47:49] Remember God had this plan but this plan
[1:47:52] has like a 7,000year
[1:47:54] cycle built into it. We need to
[1:47:57] understand that. And we're at the end of
[1:48:00] the 6,000 years of that cycle. But
[1:48:03] within those cycles and within those
[1:48:06] dispensations,
[1:48:07] God had clusters of sons and daughters
[1:48:12] that would live in each of those
[1:48:14] different ages. That's why when you go
[1:48:15] back, you know, Moses, well, Moses had a
[1:48:19] cluster of attributes that had to
[1:48:21] manifest and they had to come together.
[1:48:23] Aaron, his brother, his mother, all
[1:48:25] those, you know, everyone that was a
[1:48:28] part of Moses' day, they were attributes
[1:48:31] of God that had to manifest the word in
[1:48:33] that particular day.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; David was a part of another cluster that
[1:48:37] he had to come into manifestation. He
[1:48:39] would be the word for that particular
[1:48:42] age. Amen. And here now we see that this
[1:48:45] has been the process all the way
[1:48:47] through. Even when Jesus the mighty God
[1:48:51] himself,
[1:48:52] the Messiah would come to the earth, he
[1:48:56] would come for for the main purpose of
[1:48:59] restoring back the sons and daughters of
[1:49:02] God without him coming to die and
[1:49:05] bringing himself to the earth and and
[1:49:08] not only did he come, but he came with
[1:49:11] us in him
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; because remember he is the word. He's
[1:49:14] the logus.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word. The word
[1:49:17] was with God. The word was God and the
[1:49:20] word was made flesh and you as a part of
[1:49:24] the word are a part of that logus. So
[1:49:27] when he went to Calvary and died at the
[1:49:30] cross, you went to Calvary with him.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; When he died, you died. When he rose,
[1:49:36] you rose.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why it takes the Holy Ghost
[1:49:40] in you to rise you and to and to and to
[1:49:44] produce the resurrection, the second
[1:49:46] resurrection.
[1:49:47] We saw the first one when Christ came to
[1:49:50] the earth. That's all in type form of
[1:49:53] exactly what he's going to do when he
[1:49:55] takes us in this resurrection
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; which is going to produce the rapture.
[1:50:00] We're going to see the parallels in
[1:50:01] that. But within all of that, there's a
[1:50:05] shout that represents the word. Let's
[1:50:10] read on now. I'm going to read the the
[1:50:13] next
[1:50:15] uh quote here. Brother Brandham
[1:50:16] speaking. He says in the hand of the
[1:50:18] when the the hand of the Lord came upon
[1:50:20] him. He says why I said about God spoke
[1:50:24] to Job one day and he said Job where was
[1:50:27] you when I laid the foundations of the
[1:50:29] world. Tell me what there tell me what
[1:50:32] they're fastened unto said when the
[1:50:35] morning stars sang together and the sons
[1:50:38] of God shouted for joy. Listen what he
[1:50:41] says here. a hundred million years
[1:50:43] before the world was ever formed. That's
[1:50:47] why I'm saying don't if that's the
[1:50:51] beauty of what this prophet did for us.
[1:50:54] Remember the word of the Lord came to
[1:50:56] the prophet. The prophet he took us not
[1:51:00] just back to the book of Genesis.
[1:51:03] He took us look a 100red million years
[1:51:07] back into the mind of God because God is
[1:51:10] eternal. Amen.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; He says before the world was even
[1:51:14] formed,
[1:51:15] they had shouting religion.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Listen, he's talking about shouting
[1:51:22] religion here. What is shouting
[1:51:24] religion? It's the word. It's the word
[1:51:28] being able to create to go forth and
[1:51:32] manifest the thoughts of God. A thought
[1:51:35] is only a thought, but when it's spoken,
[1:51:37] it becomes word. Amen.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; And when God spoke word, he said, "Let
[1:51:42] there be light." The interpretation is
[1:51:44] right up there in the in the sky.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; It's called the sun.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; That was the interpretation of his word.
[1:51:50] It manifested exactly what he said.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; And that's how he's bringing everything
[1:51:56] to pass.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; That's why it's got to be the original
[1:52:00] word for the sons and daughters of God.
[1:52:02] We can't take a tradition of the church.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; We're not interested in man's teachings.
[1:52:07] We're not interested in your
[1:52:08] interpretation on God's word. Let God be
[1:52:11] his own interpreter.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; He will make it plain by it bringing it
[1:52:15] to pass.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; That's how God is going to vindicate
[1:52:18] what you believe or disbelieve.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; He's going to vindicate it in your own
[1:52:23] life personally. You will know that you
[1:52:26] know.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not standing here, you
[1:52:30] know, uh, after 31 years believing this
[1:52:32] message, more excited about it than I've
[1:52:35] ever been.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Because I'm seeing what it's bringing me
[1:52:38] into.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; I'm seeing what it's going to manifest
[1:52:41] in my life. I see what the world's
[1:52:44] condition is. I see what it's going
[1:52:45] into. And I can see the word as clear as
[1:52:48] I can see it. I can't help it.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're a son or a daughter
[1:52:52] of God.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; You couldn't miss it. He says, "It's
[1:52:55] it's because you've you've caught the
[1:52:57] shouting religion." Amen. He says, "Then
[1:52:59] talk about something new." Why? It's the
[1:53:02] oldest there is. And the only kind there
[1:53:05] really is. Yeah. It's old-fashioned,
[1:53:09] heartfelt, sky blue, sinkilling
[1:53:11] religion. Brother, it don't whitewash
[1:53:14] you with traditions of men and teachings
[1:53:17] of men and Hail Marys and this and that.
[1:53:20] What the heck is that going to do for
[1:53:21] you?
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:53:24] You want a real experience with God. You
[1:53:27] want to know God is a real heartfelt sky
[1:53:29] blue sinkilling brother. It don't
[1:53:31] whitewash you. It washes you white from
[1:53:34] the inside out.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, it does. Makes you do things you
[1:53:39] didn't think you ever would do.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I remember when that word
[1:53:45] struck my soul 31 years ago. I was
[1:53:47] listening to John Simon preach on on the
[1:53:50] woman at the well. How she was a
[1:53:52] prostitute. She was living a life of
[1:53:54] prostitution. But Jesus come along
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; and discerned her life. Told her all
[1:54:00] about her life.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; While he was speaking to that, while
[1:54:05] John Simon was speaking about that
[1:54:06] woman, all I could hear was my life.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; All I could see was my condition. All I
[1:54:12] knew is that I was that prostitute.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; He was discerning my life, my need. He
[1:54:18] knew what I had need of. Amen. And it
[1:54:21] changed everything.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; It was a it was a sinkilling
[1:54:26] shout
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; that came out of John Simon that that
[1:54:29] that brought me into a recognition of
[1:54:32] who I was.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; I'm not the son of Dominic and Ida
[1:54:36] Mazili.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Those are my parents. I love them with
[1:54:38] all of my heart. But I am a son of God
[1:54:41] before
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; I am a son of this world.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; I just heard that it's millions of years
[1:54:47] old. I'm millions and mill I you can't
[1:54:50] even put an age on who we are.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; And so this this this makes it all just
[1:55:00] uh you know a completely different
[1:55:02] thing.
[1:55:04] So here now we understand now here's now
[1:55:06] where where we bring it now to to our
[1:55:09] day because in order for us to fully
[1:55:12] comprehend
[1:55:13] okay what do I got here about 15
[1:55:16] minutes? Amen.
[1:55:17] Okay. So, you know, we're not going to
[1:55:19] finish today, of course, but we want to
[1:55:22] bring it to our day and we want to come
[1:55:24] to a place where we can understand why
[1:55:28] God always does it by his word. And he
[1:55:32] uses angel messengers,
[1:55:35] prophets,
[1:55:37] amen, to bring the word so that we can
[1:55:40] recognize what the word for our age is
[1:55:45] supposed to produce.
[1:55:47] We don't want to hear somebody telling
[1:55:48] us about Noah building an ark. That was
[1:55:52] in Noah's day. What good is that going
[1:55:53] to do us today? We don't want to be
[1:55:56] building a an ark. We're not worried
[1:55:58] about a flood coming. We're looking at a
[1:56:01] great tribulation. We're looking at
[1:56:02] where the whole world goes into complete
[1:56:05] chaos.
[1:56:07] God's going to have to take this bride
[1:56:10] off the earth for three and a half years
[1:56:12] while this world goes into three and a
[1:56:15] half years of great tribulation.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we need to understand why God
[1:56:23] had to send a prophet in these last days
[1:56:28] because it was just like he did when
[1:56:30] John the Baptist remember John the
[1:56:32] Baptist there Jesus said there had been
[1:56:35] no other prophet as great as John until
[1:56:38] that day.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Why would Jesus have said that?
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; Why was John so important?
[1:56:46] because he was the one that would
[1:56:48] introduce the first coming of Messiah.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; That's why God had to send a prophet
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; and he was under the spirit of Elijah.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; And so God, you know, back in 1933,
[1:57:02] William Branam, he's baptizing, he was
[1:57:05] just a minister at the time, and he's
[1:57:06] baptizing people at the river, you know,
[1:57:09] in in Ohio there in Jeffersonville. And
[1:57:12] while he's baptizing these people, there
[1:57:14] was there was many witnesses that were
[1:57:16] there. A light, a pillar of fire come
[1:57:19] right down and hovered over that pool of
[1:57:22] water.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; And an announcement came forth where
[1:57:26] people heard, they heard it. Yes.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; As John the Baptist was sent to forerrun
[1:57:32] the first coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:57:35] Christ, so shall your message
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; be the front runner and the forerunner
[1:57:42] of the second coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:57:45] Christ. This was witnessed by people.
[1:57:47] You can even go back and search it in
[1:57:49] Google
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; and you'll see that it was an actual
[1:57:52] event made the newspaper.
[1:57:54] It was an event that that that even
[1:57:57] William Brham didn't fully understand.
[1:57:59] But yet his ministry took a turn from
[1:58:01] that point on and he now became the
[1:58:05] messenger to the final age to the to the
[1:58:08] to the to the Leodysian church age. He
[1:58:11] was he was not John. He was not Martin
[1:58:14] Luther. He was not Wesley. He was the
[1:58:16] Pentecostal messenger to the seventh
[1:58:19] church age. that not would be just a a
[1:58:22] man anointing, but would have a God man
[1:58:25] anointing, son of man ministry,
[1:58:29] prophetic ministry that would bring God
[1:58:32] on the scene again. Go back and study
[1:58:34] it. Go back and read about him.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; He brought that mysterious element of
[1:58:40] God back to the earth. There was no
[1:58:43] Listen, you can go back and read it. his
[1:58:45] revival and his meetings. They say to
[1:58:48] this day there was more miracles and
[1:58:51] more supernatural done in his ministry
[1:58:54] over the 30 years 33 years that 32 years
[1:58:58] that he was in the ministry
[1:59:00] that it even surpassed by by many times
[1:59:04] the miracles that Jesus did.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; We're talking hundreds of thousands
[1:59:08] people that were raised from the dead,
[1:59:10] supernatural things that were God. What
[1:59:12] was God doing? God was vindic. Remember,
[1:59:16] don't look at the man.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; I'm not raising up William Brandon here.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; I'm raising up God's word.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; God's word came to the prophet.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; It's the word that we're talking about
[1:59:27] here.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; It's what the word did in him that's
[1:59:30] producing what's going on in me.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; That's what that's what I'm not lifting
[1:59:37] up the man. I'm lifting up the word. If
[1:59:40] if if I be lifted up, he says, if I be
[1:59:43] lifted up, I'll draw all men unto me.
[1:59:45] I'm not going to lift up William
[1:59:47] Brandom. I'm not going to push the
[1:59:49] tapes. I'm going to push Jesus Christ
[1:59:51] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:59:54] Amen. Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:59:58] So, so here now I want to read a
[2:00:01] scripture because we want to understand
[2:00:04] why we recognize William Brham's
[2:00:08] ministry was the message of this hour.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; It was the message that would bring us
[2:00:15] to where we are today.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Should I get started right now or
[2:00:20] should I wait until next week?
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Oh my glory to God. Amen.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; Let's get started. Let's go.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the next slide here.
[2:00:30] Thessalonians, this is this is the hour
[2:00:33] we're living in. This is what this is
[2:00:35] what we're going to produce. This is
[2:00:37] what this whole message is all about.
[2:00:40] That's what Christ the mystery of God is
[2:00:43] all about. Amen. He says here, "But I
[2:00:45] would not have you to be ignorant,
[2:00:47] brethren, concerning them which are
[2:00:50] asleep, that ye sorrow not even as
[2:00:54] others which have no hope." You know, so
[2:00:57] many people they just want to talk
[2:00:58] about, you know, oh, I I'm I'm going I'm
[2:01:01] going to go to heaven or this one's
[2:01:03] going to go to hell. You know, if you
[2:01:05] don't believe Jesus Christ, you're going
[2:01:07] to go to hell. If you don't believe, you
[2:01:09] know, all these No, we're not here to
[2:01:11] talk about that.
[2:01:13] That's not what we're here to do. Amen.
[2:01:15] Praise God. That's why Paul, he had a he
[2:01:19] had an understanding of the revelation
[2:01:21] of the word. He says, "Don't you be
[2:01:23] worried about those that have gone on
[2:01:25] before us. Don't worry about them. For
[2:01:28] if we believe that Jesus died and rose
[2:01:31] again, even so them also which sleep in
[2:01:35] Jesus,
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; those that received Christ in their
[2:01:38] dispensation over those seven church
[2:01:40] ages after he rose from the dead, we
[2:01:43] came through seven church ages. That's
[2:01:45] why you need to go back and read the
[2:01:46] seven church ages to understand the
[2:01:49] whole process of which God was doing to
[2:01:51] build up this body of Christ that we're
[2:01:54] now coming to the fullness of. Amen. He
[2:01:58] says he says here that that when those
[2:02:01] received Christ in their day, they were
[2:02:03] the bride in their day.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; They were anointed by the Holy Ghost to
[2:02:08] fulfill what they did through the dark
[2:02:10] ages. That's why if you go back and you
[2:02:12] read on the in the dark ages, you you
[2:02:14] hear about those Christians that were
[2:02:16] fed into the into the arena. Lions would
[2:02:20] rip them apart. They would cut them into
[2:02:22] pieces. This and that. But yet, go back
[2:02:24] and read and study some of that. Those
[2:02:27] Christians, they came out there praising
[2:02:29] God.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; They had an anointing on them because
[2:02:33] the Holy Ghost was on them for their
[2:02:36] day.
[2:02:37] They had the word anointing on them to
[2:02:40] overcome whatever it was that they had
[2:02:43] to face in their day.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; You have been given the Holy Ghost
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; by the power of God to overcome this
[2:02:51] dimension. No matter what you face,
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; no matter what you think, oh, I can't do
[2:02:58] this. Oh, you know, people are going to
[2:03:00] think I'm crazy. Don't worry about it.
[2:03:02] There's an anointing that's going to
[2:03:04] come on you, which is the purpose of God
[2:03:06] that'll override whatever gets in his
[2:03:09] way.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Nothing is going to get in God's way
[2:03:12] from you becoming the manifestation of a
[2:03:14] son of God.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can stop it.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; God's purpose is in the Holy Ghost.
[2:03:21] That's why those those disciples that
[2:03:23] had to die for the gospel, they had to
[2:03:26] get burned at the stake. They were
[2:03:27] worshiping God while they were being
[2:03:30] burnt. Why? because the anointing on
[2:03:31] them. You think they felt any of the
[2:03:33] heat? They felt the glory of God.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; We believe in a supernatural God. And
[2:03:39] God can supernaturally change whatever
[2:03:41] circumstance
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; you might be dealing with. So he says
[2:03:45] here, "Those which sleep in Jesus will
[2:03:47] God bring with him. For we say unto you
[2:03:51] by the word of the Lord
[2:03:54] that we which are alive and remain unto
[2:03:57] the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[2:04:00] them which are asleep. They don't worry
[2:04:04] about them. They're actually waiting on
[2:04:07] you.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're waiting on you to come
[2:04:11] into your sunship because they've
[2:04:13] already gone to their theophony bodies.
[2:04:16] They've already gone to that sixth
[2:04:18] dimension, but they're not with Jesus
[2:04:20] yet. They're not fully come together as
[2:04:25] the complete body of Jesus Christ, the
[2:04:28] bride and the lamb, Christ and his
[2:04:31] bride. That is what we produce by the
[2:04:35] rapture.
[2:04:36] That's why we have such an important
[2:04:39] element to fulfill
[2:04:42] as we are adopted sons coming into the
[2:04:45] manifestation of sons of God. But a part
[2:04:49] of this manifestation is that you have a
[2:04:52] shout in you. Listen here.
[2:04:56] Next slide.
[2:04:58] 1 Thessalonians 4:16 to18. For the Lord
[2:05:01] himself,
[2:05:03] now I'm going to say to you plain and
[2:05:06] simple,
[2:05:08] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[2:05:11] heaven with a shout, with the voice of
[2:05:14] the archangel, and with the trump of
[2:05:16] God, and the dead in Christ shall rise
[2:05:19] first. Then we which are alive and
[2:05:22] remain, shall be caught up together with
[2:05:25] them in the atmosphere in the clouds,
[2:05:30] not up into these clouds like people
[2:05:32] think. It's a dimensional change,
[2:05:34] saints. It's a dimensional change.
[2:05:37] People are not going to see you when you
[2:05:39] go in the rapture. They're going to miss
[2:05:42] you. They're going to say, "What
[2:05:44] happened? I know she was there and now
[2:05:48] they're not answering."
[2:05:49] There's going to be all kinds of
[2:05:51] confusion, but there'll be a a caught up
[2:05:54] together with them in the clouds to meet
[2:05:56] the Lord in the air. And so shall we
[2:05:58] ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort
[2:06:02] one another with these words.
[2:06:05] This is the rapture scripture. Now I
[2:06:08] want to break it down a little bit.
[2:06:10] Couple minutes. No, you know what? Let
[2:06:13] the musicians come because this is where
[2:06:16] it just starts to, you know,
[2:06:19] the inspiration like I've got lots of
[2:06:21] notes here. Don't worry, we're going to
[2:06:24] get into this. It's going to it's going
[2:06:26] to just it's just going to continue. I
[2:06:28] I'm trusting that you know that you're
[2:06:30] you're catching here what God is trying
[2:06:32] to unveil to us. He's trying to make it
[2:06:34] clear to us what it is that he's doing.
[2:06:37] That he's possessing attributes, sons
[2:06:40] and daughters of God. He's placing his
[2:06:43] word in you. He's given you that
[2:06:47] anointing to understand what it is that
[2:06:50] he's doing in this day and in this age.
[2:06:52] Amen. Which is going to produce by your
[2:06:56] ministry. You have a part to do with
[2:06:59] this. This is not just, oh, I'm just
[2:07:01] going to go to church. No, there's a
[2:07:03] shout in you.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; There's a message. There's a revelation
[2:07:07] in you that's bringing forth sons of
[2:07:09] God.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; You didn't understand. You would listen
[2:07:11] to the message. you you know all of a
[2:07:13] sudden something catches your your your
[2:07:15] your your your attention because it was
[2:07:17] your time. It was your season. It was it
[2:07:19] was time for God to unveil himself to
[2:07:22] bring you into your position as a son of
[2:07:24] God.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; But he's got a purpose in doing that.
[2:07:27] Don't think it's just to be a church
[2:07:29] member.
[2:07:30] It's to be a a a reflection of what he
[2:07:35] did. And we're and this is what we're
[2:07:36] going to be looking at next week. We're
[2:07:38] going to be looking at what God produced
[2:07:41] in William Branham as the wave sheath as
[2:07:45] the first son of God to to to come into
[2:07:50] full manifestation to where he could
[2:07:53] actually manifest the things that sons
[2:07:56] of God will manifest by the spoken word
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; when they come into their fullness.
[2:08:03] We're not talking about hocus pocus
[2:08:05] here. We're not talking about, you know,
[2:08:07] uh, Superman and and flying from here to
[2:08:10] there. No, no, no. We're talking about
[2:08:11] the reality of what God is doing
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; and what God did in that man's ministry.
[2:08:18] We're going to look at it a little
[2:08:19] closer next week and we're going to see
[2:08:22] that what God was displaying, the reason
[2:08:24] why God came down in 1963.
[2:08:28] That that that was the beginning of the
[2:08:30] shout. That was where God would would
[2:08:33] descend and the Lord himself. That's why
[2:08:36] the scripture says the Lord himself
[2:08:38] shall descend with a shout,
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; the voice and with the trump of God. All
[2:08:43] three of them is Jesus Christ.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; But the shout was the message that he
[2:08:48] had to bring to William Branham.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; And the reason why he was bringing it to
[2:08:53] William Branham was so that he could
[2:08:56] bring it to you.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And this is what we're going
[2:08:59] to understand deeper as we move through
[2:09:02] this. And and and by the grace of God,
[2:09:04] it's going to bring us into a clearer
[2:09:06] understanding of our sunship.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; As sons and daughters of the living God.
[2:09:12] Let us pray.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; Our gracious father. Lord,
[2:09:18] I can only expound as much as I can see.
[2:09:23] And Lord, human ability and words and
[2:09:26] understanding and and and language.
[2:09:29] Father, I could only say so much. But
[2:09:31] Lord, what's going on in our hearts and
[2:09:33] in our minds and our hearts burning
[2:09:35] within us, Lord, this is an element that
[2:09:38] that only you can do. Only you can make
[2:09:40] this real to each and every individual
[2:09:42] heart so that we can Lord fulfill the
[2:09:45] purpose, the plan, the destiny that you
[2:09:48] had for each and every one of our lives.
[2:09:50] Lord, this whole world is coming to a to
[2:09:53] a to a close in the chapter of this
[2:09:57] element and this time of the word to be
[2:10:00] fulfilled, the rapture of the church.
[2:10:02] It's it's coming quicker than we think,
[2:10:05] Lord. It's it's because the word is
[2:10:07] becoming more real to us. It's becoming
[2:10:10] uh Lord clearer who we are, why we we
[2:10:13] were the way we were, why we had such
[2:10:15] lives that were kind of misunderstood
[2:10:18] and Lord uh uh mystic in certain ways.
[2:10:21] And but Lord, you've made it clear,
[2:10:23] Father. You've made it real to us now,
[2:10:25] Lord, that that we're not of this world.
[2:10:27] We're in it, but we're not of it. And
[2:10:29] Lord, that is an element that only you
[2:10:32] can do. That we are so grateful for.
[2:10:35] Father, we commit the word that's been
[2:10:38] spoken and all that was, Lord, uh,
[2:10:40] placed into our hearts. May May it just
[2:10:42] stir within our our lives this week. May
[2:10:45] May it cause us to search deeper into
[2:10:47] you, Father, and your will for each and
[2:10:49] every one of our lives. Grant it, we
[2:10:51] pray. Prosper us, watch over us, Lord.
[2:10:53] Protect us on the roads, Father. Bring
[2:10:55] each and everyone safely home, Lord.
[2:10:57] Bless our weak lays before us. Prosper
[2:11:00] our weak, Lord. You know, you're Jehovah
[2:11:03] Gyra. You provide all of our needs.
[2:11:05] That's the element that Lord that that's
[2:11:07] so beautiful when we come into that
[2:11:08] relationship. All the promises are are
[2:11:12] now ours if we can just believe. Grant
[2:11:15] it we pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen
[2:11:19] and amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Go
[2:11:22] ahead,
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; brother.
[2:11:25] [Music]
[2:11:30] Why don't we all stand and
[2:11:33] thank him? The Lord is good. The Lord is
[2:11:35] good. The Lord is good. Oh, the Lord is
[2:11:39] good.
[2:11:40] [Music]
[2:11:43] The Lord is good.
[2:11:46] [Music]
[2:11:50] And blessed is the man
[2:11:54] who has put his trust in him. The Lord
[2:12:00] is good.
[2:12:02] [Music]
[2:12:04] The Lord is good.
[2:12:10] Taste and see
[2:12:12] that the Lord.
[2:12:15] Oh, praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[2:12:20] I've tasted and seen that the Lord.
[2:12:26] [Music]
[2:12:29] and Joel's army if you would. Morning
[2:12:32] stars
[2:12:35] together sing. Sons of God, sons of God,
[2:12:42] his praises ring,
[2:12:46] arise and shine,
[2:12:49] my Lord and King.
[2:12:53] Come for redemption

[2:26:33] I
[2:26:35] will fly away
[2:26:39] to a home on God's celestial shore.
[2:26:45] I
[2:26:47] fly away.
[2:26:51] Oh, I
[2:26:53] will fly away
[2:27:02] and I won't die. Hallelujah. By and by.
[2:27:13] Well, this world is not my home. I'm
[2:27:17] just a passing true. My treasures are
[2:27:21] lit up somewhere beyond.
[2:27:25] The angels beckoning me from heaven's
[2:27:29] open door. And I can't feel at home in
[2:27:34] this world anymore.
[2:27:37] Lord, you know I have no friend like
[2:27:41] you. If heaven is not my home, then what
[2:27:46] will I do? The angels back at me.
[2:27:56] [Music]
[2:27:59] See, they're all expecting me. And
[2:28:03] that's one thing I know. I fixed it up
[2:28:07] with Jesus so many years ago.
[2:28:11] I know he'll see me through.
[2:28:14] Oh, I am weak and
[2:28:17] I can't feel at home in this world
[2:28:21] anymore.
[2:28:28] If heaven is not my home,
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; the angels back in me.
[2:28:48] to gain his name.
[2:28:51] Said I'm on my way
[2:28:54] to K.
[2:28:57] I'm on my way.
[2:29:02] I'm on my way. Praise God. I'm on my
[2:29:06] way.
[2:29:08] If you don't go,
[2:29:11] you can't hinder me.
[2:29:14] If you won't go,
[2:29:17] don't hinder me.
[2:29:20] If you don't go,
[2:29:24] don't.
[2:29:26] I'm on my way. Praise God. I'm on my
[2:29:29] way. Oh, I'm on my way.
[2:29:37] I'm on my way.
