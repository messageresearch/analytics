TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening friends once again it's a joy and privilege of being here with you to share in the breaking of the bread of life as we open the word of god our hearts rejoice to know that we are fed by his mighty hand thank god let us pray our gracious heavenly father we ask your blessing this evening upon the word of god and we pray that the blessed holy spirit of almighty god will anoint us together lord and speak into our hearts divine truth that will change our lives completely forever and to thee be all the praise the honor and the glory for we thank you in this in jesus name amen and amen once again we continue in our study of these seven church ages we are now uh studying the ephesian or first church age we have dealt with approaching approach topics and now we deal with the topic of tried and true believers christians of that day and time were tried and found to be true holding to god's unchanging word they were tried by revelation they were tried by the word of god satan adding and taking from the word to see whether or not he could sway the people of god away from god's truth so they were tried by the word of god satan tested or tried them again by persecution to see whether or not by persecution he could shift them away from the truth and then they were also tried by their relationship the relationship to christ of course their relationship is based on the word of god and their reaction to the word of god so he tried them on their relationship with jesus christ to see whether they will continue to live holy life and true to god now our scripture reading is found in the book of revelation chapter 2 reading from verse 2. i know thy works and i labor and i patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars and has born and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted thank god that church did not faint did not fail did not fall but stood by the word of god until a crown of life they gained for god's glory amen oh thank god how beautifully our lord jesus praises his own and commands his children he takes account of their full spiritual attitude to his word and their behavior in natural life the way they conducted themselves and when he looks at this ephesian age he discerns that there is weakness amongst them false apostles you know and and other things he sees that and the the thing about this is that he does not cry out against it even though he sees it instead he focuses upon the good that they're accomplishing he focuses upon the beauty of their character and the efforts that they are making in serving him and bringing glory to his marvelous name praise god we certainly as christians can learn a marvelous wonderful lesson from that that we are not to focus on the wrong or the evil that most men and women do but to focus on the good parts of their life of course we will call them to attention of the word of god but we must bring their our thoughts to think about the good parts that god has placed within their hearts and within their lives and work with that to bring that to a place where their lives will be shaped and formed to give glory and praise to god hallelujah never mind the trials the tests the tribulations don't ever be discouraged child of god don't ever be discouraged saint of god for god is not ungracious to forget or to overlook the labors of our love and our faith in his word whatever it might be whether it's giving a cup of cold water something to someone helping someone along life's way there is a reward there is a blessing from the very presence of almighty god listen to the scripture i know thy lab works i know thy labor and i know your patience here he is walking in the midst of his church and he knows their works he knows the labor and he knows the patience that it takes to follow implicitly closer to the word of god our god is always aware of your tests your trials and he's fully aware of the sufferings of his people and he cares he cares for you he cares for all those who are undergoing the pressures of life the suffering and the privations and all the trials and troubles that satan brings along our way when israel was in egypt in captivity the bible says the oppression was so strong that they cried out unto the lord and the bible tells us that the lord heard their cry praise god i want to tell you today that same god will hear your cry if you call out to him cry out to him tell him what is your problem tell him what is your care and god cares for you and he will hear and he will understand that god that heard israel back there in egypt is still here today and our god never changes he still has that loving and caring heart amen he always has his ears open to the cries of the oppressed he is a god who walks around us and cares for us and loves us now we know that labor means uh the suffering that comes from oppression it's stress it that comes from being oppressed and god's people not only work in this great labor of love but they suffer for him with joy they carry the word of god bearing the reproach and they are not ashamed of him they are patient in bearing these reproaches these mockings these scuffings they are patients as they carry the great yoke of our savior this first age of ephesians or the ephesian church age carried a lot of persecution for after the departure of paul and john and the other apostles great persecution descended upon the church of the living god for they had to work so hard to preach the word of truth this gospel of light amidst the pagan roman and uh greek and all other nationalities the darkness that was all around they had to labor as much to be able to preach this gospel of course their highest calling was to serve their god and when their hopes were twerted when their work was blighted they were patient they were committed unto him because he had promised them glorious everlasting recompense in heaven in his divine presence i believe we will always need to understand here that god's people never mind or never it doesn't matter how perfect they are in their service to god god's people will always undergo some form of persecution it was so in the book of genesis which is the seed book seed chapters in the book of genesis which is called the book of beginnings and whatever finds its seed form in genesis it runs the gamut of the entire bible right into the closing book of revelation where everything winds up my friends praise god in this first book of genesis we find cain persecution uh persecuting and killing a bell so do these contrary to the word of god persecute and try to kill the abel's or the believers those that are able to hold to god's word for this day so do the canes of this hour try to destroy their brother who tries to serve god we find out we see uh isaac we see he's he sees how isaac and ishmael we see how esau hated jacob and would have killed him we find in the new testament how judas betrayed our lord jesus we find the religious leaders and orders of that day trying to destroy and to kill the believers of that first century and to destroy the church of god in that hour and in that time of course we know that the children of the devil are controlled by the world of flesh and the devil and that the devil and his children hate god and the children of the living god for their controlled by saints and satan's spirit no matter how upright you or i may be or a christian might be in the eyes of the public how gracious how loving how kind we are to our fellow men doesn't matter if we do nothing but good to the people all around us as long as we are confessing jesus christ as our lord and as our savior and that he is our one true god as long as we acknowledge the power of the holy spirit the operation of the gifts of god within the church of the living god tom's prophecy oh praise god hallelujah spirit of satan hates that spirit of the living god and that that's working through the believers of today and we know satan cannot destroy god but he will do all that he can do to destroy the messenger or the vessel to which through which god is expressing or manifesting himself in this hour and in this day and time yes persecutions and trials are a normal part of the christian life and there is only one thing that we can do about that is to commit ourselves to god and surrender ourselves completely to him as the scripture says thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou hast tried them which say that they are apostles and they are not and has found them liars praise god the ephesian church believed that god's people ought to be holy and we are i believe in this day in this hour as we are at the end of the church ages that god's people should still be holy live clean and holy in his presence just as they did in the very first age to prove to the devil that we will not bow down to him in babylon we will not accept his systems we will not be corrupted and swayed by the world world but we will alter god's unchanging hand and not take the level satan's leaven but we will remain as the unleavened bread of life to the people that are in the world amen hallelujah and as the church of god we are required by the word of god to put away from us the evil thing put away the wicked ones from in amongst us we are a people that are separated to god and separated unto his word hallelujah we should not allow the world to enter among us neither should we put up with any sin within the church of the living god hallelujah holiness holiness without which no man no woman no person shall see the lord it's not a phrase it's not a word to the christian but to the christian it is a way of life to live and walk in the holiness of the one true and living god the scripture reads will strike them that say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars praise god what a blood statement you have tried those who say they are apostles they are acclaiming and proclaiming themselves they have this sense of religious spiritual self-promotion that they are apostles i am bishop so-and-so i am the reverend so-and-so i am apostle so-and-so i am prophet and whatever and they place these various designations which are scriptural in the word of god but they lift those scriptural designations out of the word of god and place it upon themselves it's not god confirming who they are but they are in this spirit of self-promotion calling themselves and making themselves prophets and apostles and teachers and pastors and placing themselves in these various positions hallelujah and being presumptuous in the presence of almighty god hallelujah amen so the bible tells us the ephesian church try them how are we to try them but the bible does tell us that we ought to try the spirit now galatians chapter 1 verses 8 but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you then that wick hath we have preached unto you let him be accursed or praise god you see paul was telling the ephesian people hold to the original truth and doctrines declared by the apostles who had brought the original word and that original word could not change by one dot or by one dash that word had to remain the same word of god for the owl and so paul is saying if anyone else brings some other gospel to you that you are to hold to god's hand paul is saying even if i paul were to come and try to change the revelation that i have given to you then let me be a curse you see paul knew that the revelation that was given to him was correct originally by the word of god so he god couldn't give him a first or second and third revelation because god being perfect his word to it through his apostle is perfect so we thank god for the perfect word of god for this day and for this hour that we have received and we give him all the glory hallelujah amen now we know that satan's trick is always to add or take away from the word of god even as he did with eve in the garden of eden we see him doing the same thing through the entire bible adding or taking away from the word of god to distract to to deflect and to misdirect god's people and their eyes their thoughts away from the truth of the word of god hallelujah amen glory to god now we see here clearly friends that god's word does not change and god's word will come exactly as he wants it revealed to us now praise god these false apostles had come up with their own ideas their own thoughts their own philosophies and presenting them to the people as the word of god as it is today we find the preaching of psychology and all manner of other isms and it's being preached across many pulpits and declared as if it was the word of god no but thank god the ephesian church knew the word that paul had taught them and they were all anointed and full of the holy ghost by the laying on of the hands of paul and timothy any other apostle that was anointed by the holy spirit hallelujah amen and so there had the spiritual strength and boldness to stand before these false apostles and listen to them first and then say to them you are not saying what paul has said you are not preaching what paul has taught us according to the word of god and therefore we know that you are false no matter how religious they may sound no matter how beautiful their speeches their sermons that they present if it does not align with what the prophet of the hour says the messenger of the day says it's contrary to the word of god and its fault according to god's word oh praise god hallelujah friends that ought to set our hearts on fire we ought to realize that we ought to get back to the word of god because that is our shield the word of god is our shield and it guards us against every weapon and every evil thing satan hallelujah o praise god hallelujah oh friends i tell you it's marvelous that god has given us this power and authority to discern the lord's body to test and to try these spirits to recognize this false apostles it is not that we as individuals try these false apostles teachers and so on but it's the word himself or itself that tries these people hallelujah and i thank god that god has sent a divine a messenger in this last church age just as he did in the first church age the first church age messenger was paul the last church age messenger is william marian branham whom god sent with the holy spirit and sent him with the word of god of truth anointed him with signs wonders and miracles to vindicate that that which he was speaking was thus saith the lord god hallelujah amen and he proved to the world that he was the real messenger the real one sent from the presence of god hallelujah amen yes sir i want to thank god that he opened my eyes and i recognized this marvelous messenger that he has sent in this last day and from that day of recognizing this marvelous and wonderful messenger that message has inspired me my friends it's motivated me it's kept me and kept my heart mind and eyes upon the word of truth and saw the same spirit i have held to that until this day and may i hold to god's word unto the very end until us the scripture songwriter says until i come to the last mile of the way amen hallelujah amen praise god they knew that what the messenger spoke then and what the messenger has spoken now is the same word that paul had spoken and we cannot and they should not and we cannot deviate in any way away from that word of god not for a moment not for one jot one tittle or for one i owe the hallelujah especially in this last age we've seen so many false prophets appearing so many false teachers appearing on the scene and they keep telling you all these various so-called truths and approaches to the word of god but thank god their god sent a last day prophet to cut through all of the garbage all of the religious mess and to reveal to us thus saith the lord the truth out of the word of god hallelujah and this god sent prophet truly up god said prophet message was get back to the word get back to the original faith go down to what god has left you in this bible through the ministry of his anointed apostles prophets teachers that he has sent his messengers now according to the word of god paul recognizes that these false apostles are really graveness and grievous wolves amongst the people now listen what paul said once i am gone they'll try to come and claim of course equal revelation or that they have the same kind of anointing but you see their purpose is not to help you it's not to heal you but it's to steal the truth from you it's to destroy you is to distract you and to throw you off take you off from centering your entire soul and being upon the word of god for this day acts chapter 20 verses 27 to 32 paul is speaking for i have not shown to declare unto you all of all the counsels of god take heed therefore unto yourself and to all the flock of god which is among you which god has made you overseers to feed the church of god oh for he had which he has purchased with his own precious blood for i know this that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in amongst you amongst you not from somewhere out there or somewhere in the world but right from amongst you in your message in your face that was taught to you there will arise grievous wolves from amongst you not sparing the flock and also of your own selves shall men arise hallelujah speaking what perverse things in other words perverting the message perverting the word perverting what you were taught in the word men will arise from right amongst you preachers teachers will rise from amounts you that will pervert this very word that you have received and they are not speaking god's word but their own thoughts and their own ideas to draw away the disciples not to follow the prophet's message but to follow them to follow them but our directive is to point people to the word of the living god therefore watch and remember says the scripture that by the grace of god three years i cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears and now brethren i commend you to god and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance amongst all of them which are sanctified of course john knew this for in john first john chapter 4 verse 1 he says many false prophets are already gone out into this world and it was by going of course by them going against the word of god that made them into false prophets hallelujah oh yes praise god hallelujah right here in the first church age the ephesian church age is where it all started as in the old testament everything started in that book of genesis now we see this in the first church age the evil workings of satan satan's tale started twitching his lies began being sent out upon the people everywhere and already their people had started to deny the very word of god hallelujah i mean of course you would then deny the word of god by setting up their own creeds their own darkness and their own teachings and to be anti-word is to be antichrist for jesus is the word and if you are against the word then you will be accounted to be anti-christ hallelujah or praise god we know it all started in that first church age and we know that it will continue right on to the very end of these church ages where it will come to its harvest time its ripening hour where it will eventually according to the word the word says they will actually take over and the true seed of god will be pushed out but when we are pushed out we'll be taken up hallelujah so we can hold to god's word and god will begin to deal with the spirit of the antichrist that's been left here upon the earth yes friends we see it right there going through all the ages until this anti-war becomes a anti-christ a world system that is taken over entirely and begin to claim infallibility of the word of god hallelujah oh my friends thank god we have an anchor that keeps our soul we have been founded upon the foundation of the revelation of the fullness of the word of god where we will not look to the left nor to the right we will not turn to the left or to the right but we will press the to the mark of the high calling in our lord and savior jesus christ hallelujah oh my this antichrist anti-word system is a complete repudiation of the fullness of the word of god listen satan doesn't just come right out and deny the bible he does not just come right out and say oh it's not the word of god no sir listen revelation 22 for i testify to you and unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add on to these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book of prophecy for god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book or yes god's word is unchanging god himself is unchanging one word taken from god's economy one word added to god's economy just as he did in eden it changes the entire structure and just as satan did then in the garden of eden so is he attempting to do here today adding one little word trying to take away a word out of god's promised revelation for this day and just as it brought death sin death and destruction back then so does it do the same today amen yes sir it brings that death and destruction while the antichrist spirit will begin to grow and to flourish under that type of system here we see friends twins in the beginning twins in the end the two trees in the garden in the beginning and we see these two trees again side by side they have to grow in the church side by side they have to grow right in their belief in the word of god in the same art they have to grow good and evil cain and abel isaac and ishmael judas and jesus side by side they have to grow taking off this very same nourishment growing in the same earth watered by the same reign of the holy spirit and benefiting by the same revelation the same son for one will take that revelation and grow and live by it one another will take the same revelation pervert it and twist it and make it an antichrist system but praise god because they come from different seeds they act very differently when they are made manifested praise god one tree is anti-god antichrist and against everything god does substituting its own creeds and its own dogmas for the true and living word of the living god hallelujah and that is why cain hated abel and that is why the cain the spirit of cain in the people of this day hates the people of god the people with the spirit of abel upon them but thank god we have his promise fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom stay with the word of god keep that word as a shield between you and the devil oh praise god eve did not do that she let down her shield she let down the bars and the devil came right in oh praise god and when the church lets down her standards lets down the bar of the word of god then friends the depths and darkness of satan creeps right into the church of god but we thank god for this day that we're living in that he promised that at evening time it shall be light i accept that light i believe that light i trust you receive the truth of god's word i trust these bible studies will lift you up and bring you into a clearer reality of what god is saying in his word may the lord bless you today in a wonderful and marvelous way my friends i would like to remind you that we will have our church reopened again this coming sunday september 20th at 11 a.m 52 70 new street burlington ontario you are
