TRANSCRIPT
========================================
knowled about the Battle he knew that somebody coming up there was going to take a few shots and they're going to be wounded so he knew to lay out a bunch of those Med packs so that when people get there they're going to need it right so I said all of that about video games not a blanket endorsement for video games I said all of that to say that as we progress forward on the battlefield we begin to realize that if we look close enough God has ahead of time and he's laid for you right there exactly what so it can feel like the most terrible thing in the world I cannot believe this has happening to me I don't understand you stop for a moment and begin to look around what was the pastor preaching this Sunday what was being said to me I open the Bible and I'm starting to read and a lot of times they'll give me exactly what I need right when I need and he lays those things in place and guess what it's a characteristic of him that he's such a planner that he's always going to come on the scene now a lot of times we say but that God can come on the scene and and do a miracle he can just show up we say oh God please come on the scene right now I I I need healing my daughter needs healing my son's got a fever or this is happening and we we we think in terms of calling him down from Glory and he goes all right I I'll come down and heal your son and he gets up off the throne and he comes down the the golden stairs or whatever and this is all denominational mentality that we have of him getting up and having to come on the scene every time we do that because we know from precedent from scripture and from the prophet of the hour we already know that if you believe your healing is already done yes so there's a med pack laying there with your healing if you believe it that's right right all things are possible to them who believe and the med Pack's just laying there yes Hallelujah and you're like Lord please come on the scene my son he's got a fever or my daughter or I need healing for this or we need financial help for this and all all the time the med Pack's laying right there why because he knew from the end he knew the end from the beginning and he saw exactly where you're going to be right now right laid the M back out there yes sir and that's how a guy who's a sound man and a musician like me can stand up here and deliver a message today to you and I don't feel qualified at all to do that but I have complete confidence that there's a reason that before the foundation of the world God looked and he saw this service am and he knew where you are right now he knew everything about what you're going through right now and he took a sound man off the soundboard at his own church today and he said I'm going to send that guy up there because he's going to say something that's going to present it in just a way and you're going to receive that I'm your med back amen amen so yeah I'm a little bit nervous but I know that this is how God works so I don't know what it is that I'm going to say I don't know what it is that's going to reach you and help you and encourage you I'm not sure which thing I'm going to say might be something about important something I don't know but somehow some way God has an order that he does things and he knows that this service is going to happen I know that he's going to feed his people and I know that if I can just yield myself just let my mouth talk and let God speak through me let it happen I know that you're going to be blessed whatever you stand in need of today whatever you're up against he's already provided for now does that not give you a lot of confidence no worries right not at all why wor worry why worry at all you know that everything that you're ever going to go through he saw I saw one Minister one time explained this way if I had a frame uh of a uh a picture print frame and I held it up here and you're looking at my beautiful face to this picture for me yeah it's beautiful you're looking at me and if it's a portrait you're looking at me just the way I am right you can see me from one Vantage Point kind of two-dimensional but if I go like this and I'm hiding over here then people over there that are looking through the picture frame they might not be able to see me through the picture frame the people over there can because their Vantage Point can see me over here so if you can imagine that this picture is time that we live in the beginning of time that we know it and the end of time as we know it here in this earth right and Eternity is happening all back here inside the picture so God can take the you have to look at the picture and see what it sees in this moment in this time but God can go poke his head through the picture frame and look back beginning way back before time began and he can look Way Beyond over there what's going to happen way over there and he goes oh way down there I can see that the picture looks pretty good right now they're all dressed up they're all at church this Sunday morning everything's going pretty good but I know that Monday afternoon about 2:00 this brother is going to go through this last night we had an incident going back over to brother Danny's house uh where uh I'm sure who who was it that almost uh that got hit at the light there there were two trucks could get your daughter was driving right so he knows at a certain time of night a a couple pickup trucks are going to blow right through a red light knows exactly what's going to happen so he looks down there he sees that happening and he says okay well I know that's going to happen so what I'm going to do is I'm going to anoint the dad to say to his daughter hey you know what when you're sitting a light before you just take off take a look around because a lot of times these people blow through lights moments before it happens so God saw the coming evil and he goes oh that's happening there I will anoint this dad to say something that's going to save their lives amen amen don't underestimate the ability of those things to happen put something on your heart to say go ahead and say that amen amen so I can have a lot of confidence in my actions and and going forward not because I have confidence in me as handsome as I am uh it's not necessarily me I can just stand here and just say God can use me to say something for you and I trust him to do so you to do the same thing in the next slide here it says God sees the beginning and the ending of all things for Adam and Eve he saw what was happening in the garden he knew exactly what was going to happen and he provided a way he knew all of the everything that was going to have to be apparatus because he knew the fall was going to happen he knew these things were going to happen because he knew the attributes of himself had to be expressed in the end time and he knew that he wanted to develop this he wanted to have children he wanted to do these things so all of this he sees it coming and he lays in place a way of Escape uh and a way for them to have Seth if you understand what I'm saying he provided a way in Noah's day he planted a bunch of trees which were exactly the kind of trees that no one needed right where he could find them so he could build an ark and Float out of the FL you can believe it or not believe it but he built a pretty big boat there's a lot of trees in that thing right he provided he naturally provided something in this three-dimensional way he provided something that will fulfill what was going to happen as a way of Escape amen for Joshua he did for Rahab think about this a prostitute and he provides a way all those walls fall down and she's able to walk out of there and coming from that lineage comes Christ and everything else he provides a way of Escape for these things everybody else in J would die for David David anointed as a little boy D wanted to anoint Saul and Prophet comes out and says that God wants to anoint this little boy he has another plan because he knows the end from the beginning he knows if I'm going to anoint somebody I'm going to do it this way and what happens you realize where this goes with Saul and everything like that and all of the the years that happened of Saul being the the leader of the Israelites right all of this time that he happens and all the bad things that happen and the victories and the good time all of that stuff is Just Happening Here on the Earth but the anointing happened way back when he was a child so God already laid in place who this King was way back when and then you watch it long enough and it becomes manifest and it was God laying in place way back from the very beginning one of my favorite things to consider and this is basically en Closing one of my favorite things to consider is how he lays in place something for the Gentiles and the reason I get excited about that is I'm a gentile the Gentiles right so you watch all the historical precedent all through the Old Testament of God's people the Israelites and they're going through the motions and and they're going through experiences and everything and it's written here in this Bible and then New Testament rolls around here and Jesus is born comes on the scene and has a sacrifice the lamb led to the slaughter we all know and Spills his blood for us spills his blood for his people and US everybody in the entire world and then establishes in the New Testament and acts two establishes a church and sends his holy spirit to live in the church to live in the people and when he does he establishes this church why because he's looking at seven Church ages that are coming down the road amen and he establishes this and he shows us exactly what it's supposed to look like right he lays it there in place and says this is my original thought for this church this is what I want it to be and immediately we start to humanize right you see right away in the first AG they're already starting to go back to organizing it they go oh great God has given us this church well the first thing we should do is uh get organized here and God said no I just showed you that this is how I want the church to operate I want it to be led by the Holy Spirit and right away we start to go into these things and we start to see great men like Paul and and uh the John the uh out on the aisle of patmas writing these things right and we see even some people that may not be mentioned necessarily in scripture like polycarpon he one of my favorite historical figures because these are guys that fought against the whole idea of organizing this thing becoming an organized church but we see the grace of God that he laid in place this is what this original church is supposed to look like and it will again come back to that in the end time but it's been his plan all along this is what I want so then at the very tail end of what this book book that we hold today is a vision that God himself comes and he says it to ascribe on the aisle of pus write these things and he writes the story of what's going to happen from then until now until the last day right amen so here's John the Baptist Sitting on This Island and he's sitting there and he's writing and there's the angel there's God right there telling this is I'm writing this down because I need to put all of this in place so that my people when they come up on whatever they come up on already know that this is set in place and we're going to be just fine everything's fine she establishes what the church is going to be says this is what it's going to be and this is what you're going to go through all of these times he shows you everything that's going to happen through all the seven Church ages Paul and irenius and Martin and Columba and Luther and West and all of these guys that come through they have the same interesting that they have the same characteristics and interesting that they're still buffeted against and they're holding back against organized religion they're holding back against the Beast system he wants to come in and pervert that original church that he wanted to create there and as it flows through there's ups and downs and there's almost utter darkness and there's a little bit of light here and and there's this battling back and forth and God always continued God always active term God always puts his man on the scene he keeps putting his man on the scene and although he may take his man off off the scene he never takes a spirit right so it just flows right in from this man to that man to this man to that man and then we come down to here in this day and age you realize what you're a part of you realize what you're a part of if you go back into HEI where HEI talks about being the messenger with a message for God's people that's where this started when you go and present the message to somebody and say look you may look it up online and you may say all kinds of different things about what the message is but the message is you with I with people all the time been around the message their whole life and if I ask them can you define what the message is Give me a definition in 30 seconds tell me what the message of the hour is well you know I think it'll take longer than that really like and we got to talk about uh brother brandom and we got to talk about God sending a prophet we got to talk about all these things uh we got to talk about the healing campaigns and then we got to talk about this and that none of which is the message then we got to talk about creating squirrels we talk about stories and we got to talk about this and that we got to talk about the S visions and we got to talk about the mountain range that has this and that none of which is the message people try to define the message by what's happening right now the message started way way way way back it's a concept that started way back in the Old Testament HEI says I am God's messenger and I have God's message and I'm bringing it to the people amen so you're part of something that's a message and what is God laid his church in place established it there's your medack this is what this is the original and if anything needs to be cut it's to be cut to fit that and he puts it right there and then he writes in the book hey guys because he never would allow you to go through history without having a warning and without having some kind of way of establishing of knowing where the truth was he's always going to provide a way remember so all of this stuff begins to happen in history and he's done both he's established the church that there it is over there and then he points to it and says scribe write this down there's the original church and this is what's going to happen you're going to go through all these ages and all of this stuff is going to happen and then you're going to get down to the last age and I'm going to reveal a bunch of stuff to you and we're going to get down to the end of this thing and what's going to happen is emerging from history this church over here will be the same as that original church that I told you to keep in touch with right back there this church will manifest what acts 238 manifest because it has to because it's the Original Seed as it grows through the stages of the stock and the digging into the ground and hearing from the Sun and being drawn up watering and all of the things that happened to grow this thing eventually and then the shot comes up and everything like that but eventually emerging is the exact original SE that he said that's it and it pops up again here in the last day that's you because he's faithful to do it always so we've got our med pack there it is amen Hebrews 13:5 says let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for ye for he has said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee never he said he never would but I don't feel him very close I don't care what you feel respectful I don't care what you feel because he says I'll never leave you or forsake you Philippians 1 six be confident of this very thing that he which had begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ amen am amen amen has he begun has he begun work in you at all is there anybody here that's a new Christian just starting out no the young the young people maybe new Christian fairly new how one year praise the Lord let's give hand I didn't mean to embarrass you at all I'm sorry but what's so great is at the beginning of the work when I was there when I was way back there he began a work and then he keeps fulfilling fulfilling fulfilling fulfill and you know what he is going to see it completed all this to your complete Perfection like absolute perfection un unable because you're partaking from this original idea that God had when he established this church and you're beginning to manifest 2,000 years later you're manifesting the Original Seed that's right back there again and when it's fully manifest we're all going home praise God Amen do you believe it amen amen that's all that let me have the musicians come let's all sing God who is rich in Mercy amen he's rich in Mercy because it's hard for us sometimes we struggle through a lot of different things but God who is Rich and mercy he's going to see us through he's going to complete the work amen I hope that uh you you all were able to get something out of that amen be looking for those Med packs he laid him out there for you just around you can trust have complete confidence in him that whatever you're ever going to go through from now until your translation that he has already provided for you ahead of time amen now he'll come on the scene if you need him definitely do that cuz he loves you like crazy but he's already established and already laid in place what we need we just have to keep eating it keep partaking of it amen amen amen bless you Lord amen I I don't have a song already my Pro you everything he's already provided praise God Lord bless you please be seated we're so happy today um as our brother said that you know uh he wasn't really a preacher he's a Helper and actually he works in uh the sound in the area of being a sound man and he just told
