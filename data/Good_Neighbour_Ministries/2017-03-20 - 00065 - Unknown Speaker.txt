========================================
[Applause] we're not Christians but become a joy into the house of the Lord to give him praise and honor and Glory a wonderful worship service can you say [Applause] Amen we're happy to be here uh we feel a bit stared because middle of the week we had for service and some of you might have slimmed on a little bit but we're going to P them a little to grace of God hallelujah before I I go further um I don't know how many people in here maybe have an iPhone if you do have one I have a little dongle here I'd like to give away um it's just for charging the iPhone it's just small and easy to carry in a purse or a pocket and you can charge your iPhone quite easily with it praise God it's a lightning cable right just a little so if you have a you do have I I have some more in my office no that's all right um I have some more in my office there but I got it first maybe I have maybe about three or four more in my office so if there's anybody else see Breen Tim after the service give you H right I going to give give them to him and he can give it to you praise the Lord glad to see all of you and we can be here especially on this wonderful and precious day especially during this week we know it was uh women's day uh on the 8th and there was a celebration of Womanhood throughout the entire world however we understand that the world doesn't have a clear grip on the value of Womanhood praise the Lord um and that's what I want to talk about today and hopefully it will be a blessing to you and even to some people in the message they don't have a real Revelation and understanding of the value of a woman and of Womanhood and some women themselves have no idea idea of the value of their own Womanhood as I've always says I've always said uh sounds funny when I say that you got the power in your hands women have the power in their hands I mean you demonstrate your husband get a little annoyed you pass man just rubed his head and he's ready to swoop praise the Lord in the old days they would say he fall down you have to pass smelling socks but uh that is the fact um as such but some women don't understand their power and that they don't have to go in the way of a man who more than likely will get angry and raise his voice the Woman's power goes the opposite way when she is softer and tender uh some let but you don't know you know the Chinese have a proverb if you true enough eggs against a rock after time it will split that rock and that's the truth just throwing eggs you know they supposed to crack but don't you fool yourself after a while that rock is going to crack right just by throwing eggs so the opposite way praise God but uh let let's just pray cuz I find I'm just moving in there right now um and just uh read one scripture and and that we can stand for the reading of the scripture which is Proverbs and should be up there in front of you Proverbs 3110 praise the Lord praise God hallelujah can we read that together who can find a virtuous woman our value or price is far above rues which means to say she's Priceless brother BR put puts it this way if God could have given a man something better right he would have but he gave him a wife give Adam a wife and that's the value of a wife to a man praise the Lord let us pray our gracious God and Heavenly Father we pray for the opening of the understanding and pray that the great holy spirit will turn the key of David and open our hearts to receive the word sincerely solidly foundationally and may it f uh create a base uh for us to build our lives on we give you praise and honor and Glory today in Jesus name amen please be seated I continue I I would be lacking if I don't mention uh St Patrick's Day how many knows about St Patrick's praise God you don't have to be Irish you just have to be a Christian because as you know St Patrick was the uh the immediate disciple of St Columba is col right col colba sorry some um Columba and you know the story how you went to Ireland and uh they had a lot of snakes in those days in Ireland and God used them with the power of God and somehow he drove out the snakes right got rid of all the snakes now there isly if any snakes in England or Ireland maybe garden snakes but not in poison and God used them to spread the gospel among the Celtic people up there different ones he drew it up stood up against those true Wizards and witches God's power was with him so even though he was not like polycar also uh their names are not written in the Bible but they were like the immediate ones after The Messengers right they were just the first disciple and they were out there and they were mightly use of God their names are even recognized by the Catholic church because it's historical fact of how much power was displayed in their life in those days and times now we know the Irish uh celebrate him because he was an Irish saint and uh they might not know everything about him but the reason why we respect him and regard him and celebrate his life is because of how much God worked through him and used him for the spread of the gospel and touching the hearts of people changing lives changing uh an entire uh entire communities for God's glory okay so much for St Patrick we get back to our topic here of the value of Womanhood now um if you want to uh talk about something having value first of all we understand that um Satan Through the Ages have always tried to devalue devalue that's right the value of Womanhood and so in uh Jewish times and in Greek culture and many other cultures even African culture Chinese culture Indian culture many cultures not just those two that I'm singling out but all over uh the world in various and many cultures women um had a a very low uh value there was an extremely low view of women and women are were seen as property to be owned right they were seen as uh you know let me use the word property either by the father who could sell them off uh can I just talk frankly and practically here praise God hopefully that don't hurt anybody's feelings but if I do I still have to pra the word am but uh women were sold off like chaples by by husbands too can sell off their wife they don't like this one they sell her off buy another one and uh sell them off so some you sisters ought to be rejoicing today that that will happen anymore praise the Lord because men don't sell you off they can't sell you off or they would sell you off praise the Lord and Men you got to be happy that those days are not here anymore also praise God but that's the way it was amen women could not even go testify in the courts they could not inherit any property doesn't matter how rich their father was they were not in the line to receive an inheritance you know how it was it went to the eldest son and then it went down to the next son and so on down the line and um let's not go into that but the son can decide it to give it not to his next brother in life but to his eldest son and so and so on so there's a lot of unfairness and uh wrong things that were done back there amen also even to this modern times and these things I'm mentioning are still happening in certain parts of the world it's not like just ancient times is happening right now right where a boy uh child is Val more than a grandchild and um we see also that women had no claim or right to to to even think or talk of having any education they could not think about it matter of fact listen to One Jewish rabbi he said it is better to burn the Torah that to teach it to a woman that is how much they undervalued devalued uh women in that those days and in that time and to a great extent even to this day right under certain cultures now the Greeks had three reasons for gratitude and they were thinking their God that they were not made he didn't make them in the world as a beast or he didn't send them to the world as a woman or God help me he didn't send me to the world as a barbarian that's their idea of giving God glory Jews were thanking God daily that they were not made a slave they were not made a woman or a dog of a gentile they were thanking God for that now we know there's lots of talk about the hijab and all this stuff you know amongst the Muslims well it's not only amongst the Muslim amounts the really semi Orthodox Jews the women also go Veil right people may not talk about that but the Jews the real Orthodox original Jew je they their women have to be veiled where even their faces are not shown so that sometimes a man couldn't in a crowd of women he couldn't even recognize his own mother he couldn't recognize her because PA had on these uh veils and they had to go sit in a separate gallery of the women right and even to this modern time in certain churches even in certain message churches the women are on one side and the man is on one side is that right and um and the the preacher better not catch one of those men glancing over to the women's side or by say Vera it it's trouble right and know it sounds fun to us but now just imagine that was going on but the bad thing about it it's still going on Amen it's going on in certain countries right now and even in this North America some of those influences are still there Amen in certain churches and if I might divert a bit that has caused a lot of fear uh uh irrational fear and it's caused tension uh and problems even amongst uh young people and even older folk in some of the churches until uh men are scared to shake some of their sisters hands and sisters are scared to Shake The Man Hands I don't know like there's going to be some kind of transfer of something by just shaking the hand you know it's one thing if you shake their hand and then you h on to it anybody can tell that there's something going on there you know but a regular shaking of hands for politeness and and and showing the joy and the happiness of meeting a brother or a sister I wonder what they would do with the scripture when Paul said greet one another with a holy kiss well none of us know what the holy kiss was right if it was the oldfashioned women they just kiss the back of her hand or what it was we don't know what it was or if it was the Italian thing you know where part of russan the same European thing you you just touch you know cheeks one to side side and then touch the other side or whatever we don't know what it was but the fact is that today's culture is that you shake one another's hands and even to the shaking of hands the fake and sad sad say attitude to the point that you can't even you hardly can shake a Brother's hand or a sister's hand without some of these Pharisees eyes on you as if is some kind of crime being committed there's nothing wrong let me drive that spirit away if any of you have it there's nothing wrong with you shaking somebody's hand it's the attitude and intention in the heart and God sees and knows the heart praise the Lord and you're going to know when you over step your bounds you will know because God put a rooster inside to Pro that's your conscience and to warn you and to tell you when you have Ste those bounds but there's nothing wrong with that praise the Lord hallelujah now we know friends that in those days women had two choices to be a good woman and just pray and hope that the man that took her for wife or that she was sold to as a wife would be kind to her kind to her and love her and take care of her the other choice that a woman had in those days was to just throw off the veil and walk the streets and become a harlot those were the two choices only that women had in life back then that's the way it was matter of fact we find out that one musim man saw this Christian gentleman talking to his wife and you know they're talking and and they're walking and they're laughing and smiling together and he was so puzzled he came over and said why are you talking to that woman so much and iy was surprised he said I'm talking to her because she's my wife he said but you're spending so much time with her alone he said because she's my wife and he couldn't get con because he got so many wives right and he don't spend any time with any particular one of them you know uh like that so he doesn't know about having a real deep personal relationship and friendship that goes beyond uh just uh uh you know conjugal um friendship uh and love that's all all they think about or all they know they don't know that your wife is also your companion your wife is your friend your wife is your partner your wife is everything amen amen when she's there with you and we've got to understand that praise the Lord this be talking about woman's day amen and I know I'm preaching about the women but the men need to listen with the ears of wisdom and understanding and know exactly what they should do and how they should act for the glory of God Amen now we know that when we talk about women today and we look at the Bible we understand that God has a complete different view of women because you know he's my mother my father my sister and my brother he's everything to me is that right his name is called in the Old Testament Jehovah how many knows that you know Jehovah means uh the the Lord Our Savior but it also means the breast is God it means God who feeds his children by the breast right and according to our understanding through typology and science symbols the Old Testament is one breast and the New Testament is the other and he feeds us by by his word through the sincere milk of the word through these parts of the Bible the Old and the New Testament given to us for nutrition spiritually and to strengthen us along our life's journey do you believe that amen praise the Lord yes sir Hallelujah and so God in his word um has given women a high value however we do know that there were certain quarters that believe that Christianity is is a a fith that suppresses women they believe that Christianity is a a faith that restricts women and uh women can't come to their full potential in Christianity uh because of certain doctrines that are in the Bible but uh I'll put it to you that it's not the doctrines that are in the Bible but how men interpret the scriptures to the people that caus that uh kind of muddying up of the waters and fuzzing up of the clear light of the truth that is hidden in the word of God now we know that God created man in his own image and the Bible says male and female created he them amen praise the lord they're in my image but their forms outward natural forms may be different right one is male one is female it's just one was placed in a certain body the other one is placed in a certain body but they were made in His image yes male and female made he them praise the Lord glory to God that's Genesis 127 praise God so uh while we celebrate men that were in leadership praise God within the Bible we also find which is not talked about too much that there were women that were in leadership also in the Bible I'll backtrack a little bit you can go back brother to the um first slide just you know value of a woman just leave it there now I and so to this day even that persists and the reason why it persists is because of paulse teaching which tells you clearly that she shall not teach nor you serve Authority in the house of God okay she shall not teach nor you serve Authority in the house of God now some will interpret that in a way as to say that when we come to church like this women shouldn't be able to say anything you got no saying nothing and you should not be able to say anything matter of fact you should just keep quiet and have no place for you in here except to come and praise God and go home and prepare your dinners or whatever and that's about it but that's not the way God intended it in his word now we know that that scripture is telling you which is where I separate from the modern day Pentecostal is that a woman is cannot be ordained or was never ordained to go and preach the gospel for God's glory it's different a woman can go testify if there is no man in an area and woman has the gospel she has a right to teach the gospel but the moment a male figure Rises up then she needs to step back now in the case I know of various cases I know but I'll tell you one this woman was during the times of brother uh William Brandon and she was a great Bible speaker and teacher down in uh the South H and there she had a cute large church and was very well known and known by Brother Bram known to him known by him and had a great ministry but when she went to one of his meetings and he was teaching on these things and showing yes this is what they believe Pentecostals believe the women can just go and uh you know be preachers and be pastors and Bible teacher Bible teachers soal and and um going around like that right and he taught on the scriptures and said yes woman can go teach when there is no male figure around but once there is a male figure around that woman needs to uh let the man take the lead right now we find out that once she heard the gospel I'm not going to preach on that teach that now I'm just touching briefly on it um her grandson is brother Steven Shelly many of you don't know that name years ago she came home and Sunday the next Sunday she got on the pulpit and announced to the congregation that she would be stepping down and she' be handing the post of Pastor and Minister over to her grandson who was a great powerful preacher within a message singer and anointed of God God used him in a mighty way and from that day she sat down and listened to the gospel through her grandson until the Lord took her home and that church still is down in the South so there is a place for women in every single part of the church the only thing God say she should not she shall not teach nor you Ser Authority the positions the places in the church you will not teach nor userve Authority now not to spend time on that but look remember Miriam then Moses have to say Miriam um we just crossed the Red Sea so um I think we need some singing and worship and uh maybe today you should uh you know leave the worship right and you know that culture is still there that you can only have a male was leer ah I'm not going to have amen now but the fact is God anointed her amen and plac her there as a washing leer amen yes sir and uh the Bible said she began to worship god with the tambourine and the other women joined in with her and they were worshiping and praising God and she was in the position back then of leading the worship praise God some of you going to have to struggle with that until your mind all cleared up and everything else praise God hallelujah and what about you can find that in Exodus 15:20 right Mah 6:4 and also what about deorah Judges 4 to 5 4 uh advice God used her as a prophetess in those days when Israel had no prophet in the land God could only find a woman that he could use and he use her and her name was deor and she was used to give wisdom and knowledge to the king and the rest of the leaders of Israel she was bringing a revelation praise God hallelujah now listen my friends there was another woman in the Bible called H and she also was a prophetess and what about God using Esther to save the Jewish people at that time from one of their early uh Holocaust that would have happened with them right and God used es and she delivered the Lord helped her to deliver the entire Jewish people amen praise the Lord hallelujah now when we come to the New Testament we find a real shift from the culture in the treatment of women when Jesus came on the scene we find out uh you know while it's not a big deal to us now today back then was a big thing and it was almost like scandalous that a man would have a Ministry that women believed his message and were following following him around from place to place while he's preaching that was a big Scandal back then but Jesus had disciples and some of them were women and some of them were wealthy women and they support in this ministry and uh were there praise God because that time was a time when women were totally ignored they were totally ignored and plac in a corner but Jesus came on the scene and when he came on the scene he was the first to start ministering onto them amen amen he started ministering to these women and you know he healed Peter's mother-in-law you know he delivered the daughter of the cro fan woman from a demon you know he raised gyrus daughter from the dead you know that he healed the woman that had the hemorrhaging problem which she herself knew it that it wasn't right for her to even touch a man but nevertheless she believed he was Christ and she touched the H of His Garment and was made home now if God was against women then no woman would be healed none would be raised from the dead none would be delivered none would have a touch of his mighty hand amen but praise God forever more that is what he did Hallelujah he raised the wiow of son from they and also he was the one earli those days imagine it that he went to lazarus's house this was absolutely against the laws of the Jews to sit anywhere and to teach women the laws teach them the Torah and there he was teaching them the word of God thank you you just getting some insight why they call him a devil where they call him uh crazy they call him you know the and everything else because he was shattering the corse of their culture he was breaking the laws that were made by man and set place but it wasn't God's way because he was God in flesh amen and God in flesh came down and there he was uh showing his Val for women amen because a man he says it's not good for to be alone is that right Hallelujah God made Adam and then God split the and God it's the truth brother the Adam now you know there was Adam and there was Eve visually you see two persons but God said and he called their name ad Adam so the two made One MH is that right and now when we marry the two shall become one is that right y that means that a man is not complete within himself unless he has some woman in his life right praise the Lord I left that wi open to say a woman is like it could be his mother right but he had has to have some complimenting uh Womanhood in his life to uh polish off and to uh bring out certain potentials and certain emotions that he didn't even know he had is that right because it's all buried there so it takes a woman to bring out certain things from a man and enrich a man's walk in a man's life praise God of course we know we have the other side you know he says bad woman is like water in a man's blood that will weaken him and totally destroy him amen but he talks about a good woman is priceless and more so in today's world when you look around and see what is calling themselves a woman is that right oh yeah now you see your value is even increasing because it is becoming rare now now to go out there and even find a [Music] virgin because they're starting out uh life 9 10 I don't know wherever they just start like that and they have no real value of how prous they are right and what they value really in the world because Satan through his wickedness his Corruption of the human race has never valued Womanhood that's right until a women some women feel themselves of no value but brothers and sisters especially you sisters carry yourself with great pride I realize that you are of Great Value and dignity in this world and if nobody else values you God values you the brothers in this church have been taugh by the word God Amen if brother you sit there and you don't value your wife go back and take an account of yourself and of the word of God and B them with all your heart to the glory of God amen amen hallelujah praise God listen Jesus and a lot of women disciples women followers they learned from him and with him traveled with him at times supported him financially and then and you know the story of how he said I must needs pass through Samaria go sits on the well and and sits on the well and according to the time it was towards like 6:00 in the evening when it's just Twilight time getting dark and light when these uh men go to pick up prostitutes that was a time and there he goes and sits on the b a young man 31 years old the prime of his life and he sits on a well that time of the evening and he knows that that's the time when the women will go there to get water from the well right they don't go during the daytime as mainly in the evening then they would go so what's his purpose in going to this well to meet a woman you know see we don't know but we know that he was going to meet one particular woman he had and when he met the woman uh you know it sounded to her like this young man is making a move on her and said get get me some water to drink and you know what the scripture says she says why why would you a Jewish man you know speak to you speak to me as a amican woman what do you want with me in other words I know what you want and he says no no no no no he said says uh that water I can drink it and you know you drink it you'll be thirsty again but the water I want to give you you'll never thirst again amen says go bring your your husband you know the rest of the story have he says you spoke the truth because you had five but the one you're living now with is somebody else's hbal right that's why I come here to stop you cuz you're an elected seat and you were in my permissive will you're going down there doing that with single man but when you hit this now you're going into a married man there you're crossing a line a River of No Return so I come to stop him and you know the rest of it you know course she said he was just a Jewish man then the next thing you was you know I perceive you the prophet and and then later on she says is not this the Christ look how how how how her soul be opened up like a flower to receive the word of God Hallelujah from a man to a prophet to the Christ Hallelujah she caught the revelation of who he was amen and then it changed her life completely thank you and she repented and Dr home and as she was running home praise God forever more as I preached it some years ago she started to wipe the lipstick from off of her lips Hallelujah my God she started putting out a lot of the stuff she had in her hair that was for ction of man and all this stuff and thr It On The Ground all the Mars of a prostitute and everything she had she begin to rip it off and throw it off like like martinus after he was healed he throw off his diry Rags amen and that's what we all have to do off the dirty rags off the dirty rags that you may be wearing now and look to the Christ of God rep that turn of God and let him have his way in my lives for his amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen amen praise God hallelujah now we know women usually ignored by the culture can I pr some more usually ignored by the culture of that day and even in our day we don't want to go into the statistics but you know that men are being paid more than women how many knows that and a lot of times the women are smarter than the men the men are just sitting in a big chair there director this and that woman is doing all the work right manager this and that the other of course I'm not saying all men are like that there some me a lot of capable men and they deserve their position and stuff but there's other ones that are just filling a spot just because they're a man and they hold that position and the woman uh woman's labor intelligence knowledge wisdom is the value and they don't see the real value to it uh they just want them to stay right where they are and pay them less than what you pay a man I believe in equal pay for equal work how many believes that amen praise the Lord hallelujah I don't want you Brothers raising your hand because your wife is going to see you right that you don't to leave in equal pay for equal work but the fact is if you should believe in equal pain for equal work praise the Lord hallelujah amen you know Paul said it in Christ there is no male and female is that right in Christ there is no male and female where it comes to that praise the Lord but we find out in Jesus's last hours it was mainly women that were there it was mainly women that was there it was one woman was at when Mary and others that were there around cross and even when he raised from the dead it was a woman that went there first is that right it was a woman that went there first praise God and thank God we have we have a a a preacher in this church by the name of Phillip there was one in the New Testament only difference is that one had3s or whatever that prophesied yes he's not going to go that far [Music] but the fact is 13 of them and each one had a spirit of Prophecy amen now some of the churches don't believe that Spirit should is even operating on anybody for that matter and some don't believe it operates on women it only ought to be on men but God's spirit God is not a god of partiality he sends his rain under justly unjustly the grass the weed and the wheat and everything amen what what you do with it is what he's going to be looking at praise the Lord right amen but the fact is God is ready to anoint everybody that will surrender their Liv and service to him praise the Lord glory to God I'm not really preaching I'm taking my time and uh bringing this out so that you might benefit from it for the glory of God so we know that uh that uh the only people that never abandon the abandon the Lord right Peter you know how many knows Peter ran away how many knows Jesus said all all has forsaken me they all forsook him and fled everybody fled for their life praise the Lord but what happened Mary and other women stopped by him is that right and even though they were looked upon as the least in society they were the first at that cross amen amen they were right there with the word and to this day women was still number men in the church you noticed that right even to this day women of numbered men in the church because they have that uh pension for that desire for Faith they really catch a general Revelation you can't take it out to them they hold W with an unchanging hand that's right amen praise God because God places in there amen glory to his wonderful precious name amen praise God Amen yes sir Hallelujah God of course proclaimed the resurrection to the rest of the disciples it was a woman that brought the first resurrection message of course she's the type of the church that wants to carry the resurrection message and is carrying the resurrection message Hallelujah but you see God always and simplicity and reveals himself in the same and he chooses the weak things of the world right and the foolish names of the world to confound the wise amen and those that believe that they're strong Hallelujah if you go to the book of Acts we know that up in the upper room there wasn't men alone so obviously the disciples had caught on to Jesus's teaching because really men and women should not be in the one room worshiping or praying or reading scriptures or anything like that so but when you read the book of Acts you find out Mary and other women were in that room in that upper room and I've been in Jerusalem and we've been to the upper room those of us who been there we've been to the upper room it's not a big huge room the room may be about uh a third of the size of this Sanctuary here so that you you can imagine 100 of them and they were close uh close together all praying and shouting and praising God and stuff like that but the disciples had caught the Revelation and so women were permitted to be with them praise the Lord who can find a virtuous woman and for price is far above rubies today amen God is looking for women of virtue today and like I just said the it it's very rare and hard to find women of virtue today cu the devil saw the valued Womanhood until like I repeat men hardly can value their lives the way they really should glory to God Jesus said the Earth come when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him praise God hallelujah we need a lot of women that will make a difference in this hour what am I saying sisters you need to step up you don't need to step back in the shadows right forget it even if Brothers in the message are preaching it like that you need to step back in the shadows and and just be there no you need to step up God did not place you on the man's head to rule over him neither did he place you under the man's feet to be a this that he can step on but he took you from the man's side so that you would stand beside himen and be M that's there to help or a help me and that is where the woman's placing is to Stand By Your [Music] Man I know sometimes I say things but uh Stand by Your M brother puts it away and the bright Stand St with the word stand by the word amen amen standing the promises of Christ your king Hallelujah what's the right
