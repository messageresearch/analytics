[23:17] brother
[23:19] Hallelujah I am happy to be the Son of
[23:25] God there's nothing on this Earth here
[23:30] that you can achieve better than that
[23:34] because you are seal till the day of
[23:38] your the
[23:40] Redemption and the Bible said when we
[23:43] read the word of
[23:45] God he talks about the false prophet
[23:50] false pastor but thank God he has given
[23:55] us a
[23:57] Shepherd a p Pastor who is
[24:01] Anointed by the Living God the great
[24:04] Holy Spirit he said I will not leave you
[24:07] nor forsake you till the end of this
[24:11] world and we are going
[24:14] home he's preparing us Jeremiah Was A a
[24:20] great
[24:22] prophet a true anointed
[24:25] Prophet why God saying that because in
[24:31] the olden days God had
[24:35] prophets and they have false prophet
[24:38] since from the beginning and they never
[24:42] never quit who was that that's Satan but
[24:45] let let me tell you they were all
[24:48] anointed by the word of God too don't
[24:51] think that somebody is fult but he's not
[24:54] anointed he's anointed but he cannot
[24:56] live by the word of God
[24:59] the only way you can see the false
[25:02] prophet because he cannot live by what
[25:05] he preached he cannot live by the word
[25:08] of God
[25:10] hallelujah God is Raging war against the
[25:14] false pastors and
[25:16] anointed anointed Ministries who are
[25:21] destroying and Scatter the children of
[25:25] God around the word It Started from the
[25:28] beginning beginning and is still here
[25:30] now so when God give you a pastor who is
[25:34] Anointed by the Holy Ghost preaching the
[25:37] word of God you have to be thank
[25:41] God because it's not
[25:45] easy for the job God has placed in their
[25:49] heart to be a pastor or a prophet is not
[25:52] a just a job it's God they are God
[25:57] representative
[25:58] call yes it's a calling as a brother
[26:02] said they are God
[26:05] representative you don't take them
[26:09] lightly and he
[26:13] said no matter
[26:16] where the people or God people has
[26:20] scattered the pastors has scattered
[26:23] them because of why the false teaching
[26:27] they can't leave by the word of
[26:30] God because what they are not filed with
[26:34] the Holy Ghost
[26:36] because they themselves are not of
[26:40] God it's like
[26:43] bam you know the BAM was anointed he was
[26:47] a true Prophet from the
[26:49] Israel but what happened at the end he
[26:52] spoke with what
[26:55] donkey could you imagine that a prophet
[26:58] of God speaking with
[27:01] donkey why that shows you how
[27:06] serious God is about his word God does
[27:11] no joke about his word his word is
[27:15] absolute God created this word here by
[27:19] the spoken
[27:22] word let there be light and there was
[27:26] light and let me tell you
[27:29] the first day God spoke the word of God
[27:32] it does not
[27:33] change it's still the same thing
[27:37] yesterday today and
[27:40] forever remember when the apostles
[27:43] started this
[27:45] gospel whatever they taught whatever
[27:48] they preach is the same thing
[27:51] today they spoke the word of God with
[27:56] anointing to the people
[27:59] and the word penetrate down to their
[28:03] heart and the Bible said those word one
[28:07] day 3,000
[28:09] Souls do you think is just a mind
[28:14] word the word that is in you the word
[28:18] that is in your mouth is the same thing
[28:22] that was in Peter's
[28:24] mouth the same thing that was in Paul's
[28:27] mouth
[28:28] the same thing that was in Matthew the
[28:31] same thing that was
[28:34] in our our Prophet William
[28:38] Braham it never
[28:40] changed and God said he will give a
[28:45] Shepherd the anointed Shepherd and he at
[28:48] the same time he said there is false
[28:52] teachers false
[28:54] prophet as I said how can you identify
[28:57] them
[28:58] sometime you go you witness to
[29:01] people they same they ask you a question
[29:05] how do you think your church only is the
[29:09] the good church in this world
[29:13] no my church is not a good church the
[29:15] church itself is not a the Holy Ghost is
[29:20] important the Holy Ghost is important
[29:24] without the Holy Ghost the people will
[29:26] perish without the Holy Ghost the church
[29:29] will not function the way supposed to be
[29:34] functioned because the Holy Ghost
[29:36] started the
[29:38] church the Bible said they were all
[29:40] anointed in the day of Pentecost in the
[29:43] upper
[29:44] room
[29:46] right and they came out spoke one
[29:51] language because God is one and when he
[29:56] speak he speak his word is one word he
[29:59] doesn't go back and change that word
[30:02] that word remained the same yesterday
[30:05] today and
[30:07] forever so God
[30:11] said the people have scattered all over
[30:13] the
[30:15] world and he will send the
[30:17] shepherd to bring
[30:20] them in he will call them and they will
[30:24] not what lack no wisdom
[30:28] nothing you will not lack no wisdom
[30:32] tonight I encourage you do not
[30:35] underestimate
[30:37] yourself God is with you it doesn't
[30:41] matter how much somebody look at
[30:45] you you speak the word of
[30:48] God I see I think all the ministers y
[30:53] year and you saw too the testimony that
[30:56] comes to that chch this The church
[30:59] here this church is not
[31:02] small but what makes it great God makes
[31:05] great because God is
[31:10] here CU God always want his people to
[31:15] stay with his word do you think we come
[31:18] here just to see one another for
[31:20] Fellowship we come here to meet God
[31:25] himself do you believe God is here
[31:29] if God could open one of us eye to see
[31:33] the where the pillar of fire is hanging
[31:36] right here oh glory to God the pill of
[31:39] fire is hanging here I believe in my
[31:44] heart because God said he doesn't break
[31:47] his word wherever two or three people
[31:50] are gathered together in his name he is
[31:52] in their
[31:54] mid so there's no one time we ever
[31:58] ourself here without
[32:00] God because our heart God has cleansed
[32:04] our heart and bur our hearts together
[32:09] with his word and God always back up his
[32:15] word the TR the the false Pastor he can
[32:19] preach the word of God he can say
[32:22] anything but he cannot stay with the
[32:25] word of God
[32:28] he cannot stay with the word of
[32:31] God he going to tell the people go and
[32:34] baptize in the name of the father and
[32:35] the Son and the Holy Ghost that's
[32:40] contrary he can say so many things you
[32:43] got you got to tell
[32:44] oh the Bible said a woman shouldn't
[32:47] preach he said oh nowaday things change
[32:51] there's more education Women are Smarter
[32:53] than the men so the woman can preach the
[32:56] Bible said no no matter how much he she
[32:59] smart he said thou shall not
[33:03] teach if you have anything teach your
[33:06] children at home respect your husband
[33:10] obey your
[33:11] husband live with
[33:14] happily that's yours that's your
[33:18] job praise God it's
[33:21] simple because why he said the woman was
[33:26] sin the man man didn't do
[33:29] that so everyone the woman has his curse
[33:33] and the man has his own curse too so
[33:36] there's difference between man and woman

[42:47] way we can have to the this church
[42:50] here is a Missionary
[42:54] church this church is been known are
[42:57] around all
[43:00] over because why we have anointed
[43:04] pastors who are seeking for The Lost
[43:08] Ones the scattered ones around those
[43:13] countries so because if you go and you
[43:18] Minister over there and somebody catch
[43:20] it the same person will go to another
[43:23] place and do what calling them out
[43:29] and the only way the missionary can go
[43:32] is when we
[43:34] give little by
[43:38] little the church doesn't plead for
[43:40] money but they preach the word of
[43:46] God somebody can say oh this church they

[1:09:37] Hallelujah you you want me to read or
[1:09:39] you going to pray the
[1:09:55] and he had a citrus farm and he had a
[1:09:58] tree there which was an orange tree that
[1:10:00] was bearing
[1:10:01] grapefruits and
[1:10:03] lemon tangerin
[1:10:06] tangelos and I forget how many different
[1:10:09] fruits there was on that one
[1:10:11] tree and I said to the the the man I
[1:10:16] said how is it what kind of a tree is
[1:10:19] that he said the tree itself is an
[1:10:22] orange
[1:10:23] tree I said what has it got grapefruits
[1:10:27] on it why has it got lemons on it he
[1:10:30] said they're
[1:10:31] grafted into
[1:10:34] it I said I see well now I said now next
[1:10:39] year when that tree comes forth with
[1:10:41] another crop of fruit which he all right
[1:10:44] about the same time I said then it will
[1:10:48] bring forth allog together oranges if
[1:10:50] it's a naval orange tree it'll bring
[1:10:52] forth the naval oranges won't it sir he
[1:10:54] said no
[1:10:56] there every grafted Branch will bring
[1:10:59] forth of its
[1:11:01] kind I said you mean that lemon Vine
[1:11:04] will bring forth the lemon out of that
[1:11:07] orange tree he said yes
[1:11:09] sir will the great fruit bring forth a
[1:11:12] grapefruit out of that orange tree said
[1:11:14] yes sir that's the nature of the
[1:11:18] branches grafted into it I said praise
[1:11:23] be to God
[1:11:26] he said what do you mean I said one more
[1:11:29] question now will that orange tree ever
[1:11:33] bring forth oranges again he said when
[1:11:36] it puts forth another
[1:11:38] Branch when it puts forth another Branch
[1:11:43] not when one's grassed into it but
[1:11:45] they're all citrus
[1:11:48] fruit and they live off of the Citrus
[1:11:51] life that's in the citrus tree
[1:11:55] I said there you are the Methodist will
[1:11:58] bring forth Methodist every time the
[1:12:01] Baptist will bring forth Baptist every
[1:12:03] time the Catholic will bring forth
[1:12:05] Catholic every time but the Church of
[1:12:08] the Living God will produce Christ from
[1:12:11] the root the word every time if it ever
[1:12:14] puts forth another Vine of its
[1:12:19] own now you can craft it in there you
[1:12:22] see every grapefruit lemon
[1:12:25] tangelo Tangerine whatever the citrus
[1:12:28] fruits they are every one of them can
[1:12:31] live in that tree but bearing false
[1:12:34] witness of the tree living by the tree
[1:12:38] yes Lord you see it they are living and
[1:12:42] thriving on the genuine life that's in
[1:12:45] that
[1:12:46] tree now there's Matthew 24
[1:12:51] 24 living by the same life
[1:12:57] but they
[1:12:58] wasn't right at the beginning they're
[1:13:01] bearing false witness of that
[1:13:04] tree it's an orange
[1:13:07] tree yet it's a citrus tree and they say
[1:13:11] this church this
[1:13:13] denomination is bearing record of
[1:13:17] Christ and got a false
[1:13:19] baptism false witness of the word trying
[1:13:23] to say that the power of God was only
[1:13:25] for the
[1:13:27] disciples Jesus himself said go ye into
[1:13:30] all the world and preach the gospel that
[1:13:33] every Branch that'll every tree ever
[1:13:35] bring
[1:13:36] forth every branch that will be in the
[1:13:40] tree and these signs shall follow the
[1:13:44] genuine
[1:13:45] branches where as long as it's a tree as
[1:13:49] long as is putting forth branches to the
[1:13:51] end of the world in my name they shall
[1:13:55] cast out Devils speak with new tongues
[1:13:57] take up serpents drink deadly things lay
[1:14:00] hands on the sick and they shall
[1:14:02] recover see the hour We're
[1:14:05] living see what Jesus said remember this
[1:14:08] is at the end time not back under westle
[1:14:12] back there now at the end time this was
[1:14:14] to take
[1:14:16] place now watch the scriptures let them
[1:14:21] testify Jesus said search the scriptures
[1:14:25] for in them you think or believe that
[1:14:28] you have eternal life and they are the
[1:14:30] ones that testify of me Amen in other
[1:14:35] words if this tree ever brings forth a
[1:14:40] branch I am the the
[1:14:44] vine the
[1:14:46] tree ye are the
[1:14:49] branches he that believeth in me the
[1:14:51] works that I do shall he do also St John
[1:14:56] 14:12 now he that abideth in me he that
[1:15:01] him that was in my
[1:15:05] root at the beginning that's the reason
[1:15:09] Jesus was both the root and offspring of
[1:15:12] David he was before David in David and
[1:15:15] after
[1:15:16] David both root and offspring of David a
[1:15:21] Morning Star the rose of Sharon the
[1:15:24] valley Alpha and Omega Father Son and
[1:15:27] Holy Ghost in him dwells the fullness of
[1:15:30] the godhead
[1:15:33] bodily both root and offspring of David
[1:15:38] he that is the elected life the
[1:15:42] predestinated life that's in me and he
[1:15:45] is the
[1:15:47] word from the beginning when he comes
[1:15:50] forth he'll bear my
[1:15:53] fruit St John
[1:15:57] 14:12 but others will live by the same
[1:16:00] thing call themselves Christians and
[1:16:03] Believers not all the say Lord
[1:16:07] Lord now this is the take place and be
[1:16:10] manifested in the last days when the
[1:16:13] mysteries of God should be finished as
