[0:14] welcome friends
[0:16] praise be to our god
[0:19] indeed jesus is coming soon
[0:23] morning or night and or noon
[0:26] oh praise god
[0:28] it may be at the midnight hour
[0:32] but
[0:33] jesus can come at any time
[0:36] so may our hearts be ready
[0:39] may we be prepared praise god hallelujah
[0:44] as you know
[0:46] when we come together like this on
[0:50] wednesday
[0:51] evening
[0:53] it is a time of feeding on the word of
[0:56] god amen
[0:59] now when
[1:01] these studies are brought
[1:04] i am not here trying to bring an
[1:07] in-depth
[1:08] study
[1:10] on any individual
[1:13] subject
[1:14] i am just covering the
[1:17] seven church ages
[1:21] of the book of revelation one two three
[1:25] now remember there are various doctrines
[1:27] that will be touched on doctrine of the
[1:30] serpent seed doctrine of the godhead
[1:33] doctrine of the nickelodeons doctrine of
[1:36] balaam
[1:37] and balaamism book of life
[1:40] you know judgment hell different
[1:43] doctrines
[1:45] but i am not going into any in-depth
[1:50] teaching on those individual doctrines
[1:55] i am teaching enough to spark your
[1:59] interest
[2:01] and to draw you to a place of
[2:04] inspiration
[2:07] where you
[2:09] can do an in-depth study on whatever
[2:12] particular subject
[2:14] that the spirit of god will lead you to
[2:20] i've been blessed by hearing one of
[2:23] brother
[2:24] uh telling me
[2:26] that he was inspired of god and led to
[2:29] do
[2:30] a particular study on a particular
[2:33] subject and i rejoice at that and i
[2:36] thank god for that because that is
[2:39] exactly
[2:40] what we
[2:42] want to accomplish
[2:44] not to just uh give you
[2:48] uh a table just filled with all the good
[2:52] things of god
[2:53] but just enough to whet your appetite
[2:57] to stir up your hunger
[3:00] and your thirst and desire after god
[3:03] that it will
[3:05] drive you back to
[3:08] the sermons
[3:10] the scriptures
[3:11] and that you will search them
[3:15] for in them
[3:16] you think you have eternal life
[3:20] may the spirit of god take his word
[3:23] and identify to you
[3:26] that you are one of his own
[3:30] i'm going to continue
[3:32] teaching
[3:34] on the seven church ages
[3:36] and tonight in particular
[3:40] the warning
[3:42] to the age of sardis
[3:45] warning
[3:46] to the age of sardis
[3:50] this is found in revelation
[3:52] chapter 3
[3:54] verse 2.
[3:57] let us read the word of god
[4:01] be watchful
[4:03] and strengthen
[4:05] the things which remain
[4:08] that are ready to die
[4:11] for i have not found thy works
[4:16] perfect
[4:18] before god
[4:20] gracious heavenly father
[4:23] thy word has been read
[4:27] now let the bread be broken
[4:30] as we commit our hearts and lies to thee
[4:34] for this brief moment of time
[4:37] take praise honor and glory
[4:40] with the opening of thy word
[4:42] in jesus name
[4:44] amen
[4:45] the warning
[4:47] to sardis
[4:50] now of course
[4:51] you're aware that the age of
[4:54] sardis is the age of reformation
[5:01] it speaks of the time of reformation
[5:05] and of course
[5:07] the age of reformation is just
[5:11] the start or the beginning
[5:14] of the
[5:15] full restoration
[5:17] that god promised
[5:19] to his church
[5:21] saying
[5:22] i will restore saith the lord
[5:26] that is a promise from god
[5:29] and to begin that restoration
[5:32] god started it
[5:35] with
[5:36] a
[5:36] reformation so reformation
[5:40] which will
[5:41] later lead
[5:43] to the fullness
[5:46] of restoration thanks be to god
[5:49] strengthen
[5:51] that which remains
[5:53] that is ready to die
[5:56] so
[5:57] immediately
[5:59] there's something missing
[6:01] god is saying there is some uh important
[6:05] quality
[6:06] or element
[6:08] some
[6:09] spiritual deficiency
[6:12] was in this age
[6:14] uh
[6:15] that
[6:16] was causing the age
[6:19] to die
[6:20] just as anyone can suffer from a
[6:23] vitamin or vitamin uh deficiency
[6:27] of some important
[6:29] vitamin that you should have in your
[6:32] constitution in your body
[6:35] this age
[6:37] was suffering from deficiency
[6:41] this age my friends as we will show
[6:45] with this deficiency
[6:48] was an age
[6:50] brought to reformation
[6:52] by the revelation through the messenger
[6:56] martin luther
[6:58] however
[6:59] the age was unfulfilled
[7:03] and the age
[7:05] was deficient
[7:07] in that it did not go on
[7:10] to
[7:11] sanctification
[7:13] and later on
[7:14] to the baptism of the holy spirit
[7:18] now
[7:19] that in itself
[7:20] shows the deficiency
[7:23] in that particular age
[7:27] also in this age of sardis they had the
[7:32] word the written word was restored back
[7:35] to them
[7:36] remember we uh teaching on how the word
[7:40] was locked away from the people pat
[7:43] locked in the pulpits behind the doors
[7:46] of uh
[7:47] seminaries and and monasteries and and
[7:51] god after wild
[7:53] opened up the door
[7:55] and then the printing uh presses began
[8:00] to roll and the bibles began to be
[8:04] printed and the word
[8:06] began to spread
[8:09] and as such
[8:11] the the people now had access
[8:14] to the written word
[8:17] they had access to the written word but
[8:19] they my friends they did not have a full
[8:23] revelation of the word of god
[8:27] which was yet to come
[8:29] neither they were deficient
[8:32] in the works of christ
[8:35] amen
[8:36] for remember
[8:37] that the church is the temple of the
[8:40] living god
[8:42] and when a church is filled with the
[8:44] holy ghost then it produces the works of
[8:47] christ for christ in you
[8:50] is your hope of glory
[8:52] christ in the church
[8:54] and the kingdom is being
[8:57] restored back to its
[8:59] original
[9:00] works amen
[9:02] when the jesus christ
[9:05] in the form of the holy spirit
[9:08] was in the early church
[9:11] the spirit of god fell
[9:15] the anointing of god was with them in
[9:18] them working through them hallelujah
[9:21] amen back in that church
[9:24] at pentecost
[9:26] hallelujah we saw the works of god the
[9:29] crippled walk the blind saw the dumps
[9:33] spake the word was preached in power and
[9:37] an anointing
[9:38] jail houses rocked and shook with the
[9:42] testimonies of the grace of almighty god
[9:46] but this age
[9:48] did not have those work works of god
[9:51] it was deficient
[9:54] in
[9:55] the inspiration
[9:57] of going beyond the just shall live
[10:01] by faith
[10:03] that was a wake-up call for the church
[10:06] that was just the beginning
[10:08] as i've said a reformation
[10:12] leading later on to the fullness
[10:15] of restoration
[10:18] oh praise god hallelujah yes sir
[10:22] god
[10:24] wanting to restore his people
[10:27] back from those dark ages
[10:30] of the depth
[10:32] of the blackness darkness ignorance and
[10:35] cruelty
[10:36] of the depths of satan
[10:39] god wanted to bring them back to the
[10:42] light of christ the light of the word
[10:45] back to the depths of god by the
[10:49] revealing of the word of god and to
[10:53] bring them back to what the apostles had
[10:57] on the day of pentecost and thereafter
[11:02] with the presence of their messenger
[11:05] paul the mighty apostle of the lord
[11:08] jesus christ
[11:10] now in this second verse we read
[11:14] for i have not found thy works
[11:19] perfect before god
[11:22] amen
[11:23] not perfect
[11:27] in other words
[11:29] unfulfilled
[11:30] not perfect meaning
[11:32] that the age
[11:34] is unfulfilled
[11:38] hallelujah it was just the
[11:40] start it did not fulfill
[11:44] all god had in his thoughts
[11:46] but it started the restoration
[11:50] with a move
[11:51] of
[11:52] reformation amen hallelujah
[11:56] it started out
[11:58] with the doctrine
[12:00] that they just
[12:03] shall live
[12:04] by faith
[12:06] hallelujah
[12:08] the doctrine of justification
[12:11] which in actual fact was it was and is
[12:14] the teaching
[12:16] that salvation
[12:19] is all of god
[12:21] salvation by grace through faith
[12:25] not by the works of man
[12:28] not by the will of man
[12:31] not by the figments of the imagination
[12:34] or the proliferation of the production
[12:37] of man's
[12:39] intellectual
[12:40] capacity to produce such things
[12:44] but salvation
[12:46] is by the grace of god alone
[12:49] hallelujah
[12:51] there's nothing
[12:53] we as humans
[12:55] can add to the salvation for jesus did
[13:00] a perfect work glory to god hallelujah
[13:05] and no works of man can be added to that
[13:09] martin luther by that also taught
[13:13] the sovereignty of god hallelujah
[13:17] he also believed in thought
[13:20] and taught election
[13:23] hallelujah
[13:25] god by election
[13:27] brings you into his kingdom praise god
[13:32] and because he knew that all we have now
[13:36] is all by grace
[13:39] it's all by god's grace the richness
[13:43] of his grace
[13:45] and mercy
[13:47] is what has drawn us
[13:49] and brought us
[13:50] back into his marvelous kingdom
[13:54] hallelujah
[13:55] martin luther also
[13:58] on the inspiration
[14:00] of this very doctrine
[14:02] by god's word the discerner
[14:06] was able to separate
[14:10] ecclesiastical
[14:11] hierarchy
[14:13] from ruling over the people of god
[14:17] amen
[14:19] and
[14:20] he was so as we will say in our parlance
[14:23] our way our day
[14:25] he was so fired up and ready to go
[14:29] that he tore down the idols
[14:32] he tore them down smashed them broke
[14:36] them wherever he could find them and got
[14:40] rid of the idols
[14:42] he also preached
[14:44] against
[14:45] confessions
[14:47] being given to priests
[14:49] sinful men
[14:51] like yourself
[14:53] confessing to them
[14:55] and offering up yourself as a prisoner
[14:59] for blackmail a prisoner for persecution
[15:03] a prisoner for many other things that
[15:07] one can expand upon from that point of
[15:10] view
[15:11] and also crowning to it he denounced the
[15:15] pope
[15:16] he denounced
[15:18] the pope of that day
[15:21] and that time hallelujah it was
[15:24] wonderfully good it was a marvelous
[15:27] start but that's what it was
[15:31] this
[15:32] reformation
[15:34] was good
[15:35] but it was only the beginning
[15:38] of the great promise of restoration
[15:43] that was
[15:44] to come hallelujah in other words it was
[15:47] as if god was saying
[15:50] luther i am going to
[15:53] let you start things
[15:56] but you're not going to see everything i
[15:58] have in my mind fulfilled in your age
[16:02] but you are going to be
[16:03] the first one
[16:05] for these days
[16:07] carrying the baton
[16:10] which you will have to pass on
[16:12] to john wesley
[16:15] god isn't actually telling that but i am
[16:19] just uh
[16:20] vocalizing in a way for you to
[16:23] understand
[16:25] what it is
[16:26] god was saying
[16:28] your age is unfulfilled
[16:31] those that are coming after you will
[16:34] carry on the work but at the end of the
[16:37] way
[16:38] you will see
[16:39] the fullness of the word for when we
[16:42] come to the fullness of church ages the
[16:45] time
[16:46] amen when the angel would put one foot
[16:49] on the land and one on the sea
[16:52] cry and swear by him that liveth forever
[16:56] and ever that time shall be no more
[17:00] meaning
[17:01] that the church ages have come to their
[17:05] fullness
[17:06] and to their end
[17:09] at that time
[17:10] of course we see the fullness of
[17:14] restoration
[17:15] we see god's people brought back to
[17:18] their original position
[17:20] hallelujah
[17:22] amen oh praise god god was telling
[17:26] luther in a nice way
[17:28] martin i'm leaving the rest of it for
[17:32] later hallelujah
[17:35] i tell you friends our god reigns i said
[17:40] our god reigns hallelujah amen and god
[17:45] knows the end from the beginning
[17:48] luther
[17:50] was the messenger
[17:53] to th this age
[17:55] of sardis
[17:57] and many times
[17:59] a messenger
[18:01] doesn't look like a messenger or appear
[18:05] to be
[18:06] a messenger
[18:08] like that you see
[18:10] we when you look at looter and you
[18:13] search the
[18:14] histories
[18:16] and biographies
[18:18] of this man
[18:20] and uh
[18:21] records
[18:23] about him
[18:25] he had his own
[18:27] personal flaws
[18:29] but despite his flaws
[18:33] that is the one man
[18:36] surrendered enough that god
[18:39] saw fit
[18:40] that he could use him in that age to
[18:44] fulfill his will and to bring about his
[18:49] purpose
[18:50] and so despite his flaws
[18:52] god
[18:53] used martin luther hallelujah and that
[18:58] my friends is a principle we must always
[19:01] look at
[19:03] because many look on men of god
[19:07] and search through
[19:09] what they are saying search through
[19:11] their lives search through their
[19:12] background search through everything
[19:15] thinking that they're gonna find no
[19:17] flaws
[19:18] but god
[19:20] hides in simplicity
[19:22] and reveals himself in simplicity
[19:26] god the perfect one
[19:29] manifest through the imperfect
[19:32] so that you could recognize
[19:36] that
[19:37] it's not just that man
[19:39] it's god working through an imperfect
[19:42] vessel
[19:43] to bring about his glory
[19:46] in the bible we are told
[19:48] that there was the prophet jonah
[19:53] and how jonah had flaws in his life
[19:57] for when god told him
[20:00] in the bible
[20:01] amen
[20:03] to
[20:03] go
[20:05] and do this
[20:06] he runs the opposite way
[20:09] and finds himself
[20:12] in the belly
[20:13] of a whale
[20:15] and many people are finding themselves
[20:18] in untenable circumstances and
[20:20] situations and uh as if to say in the
[20:23] belly of the whale
[20:26] you look up there's nothing to see you
[20:28] look behind there's nothing you look
[20:30] forward there is a dark tunnel you look
[20:33] behind it's dark you look beside it's
[20:35] dark seaweed's all around you you're in
[20:38] the belly of a great fish
[20:41] my friends
[20:43] many find themselves that way
[20:46] but god is still working
[20:49] with our imperfections and flaws he is
[20:52] still working on a building
[20:55] or praise god for he is building his
[20:58] building on a shore foundation
[21:00] the foundation is the perfection glory
[21:03] to god hallelujah amen god knows
[21:08] them that are his hallelujah and god
[21:13] knows what he wants to do with his own
[21:17] praise god you know how abraham lied
[21:21] moses got angry
[21:24] david with his flaws when you go over
[21:27] and see
[21:28] various ones through the bible but never
[21:31] mind their flaws god worked through them
[21:36] for his glory amen oh my glory to god my
[21:40] actual fact god sometimes used the flaws
[21:44] that you will look at criticize
[21:46] oh my and hide behind that
[21:51] even when jesus came
[21:53] the bible says there was nothing to be
[21:55] desired of him
[21:57] and god was hiding in the simplicity
[22:00] of that appearance
[22:03] that was not humanly attractive
[22:07] but only to those
[22:09] who had elected
[22:11] seed life of god within them praise god
[22:15] and god will work with that principle
[22:19] until the consummation
[22:21] of all ages
[22:23] working true flawed messengers of whom
[22:26] he'd said touch not my anointed
[22:29] and do my prophets no harm
[22:32] amen god watches over his own
[22:35] and he knows them and he will judge them
[22:39] when they come to the end of the way
[22:43] i repeat
[22:46] this
[22:47] was an unfulfilled age
[22:50] or
[22:52] an age with
[22:55] spiritual deficiencies
[22:58] it was an age
[23:00] of reformation
[23:03] and that is the way god wanted it
[23:06] reformation
[23:08] praise god
[23:10] you remember
[23:12] if you don't remember then we can tell
[23:14] you about it when a corn of wheat is
[23:18] planted
[23:19] the first the the entire plant does not
[23:22] just push up through the ground and come
[23:25] up and and in one night the next day you
[23:28] have ripened fruit
[23:29] no it starts with a reformation
[23:34] from the seed life
[23:37] you see the blade as jesus said
[23:40] and then the air
[23:42] and then later on the full corn
[23:46] surrounded by the shock
[23:49] around that uh original seed
[23:53] that is in there praise god so
[23:57] everything forms
[23:59] beginning from the seed
[24:01] forming itself for another stage
[24:04] forming itself for another stage and
[24:07] forming itself for another stage and
[24:10] that's the way god unfolded his plane
[24:15] and his
[24:16] kingdom amen hallelujah because all my
[24:21] friends
[24:22] there were when we see
[24:24] a 1906 pentecost
[24:28] came
[24:29] during this laodicean age
[24:32] that was only
[24:34] the husk
[24:35] or the chaff
[24:38] to surround and protect the seed
[24:41] until it came to its fullness
[24:44] or maturity of growth
[24:46] its ripeness
[24:48] under the revelation of malachi 4 5
[24:52] the hot shining gospel son of the
[24:55] message of this 20th century
[24:58] praise god hallelujah
[25:00] that a mighty angel
[25:02] came down
[25:04] and used an earthly messenger speaking
[25:08] through him for a period of time
[25:11] that we can
[25:13] get used to the fact that god still
[25:15] speaks through man
[25:17] and then
[25:19] he took the man out of the way and
[25:23] continued to work with his word
[25:26] now through a many membered bride body
[25:31] watching to see
[25:33] whether you will
[25:35] recognize him that he is the same one
[25:40] the son of man now being revealed in a
[25:44] bright form through his people but watch
[25:48] his nature watch his word watch his
[25:51] expressions watch his manifestation
[25:54] watch his works watch his revelation do
[25:58] you recognize him it's just the same
[26:02] when the lord jesus was on the earth the
[26:04] word made flesh or the word logos in
[26:08] flesh
[26:09] then he said must needs that i go away
[26:12] hallelujah so he left the scene visibly
[26:17] and came back down
[26:19] in the form of the holy
[26:22] ghost and now the holy ghost was not
[26:25] acting in one man
[26:28] but now the corn of wheat
[26:30] had come up now a thousand fold
[26:34] and more
[26:35] and now the holy ghost was manifesting
[26:39] through myriads of believers
[26:42] now
[26:43] can you recognize
[26:46] that is the same jesus christ
[26:48] the same yesterday today and forever
[26:52] by his nature
[26:54] by the opening of his word
[26:57] the way he acts
[26:59] that you will recognize
[27:01] that you will see
[27:02] that he is the same one
[27:05] using different veils
[27:07] but he remains the same yesterday today
[27:12] and forever
[27:13] hallelujah
[27:15] the turn of this 20th century
[27:19] we had great talk
[27:22] about how
[27:24] the holy ghost was falling
[27:27] and moving around the people
[27:30] and very soon people were speaking in
[27:33] tongues
[27:34] interpreting
[27:36] and
[27:37] claiming to be baptized with the holy
[27:40] ghost
[27:41] with the evidence
[27:43] of speaking
[27:45] in towns
[27:47] my friends
[27:48] that was
[27:50] really
[27:51] not the fullness of it all
[27:55] for in the restoration of the bride tree
[27:58] justification made way for
[28:00] sanctification sanctification made way
[28:04] for the baptism of the holy spirit
[28:07] but now the baptism of the holy spirit
[28:11] makes way and must make way
[28:14] for the holy ghost himself glory to god
[28:18] the mighty covenant word angel of god
[28:22] himself
[28:23] making himself known in this day and in
[28:27] this hour thanks be to god hallelujah
[28:31] amen
[28:32] and that's where pentecost failed
[28:36] because
[28:38] pentecost 1906's through the street it
[28:41] failed because the organized
[28:45] the moment they organized
[28:48] they went back to their old mother
[28:51] instead of going back to the fullness of
[28:54] the world
[28:55] yes sir
[28:56] they failed
[28:58] and then
[28:59] their god
[29:01] just used them
[29:03] as a cover or as a sha a chaff to
[29:08] surround a shock to surround the genuine
[29:13] seed of god elected of god
[29:16] that was in their myths amen
[29:20] that was a dangerous period of deception
[29:24] because it deceived the people
[29:27] that there were that seed
[29:30] but the devil used
[29:32] remember this was an original
[29:35] manifestation of god
[29:38] but the devil knows how to pervert
[29:41] how to
[29:42] how to use that for his benefit so the
[29:46] genuine work of god he twists it and
[29:50] causes the people to believe that was
[29:52] the original uh seed and shirt bride
[29:56] church of god
[29:58] when it had not come to its fullness but
[30:01] yet was
[30:02] unfulfilled and unfulfilling it is
[30:06] fullness of what god's intents were
[30:10] within his heart so this
[30:13] chaff stage
[30:15] this stage
[30:17] called the the stage
[30:19] of the
[30:20] seed
[30:23] and the shock
[30:25] is a dangerous time
[30:28] it's a deceiving hour
[30:31] the devil uses it but thank god the
[30:36] promise was made in the by the prophet
[30:38] zechariah of the holy spirit
[30:41] at evening time when it begins to get
[30:44] dark and deceiving it shall be light
[30:47] again thank god the light has shone upon
[30:52] us thank god we are people that sat in
[30:56] denominational
[30:57] darkness we have seen a great light and
[31:01] a great light
[31:02] as of revelation has sprung up in the
[31:06] natural world in the form of a prophet
[31:09] and the form of the pillar of fire and
[31:11] in the spirit world in the form of the
[31:15] logos
[31:16] the opening of our hearts eyes that we
[31:20] might see the fullness of the word
[31:24] this
[31:25] pentecostal age
[31:28] some of the worst deceivers
[31:30] and deceptions
[31:32] that the world has ever seen
[31:35] because it's the closest
[31:38] to the genuine article of god
[31:41] and it becomes deceiving in the minds
[31:45] of the people
[31:48] it was just a carrier
[31:50] and a cover
[31:53] to bring that life over
[31:56] into this new
[31:58] precious age
[32:01] in which we are in
[32:03] so that a weak bride
[32:06] could be made manifested
[32:09] by the power of the spoken word glory to
[32:12] god where god speaks of it in ezekiel 47
[32:17] 2-5 how the holy spirit the rivers of
[32:22] waters of the opening of the world will
[32:25] so cover his people
[32:27] and he'll become so deep and so blessed
[32:32] until as the scripture says again he
[32:34] measured a thousand
[32:36] and brought me through the waters that i
[32:39] could not pass over for the waters were
[32:42] risen
[32:43] waters to swim in
[32:47] in a river
[32:48] it was a river that could not be passed
[32:52] over yes my friends we will not
[32:55] understand it all down here even though
[32:59] we are receiving revelation for as paul
[33:04] said while we are in the flesh we see
[33:07] through a glass directly but then when
[33:10] we have cross over at the crossing
[33:13] then shall we know amen we will have the
[33:18] fullness of knowledge
[33:20] by the holy spirit dwelling within us
[33:24] glory be to god amen oh my hallelujah
[33:29] well
[33:30] the lutherans
[33:32] did have the holy ghost
[33:34] potentially
[33:37] amen
[33:38] like the
[33:39] oak tree
[33:41] is within
[33:42] the acorn potentially
[33:46] so the the lutherans had the holy ghost
[33:50] potentially the methodists
[33:54] who followed wesley
[33:56] they had the holy ghost
[33:59] potentially
[34:01] amen
[34:03] and that was under sanctification
[34:06] hallelujah
[34:08] and
[34:10] the pentecostals
[34:13] have the holy ghost also
[34:16] potentially
[34:18] they think they have the fullness
[34:20] but it was not the fullness
[34:24] it brought back the restoration
[34:27] of all things praise god
[34:31] so that god could restore
[34:34] his people and his church
[34:36] back to the original
[34:39] the word
[34:41] of pentecost
[34:43] 2-4
[34:44] and further back right back to the word
[34:49] that was in the mind of god
[34:52] before the foundation of the world
[34:55] hallelujah or we run a journey
[34:59] praise god we're passing through time
[35:03] this world is not our home
[35:05] we're just passing through
[35:08] oh but i want to thank god
[35:11] that we did not come
[35:13] in this world
[35:15] just by chance
[35:17] where we come
[35:19] sealed to the day of our redemption
[35:22] he sealed you by your election
[35:26] knowing that the holy spirit will
[35:29] shepherd you to the day of when you
[35:31] become fully conscious of your
[35:33] redemption by him taking you out of here
[35:37] by his rapture in grace
[35:40] amen
[35:41] listen to the scriptures
[35:43] be
[35:44] watchful
[35:46] and straighten the things which remain
[35:50] that are ready to die
[35:53] hallelujah well you know
[35:56] to be truly watchful
[35:59] you can't be half asleep
[36:01] uh you have got to be awake
[36:04] you have got to be alert
[36:08] you have got to be aware
[36:10] of what is going on
[36:13] around you
[36:14] all the time
[36:16] hallelujah praise god when god says
[36:19] strengthen
[36:20] the things which remain everything
[36:23] around you is so shaky everything around
[36:26] you is so unsure everything around you
[36:29] is uncertain
[36:30] god is saying i want you to straighten
[36:34] your faith
[36:35] straighten all the the things
[36:38] that are in the church the truths the
[36:41] word
[36:42] that you are uncertain of straighten the
[36:45] things that remain i want you to give
[36:47] them a permanency i want you them to
[36:50] become solidified amen within your
[36:54] hearts and within
[36:56] your minds oh praise god hallelujah amen
[37:01] yes sir now listen here's an
[37:04] illustration
[37:07] you know that
[37:09] sardis
[37:10] means the escaped ones
[37:14] that is what sardis means the escaped
[37:17] ones
[37:18] hallelujah
[37:20] that you
[37:21] it's as if you were pursued by pursuers
[37:25] and everything you are gained was lost
[37:28] because the pursuers were so near
[37:30] they're about to catch you and god is
[37:33] saying listen hold on to what you have
[37:36] and run for your life and straighten
[37:39] that which remains
[37:42] now
[37:43] this
[37:45] god is referring to that back in
[37:47] sardis
[37:48] many times bandits would come off of the
[37:52] mountains
[37:53] that was around or near sardis
[37:58] and
[37:59] they were charged down upon the people
[38:02] and
[38:03] rob them
[38:04] of everything that they
[38:07] had
[38:09] and so god is using that
[38:13] thought
[38:15] to remind them
[38:17] what i have given you the riches of
[38:19] grace the riches of mercy the riches of
[38:23] the tresses of christ
[38:25] i want you to run with it
[38:28] so that you are not retaken you're not
[38:30] recaptured you're not spoiled the things
[38:34] that you have are not taken away from
[38:38] you whatsoever but that you could escape
[38:42] clean away and hold on to your freedoms
[38:47] and
[38:48] your liberties hallelujah but god is
[38:51] saying listen you i can see you are
[38:54] almost
[38:55] near back into captivity
[38:59] but see that you don't go back to that
[39:02] old captivity that you are in
[39:05] but keep going on
[39:07] and be alert and be awake and aware and
[39:11] watchful
[39:12] concerning the things
[39:15] uh surrounding
[39:16] your captivity
[39:18] are you going to lose it all
[39:21] and you're going to end up
[39:23] going
[39:24] backwards
[39:26] oh praise god a hallelujah
[39:29] amen but you know the age did not heed
[39:33] the voice of the spirit of god
[39:36] and god literally had to raise up
[39:39] another messenger whom we will touch
[39:42] upon him in the later age
[39:45] god had to raise up
[39:47] martin luther
[39:49] and bypass that
[39:52] lutheran denomination
[39:55] which is nothing but a
[39:57] watered-down delusion of catholicism
[40:00] and
[40:01] now my friends
[40:03] he went on to a new age
[40:06] to bring further truth
[40:08] that he might build towards the day
[40:11] a full
[40:12] restoration
[40:15] revelation 3 3 remember therefore
[40:19] how the west what that was received
[40:22] and heard
[40:23] and hold fast
[40:26] and repent
[40:28] therefore
[40:29] thou shalt not watch
[40:31] i will come unto thee as a thief and
[40:35] thou shalt not know the hour i will come
[40:39] unto thee
[40:41] amen hallelujah how wonderful to know
[40:46] that god had given them already the
[40:48] basic truths
[40:50] of the whole gospel the just shall live
[40:54] by faith
[40:55] and that salvation
[40:57] 100
[41:00] is of the lord amen
[41:03] they had heard the truth
[41:05] of the bible
[41:06] out of the word of god
[41:08] which cast down
[41:11] all the doctrines of rome and proved
[41:14] them false and pagan and contrary to the
[41:19] word of god
[41:20] it set at not
[41:23] all papal authority
[41:26] they knew the truth
[41:28] the church does not save
[41:31] they understood that
[41:33] as it was revealed to them
[41:36] through the holy by the holy spirit
[41:38] through their messenger that the church
[41:42] does not and cannot and will never be
[41:46] able to save any individual or group of
[41:50] people wherever whoever they may be amen
[41:56] they understood also
[41:59] the lord's supper amen
[42:03] they understood that it was not any such
[42:07] a lie
[42:08] as transubstantiation
[42:12] that the bread becomes the literal flesh
[42:15] of jesus
[42:16] and the wine becomes back to the literal
[42:18] blood
[42:19] they knew
[42:21] that was not the truth they had the
[42:24] revelation of the true lord's supper
[42:28] that the bread only represented his body
[42:31] as the bread of life and the wine
[42:34] represented his blood as the quickening
[42:37] power of the holy spirit amen
[42:40] they had the light up given to them and
[42:44] go up by god on water baptism
[42:47] that it was not to be in these titles
[42:51] given there
[42:53] to them by rome
[42:56] of father son and holy ghost
[42:58] and beautiful
[43:00] wonderful
[43:02] motions movements and signs i baptize
[43:06] you in the name of the father son and
[43:09] holy goat and so on that will impress
[43:12] the people
[43:13] one name in the
[43:15] the name
[43:18] of the one who is the father is the son
[43:21] and is the holy ghost and peter said in
[43:24] acts 2 and his name is none other but
[43:28] the lord jesus christ amen they had this
[43:32] light
[43:33] and that's why they put out images
[43:37] out of their churches
[43:39] out of their lives
[43:41] and you will too if you see the fullness
[43:44] of the word
[43:45] you believe the church or you believe
[43:47] the word
[43:48] you believe the pope or you believe the
[43:51] prophet or believe the bible believe the
[43:55] truth of god's word let every man's word
[43:58] be a lie and let's god's word be the
[44:01] truth now and forevermore hallelujah
[44:04] praise god there were many men of that
[44:07] age who had the light of that day of
[44:11] that hour oh praise god they had enough
[44:15] light that they could have overhauled
[44:17] the entire
[44:20] system of that day kind of retrofit the
[44:23] entire whole thing over if they would
[44:25] let god lead them
[44:28] line by line
[44:30] precept upon precept here a little there
[44:33] a little amen they received the truth
[44:37] they wanted the truth that they had
[44:40] heard but how did they hear it amen it's
[44:45] how you hear the truth it's your
[44:47] attitude even now while you're listening
[44:51] to me it is your attitude with which you
[44:54] are using the motive with which were
[44:58] listening you see they were listening
[45:01] with the attitude that they could
[45:04] theorize they could debate they could
[45:08] discuss
[45:11] they could carry on and analyze the word
[45:15] of god amen they approach the word of
[45:18] god
[45:19] in a theological format of
[45:23] academically
[45:25] an academic approach
[45:27] to the word of god
[45:29] my friends hallelujah rather than the
[45:33] practical outworking of the holy spirit
[45:37] making known himself
[45:39] in
[45:40] and through you for his glory and honor
[45:44] now in the old days the guards of the
[45:48] temples
[45:49] if they were found sleeping on the job
[45:52] then
[45:53] they were beaten and their garments
[45:56] burnt and they were thrown out
[45:59] and god is saying you don't you if you
[46:02] don't hold to the word of god for your
[46:05] day and for your hour you'll be beaten
[46:08] with many stripes and cast out into all
[46:11] the darkness they'll be whipping and
[46:14] wailing and gnashing of teeth amen
[46:18] hallelujah
[46:20] and
[46:21] lastly
[46:22] i will come onto thee
[46:26] as a thief
[46:27] remember i told you about these bandits
[46:31] the bandits did not blow a trumpet
[46:33] telling you when they were coming
[46:35] but they just swooped down from the
[46:38] hillsides
[46:39] upon the people
[46:41] amen
[46:42] and they understood full well what the
[46:46] spirit of god was saying
[46:48] that there could be a sudden secret
[46:50] sweep
[46:52] coming of the lord upon the scene at any
[46:56] time
[46:56] oh my
[46:58] what a message for that for the false
[47:00] vine
[47:01] to know they can be caught in the act by
[47:04] the coming of the lord just as it was
[47:08] in the days
[47:09] of
[47:10] noah
[47:11] amen only eight were saved out of that
[47:15] generation my friends jesus himself said
[47:19] oh fear not
[47:21] little flock
[47:23] it is your father's good pleasure to
[47:26] give you the contact to to give you the
[47:28] kingdom amen and the world of the
[47:31] ungodly war swept away
[47:34] and it will be swept away again
[47:38] amen for every day there is daily
[47:41] contact
[47:43] with god's original seed
[47:46] who are constantly speaking the word of
[47:48] god
[47:50] and the people refuse to hear the word
[47:53] of god
[47:54] but you'll be judged
[47:56] by your reaction
[47:58] to the very word
[48:00] that you are hearing
[48:02] god doesn't ask you do you respect the
[48:04] man do you respect that woman that child
[48:07] that person that's speaking what he is
[48:10] looking at do you respect and believe
[48:13] his word that is flowing through his
[48:16] servant amen praise the god turn aside
[48:20] turn around my friends
[48:23] before it is too late
[48:25] turn around and face the truth
[48:29] carnal people
[48:31] selfish people arrogant people of the
[48:34] age turn around amen
[48:38] god is calling you from away from being
[48:40] just a nominal christian
[48:44] to being an active believer
[48:46] that holds firmly to the word of god and
[48:50] to the truth
[48:51] and for those of you who claim you
[48:54] believe
[48:55] the word you have heard
[48:58] from the messenger of this day
[49:00] strengthen the things which remain
[49:03] amen
[49:05] get out of your shaky
[49:07] weak uncertain condition
[49:10] are you in the whale's belly
[49:13] are you in those darkened conditions
[49:15] once again
[49:16] may the great holy spirit
[49:19] shine the light upon you that you will
[49:21] receive light
[49:23] in the evening time
[49:25] and be ready
[49:26] for his glorious and wonderful appearing
[49:31] may the lord jesus bless us all together
[49:34] as we think on these things and meditate
[49:38] on the rest that is to come may god
[49:41] bless us everyone in the name of our
[49:44] lord jesus christ
[49:45] amen
[49:47] [Music]
[50:22] you
