to every need discern every heart every life and pour out in a special use our precious brother Phil Lord we so appreciate all the church father in Jesus Christ name am Father I remember bright him at home with neck pains you touch him and let your perfect will be done in his life in Jesus name amen hallelujah so um today is um Bible study so think I'm going to be reading a lot of scriptures back and forth maybe three or four scriptures so um you get have to get your Bible ready our first scripture will be taken from Mark chapter 10 verse 17 to 30 okay think okay yeah Mark chapter 10 strange okay yeah and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and Jus said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness the fraud not honor thy father father and mother and he answered and said unto him master all these have I observed from my youth in the Matthew said all this have I kept from my youth so I'm going to um my topics everything based on here all this have I kept from my youth so if I'm going to um titled it's going to be um it is more than keeping the law then J says behold him loved him and said unto him one thing thou liketh go thy way sell whatever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shall have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions and Jesus looked around about and said unto his disciples how hardly shall the that have riches enter into the kingdom of God and the disciples were astonished at his words but Jesus answered again and said unto them children how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God and they were astonished out of measure saying among themselves who then can be saved and Jesus looking upon them with men it is impossible but With God all things not some things all things are possible then began Peter to say unto him Lo we have left all and have followed thee that means that if you really become a Christian you have to leave everything and Jesus answered and said ver I say unto you there is no man that had left house or Brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or LS for my sake and the gospels but he shall receive aund foot now in this this time but he shall receive 100 fold now in this time houses and Brethren and sisters and mothers and children and LS with persecution and in the world to come eternal life Heavenly Father may you please bless the reading of your word in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen please be seated um I first got this thought couple of weeks or maybe a month when our pastor Danny was preaching and he talk about some people when you meet them they said that they do not commit they have not killed they not commit any sin I don't know if some of you have met people all the time you talk them oh I'm good Phil me I don't go after anybody's wife um I'm good I'm I I don't I don't go for anybody's wife I don't steal I don't Mur I don't do this I'm good but the scripture was saying here they said there's not good only God is good so that's what the people they think by themselves keeping the law made them good but the Bible said that there is none good only the Lord Jesus Christ is good amen so the problem we have is that the Rich Young Ruler he has obeyed all those laws from his youth but he still realized that he La something so it's not about following the laws but I believe it's all about when the word of God for your day is presented to you at your time of living how you approach it how you regard it because that Rich Young Ruler he obey all the laws but he still knows he lacks something there's not a person in this world that have not met the Lord say chist that in his heart he knew that he lacked something it doesn't matter how rich he has or how religious he is if he hasn't met God for his time there is something missing in that person's life amen they it doesn't matter how they shout how they scream if they don't have the Holy Ghost they have not been fully born again and they don't know which that which they know that they know that they know it is they know there's something lacking and that lacking God put a thirst of him s in every human heart and only him can satisfy that heart so to be at rest you have to meet God for your time of visitation and remember Moses was also a rich young man in his time you know the same God that the Rich Young Ruler met is the same one that Moses met when Moses Moses met him he was in the form of Pillar of Fire and he spoke to Moses yes from that H from that fire from that light but you remember when the Lord Jesus Christ was here he said that before Abraham was I am in other words he was trying to refer to them that that bush that fire that Moses met that has put on flesh and is standing right in their face and when that word became flesh and standing in the face of the wrong ruler despite that he has kept all the laws from his youth he still couldn't accept that word for his day but Moses he killed somebody because he was young man strong and he recognized that he is the one that has to lead the children of Israel because since his youth his mom has been telling him that you were a proper child you were born for this purpose and he knew he was the one has to do it but the problem that Moses had like most of us have is that we try to do things by our own selves he TR that he's strong he's a military man he's intelligent more than all the Pharaohs he can even teach them he has high form of Education he knows all the knowledge and everything the craft military man he can lead the war and do everything so he trust in his own strength so when he trust his own strength his own ability he failed miserably am he tried to do it by himself he end up killing somebody and he has to run for his life but it doesn't matter how he killed somebody when that word of God came in front of him he receed it gladly but this man has let a moral clean life since his youth on but when the word was presented to him he denyed it amen and based on that some people can deny the word of God but they still can go on and prosper this man denied the word of God he rejected it but the Bible said that his b got full he became so rich rich that he got to a place that he said that um I'm going to have what a fan or whatever to rest he was so his f everything went on well for him and in between then God gave him another chance La just passed by him and he just gave L those crumps did not repent for the second time he gave he had a second chance he still Let It Go by but in the end he went to wrong place he was also begging what Lazarus for water but Abraham said that a distance is so far he can't help you so all it doesn't matter all obeying the law without the Holy Ghost without meeting God for yourself without expression without receiving the word for the hour the law that you obeying doesn't mean nothing it's all works it doesn't mean nothing you are not saved by works you are saved by grace and grace alone work comeing in appreciation to what God has done for you so it's not the wor that you have done or I have done it's the grace of God and when the same thing was presented to Moses he accepted it gladly amen let me read a little thing for you over here amen praise God hallelujah I'm excited now and this young fellow proved that he was a fine cultured boy not just some what we call today a hod I think this is from the investment he was a fine type of boy being raised up in a good home he said Master I've done these things since I was a boy all my life he's followed the law man see he showed that his parents was nice parents he went to a church that believe in keeping the Commandments but yet in the church keeping the Commandments still didn't answer what he saw in Jesus he knew with all with our C and with our church and keeping the Commandments still doesn't give us eternal life it did not then neither does it do it today there is something you've got to do now you find that it wasn't because that he wasn't a church member it wasn't because he wasn't morally right he was but you can be a church member and morally right still not obtain eternal life not to know the word some of them are theologians and Scholars and Sunday school teachers Bible Expos test but that doesn't mean anything Satan knows that Bible better than any of us the Bible said to know him is life not know the word know him is life Satan also believe and trembles but we've got to have an experience of a death burial and Resurrection from our old life to the new life which comes in Christ it comes only by what the Holy Spirit of the new life I know this is a very simple topic that I'm saying but I believe that God is also in Simplicity amen so with all that he has he couldn't what make it so it's good to come to church I'm not saying don't come to church but don't come to don't bring the people Church bring the people to Christ you must come into Christ he's the Fountain of Life and The Giver of all good things coming to church obeying all the regions is all good you can even preach the gospel you still going to missx it it comes back back to said somewh said that if you have ch you have all give all your poor your all everything to the people have faith to move mountains do all this without charity which is Grace it means nothing and that charity is the Holy Ghost amen so you are blessed tonight that you have the Holy Ghost you have recognized what God is doing in your day and you believe it and you have believe in it so you have received the Holy Ghost but if you know that you don't know what you know and you're lacking something then I encourage you online wherever you are you got to seek God you have to be desperate for the best right because that's the only thing that when he SE I will pass over you we that angel that angel will go and seal only those who cry and sigh for the abomination of the sins of the world only those who have the blood tag when I see the blood I will pass over you so it's having the Holy Ghost the birth right that is more important than anything else this Young Ruler he was young and Rich but I believe that Moses was more famous and richer than him in his time because Moses was to be the next Pharaoh just like American president but in the Bible here in um in Hebrews he said by faith Hebrew 11:24 by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect on the recompense of the what by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible in other words in other words Moses was like more richer more f everything than that Rich Young Ruler but he forsook everything and followed Christ so is everyone of us tonight some of us maybe on the high r with the rich and everything they left everything and follow Christ that's what um Peter said Lord we are forsaken everything what are we going to get in return He said that there's none that has left all this things that will not be blessed in this world and what the world to come so I encourage you doesn't matter what you have left have confidence that God is going to bless you in the present tense and the world to come somewhere David said that in Psalms he said that no good thing will he uphold from those that walk uprightly before him he said that the long lion like it but the um they that obey God they that love God there's nothing that I will what take away from that think 34:4 so if you with all your heart follow the lord Jesus Christ I believe that there's nothing that he going to you going to take it any no good thing will God take it away from you if you do not get something it means that maybe it might not be good for you at the right time if you need is good for you he going to give it to you and he's a good God so it's not not about the law it's about you recognizing what God is doing for your day and what leaving it we have so many examples when he preached I was working I hope I can recollect everything something came on me and it opened to me so much everywhere in the scriptures I I hope I can bring it the way that it became so clear to me hallelujah amen amen we have examples with Esau and Jacob the Bible saidah said that Esau was more gentleman than Jacob and he was so gentleman and so good that he always go and kill H and give to his that he almost received his Prophet Daddy but Jacob was a supplanter he was a deceiver he deceived this he did this he did that he did that so all that Christian is about it's not about good work brother or sister then if it's about good work then the Muslims are far because they pray like seven times a day some people they don't like their their um they they are loyal to their wives they are loyal to their husband they don't steal morally they live clean life but that doesn't mean nothing amen that the difference is when that person life is messed up and Christ comes into his life and it changes that person from the inside out that makes a difference it's not what is on the outside that is most important is the inside thing when the people met Christ nobody will tell them don't do this don't do that don't do that don't do that because they have met Christ the word of God hallelujah they become rest amen they don't do it by their own works or their own efforts anymore that's why he that is of heavy laden come unto me and I will give rest unto your soul God wants us to rest on him so that he can take us through he going to ride the trail through you and me he doesn't need your effort we live in a time of day that all the demons from the time of nimrod and all those things are here but all those Spirit of Christ from Noah Abraham they also here so greater is he that is in you than me he that the world so God recognized that no man he can't trust this with anybody now he has to come himself to be his own interpreter to live in our heart and live his life through us so that we can overcome the enemy we can overcome the Temptation because without God himself in you leading this life you're going to be mess up you crumble your marriage whatever it is all going to be cramped if you have a proper marriage you live with your wife for day is the grace of God it's God that is keeping that marriage because in the time that you are living it takes the grace of God the devil attacked the homes he knows the homes the foundation so he attack the homes he messed up the people's life and the only way that you survive I survive is the grace of God because God who created heaven El has come inside you he lives inside of you inside of me so he take control of your house he take control of your temple you become the temple of God Amen the Bible said that you have become the Temple of the Living God and He Who that defiles that Temple God will destroy him destroy him so you that God live inside of you is his grace you didn't choose it's a s Grace that came into your life amen that he has lived his life through you amen just like John Wesley said when he saw that bomb the drunen said there I am by the grace of God so is a Grace that is keeping you that is keeping me so let's thank god let's appreciate him let's give him all when you look at what he has done for us it encourag us to thank him more to praise him to glorify his name out of billions he came to you he came to me he save you the question of when he came to you he save you and he seal you listen the enemy means knows that is getting to end time Israel is at War and the Bride is a spiritual Israel they hav attack all FR firing they fighting on you can't stay uh like that you got to go on your and pray you got to do the part that you have to do because the battle going on the greatest battle ever fought is going on now so what the enemy does he can come and attack oh you are not saved oh you are not a good Christian oh you have done this oh you have done that oh you look at what you did he's going to bring all kind of mistakes to you but what I encourage you to remember that you are saved when God save you save once and for all you are a son or a daughter of God your condition doesn't change your position when it comes to letting know that you are a son of God I am a daughter of God I saved God has confirmed me being saving going to heaven salvation that thing is it shouldn't even bother a true Christian on this time of the age because that one is done done deal so don't let the devil come and play with your mind that oh this that that is all lies from him you have to be confident at this time that you are a son or a daughter of God because remember it's not your position it's your condition as a Son of God that is more important than anything else no wonder David said I would rather be a dmat In The House of the god of the Living God but to be in the congregation of the wicked so being a Son of God is the most vital thing here your position as a son or da daughter of God is very important that's why Pastor was telling last to your identity you have to identify yourself and know that I am what the word of God said I am and word god Hest his word more than his name he said let every man's word be a li but mine be the truth amen so if God's word is the truth then have to rest on his word he said that by his stripes I am healed amen what I said that you have to accept it you might be sick for Thousand Years whatever years but the word of God said by Stripes i healed I don't care how much I have pains in my back I don't care how much I have a headache how much I'm going through I'll still confess because Jesus Christ the high priest of our confession based on what you confess you get it he said on the right hand of God interceding for US based on our confession and I confess our whole from the top of my head to the to to the to my knee I'm whole every part of me I'm whole I'm Healed I'm blessed I'm a son of the Living God he lives in me your confession is more than important so once you confess the truth and you believe and you accept it it will come to pass because our God is an awesome God he keeps all his where he said where two or three are gathered in my name I'll be in your midst when two or three agreed concerning anything I will honor it so tonight we are more than two or three here if all of us come in agreement with one Accord whatever you need tonight you believe it in your heart you're going to receive it tonight before you leave here because our God our Serv is a living God he honors his word more than his name you have to accept it you have to accept your healing you have to accept your salvation you have to accept whatever you have and we all agreed in one nothing in the time of nimrod they made one agreement and they were going to go up to heaven and build that Tower and God confounded them but on day of Pentecost they were all in one Accord and the spirit of God came and what they did was God himself he divided himself into all of them because why they all were in one Accord so when you agreed on one thing and believe it it will come to pass the only thing that will hinder our prayer that will hinder things happen to us is fears that's why in Psalm 34 verse4 David said I saw the Lord to deliver me from all my fears so if there is anything that you think you fear you have to S God for deliverance because David S God for deliverance amen so that those fears will not have effect in his life anything remember that job feared it came on him but the Bible said if thou can believe all things are possible to them that believe faith is a key to unlock God's blessing amen faith is a key to everything that you have need of am and faith is a revelation amen and God has given you the key to unlock your blessings so all I have to open that key to whatever you need and God will want give it to you just turn it like that by faith stand on the word of God revelation of the word of God it will bring every Divine promise to pass because he's the same yesterday today and forever our God is aome God hallelujah what am I trying to say Esau was small gentleman but just like so many people he despised the birth right he being the Elder son supposed to receive the blessing but he sold it for just what a partt of belly how many people in our time are selling their birth right just like Esau because of small amount of money that some people get to buy food and on the table they reject coming the house of God I'm not saying that I don't have to work the Bible said the hands that has no work should not eat but don't let your work become your God Amen there have to be a balance in everything that you are doing put God first and his kingdom first and all other things will be added onto it amen so many people they even don't trust God enough to pay their ties because they scared they don't have money to pay this bill to pay that bill to pay that bill but trust in God he said bring all SI and offering in my house and test me with if I will not open Windows of Heaven that blessing might not be necessary money sometimes you protect you on the road he give you a health he give you so many things that your eyes cannot even see Glory so let's trust God don't put your trust in your chos or your money or your Equity or it's all going to G away let's put it in Christ the Rich Young Ruler had an opportunity to sell everything and receive eternal life and more plus but he his eyes was just seeing his surroundings he didn't see far just like hazy he said oh Our Father father the serious Army are all camper arounders Elijah said oh God open the young my's eye to see Hallelujah because his eyes was just seeing only thing but Faith looks beyond what your eye can see amen it goes the six the six St it defies all the O of what your natural eyes can see when his eyes was open then he know that they that were with them is greater than they that was against them so if your eyes could open you will know that God he he controls everything Silver and Gold Everything is his Just Surrender yourself to himen and he will give you the desires of your heart he's a wonderful God Amen we love him with all our heart hallelujah our god is good he's the same yesterday today and forever amen and he keeps all his appointment he keeps all his word hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus another person I'm going to talk about is Judas and the and the thief on the cross you can see it all over in the scriptures Judas walked with the Lord he listened to every preaching that the Lord Jesus Christ preached within that 3 and a half years but it didn't do him no good the teeth on the cross was a thief stealing people their casts in modern times stealing their shoes their money doing all kind of wicked things but you see Judas rejected despised the word of God for his day MH he denied that he so that birth right and he repented but it was too late the same that Esau sought repentance with fears he didn't do him nothing so was Judas but that teeth on the cross when that word of God come on came to him M at the point of death he said Lord remember me and he said tonight you'll be with me Hallelujah in in what in Paradise that thief on the cross outside was M he looked so wicked outside that's what the devil covered him that night but he was a Son of God and Judas was a son of pedition and covered himself with religious spirit and look so great and Pious outside but when the time came they all went to their POS their what where they came from amen so it's not the outside work it's the seed of God inside you or inside you that makes the difference thank you that seed when he hear the word of God it will accept it no matter what that seed has done back to Jacob again he was a r i don't talk about this I talk much about Jacob he deceived this father-in-law he deceived he did all those things but when he met that angel of God he wrestled that angel and said unless you bless me I'm not going to let you go he restle with him until that angel blesses him so if you are backslider whoever you are if you know that you don't know that you not 100% sure that you have met God for yourself you don't have the Holy Ghost you got to cry and seek God until you are satisfied until you know God has come to you until you know something has happened oh man when met that woman who was so beautiful and that woman was insan institution she went she prayed a little bit she prayed she said a said you haven't done nothing when the woman prayed prayed it get to a place said now you saying something she became desperate and Sheed deliverance from that insane institution so without desperation sometime you cannot please God you got to be desperate like David said as the there thirsted for the water Brook so my soul thirst after thee for the Living God Amen you have be desperate and thir for God am and see because listen the only thing in this life that when you received you always want more and more and more is the Holy Ghost replenishing and replenishing you get one time the rest you replenish it you replenish it like that like that because listen everything in this life it doesn't satisfy to the fullest that's why the people they took the drugs they keep on taking High drugs this that that because they time from come from cigarette you go to COC you go to you take B it doesn't satisfy you want more you see what I mean you have to go to this that that women they can go but they change so many men doesn't satisfy them they get all the cars they get this they get everything but they know something is lacking but this Holy Ghost it satisfies you and that satisfaction doesn't become boring it doesn't become what do I see like I always give example if I don't have a watch and I get a nice um Swiss watch that is like maybe 10 15 whatever it is the first couple of months you cherish it so much you put this watch clean it like a new car all those new houses you clean everything now you so cherishing but after a while that Satisfaction Just erods but the word of God never erose every time you pick up this gospel this Bible something more revealed to you it becomes a new Bible we pick this you get this inspiration you get inspiration it goes on oh my I don't know how to express it but God is good brother D he has been so good to us oh man that you are son or daughter of God and he can come and whisper in your ears the things that you have need of and sometimes speak to you tells you do this do that do that don't underestimate your thought son or daughter of God is God thought that he pass it through you so when he tells you to do something anytime those little voices you miss it you become you realize that you didn't follow that voice you know you done some something oh if I had only followed my thought if I only follow my thought so don't let that thought pass by you Jesus Christ is passing by this day he he's passing this evening he's passing everywhere so don't let that thought don't miss that thought act on it so many of us like procrastination do today's work today don't put it tomorrow Tomorrow Will Never Come amen there's no satisfaction or there's no when you a dead person cannot praise God now that you are living this is the time you have to praise God this is the time we have to worship God this is the time we have to give him praise this is the time that we can wake up in the morning and see the sun shine you got to praise him you got to glorify him we have to exalt him some people cannot even open their mouth but once you have your health once you have everything Praise Him worship the Lord you don't Know What's happen tomorrow people in Ukraine on all those areas now the can't is passed there will be a time your book is closed but now that your book is open give praise to God give him the glory because we are wired to worship God that's why God created us for his glory and pleasure so that you were created to worship him what does the angels do they worship Him 24 hours you got to worship God let nothing come between you and this Mighty God Search Your Heart search your mind search your soul if there's anything that is trying to come between you and God cut it off no wonder the scripture said that I rather go to heaven with blind one Blind Eye than to have my full eye and lose my eternal life I rather go there with one arm shop than to go there with all my full arms and and lose it so it's very vital that we give all our soul our mind everything to God because he created us amen you are created to worship Him hallelujah amen praise God so I'm going to read just one scripture to back that Judas and the thief on the cross in Ezekiel 18: 20- 24 he said that the soul that sinth it it shall die the sign shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wickedness shall be upon him but if the wicked will turn from all his sins so it doesn't matter how that person had Liv in sins if he can tell from all his sins that he has committed and keep all my stles and do that which is lawful and right he shall surely what live he shall not what die all his transgression that he had committed they shall not be Mery unto him like you and me God forgive us and also you are Justified as if we not even do it in the first place all his transgress that he had committed they shall not be mentioned unto him in his righteous that he had done he shall live have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die said the Lord God and not that he should return from his ways and leave but when the right turn away from his righteousness and commit iniquity and do it according to all the Abominations that his Wicked Man doe it shall he leave all his righteous that he had done shall not be mentioned in his trespass that he had trespassed in his sin that he had Sinn in them shall he die in other words if like example of that is Judas he had all that but he went and lost but you're not talking to a a situation where a brother or a sister has done something wrong or done mistakes because because we are in this flesh always going to make mistakes so God is start talking about that he's talking about those like judas's name was brought out from the land's book of life but because we are in this place you're going to make mistakes but as soon as a righteous falls seven times and what he rises up seven times amen you going to make mistake but God doesn't want you to stay in that in that your M rise up and try again amen don't stay in that M amen praise God God is good all the time this is not about your righteousness or my righte it's his righteousness is he living his life through you and me amen he's a wonderful God he's the same yesterday today and for forever I'll talk about David and Uzziah both of them were Kings King Uzziah was brought up righteous he was taught by his parents to live good at the age of 14 or 16 became a king he did everything that was right in the eyes of God but he went out of way out of order he being a king has no right to what turn on the incense in the office or to take the duties of the priest despite all that he done in his all these years when the priest confronted him and told him that King this is not your office instead of him um accepting that that even though he's a king when it comes to God's house the priest is higher than him the problem we have in this message some people because God has blessed them outside with financial blessing when they come to the house of God they want to be bosses in there with education um pH and everything they want to bring that in but when you are true son or daughter of God when you come come to the house of God the office of God you going to put all your education everything aside and come here as a humble man because it's the natural and spiritual thing so God bless Uzziah in the natural thing he wasn't supposed to take the position of the priest but when the priest told him you can't do that instead of repenting and accepting that correction that he refused the corruption the Bible said they were so angry and God WRA until God turn him into a leprosy but David was also a king a man after God's Own Heart David send his Soldier to go to war because he has so many wives he only saw The Soldier's wife instead of going for his wife he took the Soldier's wife slept with him send him to war bring him back to do something with the woman the soldier said no I have to go and what do my my my my master thing he didn't slpt the wife went back to war then he told them to put him the war front where he can die and yes he got killed so David could take that woman as his wife but you know the difference between David and Uzziah when David the king the the prophet Nathan went to him he said King somebody in your kingdom he has um 100 sheep or whatever it is and then he got a visitor instead of killing one of his sheep to serve the visitor he decided to go and take his neighbor's sheep and kill for that visitor David said my kingdom here he was Qui to judge he's going to die but the grace of God took over and the na said David you shall not die but sword will never live in your house but the difference is that when David recognized that he repented Psalm 5 1 he said Lord you only have I done this great sin against you only the have I done this and he cried and that s has become the greatest Psalm create in me a clean heart and renew the right Spirit Within Me restore unto me the joy of my salvation he cried onto God and repented so God want a repented heart no matter what far you have gone he looking to you and me to repent don't be arrogant like Uzziah who just what he was so WRA to take that correction that's why David was man God man after God's Own Heart he repented of his mistakes so if you happen to be the CEO or the big man whoever you are or you are the one with the pH the highest the society you've been accepted when you come the word of God you come to House of God be humble enough to accept correction don't let your position become a hindrance to your eternal life the Rich Young Ruler he was so Pious about the things that he wants he didn't want and lose that friendship but he lost eternally so what I'm encouraging you let's love God let's have repented heart don't just be arrogant when even a situation happens and the deacons has to deal with you or the pastor has to talk to you just accept Corrections don't try to be holy outou don't try to be I know everything as accept Corrections because sometime you might not even know that you are wrong but when that's pointed to you accept it in good faith don't try to be arrogant like what Uzziah did by David with all his mistakes with everything that he did if it was to B to be today I don't think any preacher will go to his his um his his puppet if was supposed to be nobody will go and preach for him again he will been done done done his name would have been black out but God looks into their heart and said David you are man after my own heart so God is looking to us to have that repented heart amen it's very very important no wonder braam said that he repent like thousand times a day because of thoughts that pass through his mind every let's make things right all that God is asking for is make things right don't hold things in your heart forgive and forget because the hard thing for people is to forgive human being is hard some people they forgive they say they forgive but they haven't forget and they don't want to even see the people's face no if you really forgive you forgive and make it right just forgive love the people you see the Bible said love those if it's easy for me to love Cofe love people are very close to you but the true love of God project love to those who hate you you know they really despise you you know they they don't like you but in your heart you have to pray for them because they don't know what they are doing said sometimes God is even trying your faith trying to look at your reaction because the god that we serve he let his rain fall on the just on the unjust he doesn't discriminate the only thing is going to judge them for not obeying his word but you being obedient to his word he going to bless you because you have recognized that the rain that is falling on you you re you accept it you know it's him doing it and you give him the glory back but they receive God re they receive God blessing they still go and Cur his name and every little thing they blame the they blaming God instead of blaming the devil who is causing all that they are blaming god so let's have a repented heart and let's forgive because the Bible said that even if you not forgive do not go and even pray hallelujah amen our God is good all the all the time God is good Hallelujah praise God and one one more thing I think I'm going to try to wrap up very soon one more thing was Abraham God did not chose Abraham based on what Abraham has done the Covenant between Abraham was God done it Abraham not you do this I do that not you do this I do that but said that I chose you I have done this I have done that unconditional love that's what a Seed of Abraham we have received but when Abraham went to Egypt because remember any time the children of Israel they left Palestine they got in trouble Naomi and the husband they left Israel they got in trouble Abraham left there for food so many people do do that all the time when the economy gets so hard a little bit they want to move here left right everywhere to just find food Abraham went to find food and he got in trouble he realized that King is the wicked King he's going to take his wife so he lied to the king that it's my sister and braam said that he repented and because he repented God heard his voice and he's and God will also not permit that King to do that because he going to mess up that race that Isaac was supposed to come through Sarah so even though he lied he did that God also stood by said that let him go and pray for you if he does not pray for you all you and your I'm going to destroy you he he did that thing he said oh Lord didn't he told me that he was is his is his sister didn't he say that he was my he was my brother he said I know that I know the Integrity of your heart that's why I told you to restore that man's wife to him he Resto him and give him more money that's the grace of God Sam said said that his Prophet need some money so he had permit all those things to happen he got all those money from the from the King it was so much that when later he went the wall he told them I don't need nothing from you I'm rich enough I don't need nothing from you so he a grace of God a repented heart Abraham repented that's what God is looking at it's not your works of righteousness amen hallelujah I think I'm going to I read one more thing here and then I'm going to try to close Okay so it was a repent Abraham repented and goded that Hallelujah that's fine and all that I'm trying to say is that God is looking to us for a repented heart there are so many scriptures the prodigal son he went he recognized that where he was what he has done was strong he repented and came back and his father red accepted him the prodal and whil he was even out there he was still a son MH it doesn't change the sunship so it's you and me it doesn't matter how much you make make mistake or things will fall you are still a son amen recognize and accept you are still a son or daughter of God God is not looking at your condition he's looking at your position yes sir the position is the most important thing recognize who you are that you are son or daughter of the Living God hallelujah that's the most important the woman at the world she had lived and messed up her life with five different men it doesn't matter how her life was rotten when that word of God came in front of him and her heart was revealed and all that she has there in the secret was revealed to him to her sorry she said oh thou the Mah she went back and witnessed so is you and me God has been so good to us so what God has done to us let's tell people about it the Bible said that because of a testimony people came and hear about the Lord Jesus Christ even though her life was mess as mess could be but when she met the word of the hour for her day she receive it the one who was caught in the very act she was caught merly in the very act those people by law supposed to Stone her those who are going to Stone her they have kept the LA from their youth but they didn't qualify to Stone ha that's why he began to write on the floor and then they recognized that they do not qualify to Stone her he as he asked her where are your accusers by law they have obeyed the law but that doesn't give them the right to Stone that woman outside they look clean but that woman look Mery on the outside being a daughter of God her life was messed up caught up in the very act but all that God was requiring when the word for her day was presented to her and she was forgiven she never went back to live that life again she gave her all to the Lord Jesus Christ so is you and me amen I'm going to read this um scripture to cap it off First Corinthians chapter 6 verse 4-1 1 Corinthians 6: 4-1 okay if then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life set them to judge you to judge who are least esteem in the church I speak to your shame is it so that oh oh okay grace that's fine give me okay verse four that's fine I speak to your shame is it so that there is not a wise man among you no not one that shall be able to judge between his Brethren but brother go to love with his brother that's why okay um from verse 9 give me verse 9 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor adol nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor cous nor drunkers nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are San ified that you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of what our God Amen that was some of us I used to drink like a fish and when I stopped drinking I had the stomach problem I used to go there my friends with the girls and they are drinking I
