[Music] oh [Music] pressing on [Music] let's sing that first again shall we as we stand to our feet everyone satan tries to stop you [Music] oh [Music] oh today with all of you saints and trusting as the days go by that god will bless us and we'll be able to have a full house we give god the glory honor and praise welcome back into the house of the lord and the presence of the living god may the lord richly bless you in every possible way now last week some believers have had operations and prayer was made for them they came through safely and we thank the lord and give him praise for that [Applause] this week i am aware of other believers that also have to go for operations and so i ask you to pray for them that god will bring them through safely also by his marvelous grace brother coffee's mother has passed away and we want to remember him with god's spirit of love and comfort that the holy spirit will comfort him in this hour and in this time we thank the lord that god has made him a believer and a saint of god and trusting that he will be a blessing to the others uh when he does go over to his own place to take care of the burial that may not be this week or next week it may be in another month or something like that but we're trusting the lord but these are some of the things that have occurred and we give god grace that he has brought us through praise the lord may the lord richly bless you now you know sons of god children of god are led by the spirit of god in john chapter 3 jesus said but the spirit blew it where the wind blew it where it lifts wherever it wants right and no man knows where it goes amen what i'm saying is you know with the blowing of the wind or breeze it doesn't blow at full force all the time you don't have hurricane winds all the time and so it's the same with the preaching you you don't have the eagles flying up five ten miles in the upper atmosphere all the time but then god sometimes lifts you up praise the lord so we want to thank god for his marvelous and wonderful grace that we can uh give god the glory that there's a prophet as as a brother was giving god thanks for and that prophet was led by god to leave a store house and the storehouse is not a place it's not a country it's not any individual the storehouse is the message that he left behind everything is stored in there we just got to find it in the storehouse and the holy spirit will lead us and guide us and bring us to that place praise the lord god bless you sisters thank you very much praise the lord god bless every one of you for your contributions amen now um here we find we are going to turn in our bibles and we are going to read from genesis chapter one and we are going to read from verse one to four i may not be able to complete this here today but we will follow the holy spirit and where he leads us we will follow and may he have the glory honor and praise genesis chapter 1 reading from verse 1 to 4 praise the lord and all our friends out there in the cyber space and the internet wherever they are because last week we got us we got uh texas people in germany also from in france so the word of god is the shining out and little by little the holy spirit is taking a grip amen so we give him all the praise the honor and the glory that while we are gathered here together there are other people in other lands that are watching to watching this and it's going out what was just a blessing maybe to you in a little corner is now spreading out to others who are starting to see the message this way and receiving a blessing from it praise god amen genesis 1 1 to 4. in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness amen you can read verse 5 and god called the light day and the dark darkness he called night and the evening and the morning worthy first day amen god bless us together father we thank you for the reading of the word we ask the great holy spirit will come and quickness to the word that you may receive all praise and glory in jesus name amen praise the lord god bless you please be seated the holy spirit i believe god is trying to help us in every possible way to open our hearts and open our minds and our lives praise god amen now if you look you know genesis of course is the seed chapter of the bible genesis is the beginning it's the very first part of the word of god and here we see in this scripture god spirit moved on the face of the waters now at that time the earth was without form and void we use the term uh the chaotic earth because as brother branham mentioned dr pember others have mentioned before this time something chaotic took place on the face of the earth to make it without form and void and so god here now as we enter the story we are seeing uh are visualizing the holy spirit moving over the great voids and uh darkness that clothed the entire earth at that time now there was no light as yet there was no such a thing as light as yet it was just void and it was just darkness and nothing could be seen at that particular time except that we read in the word of god and god's spirit moved over the face of the waters now i want you to notice that the moving of the holy spirit like he would move in any meeting that didn't give light even though he moved the spirit was moving over the face of those of the darkness and the chaos that was there his moving over that did not bring light so you can have great conventions great meetings great movings of the holy spirit on the people and everything else that doesn't bring light that is just the moving of the holy spirit moving there amen you see because god had not begun his creation yet hey man first pull second pull third pull amen see god had not begun his creation yet even things were there there were things there there were supernatural things there there were the spirit was moving supernatural happenings were taking place but god's or creation had not yet begun and so here we are when we look at the bible what we can see clearly is the first thing that god created was light and god said let there be light amen and he said that light was good light is always good the devil doesn't like light but we love light because we are children of the light amen now if we will read further down in the word of god genesis chapter 14 acme chapter 1 verse 14 and god said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years and let them be for lights in the formament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so and god made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night and he made the stars also and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that it was good and the evening and the morning were the fourth day number of the bride first day light uh one and uh you know fourth day number of the brain so what we're looking at here chapter 1 verses 1 to 4 we're reading that god created light but now when we come to verses 14 he's created light again so what is it there's two lights here created uh one is to shine on the earth he repeats it over and over these lights are to be in the firmament of the heavens he's not talking about supernatural heaven above he's talking about these former men these ones are to be here and to shine down upon the earth but there was another light that was first created that came from the word of god at that particular time hallelujah of course we know that lesser light was the sun and the moon that we still now enjoy that is why brother branham said you're not looking at a different moon or a different uh sun even though millennia has passed it's the same sun and the same wound that you're looking at amen the same stars you see the word of god doesn't change either it doesn't change doesn't matter how many people or many generations pass the word remains the same it does not change hallelujah amen so these lights are to shine on the earth but this other light the first one that god created that is the one that we are talking about here today and i'm saying to you that that first light was god creating s-o-n light you see god set forth his only begotten son amen and he was the very first light that came out from the very bosom of god at that particular time hallelujah now you know brother branham said listen the the son israeli the holy spirit that came out from the father it's just the form that he's going to be in either in flesh or he's going to be in spirit form but it's the son that came out from the father amen and jesus never called himself son of god he always referred to himself as son of man son of man so that's the way he is because we know that the uh the son of god or the holy spirit is really the spirit form of jesus christ the holy spirit is really the spirit form of jesus christ he was there physically he went back amen wherever he says he lay that body on the altar there in the presence of the throne and come back down in the form of the holy spirit so it's the same jesus christ in the spirit form as the holy spirit amen praise god and the holy spirit is the same pillar of fire that was back there in the old testament over the children of israel it's all jesus christ whether he was in pillar of fire whether he comes as the holy spirit whether he stands there in the form of a man it's the same jesus christ amen i'm speaking on the subject of god's great shining light amen hallelujah what did god force create them the pillar of fire amen god first creation created the pillar of fire hallelujah in other words if you want to put it this way god creating god god written a part of himself to represent him on the face of the earth the pair of fire being himself and when he spoke and he said let there be light a form of himself began to take place amen and that form of himself that began to take place we call the pillar of fire something we can see something our senses can contact or uh visualize and recognized well it's here because remember god is a spirit and you couldn't see him he inhabited all eternities amen he was everywhere and there's no one place you're going to look and search to find god because god inhabits all the realms all the dimensions all the universes all time all space everything it's it was all god making himself that way and so that word come from god and it started out praise god you you let go back read brother branham i don't have to go back to allah but he says one little light began to move around like that and before you know it the pure of fire began to take shape hallelujah amen and out of that pillar of fire comes the logos amen the logos amen that came out of there which was a great light amen that great light of god but not just a natural light to shine on the earth down here it was a spirit light or spiritual light amen praise the name of the living god hallelujah god spoke the word and said let there be hallelujah then what happened all the attributes of the word begin to take a form hallelujah it was all the attributes taking a form together to make up that purifier that logos later melchizedek later jesus christ but it was all the attributes for in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily oh that was god what went into christ hallelujah and all that is in christ what became the church lord of god that's why she is him revealed in this hour christ is the mystery of god himself being revealed amen praise the lord we realize that of course became melchizedek and you know the preaching on that how that melchizedek the word form of god began to end morphe and it in morphe or chains transformed it began to transform itself god coming down from his glory of a living story making a step down until melchizedek became jesus christ god stepping into a human form amen but that formation started from way back in the eternities and that formation came down through thousands of years until the present time that we are in so we give god the glory the honor and the praise hallelujah amen we thank god for the pillar of fire how many of you thank god for the pillar of fire how many of you thank god for the sunlight amen i thank god for the sunlight amen praise god verse 26 if you've got your bible and god said let us make man in our own image and after our likeness you see man was made in god's image man was made in god's lightness or he was made like god amen he was made like god and in the same image well how could that be in the human sense because god had no form yet god had no likeness we can look at us yet so what the scripture is telling you that because he was or is the eternal spirit and man was led in his image when he created man he force created a spirit man if he first created a spirit man that you could not see with your eyes but even though he was a spirit he was a man even though he was a spirit he was a person just like let's let's turn a minute here the devil you can't see him but yet he is a person amen only that he has no form he needs a body or something to get into before he can take a form other than that he's still in his spirit form praise god so god then created adam amen as a spirit man in his image and in his lateness and he gave him authority and dominion over all the cattle over all the animals the entire creation was under that man praise the lord and so we are taking god that god created adam who came in the image like any son would of his father praise god he came in the likeness and the image of his father praise god and what the bible is talking about here this was way before adam came into flesh that god had created him and that he was in that spirit form hallelujah amen uh amen genesis 2 uh i believe seven and the lord formed man amen sorry not two sevens yes praise the lord hallelujah and the lord formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul now i want you to see here first the bible tells us god created man in his own image but now it's telling us now is forming man from the dust of the earth you see he's now got to give that spirit man just like he gave the word he had to start working to make the world start to take a form that it can be seen amen even so god start to form a man hallelujah from the dust of the earth praise god something he already made because the man was already created but this here was something that he took from the ark that he already created and begin to form amen a body for that man to step into hallelujah and to be able to be seen and known and recognized hallelujah i think it's conduct order and doctrine um volume one you can find this in there brother branham's saying god created man male and female created them but in you see genesis 2. i'm i'm quoting brother branham it's kind of you know how we talk sometimes broken up it says he formed but before he formed remember he first created hallelujah so this thought is not my thoughts it's just now the thoughts that were already in the storehouse are coming right praise the lord amen but here god force created and then he formed adam i repeat was first created and then he formed man from the dusted earth you see a lot of people because they don't know this they think man was created just when god was taking up the dust that's when he created adam but no adam was already created and he was in spirit form he was a spirit man amen but being in this as a spirit man i i don't have time for that but um while he was in that spirit form he was already ruling over the animals over all the trees of everything you tell him where to move what to do and everything else but he didn't have a body so he could not till the soil he could not do anything right because he was still as a spirit man praise god hallelujah amen praise god hallelujah so then god of course formed him into a flesh man using the dust of the earth and the spirit man went into the flesh man am i making sense the spirit man went into the flesh man that was formed by god from the dust of the earth amen go back to the quote of brother branham so god created man in his own image the first time and then that's the second time now quoting brother branham then he formed man of the dust of the earth out of the dust and breathed in his nostrils amen what is the difference what is the connection there brother branham asking that amen praise the lord now you'll notice in genesis 1 26 god said let us make man in our own image amen and if you'll notice in the creation the first thing that was created of course was light amen the first thing god created was light amen and what was the last thing god created man and jesus says what i am the first i am the last i am the alpha i am the omega i'm the beginning of creation and i'm the ending of all of it i i'm the one i'm all of it amen hallelujah first and the last amen alpha and omega same yesterday today and forever thanks be on a god hallelujah amen praise god say created man in his own likeness praise god hallelujah amen so thank god for that aren't you glad for that brother sister you you you see all this ties into your election because like i said before when that pillar of fire and the holy spirit logos came out you were part of the fullness of all them attributes together that was in god only that he gave its shape in the form of one man amen and in him was the fullness of the attributes the fullness of the godhead bodily now in a body on the face of the earth hallelujah amen and you were a part of him it's you're only now being made manifest you're now being made recognized for who you are you're recognizing yourself in the word of god hallelujah i mean we use the term lightly you are not brother branham said future home you are not creatures of time you come from eternity and you are going back to eternity you are he says you are only now living in a body called time this body this has the time body it's gonna age because the minute you get your break into time you have to start counting time and once you start counting time you're going to end up with age and then the body has to pass away but the spirit man inside is not going to die he's not going anywhere he lives for eternity he lives because he's a part of god he says you can't die no more than god can die oh my how can you do it amen because you are a part of him lord of god a natural manga what kind of cells in his body god got all kind of attributes in his amen god's attributes are now being made manifested amen in this last day praise god hallelujah so god made this man in his own image to lead all the animals all the cattle all the beasts of the field command over all the trees amen just i'm quoting brother branham when you hear me say that that wasn't me saying that i'm really quoting him here from the very coat i started he says here he he he made him in his own image to lead the cattle lead the beasts of the field just like the holy spirit is here to lead us believers today becoming a body counted as animals they come to the ass and just like that adam in the natural is showing ahead of time what the holy spirit is going to come here and what he's going to do lead us who is in these bodies he's going to lead us by the holy spirit of the living god hallelujah oh thanks be to god for this great holy spirit that leads us today amen praise god i'm happy today that the holy spirit leads us amen praise god he said because remember adam was not in the flesh form yet when he was commanding the trees and the animals and telling them what to do just like the holy spirit is here now and speaking to us and leading us but he's not in his body now amen but yet he's leading and guiding us enough authority over us praise god adam was not in his body yet he was control of the entire creation brother ben said that is a type of the holy spirit how he leads us today in this animal body that we are having here amen praise god and bringing us into subjection of the word of god spirit man a man and yet a person amen hallelujah praise the lord god but remember adam was of the lore a lower creation because there was a creation that took place of one thing light and that was the highest form of god creation and then comes adam afterwards and animals and all that stuff a lower form of creation and praise god because we know of course the higher form is the pillar of fire amen and how that god used that to express himself amen praise the lord i'm so glad brother sister for god's great shining light that he sent on the face of the earth not to shine like the sun shining out there but a supernatural light to shine in here the supernatural light to shine in our hearts and to shine on the word and bring the word of god to life just like the sunlight brings seeds and brings things to life on the natural earth this light of god over the word of god is supposed to bring life hallelujah or supernatural life amen thanks be to god for his great shining light upon us to move upon the earth again and to bring light and life praise god amen you know that's the same light that's going to shine in the new jerusalem hallelujah if you read the book of revelation it says there's going to be no sun and it'll be no moon is it because the lamb himself shall be the light thereof hey glory to god hallelujah thank you lord thank you lord he shall be the light for he is the light over and over again he tried to tell us this and even when i have read it for so many years and i understood to a certain degree it's white now for me to understand clearly when he said i am the light of the world he that fall with me shall not walk in darkness you're not talking about that dark out there he's talking about pillar of fire light up the world back then and if you follow that you'll never walk in spiritual darkness you'll never walk in the ignorance because you're led by god's great shining light hallelujah oh my do you oh i can't there's so many lights going off here can you imagine brother branham understanding that and when he sees that praying that three o'clock in the morning and he sees that little piece of light begin to whirl around coming down from in the roof and come down before him and then form amen in the form of a man oh my praise god hallelujah and begin to talk to him and often he would see that same light moving in the congregation moving over the people and doing things like that oh praise god forever listen there's a lot of obscure quotes if you you might not even notice where you say and i saw that elijah and the wind blew and his court move he was looking back and literally seeing the reality seeing elijah and when the wind blew it moved amen so just like moses was able to look back in creation and look back and tell you and the spirit of god moved here is a prophet in our generation looking back through the corridors of time and telling us what took place before the foundation of the world hallelujah oh my my my blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah amen the lamb shall be the light thereof no sun no moon but yet there's light where's the light coming from amen praise god the lamb sitting on the throne amen and maybe if i might visualize it maybe you just see a little light or a halo above his head but other than that the whole place is full of light amen lit up the entire place because all in god is light and in him there is no darkness at all hallelujah i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but he shall have the light of life amen praise god oh praise god he said you look he says you walk in the light while the light is with you go when this light goes away you'll walk in darkness you won't be able to do anything oh praise god no doubt they were wondering what is he talking about the moon the sun everything shining there and he's talking but he is the light amen you don't understand that he's referring to way back in eternities that he is that light and he is the purifier your your father's manner in the wilderness and the everyone dead and you don't recognize me moses recognize me you don't recognize me you right away you expose yourself you are of your father the devil for his works you will do amen praise god light in the wilderness god's great shining light shining into the hearts of men glory to god amen so blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah boy i praise god forevermore that that light i believe is shining on me and i thank god for that light and i was thinking about it and thinking about it you brother sister if the prophet said it and we say it but you really gotta grasp it you can't study your way into something like this it's not how many hours you're spending in books and listening tapes and you stay all night that's good but it's not that the first thing you've got to know is god revealed to you that you are one of his elected and the rest of it is almost like automatic he will reveal to you what you need to know when you need to know it of his own will of his own plan of his own purpose you can't break in through a window or through someplace else to break into it before he gives it to you you're just going to destroy yourself you're going to make a mess of things you just rest in the lord let go the secret the prophet said let go let the lord have his way let him work in your life let him reveal let him make known amen praise god hallelujah o blessed be the name of the living god amen hallelujah what will be the light the lamb will be the light the pillar of fire is going to be the light in that new jerusalem praise god hallelujah now go back to genesis again god himself was without form and he was there inhabited eternity and in all of the darkness and no light until he created light amen and remember a son or a child is something that come after parent is that right something come off the parent so what god created was a son amen the only begotten son some of you will remember the scriptures where it says uh the the begotten son the beginning of the creation of god amen now you can go to those scriptures and then oh your mind could go left right and center back into those codes the beginning of the creation of god when god began to create a part of himself amen and there it is praise the lord off of him amen so god said let there be light and there came forth the pillar of fire god became father of the son light that shines into the very hearts of men amen thanks be to god for his great shining light amen now one time the same quarter and doctrine questions and answers a brother asked uh brother branham uh if the pillar of fire was the son of man and brother branham says no the pillar of fire is not the son of man because in that form it's not yet come as the son of man it's only when he takes form then it becomes son of man this is me talking this is not a brand i'm answering now brother branham answered him and said no the pill of fair is the anointing pillar of fire is the holy spirit the anointing praise god hallelujah glory to god the first thing god come from god is the great pillar of fire and out of the purify come words because he's got to have it like that because it's the spirit that gives life to the word it's the spirit that quickens the world so here comes the holy spirit the pure of fire and out of that comes the word praise god hallelujah so that the spirit the life-giver to the lord could come and make the word live hallelujah oh i thank god for the holy spirit because you can have this bible and if the spirit don't come and anoint this word all you got is words all you got is a dead book this what is it he said the letter what kill it but the spirit giveth it life amen the spirit gives life to the word praise god you can be theologically right you can court you can have everything lined up you can have a thousand coats and you can even be perfect and have them right in line but they're dead unless the holy spirit amen quickens the word witness the word i don't mean to miracles the science the wonders but witness the word to bring back the light to the understanding of that eternal man on the inside of you is that right amen only that kind of being will understand that kind of a light because the light is eternal and the being and there is eternal and when the two of them come together it shines the light of god hallelujah o blessed be the name of the most high amen praise god hallelujah so god's light shining in this hour and in this time praise god lord of god so thank god that's the pillar of fire fell under their pentecost amen that pillar of fire broke itself up hallelujah amen broke itself up in little tongues of fire he's just signifying that all of them were attributes and they were a part of himself and he's just showing you that that took place that took place through his whole being and that his children are scattered through the universe and through the times through the ages through the dispensations they are there hallelujah and wherever they are part of the pillar of fire is coming for them the purifier is coming for them it's coming to them for them to identify them live in their move in them and have his being in them we are born again in him and he is born again in us glory to god hallelujah praise god amen yes sir oh my conduct order doctrine i think it's page 14 says here oh he was in other words adam the first man in the lore creation of the creations of god but the first creation was god himself amen what come out of him was god himself that he allowed that to manifest that way see then out of that came the logos which is the son of god hallelujah praise god amen yes out of that came the logos or the revealed word that we have now praise god that comes out of god amen oh is not marvelous and wonderful it didn't yet even take form in the form of jesus christ but the logos was there and you can of course john 1 1 is obvious to everybody well i'm saying this in the beginning read that scripture again and think after what you heard here what's the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word became flesh and dwelt among us the same god spoke and out of him he created something of himself and it start to and morphe god down from his glory ever living story my god and savior came and jesus was his name amen god and morphium himself coming down right through melchizedek angel of the covenant and so on right down to the very time look my mind was just going thinking oh my no wonder when abraham met him and he spoke to him at his tent door later on when he got down and in in sodom there to rescue lot and he met melchizedek the moment melchizedek spoke he recognized the voice because he met the person up on the mountain and the person spoke to him oh my and he recognized the voice immediately oh praise god forevermore jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever brother sister oh praise god hallelujah amen i'm so thankful to the living god the quickener of the word that he has made himself known to us by bringing us into a relationship with the logos not just the rima or the written part of the word but he was already the word before the word could be seen or known or man can give it form in writing right god give it form in a person they give it form in writing and it's good but the word we are talking about is not just this one that's written on the pages here where show me that in the bible show me in the quotes where is that over there where is this where is that no that sounds good it sounds logical somebody like that i'll answer them what they want to hear by saying yes brother you are right and he is right well leave it like that praise the lord but i don't know him just by knowing him here i know him by the shining light of gods hallelujah god's great shining sunlight of the revelation coming forth from the word of god and that's not a dead thing that's not something i got to go study for that's not something i've got to spend hours and years and something like that for it just it flashes like that on you it breaks on you like that and then you're going to say well how am i going to say this how am i going to say that i'm going to say it but just bang it's right there you didn't make it you're going to go i study hard boy and they're like no no no no no no nothing like that it's almost like you're not doing nothing you're just walking around like anybody else and you're just going around and i was like bang out of nowhere first of all you don't want something that you make up because that might be good for people layers that might be good for their body their emotions their mind the parts of you it will appeal to but that's not what the holy spirit is after god wants your heart god wants your heart so the real pull is always towards the heart of the believer praise be to god hallelujah i'm watching the time i'm going to start to wind this up now because we'll pick it up next week if it's all right with you praise the name of the lord hallelujah glory to god of course you know jesus said he is the light of the world amen i'm so glad that that's a light that's not even like the sunlight because the sun we got can only shine on half the world at a time is that right but he said no i am the light of the world hallelujah he lights up the whole world praise god doesn't matter which language what culture which country what color what nation doesn't care where you are when this change into your heart you see the same thing i'm seeing you see the same thing the other person is seeing because it's the same light of the world oh praise god you may express it in chinese and you speak japanese you must speak africa and the next one speaks some other language but it's the same word of god making yourself known in this hour glory to god no wonder he said you paul said what are you greeks and jews and and and this and that he says we are all offsprings of the almighty is that right we all offsprings of the almighty in other words you're on the inside you're a spirit being there's no color to you there's no culture to you there is no civilization to you the civilizations of man of course there's none of that to you the man inside is not made with attachments to any of these things here all we're doing is because we're in a body we fit in ourselves in the midst and we are we where we live in we managing and we can't wait for the time when we hear that voice saying come up here though lord of god your time you serve your
