TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] oh happy day oh happy day i say it was a happy day when i fixed my choice in jesus christ happy day when he washed my sins away thank god we're happy to be here today for his glory and honor may the lord jesus christ bless you in a marvelous and wonderful way tonight as we look into our marvelous uh bible study of the seven church ages i am now dealing with the subject of chosen in him chosen in him our scripture is found in john chapter 6 verses 37 and verse 44 which reads thus all that the father had given me shall come to me and him that commit to me i will in no wise cast out no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him and i will raise him up at the last day our gracious god and heavenly father there we have given the reading of thy word which we know faith cometh by hearing and hearing or understanding comes by the word of god oh may the great holy spirit move once again over the waters of the word and may life come forth from the word lord may creation come forth from the word lord may the eyes of the heart be opened to your glory and lord jesus may blinded eyes may deaf heirs open in the name of jesus and may the great holy spirit receive all the praise the honor and the glory this great teacher in the name of jesus christ amen and amen the scripture we read makes it quite plain that it's the lord jesus christ himself that does the choosing i have often referred to the old pentecostal hymn which we used to sing i took jesus as my savior you take him too you take him too you take him too i took jesus as my savior you take him too well that song was wonderful we love to sing it rejoicing but in actual fact the bible says you don't take him you don't choose him but he said clearly in the word of god i have chosen you you have not chosen me but i have chosen you listen to the word of god but as many as received him to them gave he the power to become the sons of god even as many as believed in on his name which were born not of blood not of just human blood nor of the will of flesh nor of the will of man but they're born but of god if clearly in the word of god ephesians 1 4-5 according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we would be holy and without blame before him in love being predestinated onto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will praise god now clearly we can see that in the choosing of a bride it is not the woman that goes out and chooses the man like any natural man the natural man or ordinary man chooses the woman in his mind in his heart by his secret choice before she knows that she has even been chosen or that she was even loved and chosen in the mind and heart of god of this man and so were the true beloved of god the true saints children of god wife of god were in his mind in his thoughts and in his divine choice before we consciously knew it that we needed the lord we needed a savior and so on and that we should then love him because he died on calvary we love him because he first loved us he chose us before the foundation of the world praise god a bride doesn't simply go out there and look at the various men and select them and said well that's the one that they're going to marry and choose him amen but the man chooses who he will marry and god made that choice himself you say about brother simon why do i have to repent of my sins why do i have to accept jesus christ as my savior well there it is he makes the choice but he still has to approach you like any man would have to approach the woman and then that woman will now have the glorious opportunity of accepting or rejecting that man's choice hopefully in the word of god and for jesus christ that we will make jesus our choice hallelujah glory to god but we do have a choice and the choice isn't accepting him or rejecting him but the original choice and choosing is not determined by uri that was determined by the very heart of god ephesians 1 9 says that that choosing he purposed he determined within himself can you imagine the lord had determined that he would have you as his bride that he would receive us and draw us attract us to his word by the holy spirit attracting us to the word of god it is in the word of god we read in romans 9 11 that the purpose of god by election might stand hallelujah god's heart purpose his eternal purpose was to choose you and i to be his bride before the foundation of the world and that purpose he had already purposed in himself in other words god would take a bride of his own choosing that was and decree that in his heart before the foundation of the world praise god now i want you to notice clearly that god did not choose a parrot or a monkey or some animal to be his bride or his wife he did not choose a chimpanzee that to be his wife but as he said in genesis 1 every seed will bring forth after its kind so god should chose a wife after his kind well god himself being eternal he could not choose a wife of time or that was born in time he had to choose a wife that has the same qualities as he has the same eternal qualities and so that bride that he or wife that god chose had to be eternal as he is eternal and being eternal she was a part of him for a man and his thoughts are one and that bride was in god's thoughts you see god used adam as a physical representation of himself that we as humans could have through our imagination our reasoning our conscience and so on a an idea of what actually he did before the foundation of the world now when it was time for adam to have a wife god did not go to the ground to the earth and find a wife for him or to create another being from a separate piece of dirt uh to form him but the bible tells us clearly that god took a part of adam a bride a rib of adam to be exact and god took that as the foundation for building or forming a bride a wife called eve for adam in that god was displaying what he did with himself to fulfill his divine purpose was not to find another uh kind of existence or being that was separate from him but he took a part of himself to produce or to make his wife manifested that she was a part of him so adam married a part of himself god married a part of himself oh praise god hallelujah even as adam and eve were one in the beginning for the bible says while they were standing there and he called their name adam praise god in the same way now in this last day as we receive him him believing and let him have glory within our hearts god looks and sees jesus christ standing there mrs jesus christ standing beside him and he calls their name together jesus christ hallelujah oh my god hallelujah for she is him now being revealed christ is the mystery of god being revealed the bride reveals him praise god hallelujah this great unchangeable god hallelujah making himself manifest or thank god this great doctrine of the manifestation of the sons and daughters of the living god in this last day praise god hallelujah amen praise god thank god that we could have been in him chosen in him and existing in him before the foundation of the world thank god god being omniscient omnipotent god being eternal god being all-knowing past present future god knows everything therefore listen god has never had a new thought thus says the prophet of god god has never had a new thought because god doesn't have to learn like you and i god doesn't have to take counsel or advice from anyone else he is perfection of perfection he is the all in all praise god hallelujah so the thoughts that he has are the thoughts that he always had amen so there is no new name or new sock going to be added on in glory but only those names that were written in his heart written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world only those names my friends are the ones that will be uh drawn pulled uh or made aware of who they are by the facility of revelation to recognize their position who they really are where they came from and therefore where they came from tells to them that they have blessed assurance of where they're going back to in the words of jesus and come from god and i go back to god we come from god we go back to god we came from eternity we go back to eternity oh praise god hallelujah we came from the bosom of the father we return back to the bosom of our loving father and his marvelous wonderful grace amen oh praise god the thoughts of god are eternal just as he is eternal hallelujah praise god may i say that again the thoughts of god are eternal as he is eternal the same quality in the husband the same quality and the wife the same quality of being amen human to human god to god god capital g to common g o d and so we see the same thing in the great god so god had his thoughts about us about adam and about us as his wife but those thoughts were yet unexpressed or unmanifested there were in his thoughts psalm 139 verses 15 to 16. my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest part of the earth then thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book with all my members hallelujah were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them none of them could be seen none of them were made manifested but these were already in his book and we were in his mind before the foundation of the world hallelujah praise be to god before we were even formed in our mother's womb god knew us because we were in his mind before the foundations of the world and now with the new birth we become expressed or manifested children of the living god hallelujah praise god but we don't comfort all at the same time we come forth in god's predestinated seasons of his word we come forth in the fullness of time that god has ordained in his mind for us to be made manifested if i might i may go back a little bit some of us came up in the in the various ages of the church first second third fourth some came up under luther wesley pentecostal message called another step out and now in the last day the message of malachi 4 5 the 20th century prophet said to call out a people for his name and for his glory we are called out by the name by this wonderful marvelous ministry back to the word of god in this season and time our spiritual food came to us in due season when we needed it that it might straighten us open our eyes turn our thoughts heavenward and godward and for us to look into the in the word of god look into the the waters of the river of god see our reflections in christ see our real self to know who we are and to recognize our place in him here we are friends we were in jesus christ we were in elohim we were back there in the midst of the logos we were god's eternal thoughts parts of the logos signified acts that x24 death pentecost when we saw little licks of fire hanging above the heads of every one of those apostles that the people could recognize he was trying to display they were all once a part of that logos that he had now broke up a part of himself or took a part of himself and was now placing it in human bodies like he placed jesus or or himself in a human body by the name of jesus christ and now in our day by the revealing of the word by the pillar of fire on the word by the light on the word by the understanding of the word given to you by god not by study not by man's wisdom not by the will of man by the theologies of man but by the grace of god he makes himself known to you so real hallelujah praise god that you realize that you are part of that same pillar of fire amen and now you become a part of the living word jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever glory be to his glorious marvelous name think of it you were in that book before the foundation of the world we were just in him but now the book is being expressed or manifested let me say it i've preached on the topic before we are now made to be the manifested book of redemption in our day and time praise god the holy spirit empowering us moving upon us flowing through us declaring himself through us to do what to attract the tension of the rest of his body the rest of his people that are have not yet known who they are and have not recognized themselves have not recognized that their position is supposed to be in christ and to follow the lamb wherever he leads them listen he had chosen us in him amen before the foundation of the world which means we were already in his mind we were ready in his thoughts before the foundation of the world and that automatically gives us an eternal quality so we are not just this body we have given a seed hallelujah and that germ of god that attribute is eternal and we have that eternal quality in these orton vessels which when they drop we rise in the presence of the living god because he that liveton believeth in me though he were dead though he would appear physically dead yet shall he live praise god hallelujah then jesus said destroy this body and raise it up upon the third day lord of god hallelujah amen we are not here by human instrumentality maybe your physical body came here by mom and dad but you the being that seed life in you came here vice election god's election placed you here place you into a certain certain body using a certain father and mother to get you here what god is looking for his children you and i searching for us lord of god hallelujah amen so we must be like when a child is born they look like their parents sometimes they talk like their parents they act like their parents they begin to get certain peculiarities like their parents and that's the way of the true seed of god they don't have to put an act on they don't have to try to be a christian they don't have to struggle and work and and be everything to be a christian they don't have to take a course on being a christian they don't have to my friends have a a great teacher teach us how to act like a christian how to study our part so that we know the right script and the right words and and the right actions at the right time how to act them out but it spontaneously flows out of the true child of god for its automatic because of the life that is within them hallelujah the great holy spirit working through them the life of christ manifesting through them makes them true christians their life itself living out through them for the glory and praise of the living god hallelujah amen they came out of egypt two million of them but when they got to the promised land only two from the original group joshua and caleb really made it over on the other side you say oh brother sign them there lots of them went over yes but they were the generation that was born in the wilderness the only original two ones that were originally out of egypt in the journey of canaan was joshua and caleb one in a million and he even saw in the natural process of god of selection with the sperm and the egg amen a million sperms may go forth but god ordained only one to unite with that egg to bring forth a natural life and so is it with the spiritual life one in a million god ordained his word to come in a predestinated time season and placed up predestinated and elected persons to whom the word will come and attach itself to them to bring forth a new creation a new life a new birth to walk in the will and the word of the living god hallelujah glory to god amen thank god for his precious word that we can walk and fellowship one with the other knowing who we are and who what we were raised up for and here i am here there you are together whether in this pulpit whether in your home veteran land sea or oh we raise our hands and give him praise hallelujah amen we give him praise that we are of that predestinated elected few of god we are of that original seed of that original life that god purposed in himself that we were in his mind before the foundation of the world that his purpose might stand praise the lord hallelujah amen glory to god amen amen glory to god we thank god you say oh the third pulled my friends cannot actually it can't be it can be copycatted but they can't actually impersonate it for it can't be impersonated for the true christianity is the person of jesus christ living again in the individual and making himself hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever it is the literal life of christ manifesting and working through those who were were elected with the original seed that he can unite have a uniting time to produce his own life his own children his own word his own manifestation through our lives for his glory and for his honor no ishmael can impersonate this no ishmael or esau could be a child of the promise could be a promised seed or could not manifest that seed to prove that it is the child of the promise oh glory to god hallelujah the revelation of the spoken word to the individual my friends is the very vindication identification of who they are they come from the presence of god and they're going back to the presence of god hallelujah oh what a marvelous and glorious time we are living in i am so happy that i am a child of the king oh blessed be his holy name the choosing of god the election of god then they are a piece or part of jesus christ the royal seed of god the elect the predestinated the foreknown of god that were in the mind of god that were his thoughts amen in plain language they are the true bride of jesus christ for they are a part of he himself if you want to say they're a part of his spiritual rib that has come forth from him to be made manifested upon the face of the earth and thus the bride is the literal spoken word seed bride of jesus christ she may appear to be feminine in her designation but remember him being the head the bible calls her his body so she is his body literally let's say it this way she is him in a many membered body she expresses him in many children she makes him manifested through this many member body through this these seven church ages and now in this age she is made manifested through the sons and daughters of the living god oh hallelujah amen so she is the son of man being revealed again revealed in bible days in the new testament and now he is being revealed again in the form of his wife in the form of a bride a bridefall but is still him making himself known aren't you blessed aren't you happy or do you rejoice at this i rejoice in christ my savior to know the marvelous mystery of god making itself clear and making himself known our father making himself manifested in the flesh of jesus christ and in him the scripture says was the fullness of the function head all the waters from the fountain or he is the fullness of the godhead bodily the godhead in a body oh blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah glory to his name so here is the with him the great one jesus christ while he was in the one body god himself took the title of son and there he was we were eternal in his thoughts and in our time and in our season through these church ages we have also become manifested hallelujah glory to god and beloved now are we the sons and daughters of the living god now are we the manifested book of redemption now are we the manifested children of the living god and the whole creation groans for this hour look at the pollution look at the destruction look at the climate change it's all taking place around us and the creation is groaning for this hour when we as sons and daughters of the living god are made revealed or made manifest for the world to know that there is difference there is something different something strange about them because god is making himself manifest through them praise god hallelujah isn't it marvelous to know this friends throw in the thought that the woman the wife was in the man the christ in elohim before the foundation of the world because of satan perverted thinking he twisted the entire thing around and now place man in the woman amen god had the woman in the man coming forth to be a rib or part of him but now satan by his procreation by his perversion has placed the man in the woman who comes forth with pain trouble sorrow toil labor and death oh thank god that's why we are the term born again free from sin i'm happy night and day oh it makes me want to shout there is no doubt thank god by the opening of the word i have been born again you have been born again we have been born again we have entered into the glorious fellowship of the mystery of those that are in christ glory to god here we are worshiping receiving while we are caught up in the in the great heavenly places in jesus christ with the going forth of the word of god hallelujah amen we don't become the seed of god by rebirth as falsely taught by many denominations when you are you're born again then you become a child of god a son of god a daughter of god as we have related before true sons and daughters of god did not now begin or become sons and daughters of god on a certain day or time for there were always eternal in him it's they who have only now come to realize and recognize who they really are blessed be the name of the lord oh i can hear my father calling i feel the pull oh my god the same he said no man chooses me i choose you and my father draws you what i can't explain what it is how it is but they said the holy spirit he himself will draw you unto himself we don't know what pull this is what drawing this is what attraction this is what is the attraction of christ hallelujah we are not here to imitate him but we are actually here to live the original life of jesus christ come to live in us move in us and have his being in us hallelujah only the true elected seed of god could be reborn for you were already in him before the foundation of the world and now you are being reborn to go back to being who you were and who you are from the very beginning praise god god sends the rain the refreshings of the rain from the presence of god to do what to wake up the seeds buried in this dirt of the human body that came by sin so in the eyes of it's dirt you're just covered on the dirt but and we all covered on the dirt how are we going to know the rains come the thunder rolls the lightning flashes the rain falls and brings forth a germination of the seed life of whatever that seed was then the seed comes up to manifest what it really is on the outside it might put on oh i'm a catholic i'm a baptist i'm a methodist it might put on religious regalia and religious clothing but when it begins to manifest it will show itself who it really is not by its choice but by god's election it begins to show forth what it is it can't help it because every seed must bring forth after its kind all glory be to god hallelujah therefore only the true seed can be genuinely quickened by the holy spirit to accept the word for this its day and for its time and when god begins to draw on call you know it's not a man you know it's not somebody's preaching you know it's not somebody persuasion but it was you by yourself god's supernatural uh pull draw by the holy spirit which he said i choose you i will draw you unto myself blessed is the man who are the woman whom i choose and draw and invite to come on to me oh praise god theirs is the kingdom of heaven oh blessed be the name of the lord o praise his name amen so you'll come back to him you come back to him that is why we find in the bible the word redeem which means to buy back or to restore back to the original owner and this is the preaching of the word that is here to bring you back to your original owner not the church not to this denomination not to this place that ministry or that ministry but you're brought back to god himself by the inspiration of the holy spirit and of the word of god for every seed as i said bring forth after its kind you are not a pig turn into a lamb you are not a dog turned into a sheep my friends the book of genesis tells you every seed must bring forth after his kind you cannot now just come and be a christian you had to be in his mind you had to be in his mind before the foundation of the world and now the holy spirit wakes that up and brings you to consciousness awareness revelation of who you really are and then you wonder you say oh now i see why it was so different now i see why i thought like that now i see why they treated me like that because sometimes the devil knows you are a child of god before you yourself knows oh my but glory to god it's the the words and the spirit is moving upon our hearts we were in the thoughts of god then expressed in flesh and then there had to come a day when we would hear our father's voice and hearing the voice become aware that our father is calling us and then he brings us a little higher where we begin to recognize that we are genuine sons and daughters of god children of the most high and then we hear his voice and we cry out like the practical son oh my father i've never seen you i don't know you physically but in my heart i feel the pull i hear a voice oh god forgive me cleanse me wash me lead me and guide me supernaturally father oh my glory god when that happens friends you don't need litany's you don't need all kinds of uh all kinds of prayer books you don't need all these church fundamentals you don't need church of superintendents you don't need bishoprics you don't need any of these things all you need is the word of god the guiding hand of the holy spirit the leading of the pillar of fire the holy spirit spirit bringing light upon the word amen a path of a just a man or woman it's like a shining light which shines onto the perfect day hallelujah oh my father saved me for i am returning back to you i'm talking about the germ i'm talking about the gene the genes of god that were buried in you hallelujah speaking back to this unseen eternal almighty one the mighty god in christ and saying oh my father save me i recognize you're calling me and i'm coming i'm returning to thee hallelujah a child of god can be a child of god a son or a daughter of god and go like that a long time before they recognize who they really are now i'm going to close my talk with the story of the eagle who lost an egg and then remember that a farmer had taken one of her eggs and planned taking it and that farmer placed it under a chicken and a chicken will hatch the egg as much as an eagle would and so when that eagle was born he found himself a among some a bunch of church chickens uh church members and he didn't know any better so he acted like one he he begins to think like them that fate was just cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap that's what he thought all they thought to eat was to scratch on the ground find a few worms here and there and feed on that but somehow there was a hunger in him he wanted fresh food fresh meat oh praise god something was pulling and drawing moving in him he was different he uh he appeared to be awkward amongst them because he got these long talons long beacon and like latin when they went cheap cheap and he tried to say cheap cheap it would come out with the eagle scream the cry of an eagle hallelujah and he didn't know why that was why couldn't he be like the rest of them but one day that mother eagle remembered passed over that barnyard and let out the scream amen he had never heard a scream of voice he never heard a word like that but somehow in the deep of his heart he recognized that voice he recognized the call he recognized the language and who it was amen praise god son jump on that on that fence jump fly up here he tried to fly up but he could only fly up as far as the pen uh the fence post come up here the son of god come up hither child of god come up higher hear the daughter of god come up hither and he tried to fly up a little higher until he realized that he was crawling on the ground all the time when he had two great wings that the chickens didn't have that he could use them to fly up into the things of god and to recognize the word for his day and for his hour oh praise god thank god that little ego answered the call as you are hearing the voice of god in the word of god today will you answer his call will you respond to his pull will you my friend take one step two steps towards him praise god and receive the eagle's cry receive the eagle's voice and the eagles call to your heart amen once you said yourself brother simon in the midst of all you're saying i hear the cry of the great eagle as a true child of god son of god i hear the cry of the spirit coming through the word and speaking to my heart i realize the word of god is calling me calling me calling me calling me to the everlasting eternal christ who is now seated in heavenly places and i want to say father i am coming home to thee oh lord jesus we thank you for the preaching of thy word i pray you will draw unto yourself all those who are your genuine ones your beloved ones in christ whoever they are wherever they are when the last one comes in oh god the rapture goes i'm just here doing my part to call out your elected your elected ones father may thy perfect will be done may your name be glorified and may i be able to sing with mint in my heart i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them i'm one of them hallelujah one of them i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them or my friends may god bless you and may you be able to say with confidence and blessed assurance i am so glad that i can say i am one of them god bless you we'll see you on sunday as
