TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] a good wednesday evening to you all i welcome you in the name of the lord in the presence of the lord to receive the word of god of course today our subject will be the place of satan's throne may god bless our meditations as we look into the word of god i know you have just come through the first part of the week with its various tests challenges and blessings so let us rejoice in the lord let's give the lord praise let's give him thanks and adoration for what he has done within our hearts and within our lives with his divine protection with his divine provision praise god and now his blessings upon us showers of blessings by the opening of the word or the breaking of the bread of life i'd like to read out of revelation chapter 2 reading verse 13. i know thy works and where thou dwellest even where satan's seat is and thou hold as fast my name and has not denied my faith even in those days wherein antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where satan dwelleth amen gracious heavenly father with thankful hearts for the word of god coming upon our lives giving us divine moisture so that the life in us can spring up lord and blossom and bloom lord to become whatever you want us to be that we might walk and live in the perfect stature of the perfect man jesus christ bless us all together father for we ask it in jesus name last week we talked about nimrod and how that nimrod founded his religion and the religion was around worship of himself and worship of his wife uh es astarte uh later on uh that of course has evolved to our present time and our modern day we also brought to your attention that the bay bell instigated by nimrod babylon founded by his father but later developed into a great city by nimrod and his wisdom and his organizational abilities he was able to create this marvelous city of babylon now we have been showing how that that very uh thought of nimrod and religion of nimrod how he penetrated the roman empire and how the roman empire true uh constantine thinking that he was doing good and trying to unite the church of god the good seed and the bad the pagan priesthood the pagan babylonian priesthood that had come to the borders of rome under their king atulus and there they were practicing their pagan religion under their priest king atulus now at that time when constantine tried to create a unity or a church union today we call it the world council oh amen so here it was that he tried to do that way back then and then when one side won the debate because of government power favor influence they forced or pushed their ideas upon the true church of god which was pushed out in every possible way and the roman empire the as a military power at that time began to transform itself into a religious power under the influence of these babylonian priesthood that had penetrated christianity usurp the names and titles of christianity the labels and placed it on themselves and their false gods calling them by christian names knowing full well they might have been venus astarte jupiter job juno whatever but the names were changed and christian names were placed on them astarte of course changed everything changed but a nice christian name was placed on it and now it has become acceptable paganism posing as christianity and the roman empire which was once a military force transformed itself into a religious force or religious power one of religious influence and control hence the bible god in his divine wisdom describes it as mystery babylon an evil system of paganism politics and religion all mixed into one displaying itself as a tree-headed hydra a hydra-headed monster now we asked you to read out of daniel chapter 2 verses 31 to 45 in which we received from daniel his interp interrupt god's interpretation through daniel of the king's dream and danielle speaks the whole king source and behold a great image danielle saw a great image and the image's head was made of fine or pure gold the breast and arms were made of silver pure silver the belly and the ties were made of brass the legs and feet were made of iron the legs were made of iron but then the feet was made of iron and clay now daniel's further said and i saw stone as it were cut out from the mountain the size of a man's hand oh praise god oh and that stone came and struck the image and the image was shattered and broken down into pieces and as he says and became like the shaft of the summer threshing folk floor and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smoked the image became a mountain and filled the entire earth this is the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king and then he started to interpret you thou o king art the head of gold that is the king of babylon was the head of gold and he went on to interpret that and show how these things would be displayed of course that was the king's dream but of course the king's dream as danielle brought god's interpretation by the holy spirit of that dream was really a revelation of future history future history from the time uh that daniel spoke those words until the time that jesus comes again not in the rapture for his church but at the ending of time when he comes again to rule and reign after the tribulation period is over he comes to rule and reign as the son of david the son of david which is to say his the physical being of jesus came out from the seed of david so he comes now back as the seed of our son of david now that same period of time from danielle to when christ returns is called the times of the gentiles it's known as the times of the gentiles well he also made plain to us so we can understand that history would be unfolding in four parts at that particular time and during the first part during these parts it will be controlled and influenced by four powers one the the head of gold the babylonian empire would rule the world and have influence and power the media persian empire would be the next and then comes the grecian empire followed by the roman empire of course the babylonian empire was the greatest naturally speaking it was the greatest and the most powerful and the wisest the wisdom of nimrod worldly wisdom earthly wisdom it was the wisest at that particular time then followed by those medial persians which history bears out that they were a little less than the babylonian empire but still very powerful in the events world events they were followed by the greeks and the greeks were are brilliant leaders with military minds able to uh go out into great military wars of that time and finally came the roman empire typified or tight by the legs and the feet now while all the other kingdoms were shown by god to be pure metals pure materials like gold and silver and brass we find that this roman empire starts out as iron but it ends in defeat as a mixed material of iron and clay so it's a hybrid mixed with iron and clay now think of it my friends we know that soil and iron doesn't really mix they don't mix just simply doesn't work because it will have no consistency and or strength if you try to mix soil along with iron but the most amazing thing is that this roman empire would endure in that mixed hybrid state until jesus comes again now let us study this roman empire it's necessary for us to uh study and understand history some history that is in line with scripture so we can understand the scripture better but here it is this roman empire of iron of course iron signifies power and great destructive force against uh anything it comes against it would be with destructive uh force right now the roman empire was uh divided into two parts like two legs uh of of the of this great image two legs so here are two parts even to this day east and west the eastern part and the western part there it was and iron clay east and west two divisions two feet there they were both powerful and crushing power between the two of them but like all the other empires before it fell they all vanished away in the dustbin of history and the roman empire also fell we've seen there are many books written on that fall of the roman empire but here it is rome fell and thus pagan rome imperial pagan rome was no longer the iron that it was with its with its divisions and legions marching conquering everywhere the iron fist of rome the iron fist on our iron feet i should say off-road for there were great marchers great legionnaires great soldiers fighting formations and everything else yes disciplined and even so they would have that in their in their particular uh church or temple they would have disciplines strong forceful disciplined just as if they're in an army it's another kind of army it's now a religious army but however she crumbled and the roman empire fell it was wounded to death as the book of revelation tells us the beast was wounded unto death but when the world sought that the roman empire was over and it was done it was finished it really was not dead it was only wounded here it is worst uh translation of revelation 13 verse 3 and one of his heads appeared to have been mortally wounded the truth having been slashed and his head his death stroke was healed and the whole earth followed after the wild beast in amazement now people look at rome they look at the nation of italy and they don't realize that it's two different things for rome itself is a nation within the nation of italy the city of rome is ruled over by the pope who is bought emperor and priest we will understand later uh a little more of this but his dominion is actually there and i have stood there and watch ambassadors coming with flags of various nations of watch apostolic delegates going and coming doing diplomatic uh charges and works of which they have to do about stamps that are vatican stamps bought in their post office because it is a legitimate nation among the nations that is why many do not understand there's a difference between the catholic church and all the other churches because all the other churches are just churches but the catholic church it's a nation that has extended itself by religion into every other nation on the face of the earth and the churches so-called and cathedrals are like semi-embassies that is a reason why in the in that church one can flee and have sanctuary if they're a catholic uh just as much as if you're an american you can flee for sanctuary into an american embassy if you are french you can flee into a french embassy and so if you're under a pressure or or the law or or anything of that nature one can flee into that catholic church and receive sanctuary and protection there because it's literally an extension of the nation of rome ruled by the pope of rome who is bought king and priest not just a priest not just a preacher but king emperor and priest now of course they have their own ambassadors and receiving ambassadors and now this papal false christian rome even calls herself the eternal city that of course is blasphemy for the only eternal city is the jerusalem of god above there is none other they may say oh it's just a figure of speech to say it will endure but the bible says different the bible says in one hour the whole thing will be burned and destroyed by the judgments and powers of almighty god amen now here it is my friends we know that this now controls instead of controlling by military power as rome did in the past remember i said rome the roman empire has morphed or has transformed itself from a religion a military imperial political power into a religious power now controlling not so much by military power it still uses the military power and the laws law enforcement of every nation on the earth but in actual fact it now controls by the religion it controls by that form of christianity they called christianity their brand of it which is contrary to the word of god now we see then why god in his infinite wisdom called it mystery babylon a place of chaos confusion are all manner of mixed up languages towns knowledges coming out of it to confuse the minds and the hearts of men from one god to tree from believing in one god to their to believing into the pagan faith of three gods in one and so they can now control even more and are more powerful than imperial rome was because they control even more people and their control is not only over the physical bodies of the people within their empire but this form of this mystery babylon now controls by the narcotic of false religious belief using the very word of god for their purposes so they're doing a greater job now from the millions imperial rome controlled now they are they control billions of people who have received that kind of a false faith not knowing its origin and its background of course imperial rome received a new or was revived from its wounds by the emperor constantine and his dream and his good thoughts of trying to unite the empire and how he backed the uniting and the mingling of the two seeds at nicaea rome 325 a.d that spirit that motivated him is still loose in the world today still anointing the roman empire spiritually and causing it to push like constantine did back there for the uniting of all the churches it pushes the same way he did to unite the churches today by acumenism by the world council of churches bringing them together using the word of god how that jesus said we should be one not having any revelation not having the spirit of god making it known clear what that is about but we know friends i repeat the former roman imperial power military power never really went out of existence on the surface it appeared that rome had fallen and disappeared into the dust bin of history but in actual fact under constantine i repeat 3 25 80 it rose from the dead it came out of its seminary its cemetery and rose up once again all it did was change its outer appearance an outer texture from an attacking uh force to one that appears meek and mild like a cat until it is disturbed and then the claws came comes out then the spitting then the cruelty then the opposition comes out out of it changing itself from military to religious now once the power had shifted at the isa council and they had received power from present time after that most of the believers who were jews at the time were expelled out of the city of rome they filled the gap moved into power and influence and it seemed as if they would go to no limits the witch they will go in persecuting the true saints of the living god and now they put on the cloak of the name of christianity the very name which at first was persecuted cursed swear uh the word christian back then it's not like today people are proud oh i'm a christian i'm a christian back then nobody wanted to be known as a christian because to say you're a christian was to court your own death and the persecution and the torture of your family so they they hid from the name they didn't want the name but once they had power now they adopted the name and under the cover of that name they began to perpetrate their religious crimes of history the inquisition and so on now friends it was in this stage 354 a.d to 4 30 a.d you may have heard the name of the bishop augustine augustine of hippo and he was the one or architect the one who propounded the idea and the thought that the church ought to and that the church must use force let me repeat saint augustine was the one who proposed propounded and preached the fact that the church otto was supposed to and must use force in order to bring all her children back into the fold by force and violence he said it was in the heart in harmony with the word of god to kill heretics and to kill apostates and those that differed with them oh my think of it yet he is revered in history he's looked up to everywhere to those who do not know the truth that he propounded this thought listen i can't give you the entire quote but you may read this in augustine's controversy with the donatists amen you can read it over there and you'll find that he was one who pushed for this while these donatis d-o-n-a-t-i-s-t-s were pushing that for the opposite to leave the christians alone but here in his talks against them is argumentations against them he said that should be compelled by fear or compel them by pain so that they may afterwards be influenced by teaching so that they might follow out and act what they have learned from the word of god he even went as far as using paul the apostle paul as an example of what he really meant he said that paul was at first only constrained are called by god's voice but then paul was dashed on the ground by force and by power he was thrown to the earth and then he was struck by blindness by power and by force wherefore i'm quoting him now why therefore then should not the church use force in compelling her lost sons and daughters to return the lord himself said go out into the highways and byways and hedges and compel them to come in therefore the power that the church has received by divine appointment in its new season is true religious character and true the faith of kings in other words the compulsion they can exercise is through using governments kings amen to be the instrument by which those who are found in the highways and the bibles are compelled to come in then let them not find fault with being compelled by us by by them by the church they should not feel bad about being compelled well we can see this evil monster its lips red tripping with the blood blood thirsty for the blood of the saints dripping with blood as we can see my friends the false vine in spain played upon the emperor maximus to join into the attack upon true believers who had the word of god the power of the holy spirit and signs of the supernatural working and moving amongst them now these same personalness were brought to shreves 385 a.d he accused christians of witchcraft of immorality uh they did not understand like the communion and stuff like that so they thought it was cannibalism they thought it was witchcraft and everything else and many were executed but two bishops martin of tours and ambrose of milan they opposed absolutely protested and pleaded for the true believers they did not heed them and the persecutions continued and from this time on right through the dark ages of the church we will see the children of the flesh persecuting those of the spirit we will see clearly here friends the false vine persecuting the true vine the seed of cain the children of nimrod persecuting the children of the word jesus christ the living word persecuting children of the living word both claiming god be to be their father just like cain and abel claim eve to be their mother and adam to be their father but we know from scripture that cain was the son of the devil it is said in first john cain who was of that wicked one right and that's not just a a reference he was the son of satan a son of the serpent who was not a snake but walked upright like a man reasoned like a man intelligent like a man but had no soul and therefore satan used him as the instrument to intermingle himself with the entire human race so here we have the seed of the serpent and the seed of god and the seed god promised from that time the seed of the woman will bruise the serpent's head will bruise the serpent's seed by the power of the holy spirit and the word of god just as it was ishmaelian isaac what could claim abraham to be their father but one of god and one of the devil so on see the parallels throughout the word of god from genesis right into the book of revelation you may see him right there in the word of god the darkness of spiritual corruption began to deepen and the true light of god the word that was given the fate once delivered to paul of peter and all the original saints began to fade as the babylonians mystery teachings and religion mingled and mixed in with the word of god began to take precedence their trinitarian doctrines of many gods saints and so on began to take precedence it pushed out the truth of god's word hero israel the lord thy god is one lord there is only one god and that jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new for of course jesus means jehovah is our savior oh blessed be his holy and precious name and so friends the true light of god began to fade out under the pressure the enchants persecution and inquisitions during that time until it was just glowing faintly yet thank god the promise of god still holds true the light shaded in the darkness and the darkness can do nothing about it and in the prophet zechariah saying that even though the darkness would try to push out the light the prophet prophesied but it shall be light about the evening time oh praise god just about coming to the end of the age time for jesus to return he made a promise that the light would be restored back into the church of god and i believe that's what we have been receiving that is causing the holy ghost to react to his people and through his people and with his people for his glory this is also the fulfillment of malachi 4 5 god saying i will restore or praise god the faith of the children back to the fathers is speaking of us restoring the faith of the children back to the apostolic fathers to receive the fullness of the word as they had it and give praise glory and honor to our god we're on the move we're on the charge our god is working and moving by his spirit to fulfill his word in this our day and this our time oh my friends here it is my friends let us remember and recap how nimrod came and asked the people to unite to build bay bell and so god came down and destroyed it and split up the towns and nations were scattered abroad in the face of the earth and he in rebellion to god formed his own religion and his own army as we talked he was the first to form an army teach discipline teach order systems of government he was the first to do that and my friends here it was he entrenched his babylonian religion with himself at the head his wife next to him astarte of course venus is the same name in the greek language and you'll find the same name but in other languages it's called differently today you may want to use a religious term on that no but here it was my friends that he formed his own religion pagan religion and we taught you you taught your true history how that religion morphed mingled and mixed itself into genuine pure christianity and saw spiritual pollution so polluted it until genuine real one god one christ christianity was pushed out out of the picture and the true is looked upon as if it's false and the false being in power and in denomination and influence is now looked upon as if it is the true church now my friends we find out how the king i told us a follower of nimrod's religion fled to the outskirts of rome and set up his kingdom and it flourished because of course the god of this world helped him to cause it to flourish there was a great succession of priests kings under atolus until the reign of atulus iii and for some unknown reason but when he was dying he willed his entire kingdom an authority over to the kingdom of rome at that time ruled by julius caesar it is at this point that historic potpourri began or the historic origins of potpourri began so then caesar took bought the military physical kingdom he was ruling and married it to the idols of attolos the pagan priest rome was already pagan but military in its structure but now it becomes completely married it's as it were ephraim married to his idols to this babylonious religion and took it and thus he became what military physical head and the spiritual head becoming a priest king an emperor and yet the priest from this we have the term pontifex maximus remember pontifex maximus a priest king supreme power of that empire of being bought emperor and priest of course that following that that title was passed on down from emperor to emperor right on until the time of maximus the third emperor maximus iii and he refused it he didn't want it and according to the history of stephen's or stephen's history my friends today there is still a pontiff in the world and he is truly the pontiff maximus for he still wears the triple crown and my friends he still resides in rome in revelation 17 god does not no longer refer to portuguese as he read in revelation 2 13 as the seat where satan dwelleth god does not refer anymore to it just my friends as babylon and saying satan's seat is in babylon but now god began begins to call it and identify that spirit as mystery babylon for now it's gone into a spiritual atmosphere and therefore now becomes mystery babylon so when we speak of mr babylon you must understand we're speaking of how uh nimrod through the ages through the caesars right on down has brought organization military precision mixed into religion discipline right and all that the very discipline of and brought order or orders into religion complete obedience total and complete he enforces it and so we have mystery babylon with us and mr babylon in a city with seven hills on seven hills and the head of it the king priest who has usurped the position of jesus christ calling himself vicarius philia i die we will speak on that at another time or praise god saying or thinking he alone is the mediator when our bible tells us there is one mediator between god and man and it he is jesus christ amen makes the claim he alone can forgive sins on the earth contrary to the word of god when we know that jesus christ is the only one who died for our sins the only one who has the power to forgive us of our sins and we put our faith in him but still while we are given real genuine forgiveness from jesus christ this pontifex maximus is here now upon the earth may god help us in this dark dim twilight hour but we rejoice in the fact that god can give us assurance telling us before the time that this would happen but when it happens and it begins to become dark it becomes troublesome he says at evening time when it's dark it shall be light it shall be light again he'll restore the word he'll bring us back to the original fate of our fathers the faith once delivered to the saint may god bless you all may god bless us all as we revel as we take the word of god with rejoicing hearts and believing the word and promise for this day may you be straightened may you be enlightened may your eyes may your heart be opened and may god build your rock foundations upon the revelation of his word which will stand forever god bless you my friends we'll come together again on sunday in the presence of the lord as we once more feed and feast upon god's word for today god bless you [Music] you
