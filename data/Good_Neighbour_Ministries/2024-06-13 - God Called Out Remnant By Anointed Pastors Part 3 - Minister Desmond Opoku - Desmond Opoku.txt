children hallelujah amen thank you Lord father bless your word in Jesus name we pray amen War be unto pastors that destroy the destroy and Scatter the Sheep of my pasture said the Lord therefore thus said the Lord God of Israel against the pastors that Feed My People ye have scattered my flock and driveing them away and have not visited them behold I will visit upon you the evil of your doings said the Lord I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whether I have driven them and will bring them again to to their foes and they shall be fruitful and increase and I will set up Shepherds over them who shall feed them and they shall fear no more nor be dismay neither shall they be lacking said the Lord behold the days cometh said the Lord that I will rise unto I will raise unto David a rightous branch and a king shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and Justice in the earth in this in his days Judah shall be saved and Israel shall dwell safely safely and this is the name whereby he shall be called the Lord our righteousness therefore behold the days cometh said the Lord that they shall no more say the Lord leaveth which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt but the Lord liveth which brought up there which brought up which f which led the seed of the House of Israel out of the North country and from all countries whether I have driven them and they shall dwell in their own land we're going to go to Ephesians Ephesians 4 Ephesians 4:7 to1 but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he said when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now at now that he ascended what is eight but that he also descended first unto the lower part of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up for above far above of Heavens that he might fill all things and he has he shall and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelist and some pastors and teachers may the Lord add his Blessing unto his word amen glory to God I think last time I I I wanted to finish this message today if the Lord willing let's see what the Lord have in store for us last time we talk about about the false prophet we talk about uh uh we talk about the Ahab and His prophets that were lying prophesied you know that the we talk about Ahab how he trained his own prophets to prophesy for him so when the time come when they wanted to get the the their land that God gave to them he tried to pursue uh jaset and Je is there any because there was something that Jeet found out was funny so all 400 prophets all all of them were one because why he has trained them for himself it's not this is the man that's why God doesn't want this denomination with with their mind set when they go to school you you can go to school to study and do everything but you cannot study God in the school the man who is teaching you in the school there he doesn't know God he know by the letter and the letter you cannot understand God by the letter you have to understand God by Revelation Hallelujah God has to reveal himself to you before you can as you as we are all sitting here we know each other but the deep inside of us nobody don't know unless you have I have or you have fellowship with me and I introduce I reveal myself to you before you can really understand me see that's why God said this denomination is not of God cuz all their man is one you remember when they met B Abraham in Chicago they all W and they send somebody to me brother Braham brother Braham never went to school but he has God God was with him and when they send somebody to him what happened by the time the man get there God has revealed all their desires all their crooked ways how they going to encounter him oh glory to God we have God I said we have God who knows all things everything that you speaking your secret chamber God knows everything Hallelujah this is the god that we serve he never change that's why you have to worship God in truth and in spirit we cannot deceive God no man can deceive God the people in this world the preachers and all those to who are fult are deceiving themselves they cannot deceive you because God said he has you on the palm of of his hand so nobody can take you away from his hand Hallelujah this is the god that we serve so when the the the Elijah call there's one Prophet here he said any any Prophet here that we can uh inquiring he said there is a why here but that one day he doesn't favor me he he every time he come he against me I hate him say said let the king say so you hate you know hat come from what the devil so right there he show his character so when they went there to get Mah you know what he said where as the Lord leaded whenever whenever God tells me is what I'm going to speak so when he came you told they asked him all this one of they sent one of the Prophet go went there and then he said we are all one man let not your mouth say another thing all of us are one that's why the churches he said we are all one they are all one denomination they say all in one Father the Son the Holy Ghost we're going to speak in tongues we're going to do this we're going to do this but it's not one God word is one that's what we have to believe any man were to be a liar let God we to be the truth amen so when he came and the man they ask him said go up you see I told you I told you he not going to prophesy anything good for me when brah spoke to them spoke to them what did they say they all all MTH was one they don't want to repent and come to the real word of God that is the one that is taking them to heaven let me tell you I always said you cannot come to this message and believe this message and leave this message and be a very foolish virgin no it does not work if he comes to know the truth and rejected it you God is not taking you down there you have to finish the work Hallelujah you have to cross the line we going to we going to we're going to read about that Hallelujah and then when he spoke the word of God I see the Israelite go without a shepherd and then what happened they burn him and they smack him and they tell them he told them if you come back I'm I'm I put a sign on me I'm a false prophet see the lying Prophet always what do violence they always try to persuade to shake you to believe but believing is not for shaking believing is from the heart because you are the seed when God calls your name you respond hallelujah amen so they they show their colors because the Bible said by their fruit you shall know them and you know when Jeremiah spoke about that there was another another false prophet in uh in the Jeremiah I think 20 8 let me see if I can read a little bit over there for you to see there Jeremiah 28 let me see Jeremiah Jeremiah 28 uh okay and it came to pass the same year in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of Judah in the fourth year in the fifth month and hanania hanania was another Prophet that's a lying Prophet the son of zua the prophet which was gibon speak unto me in the house of the Lord and before before Jeremiah has prophesied that they are going to they are going for slavery for 70 years so this man going to prophesy against Jeremiah in the presence of the priest and and all the people saying thus speaketh the Lord of host the god of Israel saying I have broken the Yoke of the king of Babylon within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the Lord the Lord's house then that Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon took away you see every time you do God speak and you speak against him sometime you shorten your life very very very do not pray with the word of God because the word of God is absolute God does not joke about his word hallelujah if we are believers let us be Believers Hallelujah king of nebuchad the king of B took away this place and carried them to Babylon and I will bring again to this place jeona the son of jeim the king of Judah with all captivity of Judah that went to Babylon said the Lord for I will break the Yoke of the kings of Babylon then the Prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hanah in the presence of the priest and and in in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the Lord even the Prophet Jeremiah said a man aen aen the Lord do so he said amen the Lord do so the Lord perform thy wordss which thou Hast prophesied to bring again the ver of the Lord house and all that is Carri away captivities from Babylon into this place nevertheless hear thou now this word that I spake in thy years and in the years of all the people the prophet that have been before me and before thee of all prophesy both against many countries and against Great kingdoms of war and of evil and of pestilence the prophets which prophet side of Peace when the word of the Prophet shall come to pass then shall the prophet be known that the Lord has truly sent him when he prophesy and the prophecy comes to pass that's the Vindication of the true Prophet Hallelujah then Hanah and Hanah the prophet took the Yoke from off the Prophet Jeremiah neck and break it see right away the violence started because because two the F and the true have Christ remember both of them are in the church they are ministers to the people this is not a somebody outside from Africa he came to Canada no this is Israelites and they called them prophets Hallelujah and Han spoke Han spake in the presence of all the people saying th said the Lord even so I will break the Yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of All Nation within the space of two full years and the pro and the Prophet Jeremiah went his way he doesn't what fight because the word is not for him the word is for the Lord so there's no need for we God has placed the truth in our mouth when you speak the word of God and they don't listen you don't have to fight go God is the one who is going to fight for his word our we are messengers of Christ to release the word of God and God himself will testify of it hallelujah what a word why we have to fight cu the B is not ours the B is for the Lord amen then the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the prophet after that herah and the prophet has been had broken the Yoke from off the neck of the Prophet Jeremiah saying go and tell Hanah say thus said the Lord thou H has broken the Yoke of wood but thou shall make for them yoke of iron for the for thus said the the Lord of host the god of Israel I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all the these nations that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon and they shall serve him and I have given him the breast of the field the Beast of the field also then said the Prophet Jeremiah unto Hanah the prophet here now Hanah the Lord has not s thou makest this people to trust in a liar is very very dangerous for those preachers false preachers speaking standing in front of God creation God people to speak lying words upon their ears unto their ears you know how deadly it is hallelujah we thank God God has sent us a prophet and vindicate him that listen to him Hallelujah and the same time he has given his pastors to lead us through this message and God himself will testify and vindicate them and when God give it to you you have to listen to them otherwise you heading towards Doom Hallelujah you just listen thank you Lord therefore thus said the Lord behold I will cast thee from off the face of the Earth this year thou shall die who will die the false prophet those false teachers standing in the pet preaching the word of God with their own benefit they are already dead Hallelujah they are already dead but they don't know in my country we have a lot of snake I killed a lot of snake when I was young because I I my mother was a farmer and I was a farmer too and snake when you you meet snake sometime if you don't kill him he going to kill you so there's a snake called PA ARA this snake love to sleep when he swallow in in when he eat he can sleep three or four days you can cut the head off he never wake up and when he wake up he can just flip everywhere flip everywhere thinking the head is there the head is already Cho off but he think it is alive so did this Pentecostal and the rest of the church God is not there but they are jumping flipping up and down dancing and everything but God said they are dead hallelujah thank God for the word of God that God has sent as a prophet right now in this last age and now he has introduced the bride to the Lord Jesus Christ himself now God himself is the one leading the Church the true church God anointed the true pastors to lead the children of God so if God bless every church that God has anointed a pastor to lead them Breen wherever you are if you are listening hold on to that Pastor and listen to him he will lead you through we are almost home the worst thing the man can do himself is to leave this message leave this bright and head toward back there you are heading towards Doom Hallelujah brethren hold on it doesn't matter what circumstance Comes Your Way hold on we are almost home this gospel is true if some a false Pastor come God himself will give you a revelation understanding in your heart he has God himself is dwelling in you so don't be afraid don't be scared hold on for the gospel that God has given to you Hallelujah this man so Han the prophet died the same year in the seventh month before God kill instantly people does not understand God does not change now he's dealing with a gentile with a spiritual so you die in spiritual Hallelujah no physical sometime if you fool around in the Pres when God is manifesting right there and you go there and challenge sometime you can die instantly God can keep because he does not want nobody to interrupt his word God is always on his word hallelujah thank you Lord this is what happened to her he was false prophet hallelujah thank you Lord Oh Our God is good let's check something at Timothy Timothy chapter 3 verse 1 Timothy chapter 3 verse1 this now this know also that in the last day pous times shall come perious time shall come for men shall be lovers of their own self cous boasted proud Blasphemous disobedient to parents UNT for Unholy without natural affing truth Breakers false accusers in Inc content incontinent in incontinent Fierce incontinent incontinent Fierce despises and those that are good trest hey highmed lovers of pressure more than the lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away these are the false teachers prophets and they called the Evangelist Hallelujah they are not preaching for the welfare of the children of God they are preaching for the what for thems for their life what do you think these people go to school for so many preachers men and women what they go to school for everybody go to school education to do what to work for their living so that they can live get their salary and Stu and then leave so they go to school to get a certificate like Ahab did train them he pay them that's exactly what is happened to our days their denominations they pay them and they when they pay them that's their salary so what they do is that they prepare all their sermon for them for the whole year if you don't teach what they want you to teach you do you gone you hear what brother brother Simon testimony you are contrary to our teachings so what we excommunicate you hallelujah thank God Jesus found us when they excommunicate you Jesus find you and here you ah glory to God and this is what is going on this world when you go and preach the word of God you testify the word of God my pastor you said my church doctrine say this the word of God has no Doctrine for for my this church because they have their own doctrines you have to baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the woman can preach the woman can cut their hair the Bible say do not cut your hair the woman your hair is the glory of God if you cut your hair and you pray God will not hear you it's not in the in the Bible it's in the Bible so if you do that and you pray and you come down say God reveal to me this and that and that yes it could be revealed to God and His word he revealed to you you alone that knows but it's not the word of God you already broke the word of God hallelujah you going to see the preacher the woman preacher they have a special way they cut their they cut this side here and they cut this side here and they J here they J here they J here when they come and they make like like that like every sply and they come with their High ha and what what they do Hallelujah glory to God the Lord spoke to me and they jumping everywhere hey don't let me talk Hallelujah they have their way to persuade you Hallelujah can you woman this woman wear this he he he he said the anointing hit him he fell down and he jumping everywhere like this and like this if you don't get there this high hill going to take you out from here to the back ony there Hallelujah said mascara everywhere lip shine everywhere tight clothes tight everything and he said the Lord spoke to her and when you tell them you are destroying my church my brothers my sisters nobody can give it to you it's your own we are Gentiles everybody's their own the Bible said you your husband lay here your wife lay here you wake up one slowly slowly by the time you get out he's already gone you looking for him he disappear that's that's the way I came to this message God revealed to me about that I wake up brother Mar was not there he said that's where the Rapture going to be and he get what so I begin to ask my am I too late to give myself to the I have to run like a jet to get my portion that's why I'm standing here hallelujah I will never let it go this this gospel you chop my head off right there that's I'm going Paul what did they do to Paul because of the truth he died for the truth he died for the truth steeven died for the truth so don't think this gospel is different than how what they die for is the same it never change if Paul said we going to go through persecution yes so just hold on hold on tight the word is absolute God said you will never leave you nor forsake you he be he will be with you till the end of this world Hallelujah Brethren whatever you last time I told I told no no if you quit from this gospel you are not of one of his own because there is no place in the word of God that you have to quit how many see people quit in the Bible when they quit their name is not there I got to show you one Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ having a form of godl denying the power thereof from such turn away for these sort are they which creep into houses and led captivity silly women lading with sins LED away with ders lost even learning and never be able to come to the knowledge of the truth you see now as Janes and jambos witho Moses so do this also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds rep concerning the truth you know that when you speak this message to the preachers denomination preachers Catholic uh Baptist Pentecost and all those things there they don't want to hear because they tuned their mind that they want to be force and God will give them Force why why did don't you know that God said he had in Pharaoh's heart so that he wouldn't let the the the children of God go these people they decided to stay there so their heart will be Harden cuz they know the truth they heard brother Abraham so many years all of them every Church on the face of Earth know the prophet of William maram Braham because he called all their leaders and they said we cannot turn back and tell them the lies that we have told them that's what they said if you want to check it out check it out if you are watching in Internet check it out William mam Braham when he met the socalled the world churches of council leaders in Chicago what did they say and the prophet told them it's better for you to go there and tell the truth than your males the your pocket Mals so we will come and baptize that same night all of them R run away through their hotel like cockroach because the light has has come the light has covered them so it's lighting them you know when when the coaches are in the house and you go there you put the light you know how fast they run if you don't take care some some of them will come through your mouth they run they don't like light the light of the word was shining through them Abraham told them if you think I am wrong pick up your Bible and come and stand beside me he hold the Bible like this come and Stood Beside Me If You are challenging me about the baptism of the Holy Ghost what God had pick up your Bible come and stand beside me you denomination all the head of the churches come and stand beside me like there is no ping if the pin drop and that in there little p you hear it quiet why God was there God back up his word you cannot challenge God God is God he does not share his word with no man he cannot give his glory to no man all the glory belongs to him so they Cho they chose to be false and what happened God had in their heart yes God will not force you to give you salvation he said I I cre you I give you free moral agency to to decide your decision is your destination Hallelujah glory to God our God is good God love us amen amen hallelujah let me read verse 11 see here verse 11 okay let me but they shall proceed to further and their fly shall be manifest unto men unto all men and they also and also what but thou Hast fully shown my Doctrine manner of life purpose Faith this is the believer T Paul but thou Hast fully known my Doctrine manner of life purpose Faith longsuffering charity patience persecution Affliction which came unto me at Antioch at Icon and Lisa what persecution I Endure but out of them all the Lord deliver me all the persecution you go through everything that you go through God what did he say he will deliver you because you are his children you stand for God God will stand for you Hallelujah never be afraid never never never be afraid the god that you serve he said I am in you before anything comes to you God is there he is there and draw a sword but your eye cannot see the sword is already drawn could you imagine when the the children of uh the this the syrians and they were planning their chamber talking how they going to wipe Israel like now how they saying they going to wipe isra all this there why they talking in their room the prophet reveal everything to the king so everything they talk in the chamber God talk to them so by the time they came here the children of Israel was standing there looking at them how this happen he thought a man them somebody's what is a spy among them h Hallelujah and one one lady said no they have a prophet that God speak to him that everything that you talk there he knows everything that's how God is there is nothing concern you that God does not know he knows everything about you see sometime when you you're sleeping and you roaring and roaring and paying here paying here you think God does not know one time I wake up my my stomach was hurting me so bad and then I said Satan you going to you going to you're going to inter interrupt my sleeping you have to go as soon as I said that I didn't mind the pain again I slept I never hear the pain no more you you can create the world for yourself you don't know what is in you we have to recognize who we are hallelujah amen amen let's read here the same Timothy 2 verse 4 10 see verse 4 to 10 and 10 for demons have forsaken me have loved this present well if you love the world the love of God do not you why why deas deos was Paul said deos have forsaken me he was working with the paor but he found out the world is good you can do whatever you want nobody pursue nobody question you we are all adults we can do anything by yourself but holy ghost will allow you to do the things that you want to do if you're a child of God demons forsake God for forsook uh H Paul he left he left him alone and went to the world because he was following Paul he was false he wasn't the right one and is departed onto thessalonica to Gia tyus and de dtia ho Luke is with me take Mark and bring them with thee for he is profitable to to me for the ministry see God knows who is profitable for his the ministry those who are not his they cannot come they cannot come they cannot stay so you sitting here nobody somebody might witness to you don't think the person brought you here it's the holy ghost that brought you here here we didn't come about me I was not coming no I came the took something from my my car I'm not going no more so far like that no way I'm not going and they took something away from my car too now I have churches here but let me tell you it reached a certain point of time when I put the even gospel music in my car driving tears started coming from my eye my eye started tears started coming from my eye you understand so if somebody bring you here and you think somebody bring you here you cannot get nothing if you think God brought you here God can work on you because that person God use him to witness to bring you to the presence of God that person cannot help you the man that's standing the poopet the pastor for you to yell yourself to him and believe in him you see the pastor you hear the testimony brother Danny brother Tim the life how they were going through hell and when they come is not the person that they brought them here they look the word that was coming through the ppet that were C them the anointed Pastor speak with anointed anointing out to do the work so if God give you the anointed Pastor let us hold that person hand and support hallelujah oh God loves us God loves us [Music] hallelujah our god is good I'm going to read brother brother Braham the message the anointed one at the end time Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ anointed one at the end time praise God listen and here paragraph 1965 paragraph 256 Notice come up to the borderline and quit Notice come up Notice come up to the borderline and quit look here he he said in Hebrews the chapter 6 the sixth chapter now we was reading a while ago I told you refer back to it and we will for the next couple minutes he said but THS and TS which is n unto rejection whose end is to be burned borderline brother borderline believer he's talking about brother line believer okay yeah who have tasted the Heavenly gift tasted other words you seen it you can't brother Braham smack his lips together I just just taste it with your mouth but you see it and you knew it was the truth you know it was the truth tasted the Heavenly gift and made partakers of the Holy Spirit as it fell upon you tasted of the good word of God tested you seen it was right and the Holy G fall upon you the weed in the field and then turn away dying denying the very Christ that sanctify you and call you and put that anointing upon you there remained No sacrifice for sin for that there remain not no said there remain No sacrifice for sin for that it is unpardonable it is impossible for them to ever come to the knowledge of the truth for it is impossible for those who have made partakers of the Holy Spirit fell upon fell upon the whe sea Started With Jesus and Lord I am going through but when you hit the word you turn back made partakers of the Holy Spirit and even tasted or seeing the word is manifested and then turn away from it it is totally impossible for them to ever see it or come to it that's that said the scripture now Heaven and Earth will pass away but it won't you see it totally impossible that Bible says so the spelled Bears record of it notice let me give you a little example look at those people who came out of out of under
