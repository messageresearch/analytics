[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] praise the lord friends
[0:16] praise the lord it's good to be here
[0:19] again
[0:20] on this marvelous wednesday
[0:24] night may the lord bless you
[0:28] real good we are here to
[0:32] study on the seven church ages
[0:36] and particularly concerning
[0:40] the ephesian church age
[0:44] tonight our subject
[0:47] will be the counterfeit church
[0:51] we will speak from matthew
[0:55] chapter 24 verses
[0:58] 5 and 24
[1:02] shall we read the word of god
[1:06] for many shall come in my name
[1:09] saying i am christ
[1:13] and shall deceive many
[1:16] verse 24 for there
[1:20] shall arise false christs
[1:23] and false prophets and
[1:27] shall show
[1:30] great signs and wonders
[1:34] and so much
[1:37] if it were possible
[1:40] they shall deceive the very
[1:44] elect dear god
[1:47] our gracious heavenly father
[1:51] may your great spirit anoint the word of
[1:56] god
[1:56] for tonight may you receive
[2:00] glory and honor as we declare the word
[2:04] of the lord
[2:06] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[2:10] draw near their great spirit
[2:14] in jesus name amen
[2:20] for they shall arise many
[2:24] false christs and
[2:27] false prophets and they
[2:31] shall shoot great signs and wonders
[2:35] and if it were possible
[2:39] they should deceive
[2:43] their very elected
[2:48] what then the answer is clear
[2:52] he is giving us a prophetic warning
[2:56] the lord jesus is warning his church
[3:01] and letting them know
[3:05] that there is a true
[3:09] church and a false
[3:12] church a true
[3:15] vine the false
[3:18] vine but of course the
[3:22] false church the
[3:25] vine that is the false body
[3:30] will always try to usurp
[3:33] or take the place or counterfeit
[3:37] copy the other
[3:41] they will contain and always present
[3:46] the argument
[3:49] that they are really
[3:53] the true church or that they
[3:56] are the elect of god
[4:01] now how are we to differentiate
[4:05] this for we know that the false will
[4:09] always try to kill to destroy
[4:13] the true church of the living god
[4:18] in the book of acts it is set forth
[4:21] clearly
[4:23] that during the seven church ages
[4:27] this time will be a a time
[4:30] that will be used as a bachelor
[4:34] background of how
[4:37] the false church will infiltrate
[4:42] and trying to destroy the true church
[4:46] who is trying to represent
[4:50] and to present jesus christ
[4:53] the same yesterday today and forever
[4:57] that the people may get to know
[5:00] him in the fullness
[5:04] of his life work
[5:07] now as we present this
[5:12] and this cannot be changed
[5:16] this working this invasion
[5:20] of the false into the true
[5:25] so that it might misrepresent
[5:29] christ in that true
[5:32] church so here we see
[5:36] a third principle
[5:39] the principle of the false vine
[5:43] and the true bonding it may be called
[5:46] the principle
[5:47] of the true church and the false church
[5:52] oh friends it is clear
[5:55] within the word of god that
[5:58] satan is a copycat
[6:01] that satan is a counterfeit
[6:04] one always the cutter feet
[6:07] right to the end in the book of
[6:10] revelation
[6:11] where he pro presents himself
[6:15] as a as christ when he is
[6:18] the false christ but he will always
[6:21] continue
[6:23] this avenue of trying to
[6:28] make counterproductive this
[6:31] word of the living god he
[6:34] will not allow it to go forth freely but
[6:37] he must
[6:38] intercept interject and try to do
[6:42] everything to be able to misrepresent
[6:45] the word of god by his usurpation
[6:50] now if we were to go back to the
[6:52] beginning
[6:54] go back to the book of genesis
[6:57] ages and times past
[7:00] and we are now in the book of genesis
[7:04] here we see isaac
[7:08] finding his wife and
[7:11] hair finding her we see
[7:15] clearly in the book of of genesis
[7:19] how that god provided him
[7:23] with a wonderful and beautiful wife
[7:29] and how god used him
[7:32] in a wonderful way now we see
[7:35] in the book of genesis in the garden of
[7:37] eden there were
[7:39] also two trees a precursor ah
[7:44] uh it was pointing to this that this was
[7:48] coming this was an evil since the
[7:51] beginning
[7:53] since the time when the mother eve
[7:57] gave a birth to these two boys
[8:02] cain and abel one of god
[8:05] one of the devil one a son of god
[8:09] one a son of the devil
[8:12] for it was not an apple that was just a
[8:15] beautiful
[8:16] way of them trying to cover it up hide
[8:19] it away
[8:20] in the very beginning of the bible to
[8:23] think that
[8:23] such a a horrible thing took place
[8:27] but it did it's in the word of god
[8:31] if you're to read your bible in the book
[8:34] of genesis you will find it's
[8:36] not an apple neither is
[8:40] it appear on a tree but certainly we see
[8:43] it
[8:44] as appear on the ground now certainly
[8:47] the word of god
[8:48] tells us in genesis 4 3-5
[8:51] if you will read it how it will tell us
[8:54] that
[8:55] and abel brought forth of the firstlings
[8:58] of his lock
[9:00] and the fact thereof and the lord had
[9:04] respect
[9:05] unto abel and to his offering
[9:08] but unto cain and his offering
[9:11] he had no respect but the one
[9:15] cain was evil being of
[9:18] his father of course his father being
[9:21] the wicked
[9:22] one while abel was
[9:25] righteous before the lord
[9:29] and again there were two children
[9:33] that came from the same parents
[9:37] but these twins were now going to come
[9:41] from
[9:42] isaac and rebecca
[9:46] one was the elect of god
[9:50] and the other was a reprobate
[9:54] both worship god but were godly
[9:58] what were people that would serve god
[10:01] that would even if there was a house of
[10:04] god then
[10:05] they would have been in the house of god
[10:07] worshiping god
[10:09] shouting glory to his mighty name but
[10:12] one
[10:12] was of god and the other
[10:15] was of the devil one was
[10:19] righteous and one was unrighteous
[10:24] in every case every situation
[10:28] the evil one hated the righteous one
[10:32] and also persecuted the righteous
[10:37] one and in some cases as you will see
[10:40] as you follow this trail of the serpent
[10:44] the the journey of the seed
[10:47] of the serpent through the scriptures
[10:51] you will find that it has tried
[10:55] many times throughout the years right on
[10:58] down
[10:59] until it came to the uh persecution
[11:02] of the church day the day making the
[11:05] church
[11:06] into a persecuted hiding
[11:09] having to have itself like a speckled
[11:12] bird at
[11:13] all times lines in danger for living the
[11:16] truth telling the truth manifesting the
[11:19] truth
[11:19] showing forth the truth of the life of
[11:22] god
[11:23] may manifest in her
[11:27] now know this four things
[11:30] that these two groups did together
[11:34] so that the onlookers
[11:37] those were looking or trying to find the
[11:40] true church
[11:41] would be either confused
[11:44] or deceived as which was
[11:48] real uh which was not
[11:51] real which was true and that which was
[11:55] false
[11:57] now notice carefully both were planted
[12:00] together
[12:04] both lived together
[12:09] both made claims upon god
[12:12] together and
[12:15] both worship god giving glory to his
[12:20] name together
[12:24] this parallels clearly
[12:27] the story of that jesus
[12:30] told of how a
[12:35] sword went forth to sow
[12:39] and how that he sold
[12:43] and by night his entity came and
[12:46] also sold seeds mingled and
[12:50] mixed within the
[12:54] original seeds that
[12:57] were planted by the original
[13:00] sewer so the source of the good seed
[13:06] and his enemy came and saw
[13:10] tears and the bible says it clearly
[13:15] an enemy had done this
[13:19] now we know god did not plant those
[13:22] tears
[13:24] satan was the one that planted
[13:27] those tears within
[13:30] the kingdom of god
[13:34] now these two kinds of seeds
[13:37] these two kinds of plants or may i say
[13:41] these two kinds of people
[13:44] were both in the same field
[13:48] but they grew up together
[13:53] their worship in the same church
[13:55] together
[13:57] giving praise and glory and hallelujah
[14:02] all to god doing it together
[14:05] but remember while doing this
[14:08] one was a god and the
[14:11] other was a reprobate a
[14:14] devil in the presence
[14:18] of almighty god
[14:21] now the bible tells us clearly both
[14:24] seeds being planted
[14:26] both seeds received their strengths
[14:31] from the original nourishment
[14:34] of the ground in which they were planted
[14:38] bought drew their strength from from god
[14:42] bought drew all of their vigor
[14:46] and them from the presence
[14:49] of almighty god
[14:52] they shared the same son
[14:56] s-o-n-s-u-s they
[14:59] shared in the same rain that came to
[15:03] refresh them the holy spirit formal
[15:05] former rain latter rain that came upon
[15:08] them
[15:09] they shared in the same sun and rain
[15:12] and all other benefits
[15:15] that god sent down to benefit
[15:19] his seed because the tears
[15:22] also had themselves
[15:26] in there they receive
[15:29] those benefits on themselves that they
[15:33] might grow
[15:34] and ripen at the same time
[15:37] as the original seed
[15:40] so when the time came to be harvested
[15:45] or vested they were harvested
[15:49] each in their turn
[15:52] there were drawn out
[15:56] of their original position
[15:59] do you see what i'm saying simply
[16:02] can you receive this truth it's very
[16:05] important that we remember
[16:07] it as we study these seven church ages
[16:11] for time and time again through the ages
[16:15] we will see the manifestation of
[16:18] these two spirits one of god one of the
[16:21] devil
[16:22] one true one false coming
[16:25] out of the word of god
[16:29] and the manifestation of these two
[16:32] ancient uh enemies
[16:36] god against satan
[16:40] manifested in the people of that
[16:43] particular
[16:45] day the manifestation takes place
[16:48] where every eye could see in every ear
[16:52] could hear above all
[16:55] don't forget it especially in the last
[16:58] age the ledecian age for remember
[17:02] that is when both of these seeds
[17:06] come to their ripening of the
[17:09] fullness of their harvest that is the
[17:13] time
[17:14] when we will see them in the fullness
[17:18] of their good the fullness of their evil
[17:22] the fullness of their manifestation
[17:25] all in the light of
[17:28] that day for then we see
[17:32] the seed of god being called to a
[17:35] rapture
[17:36] to be taken out of the air by god's
[17:38] grace
[17:39] while the false seed that was
[17:42] intertwined
[17:44] within the church of god are
[17:47] bound together called together
[17:50] in a union one called to a union
[17:53] for a rapturing grace a rapture the
[17:56] other
[17:57] called to a union being prepared
[18:00] and bound for its burning at that time
[18:04] [Music]
[18:05] and they will try to shoot the the wheat
[18:09] out
[18:10] they'll try to push out the true seed of
[18:13] god
[18:14] and that is to be garnered
[18:17] into the presence of god now
[18:20] i want to carry this truth a little
[18:22] further on
[18:24] as we look into god's marvelous
[18:28] wonderful words that warns
[18:32] us and lets the
[18:35] saints of god be armed and be ready
[18:40] for this evil is an evil
[18:43] not only to come but is already
[18:46] here that is working among us
[18:50] and we must discern this evil
[18:54] that we might withstand it in the name
[18:57] of the lord now if you ever studied the
[19:01] history
[19:02] of revivals
[19:05] you will see that a revival is a
[19:10] significant moving of god's holy spirit
[19:14] moving upon his people in a mighty way
[19:19] and it never fails that whenever
[19:22] god moves for a revival on his people
[19:27] satan comes and is at the same time he
[19:30] begins to move
[19:31] also trying to confuse the
[19:34] issue of the movement of god
[19:37] now during the great welsh revivals that
[19:41] took place
[19:42] in the whales we find out that
[19:45] as god's spirit moved and souls were
[19:48] saved
[19:49] at the same time the devil's spirit was
[19:53] moving
[19:54] and the asylums insane institutions
[19:58] became so filled with
[20:02] people that were out of their mind
[20:06] because it satan's attempt
[20:09] of a great display of his demonic
[20:13] power upon the first upon the face of
[20:17] the earth
[20:18] the being made to
[20:21] take away attention from the great
[20:25] work that god was doing
[20:28] in the life of people and to
[20:32] mock the goodness and the mercy of god
[20:35] that was being shed abroad in the
[20:39] hearts of many that were willing
[20:42] and ready to surrender themselves
[20:45] into the very hand of god
[20:49] in luther's day it says the miracle
[20:54] of luther was not
[20:57] to see miracles but the miracle was that
[21:01] he was
[21:02] able to keep his sanity and his
[21:05] balance his way of worship
[21:09] in the middle of the sea
[21:12] of blasphemy and evil
[21:16] insanity that took place
[21:19] around him and so
[21:23] we are here
[21:26] now recognizing
[21:29] the why satan used the tools
[21:33] of religious fanatics intertwined
[21:36] into the church of god using these
[21:40] fanatics people
[21:45] that would be uh apparently
[21:48] on the outside of the piers as if they
[21:50] are sane
[21:52] but they are in sane
[21:55] they are fanatic to the genuine
[22:00] word of god
[22:03] and often they are filled anointed
[22:07] motivated by the wrong
[22:10] spirit wicked evil
[22:15] seductive moving
[22:19] on the hearts and minds of these
[22:23] religious ones i hope you're spiritual
[22:27] minded
[22:28] and that you're able to understand and
[22:30] get what i'm talking about
[22:33] because it's in progress right now
[22:36] very much so within the church
[22:40] of the living god now
[22:43] the true and false vines are mingling
[22:47] just as they mingle at the time of
[22:50] planting
[22:52] in they field of god
[22:56] the tears and the wheat the true
[23:00] and the false were mingling
[23:03] there together and they were
[23:06] both at work
[23:09] in our bible john chapter
[23:12] first john chapter 4 verses 4
[23:16] 1 to 4 and jude chapter 3
[23:20] verses 4 to 12 we will find that
[23:24] there also now we read beloved
[23:28] believe not every spirit but try the
[23:32] spirits
[23:34] whether they are of god because
[23:37] many false prophets are gone
[23:40] out into the world hereby know
[23:44] he that the spirit of god
[23:48] and every spirit that confesseth
[23:51] that jesus christ is coming the flesh
[23:55] is of god and every spirit that
[23:58] confesseth knowledge
[24:00] that jesus christ has come not
[24:03] in the flesh is not of god
[24:06] and this is the spirit of
[24:09] antichrist whereof you have heard that
[24:13] it
[24:13] would come even now already
[24:16] is in the world you are of
[24:20] god little children and who have
[24:23] overcome them
[24:24] antichrist spirit because greater is he
[24:28] that is in you god's holy spirit in you
[24:31] is greater than any devil that's working
[24:35] on the outside of you greater is he
[24:38] that is in you than he that is in the
[24:42] world
[24:43] jude chapter 3 verses 4
[24:47] to 12. beloved
[24:50] when i gave you all diligence to write
[24:53] unto you
[24:54] of our common salvation
[24:57] it was needful for me to write unto you
[25:00] and to exhort you that you should
[25:03] earnestly
[25:04] contend for the faith
[25:08] that was once delivered unto
[25:11] the saints for there
[25:14] are certain men
[25:19] bear that in mind now there
[25:22] are certain men of course
[25:26] and women that have crept in
[25:30] unawares certain saints
[25:33] certain people that claim to be
[25:35] believers
[25:37] mixed in mingled amongst the true
[25:41] ones mingled in with the flock of god
[25:45] that is a manual listen
[25:49] those who were of old ordained to
[25:53] condemnation
[25:54] think of it ordained to condemnation
[25:59] ungodly men turning the
[26:02] grace of our god into lascuviousness
[26:06] and the saviour's and denying the only
[26:09] lord god
[26:10] our lord jesus christ these
[26:13] are spots in your feasts of
[26:16] charity when they feast with you
[26:21] feeding themselves without
[26:24] fear it cannot be denied friends
[26:28] that in the scriptures the true church
[26:32] and the false church are always
[26:35] intertwined
[26:36] having been planted together but
[26:40] both being of different seeds
[26:43] planted at the same time
[26:48] now of course this is being addressed
[26:52] or spoken for the benefit of the seven
[26:55] churches which
[26:59] we see they planted
[27:04] in asia minor
[27:07] and what i say this would be like a
[27:10] nursery
[27:11] uh like a nursery from which the entire
[27:15] gentile church will then
[27:18] issue fourth so the planting time the
[27:22] intertwining time
[27:23] the beginning time he is already
[27:27] warning the true church of god you are
[27:30] going to
[27:30] find your enemy not on the outside that
[27:34] much they will be there
[27:35] but you're going to find your real enemy
[27:38] on the
[27:39] inside of the church right beside you
[27:43] knee to knee shoulder to shoulder you
[27:46] are going to find your enemy right
[27:48] there beside you now these seven
[27:51] churches were
[27:52] of course it was addressed to john there
[27:57] and uh god didn't speak to the church at
[28:00] jerusalem
[28:02] because the church in jerusalem was
[28:04] mainly jewish
[28:06] but speaking to these seven churches
[28:11] that god was showing that he had turned
[28:14] his attention from the
[28:18] jews to the gentiles
[28:21] and so the whole of the
[28:25] church ages
[28:28] he would be dealing with the gentiles
[28:32] on the calling out of the gentiles
[28:35] unto himself taking out of the gentiles
[28:39] our people for his
[28:42] name a people for
[28:46] his name so that
[28:49] brings the church out
[28:54] and brings it to growing
[28:57] from that hour to this time
[29:00] which he calls the fullness of the
[29:03] gentiles
[29:05] that time the times of the gentiles
[29:09] until this time of the ripening of the
[29:12] harvesting
[29:13] or what is called the fullness
[29:16] of the gentiles
[29:20] now acts chapter 13 verses 44 to 48
[29:23] and the word of god
[29:27] when the jews saw the multitudes that
[29:29] they were filled with
[29:31] envy and spake against those things
[29:34] which were spoken by paul
[29:37] and contradicting him and blaspheming
[29:41] against the word of god
[29:44] then fallen barnabas wax bald and said
[29:48] it was necessary that the word of god
[29:52] should first have been spoken to you
[29:55] the jews but seeing you have put it from
[29:59] you
[30:00] and judge yourselves unworthy of
[30:03] everlasting life
[30:06] lo return to the gentiles
[30:10] for so hat the lord commanded
[30:14] us saying i upset thee to be a light
[30:18] of the gentiles that thou should speak
[30:21] for salvation
[30:23] unto the ends of the earth and when the
[30:26] gentiles heard this
[30:28] they were glad and glorified
[30:32] the word of the lord and as many as were
[30:36] ordained to eternal life
[30:39] believe god's word romans chapter 11
[30:43] verses 1 to 8 i say then had god cast
[30:47] away his people
[30:49] god forbid for i also am
[30:52] an israelite of the seed of abraham of
[30:55] the tribe of
[30:57] a benjamin god had not cast a ways
[31:00] people
[31:01] which he foreign what ye not the
[31:04] scripture
[31:05] saith alliance how he maketh
[31:07] intercession
[31:08] against israel saying the lord
[31:12] that they have killed thy prophets dig
[31:14] down thine altars
[31:16] i am left alone and they seek my life
[31:20] but what said the answer of god unto him
[31:24] i have reserved unto myself
[31:27] seven thousand who have not bowed their
[31:30] knees amen to the image of baal
[31:34] even so then at this present time
[31:37] there also is a remnant according
[31:41] to the election of grace
[31:44] and if by grace then
[31:47] is no more of works otherwise
[31:51] grace is no more grace
[31:55] but if it be of works then it is of no
[31:58] more grace
[32:00] otherwise work is no more work
[32:04] what then israel not obtained that which
[32:07] he seeketh not
[32:09] but the election had obtained it and the
[32:12] rest were blinded
[32:14] as it is written god had given them the
[32:17] spirit of slumber
[32:19] eyes that should not see an ears that
[32:22] would not hear
[32:24] unto this very day and in romans chapter
[32:28] 11 verses 25 to 29 paul speaks
[32:31] for i would not brethren that
[32:34] you be ignorant of this mystery
[32:38] how lest you would be wise in your
[32:42] own conceits the blindness
[32:46] in part is happen to israel
[32:51] until the fullness of the times of the
[32:55] gentiles
[32:56] be come in and so all israel shall be
[33:00] saved
[33:01] as it is written they shall come out of
[33:04] zion the deliverer
[33:06] and shall turn away ungodliness from
[33:10] jacob
[33:11] for this is my covenant unto them
[33:14] then when i shall take away their sins
[33:18] as according the gospel they are enemies
[33:21] to your sakes
[33:22] but as touching the election they are
[33:25] beloved for the father's sake
[33:28] for the gifts and callings of god are
[33:31] without repentance now we know
[33:35] that these seven churches located
[33:38] in asia minor ordained
[33:42] this contained the certain
[33:45] characteristics
[33:46] these seven churches mentioned
[33:50] in asia minor contain
[33:53] certain basic characteristics
[33:56] that will be figured or will be able to
[34:00] see
[34:01] them manifesting themselves
[34:04] within these seven ages
[34:07] that are to come so we see
[34:11] then that
[34:14] these characteristics being in the
[34:17] churches the gentile churches these
[34:20] seven
[34:20] church ages that were to come
[34:24] they will mature both in
[34:27] their good their righteousness
[34:31] and also in their evil
[34:34] of the working of that evil one
[34:38] satan in their very miss
[34:41] so we see these two seeds will
[34:45] come to their maturity they will come to
[34:48] their maturity
[34:49] in the time of the end which and we are
[34:53] in that time of their vision now
[34:56] and how that in that time of harvesting
[35:00] that the seed plants will come
[35:04] to its fullness and to a mature
[35:07] harvest for as jesus said if these
[35:10] things be
[35:11] done in a green tree what shall be done
[35:14] within the dry so here we are friends
[35:19] we have looked at four principles
[35:23] by which we should see god one
[35:26] god is unchanging
[35:31] two we should see the true
[35:34] church stays with the original
[35:39] pattern or blueprint it stays with that
[35:43] that will be how you will recognize and
[35:46] identify
[35:47] the true church we must
[35:50] also recognize
[35:53] all that says it's christian or church
[35:56] is not
[35:57] christian and it's not church we should
[36:00] have this understanding
[36:03] through this prophetic warning that
[36:06] there is a true church in the church
[36:10] and a false church so we
[36:14] must discern the lord's body
[36:17] in his day and in his time
[36:22] lastly recognize this principle
[36:26] that the jed the true church
[36:30] mainly concerns gentiles
[36:34] gentiles is what concerns the true
[36:37] church
[36:38] not that there won't be any jews in it
[36:41] but
[36:41] not any jews in mass will only be
[36:44] jews in individually but in mass
[36:48] it will be gentile the
[36:51] church will be gentile let me repeat
[36:55] again friends
[36:56] we can't uh help to uh look at this
[37:00] carefully
[37:00] as i close out with these four
[37:02] principles one
[37:03] the true church stays with the original
[37:06] pattern
[37:08] two god is unchanging
[37:11] three recognize the true and the false
[37:15] mind
[37:16] and four the church mainly
[37:19] concerns the gentiles it's important
[37:22] that we understand this as we go forward
[37:25] into the church age the ephesian church
[37:28] age
[37:29] for if the messenger had to have a
[37:32] prophecy
[37:33] to enlighten him to understand it this
[37:36] way with this kind of foundation
[37:38] i believe we need the very same
[37:41] foundations
[37:42] also may god bless you real god
[37:45] may the foundation of god as the bible
[37:48] says stand it
[37:50] sure for the lord knoweth them
[37:53] that are his may god
[37:56] show you that he knows them
[37:59] that are his and claim you for
[38:03] himself the lord bless you real good and
[38:06] the
[38:06] lord plant firmly the truth of his word
[38:10] within the the very
[38:13] foundations of your heart may never
[38:17] leave you but
[38:18] keep you and draw you closer
[38:21] to him god bless you
[38:42] [Music]
[45:17] you
