"Abundant Living And Giving Part 1" Pastor John Simon March 13th, 2016
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you know and and people are getting excited about gold I believe the Gold's gonna go up Way Beyond what it was not long ago here at 18 or 1900 because we're going up okay and we're going to be walking on streets over here it's going to become the most valuable most precious thing on Earth because people are putting their trust in the dollar right in gold in value there's no richer Rich than the richness that you've received through the word of God amen amen this world is not my life foreign let us come tomorrow songs yeah this one friends come up welcome Pastor sir you are being blessed I'm embracing and giving glory to God Amen Lord richly bless you for being here today and may he take his word and bless us amen praise the Lord shall we uh turn to the word let's read from Mark chapter 12 verses 41-44 house of the Lord and let's pray for the safety of those who are of their March 3. Mark 4 1 to 44. it's a story about a widow of sorry 12. what am I looking at Mark 12. I just took a glance now I saw it forward and Jesus said over against the treasury and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury Discerning their bodies and many that were Rich cast in much and there came a surgeon for Will and she Drew in two nights and he she called unto him his disciples and sell them to them look look look rarely I say unto you that this poor Widow had cast more in them all Faith which cast in to the treasure right for all David casting of their abundance but she of our want did cast in all that she had even all her living father will be come once again for this teachable moment asking the blessing of the Holy Spirit and that he the great teacher will take the word and apply it to our hearts that we may grow nearby in Jesus name amen Lord bless you please be safe some of you may not know it but on a Wednesday night I started on a series this church ship of life the stewardship of life talking about life and living and how we are to manage our own lives by the grace of God however it seems like a lot of people let the Christians they love to get into a lot of tea things they like to get into the mysteries of God and the deeper Revelations of God which is wonderful and we ought to know future things which theologians calls eschatology prophecy we need to get into all those things uh and to know that but at the same time we don't want to become scientists that have arise on the stars and can't discern the grass at our feet amen because it makes no sense you heading to the moon and you haven't even unraveled the mystery right around and a really mysterious things are the simplest things amen right um you can buy almost anything and you want in this world but you can't buy a bottle of peace peace of mind you can't buy joy in the bottle but it's it's there but it's so simple that we pass right over the top of it yeah yeah in second Corinthians 8 and 9. we're looking at the subject of stewardship and like I said before I spoke on on Wednesday night on the topic of the stewardship of life and we stress the point that God is the owner of everything amen do you believe that God owns everything we love the little song He Got the Whole World in His Hand He's Got The Whole World the world is the Lord's and the Earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof everything is that the captain of thousand hills are mine everything is mine even we us we belong to him we belong to him and we are in his hands so today I want to talk about giving and I want to talk about Abundant Living and giving everybody last the other uh three weeks ago I believe I took twenty dollars out of my wallet and I held up and I said who wants this everybody I freshened it up with my feet to get him dirty I said who still wants this dirty Bill everybody's still one in there doesn't matter what I did for that 20 dollar bill everybody wanted it I went to South Carolina preaching there I did the same thing everybody wanted a matter of fact one man ran right up to the front and was right there and if I took my foot off that turned it up and it was going to be gone but the fact is everybody wants money amen is there anybody here that doesn't want everyone doesn't want money I see no hands raised so that everybody wants money and not because we wash up honey but because to live in the present World System you need money to live you need money in which to live because of the system in which we are living and to be honest well you know me I have been reluctant through the years to teach or preach about money and about giving and one of the reasons why is because I look up there and see on the television screens and I've been into Mass meetings and in various churches where all the all they've talked about most of the time and money and uh people are pressured to give money and a lot of people have been hurt in giving money I think I got the Raiders now because you're so quiet now these are really listening that's good burn burn the churches and ministers in the giving of money but I want to thank my God that I have an example of my own mother and father who uh preach the gospel without belonging to any specific denomination they were just Christians by reading the Bible they were they didn't belong to any church it's afterwards that the Assemblies of God heard me as a young boy in the street maybe 14 years old and gave me a scholarship but other than that they didn't know anything they just read their Bible priest um what God put in their hearts and as a result um people were saying born again and join the various churches matter of fact a few years ago I went back to South America into Diana where I'm from I'm walking through a hotel lobby I'm here in the oldest animals that I know you I said how could you love me you're not in the same generation I haven't been there for 22 years now he said oh I know you're you're I know your family I said no he says yes he says who's your father I told him he said oh he says I know him I know him and your grandfather I'm one of his Converse and here he was the minister in charge of the museum and all this kind of stuff so anyway the fact is that people get born again and they get old they get sick when everybody else and people would be giving them ready to give them their property let me say no we're not doing it for that we'd be here just to preach the gospel bring on their first get in um I see I see that over and over where they turned down for Jews and then even bother with it one man lying in the street that was sick covered with sores they call them Lazarus because it was so comfortable source they took him they paid them using words natural herbs because back to them you know there's a hospital that the people in the know of natural things never even bother the gospel matter of fact they used to call my aunt to the hospital to help them out because she knew so much but anyway it took them took him and the bathroom and give him herbs and stuff like that and help them the man recovered his health and went to school and it was brilliant and in the several years he became an encounter he became a chief of counter he became the head over the bauxite company and was a powerful person in the country and he wanted to somehow repay them in various ways and it absolutely refused he couldn't do anything that they would accept so when I um was expected to a high school college actually what he did he heard about it and he went ahead and just paid for everything so when they turned up to go paying the fees and paying for the books and paying it was already paid for so that's how he got back at them because for years he's trying to get to do something and one thing what I'm trying to tell you so that's the reason one of the reluctance I I've had through the years of actually teaching and preaching on giving a praise on you prospering and God bless in you but to actually preach on giving I kept away from it because I've seen too much out there in the so-called Church world amen where people have been deceived in every possible way and they taught every possible way but I want to teach them what the bible really says about giving not what I see or anybody else says but what the Bible actually says about giving and by doing that I want you to get rid of all your thoughts ideas you don't need miracle wallets from some preacher giving you a miracle wallet and telling you if you send for this wallet send twenty dollars you get the wallet and after you get this wallet you know the wallet will always be full of good money but the bad fact is way back then that had to be false because of my argument was to turn around and say well if you can have a miracle wallet that's always going to have money in it every time I spend and I go back to the wallet there's money in the wallet why have you giving me the wallet in the wallet for your money for your ministry so far so why give me the water keep your Miracle wallet keep your Miracle belt keep your Miracle Water right put your coffee from the Catholics anyway keep all of that and just give me Jesus amen praise the name of the Lord so I want you to get rid of all these false ideas false things that they're placed in your mind if they want to sell you something tell you plain I'm selling you this book or I'm doing that don't say send for my free book and when you were sending send twenty dollars as an offering it's a trick right so open your eyes don't don't be foolish um you know like to just be wise as a serpent but harmless like a dove right a lot of Christians believe that it's not good to uh you know be thoughtful and be quick but you know we need to be spiritual but we also need to be practical well if you're not in heaven you have to be right there on this Earth and you need to have to deal with practical situations and you need to deal with the devil and sheep's clothing and sometimes they come right in the church yes is that right I said sometimes they're in the church and sometimes the worst ones are religion amen because the fact is when they covered up with religion you tend to want to trust them and that's their when they want to take you for a ride when you wake up amen and the reason why I can talk like this because I'm not depending on you for my salary amen ities I am not dependent on you for my salary I'm not dependent on you to pay me anything God is the source of my Supply uh one time I was working that's when I was doing building houses and um you know while I was there you know it's thank goodness I I have the I'm a contractor subcontractor this contract above me and uh oh he was talking kind of rough you know we had a bad time until you stop okay and then I said oh my you know I don't know what I'm gonna do with this boss I had no no and uh I don't know what and then I heard the Lord speaking quietly you know I don't mean I hear the liberal voice but inside boy speaking and saying your boss who is your boss is he your boss if he is your boss then you took the dependent on him but I am the boss over all the bosses so who are you going to trust him or me right and get you right off the bus and get you right on with me and that's when I learned to look to God so him lift the God says okay I'll pull back the contracts you don't have none he says that but what does God say about it if God say about it he can see whatever he wants but it's not what he says or he says What God Says so we ought to put our faith in God and in God's word heaven on Earth will pass away but my word will never pass away praise the Lord hallelujah so when I'm finishing up you will not be able to reevaluate yourself with all the requests you get from off the TV in the mail on other lines you will be able to more evaluate and have some more spiritual strength Hallelujah and not that these people could fear on you that if you don't give to the ministry you're going to go bankrupt all these lines and all these things they try to put on you and I want to get them off for you cast them out of Spirits or Devils is really the casting out of unbelief beliefs you know cast of unbelief and you cast out the devil amen praise the Lord but the essence of the fact is that the centrality of Christianity is giving because the Bible itself as you know in John 3 16 God so loved the world that he gave God so loved the world that he gave and God wants us to give so that we be like him amen so he wants us to learn to be givers and I'm not talking about learning Justice Just a Little Bit sometimes give your offerings but to have a life of giving where outside you're giving you're helping the poor you're helping your neighbor you're you're good you're giving up your time you're always a giver because that is the nature of God Amen amen that is the nature of God the word give is used over 1500 times of the Bible and Christianity is based on God giving his life for us hallelujah amen and we know friends that when we look at the Bible I want you to see her even in the text we use that God Jesus looking at the woman at the treasury was more interested in the motive of the giver than the money of The Giver that's right let me repeat that the Lord was born and arrested in the motive of The Giver that in the body or the amount of money or The Giver because if the amount of money you give is in the wrong attitude that's worthless amen we're bless the God and somebody coming with the right walk is an attitude then literally give God is ever like the Franklin of bread to multiplying to feed multitudes amen so it's the right flow live on the right action in giving that is the blessing that we received amen so why do we give this important it's just not how much we give but why we give and the quality of the heart of The Giver is more than the quantity amen amen so don't give just forgiving but gift from the heart and give a revelation and God will bless you amen giving is a responsibility that's right it's a command in the Bible and also responsibility for us as Christians it is also an opportunity for you to be able to give to God's plan God's program in God's kingdom praise the Lord and that's the reason I want to share with you three reasons why we as Christians ought to give Hallelujah and friends this subject is stewardship is very important giving it's a response to God for eign fast we are grateful for past blessings all the blessings we have received secondly it's a response for what God is doing for us give us and through us at the present time and we give him thanks and praise for them and it's also a response into what God will do for us in the future hallelujah praise the Lord let me give you a little secret if you go I'm afraid of God for something and you ask him for it say Lord I ask you to heal my mother or heal my father or or God provide me with a new car you know what's the best thing you can do for sure not to believe it start thanking him in anticipation of the reception of that thing amen that is fake faith is praising God Amen before you actually have the stuff in your hand because you believe it you start thanking him before your body amen you see it's not simple brothers and sisters thank God praise the Lord hallelujah if you heard that you um had a what the lottery and the money was going to be delivered to your house in the British truck you don't have nobody else yet but it's on the way yes so you're not going to wait for it to get to your house and then you will start rejoicing you have already started to Rejoice before and even arise as surely as your faith pulls down the blessing of God said God's Prophet your unbelief sends it back where it comes from yeah but if you love texting translation if you can keep believing you can have whatever you say yeah it'll appear it will manifest it will become visible for the things that are seen are made from the things that are not seen everything that is created here is by God's spoken word amen the invisible became visible by the spoken word of God hallelujah now so you say friend assignment why do we give second Corinthians 8 9 of course are classic passengers praise the Lord every man according to his purpose in his life so let him give not the presently our necessity for God love it a cheerful Giver hallelujah amen praise God so one the first thing it does the first reason it allows us to express our appreciation for past blessing yes hallelujah praise God that is why sometimes people wanted to know why I'm happy to pay my bills some people are not happy to pay bills when they see they're built they get done what I expect I have to explain I said look I'm paying my bills because I'm happy for the past blessings that I received I receive services and I'm thankful for those Services I know I'm paying for the services praise God so I'm happy to receive that because I already been blessed by them company blessed me oh you don't think so but yeah but yes that's why I have lights in my home they bless me praise God the Walker so I turn it around the opposite way so that when it comes I don't feel bad I feel wonderful that God is able to provide for me in such a way that I'm able to pay my bills okay amen so I rejoice when they come here praise the Lord hallelujah so you are not together or in that way the blood of course in his word tells us her second Corinthians 9 7 that we ought to give not reluctantly or under any convention right don't give father con function or grudgingly because if you give that way you're giving is worthless you see God is trying to get us in the right moment forgiveness Hallelujah matter of fact that is the reason why it's at first brother Branham never would receive an offering throughout his entire Ministry he will not take up an offering and refuse to do it but then one night when the Lord appeared to him and said no it's my command in the word that the people give your tithes and get their offerings and you true Sympathy for the people or you uh thinking that you're doing good telling them not to give but that is contrary to my word they ought to give so the life of his lesson they open the door to Blessing by their giving and taught them otherwise and from then on he um he started to take up an offering so our greatest reason for giving to God is out of gratitude amen I know I'm grateful to God for what he's done through my life the blessings are complex I can't wake up them all what he's done for gun free and the things is different broadly true situations that we brought me out of that nobody could explain and tell me that this human uh wisdom brought me out I know he brought me out of my request my God he brought me out of the sickness the pain the trouble I know he brought me out of the tracks that never set for me everything that surrounded me God knocked me out amen hallelujah and I know that I can say just like that friends that in according to God's word that God Supply the needs of God's people is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God hallelujah gratitude for past blessings say together with me the words that you want to see up here on the screen listen not your boss that your job your business is only a pipeline that God uses to bring his blessings to you let me let me just make it very simple it's like you can have a whole ocean of fresh water here in front of you and you need fresh water right but the fact is if you don't have a pipeline to it the water will be right there and you won't be able to get it is that right so God's what is the natural economy a business gives you a quick Lane to that economy a job gives you a pipeline to that economy and so on and so on you follow what I'm trying but if you have no connection to it how are you going to draw from it well that's when the same thing God is telling you here in his work by giving you awkward up the way for him to now be able to send down His blessings to you and then he uses a pipeline of a business a job something that you're doing he opens up the way and brings the blessings into your lives somebody say amen amen praise the Lord is that the truth praise God nothing from nothing some open up the way and let God have his way in your life this is not something that glorious thing when you go into the church world and see the way they treat the people giving me thumbs up uh our laborious thing yes it becomes a thing where oh not again oh here they go again and that's how a wife will begin to understand brother sister but for the water to come do you know what the first thing they have to do they have to use the section A Hole where they poured a little water in first and then there we got the pump and that is called priming the pop is that right yes sir well that's actually what God is telling you by giving it's not that he needs your family but he needs you to prime your tongue he wants you to see your heart amen if you're attached to things or you are really sick first the kingdom of heaven and his righteousness and all other things will be asked on to you he's constantly testing us to see if we're attached to things or we are actually not our eyes on him and that is the reason why every week every day he's testing Us in that particular area but never got your eyes off of this God no matter what goes on around you it's not this boss is not this High Corporation it's not that one they came and did that because God thank you hallelujah praise the Lord Oh Glory to God let's see the next uh scripture there praise God hallelujah amen and God is able to make all grace of God covered you that you always having all sufficiency in all things they are bound to every good work praise God hallelujah wants to bless you so that you have enough to to do all the good works in the heart to do listen you can't do it on good intention hallelujah oh if I have this money I will be able to write Bibles for the mission field it's a good intention but it doesn't help the church it doesn't have God or his kingdom so if I had it I would help that sick person across the street or that many mother or widow or grandmother that's left alone in our house I would help her if I had some extra well God is saying you give to me how much like give me that little loaf of bread give me that stick give me whatever you are I almost implied and in the words of David my comfort is full and rub it off of you are an excess that I can freely get what I'm feeling it abundance giving brings up God of living Hallelujah so that's the way it works according to God praise God hallelujah amen the Bible tells us that the Lord himself came down and he who was in the heavens that falls heavily he for our sex be careful it's in your Bible your pronouncing the word So Soft like you're scared to pronounce it is that right now he became for that we may become rich it is your right to be rich because that's the word he became poor the Bible says the fox says and the birds have a mess but the son of man he had nowhere to lay his sweet hand Hallelujah the Lord will provide Jehovah Hallelujah the Lord will provide he had nowhere no nowhere to lay his and he became poor that you may become rich in your hand that scripture alone you can keep that in your head all week he became quarter that might become rich rich praise God Rich Lord of God hallelujah wonderful it's not where you are now you might not be able to imagine it but God said yes which doesn't mean that you got just doesn't have to do with only money but you can be rich in hell is that right yes sir you can be rich with wealth you can be rich in joy you could be rich with peace beloved I wish above all things that you prosper in every aspect of your life prosper and be in hell even as your soul brother mental health physical health spiritual health so that you have in every way God wants you to prosper everywhere thank you we give because God gave the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah my wife's birthday is in September it's coming up and I can guarantee you that I will go out and will buy her a gift why am I going to buy her this gift uh people say something I love her there's millions of women in the world Amen praise the Lord and because I'm thankful that God gave her to me it's no matter what you think about here is what I think about her and now you know I am the beholder praise the Lord praise the Lord and in my eyes is beautiful I said in my eyes she's beautiful and I cannot do you because I love her in September I'm wonderful and I'm going to give her sometimes the gift and I'm going to feel very happy in Daredevil to give it to her because giving is a practical way in expressing your love and your appreciation oh my God Lord I love you amen Hallelujah heavenly father I appreciate you shall you sing it heavenly father I am appreciated you I love you I love you I'm your food I bow down before you Heavenly Father I am Christian Corinthians 8 8 Paul says I'm not commanding you but I want to test the sincerity of Your Love hallelujah praise the Lord since he giving to God throughs our love for God no matter what we say it doesn't matter is what we do amen with their lips but many their hearts are far from God and then God can't bless them now the second reason why we're giving to God is because giving allows us to examine our present motives amen that's second reason we're given to God it allows us to examine our present motives for really giving so we examine ourselves why we are actually giving praise God hallelujah because you see many Christians have the attitude of because human race not just Christians have this not into the selfishness as I usually say it uh it's like the the people of God my trouble everybody got eye trouble I I I'm this is everything to do with life see me and mine and everything else you know and and the moment you off you you try to say something that they talk even if they don't say who their mouth is watching it for me right it's all about me it's all about me and I'm trying to get you if your name is to be me but uh um it's all about me and that's what the people are thinking all the time you remember the man in the Bible that Jesus spoke to and he says my Barns and my farm and and my cattle and this everything is mine mine mine not realizing that God give you all of it what are you talking about just buying this and mind that praise the Lord so from time to time we need in other words checking of our emotions all right the Bible says that the man or a woman examine yourself to see whether you are in the Revelation in other words you're living under the inspiration of Revelation rather than by reason under your own emotion amen we've got to live by the word praise God hallelujah amen we've got to get to the point are we considering it brother sister that we must remember that God is the source of the supply yes and that we are only managers of what yes it's in our eyes but it's time when his talent whether it's our family whether it's our Fortune what every blessings in your hand we are only managers that is why we use the word sure because the steward manages a house or manages a property something that doesn't belong to him and we are given a 99 and he says give me back ten right a group of man is the 99 and then I will bless you praise the Lord amen so the second reason why God wants us to give is that we avoid the virus the same or the curse of selfishness because it runs robots right now even in the political Realm it helps us to keep that way our priorities and balance we have enough keep our lives in other words in balance uh look at Deuteronomy 14 22 to 23. Deuteronomy Hallelujah thou shall truly tie all of the increase of thy sin amen let the feet that the field amen shall bring forth year by year and those shall eat before the Lord thy God in the place which he shall choose the bless his name place the tide of the Corn and of the wine amen I wrote the first things out of the hearts of the thought that though must learn to fear the lord always Hallelujah in other words a simple comes what he's saying in a lot of words that when you pay your tithes it makes you always conscious that all I have come from him and as much as it comes from him the Lord gives and that simple the Lord can think of me amen therefore I have to live with spiritual fear or respect before God with what I do with my living and with my hearing amen because I'm always conscious that he's watching and he knows every path that I take praise the Lord you got to seek first the kingdom of heaven and it's righteousness and all other things will be given unto you now I got to refer back to myself my dear precious wife there when Desiree and I got married no matter what happened and I will tell you what happened because we we went through all kinds of experiences uh like that but people say no matter what happened we are going to bring all these types first they don't make any difference because you know some people got it backwards they think um but I don't have any money why should I type to God but that's the reason why you should because you're the one that needs even the blessing even more
