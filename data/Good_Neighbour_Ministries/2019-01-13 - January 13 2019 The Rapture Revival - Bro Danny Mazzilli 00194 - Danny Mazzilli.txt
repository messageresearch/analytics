TRANSCRIPT
========================================
watching and waiting in that I believe that we can leave today the glories of God God bless you states certainly continue to prepare a costume that he has a wonderful vacation after 50 years of marriage you know you know I'm 33 years now of marriage and vacations are always good you know it gets that rekindles it gets me fired up and and rested about here reflect what the Lord is doing because as sons and daughters of God interested in our lives so long read from the book of Ephesians today we're going to be looking at of course the first light title today is the rapture the Bible and then the phrase God we know that the Lord he always does things in different times and different seasons and a different dispensation but we have to recognize what a sensation were actually in order for the word to have full effect upon our lives because it could be you know what I say many times the Cadbury Moses's message today you couldn't bring no as a message when Jesus Christ was coming to the earth it all typed it but it was not a message of the hour amen brings it up and so how relevant and how important it is that when we feast on the Word of God and when we read the Word of God even hear the word of God you want to be under the right expectation we want to know the dispensation of living and what the word is expected to produce the amenity praise God and so we're going to be looking at this rock today and then we're going to be entering into something that the Lord you know just just kind of moved in a peculiar way this week and just the way that all of this and so let's just Lord that we can just the Living God present God the mighty angel Lord that you have the president ministry the stage and the time of the season of your history Lord that could bring us a reality of the presence it brings clarity and oh god it brings fear Lord brings such such a awesome experience and in the woods any describe father because you are God Lord you if you are supernatural and your word comes by faith as a supernatural experience for the sons and daughters of God so this morning Lord as we assemble around you and you word your presence will got me you just blew the side of the speaker move aside - here let me actually Buse of God that are never expressed from that mighty anvil from glory this morning may they come together Oh God and they may there be such a powerful yeah heavily gathering this morning the angels of God even appear in this morning and those Lord that that have gone before us O God because they without us cannot be made perfect Oh God may this be a Assembly of the sons and daughters of God and the power and the anointing of the Holy Spirit in every area in every aspect in every life and bring every demon power subject to your word this morning every chain that hinders the people they can be broken this morning every blind demon that would try to hinder the people from receiving Lord what they need to see in the Word of God this morning may the chains be broken may the shackles be loosed I'm going on may the house of God so sweep into the house this morning lower that the people would be set free liberated that they could see who they are already because this is who we are this is why you called us brethren we pray O God remember our posture blessing prostrating watch children in the name of Jesus Christ bring them safely home Lord we commit this in Jesus a lesser sense according as he hath chosen us in here before the foundations of the world that we should be holy and without blame before everything love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his friend the Lord has blessed us for you see this one the Praxis here in the rapture message it says but to the church the bride the rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her that the revelation the true Bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture a member now why did it recognize what he's saying here that he's saying that there is and that there was to come a revelation to the bride of Jesus Christ because we know that the day that we're living in is the day where the private Christ the true church because there's thousands of churches out there okay and we're not we're not putting some kind enough emphasis on us we're not putting an emphasis on who we are this little church here good neighbor history's or some kind of an emphasis on this organization that we are a part of good neighbor of ministries we are talking about the Church of the Living God we're talking about because God talks about the proc maybe the bride is the wife of Christ the true church and there can only be one bride that there only be one true church everything listen there's only one original daughter everything else that's counterfeit everything else is counterfeit except the original and so if we believe that God is God and that his word is true and that he's not going to change his word and that he said that there is going to be my bride that there's going to be a true church that there's only gonna be one it's that simple now out of all the churches that are up there and you were scattered in all kinds of different churches they were scattered in all kinds of different teachings all kinds of different interpretations of the word of god but God called you because like we just read he's not a church he's not a people he's not sons and daughters of God that he is going to adopt that he is going to to this church and purpose will teachings and doctrines we've got thousands of different interpretations now that Christianity let alone all the different sects and different religions and teachings and all kinds of different interpretations on God we're not interested in that we're interested in what he said in his word that there would be a church and that going be sons and there would be daughters and that he would be adopting them to show that these were his children here like we talked about when somebody goes and adopts a child no no this is not what we're talking about this plan of God was already finished before that you read the scripture it said from being for the nations of the world well you know what boy I look into that church and that girl get all Sidney and that young man there john-boy there are Christians there doing a good job they're out on the mission fields they're doing great things you know what the scripture says without faith it is impossible to please stop baby so we're not looking at works yanti we're not looking at people's ability for the yams people of churches out there in this house [Music] oh yes because it's not that he's dealing with its that attribute that is talking back at home he's bringing back his church he's restoring that that he had work with you will be sons of God rejoice because Jesus resisted truth shall set you come on because he knows the people who are under bondage above there's a lot of you that are still under bondage because that accepted the truth the mud they're accepting some teaching some doctrine interpretation [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] scripture verses seven eight though I walk in the midst of truth somebody fall here though the bark in the midst of trouble some need to be tried for this Russian God knows he needs to revive God knows he needs to wake up God knows he needs to take care that Schlemmer a condition that mental condition I don't know what it is for god knows what it is he says thou shalt stretch forth thy hand against the wrath of my enemies because Satan wants to bite you he was to chain you he wants to keep you under some kind of teaching some kind of denominational you know when you pop over to this church that church I don't care what church you will do you need to be born again yes at the end in the tribulation yes sir because they couldn't get hurt by this worm they come accept them in their dead [Music] they're a little bit fanatical that preacher is a little bit he's a little bit she loves the Lord too much talks about Jesus a little bit too much that's okay those that talked about Jesus we're only an animal the ones that were talking it at Shane poopoo heretic this a nap or a day and uh a lot of them were priests and Jesus went to them and says here up your father and their father Jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] and that's why Jesus when they stood in there and all the Pharisees that they were talking to him and they were saying we are the seed of Abraham we are the children of Abraham we know God but he he says if you were Abraham's seed which is a supernatural see it wasn't that he ate it was a deception it wasn't a pair on the tree or a fruit it was a pair on the ground and they made love and that serpent beguiled Eve and brought forth serpent seed and which is the characteristic that every one of us is born and simply you're born in sin because the character and the nature that was injected into Eve and that's why Cain killed his brother because he was of this father and death [Music] [Music] your path has led to where you are today you can look back on your path of life and you can see so many things that took place in your life and if you are a son or daughter adult you know that you always you know never with the rest they just knew you were a little bit different you were little bit like just just go in the most barriers and then somehow thanks what happened but intercede and intervening your life and you just and you didn't know back on my life it's like a rope you know and I just you know love me because but when I was looking into this yellow you know just reflect on my life as I'm doing that you can see with God intervened where he was just moving I remember you know as a young man just in school and I was there I remember the classroom I can still see it as clear as a bell I was sitting there at tennis with my head and I was there and I was just all of a sudden I just wasn't in the room anymore and I've got this presence that I could not explain it just it just possibly us to think why am I here what am I doing here and and that was an experience that never left it was realized because his spirit inside he was a part of God he could never leave it he was always with it and then till you started to grow up and he started to go things and I remember getting my first job my first job was at Caravan trips it was a manufacturing company and their staple their third third or local was three cameras and they were making I got a job there was one summer before College my first year of college and I decided you know what I'm going to work through it and and it was a full-time job it was a good-paying job I thought all this is good so I stayed there and then they offered me a promotion by the end of the summer and I was rich I looked at the I looked at college I thought about money and I got school I'm in high school within four years of being on that company I got to know the owner of the company very well we kind of just took me under this way his name was Gabriel alter he sent me within four years to the office right next and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars into buying and purchasing rough material for the company at 20 years old I was trying to the local sudden something came on me that I had to be a male but during that time while I was in care man under the leadership of Gabriel alter I went by Rebecca and she was there I heard nobody that there was a new secretary in the office [Music] because some of you up there and I started to look around I was looking for her and then I looked into that corner over there and she was standing at the bottom cap and I remember she looked and I flash of light like a flash of that woman I didn't understand it I just put it away as though stuff I figured wash it or something no it was two attributes was a purpose you look back into the lives you will see were God how do you were I was dealing with you or God was around you yeah it's over there we move done and I went into my home business and I went off on my own and I had some serious ups and major downs and it was 1991 that Bob decided to take everything because it was getting closer to that time where he was not a place he was when a position he was the brilliant revelation to I'm just using this sample season but I want you to see that God's hand is upon your life and the God has a purpose for each and every son you're not an accent I hear he decided that he was gonna see said everything God he wiped out everything I that God had all stretched there was some real statement about doing all kinds of things he said God I remember sitting at the vet Michaels crying this is a young baby just born 1991 he was born Christina just a young child I was sitting on a bed contemplating how I would end my life because it was a mess and I just remember looking up and where my ceiling I said if there's a god I need you that's all I remember and then it was a whirlwind from that point on the next three years and then another [Music] I'd see my friends in church on Sunday and Saturday negative with a different woman I knew the kind of like I knew it was a hypocritical life that's good he says here and he handed me a tape he was 1957 brother banner topical all get knocked off his horse but see had chains and his time that was changed and buck took that path of life and moved it into another direction for years this is going to be hard with a duck this is what's under that heart attack one day just that's how I figured that I would go because when you got so high your heart would race to the point [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] yeah all the time comes around and he tries to put on pants but when God comes into here my color so real [Music] [Applause] yes which concerns at 7:00 well the battery just emergency that's why please do this edge here program speaking I took a bunch of calls from the adoption series I just I rejoiced around this week all my business you get a chance go back and feed on the adoption the series is absolutely incredible there are things in there were stored up in the world of data problem he had given me everything that we have so that when the time - and out of the table the fivefold ministry because let's get this thing straight this is a 20th century profit so that the word can be restored so that the hearts of the children could be turned back to the faith and so he started all this food so for the five fold ministry was the inspiration of my experiences just listening to the words I hope you're placing yourself but we just feel the baby at this point at this time it might be good to come to bring the church so what I think to a complete understanding position you know that if you're not exactly in the right position the word before that's right brother Brad had visions and he would have to wait for everything to come and he was praying for a person one day somebody had to walk in with a half and put that back down and do certain things and then he turned on saying thus saith the Lord you can rise up we just got past the plan and God has sons and daughters of God that need to be positionally placed in the word so that the other side shoot with them so that all those things that he experienced can come to pass me and you were in that crowd gotta get into your possession you need to be adopted so he says here a complete understanding essentially of what we are in Christ Jesus and sometimes I think that preaching is a wonderful thing but these effects by the dealer that teaching goes beyond that and company especially to the church looks like and then if God has sent us to be okay now preachy easily captures the center brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places places where I love teaching this morning [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] - because investors [Music] [Applause] is the mobile you are yes to know what's message that you need to follow what church you need to belong to is not a church for the Piedmont unless it says Jesus body of Christ because that is the church there's a lot of people in here and every Church these three types of Muslims adopt the true believer you've done and that's in every Church but the true believer she wants to know Jesus because that's what this is all about this is the revelation that God gave you that gave you the faith to come and assemble under this revelation to feed on this you can't be anything else you go out there and sing about this church the Catholic Church the one that called you is the one that's continuing to give you the bank to keep pressing [Applause] [Applause] and now the Christ in the church is just being made the whole thing is the revelation of God to take back everything we talked about back in the dark you see how that had to take part of her sin in order to redeem her back just like Jesus had to take on simple flesh and come to this earth and died on a cross so that even we do and bring back is the church the true church that's why you know there's all kinds of teachings up there you could spend days on YouTube with all these different interpretations the world how it began they talked about there's all kinds of different teachings you know ancient teachings the world is ten million years old ten thousand years old those events of lugia destruction eleven thousand years ago you know that all these things are possibly true I want to bust anybody's bubble here but there's a lot of things there that is true there's no way you can deny some of the things that they've that they've uncovered and these places that are thousands of years old [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] in the Egyptian movie [Music] [Music] [Music] so you are not to be concerned about anything else but prior to redemption and you will deny that the world up there they call it become the atmosphere become political powers [Music] [Music] [Music] you're eternal so here is because that's the ministry that he's taught now because that was perfected recognize who they were in the body of Christ to that gravy to the air and we go from to that year three dollar honeymoon allelujah a better this earth goes into great tribulation become a senior you can run tonight they taught what they want to call it earth change global warming whatever it is the signs are all around us that this world is pulling apart to net the politics just turn on CNN Fox News you can only take so much of it because you sit there you go I know that that's corrupt yeah that's supposed to be corrupt because the word says so because God said that's exactly how I was going to get and all these cities are actually fulfilling the prophecy of God's Word so that everything can come in line with the timing of the Great Tribulation that's right there I'm not I'm not a dude they say none of us are doomsday sayers okay that's not what this is about but the word says there's going to be Great Tribulation you see when you go spend some time in Syria in the last three years for those lengths of time in Afghanistan for some of these coming that were totally wiped out as those people they understand the tribulation God he will destroy that's tribulation that's what stopped almost never come back it's going
