[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] good evening friends once again
[0:17] it's a joy and privilege
[0:20] of being here with you to
[0:24] share in the breaking of the bread of
[0:27] life
[0:28] as we open the word of god
[0:32] our hearts rejoice to know
[0:35] that we are fed by his
[0:39] mighty hand thank god let us pray
[0:44] our gracious heavenly father
[0:47] we ask your blessing this evening
[0:51] upon the word of god and we
[0:54] pray that the blessed holy spirit of
[0:57] almighty god
[0:59] will anoint us together lord
[1:02] and speak into our hearts divine truth
[1:06] that will change our lives completely
[1:09] forever
[1:11] and to thee be all the praise the honor
[1:14] and the glory
[1:16] for we thank you in this
[1:19] in jesus name amen
[1:22] and amen once again
[1:26] we continue in our study
[1:29] of these seven church ages
[1:32] we are now uh studying
[1:35] the ephesian or first
[1:39] church age we have dealt
[1:42] with approaching approach topics
[1:46] and now we deal with the
[1:49] topic of tried
[1:53] and true believers
[1:57] christians of that day and time
[2:01] were tried and found to be
[2:05] true holding to god's unchanging word
[2:11] they were tried by revelation they were
[2:15] tried by the word of god
[2:18] satan adding and taking from the word to
[2:21] see
[2:21] whether or not he could sway the people
[2:24] of god
[2:25] away from god's truth so they were tried
[2:29] by the word of god satan
[2:32] tested or tried them again by
[2:35] persecution
[2:38] to see whether or not by persecution
[2:41] he could shift them away from the truth
[2:45] and then they were also tried by their
[2:48] relationship
[2:50] the relationship to christ of course
[2:53] their relationship is based on the word
[2:55] of god
[2:56] and their reaction to the word of god
[3:00] so he tried them on their relationship
[3:03] with jesus christ to see whether they
[3:06] will continue
[3:07] to live holy life and
[3:10] true to god now
[3:13] our scripture reading is found in
[3:16] the book of revelation chapter 2 reading
[3:20] from
[3:20] verse 2.
[3:23] i know thy works and i labor and i
[3:27] patience and how thou canst not
[3:30] bear them which are evil
[3:34] and thou has tried them which say
[3:37] they are apostles and are
[3:40] not and has found them
[3:43] liars and has born
[3:47] and has patience and for my name's sake
[3:51] has labored
[3:53] and has not fainted thank god
[3:57] that church did not faint did not fail
[4:00] did not fall
[4:01] but stood by the word of god
[4:04] until a crown of life they gained
[4:08] for god's glory amen oh thank god how
[4:12] beautifully
[4:13] our lord jesus praises his own
[4:16] and commands his children
[4:20] he takes account of their full
[4:23] spiritual attitude to his
[4:26] word and their behavior
[4:30] in natural life the way they
[4:33] conducted themselves
[4:37] and when he looks at this ephesian age
[4:41] he discerns that there is weakness
[4:44] amongst them
[4:45] false apostles you know
[4:48] and and other things he sees that
[4:52] and the the thing about this is that he
[4:55] does
[4:55] not cry out against it even though he
[4:59] sees it
[5:00] instead he focuses
[5:03] upon the good that they're accomplishing
[5:07] he focuses upon the
[5:11] beauty of their character
[5:14] and the efforts that they are making
[5:19] in serving him and bringing glory
[5:22] to his marvelous name praise
[5:26] god we certainly as christians can learn
[5:29] a
[5:30] marvelous wonderful lesson from that
[5:34] that we are not to focus on the wrong
[5:38] or the evil that most men
[5:41] and women do but to focus
[5:44] on the good parts of their life of
[5:48] course we
[5:48] will call them to attention of the word
[5:52] of god
[5:53] but we must bring their
[5:57] our thoughts to think about the good
[6:00] parts that god has placed within their
[6:04] hearts
[6:05] and within their lives and
[6:08] work with that to bring that to a place
[6:12] where their lives will be shaped
[6:15] and formed to give glory
[6:19] and praise to god hallelujah
[6:22] never mind the trials
[6:25] the tests the tribulations
[6:28] don't ever be discouraged child of god
[6:32] don't ever be discouraged saint of god
[6:36] for god is not ungracious
[6:40] to forget or to overlook
[6:44] the labors of our love and our faith in
[6:47] his word
[6:48] whatever it might be whether it's giving
[6:51] a cup of cold water
[6:53] something to someone helping someone
[6:57] along life's way there is a reward
[7:00] there is a blessing from the very
[7:03] presence
[7:04] of almighty god listen to the scripture
[7:08] i know thy lab works
[7:13] i know thy labor
[7:16] and i know your patience
[7:20] here he is walking in the midst of his
[7:24] church
[7:26] and he knows their works he
[7:29] knows the labor and he
[7:32] knows the patience that it takes
[7:36] to follow implicitly closer
[7:39] to the word of god our god is always
[7:43] aware of your tests your trials
[7:47] and he's fully aware of the sufferings
[7:50] of his people and he cares
[7:55] he cares for you he cares for
[7:59] all those who are undergoing the
[8:02] pressures of life the suffering and the
[8:05] privations
[8:07] and all the trials and troubles
[8:10] that satan brings along our way
[8:14] when israel was in egypt in captivity
[8:19] the bible says the oppression was so
[8:21] strong
[8:22] that they cried out unto the lord and
[8:26] the bible
[8:27] tells us that the lord heard their cry
[8:31] praise god i want to tell you today
[8:34] that same god will hear your cry
[8:38] if you call out to him cry out to him
[8:42] tell him what is your problem
[8:45] tell him what is your care and god
[8:49] cares for you and he will hear and he
[8:52] will
[8:53] understand that god that heard
[8:56] israel back there in egypt is still here
[9:00] today
[9:01] and our god never changes
[9:05] he still has that loving and
[9:08] caring heart amen he
[9:11] always has his ears open to the cries
[9:15] of the oppressed he is a god who
[9:19] walks around us and cares for us
[9:23] and loves us now we know
[9:26] that labor means uh
[9:30] the suffering that comes from oppression
[9:33] it's stress it that comes from
[9:37] being oppressed and
[9:40] god's people not only
[9:43] work in this great labor of love
[9:48] but they suffer for him with joy
[9:53] they carry the word of god
[9:56] bearing the reproach and they are
[10:00] not ashamed of him
[10:03] they are patient
[10:06] in bearing these reproaches
[10:09] these mockings these scuffings
[10:12] they are patients as they carry
[10:16] the great yoke of our savior
[10:19] this first age of ephesians or the
[10:22] ephesian church age
[10:24] carried a lot of persecution for after
[10:27] the departure of paul
[10:30] and john and the other apostles great
[10:33] persecution
[10:34] descended upon the church of the living
[10:37] god
[10:38] for they had to work so hard to preach
[10:41] the word of truth
[10:43] this gospel of light amidst the pagan
[10:47] roman and uh greek and
[10:50] all other nationalities the darkness
[10:54] that was
[10:55] all around they had to labor
[10:58] as much to be able to preach this gospel
[11:03] of course their highest calling
[11:06] was to serve their god
[11:09] and when their hopes were twerted
[11:12] when their work was blighted
[11:17] they were patient they were committed
[11:22] unto him because he had promised them
[11:26] glorious everlasting recompense
[11:30] in heaven in his divine presence
[11:34] i believe we will always need to
[11:37] understand here
[11:39] that god's people never mind
[11:43] or never it doesn't matter
[11:46] how perfect they are in their service to
[11:49] god
[11:50] god's people will always undergo
[11:54] some form of persecution it was so
[11:58] in the book of genesis which is the seed
[12:01] book
[12:01] seed chapters in the book of genesis
[12:05] which is called the book of beginnings
[12:09] and whatever finds its seed form
[12:12] in genesis it runs the gamut of the
[12:15] entire bible
[12:17] right into the closing book
[12:21] of revelation where everything
[12:24] winds up my friends praise god
[12:28] in this first book of genesis we find
[12:31] cain
[12:31] persecution uh persecuting and killing
[12:35] a bell so do these
[12:39] contrary to the word of god
[12:42] persecute and try to kill the
[12:45] abel's or the believers
[12:48] those that are able to hold to god's
[12:51] word
[12:52] for this day so do the canes of this
[12:56] hour try to destroy their
[12:59] brother who tries to serve god
[13:03] we find out we see uh isaac
[13:07] we see he's he sees how
[13:10] isaac and ishmael we see
[13:14] how esau hated jacob
[13:18] and would have killed him we find in the
[13:20] new testament
[13:22] how judas betrayed our lord jesus
[13:26] we find the religious leaders and orders
[13:30] of that day
[13:31] trying to destroy and to kill
[13:35] the believers of that first
[13:38] century and to destroy the church of
[13:42] god in that hour and in that time
[13:45] of course we know that the children of
[13:48] the devil
[13:49] are controlled by the world of flesh
[13:52] and the devil and that the devil and his
[13:56] children
[13:57] hate god and the children
[14:00] of the living god for their controlled
[14:04] by saints and satan's spirit
[14:08] no matter how upright you or
[14:11] i may be or a christian might be
[14:14] in the eyes of the public
[14:18] how gracious how loving how kind we are
[14:21] to our fellow men doesn't matter
[14:25] if we do nothing but good to the people
[14:29] all around us as long as we are
[14:32] confessing jesus
[14:33] christ as our lord and as our
[14:37] savior and that he is our one true
[14:40] god as long as we acknowledge
[14:43] the power of the holy spirit the
[14:46] operation
[14:48] of the gifts of god within the church
[14:51] of the living god tom's prophecy
[14:54] oh praise god hallelujah
[14:57] spirit of satan hates that spirit
[15:01] of the living god and that that's
[15:03] working through
[15:05] the believers of today and we know
[15:08] satan cannot destroy god but he will
[15:12] do all that he can do to destroy
[15:16] the messenger or the vessel
[15:19] to which through which god is expressing
[15:22] or manifesting himself in this
[15:26] hour and in this day and time
[15:29] yes persecutions and trials
[15:32] are a normal part of the christian
[15:36] life and there is only one thing
[15:40] that we can do about that is to commit
[15:44] ourselves to god and surrender ourselves
[15:49] completely to him as the scripture says
[15:53] thou canst not bear them which
[15:56] are evil and thou hast tried them
[16:00] which say that they are apostles
[16:04] and they are not and has
[16:07] found them liars praise
[16:10] god the ephesian church believed
[16:14] that god's people ought to be holy
[16:18] and we are i believe
[16:21] in this day in this hour as we are at
[16:24] the
[16:25] end of the church ages that god's people
[16:28] should still be holy live
[16:32] clean and holy in his presence
[16:35] just as they did in the very
[16:38] first age to prove to the devil
[16:42] that we will not bow down to him in
[16:45] babylon
[16:46] we will not accept his systems
[16:50] we will not be corrupted and
[16:53] swayed by the world world but we will
[16:56] alter god's unchanging hand
[17:00] and not take the level satan's leaven
[17:04] but we will remain as the unleavened
[17:08] bread of life to the people that
[17:11] are in the world amen hallelujah
[17:15] and as the church of god we are required
[17:19] by the word of god to put away from us
[17:22] the evil thing
[17:23] put away the wicked ones from in
[17:27] amongst us we are a people that are
[17:30] separated to god and separated
[17:33] unto his word hallelujah we should
[17:37] not allow the world to enter
[17:40] among us neither should we put up
[17:44] with any sin within the
[17:47] church of the living god hallelujah
[17:50] holiness
[17:51] holiness without which no man no woman
[17:54] no person shall see the lord it's not a
[17:58] phrase it's not a word
[18:00] to the christian but to the christian
[18:03] it is a way of life to live and
[18:06] walk in the holiness of the one true
[18:09] and living god the scripture reads
[18:13] will strike them that say they are
[18:15] apostles and are not
[18:17] and has found them liars
[18:20] praise god what a blood statement
[18:25] you have tried those who say
[18:28] they are apostles they are acclaiming
[18:32] and proclaiming themselves they
[18:36] have this sense of religious spiritual
[18:39] self-promotion
[18:41] that they are apostles
[18:44] i am bishop so-and-so i
[18:47] am the reverend so-and-so i am apostle
[18:51] so-and-so i am prophet and
[18:54] whatever and they place these
[18:58] various designations which are
[19:00] scriptural
[19:01] in the word of god but they lift those
[19:04] scriptural
[19:05] designations out of the word of god and
[19:08] place it upon themselves it's not god
[19:12] confirming who they are but they
[19:15] are in this spirit of self-promotion
[19:19] calling themselves and making themselves
[19:22] prophets and apostles and teachers and
[19:25] pastors
[19:26] and placing themselves in these various
[19:28] positions
[19:30] hallelujah and being presumptuous
[19:33] in the presence of almighty god
[19:36] hallelujah
[19:37] amen so the bible tells us
[19:40] the ephesian church try them
[19:43] how are we to try them but the bible
[19:46] does tell us
[19:48] that we ought to try the spirit
[19:51] now galatians chapter 1
[19:54] verses 8 but though we
[19:57] are an angel from heaven
[20:01] preach any other gospel unto you
[20:05] then that wick
[20:09] hath we have preached unto you let
[20:12] him be accursed or
[20:15] praise god you see paul was
[20:19] telling the ephesian people hold to the
[20:22] original truth and
[20:25] doctrines declared by
[20:28] the apostles who had brought the
[20:30] original word
[20:32] and that original word could not change
[20:36] by one dot or by one dash
[20:39] that word had to remain the same word of
[20:42] god for the owl
[20:44] and so paul is saying if anyone
[20:48] else brings some other gospel to you
[20:52] that you are to hold to god's hand
[20:55] paul is saying even if i paul were to
[20:59] come and try to change the revelation
[21:04] that i have given to you
[21:07] then let me be a curse
[21:11] you see paul knew that the revelation
[21:14] that was given to him
[21:15] was correct originally
[21:18] by the word of god so he god couldn't
[21:22] give him a first or second and third
[21:23] revelation
[21:24] because god being perfect
[21:28] his word to it through his apostle
[21:31] is perfect so we thank god for the
[21:35] perfect
[21:36] word of god for this day and for this
[21:39] hour that we have received and we give
[21:42] him
[21:42] all the glory hallelujah amen
[21:46] now we know that satan's trick
[21:50] is always to add or take away
[21:54] from the word of god even as he did with
[21:58] eve in the garden of eden
[22:02] we see him doing the same thing through
[22:04] the entire bible
[22:06] adding or taking away from the word of
[22:10] god
[22:11] to distract to to deflect
[22:15] and to misdirect god's people
[22:18] and their eyes their thoughts away
[22:21] from the truth of the word of god
[22:24] hallelujah amen glory to god
[22:28] now we see here clearly friends that
[22:30] god's word
[22:32] does not change and god's word will
[22:35] come exactly as he wants it
[22:38] revealed to us now praise god
[22:42] these false apostles
[22:45] had come up with their own ideas their
[22:48] own thoughts their own philosophies
[22:51] and presenting them to the people
[22:55] as the word of god as it is today
[22:59] we find the preaching of psychology
[23:02] and all manner of other isms
[23:06] and it's being preached across many
[23:08] pulpits
[23:09] and declared as if it was
[23:12] the word of god no but thank god
[23:16] the ephesian church knew the word
[23:20] that paul had taught them
[23:23] and they were all anointed and full of
[23:26] the holy ghost
[23:27] by the laying on of the hands of paul
[23:31] and timothy any other apostle
[23:34] that was anointed by the holy spirit
[23:37] hallelujah
[23:38] amen and so there had the spiritual
[23:41] strength
[23:43] and boldness to stand before
[23:46] these false apostles and listen to them
[23:51] first
[23:52] and then say to them you are
[23:55] not saying what paul has said
[23:58] you are not preaching what paul
[24:02] has taught us according to the word of
[24:04] god
[24:05] and therefore we know that you
[24:08] are false no matter how religious
[24:12] they may sound no matter how beautiful
[24:15] their speeches their sermons that they
[24:18] present
[24:19] if it does not align with
[24:22] what the prophet of the hour
[24:25] says the messenger of the day says
[24:28] it's contrary to the word of god and its
[24:32] fault
[24:32] according to god's word oh praise god
[24:35] hallelujah
[24:36] friends that ought to set our hearts on
[24:39] fire
[24:40] we ought to realize that we ought to get
[24:43] back to the word of god because that is
[24:46] our shield the word of god is our
[24:50] shield and it guards us against
[24:53] every weapon and every evil thing
[24:56] satan hallelujah o praise god
[25:00] hallelujah oh friends i tell you it's
[25:03] marvelous that god has given us
[25:05] this power and authority to discern the
[25:08] lord's body
[25:10] to test and to try these spirits
[25:14] to recognize this false apostles
[25:18] it is not that we as individuals
[25:22] try these false apostles teachers
[25:26] and so on but it's the word himself or
[25:29] itself that tries these people
[25:33] hallelujah and i thank god that
[25:36] god has sent a divine a messenger
[25:42] in this last church age just as he did
[25:46] in the first church age the first
[25:49] church age messenger was paul
[25:52] the last church age messenger is
[25:55] william marian branham whom
[25:58] god sent with the holy spirit
[26:01] and sent him with the word of god of
[26:04] truth
[26:05] anointed him with signs wonders and
[26:08] miracles
[26:09] to vindicate that that which he
[26:12] was speaking was thus saith
[26:15] the lord god hallelujah amen
[26:18] and he proved to the world that he was
[26:22] the real
[26:23] messenger the real one sent
[26:26] from the presence of god hallelujah
[26:29] amen yes sir i want to thank god
[26:32] that he opened my eyes and i recognized
[26:36] this marvelous messenger that he has
[26:39] sent
[26:40] in this last day and from that day
[26:44] of recognizing this marvelous and
[26:47] wonderful
[26:48] messenger that message has inspired me
[26:52] my friends it's motivated me it's
[26:55] kept me and kept my heart mind and
[26:58] eyes upon the word of truth
[27:02] and saw the same spirit i have held to
[27:05] that until this day and may i
[27:09] hold to god's word unto the very
[27:12] end until us the scripture songwriter
[27:15] says
[27:16] until i come to the last mile of
[27:19] the way amen hallelujah amen praise god
[27:23] they knew that what the messenger
[27:28] spoke then and what the messenger has
[27:30] spoken
[27:31] now is the same word that
[27:34] paul had spoken and we
[27:38] cannot and they should not
[27:41] and we cannot deviate in
[27:44] any way away from that word of god not
[27:48] for a moment
[27:49] not for one jot one tittle
[27:52] or for one i owe the hallelujah
[27:55] especially in this last age
[27:59] we've seen so many false prophets
[28:01] appearing
[28:03] so many false teachers appearing
[28:06] on the scene and they keep telling you
[28:10] all these various so-called
[28:13] truths and approaches to the word of god
[28:18] but thank god their god sent
[28:21] a last day prophet to cut through
[28:24] all of the garbage all of the
[28:27] religious mess and to reveal to us
[28:31] thus saith the lord the truth
[28:34] out of the word of god hallelujah
[28:37] and this god sent prophet truly up
[28:41] god said prophet message was get back to
[28:45] the word
[28:45] get back to the original faith go
[28:49] down to what god has left you in this
[28:52] bible
[28:53] through the ministry of his anointed
[28:56] apostles prophets teachers
[28:59] that he has sent his messengers
[29:03] now according to the word of god
[29:06] paul recognizes that these
[29:10] false apostles are really
[29:13] graveness and grievous wolves
[29:17] amongst the people now listen what paul
[29:20] said
[29:20] once i am gone they'll try to come and
[29:23] claim
[29:24] of course equal revelation
[29:27] or that they have the same kind of
[29:30] anointing
[29:31] but you see their purpose is not to help
[29:34] you
[29:35] it's not to heal you but it's to steal
[29:38] the truth from you
[29:39] it's to destroy you is to distract you
[29:42] and to throw you off take you off
[29:46] from centering your entire soul and
[29:49] being
[29:50] upon the word of god for this day
[29:53] acts chapter 20 verses 27
[29:57] to 32 paul is speaking
[30:00] for i have not shown
[30:04] to declare unto you
[30:09] all of all the counsels of god
[30:14] take heed therefore unto yourself
[30:19] and to all the flock of god which is
[30:22] among you
[30:25] which god has made you overseers
[30:30] to feed the church of god
[30:33] oh for he had which he has purchased
[30:36] with his own precious blood
[30:40] for i know this
[30:44] that after my departing
[30:47] shall grievous wolves enter
[30:51] in amongst you amongst you
[30:54] not from somewhere out there or
[30:57] somewhere in the world but right from
[31:00] amongst you
[31:01] in your message in your
[31:04] face that was taught to you there will
[31:07] arise
[31:08] grievous wolves from amongst you
[31:12] not sparing the flock
[31:15] and also of your own selves
[31:19] shall men arise
[31:23] hallelujah speaking what
[31:26] perverse things in other words
[31:30] perverting the message perverting the
[31:32] word
[31:34] perverting what you were taught in the
[31:37] word
[31:38] men will arise from right amongst you
[31:42] preachers teachers will rise from
[31:45] amounts you
[31:46] that will pervert this very word
[31:50] that you have received and
[31:53] they are not speaking god's word but
[31:56] their own thoughts
[31:57] and their own ideas to draw away
[32:00] the disciples not to follow the
[32:04] prophet's message
[32:05] but to follow them to follow
[32:09] them but our
[32:12] directive is to point people
[32:15] to the word of the living god
[32:19] therefore watch and remember says the
[32:22] scripture
[32:23] that by the grace of god three years
[32:27] i cease not to warn everyone
[32:30] night and day with tears
[32:33] and now brethren i commend you to god
[32:38] and to the word of his grace which is
[32:41] able to build you up and give you an
[32:44] inheritance
[32:45] amongst all of them which are sanctified
[32:50] of course john knew this for in john
[32:54] first john chapter 4 verse 1
[32:57] he says many false prophets are already
[33:01] gone
[33:01] out into this world and it was
[33:05] by going of course by them going against
[33:08] the word of god
[33:10] that made them into false prophets
[33:13] hallelujah oh yes praise god hallelujah
[33:17] right here in the first church age the
[33:19] ephesian church age
[33:21] is where it all started as in the old
[33:24] testament
[33:25] everything started in that book of
[33:27] genesis now we
[33:28] see this in the first church age the
[33:32] evil workings of satan
[33:35] satan's tale started twitching
[33:39] his lies began being
[33:43] sent out upon the people everywhere
[33:46] and already their people had started
[33:49] to deny the very word of god
[33:53] hallelujah i mean of course
[33:57] you would then deny the word of god by
[33:59] setting up their own creeds their own
[34:02] darkness and their own teachings
[34:05] and to be anti-word is to be
[34:09] antichrist for jesus is the word
[34:13] and if you are against the word then you
[34:16] will be
[34:17] accounted to be anti-christ
[34:21] hallelujah or praise god
[34:24] we know it all started in that first
[34:27] church age
[34:29] and we know that it will continue
[34:32] right on to the very end
[34:35] of these church ages where it will come
[34:39] to its
[34:40] harvest time its ripening hour
[34:44] where it will eventually according to
[34:47] the word
[34:48] the word says they will actually take
[34:51] over
[34:52] and the true seed of god will be pushed
[34:55] out
[34:56] but when we are pushed out we'll be
[34:58] taken up
[34:59] hallelujah so we can hold to god's word
[35:03] and god will begin to deal with the
[35:06] spirit of the antichrist
[35:07] that's been left here upon the earth
[35:11] yes friends we see it right there
[35:14] going through all the ages until this
[35:18] anti-war becomes a anti-christ
[35:22] a world system that is taken
[35:25] over entirely and begin to claim
[35:28] infallibility of the word of god
[35:32] hallelujah oh my friends thank god
[35:36] we have an anchor that keeps our soul
[35:39] we have been founded upon the foundation
[35:43] of the revelation of the fullness of the
[35:46] word of god
[35:47] where we will not look to the left nor
[35:50] to the right
[35:50] we will not turn to the left or to the
[35:53] right
[35:53] but we will press the to the mark of the
[35:56] high calling
[35:57] in our lord and savior jesus christ
[36:00] hallelujah
[36:01] oh my this antichrist
[36:05] anti-word system is a complete
[36:08] repudiation of the fullness
[36:11] of the word of god listen satan doesn't
[36:14] just come right
[36:15] out and deny the bible
[36:18] he does not just come right out and say
[36:22] oh it's not the word of god
[36:25] no sir listen revelation 22
[36:30] for i testify to you
[36:33] and unto every man that heareth the
[36:36] words
[36:37] of the prophecy of this book
[36:40] if any man shall add on to these things
[36:44] god shall add unto him the plagues that
[36:48] are written
[36:49] in this book of prophecy
[36:53] for god shall take away his
[36:56] part out of the book of life and out of
[36:59] the holy city
[37:01] and from the things which are written in
[37:04] this book
[37:05] or yes god's word is unchanging
[37:09] god himself is unchanging
[37:12] one word taken from god's
[37:16] economy one word
[37:19] added to god's economy just as he did in
[37:23] eden
[37:24] it changes the entire structure
[37:27] and just as satan did then in the garden
[37:30] of eden
[37:31] so is he attempting to do
[37:34] here today adding one little word
[37:38] trying to take away a word out
[37:41] of god's promised revelation
[37:44] for this day and just as it brought
[37:48] death sin death and destruction back
[37:51] then
[37:52] so does it do the same today
[37:56] amen yes sir it brings that
[38:00] death and destruction while the
[38:02] antichrist spirit
[38:04] will begin to grow and to flourish
[38:07] under that type of system
[38:10] here we see friends twins
[38:15] in the beginning twins in the end
[38:18] the two trees in the garden in the
[38:21] beginning
[38:22] and we see these two trees again
[38:26] side by side they have to grow in the
[38:29] church
[38:30] side by side they have to grow right in
[38:33] their belief in the word of god
[38:38] in the same art they have to grow
[38:41] good and evil cain and abel
[38:45] isaac and ishmael judas
[38:48] and jesus side by side they have to grow
[38:52] taking off this very same nourishment
[38:57] growing in the same earth
[39:00] watered by the same reign of the holy
[39:03] spirit
[39:05] and benefiting by the same
[39:08] revelation the same son for one will
[39:12] take that revelation
[39:14] and grow and live by it one another will
[39:17] take the same revelation
[39:19] pervert it and twist it and make it
[39:22] an antichrist system but praise
[39:26] god because they come from different
[39:29] seeds they act very differently
[39:33] when they are made manifested praise god
[39:37] one tree is anti-god antichrist
[39:41] and against everything god does
[39:44] substituting its own
[39:45] creeds and its own dogmas for the true
[39:48] and
[39:49] living word of the living god
[39:52] hallelujah and that is why cain
[39:55] hated abel and that is why
[39:59] the cain the spirit of cain in the
[40:02] people of this day
[40:03] hates the people of god the people
[40:06] with the spirit of abel upon them
[40:10] but thank god we have his promise
[40:14] fear not little flock for it is your
[40:17] father's good pleasure
[40:19] to give you the kingdom stay with the
[40:22] word of god
[40:24] keep that word as a shield
[40:27] between you and the devil
[40:30] oh praise god eve did not do that
[40:34] she let down her shield she let down the
[40:38] bars and the devil came right in
[40:42] oh praise god and when the church lets
[40:45] down her standards lets down the bar
[40:49] of the word of god then friends the
[40:52] depths and darkness of satan creeps
[40:55] right
[40:56] into the church of god but we thank god
[40:59] for this day that we're living in that
