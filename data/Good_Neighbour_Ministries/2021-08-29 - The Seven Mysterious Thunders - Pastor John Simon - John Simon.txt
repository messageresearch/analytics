translation i'm ready to change [Music] praise god i'm ready to move i hope you are too god bless you for his grace please be seated we want to thank god for all of you that are here today by his grace and for those of you who are uh watching or listening online just to let you know over the past week we had to take uh severe measures uh as you know the authority of a pastor on the earth is even more than that of an angel in heaven and so we determined uh led by the holy spirit not to wait on the government to mandate anything because we are the ones that really have the spiritual authority for that matter and as we are the family of god as our brother saying and we ought to love the family of god then we need to obey the scriptures as paul taught and brother branham taught that we who are strong ought to humble ourselves make way for those who are weak and because we have children we have respectable honored older folk within our services then we have to make way for them people with low immune deficiencies we have to make way for them and therefore um we let the email go out that only those who have been vaccinated will be allowed to come within the walls of this church the government is going to mandate that sometime in the future but we are not like i said waiting on them so i want you to be assured that when you walk in here that the people that are in here are vaccinated that does not mean anyone can be a carrier right but the fact is because the other people are vaccinated they have a great measure of protection and we want to thank god for that and i want to thank god uh for all those of you who were uh humbly enough simply enough to believe the word of god and the directives of his officers and servant and you have obeyed it and you are here today by god's grace hopefully that those who are not vaccinated will get vaccinated and soon as the bible says not just watch the services on television or on tv or youtube but the bible says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together as the manner of some is so let's do all we can so that we can assemble together safely and wisely i've always said through the years do all you can and then you know stand do your best first of all then let god do the rest but not drop your hands and say oh god is going to protect me god is good no no he will allow you to do whatever you can and when you search the message you find brother branham's kids um get cold and he'll take them to the doctor was it that he didn't have faith yeah but why why does he have to exercise the fate for something like that when there is natural healing staring you in the face right i don't want to go back to my old message some people are going to be dying on the doctor's doorstep the prescription the antidote is right in front of them but they refuse to use it because they think they know best they become doctors and scientists and got more faith than the prophet and everything else like that so let's trust that god will help our brothers and sisters you know they can believe what they want that's you got a right to do that but the facts are staring you in the face and we all have to uh react to those facts may the lord bless you just thought i'd say a few remarks on this matter now of course if people were to uh go and travel and then come back if you are already vaccinated just like in the natural world you don't really have to go and separate yourself you can still be here in the service because you're already been vaccinated okay so let the lord have his way and bless us each one for his glory and honor praise the lord amen god bless you well i'd like to speak today for a while on the seven mysterious thunders right that is the topic the seven mysterious thunders that is found in revelation chapter 10 verses 1 to 7. other places in the book of revelation but we want to use that as our as our text amen it's all part of the of the series of the topic of the eternal church age and i'm jumping over a few things here just to get to this because it's so juicy to me revelation 10 1-7 shall we read uh together if there's anything i've forgotten brothers you you brothers can absolutely remind me okay uh praise the lord any announcement or anything let us read together and this is john the apostle speaking he's caught up in the spirit on the isle of patmos and if you're going to get anything done for god you first got to get in the spirit and while in the spirit john is saying and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot up on the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer amen father we thank thee for the reading of thy word we thank you for the open hearts of your people we thank you for the inspiration to bring forth thy word from the word for we ask it in jesus name amen and amen praise the lord please be seated last week of course we spoke on the topic of the eternal church age and um i don't want you to think that and this is for you who are believers and those who are out on youtube and in various areas that will hear me um this topic i don't want you to think that this was the figment of my own imagination of what i think or what i believe and just presenting something to you that is way out because it's not you know as i pointed that you directly to the quotation that came from brother william marion branham the 20th century prophet the messenger to the seventh uh church age that you know spoke to us clearly for he was the messenger to the leodician church age which is the pentecostal church age and in a message stature of a perfect man in 1960 [Music] amen there he spoke and said that he is waiting for that time when that man or that woman will come along those ones that are going to go into the eternal church age he uses the term the eternal church age so it's not something that was made up it's something that he said perfectly in the word of god hallelujah now i want you to notice that before brother branham was even allowed to see the revelation of the seven seals he already knew that there was going to be an eternal church age because he already told us after seven days of a week you've got to go back to the first day the week is ended and then you go back to the original first day the way things were that's the the simple principle of the word of god amen hallelujah and so he knew clearly that there had to be an eternal church age at the ending of the seals at the end of the seals and of course the seven church ages as we know it as you can see it right behind me they deal with time i call that the seven day week god's seven day week he's dealt with seven church ages during a period of time and but this eternal church age has nothing to do with time this church age is eternal and since he said it was eternal then the people who will inhabit that eternal church age must necessarily be eternal also themselves then if there is a church age eternal church age which really uh in the not in the spiritual sense that it can't be an age but those terms were used by him so we can understand what he's talking about because he's talking about eternity right and the concept of eternity your mind our minds is not expanded enough to take that in so he used terms that we can uh be able to grasp so he said eternal church age eternal people therefore there has to be an eternal messenger the messenger also has to be eternal therefore let no man think of himself that maybe he is the next messenger because the messenger this one we're talking about is the lord himself who shall descend with a shout the voice of an archangel the trump of god he is the eternal messenger jesus christ hallelujah praise the lord and if this this eternal church age like the prophet said starts at the end of those seals then then it must be in progress right now and it means we are in the middle of it right now and only those who are made to become conscious of it or it's revealed to them will be fully aware then that they have already started to be caught up into another dimension of revelation and truth which will change as you and morphe right into the rapturing grace of god that is why without these seven thunders you can't have rapturing revelation rapturing faith for the rapturing grace of god that will not heal you but change your entire being and take you into the presence of almighty god hallelujah amen glory to god now we must see here that john saw the book and he began to weep but later on he was told don't weep john the lamb has prevailed to open the seven seals hallelujah and john heard a voice saying come and see when john looked praised god he did not read his name but he saw symbols for in the book was a lot of symbols and he saw his name in symbol form he saw himself acting out or living out the the scriptures he and the people of his age were supposed to fulfill he saw all of that happen and realized that if he could see that then his name was in the book and he began to shout and he began to praise god and i believe you will shout and you will praise god when you recognize that is becoming for you to fulfill all righteousness all of the word for your day and for your time hallelujah amen he saw himself fulfilling scripture and recognize that that was the evidence that his name was on the book amen and to fulfill scripture we don't just go out like consciously deciding well i'm going to fulfill the scripture you can and god will help you but the fact is because you were born to that purpose you will be walking right into the fulfillment of scripture whatever you say and do because the holy spirit is leading you back where you come from hallelujah and you realize that you can sing the song not by a music but by revelation i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them hallelujah i'm one of them no matter what anybody says i know that i'm one of them by the grace of god hallelujah amen john the bible tells us come and see and when the one the first seal was opened or the seal was open and by the way the coats i'm gonna use mainly out of the first seal the right through the seal book but mainly from the first seal around page 125 when going on up amen john said come and see turn the blast amen praise god john heard the thunder's blessed amen but not just the thunderblast he heard a voice amen a lot of people are here and thunders but they haven't heard what the thunder said like the disciples in the bible with jesus they heard the thunder on the mountains amen but the rest of them didn't understand what the thunder was saying listen there's a lot of people and great men have talked about these seven thunders in the past and they were right on target but it wasn't uh all truth it wasn't the fullness of it it hadn't come to its rightness yet but they caught something that will open the eyes and the heart and the mind of all the others coming behind praise god and we thank god for them and the holy spirit confirmed it that it is the word of god amen so we thank god for these great seven mysterious thunders and the first one that blasted john heard the the voice speaking and looked and whenever you look or anybody through the ages really look in the book after that the word is open to them or the thunder speaks to them they're going to seek their name in the book and develop a certainty of god and their develop a rapture in faith they're going to know that my name is on that book hallelujah and they're knowing that they are now in progress in the progress of the rapture amen lord of god they're not imagining it they know it they can't bring you into it they can bring anybody into it it's only the holy spirit can bring them into this secret hallelujah amen because you know what this turk pull is not going to be copycat it is not going to be impersonated because it's only revealed and the revelation is given only by god's grace hallelujah only given by god's wonderful grace hallelujah amen oh praise god listen now the lamb knew that there were names put in there from the foundation of the world and as long as those names have never been made manifested on the earth as yet amen you see he had to stay there as an intercessor amen there's our predestination hallelujah he had to stay there until the last church age and the last names that were in the book were made manifested that don't mean just naturally born but it means a manifested son or daughter of god who have caught the revelation of the holy spirit amen and they are born again and made manifest hallelujah amen oh praise god the man manifests upon the earth to give god glory amen oh he came only to die brother branham said for those whom god have ordained to eternal life and by by for knowledge he saw them amen his will was that none should perish but by his foreknowledge he knew those who would perish and those who would not amen but his will is that god so loved the world amen that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life but yet saying that he knew those who would and those who will not amen now you see out there they just have this big white net where they just say you know whoever loves god or whatever you know it's just like any woman that loves me that doesn't make her my wife you see that's anybody that loves jesus that doesn't make them a christian you can love him but as if he already shown his love for you by extending his grace to you by extending to you his hand like the king and esther had to reach out with the scepter before she could even come in and talk to him and that's the way we are now the scepter of his grace has got to be extended to you glory to god amen so brother sister we want to thank god because it's only with the sounding of the thunders that we are going to really be able to understand and hear and know who we are and what we were raised up for glory to god hallelujah amen now we know that we are no longer in the pentecostal age how many knows that brother branham was the messenger of the leodision pentecostal age hallelujah and then if we are not any longer in the uh laodicean church age then where are we at what is our position then in this statue of a perfect man in this great diagram of the ages you're not in any of those ages so where are you at uh uh are we just out there wandering around floating around uh worrying and wondering where we are at amen because i will tell you right now our names are not identified with those seven church ages your names are not identified with those seven church ages oh praise god hallelujah because my friends we've got to think has god forgotten us are we outside of his memory that he can't even remember us any more but there's got to be somewhere where we have our names identified within the great book of life praise god amen glory to god i tell you friends that we got to find our place we got to know our position we got to know where we are and when i say knowing your position in christ the word you got to know whether you're in luther wesley that's how you know your position some people get a different idea they put it there presuming and all kinds of stuff and what your position is and and you got to find your position and and you know pushing people to pray and ask god to show you if you're a prophet yeah are you a prophet brother are you deacon are you administrations you got the gifts of this or that and pushing people along that line but it is to know your position in christ the word what is your position hallelujah yes you might have come up under in the seventh church age but of what spirit are you are you of the first year change are you of the second are you of luther and lutheran spirit on you or catholic or whatever you must know your position in christ hallelujah and so we opt to know what it is quote brother branham now here is the plan he's talking about god's plan now here is the plan here's the plan of it the first thing happens there is an announcement and what happens a seal is opened what is that it's a mystery that is unfolded and when a mystery unfolds a trumpet sounds it declares a war a spiritual war then a plague falls and another church age opens amen praise god oh praise god brother sister you hear what that said a plague falls and another church age opens oh praise god he said now you know there's all kinds of plagues there's not just one kind of plagues but there are several kinds of plagues you gotta understand what he's talking about here amen now what is the war for amen what is this spiritual war for the war comes because the eyes of certain believers are open to the lord and some like minds and eyes are left blinded and they can't see what you're talking about and it creates a spiritual war or clash of ideas clash of thoughts clash about the truths that are embodied within the word of god hallelujah amen and so we see it's a great plan until it comes to that last angel see oh no he has no certain mystery amen all them truths that wasn't fully revealed yet see as the revelation comes he reveals those things in his days if you want to read it revelation 10 1 to 4 i'm quoting brother branham here he takes the book of seals and he breaks them and shows them to the seventh angel see the lamb breaks the seals but he only shows them to the seventh right angel the seventh angel doesn't break the seals if the lamb breaks the seals and as brother branham says and then he takes them and he shows them to the seventh angel the mysteries of god is the ministry of the seventh angel now we have just come through the church ages using even history to prove that it is the angel's message of that seventh church listen it reveals all the mysteries that has been in the past the the church ages you must realize if you go back and you really look at them they're telling you of the past and they're revealing to you the trail of the serpent it revealing to you the mystery of inequity as it twisted its way through the history of the past listen it reveals all things that had been in the past and then he repeats it again remember all things in the past amen all the things in the past revelation remember he says again revelation 10 1-7 that is to be that is to be hallelujah remember in the days of the seven angel his sounding fourth blasting forth the gospel trumpet he is to finish right he is the finish the mysteries of god hallelujah mine think of it friends the progress of how it goes from doctrine saying doctrine and then the doctrine becomes a statue and then they take the statue and start to become a church see and that's how it was through the dark ages with reformation with luther and so on they he came genuine messenger wesley and so on and so on and then along came the pentecostal age with the baptism of the holy spirit amen and their cabbage down on that they go right down on the baptisma holy spirit and that's where they put their their signpost right there on the baptism of the holy spirit right oh my but you see there cannot be no more ages hallelujah i'm quoting brother branham there cannot be no more ages hallelujah that is all of it that leodysion church age amen and we found that by studying scripture that the messenger of an age he said notice comes right at the end of the edge not at the beginning but the messenger comes at the end of the age hallelujah praise god so paul didn't come at the beginning of pentecost he come when that age was about to end is that right oh my think about it now i'm not going to bring in here and tell you about the cornerstone right now how a corner stone always points two sides where it came from and then it points you to the new age that's coming up because it's a cornerstone amen and they always reject the cornerstone anyway praise the lord hallelujah but they're going to find out later that those cornerstones mini cornerstones was really the head stone amen praise god glory to god so then brothers paul came at the end of the pentecostal age not at the beginning brother branham came at the end of this modern pentecostal age that they had up there in jesus street not at the beginning of it but at the end of it and so a lot of people don't recognize that he is not the messenger for this eternal one i'm talking about but that he was the messenger for the last one that just ended because he says that ledician messenger was the messenger to that pentecostal edge back there and all them ages are over they're gone hallelujah he came during the pentecostal age there he was that messenger praised the lord but thank god he was a cornerstone he not only uh gathered up all the lost truths and all the twisted up scribbled up things of the edge and straightened it back out but he also before he left the scene pointed and said behold the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world amen praise god hallelujah so that's his twofold ministry tell this year and the his ministry to the bride pointing her not to himself but pointing her to the mighty angel the lamb of god that broke the seals the mighty god jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever pointing heart revealed word the open book now put your eyes upon jesus hallelujah and look away to him amen glory to god so the mighty angel using that prophet body started to speak to his chil to his wife by the opening of the word praise the lord glory to god hallelujah i'm so thankful amen that that pentecostal age amen was able to hear the prophet beginning the voice of god in his last days bringing the uh rapturing to grace truths through the prophet of god and they're rejected not a prophet but the headstone for that prophet had changed to the headstone had come down and was now using the prophet to speak through the prophet and the spirit of god speaks through the prophet and in thinking they were rejecting william branham they rejected the headstone they rejected the headstone oh god have mercy and oh there is in an actual fact you know what they did they refused the very word they claimed to love serve and worship they refused it and it's that simple how things happen with the things of the living god and all that word was doing was revealing christ and they rejected jesus christ amen but the true believers started to feed on christ the true believers began to feed on the word of god for their day and for their age hallelujah glory to god amen now know this here brother sisters that the prophet revealed the seals brought the seals forth uh bro and they were broken and they were revealed praise the lord and then they were rejected and then when they were rejected that's how come we had the second crucifixion of jesus christ in the word form not in the flesh form but they rejected him again not up on golgotha's hill back there in in israel but from the pulpits they rejected him pierced him with that criticism pierced him with their talks pierced them with all their rejection of the word of god and they rejected the word of god for their day and crucified it and closed out their age to spiritual death because the plague of spiritual death is what fell on them and they begin to die right out and they believe that they are still flourishing by the thousands millions they're flourishing we are rich we are increased with goods we have big buildings we have big money we have big business operations and noise thou not you're spiritually naked miserable wretched blind and the misery of it you don't even know it you're so smart you don't think that you are miserable and that you're naked and that you're poor and when you see all this these things around you how can i be poor i got all this but this bible is saying god's diagnosis your diagnosis you're not even a doctor and we you got a diagnosis that you can i i don't need to get the the the shot i don't need to do this i i i have faith and i don't need nothing amen you you know but the fact is that's your diagnosis god's diagnosis you're wretched miserable naked blind and you don't even know it amen and so the prophet closed out and all that age and start like john hallelujah preparing the way for the messenger for the new age like john prepared the way for jesus who saw about the message of the kingdom of god and he came the word come on the scene hallelujah we'll praise god so did brother branham introduce some new age they didn't understand that when he drew that that's what he was doing that's what he was doing he was introducing you can call it a new age but to me or you who believe you're elected and was in it from the big before the foundations uh there is the new age that actually brother branham was introducing us to appointing us to amen clearly that we may understand hallelujah amen now when we look back here and we see these seven church ages in between the seven church edges and uh the top or the cap there's a gap in there right and we have holy spirit but there's a gap in there that is telling you that the capstone the people of the capital the people that goes into that cap of the pyramid really are not of the church ages they are really not part of the church ages but there are different people that just passed through the church age like jesus passed through mary but yet they're really not from that church age but they were allowed to pass through it or the church age was used to bring them to manifestation and so god using this is showing us our own journey to bring us out of our spiritual amnesia of which we were in amen hallelujah amen so that gap is telling us that you are not really from the church ages physically your body is still located in the seventh church age physically but you the man the woman amen at the end of those seals by a revelation that has broken to that eternal church age you recognize that you are in two worlds you are physically in the time with your body but your soul being a part of god you're break back into eternity into another dimension with the living god hallelujah amen oh praise god brother sister i want to thank god for opening my eyes amen you know that the real pentecostal bride we're talking about pentecost now i come back talking about pentecost do you know the people of the real pentecost they're all dead already and they're sleeping they're already gone the ones we have among us now there may be seeds of god mixed in there and waiting to be called out i don't know but they are not the real genuine pentecostals that is satan's attempt of confusion and chaos that is the same kind of tongues that was in uh that nebuchadnezzar or belshazzu's feast that the writing on the wall these tongues and everything that we're hearing now that's what it is now it's sowing chaos and confusion and all kinds of stuff like that they're coming up with all kinds of outrageous things getting the baptist holy spirit with by laughing getting the baptism holy spirit by by crawling on the ground and all kinds of things of that nature all my brother sister and they've gone absolutely contrary to the word of god but the real elected among the pentecostals amen they are asleep they are all dead now amen so we got to look now where do we come in as i repeat again if you're not in those seven ages but you're here you know you're here so spiritually where are you located and i'm saying to you that you are a part of that capstone you're a part of the top of the pyramid but something or somebody has to take you across that chasm that chasm came between man and god sin brought it in and somebody or something has to take you back that is why brother branham church his book many other places tell you the very importance of revelation you cannot do without revelation because it's revelation is going to take your back because revelation is not by study it's not by mind it's not my intelligence it's not by man it's by the grace of almighty god hallelujah you can be a shepherd out in a field can't even spell your name and out of nowhere all of a sudden bang a thought hits you god begins to reveal and that man by the name of amos just come out from among them cows and all kinds of stuff and stomp down to that city in the way of a true prophet and begin to prophesy the word of god hallelujah god doesn't need your wisdom god doesn't need your intelligence god just needs you to be a yielded vessel so that he could speak out his intelligence his wisdom his knowledge and display his power amen that's what god is calling us to be surrendered vessels are you willing to be a surrendered vessel are you willing to humble yourself and say lord use me lord use me o god hallelujah oh the devil come to your mind but how god will use you you did this you did that you said that that's why he said don't you forget you're justified this outside man may continue even carrying on doing all kinds of stuff but inside here you're justified and just if i don't mean that you just get pardoned because if you pardon then you mean you did it but then if you say oh this no you are justified because the devil because he had something to do with this he start to manipulate it and then by the manipulations of this and all the things that did he start to condemn the man on the inside but that man on the inside never did not want thing wrong for the seed of god cannot commit sin it can't because it's the gene of god it's a part of god brother branham said it can't die no more god than god himself can die because it's a part of him revealed on the earth and they give you the earthly name your name my name they give it an earthly name just like they give jesus a earthly name that was just his earthly name but god had the name the real name is written on the book hallelujah amen your name is on the book hallelujah you say oh you know it your life is going to show it your life is going to display it and the things that are going to happen around you in you and through you even without your personally trying to work up anything it's just going to happen god is going to testify of his own gift that he placed inside you oh i'm going to go fast but 40 days to stir up this gift that's in me well that's good if god tell you to brother brown said i never prayed or fasted more than three days in my life amen why because you only do those if god tell you to do it is that right some weeks i i come up here i already ate my good solid breakfast and enjoy it praise god and another week god says no don't eat anything you deliver that word and then you come back and then you can go you see that's the way you don't just make up these things you allow god to have his way surrender to him unto him alone blessed be the name of the living god glory to god so what is your position amen hallelujah he's revealed himself to the church ages but now he's really not in the edges hallelujah he is now in the capstone praise god hallelujah amen if you got your bible or you can show them the quotation of zechariah 4 verses 6 to 7 hallelujah that tells us there about the head stone coming back crying grace grace grace how many remembers that beautiful scripture of zechariah 4 6 and 7. no of course it can't be a rock it can't be a a brick or a stone like we know it because the thing is speaking this is a headstone that's talking and it's crying up and saying grace grace grace hallelujah so the headstone got to be a person it's got to be a person that's talking to us glory to god hallelujah amen so the capstone is going to bring you a great revelation where you're going to realize this thing is not of works where any of us could boast but it's by the grace of almighty god that we are here this morning in the house of the living god not by our righteousness not by our works not by our wisdom not by our knowledge but by his grace alone that we are here oh my oh oh can i both oh i went to northwestern bible college oh yeah can i both oh i was in this bible school i was over here i got a doctor's divinity and people are necessarily given credibility to people based on their wealth based on their intelligence their mental acuity agility believers so-called are given credibility to people like this oh god blessing that brother he looks like he's really rich the hand of god is on that don't mean nothing god can use that to blind your eyes that you don't see the word amen you pass the beggar at the gate and the beggar might be the one with the word and the banker can be blind as a bat so you keep your eyes upon the lord jesus amen so the pentecostal the the capstone then we find out is a person did you get that the capstone crying grace is a person hallelujah the capstone is the present-day word of this hour because it's the fullness of the word that come through all the seven church ages and now it's come to its fullness at the confirmation of the ages is that right come to its fullness so it caps off everything all of them said way back there this caps all of it this is the capstone the present our word that we now and also the capstone also represents a people as every church age represented a certain elect people for that age that capstone represents a people now everything i'm saying here i welcome you to challenge it and search it in the bible in the message in the prophet and what he said right because i'm not here to give you uh proof to you anything those days of proving to you anything i remember those days when uh us preachers have to walk up to the platform some with a suitcase filled with books and you challenge them when they open that suitcase and then they'll pull out books over there and where they are you don't have to prove nothing i don't have to prove anything to you because if the holy spirit doesn't prove it to you and reveal it to you my my trying to do that is in vain and even if i did it it still wouldn't bring you in because he is the one who said i open the door and when i open the door to you no people can tell you oh you two wicked you can't come in you do this you can't pass him he opened the door he he opens he said when i opened the door hallelujah but when i shut it when i shut up your understanding when i blind your eyes there is no way you can't come in here amen or praise god forevermore hallelujah thank god when he knocked on my heart's door oh my god brother sister i was ready to follow him every step of the way amen glory to god i tell you in the name of the lord jesus christ hell man when i was just in my teenage and the message just came myself and then brothers talking about the lord out of them bushes come that great pillar of fire like that moving slowly and my uh uh people that just passed away were living just like where the house is and just run to them and say do you see anything oh my god what is that and just when it realized that they could see it it just moved from a standstill to hume into the heavens and was lost from sight i'm telling you brother sister he is the same yesterday today and forever and don't even think i'm mentioning that to put myself anywhere you see the pillar of fire so what the pillar of fire has been seen in jamaica many times brothers preaching their brother branham himself was alive then it was right over the over the uh woolen sack recorder while they're playing brother brady is preaching in his own daddy is doubting him while the daddy is doubting here comes the purifier behind him he don't know it's there it's passing the father runs up with his jacket to go block it and it just went and got even bigger of course he falled up and he had to lead him to christ but the fact is this we don't take those things like pentecostal do they get one healing and they print up a book and a magazine and they start a big ministry is that right one man cast out the devil in the philippines and he got a multi-million dollar ministry from but from constantly retelling the story of these demons that he cast out all my endless brothers in africa casting out devils every day it's commonplace to cast not devils every day i was teenaged and devils were being cast out every day it wasn't strange or different and everything else like that you see what i am trying to tell you here and maybe i'll touch on it later or where brother branham takes when the messenger is gone he says that take the message and they scruple it up and then take it into denomination amen they start to make money off of it use the message to make money to make uh build a personality build their private credibility to build themselves up instead of pointing people back to christ back to the narrow way i am nothing you are nothing none of us are anything we are resting on him and upon him alone glory to god i haven't even gotten to really touch on my gotten to my topic yet amen but i wanted you to know brother sister here listen oh my at the end page 128 of the seven seals at the end of the pentecostal church age we are supposed to receive according to the word as god has said our messenger which is brother branham to re that will take all those loose ends and reveal the whole secret of god for the rapturing of the church then brother branham uses that word then well you know the word then means just like when john said and after this because when you finish revelation 1 2 3 you go to revelation 4 it begins by john saying and after this right that is just as much as if he said then right this is what brother branham is saying here then amen hallelujah then there is coming fourth seven mysterious thunders hallelujah praise god let me tell you the whole secret the seven chart changes over the messenger comes at the end then seven mysterious thunders hallelujah praise god they might have heard the sound even during the church age but they understand what it was saying amen oh my then there is coming forth seven mysterious thunders that are not even written at all they're not even written at all now you're talking about people launching out in the deep because you got the written word and you can say like thomas except i see it in that bible my god except i could put my finger in the side i'm believing that unless i can see a direct quote from the prophet all right i'm believing that whatsoever we got a lot of thomases here today like that i don't mean here in the building but we i mean that in this age we got a lot of thomases like that even written in the bible i am not going to believe it amen especially that he says the bible itself tells you john don't write that when the seven thunders spoke or uttered their voice amen he says john don't write that because that part of the word is the unwritten word that is not to be studied and not to be an alliance debated that is to be revealed the only way you can get that is for it to be revealed so he said john don't write that whatsoever amen hallelujah i want to give you another quote here now think of it the second climax i talked about the other day is something coming forth now for the church what is it i don't know oh my i could stay on a bit but it will move on from me in other words if he doesn't deal with it right then the thought is going to just travel away so he said could it be that that is the mighty thunder oh my think of it the seventh angel caught up in a seventh constellation seventh period constellation the pyramid made in the form on the side and on top amen and it dropped down from eternity could that be the mystery of the seven thunders that will bring back the headstone to earth again oh my you know that pyramid was never capped and the headstone is yet to come the headstone has been rejected i told you what the headstone was and how the pentecostal rejected it not knowing they rejected it amen could it be my brothers that is in sirs is this the time page 46 to 48. you heard the tape the seven thunders amen hallelujah that is what time is it sir now he's referring back to that but that's when he's speaking in the seven seals on god hiding in simplicity amen and he said that tape on the seven thunders what time is it sir it happened the other day the time is at hand that time is at hand or church don't you wait any longer how do you know the rapture is not going on all the time how do you know it's not going on all the time first thing you know it will be passed one disappearing here there it'll be gone the first you know and then the judgment will strike the world oh my think of it think of it down in arizona maricopa valley a city called phoenix something breaks out there until the seventh thunders of revelation 10 not even wrote in the bible is being made manifested amen
