happy for that we give god glory and praise and honor and we worship him with all our hearts and our minds well today is not going to be a long service and sermon and all that i'm just going to talk with you right i don't have anything here i just have the little calendar of the places and things i've done and what happened a little bit of that happened the photographs and stuff are yet to be all processed before i can properly make a slide show that you will actually be able to see but for now you're just going to hear right we want to thank god for that and we want to give him all the glory amen how has everything been with you all is well oh what a message all is will no matter what happens around us all is well we want to thank god for that that all is real amen praise god well you know that we are all here to give glory to god this is not about me it's not about you it's not about anybody it's not about any celebrity message celebrity or not message celebrity it has nothing to do with that there is one person we come here to worship oh praise god hallelujah you can't see him with your eyes but the prophet said the one that you feel within your heart your sense he's on the scene that one one day become visible in front of you and will be caught away to be with the lord i believe we're living in that day i believe god's will and plan and purpose has been fulfilled i believe this is the harvest time i believe to redeem the gathering in wash like the snow and free from all sin not because they cleaned up themselves but the blood cleaned them up the holy spirit cleaned us up the bride has made herself ready oh praise god that doesn't mean religious works to make yourself ready but uh letting go and letting the holy spirit take a hold of your life amen in a mighty way praise god hallelujah i'm going to pray so let me know you know when you come into the presence of god with god's people and you sense the presence of god the great anointing of the holy spirit praise the lord it lifts you up like an eagle is lifted up by the air the wind just lifts you up and want to take you away praise the lord but for now i'm glad to see all the individual faces that are here praise the lord some of you look better than when i was when i was uh before i was here and i gone i came back your face looks fuller and better and everything else i thank god for that for the riches of his grace and of his mercy we want to read from us let me use a scripture and then i'll begin to tell you uh of what happened acts chapter 2 praise the lord god bless you brother amen acts chapter would i say 2 no no sir that's not it my mind is going already 15 verse 36 acts chapter 1 verse could you put that up and let's all read it together and some days after paul said unto barnabas let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of god for the purpose of that and see how they do amen and that was my purpose praise the lord let us pray our gracious heavenly father we thank you for the word of god we thank you for the blessed holy spirit we thank you lord and not that you're not here but lord won't you just draw near oh god so that not just my words talking but that you will testify that these things are the truth and they are according to your will purpose and plan we give you all the glory the honor and the praise father for you said if i be lifted up i'll draw all men unto myself in jesus name amen god bless you please be seated not that i am paul because paul is an individual and we're all individuals but in each age god calls men and put them in the service for his glory praise his name i want you to know that we took our flight not without a fight because at the last moment we understood we are supposed to have uh the covet test uh just to leave the country the the rules changing you know on the fly however um we found out that there was a little kiosk in the parking garage of the uh airport and so we rushed over there with a car with our car and we were able to take the test and pass the test and rush back to the airport and uh made or we true we thank god for that that even that he brought us safely through other than that of course we had at least four um covid injections right four vaccines so we were up to the hilt uh he couldn't want anything else we already had it and still we had to have the test uh but nevertheless we took it and um just to say the same thing happened when we were coming back and one brother who is not even a preacher or a pastor he called me out of the blue and said brother um the rules they go back and forth and if i were you you know i was thinking about you and i thinking about these tests when you're leaving the country i would take the test and it's better to be safe than sorry i said you're right brother and i'm gonna do it and i did it and when we arrived in guyana we took out the forms and the stuff on your phone to show them that we had the test and the officers said oh no no we don't need that but you see if i didn't have it these people don't understand if an ordinary person maybe there is this all right but a man of god with the holy spirit carrying the message the devil is going to make sure that if you have one thing out of place he's going to go right there he's going to zero in on it praise god but that was already covered so he couldn't touch it so they said oh just go on through so we came through at the cheddy jagen international airport i must say when i left there remember i the last time i was there is around 1995. praise the lord the visit that i made then and of course the country was run down houses old and broken some still are the roads were made basically red brick like in africa red brick road and when the rain falls is the puddles everywhere and uh stuff like that and when the a car or bus passes is clouds of dust you know inside and outside because you can lock your windows but somehow that dust comes in anyway so and that's why we used to walking to school coming home and everything else but anyway um they built a brand new airport and uh thanks to uh trinidadians like brother chris here their expertise in engineering and along with other international engineers they were able to build a very nice modern airport it's not all that they want or need at this time first of all let me give you this that the country is uh has been so backwards and under the colonial rule it's been was so exploited with all the sugar and the rice and the bauxite and the gold and the diamonds and everything else that uh when the british left there they left a revolution confusion and stuff like that but uh i can see it's it's working itself out because they left it in racial strife and they left it with all manner of uh problems and they're working things out i've seen the uh generations of the people there they're now seeming to meld together until uh when you say a guyanese you're not looking for an indian man or a black man or a chinese man because the whole pot seems to be molded together and what's coming out of that is somebody of mixed race that because we have whites we have chinese we have jews we have blacks we have indians we have the amerindians which are the indians that were originally there and it's all mixed and mixing together right now and that's what's emerging it's a hot country right a hot country it gets a bit cool when it comes down to winter here then it's cool over there but when i say cool not you're cool it's a different cool you will call that cool hot but it's cool for them and they enjoyed it and we enjoyed it because we went at the right time right we went at the right time because now the rainy season has started you don't understand that because you got just the winter and the summer and the fall and so on but there's rainy season that's taking place there now the very day i left the rainy season started and torrential rains begin to fall not the little rains that we have here spitting a little bit and you just walk through now the wind is blowing and the rain is really coming down in torrents right like that uh so it's a hot country like that however what has brought about a lot of this change is not only time but oil has been discovered and that oil is now being exploited or let's use a word developed by many countries many nations are there france america britain israel go down the line they're all rushing in there to have their platform off the shore to pull that oil out and to sell it because um and they want to do it fast because you know with climate change fossil oils are going to go the way of the dodo bird and so they are doing their best and because of that it's provided so many jobs for the local population there and everything you hear is oil offshore and this they're working like that and then as that as the people of some of the people are working it brings an infusion of more cash into the society and as a result you're seeing modern buildings starting to go up more and more um major chains of like hotels like i stayed at the marriott uh that they built they had nothing like that you know nothing whatsoever uh you would call that when i left there like mom-and-pop places that you could stay in but now there's a marriott and when i left the hyatt already broke ground and they're hurrying now because they got to get in there fast who gets there first and fast can establish themselves and the hotels don't hardly have space and the reason why investors is one of the few countries in the world that's still left with forests and areas and environments where nobody has ever tried and there's still stuff to be discovered because you can like i said uh there's gold there where sometimes in the streams they can find it not in the city out in the wild they can find it diamonds the bauxite and caroline and rare earth that they use for the computers it's all there and right now they're not paying too much mind to that they're looking at the oil but there's other people in are quietly going into those things so the hotels are all filled up and there's a need for new hotels sleep in all these little chains and all are hurrying over there and building and locals are who have money are building their own big hotels and encouraging people to go and still they are all filled up why investors are pouring in investors whether it's dubai whether it's america whether it's canada or whether i met some canadians over there from bc by the way and uh and there it is they're just pouring in filling up and trying to get their money invested saudi arabia you know saudi arabia they just came and talked to the government we want to do all the roads in the country we don't care how many billions we want to do all the roads and this one wants to do this brazil as you know brazil can break their goods they have to come down to the bottom of south america and go around to get over to bring their goods to america and to wherever else they want to export it but now they're talking about cutting a road from brazil because we are just neighbors to them and people are already driving on a dirt road to go there and back but they want to develop that road and bring it right to to the major coast and they want to put a deep sea port where great ships and cruise ships can come in on the coastline understand also the capital city built from since well eighteen hundreds or before it was built and you know the dutch had it the french had it the british had it it changed the hands so many times and so the villages have french names some villages have dutch names some have british names it's like that and also it was built three feet below sea level so the dutch were able and you know they're good at that they place great sea walls um on the at the on the coast of the country with sluices and stuff like that which some of the old ones are still there still working and they're trying to hold it back but the united nations already told them the whole capital is going under the sea by 2013. 30 in about eight years time it's supposed to go under right now the rain falls about 20 25 minutes uh half an hour and the capital because they you close the sluices so that the ocean water can't come in then these torrential rains are falling and so behind the sluices are filling up with water and they're ending up with floods floods so that's something that they're talking about moving the capital to a higher ground a higher part of the country and of course that doesn't take a lot of money but now they're having that money starting to pour in uh and i'm sure they'll be able to accomplish it and so we arrived at the chatty jagen airport and we we were transported by brother maxi lee which is the son of a chinese preacher he was a presbyter official over the assemblies of god denomination but after hearing the message uh this at that time 18 year old uh bringing the message receiving it and bringing it um himself and many other ministers received the word and pulled their churches out of the denomination and this young man not young in the sense that he is about 50 something now but um he is the son of that minister praise the lord and he received us and brought us we were so tired right that it brought us to our hotels that night and we slept like a top i didn't dream i just slept and the next day when uh we got uh we woke up praise the lord he allowed us to sleep as late as we wanted and then he picked us up and took us to his home where we had lunch with the family and that was a local feast right a lot of things we didn't see a lot of the fruits and natural fruits and they eat a lot of natural things amen because you know we live here in the north and with the snow and all that our growing season is short there they have fish everywhere they have meat everywhere and the reason for that is just the country is just so bountiful in the sense that the ditches even have fish the people don't even bother with those they get the ones from the sea but if you water is in your ditch next thing the fish is in there you have a pond in the backyard before you know it it's full of fish so you know so there's fish there so uh we want to thank the lord for that we had a glorious um feast with them and they eat a lot organic because they don't have to freeze meat and freeze fish except for a few days keeping it in their freezer but up here we have to freeze it and keep it for months whatever right that's the way we have to live but they have it there every day fresh and they're able to eat it that way praise god and the fruits beautiful the pine is not half green and then when they send it here then it gets ripe or then they force it to get ripe with a gas no this is right right off of when you pick it from the tree right like that the fruits are all fresh so we enjoyed it and the juices ah you know they have the store bought juices but they're making the juices right there and by the way we we should use bottled water every step of the way and uh so all those juices were made with bottled water so that we don't get sick and they're very careful of that that you use it but bottled water i went one place i have to tell you this joke and i was offered a juice but that was okay because made with bottled water but there was ice placed into it and i just wonder i said my i hope this ice is made with the local water so i grabbed the drink and i i drank it off right away before the ice could melt [Laughter] and brother lee is sitting there and he's just smiling he said brother i know why you did that she said but you don't have to worry even the ice was made with bottled water i said well brother i was just making sure anyway we had lunch with them and we stayed there the entire day fellowshipping with them talking with him he getting to know me i'm getting to know him and his family and just to find that this brother has caught the same revelation that we have right here right now and i mean it's caught in a deep way not just skin deep but he's caught the revelation of the fullness of the word of god and uh not let's say not waiting for me just to talk to him but he's talking and what he's talking is lying right up with the word uh and then as he begins to talk to me then i understood why god took me from there and then he was explaining to me his understanding of what god was showing to him that i left and when i left and came out i thought i was just thinking of me but he said no all the other original ministers that were there some died and the other ones all came out up to your left and just this new young generation had to grow up with the word alone so they're not coming with any pattern from me they're not coming from any influence from me they're not come they just come with the influence of the word and because of that coming up in the purity of the word of god there come forth a generation stronger revelation understanding the word in a great marvelous wonderful way and i want to thank god for that and give god glory the funny thing about it is not just this brother but going uh uh meeting some of the other ministers we had a lunch and some came in all couldn't come because they had the storms and rain but uh they all caught the revelation of this last prophet's message not just caught the message but the revelation of that message amen and i praise god to see it spread a country wide among the believers and around the preachers of the word of god hallelujah i thank god for that amen so i give god praise hallelujah amen i thank god that on that the next day also i received a surprise visitor came up with another bike and that was a chinese brother whose family was converted at that time uh brother duncan hing and he's the one that i always tell you the old church-age book that i teach out of he has his writing on it that he's presented it to me well you know before i left the country and i've been using that ever since and he was so excited i came he came to visit me so we made arrangements that we're going to visit himself and his sister his sister that was converted was a school mate of my wife and uh they always were very close back there and talking with each other and was a real blessing uh later on to go and visit with them i thank god for that that we're able to go and visit with them later on praise the lord now they usually have a midweek prayer meeting that's on a wednesday night and since i just came and it was a wednesday night and a brother desiring for me to speak on a sunday i just said a few words at the prayer meeting but it was wonderful their prayer meeting was wonderful to be there or with them in a wonderful way god bless it and bless them in a marvelous and wonderful way thank god what a blessing brother and then we met with them on sunday to preach the word of god there praise the lord and ministered god's word so we ministered on the from the dust to the stars how god said to abraham that i'll make your children like the dust they'll number less like the dust then after that he gave him a promise that uh they're going to be more than the stars forever amen hallelujah so we took the thought of god raising us all up out of the mirror clear the dust and taking us right back to the heavenly places uh to be the morning stars that shouted around the throne of god and that sort of thing and they were shouting to and praising god hallelujah and we had a wonderful glorious time i couldn't finish of course but we had a glorious time around the word of god amen and we want to thank god for that hallelujah and there i was able to meet um brother peter this is another brother peter not the one we knew over here he's already dead and gone so this is not a reincarnation this is another brother peter he's an indian brother i told you about a place where um we went to testify and this muhammadan gentleman and we talked about brother branham and his message he said brother branham he said you believe prophet branham what prophet how you know about brother branham then he tells the story how he went to throughout his garbage and we had given out books in that area and he found one in the in the garbage can and he didn't know who put it there he took it out he read it and he got converted from islam to christ hallelujah and this man was his son that came to the service praise the lord and the beautiful thing is there is a church right there in that village to this day there's a church that's going on there now when i left it was just him and his son and his wife but now there's a church there and we give god praise [Applause] i want to praise god for that what a blessing and there i met also a couple of people that knew me from way back then i met the son of some of the sisters the sons of some of the sisters daughters of some of the sisters and brothers that were back there that have now gone on to be with the lord yes brothers no matter how we are how durable we are one by one they gain the portals there to dwell with the immortals when they ring them golden bells for you and me yes they crossed over but they left behind them a legacy of faith may you also when you cross leave a legacy of faith in the hearts of your children your family and all those around you if they have nothing else the riches of christ planted within their soul that's the treasure above all that they can ever have thank god then brother maxie with his vehicle took us over onto the west coast of the country and there we went by the grace of god and visited on that in that part of the country and showing him another convert that was there one from a whole village and now i've gone back there is a church there functioning by the grace of god praise the lord he passed away just about a year ago or so he's gone on and right now they're in between of uh playing tapes and a new pastor and that and just yesterday um you know stuff has been made for some contact with me so that i can give some advice or say something whatever god will lead but that's happening also we give god the glory because there's a church there and we give god praise and honor um for that praise god even the essence of god benefit because from this the the town where my wife was converted in and um you know some of the land that the british had given me to build at 18 years old a big building and the denominations took it because he's young we can handle it and they took it in their name and kept it well they do have a church there now not on that spot they had to go by their own but they have a church there now uh in that city also so we thank the lord that our work was not in vain and we give him the glory i didn't go to the eastern part of the country i understand their church is there too but i didn't go to that eastern part of the country praise god of course i couldn't go to every church because brothers and sisters it's amazing brother maxilisa's brother i don't know fully how many churches there are now from off of your the word because that's what they wanted to know they wanted to know how did the message start how did it flow out and then i went down there to find out that a lot of myths and fantastic stories were being told of how the message started how it started under an old oak tree oh my goodness and things of that nature what i said no no no no no and then i had to recount to them how the old minor prophet before brother branham we didn't know anything about brother branham but this old short heavyset man uh believed and was teaching already in the name of jesus christ baptizing in jesus name and against denomination never joined one of them and believed in one god so obviously when the message came to the country it went to him because all the denominations recognized him they knew something was going on so it went to him but he had a a bible i guess the size of my portfolio this size and thick like that so um he could read but slow and picking here and picking there so because i prayed with him i used to pray with him he would ask me to read certain things for him so when those books came and then i went through the story telling them how brother ro came there and the denominations tried to lock him up in their minister's conference and god made him get so thirsty and they had put this old preacher to be the cook and he got so thirsty all of a sudden he goes to the kitchen to get a drink of water and while he's getting the drink of water he says well thank god there's only one god and i believe him and brother said amen brother praise god he said no baptism is amen so he's taken back he's not getting a chance to testify because this person is amen everything so he just ran back to his briefcase because if he took too long talking to the brother they're gonna come to see what he's doing why he's taking so long just to get a drink of water so he just cut the two box go back hand it to the brother run back to his seat and the next morning he had to fly out to the country and so the brother took those two books and of course i explained to them how i was in assemblies of god uh what happened in new amsterdam the revival that broke out there the church is still there uh 2500 people i was just a young teenager and that was happening so they gave me a scholarship and this was the third year i was in and they stuck the book stuck under the door and read the books and all my all the things come tumbling down all the ambitions right so i said i had to cast down my crown like the 24 elders and of course i applied it to them i said you need to cast them all your crowns not that you don't need to be educated but you can have your wall plastered with degrees and you're depending on that nah you you forget that and like paul put your mind on jesus christ so um i explained to them how it all started it wasn't on the new oak tree i i gave them the entire history of how when the message started when it i first alone had it and started to share it in the bible school and it broke another little revival fire in there where young ministers came out young women came out and so on like that and ministers all the ministers that were officials in there came out praise god and the word started to take off and we thank god for that but i was already out of the assemblies of god the church that i was preaching at in my wife's tongue and we had nowhere to go because we were put out and we wonder where we're gonna go we found an old garage that was covered with weeds and we asked the owner if we can have it to use even if we have to pay a small steep end and he said no you can have it well sure he wanted us to have it it was next door to a liquor house we call it a spirit house that's actually what it is but that's the spirit shop all kinds of spirits in there because while i was preaching they were commenting it's not like hair you know it's not like here the people are hot blooded and they're reacting everything else so i'm preaching and what are you talking about you know they say oh so everybody knows the bible claim to know the bible so and and then not only that brother if it was that alone it was okay but you're preaching at whom it's the it's the whiskey or the rum bottle went by your head so you better be under the holy spirit to protect you and then conquer you're there's bricks on on the zinc sheet above your head praise god so your the people had to really believe or they wouldn't even come back and i'm telling you we hail to god's unchanging hand because we believe the prophet of this hour praise god behold to god's word and that night myself and about four of the brothers uh while i mentioned that let me mention one of those brothers that was with me there brother chapman uh we used to you know we get we have names we call one another we used to call him the scientists because natural things he knows this he knows that you know so he's a scientist but brother chapman he went to the extreme end of the country towards the west through the jungles and all that with this message and preached it there in a city called let them now a city well then it was just a little village and started the church there and to my surprise it continued and he died his son is carrying it on and the church is there growing by the grace of god hallelujah and right now the the brother lee is thinking of of uh growing and expanding the building and the whole thing that's going on there now for god's glory and praise because some people even from brazil next door you know want to come and visit and preach and pray and fellowship by god's grace but let me say this to you i'm i'm just talking right so don't forget me if i don't keep a logical sequential way of speaking but um from from the five churches that were left there now he says brother i don't know how many there are i can we only count as far as i know 36 that we know of right now and there are others out there that we may not be aware of praise the lord those of you look brothers you know how i felt from five to 36 and counting i give god the praise and the honor and the glory [Applause] for he's the same yesterday today and whatever praise be to god hallelujah oh we came back from that uh visit and then by the grace of god the brother said he would take me towards the western part of the country and part of that will be on the edge of starting to go to the jungle just the edge right because i told him i said no brother i am not able anymore to go into these uh you know jungle parts there and boat turn over and swimming in the middle of the night and all these things like that you know i've been through that already and i'm not going to go through it again i'm not able to go through it again so um he just took me on the edge of or the jungle and we praise god for that i'll show you some of the pictures uh later on after we have them all set up but god to god's glory uh i'll show you the crossing because we cross the asiquibo river that river is 22 miles wide not two miles 22 miles in that river there are islands larger than some of the islands in the west indies right in that river and uh we thank god and people are living on them they're occupied and people are living on them thousands of people living on them but he took me to the actual coast on the other side of that river and you have to go into a ferry a large ferry and thank god for the chinese because they couldn't buy some of the ships and ferries that was offered by some of the other countries but the chinese were able to build a big ferry at a very good price and they're smart down there they took out the engines that might have broken down and weren't so good and they put in diesel engines from what one of the companies that we know one of these british companies anyway but they put in reliable diesel uh engines in there and that ferry takes a whole bunch of cars i can't remember how many if it's 50 or 40 cars and passengers and everything else and we were able to cross that so it's not a little boat like they used to do years ago and you pop up and you're going along like that now this is a big fairy praise god and sister simon wouldn't go on it unless it was a big ferry [Laughter] anyway we made it over the other side and there uh we were introduced to some brethren to their home and we had lunch there it was wonderful to have lunch with them uh jenny and i call the brother big john because i'm little john and he is big john so we had a wonderful time of fellowship with them recounting old stories and sharing things and um eating a lot of uh these were indian people but so we had a lot of indian fare that we were partaking of you know um dal puri and dal and curry and you know chicken and whatnot we enjoyed it all praise the lord i don't want to have you slobbering on leave the service halfway out to to go get some of that but anyway we enjoyed it and we had a wonderful time that night we're going to service well i thought the service would be on the main road the nice building and everything else but no i told you he was taking me to the edge of the jungle he just took me we went off and we took a dirt road and this dirt road in the pitch black there are no lights shining and he said but occasionally you see the jaguars in the light in crossing road or the deer or they will see a gootie or whatever animals crossing the road and some of the people walk he gave these people a lift in his vehicle to go to the church and the church is about two miles down that road and they walk in that pitch black to go to the church to have fellowship brethren you see how much god has blessed us how much we can enjoy that we can just go into our car start it up and drive and complain that is that right we try to complain they're walking for two miles in the pitch black wild animals are there you understand when i said wild animals not i just mentioned a jaguar let me not talk about the snakes because we have the snakes from the size this fat and 30 feet long down to the small tiny ones that are poisonous deadly and in the dark you can't see where you're walking what you're doing or anything you're going by faith not just singing faith but real faith amen you really have to depend on god to protect you [Music] right so to a certain degree this doesn't make not american believers any less because your faith is being exercised in a different way on the different culture in a different condition but under that culture and those things they have to have that kind of faith you know some of those brothers tell me about being bitten several times by poisonous snake and no hospital and and and praise god they're still living amen well you get bitten by a snake you get less than that and first thing you think let me run to the hospital or some dead see but the first their first thought is to look to god above who said by his stripes you are healed hey man it's not that you you see let me let me say that again it's not that you don't believe that you believe it but you are under a different culture you don't have to believe it like them because they got to face it like that every day of course not the christians in the city there because they they're in the city they don't see that um that sort of thing but anyway he took us down this dirt road for about two miles and then we came to this building you know covered with the zinc and uh around it uh walls that are about five feet high and the rest of it is just poles and holding it up and they are looking to uh build up there a building there now to house all the people we praise god for it and be able to preach the word of god to them at that point in time and again the lord blessed them in a wonderful way we had a great meeting late in the night and we give god glory and they rejoice singing their way home uh those who are the few cars they came down that dirt road they didn't care how much the car go bump whatever they came and those who had to walk walk walked home and everything else but the word was preached and i thank god there's a church there in the wild woods the church there and they're praising god and every time i see one of these churches the holy spirit is reminding me all this came because one day when you were just a young boy those two books came to you you don't know anything about this while you were in north america all this was going on and now they are everywhere and the denominations are getting mad because it's spreading praise god and even the my schoolmate or college mate there is now the superintendent of the denomination he's saying all these young boys coming from nowhere and starting up these churches he's getting they're getting mad you know but the word is spreading praise the lord hallelujah praise god satan is sad but god is glad we're rejoicing in the lord and praising him for the great things that he has done and uh we rejoice on that we stayed in a lodge maria's lodge is called uh overnight and that's not like your nice sumptuous hotels you can have here you know you're safe because this was not out in the open you had doors and windows but you know you have to deal with your mosquitoes your lizards your flies and stuff you got to deal with it you're in that situation there are not things that will harm you you know mosquito nets are there so you use them the best you can and what you're doing missions is not just oh i'm going over to michigan that's nice you go over there to a hotel and you preach and everything else and you say you're on a missionary trip that's not real missionary trip where you can roll to the store and buy chocolates and right but god has given this young man and his family a vision a vision for the country a vision for the message and as a result god allowed him to buy a large plot of land on the shores of what is called a hot and cold lake where all the scientists are going there now investigating because they don't understand why half the lake is hot and half is cold half is cold water and half is hot and they don't know what what is going on so they're looking at it but god allowed him to buy a lot of land there and spent a lot of money a lot of help from the believers and they uh put up a large building one level building and turned that into a campground and there's also a little church building that is on the site there and god has blessed it so much that brethren are coming from the islands brother green brother for long your brother brother mohammed and many others even from the united states they are going to that place that are just about four miles in the bush and they're having camp meetings and believers are even coming from brazil from africa ahem here and they're going there and having a real camp meeting taking their tents and putting them on the ground there and a brethren that live in those areas they patrol in the night and stuff like that and uh so far everybody's been safe nobody's had any problem and they're on the shores of the lake and during the day they may go boating or fishing or whatever it's all there and this is a big huge lake that they're on praise god so i want to say thank god for this dear brother and how the lord is using him in a wonderful way that way and i just say praise god i see the same spirit that is on him on me and i thank god for that giving him the god the glory and when he was driving back you know you know same thing same attitude hey hi how you doing over there hello what you know just the same happy go lucky you don't know when god looked in the door two guys going in down the jungle trail to go to work and hey how you guys you're going in the world yeah you say oh jump in the back get in there and they jump in the back and then drive them to another little trail they have to walk down that and let them out there but it's like that so everywhere i went around the country with him i didn't go to the east but this middle part and the western part it seems like most everybody knows him right they know him and so if create the holy spirit has got a great influence going on within the country for god's glory and that's because of the example of his uh family his girls right he has one boy and about four girls max a matter of fact one of them is married and she just gave birth to a son just before i left and we give god the praise for that and the other ones when i left the night we left he dropped us off and left us there about 10 o'clock in the night to wake up with another brother and to drive with his daughters insisting to go with him to drive to go to brazil and to do that they have to drive 300 miles through the jungle to get to brazil amen and you know um you know brother brian you know you break down in the middle of the jungle there is no gas station and then you have to think about what is around you while you say you're going to walk somewhere to go and get help so but they they made it through i phoned and found out that they made it through safely and the brother is doing a convention there and the young ladies are very useful in the youth meetings they have up there and it's a real blessing praise the lord hallelujah oh i wish i could have a big plane and air lift you all over there for a week or so amen so that you could experience and enjoy what god is doing praise the lord because it changes lives it changes hearts changes minds when people actually see what god is doing amen and i give god the glory so we enjoyed that and we came out there the next day but not before he made sure that we were able to drink some coconuts how many knows what the coconut is well no there's many people don't know what a coconut is but these are fresh water coconuts and these brothers are wiser than we were because back then we climbed the tree to pick the coconuts and sometimes when you climb the tree a big head comes out and then you loose off down the tree and you end up with the inside of your ties all bruised up and bleedy nah now they have a long stick with a steel curvature where they can just reach up and cut that thing saw it off and then bang the whole bunch falls off i said my you brothers got it different you you got a new way of doing things but we enjoy those coconuts not only were they fresh the water in them was sweet not only was the water sweet it was a lot and when you cut them up then you have the meat that you have to eat out of there oh my if you don't want some of that now i'm not talking about running to the supermarket those ones won't taste the same but we enjoyed them and we drank or filled and then we made our way out for four miles made our way out now because of him going there you remember brother biscuit out in western canada how he went in the woods and built that locked cabin and had his church in the log cabin then the holy spirit said go into this area buy land there and build a church there he went into that area when it was just bushes and nothing and built it what are you doing he says god told me to go there and he goes there and you know there's a tongue there now for and when i see a tongue another ramshackle it's got everything modern everything built up there now and the real estate agents that were kind of laughing at him they are they were left in amazement and in wonder but that's what happens when a man obeys god and god's word and so the government of guyana are now looking to develop a tourist site by the same by the lake but he's already there he's already there praise god and he wants to expand to get even more and right now they're hemming and hoing and stopping trying to block him from getting more of the land around there because now they get an idea and they get their thoughts and without any development anything there they're starting to charge people fees to go through all those woods and to go in there to this hot and cold lake and believe you me eco tourists are going there they're going it with their backpacks and everything else they're going in so i'm saying god gives that young man great vision amen and he's using him in a wonderful way and i want to support that and i want you to want to support that praise god and i'm going to start doing that i haven't told him this he didn't ask me for anything he didn't even hit about nothing because he believes that you have faith in god god will make a way somehow and god has been making a way praise the lord and just to let you know also personally he's not exactly poor right uh he is reasonably well off and well taken care of so um it's not uh because god would let some preachers be just normal and don't hardly have anything and others he'd allow them to prosper and and i believe he's one that god has allowed the prosper praise god amen and god god bless him in every way but i am going to support what he's doing and it's not just what he's doing is my work that is going on there still i am not there anymore because god didn't want him to be in my mold just like he told me with another preacher are you going to every seed bring forth after the sky and are you going to be his kind or mine and i had to say yes lord so it's the same thing he did but i didn't know he didn't want them to be after my kind but after his kind of the word so great work is still being done and it's going on still at the present time and i believe these brothers and trinidad recognize it and that's why they do a lot of fellowship with that brother for instance brother greene went to england and who does he left leave he called the brother from guyana to go over there and take his church and stay there until he comes back praise the lord so that's the kind of confidence that they have in that dear brother and we praise god so let's do what we can to carry along the work because they're churches to be built they're there but they don't have any they have a building in the sense that they have a roof over them and a few sticks or and tins and stuff like that and uh but we will do what we can for the glory of god hallelujah so i enjoyed this equivalent and then coming back we crossed the asakubo river and when we came back to demerara which is the middle province like of the country he said oh let's stop into brother kusanat and we stopped him there and lo and behold when i was young i preached in that village parika and people were converted and a little group was there and i never i left i don't know what ever happened to it but thanks be to god there is a message church right there right now and there is a solid pastor right there right now and he's also a businessman he's a big businessman and he is there and thanks be to god the church is coming along in a wonderful precious way and we give god glory because you see i just kind of take a quick review of what was going on there so if i go back then i know i can go and preach here i can preach there i can preach there i can breach there and bridge there and they need me there then i can go there like this one church the pastor is dead they don't know what to do and so on like that you know i don't know if whether to speak with them over zoom or if they need for me to go whatever the case i am in god's hand for his glory and that is a wonderful wonderful thing to know so we came back to the capitol and there in the capital of course you're not going to begrudge me a day off because uh sister simon's um nieces and a brother she has over there one brother left there over there uh they all came to see her and want to take her out and i said okay you go ahead and i went with the brother and i went to the mall and thank god again god they they used trinidadian engineers because trinidad had a lot of big malls that they so they brought them over and they built a few malls over there and i went to see what it was about and um you know it's not up to our standards but it's wonderful wonderful huge food courts with uh local fare and everything you have here too because in your kfc and popeye and the swim bees and pizza pizza and whatnot it's there you know it's a city so they're pulling in all these companies are looking to rush in and to set down themselves there so there and the dressing of the people when i left there no women wore pants you will look dung upon if you wear a pair of pants i go back and the society dresses no different than here all the modern stuff you got on they got it all the cars you drive here they got it from the low end ones right up to the jaguars and the audis and the lexus and the rovers and the highlanders and whatever they got it right and they're dressing the same with the caps and the this and the that and sneakers and the you know all the same thing it's gone in the sense that sin the wave of sin the prophet spoke of is across the world and it's touching everywhere and i need this gospel this all-time gospel that we are here preaching praise the name of the lord glory to god and for myself um i i'll have to go back i guess visit them i visited at the last minute on the saturday i found out that a grand niece of mine a cousin of mine her daughter um she had just a little let's say a stall we call it by the side of the road and to my surprise when i heard about them i said let me go visit them i'm thinking i'm going back to a little stall those girls develop that until they have two stores and she said oh but these ones are small but i have a large one on the other side of the river from that little stall from that little lady wanted to do something with her life these two girls were able to develop free stores and i want to give god praise honor and glory [Applause] amen well we had to we took the last day to pack and prepare to leave and i'm leaving out something important but i won't tell you about that we went to one of the large chinese restaurants in the city there and it's um when i say it's large it's huge um and we had a wonderful time in there with all the wonderful chinese delicacies and stuff of that nature in there we enjoyed that so much we give god the praise honor and glory so we spent the last day preparing to leave packing and stuff like that and then um you know next day was sunday saturday we made sure that we prepared and i'm i'm wrapping this up now so that when we go to the service we preach the word we already signed out from the hotel so we can't go back there unless you want to go paying marriott fees but uh we went to brother maxi's home and there we are able to you know shower change and prepare for the night but since service the ser he starts service at nine o'clock in the morning on sunday so by by um let's say 11 o'clock or midday services ended so we have midday and we were leaving at about um nine o'clock in the night so we had the rest of the day so we had time to have lunch with them again fellowship with them again have a little rest and stuff like that and then he took us to um to the airport and we were off and then he came home and packed his bags jumped in his vehicle 4 30 the next morning drove for 300 miles with his four girls and a brother that's driving with them and went into brazil where they still are now ministering by the grace of god and i think that's a tribute to the work god is doing in that country and now i want to repeat what i've always said god is up to something big hallelujah god is up to something big and i want to be a part of it he wants us to be york fellows fellow laborers carrying the gospel of jesus christ god bless you all i trust that somehow you've drawn something from what you heard by the grace of god of course i told them about the appearance of the pillar of fire amen praise the lord how in that old garage one night we are sad and worried about what's gonna happen and you know you know we don't know about no message we never thought i never thought i would be out here we don't know what's going on he never heard of any such a thing but then there came the light out of the bushes moving and i explained to them i would move like that right in front of us when i say in front of us it was just like about four feet away as moving slow like that and then it started going up a bit and i had enough time to run and knock on the door of my aunt's house at around midnight because we were out there talking on the word and just enjoying the presence of the lord and they weren't in the message and i said i don't want us to imagine so i'm going to call them and if they can see it then it's real it's not a makeup and knocked on the door and they came out and then it said why are you waking us up what's that boy what is that boy what what's what's that i said well i wanted to know if you can see it and they could see it and when he or it was sure it suddenly went from that slow moving and went up in the heavens and they were left staring in amazement of what took place so i explained all of that to them explain to them how the prayer meeting on in in uh in a certain area there and the clouds come down and we're hanging there and the fire engines and everything i think the place is on fire and they come to out but it wasn't it was the holy spirit in divine power and presence just doing that so i explained to them these things that god vindicated and confirmed and still is confirming the message for this hour but i said brothers god is using you guys in a different way but you see men like myself and these other older brothers god used us as bulldozers they started laughing i said yeah because a lot of rough old trees were clogging up the forest where he wants to plant his seed so he used us to rip them out tear them down and cast them out amen but now he's using you guys like surgeons you guys are now playing men that can play in a piece of board and make it smooth you know and using you in a different way so i said just press on let god continue to use you amen we thank god for this heavenly father we thank you for these few words we shared with the brethren and lord it may appear as if it's not much nothing but lord for them to know the the sense of fulfillment the sense uh a knowledge of rewards of the your efforts through me touching the hearts and lives of many who long to see my face having heard the name but not seen the individual thank you lord thank you for allowing my name to be associated with you and with the great work you are doing we bless your name in jesus name while the musicians and worship leaders come let's sing that old one brother if you don't mind send the light hallelujah and that's how i feel we need to send the light especially knowing that we have somebody that we can have confidence in taking the word of god hallelujah [Applause] yes there's a call come what's not in here do you have words for that bro okay let's sing that how many of you know that amen praise god many of the young
