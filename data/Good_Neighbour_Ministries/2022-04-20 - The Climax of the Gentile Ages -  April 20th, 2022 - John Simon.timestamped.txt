[16:47] and bless us together as we gather in
[16:50] his name
[16:51] we thank god for every one of you and

[16:57] with us
[16:58] may you enjoy his presence
[17:01] and may the lord bless every one of us
[17:03] together
[17:04] now tonight we are
[17:07] in the subject of
[17:10] the climax of the gentile
[17:13] ages
[17:15] and
[17:16] revelation chapter
[17:19] 3 of course we'll touch on that
[17:23] praise the lord
[17:32] 3 11 and 12
[17:36] 12 13
[17:37] behold i come quickly
[17:41] hold that fast which thou hast
[17:46] that no man take thy crown
[17:50] him that overcome it
[17:53] will i make a pillar in the temple
[17:57] of my god and he shall go no more out
[18:04] and i will write upon him
[18:07] the name of my god
[18:10] and the name of the city
[18:13] of my god which is
[18:16] new
[18:17] jerusalem
[18:18] which cometh down
[18:21] out of heaven
[18:23] from my god
[18:25] and i will write upon him
[18:28] my new name
[18:30] he that had an ear to hear
[18:33] let him hear what the spirit said unto
[18:37] the churches
[18:38] let us pray
[18:40] great holy spirit
[18:43] we pray father that you will come upon
[18:47] us
[18:49] bless every one of us gathered here
[18:52] tonight
[18:53] in your divine presence
[18:56] it is our request
[18:59] that you draw near to us
[19:03] may your spirit
[19:05] rest
[19:06] settle
[19:08] above us
[19:09] like the pillar of fire did
[19:12] over the tabernacle
[19:15] that was in israel
[19:17] now we are here
[19:19] as living tabernacles
[19:22] may nice great spirit
[19:25] overshadow us bless us and quicken the
[19:28] word quicken our understanding warm our
[19:32] hearts in thy presence father and to
[19:35] thee we give all the glory
[19:38] the honor and the praise
[19:40] amen and amen god bless you please be
[19:43] seated where you are
[19:47] now
[19:48] of course laodicea is the last of the
[19:52] seven church ages which we began
[19:55] and as you know it began with the
[19:58] ephesian
[20:00] church age of course but it's the
[20:03] diagram is right behind me so you can
[20:06] see everything up there
[20:09] but everything
[20:11] that has been happening during these
[20:13] seven church ages
[20:16] are now coming to a fruition
[20:20] all the seeds
[20:22] of good
[20:23] and of evil
[20:25] that were planted
[20:27] from the very beginning
[20:29] have now grown through the ages
[20:32] and are coming to their harvest time
[20:37] now
[20:38] we know that both vines
[20:41] will yield their final fruit
[20:45] good
[20:46] or evil but they will all bear their
[20:50] final fruit whatever
[20:53] and of course
[20:55] their end will come
[20:58] at their destination
[21:01] because one will be caught up
[21:04] in the presence of god
[21:06] and the other one
[21:09] their destination
[21:11] is to
[21:12] the pits of hell
[21:14] destruction
[21:17] the sowing
[21:19] the planting the sowing the watering
[21:23] the growing of those seeds have all been
[21:26] taking place during the
[21:28] ages god using not farmers but different
[21:33] preachers
[21:34] and teachers
[21:36] to plant the seed within the heart of
[21:39] believers
[21:40] that would believe it and receive it
[21:43] with all their hearts
[21:45] but
[21:46] you see now we've come to the time when
[21:50] the summer is ended
[21:53] autumn is here
[21:55] it's the time for the grain to be
[21:57] gathered in
[21:59] into the
[22:00] garner and the barns
[22:03] and the spirit of god in this time
[22:07] it's a time
[22:08] when the redeemed are gathering in
[22:11] wash like the snow
[22:13] and free from all sin
[22:16] god's spirit
[22:18] is drawing his people
[22:21] back to his word
[22:23] back to his presence
[22:25] there might know him remember god is a
[22:28] spirit
[22:31] so when we say know him
[22:34] come in contact with him we can't yet
[22:37] see him with our eyes but we can sense
[22:41] him
[22:42] by our spirit our soul that is within us
[22:47] amen because remember you already have
[22:50] those senses we have built like god god
[22:53] said
[22:54] they're in my image right
[22:57] so as i've said to you before even if
[23:00] your back is turned
[23:02] and somebody came and stood behind you
[23:05] you're going to say oh
[23:07] you felt somebody standing behind you
[23:10] you sense somebody standing beside but
[23:14] that person hasn't touched you how did
[23:17] you feel it you did not feel with your
[23:19] hand or your feet but your felt with
[23:22] your soul on the inside it could sense
[23:25] the presence of something unseen behind
[23:30] praise god well god is a spirit
[23:33] how are you going to know when he's near
[23:35] you
[23:36] because you come into a service like
[23:38] this
[23:39] and then you you sense the presence of
[23:42] god
[23:43] the holy spirit begins to draw near to
[23:46] us
[23:47] the word of god begins to embrace our
[23:50] hearts and our minds and begin to reveal
[23:53] himself to us
[23:54] and we begin to recognize that the lord
[23:57] is nigh the lord is near
[24:01] amen yes sir praise god
[24:04] so we are faced
[24:06] with the false church
[24:09] and with the true church
[24:13] and its harvest time
[24:15] as we have said
[24:19] now when we read in the book of
[24:21] revelation chapter three
[24:24] god spoke clearly to ledician said i
[24:28] know thy works
[24:30] i know your works
[24:32] and then he outlined them
[24:35] first of all uh god mentioned that they
[24:38] were
[24:39] self-opiniated
[24:41] because thou says
[24:43] you're saying you've got your own
[24:45] opinion about yourself
[24:47] and you've got your opinion about what
[24:50] you think and about what you have
[24:52] accomplished and what you are
[24:55] but
[24:56] god says
[24:58] there you
[24:59] you got spiritual amnesia
[25:02] because no yes thou not
[25:05] you don't even know
[25:07] what condition you're in
[25:10] you don't even recognize what state you
[25:13] are in
[25:14] so
[25:15] their cells opiniated
[25:18] they had spiritual amnesia
[25:21] and on top of that
[25:23] god said you're wretched
[25:25] oh my are rich then he says not all
[25:29] you're wretched you're miserable
[25:31] uh
[25:32] you're in your wretchedness and in your
[25:35] wretchedness internally right
[25:39] you're internally now you're miserable
[25:42] you're always depressed you always
[25:45] got internal struggle and upheavals
[25:48] mental problems oppressions you're
[25:51] miserable wretched
[25:53] and spiritually you don't have any
[25:55] spiritual character you're naked you're
[25:58] blind and you don't even know it because
[26:01] you don't recognize your position in
[26:03] christ you don't recognize your position
[26:07] in the word of god
[26:09] on top of that you're blind
[26:12] i know we have read these scriptures
[26:14] over and over but watch the outline of
[26:18] the various things that this patient has
[26:22] in their life
[26:24] and why they're going to die
[26:27] because they have the disease of
[26:30] self-opinion
[26:32] the disease of spiritual amnesia
[26:35] the disease of wretchedness the disease
[26:39] of being miserable
[26:41] and on top of that they got their eye
[26:44] disease
[26:46] they're blind
[26:48] blind
[26:49] now if a man is blind and he is willing
[26:52] to accept your help in taking him across
[26:55] the street well that's marvelous
[26:57] wonderful but if that guy is blind a
[27:00] woman is blind and still think they know
[27:04] and still think they can see
[27:08] whatever how are you going to ever be
[27:10] able to lead them across the street
[27:13] they refuse your help
[27:16] because they're blind to the dangers
[27:18] that they face they're blind to the
[27:21] things that are coming by
[27:23] oh my
[27:25] and on top of that they're poor
[27:28] spiritually poor
[27:30] you might be a billionaire in this world
[27:33] but in the sight of god you're poor
[27:36] if you don't have faith in the word of
[27:38] god that will change your life
[27:42] on top of that you're naked
[27:44] look how many things that they really
[27:47] have
[27:48] you're naked
[27:50] naked of what you're naked of the robes
[27:53] of righteousness
[27:55] you're naked of the
[27:58] word of god to cover you
[28:00] to be your protection
[28:02] you're all in all
[28:05] you're proud
[28:07] arrogant
[28:08] and on top of that they're religious
[28:13] you're religious
[28:15] you know what the word was talking about
[28:18] back in that book of revelation this day
[28:21] the religious spirit that's upon the
[28:23] people in this name
[28:26] they religious and with their
[28:27] religiousness they become arrogant they
[28:30] become proud they become naked miserable
[28:34] and so on in the presence of god
[28:37] hallelujah amen but my friends look at
[28:40] the contrast
[28:42] between the these religious church
[28:46] followers
[28:48] and the overcomer or the true believer
[28:52] oh my
[28:54] to him that overcome it thou grant to
[28:56] sit with me in my father's throne
[29:01] amen praise god in other words how you
[29:04] gonna sit in the throne i have to exalt
[29:06] you i have to rapture you out of here i
[29:09] have to take you out to be able to put
[29:12] you in that position
[29:15] amen praise god also you've got to see
[29:19] that there is a relationship
[29:23] between the lord
[29:25] and these two parties
[29:27] he has one relationship with the false
[29:30] vine
[29:31] and he has another relationship with the
[29:34] true bride of jesus christ
[29:37] amen because he has come back
[29:40] now
[29:42] to gather one
[29:45] and
[29:46] he is back now
[29:48] to bind and burn the other set
[29:53] for right now he's already binding them
[29:56] into denominations
[29:58] they're being bound into those uh what
[30:01] you call them bales or whatever you see
[30:03] in the fields that the farmers have
[30:06] bound up there that's why they're
[30:08] different different churches different
[30:09] churches they got them all around and
[30:12] everything else and they're all over the
[30:13] field but he's just binding them
[30:16] together
[30:18] for the burning
[30:20] is that right now
[30:23] so we see
[30:25] this is all taking place
[30:28] amen
[30:29] but now is the reaping time
[30:33] this is not a time for planting so much
[30:36] as for reaping
[30:38] because you've come through spring
[30:41] come through the hot sun of august
[30:44] summer oh
[30:45] now the time of reading harvest times
[30:49] upon us
[30:50] time for the sickle to go in
[30:53] time for god to send the angel
[30:56] messengers to bring the word of god that
[30:59] will separate the seed from the tears
[31:03] from the weeds
[31:05] amen
[31:07] yes sir we all been in the weeds how
[31:09] many of you know you've been in the
[31:10] weeds
[31:12] you couldn't see the word
[31:14] you couldn't understand the word of
[31:16] course you know about the bible maybe i
[31:18] even went to church i went to church we
[31:20] have reading the bible for years but
[31:22] then all of a sudden when god began to
[31:25] open up that word to my eyes to my the
[31:27] eyes of my heart the bible became a new
[31:30] bible oh praise god forevermore
[31:34] hallelujah
[31:35] amen and i'm still changing
[31:39] i'm changing to this very day
[31:41] oh praise god i feel the power to change
[31:45] upon me not only at the rapture but the
[31:48] change taking place now the spirit of
[31:51] the living god promised in this last day
[31:54] he will be upon his people he'll briefly
[31:57] walk in the light as he is in the light
[31:59] amen what light the light of the world
[32:03] when the bible opens it shines
[32:05] understanding on the word and you begin
[32:08] to realize what you what was sitting
[32:11] there all the time amen an unused book
[32:14] that was just sitting there but in that
[32:16] book is life eternal oh blessed be the
[32:20] name of the lord amen matthew chapter 13
[32:24] when you have the time to read it
[32:26] matthew 13 24 to 30
[32:29] speaks about the other another parable
[32:32] where jesus lightened the kingdom of
[32:35] heaven lightened to a man that planted a
[32:38] field with seeds
[32:40] good seeds oh
[32:43] but
[32:44] you know some weeks later his servants
[32:47] went out to look at it they said but
[32:49] master you planted good seeds but now we
[32:52] are seeing tears coming up amongst the
[32:55] seeds that you're planting shall we pull
[32:59] out those those tears shall we pull out
[33:02] the tears no
[33:04] leave them alone
[33:06] let the two seeds grow together
[33:09] true and false
[33:11] but remember both seeds are religious
[33:16] both seeds religious just like abe cain
[33:19] and abel they both built altars but one
[33:22] built a false altar
[33:24] and one built a true altar
[33:27] one offered a false offering to god
[33:31] the other one offered a lamb a true
[33:34] offering to god one offered by unbelief
[33:38] one offered by faith abel offered a
[33:42] better sacrifice
[33:44] oh praise god forevermore hallelujah
[33:47] amen oh my praise god where god is
[33:51] leading me i don't know but i'm just
[33:53] following
[33:54] because something keeps striking my soul
[33:57] something keeps striking my being
[34:00] something is going on amen praise god in
[34:03] me and in the church too amen here i
[34:05] thank god for it so those chairs mix
[34:09] within the wheat
[34:11] they're all going to church
[34:13] is that right
[34:15] but he says don't pluck them up brother
[34:18] branham explained that he says because
[34:20] if you pluck up the tears
[34:23] the tears usually are ones who try to
[34:26] build their influence in the church
[34:30] so if you pluck up the tears you're
[34:32] going to pull up all the other ones who
[34:33] have confidence in them
[34:36] so
[34:37] a wise uh angel or messenger will leave
[34:42] them to grow together to maturity to the
[34:46] time of the end when people will
[34:48] actually start to recognize there is a
[34:51] difference
[34:52] just recognize that something is going
[34:55] on
[34:56] that he is the same god and he can
[34:58] reveal here today thanks be to god amen
[35:02] oh praise god forevermore so here these
[35:06] denominational bundles will be gathered
[35:10] together
[35:11] and these tears from
[35:13] the first
[35:15] church ages coming down into the nicean
[35:19] council 325 a.d from the catholic church
[35:23] there were right there growing
[35:26] alongside
[35:28] with the true church which they tried to
[35:31] kill off with inquisition and so on
[35:34] they tried to wipe it out so that they
[35:38] will be recognized as the mother church
[35:41] as the one true church
[35:44] but god said
[35:46] you know flesh and blood has not
[35:48] revealed this but my father in heaven
[35:51] has revealed this and upon this rock
[35:54] i'll build my church and the gates of
[35:57] hell will not prevail against it praise
[36:00] god oh god's little speckle bird no
[36:04] matter how she might be his presence
[36:07] will be there with her amen now they're
[36:11] building up through all them ages
[36:15] spreading this false idea of faith
[36:19] and building up themselves into
[36:21] political power
[36:23] and that political power has to grow so
[36:27] that they can literally after a while
[36:30] force you to
[36:31] believe or accept their false doctrine
[36:34] which is not in the bible the word
[36:36] trinity and trinitarians not even in the
[36:38] bible uh the teaching of that is not in
[36:41] the bible there is no three gods and the
[36:44] jews know that already that god said it
[36:47] plain in the ten commandments hero
[36:49] israel the lord thy god is one lord
[36:55] does god change his mind about his word
[36:58] could god see anything wrong god didn't
[37:00] change his mind say oh i used to be one
[37:03] back there in the old testament but now
[37:05] i become three
[37:07] no god doesn't change his mind it's one
[37:10] god
[37:12] hallelujah
[37:14] and so when they come to the fact that
[37:17] jesus said go baptizing them in the name
[37:22] not names
[37:23] of the father and of the son and of the
[37:26] holy ghost that person who is father his
[37:30] son his holy ghost has one name
[37:34] and when on on the day of pentecost
[37:37] peter the first so-called
[37:40] first pope
[37:41] uh was asked men and brethren what shall
[37:44] we do to be saved he said repent
[37:48] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[37:52] what
[37:53] so that name of that person who is
[37:55] father son and holy ghost is jesus
[37:58] christ
[37:59] and peter didn't waste time he didn't
[38:01] waste time he just went and said baptize
[38:04] them in the name of jesus christ
[38:07] hallelujah how you go how which woman is
[38:10] going to be feeling comfortable
[38:12] have assurance and confidence she gets
[38:15] married and a man doesn't want to put
[38:17] his name
[38:18] he writes dung i'm a father yeah that's
[38:21] not your name
[38:23] i'm a son of my mother that's not your
[38:25] name
[38:26] well i'm a carpenter
[38:28] that's good you have a nice job that you
[38:30] think you have but
[38:31] that's not your name the
[38:33] the the preacher is going to say no
[38:36] we need your name on this to register
[38:38] the government will not accept it unless
[38:40] you put your name
[38:42] hallelujah and that is why when we come
[38:45] to this waters of baptism we come to ba
[38:48] to be saved we come to be born again
[38:51] amen it's really a spiritual invisible
[38:55] marriage within your christ
[38:58] hallelujah and you take on his name
[39:03] and that is why you called a christian
[39:07] hallelujah amen praise god amen and so
[39:12] friends
[39:15] they are trying to accomplish their
[39:17] cowardly plot
[39:19] because they sit behind the scene and
[39:21] manipulate governments
[39:24] manipulate various authorities
[39:27] and doing all of that
[39:29] and at the same time going to church
[39:32] singing praising god
[39:34] because they know
[39:36] that the bible says god sends his reign
[39:41] natural
[39:43] and spiritual
[39:45] upon the just
[39:47] and on the unjust
[39:49] they're getting genuine blessings some
[39:50] of those pentecostals are getting
[39:52] genuine blessings they're getting
[39:55] genuine blessings in some of those
[39:56] church
[39:57] and they're abusing that
[40:00] and trying to say that is their
[40:02] credibility and authority
[40:05] but my friends
[40:07] god is going to take us out of here
[40:11] first of all identifies by the word
[40:14] and
[40:15] that
[40:16] kind of um
[40:18] let's say plot that they have is slowly
[40:21] going to be fading away from them
[40:25] because the coverage will be wrenched
[40:27] off of them
[40:28] they'll be uncovered and no longer will
[40:32] they be able to have a share
[40:34] of the blessings that god is sending
[40:37] down
[40:39] thank god the wheat will be god
[40:42] the bride will be gone out of here
[40:45] caught up in the presence of the living
[40:48] god
[40:49] of course
[40:50] that evil church
[40:53] that the bible says is going to dress
[40:55] herself to look so
[40:57] beautiful and look so pompous you know
[41:01] revelation 18 19 mystery babylon
[41:04] but she's a mother of harlots
[41:07] right
[41:08] uh
[41:09] all these thousands of churches are
[41:11] wrong with their hands out for money
[41:13] that's what their hands out for money
[41:16] every street corner there
[41:17] they pull up a building
[41:20] they come out of nowhere and they put up
[41:22] a building the building is full
[41:24] and their hands are out for money the
[41:26] bible says you're mother of harlots
[41:29] but in one hour i'll destroy you
[41:32] because you commit spiritual
[41:34] fornications with the kings of the earth
[41:37] and leaders of the earth
[41:39] i mean all the big businesses and
[41:41] everything i said one hour i'll burn
[41:43] everything down
[41:45] god said it it will happen amen before
[41:50] years ago when the people didn't know
[41:51] about what was happening now they would
[41:54] say that's impossible how are you going
[41:55] to burn it but now with one of these
[41:58] missiles that they're dropping they can
[42:00] burn any place down in an hour if they
[42:03] choose to do it
[42:04] right now as you see what's happening in
[42:06] russia and uh you know they're sending
[42:09] many many um little missiles
[42:13] but you know they got big ones
[42:16] that they can drop one
[42:18] and it can
[42:20] destroy not just a city
[42:23] that's why they don't want to use
[42:25] nuclear force because if the united
[42:27] states fire back is the whole planet is
[42:30] burnt up to
[42:31] and gone
[42:32] right so
[42:34] god can burn that in one hour
[42:36] and that's nothing
[42:38] for him
[42:40] to do that
[42:41] but everything is coming to its harvest
[42:44] everything is coming to its head
[42:46] and so they are coming to the headship
[42:48] of the antichrist
[42:50] and we are coming to the headship of
[42:52] jesus christ
[42:55] jesus christ is the word
[42:57] and the word begins to lead us
[42:59] and take preeminence within our hearts
[43:03] and within our lives
[43:05] they are led by the mystery of inequity
[43:08] and we are led by the mystery of
[43:11] godliness
[43:13] of how god's spirit in you
[43:15] is able to make us godly
[43:18] while we were caught up in that we
[43:20] thought we could make ourselves godly
[43:22] all we have to do is turn over a new
[43:25] leaf all we have to do is join the
[43:27] church
[43:29] like that but we didn't realize that it
[43:33] takes god's spirit and god's power to
[43:37] really come into our beings and to begin
[43:40] to clean us from the inside out
[43:44] is that right
[43:45] don't clean up yourself from the outside
[43:47] in
[43:48] putting on nice beautiful clothes in
[43:50] your rotten character your makeup is oh
[43:54] my goodness
[43:56] and then they say stinking thinking
[44:00] even your thoughts constantly evil
[44:03] oh my
[44:05] but the god thank god he has revealed it
[44:08] to us that he wants to clean us from the
[44:10] inside out
[44:12] that's why paul said work out your
[44:16] salvation
[44:17] with fear and trembling oh praise be to
[44:21] god amen yes sir
[44:24] so now
[44:26] the false church is coming
[44:29] but she's coming with cunning power
[44:33] political power
[44:35] manipulative power
[44:37] and she's coming with all the politics
[44:40] and powers that you can see
[44:42] but she's also
[44:44] gathering don't forget this she's
[44:47] gathering all her demons of darkness
[44:51] amen to blind the minds and hearts of
[44:54] men
[44:55] that they won't recognize
[44:58] what really is happening spiritually
[45:02] yes sir coming against the true vine
[45:06] but the true believers are maturing also
[45:10] coming into the fullness of the word
[45:13] coming into the richness of jesus christ
[45:16] hallelujah and thank god
[45:19] she will be like him
[45:21] and jesus himself
[45:24] will come
[45:25] praise god hallelujah and she
[45:29] i want to quote
[45:30] she is becoming like him
[45:34] through the word
[45:37] the word that he sent
[45:39] by an anointed prophet is what's
[45:41] cleaning us up
[45:43] and preparing us
[45:45] for the great rapture that is before us
[45:49] amen hallelujah so
[45:52] you look around you see what the bible
[45:55] already said they're going to bundle
[45:57] themselves together they're going to
[45:58] make a combine
[46:00] they're gonna make a religious union
[46:03] the ecumenical council is already formed
[46:06] the world coastal churches actually uh
[46:09] one friend of mine is a member of the
[46:10] board right
[46:13] way up in there and
[46:16] he likes those kinds of things so he's
[46:18] way up in there but let me tell you it
[46:20] is a living reality that is happening
[46:23] right now
[46:26] amen
[46:27] oh think of it
[46:29] yes sir but thank god
[46:32] the bride and the bread room
[46:34] will be caught away
[46:36] to have a wonderful time in the presence
[46:40] of the living god
[46:42] forever united as one
[46:45] that is the word of god
[46:47] amen thank god
[46:50] hallelujah
[46:51] i'm glad
[46:53] uh if i might just talk i'm preaching
[46:56] but i'm talk a little bit here now i'm
[46:58] glad
[46:59] when this message crossed my path
[47:03] i didn't search for it i didn't beg for
[47:05] it but god allowed it to cross my path
[47:08] and from that time to this
[47:10] it has completely transformed my life
[47:14] that i can stand here tonight and preach
[47:17] to you the word of god hallelujah i
[47:21] thank god
[47:22] uh here listen to this you see
[47:26] the the ecumenical move or the tears
[47:29] and the things they will do
[47:32] but thank god he will send forth a
[47:34] prophet
[47:36] in this last age you see when the devil
[47:38] raises up a standard god raises up a
[47:41] standard against him
[47:43] is that right
[47:44] that's the way it is see
[47:47] and his message
[47:50] will
[47:50] by his message the hearts of god's
[47:54] children will be turned right back to
[47:58] the original
[47:59] fathers
[48:01] and
[48:02] with the restoration
[48:05] of the word that they receive
[48:08] will also come
[48:10] a restoration
[48:12] of power
[48:14] not gifts not tongues not this not that
[48:16] but a restoration of supernatural power
[48:21] will return in the church we're living
[48:23] in perilous times now
[48:25] we're living in crucial times right now
[48:28] it's going on all around us you just got
[48:30] to you don't have to be even a christian
[48:32] to recognize something
[48:34] is wrong
[48:36] the world is slipping away
[48:39] civilization is at the point of its
[48:42] setting sun
[48:44] oh it's going to things are getting
[48:47] darker all the time
[48:50] and we must recognize it amen because
[48:54] the word at the turn of the century
[48:57] people were so hungry for god you know
[49:00] that
[49:01] even some of them passed through the
[49:03] city of burlington hamilton here and
[49:05] went over into new england and revivals
[49:08] broke out from there usually they put in
[49:11] the history books that the revival start
[49:13] over in new england but it really right
[49:16] here in hamilton and burlington the
[49:18] people were passing and a snowstorm
[49:21] delayed them and praying and and seeking
[49:25] god and everything and it started
[49:27] but then they went over to new england
[49:30] and it broke out in a bigger way and so
[49:33] it's documented that
[49:35] they had a great awakening over there
[49:38] but not really so and those things they
[49:41] don't document
[49:42] uh like the great revival over in the
[49:46] new brunswick newfoundland you know
[49:50] god used mighty man here in canada and
[49:54] anoint them use them for his glory
[49:57] amen
[49:58] wonderful way we thank god for that in
[50:01] such a marvelous and wonderful way for
[50:05] the great things he has done
[50:08] and so
[50:08] god sent the holy spirit you know the
[50:10] pentecostal revival broke out
[50:14] it would have been wonderful if they
[50:16] continue with how they were
[50:18] but as soon as they broke out
[50:20] each person each one of those leaders
[50:23] want their portion of the leadership so
[50:25] this one form church of god in christ
[50:28] this one form united pentecostal that
[50:31] one form this and there they were in a
[50:33] hurry to form these denominations
[50:36] and put their names on it right like
[50:40] that and the moment they're organized
[50:41] they died
[50:43] because organization is death
[50:46] and that is what took place and they
[50:49] adopted this doctrine of tongues
[50:53] in the evidence
[50:54] of the
[50:56] holy spirit
[50:57] well thomas is a manifestation of the
[51:00] spirit but not the evidence of the holy
[51:02] spirit
[51:03] right see we got to recognize that and
[51:06] so it's the falsity of that doctrine
[51:10] that has led them where they are in
[51:12] reality they should recognize
[51:15] the handwriting is again on the wall
[51:20] many many take in you far sin your
[51:23] weight in the balances and you found
[51:25] wanting
[51:27] god coming again
[51:29] to bring his judgment like he did
[51:32] back then
[51:33] oh praise god hallelujah and
[51:37] all that happened because the prophet of
[51:39] malachi 4 5
[51:41] was not yet on the scene
[51:44] right
[51:46] still not yet on the scene
[51:48] and then uh by him not being on the
[51:52] scene
[51:53] they couldn't get the word as yet
[51:55] they could get all kind of power all
[51:57] kinds of
[52:01] all kinds of spirit all kinds of
[52:03] attitude that's fine brother but i think
[52:05] my voice is
[52:07] loud enough that they can hear
[52:09] i guess it's for them for the machines
[52:12] there okay thank you very much
[52:14] but thank god
[52:16] you know because he had not come on the
[52:19] scene they could jump as much as they
[52:21] want speak in tongues as much as they
[52:23] want but the word hadn't yet come
[52:27] so if the sun hadn't come up
[52:31] where are they going to get the
[52:33] warmth the heat and the light
[52:36] to ripen the fruit
[52:38] on the tree
[52:40] and that is what happened the sunlight
[52:42] has come
[52:43] amen like the one other prophet in the
[52:46] bible mentioned that god will wait but
[52:48] at evening time it shall be light again
[52:53] and send the light and that light will
[52:56] ripen the fruit that is there upon the
[52:59] tree praise god hallelujah oh my two
[53:04] separate
[53:05] barns
[53:06] and two separate destination just like
[53:09] the two thieves on the cross
[53:11] is that right
[53:12] today you will be with me in paradise
[53:14] raptured over there amen and the other
[53:17] one he went to his destination because
[53:21] there he was speaking and cursing
[53:24] against god
[53:26] now revelation 3 i'm going to try to
[53:28] wind this up now and we'll get to the
[53:31] baptism so please
[53:34] revelation 3 22 he that had an ear let
[53:38] him hear what the spirit said under the
[53:41] churches
[53:42] now we know this is a last warning
[53:46] and there will not be another warning
[53:50] because god's throne room has already
[53:53] been set up
[53:55] we thank god
[53:56] that the
[53:58] mansions are being prepared of course
[54:01] you know mansions don't mean a house
[54:03] like we say house
[54:05] but believers have another body
[54:08] this is just your natural one
[54:10] but when we leave here we go to a
[54:12] spiritual one
[54:14] we go to a supernatural one
[54:16] that god has prepared for us
[54:20] a body has now prepared me
[54:23] amen thank god
[54:25] and this prepared people
[54:28] are being called to go into the presence
[54:30] of god
[54:31] hallelujah oh thank god so my friends
[54:35] the spirit of god is not going to
[54:39] speak
[54:40] the word to another age
[54:43] he will speak to this age because the
[54:46] ages are over
[54:48] and and at the same time scriptures like
[54:51] he that hinders
[54:53] will hinder no more
[54:55] because he'll be out of the way in other
[54:57] words satan will give satan a chance to
[54:59] take over let them see what the world
[55:01] will become on the satan's rulership
[55:04] just for a short while right he's going
[55:06] to step back and let satan take over let
[55:10] the antichrist and then begin to rule
[55:12] for a while before he actually comes
[55:16] again
[55:17] with the second coming and
[55:20] change the scene of everything that is
[55:23] going on
[55:25] but thank god
[55:26] that a prophet came
[55:29] to us in time
[55:32] thank god
[55:34] and has revealed the truth to us just as
[55:37] he did
[55:38] through paul
[55:39] uh we are privileged people
[55:42] i know we can just say that
[55:44] anybody that heard the message whether
[55:47] they are just a make-believer or
[55:49] whatever right on up to the true
[55:51] believer is fortunate and blessed to
[55:54] even hear this word
[55:56] and hear the message that god sent
[55:59] through this prophet amen
[56:02] now listen to the promise
[56:05] they that will hear him
[56:08] that prophet
[56:10] will be blessed
[56:13] and
[56:14] become a part of the bride of this last
[56:18] day
[56:20] as mentioned in revelation 22 17
[56:23] the spirit and the bride
[56:26] says come
[56:28] see
[56:29] that wheat that fell in the ground at
[56:32] nicaea will come back to the original
[56:35] grain again
[56:38] hallelujah praise god el mai
[56:42] and when she listened to the
[56:44] authenticated prophet of god who appears
[56:47] in this last stage
[56:50] what he says from god
[56:52] the bride will begin to say also
[56:56] has that happened
[56:57] is that happening the bride will say the
[57:01] same thing
[57:02] so then you see
[57:04] the spirit
[57:06] the prophet
[57:07] and the bride will all be saying the
[57:11] same thing
[57:13] and what they are saying will have
[57:16] already been said
[57:19] in their word
[57:21] praise god hallelujah you see we
[57:25] we have to be careful because we speak
[57:27] about unwritten word and a lot of them
[57:30] think that you're adding on something or
[57:33] you're making up something in your own
[57:35] mind they don't realize it's the same
[57:37] word
[57:39] but you are not just looking at the
[57:42] written part
[57:43] you are receiving the
[57:46] nuance might be a word that could be
[57:48] close to what i'm trying to convey
[57:50] you're picking up the nuance not the
[57:52] words that the person say only
[57:55] like somebody can speak to you but it's
[57:57] not just their words it's their
[57:59] attitudes when they're saying that word
[58:01] it's it's little things coming off of
[58:03] their of their being when they're saying
[58:05] it it's the same thing with the word of
[58:08] god reading between the lines and
[58:11] understanding what he is saying to you
[58:14] amen hallelujah praise god so the cry
[58:18] has gone out and it's still going out
[58:20] come out of her my people
[58:22] be not partakers of her plagues
[58:26] amen you know that means the the the
[58:30] great tribulation
[58:32] amen
[58:33] under the sixth seal don't be left
[58:36] behind and be a partaker of that but
[58:39] come out of her now
[58:41] and it won't be long he says
[58:44] but this is the last age
[58:47] the ages are over
[58:50] in other words time shall be no more
[58:53] time for the church angels are over oh
[58:56] my
[58:57] yes sir he that he got in there to hear
[59:00] let him hear what the spirit said to the
[59:03] churches so god has spoken and you got
[59:05] to have an heir predestinated in you to
[59:08] hear what he is saying
[59:10] hallelujah you got to have an ear and
[59:13] you see
[59:14] you don't pray that dumb you don't fast
[59:16] that down to get it and to be able to
[59:18] really hear god and understand god it's
[59:20] not you don't work yourself up like like
[59:23] bails prophets to be able to get it
[59:26] praise god but my god brother sister you
[59:30] come into this world with that air
[59:34] it's only that we didn't know we had it
[59:37] we didn't know we had it
[59:39] until god began to unveil his word to us
[59:43] hallelujah
[59:44] oh my the sun is setting
[59:48] right now the setting the setting of the
[59:51] sun of the church ages
[59:54] is about to fade into eternity

[1:00:06] repentance and give your life to him
