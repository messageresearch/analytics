[11:33] 52 14 paragraph 52 brother Bron speaks
[11:38] here listen to
[11:40] you
[11:42] amen
[11:44] now see the adoption come and God begins
[11:49] to pour into us his fullness his power
[11:52] his resurrection and when the church in
[11:55] Christ become so close together till
[12:00] Christ
[12:02] becomes visible Among Us
[12:06] amen become visible Among
[12:11] Us and begins to even raise the
[12:15] dead and then we go into the Rapture
[12:18] praise the Lord
[12:21] hallelujah just those that are filled
[12:25] with the Holy Ghost will go in that
[12:28] rapture
[12:29] amen but can you believe that the same
[12:33] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[12:35] and quickened him will begin to Quicken
[12:38] us to such a point that you are going to
[12:41] be laying hands on the
[12:43] sick even on those that are dead and
[12:46] that they would recover and the dead
[12:48] will come to life again this is what
[12:50] he's saying as it gets close to the
[12:52] Rapture the quickening power will be so
[12:55] much upon the adopted Sons and Daughters
[12:57] of God that Christ will be made flesh
[13:02] visible before us even with the raising
[13:05] of the Dead does he mean that Jesus will
[13:08] appear visibly Among Us or does he uh is
[13:13] he saying that the holy spirit will come
[13:15] into the lights of some Believers so
[13:18] real amen that they are actually like
[13:21] his flesh and the dead will be raised up
[13:24] for the glory of God hallelujah now let
[13:26] me start to wind this up praise God the
[13:29] Holy Ghost also come to give you power
[13:32] amen power brothers and sisters over
[13:36] Satan power against over the world power
[13:39] over your habits power over your uh life
[13:45] in every way amen life power to overcome
[13:49] by the grace of God he promised that he
[13:52] would give us that power against unclean
[13:56] spirits praise the Lord
[13:59] hallelujah it's that's the way it is you
[14:02] will find that when the Holy Ghost
[14:04] really starts taking over your life not
[14:07] only good people will be attracted to
[14:09] you but actually demon powers will be
[14:12] attracted to you because you're you
[14:15] become a
[14:16] light a light in the Supernatural World
[14:20] Hallelujah and just like when you put a
[14:23] lamp you know in the in the country or
[14:26] up north you go put a lamp it's the
[14:29] worst thing you can do in the middle of
[14:31] a place where you got mosquitoes and bus
[14:33] and all kinds of stuff you know what
[14:36] they all coming towards that light is
[14:39] that right and then you wonder why you
[14:41] have all these chest and trials but
[14:45] any all the bugs are coming towards that
[14:47] light amen is that right so what happens
[14:51] is that I'm talking about satanic Powers
[14:54] demon powers they're attracted to a life
[14:57] anointed by the holy spirit amen
[15:00] and many times when some of them come to
[15:02] you like that is they're crying for
[15:04] help because that person wants to be
[15:07] free from that habit or from that devil
[15:10] they'll come out to the blue you don't
[15:12] even know them and they say oh how you
[15:13] doing you just start ordering
[15:15] conversation and they'll start to go
[15:16] into man I don't know what happened I
[15:18] have this bad thing you know and I can't
[15:20] overcome it and I don't know what to do
[15:22] it's literally that spirit and that
[15:24] person is calling out to you and asking
[15:27] you to deliver and bring them into a
[15:29] state of Deliverance and it doesn't
[15:32] called for you to lay your hands on the
[15:34] person or and go into a real um what we
[15:39] think is a Deliverance Prayer oh God In
[15:42] The Name of
[15:44] Jesus and then the person going to be
[15:46] delivered no many times brother Grand
[15:48] say God bless you Sister amen thank God
[15:52] bless you brother may the Lord help you
[15:56] and deliver you from that thing amen
[15:58] just like that praise the Lord because
[16:01] it's not you doing it it's him doing it
[16:03] I'm not saying we're not going to get
[16:04] emotional from time to time but it's not
[16:07] the
[16:08] emotion it's who you are in Christ
[16:12] praise the name of the Lord amen what's
[16:15] the difference when a cop is on the
[16:17] street and he doesn't even open his
[16:19] mouth and he just
[16:21] does he didn't shout he screamed to the
[16:24] top of his voice he just stop right
[16:27] there I said you obey because of not the
[16:32] S of his voice but who he is and the
[16:36] Devils obey you because of who you are
[16:39] praise the Lord so you must understand
[16:41] that and begin to exercise your
[16:43] Authority hallelujah praise the Lord
[16:45] this message is just an introduction I
[16:48] will continue to speak along these lines
[16:50] honestly honestly I I I thought today's
[16:54] service the Holy Spirit would move in a
[16:56] different way than he's moving now but
[16:58] in instead of that he's just brought
[17:01] deid into a place where for you to just
[17:03] listen and and hear the word that's fine
[17:05] with me praise the Lord but the fact is
[17:08] brother and sister I want to understand
[17:11] God is wanting to get us now to a place
[17:14] where you individually as the members of
[17:17] this congregation begin to act on the
[17:20] word that you've been receiving all
[17:21] these years time we act on the word
[17:25] hallelujah you don't want to have a
[17:27] child in the house when they turn 14 20
[17:29] and we still can't
[17:34] walk I know how I say things sometimes
[17:36] some
[17:37] funny he's telling you the truth is that
[17:40] right it's the same thing spiritually
[17:43] speaking you want the children to walk
[17:45] you want them to talk and you want them
[17:47] to exercise Authority praise the Lord if
[17:51] you're not home you want them to say no
[17:53] you can't come in here this is my
[17:54] father's house this is mine even I mean
[17:57] even what what you call him
[17:59] even the dog in the house that you just
[18:02] feed as your pet would not allow just
[18:05] anybody to walk in your
[18:08] house keep a l of noise and everything
[18:10] else and we are the children of God
[18:14] don't just let us allow the devil to run
[18:17] rush oh yes but to wake up and recognize
[18:20] who you are amen and I want you also not
[18:24] to back away this is what I'm trying to
[18:26] get you to do talk acknowledge the
[18:29] Pentecostal
[18:31] blessing acknowledge the Holy Ghost and
[18:35] walk right into the power and presence
[18:37] of the Holy Spirit and not to walk away
[18:39] from it and to be afraid of the Holy
[18:42] Spirit the holy spirit is here to
[18:44] quitting us back to the word I'm
[18:49] closing you see when brother Bram came
[18:53] under the inspiration of Malachi
[18:56] 4:5 every messenger came and had to
[18:59] change to be in the junction of time to
[19:02] change the
[19:03] age Paul was there to changed the Jewish
[19:08] Believers and all the people from law to
[19:12] Grace amen is that right and if you
[19:15] listen to all the Epistles much of what
[19:17] he talk about is Grace by Grace already
[19:20] say the grace of God God rich in Mercy
[19:23] and you know is to change the people
[19:25] from law to Grace and every subsequent
[19:30] messenger his job was to change the
[19:34] people from the spirit of the age before
[19:37] to the age that's
[19:39] coming is that right so what has
[19:43] happened is that to break or chop the
[19:47] people away from the Lutheran age then
[19:52] what happen Wesley and the Methodist had
[19:55] to point out a lot of the misgiving in
[19:58] the Lutheran
[19:58] [Music]
[19:59] that Luther was still smoken that Luther
[20:01] still hated Jews even though he was a
[20:04] messenger used for justification and
[20:06] stuff of that nature uh he had a lot of
[20:09] flaws is that right and and so he had to
[20:12] point those things out to chop the
[20:15] people away from that age to follow his
[20:18] message but what has what happened he
[20:21] wasn't telling them to get rid of
[20:25] justification no they were supposed to
[20:27] accept justif tion which was the Prime
[20:30] part of Luther's message but all the
[20:32] other things they had to leave that
[20:34] behind so when brother BR G he began to
[20:39] stress and hit tell it's not the
[20:41] evidence of the Holy Ghost then he start
[20:44] say hereit Pentecost amen Pentecostal
[20:48] buzs now he wasn't talking of the
[20:51] original Pentecost of Paul and them
[20:54] that's not what he was talking about but
[20:57] people in this message just take this
[20:59] overall idea that every Pentecost
[21:02] everything
[21:04] Pentecostal is of the devil and it's not
[21:06] of God and it's not of the age and they
[21:09] pushed aside everything
[21:12] Pentecostal until that when you act
[21:14] preach or talk or the Holy Ghost
[21:16] genuinely comes into a service they're
[21:18] scared of it or they don't want
[21:21] it is that right amen I've been in
[21:24] Services where I'm preaching the Holy
[21:25] Ghost come down and the preacher tells
[21:26] me oh I was so scared I feel chills go
[21:29] up my spine I amen I've been into other
[21:33] services where people in the message for
[21:34] many years and they they
[21:37] never had anything to do with the
[21:39] genuine holy spirit amen all they got is
[21:43] a word word word and they and they felt
[21:46] that up to that point and I'm okay amen
[21:49] they didn't realize that you got to let
[21:51] that word carry you into an experience
[21:53] with God Amen Hallelujah said I know
[21:56] that I know amen amen praise God it's
[22:00] got to take you experience and away from
[22:03] just having it a mental fit of believing
[22:08] the message to actual quickening power
[22:11] in your
[22:12] life amen where you're acting on the
[22:15] word and seeing God moving in your
[22:18] hearts and your minds praise the Lord
[22:20] don't might you can start coming up here
[22:22] this is a nice uh quiet service here
[22:25] today but come on up let's give God the
[22:29] praise
[22:31] am but I'm glad I can say I'm one of
[22:36] them I trying to do I'm not one of those
[22:40] Messengers but I'm trying to turn a
[22:41] corner with
[22:43] new the Bible says that a lot of the
[22:46] people were
[22:48] Jews but they knew not
[22:51] Joseph is that right people in the
[22:54] message talking about the prophet
[22:56] they're showing the videos of the
[22:58] prophet praying for the sick and all
[23:00] this kinds of stuff and they hear about
[23:02] those great meetings and you can tell
[23:04] the stories over and over but they
[23:07] themselves were never in a meeting like
[23:11] that they were never in a meeting like
[23:14] that where the Holy Spirit comes down
[23:16] and take control of the congregation and
[23:19] God receives the glory some of you have
[23:21] a taste of it here from time to time but
[23:24] the point of it is they don't know
[23:27] anything about that all they know is
[23:29] about the Prophet The Prophet the
[23:30] message the prophet and that's good
[23:32] that's very good it's good we watch the
[23:34] videos while we want to be in the next
[23:36] set of videos they making for them that
[23:38] come
[23:40] tribulation is that right we want to be
[23:43] in those videos praise the Lord because
[23:46] they need to you need to recognize that
[23:48] we genuinely serve a living
[23:52] God I I can't stress it enough because
[23:55] he a spirit and you come in the air and
[23:57] we just preaching and song that we just
[23:59] talking and you don't see nobody else
[24:01] but from time to time when he chooses
[24:04] the Bible says the angel of the Lord
[24:06] came down put his toe and Trouble the
[24:08] waters is that right Book of Revelation
[24:11] says the waters is the people amen
[24:14] sometime from time God is going to
[24:16] trouble the waters and some of you going
[24:19] to act beside yourself is that right
[24:23] you're going to act beside yourself
[24:25] that's not me yes you're right it's not
[24:27] you the Holy Ghost praise the Lord you
[24:31] do something you expect you want to do
[24:32] you s you shout you you praise God I
[24:35] don't care how it comes out but you act
[24:38] upon the word and let God have his way
[24:40] within your life too much of this
[24:42] spiritual regression calling and binding
[24:46] people where they can't really allow the
[24:49] Holy Ghost to express itself through you
[24:51] one woman come to brother after Ser said
[24:53] brother BR why you were preaching she
[24:55] said I felt so happy and the Lord I felt
[24:59] like getting out in the AIS and dancing
[25:02] in the spirit of God hallelujah amen why
[25:06] didn't you do
[25:08] it why didn't you do it if you didn't I
[25:11] will be the next one down there with you
[25:14] says you got to obey the word amen
[25:17] hallelujah praise the Lord let me stress
[25:20] it again
[25:22] fair and
[25:24] pride of how you
[25:27] look is what
[25:29] influences most of us from really
[25:33] expressing when the Holy Ghost comes
[25:36] upon you in the middle of a service like
[25:38] this and you hear the word and you're
[25:41] supposed to Rejoice or amen or shout or
[25:45] do something to express that you got it
[25:48] instead you hold it you swallow
[25:52] it and make sure that you act
[25:55] appropriately and most dignifi the
[25:58] proper
[25:59] etiquet but the Holy Ghost is not here
[26:01] for that that's right the Holy Ghost is
[26:04] here to control our lives and make us
[26:07] into what he wants us to be and that's
[26:10] what it talks about dying to yourself
[26:13] you got to die out to yourself we not
[26:16] all of us here not that to ourselves yet
[26:19] amen we you don't really care I don't
[26:21] care what happened to the person next to
[26:22] me I'm concerned with what he's doing in
[26:24] my life praise the Lord and then you
[26:27] going to lose a lot of your mental
[26:29] health
[26:30] [Music]
[26:32] issues why do you think the government
[26:35] likes to have
[26:36] churches you think they're
[26:39] foolish they know that churches even the
[26:42] false ones that by some people by people
[26:45] going into churches and sitting there
[26:48] even for half an hour they lose a lot of
[26:51] their mental health issues psychiatric
[26:56] problems health professionals know that
[26:59] those kinds of things start to drift off
[27:02] people
[27:03] [Music]
[27:04] amen so there are natural benefits and
[27:08] then there are the supernatural benefits
[27:11] so make sure you're in the house of God
[27:13] and in the Church of God and when you
[27:15] come in here you going to have a battle
[27:17] how many of you
[27:18] know how many of you are battling
[27:21] today raise up your hands don't asame
[27:25] you were battling I know you were
[27:27] battling because I was
[27:28] about and I knew that while I was
[27:31] preaching the word the devil was trying
[27:32] to take me to the land of
[27:39] n
[27:40] amen but he can't stop the word of God
[27:43] from getting to your heart and that's
[27:45] why I made the remark I taught the Holy
[27:48] Spirit service would go a certain way
[27:50] but it went another way because I know
[27:53] I'm I'm here right sometimes I sense it
[27:55] other times I can see it amen no matter
[27:58] how you disguise it and try to you know
[28:02] there is not too big for you to put it
[28:03] so that the I will open so
[28:06] [Music]
[28:09] you so praise the Lord hallelujah well I
[28:15] know a preacher friend of mine powerful
[28:19] preacher well known in the United States
[28:22] in high
[28:23] places and him and I used to hang out
[28:26] together and what happened went to his
[28:29] local church and they were fixing the
[28:32] windows on the
[28:34] church um there several windows and it
[28:37] wasn't finished so they nailed up as we
[28:39] call it in the west zinc
[28:42] sheets right all these you may know what
[28:45] they are do Z sheets nail them up there
[28:48] just to block the windows so that you
[28:50] know people will come in and the rain
[28:52] will come in so the preacher is
[28:54] preaching and the preacher is preaching
[28:56] and he's sitting there he says John I
[28:58] was listening to that sermon I don't
[29:01] know when I fell asleep but my head just
[29:06] went hit that sheet and the the sound
[29:10] reverberate through the entire church he
[29:13] says but the presence of mine that my
[29:15] head came back up
[29:17] fast and I was looking around to see
[29:20] who so that they wouldn't know who
[29:22] actually had
[29:24] [Music]
[29:26] that amen
[29:28] and that's what happens everybody is
[29:31] trying to make sure that they act like
[29:34] they're not
[29:36] sleeping I am not the one falling asleep
[29:40] and to make sure that nobody finds them
[29:43] out or discovers this it's human amen
[29:48] praise the Lord but God knows I
[29:51] understand I'm not give you Liberty to
[29:53] fall asleep but I'm I'm just let you
[29:57] know that God understand and he knows
[30:00] everything about us but God wants every
[30:04] one of us to know turning a corner we
[30:08] need to know Joseph for ourselves am is
[30:12] that right not in the voice of God not
[30:15] in the CDs not by the Visions not by the
[30:19] stories but you has to make it your
[30:22] story where you can say this is my story
[30:26] this is my song I'm praising My Savior
[30:30] all the day long God bless you I don't
[30:32] know how this seron will bless you but I
[30:35] trust that it will
[30:38] bless
