TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good sunday morning friends indeed we are a blessed people to be able to come into the presence of god with thanksgiving and praise and honor to his glorious and wonderful wonderful name i'm thinking today of a beautiful uh song that tells us how that the move is on the move is on my lord the move is on the move is on my lord the move is on i can hear the rustling in the mulberry trees and i know i know i know the move is on god's spirit is certainly moving in our midst and in the world today i want to thank god that we serve a living god we do not serve a static god a god that remains at one place and in one time at any season of time but our god as the great song says our god is marching on oh this is something that too many have not really realized they sing the song but have no reality or revelation to themselves to recognize that indeed our god is marching on let us read our scripture for today and uh just speak on the word of god as we look into john the gospel of john chapter 3 and we would like to read it verses 7 and 8. of course this is the the pictorial of nicodemus coming to jesus by night this great dignified ruler not wanting to be seen that he needed christ he needed salvation he needed a change a transformation in his entire life whether it was his business life family life his social life he needed something to happen in his life something that no sadducee pharisee psychologist biologists or any of the other learned wise men of that day could solve his problem but somehow without reading it in a book without having any written proof by his knowledge of jesus he just had the feeling in his heart that if he came to jesus jesus could fix it jesus could solve the problem and so he came to jesus by night and this is a part of what jesus said to him as we read out of john chapter 3. marvel not that i said unto thee you must be born again the wind blew it where it listed and thou here is the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whether it goes so is everyone that is born of the spirit later of course we read where paul says sons of god children of god are led by the spirit of god let us pray our gracious heavenly father lord god of heaven and earth creator of all things lover of our soul redeemer of our beings o lamb of god we ask your grace and mercy today we pray you will bless us as we speak on your word give us divine utterance give us divine inspiration lord let the holy spirit draw near and speak to us a while that we may feed upon the living word of god the bread of life for we ask it in the name of our love beloved lord jesus christ whom beloved all our hearts amen and amen praise be to god hallelujah my brothers and sisters we live in a great day where we have heard so much about revivals and the moving of the holy spirit now i would like to speak on the subject of pull up your stakes pull up your stakes as intent stakes pull them up and let's get moving for our god is marching on now in our day and time that we live in we are hearing a lot of revivals revivals breaking that out in the south or a revival in a church over in our major cities a revival in the west or in the east somewhere but friends we are not supposed to have denominational revivals we are here to have genuine heaven sent god given revivals coming directly from the great holy spirit now to cope the great 20th century prophet we haven't had a real stirring no no no no sir don't think we have got revivals we haven't oh yes they've gotten millions and millions and millions of church members but not a genuine revival nowhere at all no the bride hasn't had a revival yet there has been no revival there no manifestation of god to stir the bride yet oh we are looking for it now it will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again praise god there was a time in the dim past in the mind of god when she was fully awake fully aware she knew what was happening what was going on and then with adamic sin the entire human race fell into the the sleep of sin or the sleep of spiritual death but the bible is telling us that it will take these seven unknown thunders to wake her up again of course in a simple manner of putting it the seven thunders of course is the voice of god seven number of perfection the perfect word of god the seven thunders the word first of course god's voice genesis 1 and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said spoken word but before that was spoken word it was a thought in the mind of god it was the unwritten word then it came to being or manifestation and a spoken word of god so we understand that the the first word was god god's unwritten word the unwritten word which is that the bible was literally written in the skies and there it was now think of it by faith hebrews 11. it tells us abel offered a better sacrifice by faith abraham left his country and went into a land where god had called him now you must understanding by faith faith is a revelation so by something that was revealed or something that was made known to them that was not yet written it was known to them what to do how did a bell know that it was a lamb that would be the perfect and acceptable sacrifice in the eyes and mind of god it was revealed to him that it was not a horse or a sheep or or a fish or flowers or fruits but a lamb that was to be slain how did he know it by revelation god made it known to him praise god hallelujah oh praise his name likewise with abraham it was by revelation that he would have heard the voice saying get up get out of your old country oh and go into the place where i have called you glory to god god's wonderful name amen and so god's bible for there was no written bible yet they couldn't go and open the bible and read the scripture and say oh the spirit is leading me to this scripture and telling me to do this this or that no it was the unwritten word not written yet but still leading his sons and his daughters as jesus said sons and daughters of god children of god are led by the spirit of god and the wind blew it where it listed no man no devil knows where it's going doesn't know where it goes or where it comes from but it moves god moves his spirit moves his children move under his divine inspiration and power of the great holy spirit amen so god's first bible was written in the skies they could look up into the skies written in the stars and they could see from what we call today the signs of the zodiac they could read the bible virgo the virgin birth of christ they could speak see of it clearly the twins are brought in there crab cancer sin evil the man with the water pop jesus pouring out the word of god on the entire human race and so on it was given to them to understand which of course the wise men in the days of jesus had some understanding of that so they were able to follow the star and now we find that abel and abraham had by revelation not my written word that was to come later but the real original way of following god's plan god god's will god's purpose but is by his supernatural event of grace choosing to whom he would reveal himself to listen there may be millions of people in this world but god chose you to reveal himself to he chose you as simple as you may be or as educated as you may be you are chosen of god hallelujah blessed is the man whom thou chooses and causes to draw nigh unto thyself so god in his divine choosing the same god said my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow hallelujah oh how are they going to know his voice if they never heard it before but somewhere deep in their soul there is planted an elected seed of god a germ of the living god planted in them that was way back before the foundation of the world remember friends we who are true elected believers not church members true elected believers oh we are not people of time we are not creatures of time only our body was born into time but you me others that are true elected seed the being the person on the inside your soul hallelujah that came from god almighty before the foundation of the world that is the reason why he says those that will really have a revelation are those whose names are written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world our god did not have to wait until you accepted him to know that you were gonna be one of his he knew you what he said to jeremiah i knew you before you were in your mother's belly and i called you raise you up and ordained you hallelujah to be a preacher to carry the word of god hallelujah oh may the great holy spirit expand these things to you that you might see what god is saying here in his word no but the word i'm trying to establish the fact the church world has established the fact that we are to believe the written word which we are supposed to but the written word is only a representation of the unwritten word or the thought that is in god's mind for me to speak i have a thought in my mind and then i speak it but before it was a spoken word it was a thought that is what i'm telling you god is taking his real elected seed and identifying that they are his by allowing them to be able to tap into his divine thoughts as he reveals them unto you now if you say oh god has revealed this to me and it does not line up or agree with the written word then you've got the wrong revelation christ is the mystery of god revealed tells you that clearly go back to the word and check what you are thinking or saying or the revelation you have received and then check it with the word to see whether it comes from the living god the word first written or shown as a sign in the stars so the patriarchs have no written bible from the time of abel to the time of moses there was no written bible not one syllable was written down it's moses that wrote the pentateuch the first five books of the bible god inspired him to write it so he wrote it how by revelation how could he know in the beginning god the spirit of god moved on the face of the waters and god said and he wrote down what god said and then he was told exactly what happened when it happened and he was able to write it down was that the knowledge of a man was that the mind of a man no he did that by the revelation of the holy spirit of which i'm speaking of now calling out to the true bride of christ the true elected seed of god to come back to that place where they go beyond the veil go beyond the veil of the written word into the unwritten word where god is making himself known in this hour blessed be his holy and his precious names no there it was no written word moses comes on the scene then they receive the writing of the word not right then but shortly after of course now we understand here that moses the christ the written and spoken word by moses and the various prophets then that word with moses not only was it uh unwritten but it met him in a burning bush spoke to him and allowed itself to be seen and when it could be perceived or when it could impinge on the human sight he was able to see him in the form of a pillar of fire and later when israel moved out of egypt and had to go into the wilderness the bible tells us that god was leading them by the pillar of fire which was the same unwritten word now in the form of a pillar of fire now they were led by that same great pillar of fire and god led them through the wilderness later on we recognize that that pillar of fire became flesh john 1 1 and the word was with god amen and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the same word which was a thought that was back there became fresh and walked among us and his name is jesus christ and so that word become jesus christ and it was the lord jesus christ himself who turned to peter and said peter flesh and blood who do you say that i am and peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god jesus answered said flesh and blood listen to the emphasis has not revealed this unto you but my father in heaven has revealed this unto you and upon this rock what rock the rock of revelation of who he is god almighty amen but it was by the instrumentality of revelation he said upon this rock i'll build my church on this principle this true foundation of genuine revelation of god speaking directly to his children in this day and in this hour praise god hallelujah and opening up their understanding to his word by taking away their spiritual amnesia upon this rock so then the church is built on what revelation let me say it another way the church is really or the true church's true foundation is the unwritten word the church is built on that part of the word that is not written oh praise god it can only be received given by revelation through the grace of god not by human study of man not by intellectual achievements of man but by the grace of almighty god blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah so that church of god the true church is birthed from the unwritten word or as we would say they revealed word of god for the hour now when we go back and look into the old days realize god moved in genesis 1. when we come to moses and israel the bible says god moved again moving israel out of egypt they got in the wilderness the pillar of fire began to lead them and the great holy spirit was moving again oh thank god for the moving of the holy spirit listen in the old days back there they put up their tents and there was a pillar of fair that led them praise god i'll i'm going to slide into my topic they put up their tents israel lived in tents they moved in tents in the wilderness now many of us or many of you who know about tents and of tempting in the wilderness tenting on the mountainsides hillsides lakesides wherever you may go it's a wonderful and beautiful uh uh operation something that we should love to do myself and some of the brothers in my earlier days would go up into the northern part of canada and northern ontario and there we would find a big beautiful lake set up our tent we'll go fishing beautiful just watch the moonlight coming over the lake watch the sun rise in the morning how beautiful that would be all glory to god hallelujah and there we would set up our tents and you know with the setting up of a tent it is necessary one of the most important things in setting up a tent is making sure you put down your tent stakes they must not be too shallow or too deep if they're too shallow the wind will pull them out if they're too deep then you'll have a hard time extracting them from the ground amen but israel lived in tents and every time the purifier moved they had to move or they had to pull up their stakes and that's what i'm talking about pull up your stakes and let's move on with god and that god has this wonderful way within your heart and within your life so they followed the great pillar of fire amen moses followed it israel followed the pillar of fire the word of god set on fire the revelation of the word of god to you when it is made known it sets your soul of fire it makes you want to know him more and love him in every possible way amen praise god now my friends that principle is lost today church of israel followed a pillar of fire back there moved on when it moved on but today's church doesn't want to move when god moves amen we come to a man by the name of martin luther and after the 1500 years i believe of the dark ages martin luther caught the revelation that the just shall live by revelation by faith amen oh my and he was a roman catholic priest and he came out of the roman catholic church and followed the purifier with tens of thousands of others with him oh my think about it brother sister oh praise god and so we know that he got out of the catholic church and he moved with god and after a while he got organized soon as he got organized he put down church stakes called lutronism and that's where he pitched his tent and laid his stakes down after him came john wesley and wesley saw god move with luther but you realize there was a further revelation not only must you be saved but you must live holy and so uh wesley did not just stay under that because under lutheranism because of what they were teaching which was the truth but the time had come for him to move on so he moved on with sanctification as god was revealing it to him amen praise god my friends let me say this there is no evidence in this bible of god having any organized religion whatsoever no organized church was ever formed by the true and the living god of course the catholic church says she's the mother church of course she says she is the first church and i want to say to you they are the mother church they are the first church yes in the sense that they are the mother of all organization religious organizations revelation chapter 17 you may read it there for yourselves when it speaks of her and her various protestant daughters various daughters that came out from her just go read revelation chapter 17. amen but wesley many nations were in moral decay and falling wesley saw it caught the revelation of god follow the pillar of fire himself francis ashbury many others anointed by the holy spirit god used them in a mighty way and as such my brothers after a while he also put his stakes in the ground and called himself a methodist all church methods begin to come into the church as he put his stakes into methodism the first thing you know once he organized once he put down those stakes the purifier just raised up and moved on again and when it moved the pentek of that day saw the move of god and followed the great purifier out of those denominations of that particular time and they moved on but what happened they have also organized as their movement began to crystallize they began to organize and they took their stake and nailed it down we believe speaking in tongues is the only initial or initial evidence of the holy spirit and nailed their stakes down now many years later that's proven of course not to be true it's false it's not the word of god it is an evidence but it's not the only initial evidence of the holy spirit my god let's go back to the word but can you tell them that to do that you are coming against their very foundational doctrine or their stake and you're trying to pull it out and they would stand for it because their entire denomination is built not on revelation but built upon their words built upon this stake that they place within the ground and now we see many churches built on the stakes they put in the ground the stakes of money the stakes of political organization the stakes as i've said of terms amen being the evidence and they use these stakes to differentiate themselves upon the face of the earth oh my think of it there they are their israel was intense with stakes driven in the ground in our modern times we see the various organizations take their stand or place their stake in the ground and say toms is the evidence here i stand so help me god justification sanctification that is the evidence and once they do that history proves it the bible proves it god's spirit affair moves on the spirit of god keeps moving on as the word of god unfolds for god is not a dead god our god is a living god and our god is marching on glory to god hallelujah amen so here is israel with their tents stakes driven in the ground here are these denominations here are the modern churches sticks driven in the ground and the pillar of fire right there hanging over them available for everyone to see or to recognize amen the first thing would happen the pair of fire would come and speak to moses and say moses i want them traveling over there or i want them going in this direction amen and every day he would have god's directive and they had no uh specific place where they can uh stop and say this is where we are no god's spirit was moving and they had no certain place well i see like today some may say well i i like this valley i think i'm going to stop over here no you may stop in that valley but the pair of fire our god is marching on oh oh there's a beautiful piece of land over there i'm going to build over there i'm going to pitch my tent over there that's what happened to lot the bible said lot pitched his tent near sodom he put down his stakes abraham was on the mountain he put his tanks near sodom later on he became mayor of sodom and that's what happens when you go on pitch your tent near the world yes sir next thing you know you're like them oh praise god hallelujah the pillar of fire keeps moving on amen god wouldn't let his people get settled down jesus himself said amen the wind blew it where it that no man not from whence it comes and where it's going but only he or her that is born of the holy spirit will receive that revelation that super knowledge given by god alone by his divine grace oh friend that is clearly a type here in the word of god amen there's a lot of people get so settled down in the world they get settled down in this present world which causes them to become worldly minded they get satisfied with their surroundings oh their surroundings may be consumptious and beautiful and marvelous comfortable and they get settled down and self-satisfied with themselves and maybe friends are while i'm speaking you may be thinking that you need to really settle down amen and settle your mind and and start to get real cozy with whatever it is that you are doing amen and you begin your planning of this your planning of that your planning of the other not that we are not to have our minor plans but the great planner the great leader a great guide is the blessed holy spirit to lead us and to guide us into all truth and show us things to come amen praise god the funny thing about it is that when we are planning planning planning not realizing that way back you're dying dying dying and dying in christ you're dying to your faith you're dying to your beliefs you're dying to the things you hold dear or once hold there you're starting dying to that amen oh turn your eyes upon jesus look full in this wonderful face and the things of this earth will grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and his grace amen praise god hallelujah now while israel was in the wilderness no doubt some of them drove their stakes into the ground too far too deep i believe the same thing is happening today with a lot of believers you're putting your hopes your faith your trust and everything in the world and in the things of the world and placing your confidence and placing your hopes putting down those stakes deep in to the world back there oh my yes sir and when the purifier began to move what happened term israel got the orders to move on i wanted to see this picture moses caused the uh men to blow the trumpet gather the tribes and they began to move out on their journey when they were moving out and moving on amen to what god was the revelation of what god was leading them to for it took revelation revelation revelation to take them into the promised land and today it will it takes us the same thing word on top of word on top of word on top of word revelation by revelation by revelation he does not give you all of it at one time but he reveals himself to you by his blessed holy spirit amen praise god but there were many of those jews many of those israelites they could not pull out the stakes out of the ground in time they could not pull them out while the rest of the tribe was moving on and moving out they could not get their stakes out in time oh my friends what a sad sight they got them out maybe but now they were alone there were targets as you know it's written in the scriptures your father's at manor in the wilderness and now they are dead dead because they would not pull up their stakes because they put their stakes too deep in the ground couldn't get them out in time or couldn't get them out and their bones with their families bleach within the wilderness you see you can't beat these types because many times being driven by our own human desire of what we can accomplish in this world or what we can accumulate in this world our ambitions that we can achieve within this world we don't realize how deeply sometimes we get ourselves attached to that and nailing down our stakes in these places and things that god when he calls you you are not ready and willing to pull up your stakes and move on with the true and living god may god open the eyes of your heart today for you to recognize that god spirit calling you and speaking to you to pull out pull up your stakes praise god hallelujah amen amen amen oh praise god how beautiful to know we are led by the holy spirit for the children of god are led by the spirit of god bible tells us in psalm 107 matter of fact during this coming week take the time to read psalm 106 psalms 107 chapters i'm speaking about chapter 106 chapter 107 and you'll find god speaking about israel there how they wandered in the wilderness in a lonely and solitary way but how god led them by the pillar of fire and guided them amen how wonderful his works how wonderful his name gave them water from the rock manor from on high you read it there in psalm 106 and some 107 and i believe you'll enjoy it as much as i did enjoy it also so these ones who could not get their stakes up no leader no pillar of fire to guide them none to take them out they bleached their bones bleached and they died in the wilderness amen my friends if the holy spirit while i'm speaking here were to reveal to you today what maybe you said or done yesterday and reveal to you that that was wrong you've got to be willing to pull up that stake that idea that belief that so-called teaching that maybe you've had for years you've got to be willing to pull up your stake and obey the great holy spirit oh oh i'm a catholic oh i'm a methodist i'm a i'm a baptist i'm i'm a presbyterian oh i belong to this or i belong pull up your stakes and move with the holy spirit let the holy ghost guide you and bring you into all truth as the word of god said that he certainly will if we surrender ourselves to him amen hallelujah now tomorrow god may reveal to you uh another revelation or further revelation will come and show to you that what you received yesterday was only partial revelation you've got to be willing obedient humble to swallow all your foolish human pride all your self-importance whatever it is that you attach yourself to and move on with the great holy spirit of the living god let him lead you and guide you into all truth and move you into the fullness of the word my friends i'm not willing to settle down here not even where i am spiritually with my understanding with the revelation given to me by the holy spirit i am not willing to settle down here i want to pull up my stakes i want to move on with god i'm bound for the promised land i'm bound my friends for a rapture i am bound for the great gathering the great meeting in the presence of our heavenly father once again for his glory amen praise the name of the lord oh praise god you know it's written in the scriptures i think it's first corinthians 10. you'll find it again there where god speaks about leading our fathers through the wilderness eating from the eating from the manna that fell from above drinking from the smitten rock yet their bones bleached the very wilderness because why they should have never settled down they should never droven stakes but they should have followed the great holy spirit amen hallelujah these things are written in the word of god for our admonition for our guidance there are scriptural examples given to us that we may know how to behave ourselves and how to understand the moving of the holy spirit and to watch how god is moving and to follow his leading like david did when i see the moving of the wind in the mulberry trees the leaves of the trees i know i know i know the move of god is on that is how the true believer must be praise be the god hallelujah amen praise god they should not have settled down and because they start driving in stakes getting self-satisfied full of ourselves full of yourself i know the word i know the message i i'm learning in the message i study it for hours i read the bible day and night i fast i pray i do this i do that not knowing that's not by works of righteousness which we have done but by his grace and his mercy that he has called us or that he reveals or make makes known himself to us so god my friends became displeased with them and it's written in the scriptures some 101 106 verses 24 to 27 tells us that and the lord overthrew them in the wilderness they were overthrown in the wilderness in other words something took them over they were taken over whether it's by a thought by this by that whatever but they were overthrown if i might mention some were overthrown by the golden calf uh which would be symbol symbolic of money others were overthrown by their complaining others were overthrown by their gang saying others were overthrown by their murmuring various things that they were overthrown in the middle of the wilderness now you've got to see this clearly my brothers my sisters hallelujah something overthrew them something took them over they were tired they were kind of giving up with this message with this word we're trying getting loose or we say loosey-goosey and relaxing the discipline and the guidelines of the holy spirit oh we can't stay in this place we can't stay under the influence of this message we can't do that we got to be different or whatever that was their thought at that particular time but you see god had a purpose with moving them like that what was god doing he said i took you in the wilderness it's to try you and to prove you amen amen and so he uses satan to try to improve you he you satan to attempt you uses satan to bring trials brings all kind of tribulations brings to you even sins trespasses satan brings to you and god allows it because he's trying you and proving you by all kinds of temptations strife and uh all kinds of comparisons and competitions and everything else you praise god you can carry that thought on but satan god allows him to test you try us and prove us that we are his own hallelujah many times when the holy spirit wants to lead us to a consecrated life we grieve the holy spirit we resist the holy spirit we fight against the holy spirit we will not listen to what he has to say to us and so many were overthrown in the wilderness they lost their desire for this word for god for this message they lost their fire they lost their enthusiasm they lost their first love amen that revival that the seventh thunders is supposed to bring in their soul cooling off cooling off somewhere they lost it because satan was allowed to overthrow them in this present world in which we're living now the bible tells us that more the nation of moab which were like uh brothers to israel they were a good nation they were a great nation and a brother to israel but you see even though there were religious as like israel and had the sacrifices just like israel and could make the offerings just like israel that was wonderful but it was israel by election was the one that god was leading by his holy spirit amen and that's the problem in the world today the true believer may be criticized maybe called all manner of names in front of their faces behind their backs wherever let me do that not realizing they're falling into that more bite spirit not realizing as religious as moab was they failed to get the revelation that israel was holding on or was held by god's election that was the thai post that held them to the fullness of the word amen oh praise god and sometimes we as true believers we staggering around we look like we're making mistakes we looks like we're struggling in our walk sometimes but let me tell you it's god himself that's leading you that's god himself that's guiding you amen praise god but on the outside they think you are just wiggling around and moving around like that my friends but it's the holy spirit himself that is leading you amen thank god you are walking and moving with the smitten rock right beside you the open word with revelation gushing out to quench your thirst and quench you that you may never thirst again your soul will feel so refreshed in the presence of the lord no revelation fail to recognize the spoken word the smitten word the rock christ smitten on calvary open up and revealing himself to you that you might know him in the power of his resurrection and in the fellowship of his suffering amen the life came out of that word that was smitten there in the wilderness water came out type of the word they smote him on calvary amen isaiah 53 oh he was wounded for our transgressions and out of him came what came out the life of the word the revelation of the word to lead us and to guide us into this day and moab could not see the revelation of the word but they allow themselves to be led by ideas and the thoughts of men rather than to be led by the revelation of the holy spirit i'm going to wind this up now i'm going to wind this up my friends praise god amen remember friends if we are to pull up these stakes we must remember we are not settled here world is not our home we're just a passing through and our treasures are laid up in our home beyond the blue oh praise god forevermore we are nothing but pilgrims strangers paul says we are aliens here in the world today they may call you up you from the odd fellows or rejects you're out of place with that kind of faith that you are teaching or talking about but praise god we are on our journey into the promised land a beautiful picture of the church today thank god i am no longer in egypt i'm no longer in the world amen i've already pulled up my stakes and i'm heading to the promised land i've already come through the red sea and i'm headed to the promised land i've looked back over my shoulder and seen the life i lived and i could see the worldliness moving in the blood of jesus like pharaoh's army drowned under the red sea so has my sins your sins of them that believe drowned in the blood of jesus christ all the hotel hideouts that you had all the drugs that you used to use oh praise god all the drinks at the bar the bar rooms all the smokes all of the womanizing all of the man stealing all of the of of the so-called dignified high-class cocktails and the champagne parties and the happy hours that you would have my friends all the get-together and enjoying the pleasures of sin only for a season i look back you look back let us look back and see them just being tumbled up and drowned in the blood of jesus christ the red sea of the blood and that all your sins buried in the sea of god's forgetfulness never to be remembered anymore thank god all over all task masters slave masters that bound us and held us under their grip now loosed we are free by the grace of god and to walk in the light of the day and we are on our road to the promised land may god help us that we don't get caught up in ourselves and don't drive down our stakes and start putting boundaries organization denominational or even not claiming to be a denomination and yet putting boundaries like that let's be careful we don't put any boundaries that we may drive those stakes we don't drive stakes down and and uh create denominational boundaries whatsoever more but ask god to fill your heart with his love that you may open your arms wide like he opened it on calvary's rugged cross open it to all brothers all sisters all creatures o great and small throughout the land throughout the world and draw them into the great mysterious mystical fellowship family and body of our lord jesus christ may god bless you everyone may the great holy spirit overshadow you watch over you in this coming week and save you now if you are not saved ask god
