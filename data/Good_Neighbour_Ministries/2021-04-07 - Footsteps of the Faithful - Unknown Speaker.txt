TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] praise the lord it's wednesday again it's bible study time again and we are in the church age series tonight's study will be from revelation chapter 2 verse 13. and the topic will be in the footsteps of the faithful this is another broadcast in the ongoing series of this seven church ages may god bless our time together or study together and take us into a clearer understanding of what god has said to us in his word let us ask his blessing and for his help our gracious heavenly father we commit ourselves to thee wholeheartedly sincerely and we draw nigh respectfully and reverently to the o great invisible king may the great holy spirit anoint us lord that we may be a temple a vessel for your use lord speak lord as you are the same today as we surrender ourselves to thee now bless all those that speak and all them that hear wherever they may be for we ask it in the name of our lord jesus christ amen and amen our scripture reads thus i know thy works and where thou dwellest even where satan's seat is and thou as fast my name and has not denied my faith even in those days wherein antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where satan dwelleth praise be to god hallelujah i know thy works first of all just think on the statement of who is speaking this is not man speaking this is not the accumulation of man's wisdom knowledge experiences or imagination or whatever speaking this is the lord god almighty speaking god who sees all knows all he says i know i know i'm aware he's conscious in every moment of time and space and of the eternities god is saying i know and in particular he wants you to know i know thy works he knows everything else but now he wants to speak particularly on your works of what your life seed has produced and he is saying i know thy works hallelujah and where thou dwellest even where satan's seat is oh my these saints were in a real pressure cooker they were in a bind they were in a place where they were asked to serve god right in the middle of where satan's earthly seat we know his spiritual seat or headquarters is in the valley of death or hell his natural seat is here up on the earth now i know your works and where you have to dwell what you have to put up with because you are living in the middle of where satan's seat is but i want to praise god that they were not left alone but the god who knows is also aware just as he was in the time of elijah when he says lord god i'm the only one that loves you and serves you and knows you like many followers of brother branham's message will think we are the only ones that believe but you'll find in the book of kings when god spoke about elijah he said to him no no no no no i have seven thousand hidden up and they are where did i hide them they're in jezebel's palace and they're eating from her table and i'm protecting them while they're in there eating from her table but yet serving me and believing me not believing her lies not believing her deceits not believing her seductions not believing all her offers of wealth and money and power and position you know but they believe me and they're all to my word hallelujah and god protected them kept them watch them let me make an application here this is speaking of in this day in this hour in which we live where a lot of people that has believed the elijah spirit prophet of this hour and of this age and feel so exclusive to themselves that we are the only ones who have this revelation and understanding of the prophet and of the message and of jesus christ that has been revealed to us and god is saying no no no as he did to elijah as he does to us now he is saying no no no i've got thousands hidden up in those denominations i've got them they're eating some of their doctrine the parts of it that are true and are good and unnutritious i have them in there and they're eating from it and they're partaking of it and they're doing that until i call them out until they call them to stand beside the elijah messenger and message of this day and in this hour and until that time i want you to know that you are not alone in the fight amen i want every believer in this message to know that in this hour to love respect and understand what is going on with our denominational brethren some are blinded some are deaf some are dumb spiritually speaking many times not because of their own will but the denominational system has them trapped and has them having a mouth but speak not air but care not and so god has to come and enlighten their minds and their hearts but for the time being we must love them pray for them and understand that god has allowed some of them to remain right there feeding on what they are receiving taking the parts of the truth and feeding on it until their hour has come for at his appointed time then god will send forth his sons and of his daughters yes i know thy works hallelujah and when god says this he is saying that of both vines the true vine i know thy works and to the false vine don't think you are hidden up and i'm not seeing i know thy works of what you are also doing therefore this message of i know thy works will bring joy and gladness to the hearts of one group but on the other hand it will strike terror into the hearts of those that disbelieve and misbelieve the word of god hallelujah for though we are saved by grace apart from works true salvation will bring works with it works of appreciation to god works of love to god works that comes of gratitude to him and the sacrifice and the price that he paid for our redemption so true salvation works will not give you salvation but true salvation will produce godly works out of that life first john 3 7 little children let no man deceive you he that do it work at righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous hallelujah so you see what a man or a woman is is what he or she does we we manifest the works of the life or the seed that is in us listen to the word james 3 11 does a fountain send fort at the same place sweet water and bitter amen and again in matthew 12 33-35 either make the three good and the fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit also corrupt for the tree is known by its fruit all you generation of vipers how can you being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speak it a good man out of the good treasure that is in the heart bringeth forth good things and the evil man from the evil treasures that is in his heart bring it forth evil things hallelujah now if a man is truly born again of god's seed the incorruptible seed then he will produce the word but then if he is of the corruptible seed then he will produce evil works first peter chapter 1 verse 23 so your works or you produce what kind of a life that is in you is what one will manifest amen praise god so certainly brother sister we know that the word of god will judge us when we come to the end of our way jesus christ who is the word will judge us when we come to the end of the way and i want you to know we are everyone being judged now god's camera is taking not just the skin but it's taking a picture of you now and your attitude to the word of god god is recording that now so if i believe him now if you believe him now you will not go into the judgment but shall have the light of life you'll have eternal life so my friends but if you believe not or in other words if you do not receive the revelation coming out of the word how will you live how will you know how to live without him leading and guiding you in the way that you should live therefore my friends let us be judged by the word now so that we will not be judged then when he does become uh before us person a person not just written word but living word standing before us to judge us in respect of his word i know thy works hallelujah for even now the word of god is judging us discerning us detecting what the bible tells us in hebrews 14 12 amen 4 12 how that the word of god searches the heart and intentions of the spirit he knows you he knows me he knows every one of us hallelujah cuts asunder separates the carnal from the spiritual and makes us into living epistles to be read um of all men and known among men for the life we live to the glory of god yes i know thy works hallelujah if you are fearful of whether you are living right then fulfill the word of god if you are wondering when you come to the end of your way you will hear the words depart from me you cursed into everlasting darkness or whether you will hear the words come thou good and faithful servant enter into the joy of your lord then let us fulfill the word of god let us live by the word of god and surely god will bless you god will praise you amen for the word of god is the standard by which we will all be judged it is the standard it is the plumb line it is the measuring stick by which god will be able to judge us there is no other standard there is nothing else to mess yourself by but by the word of god therefore if we want to know where where what is our standing with god why not look into god's mirror of his word as james suggests within the bible praise god hallelujah there he is the word itself examines our lives checks up our lives detects discerns and with surgical skill separates the carnality from the spirituality and points us directly to the living word before us hallelujah making us to live by god's blueprint that he has given us that we might together build the temple not seen by man's hands but built by the hands of the holy ghost to the glory of the living god hallelujah amen let us walk in the footsteps of those who have already lived that life and crossed over if we were to walk in their footsteps then my brother my sister we will be judged by the same judgment they were judgement by endure the same persecution endure the jibes they the gabs this scoffings the mockings the the jailings whatever words we stand by it and walk by the word and joyfully holding to god's unchanging hand amen through difficult times serve the lord through trouble sometimes serve the lord through all manner of times hold to the word of god and worship him and serve him in spirit and in truth there's so many have a lot of spirit the pentecostals have a lot of that but he says he's not asking about you worship him only in spirit being spirited about it which we ought to be but you must have a balance of spirit and truth you rejoice in the truth and that puts you in the spirit so but you must first have the truth you don't think you're gonna jump you're gonna run you're gonna shout you're gonna have music and you're gonna beat down the truth no the truth must first be revealed to you and then all those other things will be added unto you praise god hallelujah amen hallelujah one i know thy works i know what works and actions you're producing by believing my word and secondly i know your works that you are holding fast to my name hallelujah that is the second thing you you do not just hold to the word but all to his name hallelujah to whom can we go thou hast the words of eternal life holding fast to the word of god amen not hanging on like some people you ask them well how are you doing well you know i'm just hanging on no we're not just hanging on with the word of god hoping hoping that we're going to be saved hoping that we're not going to go to hell no those kinds of fears are gone completely amen we have no fatalistic ideal or idea of where we are going who we are where we come from praise god who our father is what of your future oh my we are certain your future is clear though the presence of the living god with us amen we are holding fast to his name holding fast to his strength glory to god we are holding fast to the assurance given to us by the holy spirit amen that we are one in him and one with him praise god as his bride adam's bride was in his side and she was one with him we are in christ we are one with him now man manifest by the presence of the living god and the will of god hallelujah amen we are standing here tonight with the certainty and the sure surety of sins forgiven glory to god and we bear the name of christian in testimony amen to that my brother sister hallelujah we borrow knees to know our name amen no matter what wonderful no matter how great it could be patrick it could be mary it could be sarah it could be gene we bound on our knees to no other name it could that name could be elizabeth that name could be this whatever we bow to no other name but the name of jesus christ oh praise god we will not bend we will not bow we will not burn oh we hold to god's name god's word and for this hour this time we hold to god's unchanging hand hallelujah amen praise god our tongues will speak nothing else but the truth and the will of god we have no fork town we have not the tongue of a deceitful lying serpent but we have the tongue of god hallelujah not tongues that they are talking about but amen but we have that tongue that confesses the name of jesus christ is lord and lord alone and everything whatsoever we do we do it in the name of all lord jesus christ hallelujah and because we name his name we separate ourselves from all uncleanness all iniquity all evil all wrongdoing and when we make mistakes which we will for we are still in our flesh we are not out of here we still will make mistakes not presumptuously but if we sin we have an advocate with the father we have a lawyer jesus christ who will argue our case plea the blood and forgive us of our sins and of our iniquities praise god hallelujah we stand upon the word of god and we are willing to die for this word in this day and for this hour because we are promised and we have this assurance of a better resurrection when we cross the river or when we pass through the valley of shadow of death into the valley of death that we will come to this place where we have a better resurrection no wonder the song says take the name of jesus with you child of sorrow and avoid it will joy and comfort give you take it then wherever you go yes precious name oh how sweet hope of earth and joy of heaven oh precious name oh how sweet hope of earth and joy of heaven think of it way back in the second century they were already using the words father son and holy ghost they were already propounding teaching bringing into doctrine paganism being inserted into genuine christianity preaching a gospel of many gods preaching and teaching the polytheistic idea meaning many polytheistic idea of three gods and later made it a and sanctioned it as an official doctrine in the false church not in the true church but it was propounded propagated and pronounced as a as a a doctrine as official doctrine within the ranks of the false church would not not be long until they expunged or took away the name of jesus christ and subtly cunningly substituted in the place of that name lord jesus christ they're substituted father son and holy ghost titles satan's sleight of hand it was a hand trick of it it was satan which has a sleight of hand slipping around with titles and a name and trying to replace the name of the lord jesus christ with father son and holy ghost but of course we know that those are not names they're only titles amen but yet many apostasize or fell away from the true faith many embraced that doctrine of father son and holy ghost as they do to this day that is why the bible tells of mystery babylon the mother of harlots her daughters all these denominations that have come out from the catholic church and have become protestants so called they came out but they still embrace the doctrine of their mother they still embrace the trinitarian doctrine of many gods now look if you tell one lie more lightly you'll tell too and if once you tell one lie you tell two then you can tell any amount after that once the devil got them to shift from believing what god had said hero is real i the lord thy god and one lord and could shift them to believing in two three gods after a while he can get you believing in a million gods he can have you believe in everything else so don't look at the hindus or or some other group of people that believe in gods with many heads many hands and or many gods because it's the same thing if you fail in one then you're guilty of all you move off the foundation of one god to three gods you can act any other god don't you see certain denominational churches can go into any country and still be accepted because those priests and those teachers realize that what they are teaching of their many gods is just the same thing as you with your three so they can get along with that real good but you come along preaching only one now it gets the devils back up that cat who was so nice and and so beautiful and nice to stroke when you come and you bring the truth up the word of god that this one god and the name is jesus christ all of a sudden that denomination claws come out then all of a sudden starts to scratch and ready to cheer and destroy call your names put you in the mud and draw you down as much as it could you see there are daughters of their old mother mystery babylon which is not one denomination but babylon is the entire system now you can take it from this point of view the commercial system of mr babylon the educational system of mr babylon the political system of mr babylon and the religious system of mystery babylon so it's one great worldwide encompassing system controlled by satan oh my friends that god has called us out of babylon oh praise god our hearts rejoice our tongues are made to laugh we are like them that dream hallelujah come out god says and we come out from babylon by the power of the holy spirit and the unfolding revelation of the word of god oh take god amen or praise god while they are baptizing using the titles of god instead of his name and deceiving those poor people that they have a genuine baptism when it is not so it's contrary to the word of god you will not find in your bible any of the apostles baptizing anybody anywhere in the bible in the titles of father son and holy not even peter when they ask him unto what shall we be baptized he said be baptized in repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ it's in your bible you can read it again and again and again and again for there is no other name given on the heaven but the name of our lord jesus christ and so the little flock of jesus that faithful few that follow in the footsteps of the faithful apostles and prophets that have gone before us that faithful few have come in obedient submission humility consecration to be baptized in the name of their husband jesus christ is the name hallelujah we don't want to be baptized into what he is he's a mechanic he's a carpenter he's he's a painter no that's not his name god is her father god came as a son god is spirit and he is the holy spirit that's what he is but that name is the lord jesus christ and we come to receive his name as his bride as his people to carry his name with faith with confidence with pride knowing that in him we move and have our being thank god hallelujah so many are dishonoring that name today turning uh turning and taking three gods bowing down before idols changing his name into titles amen my friends but thank god like saint martin who held to the word of god and god bore him witness by signs by wonders by the salvation of many souls that same god is still effectual amongst his people and in the hearts and in the lives of his believers and we as believers honor him through the word of god yes i know thy works i know thy works that you hold to my word that you hold to my name and thirdly i know your works that you are not denying my faith anyone comes and asks you about the faith that dwells within you you do not deny your faith but you boldly stand and declare that you are a son of god i am a child of god i am a child of god i am a child of god i wash my robes in the crimson fountain i am a child of god i am a child of god for we have washed our robes in the crimson fountain i am a child of god hallelujah or there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins where sinners plunge beneath that flood lose all their guilty stain even the dying thief rejoice to see that fountain in his day and here may i the vile as he wash all my sins away oh thank god tonight glory to god thou hast not denied my name praise god hallelujah amen amen praise god listen to peter acts chapter 3 verse 16 when the lame man was there in the name of jesus in his name and in his fate that made this man hold fed through his faith amen so the name of jesus and the faith of jesus made this man whole you see they are still believing they are saved by faith in jesus but we are speaking about receiving the faith or revelation of jesus hallelujah flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this unto you hallelujah faith is a revelation we're not talking about just believing but we're talking about having a understanding a revelation from the word of god the faith of jesus christ the name of jesus and the faith of jesus not just faith in jesus i repeat but the faith of jesus hallelujah that's the faith that's the perfect faith that's the rapture in faith that's resurrection faith and resurrection power working and moving in the life of the believer hallelujah not only as the seed word but as living word for this day amen praise god hallelujah amen my friends this is the faith that the lord is speaking of revelation 2 13 you have not denied my faith his faith my faith he said his faith is not just faith in him praise god but his own faith the faith of jesus christ in the heart of his believers that they can be they can believe and trust him with incredibly impossible so-called they can trust him for anything this is the creator the fate of your creator the faith of him in you that you yourself don't know how you could actually have that kind of a faith that kind of a understanding that kind of clarity coming from the spirit of the living god romans 12 13 to every man is given a measure of faith by grace are you saved through faith and that faith is not of yourself it is a gift of god and it's james 2 1 my brethren have not the faith of our lord jesus with respect of persons hallelujah you see the churches which the satan working through the churches in that first and second century were trying to subtly humanize salvation adding on a little bit of good works adding on a little bit of this and a little bit of that instead of being able to say salvation is of the lord salvation is a gift of god salvation is election it's revelation by the holy spirit not of the works of man not to the will of man not of the blood of men but of the blood of christ hallelujah that takes place within our heart hallelujah amen so what the word the devil was trying to do through his church franchise was to subtly push away and hide from the people the doctrine of election that if you are a true seed of god you did not just begin now you did not just get salvation now you were always saved in him but the word opens up to you for you to recognize that you are not just a creature of time but you come from eternity hallelujah you were lost in time but god has brought the light of his word to oatmeal rised for you to recognize where you come from and therefore you have to go back where you come from for no man can ascend up to heaven if and except he first came down from heaven praise god hallelujah we're going back where we come from just like the rain has to go back where it comes from the sun pulls it right back where it comes from and the son of god will pull you right back where you'll come from when you trust in him oh glory to god hallelujah amen and when they push aside that doctrine of election it opened wide the church doors and everybody can run in and say they're saved they just have to go and cry a little bit at the altar and say lord i'm for sorry for my sins and they may be sincere but if they don't have the seed sincerity without the seed doesn't save you my friends only if there's a life on the seat of god placed there without you having to do anything to get it it's a gift of god then it comes together seed sincerity repentance salvation god opens up the door for you praise god but they pushed away the doctrine of election open up their doors give them great numbers lots of money lots and altering big names largest churches in the land why because they push away the doctrine that doctrine of election and open wide the doors for everything snakes frogs tadpoles spiders all kinds of things to come in the church rats wolves and all kinds of sneaky snakes to come in monkeys pirates to come in inside of the door amen when they rejected that doctrine of election hallelujah and then it shifted from all those instead of having the people believe all of the word they subtly shift them away to believe their church tenants their church doctrines their church teachings and if their church teachings sounds like the word even has part of the word but they change one little hair and one little there person doesn't detect it because they're trusting that leadership that that that church fundamentals that were given to them is the truth and so they take it all and let me use a term here swallowing it like a fish wool hook line and sinker they put a little meat over the hook drop it down the person's truth and they believe it all because they're seeing one little thing that may be true and they swallow the meat but there's a hook in it and there it is my friends oh god have mercy they push away never mind the word this is what our church believes and get the people to hold to that and so there was a period of rapid degradation from the word of god and they drifted away from god's word hallelujah amen today's church is filled with a lot of people that that only mentally believe it's true their mind can process the bible their mind can process english and they can say oh that's logical that's true but it's not a revelation to the heart by the holy spirit amen we cannot be saved except by the faith of jesus christ himself or the revelation of jesus christ himself for upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it amen not by endorsing the virgin mary not by endorsing a certain church doctrine then i even go to endorse i believe in the blood of jesus it's not even being faithful in just going to church are faithful to taking communion and you're not reborn at all because in the first place you have not yet received light from heaven an epiphany from god a revelation by the holy spirit oh praise god forevermore amen human faith is not enough for me to say i believe that's your human faith amen that's not enough it takes the very revelation or faith of the son of god to drop into our hearts so that we can receive that lord of glory into our temple his temple not made with human hands no you're not you are the temple of the living god oh my your body is the temple of the living god a living faith a living god because we live by the faith of the son of god paul did not say he lived by faith in the son of god but he said i live by the faith of the son of god that has given his life for me and keeps me living in christian victory hallelujah it's he that's keeping me it's not me keeping myself going around and feeling i have to have the strength to keep myself no i am always willing to cry out lord help me lord please forgive me lord cleanse me lord provide for me everything i cast my cares upon him and i trust him he cares for me hallelujah praise god living by faith in jesus above oh praise god i know thy works that you have not denied my faith you have kept the truth alive by carrying my name hallelujah and thus you are counted worthy to be one with him and we have set forth in the word an example of one such person whom the bible describes as and to pass my faithful martyr this is a scriptural example of one who lived by the plum line one who walked in the footsteps of the faithful who have gone before us oh praise god this brother his name is only mentioned here inscribed in holy scripture and what it mentions is his faithfulness unto the lord he was a christian a real believer he had the name of jesus he had the faith of jesus and he live by the faith of our lord jesus oh praise god we take god for an example as our brother antipas maybe all trust the word of god listen to james have not the faith of our lord jesus christ with respect of persons oh praise god we should all be like stephen in the book of acts full of faith and power or praise god going forth in the name of jesus christ amen hallelujah not respecting persons because of power position color religion whatever but hold of god's unchanging word and his unchanging hand amen praise god taking a stand and i would turn back i have took my stand many years ago and i've been running for jesus a long time and i'm not turning back but i'm holding the gods unchanging hand amen yes philip died but he died like a bell and his in his his blood still speaks to this hour to this day giving testimony hallelujah and witness to god because the names are written in the word antipas a bell stephen it's written in the word of god hallelujah glory to god amen and their voices speak though it appears like they're dead yet they live for their speaking by and through the word by the holy spirit though amen praise god so take god another faithful martyr another faithful one a servant of the lord was led to his rest for believing the word of god satan did not triumph over him even as he did not triumph over the lord jesus when he tried to kill the prince of peace the moment he thought he won he actually lost amen for satan was disspoiled destroyed and attacked his kingdom was ransacked as i preached last sunday jesus went down into the valley of death took away the prisoners that were in there and set them free by the power of almighty god hallelujah amen and saw the blood of enterprise and and the cry of that voice of the spirit from enterprise is now in the hearts of thousands of believers who will also take up their cross and follow the lord jesus christ all my friends may god bless you may the lord keep you on cause's face to shine upon you and grant you peace as we walk in the footsteps of the faithful i'm remembering the story of one man who drank a lot and one winter dale out here in north america he decided to go to the bar to get a drink and he went out into the snow walking going to the bar and happened to look behind and what did he see there was his son slipped out of the door and was walking behind him and was putting his footsteps into the father's footprints walking behind his father putting his feet in his father's footprints my friends that father fell into tears and turned his life to christ and took his boy back to the home never to drink again never to live the life of the world again never to carouse again repenting before god making his life right with god asking for the forgiveness of sins and was never the same again my friends we are found walking in the footsteps of the faithful following peter and paul enter pass and many others that have been faithful or the faithful through all the ages god bless you take up your cross and follow jesus take up your cross every day don't be ashamed to say that you know him come the cost take up your cross and follow him god bless your friends take up your cross and follow jesus as we walk together in the footsteps of the faithful god bless you [Music] you
