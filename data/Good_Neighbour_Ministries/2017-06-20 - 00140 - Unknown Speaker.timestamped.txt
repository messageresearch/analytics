[0:01] right um you'll be able to see a
[0:03] quotation from brother brandham in it
[0:06] and uh wonderful scriptures and
[0:09] blessings to you on this marvelous day
[0:12] and trust that every father in here will
[0:14] feel blessed of the Living God
[0:20] [Applause]
[0:23] Amen uh just a few things uh we're
[0:27] changing one of our procedures and and
[0:30] that is that uh when we are leaving the
[0:34] sanctuary we want to leave the sanctuary
[0:38] reverently quietly uh uh and uh with a
[0:42] sense of sincerity after the service
[0:45] right like brother BR said we shouldn't
[0:47] leave joking while we leaving chewing
[0:51] gum and whatever else while we're
[0:53] leaving not that I know that that was on
[0:56] here but I'm just saying we should leave
[0:58] with reverence like you tip toing out in
[1:01] the presence of angels amen
[1:04] amen and I will no longer be standing at
[1:08] the back door because what has been
[1:09] happening at the back door of the
[1:11] sanctuary here rather I will go in in
[1:16] the for you where I will greet you in
[1:18] there amen are you getting that now okay
[1:22] I'll go in the for you and the reason
[1:24] for that is we don't want to back up
[1:26] where you're talking to me and I'm
[1:29] talking to you you and the rest of
[1:31] people are waiting and meanwhile we have
[1:34] other people who have been blessed by
[1:37] the message blessed by the worship and
[1:40] they want to spend it doesn't matter
[1:43] whether it's 2 minutes 5 minutes or 10
[1:45] minutes meditating before they get up to
[1:49] leave the presence of the Lord so we
[1:52] want to honor the Lord we want to honor
[1:56] that praise the Lord and we want to keep
[1:59] the sanctuary
[2:00] as a place where God comes and meets
[2:04] with us am brother Brandon said do you
[2:07] know if you like allocate a certain
[2:10] place whether it's your prayer closet or
[2:12] a tree or wherever and you and you start
[2:16] meeting the Lord there let's say uh 6:00
[2:20] 5:00 in the morning he says you know
[2:23] what he'll be there before you waiting
[2:26] on
[2:27] you so if we honor this place as a place
[2:32] where we come to meet with God it's not
[2:35] the building but it's him we honor it we
[2:39] act appropriately enough we invite his
[2:42] presence and then he'll come and draw
[2:46] near to us and we'll experience more of
[2:49] the presence of God and we'll honor him
[2:52] in that way
[2:56] [Applause]
[3:01] and that starts from this
[3:04] Sunday okay that starts from this Sunday
[3:08] so if the deacons know that you're
[3:11] hanging back and you're still in the
[3:13] sanctuary talking or whatever they will
[3:17] gently but firmly walk you out lead you
[3:20] out or ask you to go out right and don't
[3:25] take it as an offense because there's no
[3:28] partiality
[3:29] in
[3:30] God God deals with all of us in the same
[3:33] way praise the Lord may the Lord richly
[3:36] bless you and I'm happy to look and see
[3:39] all your beautiful wonderful handsome

[3:48] getting older but then we get a little
[3:50] silver on the here some people look down
[3:53] and that but it makes some people look
[3:55] even better you know praise the Lord so

[6:57] thee God bless you please be
[7:03] seated
[7:06] Hallelujah
[7:08] now as we celebrate uh Father's Day uh
[7:13] today we specifically of course want to
[7:16] talk about fathers uh mothers have
[7:19] already had their
[7:21] day and uh you know that's all right uh
[7:26] I went into Sears the other day and when
[7:29] I walked in I said uh where's the where
[7:32] the men's stuff and it's all in the
[7:39] corner I couldn't hardly find B stuff I
[7:43] said what I said you mean that you
[7:46] redesign the place but this entire floor
[7:50] is the women's stuff and you've got us
[7:53] men way in the
[7:54] back and you said well that's the way
[7:57] they did it I said oh see seems like
[7:59] that's the way the whole world is going
[8:02] is that right praise the Lord at least I
[8:04] got some brothers agreeing with me here
[8:08] amen I got my back up praise the Lord
[8:12] hallelujah but that's the way the world
[8:14] is going but that's not the way God is
[8:17] going you know the prophets have spoken
[8:20] Isaiah the seven women will take hold of
[8:23] one man you know the Bible tells us in
[8:26] Revelation one power is coming into
[8:29] power women will come in the power it
[8:32] prophecies women will control even from
[8:34] the White House and that is to tell you
[8:38] that the carnal Natural Woman power will
[8:41] increase amen right but at the same time
[8:46] while he's saying about women increasing
[8:48] in power and stuff like that it's
[8:51] telling you also in the reverse that men
[8:53] will be
[8:56] Dishonored don't get quiet now I'm
[8:59] telling you the truth man will start to
[9:01] be Dishonored discarded cast aside
[9:05] thought about as a
[9:08] spar he me I know the husband's get
[9:13] say I
[9:15] know like you brothers can't say but
[9:18] this is what I'm here for let Arrows fly
[9:21] at me praise the Lord because I have the
[9:24] same what is in trueu right you agree
[9:28] with me isise the Lord yes oh this is
[9:32] the it's not atmosphere like let me say
[9:35] in your home this is the atmosphere
[9:38] that's in the world and that those
[9:40] Spirits are coming down and they're
[9:43] taking control of who soever will
[9:46] surrender themselves to them amen while
[9:49] the world is going one way God's people
[9:52] are going the opposite
[9:54] way the devil is dishonoring first of
[9:59] all
[9:59] let me pause here when I'm talking about
[10:02] honoring your father first I'm talking
[10:04] about honoring God Amen secondly when I
[10:08] talk about honoring your father I'm
[10:11] talking about honoring your
[10:14] pastor regardless of what was me I'm
[10:17] telling you it's going on the city you
[10:20] honor your
[10:22] pastor right and thirdly you honor your
[10:27] natural father amen your pastor is your
[10:30] spiritual father we know that then God
[10:32] is the father of us all honor your
[10:35] natural father so what I'm speaking
[10:38] about honoring your father is
[10:40] three-dimensional and that's how you
[10:42] have to listen so that you can fully
[10:44] understand here so we're talking about
[10:47] the world going one way right and uh
[10:52] God's people going to opposite
[10:54] way Satan is teaching the people that
[10:57] dishonor the word
[11:00] this honor the revelation of this
[11:02] hour this honor the pastor to the AG the
[11:06] prophet of this
[11:08] hour amen be little and uh and uh try to
[11:14] destroy the reputation credibility and
[11:18] confidence of the people in the servant
[11:21] of God that's plac in the position to be
[11:25] the voice of God to you locally the
[11:28] angel of the church amen and thirdly the
[11:32] devil is there to destroy the
[11:36] family the devil hates homogeneous
[11:40] United families that has a man as the
[11:44] headship you know the devil tries to try
[11:47] to replace that and put the woman as the
[11:49] headship well we know the neck turns the
[11:51] head but the neck is not the head is
[11:54] that right praise the Lord hallelujah
[11:57] see that the head is placed there
[12:00] specifically because that's where it is
[12:03] the headship spiritually Jesus
[12:06] Christ amen the headship in the church
[12:09] is not the church
[12:10] board it's the pastor that has the full
[12:14] Authority and in the hall amen the
[12:17] church Bo can advise the pastor this
[12:19] that that whatever what this is the
[12:21] final authority to say whether this or
[12:23] whether that praise the Lord now it's
[12:25] the same thing in the home the wife has
[12:27] the freedom to live is the power Amen to
[12:32] freely express any view amen praise the
[12:35] Lord but still takes the man to be the
[12:39] authority and the leadership in that
[12:41] home it doesn't matter whether the
[12:45] wife is
[12:48] educated
[12:50] wealthy
[12:53] beautiful a
[12:55] celebrity right with status and all like
[12:58] that if she wants to really know her
[13:01] position she'll
[13:04] right I can tell you for a
[13:07] fact this might sound funny but my
[13:11] mother had a
[13:12] relative great aunt of mine that was
[13:15] minister of Education brilliant studying
[13:19] foreign lands with all kinds of degrees
[13:21] to glass of the wall but she was so
[13:24] focused on
[13:26] studying that uh she she got into her
[13:29] 40s and and and then all of a sudden
[13:32] like she woke up out of this sleep uh
[13:35] being a student yes he's just going on
[13:38] studying studying getting all these
[13:40] accolades everything running to the
[13:42] United Nations there and there there and
[13:44] that's realize wait a minute I'm doing
[13:47] all of this stuff and I'm not married
[13:48] yet I don't even have a child yet you
[13:50] know I have all this money I got
[13:53] Prestige but I don't have a husband and
[13:55] I don't have a child you know and
[13:59] I mean she just didn't grab anybody but
[14:02] it just happened a humble simple fellow
[14:04] had the courage enough to be talking
[14:06] with her and before you know it they
[14:09] were
[14:10] married she didn't think and say oh this
[14:13] guy don't have nothing or this guy is
[14:15] not that educated he's just an ordinary
[14:19] guy and you know what after that
[14:22] whatever he did even though she was
[14:24] Minister she would come right down and
[14:26] be right there with him she didn't care
[14:28] what anybody says that was her
[14:31] husband amen praise the Lord that should
[14:35] be the attitude and the spirit that we
[14:37] have to Humble
[14:39] ourselves and be what we are supposed to
[14:42] be in this age and resist the spirit of
[14:45] the dev and the culture of the day the
[14:48] culture of the
[14:50] day some speaking
[14:53] to I don't want to call the person the
[14:56] person I was just about to tell you
[14:58] something there but let me say that but
[15:01] this woman said well when I was in the
[15:03] foreign country man was the leader and
[15:06] the boss I come to North America here
[15:09] and I find out the woman is the
[15:12] boss you see so let's not go with the
[15:17] way of the world but go with the way of
[15:19] the word of God and the word of God says
[15:24] that it wasn't Adam that sin Eve sin and
[15:27] because of that God says she shall not
[15:30] teach nor you serve Authority amen you
[15:34] serve leadership right can you serve
[15:36] leadership which is not your own you say
[15:39] why you beating on this go go on with
[15:40] your preaching and move on to another
[15:43] subject amen praise the lord it's all
[15:47] right when the preacher is preaching and
[15:49] talking about love in the
[15:52] atmosphere and it's nice to be sweet
[15:55] with one another that's good but you
[15:57] know sometimes you you need some
[16:01] medicine is that right um You need
[16:07] prives praise the Lord you need anti
[16:12] toxicant right you need stuff like that
[16:16] that will clean you up and clean you
[16:19] out and make you whole in the presence
[16:22] of God and it's this tasteful to any of
[16:24] us we don't we we don't really want to
[16:27] take it but uh you know that you need
[16:30] it and if you don't know you need it
[16:32] you're going to die just where you
[16:34] are amen Rock From Within praise the
[16:39] Lord I I I honestly believe that we H
[16:44] Christians and and take me nicely how I
[16:46] use the word up to cut the
[16:48] crap we need
[16:52] deification is that
[16:56] right let me put it this way when you
[16:59] have a computer so that your mind don't
[17:00] go in another atmosphere when you have a
[17:03] computer that's full with junk uh
[17:06] brother Glenn you know what you do you
[17:08] you stop one day and you're got to
[17:10] decrapify your computer is that right as
[17:14] with the computer so with the human
[17:16] being amen praise the Lord whether it's
[17:19] with your body or your soul we need
[17:21] deification praise and so sometimes God
[17:25] has to make the word come for in such a
[17:27] way that you begin to realize some of
[17:30] the nonsense you're believing in your
[17:32] head am some of the nonsense of your
[17:36] actions some of the nonsense in your
[17:40] attitude and come back to
[17:43] yourself because you know that we start
[17:45] losing focus we start losing the
[17:48] direction and we start going off and God
[17:51] has to pull us back bring us back into
[17:55] position by his grace so we must honor
[17:58] our father praise the Lord that thy days
[18:03] may be long upon the Lord land which the
[18:06] Lord thy God give it thee that you might
[18:09] this is the only commandment with a
[18:11] promise amen that is the father your
[18:15] father my father I going to honor my
[18:19] father me you don't know my
[18:23] father you know what my father
[18:27] did you know what my father does you
[18:29] know how my father acts do you know this
[18:33] about my father that it don't doesn't
[18:36] really
[18:39] matter you are a product of
[18:44] him and that is what God is talking
[18:48] about let me say this regardless of
[18:51] anything honor thy
[18:54] father don't you go and think it's a
[18:58] it's a wonderful thing to expose your
[19:01] father's
[19:02] weakness all his
[19:07] mistakes in other words I'm quoting here
[19:10] scripture from the scripture in the Book
[19:12] of Genesis I'm using that image to bring
[19:16] that truth out how Noah's son went and
[19:20] uncover his father's nakedness while
[19:22] Noah was
[19:23] sleeping just poess Ro well the thing
[19:27] about it my friend
[19:29] is that the the other one came and
[19:32] covered him one covered him praise the
[19:35] Lord so you have to understand that love
[19:39] covers a multitude of
[19:41] sins uh love doesn't Joy have any Joy or
[19:47] satisfaction in
[19:49] blaming in
[19:51] accusing or as we in West Indian uh par
[19:55] would say catching people I
[20:00] yeah we not here to expose people we are
[20:04] not here in any way to expose you with
[20:08] this we are here to rebuke sin rebuke
[20:12] wrong wherever it is found regardless of
[20:14] who is in and let the Holy Spirit deal
[20:18] with that heart so that we all can be
[20:21] right with God Amen is that right that's
[20:24] what we're here for so honor your father
[20:26] regardless of uh what whatever you might
[20:29] be doing maybe did in the past did to
[20:32] your mother did to you whatever honor
[20:35] your father don't you go exposing all
[20:39] kinds of things and think it's a joy to
[20:41] to reveal or show uh his weaknesses
[20:44] whatever honor your
[20:47] father by Keeping the Faith of your
[20:50] father amen God bless you if you had a
[20:53] father that even had a little bit of fa
[20:57] praise the Lord you say oh my God what
[20:59] are you saying brother Simon let me tell
[21:02] you you know you don't understand how
[21:04] God
[21:05] works God will take your father and make
[21:09] take make you uh let him take you every
[21:13] single day to the Catholic Church to
[21:15] worship god
[21:17] there now as you go older and you
[21:21] understand the Bible more and more
[21:22] things are revealed to you you may
[21:25] disagree now with the faith that that
[21:28] your father was taking you in to go for
[21:31] the baptism circumcision whatever uh
[21:34] like that but you know what God used
[21:37] that first of all to give you
[21:41] faith and then he opens up your
[21:45] understanding more and more you're not
[21:48] stuck there but your understanding and
[21:52] your Revelation
[21:54] unfolds it's not that it's not like a a
[21:57] rejection
[21:59] but it's just that your understanding
[22:01] has expanded and you can't stay in that
[22:04] childhood Faith you've got to move on to
[22:07] a mature faith in Christ where your
[22:10] Revelation has got a hold of you and you
[22:13] become the image of
[22:16] Christ understand me praise the Lord so
[22:19] let's honor our Father by Keeping the
[22:23] Faith of Our Fathers praise the Lord
[22:26] keep the faith in Jesus Christ
[22:29] glory to God hallelujah you honor your
[22:32] father also by giving gifts to your
[22:36] father is that right so your your father
[22:40] maybe lived a wrong life he's down and
[22:42] out maybe he's not living like he should
[22:45] maybe he's wealthy that doesn't matter
[22:47] the fathers always like after they spent
[22:50] their whole life giving
[22:52] out they might not even need it but they
[22:55] still feel good when the children come
[22:57] back and give back back something to
[22:59] them is it right it's the attitude and
[23:03] the spirit of them acknowledging their
[23:07] gratitude and their attitude is what is
[23:11] important is this making any sense amen
[23:13] praise the Lord hallelujah I don't want
[23:15] to me talking to myself but uh I want to
[23:18] be able to talk to you and let you see
[23:20] the very importance of fathers and that
[23:24] importance cannot be overstated amen we
[23:28] must
[23:29] understand that uh we see reports
[23:32] confirming the importance of fathers in
[23:34] a
[23:35] family some people say well I I don't
[23:38] have to have a a father or a man or a
[23:42] husband in my life I can make along all
[23:45] right no doubt God will help you maybe
[23:47] you can but it does not break God's
[23:51] first uh first principle of the Bible
[23:54] when he made Adam and Eve husband and
[23:57] wife and place the the sacredness of
[24:01] marriage at the very top of his
[24:04] agenda is that righten in other words
[24:07] having a a Godly marriage a peaceful
[24:12] relationship uh mother father children
[24:15] in a in a spiritual even in a natural
[24:19] Eden the home is a place of Peace Andis
[24:22] of love then we find out that is God's
[24:27] idea but from the ideal comes other
[24:33] situations right that God knows
[24:36] about but at the same time he wants all
[24:39] of us to work towards the
[24:42] ideal that's the ideal praise the Lord
[24:45] yes you can yes a woman can yes even a
[24:49] man can raise a family by himself but
[24:52] that's not God's ideal God's ideal amen
[24:57] is to have a wonderful home with a
[25:01] peaceful uh emic situations as back in
[25:04] the Garden of Eden praise the Lord
[25:06] that's what I believe in and that's what
[25:09] the Bible teaches and that's what we
[25:11] should all Inspire to and that is what
[25:14] I'm trying to teach you uh teach you
[25:18] that if you were not in that kind of a
[25:21] background if you were not in that kind
[25:23] of a atmosphere in that kind of a
[25:25] cultural experience where you honor your
[25:28] your father and this modern day thing
[25:31] where young people just stop their
[25:33] father in the back and call him Tim and
[25:36] Tom or Jim or
[25:39] John I really seen some kick their
[25:43] father I seen them take the the attitude
[25:47] of the mother that might be bitter
[25:49] against the father and start talking all
[25:52] kinds of stuff against the
[25:54] father and talking any way to the father
[25:59] even when the father is sinful and wrong
[26:03] the man is the image of Christ and the
[26:06] woman is the image of the church so when
[26:09] you're talking to the man personally he
[26:13] might he he no doubt can be 100% guilty
[26:17] but God is still looking at the image
[26:19] that you're having to deal with praise
[26:21] the Lord honor thy father praise the
[26:24] Lord now glory to his name so the
[26:27] important of the father cannot be
[26:30] overstated because the father in the
[26:33] home whether you like it or not is a
[26:35] stabilizing
[26:37] factor and like me the pastor in the
[26:40] church spiritual father sometimes he has
[26:42] to say things to the wife to the
[26:45] children that
[26:47] areful don't want to hear it don't like
[26:49] it but it's about to
[26:51] say because that's his position to be
[26:53] the rock to be the
[26:56] anchor to be the BW the defense The
[26:59] Protector the provider the one that's
[27:03] going to have a vision and look ahead
[27:06] for the family planning ahead and
[27:08] working together to accomplish a goal
[27:11] for the purpose of the glory of God Amen
[27:15] praise the Lord honor like Father praise
[27:19] God forever more Hallelujah listen
[27:21] friends let me tell you children need
[27:23] need fathers present in their lives is
[27:26] that right look the say look over Canada
[27:29] we are ending up with a whole lot of
[27:31] single uh uh mother
[27:33] families and single father families to
[27:37] right either the wife leaves or the
[27:39] mother leaves you know is this As the
[27:41] World Turns experiences what they call
[27:43] marriage today right today they're
[27:45] married and two weeks later a month
[27:48] later or a year later I'm tired of it
[27:50] they grab their first I'm
[27:53] leaving and they just walk up and they
[27:55] think it's a simple thing they don't
[27:57] real likee how seriously serious that is
[28:01] and how God has placed that as part of
[28:04] his great system of Faith amen and even
[28:10] if you want to go socially uh along the
[28:13] line of social dynamics and think about
[28:15] the country nations are built on
[28:19] families and Any Nation knows that when
[28:22] the family uh foundations begin to
[28:25] crumble and fall apart the nation starts
[28:28] falling
[28:29] apart it happened with Rome from inside
[28:32] it wasn't armies from outside conquered
[28:34] Rome it was the social conditions of
[28:37] family put they broke down into RS and
[28:41] parties and anything gos and whatever
[28:45] and the social structure broke down and
[28:47] they defeated themselves actually from
[28:50] within we see Society not going that way
[28:53] but we are going the opposite way we are
[28:56] going to other God's word we are going
[28:58] hon the preachers that are preaching
[29:00] God's word I'm talking about whether
[29:03] Pastor PRI this superintendent preser
[29:07] whatever name you want to put on it
[29:09] actually it's the same thing right you
[29:12] you can fancy the name but it's the same
[29:14] thing it's just the approach to it but
[29:17] let me tell you brothers and sisters you
[29:19] honor
[29:21] God
[29:23] honor your
[29:25] pastor honor
[29:28] your father and wies honor your husband
[29:31] the Bible say so praise the name of the
[29:33] Lord listen friends very important it's
[29:35] St the LI his children amen because the
[29:38] father is there to
[29:40] instruct
[29:42] discipline
[29:44] Hallelujah some of you can remember that
[29:48] it's all right if you stop that and you
[29:51] continue doing it I said stop it you
[29:54] continue doing it but she said you w't
[29:56] stop that you wait till your father
[29:58] comes
[30:00] home there's something about the father
[30:02] that not plac there that when you tell
[30:04] that child wait till your father comes
[30:07] home the Dynamics change is that right
[30:11] you don't want to deal with your father
[30:13] you feel that you can talk to your
[30:15] mother and talk around your mother but
[30:17] when you come to your father no amen
[30:20] praise the Lord hallelujah so it's very
[30:23] important that you have some uh Father
[30:26] Figure there amen praise the Lord
[30:30] hallelujah because sometimes you know
[30:32] God places people in your life that may
[30:35] not be your natural
[30:37] father it may be somebody like a big
[30:41] brother you know you have that
[30:43] organization and that figure takes that
[30:46] part could be an adopted father glory to
[30:50] God hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord
[30:54] um wow um the first text I got this
[30:58] morning is from a government official
[31:01] over there in GH why he took me like he
[31:05] take me as his
[31:07] father and that's how he addresses me
[31:10] daddy this and father that and what do
[31:12] you think about this whatever like that
[31:14] father thy father it's important that
[31:18] you do that so that God's promises and
[31:21] blessings can come
[31:23] upon and when you dishonor that it his
[31:26] his plan doesn't work the way it should
[31:29] yes so fathers need to discipline but
[31:32] not only discipline because that's all
[31:34] some fathers know it's the
[31:37] discipline every two minut discipline
[31:40] but they there also to encourage amen
[31:43] fathers need to encourage their children
[31:46] not put them down you know I've heard
[31:50] some sister child make a mistake you
[31:53] dummy are you useless you
[31:56] st or this or that are your back word or
[32:01] sometimes I heard even mothers say you
[32:03] am to no good you know you're putting
[32:05] these kind of curses on your
[32:08] children you putting those kinds of talk
[32:10] on them you don't realize that the words
[32:13] of your mouth has power amen and that we
[32:16] as parents in our position uh you know
[32:19] in the Bible when those prophets were
[32:21] there the Patriarchs when their sons and
[32:23] their daughters and they were dying said
[32:25] well you're going to be blessed and you
[32:27] going to this but you going to be a
[32:28] servant and you going to be the and
[32:30] whatever they said that's what
[32:32] happened so we as parents have to be
[32:35] careful of what we say so let's
[32:37] encourage them and lift them up praise
[32:41] the Lord they may do something bad they
[32:44] may not obey the word even your word but
[32:47] we have to say come on you know you're
[32:51] better than that but you could said it
[32:53] the other way you look look what you
[32:56] did run them down but don't waste your
[33:00] time running them down lift them up
[33:03] straighten the part in them that is Val
[33:06] good strengthen their character and
[33:08] encourage them that the grace of God may
[33:11] come upon their lives and we have the
[33:13] promise in the Bible that if we bend the
[33:16] tree while it is Young when it becomes
[33:19] older it will not depart from the faith
[33:22] why because then oh I see what mom was
[33:27] telling
[33:28] oh that's what that meant oh now they
[33:33] begin to understand before you know they
[33:35] start doing the very same things they
[33:37] thought they wouldn't do because they
[33:39] realize it wasn't bad for them it was
[33:41] good for them it wasn't meant to break
[33:44] them it was meant to bless them
[33:47] right this is the end of my life I can't
[33:50] go on like this I can't live the way no
[33:54] it's it's not the end it's just a little
[33:57] Bend in the road road that you have to
[33:59] pass through before you start a really
[34:02] wonderful life honor thy father amen
[34:06] praise the Lord hallelujah very
[34:08] important so we have to
[34:10] encourage one our children in this great
[34:14] and important work and and of course I'm
[34:17] doing my work by fortifying and
[34:19] strengthening the hearts of fathers not
[34:22] to give up amen because in the present
[34:25] environment of this AG age and with the
[34:29] spirit that's in the world to give women
[34:33] more of a domineering and dominating
[34:36] spirit amen rather than having a real
[34:41] lady like feminine Spirit right back in
[34:47] the back in England the term is used
[34:50] Gentile or gentle
[34:54] woman well you have women today but
[34:56] they're not gentlemen M I'm not saying
[34:59] all but now they're traing along with
[35:03] work boots just like a man with their

[35:09] they're working with and you know praise
[35:12] the Lord um this has gone from just Lip
[35:16] lip using their lips to using everything
[35:18] at hand but B whatever whatever is there
[35:23] if you get burn you get burn if you get
[35:25] hit you get hit whatever else and that
[35:27] spirit is
[35:28] manifest I'm just telling you like it is
[35:31] we not here to make up stuff or make it
[35:33] sounds really nice I can preach about
[35:35] butterflies and about geology and and
[35:37] all those kinds of subjects too but

[36:36] lie like some people do in the weddings

[36:43] differences nothing from the cheek or
[36:46] from the top is that right there oh
[36:49] yes well real people know that a't
[36:53] true that you're going to live a whole
[36:55] lifetime and you didn't have any
[36:57] different

[37:00] woman anything I say yes anything I say

[37:09] either and anything she wants that's a
[37:12] yes there and he said you marry a mouse
[37:14] or a man rather than a man a man has to
[37:18] have a back a backbone and a spine

[37:23] he doesn't need to be
[37:25] controlling he needs to be T but he
[37:27] needs to be tender is that right right
[37:30] he needs to know when to comfort and
[37:32] when to be
[37:34] corrected and and and even when you're
[37:36] doing those things being
[37:39] corrective uh you still got to be
[37:41] correcting in love amen oh praise God

[38:17] and let you know just let the let the
[38:21] wife run the house take over the home

[38:35] servant on that but you need to be
[38:37] involved this is together I said it's

[38:45] things that I'll do this you do that
[38:47] I'll do this you do that but you come
[38:49] together and you talk about it it's
[38:51] together always together it's an
[38:54] invisible
[38:56] Union that last for eternity praise God

[39:05] falling asleep on me here today praise
[39:08] the Lord wanting to know this true so

[39:16] God Amen so children you who are here
[39:21] that have a father you're so blessed
[39:23] you're so blessed to have a father that
[39:26] really cares about you that really
[39:29] thinks about you prays for you and
[39:33] you're really doubly blessed if you have
[39:35] a Godly father that will point you and
[39:38] lead you in the right
[39:40] direction it's so important that you
[39:43] remember God blessed you with a Godly
[39:46] father and the father of course should
[39:48] be the spiritual leader of the house and
[39:51] in charge of making know God to his
[39:55] children Hallelujah
[39:58] we have to make God known to our
[40:00] children God's ways God's blessings
[40:03] praise the Lord and he is to be a leader
[40:06] but not a
[40:07] dictator are you listening to me one
[40:10] Brothers take my advice don't try to be
[40:13] a
[40:14] dictator but it must be known that you
[40:16] are the leader praise the
[40:19] Lord and of course you have different
[40:22] forms of leadership you have gracious
[40:24] leadership you know um where where it's
[40:26] just a put in the t- shop and and then
[40:30] you you have all kinds of quiet
[40:32] confident leadership doesn't have to
[40:34] keep noise just does what it has to do
[40:37] and and and the family goes on life goes
[40:40] on praise the Lord hallelujah praise God
[40:44] you know not those kinds of men that
[40:46] walk in the house and says where's my my
[40:49] suffer or it's not ready
[40:52] yet the tables the dishes and everything
[40:55] else well no that's not real leadership
[40:59] right praise God all all that this is a
[41:02] spirit of fear and and and whatever else
[41:05] you're trying to do but uh look at the
[41:08] Lord Jesus amen and the way he behaved
[41:11] amen praise God when you had to call
[41:13] something a fox he call it a fox when
[41:15] you want to call it sin he called it sin
[41:17] but yet he moved with Grace with
[41:20] character with love praise God and with
[41:23] compassion praise the Lord hallelujah I
[41:25] know you're kind of getting a little bit
[41:27] Restless now I can sense it but I just
[41:31] have a few more things to say Father's
[41:33] Day there's a lot for you to do when you
[41:35] go out of here but you need the
[41:36] spiritual Foundation
[41:38] amen praise the Lord
[41:41] hallelujah and so when the children are
[41:44] still
[41:46] young we as fathers ought to make
[41:52] Godly
[41:54] decisions on behalf of our children
[41:58] and we need to know with with with real
[42:01] spiritual timing there not many special
[42:04] age say well at 60 or at 80 or this
[42:08] children mature at
[42:10] different you know and you have to know
[42:13] your own child be a sense
[42:15] that but you need to make Godly
[42:18] decisions that will help and affect the
[42:20] future of your children
[42:25] now but when those children start to get
[42:27] to a certain age and you can start
[42:30] seeing them becoming uncomfortable and
[42:32] responsible you need to know when to
[42:35] start taking your hands
[42:37] off when to draw
[42:40] back like the story of the eagle put the
[42:43] young ones down there and let them start
[42:45] fending for themselves and going down in
[42:47] the valley and this and that but he says
[42:50] she was sitting on a rock and the dad
[42:53] sitting on a rock they just look him
[42:54] down he said let a wol for something
[42:57] thing trying to come and attack them and
[42:58] they'll scoop down on the wings of
[43:01] eagles to tear that thing those beasts
[43:03] apart amen so that's the same thing as
[43:06] parents we have to sense the season the
[43:08] time when they start taking your hands
[43:10] off all right uh when they young you
[43:13] make all the Godly decisions but when
[43:15] they get much much older you don't try
[43:17] to run their lives you try to advise and
[43:21] guide but not
[43:23] deand and not command and I love God to
[43:28] help them because you must have
[43:29] confidence in the in the character that
[43:32] you inculcated or built into them if
[43:36] you're still walking in fear it means
[43:38] you don't even believe what you T them
[43:40] is that right you've got to believe and
[43:42] have confidence that God's word will
[43:44] come come to pass hallelujah amen glory
[43:48] to God hallelujah remember nobody is
[43:53] perfect right including your father
[43:58] you know when I was much Young when I
[44:00] and all of us know that when you were a
[44:02] child your father was like he was the
[44:04] strongest man in the world he had the
[44:07] biggest muscles your father was the
[44:09] tallest your father was the best
[44:12] everything about it but you notice as
[44:14] you get older you start to see chicks
[44:17] here and there in his
[44:20] arm is that right you realize that uh
[44:24] yes he he he's my father but he's still
[44:27] a little this a little that but you
[44:29] still need to honor your father praise
[44:31] the
[44:32] Lord I see my little short father of
[44:35] course he was short like me looking up
[44:36] to my eldest brother and say
[44:41] why and today World they scream at that
[44:45] father they'll pick him up by you know
[44:48] his shirt or something and tell him off
[44:50] but my brother just stood there you know
[44:52] quietly and he listened and he heard
[44:55] everything and he you know he could he
[44:58] could do whatever he wanted but the way
[45:00] he was brought up he wouldn't do that he
[45:03] wouldn't dream of doing that and so when
[45:07] the word is placed in the children and
[45:09] the faith of God is in them they will
[45:12] not depart from that doesn't matter how
[45:14] many years or how old we get later on so
[45:17] we got a job to the brother and sisters
[45:19] never mind whether you see CHS in your
[45:21] mother your father this one or that one
[45:23] you just honor your mother and your
[45:26] father that your days may be long upon
[45:28] the land which the Lord thy God give
[45:29] thee you believe that say Amen if you
[45:33] believe that say Amen if you believe it
[45:36] one more time say amen amen praise God I
[45:40] [Applause]
[45:47] believe amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[45:50] and I want to honor those fathers that
[45:53] may stand in the position for a missing
[45:56] father
[45:57] praise the Lord
[46:00] hallelujah a non biological father we
[46:03] need to honor the father we need to
[46:07] honor step fathers

[46:19] the lord we need father father step
[46:23] fathers fathers fathers and give glory

[46:35] you're here
[46:37] today and you're a child with no father
[46:40] pres present in your
[46:42] life then let me encourage you not to be
[46:46] discouraged but to take heart your
[46:49] wonderful um men in this church there

[47:02] that
[47:03] image and I'm sure God will help me to
[47:06] be a blessing and a help to you in forms
[47:09] of advice or counseling or anything of
[47:14] that nature is that
[47:15] clear praise the name of the Lord that's
[47:18] very important that we bear that
