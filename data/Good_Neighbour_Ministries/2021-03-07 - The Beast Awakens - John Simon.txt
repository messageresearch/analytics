TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] once again good sunday morning friends what a joy to be here with you once again god bless you real good thank you for uh being on this broadcast watching it online listening to it in some form or the other this is a broadcast like no other for there is as you can see we don't have much of of a music and that sort of thing so it would be good but there is no beauty of it there is no embellishments to it there is nothing uh given out nothing that you can attract you to it it's plain it's simple it's down to earth and only if there is something in you that this appeals to it will draw you other than that to you it will be just another broadcast another preacher everything will be so plain so simple and it'll pass right by you but i am preaching the word of god for those who of god have has ordained to hear and receive his word in this age regardless of who they are now the way i deliver the message may not be suited to every person that listens to the way i speak and the way i'm saying it but god has designed every preacher for a certain person or persons that will receive his message and wherever they are and whoever you are regardless of your station may the great holy spirit of god take this word that i'm preaching today and apply it to your heart may god bless you as we read our scripture this morning thank god the sun is up may the sun rise within your hearts genesis chapter 1 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters genesis 3 1 3 and god said let there be light and there was light hallelujah thank god god spoke his word and his word came to pass let us pray as i will speak on the topic of the beast awakens the beast awakens let us pray a gracious god or heavenly father we ask your blessing upon this thy word grant inspiration direction revelation understanding what speaker and hearer and at the end of this all to thee be all the praise the honor and glory in jesus name amen and amen way back beyond the very mists of time in the dateless past outside of time and before time was two ages are mentioned by various uh theologians bible students and those who search the scriptures diligently first there is the alpha age and the earth's history ends with the omega age or ages the alpha age as mentioned by dr pember and by dr clarence larkin are first of all earth's earliest ages dr larkin says we find out that sin and evil existed before man satan and his angels were in rebellion against god for it seems as if satan was in charge of the earth at that time before our time began now but being in rebellion god kicked him out of heaven he fell to earth whatever judgments god sent to the earth we do not know but in genesis 1 the bible does tell us that in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth now between genesis one and two uh one and three there could have been millions of years and so we find that god judging the earth because of satanic evil and the sin of of the evil one who was once called lucifer cast out satan his name changed and he became satan the evil one the devil the liar who was a liar from the beginning speaking lies to the one-third of those angels and then speaking lies in the ears of eve and then speaking lies through the physical frame that he brought to being true eve by his uh hybriding brought forth a liar when he was asked where is your brother abel he says i don't know well he had already killed him and he very well knew that he killed him and here he was with no respects no regard for god lying to a god who is omnipotent omniscient all-knowing and yet he lied to god and the pharisees are his descendants and the liars of today are his descendants and this is why i said jesus said you are of your father the devil for he was a liar from the beginning whatever judgments god sent upon the earth we do not know but the bible does say and the earth was without form and void now of course we know god did not create a wasteland god did not create chaos god created something what was beautiful wonderful beyond our imagination but because of the sin of satan and his minions the evil angels that followed him his associates god sent judgment upon the earth causing it to be without form and void now this destruction my friends came upon the earth and crossed it as i said before to have no form or formless chaotic and void of life everywhere the light whatever life was there was destroyed now between the alpha ages age and the omega age is what we call time alpha omega and the alpha the beginning before all things upon this earth began there was other life before god set the judgment and the earth became without form and void then god said god created a new creation having birth and no doubt destroyed the old one and out of that came this new one now the omega ages or a mega age right for time is made up of ages the alpha age is made up of epochs and here we are time having its own dispensation and ages and then we have the omega age or ages which we will uh simply let you know that's speaking of eternity but the omega age or ages begins with the ending of the church age ages and the beginning of the eternal church age for the eternal church age is the omega age and the omega age of course means you've broken back into eternity once again here you are statue of a perfect man of course paragraph 31 1962 now between genesis 1 to genesis 1 3 could have been millions and millions of years of time that was i believe the time when the dinosaurs roamed the earth dinosaurs roam the earth i believe there were pterodactyls that's the time uh as we say the raptors roamed the earth all men are flying of beasts and fowl animals flying and i can't imagine them i don't know anything much about them but they have been finding bones relics they have been finding these traces of these various pre-historic beasts let's call that pre-adamic beasts preadamic times and so dinosaurs pterodactyls raptors they walk the earth the bible tells us also giants roamed the earth at that particular time for it will take giants to deal with those kinds of beasts and and animals at that that time whatever else was there we do not know that is why uh if i might drop this in here man talks about inventing electricity and inventing atomic energy and inventing this and inventing that those things no doubt were already there we are now discovering them and we think it's all new but it is not as the wisest man has said there is no new thing under the sun now you know as well as i do they have many books written about this in the various uh libraries of the world of how scientists archaeologists various students in this particular area have been uncovering various traces of these animals bones and so on and many of them are being now exposed or uncovered and we can now recognize their existence this of course has caused the conflict between science and religion because science is saying oh religion is saying that we were just 6 000 years old and we know for a fact these animals are maybe a million years old maybe thousands we don't know 11 700 years old whatever but the fact is there really is no conflict because man only came on the earth after those things took place and so here we are brothers that the earth suffered from its its ice age its natural ice age when god judged it the earth coming to a place without form and with odd void and void so genesis 1 3 actually was the beginning man and the enter earth and everything on it was the beginning of a new creation a new creation and mankind being made or installed by god as the kings and queens of the earth adam and eve were king and queen over the entire creation and there were our representative now god in the book of acts birthed or certified and created his church on the foundations of the rock of revelation which in these days have become the rejected stone man prefers reason to revelation man prefers intellectuality rather than inspiration man prefers those things but god said uh upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it now the church being built upon the rock of spiritual revelation satan in his rebellion felt came from heaven cast down to earth according to the prophets did not stop his rebellion but continued to pres to create mayhem murder and madness misery everywhere that he could and so he brought about now not just a natural ice age but a spiritual ice age upon the face of the earth and he brought it as you know winter comes not only with cold but darkness and so he brought a a spiritual ice age upon that church that god had birthed by acts 2 4 by the pouring out of the holy spirit of the living god he brought spiritual darkness upon the church and brought freezing cold spiritual atmospheres and weather in the church trying to kill the church by that freezing spiritual atmosphere and to turn the hearts of the children away from the spiritual apostolic fathers that were there how many of you have ever heard of a dead man's walk well when one one is caught out in the wilderness in real freezing cold weather it seems to play tricks with the mind and then a man that's lost will begin to walk thinking he's going in the right direction and even if he walked for 40 years 50 years uh sorry for five minutes 10 minutes whatever he will find that he has walked in a circle then he began noticing all the old trees and and marks that he saw before with that he will then realize that he's really really lost and he's walking in a circle and can't help it he may try again he may try two more times and yet he find himself caught up in a vicious dance of death a vicious death walk and then what begins to happen is that man or woman starts to get sleepy now they may be in the church but they get start to get lukewarm and sleepy they must start to lose their fire their fervor the heat of that god and the walk that god gives to your soul with the love power and presence of the holy spirit and they begin to relax and relax and the next thing you know that man will decide well let me stop and take a rest and just lean against the trunk of a tree and you know what that'll be the last time he stops because when he or she stops leans on that tree to take a good rest and then rest and they'll fall into the sleep of death and others will come and find them frozen frozen right where there were in the church but frozen somewhere frozen to death because of their own lukewarmness their disobedience their stubbornness and the same spirit of rebellion instead of saying oh my father a prophet got lost and he says lord lead me and guide me out of here i can't be my own guide i don't know where i'm going you lead me and the spirit of god led him out of the wilderness that same spirit of god can lead us in our lives path out of our spiritual wilderness that we are in but this is what was happening to the church the entire church after 6480 after the time of paul the apostles the fire the forward to fight the anointing within their lives within their hearts that fire began to be cooling off and dying out it just did not die like that overnight it took uh ages or centuries for it to die out from under paul and then less than the next age less in the next age until we come to the all time after the freezing cold and contrary winds began to blow upon the old ship of zion and completely put the master sailors all to sleep this in church history is called the time of the dark ages dark spiritually dark and cold as cold could be within the very framework of the church of god it was a time of spiritual chaos a time of uh misunderstanding doubt fear superstition witchcraft every possible evil from satan was released at that particular time under the cover of darkness and the freezing cold atmosphere that was within the then known church it was during these dark ages we come into the time of inquisition millions yes millions killed crucified upside down burnt at the stake many marched into the colosseum of rome and there led to their death under the ferocity of lions tigers and other wild beasts men and women slaughtered as the bible tells us the scriptures and psalms how they eat up my people as if they were eating bread god's people burnt slaughtered destroyed in every possible way why was that happening because the so-called church then church by name only was encased like the all dinosaurs encased in total ice it was a spiritual ice age of the church of the living god for the people in the church bibles locked with a brass lock of which only the priests could unlock that to read out of it made to be so mysterious and fearful and so the people were frozen by the spirit of fear they were frozen by the lady lengthy liturgies and and so-called uh masses that would just put them into a dead man's walk and put them fully asleep my friends for centuries the church was caught up into the freezing winds and atmosphere of the dark ages of this nominal false church contrary to the word of god but thank god then jesus came but thank god he never leaves himself a wit without a witness thank god 1906. the powerful or revival of a souza street began what was it the awakening of the church martin luther the church began to awake hallelujah wesley the church began to rouse herself amen then under pentecost the church stood up on its feet praised god and began to speak and anoint the the lay hands on the sick miracles signs wonders and the power in the presence of god and that age of pentecost until the coming of malachi 4 5 the prophet elijah in the spirit of elijah prophesied by malachi chapter 4 verse 5 and so the fire of god fell and began to unfreeze warm up the church bring her back to what she was that fire of god set the church free from the deep freeze of all those ice age denominational spirits that were upon them and thank god the springtime of the church came again oh glory to god i love springtime and so we see springtime came in the church no wonder i was blessed to see the ending of the of that original pentecost and i sure tell you the people love springing about running the isles shouting to god dancing in the spirit anointed by the holy ghost many times we'll see the pure of cloud and fire pass through the ceiling literally brother simon did you read this in a book no i'm telling you about what i have seen with my eyes and experienced by the presence and power of god and the holy spirit and the reality of god in these last days i was blessed and allowed to see the mighty hand of god while the real genuine pentecost not this modern day thing called petticos but the genuine pentecost before just as it one was winding down and the age was petering out and coming to its age let me not talk about that but praise god hallelujah brother sister the church came out of her deep freeze the church began to saw out by the fire the holy ghost and the anointing of the holy spirit and just like natural scientists have in the north in alberta in different countries china parts of africa scientists are have uncovered fish now calcified or in rock form that were caught by the freezing of that time they have even have reported that they are found like a dinosaur or a prehistoric beast with grass in its mouth and because of the ice the grass might have still been literally fresh because of the ice that was over it but frozen like that and in case with ice and some of them with some form some prey some other smaller animals within their jaws at the same time the the very tombs of the pharaohs are being uncovered and being discovered everywhere but friends could it be that a lot of the diseases unknown diseases all manner of viruses all manner of evil sicknesses coming up on the fish could it be the open pandora's box and when they open those tombs they say curse of the pharaoh it's the curse of satan and out of there some of those strange unknown diseases and sicknesses came right out and we're loosed upon the earth again and we may claim we're calling it a new discovery we just discovered the virus we just discovered this new disease we just discovered this new thing over here it was already there and it was frozen no doubt buried and then uncovered or thought out and once again loosed upon the earth and exposed in the entire world upon us amen could it be that that's what it is could it be that's what is happening at this particular time just naturally that happened we know that science tells us that the scientists will tell you that emphatically that that happened and i'm saying to you in the same manner parallel spiritually that the beast-like rebellious spirit of satan cast down from heaven from the prehistoric and pre-adamic ages that time my friends genesis the spirit of that hybrid beast came through the serpent spawning satanic evil by using eve to bring it upon the face of the earth and for a time even to this time many are saying oh there is no devil there is no satan there is really no real evil but you don't understand that wild beast is acting as if he can be a nice pet cat that appears like he is sleeping really he is seeing everything that's going on he is watching for that mouse or that prey to get to that place where he can just move upon it grasp it within his evil claws tries to do as if he's you know he's powerless oh he's an illusion there's no such thing as satan but i believe that this spiritual this spiritual beast not natural as the scientists are finding and uncovering the natural i am taking the word of god to uncover this spirit spiritual prehistoric beast and i say prehistoric because satan is older than man this ancient evil being was there and then casts out oh my friends this prehistoric beast spirit rebellious against god it's called satan some say shayatan but whatever his name it changed from lucifer sun in the morning down to the lord of darkness again he's called in the gospels bielsa bob or better known the ultimate meaning lord of the dung heap lord of the flies flies on a carcass and satan means all of that i believe that with the fire and the power and the life that came out of the ministry of malachi 4 5 the ministry of brother william marion branham that he has released a spiritual warmth and fire of god that has awaken and awaken everything that was dead is starting to come to life again i say to you the beast awakens that's that spirit of that prehistoric spiritual raptor or beast is now in its awakening stages one eye is open the other one is following he's watching and he is about to move up on the face of the world and to take charge of its government its churches its money structures its economics its political areas all of it my friends educational social everything he is seeking to move and to take charge and control over it amen yes sir he knows it's time to fulfill scripture amen you say oh satan is going to fulfill scripture yes just as much as one of the high priest said it is not it's not for all the people shouldn't die but it is good for one man to die for the people and the bible said and he knew not that he prophesied hallelujah he actually spoke what was the word of god and so god many times makes satan does things he wants him to do without him knowing and it's time for certain scriptures to be fulfilled and he knows it because the beast is awakening the spirit of rebellion manifested in the world wars rumors of wars rebellions everywhere fightings my friends within and without is taking place now and he knows it that his time has come to fulfill scriptures like as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the day when the son of man oh god is being revealed days of noah go to your scriptures read it i will not outline all of that violence marion given in marriage man just living with women women living with men without marriage without the sacred unsanctity of the god's approval and god's blessing it may not work the way you want it to be but that's the pattern god has set within his word we must follow god's sacred pattern so he knows he has to fulfill that as it was in the days of lord of lot the days of sodom with this sodomy with its perversion with its evil witness greed oh my friends here we come again another wave of sin is rolling in another wave of evil is coming upon the world are you ready are you ready is the blood upon your doorpost has the holy spirit warmed your heart has he untown you has he taken the ice icicles off of your soul has he set you free from that past of yours and brought you into a new walk a new creation with him listen to the word of god for this day and this hour hallelujah he knows he has to fulfill all of these amen he is right now in the construction direction the uh for the manifestation gross use and fall and final destruction of mystery babylon the mother of harlots we say harlots amen our daughters just as all these modern day uh denominations have come out of the roman church amen they are her daughters and the bible says just like the mother the children are money loving money hungry with the same spirit that is upon them a order for organization trying to make themselves look beautiful with all manner of painted false fronts all beautiful shaped buildings oh my god just to attract the those who have no understanding a solomon said the young man in the streets just goes with his eyes and doesn't go with any spiritual understanding and chases after such a woman in the doom of his of the twilight in the gloom and in the twilight yes sir amen read revelation chapter 17 18 19 and you will see how this evil wicked beast-like spirit that has been loosed upon the face of the earth and is awakening and has awakened this spirit is beginning to take over in every aspect of society taking over with lies with a a storm of lies taking over receptivity with manipulation with evil in all forms and some of the evil that we are yet to see you have never in your life even imagined it or seen it but it will be evil that took place from the dateless past down through the times of noah right through pharaoh right down through nebuchadnezzar and up on hitler and stalin right to this time an accumulation of those evil spirits in an evil manifestation on the direction of this beast like spirit and nature is awakening upon the face of the earth yes now let me pause here i was watching on the television how that the pope has visited iraq now while there he visit or of the chaldeas which was the beginning of our faith the birthplace of abraham the father of the faithful the father of his faith seed now of course the pope in my eyes seems to be personally a good man a man of the people a man of the downtrodden but you see friends he is i believe this is my my looking at the picture this man with his grand hopes and desires is trying to accomplish great things wonderful things but he's trying to do with it within a system an ancient old system that isn't i believe inspired by this dislike spirit working and using that system to bring about its objectives politically financially spiritually but a faith of religion or whatever is working true this means and not just true that but through every one of these so-called denominations which are just extensions or franchises of the same thing on the different names to the new to divide to to uh uh divert people's attention from what he is trying to accomplish and doing in this time oh my friends the beast awakens the body of the beast awakens the church body of the beast awakens remember in the in the in the gospels jesus said there were ten virgins ten were wise and uh five were wise five were foolish but not this carefully i'm just going to pass over this the bible says the cry went out amen hallelujah behold the bridegroom cometh amen when the cry went out which i believe our brother william marion branham was used of god to capture the world's attention that he could announce to the world its rapture time christ is coming second coming of the lord amen the appearance of the supernatural cloud in the form of the face of christ over uh arizona there my friends we see these things however when the virgins not just the wise all of the virgins heard the cry some went back to sleep they heard william branham he was fanciful he was beautiful marvelous wonderful his message was powerful and they would go to the meetings and clap their hands when they saw the miracles the discernment and so on that was marvelous as soon as he left the scene even some of the believers of this his message falling asleep falling back to sleep amen and then saw those foolish virgins fell right back to sleep after the original sounding of the voice of god in these last days that behold the bridegroom cometh so what has happened during this time god has been dealing with his elect amen his hidden ones his sacred ones oh his surrendered ones his ordained predestinated attributes from before the foundation of the world god has been dealing with them but now as they begin to receive the word and unfold the word now there's a thought going on there's a wart coming again there my friends is unfreezing god is starting to lose his spirit the holy spirit upon the world and everything what was frozen starts to be throwing out and spring is here again the rapture is right at hand glory to god my friends the true elected already awakened and we fight now the foolish virgins are now coming back they might have heard william branham the the first time i heard about him but he caught their attention for a short while they go to sleep but now the foolish virgins are starting to awaken just as much as those be obese natural naturally when uh the on time comes a scientist begins to find them and spiritually when pentecost came the spiritual beast-like nature of satan it woke up and it started to make itself slowly slowly gingerly cat-like stealth manifesting itself once again in the world and so we see many pentecostal preachers pastors ministers who once shunned brother william marion branham who once shunned malachi 4 5 who were frozen by fear who would never utter his name or speak about this ministry that was unmatched from the time of christ amen to this hour it was written somewhere in one of the catholic digests the very ground the man walks on is blessed oh my friend here we find that once again now and he himself spoke it he said what i'm telling you is thus saith the lord one day long after he's gone he spoke about it that the pentecostals he said when you see them turn around and start coming back to this message watch it for the rapture is at hand oh glory to god amen friends so these pentecostal churches and evangelists i won't call their names god bless their hearts because at least some of them have enough spirituality and courage to step out and speak their convictions without fear or favor are not waiting for a handout oh but to stand with god's word and with god's despised view amen and bear the shame and reproach by his glorious and wonderful name yes sir and so they're awakening the signs of prophecy being fulfilled what this is not a fairy tale this is not a myth or a story to be told this is actually the real beauty and the beast this is actually my friends the bride versus the be spirit of satan of which she shall overcome and defeat him with the blood of the lamb the word of our testimony and in the name of jesus christ for the glory of god amen after the chaos of the spiritual of this ice age him the creation of man amen to be lords of the natural creation and now here is it again the toying out of the spiritual ice age god is now putting forth a new creation by the same spoken word that he used in genesis 1 3 and god said let there be light another prophet said it shall be light about the evening time the path to glory you will surely find in the waterway is the light today buried in the name of jesus oh my friends once again the new creation is to have dominion over all spiritual things as kings and queens upon the face of the earth and to rule with supernatural authority and spiritual power over all things having authority over every situation i hope you are recognizing what's being said here now and that you are willing and ready to accept him within your heart life and to take your position and control by your face in his word let it be and so it is god said let it be and so it is i hope the sons of god will begin to trust him and to imitate their father and to do the very actions of their father and watch the word of god come to pass in every situation of your life sickness authority over sickness they shall lay their hands on the sick and the sick shall recover amen power over suffering amen power over your grief and your depression god will give you the power the comfort the heart to overcome in the midst of terror and torment god will give you all the life and power that you need even in the midst of death god has given us power and authority amen and he's an eternal life in him where he has said even though that you were you are dead yet shall you live amen for in other words yes you may suffer natural death but you're really not dead for the real you on the inside has eternal life and shall have the fullness because you have come to the fullness of the church ages and now by faith and revelation you are entering into the omega ages or age or what the met prophet of god the servant of god called that man that woman i want to see when they enter into that eternal church age at the end of the seals amen oh praise god hallelujah all my friends let us now by faith then walk out of this modern age spiritually speaking i'm saying walk out separate yourself from it your be in the world but not of the world inside in these churches are all around us but we are not all of them jesus came not from mary but true mary we might have been in this church that church that church in the womb of this other church but it's time that we come out into a fullness of manifestation and cry out like a child will cry out oh my father i'm coming to you lord oh jesus take my life and let it be crop secret lord to thee take my moments and my days let me walk oh god in the fullness of praise and honor and glory to your marvelous name let us walk out my friends from the the prison of time [Music] into the endless ages of omega with confidence knowing that we are coming back to a time of endless peace a time of endless fulfillment and love the love of god and the love for each other are spoken of in revelation chapter 21 verses 1 to 8 as i conclude i would like to read this and i saw a new heaven a new earth for the first heaven on the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea and i john saw the heavenly city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the tron said behold i make all things new and he said unto me right for these things are true and faithful and he said unto me it isn't done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountain of the water of life freely and he that overcome it shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son god bless you daughter god bless you son and may the great holy spirit lead you and guide you to the perfect light give your heart your life to him surrender to him be baptized in water in his name do not just say oh i'm i believe i go through this or go to you're not enough for you to believe that time has come for you to be long belong to him surrender your heart surrender your life and say lord i am yours let us pray gracious father we thank thee for the word may the word find its resting place may it rest upon the altars of our heart and find a nesting place father for your glory and honor with the forgiveness of our sins the cleansing of our heart and the acceptance of your children into your wonderful and marvelous glory amen and amen the peace of god passing all men's understanding rest and remain with us all from this moment amen and amen god bless you my brothers and [Music] sisters [Music] you
