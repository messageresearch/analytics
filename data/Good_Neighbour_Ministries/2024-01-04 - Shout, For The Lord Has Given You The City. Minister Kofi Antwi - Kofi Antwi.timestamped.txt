[29:48] Lord had his blessing may everyone be
[29:56] seated we
[29:58] all
[30:00] have seen the scripture that we
[30:06] read back
[30:08] then it was referring to
[30:12] Israel scripture have compound
[30:16] meaning today the scripture is referring
[30:18] to you and
[30:21] I because God is speaking to us when we
[30:26] read this scripture
[30:28] this scripture is speaking to we the
[30:31] wife of
[30:34] Christ
[30:35] because when we
[30:38] check we are in number of what
[30:42] four right four is the bride
[30:47] number we are in
[30:50] 2004 four is the number of what the
[30:56] bride which is the wife of
[31:00] Christ we have turned a
[31:05] corner we are in the last
[31:08] hour the last of the last
[31:12] hour Hallelujah we are no
[31:17] more going to be bapes in the word of
[31:21] God because God has babed us for too
[31:26] long
[31:28] so the hour is
[31:31] late that's why I don't
[31:36] know even this
[31:38] scripture where brother FIP read I can
[31:41] read it but I can't read it reg continue
[31:46] seriously so I have to let the brother
[31:48] help me to read it but I don't know it's
[31:51] burning on my
[31:54] heart and I says Lord
[31:58] okay if that's the way you want me to
[32:00] bring it when I come here I'll let one
[32:02] of my brother read it for
[32:07] me the Lord is saying to
[32:10] us the seven seal was open in
[32:15] 19663 most of us wasn't
[32:18] born right we were not born yet most of
[32:23] us in the message I know some of
[32:28] our pastor age they were born young men
[32:32] and they came in they cut hold of the
[32:36] message and God has used them we thank
[32:39] God for that for their
[32:41] age but the age has moved
[32:45] on changes has come whether you like it
[32:49] or
[32:50] not as the Lord is saying to us now as I
[32:56] was with Moses
[32:58] Moes my servant Moses is
[33:03] dead brother Abraham is gone he's not
[33:07] coming
[33:09] back we're going to meet him over there
[33:13] am so now the Baton is who pass on the
[33:19] young man through Pastor Simon age that
[33:23] came their age they are now passing on
[33:27] the what the
[33:30] message to
[33:32] us now the Baton has become us to take
[33:36] it so the Lord is saying to
[33:41] us as I was with Moses so would I be
[33:45] unto you 1.2 is saying my servant Moses
[33:50] is dead now Joshua arise so count
[33:55] yourself
[33:58] as Joshua generation
[34:02] hallu because Joshua
[34:05] generation you are going to go into the
[34:09] land which the Lord God swear unto our
[34:13] forefathers all the prophecy that he
[34:17] prophesy in the Bible concerning the
[34:20] bride we are the one that are going to
[34:24] fulfill
[34:25] it so you don't have
[34:28] to be a
[34:31] babe Joshua is not going to babe
[34:35] you there's no time for for big
[34:40] children and let me tell you we live in
[34:43] the
[34:44] hour all
[34:46] those that are false preachers calling
[34:51] themselves five four Ministry that have
[34:54] hold RAB into the message age into the
[34:58] mess age this is the hour let me tell
[35:02] you Joshua is
[35:04] hereu I said Joshua is here to lose
[35:09] Rahab from all the mess age and bring
[35:15] her into the
[35:18] life
[35:20] that she will know her hour her time her
[35:25] season because we live in a season
[35:29] whereby if we could
[35:32] look Israel right now as I'm
[35:36] speaking right one time Samson took a
[35:39] Jawbone and slew thousands Philistines
[35:42] in Gaza right today it's not a Jawbone
[35:48] it's
[35:48] gun but it's still the same
[35:53] thing they are slowing and slaughtering
[35:57] the Philistines whether you like it or
[36:00] not it's the same thing they are
[36:04] doing right what hour they are living in
[36:08] because before they were
[36:10] sleeping they were
[36:13] slacks during the time of
[36:16] Moses people still remember why he was
[36:20] taking them through the Wilderness they
[36:23] remember the Egyptian
[36:25] gar they love the Egyptian Gar so they
[36:28] won't line up they won't worship God
[36:31] they won't obey God but during the time
[36:35] of Joshua when Joshua is taking
[36:39] over let me tell you are you with us or
[36:44] are you against
[36:46] us this is the hour God is saying are
[36:52] you with me or are you against me
[36:56] because
[36:57] I'm doing new thing that you don't know
[37:01] because William Braham is
[37:04] dead I'm going to do new things in
[37:07] you I've given you the
[37:10] land go and possess it Hallelujah every
[37:14] demon that is holding you have to break
[37:17] because this is the fourth number of
[37:20] what four the bride the wife of Christ
[37:24] time every de demon or tradition or
[37:29] culture or anything that is bandag on
[37:32] you have to be
[37:35] break religious spirit have to
[37:38] broke because
[37:40] God is fixing to
[37:43] move if you are not going to move you're
[37:46] going to be left behind because God is
[37:49] serious about his work to fulfill it and
[37:53] if you are part line up we are not here
[37:57] for joke we are not here to play church
[38:00] we are not here to play lovey lovey or
[38:04] or religious fantasy or to look one
[38:07] another oh this brother is good or this
[38:09] brother is not good or whatever all we
[38:12] are here for is to fulfill the word of
[38:16] God with th say the
[38:20] Lord
[38:21] Jesus when Joshua is here Joshua t
[38:26] Christ I know that and Joshua also you
[38:30] can type yourself into what Joshua is
[38:34] saying
[38:36] Jericho won't give up easy the king
[38:41] Jericho King type
[38:43] Satan he would love to bind you chain
[38:47] you chain you with the things of the
[38:50] world sometime chain you with bu work
[38:54] business uh your wife your children your
[38:57] your your your husband but you got to
[39:01] shake it out anything that would be
[39:03] taking you away from the word of God for
[39:07] this hour is of the devil we got to call
[39:11] it as it is come out and take the Cross
[39:15] of Christ so that Christ will get the
[39:18] glory are you with us or are you against
[39:21] us because Joshua there is no time for
[39:25] nothing
[39:27] because brother William Braham if you
[39:30] check the way he used to preach in his
[39:33] time he didn't have a good name amongst
[39:36] the people even his own people that were
[39:40] around him didn't like him most of them
[39:43] didn't like him and if you going to
[39:46] stand for Christ you're not going to get
[39:49] a good name you're going to be
[39:53] persecuted you're going to be hated you
[39:56] going to be called all kinds of
[39:59] name that's where it's you alone and
[40:05] Christ you alone and Christ but if you
[40:09] stand by Christ Christ will stand by
[40:14] you
[40:16] Joshua never
[40:18] fail it is so
[40:21] read
[40:22] Joshua get the people
[40:25] together and
[40:29] said follow
[40:31] me everything I
[40:34] say don't
[40:36] question do it you don't need to
[40:39] understand you don't need to reason you
[40:43] don't need to question those question
[40:45] days are over because it's the Holy
[40:51] Spirit which is the Lord Jesus
[40:54] Christ going to
[40:57] leaders and why he's
[40:59] leading there's no
[41:02] argument there's no by
[41:04] biting there's no
[41:07] hypocrisy because
[41:10] God when he's leading like
[41:14] that all the people when they surrender
[41:18] everything God want for them he will
[41:24] accomplishing brothers and sisters
[41:27] we so many of us has been in the message
[41:30] for so
[41:31] long we have seen so much
[41:34] things we have seen hypocrisy we have
[41:37] seen good thing we have seen the power
[41:38] of God we have all kinds of things we
[41:41] have
[41:42] seen what was that God was training
[41:47] us God was molding us but the time has
[41:53] come the season has come
[41:56] God is
[41:58] saying the babysitter Days Are
[42:01] Over Joshua is
[42:04] here from the pastor to the
[42:08] Pew when I'm talking I'm not talking to
[42:11] the congregation alone I I
[42:14] like our brothers or our pastor will say
[42:17] I point four finger to myself and one
[42:21] point
[42:23] you so there's no going to be
[42:27] look
[42:28] one you have to love God with all your
[42:34] heart with all your mind with all your
[42:38] soul with everything that you have in
[42:41] you surrendering to God so that the word
[42:45] will be fulfilled there's no time for
[42:48] playing
[42:49] Church playing Church won't do
[42:54] it playing church will not do
[42:58] it
[43:00] reasons won't do it a lot of people can
[43:04] read brother Brown message they can tell
[43:06] us
[43:07] from from one of his message to 1,200 of
[43:12] his message but where is the power of
[43:16] God where is the power of God I'm
[43:20] speaking to the congregation but also is
[43:22] going out so I have to let them see most
[43:26] of them have preached preach preach
[43:28] preach preach preach there's not even
[43:30] one Vindication of their preaching and
[43:33] they call themselves five4 Ministry no
[43:37] God is not like that listen as I preach
[43:41] if I don't see God proven to me I have
[43:45] to step
[43:47] down and let the one that can do do
[43:52] because we are in the time of Joshua
[43:55] days
[43:57] and Joshua days is not going to be
[43:59] joke it's not going to be uh lukewarm
[44:03] and playing
[44:05] Church even let me tell you one man with
[44:09] God is
[44:11] majority if you look at Israel now they
[44:14] are telling lebano if you don't shut up
[44:17] you see what we have did to Gaza we are
[44:20] going to do the same thing to
[44:22] you and we the bride have to tell the
[44:26] devil if he doesn't get away from us we
[44:30] are going to kick him out because we
[44:34] have God in us God already live in you
[44:38] if you are the wife of Christ Christ
[44:41] already live in you everything you need
[44:44] to do the job is already in
[44:48] you
[44:50] amen
[44:52] so you have to tell
[44:54] him the power is given to
[44:58] you the gun to shoot the enemy is on
[45:02] your
[45:03] side you are holding the gun the enemy
[45:07] don't have a gun and you going to be
[45:10] scared of the
[45:12] enemy right no we're not going to be
[45:17] grasshoppers we have to take the land as
[45:21] God commanded
[45:24] Joshua as brother Abraham delivered the
[45:28] message that God gave it to him onto us
[45:32] one thing I
[45:33] saw it was make my heart
[45:38] sad some Pastor the place we went in
[45:43] Ghana the God is changed like
[45:47] here and the pastor sent the new one
[45:50] sent me two people baptizing in brother
[45:54] Abraham name I have it in mind I think
[45:58] brother deson have it said brother see
[46:00] what is going on is that what the
[46:03] prophet left
[46:07] us
[46:10] no devils are already
[46:15] impersonating the
[46:17] message making that's why they call us
[46:20] Braham might this might D might this
[46:23] that that all kinds of names but let me
[46:26] tell
[46:28] you because the
[46:31] message is
[46:33] true if it is true give all your
[46:37] life support it with all your
[46:41] life and let God possess you God is
[46:46] ready as brother Brown says but the
[46:48] people are not ready is the hour God is
[46:52] saying I am ready are you ready are you
[46:55] are you going to be obedient to him are
[46:58] you going to let him do what he want to
[47:00] do with you let me tell you the God we
[47:04] serve is not a dead God we don't want a
[47:07] God on the W no sir we don't want you to
[47:11] tell me about what brother brah did no
[47:14] say it's good I love it but all those
[47:18] things are wonderful but let me tell you
[47:21] if it doesn't produce the power of God
[47:23] then it's painted fire on the
[47:26] War I don't need
[47:29] that I need God in a
[47:32] skin God in
[47:35] reality because the Lord says my word
[47:38] will never return unto me void it will
[47:42] accomplish what I have spoken during the
[47:46] time of the Apostles when they speak
[47:49] they speak there were man with few words
[47:52] but there were men also some of them
[47:55] were are literate like even I'm better
[47:58] than them but when they speak they speak
[48:00] with boldness they speak with authority
[48:04] because Jesus has been with them
[48:07] Hallelujah and they have Jesus inside
[48:09] them but I'm sorry to say in the message
[48:16] we have a lot of preachers claiming to
[48:18] be preachers they don't have Jesus in
[48:21] them they have the cause of brother
[48:24] Braham message
[48:26] in them but this is the hour the time of
[48:30] Joshua this is the hour whether you like
[48:33] it or not it's upon you it's upon me as
[48:38] I preach it's upon me also we have to
[48:42] take the gospel seriously let me tell
[48:46] you and possess the gates of the enemy
[48:50] and let this word of God guide us lead
[48:55] us and prove to us that God live that
[48:58] brother Braham God that people has tried
[49:02] to mess his name is a real God it's not
[49:06] a dead God he a god of the pill of fire
[49:11] who does not change he a consuming fire
[49:15] the same way he was with Israelites the
[49:18] same way he has come to as Gentiles amen
[49:24] brothers and S
[49:26] sister this is the hour number of four
[49:31] and number of four is your
[49:34] number right five type what Grace four
[49:39] type what the bride I am not a big
[49:43] educated person but the little that I
[49:47] know I know that number four is my
[49:50] number right so if you don't know that
[49:53] four is your number
[49:56] if we are in the year
[49:59] 2004 and I go to Ghana I see the guard
[50:05] changing the pastor that was there is
[50:08] old filing away and another coming has
[50:12] coming our pastor going out another has
[50:16] come coming I believe the true five4
[50:21] Ministry the old preachers like Pastor
[50:24] Simon age
[50:26] most of them are going to give way for
[50:29] the youngs to come in the true ones but
[50:32] you know those that are not true they're
[50:37] going to hold on with still Egyptian gar
[50:41] gun to shoot but that one won do nothing
[50:46] but let me tell you thank God for a true
[50:50] Pastor thank God for our Pastor John
[50:54] Simon he has passed the
[50:57] touch the touch has been passed and it
[51:01] has fall on our
[51:03] brother let us
[51:06] not leave him alone so that you alone
[51:10] will be carrying the ark and me alone
[51:13] carrying the ark nobody is there we have
[51:16] to be faithful coming to
[51:19] service
[51:21] faithful
[51:23] testifying faithful with ning faithful
[51:27] cleaning our life so that the Holy
[51:30] Spirit can move and do the job that it
[51:33] will be easy for the
[51:36] brother while he step here the holy
[51:39] spirit will take over
[51:41] him and we the brothers that God has
[51:46] chose from me the leas to brother Tim de
[51:53] brother Christopher brother Desmond
[51:54] brother Philip and who God ever will
[51:57] choose wherever they step here the holy
[52:00] spirit will just come in and do the job
[52:05] then we won't see the brother we will
[52:07] see God moving when God is in action
[52:11] it's a different story right the trumpet
[52:15] the last trumpet has sounded whether we
[52:18] like it or not it has
[52:22] sounded God is saying to us
[52:26] the message the seven seal was open
[52:29] 1963 William Bram died
[52:33] 1965 so he babysitters
[52:36] babysitter he did
[52:39] babysit but now there's no more
[52:42] babysitter no more if you see a brother
[52:45] that coming wouldn't take the message
[52:47] talking against it tell him brother
[52:50] either you take it or
[52:53] go either you take it or go there's no
[52:57] time to joke ex sister the same
[53:00] way one thing I have learned in my
[53:03] life before you meet people you share
[53:06] the message you talk talk talk talk you
[53:09] think you can do the job you cannot do
[53:13] anything it's God that does the job is
[53:17] the holy spirit that does the
[53:21] job and when the Holy Spirit is doing
[53:24] the job
[53:25] is not hard one
[53:29] word you see the hard
[53:32] turn things change the person will be
[53:36] ready to follow what you said Eugene is
[53:41] sitting here when I met him it wasn't
[53:44] difficult that night we just spoke and
[53:48] why I was about to finish brother phlip

[54:11] day is God he used me he used brother
[54:15] Peter that
[54:17] day he gone for his
[54:20] reward so brothers and sisters what am I
