course tonight love to speak on the seed of the nickelodeons our scripture for this evening is found in revelation chapter 2 reading verse 6 and this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nicolaitans which i also hate let us pray dear god our gracious and loving heavenly father we ask your blessing upon the breaking of the bread of life may the word of truth go forth tonight with great power and inspiration reaching the hearts and the lives of those who desire they everlasting eternal bread of life bless us tonight we pray and may the great holy spirit shower down upon us eagle's food food for now and evermore we ask it in jesus christ's name amen and amen praise be to god hallelujah revelation chapter 2 verse 6 but this thou hast that thou hate us the deeds of the nicolaitans which i also hate of course we are talking about the seed of nicolaitanism and we know friends that everything actually has its beginnings in the book of genesis genesis of course which means beginnings genesis is also the seed book where it's a nursery where everything finds its origin and come to its maturity in the later or last days so we find that in this book of genesis if i might give uh nicolasianism just a brief word picture in the form of one called nimrod you may look that up in the book of genesis you may study it um in your bible dictionaries wherever you may find his name but what you will find is that he was the first person to ever dominate domineer control groups and companies of men the first one to form an army and place men into battalions and and so on with captains over them and was able to conquer and rule the then known world from this we also want to expand now there were two thoughts about what the nickelodeons were what are they who are they now it was said that they are a group of apostates who their founder was nicholas of antioch a proselyte to christianity who became one of the seven deacons in the church at jerusalem they had pagan feasts and during this feast it was a time of uncleanness on chase behavior ungodly unclean loosed uh sexuality going on amongst them and his thought was that to conquer the sin of sexuality or to master it one had to engage in it and know it by experience before one could have control over it one must go through the whole range of it and of course we know that this loose sexuality of corruption degradation and perversion was an offshoot of nicolasianism by and from their leader of course inspired by satan uh nicholas of antioch listen he was a deacon he was in the church he was a part of that early church and yet the spirit of the white horse rider was already upon him trying to lead the church of god astray lead the church of god off of the word of god now naturally that kind of teaching gave way and gives way in our day to all manner of perversions loose living sexualities of all manners uh as we see it communes compounds man in the modern day uh gathering groups of people under the influence of of their religious teaching and belief and amongst them comes this spirit of nicolasianism with its corruption degradation and all manner of evil we understand that this of course uh we can follow it back to eden from the seeds that were planted or grown in eden and there we see an eden in the garden of eden the tree of good and evil amen and also we find that the the tree of life of course friends not only that will follow it down and we see it manifested in jezebel and the spirit of jezebel that continues on down to this day jezebel manifesting that sensual domineering controlling and corrupting influence that is in the church and in the world today another tree of course is balaam balaam with his false teaching leading god's people from completely away from the word of god and if i might mention he also use money financial money to obligate folks uh to have them uh either borrowing from him or giving them or obligating them by gifts and bringing them under his control and uh domination that way so by teaching and by financial help and financial gifts he was able to maintain a control over the people that were under his charge and that's how he corrupted and conquered those that were under him just as nicholas did the same now friends we find here that this has to continue it continued in the early church and in every age right on down to this very age until it is finally blessed or unexalted or the deeds actions and teachings are destroyed and cast into the lake of fire by our god the book of revelation chapter 2 2 says the ephesian church of course said you could not bear these evil ones amongst you and so they put some of them put them out praise god hallelujah amen but now later in the age we are finding out they're not putting them out anymore they're bearing them or may i put it this way they're putting up with them within the confines of the church that is why judgment must begin in the house of god see it must begin in god's house so then first my friends they got influenced into doing the deeds that these nicolaitans were doing they became influence and impotent the seeds that were in ephesus will continue through the other ages until it becomes a doctrine deeds then doctrine and that will go right on until it is completely cast into the lake of fire now or these nickelodeons the words nico comes from the greek word which means to conquer and laos means the laity or in other words neglection to conquer the laity somebody is doing something or was doing something and in our day is doing something in plain view which was conquering and dominating the laity now if the lady was being conquered then it must be some kind of authority over that laity like nimrod was back then conquering dominating and domineering over the laity what was it that god hated what was it that was happening in that early church what was going on then and is now going on today that is exactly what nicolaitanism is the people were being subject in some way that was absolutely contrary to the word of god and bringing them into the subjection of man through the means of men now friends here a spiritual matter like this is always com uh you know composed of two parts two parts whatsoever as i've mentioned before black and white uh truth and error you know right and wrong it's always that way religion and the spirit world are like that like two trees as i mentioned in the garden that were so close together that their branches were actually intertwined one mixing in to the other now we know of course uh evil stood in the midst of the garden just as much as truth and good there was the tree of life and there was a tree of knowledge that was in the garden there see and that same paradox continues on today the church is made up of both good and bad to our this very day the church is not just a a complete pure uh group of people but the church is made up of good and a bad the two vines twins in the beginning cain and abel the two vines the two trees growing together branches intertwined interrelated within the very uh formation of what we call the church of this day just like jesus spoke of the wheat and the tears and by the way while he was here judas was here see it's like that all down through the bible paul comes to the scene and then he said now friends he says i'm departing but i tell you there are ravening wolves from among your own cells arise men that become ravening wolves right amongst you they're not cheap but they are wolves in sheep's clothing calling themselves christianity and the christians and they are not and behaving in such a way that their nature and and life manifests not god the spirit of the living god but manifests the spirit of nickelodeonism and the spirit of satan working and operating through them in the religious realm under the cloak the guise of religion take off that mask too many are wearing this kind of a sham clothing on we must see you and we do see you by the light of the word in you are in clear view and we discern you by the opening of the word thanks be to god that he has revealed his word to his people who can say i can see clearly now the rain is gone oh thank god all the clouds all of the gloom all of the all of the fog it is it's blasted away it's burnt away because the sun is up and shining upon us and we give god the glory and the honor and the praise today thanks be to god hallelujah but here we are talking about the wheat and the tears growing up together in the same field in the same church in the same womb growing up together side by side a spirit of jacob a spirit of esau working together and one having to call the other my brother the other called the other my brother oh it's right here in your bible but one is true and the other one is false now god will speak to each one you know god spoke to abel but he wanted us to know that not only does he speak to true believers but he speaks to the evil ones also for in your bible in genesis chapter 4 you'll read a brief scripture which says and god said on to cain chapter 4 i believe verse 4 and also verse 6 you'll find the phrase and god said also unto cain so god speak to cain and cain could make the claim that god said god said god said god spoke to him too and you cannot deny it but it must be compared with the original word of god where we can be able to cut through all of the the interruptions all of the voices all of these things and go right straight to the truth of the revelation of the word of god amen so we find speaking to both groups true and false two brothers one true one false and god will call them together the church together he will call them the church so you see then my friends only when when god's word goes out it goes out not only to the true believer for it depends on your hearing and seeing for faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god now one two are sitting in the same church on the same pews both listening to the same message and some will hear it and receive the revelation of it the inner form the inner revelation and understanding while others will hear the same thing and hear the intellectually educated part of it understand it understand english be able to parse it analyze it and debate about it and compare scriptures about it and never arriving at the truth my god friends take a whip this is going on right now while we're speaking we're right within the houses of worship the churches so-called of god the assemblies the groups it's going on right now as we speak the holy spirit but nevertheless only the elect will really be able to discern and know what truly is the spirit of god and only the elect shall not be deceived matthew 24 24 and we understand why they cannot be deceived for they are themselves part of that word chosen in him as a part of himself from before the foundations of the world for he was in there were in his mind and they came forth in their due time as god would have them manifest in whatever age he wanted them to be made manifest they become out manifested not knowing consciously that they're a part of that word of god or or a part of the word or portion of the word germ of the word seed of the word was deposited in them and that they are here to fulfill god's divine purpose and plan for his glory and for his honor how do they know they themselves don't know how they know but they are able to discern and recognize my friends the spirit of god and the spirit of error as it approaches them or tries to communicate with them the scripture says for their shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall shew great signs and wonders amen in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive thee very elected if it were possible it is not possible because if we are part of the word we are as eternal as god himself is eternal if god himself cannot be deceived how can the true genuine believer be deceived they cannot hallelujah for they cannot deny themselves something in them for we have a witness will witness to us that's right that's wrong the holy spirit in you will lead you and guide you for his glory and in his mighty name oh thanks be under god hallelujah amen yes friends back there in early days of the original pentecost acts chapter 2 verse 4 for a short period of time after that we find out they had a wonderful time in the presence of god and then that false vine that tree of knowledge began to interweave and intertwine itself together in that early church and entangle itself with the true vine and then we find the deeds of the nickelodeons in that early first church of in jerusalem and many today are claiming they are the first church but this is what happened in the first early church that was there the spirit of nicolasianism began to arise amongst them from saint nick saint nicholas is where this spirit of domination and dominar domineering man-made domineering came from right there and that spirit is right in the church and in the name of christ and in the name of the church fighting the true vine the true seed the original seeds sons and daughters of the living god that lives and moves and have their being by the word of god they are fighting against the true vine and will continue until they are destroyed by god now my friends what was the spiritual climate then in the ephesian church that would allow saint nick nicholas of antioch this proselyte to christianity what then was the atmosphere in the ephesian church that was so on fire and anointed by the ministry of paul timothy luke many others that were anointed by the holy spirit and left them the the original faith the faith that was of our fathers given to the apostolic fathers what was the climate in that ephesian church the bible tells us clearly thou has left thy first love they lost the fire the glory of god had departed the spirit of god was not amongst them as he was at the first amen they left their first love which is the word their first love for the word and that happens anywhere in any church with any believer they can make all the claims they want but their life their action their actions speak louder than their than their words that they have left their first love and wandered away from the word of god hallelujah fallen from its origin which of course was pentecost praise god hallelujah my friends we find out the true church then was in danger in danger from being taken away from the leading of the holy spirit and the control and preeminence of the holy spirit this is exactly what took place when moses led the churn of israel in out of egypt and brought them forth to lead them to the promised land and you see god's way of leading them was by a pillar of fire by night a cloud by day and by god chosen god elected and by god anointed god equipped and god ordained man to be on the scene and god would lead control that entire camp by the leadership of the holy spirit god above us back then in the old testament with israel it was god above us in the purifying cloud of fire and then god among us in god anointed men displayed of course in jesus christ followed by the apostles and so on until this damn time and now the unveiling of god the son of man being revealed again now it is god in us the infilling the possession of the presence of the heavenly father in the true seed wheat seed bride of jesus christ for in that age that day you shall know that i am in the father the father in me and that i am in you glory to god and that is this day praise god forevermore that the blessed holy spirit lives in us moves in us walks in us acts in us talks in us and does everything through us for the glory of god remember this is all supernatural let me say that in a way that you can understand it clear clearer it's super but it's natural it's natural but it's super so we are normal but the holy spirit flows out of us the anointing flows out of us the inspiration the revelation flows out of us god moves and works through his bride in this day and in this hour praise god by prophetic utterance miracles signs and wonders by the opening of the word god anointing his sons and his daughters to declare himself and to make his word known today aren't you happy today my friend aren't you happy wherever you are that we serve not a dead god but the true and a living god who works and moves jesus christ hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever thanks be unto god hallelujah but we find out that they rebelled against god and they rebelled and they wanted two things they wanted a system of a set of rules one they wanted a system or set of rules predictable for them to live and walk and march by secondly they wanted to have a visible king over them like the other nations and today we say demon nations denominations they wanted to have a superintendent an apostle of prophet whatever above them they wanted to have that kind of a visible leadership listen friends god use a prophet god use men of god to guide us to the perfect light once we've seen the light it's not the prophet it's not the apostle it's not the superintendent it's you and him alone not my brother not my sister it's me o lord standing in the need of prayer not my father not my brother not the pastor not the deacon it's you it's me it's the individual must surrender themselves to the leadership and guidance of the holy spirit for he shall be called wonderful counsel of the mighty god he is the governor and he governs us and guides us not only our savior but he is our lord oh thanks be to god that we have him as our savior our redeemer and we have him in our lives with lordship over us leading us how by the revelation of the word what is being revealed in the moment in time and it will always agree with that which is written it will not be different but it will be exactly what is in the word and so they wanted the king they wanted to be like the rest of groups and churches that seem to be wonderful and successful with walled cities we will not talk about that or discuss those walled cities now because we still have the walled cities named churches name groups name denominations now that they protect and surround it and everything else with all manner of spiritual armaments to make sure that they have their numbers and everything else that's another discussion but they do have these denominations around and the people wanted to leave and that is the reason why they couldn't understand moses they couldn't they can't understand really spirit-led spirit-filled and anointed men of god for today because people are looking for a definite written or spoken set of rules that they are to live by but when a man or a woman or a person moves by the holy spirit where does the wind blows where it lists no man knows where it goes because it's led by the holy spirit they're confused by it and uh the world has taught them to have confidence in systems and rules line one line two line three line four it's all there and they have to live by that uh in that kind of a regimented uh system that they have and still saying they're free my friends but when they come into something where they the holy spirit controls it to them it seems like confusion so to them it seems like an excuse for chaos they don't understand that the rain comes from a rugged jagged sky there is no form no crumbliness no shape it comes as god brings it by the blessed holy spirit anointed and guided by the living one who lives and works and moves within our hearts hallelujah yes sir and so we find out it moved then from just being a deed necklacianism began to become a doctrine notice carefully i said it moved from just being deeds of the nickelodeons they started to put forth teaching which would be doctrines of the nickelodeons and it started so quietly innocently under the guise of religion but it pushed aside the truth it pushed aside the light of the word of god it started small and quietly it began to take over inoffensively it seemed as if it was even sound but it was contrary to the word of god for like a python like an anaconda it slowly placed its coils around and begin to squeeze the breath of life out of the church and to kill out spirituality that was in the church we ought to know what we are doing it ought to be done this way this way this way one two three four and we have our books we have our uh fundamentals we have our our standards of and so on and you can live by that uh you see praise god we are gonna set the word of god in order so you can understand it and then you go live by that oh my the holy spirit is not able to according to them to be able to do that for himself to his own believers amen oh my friend the false vine is subtle very subtle comes in like an angel of light until it gets a hold of you i hope he does not get the hold of you i believe of course in leadership but it is not the leadership of man i believe in the leadership of the holy spirit leading his people and working through the word i believe that god has also god has set in the church as you know in the book of ephesians apostles prophets teachers evangelists and so on in the word of god who are gifted they're moved by the holy spirit they're under his guidance so it's still the holy spirit using man to keep the church of god in order hallelujah praise god hallelujah amen i believe god sends men and men does the work of god for his glory but the rule is by the word by the word and so it is not men that are really ruling and guiding the church it's the holy spirit in and through those men that are leading and guiding the church as the scripture tells us in hebrews 13 7 remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of god whose revelation whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation the end of their journey where they're going to end up that's where you're going to end up if you follow their revelation where that revelation is leading to so my friends here we see here clearly in the word of god the false vine was getting a hold and beginning to teach on the rulership of man we will get into a lot more of this in our next bible study on the seven church ages as we continue to study to unveil and disclose what who and how of nicolaitanism then and nickelodeonism now make no mistake about it the spirit of nickelodeonism is here and make no mistake about it god also has men through whom he works so that he is actually the leader god above us anointing on the shepherds and leading his church through those anointed gifted god-equipped man through the blessed holy spirit may god bless you my friends rejoice in the lord eat from the lord's table break from this bread of life listen to it again and straighten your soul and in your wisdom and drink the clear fresh waters of the ever-present living waters from the rock may god bless you until next week god bless you real god [Music] you
