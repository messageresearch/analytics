[59:51] amen first Samuel chapter 17.
[59:56] first Samuel 17.
[1:00:06] first Samuel chapter 17.
[1:00:11] um let's start reading that verse 31.
[1:00:16] first Samuel 17 and 31.
[1:00:21] the Bible says if you haven't say man
[1:00:24] the Bible says and when the words were
[1:00:27] heard which David spake they rehearsed
[1:00:30] them before Saul and he went and he sent
[1:00:34] for him and David said to Saul let no
[1:00:38] man's heart fail because of him
[1:00:41] thy servant will go and fight with the
[1:00:44] philistine and Saul said to David thou
[1:00:48] are not able to go against this
[1:00:50] philistine
[1:00:51] to fight with him for thou art but a
[1:00:54] youth and he a man of war
[1:00:59] from his Youth and David said unto Saul
[1:01:01] the servant kept his father's sheep and
[1:01:05] there came a lion and a bear and took a
[1:01:09] lamb out of the flock and I went after
[1:01:13] him and smote him and delivered
[1:01:18] it out of the mouth and when he arose
[1:01:21] against me I caught him by his beard and
[1:01:24] schmote him and slew him thy servant
[1:01:28] slew both The Lion and the bear and this
[1:01:32] uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one
[1:01:35] of them seeing that he have defied the
[1:01:39] armies of the Living God David said
[1:01:42] moreover moreover the Lord
[1:01:46] that delivered me out of the Paw of the
[1:01:48] lion and out of the Paw of the bear he
[1:01:51] will deliver me out of the hand of this
[1:01:54] Philistine and Saul said unto David go
[1:01:57] and the Lord be with thee
[1:02:00] amen Hebrews chapter 11.
[1:02:11] Hebrews chapter
[1:02:13] 11.
[1:02:17] started verse 1.
[1:02:19] the Bible says now Faith is the
[1:02:21] substance of things hoped for the
[1:02:23] evidence of Things Not Seen for by it
[1:02:26] the elders obtained a great report
[1:02:28] through faith we understand that the
[1:02:32] words were the world was framed by the
[1:02:34] word of God so that things which are
[1:02:38] seen were not made of things which do
[1:02:41] appear by faith Abel offered unto God
[1:02:44] and more excellent sacrifice than Cain
[1:02:47] by which he obtained witness that he was
[1:02:50] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[1:02:54] and by it
[1:02:56] he being dead yet speaketh by faith
[1:02:59] Enoch was translated
[1:03:01] that he should not see death and was not
[1:03:05] found because God has translated him for
[1:03:08] before the translation he had this
[1:03:11] testimony that he pleased God but
[1:03:14] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:03:16] him for he that cometh to God must
[1:03:20] believe that he is and that he is a
[1:03:24] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:03:27] him
[1:03:28] he's a rewarder of them that diligently
[1:03:32] seek him
[1:03:34] that's his word
[1:03:35] God can't take that back
[1:03:38] seek Him diligently he has to reward you
[1:03:43] amen may the Lord bless you love his
[1:03:44] word you can have your seats
[1:03:51] let's get the Lord a hand clap of praise
[1:03:58] amen
[1:04:03] today by God's grace
[1:04:07] we want to put the nail in the coffin
[1:04:11] amen
[1:04:13] because we we we understand
[1:04:16] uh and I hope you understand
[1:04:18] that what God has been doing with us
[1:04:21] this weekend is something special
[1:04:24] you know and you have to take what God
[1:04:27] has done to the next battle amen and
[1:04:31] this morning by God's grace my subject
[1:04:34] is
[1:04:34] Faith by experience
[1:04:37] Faith by experience you know if we would
[1:04:42] just listen to you know some of the
[1:04:45] different things that you know the
[1:04:47] prophet of God said about faith first of
[1:04:50] all the Bible says
[1:04:52] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:04:54] for
[1:04:55] so it's it's it's it's a it's a
[1:04:58] substance amen
[1:05:00] amen it's something that's obtainable
[1:05:04] it's something that's tangible
[1:05:06] hallelujah it's faith is not an
[1:05:09] imagination
[1:05:11] faith is something that can go and bring
[1:05:14] into existence that which you're
[1:05:16] Desiring
[1:05:18] but I want to say to you that that same
[1:05:20] Faith this morning can become an
[1:05:23] experience amen and once you have an
[1:05:26] experience with faith it'll work the
[1:05:28] same way every time once you meet those
[1:05:31] conditions because it becomes something
[1:05:34] that you know had taken place see David
[1:05:38] Hallelujah had faith in God but the
[1:05:41] faith that he had in God became a
[1:05:44] literal experience
[1:05:46] not once Hallelujah but twice and when
[1:05:49] he came when he came to the battle what
[1:05:51] was he coming with he was coming with an
[1:05:54] experience
[1:05:55] Hallelujah knowing that the same God
[1:05:58] that delivered me out of the bare hands
[1:06:00] the same God that delivered me out of
[1:06:03] the mouth of the lion is the same God
[1:06:05] that'll fight this battle for me
[1:06:08] Hallelujah and what I'm saying Church
[1:06:10] Hallelujah I know without a shadow of a
[1:06:13] doubt God gave somebody in this room and
[1:06:16] experienced last night
[1:06:18] Hallelujah come on somebody
[1:06:21] I know God gave you an experience and
[1:06:24] now you have to apply your faith to that
[1:06:27] experience and when the Devil Comes you
[1:06:30] say oh no
[1:06:31] oh no devil it's too late
[1:06:35] it's too late
[1:06:37] I know that my redeemer living
[1:06:39] Hallelujah
[1:06:42] it's too late
[1:06:44] hallelujah it's too late I've been
[1:06:47] touched by the hands of the almighty God
[1:06:50] see now what God is doing he's giving
[1:06:54] you an experience
[1:06:55] and once you get an experience the devil
[1:06:58] can't fight that
[1:07:02] oh
[1:07:03] Hallelujah see let's look at an
[1:07:05] experienced Churchill well let's back up
[1:07:07] to Faith amen the prophet of God when he
[1:07:10] began to talk about faith listen if I
[1:07:13] just take if I just take the word
[1:07:15] experience
[1:07:16] experience means proving
[1:07:21] what God was doing Hallelujah for us
[1:07:23] this weekend was proving himself
[1:07:26] Hallelujah we read about it we heard
[1:07:29] about it but then God came and made it a
[1:07:31] reality
[1:07:33] and we can leave this weekend saying I
[1:07:36] know God I know him I'm not a liar
[1:07:39] Hallelujah I know him I love him what he
[1:07:42] did amen it was something that became a
[1:07:45] reality
[1:07:46] Hallelujah God proved himself Hallelujah
[1:07:50] and if he has it to you today I
[1:07:53] challenge you to get out of your own way
[1:07:55] because he's real
[1:07:57] God is real
[1:07:59] the God we serve is not some God or the
[1:08:02] tombstone that can't talk he's not some
[1:08:06] some some pole with with ink drawn on
[1:08:09] his face that can't see he's real our
[1:08:12] God is a person he can talk he can touch
[1:08:17] Hallelujah he can respond to you
[1:08:21] Hallelujah oh my look Church the prophet
[1:08:26] of God said Hallelujah you can have a
[1:08:28] service and an anointing can fall in
[1:08:30] that service and you can come back to
[1:08:32] the next service and pick up the same
[1:08:34] anointing

[1:09:15] and how much you hunger for the things
[1:09:17] of God listen let me say hello this
[1:09:20] morning the outcome of the service is
[1:09:23] not based upon how good I preach

[1:10:12] to pull for he said we have to believe
[1:10:15] that God is

[1:10:22] behind that whatever you need God is a

[1:11:49] Christ amen now can you imagine
[1:11:51] Hallelujah that that that that that that
[1:11:53] that that
[1:11:54] David's own father didn't even believe
[1:11:57] in him
[1:12:02] go back and read your Bible
[1:12:05] which when when Samuel came to the house
[1:12:08] Samuel came Hallelujah with a message
[1:12:11] from God
[1:12:12] Samuel came Hallelujah with orders from
[1:12:15] God he said go down to Jesse's house
[1:12:18] because the next king is there Samuel
[1:12:21] came to Jesse's house with the anointing
[1:12:24] Hallelujah and Jesse Jesse didn't even
[1:12:28] believe in David he called all his other
[1:12:30] sons while David was out there with the
[1:12:32] Sheep but let me tell you something amen
[1:12:34] your parents your cousins your brother
[1:12:37] your sister may not know who you are but
[1:12:40] God knows who you are
[1:12:45] God knows who you are
[1:12:51] you are not forgotten Hallelujah in
[1:12:56] church he called all of his boys and
[1:12:59] Samuel pull the horn out and the horn
[1:13:01] wouldn't even move
[1:13:03] the anointing wouldn't even lose
[1:13:05] Hallelujah and then Samuel holy had to
[1:13:08] say to Jesse this boy is rejected go get
[1:13:11] another one this boy is rejected this
[1:13:14] boy is rejected this voice rejected and
[1:13:16] then God said okay Samuel that's what I
[1:13:19] want you to do I want to give you an
[1:13:20] experience don't look at his statue
[1:13:25] thank you
[1:13:29] the power of God is not worried about
[1:13:33] how big you are
[1:13:34] [Applause]
[1:13:35] the power of God is not worried about
[1:13:37] your skin color the power of God is not
[1:13:40] worried about your size or your weight
[1:13:42] totally the power of God is resting on
[1:13:45] how much you can believe
[1:13:48] [Applause]
[1:13:55] so he calls and he calls and he calls
[1:13:57] Hallelujah and then he says Samuel says
[1:14:00] hey he says Hey God told me to come here
[1:14:05] God put this together
[1:14:07] God told me to come here hallelujah and
[1:14:10] he said to him you got to have another
[1:14:13] son
[1:14:14] because God told me to come in and God
[1:14:17] doesn't miss and sir and Jesse Jesse
[1:14:20] says oh yeah I got one more and then

[1:14:43] field and bring you into the house
[1:14:50] God is bringing you from out of the
[1:14:52] world from out of the field and he has
[1:14:55] the anointing waiting on you
[1:14:58] Hallelujah
[1:15:00] and Jesse couldn't believe it David
[1:15:03] comes in one thing about meeting God you
[1:15:07] may not be ready but God is
[1:15:10] [Applause]
[1:15:11] Hallelujah little church all the other
[1:15:14] brothers had a chance to take a shower
[1:15:17] wash up put their good clothes on David
[1:15:20] came fresh out in the field
[1:15:22] [Applause]
[1:15:23] Hallelujah
[1:15:26] I went to a service One Night in my
[1:15:30] heart just wasn't right
[1:15:34] Something's Gotta hold of me
[1:15:38] [Applause]
[1:15:42] think about it you just came to church
[1:15:44] last night not knowing earlier but God
[1:15:48] had the anointing waiting on you
[1:15:52] it was your time it was your day it was
[1:15:57] your moment and God was going to give
[1:15:59] you an experience that you leave
[1:16:01] Burlington with that'll change your life
[1:16:03] forever
[1:16:08] Hallelujah and you look Church David
[1:16:11] comes Hallelujah smell it like sheep
[1:16:15] College sweaty
[1:16:16] cold stinking but that didn't stop the
[1:16:19] anointing
[1:16:23] some of some of you came in Hallelujah
[1:16:25] with the smell of the world on you
[1:16:29] with the habits of the world on you
[1:16:31] thinking and seeing Hallelujah but that
[1:16:35] didn't stop the anointing from getting a
[1:16:37] hold of you that didn't stop the
[1:16:39] anointing from touching your life why
[1:16:42] because God had a purpose for you
[1:16:45] he had something he wanted you to
[1:16:48] experience Hallelujah and now David what
[1:16:51] I love about David Hallelujah David came
[1:16:53] in Hallelujah just because his father
[1:16:55] called him amen and this is real
[1:16:58] humility Man David didn't come in and
[1:17:00] said ah
[1:17:04] y'all thought I was left out but yeah he
[1:17:07] is
[1:17:11] David didn't come in all arrogantly
[1:17:13] Hallelujah because he got a gift of
[1:17:16] worship because he got a gift to sing or
[1:17:20] a gift to play instruments Hallelujah
[1:17:22] David came in with all humility
[1:17:24] walked in probably with his head down
[1:17:27] and Samuel said come here son Hallelujah
[1:17:30] and once Hallelujah he stood in place
[1:17:33] once he got in position Hallelujah God
[1:17:37] couldn't help
[1:17:39] God couldn't resist it
[1:17:42] God couldn't hold back no longer
[1:17:46] and was David got in position the
[1:17:49] anointing started to move
[1:17:53] it's starting to move
[1:17:57] Samuel Samuel said here it is
[1:18:00] here it is
[1:18:02] [Applause]
[1:18:05] [Music]
[1:18:06] and he started to pull the anointing
[1:18:09] I was saying last night I can't help but
[1:18:13] let it flow over you because you're in
[1:18:16] position
[1:18:18] once you get in position God has to do
[1:18:21] his part
[1:18:22] and you can imagine the brothers
[1:18:24] probably were sitting there like
[1:18:28] David
[1:18:31] has the anointing of prophets
[1:18:35] David
[1:18:36] has the anointing that comes from the
[1:18:39] prophet so David has the saith the Lord
[1:18:44] [Applause]
[1:18:46] we have the stand the love
[1:18:53] Church
[1:18:54] God was giving him an experience
[1:18:57] right there in front of his whole house
[1:18:59] but David wasn't arrogant amen once the
[1:19:02] anointing fail Hallelujah David probably
[1:19:05] didn't kick he probably didn't jump he
[1:19:08] probably didn't shout David was like
[1:19:10] thank you Lord we're back out to the
[1:19:12] field
[1:19:14] went back out to the Sheep now all of
[1:19:16] his brothers saw the anointing and what
[1:19:19] they didn't realize Hallelujah with that
[1:19:22] anointing God is preparing him for the
[1:19:25] battle to come the greater battle
[1:19:27] so why nobody else can see it God is
[1:19:30] developing a testimony in David's life
[1:19:34] Hallelujah a testimony by experience so
[1:19:38] what is experience holy
[1:19:40] let's look at experience
[1:19:43] you know you take the word doctor
[1:19:47] there's all kinds of doctors
[1:19:50] you take a dentist he's considered to be
[1:19:53] a doctor
[1:19:54] you take a heart surgeon he's considered
[1:19:57] to be a doctor amen you take a a
[1:20:00] preacher Holier who studied holy
[1:20:03] Theology and they also call him a what
[1:20:10] so you can have three men come in the
[1:20:12] room with the same title as Doctor
[1:20:15] but what separates them their experience
[1:20:19] Hollywood
[1:20:20] Hallelujah and you can only operate
[1:20:23] according to your experience no matter
[1:20:26] what your title is
[1:20:28] Hallelujah you can only be what you
[1:20:31] experience allows you to be let's just
[1:20:34] say Amen the dentist comes in one day
[1:20:37] and and the surgeon is there and the
[1:20:40] surgeon says to the dentist I am a
[1:20:42] doctor like you
[1:20:44] he said you know what I think I want to
[1:20:46] pull a tooth today
[1:20:48] cause I'm a doctor
[1:20:50] show me your instruments they might even
[1:20:52] have some of the same instruments and he
[1:20:55] can look at a scaffold and say that's a
[1:20:56] Skyfall and I said this you use this to
[1:20:58] cut with you use that in the pool with
[1:21:00] Hallelujah and he'll say okay well I
[1:21:03] think I'm ready to operate and the
[1:21:05] dentist will tell him oh no
[1:21:08] you don't have the experience
[1:21:11] Oh no you're a doctor you can't do what
[1:21:14] I do
[1:21:14] [Applause]
[1:21:19] you say you believe in Christ as a
[1:21:22] Baptist but you don't have the
[1:21:23] experience I have
[1:21:25] you say you believe in Christ as a
[1:21:27] Catholic but you don't have the
[1:21:29] experience I have
[1:21:31] Hallelujah
[1:21:34] so you know what that that the surgeon
[1:21:36] has to do that surgeon has to sit back
[1:21:39] and let the one with the experience
[1:21:41] Hallelujah go to work
[1:21:45] and you know what there are a lot of men
[1:21:47] who may have more Revelation to me but
[1:21:50] What Separates Me from them my
[1:21:52] experience
[1:21:53] [Applause]
[1:21:55] Hallelujah but you might say well
[1:21:57] brother I think I want to be the pastor
[1:21:59] in the church the only way you can be
[1:22:01] that is if God puts you in line to have
[1:22:04] the experience of a pastor
[1:22:06] Hallelujah knowledge is not it
[1:22:09] Hallelujah just you saying I got
[1:22:12] Revelation Revelation is the part of
[1:22:14] Faith he said faith is a revelation but
[1:22:17] what good is your faith with no
[1:22:18] experience
[1:22:21] Hallelujah and let's switch it around
[1:22:25] let's just say the pharmacist
[1:22:27] the pharmacist
[1:22:29] goes to the surgeon
[1:22:32] he says you know what
[1:22:33] a lot of times you guys you come
[1:22:35] Hallelujah
[1:22:36] and you send patience to me after you've
[1:22:40] operated
[1:22:41] and they have certain medicines and
[1:22:43] different things you know and I have to
[1:22:45] feel the prescription because of your
[1:22:47] operation
[1:22:48] and you know what the the pharmacist
[1:22:50] because he's a doctor he might say to
[1:22:53] the surgeon hey let's just cut to the
[1:22:55] chase I already know what they need so
[1:22:58] let me operate
[1:23:03] and you know what the surgeon will say
[1:23:04] the surgeon will say to him no your job
[1:23:09] is after our operation
[1:23:13] Hallelujah your job is not to operate
[1:23:16] your job is to comfort after I operate
[1:23:20] Hallelujah and one place in the message
[1:23:23] there was a person saying brother
[1:23:25] Branham I've been faster than praying
[1:23:27] and I just can't cast out this demon and
[1:23:29] he said sister you're supposed to fast
[1:23:32] and pray somebody else will cast out the
[1:23:34] deal Hallelujah see we operate by our
[1:23:39] experiences
[1:23:41] Hallelujah so you know you take all
[1:23:44] three of those men all of them got
[1:23:46] doctor on their name but they're all
[1:23:48] separated by the experiences in church
[1:23:51] I'll be one to say I know God Is A
[1:23:54] Healer why because I've had the
[1:23:56] experience
[1:24:00] I've had the experience
[1:24:02] yeah you know about cancer but that same
[1:24:04] experience carries me to the next battle
[1:24:07] Hallelujah I walked in the doctor's
[1:24:10] office because I had to renew my renew
[1:24:13] my license and I have a commercial
[1:24:15] driver's license
[1:24:17] which I'm not driving commercial but I
[1:24:19] keep the license if God gives you
[1:24:21] anything you keep it
[1:24:24] don't give nothing back to the devil you
[1:24:26] keep it
[1:24:27] unless God tell you to give it up you
[1:24:30] keep it whatever God gives you you keep
[1:24:33] it
[1:24:35] Hallelujah and I ain't drove a tractor
[1:24:38] in years but I still got an experience
[1:24:41] Hallelujah and I got the license to tell
[1:24:44] you that my license is better than yours
[1:24:47] Hallelujah they say well you I'm one of
[1:24:51] those people that could watch somebody
[1:24:52] driving and say they can't drive
[1:24:55] Hallelujah I can say that by experience
[1:24:59] cause my license says commercial
[1:25:01] driver's license professional truck
[1:25:04] driver my license don't cost fifty
[1:25:07] dollars it costs three thousand
[1:25:08] [Applause]
[1:25:09] [Music]
[1:25:15] but this what are you saying you don't
[1:25:17] know the cost of somebody else's
[1:25:20] experience
[1:25:21] you don't know what they went through to
[1:25:25] get where they are
[1:25:27] you don't know how much they labor you
[1:25:31] don't know how much they sacrifice you
[1:25:34] don't know what it costs
[1:25:36] [Applause]
[1:25:40] Hallelujah
[1:25:42] you don't know what somebody else went
[1:25:44] through just to get here
[1:25:48] but what it does it develops an
[1:25:50] experience
[1:25:51] so church I went in the doctor's office
[1:25:54] and you know when they they begin yeah
[1:25:56] and normally when I go I'll be preparing
[1:25:58] myself for a fight
[1:26:00] cause I'm a Child of God
[1:26:03] then the enemies don't want me to to
[1:26:05] walk out of any place Happy
[1:26:07] so what he does is he always plotting on
[1:26:10] me Hallelujah brother Michael to get me
[1:26:13] out of character so I can launch out and
[1:26:15] then I can't see the supernatural
[1:26:17] so you know what I go in I go in and the
[1:26:21] lady the nurse she says to me
[1:26:24] she says we need a urine sample I say
[1:26:26] okay
[1:26:27] so I get in the U.S Temple
[1:26:29] she comes back and she says oh my God
[1:26:32] oh my God you got so much glucose
[1:26:39] now me personally
[1:26:41] I believe God keeps you from certain
[1:26:43] veins
[1:26:44] he doesn't give you the knowledge of
[1:26:47] certain things so when it's spoken it
[1:26:49] doesn't bother you at all
[1:26:51] Holly is not a part of your experience
[1:26:54] amen see we can we can we right now
[1:26:57] Church Hallelujah I'll tell before I get
[1:26:59] back to that Hallelujah if I if I go on
[1:27:01] too much with this next testimony
[1:27:02] somebody say Get Back Church Hallelujah
[1:27:05] one time I was out with a brother
[1:27:06] Hallelujah we were sitting in a
[1:27:08] restaurant and rock and roll was playing
[1:27:24] and he says to me but Jesus I'm so sorry
[1:27:26] I'm so sorry for the music
[1:27:29] okay
[1:27:33] I can't beat
[1:27:35] the music kept playing
[1:27:40] [Music]
[1:27:46] he looks at me again
[1:27:50] please I'm so sorry
[1:27:52] brother I'm good
[1:27:57] [Applause]
[1:28:06] wow
[1:28:10] he says Oh Brother Jesus I'm so sorry I
[1:28:13] say look brother this music not
[1:28:15] bothering me is bothering you
[1:28:25] I don't have an experience with rock and
[1:28:29] roll
[1:28:30] so rock and roll don't bother me now if
[1:28:33] it was rap music it would have been
[1:28:34] something different so don't try to give
[1:28:37] me your battle without the experience
[1:28:40] [Applause]
[1:28:42] Hallelujah
[1:28:44] if it was rap and R B that'll be
[1:28:47] something different but I never had an
[1:28:49] experience with rock and roll
[1:28:51] [Applause]
[1:28:52] so I can sit in your car in the good
[1:28:55] Target very very
[1:28:57] all in once I am not tempted
[1:29:00] [Applause]
[1:29:04] because that's not a part of my
[1:29:06] experience
[1:29:10] but you put on some punk
[1:29:12] you put on some biggie then the words
[1:29:14] start to come back up
[1:29:16] you don't have to say brother can you
[1:29:18] change the channel yeah
[1:29:23] I don't want to hit it
[1:29:28] not that I'm afraid of it I've
[1:29:30] experienced already and what I mean by
[1:29:33] experience I've overcome it
[1:29:36] I'm not running from it I'm not afraid
[1:29:39] of it I just have no desire so cut it
[1:29:42] off and put on something that can feed
[1:29:44] my spirit Hallelujah my experience is
[1:29:47] taking over now
[1:29:50] and what we do too often we get saved
[1:29:53] and don't get sanctified
[1:29:55] Hallelujah so we go out in places
[1:29:57] Hallelujah you say God deliver you from
[1:30:00] smoke and you see somebody smoking a
[1:30:02] cigarette you're like oh my God
[1:30:08] he's smoking he's smoking oh my God it's
[1:30:11] coming my way
[1:30:17] let me say something
[1:30:18] if that's you you're not delivered
[1:30:27] because when you get delivered it has no
[1:30:30] more control over
[1:30:32] thank you Jesus
[1:30:35] if God delivers you from smoke holler if
[1:30:38] God deliver you from any kind of thing
[1:30:40] like that somebody can come around you
[1:30:42] who's a chimney
[1:30:47] build some Newports in your face
[1:30:50] if God delivers you from drugs they can
[1:30:52] blow you can be rhymed by smell some
[1:30:54] weed
[1:30:56] and all you say is
[1:30:58] somebody's smoking yeah
[1:31:06] why doesn't it bother you because you've
[1:31:09] had an experience with Deliverance
[1:31:12] once you get an experience
[1:31:15] changes your life
[1:31:19] changes your walk once you get an
[1:31:22] experience
[1:31:23] no I'm not saying go to the club because
[1:31:26] remember when you get an experience you
[1:31:28] have no more desire for
[1:31:30] [Applause]
[1:31:33] Hallelujah because we have to remember I
[1:31:35] want you young people to understand when
[1:31:37] you leave here your old nature is really
[1:31:39] going to fight you
[1:31:41] Hallelujah because it's sticky
[1:31:43] Hallelujah and the prophet of God said
[1:31:45] your old nature is sticky see you begin
[1:31:47] to remember things that you're delivered
[1:31:50] from
[1:31:50] Hallelujah I've told this testimony
[1:31:52] before Hallelujah I was in the
[1:31:54] department store and I had to get some
[1:31:56] more shirts because I was preaching the
[1:31:57] whole week and I went into a Macy's and
[1:32:00] they was playing Prince
[1:32:06] [Applause]
[1:32:14] yeah I know some of y'all too spiritual
[1:32:16] to identify with what I'm saying
[1:32:19] [Applause]
[1:32:21] but if I keep going I get you Elvis
[1:32:27] [Applause]
[1:32:29] if I keep going I'll get you Dolly
[1:32:31] Parton Hallelujah because you were once
[1:32:34] delivered from something too
[1:32:36] but you know what church I was sitting
[1:32:38] there and all the words from that song
[1:32:41] were right in my mouth
[1:32:43] and I'm sitting I'm preaching reality to
[1:32:45] you Church young people I want you to
[1:32:47] understand what's going to take place
[1:32:48] and now I'm sitting there in prisons
[1:32:51] owner on the music in the department
[1:32:53] store and it's playing and I know every
[1:32:55] word I'm going around a certain thing
[1:32:57] got beautiful
[1:33:03] [Applause]
[1:33:11] oh you thought when you got the holy
[1:33:14] ghost that this kind of stuff don't
[1:33:15] happen
[1:33:16] no once you get the Holy Ghost then the
[1:33:19] fight really begins amen
[1:33:23] Hallelujah I never had a problem with
[1:33:26] women wearing pants until I got the Holy
[1:33:29] Ghost amen
[1:33:32] oh you thought I was born like your arms
[1:33:34] you should be Wham won't garments
[1:33:36] pertaining to a man no once I got the
[1:33:38] Holy Ghost then conviction was in my
[1:33:41] eyes
[1:33:42] Hallelujah conviction was in my ears
[1:33:45] Hallelujah see once you get the holy
[1:33:48] spirit is Christ inside Hallelujah and
[1:33:51] only what he desires will come in
[1:33:54] and it wasn't until earlier I truly got
[1:33:56] saved and converted I could see sin and
[1:33:59] no longer have a taste for it Hallelujah
[1:34:02] because most men that are not converted
[1:34:04] they love to see a woman in pants why so
[1:34:07] they can see their shape
[1:34:12] they got women pants just to show your
[1:34:15] shape
[1:34:16] Hallelujah
[1:34:18] and now you have churches and places
[1:34:20] saying well I don't really understand
[1:34:22] what that means garments pertaining to a
[1:34:24] man well I know Holly I I believe ain't
[1:34:28] no brothers in here wearing dresses
[1:34:35] so what's the Garment holy the Garment
[1:34:38] has to be trousers the government has to
[1:34:40] be paying Hallelujah Church don't let
[1:34:43] the enemy bring an uncertain sound to
[1:34:46] the Simplicity of the god
[1:34:47] [Applause]
[1:34:50] Satan is is so crafty now we're in a day
[1:34:54] where they're saying let the child
[1:34:56] choose his own gender
[1:34:58] but your foolishness
[1:35:00] [Applause]
[1:35:05] let the child how how are the
[1:35:08] one-year-old two-year-old baby how are
[1:35:10] you gonna say I don't want to be a boy I
[1:35:13] don't want to be a girl that's a spirit
[1:35:14] of confusion

[1:35:22] somebody struggling with gender identity
[1:35:25] well let me help you out let me help you
[1:35:26] out when you get out of the service you

[1:43:32] of emotion last night well let's make it
[1:43:34] clearly like we said anything without
[1:43:37] emotion is dead
[1:43:39] but what takes it from emotion to a real
[1:43:42] experience whether it was emotional that
[1:43:45] I'll tell you whether what you had was
[1:43:47] emotion if the power of God fell on you
[1:43:50] and you shouted you dance you worship
[1:43:53] you cry you scream hallelujah amen all
[1:43:56] of that in the moment
[1:43:58] if it was a motion to you
[1:44:00] you'll leave here this weekend and go
[1:44:03] back into your filth
[1:44:06] that means you was just emotional
[1:44:09] but if you leave here changed
[1:44:12] you leave here with different desires
[1:44:15] you leave here Desiring a closer walk
[1:44:18] with God
[1:44:19] that was more than just emotion
[1:44:22] that was God making a contact
[1:44:25] that was good Hallelujah touching you
[1:44:27] Hallelujah that was Lord that was God
[1:44:30] bringing life into your being
[1:44:32] that's more than just emotion
[1:44:35] so she comes and she Pricks my finger
[1:44:38] and the little machine goes off I forget
[1:44:40] the name of it but you know what I'm
[1:44:42] talking about the little machine goes
[1:44:43] out hungry
[1:44:46] she looks at it looks at me looks at it
[1:44:49] looks at me and I'm smiling
[1:44:51] [Applause]
[1:44:53] because I know what my God is I know
[1:44:55] what he gonna do
[1:44:58] Hallelujah
[1:44:59] so she looks at me and she says Mr Diggs
[1:45:02] you're right
[1:45:04] you don't have diabetes
[1:45:11] you don't have diabetes
[1:45:15] I said to her I told you
[1:45:18] and now she starts to ask me questions
[1:45:20] like I'm a doctor
[1:45:21] she says well I don't understand how can
[1:45:24] it be positive over here and be negative
[1:45:26] back here I said God wanted me to
[1:45:29] confess the right thing so over here it
[1:45:32] was there it was present but by the time
[1:45:34] it got back here my My Confession
[1:45:36] stopped it in his tracks My Confession
[1:45:39] set the devil down my confession oh
[1:45:45] and you're a confession your profession
[1:45:48] will stop the devil in his tracks your
[1:45:52] confession
[1:45:59] it was a real live demon but my
[1:46:02] confession bound the devil lock the
[1:46:06] devil up kick the devil out
[1:46:09] and your confession will do the same
[1:46:11] thing
[1:46:12] [Applause]
[1:46:14] [Music]
[1:46:18] and you know most doctors they're not
[1:46:19] satisfied
[1:46:21] with being defeated
[1:46:23] so she says to me well
[1:46:25] what did you eat last night
[1:46:29] she's trying to find some kind of
[1:46:31] resolution
[1:46:33] she said what did you eat and y'all know
[1:46:35] me I said I had some sweet tea
[1:46:39] and chocolate chip cookies
[1:46:43] and then she confesses to me brother
[1:46:44] Danny a doctor she confesses to me she
[1:46:47] says oh yeah
[1:46:49] normally when you eat things like that
[1:46:51] it shows up in your system
[1:46:56] I say okay
[1:46:58] I said okay
[1:46:59] hmm
[1:47:00] and then God began to show me something
[1:47:03] he'll begin to show me so I said okay
[1:47:04] now you're acknowledging that what you
[1:47:07] see in my body is the results of what
[1:47:10] kind of food I ate
[1:47:12] which is Gold Peak sweet tea
[1:47:15] and Chip Ahoy chocolate chip cookies
[1:47:18] so if that's what you saw chocolate chip
[1:47:21] and sweet tea why did you change the
[1:47:23] name of diabetes
[1:47:25] [Applause]
[1:47:29] call it what it is
[1:47:31] don't change his name to try to make me
[1:47:34] afraid call it what it is why didn't you
[1:47:36] say to me I see tea and cookies in your
[1:47:39] system but what the devil does he
[1:47:42] changed the name to try to get you
[1:47:44] fearful then you accept the spirit and
[1:47:47] now you have diabetes
[1:47:52] and it's simply something you ate
[1:47:57] [Applause]
[1:48:00] and I know some of y'all listen to me
[1:48:02] like
[1:48:03] that's all right
[1:48:05] but I gotta take this shot
[1:48:09] that's all right my levels are low get
[1:48:12] me some candy
[1:48:14] listen
[1:48:15] the prophet of God says my alarm going
[1:48:16] off I got to quit
[1:48:22] listen the prophet of God said
[1:48:25] he said
[1:48:27] before it becomes a spirit
[1:48:30] you have to accept it as a thought first
[1:48:35] so before anything manifestes in your
[1:48:37] life you have to receive the thought
[1:48:40] first that's why if you get up and you
[1:48:42] say man I feel like I'm coming down with
[1:48:45] the flu
[1:48:47] yes you are
[1:48:50] because you spoke it over yourself
[1:48:52] and now you've opened that door
[1:48:54] Hallelujah for that Spirit to manifest
[1:48:57] itself in your body Hallelujah but what
[1:48:59] if you get up and you say by your
[1:49:01] stripes I'm Healed
[1:49:02] [Applause]
[1:49:03] you allow the power of God hallelujah to
[1:49:07] move in your body hallelujah it's just
[1:49:09] that simple church it's an experience
[1:49:12] with God faith by experience Hallelujah
[1:49:15] but I'm gonna finish up with David and
[1:49:17] we're gonna get on out the way
[1:49:18] Hallelujah but you know Church David
[1:49:21] being called of God what separated now
[1:49:24] David Hallelujah was already King
[1:49:28] amen he was already the king
[1:49:30] already anointed
[1:49:32] amen hallelujah but God had him in
[1:49:35] trained yes
[1:49:36] God had him in training to do something
[1:49:38] that nobody else would do nobody has had
[1:49:42] the courage to do and when they when
[1:49:44] David heard things he heard it different
[1:49:46] from having everybody else heard and
[1:49:49] that's who we are when we hear the
[1:49:51] teachings of a prophet we hear something
[1:49:53] different from everybody else
[1:49:55] Hallelujah and you know Church David
[1:49:58] Hallelujah his father said hey David I
[1:50:01] want you the king to go give your
[1:50:04] brother something to eat
[1:50:07] should have been the other way around
[1:50:08] right
[1:50:09] but David just being in humility what
[1:50:11] was David doing David was waiting to his
[1:50:14] time
[1:50:15] he didn't try to force anything
[1:50:17] Hallelujah David just waited till his
[1:50:20] time came and I'll say to you young
[1:50:22] people don't try to do nothing special
[1:50:24] just continue to live an honest life
[1:50:27] and whatever God has for you he will
[1:50:30] open that door you say well Brothers I
[1:50:33] feel like I feel like I got a calling in
[1:50:35] my life wait on it
[1:50:36] don't try to make anything happen wait
[1:50:39] on it because if God do it that door
[1:50:41] will open up Hallelujah you don't have
[1:50:44] to force yourself into anything amen she
[1:50:47] is faked by experience and now David
[1:50:49] Hallelujah he's going to give his
[1:50:52] brothers maybe he has some Chipotle that
[1:50:54] day
[1:50:57] he has some Nando's
[1:51:01] you know that Nando's good
[1:51:05] Nando's Fit For A King holy and David
[1:51:08] come down and he come to see his
[1:51:10] brothers all his brothers everybody out
[1:51:12] there the army of his Israel over there
[1:51:14] you got the army of the Philistines out
[1:51:16] there and David is clueless to what's
[1:51:18] going on
[1:51:19] David walks into a war
[1:51:23] but I want you to catch something what
[1:51:25] was God doing God was sending the
[1:51:28] anointing
[1:51:32] and David comes down Hallelujah and
[1:51:35] Goliath for 40 days 40 nights streaming
[1:51:39] bring me a man
[1:51:41] bring me a man and when you leave these
[1:51:45] Services you're going to hear the devil
[1:51:47] louder than ever
[1:51:48] but I want you to know Hallelujah real
[1:51:51] Revival is recognizing your enemy and
[1:51:54] your God
[1:51:57] that's real Revival no we're not going
[1:51:59] to ignore the devil we're just going to
[1:52:01] put him in his place
[1:52:03] Hallelujah you got no business I want
[1:52:06] you to understand this the Bible
[1:52:07] according to scripture Satan has no
[1:52:10] right in your ear that's too high
[1:52:14] that's too hot
[1:52:16] Satan has no right in your face that's
[1:52:19] too high the Bible says Satan belongs
[1:52:23] under your feet
[1:52:24] [Applause]
[1:52:31] he got no right speaking of your head he
[1:52:34] got no right looking in your face he
[1:52:37] belongs under your feet
[1:52:41] so now David comes out everybody all
[1:52:43] right
[1:52:44] David comes out Hallelujah and he has
[1:52:47] the food Hallelujah to feed his brothers
[1:52:49] and he's just doing what his father asks
[1:52:51] him just be obedient
[1:52:53] do what your father asks you and David
[1:52:56] comes with the food and he gives it to
[1:52:58] his brothers and then he hears something
[1:53:00] that's been going on for 40 days he
[1:53:03] comes with the fool and as he's
[1:53:05] delivering the food he hears something
[1:53:06] say bring me a man
[1:53:10] in Davidson
[1:53:20] who is this uncircumfized
[1:53:23] who is this
[1:53:25] and the brothers of Life man you just
[1:53:27] come here to be naughty you just come to
[1:53:29] see the battle and David's like what
[1:53:31] battle are y'all scared
[1:53:36] what battle ain't nobody fighting is
[1:53:38] there another cause
[1:53:41] and then David one thing I want and I'm
[1:53:43] gonna cut this I'm gonna do this real
[1:53:45] quick one thing I want you to realize
[1:53:46] about David his experience was he kept
[1:53:50] asking questions right until he got in
[1:53:52] front of Goliath
[1:53:55] David say what's the reward David said
[1:53:58] who gonna fight David asked question
[1:54:00] after question and he didn't stop until
[1:54:02] he got in front of Goliath Hallelujah
[1:54:05] but one thing I want you to realize he
[1:54:07] came Hallelujah with a testimony
[1:54:11] Hallelujah that's what he was meeting
[1:54:13] Goliath with a testimony
[1:54:16] so he comes out Hallelujah and he says
[1:54:19] what will King Saul do Hallelujah for
[1:54:22] anybody that fights and defeats this
[1:54:25] giant Hallelujah and they said something
[1:54:27] to the fact he'll get his daughter and
[1:54:29] all this stuff David like I don't care
[1:54:30] about none of that
[1:54:32] this man is defying the armies of the
[1:54:34] Living God Amen
[1:54:36] and then the scripture says and Saul
[1:54:38] heard
[1:54:40] of what David was saying it got back to
[1:54:43] the king now I want you to catch
[1:54:45] something Hallelujah David and Saul
[1:54:48] Julia were anointed by the same
[1:54:51] messenger amen
[1:55:00] amen Saul was anointed by by Samuel
[1:55:03] and David was anointed by Samuel
[1:55:05] remember the prophet of God said it can
[1:55:08] be a true anointing and a false vessel
[1:55:10] Hallelujah so it was a true anointing on
[1:55:13] Saul Saul prophesied he did all the
[1:55:16] things that that anointing would do the
[1:55:18] difference between Saul and David was
[1:55:20] Saul couldn't obey
[1:55:25] and that's what will separate you young
[1:55:28] people from regular young people going
[1:55:30] to church you hear the word of God and
[1:55:33] there's something inside of you that
[1:55:34] will obey my experience
[1:55:36] Hallelujah you just say Lord be it unto
[1:55:40] me according to your word
[1:55:43] Hallelujah and that's what David did
[1:55:45] Hallelujah David Hallelujah was anointed
[1:55:48] by the same message Saul was
[1:55:52] but what happened was Saul couldn't
[1:55:55] self-reflect and David could

[1:56:36] get sold true he's disobeyed me
[1:56:39] he didn't listen to my word
[1:56:41] and then Samuel comes down and he says
[1:56:44] hey I thought God told you to destroy
[1:56:47] everything he says I did
[1:56:49] see he couldn't self-reflect
[1:56:52] he said he said I did he said he said he
[1:56:54] said but I wanted to do this and

[1:57:24] instructions to destroy your amplicity
[1:57:27] don't hold back
[1:57:33] and Samuel says what is the bleeding of
[1:57:36] the sheep and then Saul couldn't reflect
[1:57:38] he says it was the people
[1:57:44] and how often do we blame
[1:57:47] what we've done on somebody else
[1:57:50] be careful of those friends

[1:58:14] because they can't self-reflect
[1:58:16] Hallelujah they want to put it all on
[1:58:18] somebody and I was Saul did and then
[1:58:20] Samuel says hallelujah just as you a gag
[1:58:23] has left mother's childless so will be
[1:58:26] your mother
[1:58:29] God got people in the church that will

[1:58:47] Hallelujah in our church David
[1:58:49] Hallelujah David comes Hallelujah his
[1:58:53] time of self-reflection when he took
[1:58:55] bathshebra took another man's wife
[1:58:57] Hallelujah not only did he take him he
[1:59:00] killed the man premeditated murder and
[1:59:02] David didn't even realize he was under
[1:59:04] that spirit
[1:59:05] until he heard the words of a prophet
[1:59:12] some of us didn't even realize that we
[1:59:15] were Wayward until we heard the words of
[1:59:18] a prophet
[1:59:19] and that Prophet start to put everything
[1:59:21] in order
[1:59:22] amen and once David said look at David
[1:59:24] he said David there was a man who had
[1:59:25] one sheep and there was another man who
[1:59:27] had plenty sheep and he took that man's
[1:59:28] one sheep David said I'm gonna kill him
[1:59:33] I'm gonna kill him I'm gonna destroy him
[1:59:38] and the prophet said Nathan said David
[1:59:41] you're that me amen
[1:59:43] amen so you know how David felt yes
[1:59:45] David said I'm gonna kill him what he
[1:59:47] was saying is
[1:59:49] I want to kill myself
[1:59:54] the reflection of what was done
[1:59:56] Hallelujah he was saying I need to die
[1:59:59] I need to die in God I ain't quite there
[2:00:02] yet I need to die but then David didn't
[2:00:05] make excuses David said to him I have
[2:00:08] sinned he didn't say it was the people
[2:00:10] he didn't say what best people know she
[2:00:12] come out there every day taking a bath
[2:00:14] and she know I'm sitting out there
[2:00:16] relaxing no he said Lord I have sinned
[2:00:19] he could self-reflect and God said David
[2:00:22] your sins will not be imputed because
[2:00:25] you have confessed your sins honey I'm
[2:00:28] Gonna Give You Mercy
[2:00:31] Hallelujah
[2:00:32] if you make your confession God will
[2:00:35] give you Mercy
[2:00:39] God gave David Mercy
[2:00:42] and David
[2:00:44] he comes to Goliath
[2:00:46] oh my
[2:00:48] give me about 10 more minutes
[2:00:50] David
[2:00:51] he comes to the battle now he's filing
[2:00:53] and be aware let me tell the adults
[2:00:55] don't try to steal these young people's
[2:00:57] fire
[2:00:59] why they keep saying all these new songs
[2:01:01] let's get back into the hymn book
[2:01:06] we need the same message songs
[2:01:11] what is a message song
[2:01:13] I thought anything that exalts Jesus
[2:01:16] Christ amen
[2:01:19] is worthy of giving him praise
[2:01:25] we have to realize that we're all built
[2:01:27] different
[2:01:29] and I don't want them to say it but I
[2:01:31] said holy the way I'm built earlier
[2:01:34] singing about a rainbow trout and a
[2:01:36] silver tip band and all that went down
[2:01:39] to the river and he shot the gun and oh
[2:01:43] that don't do nothing for me
[2:01:45] [Applause]
[2:01:47] I'm just being honest that don't do
[2:01:50] nothing you can sing about the rainbow
[2:01:51] trout and all that don't do nothing for
[2:01:53] me Hallelujah but if you give me some
[2:01:55] Hallelujah How great is our God
[2:02:01] sing with me is
[2:02:04] [Music]
[2:02:12] [Applause]
[2:02:13] is our God
[2:02:17] and that song is a stem off of the
[2:02:20] original How great is our God Hallelujah
[2:02:23] How Great Is Our God
[2:02:27] how great is his word
[2:02:31] he's the greatest one
[2:02:35] [Music]
[2:02:49] [Music]
[2:02:53] see we know the songs don't fight
[2:02:56] against us just let us go with what God
[2:02:59] has given us hallelujah you know it's
[2:03:01] too often that the adults Hallelujah are
[2:03:04] so separated from what God is doing with
[2:03:06] you no don't fight them fight along with
[2:03:09] them hallelujah what we do say nah
[2:03:12] brother Branham gave us a song that we
[2:03:14] shouldn't be singing all the circle of
[2:03:16] people they lies this and that I ain't
[2:03:18] worried about their lives
[2:03:19] what about my life
[2:03:23] see what are we doing the experience is
[2:03:26] to catch the inspiration behind us
[2:03:29] and the Holy Ghost does that Hallelujah
[2:03:32] if it's a song that make you wanna
[2:03:40] no we ain't singing that in church
[2:03:43] because the inspiration room
[2:03:45] the inspiration is to make you move your
[2:03:48] hips the inspiration is to make you dip
[2:03:52] see that's the wrong inspiration but the
[2:03:54] song earlier make you raise your hands
[2:04:03] you're the song make you give thanks
[2:04:08] who cares about the life of the
[2:04:10] songwriter

[2:04:16] if the inspiration is right
[2:04:19] you say my brother Brandon gave us and
[2:04:20] you know what you know what we've seen
[2:04:22] songs that the prophet approved of that

[2:15:35] a battle of of God in the Philistines of

[2:15:52] everywhere a giant rolls his head God

[2:16:02] good neighbor
[2:16:04] I want you to get ready
[2:16:06] God has raised up some new believers
[2:16:10] and they got their demons
[2:16:13] and every other Church represented you
[2:16:15] young people when you go back home
[2:16:16] realize you are a giant killer too
[2:16:26] church I got Nicole's but think about it
[2:16:31] just the illustrations of some of
[2:16:32] David's Mighty Men those who also had an
[2:16:35] experience of Faith there was one man
[2:16:38] Hallelujah who jumped down in the pit on
[2:16:41] a snowy day and kill a lion just because
[2:16:43] the lion say it wrong
[2:16:51] there was another man Hallelujah who
[2:16:53] killed so many other Philistines that
[2:16:55] when he finished his hand was throbbing
[2:17:00] he's with David's Mighty Men
[2:17:03] Hallelujah and a I was the chief
[2:17:05] Hallelujah
[2:17:07] so don't think you all by yourself
[2:17:09] there's somebody in here with the same
[2:17:12] anointing you got
[2:17:18] the same anointing you see being
[2:17:20] preached is the same anointing falling
[2:17:22] on you
[2:17:27] because remember
[2:17:29] there's only one God one Church
[2:17:32] there's a difference of administrations
[2:17:34] but by the same spirit amen Hallelujah
[2:17:38] a little church right when I close
[2:17:41] come on musicians I'm closing listen one
[2:17:45] day David desires some water from
[2:17:48] Bethlehem
[2:17:50] Davis just started talking about it man
[2:17:53] I sure would like to have some of that
[2:17:54] good old well water
[2:17:56] this ain't no Fuji this ain't no no
[2:17:59] alkaline you know this is Bethlehem
[2:18:01] water the real deal minerals in it
[2:18:06] not none of the stuff they're making
[2:18:07] money for Hallelujah but those Mighty
[2:18:10] Men
[2:18:11] just heard David's request
[2:18:14] David didn't even say go get it David
[2:18:17] just had a desire
[2:18:19] and those Mighty Men Hallelujah remember
[2:18:21] they were young men just like David
[2:18:24] with the same anointing Hallelujah in
[2:18:27] church Hallelujah they said David want
[2:18:29] water let's go get it
[2:18:31] now I want you to realize the Bible says
[2:18:33] there was a Gareth sense of Philistines
[2:18:35] Hallelujah on the way Hallelujah
[2:18:38] to Bethlehem and they went out there and
[2:18:42] they started to fight
[2:18:42] [Laughter]
[2:18:48] three of them
[2:18:50] with the brother of God said that wasn't
[2:18:53] the easy Journey
[2:18:55] it looks like they they may have went a
[2:18:58] couple blocks
[2:18:59] the prophet said they fought 15 miles of
[2:19:03] demons
[2:19:10] 15 miles
[2:19:13] and you know how they you know how they
[2:19:14] fought
[2:19:18] that's how they fall
[2:19:20] Hallelujah they had each other's back
[2:19:23] honey they had to worry about who was
[2:19:25] behind him they had a brother behind
[2:19:28] them they had a sister behind him they
[2:19:31] wasn't worried about who was speaking up
[2:19:34] holy now this is the question
[2:19:37] are you your brother's keeper
[2:19:42] and once they finish fighting all those
[2:19:44] demons Hallelujah they came back with
[2:19:46] the water they said David we just heard
[2:19:48] your request and they gave David the
[2:19:50] water David said I can't drink this I
[2:19:52] got to pull this out into the Lord
[2:19:55] so there's sacrifice Hallelujah that
[2:19:58] they was giving unto David really they
[2:20:00] was giving it unto the Lord
[2:20:02] so you may look at it well I'm gonna be
[2:20:04] faithful to Pastor Simon or Pastor Danny
[2:20:07] no you're really being faithful to God
[2:20:10] who or whoever your pastor is once you
[2:20:13] become faithful Hallelujah your service
[2:20:15] is unto God
[2:20:17] Let It Be amen uh experienced by faith
[2:20:22] and don't let the devil steal what's
[2:20:24] taking place in your life
[2:20:26] yeah you may go back home and you may
[2:20:28] find yourself fighting even harder but
[2:20:30] just know you're not by yourself
[2:20:35] reflect back Hallelujah
[2:20:37] reflect back and say I wasn't the only
[2:20:39] one in there crying
[2:20:40] I wasn't the only one in there
[2:20:42] worshiping I wasn't the only one in
[2:20:44] there dancing there's somebody else who
[2:20:46] went through what I went through
[2:20:48] Hallelujah so in those times Hallelujah
[2:20:50] like David Hallelujah as much as he
[2:20:53] fought the Bible said David had to
[2:20:55] encourage himself
[2:21:02] let your testimony in your faith my
[2:21:05] experience
[2:21:06] take you to the next battle
[2:21:12] it ain't your knowledge
[2:21:14] it ain't how good you look
[2:21:16] it's how much you can surrender to God
[2:21:20] and once you realize what God has done
[2:21:22] can you imagine
[2:21:24] battle at the battle
[2:21:26] but before they got to these battles can
[2:21:29] you imagine what David did
[2:21:31] David would probably would come out
[2:21:33] and he would probably say hey
[2:21:35] there's no need for innocent blood to be
[2:21:37] shared
[2:21:38] now he's doing what goliath did
[2:21:42] we don't we you ain't got to fight
[2:21:44] don't worry about it
[2:21:46] we have the true Living God
[2:21:49] and my God is undefeated
[2:21:52] now if you don't want to die ain't no
[2:21:54] need to fight
[2:21:55] but if you want to fight David had a bag
[2:21:58] on his side
[2:22:00] and David went in that bag
[2:22:03] and it was the head of Goliath David
[2:22:05] pulled their head out he said now if you
[2:22:09] want to fight Hallelujah this will be
[2:22:11] your outcome
[2:22:13] can you imagine the fear in the
[2:22:16] Philistines Army when they seen the head
[2:22:18] of their Champion cut off in the hands
[2:22:20] of David
[2:22:25] before we worship
[2:22:28] I want everybody to hold your Goliath up
[2:22:34] the enemy's head has been cut off
[2:22:38] and I don't never want you to doubt how
[2:22:40] God has used you and what God has done
[2:22:42] hallelujah
[2:22:44] Hallelujah the champion Hollywood has
[2:22:46] been fighting you has been defeated
[2:22:49] everything you fight from now on is just
[2:22:52] going to be one of his brothers
[2:22:54] Hallelujah and if you defeated Goliath
[2:22:56] you'll also defeat his brothers somebody
[2:22:59] hold the head up high
[2:23:01] hold up your Victory High
[2:23:03] hold it up real high
[2:23:06] Goliath has been defeated
[2:23:08] by your testimony
[2:23:11] it's your testimony that has defeated
[2:23:14] him does anybody have a testimony
[2:23:17] does anybody have a testimony did God
[2:23:20] touch anybody's life
[2:23:21] now you hold that Victory and you show
[2:23:24] the devil what God has done
[2:23:27] let's pray
[2:23:28] let's pray
[2:23:39] Lord Jesus father is so good
