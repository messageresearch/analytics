Oh, what singing all the city [music and singing] will be when we gather. [singing] Oh, [music] I wash my soul [singing] and [music] all the sh [singing] I will see seventh angel's message. This is the age where where where the mighty angel himself has come down &gt;&gt; who came down in 1963 whom brother Branham under the under the the the ministry under the word that he was the light of that particular day to manifest Revelations 10:7 Seven. It's not the voice OF OF WILLIAM BRANHAM. IT'S NOT THE VOICE OF A PROPHET. IT'S THE VOICE OF GOD. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE VOICE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESUS. &gt;&gt; IT'S ALWAYS BEEN HIS VOICE. &gt;&gt; If you WILL HEAR HIS VOICE, HARDEN NOT YOUR HEARTS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You've got to recognize the day, the season, the hour, the word for your day. Otherwise, you're going to fall under a a another dispensation, and you will not have been birthed into the dispensation of this hour. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. THE PRESENT TRUTH BY THE MESSAGE OF THE hour is what we recognize. Here we read this quote. Now remember, you can put it up there. Number eight, he says, "Now remember that was not Jesus talking to Abraham there that could discern the thoughts in Sarah's mind behind him. That was not Jesus. He had not yet been born. But it was a man in human flesh that Abraham called Elohim, the all the the great Almighty. THAT WAS GOD SHOWING HIMSELF BACK there in in in Melzdc what he was going to be doing right here &gt;&gt; when he when he showed himself to Abraham. Amen. &gt;&gt; And showing and Jesus said, "As it was in the days of Sodom," now watch close. in the days of Sodom. So will it be at the coming of the Son of Man when the Son of Man is being revealed. Not no more as a church. Not no more. He says the bride is called. This is now where the mighty angel comes down to call the bride, to call her name, to bring her out of her amnesia. &gt;&gt; Amen. to recognize in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the head unite the marriage of the bride and so for the last 63 years or so there's been an invisible union that's been taking place and the bride is already united with him &gt;&gt; people want to place it into a future tense EVENT, BUT IT'S ALREADY NOW. IT'S ALREADY HAPPENED. AND YOU KNOW, IF YOU'VE united with the with the groom, &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT UNDER CONFUSION. YOU'RE NOT WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN IN the future. It's already in progress. You're already married. YOU'RE ALREADY SHUT IN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT'S THE FOOLISH VIRGIN that's confused THAT ARE KNOCKING THAT ARE CONSTANTLY KNOCKING. AND WHAT WHAT ARE THEY DOING? THEY'RE THEY'RE KNOCKING IN A PLACE WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO GET ANSWERS. THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY THEY'RE IN THE CONDITION THAT THEY'RE IN, WHY THEY'RE NOT FULLY UH SATISFIED, WHY THEY'RE NOT UH YIELDED, WHY THEY FIND THEMSELVES JUMPING FROM church to church, NOT NOT RECOGNIZING THAT THAT THAT THE THAT THE MIGHTY ANGEL HAS AN order &gt;&gt; for the body to come in and be led by by the five-fold ministry of this hour. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS an order. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. All the previous seven church ages called out bride in every SINGLE AGE. &gt;&gt; BUT THIS IS the age WHERE THE FULL SEVEN course meal is made available. &gt;&gt; The bride now unites with THE GROOM AND SHE BECOMES HIS VOICE. &gt;&gt; She becomes and and and she she gets placed into a place of authority. Too many people are afraid of that. &gt;&gt; NOT WILLING TO TAKE THAT POSITION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. But we need to understand that that the message that came forth under every one of those seven church age dispensations, the messengers that came to each of those ages, they died along with the people that had TO DIE UNDER THOSE AGES. THIS is the only age where the word is brought forth, where the uniting IS TO BRING FORTH A BODY CHANGE, &gt;&gt; it's going to it's going to translate us into the ceremony, &gt;&gt; into the MARRIAGE SUPPER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Praise God. THIS IS WHERE THE MIGHTY ANGEL COMES DOWN in Revelations 10:1-7 and says, "Time shall be no more." Amen. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, we're not DEALING IN TIME ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; YES, BUT WE'RE still in time. Of course, we're still in time. So, what did he mean by that? &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT WHAT DID HE MEAN THAT TIME SHALL BE NO MORE? &gt;&gt; AMEN. WELL, let's see what it says in Ephesians 1:es 9 to11. Next slide. He says, "Having made known unto us." SO, HERE IT IS NOW. He's he's letting us know these are mysteries THAT THAT WERE LOCKED UP IN THE WORD OF GOD. BUT THE OPENING OF THOSE SEALS RELEASED and opened all the mysteries. &gt;&gt; There's no more mysteries. &gt;&gt; The mystery of God is finished. &gt;&gt; It's it's there's nothing else THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE OTHER THAN FOR IT TO MANIFEST. &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S BEEN REVEALED. &gt;&gt; THE MYSTERYY'S been revealed. &gt;&gt; THE MYSTERY OF THE BOOK HAS BEEN OPEN. BUT WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST FOR THIS AGE, UNDER THIS DISPENSATION, YOU CAN'T interpret it. &gt;&gt; Do you know that those that were in the previous ages could not receive this? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Luther could not receive &gt;&gt; this revelation. &gt;&gt; It it would IT WOULD HAVE BLOWN UP ON HIM BECAUSE IT WASN'T the time. BUT THERE'S A PARTICULAR TIME AND season &gt;&gt; for attributes of God that are ordained for that particular time &gt;&gt; to to be able to receive that portion of the word because she GETS AN ANOINTING BY THE HOLY GHOST TO OVERCOME THE AGE OF DECEPTION THAT she's in. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you couldn't even handle it. &gt;&gt; You're ordained to handle it. YOU'RE PREDESTINATED UNTO THIS. HE SAW THAT YOU COULD RECEIVE this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. But look, HE SAYS HERE, HAVING MADE KNOWN UNTO US THE MYSTERY OF HIS WILL, according to his good pleasure, which he had purposed in himself, that in the, now pay attention, that in the dispensation of the fullness of times, this is the age where the fullness of times, in other words, when you look at times, he might gather together. It talks about dispensation of the fullness of times. dispensations. ALL THE DISPENSATIONS, THEY COME into this dispensation. They all fall under this this TIME AND SEASON WHERE TIME SHALL be no more. Where we go from time back to eternity. &gt;&gt; We move from this because listen, the next stage for the church, there's no more church ages. &gt;&gt; There's no more preaching after this. THERE'S NO MORE. LISTEN, THIS IS THE FINAL VOICE TO THE FINAL AGE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOING TO BE NO OTHER WORD WHERE people are going to SAY, "WELL, IF I MISSED IT LAST TIME, MAYBE I CAN CATCH IT THIS TIME." NO, SIR. &gt;&gt; The foolish virgin IS KNOCKING AT THE DOOR, BUT IT'S ALREADY UNITED. SHE'S ALREADY UNITED with the groom. &gt;&gt; She recognizes THAT THE NEXT STAGE IS GOING TO BE A CHANGE. &gt;&gt; SHE REALIZES THAT SHE'S GOING TO HER ETERNAL BODY. THANK YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; SHE REALIZES THAT THE NEXT STAGE IS HER THEOPHONY. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO MORE EARTHLY MINISTRY. TIME SHALL BE no more to the BRIDE OF CHRIST. WHY? BECAUSE FROM here we go to our theophony. WE COME BACK in eternal bodies &gt;&gt; to reign and rule with CHRIST FOR A THOUSAND YEARS. ARE YOU UNDER TIME? &gt;&gt; NO, you're not under time anymore. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. This is where the fullness of time where all THE DISPENSATIONS GET LOCKED up into the bride of Jesus Christ and she moves into her her her her eternal destination who she always was. Amen. Now look, he says that he might that that in the dispensation of the fullness of times plural, he might gather TOGETHER IN ONE ALL things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth, even in him, &gt;&gt; in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after THE COUNSEL OF HIS OWN WILL. WHAT IS THAT INHERITANCE, SAINTS? It's not an earthly inheritance. It's not SOMETHING HERE THAT YES, he's going to bless you. Yes, he's going to give you houses. He's going to give you lands. He's going to provide your needs. But that's not your inheritance. YOUR INHERITANCE IS A THEOPHONY. &gt;&gt; IT'S WHAT YOU'VE BEEN ORDAINED. IT'S WHAT YOU HAD. IT'S WHAT YOU WERE. IT'S WHAT YOU bypassed &gt;&gt; in the beginning. That was the great deception. Amen. Praise God. So, this has been going on SINCE BROTHER BRANDHAM, WHO was the seven earthly angel, son of man, a son of man ministry, revealing the son of man himself. And that's what gets people all confused. That's why even to this day, you got people that worship William Branham. &gt;&gt; They worship brother Brandham like he's God. THEY PRAY TO HIM. THEY HAVE SERVICES where if somebody's going to dedicate a child or get married, they will have brother Brandham officiated through one of his previous messages. They're living under a dispensation WHERE WHERE WHERE THEY'VE ACTUALLY PUT CHRIST OUT OF THE CHURCH. AND HE'S SITTING BACK AND HE'S LOOKING. He's going, "I'm here. &gt;&gt; I'm here. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A son of man revealing the son of man. BUT BECAUSE THEY SAW SO MUCH supernatural in his life, they got distracted by the flash of the supernatural. &gt;&gt; And do you notice that today you don't see a lot of that? You don't see the pillar of fire showing up into the services. You don't see the the the the the pillar of cloud. You don't like I'm not saying it doesn't happen. It may happen in certain places. You don't see the the the the supernatural miracles like like we did when William when brother Brandham was on the earth. There was miracle after miracle and people that witnessed it that are even still alive to this day. They they can't get away from it and they're and they're distracted by it. But that's not the attraction to the bride in this hour. &gt;&gt; SHE'S NEVER BEEN ATTRACTED TO THE MESSENGER. &gt;&gt; She She HEARS THE VOICE OF GOD COMING THROUGH THE MESSENGER under the Listen, I love his voice. I love Brother Brandham's voice. I love listening to the tapes and I do every single day. But I'm hearing the voice of my beloved. THAT'S WHAT'S EXCITING MY SOUL. THAT'S WHAT'S GIVEN ME STRENGTH TO OVERCOME IN this age. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST BY HEARING HIS VOICE. IT'S BY HEARING THE VOICE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Speaks to me in my heart reveals HIMSELF TO ME IN THE SAME WAY he revealed himself to the prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look, it was AN INVISIBLE UNION. BUT LISTEN to brother Brandham here. He's speaking here in in proving his word. He says the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together. The church has to be the word. &gt;&gt; He is the word and the two unites together. AND TO DO THAT it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man. It'll take Christ himself to come personal to each and every one of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not a clergyman. Do you see what I mean? He says, "See, the son of man, Jesus Christ, will come down in human flesh among us and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church and him as one, the bride, and then she'll go to the wedding supper." Amen. &gt;&gt; Next slide. She's already united. &gt;&gt; She's already united. Amen. You see, he says WE GO TO THE WEDDING SUPPER, not the marriage. The marriage has already taken place in the invisible union. &gt;&gt; IT'S SAID AND DONE. WE GATHER here today because we identify with Christ as our groom. Amen. THAT HE'S HE'S OUR HEAD. HE'S OUR he's our our leadership in this day and in this hour. And we KNOW THAT THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH THIS AGE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; No other way will we make it through. Amen. She's already he says of of of flesh and body because the marriage of the lamb has come. But the rapture is going to the wedding supper. When the word here unites with the person and they two become one. Then what does it do then? It manifests the son of man. Again, &gt;&gt; not the church theologians, the son of man. The word and the church becomes one. Wherever the son of whatever the son of man done, he was the word. The church does the same thing. Glory to God. just a that that's just a review from the last time we ministered because it's important to understand the ministry that we're under so that we it becomes more real to us what it is that the word is supposed to produce in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. We don't want to be looking into a future event. We don't want to be looking back. We want to recognize what God is doing right now in our midst. Amen. So let's move along here. In the next slide, we're going to read from St. John chapter 3 verses 26 to uh uh 31. Now pay attention here. And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, HE THAT WAS WITH THEE beyond Jordan, to whom thou beest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him. So here now, the people are telling John, they're going to John. They're saying, "Hey, you know the, you know, Jesus, you know, the one that you uh, you know, pointed out back there at the Jordan, the people are starting to gather around him. Why is it that they're gathering around him and they're kind of not so much around you anymore? Now, pay attention here. John answers and says, "A man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven." &gt;&gt; Ye yourselves bear witness of me that I said, I am not the Christ, but I am sent before him. So here John now the people come to him they say HEY YOU KNOW THEY'RE STARTING TO FOLLOW JESUS THEY'RE NOT FOLLOWING you anymore well that's a good thing John says he says he says and by the way they are following him because something was revealed to them &gt;&gt; there's no way that they could recognize unless it be given to them &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T RECOGNIZE this message you cannot come under the headship of this ministry. I'm not talking about the this good neighbor ministry. I'm talking about the ministry of the word for your day where where where now you have to you you got to bear the reproach for what the word says you're to produce. &gt;&gt; And if your life is not producing some turmoil in your surroundings is because you're you're you're TOO YOU'RE TOO MUCH LIKE the world. Amen. There's a difference when the word comes in this hour. It separates. &gt;&gt; It shows a definite difference by the revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; You you receive THE HOLY GHOST FOR YOUR DAY. You cannot remain the same. Everything around you starts to change. &gt;&gt; The people know that you're different. They know it's a reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So here now John is telling them and and and by the way and he's telling them, "AND I TOLD YOU it wasn't me." See, YOU'RE TELLING ME, YEAH, THAT THEY'RE FOLLOWING JESUS, I TOLD YOU IT WASN'T ME. But listen what he says here. Go to the next scripture, next verse in verse 29. He says, "He that hath the bride is the bridegroom." Hath is a past tense. He already knew his bride. He already knew who would hear his voice. HE ALREADY KNEW WHO THE WISE virgin would be. &gt;&gt; HE ALREADY KNEW THAT THAT OIL WOULD BE IN them because it was we read it. The quote, brother Bram says the Holy Spirit which is himself. &gt;&gt; It's Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoicth greatly because OF THE BRIDEGROOM'S VOICE. THIS MY JOY THEREFORE is fulfilled. So, he was he WAS RECOGNIZING THAT, HEY, I'M SO GRATEFUL &gt;&gt; THAT I WAS ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT GOD OPENED MY EYES TO THE REVELATION OF WHO HE WAS. LISTEN, WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM, WHEN THOSE SEALS GOT RIPPED OPEN AND THE AND THE and the and THE REVELATION OF OF CHRIST, THE MYSTERY WAS UNVEILED, HE WAS REJOICING. HE WAS HE WAS SAYING, "THIS IS A NEW BOOK. IT'S A BRAND NEW BIBLE. EVERYTHING'S BECOME A REALITY TO ME NOW. NOW I KNOW. NOW I SEE WHO HE REALLY IS. AMEN. I listen IF IF THE HOLY SPIRIT IF GOD HAD NOT SENT ONE ANGEL IN every night of the OPENING OF THOSE SEALS, he would have made an error with the mess with those horse riders. &gt;&gt; HE EVEN CALLED THE WHITE HORSE rider in a in a quote. I can't remember where back in 50s sometime where he said it was the HOLY GHOST. BUT AFTER THE OPENING OF THOSE SEALS, HE SAID, "THUS sayeth the Lord." Hallelujah. That white horse rider is that impersonator, the one that's been deceiving the church all along. Amen. And he's still trying to deceive the church and keep her in a bondage. Glory to God. He Now watch John now. Just like brother Brham when John realized the dispensational change that was taking place that his part was to introduce the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; He had to step back and he said it right away while he's saying all of this AND HE'S SAYING I'M REJOICING. I'VE RECOGNIZED HIM. The people that that that are recognizing him. They've heard his voice. They they they were ordained to it. He says, "NOW I GOTTA decrease so that he can increase." &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "I GOTTA DECREASE SO THAT HE CAN INCREASE." THIS IS NOT ABOUT FOLLOWING BROTHER BRANDHAM ANYMORE. LISTEN, WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO FALL IN LISTEN, WE DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH THE WITH THE MESSENGER. WE FALL IN LOVE WITH THE MESSENGER, &gt;&gt; THE THE THE ONE THAT HE BROUGHT. &gt;&gt; CHRIST HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN ELEAZAR. WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT GOING TO GLORIFY ELEAZAR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ELEAZAR WAS TELLING REBECCA ALL ABOUT ISAAC. AND THAT'S WHAT BROTHER BRANDHAM WAS DOING WHEN THIS BOOK BECAME A BRAND NEW BOOK. HE SAYS, "I CALL YOU NO MORE CHURCH. I CALL YOU THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST." &gt;&gt; HIS WIFE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; RECOGNIZING JOHN TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD TO STEP BACK. HE HAD to and and you know listen people are worshiping brother Brham that brother Brandham himself warned THE PEOPLE DON'T DO THAT. IT EVEN GOT HIM TO A PLACE WHERE HE WANTED TO STEP RIGHT OUT OF THE MINISTRY. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS I'D RATHER STEP DOWN THAN ALLOW THE PEOPLE TO to come and make me an antichrist. &gt;&gt; IMAGINE. BUT YET THE PEOPLE are so blinded that their that their eyes are strictly on the signs, the wonders, failing to recognize the angel himself. We see it all typed. Amen. We listen uh we see it all typed in the bridegroom and the bride. It's all about a marriage. But we must be clear that the marriage is between Christ and his bride, not the messenger in the bride. Amen. John the Baptist made it clear that he was not the bridegroom's voice. Amen. He says HE WAS THE VOICE OF THE ONE THAT was to introduce the Messiah, the voice of one crying in the wilderness, make way for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the virgins. Okay, so now we're going to deviate a bit here. We're going to look into the the the the virgins. Okay, the virgins that Jesus is talking about here in the parable, he's not talking about literal virgins where people because there's people that that that that have taken the word of God and there's people that are literally living exactly as the scripture said where they they will not allow themselves to be touched. You've got nuns in the Catholic church, right? It's all a perversion. It's not about virgins in the way that it's written in this into the scripture here. Amen. So talking about sons and it's talking about sons and daughters of God who've been washed by the water of the word. Amen. Being called out from the indoctrinated teachings of this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there's a lot of people now. Now, I'm bringing this out here because listen, there's people that'll hear this message that are still kind of uh, you know, bound into into denomination. And we're looking for the last one. &gt;&gt; Okay? Whether they're in denomination or whether they're in this message, &gt;&gt; because there there's there's some that ARE BOUND IN THIS message &gt;&gt; under the legalism of the teachings that come in the BOUNDARIES OF THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. boundaries of it, not the actual message of the hour. Christ is the message of the hour. So we must be careful of carnal interpretations within the message which causes confusion for many ministers for sisters putting a spirit of law on the people and blinding them from seeing Christ the word. There are teachings in this message that now remember keep your spiritual thinking caps on here. I'm not trying to bring some kind of uh you know uh uh doctrine or teaching on marriage and divorce and this and that. We need to have our spiritual thinking caps on. Okay. But there are teachings in this message that if a minister, for example, has married a woman THAT THAT WAS NOT A VIRGIN, he cannot preach the word of God for this hour. &gt;&gt; There's teachings like that. That's the same lying spirit, &gt;&gt; controlling spirit that's trying to use the word TO JUSTIFY CERTAIN SITUATIONS OR JUSTIFY THEIR POSITION IN THE WORD OF GOD because it makes them feel safe. I'm bringing this here as an example as it pertains to what we're ministering on here this morning. So put on your thinking caps. We're we are talking about understanding the difference between the wise and the foolish virgin. Okay? One has the Holy Ghost. The other one doesn't. The one without the Holy Ghost cannot interpret the word. &gt;&gt; She'll see the word carnally. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember the wise had oil, the Holy Ghost, but the foolish had no oil. The fire that brings light to the word of the hour. The word of the hour. Amen. What is the Holy Ghost? It's Christ in you. It is his identification that he's chosen you personally. HE DIDN'T CHOOSE HE DIDN'T CHOOSE COUPLES. HE DIDN'T CHOOSE CHURCHES. THIS is you and Christ. The bridegroom and the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we need to we need to see that that he's speaking personal. Amen. Hallelujah. What is the Holy Ghost? CHRIST IN YOU. PAUL in the New Testament never wrote anything about New Testament ministers having to marry a virgin. Somebody show me anywhere in the New Testament where Paul said he has to marry a virgin. No, he said he has to be the husband of one wife. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, I'm not bringing this to try and uh you know uh substantiate people's positions here. This is all based on the bridegroom call. So, keep your minds in the right place. Amen. He said, listen, there's nowhere in the New Testament. NOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM DID say in the message marriage and divorce sermon that a priest could not marry a woman that had that had had another husband. But I want to read that quote. Okay, you can put it up. 15. There is no minister that can marry a widow. Did you know that? You want to read it? You want to read that? All right. You get in Leviticus, Leviticus 21 7 and Ezekiel 44:22. AND I'LL SHOW you that the priesthood was not to marry a woman THAT BEEN TOUCHED BY A MAN. This type is of the virgin bride OF JESUS CHRIST BECAUSE they handled the fire of God. The priest did. Aaron's sons. WE HAVEN'T GOT time to read it all and get out by noon. We only got 20 minutes yet. And then it's Aaron's sons that handled the fire of God. So they could not marry a woman that had been touched by another man. It's very clear. PEOPLE TAKE THAT VERY quote and they will use it as the foundation for trying to justify. See that's why they can't be one of the wise virgin. That's why they can't be bride. That's why BECAUSE THEY HAVE FALLEN under this situation here and and so and so so many people and I don't know where they are wherever they are BUT IT'S IT'S BROUGHT CONFUSION. IT'S HURT PEOPLE. IT'S CAUSED DIVISION. It's broken up churches. &gt;&gt; But this IS THE HOUR &gt;&gt; WHERE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST RECEIVES her word FOR HER DAY. HOW IT PERTAINS TO HER AND IT AND IT'S RIGHT FROM THE SCRIPTURES. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT GOING TO BRING ANYTHING THAT'S NOT IN THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. LISTEN, let's read the next slide here. The unchanging God said, so this is from marriage and divorce. They could not marry another woman and a woman being touched by a man showing in type in type. IF YOU WANT TO see it, that the church of the living God is purely unadulterated, THE WORD OF GOD AND NOT A DENOMINATION THAT'S BEEN HANDLED BY MAN. &gt;&gt; EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU &gt;&gt; WAS HANDLED by a man by a by a previous marriage. &gt;&gt; YOU WERE BORN IN ADULTERY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; DON'T BE TRYING TO JUSTIFY ANYTHING. &gt;&gt; Some want TO USE THIS ONE QUOTE FROM BROTHER BRANDHAM AND SAY HE SAID IT. THAT SETTLES IT. But remember, it's important to make sure we have a clear revelation on what he said. AND THAT WHAT HE SAID NEEDS TO RUN TRUE ALL THE WAY FROM GENESIS TO REVELATION. &gt;&gt; The word of God. &gt;&gt; QUOTE, LISTEN. BROTHER BRENNHAM is speaking to a woman who was drawn away. Started listen right here. I'm just going to read a a very quick excerpt here on a woman that had been drawn away and she started hanging out with the wrong people and before she knew it she become a public prostitute. &gt;&gt; Okay. She started living AND SHE TOLD BROTHER BRANDHAM EXACTLY EVERYTHING. She spilled her guts because she had come into contact with something she had never come into contact with before. &gt;&gt; And and and now listen to brother Brandham here. I don't have the quote up there because I just pulled it. He says and it's from 1961 from that time. And I said, "Hear in your heart, you're telling me," he's talking to the woman, "that you'd love to be married and have a husband." I said, "You're a beautiful girl. YOU'D MAKE A REAL SWEETHEART FOR SOME LITTLE TIRED preacher &gt;&gt; of God." &gt;&gt; NOW, HERE'S BROTHER Brandham saying it right here. &gt;&gt; OKAY? YOU WILL NOT FIND ANYWHERE ELSE WHERE BROTHER BRANDHAM ever uh quotes and says that a that a that a man who who who marries who doesn't marry a virgin cannot preach the gospel of Christ. Nowhere. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Now, HE GOES ON. HE SAYS, "I SAID, BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. Your sins MAY BE AS BLACK AS SMUTTY AS HELL." He's talking to the girl. But I KNOW THERE'S A FOUNTAIN FILLED WITH BLOOD DRAWN FROM EMANUEL'S VEINS. &gt;&gt; WHERE SINNERS PLUNGE BENEATH THE FLOOD, LOSE ALL THEIR GUILTY STATES. &gt;&gt; It can MAKE YOU WHITE AS SNOW. SHE SAID, "OH, IT SEEMS LIKE IT COULD BE JUST A MYTH, MR. BRANDOM." SHE SAID, "I WANT TO BE THAT." I SAID, "WILL YOU PRAY WITH ME?" AND SHE SAID, "YES, SIR." WELL, YOU can go back and read the quote from 1962 uh in in uh May 20th from that time and you can read the entire story. She got converted. She was purged. SHE WAS WASHED. SHE WAS CLEAN. AMEN. Glory to God. Amen. So, so the scripture tells us that we need that uh you know that out of the mouth of two or three witnesses, let everything be established. And there's no other quote before or after this marriage and divorce quote where brother Brham said that a minister must marry a virgin. What brother Brham said was absolutely the truth. &gt;&gt; It's from the word of God from Leviticus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen here. THE LEVITICAL PRIESTHOOD ESTABLISHED BY MOSES who made Aaron the first priest. Now, if we were to still be under the Levitical priesthood, naturally speaking, I would not be able to be up here because the scripture says in Leviticus 2:15, they shall NOT MAKE BALDNESS UPON THEIR HEAD. I SHAVED MYSELF THIS MORNING AND I'M SHAVING myself and I'm thinking about this scripture. &gt;&gt; If any of AARON'S SEED HAD any blemish, BLINDNESS, ETC., THEY COULD NOT MINISTER THE WORD. IF THIS IF THIS WAS THE IF THIS WAS THE CASE, PAUL, he had a he had a a problem WITH HIS EYESIGHT. BUT YET, he wrote the whole New Testament. &gt;&gt; Amen. He'd have been disqualified. Brother Brandham said that the priest could NOT MARRY ANY WOMAN that had BEEN TOUCHED BY ANOTHER MAN. SHE had to BE A VIRGIN. PERIOD. AND NOW THIS IS THE ELEMENT. THIS TYPE IS OF THE VIRGIN BRIDE OF JESUS Christ because they handled the fire of God back then when Moses established the Levitical priesthood. &gt;&gt; AND THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. &gt;&gt; IF A WOMAN AND a man HAD BEEN CAUGHT HAVING uh relations before marriage, THEY WOULD BE STONED TO DEATH. &gt;&gt; MY GOD, WE'D HAVE GRAVEYARDS. WE'D BE LOOKING AT GRAVEYARDS INSTEAD OF HOUSES AROUND us &gt;&gt; if that was the case. Listen, go to the next slide. Scripture here, Hebrews 7. We're going to look at this. If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, for under it the people received THE LAW, WHAT further need was there that ANOTHER PRIEST SHOULD RISE UP AFTER THE ORDER OF MELZDC? &gt;&gt; NOW, this is the hour we're living in. &gt;&gt; This pertains to you and me. because we're under that same order. AND NOT BE CALLED AFTER THE ORDER OF AARON, &gt;&gt; SIR. &gt;&gt; FOR THE PRIESTHOOD BEING CHANGED, THERE IS MADE OF NECESSITY A CHANGE ALSO of the law. &gt;&gt; That's why you will never hear Paul preaching and telling you that a man has to marry a virgin in order to take the word of God. that a man has to marry uh cannot marry a woman that's been married to another man. A man cannot even marry a widow. THERE'S TALK CAN'T EVEN MARRY A WIDOW IF IF THAT WIDOW WAS NOT FROM A FROM A FROM A A marriage of a previous priesthood. WHAT ARE THEY DOING? THEY'RE BRINGING BACK THE LAW. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE BRINGING BACK ORGANIZED RELIGION. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; IN ORDER TO BIND THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN FEEL SAFE UNDER THE MINISTRY THAT STAND WITH THE WORD and we we only do what the word says and and and this is you can't you know they want to they want to they THEY WANT TO DISQUALIFY SO MANY PEOPLE. THAT'S NOT the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; No sir. You're going to see what the spirit of God is. For he OF WHOM THESE THINGS are spoken. For listen verse 12. For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law. For he OF WHOM THESE THINGS are spoken pertain to another tribe. &gt;&gt; OH, OF WHICH NO MAN GIVE UTTERANCE at the altar. &gt;&gt; Listen, go to the next uh verse here. Verse 14. For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah, OF WHICH TRIBE MOSES SPOKE nothing concerning him, concerning the priesthood? Didn't talk about the tribe of Judah. Moses never made any any reference to that. It is but AND IT IS YET FAR MORE evident for that after the similitude of Melzdc a man in human flesh. But yet God come to the people come TO SPEAK TO TO Abraham to make a promise TO ABRAHAM THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BRING FORTH A SON and that son IS GOING TO COME THROUGH SARAH. IT'S NOT GOING TO COME THROUGH THE BONDSWOMAN. IT'S NOT GOING TO COME THROUGH UNBELIEF. It's going to come by a word promise. &gt;&gt; And the bride will only believe the word. &gt;&gt; She'll only take the promised word. &gt;&gt; She will NOT TAKE ANOTHER MAN'S INTERPRETATION of the word. &gt;&gt; Never. &gt;&gt; He says, "And that there ariseth." So for that after the similitude of Melzdc there arriveth there there ariseth another priest WHO IS MADE NOT AFTER THE LAW OF A CARNAL COMMANDMENT. &gt;&gt; NO SIR &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR commandments here &gt;&gt; BUT AFTER THE POWER OF AN ENDLESS LIFE. &gt;&gt; That's the eternal word OF GOD THAT GOD HAS TOLD YOU. YOU COME FROM ME. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU ORIGINALLY WERE ME. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T BE LOST. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T BE FOUND IN ADULTERY. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T BE LOST. YOU ARE MINE. YOU ARE in me. IT'S AN ENDLESS LIFE. IT'S ETERNAL. AMEN. HE SAYS, "FOR HE TESTIFITH, THOU ART A PRIEST FOREVER after the order of Mechazdc." Hallelujah. Glory to God. Listen, if you just just a little commentary here on on these scriptures here, he says, listen, the focus on these scriptures was the the the temporary Levitical priesthood to the eternal there was a comparison to the eternal priesthood. That's what the scripture in Hebrews is talking about here. Okay? And it argues that Jesus priesthood IS SUPERIOR BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON THE DIVINE POWER OF HIMSELF that he swore by himself and not by a man's vow which will always fail. A non priestly origin. The author notes it is evident that Jesus DESCENDED FROM THE TRIBE of Judah. He descended from the tribe of Judah. IN THE MOSAIC LAW, THE PRIESTHOOD was strictly reserved for the tribe of Levi. Moses never authorized the tribe of Judah for priestly service. So the power of the messianic king while Judah WAS NOT A PRIESTLY TRIBE, IT WAS THE ROYAL tribe of King David by identifying Jesus with Judah. The author is confirming his kingship WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PROVING HIS PRIESTHOOD MUST OPERATE UNDER A DIFFERENT HIGHER AUTHORITY than that of the Levitical priesthood. &gt;&gt; He overrides it all. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I'm married to the king. &gt;&gt; The final word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Listen here. Let's read the quote here. We're going to we're going to we're going to wind this down now. We're going to read some quotes and and it's from the invisible union of the bride of Christ. And I want you to see yourself. I want you to recognize here that you are not to allow any denominational controlling spirit to come and take control of your life as you walk with Christ. I'm talking about people that are seriously walking with Christ here. I'm not I'm not presenting this as an escapegoat. You know where you stand. You know if you've you know if you're walking with God. You know if you're if you're naked before God. You've you've you've you've divulged everything. You you've allowed him to have his way in your life. He says here in invisible union. He says now it was nature associated with death. Your first husband that had rule over you was your nature by natural birth. So you had a natural husband natural. You love the world because you are the world. You're of this world. YOU YOU YOU came into this world. Okay. Part of the world. That's right. YOUR DESIRES WAS BY NATURE to love the world which you're a part of. You're a part of nature. You believe that? And that's your natural thing. Next slide. That's the reason you have to be born again. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE. YOU HAVE TO DIE TO THAT first husband. That's what we're talking about here. This is the true revelation on THE PRIEST CHRIST AFTER THE ORDER OF MELZDC will only take A VIRGIN BRIDE. YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN. Your old life, YOUR OLD NATURE, YOUR DESIRES FOR THE WORLD, YOUR DESIRES for the doctrines OF MAN, YOUR DESIRES FOR YOUR denomination all have to die &gt;&gt; completely. YOU HAVE TO DIE TO THAT FIRST HUSBAND. You can't live with it. You just you can't say, "Well, I'll divorce him and hang him up here till occasion." No, sir. NO WRITING OF DIVORCEMENT. HE DIES. The nature of the WORLD HAS TO DIE. EVERY SPECK OF HIM HAS to die. You have to be reunited again with another nature. Your name of your first nature was born and put in a book of life. And all your deeds was wrote in it too. Everything you done under that nature was put in a book called the book of life. That's why you want the new birth. That's why you need to be baptized and buried into the water so that your old life gets buried with your old life with all the sin and all the unbelief. All the things that you did before you received Christ the word. You need that all wiped away from your life. Then nobody can tell you nothing. TELL YOU THIS, TELL you Levitical this, Levitical that, tells you you can't do this, you can't do that. No, you've entered into a relationship with the king himself and he vindicates his life in you. But first, you die. &gt;&gt; So, we don't want that book of life. Listen here in second Corinthians Paul he's talking about here he says would to God YE COULD BEAR WITH me a little bit in my folly and indeed bear with me for I am jealous over you with godly JEALOUSY FOR I HAVE ESPOUSED you to one husband that I may present you as a chasteed virgin to Christ but I fear less by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through subility. So your mind should be corrupt from the simplicity that is in Christ. Now here Paul, he's talking to the Corinthians. He says to them, now you got to you got to, you know, bear with me here. I'm going to be a little bit bold because I'm I'm I'm you know, I I I've recognized what's going on here. You guys are in a mess. You guys, you you guys, you guys need to understand something here. You're you're listening to to to the doctrines of man. You're allowing other men to take control of your mind to where you are being beguiled by the simplicity of Christ. I'm telling you that you THAT I AM GOING TO PRESENT YOU. I'M MY GOAL IS TO PRESENT YOU TO CHRIST A CHASTEED VIRGIN. But I CAN SHOW YOU SCRIPTURE WHERE PAUL IS REBUKING ALL THOSE PEOPLE, TELLING THEM, LISTEN, SOME OF YOU WERE ADULTERERS, SOME OF YOU WERE FORNICATORS, SOME OF YOU WERE MOLESTERS. THIS, THAT, SUCH WERE A LOT OF YOU. BUT UNDERSTAND THAT THIS RELATIONSHIP THAT I AM BRINGING TO YOU, THIS REVELATION ON JESUS CHRIST THAT I AM BRINGING TO YOU, THIS PAUL SPEAKING, HE'S BEING BOLD. HE SAYS, "DON'T YOU ALLOW THAT SAME SERPENT." He knew what had been revealed to him. He was talking about the SERPENT FROM THE BACK in the at the beginning THAT THIS THAT THAT DEFILED EVE TO get her to accept adultery. ACCEPT HER CONDITION TO ACCEPT THAT WORD where it brought death into her life and into the LIFE OF MANKIND. BUT JESUS HAS COME TO REVERSE THAT. And his goal IS A IS A CHASTEED VIRGIN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO PAUL'S MAKING IT VERY clear here. He's he's he's saying, listen, he's he's he's comparing don't listen to these false teachers. Be careful of denominational teachings and and and and men's ideas which will bring you into a spirit of condemnation where you don't where where you DON'T ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE WHAT GOD SAID YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Let's read on number 22. He says, "WELL, YOU SEPARATED FROM YOUR FIRST union by spiritual death. Now you are born again or remarried again to the new spiritual union and not your natural life of the things of the world but an eternal life. Amen. The that germ that was in you at the very beginning found you. Now your OLD BOOK IS GONE. Your old UNION IS GONE. NOW YOUR NAME is Now your name in your old in your has been transferred. Now you say, "Do you mean to tell me that my old book God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness?" &gt;&gt; YOUR OLD LIFE IS GONE ONCE YOU'VE BEEN BIRTHED by the word of God of this hour. &gt;&gt; You stand perfectly before God. Amen. He goes on here, next slide. HE SAYS, "NOW YOUR name is now in the new book. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the book &gt;&gt; that we're speaking from. The new book. &gt;&gt; Amen. NOT THE BOOK OF LIFE, BUT THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; What the LAMB REDEEMED. NOT THE OLD BOOK OF YOUR NATURAL UNION, but your NEW BRIDE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE NOW THE SPOTLESS BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. Your new life is in THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE. your marriage certificate. Hallelujah. Where your true eternal germ from the beginning TAKES A HOLD. NOW YOU'RE NOT ONLY FORGIVEN, BUT YOU'RE JUSTIFIED. GLORY. &gt;&gt; He says, ROMANS 5:1 SAYS, YEAH. ROMANS 5:1 SAID, "THEREFORE, BEING JUSTIFIED BY REVELATION, &gt;&gt; BY THE word of God." Amen. By faith. Look up the word I, THAT WORD DON'T MEAN FORGIVEN. THAT WORD MEANS JUSTIFIED. I IT IT DON'T MEAN YOU'RE FORGIVEN. IT MEANS YOU'RE JUSTIFIED LIKE YOU NEVER DONE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. HE SAYS, "BUT THE WORD JUSTIFIED IS THOUGH YOU NEVER DONE IT." AMEN. IT'S NOT EVEN REGARDED AT ALL. HOW IS IT DONE IN GOD'S BOOK OF THE SEA OF FORGETFULNESS? YOUR OLD BOOK AND MARRIAGE IS DIVORCED AND DEBT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. That's every unbelief in your life. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO difference between this sin, that sin. &gt;&gt; Paul murdered Christians. &gt;&gt; DON'T TRY AND PUT SOME SOME levels of sin. THERE'S NO LEVELS OF SIN. &gt;&gt; SIN IS JUST UNBELIEF IN THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS YOUR OLD MARRIAGE IS DIVORCED AND DEAD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And it's NOT EVEN IN THE MEMORIES OF GOD. AMEN. YOU ARE JUSTIFIED. THEREFORE, BEING JUSTIFIED, IT WAS IT WAS uh therefore being justified, it was accused. You was accused. You never done it in the first place. The old union is in the SEA OF GOD'S FORGETFULNESS. YOU WASN'T MARRIED TO IT TO begin with. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. AMEN. LET GO OF THIS WHOLE DIMENSION. LET GO OF EVERY DENOMINATIONAL CURSE, &gt;&gt; every spirit, every uh uh new age teaching that may have been uh placed into our minds and our hearts, IT'S ALL LIES. &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU will come to realize is that you have only been listen 95% of everything that we hear that we were taught it's a lie. IT'S IT'S IT ONLY TAKES ONE little word that's altered. What is a lie? It's the truth perverted. &gt;&gt; Everything. And all the enemy has ever done is come in and just pervert the word a little bit. &gt;&gt; That's all he's ever done all along. Comes in, takes what's been taught, takes what the the what the bride takes for that age, believes it to be thus sayeth the Lord for their age, starts to produce it in their lives. And what does the enemy do? Comes in and injects a question into it. Just like the serpent when he went to Eve and said, "Hath God said that you cannot eat of all the trees?" He was quoting exactly what God said. God said, "You shall surely die when you do." He did one thing. He added the word not. You shall not surely die. And that's what all the teachings out there have done. They will let you have a nice compromised religion. They will bring you people are running to Christ. There's a lot more people like, you know, you look at the conditions of the world, what's going on, and on the brinks of World War II, and the people are getting, they're starting to wake up. They're starting to say, "Oh, wait a minute here. You know what? I better make sure I got a reservation where I'm going after this because this party could be over sooner than I thought, you know, and they'll go and they'll join any church, &gt;&gt; but it's not going to be joining church. Yes, they can come to salvation. They can listen if they change their lives, if they repent and they turn to God and they start to live for Christ and they produce a a a good sanctified life and they they they repent, they get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, they come according to the word of God, God will honor his word and will save them. &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean that they're part of the bride. &gt;&gt; This revelation that we feed on, this is about the invisible union of the bride of Christ. Amen. It's a different revelation. It's a different part of Christ. Amen. Listen here. He goes on, he the br the bridegroom bore your shame. Amen. Himself for you in your place. He took your place for you were predestinated for him to be the to be his bride before the foundations of the world. The Bible said. So you are a predestinated seed. How did you come to this? You were deceived into into it by your first marriage to your adulterous parent Eve. There it is making perfect reference right back to the very beginning. That lie, that curse has been reversed in you. IT'S NO FAULT OF YOUR OWN. He says, go on. HE SAYS, "BY YOUR NATURAL BIRTH," LET THE MUSICIANS COME. He says, "By your natural birth, you come after Eve who committed adultery." &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE REASON YOU WERE BORN an adulteress. Every one of us born in sin, shaped in iniquity, speaking lies. YOU'RE A SINNER TO BEGIN WITH. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU WAS DECEIVED INTO IT. YOU HAD NO NO YOU. IT AIN'T YOUR FAULT. YOU NEVER DID IT BECAUSE THAT LITTLE germ that was in you &gt;&gt; was to be you before the foundations of THE WORLD BECAUSE GOD PUT YOUR NAME in the LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE &gt;&gt; and the son of MAN MINISTRY OF THIS HOUR WHICH IS THE BRIDE CHRIST IN BRIDE FORM that has the word that has the OPEN BOOK THAT'S GOT THE BOOK OF REDEMPTION THAT HAS AN OPEN UNDERSTANDING ON THE WORD OF GOD IS WHILE SPEAKING the word to the sons AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD, calling their names from the Lamb's book OF LIFE THAT YOU ARE MY BRIDE. YOU ARE MY SPOTLESS, SINLESS BRIDE BY THE WORD OF GOD OF THIS HOUR. &gt;&gt; She believes it. She stands on it. And she will not compromise &gt;&gt; with any man's teachings. Amen. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless and inspire and release sons and daughters of God from the bondage of the enemy that's tried to keep people in in in bondage by by using the word of God to place them under a previous age to place them under some Levitical teaching of the of the word of God. Yes, those are actual words from the Bible, from the word of God. But we need to recognize the age that we're living in. This is the age where the bride of Jesus Christ, SHE SHE IS ABSOLVED OF everything &gt;&gt; because she is not of this world. She was with him before Eve sinned. &gt;&gt; And she's being awakened to that revelation in this day and in this hour. Hallelujah. Let us pray. Father, Lord, we are so grateful. Lord, I I I I said it the best that I possibly could. I pray that the people will receive it. They'll they'll uh receive the liberty of your anointing and and Lord, it'll draw them to a closer walk with you, a more sincere walk with you, Lord. a a an encouragement to know that Lord that that there is a a sacrifice that there is a a life that that we need to let go of.
