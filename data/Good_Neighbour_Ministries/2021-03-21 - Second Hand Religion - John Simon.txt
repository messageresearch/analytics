TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good morning friends praise the lord here is another bright sunny [Music] sunday morning to give praise and honor to god thanks beyond to god for his mercy and juret forever praise his marvelous and wonderful name may the lord bless us and lift us up together in his divine presence we thank him for his goodness our subject for today or rather let me say this sermon will be on the subject of second hand religion second hand religion and our scripture that we shall read is found in the book of acts chapter 19 verses 11 to 17 thank god for all the old warriors preachers men of god anointed by the holy spirit that god used in the past for his glory and now this is our day let us read from the word of god and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul so that from his body were brought unto the sick and kerchiefs or aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them then certain of the vagabond jews exorcists took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the lord jesus saying we are jordy by jesus whom paul preached and they were seven sons of skiva a jew and chief of the priests which did so and the evil spirit answered and said jesus i know paul i know but who are you and the man in whom the evil spirit was leapt upon them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of the house naked and wounded and this was known to all the jews and greeks also dwelling at ephesus and fear fell upon them all and the name of the lord jesus was magnified praise god hallelujah oh my isn't it wonderful to know we serve such a savior a mighty god an everlasting father and a great deliverer praise god hallelujah i want to thank god that even you know i preach hard the word of god and i make it plain to you that the denominations are dead their day has passed their hour has slipped away but truly the true church the elected of god the true church is alive and well i want to say to you my friends that the true church is still victorious she is still triumphant and she is still marching on in the name of jesus christ i want to thank god that the church of the living god is alive amen hallelujah glory listen the church hasn't gone to to seed and the church hasn't gone to pot the church has not gone to crack the church has not gone to to to any drugs or drink or drifted off from the original world i'm speaking about the bride i'm speaking about elected this sermon is into individuals that they would recognize that the genuine church not the denominational church not the nominal church not the high church but the true genuine church of jesus christ amen is alive and she is well she is victorious she is anointed and she is carrying out the fullness of the will of the living god hallelujah take god the true church the members are not backsliding amen they're not giving up they're not compromising with the world and despite all the corvid that we see running moving around in our society despite the fact that we as believers have to march through this hot dry weary land of the modern day wilderness of sin felt lies deceit and manipulations my friends even then i want you to know the church has not failed the church has not fainted but the true elect of the living god is gathering strength and she is alive today more than she ever was thanks be to god hallelujah there are still some that are praying there are others that are fasting and yet others they're living right today they're living godly in a godless world they're living pure in the midst of mystery babylon hallelujah i believe it and i preach it and i accept it and i experience it that the truth church still has holy ghost power to meet the challenges of this evil wicked hour in which we are living in i want to thank god he has not left the church alone by herself in the end time he has not left her in this little decian darkness of the midnight hour but he promised he will be with us to the very end of the age and i am happy to announce to you that even though we are suffering from a spiritual blackout of the church ages yet we are now entered into the new day we are entered into a new time we are entered under the inspiration of the of the lord jesus himself the covenant angel that put his one foot on the land and one on the sea and says time shall be no more in other words the church ages are over the time for them is no more they're over they're done with they're gone and now the that man that woman that will walk into the eternal church age that begins with the ending of the seals hallelujah praise god i believe we are in that day and in that hour right now praise god never mind the bible says evil men seducers will wax worse and worse all manner of wickedness on the face of the earth but praise god the church today in this hour i know it may your mind might think different but let me tell you the truth because of the abundance of truth the revelation of the word that has come in this hour not the one man paul who then gave it to some others and the church of god took off in the first age but we are now in the fruit time the harvest time of god's bride tree and the fruit of the word has come to its mellow richness for the children of god and to feed their hearts and their souls with light life and power so the true church is here praise god bringing victory bringing victory and deliverance to mankind today if they will care to turn their hearts and minds toward jesus christ i want to tell you friends the move is on the move is on praise god hallelujah the move is on the song said my lord the move is on i can hear the rustling in the mulberry trees and i know i know i know the move is on hallelujah praise god the move is on yes friends but when we say the move is on then we find out friends that even though we have seen spectacular deliverances we have seen mighty miracles we have seen great earth earth-shaking supernatural events taking place hallelujah but it is not always that way but it seems as if the modern church and even many of the modern message believers seem to believe that it has to be with a a rash or rush of supernatural events before it is the real church of god but that is not so my friends the modern church believers of this day even of this message they believe that the a real move of god is is a mass meeting or convention with miracles and signs and and wonders when in reality a real move of god is calling out the elect for that certain area in which they are let me give you an example jesus down in israel was having a great revival and as the revival was growing he suddenly said to his disciples i must needs go through some area and there it was he left a great mass meeting of multitudes and went and sat upon a well to meet one elected seed of god may it be that you are one of god's elect today may be that your god's daughter to dan and god's spirit is calling may you maybe you are god's son and god is reaching out to you in particular today to call you back to himself and back to his word oh glory to god hallelujah amen so there it was that god jesus went out and waited on the well just to reach one woman you see my friends that was a mighty move of god for god's real moving is to call out his elect for that certain area whether it be one or ten or ten thousand that moving of god to call them out that is the real move of god amen for in the non-seed there is nothing to to be reborn there is nothing to revive there is nothing to bring to life anymore oh praise god but this has come to magnetize to germa ties and to wake up the seed of god for this day and in this hour i'm going now down into the book of acts and there i can see philip in samaria great meetings great healings miracles taking place signs and wonders or shaking oh praise god but in the middle of it the bible says and the spirit hand of the lord was upon philip and the spirit of god picked him up amen and moved him and took him to a wilderness desert glory to god hallelujah when philip came to himself philip found that he was in the wilderness and there was a chariot passing by with an african an ethiopian with his bible open and he was reading out of his bible and philip said do you understand what you're reading and the man said how can i understand unless one would teach me or show me and there philip preached jesus christ hallelujah and when he heard the opening of the word and he heard the reality of what god has done the bible said that the man said there is water there what hinders me to be baptized and philip baptize him in the name of the lord you see my friends one soul is worth more than a world and god counts his children his elected seed as his precious jewels and even he has to leave a mass meeting with multitudes of people who praise god who may be healed maybe say may be healed may be delivered in various ways but his heart is on his elect even one in an area in other areas there may be five ten hundred hundred and twenty five hundred a thousand two thousand five thousand we don't know but a real genuine move of god is to call out god's elect for that particular area a lot of people even in this message still do not understand what is meant by greater works than these shall ye do they do not understand that it is the entire bright body of christ that will to together do those greater works and it does not mean that individually each one of us is going to do great spectacular works that will astonish the entire world amen praise god hallelujah i want you to see that the real move of god sometimes is not with all the attractions spectacular things that will feed your flesh and attract your mind or your attention like that but the spirit of god sometimes moves so so softly so quietly that if you're not watching you you'll count it off you you're brushing the side and and the spirit of god will just make his quietly his way away this gentle dove of peace amen spirit of god will move without great fanfare great noise hallelujah sometimes the spirit of god will move in such a way it will astonish you maybe while i'm yet speaking the word as in the bible it says acts chapter 10 verse 44 while peter yet speak those words the holy spirit fell on all them which heard the word not just hearing with the ears but those who heard the word and recognize what they were hearing my friends let me say this i preached the word of god and seen it where once while preaching a gentleman was sitting in the congregation and as the word went forth with power the holy spirit wanted to confirm his word and here was the gentleman with a cancer in his truth and as the word went forth it seems the devil got scared and he just and before you know it that catcher was crossed up and was right there on the floor the people screamed and shouted because they saw the hand of god it had nothing to do with me but the spirit of god was on the scene friends and sometimes he moves in such a quiet way without any fanfare without any spectacular stuff like that and he moves like that and it's a very wonderful heartwarming move of the living god i want to say to you again the true church the elect lady the church the bride of christ is alive and well and she is more powerful in this end time than even the earlier ages of the church you see but i don't see this i don't see that i don't see the other oh that's what thomas said if i don't see the wounds if i don't see this i don't see that oh my but when he got a spiritual revenant revelation of who it really was oh he said my lord and my god hallelujah no more i've got to push my hands and touch you or feel it before i believe it no he believed to see the very glory of the living god amen hallelujah man makes water pumps and they're pumping their night with a whole lot of noise and carrying on a lot of noise like that but then god just lets the sun come out and the sun in some hours pulls millions of gallons of water right back into the sky with no noise no attraction nobody noticing anything but millions of gallons of water dries up from the earth and is drawn right back up into heavens you see god moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform he plants his footsteps on the sea and he rides upon the storm now look at it man has something called generators and they will have these generators working and again a whole nother noise generating electricity generating light and generating power like that but watch the same sun just comes out and it just comes out that's it and it lights up not a building not a city the entire world is lit up by the light of the sun with no noise now look at me look how i'm shining look how bright i am look how look look at me no the sun just does its job and it just shines the light and it's brighter than anything you've ever seen before without any noise without any fanfare anything of that matter i want to tell you the church still has power amen for greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and i'm glad to know that this church has caught the revelation of this last prophet's message and this this church is a is a conquering church this church is a triumphant church this church is a vibrant church this church is a victorious church you are a victorious son of god you're a victorious child of the king glory to god hallelujah amen praise god hallelujah i want to thank god that the devil will never triumph over the true church because even in this last day we are equipped to meet the challenge of the hour we're equipped by the living god you say brother simon what do you mean we are equipped well god has set the prophet according to the prophecies of malachi 4 5 and that prophet has brought a message and stored up spiritual food for us to eat in its right our jew season glory to god hallelujah but we are equipped to meet any challenge of this age and of this time in which we live hallelujah or praise god that generation back there the devil challenged them and the devil is here again in our time to challenge this generation amen we look at the devil and the the same question that he asked the sons of skeva he's asking the church world again today amen hallelujah who are you where is your faith amen have you got your own faith or are you relying on somebody else's faith oh take god i'm not i'm here to preach to the individual i'm here to preach to the true sons and daughters of the living god hallelujah and each one of us has got to respond to this challenge of satan individually individually we got to give an answer to the devil's question that he is asking of us of who are you amen now listen there were having a great revival down in ephesus and the power of god was moving everywhere signs wonders as we read in our text the bible tells us mighty miracles hand courtships from the body of paul and their people were being delivered and it shook the entire city and shook the entire countryside great things were happening god was demonstrating himself in a tremendous way and it became the talk of the town if they had newspapers it would have been in the newspapers it would have been all over the internet but this was the talk of the tongue at that time amen hallelujah and while paul was ministering oftentimes he'd come against demon-possessed people and he would say in the name of jesus christ come out of her or come out of him or come out of the child loose the woman satan in the name of jesus christ hallelujah now these vagabond jews they were jews but they were vagabonds amen see there's a lot of christians they're christian but they're vagabond christians because watch they were going at the edge of the meeting and watching everything paul did and the bible tells us these men were exhausted in other words they were ones who believed they could cast out devils without the name of jesus without the authority and the power of jesus amen and so these men hearing paul and seeing paul's effectiveness of his ministry they realized that paul was often using the mighty name of jesus hallelujah oh praise god and so they felt oh that is his secret amen his secret is in the those words in the name of jesus christ hallelujah oh praise god oh we got it now here is this man come to town he has got a brand new spell that we can use there's a man that has a magic word that we all can go and make some money from we can go out there and start a ministry we can go out there with that with those words of that name with our witchcraft and wizardry and we can have a great marvelous wonderful time amen hallelujah all mine praise god they were convinced because every time paul rebuked the devil the devil didn't argue the devil just took off the devil just screamed and come out of the people that were bound by him and while i'm speaking and you're listening may the devil loose you right now may the sick be healed now oh receive deliverance as you believe god's word hallelujah may the great holy spirit break the spell of sin across your life the habits that hold you set you free now every spirit of drug and drink alcohol smoke nicotine loose the children of the king glory to god in the name of jesus christ for at the name of jesus every knee shall bow every town shall confess that jesus christ is lord hallelujah amen praise god hallelujah amen so these vagabonds these vagabond jewels they decided they were going to use the new uh incantation the new magic word they're going to use paul's spell you know in the name of jesus in the name of jesus all they got to do is use the name of jesus this new uh you know collection of magic words they added to their vocabulary so that they could use it amen now these seven sons of skiva they were the sons of the priests of the chief priest i don't know if there were like the sons of eli uh misbehaving but the bible said vagabond jews you see all my friends so they went out and found a fellow that was possessed of the devil and thought they would now try out their new smell on this man with the devil and so they gathered around him i can see them as they gather around that man for now they're gonna use the magic word they're gonna use paul's spell that was magic words in the name of jesus christ hallelujah amen and so they came to him and they tried out by giving him praise god hallelujah they said oh my friends we're going to say it exactly the way that paul said it and as long as we say it the way that prophet said it that devil has to go oh my my my they felt they really had it they really got the secret they feel they were really on to something if they only repeated pirated oh my the words of the prophet paul amen now remember brother branham said i said and preached to you exactly what paul preached amen and he could say nothing different to paul but paul said even if i were to come back and say something different to what i'm saying even if an angel came down from heaven and tried to tell you something different from what i am saying let him be accursed for he was the apostle the messenger the prophet for that first age amen alpha omega and now we see the same thing the sons of skiva jews these are christians some of them are message believers they are followers of this prophet's message and they believe they'll defeat the devil they'll cast out the devil they'll have victory and they'll be able to overcome by just going and saying what the prophet paul said or what our prophet brother branham said by just quoting his words or reading or by saying the words and it but the devil will tremble and just come out of the people oh my this is exactly what paul preached what are you saying brother simon this is what brother branham preached oh how could you say that this is what he said here he said say what i said oh hallelujah you gotta understand what he meant when he said says that say what i said oh my lord hallelujah oh praise god so they began to cry out to this man that was possessed with devils and said we are jordy by jesus whom paul preached amen oh brother brangham said this brother branham said the other brother branham said this over here brother branham said that those men must have said and paul said this and paul said that and paul said i assure thee but jesus amen whom brother branham preached whom paul preached and you know what it did stir up the devil but the devil got mad not because of them using the name of jesus but they kind of showed some disrespect for him thinking he's a fool or or he doesn't know what's really happening in the spirit realm and the devil spoke to them and spun around and looked at every one of them and turned and said yes jesus i know i met him at galilee i met him in many a meeting when he was preaching in galilee he cast me out from many bodies many cripples many blind deaf dumb possessed he cast me out so jesus i know i know him in galilee yes i know him because i met him again in the garden of gethsemane and we had a wrestling match there he prayed all night and we wrestled in a titanic battle we wrestled until he was sweating blood what a battle that was and uh but i know jesus and so the devil began to speak to them and said yes and know him in galilee and know him and gets heavenly and i know him and go on go got his hill and there one got his heel my friends that killed him but they didn't know that his spirit was still fighting with me darkness covered the land midday the sun was blooded out for here we were engaged in the greatest battle ever fought lightning flashed the thunder rolled we were at war it was a contest between me and god between jesus christ hallelujah and me oh my for the souls of man because all those prophets all the patriots before i held them in my grip i had them and so we fought our way all the way from golgotha right down into gehenna we fought our way to the prison house of hell and there he took the keys of death hell and the grave away from me oh please god hallelujah oh all my friends and open the prison doors and let out all of my captives and the next morning he came out and all the gravestone rolled back and out of that grave he stepped out and said i am the resurrection and the life oh praise god hallelujah my friend i tell you i know jesus so that devil let them know that he really knew jesus and he said yes jesus i know and paul i know him too because i met paul in the deserts of arabia there for five years i tested him attempted him like i did with jesus on the mountain oh of in a time of temptation i met paul up tested him attempted him i fought with him we had many a battle in the deserts of arabia oh praise god i tell you friends what a battle that was but then paul had to leave the desert and come by the command of god into ministry and later on we can hear that devil just like he said i know jesus amen and you know that's the truth how when jesus was walking on the street the devils would scream out i know thee who thou art that want the holy one of god amen praise god the man at gadara said the same thing i know you who you are oh my art thou come to cast us out before the time you see the devil knew jesus and in the same way the devil knew paul so it's a paul i know because when paul had the great battle in philippi when that woman would wha with the spirit of divination would follow him around everywhere he went and the devil said i know you i know you you are the servant of the most high god hallelujah you know the story paul cast that devil out after a while but the fact i am making is that the devil knew jesus and the devil knew paul amen but the devil wants to know who are you the one the devil wants to know if you're a real christian what is back of your words are you just speaking words or is there a life behind the name that makes the demons tremble oh praise the wonderful name of our blessed lord jesus hallelujah amen oh praise god hallelujah amen all they had those seven sons gave ahaz like some christians today have like some message believers have all they have was the words and the name of a person amen hallelujah they heard the name that somebody else used they heard the words that somebody else used but they didn't have the authority they did not have that anointing they did not have the reality of the power and the presence of god flowing through their lives for the devil to recognize that they were one they and their father are one amen hallelujah oh praise god there they were they heard paul preaching many heard brother branham preaching amen but yet they don't know who they are but they may know who he is they may be able to explain to you who he is why god sent him and what his job was what the prophecies say but they don't know who they are in the word of god they have no recognition of their position in the in the body of christ and their placing of who god has placed and their purpose of why god has placed them here upon the earth to walk work out his divine will amen yes i believe today the devil in this generation will say ah jesus i know paul i know william branham oh i know him i met him when he was just a baby in a cabin oh and i was about to freeze him and his mother to death but then here comes a holy fire of god flowing into the window and come into that place and i had to run for my life oh i know william branham oh my i know him because i met him in many a meeting especially up there in that meeting up there in chicago oh i brought i went up there with 400 of my prophets to meet him and in the name of jesus christ he defeated us and he cast out every devil by his word for the glory of god so william branham i know hallelujah but friends let me say to you in the name of jesus christ the devil is not afraid of brother william marion branham today let me repeat the devil is not afraid of brother william branham today for he has moved off the scene moses my servant is dead william branham is dead now joshua rise you must go over this jordan now joshua rise up you must make the crossing oh praise god hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord and so my friends he has gone off the scene and the devil is not afraid of brother branham and so we must become very conscious of where we stand today because every generation must face this challenge other than the devil will challenge every person and every generation as to their position and their confession of this word of the living god hallelujah amen praise god if you want to have what brother branham had none of us will ever have the fullness of what he had but we are sparks off of the anvil we'll have some we'll have a bit we'll have a little here a little there each one will have something off of what he had and what he had was the blessed holy spirit the pill of fire that followed moses followed the churn of israel the pillar of fire that appeared in his meetings the pillar of fair that was over there in jamaica the pillar of fair that was in south africa switzerland oh praise god and many other places where the fire of god appeared and the power of the holy spirit penetrated the hearts lies minds and bodies of the people and set them free by the spoken word which is the original seed of the living god but if we want to have some of what we have we got to pray like he prayed amen we got to believe god's word like he believed amen praise god hallelujah and if we are going to stand like man of god we got to preach like he preached without fear without favor and in faith for the glory of the name of our lord jesus christ hallelujah amen praise god we got to live the kind of loving overcoming life that he lived also friends praise god hallelujah or else my friends when you try to use the name of jesus that name of jesus will not be effective in your on your lips coming from your mouth or from your heart because faith is not inherited you cannot inherit convictions you can't inherit relationships with god that is supernaturally given from the presence of almighty god blessed is the man the woman whom i invite to approach unto me hallelujah all the people of today believe that they choose him not realizing he has to choose you amen blessed is the person whom he chooses to approach unto him and to receive his blessed word hallelujah amen so my friends right from the cabin to chicago and to the car crash the devil will say yes i know him and know him right through his entire life but who are you where do you come from with what authority are you uh speaking or rebuking or praying or or whatever it is in whose name do you come glory to god hallelujah amen because the life the the name is doesn't mean anything there are many jesuses over there in mexico there are many jesuses in hispania there's many jesuses in the spanish south american countries oh my friend but there is only one jesus christ the anointed word of the hour amen and it is his life behind your name that causes the demons to tremble when the devil looks at you and realize that the real christ that's the same yesterday today and forever he lives in you he moves in you he has his being in you that's why he's still alive today moving in the hearts and lives of his elected amen praise god hallelujah every individual got to have this kind of faith like the prophet of malachi 4 5 had amen and the reason why some people are tossed about the reason why some people following this word are having a struggle with their with their walk and the struggle with living right many having struggles we're trying to keep the guidelines and standards conduct an order of the word of god amen hallelujah many of them flip flip flop this way in the church today out tomorrow believe today don't believe tomorrow uh moving like a man a drunken under this sledgehammer blows of satan and the punches the devil has put upon them i want you to know you've got to know god for yourself you cannot live your life off of brother branham's experience you must enter in the innervale and have your own experience your own conference with god hallelujah i want to quote david duplessi one of the great preachers of all pentecost from the full gospel businessmen's association he used these words in a great sermon and he said his words with these god has no grandchildren only children oh praise god hallelujah you cannot inherit conviction you cannot inherit faith you cannot inherit any of those things you've got to go to god and get them for yourself amen hallelujah oh my friends i believe that the church of god has gotten away from the shekinah glory the glory has departed they have gotten away from the shekinah glory of the presence of the living god hallelujah they've gotten away from the shining warming presence of the revelation of the word of the living god hallelujah listen quoting the prophet of this hour out of conference with god amen grandsons god don't have grandchildren god only has sons and daughters your grandchild if your mother was just a pentecostal if you just say oh my daddy was a pentecostal amen you're just a grandchild you've got to be born just like your daddy or your mammy was born god doesn't have grandchildren he's you've got to have the experience yourself you can't go in on your peppers or your mama's experience you've got to have your own that's your birth you got to have it god don't recognize anything else all to be sons and daughters amen no man can call jesus the christ by intellectual conceptions i'm speaking out of discernment of spirit no spirits now no man can call jesus the christ by intellectual conceptions in other words anyone can use the words in the name of jesus christ anyone could say that but my friends it's not my intellectual conceptions no man can call jesus to christ because he just feels sorry for his sins in a meeting and comes to the altar to repent let me repeat that again no man can call jesus the christ just because he feels sorry for his sins in a meeting and comes and repents at the altar no sir no man can call jesus the christ except by the revelation of the holy ghost making it known unto him that upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it there's the revelation there it is there's what he has built his church upon amen praise god friends god has not built his church on intellectual conception god has not built his church on religious emotion but god has built his church on the spirit rock revelation the spiritual revelation of jesus christ of who he is oh praise god amen amen praise god don't you come believing you in this message are you just going to live off of brother branham's convictions the holy spirit needs to strike your soul where you s you come to a place where you stand on the rock where moses stood because you're standing on the same word because you're standing on the same rock revelation you begin to see exactly what he saw and then you can say what he said not by repeating his word but saying it because you're seeing what he's saying and you recognize what the holy spirit is doing in this day and in this hour oh my lord hallelujah o praise god amen amen my friend let us see clearly here what god has for us oh glory to god amen amen what are you trying to do i'm gonna wind this up at this point but i'm gonna have to pick this message up again uh and carry it a little further if you would will allow me and if you will return to listen to the rest of this message but uh you cannot live brother branham's children can't be saved they can't live without his conviction with his conviction they've got to have their own conviction you cannot live with the prophet's faith you you're not an inheritor you can't inherit his faith his gifts his presence you cannot inherit that for it was the holy ghost and even so we must each one one by one we must come come to him and may the great holy spirit come into your heart himself and live within you so that when the devil looks he's not scared of brother branham who was here now dead and gone he's not scared of you if you don't know who you are and what you were raised up for and whether or not the holy spirit that identified you that in you he has seen and recognized the original life the seed of god the gene the germ god placed in you before the foundation of the world oh glory to god may god bring you to a place where you can say lord my eyes have been open my heart has recognized i see you who you are i confess i repent of my past i cast off my better garments lord god open my blinded eyes that i might see oh praise god and i believe the holy spirit right now oh my will hear your prayer will answer your hearts cry will bless you will straighten you will raise you up and use you for his glory for his honor and for his name's sake so let it be done our gracious god a heavenly father i commit myself to you for a closer walk i commit to you all my hearers all these who oh god look at the broadcast and recognize the spirit the power and the presence the life of jesus christ hallelujah deep calling to the deep and the deep responding oh god cast out devils heal the sick raise the dead manifest your word your works your wonders and release your people from any captivity they were in that they might truly raise their hands to heaven and worship you o god giving you praise honor and glory amen not lord god with some second-hand religion but with a first-hand experience recognizing that the same god that was in christ the god live that same god lives in me amen thank you father take all the praise the honor and the glory in the name of jesus christ amen and amen may the lord bless you my brothers and sisters may the sweet presence of the holy spirit overshadow you and go with you as you take the name of jesus with you everywhere that you go wednesday
