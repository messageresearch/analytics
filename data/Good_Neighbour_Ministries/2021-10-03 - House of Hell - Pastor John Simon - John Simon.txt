amen praise the lord give the lord another heck back [Music] [Applause] [Music] everything we do we ought to do it in the spirit of god so we are thankful of god today for this great opportunity of being here please be seated thank you very much worshipping worship team god bless every one of you musicians worship leader they both have different styles but it's the same holy spirit praise god hallelujah so be thankful to god for that you're conscious or you ought to be conscious and aware that though we are having these services here of course all our believers can't be here um for various reasons age immune immune problems uh stuff of that nature aged or whatever else but we are make sure talk to them that these services are not just local but um we we are certainly getting communications from various nations and recently we got some uh communication coming from in florida some of our spanish brethren there they weren't sure whether we are believers of the message of brother william marion branham and so i'm deliberately and purposely saying it right now so that uh they will be aware and conscious of who we are and what we believe and preach and teach veteran amen colombia in different parts of of the world in the uh you know they're watching or they watch the program uh when it goes out praise the lord so we are not just a blessing to you here but it's touching hearts and changing lives around the world we may be just a small part of it but because jesus prophesied about the great speckled bird that tried to get her to water down her doctrine they tried to polish up her doctrine they tried to put a black name on him and his doctrine they do every possible thing but the gates of hell shall not prevail against the true church of the living god it can't prevail against revelation can't prevail against these foundations that he set the church on because we know we are set on the true foundation which is the original the word of god that comes from the mind and then the mouth of god and now made manifest so we are thankful to god that we are a part of this great eternal purpose of god imagine that you were included in that and that's why paul said we are sought to be so thankful that he had so much in other words he had so much confidence in us that before we even got to earth he predestinated you to be a fellow laborer together with god to be a yoke fellow with him to get this work done amen there is late night is falling and we know jesus said that the broad is the way amen you know there's a lot of places that they call and name broadway and they just call it that but the bible already spoke about the broad way and the narrow way and there's a way in that narrow way and so ah few there be that's gonna find that little way that's in the narrow way and i'm thankful to god that he made a way for me to enter through the needle's eye and i'm glad for every one of you that because we can no more just get up and make a general statement and say oh we all saved we all in the bride we're all going in i don't know that i am believing that what i have preached and taught that you have caught that revelation and that by your individual faith that will take you in but i would know that fully until we get on the other side and in the words of the psalm you're just saying when we're together again just praising the lord then we'll see one another in the house of the lord amen meanwhile but during that time i am trusting him that as i see you visually hear you visually contact your spirit visually while we're talking about the word and sense what is in you that i can trust god that lord even if i leave the earth i know there's some amongst them that will be on that other side that's all i can trust god i just believe and look even if one amen i'll still be praising god if there's ten i'll be shouting if there's a hundred brother philip i'll be jumping and leaping lord of god hallelujah [Applause] but i'm believing god hallelujah and the holy spirit is leading make no mistake about this the pyramid is narrowing to its point we've come to the race's edge and we have got to believe and trust god every week i'm coming here but i'm not coming here with just another message i'm not just coming here to bring a religious discourse uh i'm not just coming here to try to appear spiritual or or some good or great preacher i am just here trying to catch the mind of the spirit for this hour and bring the word of god to you the best that i know how to bring it i was built for this purpose somebody else built for another purpose another preacher has a different style a different way of delivering the word god built each one for his purpose every vessel has its own purpose and so uh my ways my rough ways are the way of saying things you may not like it so god made it maybe didn't build you to listen to this but all those who are mine will come to me all whom god predestinate to hear the message this way will hear it then recognize it praise god hallelujah they'll recognize that somewhere deep in their deep within their soul they heard it before and so now they recognize what they already heard oh praise god may the holy spirit of the living god help us everyone i tell you we look let's look to the word proverbs chapter 7 verses 24 to 27. next week is uh thanksgiving is next week thanksgiving huh is that right wow praise god thanksgiving week so let's prepare ourselves to have a real thanksgiving praise the lord and by that i don't mean you bring a whole cow a hill barbecued or anything like that because we have the word here that can fill you up praise the lord hallelujah of course you can go up the stakes afterwards but right now we read from proverbs 7. now i would advocate and encourage you to read the entire chapter when you have the time but i read verses 24-27 heart unto me therefore o ye children and attend to the words of my mouth let not mine heart decline to her ways go not astray in her path for she had cast down many wounded yay many strong men have been slain by her her house is the way to hell going down to the chambers of death amen father we thank you for the reading of thy word we ask your blessing upon us all today that the spirit of god will quicken that that which is in us to receive the word may the crystals within our heart be so tuned to thee and your spirit that we will have a clear a clear reception and that you will receive all the glory in jesus name amen praise god god bless you praise god may the lord bless us praise god hallelujah um you know and we give god the glory for the spiritual astronauts that are in here you know one time i don't know why i'm going to be talking like this but anyway one time a father someone was talking to this father that was proud of his son that was in the bible seminary and said how's your son doing oh he's doing fine he says what's he studying said well he's studying um spiritual aeronautics aeronautics in a seminary how could he be studying about space and studying about the airplane flying and all those things in the seminary well well he said well the last time i went there and i asked dean how is my son doing he says man well your son you know your son he is just constantly in space so he left with the impression that his son is studying spiritual aeronautics space meaning that the deacon was trying to tell him your son is spaced out in the class he doesn't know what's going on i hope there is nobody in here spaced out and you don't really know what's happening around you and what's taking place because the word has taken off it has gone to another level and i believe certainly that we are in the third world there's so many things i'm seeing now i don't even know um you know i can't speak on it in one week so we just got to keep going praise the lord by his grace praise the lord hallelujah well um in this proverb chapter 7 verses 24 to 27 which i read you'll find in there of course the terminology house of hell right so that was not brother branham's makeup even though he heard that in the vision house of hell because you know the sister was speaking with him and she said brother branham you know deliver the people they need deliverance all kinds of things that need to be delivered and he said i was just thinking about it thinking about it but how could i do it i'm just so weak but then he heard the voice behind him when he turned it was the lord jesus and he said to him go deliver the people deliver the people and he's thinking well how might one deliver these people before he could think he hurt himself saying house of hell give way to the name of jesus amen the name of jesus christ amen which is the word give way for this word that we're preaching you've got to open up and move aside for this word that we are preaching but in this text that we read solomon is saying how that he was standing at his window of his palace looking out towards the streets and there in the twilight hour evening time he said a young man was accosted or approached by a harlot and the harlot brought him to her house you can read the entire thing in that chapter when you get home but to the end of the chapter he is saying here ignorance to the word chained by lack of revelation chained because these clouds of darkness or teachers of the bible bible teachers sincere but they are spreading clouds of unbelief and darkness on the minds of the people and taking them away from the world the original truth spoken of in the bible by patriarchs prophets jesus christ the apostles the seven church messengers and in this hour men of god who have truly caught the message of this last prophet hallelujah and are speaking from the storehouse of the revelation of this mystery of the word being made known to us now change the chains of darkness before i go further the holy spirit let me to another vision that was had he says here souls in prison now now i was just a boy see i was just a boy and i was out hunting with my friend or hunting is my second nature we were about six months apart in age and he let his gun go off by mistake and shot me through the legs both legs real close to me with a shotgun and i was taken to the hospital and i there dying they'd taken an x-ray the shot was so close to an artery i thought well this is the end of me and then i went into a vision i went into a trance and i thought i was in hell see but when that vision struck me i was so weak i lost all that blood and there i was i felt myself sinking sinking falling dropping into an endless eternity sinking there first as i sank i saw myself going through them clouds of darkness he had to get past the clouds of darkness going down into hell i just told you what those clouds of darkness was to get past all the teachings of false teachings uh on scriptural teachings you know differing from the message of this messenger of this age going down down down down and the first thing you know i found myself in the regions of the lost and there i screamed and i looked and everything around me there was no foundations to it i could not stop myself from falling for i kept falling and falling and there was no stopping nowhere nothing to hold onto just falling oh my there i was i screamed remember i was just a boy 14 years old so i screamed for my daddy of course being just a kid that's all i could do i screamed for my daddy but my daddy wasn't there then i screamed for my mother my mother wasn't there i just had somebody catch me catch me catch me and there was no mother there to catch me i was going down and i screamed then to god and there was no god in that place there was nothing there and after a while as i was falling i i heard the most mournful sounds that i ever heard and it was the awfulest feeling along with those sounds that even a literal burning fire would be a pleasure to decide of what this was now you know these visions have never been wrong and in this one i tell you it was the most horrible feeling i ever had i heard a noise sounded like some kind of a haunted house some kind of a haunted affair and when i looked coming was a bunch of women they had green stuff you could see their face they had green stuff under their eyes and their eyes look run back like the women today paint their eyes and their faces run back like that their eyes and face and their work coming towards me going oh lord have mercy o god have mercy upon me i just screamed out lord have mercy where are you if you'd only let me get out of here and go back i promise you i'll be a good boy now that's the only thing i could have said and god knows i'll meet that at the day of judgment he has judged me for that statement i just made if it's true or false that's what i said lord let me go back and i'll promise you i'll be a good boy when i got shot back then i used to tell lies all kinds of lies not only that i had done pretty near everything anybody else had ever done it's only one thing and never done was to commit adultery god be merciful to me i looked around me and there was those weary creatures and they were looking at me like i'm a new arrival the most hideous horrible ungodly feeling look at them great big eyes with big long eyelashes out like that run back there look like a cat back like this green stuff under their eyes over thing looked like it conquered or something and they were just continually going and then in a moment of time i had come back to my natural life and senses again and from that time i knew there was a real regions of the damned somewhere for i was there is that right you couldn't have a better testimony don't tell me about it i've been there i know what it is and i'm telling you about it now okay now i'm going to take you from there to 40 years later because later he said i am 54. back then i was only 14. so it's 40 years ago and you know 40 is the number of judgment right now i went with my wife and we went out in tucson doing some shopping and she went in we went in downstairs and there was a bunch of them looking boys all right now i'm pause here a moment i want you to know all this i'm quoting from the prophet of this 20th century william marion branham and i'm saying that protect this church protect myself so that folks will understand that i am courting and i'm staying behind the word of the prophet amen are you following me listen and there was a bunch of them looking boys i think it was arnold schwarzenegger's as girly men and they had their hair ratted down today i believe we call it tails right like that wrecked it down you know how it is how some of the women do they will just take their hair to the back with some type of thing like that and the bangs come down in the front and wearing them funny trousers they had funny trousers back then and we got them here today right and uh my i guess whatever you want to call them back we call them beatniks i don't know what you call them now but it's the same thing maybe different style but same kind of funny trousers and there they were everybody looking at them and i couldn't just stand it so i went upstairs and sat down and there was an escalator there okay and bringing people up and i turned sick at my stomach seeing some of those women coming up that escalator oh young old indifferent wrinkled young every way everyone with little bitty shorts on they're filthy body sexy dressed women like that and here they come up the escalator i was sitting back in the chair with my head down but then i turned to look and when i looked at once i felt a change come over me i started feeling i had seen this somewhere i seen this somewhere her eyes were painted just like a cat you you know put up like this and they were wearing scat glasses and everything with eyes up green stuff under and off their eyes that there was the very thing i had seen when i was but a child there was the woman exactly i got numb all over my body see and then i really began to look around and then hearing all the people in the mall crowds of them there were i just heard a mumbling mumbling similar to that mumbling mumbling the noise of the crowd but it was up talking about prices and things in the building but the sound was the same there it was and i thought there were in hell they didn't even know it greenish blue under their eyes greenish blue he repeats under their eyes and he repeats it again there was those women i say painted with greenish blue under their eyes just the way the vision said or showed me 40 years ago oh my conquered eyes those women and they were from everywhere french spanish indian white all of them see there in other words every race that's what he's trying to say there amen and with them here styles and everything else with combs and the way they comb it back like that and then conquered looking eyes for the eyes were filled with paint they run back like a cat's eye and talking here talking there talking talking talking and i found i was again i was here standing in jesse's penny store but i was literally back in hell again i preached a message on this several years ago hell on earth now what what isaiah had prophesied hell had opened her mouth and moved up right and hell is not just the pit there but hell moved up and manifesting itself here on the earth and people are behaving like the demons of hell right here on the earth right praise god hallelujah oh my think about it so hell on earth hallelujah what he's saying also here now i didn't have to go into a vision to see hell i was standing in jesse penny store naturally and i was looking around and seeing the same hell right in front of me on the earth the behavior the sounds the atmosphere the mumbling all going on just like i saw it in a vision 40 years ago but now i'm not television i'm standing here and i'm looking and hearing and seeing the same thing hell on earth now think of it hell has moved up is that right yes praise god my goodness listen oh my surely i said lord this time i haven't died i haven't gone anywhere there they were just like in that vision see just that mumble going on on the people them women coming up that escalator walking around with and and my hearing that and there was those green funny looking eyes mournful sounds amen oh my my wife came up and said billy just and i said just let me alone here for a while honey and she said if you don't mind i said if you don't mind i want to go home she said are you sick billy he said no he said you can go ahead uh honey never mind how i feel go ahead if you got any shopping to do just go do it and she said no i'm finished and he said all right then take me home and i took her by the arm and we walked out friends we got to ask ourselves are we living in the regions of the lost are we already walking around in the regions of the dam oh my think on that with revelation you understand when all the elect seed are called out what's left the regions of the lost and damned all that's left is the lost and then right amen and that's the reason why i believe people can lie cheat steal swear cuss take the lord's name in vain they can do witchery witchcraft they can conspire and do all kinds of things they can talk about surgical strikes mass murder kill thousands kill millions kill people and everything else and talk about it being a surgical strike as if they're killing insects or swatting flies and have not a twinge of conscience they don't even feel nothing about it why they lost that something got put in man nothing sacred anymore conscience god fear of god god fear of holiness god preaches the church the word of god is now made into a laughing stock mockery jokes on the television my god hallelujah mike i tell you friends the people don't even have any sense of retribution anymore that they're going to pay for everything they do and every action they take listen what day are we living there in for i tell you something happened there what they are be living in could this be the third pole what he's talking about and i'll talk about that another time a lot of people talk the third police speaking on arms and legs the third pull is preaching to souls imprisoned now the third poll is preaching to the regions of the lost is it's giving a witness like noah did even though their door was shut yet the bible says god allowed the preach for 40 more amen days so they can at least get the word and can be judged by that word but they didn't pay heed amen praise god and here he said could that be the third poem think of it praise god hallelujah my imagine that jesus went and preached to the souls that are in prison now i want you to catch this just this little piece here what he says i want you to know he preached to them souls that were in prison which is hell satan's prison is hell right as long as he can get you and take you there along with himself he don't care because he don't have hope of redemption you know no hope of salvation so as many is like a murderer that's being condemned to die he can only die one time so he doesn't care how many more he kills how many lives he destroys how many deaths how many mournful suffering sickness death that and deprivation deprivation he can bring on the human race he does not care amen and so he's going to bring you into hell praise god hallelujah oh my well of course hell is a place a holding place just like he held the patriarchs and apostles before and until brother branham says here before you go to the white throne judgment he says that's where you're held amen a place of torment yes but you're held in that place of torment just before the white throne judgment after which because no god will not bring anyone to judgment without the trial he says right they got to be tried and they got to come up before him the judge and therefore hell you're held in that place of torment and then death and hell and the grave and satan and everything is cast into the lake of fire amen hallelujah praise god amen friends i've been in both places regions of the lord blessed and the regions of the lost and that's why i stand here as your brother today to warn you flee from the downward path don't you never go that road just go god's way but never go that road don't never go towards the regions of the lost you can't even picture that hell being that bad whatever you do don't never forget remember there's a regions of the blessed which paul said i had not seen or earned nor neither has it entered into the heart of man what god has for them in store that love him oh my repent if you are not and get saved in the name of the lord jesus christ amen praise the lord house of hell give way to the name of jesus christ jesus had to take out those prophets and patriarchs that were held and it took the keys of death and hell and set them free and now we are here with the word of god screaming to satan satan house of hell give way to the name of jesus christ loosen us vastly lexie of god that you're holding in bondage lose them everyone wherever they are in the name of jesus christ amen my friends i want you to know satan god assists them just like this government has assisted them you commit a crime and the cops are going to pick you up when they pick you up they take you to the local jail that they may have right in their prison house they put you in that local jail and what we read in proverbs 7 house of the harlot their houses of the harlot everywhere around the nation and her gateways her doorways are the ways to heal her doctrine is the way to hell everything she will tell you young man young woman young believer newborn again tell you in your ears preach the you say to you it's a lie amen you put your faith in the word of god amen amen you say you're you're you're saying a lot of these churches are are houses of hell houses of the harlot yes she is the mother of harlots and her daughters are the daughters of the harlot the harlot themselves with their trinity doctrine with their false baptisms their false ideas of what it was the original sin was and is their false thoughts of how jesus was and what kind of person that he was amen my friends back to the word back to the bible oh my glory god hallelujah local jails layman that's what the police does but here in the spiritual realm where they tell you that they join this church join that church join over here join over there it's nothing as the words of a great evangelist a allen he said they're nothing but prisons with stained glass windows hey man the glass windows are just to fool you that you're okay and you're not really in a prison you're free to do whatever you want but the moment you move a little from that doctrine the moment you disagree a little bit this way the moment you try to go that way and start to think for yourself and to hear the word of god for yourself and decide for yourself that right away they'll excommunicate you amen they'll put you in solitary confinement oh my friend let's go back to the bible back to the original faith in the word of god hallelujah amen oh the devil is smart he's not going to bring you to the main mother right away like that he brings you to a branch or one of his franchises he'll take you and put you right there amen in that place amen i tell you every one of these prisons got to have a war uh get got to have a prison guards is that right of course we know the warden over all the prisons is satan here's the prison warden and then you got to have prison guards to make sure you stay in the prison and you don't climb over the walls of their doctrine you don't climb out of the the web they got you in and they want to make sure you don't hear that that prophet william branham they want to make sure you don't hear his voice coming over the wall and so they're going to shut you down in every way and they have prison guards to do so and they are going to use a accent 238 to make sure you stay in line they're going to preach from that book called the book of acts about pentecost and the power of god and healing and speaking in tongues and revival coming and have you in that state where you think you're free meanwhile you don't realize they're just keeping you in line and keeping you that way until it's too late when you realize you can't get out anymore you're still in the prison amen now and again you know they'll give you a little exercise you get a chance to exercise right in the exercise yard of the prison and when you get out you feel so free but you're really not free is that right oh my you get out there and the devil allows you to have a party and say this is life it's not life it's death you're not free you're bound you're still in the prison amen of hell give way to the name of jesus christ give way to this word that is being preached in the name of the lord lord hallelujah amen here you are my god they got to move you from the local prison and move you into the main prison what's the first thing they do they shackle you they put on bracelets on you shackles on your feet and there you are in chains of darkness there you are in chains of darkness my goodness and then once you let me say this let me pause here for a moment you know when you're going to enter that prison you empty with fear and dread and apprehension i don't care how bold you are first time you walk up to those prison doors and realize you're going to be in there for a period of time and them doors are going to go clang behind you and there's no hope of getting out you're going to think twice when that happens there amen but when you enter that main door fear and apprehension but when we come and this word opens to us amen we enter his gates with thanksgiving and we give praise to his marvelous and glorious name amen when the word is made known and revealed itself to us praise god hallelujah this is no more prison yard uh association we're talking about the people out there in a big prison yard they're thinking they're having party they're having this exercise yard where they can go and do all the exercise they want to do and feel they're eating organic and they're doing this to keep their physical body devil don't care about your physical body you can get all of that perfect you can look like charles atlas or somebody like that that don't mean nothing to him he's after the capturing of your soul to make you a prisoner amen in his uh his chain of lies and unbelief change your mind change your change when every possible way amen yes sir you're still in a prison yard shamed by your own mind because you know i don't want to go going out you're going to take you know person and they got to give you what they call it orientation in other words they're chaining your mind to how to behave when you're not prison amen and if you don't behave that way you're going to pay the penalty so there you are and your mind chained and then the devil got you chained up with chains of habits amen you're trying to break them chains of the habit and you hardly can break the chains like brother brandon said i couldn't do that i couldn't set them people free but i know from the revelation of the word house of hell it had to give way to the word of god for it was the word that took the rock out of the hands of him that held it amen praise god hallelujah amen my chain a lot of people chain by fear they're hesitant to act on anything chain my friends by revenge chained by lust pornography hatred chained by witchcraft chained by wizardry and psychic mentality and astrology amen and there are others that are just chained by circumstances woman at the whale blind bag timias many others yes brother brandon said we don't know how she got in that state maybe her whole family died and her siblings left and she's the eldest one and he had no way of getting a job or getting anything else and so she made a way to take care of the rest of her family regardless of whether her reputation or whatever had to die but they're gonna live and so she had to make a way now we're not excusing or our way but i'm telling you just what she was in a prison of circumstances a lot of people are caught by the devil in a prison or circumstances they don't know how to get out but i'm here to show you and tell you how to get out you can be set free by the power of the name of jesus christ which is the word of god for his name shall be called the word of god it's the opening of the word that casts out your unbelief and sets you free amen you are free in whom the son of man sets free is free indeed amen amen samson was imprisoned by lust amen some people are imprisoned in our day by the love of money amen in the bible chose us anonymizing sapphira amen now we find nebuchadnezzar was imprisoned by his desire for power sell out the message sell out the word because he wants to have influence wants to be like a politician somebody that power in the city power in the country oh my doesn't make any difference to him he'll back off of that word amen hallelujah all of them belshazza alexander the great now for leon all of them this lust for power amen and push the word of god in the background amen yes my friends surely you can see what i'm talking about amen now we know in the beginning of the bible book of genesis how eve entered into the main gate of the prison true unbelief and there she caused the entire human race to be taken into confinement and we got placed into our individual cells of our body bars of bone they hold my soul but this house of clay is gonna burst wide open when the angel the spirit of god sets my spirit free i'll take my flight like a mighty eagle for the hills of home they're calling me brother branham said one time i went into the zoo and when i looked there was a great golden eagle sitting in a pen just walking up and down walking up and down with his wings all droopy his head all droopy now and again he would look up with them big bright eyes looking up into the heavens because he was an eagle but there he was behind bars oh my friends he said and then i thought of so many of them people christians that are in them churches they're inside of those denominations they're on the bondage he uses the word he said they are prisoners amen hallelujah oh my brother i'll tell you but here we are with the word of god to tell you in the name of jesus christ you are free for whom the son of man sets free you are free indeed come out of her my people not partakers of our plagues amen no he says when that eagle could go free he'll fly up into the heavenlies where he is born for that he predestinated for the heaven that places in christ amen where he can rise up in the name of the lord oh praise god hallelujah there we are amen in our individual cells are you getting what i'm saying and the individual cell you're in is in this flesh body that you're because as i said to you if you're a really lack of god you are not of time you come from eternity you're going back to eternity you're not the flesh you are of the spirit the spirit man was made first the flesh man was only there so he could manifest and do certain things god wanted him to be able to do but the original man was there in the mind of god first amen but here you are in a cell amen and there when you go into the prison sometimes they throw you into a cell with another person is that right i can't say it's not right because you can't afford it but they may throw you in a prison with another person but what if they throw you into that prison and there's another person by the name of cancer you're inside of that cell and mr cancer is sharing the cell with you that prison guard is not going to help you to change who is in that cell with you because the guard himself the prison warden is satan himself but thank god we have a governor amen and the governor's name is jesus christ his name shall be called wonderful counselor mighty god the everlasting father he is the governor amen he got the right to give you a pardon bring you out of that cell i don't care if you have cancer right now you've got some other growth sharing your body along with you it's not supposed to be there talk to the governor talk to the governor talk to jesus christ and ask him to get that person that's sharing yourself with you out of there so that you can walk free and give him glory praise and honor amen for his mighty name [Music] [Applause] kick him out right out of there amen hallelujah amen so you can place whatever thing the devil tried to force on you that you got to share that in your body along with that other thing you don't have to share it you talk to the governor and let him give you a pardon let him cast that person out of there and set you free i hope people are hearing me everywhere that i can be heard i will obey the word of god and receive the the blessing of the lord the freedom the healing the deliverance but mainly the salvation the changing of your soul by the revealing of the word think of it confinement sharing yourself amen listen in the bible there was a man by the name of legion and when jesus asked him what is your name he said my name is legion for we are many that man and you go search and you'll see brother branham tells the story of legion that he was actually a good man but somewhere along the line he starts suffering spells and the devil tried to take advantage of that and start sharing his body amen along with that soul that was in that body and so he had an infestation of demons that had taken over his body but really he didn't know how to be free he ran to every seminary i mean he ran i didn't deliberately do that one but um he ran to every he ran around the cemetery i'm trying to feel for the world where he ran around the cemetery going from tomb to tomb breaking open the graves somehow thinking that how he could be free he was actually searching for deliverance and all the clothing they tried to cover up his sins and cover up all this past and cover up this that giving all kinds of doctrinal fig leaves and whatever bible said he tore him off and threw him away they weren't good enough for him but all praise god once sat alone but then one day what then jesus came hallelujah and set the captive free i want to tell you the word of god is here today and this word of god will set you free if you obey the promise of the world amen not i'm not talking about just the written word but the understanding the revelation of the word for unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom hallelujah amen and you can't even see it or recognize it unless you are back there so that when you you see it now again you now can recognize it because you already saw it you were back there in him before the temptations of the world you're now coming out of your spiritual amnesia you're coming to into perfect realization hallelujah the spirit of the lord hallelujah is doing this amen yes sir how do you oppose that person gonna get out how was legion going to get out house of hell give way satan lose him come out his life i say today in the name of jesus christ amen wherever you are whoever you are satan loose the people come out from the midst of them go out to their bodies come out to their minds come out wherever you are or your dark secret hidden places come out of there and let the clouds of darkness move back and the rising of the sun shine upon them they might see him who is the light and walk in the light as he is in the light amen brother branham saw that regions of the damned he saw those regions of the dam there in hell and i want you to know my friends that he says don't ever go there but thank god as one song talks about life's other side life has another side it's not just hell but there's another side to life and thank god these are regions of the bless you only have to uh you only have to listen him speak about beyond the curtains of time and you'll understand of that realm while the musicians are coming here praise god thank god brother sister we are now at the greatest junction of time and there's a fork in the road now which way to go where are you headed the road goes in a fork heaven or hell which way are you going to go choose this day whom you will serve this is a call from glory it may be to you god's last altar call i don't know people that were young i'm suddenly getting words they've passed away they're gone i'm shocked beyond measure that this is happening but god has promised in this last day that he will call and his true children will answer it's getting later than you think the number is getting fewer so i don't know when that last one will come in i saw in the vision and just a hand reaching out to me crying out you know just hands crying out for salvation redemption for somebody to take the word to them who knows that may be your neighbor maybe a friend it may be a loved one close by you you take for granted every day but let's make sure friends we save them and deliver them from those houses of hell their way solomon describes it he said they're charming look at these beautiful places of worship their ways of worship beautiful lovely charming attractive everything else he said that's that's beautiful perfumes beautiful incense and everything else but her house is the house of hair don't go there for the good man of the house he says solomon said it's not at home the word isn't there it's not there so don't even bother going there stay with the word of god and the word of god will see you through praise be to his marvelous and a wonderful precious name hallelujah god bless you my son my friends wherever you are may god set you completely free and then just testify just uh
