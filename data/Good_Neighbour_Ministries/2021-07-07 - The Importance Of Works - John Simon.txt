TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening france once again we are happy to be together again in the presence of the lord gathered around god's great dining table to feed upon the bread of life may the great holy spirit help us this evening as we look into god's perfect law of liberty glory be to his marvelous and wonderful name now here is another study in the church ages and this subject for tonight will be the importance of works the importance of works now we would like to read from revelation chapter 2 verse 9 and then we'll get started i trust god bless you and kept you and preserved you over the past weekend and shed his grace and light upon you and as we come together again may god's light shine brightly upon us to inspire and empower us as we go forward in his great and mighty name revelation chapter 2 reading verse 9 i know thy works and the tribulation and poverty but the like rich and i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are of the synagogue of satan my how marvelous that is praise the lord and now we go to the age of tayatara from the age of smyrna i know thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first i've just read from revelation 2 9 and revelation 2 19 may the holy spirit place his words exactly where he wants them that we may benefit from it and grow in the grace of god let us pray dear gracious heavenly father we pray that the holy spirit will step aside just for a while lord step out of the the bushes of life that hides you from human sight and come before us in plain view of thy word that we may know your will concerning our lives how to walk and how to live and how to act that we may be children of god praise worthy of our walk with you may all the honor and glory come to you now lord in the name of jesus christ our lord amen and amen as we have just read in the scriptures of revelation 2 9 to 19 god saying i know thy works remember now jesus is speaking standing there before john and he is saying to john i know thy works now just think of it the god of heaven who knows everything who is aware of every sparrow he said there's not a spiral that will fall i don't know about it the the hairs upon your head i know every one of them because they are numbered oh my a god who knows all things omniscient omnipotent a god that is all seeing that knows all things and he is saying none of your works are hidden none of your works are forgotten none of your works are overlooked or brushed aside but i know thy works whether they're good whether they're bad but i know thy works not what you say they are but god is saying i know thy works amen hallelujah i prince this is a marvelous statement because you're saying uh children i know all your actions you're seen and you're unseen known and unknown i know all of your actions in front of people behind people in front of the pastor behind the pastor in front of the saints and away from the saints i know thy works i know your activities i know every one of your actions remember the all-seeing eye of god is always upon us and that should teach us as believers that we should always live lives being conscious of god knowing that he is seeing everything we say and do amen hallelujah and by this god he is implying also i am interested in you and i'm interested in your works i'm interested in whatever you do and i'm so glad that god is interested in what we do and he knows our works praise god hallelujah amen now it is important that we clearly understand that works do not save us let me repeat good works being a good man a good woman a good church member a good person good citizen good works do not save us paying indulgences do not save us paying for masses do not save us paying for any religious uh item does not save us no good works from the human being saves them salvation is of the lord salvation is without money in the book of idea and without the price no price no money he gave himself freely for all and died already for your sins and we do not have to pay anyone for any such things whatsoever for salvation is not of works salvation is not of man salvation is of the lord now we must clearly see that even though it doesn't save us salvation is important to us as christians for it's an important element that comes forth from a saved life a one who knows that their lives have been changed and transformed by the spirit of almighty god matter of fact james chapter 2 verse 17 he says faith without works is dead amen revelation without action is dead salvation not followed up by good works and with good works is dead it's not real salvation if works do not follow a save life or works is very important be expressed to god our gratitude for what he has done bringing us from the my reclaim placing our feet on the rock to stay how marvelous is our god now how important are works it's important because works reveals or manifests the faith that you claim you have you can sing you have faith but your actions speak louder than your voice than your words and therefore your works your actions activities my friends reveals to the entire world amen of the faith that you hold within so it is important that our works follow our faith oh hallelujah works are also important because they are a fruit of the of a saved life a life of one who has been truly born again will bear that marvelous fruit of good works it will naturally flow from them to be kind to be courteous amen to be righteous to be faithful these things will flow from the life of a true believer that has been saved elected changed by the grace of almighty god hallelujah all prince grant your works on the outside of you justifies and tells of the new spirit that you have within you for as the prophet said and your heart will i give them i'll take out the stony heart and i'll give them a heart a new heart amen i'll put in your spirit if it's in them and so your works expresses that new heart this new spirit that lives within you and lets the world know that your your old man or the old way you used to live has passed away and all things have become new you have now become a new creation you have been born again in christ through the divine election you've come to the realization amen of who you really are and you are born again by that revelation that the word of god opens up and reveals to you amen good works important but it does not save you you can pile them up as high as a mountain you can pay millions of dollars you can uh all my friends build all manner of charitable institutions you can place widows and orphans homes old parked homes you can feed the poor the hungry wonderful but good works will not save you good works amen i know your faith and i know your good works because faith is separate from works and revelation comes to you and that produces the life the fruit of the works that now flows out of you naturally the holy spirit begins to work in and through your life amen good works are also important because it inspires faith in him amen when they see your good works our good works the life we live the stances and positions we take the way we conduct ourselves in this world full of filth perversion darkness on every hand and yet we hold our heads high we hold ourselves pure and we walk through this world in in white the righteousness of christ the robe of the bride is the word of god the righteousness of christ no wonder paul said put you on the lord jesus hallelujah amen so we have put on christ and out of him blows all of these wonderful works unto the children of men matter if the bible tells us when you do good works they will see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven o praise god don't you want your father in heaven to be glorified don't you want him to be praised and magnified oh praise god forevermore hallelujah amen good works they're wonderful but they must arise from the correct motive some can do good works to be admired others do good works to be seen my friends others do good works because they think it will save them it will not all my friends good works an expression of the heart of the believer gratitude to god love for him and for what he has done for us when we think about his love when we think about his grace his substitutionary sacrifice when we think that he took our place on calvary oh what else can we do but our time on earth that we spend here we want to spend it working for the lord we want to work till jesus comes we'll want to work until he calls us come up hither and we're called into the presence of god while we are here let's work amen jesus said work while in this day where you don't know when night time it's come in and when night time comes it goes all dark and you cannot work in the night so let's work till jesus comes and let our the holy spirit work the works of god through us that he might bring glory to his marvelous and wonderful name real true works must flow from the correct motives and the correct motive for love for for for good works is the love of god when the love of god so saturates envelops and takes preeminence over your heart you can't help but be one who prays for others who gives who goes you become a helper most of all overall you take on the spirit of servanthood for you have become a prisoner to the word a prisoner of the jesus christ who becomes your lord of all and the word now takes preeminence over your walking you're talking you're living you're acting what you see what you hear the word of god becomes your control center the holy spirit works in your life and he proves through your works that you have crowned him lord of all lord of your life lord jesus i created thee now lord take my life and let it be comfy created lord to thee take my moments and my days let them flow in ceaseless praise oh mare lions be a sweet smelling savor unto god may our lives be the perfume from these flowers of human life which are here today and gone tomorrow as the prophet said you are like the flowers like the grass of the field you're here today and you're gone tomorrow you are like the smoke that can be blown away with the evening breeze so my friends while we are yet alive while we are yet healthy while we still have time let's work till jesus comes again and the bridegroom calls us home let's do what he tells us to do and fulfill the law of christ the word of god hallelujah with the great motive of love hallelujah and to be a servant of the living god prisoner of jesus christ now some years ago i was uh i was just dealing with a situation in which a foreign person had to be picked up dropped off to the hotel had to be taken for meals and such like and in doing so i of course i opened the car door i let them be seated close the car door i gathered their luggage took it place in the back of the vehicle and so on when they're about to have their meal i would move over pull uh have the chair drawn out let them be seated place it back like that and at the end of let's say about a week that person said you're not a real bishop you are not a real you can't be a bishop and i said well no if you see it that way i'm not a bishop and i knew what i was saying because the bible tells us answer a fool according to their folly and then the next time it says answer not a fool according to their paulie so i said well no i'm i'm not a bishop in that way and i let it go at that but i'm telling you this to say that like the pharisees and sadducees in the bible many have created a a visual of what people should expect a bishop a pastor a minister should be and their picture is one that is high and mighty one that is robbed in scarlet purple or uh black and white or whatever colors white green many colors resplendent as a prince of the church all my friends on the contrary jesus said he who would be the greatest let him be servant of all so he's calling his children to a life of service a life of surrender a life of obedience to walk in the light of the world amen my friends to be a real trustworthy servant one first of all have to have the qualities of obedience they must also have the qualities of loyalty they must also have an attitude of faithfulness and they must also have patience of course these are mentioned in the scripture which we read jesus saying i know your faith i know your works i know your patience i know about it so a real servant needs to have this attitude of servanthood oh not the pomposity uh that goes along with quantification my friends but one that would live in humility and then surrender real true humility oh my friends god is calling his children back to the word amen or praise his marvelous name amen oh a servant of god must have patience and we know friends face must be tried to produce patience and that is why these saints of tired torah were being tried by the age in which they lived in by all the persecutions that they had and the trials that came their way and outwardly they appear poor but god is saying you're trying of your faith has made you rich in pensions in faith in works your walk with god has been enriched hallelujah don't you despair don't cry don't be discouraged but hold fast let no man take your crown because i know thy words i know what you are going through and i know your works hallelujah faith mighty faith must be tried to produce patience when faith is tried in the refining fires of god it begins to produce patience and godliness and other virtues within the heart and lives of the believer i'm not saying you must understand me these things are in you by the holy spirit but they have to come out and it takes these trials fiery trials for you to be able to express them and work them on the outside hallelujah because of course patience is one of the virtues and that these virtues are in us my friends unexpressed until the holy spirit through death trails through his own way is able to manifest to us how much patience we have oh praise god the growth the development and maturity of patients within our lives is the character development process that the holy spirit uses to bring about the changes within the hearts and lives of his saints yes all the trials all the mockings you have been going through all the persecutions amen my friends as they increase i want you to know that your character is being further developed and strengthened by the grace of almighty god hallelujah amen to a christian with character trials are not the source of discouragement or of despair but they are real elected believing saint of god sees trials as a great marvelous opportunity for another victory glory to god my friends if there is no trouble how will you wear win a crown if you are not in a contest how can you win a prize no ticket no chance no holy ghost no chance no trail how are you going to develop oh praise god how the cat of christ going to flow through you fear not when you go through the fiery trials for the triumph of your face work at patience that is the work of god working patience in you so the true believer sees triangles as an opportunity for another resounding victory against the world the flesh and the devil so that god may be glorified hallelujah amen also the true believer the overcomer sees trials and tests as another opportunity for another testimony to give glory and praise to god my friends how are you going to have a testimony without the test you got to have tests to have a tasty money amen this death when you overcome them they are investments they are money and god's invisible supreme supernatural bank oh prince god you are setting up your works you're setting up your victories you're sending up your tests because they are investments in the kingdom of almighty god and in the world to come hallelujah amen because his trials are also testifying to the world of god's power and his glory that god is able to keep us as individuals walking the line of his word strength in line with the word in a crooked and perverse generation we are being kept by the power of god through faith in this word of god and so the people see the power and the glory of god expressing itself in yours and my walk amen when we look my friends they can see it so the secret of living in victory is allowing the holy spirit to manifest and produce the works of god within your heart and life amen these saints of taya tyra developed character they developed such a strong character they would not bow their bow to their idols they will not bend they would not change their doctrine from one god to tree they would not burn even though they were persecuted they were given the inquisition they were tortured burnt at the stake for the sunnah oh my friends what did that do it all friends it rebounded on satan because it made them even more fervent and determined to serve the lord and develop christian character even more in them praise god hallelujah i thank god for that thank you a character of love a love that works through faith a love that works through patience amen hallelujah what a wonderful wonderful character of christ to live and move in us remember friends what i'm saying here these saints of thyatira did not just develop good character during good times but they develop their character or they expressed the death of christ or their work out their salvation by the words of god in them they were able to do it more during the hard times you can do it some of it during the good times but hard times tests trials persecutions temptations whatever brings out amen and refines the very cut of christ which is already in you amen hallelujah so it was during the dark ages that the tank of these saints was expressing and it was so outstanding that god had to refer to it said i know your works i know your pensions your faith your loyalty i know what you how you are and what you're doing praise god hallelujah he could see himself being manifest and expressed within the hearts of these believers during this these dark ages the dark ages were edges of potpourri my friends where the pop strength and power of the popes arose the mixture of church and state mixed together oh an earthly combination for earthly victory and they have conquered and they are conquering and they will continue to conquer and create mayhem but that will only go on until the prince of peace comes again oh praise his name and he has promised that he will come again oh blessed be the name of the lord then we shall be able to say peace on earth and good will towards men here we find the developed character during the towns of the popes that developed character during this time of inquisition and persecution you owe your choices your decisions your faith must be firm your decisions must be clear are you a real christian are you not are you walking uh the line of compromise where you can tomorrow you're back in the world the next day you're back in the church you're doing the same things like the people in the world but you want to claim to be a christian just because you maybe have some good uh offerings times indulgences and so on in the church you think that will save you no that will not send you salvation is of the lord election is of the lord this as i said the dark images age of potpourri age of branches of persecution and ages of pornography pornography which is to say the rule of hard luts to be ruled by the spirit of the harlot church amen and this is the time where god speaks cleanly in his word that he i know your works but there's one thing amongst you which i hate that woman jezebel oh he's not talking of just one woman but the spirit of jezebel was operating through the church and that church was sending out by uh by the power of uh what should i say transferring transference of that same attitude and spirit that was upon her as a godless false church false to the word she was giving off that spirit on her daughters who picked up the same attitude live like jezebel act like jezebel's draft like jezebels lie cheat steal and behave like jezebel uncover themselves like jezebel oh my friends that same spirit is still in the world today in the form of a church spirit and at the same time in the church in the form of a spirit of lust in the world and perversion in every possible way oh blessed be the name of the lord amen everyone that loves is born of god worth john 4 7 we're not talking about self-love we'll talk about that another time but we live in an age of of all of this type of thing amen i just held myself back from getting into something there but here we are my brothers and sisters god said i know your works i know your patience i know your service hallelujah amen and here we are doing the work of the lord and working and walking in the service of the lord hallelujah amen praise god your works only shows that you already place your face in him because good works i repeat over and over good works do not serve you but they will come forth from a saved life as a fruit of the holy spirit amen i believe in good works and i believe it truly even if a man is not saved you have to be a good man and still have good works in his life and do the best you can for the glory of god amen oh hallelujah listen as i wind this up i know your love service faith and pensions that you are doing amen god is telling them again don't think that i've forgotten the world will tell you god doesn't care god doesn't know god is even blamed hurricanes come earthquakes come did jesus come and the first thing the devil puts in the minds of the people why did god do that he's not letting them know that he did that he is the author of evil he is the author of sin he is the author of wickedness and he is the chief one that loves to blame the other party from the book of genesis right to the end he will always blame others for his evil that he is doing and have the people hating god blaming god and say god did it god is a good god and only good flows out of god and the devil as a great man of old uh oral roberts said god is a good god and the devil is a bad devil evil flows out of the devil and only goodness flows out of god and here we are people are blaming god for all these things when they should blame the devil and turn their hearts to god and ask him for his great protection and love now the word tayatara has various meanings but amongst them is this meaning meaning continual sacrifice some have taken this to mean we should offer continual masses we should continuously go to mass we should continuously burn candles and incense we should continuously be that way and uh well let's leave that alone but i believe that this is speaking to us of saints continually offering themselves to god as living sacrifice suffices amen offering their service their lives their walk their future their everything to him not that jesus back there but christ in you the hope of glory here today and we offer ourselves to him in a continual sacrifice of our lives our labors to him are true believers of the lord yes surely those believers of that age were the cream of the crop of that particular time amen they were full of the holy ghost if you want to be the cream of god's crop you've got to be full of the holy ghost full of revelation amen full of faith amen glory to god and to recognize that you were created unto good works that's why god created us that we might live unto good works to express his salvation in the form of good works and that we might show forth his praise and honor and glory causing men to give praise and honor and glory to god because they'll say like as they said of jesus no man can do these miracles except god be with him and they'll be able to say of you no one could live righteous clean and good and honest in these crooked wicked perverted times no man can our woman can do that except god be with them and in them oh my brothers and sisters let's live such lies that we will gladly show forth his praise and give our lives that the world may see in us that we are living sacrifices unto the living god and we are bringing forth and showing to the world good works that flows from the spirit of christ who lives and reigns over our hearts and over our lives oh may the lord richly bless you and may you go forth from here saving souls good works praying for the sick good works land hands on the sick expecting signs oneness and miracles good works preaching teaching the word testifying of the grace of god witnessing of the goodness of god good works these are all good works visiting the sick visiting those that are troubled amongst you visiting my friends those that are in prison those that are in the hospital oh helping the needy lifting the fallen good works in every way may the holy spirit lead you grand you direct you and inspire you what to do to express the good works that flows from the life of christ that is within us may the lord's wonderfully bless you lead you and guide you until we come together again sunday morning giving glory and
