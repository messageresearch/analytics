[0:00] [Music]
[0:10] good morning friends
[0:12] it's good to be here again may the lord
[0:16] richly bless us together
[0:19] as we look into the perfect
[0:23] law of liberty
[0:26] our gracious heavenly father
[0:30] in the name of jesus christ
[0:33] we ask your blessing upon
[0:36] this sunday morning service
[0:41] upon every individual that's
[0:44] tuned in watching and
[0:47] listening may they experience
[0:51] the grace of god the love of god
[0:55] the fellowship of the holy spirit
[0:58] take all the praise the honor and the
[1:00] glory
[1:02] for we ask it in the name of our lord
[1:04] jesus
[1:06] amen and amen
[1:09] our scripture for today is
[1:12] found in matthew chapter 6
[1:17] reading verse 5
[1:21] and when thou prayest
[1:26] thou shalt not be as the hypocrites
[1:30] are for
[1:33] they love to pray standing in the
[1:36] synagogues
[1:37] and in the corners of the streets
[1:41] that they may be seen of men
[1:46] verily i say unto you they have
[1:51] their reward
[1:56] praise be to god
[2:00] now this phrase
[2:04] be not as the hypocrites are
[2:08] is mentioned seven times in
[2:12] this particular chapter of
[2:15] matthew six
[2:18] in matthew 23 he uses the term
[2:24] war unto you hypocrites
[2:28] and that my friends
[2:31] is also mentioned several times
[2:35] in the word of god now
[2:38] jesus has come into jerusalem
[2:42] and he has gone into the synagogues
[2:46] and spoken in many open public
[2:50] places and in doing so
[2:54] he warns his followers
[2:58] be not as these
[3:01] hypocrites are referring
[3:04] mainly to the pharisees and sadducees
[3:08] but mainly to the pharisees
[3:14] he was warning his followers
[3:17] his believers against skin
[3:20] deep religion copy cut
[3:24] religion you see
[3:28] jesus describes the pharisees
[3:33] with these revealing words
[3:37] very revealing
[3:40] actually jesus might have been
[3:43] or may have been the very first person
[3:48] to use the word hypocrite
[3:53] in this particular way
[3:57] now this english word hypocrite
[4:01] it originates from the greek word
[4:05] hubocris hupo kritz
[4:09] h u p o
[4:13] k r i t
[4:17] e s now no one else
[4:21] in the entire bible at any time
[4:26] ever used this word but
[4:29] jesus uses the word
[4:33] hypocrites 17
[4:36] times that we know of in
[4:39] the bible and he is the only one
[4:42] that uses this particular word
[4:46] it's taking a commonplace
[4:49] word and uses it
[4:52] with a revealing meaning
[4:57] you see the word hypocrites
[5:00] means actor it means
[5:04] actor or actress
[5:07] literally it means someone
[5:11] performing behind the mask
[5:15] someone that's living
[5:19] behind a mask in other words
[5:23] it means someone that is fake
[5:27] someone that is lacking sincerity
[5:33] someone who has the style
[5:36] and the appearance but they do not have
[5:40] the substance in other words we're
[5:44] talking about
[5:45] a plastic kind of person
[5:49] a person that's putting on or
[5:52] are putting on a a a show
[5:56] or a putting on a drama for the
[6:00] lookers on the the people that are
[6:04] in the world or the people that are
[6:07] round about will see them
[6:12] as a person that is
[6:15] presenting themselves in a way
[6:19] that they really are not
[6:22] now of course if i might pause here for
[6:24] a moment
[6:25] realize that satan is
[6:28] the one of the world's greatest actors
[6:33] inspiration for acting
[6:36] most of it comes from satan
[6:40] for he is the greatest one of the
[6:43] greatest actors of
[6:44] all time and his children
[6:47] also are actors
[6:50] and his associates are also
[6:54] actors acting of course
[6:58] also is a form of deception
[7:01] for satan is the father of deceit and
[7:03] lies
[7:05] and so acting is a form of deception
[7:09] and lying and satan's kingdom
[7:13] is built on the foundation
[7:16] of deceit and lies
[7:20] now such a person that
[7:24] lives under that kind of
[7:27] inspiration that kind of uh
[7:30] inward motivation
[7:33] living for what others will think
[7:37] about them what others will see what
[7:40] others will
[7:41] feel about them such a person is not
[7:44] authentic
[7:45] at all because that person is not
[7:50] really revealing their true
[7:53] nature or their true genuine
[7:57] personality they're living
[8:00] their life behind a mask
[8:06] they present to the world
[8:10] and invented or dramatized
[8:15] and idealized form
[8:18] of their true self
[8:22] as if of course what they're
[8:25] showing to the people what they're
[8:27] showing to the public
[8:30] uh they want the public to believe that
[8:33] that's the real person
[8:36] but we know in reality many
[8:40] people many believers
[8:44] are living their lives behind
[8:47] a religious mask
[8:51] now they'll give insincere
[8:56] emotionally expected
[8:59] and accepted responses
[9:02] and reactions rather than genuine
[9:06] ones that comes from their real self
[9:11] you see they're really actors and
[9:14] they're living as i've said before
[9:16] behind or under a mask
[9:19] and manifesting a tetrical
[9:24] uh you know dramatic performance
[9:28] in their entire lives
[9:33] and now this is where i'm taking
[9:36] uh our text from jesus
[9:40] is warning his people and he is warning
[9:44] his
[9:44] children that they
[9:48] should not live their life
[9:51] behind the mask or
[9:54] masking their true self
[9:59] he warns us as children of the kingdom
[10:02] of heaven
[10:04] that we are not to live under a mask
[10:08] for he says be not
[10:11] as the hypocrites or the actors
[10:15] are let me repeat jesus
[10:18] is warning us as believers as christians
[10:22] and we are to take this warning directly
[10:26] from his lips
[10:27] for they are most essential
[10:30] and important that out of
[10:33] all the groups out of all the people
[10:38] on the planet at the time when he
[10:41] was here he purposely
[10:45] singled out the pharisees
[10:49] for this rebuke woe
[10:52] unto you actors woe unto you
[10:56] hypocrites woe unto you pharisees
[11:00] and then he warns his children be
[11:04] not as the hypocrites
[11:07] or the actors are according to matthew
[11:11] chapter 6
[11:13] verse 25 don't live your life
[11:16] as uh you're an actor on the stage
[11:20] don't live your christianity to
[11:23] to to amuse the people that are around
[11:26] about
[11:28] and then to be rewarded with acclaim
[11:32] with praise with cheers
[11:35] their goals are real christian
[11:39] oh my friends that would just be a life
[11:43] of acting it's a play
[11:47] to many people it's a religious play
[11:51] well the shakespeare say that's
[11:54] all the world is a stage
[11:58] and friends there's a lot of acting
[12:00] that's going on
[12:01] [Music]
[12:03] and not in the theaters either
[12:06] nor in films but we are seeing
[12:10] this acting taking place in
[12:13] real life and that kind of living
[12:17] in real life is full of harm
[12:21] full of evil because it's not a play
[12:26] nor is it a movie
[12:30] you shall not be
[12:34] as the actors the
[12:37] hypocrites are
[12:40] the way they live putting on a constant
[12:44] and continuous act for the
[12:47] benefit of those that are
[12:50] looking on at you
[12:54] trying to live a christian
[12:57] life i want to say
[13:02] take off that mask that is my
[13:06] subject for today take off that
[13:09] mask that you are wearing take off
[13:12] that mask that you have on take on that
[13:16] take off that mask that you have carried
[13:19] for years
[13:20] creating an impression in the mind's eye
[13:25] of persons that you are us living a
[13:28] certain way
[13:30] when in the center of you
[13:33] in the very being of you you know
[13:37] that you are not what you are projecting
[13:41] or presenting to persons who are seeing
[13:44] you
[13:46] you're a deceiver for an actor
[13:49] is a deceiver who causes
[13:53] people to see and believe
[13:57] something that they really are not
[14:01] certainly so i urge you in the
[14:04] name of jesus christ take off
[14:08] your false mask
[14:11] of course actors real actors and
[14:14] actresses
[14:15] in this world they wear
[14:18] masks and when they are finished
[14:22] they take off that mask
[14:25] let me pause here back in the days of
[14:29] the greeks when they
[14:30] had these actors and actresses they
[14:33] literally
[14:34] made mass that they wore
[14:38] and that would be the character that
[14:41] they
[14:42] would represent now
[14:45] in our day the actors and actresses
[14:49] use their real faces
[14:52] but instead of a carved
[14:55] or a painted or a made-up mask
[15:00] they wear what we call makeup
[15:04] the actors wear what we call let me
[15:08] repeat
[15:08] makeup so there's a makeup artist
[15:13] that goes and makes up their face
[15:16] uh with paints with various
[15:20] pencils and pens and and stains and
[15:23] stuff of that nature and even the actor
[15:26] could be
[15:27] a man or a woman that's valued at a
[15:31] million
[15:31] two million ten million twenty million
[15:34] seventy million dollars
[15:36] and a makeup artist
[15:39] can dress him or her up
[15:43] can place certain colors paints
[15:47] powders upon their faces
[15:51] and cause them to go from being a young
[15:54] person
[15:56] to looking like an old down and
[15:59] out decrypted person that's
[16:02] homeless in the street
[16:06] needing your sympathy or your pity
[16:09] and that is all a play
[16:13] they are wearing a mask
[16:17] made with modern day makeup
[16:22] here we see friends
[16:26] men and women wearing masks
[16:30] that are not real
[16:33] of course we know
[16:37] makeup is a form of mask
[16:41] and as we have said actors are the
[16:45] mo the worst deceivers the worst
[16:49] cheats and liars
[16:52] when we look at the the wearing of
[16:55] makeup
[16:56] in our day and in our time it's become
[17:00] something that is acceptable
[17:04] it's become something that everyone
[17:08] uh uh or most everyone uh
[17:11] wears today and even
[17:14] as i'm speaking about it here now
[17:17] some folk will look in that as something
[17:20] strange
[17:22] or something different why would you
[17:25] speak about makeup for it is
[17:28] something normal that men
[17:32] and women wear today but it is not
[17:35] normal
[17:36] for that's not the real person that's
[17:39] not their real face
[17:41] that's not their real eyebrows because
[17:44] they'll shave off their real eyebrows
[17:48] and then turn around and take a
[17:51] pencil and draw an eyebrow
[17:55] with the shape that they like
[17:59] and they will present that set
[18:02] of painted on eyebrows
[18:05] as if it's their real self it's a lie
[18:09] it's a misrepresentation it's a
[18:11] deception
[18:13] we find out and i'm speaking about men
[18:16] and
[18:16] women for men are wearing
[18:19] makeup women are wearing makeup
[18:23] also we find friends
[18:27] that even with their eyelashes
[18:31] their hairs upon their eyes maybe too
[18:34] short and they'll go out and have it
[18:38] made up in other words they'll have it
[18:42] put on false
[18:45] deceiving and lying
[18:49] and placing it there and acting
[18:52] as if that is their real self
[18:55] when it is not we ought to be ourselves
[19:00] and we ought to present our true self
[19:03] and
[19:03] allow persons to judge us
[19:06] the way god has made us oh
[19:10] praise his marvelous and wonderful
[19:14] name we see it my friends everywhere
[19:18] oh they'll put on the matter of fact
[19:21] businesses have been formed out of this
[19:24] makeup
[19:26] businesses have been formed on teaching
[19:30] women how to have better or
[19:33] longer fingernails how to have them with
[19:37] the right
[19:38] color that matches the dress or the
[19:40] blouse
[19:42] that matches their earrings or matches
[19:45] something else
[19:47] they they businesses are formed
[19:51] just for the fact of
[19:54] preparing men and women
[19:57] to be actors
[20:01] hypocrites contrary to the word of god
[20:06] jesus christ himself said to his
[20:08] children
[20:09] be not as the hypocrites are
[20:12] the actors are the pretenders the
[20:15] plastic
[20:16] persons don't be like them be your real
[20:19] self
[20:21] be true to god be true to yourself
[20:26] you are beautiful the way god made you
[20:30] you are beautiful with the natural
[20:33] beauty that god has given to you
[20:36] now i don't want you to make any mistake
[20:39] about this
[20:41] anyone is free to do whatever they want
[20:46] anyone is free to wear whatever they
[20:50] want
[20:51] anyone can go into whichever direction
[20:56] they want but you must also recognize
[20:59] i have the right to express
[21:03] my view as i see it
[21:07] according to this bible and this word of
[21:10] god
[21:12] that such people or persons
[21:16] or so-called christians that do
[21:19] these things are hypocrites
[21:23] going contrary to the word of god
[21:26] and as jesus said be
[21:29] not as the hypocrites or the actors are
[21:33] don't be like the actors are you are
[21:36] not to live a life of acting
[21:39] in my words take off that mask
[21:43] take off the mascara
[21:47] take off the paint
[21:50] take off the false eyebrows
[21:53] take off the false eyelashes then call
[21:57] yourself
[21:58] a christian call yourself a woman of god
[22:02] and man of god and have yourself
[22:05] made up with all sorts of things like
[22:07] that you're nothing but an
[22:09] actor according to the words of jesus
[22:12] himself be not as the hypocrites
[22:16] be not as the actors are
[22:19] for they are contrary to the word of god
[22:23] and they are not of the children
[22:26] of heaven yes
[22:30] if they find themselves
[22:34] that their hair is a certain way
[22:38] and maybe they don't like it the way
[22:41] their hair is they'll
[22:44] change their hair to suit themselves
[22:49] well my friends i don't really care what
[22:51] color what
[22:52] or all along or whatever you do with it
[22:55] that's
[22:55] up to you but i am just telling you
[22:58] what i see in the word
[23:02] of the living god and it's up to you
[23:05] to take account of yourself before
[23:09] the presence of the living god take off
[23:11] that mask
[23:13] take it off and be whatever
[23:16] and whoever god wants you to be he's
[23:19] expressing a a kind of beauty through
[23:23] you that no one else has
[23:26] they will say oh it's not like this
[23:29] person is not like this person
[23:31] it's not like this great person or it's
[23:34] not like this actor
[23:35] or actress whoever they are but my
[23:38] friends you
[23:39] are unique you are individual
[23:42] you are who you are because god
[23:46] made you with a beauty that
[23:49] is your own and none can compare with
[23:53] it let me repeat it the beauty that
[23:56] god has given to you the appearance god
[23:59] has given to you
[24:00] is unique there is no one else like
[24:04] it and you ought to preserve your own
[24:07] self
[24:08] your own beauty by the grace and power
[24:11] of almighty god listen my friends
[24:17] some will feel that their lips are not
[24:21] red enough their lips are not
[24:24] brown enough their lips are not
[24:27] purple enough maybe their lips are not
[24:30] green enough
[24:32] maybe it it doesn't have that right
[24:34] shade of pink
[24:35] there's a huge massive business
[24:39] that satan has set up and has his
[24:42] children to set up
[24:44] that could produce all the paints all
[24:47] the powders
[24:48] all of the lipstick that you can think
[24:52] about
[24:52] to meet the needs of every desire
[24:55] of every person on this planet
[24:59] so that they could present themselves to
[25:02] the world
[25:03] in their capacity as one of those
[25:07] actors which an actor is really a
[25:10] deceiver
[25:13] an actor is presenting yourself through
[25:16] lying you are presenting yourself
[25:21] as someone or somebody
[25:24] who is not what they appear to be
[25:28] we know that men and women today are
[25:30] some of the worst deceivers
[25:33] presenting themselves false
[25:37] everything falls from the top of their
[25:40] head
[25:41] right down to the nails of their toes
[25:43] false
[25:45] absolutely contrary to the word
[25:49] of the living god yes sir
[25:52] go about your real life take off all
[25:56] those masks
[25:57] stop living under a mask and do your own
[26:01] self
[26:01] be true have the real
[26:05] natural color of your face your skin
[26:08] uh have it there because that's the way
[26:11] god
[26:12] made you and god gave it to you that way
[26:15] he knows what kind of beauty you will
[26:19] express by that which he has given you
[26:22] but in other words you looked over the
[26:24] fence you seen
[26:26] somebody else some a good-looking man
[26:30] some uh beautiful woman so-called
[26:34] beautiful woman
[26:35] and so you decide i want to be beautiful
[26:38] or this man i want to be handsome and so
[26:41] you begin to dress yourself up
[26:46] make yourself up and it's a makeup
[26:49] it's a put on it's a copycat
[26:53] it's not real it's nothing but
[26:56] acting and then when you get home
[26:59] at night you have to wipe off
[27:02] the colors you have to wipe off
[27:06] the mascara and make up when you get
[27:08] home
[27:09] you got to take off all that stuff
[27:12] that you claim was real and if they will
[27:15] see you then
[27:17] you'll be a different person that there
[27:19] will be
[27:20] seeing or looking at than the one
[27:23] that they see during the day with all
[27:27] of those gallons of makeup on
[27:30] so much that you could take a a brush
[27:33] and use the paint from
[27:35] some of these people and paint the
[27:39] uh a wall with it my god what a
[27:44] area what a realm we are living in
[27:48] now that's in the realm of natural man
[27:50] and woman
[27:52] now in the realm of institutional
[27:55] and professional life we find out
[27:59] friends
[27:59] that there are men and women trained
[28:03] certified and paid to
[28:06] act out certain roles
[28:09] certain parts they are paid and they
[28:13] call
[28:13] professionals because they were trained
[28:16] to act that part
[28:18] they were trained to be exactly that
[28:22] now we see of course we know that
[28:24] lawyers
[28:25] which is another group that jesus
[28:28] himself
[28:29] singles out in the bible in the word of
[28:32] god
[28:33] not that one can't be a lawyer but to be
[28:37] a lawyer and to be a
[28:38] real christian it's not really easy
[28:43] but we find that lawyers if they are
[28:46] successful lawyers
[28:48] most of the times they have to be very
[28:52] good actors
[28:53] they have to have control over their
[28:56] looks their emotions their presentations
[29:01] of whatever they're presenting to
[29:04] the public scientists
[29:08] are the same various specialists
[29:13] experts so-called in so-called fields
[29:18] doctors are are
[29:21] are actors also they're trained
[29:25] in under certain conditions that they
[29:28] must
[29:28] act in a certain way to cause their
[29:30] patients
[29:31] to feel in a certain way
[29:35] we find professors also
[29:38] are in that and in the courts
[29:43] when there are huge massive lucrative
[29:47] cases
[29:48] we find out many of these so-called
[29:51] experts
[29:52] and specialists are called in
[29:55] and paid huge sums of money to
[29:59] produce a certain result
[30:02] or a certain report and it's so
[30:06] funny to see experts on one side
[30:11] and you have experts on the other side
[30:15] and both sides are believing
[30:18] that they are absolutely right
[30:22] now if this was really true
[30:25] and man were to look at everything in a
[30:29] proper way
[30:30] then every expert would see the same
[30:32] thing
[30:33] they would recognize the same truth but
[30:37] we
[30:37] realize it's all deception and lies and
[30:40] deceit
[30:41] and greed and every other uh
[30:45] emotion and desire hidden underneath
[30:48] there
[30:49] that they will produce a report as they
[30:52] were paid to produce
[30:55] they will produce results
[30:58] that they were paid to reduce and if i
[31:01] were to take that thought
[31:03] over and take it
[31:06] into the religious realm
[31:10] we see as those people were
[31:13] attended their various universities
[31:16] colleges
[31:17] and special uh special
[31:21] universities then my friends they were
[31:24] given
[31:25] their degrees to authenticate and
[31:28] certify that they have
[31:32] this ability to act
[31:35] in this capacity
[31:38] so we see in the religious realm we see
[31:41] the very
[31:42] same thing the church has been
[31:45] taken over by the world the ministry
[31:49] of of the ministers have been taken over
[31:52] by the world individual believers
[31:56] who should be leaving the real life of
[31:59] christ
[32:00] have been taken over by these
[32:04] spirits of these actors whom jesus calls
[32:09] be not as the hypocrites or the actors
[32:13] are for they shall receive
[32:17] their reward from my father
[32:20] which is in heaven
[32:24] so they'll attend the religious school
[32:29] they'll go and study for
[32:33] five ten years in a monastery
[32:37] they'll go my friends
[32:41] into a seminary
[32:45] others will attend a bible college
[32:48] or bible school
[32:52] and receive what is known as formal
[32:57] education in that religious realm
[33:01] formal authentication
[33:04] certification receive
[33:07] a diploma that they have
[33:11] actually arrived at the apex
[33:14] of being able to act
[33:18] in this particular capacity
[33:21] and then they're given their degrees
[33:23] basbds
[33:24] you know dd's or phds
[33:28] whatever to represent
[33:32] that they have received their
[33:36] authentication
[33:38] and that they are allowed to
[33:41] act in this capacity
[33:44] now we know that in both of these realms
[33:48] both religious and institutional
[33:51] that reveals to us that now any
[33:54] testimony
[33:55] of a so-called expert or specialist
[33:59] or specialist preacher or specialist
[34:03] doctor of divinity or specialist
[34:06] doctor of philosophy actually
[34:09] can be bought or sold
[34:12] and paid for and any result
[34:16] to get any result or any report
[34:20] that you want all my friends
[34:25] because they will only say what they
[34:27] were taught
[34:28] or what they were trained to do if they
[34:32] were taught
[34:33] that there were three gods it's not been
[34:36] revealed to them
[34:38] as an individual god didn't speak to
[34:41] them
[34:42] as an individual but they were taught
[34:46] they were trained in this particular
[34:49] church church school university or
[34:52] or bible school that god is
[34:55] three in one and they
[34:58] in turn are certified and authenticated
[35:02] from that seminary or monastery
[35:05] to go forth with that kind
[35:08] of authority and authentication behind
[35:12] them
[35:12] not coming from god but coming from that
[35:16] seminary
[35:17] coming from that particular monastery
[35:20] and they'll grow forth teaching what
[35:23] they
[35:24] were taught and they'll teach a lie
[35:28] believing it's the truth they'll teach
[35:30] one that god is three
[35:33] in one and miraculously
[35:36] he becomes one when we know in the bible
[35:40] itself hero is a the lord thy
[35:44] god as one lord that god is
[35:48] one and one alone he said here i
[35:51] am beside me there is no other
[35:55] and one sat upon the throne amen
[35:58] glory to god one not three but one
[36:01] one god and so here it is friends
[36:05] they teach whatever they were taught
[36:08] they were taught that jesus said
[36:12] baptizing them in the name of father
[36:15] son and of the son and of the holy ghost
[36:19] amen and peter an apostle takes me to
[36:23] god
[36:24] that at least he moved by the holy
[36:26] spirit on the day of pentecost
[36:28] he moved on the revelation and when they
[36:31] asked him
[36:32] men and brethren what shall we do to be
[36:35] saved
[36:37] and peter the so-called first pope
[36:40] answered clearly definitively
[36:44] down through the ages his words remain
[36:47] unchanged
[36:49] repent be baptized
[36:53] in the name of the lord
[36:56] jesus christ and you shall receive the
[37:00] gift
[37:00] of the holy spirit amen for it is unto
[37:04] you and to your children of your
[37:06] children's
[37:06] child children you'll receive this gift
[37:10] of the holy ghost
[37:12] for there is no other name
[37:16] given under heaven whereby we must be
[37:19] saved
[37:20] but the name of jesus christ yes
[37:24] there is only one mediator there is
[37:27] nowhere in the bible you will find
[37:29] there's a media tricks
[37:32] there's only one mediator between god
[37:34] and man
[37:36] and that is jesus christ they will just
[37:39] go out and
[37:41] teach what they have taught with high
[37:44] sounding phrases
[37:46] with a great personality with greater
[37:49] speaking ability like that they'll go
[37:53] out in the world and they'll teach as
[37:57] they were taught
[37:59] that eve at an apple in the garden of
[38:01] eden
[38:02] when your common sense
[38:06] looking at the word of god
[38:10] and using your common sense you'll
[38:13] recognize it was not an
[38:16] apple but that she committed adultery
[38:22] with the serpent who was
[38:26] not a snake at the time or else god
[38:29] would not have to say
[38:30] from today you will now go on your belly
[38:33] he was
[38:33] not on his belly but i will not get into
[38:36] that now
[38:37] but god placed him in that cursed
[38:39] position
[38:40] he cursed the ground he cursed the woman
[38:43] he
[38:43] cursed the serpent oh my my friends it's
[38:47] so
[38:47] clear that it's not appear on the tree
[38:50] it was a pear on the ground and god
[38:53] cursed them in that area when he said
[38:56] from this day you will have pain and
[39:00] conception
[39:01] and so on it's in your bible if you want
[39:04] to take the time
[39:05] and search it out you can search it out
[39:07] in your bible
[39:08] you can ask me you can ask any of the
[39:11] deacons
[39:12] any of the brothers or sisters anywhere
[39:15] in the world
[39:16] that truly sees and believes the word of
[39:18] god
[39:19] and they will point you to the word of
[39:22] that fruit-bearing tree
[39:23] that woman and how the devil was so
[39:27] evil and was used but these
[39:30] so-called modern day preachers
[39:34] acting contrary to the word of god
[39:39] saying and doing what they were trained
[39:42] to do
[39:44] and uh i don't have all the time to deal
[39:48] with this subject
[39:50] as i would like to deal with it but they
[39:54] can go over here
[39:55] be paid in this denomination or over
[39:58] there
[39:59] be paid more in that denomination and
[40:01] they'll say whatever that denomination
[40:04] tells them they believe
[40:06] [Music]
[40:08] they'll report whatever
[40:11] report is necessary to produce well
[40:15] we believe this we believe this we
[40:16] believe that the other fundamentals are
[40:18] this this this this
[40:20] okay i understand that now they are
[40:22] going to produce that fundamental
[40:25] over and over believing it to be
[40:28] their truth that god has revealed to
[40:31] them
[40:33] now this should be something where by
[40:37] revelation paul said he made known to me
[40:40] the mystery
[40:42] jesus said upon this rock i'll build my
[40:45] church and the gates of hell shall not
[40:48] prevail against it
[40:50] but satan has been trying to get the
[40:52] world into the systems of man
[40:56] to set up the way you should think
[40:59] and so he knows the way you are thinking
[41:02] as long as you are in that system
[41:04] or you were in that kind of schooling or
[41:07] you
[41:08] came out with those points of views
[41:12] that he has spewed and spread and
[41:14] spawned
[41:15] throughout his various so-called
[41:19] higher higher schools of learning
[41:22] my friends and you go and receive it
[41:25] there
[41:26] then you begin to speak that back as
[41:29] truth and nothing but it's nothing but
[41:33] a lie and contrary to the word of god
[41:38] now we find out friends that in the days
[41:43] of elijah we realize
[41:47] that elijah confronted
[41:50] all of ahab and jezebel's prophets
[41:54] and any true son and servant of god
[41:57] will confront the prophets
[42:01] of baal the prophets of jezebel
[42:06] ahab's prophets the prophets of the
[42:10] of revelation 13
[42:13] right through 19. yes
[42:17] they'll confront them in the name of the
[42:19] lord with the word of the lord
[42:21] in the name of jesus christ and
[42:24] tell the truth according to this bible
[42:28] and this word of god
[42:31] these false prophets of jezebel
[42:36] and they were false because they act
[42:40] from her
[42:41] table they took her influence
[42:44] upon them they were trained in her
[42:48] school of prophets
[42:50] and all of them were going to say the
[42:54] same thing
[42:55] because they were taught the same thing
[42:59] within that they may place it the
[43:02] different
[43:02] ways and twist it turn it different ways
[43:05] but in actual fact
[43:07] at the bottom of it all there are
[43:10] all saying the very same thing
[43:14] and there my friends when we read in the
[43:18] book of kings chapter 1
[43:20] uh first kings chapter
[43:24] 21. and
[43:26] chapter 22 we read about the murder
[43:31] of nebot and then
[43:34] we read of elijah's prophecy
[43:38] of how ahab would die
[43:41] the way neighbor died the dogs lit
[43:44] neighbors blood and so elijah prophesied
[43:48] ahab when you die the dogs will
[43:52] lick your blood and so we find my
[43:56] friends
[43:58] that elijah died
[44:04] left the scene and it had not happened
[44:09] no doubt many laughed many much
[44:12] because oh elijah is dead he's gone
[44:16] gone up in a fiery chariot well of
[44:18] course if it was today it would be in an
[44:20] automobile on a highway a wreck on the
[44:24] highway
[44:25] or something like that that that that
[44:27] elijah's spirit
[44:28] would be taken up in the presence of god
[44:32] but back then it was horses and chariots
[44:35] that elijah elisha elisha saw
[44:40] now we find out that ahab wanted to go
[44:44] to war
[44:45] elijah is now dead he is now gone from
[44:50] the scene
[44:52] and there is a man of god by the name of
[44:56] michael
[44:59] and after ahab wants to go to war so he
[45:02] said i'm going to go to war but you know
[45:04] i'm going to call uh uh jehoshaphat my
[45:08] other friendly king i know he's a godly
[45:11] man
[45:12] and and let me ask him and they got
[45:15] together
[45:16] and jehoshaphat said well uh
[45:20] ahab said era my 400 prophets
[45:23] every one of them have prophesied every
[45:27] one of them
[45:28] have said we will win the war they had a
[45:31] prophecy
[45:32] of victory but uh
[45:36] something about jehoshaphat he says yeah
[45:39] isn't there just one more is it there
[45:42] just one and well ahab said well
[45:47] there is one his name is mike kaya but
[45:51] he doesn't like me he is always
[45:55] contrary to the rest he is always
[45:59] saying something different he's a he's a
[46:02] spoiled sport
[46:05] you know he's not even a real prophet
[46:08] he doesn't dress like a prophet walk
[46:10] like a prophet talk like a prophet
[46:12] maybe he doesn't have the accreditations
[46:15] affiliations and
[46:16] and stuff like a real prophet but uh
[46:20] if you want to hear him then why not
[46:23] let's listen to him and so they brought
[46:27] in micaiah
[46:28] and asked him what he thought but while
[46:31] the messenger was bringing my kaya
[46:34] the messenger said well my kind they're
[46:36] bringing you in because they want to
[46:37] know if they're going to win this battle
[46:39] well i'll tell you 400 of us have
[46:42] already prophesied
[46:44] they are going to have a great victory
[46:48] so when you get there be wise and say
[46:52] the same thing and that's what is
[46:54] usually expected
[46:56] but michaela being a son and servant of
[46:58] god
[46:59] said listen i can only say
[47:02] what the lord tells me to say what the
[47:05] lord puts in my mouth to say
[47:08] that is what i am going to say glory be
[47:11] to
[47:11] god hallelujah amen friends
[47:15] and so when he stands before
[47:18] the kings and they asked him he said i
[47:22] see israel scattered like sheep
[47:25] having no shepherd in other words
[47:28] i see you losing the battle and
[47:32] israel having to run for their lives and
[47:34] i
[47:35] see you dead i see you
[47:38] dead having no shepherd
[47:42] oh ahab was so mad and there may be some
[47:46] here this morning that maybe he's
[47:47] extremely mad
[47:49] extremely upset at what they have been
[47:52] hearing
[47:52] through this message but take off that
[47:55] mask
[47:56] oh my friends and here it is my friends
[47:59] that right away he says take him and put
[48:02] him in the prison
[48:03] until i get back feed him with bread and
[48:06] water
[48:06] and my cryo turned back as they were
[48:09] taking him and said
[48:10] if you come back god has not spoken to
[48:14] me
[48:15] amen glory to god hallelujah
[48:18] and you know the rest of the story
[48:22] how that israel lost the battle
[48:25] and how ahab was killed
[48:28] and the blood sprayed upon his armor
[48:31] they took him back to samaria and while
[48:34] they were taking off their
[48:36] armor quickly and resting it on the
[48:38] ground
[48:39] while they took off the armor before
[48:41] they can carry him
[48:42] in his robes while they were busy
[48:46] doing that a dog came up and licked the
[48:49] blood
[48:50] off of ahab's armor to fulfill the word
[48:54] of elijah that he had spoken
[48:58] and even so my friends men of
[49:02] god for this hour and for this day
[49:05] can say nothing different than what the
[49:08] prophet of this
[49:09] hour the elijah of this day
[49:12] according to malachi 4 5 has said
[49:16] according to god's word they can say no
[49:19] different
[49:19] of what will be the end of the heart of
[49:22] church
[49:23] what will be the end of those who stay
[49:26] within
[49:26] her system what will be the end
[49:30] of those who prophesy and say only
[49:33] what she has said then they will
[49:36] reach the very end and the very
[49:40] judgment that she has reached that's why
[49:43] god
[49:44] said in the book of revelation come out
[49:46] from the monster my people
[49:48] and be not partakers of her plagues
[49:52] now we know christianity has been
[49:55] invaded and taken over by hordes
[49:59] of these hypocrites hypocrites according
[50:02] to
[50:03] the greek word actors the meaning
[50:06] of that word meaning actors there
[50:10] yes sir hordes of religious actors
[50:14] and hypocrites now living
[50:17] in the church in a modern day
[50:20] playhouse and
[50:24] my friends we see
[50:28] even in the church the marriage
[50:31] game the marriage relationship
[50:35] which should be something real and
[50:37] sacred
[50:39] it has become the mating game
[50:42] where they dance around each other
[50:46] seeing who could craft a more crafty
[50:49] scheming uh you know
[50:52] marriage marriage agreement
[50:56] so they can have a a real so called
[50:59] marriage and so the mating game is
[51:02] played today
[51:04] no more that till death do us part
[51:08] and what god has joined together let
[51:12] no one set asunder that has become so
[51:15] shallow so cheap that's become all these
[51:19] hundreds and thousands of weddings have
[51:21] become that a
[51:22] cheap representation of god's original
[51:26] intention
[51:27] within his words when we look in the
[51:30] churches
[51:32] they're filled with religious drama
[51:36] even the platforms made in such a way to
[51:38] produce religious
[51:40] dramas the people live a life
[51:43] of religious drama we find out that the
[51:48] preachers
[51:49] have become actors they know just when
[51:52] to gesture
[51:54] they know when to have that photogenic
[51:58] look they know exactly
[52:02] all the various arts
[52:05] and they participate in the arts
[52:09] of counseling in the arts of acting in
[52:12] the arts
[52:13] of speaking in the arts of sermon
[52:16] preparation and
[52:17] this and that and all manner of various
[52:20] sciences that they have actually studied
[52:24] oh my but they are nothing but
[52:28] hypocrites actors
[52:31] copycats put on they'll see a preacher
[52:35] that's been anointed and used of god and
[52:38] they'll go
[52:39] out and try to copycat that
[52:43] and like ahab's magicians there maybe
[52:46] we'll get so close to it
[52:47] have a few miracles but nothing to
[52:51] compare
[52:52] with the life and ministry of a
[52:55] man of god anointed and sent by
[52:58] god upon this earth to perform his
[53:00] divine will
[53:03] so we are presented
[53:07] with pretenders and imposters
[53:12] man today that are put ons
[53:15] they're in it for the
[53:18] reports they can give the money they can
[53:21] make
[53:21] the pay they can receive the wonderful
[53:24] status
[53:25] that they claim they can have the cheers
[53:28] they can have
[53:29] of the world and the praise of the world
[53:33] they they all of the recognition
[53:36] that they can get from the world the
[53:39] books they can write the
[53:41] the songs they can sing and and the
[53:44] various things
[53:45] they can receive but all my friends
[53:49] it's so bad that these preachers and
[53:52] teachers
[53:53] pass that down onto the so-called
[53:56] believers who produce
[53:59] nothing but a dramatized and studied
[54:03] form of christianity
[54:06] they they must think of how they have
[54:08] got to act under this situation
[54:11] i need to act this way under this
[54:13] situation i need to act this way
[54:15] i need to be patient now because this
[54:18] person is doing this
[54:20] or they're saying that i'm a christian
[54:22] so i can't become angry
[54:24] and you see their entire life is one of
[54:27] stress
[54:27] and pressure lest they be found out
[54:30] from their hypocrites action their
[54:33] acting
[54:34] and their way of living and so we find
[54:38] these believers
[54:39] are taught how to produce religious
[54:42] acting
[54:44] they're taught how to be a christian
[54:50] and how to produce a life according to
[54:54] the standards and guidelines
[54:56] given to them by the various
[54:59] fundamentals of their particular
[55:02] church system and that is why you see a
[55:04] baptism look like a baptist because they
[55:06] all taught the same thing
[55:08] a methodist would look like a methodist
[55:10] because they all taught the same thing
[55:11] a catholic will look like a cat because
[55:13] they're all taught the same thing
[55:15] and so on and so on they all taught
[55:18] their
[55:18] various church doctrines and teachings
[55:22] and whatever they say is to espouse that
[55:25] it's to grow that
[55:26] their cross land and sea to to make
[55:29] another one
[55:30] see it the way they see it according
[55:33] to their view of the bible
[55:36] so they're given these bible scripts
[55:41] according to bible teachers and bible
[55:44] studies
[55:45] and then they'll try to live up to that
[55:49] but listen friends the true seed of god
[55:52] is not like that
[55:55] the true seed of god listens to the word
[55:58] of jesus
[55:59] when he said seek not what you shall see
[56:02] or do
[56:03] when you are brought before judges and
[56:06] kings and
[56:06] governors are into high places don't you
[56:09] worry about it for my
[56:11] father that dwells in you he will speak
[56:15] through you he will be the one that will
[56:17] do the works
[56:18] or praise god now that is god
[56:22] living his life through the believer
[56:25] it's god living his life they don't have
[56:28] to put on a mask because
[56:30] god lives and speaks and
[56:33] moves and have his being true and
[56:37] in them they are a living manifestation
[56:41] of the very personality and presence
[56:45] of the living god hallelujah children of
[56:48] the living god
[56:50] not carried away led by
[56:53] their denominational religious teachings
[56:58] sons and daughters of god are led
[57:01] by the spirit of almighty god
[57:05] and as the bible says the wind blows
[57:07] where it listed
[57:09] and no man knows or where it goes
[57:13] so is everyone that is led
[57:16] by the spirit who has seen the wind
[57:19] you have seen the effects but who has
[57:21] seen the wind
[57:23] my friends that is what revelation
[57:26] does in the life of a true believer
[57:29] the devil cannot trace you the devil
[57:32] cannot follow
[57:33] what next you're going to do what next
[57:36] you're going to say
[57:38] how you're going to act under certain
[57:39] conditions he
[57:41] does not know because you are walking
[57:44] moving
[57:45] and acting by the blessed holy
[57:48] spirit praise god hallelujah aren't you
[57:51] happy for the holy spirit
[57:53] in your life and in your walk praise
[57:56] god hallelujah my friends
[57:59] i think of all these people whether
[58:02] they're being churches
[58:05] whether they're being their individual
[58:07] life
[58:08] but they have been living a life
[58:12] of constant acting asking for their
[58:15] neighbors acting for their friends
[58:17] acting for their family putting on a
[58:20] front
[58:20] painting up a front doing something
[58:23] contrary to the will and the word of god
[58:27] now jesus totally taught against any
[58:30] form of acting
[58:32] and we know as i've said before that
[58:35] satan is one of the greatest actors
[58:38] and thus a deceiver and liar
[58:42] and his children and his associates
[58:46] also will be that way
[58:49] and most modern day christianity is made
[58:52] up of
[58:53] lots of religious acting and religious
[58:57] drama rather than the real life
[59:00] of jesus christ expressing itself
[59:04] in and through the individual
[59:08] the children of heaven have been worn by
[59:10] jesus christ himself
[59:12] be not as the hypocrites
[59:16] the hypocrites the actors
[59:19] the pretenders the plastic christians
[59:23] the put on christians
[59:25] are don't ever be a religious
[59:28] actor who consciously
[59:32] or unconsciously act out the things that
[59:36] were just taught to you
[59:37] rather than seeing it receiving it by
[59:40] revelation
[59:41] and the holy spirit i encourage you my
[59:44] friends
[59:45] be yourself in christ
[59:49] to do that take off that mask
[59:52] if you are at this time you have been
[59:55] wearing a religious mask
[59:57] whether in the message out the message
[59:59] wherever you are
[1:00:00] take off your mask you don't have to
[1:00:03] live up to
[1:00:04] people's uh you know opinions
[1:00:08] but just live the normal life
[1:00:12] let your good and let your evil be
[1:00:15] openly seen and recognize
[1:00:19] god will forgive you ask for forgiveness
[1:00:22] and if there are real friends and
[1:00:24] brethren around you
[1:00:25] they'll know how to pray for you that
[1:00:28] god will
[1:00:29] bless you and use you amen
[1:00:32] live like real sons and daughters of the
[1:00:36] living god

[1:00:45] that front amen take it off
[1:00:49] if you've been wearing it and surrender
[1:00:53] your all surrender your life
[1:00:55] [Music]
