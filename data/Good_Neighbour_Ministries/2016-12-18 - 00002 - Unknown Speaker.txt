========================================
have the supernatural element operating in it it's not in the church it's a large is that right it's a large God has to vindicate the promise of the hour and of the day praise the Lord hallelujah that's the way it is so we've got to Humble ourselves what we try to do as as soon as God gives us a little sh of Blessings Now listen to this because this can apply to the message that we are following amen he spoke this back there and now listen to it what we try to do is as soon as God gives us shower a little Showers of Blessings we try to twist it all up then we try to start getting dignitaries Among Us in there and start going to make themselves great [Music] big then they try to begin to outdo one another and then this one starts this way and the other one starts that way they're trying to make themselves differentiated from the other one to stand out then God leaves the whole thing what we need today is a fresh outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon their hearts that are humble that's right that's right we need another real Christmas birthday for today you should realize that you are nothing but a stable down here is that right that's right we are nothing but the staes of today amen where he has come back to be born in us and if you are stable why aren't you stable if you're a stable you have to be stable not shaky and bouncing all around everything else but you should be stable balance in the word of the Living God hallelujah remember he didn't go up to Jerusalem sh around Gilead he come to a stable that he knew was polluted amen realize in yourself that you are nothing but a sing stable can you say Amen I said I'm nothing but a stinking stable amen we living for this season in sinful flesh and the pro the Bible tells us that even though you're a Christian the thoughts of man are continuously evil you got to pull yourself back pull your thoughts back all every hour of the day you got to pull yourself back because the pull of the flesh against the spirit Paul said there's a war going inside of every one of us one one mind tells you this next mind said no the one says go ahead go ahead the next one says no he said this constant war is going on but this war is not End Amen praise the Lord because it's the one that you feed that's going to end this war see you got to realize that you're not to s in stable then open up your doors Hallelujah and when them big places and then in are turning him away open up your door of the nature of your heart and let that Jehovah the Savior come in then watch what takes place amen praise God hallelujah you want to be joining that uh let me say it this way that In Crowd right all these people uh from the in uh in that In Crowd they're throwing you out to go and join a prestigious denomination that has a name that has everything tailored to the point they got everything tailored every form every everything is printed beautifully certificates and awards and ribbons and everything they got their system so scientifically well set they know how to move you from stage one to stage two stage three stage four they know how to move you right through they literally have a science to it amen yes sir and that will put you in the In Crowd but then he was they kicked him out of the in he was kicked out of that kind of a crowd brother sister amen see and so them great big places and them in are turning him away but open up the doors of the major your heart and let the Savior live amen hallelujah the Lord will provide Jehovah Hallelujah the Lord will provide there was no room at for the Savior with but Joseph and Mary had no place to stay Jehovah Hallelujah the Lord will provide jeh Hallelujah the Lord Lord will provide the foxes have a home and the birds have a mest but the son of man he don't know where to lay his sweet head Hallelujah the Lord will provide Jehovah Hallelujah the Lord will God has provided himself a sacrifice God has provided himself a predestinated people God has provided humble simple hearts in which he can dwell one of the prophets said I make thy altars to be my Nest oh Lord just like The Sparrows have made your altar their nest so I made your altar my nest David turns around and says I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen that's where I want to dwell in the house of the Lord forever and ever praise the Lord I want to wind begin to wind this up now um for tonight so far we know of course that there is meanings in words and in names right the word Bethlehem Beth means House El means god and elim means bread so bethle Bethlehem means the house of God's bread right so we know that Abraham's name had to be changed Sarah had to be changed Saul had to be changed to Paul and Simon had to be changed to Peter see all these things have meanings praise the name of the Lord so think of it that he who was the bread of life would be born where in bethleem the house of God's bread where do you get bread bread comes from the B is that right that's where it comes sowh else could he be born he had to be born in Bethlehem it was the bread center of the then then known world but it's fitting now that now he is born at the bread Center of eternal life praise God hallelujah he is our bread of life for the journey amen Israel had bread that came out of the skies for their Journey as they Journey from Egypt to their promis land bread rained down nightly and daily from the sky God gave us the bread of life for our journey to come to his Bethlehem God's house of bread he come to where his name was his house of bread they receive fresh bread every night coming down from heaven for their Journey but Christ today amen the revealed word of course amen is our uh is our bread of life and every day we are receiving freshness from that from Heaven the Holy Spirit himself coming down upon the believer revealing what the word fresh bread for every day for your life's journey yesterday's experience many of us live on yesterday's experience we must do that fresh experience every day a fresh Revelation you know what you can read this scripture the same scripture I just read to you today and tomorrow you decide to take up the same scripture and if for a thousand years you're still here you read the same scripture you can get another Revelation on top of that Revelation on top of that Revelation for a thousand more years and still not come the depths of that one scripture for that part that's is God part of God is that right the prop said all Revelation is comound it just keeps unfolding and unfolding all the time like that see but the denominations they are living off the experience of John Wesley you must not live in the past they were living upon the experience of Dwight Moody spinny sanki KN looking back at Calvin many of those back there they are living on that experience but remember the breath that fell and then after after it fell they tried to keep it over after a while that bread that come from God God contaminated Mups in it we talk the message now right here I'm just trying to show you what's going on right now they're trying to preserve the anointing that was on Malachi 45 that served its purpose and fresh bre is coming down now now remember it's not going to or some new Fantastic Revelation because every Prophet come and confirm the one before before before and they have to say what was said before is that right but it's coming down fresh from God out the heaven is that right so that's what we're looking at here remember that bread that fell they tried to keep it and preserve it over but it got contaminated Ms got into it Wile got into it that's what's the matter tell today we are trying to live on contaminated uh bread or bread on the past that was that is contaminated you must have something today fresh from Christ amen you must have his word today for this hour amen for he is the freshness Upon Our bread that falls down down everything from Heaven upon every believer he is your Bethlehem and just like the natural bread is the staff of Life Jesus Christ is God's staff of eternal life that comes down upon you every day amen see something had to die so you can eat you can live the better devil have to die you have to cut it down said the cow had to die so you can get the meat he says it's just a time that Christ had to die so that we all could live he died that we could live eternally something died naturally so you can sustain your life naturally something had to die that's Eternal not die Eternal but something that's Eternal had to die so you could have eternal life amen praise the Lord and so that you can live eternally amen so that's the way it is then every one of True Believers in Christ is born in Christ when they are born in Christ they are born in God's Bethlehem right here you can be born again in God's Bethlehem God's house of bread amen but the spirit reveals it the word shows it it's the manifestation of God God's word that we have life through Jesus Christ and him alone here in the lesson for tonight I trust that you will dwell in the house of God's bread forever and ever amen praise the Lord amen bu in Christ in the world said God is not going to judge the World by any church doctrine that they print up in the booklet says God is going to judge the World by his own word is that right Hallelujah and all that are in Christ will God bring with him who is Christ Christ is the word John one one in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh is that right he came to his own receive him not but as many as receive him then gave he the power to become the sons of God and all that are in Christ will God bring with him that's why he said bury me in Christ bury me in the word let me put my mind and bury my head in this book this Bible let me bury my mind in the Tes let me bury my thoughts in the word of God hallelujah because when he comes he'll raise me up he'll raise you up if you do the same thing let us bow our hands in pray our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your word tonight most of all you know what we we thank you for we thank you that you gave us the Key of David we thank you that you opened up our understanding that in Simplicity and humility we can receive the word of God for this hour if we had no eyes of the heart to see if you have not anointed our ears the hears for blessed is the man whom I choose we couldn't hear it we just he the Bible being quoted we just hear the written word and we feel religious but we still wouldn't know but because you open our eyes you open our ears and you open our hearts we can recognize fully the impact and the potentials locked in the word of God and now father let me now commit myself to Burying my life my time my thoughts my mind saturated with the word until it's coming out of my ears till it's pouring out of my pores oh God until even unconsciously the action of the word come and
