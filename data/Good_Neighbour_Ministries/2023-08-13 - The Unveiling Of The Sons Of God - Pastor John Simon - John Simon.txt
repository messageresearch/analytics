bottom of my heart may God bless every single one of you and I really do appreciate it not in word only but from the bottom of my heart God bless you uh we have the passing our brothers will announce

in and out and back and so on and soon I'll be gone for a little while and so we understand that but anyway we are here today amen we are not here for devotions we are here for celebrations we're here to praise God we're here to magnify his name as the song said I don't know what you came for but I come here to praise God is that right praise the Lord so we come to enter into this course with Thanksgiving we want to come with praise into the house of the Living God we are not done and out but we are a people that are looking up and we are going out of here very soon too praise the lord well not to delay you I want to get into the word of God um for today and pray that God will bless us uh I'd like to read for a scripture which they can put up behind me while I'm just talking here Romans 8. verses 18 to 23. if you have your Bible you can find it or you can read it right there before you okay Romans 8. or I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who had subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the sons of the children of God amen for we know that the whole creation grown it and travail it in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our body praise the name of the Lord God bless the word my key verse here is verse 19. which um I'd like to read you from the Amplified version for the whole creation which expectantly for the sons of God to be made known waiting for the revealing the disclosing of the sons of God Amen now when it says sons of God you we were reading the scripture It also says children of God when it says sons of God it means children of God okay so there it is uh waiting so my subject or topic for today is not the unveiling of God but the unveiling of the sons of God the unveiling of the sons of God let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for Thy Word but Thy word as we know written upon the page Lord can be understood by just the human mind and knowing grammar English and syntax and so on Lord but we thank you for this that we even have that natural knowledge but we're asking Lord that you will come and walk up on the waters once again that the word that we have read we have heard for so long will come to life before us not imaginary life but real life oh God may your presence Circle and swirl and move amongst us made a great Pillar of Fire of the Living God live among his people and shine above us father the pillar of cloud by day and a fire by night your name be glorified here today as we commit ourselves to you in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you is preceded we welcome you here in the house of the Lord and most of all into the presence of almighty God see what I want to talk about and what I want to show you is how uh that the whole creation all creation especially at this particular time amen is in a condition of birth pains for the whole creation groans and it's in the birth pains to for a delivery it has to deliver something uh it has the whole world is now in that pain and it's in that chaos and that pain and chaotic condition uh because it has to bring forth something and what I'm saying to you is that I believe the times that we are going through and experiencing now is because the entire universe recognizes that this is the hour of the unveiling of the sons of God and the season now according to the scripture that we just read Paul and all those Believers back there he was speaking of this as something coming in the future that this manifestation or unveiling of these children of God was an event in their minds that was yet to come that's what they were looking for but we understand now that uh time has passed church history has moved on we have come through the seven Church ages we have come to the end of the last Church age and now I'm I believe and I'm saying to you we are now in that season when the grain has ripened and the sons of God are coming into a spiritual maturity that's never seen before and it's now being made known and revealed to the world that the world may recognize them not by sayings wonders and miracles not by Town's interpretation of tongues and all those gifts which I've experienced but the point of it is God wants to reveal himself his person his personality and to display his virtues of his life through his sons and daughters Hallelujah that they become many uh trees of life that has the fruits of righteousness and the sweet fruits of his coming Glory moving and shining through them living for him and for him alone they have none other amen I believe a great song what was a song uh some time ago about the Iowa stand for the lamb what was that song I'll just stand for the lamb I'll I'll be faithful to the Lamb on the whole to the lamb amen praise God because he is the one that died for us amen praise God forevermore hallelujah amen but you understand why Paul spoke of it as a future event he was in the first church age we are now in the last uh Church age which spiritually has ended but time is marching on but really we understand where we come from and this was given to us because of the opening of the seals we understand that we come from the womb of God the mind of God where we had the true Immaculate Conception where we were conceived in his mind we are thoughts that were conceived in the mind of God and God after a while knowing that we were there in this mind of course let me slow down a bit here we were him in the mind of God because while you or I are yet thinking nobody knows your thoughts because your thoughts then are in a state of a mystery right your your thoughts are in the state of a mystery so we were in the minds of God and we were hid in this mind and we if we are part of that brain we are the mystery of God that was hid from Satan with which Paul spoke about when he said if the princes of this world knew amen hid for ages and times it was hid from them they could not recognize that we are serving a God that already had a plan I said we serve a God who already had a plan and we were and are a part of his plan do you believe that and so we were here in the mind of God and it was all a mystery because as his thoughts were conceived as or as he conceived his thoughts we see my friends that the time came when those thoughts would have to be manifested or bursted or come to uh visibility recognition uh people will be able to see them know them they may not recognize them at first of who they really are uh but they may not even recognize themselves and who they really are but God promised in the last day that he would let them know by the opening of his word and the people that come to know their God will do exploits because they know their God hallelujah amen and God of course is the word praise the Lord now we know just like in the natural birth and I'm doing a little bit of recapping here but at the same time you must hear the word of God in a natural birth time of conception it's really a time of Mystery because now the child being now conceived is hid and his head where in the mother's womb it's hit there unseen unknown uh people may know something's going on but they don't know what's really happening what kind of child is going to be born what's going to take place that child remains a mystery right there in a head in the mother's womb then comes the time of manifestation or birth when they come to be seen unknown they get to be seen and they come to be known that is the same thing happening with the Sons and Daughters of God in the hour in which we are living right now where God is making his children known to the visible world Amen and let the world know that you are your father's child I said you are your father's child I thank God I am my father's child amen God is my father amen and he has wealth Untold amen praise God and I'm a child of the King and I give him glory and praise and honor for that because that's his word amen praise the Lord amen glory to God now I I touched on this from another perspective um you'll see I'm bringing it three ways one the womb the mind of God hidden the mind of God secondly naturally to illustrate it we were hid in our mother's womb we were hit there we were a mystery until we were born and become visible and known and then God also now wanting to still as we begin to come into manifestation to keep us there he hid us in the Church womb or the womb of the church world okay among the masses of church members masses and masses of church members millions of people claiming to be Christians God hid his elected ones in the midst of that mass he's just hit them in there you've heard the terms the Baptists have used it one in a million million more in 44 or 84 and stuff like that but you see it's really that was really foretelling and predicting how God many are going to be called to come into Christianity but few are chosen right and many comes into the net which Jesus spoke about them A wise man throws his net in the sea and he gathers in and then when he gathers in then he turns around and he throws away the frogs gets rid of the snakes gets rid of the crabs and all those things and what does he do then he takes the rainbow trout he takes that the salmon he takes that in Praise the Lord that's what God has done and what God is doing right now now some of you sitting right here before me just so I'm just pausing for a while you may have recognized even when you were young you did not have an explanation you don't know why you were different sometimes you're by yourself I don't know about you but I can tell you about myself I always knew I I put it this way I used to put it this way in my own way what's wrong with me why can't I be like these other guys but why can't I just be as as they say normal like these people and just do anything I want and whatever there was something holding me and if you are that kind of a person there was something holding you in the middle of all that you might have uh experience all that might have transpired in your life there was a hand guiding you there was a hand guiding you all the way in an eye that was watching over you every step of the way amen because you being one of his own God had his guiding hand his protective care and his love to surround you at all times no matter what you have gone through he brought you through to this day and to this hour thanks be to God amen thank God he had a plan and God has a plan and which we call the Plan of Redemption right the Plan of Redemption now this God's Plan of Redemption as you know uh or should know it was hidden in the seven dispensations of time according to theologians and men that know the Bible that time was broken up into seven dispensations starting with the dispensation of Innocence we don't want to talk about before that right but now the dispensation of innocence and that's the time of Adam and Eve when they live in absolute innocence they're not aware of nothing else but being just innocent child until sin came into the world to make them self-conscious and aware okay so sin now from the ad from the time of Adam to the millennial Kingdom of Jesus Christ is seven dispensations of time right now I won't go over them now but you can find that and you can understand what they are now so we find out now that's what God hid in these seven dispensations and there was a dispensation which we are in called the dispensation of Grace and it's here because the Jews knew nothing about the dispensation of Grace all they knew about the Skilling Rams and lambs and doves and and uh and uh making their sacrifices but they did not know that there was a time coming where the Gentiles would be actually brought into the kingdom of God and that there will be absolute and total freedom no more law but now Grace no more bondage but Liberty amen you are brought in by the grace of God by the power of almighty God and the Holy Spirit of the Living God moving within our hearts and lives amen so they did not recognize it you can read that in the Epistles where Paul said well they were blinded for our sake amen and he uses various analogies and so on about us being grafted in and so on yes but they were not allowed to see it because God had a plan and he wanted no one to know his plan until he was ready to reveal it or to make it known so it was hid from them and they were not aware of it and so those are precious Jewish brothers because we know that their blindness is only for a Time it's only for a season as Paul said they were blinded for our sakes right and that's only for a certain period of time we know out of them will come to 144 000 we know and so on Amen but the point of it is right now the the law of Moses the traditions of the elders the talmuds and so on that stands as a veil that hides the fullness of the word for away from their eyes and they can't fully recognize it it's not that they're not smart people you know they are some of the smartest people intellectually and so on you know that so it's not an intellectuals but the fact is it doesn't matter how intellectual you are if God wants to hide something from you you can't know it it's hidden and as simple as that right so there it is so God hid it from them but that time is coming when the dispensation the gentle dispensations will come to an end and the Jewish people will have to come into power they will come into recognition and power Hallelujah because the sun rose in the East set in the west and it's going back East again amen and saw the light of God will rise and shine upon the nation of Israel once again praise God hallelujah amen and I'm looking forward to that though I don't believe I'll be here amen praise the Lord hallelujah so they knew about the law but they had no revelation about the age of Grace and that in that age of Grace there would be hidden seven Church ages and there was hidden seven Church ages during that age of Grace and now we find out in this age of Grace wonderful Christians marvelous women and men of God dedicated people who whose their lives used for the glory of God Amen all wonderful people and I'll tell you because I've met some of them I know some of them and marvelous wonderful people but uh you see it was not their age so God doesn't make things known before the time he lets you know when it's time for you to know amen so so here it is my friends that they were wonderful but they knew nothing about the Seven Seals they might have read it in the Bible they heard about it but they don't know what it was but God has already promised according to Malachi 4 5 that he would send unto us a prophet in this last day now they don't want to believe that but the fact is every prophet in the Bible has been Jewish and the Gentiles coming on the scene God sent a gentile prophet and that Gentile Prophet with a name that we know brother William Marion Branham now just as it was all through the centuries but Hebrews 11 will tell you all the prophets persecuted maltreated called all kinds of names they'll kill them they'll bury them centuries later they find out they were right and they dig them up and try to give them a great name but they already who they are they don't care about those things they just want to do the will of God you see when they were standing there and and saying oh I see a highway I see chariots moving faster than horses and they have some big bright eyes shining they told them they were mad but they were seeing the cars that we have today and they didn't know how to describe that or when another one says and I see him bringing Israel Back On Eagle's Wings well the biggest bird was an eagle and a plane when they see a plane how they're going to describe something that was never seen so they call it a a great big eagle bringing back the people back to their land amen they tell them they're crazy they're mad you know I talk Mandarin names and that's the same thing it goes right to this day that we are living any yeah that we are living in any body that is there uh working Between Heaven and Earth working between God and man when the Holy Spirit takes a man and begins to use him for his glory and honor he is looked upon in the same way that's why Jesus said if they persecuted me they'll persecute you also amen why he had his years my friends of popularity he had yes of preparation here in the wilderness he has his years of popularity or the young Rabbi the healing the Miracles the signs the Wonders and so on but when he begins to preach to speak the word by saying I and my father are one now they don't want to hear that oh before Abraham was I am oh no no you being a man make yourself God who are you and you see it created that atmosphere every time it does that if you begin to preach to the people in the church tell them oh there's a whole lot of love in here we have to love one another and preach all this chocolaty type of substance uh you know and you know feed them every day with a slice of bread and chicken soup made from the shadow of a skinny chicken and they're shouting and they're rejoicing they're happy to get such a meal and oh man well you see but the moment you get down to it says no the word says so the word says this the word says that and the word directs us to live a certain way to walk a certain way no they don't want to hear that they want their own way they want to go what they want to do and then then the resplendent uh you know Prince of the church will tell them oh no don't you worry with that you know those were the old times these new times he forgot that the word God does not change we serve a God that don't lie a God that don't change amen he remains Supreme forevermore one God Everlasting Eternal praise God in the heavens and the Earth amen yes sir so we see the Seven Seals have to be revealed in this age and in this time and said God sent the prophet and the prophet brought the word and the Seven Seals have been opened up to us praise God and now we know friends that this the mighty ones of power of the air I'm talking about the devil and his princes in the parts of the air they had no idea my friends that the coming of Christ was hid in the last seal in the seventh seal if you look at all I've been saying here is just seven seven seven seven seven seven seven dispensations uh seventh one with age of Grace seven seven seals comes out of that you know an unfolding seven seven seven full unfolding from the other one and now in this seventh Church age a several seal opens up and what is it the mystery coming of Christ when you promise I'll come as a thief in the night not like they're expecting one morning they'll wake up because I remember when we were young and we heard the word and we were so happy there was one sister there jumped in the morning she was living near the army camp and you know they have the they would wake up all the soldiers he jumped out to bed oh praise God Jesus I'm coming her mother says go back to bed Phyllis that's the that's the army camp and that wasn't Gabriel blowing any trumpet see that's how they imagine it's going to be they don't realize that that trumpet voice that Trumpet of the word of God is blasting forth now they don't understand that the revelation of the word is going forth now they're looking for their human expectation for something for their ears their eyes and their feelings to to register that is happening but it's happening in God's Own mysterious way amen hallelujah and it's going forth upon the people now praise the Lord so we thank him and praise him for the understanding praise the Lord so he promised he would come as a thief in the night how many knows that Amen on it this night spiritual it is night and we don't want to go to all these scriptures Palestine shall come things will wax worse and worse there'll be Wars rumors of wars earthquakes or it's all there in the Bible you must read your Bible you know that every Christian ought to read their Bible and pray every day is that right if you're not reading your Bible you're not praying every day then uh and you're suffering from spiritual malnutrition and all kinds of uh spiritual birth defects come start coming up in your life then you've got to realize you're not feasting on the word you're not listening to the word you're not reading the word you're not praying you're not talking to God hallelujah amen yes sir Lord of God so he has come now and in the middle of this little decent night that we are in and it's so dark we are almost in a state of spiritual blackout not almost we are in spiritual blackout as as we were as it was back in Egypt's land when it the darkness was so sick that you could literally almost feel it and it's like that right now you see the mental problems everywhere that Prophet already spoke it shall come to pass long after I'm Gone the whole entire world will go insane except those members of the Bride that will hold God's unchanging hand hold to the word of God that keeps your mind stable amen because you're Anchored In Jesus amen you'll go over every storm in every wave amen praise God forevermore hallelujah amen yes sir now we know of course that this coming of Jesus is asleep in the night was spoken of already by Paul but they don't understand many still don't understand but Paul already told us the Rapture mystery and the three stages of it how that Jesus will start coming with a shout a voice a trumpet right we understand my friends that the message going forward the word going forward we understand very much that went from Britain to spoken word you're the voice sending for the word of God hallelujah but thank God they understand that he was just the voice of the sign he was just the voice of the sign they needed to go where that sign was pointing amen and then they will find the Lord Jesus amen praise God forever not more Hallelujah now we who are True Believers we see him clearly as the revealed word for the hour is that right you know um I was speaking to somebody yesterday and explain to them letting them know that just reading the Bible is wonderful doing all the Bible studies of marvelous but that is just enough for you to be able to analyze for you to be able to do your scholarly work and stuff like that and uh it doesn't go where God wants you to be that's another dimension what all together praise the Lord whatsoever I told him about this great lawyer that who has now gone on he never lost the case in uh in his lifetime not one he never lost it and um how that this man murdered his wife and they heard the screaming they heard the shouting and everything else and uh he came out of the door with the blood all on his clothing and and and then he says that uh get away from my yard is a me feed them me me me claudum me kill them in other words I fed her I clothed her and I have a right to kill her that's how he was saying it went to court the case went on for a whole week and every time they would ask this lawyer would you like to cross the question this person that's testifying he said no no no he did not say a word for a week and there were lots of people that were there as Witnesses and then the judge says but what's the Lionel you need to you need to say something how are you going to defend your your your client against these charges right here listen to these charges there are people are gonna think that he did it he said well uh I can't say he did it but what they're saying he did say it he he did say those words I fed her I clothed her and I killed her but he says your honor I listened all week foreign none of them were able to convey to us the truth of what he really said what did you really say now did my client said I fed her and I killed her he says no I'm putting it to you today what my client really said was I fed her include her all her life I kill her kill her you see it's the same words but behind those words are certain nuances unspoken Unwritten things that are coming forth out of that is that right we know that's what lawyers deal with that realm they're just on the edge of it but but we understand that that is what he did and that's what I'm trying to tell you God speaking and dealing with his people is not just by the written word that serves its purpose but he uses the written word to bring you further as you get to know him into himself where he can have fellowship with you and talk with you heart to heart is that right talk with you heart to heart praise the name of the Lord amen glory to God let me go Advance with this amen praise the Lord hallelujah so now we know that in the last days that we are in that the Lord has come he has descended from the shout The Voice he's here Among Us do you believe that in the Simplicity of this moment that he is here Among Us not visible but when he's ready he will make himself visible and take us out of here who are True Believers amen now we know that my friends that he has making himself known to us and he's also making himself known through us is making the world to come to know him through us but The Lies We Live how we conduct ourselves we can't help it because we are Sons and Daughters of the king amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah now this last day Bride As we have said before we came out of the uh out of the upside the mind the womb however you want to describe that of God we came from him just like Eve was brought from the side of Adam by using the figure of Adam God was trying to illustrate if we could have understood it we would have known that that that is what he did his wife was a part of him and we if you are a true chosen son and daughter of God you are actually a part of him and that means that you can't you didn't have salvation on a certain day because if you are a part of him and God is eternal it means you have to be eternal and when I say you I'm not talking about your flesh which will die and pass and become ashes or whatever I'm talking about you I've never seen you you have never seen me but we live in these bodies of time which will soon pass away but we understand that we are Eternal as God is eternal amen and we were hid in him by his Spirit praise the Lord and now he has come to the place where he is unveiling to the world yes his book of the redeemed he is making them know his book of the redeemed or manifested book of redemption being made known to the people they're looking for it here and it's not here anymore it's walking around it's walking around amongst the people in the church is everywhere as as Christians as Believers that holds to God's word for the hour amen and living by their father's will they know nothing else but to obey the will of their Heavenly Father praise the Lord yes sir do that great book of the redeemed that is now being made no maybe you didn't even know your name was in the book but by hearing the word calling and crying out the spirit of Christ crying out for this hour oh my then you there's a certain sound how can I explain that to you I don't know how to explain that there's no words but you're one time you'll hear something that will click within your soul amen you are recognized what what you're hearing is not just words words words but you're hearing something coming out of those words and reach your soul speak to your soul and speak to your heart and your situation amen yes sir hallelujah amen I want to thank God for that we live in this hour we who were reading the Bible and reading about prophecies we are here sitting and living in the midst of the full fulfillment of prophecies going on right now in our day and time amen so now the son of man therefore is revealing himself to the Earth in Bride form that is what they call the son of man now being revealed but they're looking back when they hear son of man being revealed they're expecting to see Jesus from back there two thousand years ago uh walking around with white robes or whatever not realizing that his wife that was in him which is part of him for she is him revealed yes making him Dawn to the world and the son of man is being revealed to the world in that form and she is here doing that as a bride that's taking the word and adorning herself for the coming of her husband praise the Lord get ready for his Divine coming praise God now you will find on the church ages in the church ages Pages 2 95 around there and you can write that down check it out for yourself I don't want to be bogged down by going into all of these various quotes and things like that you don't mind that okay you just go look at it yourself you read it for yourself and it's better that way praise the lord we understand brother Brandon is speaking about the bride and when a bright in the Middle East or the Eastern peoples whether it's India China or or uh wherever in there when they get married they come and they're wearing a veil before their face they have a veil on right and the bright room has to come or she will take the veil away but before that time she has to wear that Veil and I'm trying to tell you this is the hour and this is the time when God Is Lifting the veil off of his sons and his daughters in this nearness hour Amen in the same in that way in a larger sense he is unveiling himself it's the unveiling of God going on whether in word form Spirit form or in Bride form it's the unveiling of God that's now taking place in a mighty way amen praise God the prophet said and then Jehovah will take the veil off of God amen but you see we couldn't understand back then what he was talking about he's talking about the bride taking the veil off of his bride for this day and for this hour praise the Lord Jesus hallelujah amen glory to God look let me just jump across some things here and and move on amen so the veil is being lifted and it's being lifted so now the public is ready to see her right Prophet said she'll be put on public show for for a short while and then the Rapture will just take place but the world is shall be put on public show for that right back then we used to think that it will be just in the ministries of power and and speaking in tongues and massive revivals and then he turns around and says no no no no he says to brother Madison Bose up there in Chicago he says that he says you're thinking wrong you're thinking that because we didn't have thousands come out of the meeting that no that that wasn't a Revival he says no a Revival it's just the calling out of the elect in that area whether there be five or five thousand right that is the Revival amen it's going into a tongue which he was led sometimes just to preach the word to 20 people in a little school room and nobody knew anything about it so that one could hear the word and recognize what was going on that's the real Revival and I believe it's still going on right now by the grace of God hallelujah amen what you excited about brother Simon why is it you like that why can't you give a nice lecture why can't you not speak about butterflies and and a beautiful uh flowers and and barrier dogs when they die and bury your pets and stuff like that that's wonderful others can take that Ministry but I'm here to preach the word of God brother sister Hallelujah I'm here to declare the promise of this day and of this hour praise God forevermore glory to God Amen yes sir so here is me we find friends now he's bringing her into a plain view you know Songs of Solomon said I believe it's uh chapter 2 verse 16. I am my beloved and my beloved is mine how many ever heard that I am my beloved and my beloved is mine we are the Lord's own thanks be to God I said we are the Lord's own we belong to him and he belongs to us now I'll just talk with you here you know that the children of Kings Queens put them dates and very wealthy people they just can't go wrong like ordinary children they they got to be hid usually they are hit their parents try to hide them you are here right now you're sitting in here let's not to say that you're going to go and buy a lottery ticket but let's just say a friend who bought a lottery ticket for you laughs and it just so happens that that lottery ticket wins right it sounds like a certain preacher who was thoroughly preaching against that and Blasting and shopping and everything else and his wife behind his back went and bought a ticket and she won and it was many many many millions when they asked him about his wifey I have nothing to do with that the Lord has blessed her in that way and if it's going to bless me too I know what can I do well see that's that's life that's just human life but let's come back to where we are here the children of wealthy people have to be protected where you are right now you you're just a regular person and you're still your child has to be protected but you know the moment you have a lot of money the protection guns will not give us the next level they really have to be protected and um up to the grandkids and the little they have to be protected in every way possible because they're in danger of being kidnapped right and look the devil hasn't gone anywhere he's looking to kidnap you if you don't behave yourself and be the way you're supposed to be the devil will kidnap you you're kidnapped or you're killed are you in prison he'll do anything like that and the devil is such a one and take me seriously we have got to realize we are the sons and daughters of God and the devil is out there trying to kidnap you amen so God had to hide us in a mystery uh until our time of maturity or until this time of the church world the church the elect come into her maturity and understanding of him his word of who he is amen praise God so these many wealthy people their children comes from foreign lands to United States to Canada and they go into various uh universities or schools and they move around like they're ordinary and they're knocked I've seen them come from Nigeria I've seen them come from China seen them come from other lands and uh friends of my my daughter and come to find out when the season is over this one's father comes with a plane and picks her up at this Jet and gone to France or gone wherever and the next one and it's like that but when they are here they just move around playing an ordinary and that's what you're doing right now you realize that your father is the king of the universe and you're walking around like an ordinary person and I don't even just a regular right and you just move around like that because the devil is looking to kidnap you or he's looking to imprison you or even to kill you if he can in every possible way but these people come from across the seas and they come to a foreign land and hide themselves I thank God that God allowed us to come from Heaven to Earth and to be here in this earth filled with sin filled with deception filled with evil amen but we don't worry because of the end of the season praise the Lord there's a land beyond the river that we call a sweet forever and we'll only reach that Shore by Faith's degree one by one will gain the portals dare to dwell with the Immortals when their rank them gold and bells for you and me can't you hear those bells not ringing yes sir I feel the call of the Holy Spirit the spirit of the Living God Amen yes sir Hallelujah and then some of you may be going through uh problems in life your life right now things that you don't understand why it's happening but uh in every schoolyard you always got to bully and Satan is your bully he's tried to bully you in your life it's right to bully you you understand I'm using the world as a god used this world as a training ground for his children we are in the schoolyard of Earth and the lessons of life we have various teachers right we have various teachers of every kind whether it be from your parents then you went to a school and you had a teacher in school and then you had a you had a let me call myself a person uh right you you are the person or you have some kind of leadership and like that but experiences teach you too and so the world is used by God as a training ground and a teaching ground but in the teaching ground in the schoolyard is a big bully and that bull here Satan I said never bullied you I don't know about you but he tried to bully me many times and at first I used to be scared of him until I wake up like the like brother Brandon started saying woo amen and all you always have big Bluff all you are is an old lion with no teeth your teeth are all gone all you can do is Roar to keep a whole lot of noise to scare people and and there's nothing behind that all your claws are blunted amen because you already defeated amen yes sir but thank God God didn't let us come here alone but the Bible says the spirit the angel of the Lord encampment about them that fear him praise God and if you fear Him and you trust him the angel of God and camps around you and protects you every step of the way amen glory be to God hallelujah so there we are praise the Lord praise God so God has to hide you and protect you until your graduation day and when your graduation day comes then well he can't help it now you're going to be exposed to the public on the stage of life you get on the stage of life and you're exposed to the public that is what essentially we are in the process of right now unknown on some unheard hid off in a corner but God is starting to pull the veil off of his children amen and we don't have to do anything we don't have to Brother by the time we don't have to have a marketing program we don't have to have some program where we we use all the machinations and things on the internet to make ourselves known no God is doing that amen and he will do that by his Spirit by in his own way in his own time for his own Glory praise God forevermore Hallelujah yes sir so there he comes because God is starting to display you and I'm going to start winding this up but I still have some more to say he's got to display you because time is short we have to go out of here but he still wants to know the world to know they were here they were here but you didn't know them but they were here and now you start to recognize I'm taking them all the air as quickly as I can right so he's making them know praise the Lord look at them in them I display how they overcome the nominationalism how do you overcome all the wisdom of theologians and of so-called professors not possessors but professors they overcome all of that right they overcome traditions they will come all the Temptations and the trials of life and that did not shave they did not move yes their knees must have trembled they might sometimes the trials the troubles are so much they fall down their knees but thank God they're still on the Rock Amen you slip on the Slime you slip on the Moors but you're still on the Rock Amen Hallelujah all the gods unchanging hands amen you're kept by the power of God through faith amen you're not going anywhere because what where the shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life where else we're going to go we never heard a thing like this amen Lord God hallelujah overcome all the Temptations the devil can throw at you all the trials he can throw at you he throw every every look or praise God I thank God and I go back to this old thing that happened under the Blue Jays how many knows who the Blue Jays are oh my this guy's preaching and he's gone now to baseball but that's the holy spirit amen but here it is that they had a fellow from the um Philadelphia that was a wonderful picture my goodness when you see he reared back and he comes with one of those balls over 90 something miles an hour just blowing those guys out of there and but then they were down to the last inning it was a 19 I think it's the ninth inning and just the last inning and the last person to bat and there were even oh my but there this guy's name was what JC huh well I said JC so you can get a hint well his name was Joe Carter and your cartoon was sitting there it was and he just grabbed a hold of his back and when you see he was there and there Comes The Wild Thing grab a hold of that ball and he reared back whom and Joe Carter took that battle whack and he cracked it right out to the top of the stadium amen and the place went wild oh lord of God I think that sometimes we are to go wild over this word of God I I believe sometimes we have to go wild over this promise word of God for the hour Hallelujah because Jesus knocks him out to the ballpark and I believe right now that's what the word of God is doing with the devil knocking him out to the ballpark any one of these brothers will knock the devil out of the ballpark the Holy Spirit anointed their lies will knock him out of the ballpark amen amen an individual Believers you should start to recognize the word enough to kick him out your house don't allow him to have a space in your house amen turn him into your football amen glory to God Amen yes sir that's what you got to do praise the Lord so here we are coming out of all those Trails the display of the Bride the display of the unveiling of these sons of the Living God coming to what we come into our adoption time go read the adoption book coming into our adoption time but you see a lot of them uh believe the adoption time was a time when you were an adopted son now you come into power and you come into power you come into this you come into that you don't understand that's part of it Paul already told us what the adoption time is you can read it in your own Bible if I have the scripture here he says Romans 8 23 could you put that up Romans 8 23. Hallelujah but not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for which is what is right there in your word that is what adoption really is but you know through the years in the message Brothers preach about the adoption and make it so mysterious and so my goodness you know like that but really this body change The Mystery of the body change that you can be alive and still you're being changed and you don't feel anything and you don't even know that you're being changed except that we have a revelation that we are being changed and we've been changed and the Bible tells us Paul said it you're gonna be changed from glory to glory to glory and like Alice you walk through and step into the Wonderland you step right through the Looking Glass world that we're living in and you're on the other side oh praise God aren't you looking for that wonderful time amen yes sir the Redemption of our bodies think about that being Redeemed by the grace of God hallelujah so as the as our heavenly father has begun to acknowledge us uh before the public so that all can see and experience his Divine and Supernatural approval like the prophet said when God sees us time he'll take you aside in front of the public and or approve of you before the people so that the people will know that you are approved by him not you are proving yourself I'm Christian I'm a Believer I I alter the word I got the message I got that's wonderful that's nice but it's God has to come and approve you supernaturally when you're not even thinking you're not even looking for it and then God will come to approve you amen now let me get into a few things here would you give me just a little more time it's not one o'clock yet anyway but I'd like to get you out earlier than that if I can do you know devils and demons are going to start having to testify of you of Who You Are who we are that you are the sons and daughters of God they'll have to do it they have to testify they say how do you know that well when Jesus came what happened he was just walking down the street and all of a sudden Here Comes This demons criminal oh we know you who you are we we know you who you are you're the Holy One Of God they'll know you who you are remember Paul when Paul was out there the Seventh Son of Siva went there and what did the demon say Paul we know we we know who you are Paul but but these guys they have no representation they have no seed no election oh my goodness ended give me back those clothes and others wealth that I give you the the the and then now you coming against me to cast me out and so the devil tore the clothes up and threw them out out of there like that amen yes sir but the devils and you're gonna start experiencing that right devils are literally going to start to obey you and fear you and want to get away from your presence because of the God who lives in you and not only that is because what myself and other ministers that recognize are doing is causing you to recognize yourself of Who You Are and that you become certain of God and know that you must be obeyed and that Satan is a defeated foe and is under your feet Lord of God hallelujah amen yes sir so you see because they went to see if you know who you are once you are not certain of Who You Are and you don't know who you are the devil will play with your mind he'll try to scare you and everything else and Bluff you on everything else out of your own property he will Bluff you uh if you don't know yourself but you see you we have come to hear the word of God to make you certain of God and to recognize who you really are amen yes sir and when they can see that you have not come to recognize who you are and you don't realize the extent of the power that that is in you and that can flow through you then he's they're not going to obey you you're not gonna obey your commands oh my goodness but when you recognize your position and who you are that you are a child of the king the Devils will scream and come out at your very Presence at your very Shadow amen why because they recognize there goes a daughter of God there was a Son of God there was a child of the king they'll recognize it oh praise God hallelujah say what are you talking about what you're what I'm talking about I experience amen Hallelujah not that I walk around like that every day but the times you'll be surprised just shake their hand of somebody that's supposed to be high up in the societies well God it's nice to meet you people up in the air down on the ground well I can't help that because I don't know what flew out of me I just was shaking his hand I wasn't thinking God I wasn't thinking scripture or anything like that just shocked the person's hand and and they gone into whatever you call it they call it this or that whatever but that will happen but you will find out that will start to happen you're going to see it start happening you hear what I'm saying I'm telling you now that the true sons and US of God you don't have there's nothing you have to do say oh I'm going to pray and ask God to give me a miracle ministry I I gotta really pray up until I'm filled with the power of God no just do your normal life the prophet said be simple be humble be reverent and God will bless you that's all God asks you to do and the Holy Spirit Will flow through you you'll be surprised how the holy spirit will use you and they will recognize amen but not only these Devils all nature will will start recognizing that the sons of God have come to maturity and they are now being unveiled and all nature and all the heavens and all the worlds that are in the heavens they're going to start to recognize who we are and come back into harmony with us according to the scripture I think that is in uh Genesis 1 26-31 could you put that up praise the Lord you don't mind my taking my time it's all right you can sleep and wake up and you hear the rest of it like somebody's sitting for an hour they're gonna feel a bit you know so what can you do about that and I said let the Holy Spirit have his way you hear what you need to hear praise the Lord okay let's read it and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the cattle over all the Earth and over every creep every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth now first of all image of God we know that that doesn't mean this that this is the image of God that's what they try to tell you but the real image is the image the seed the the attribute of God in you right let us make man in our own image the spirit man right praise the Lord as we preach explained before at one time Adam couldn't he couldn't kill the soil he couldn't do anything but he was yet a spirit man until God created a body and put him in that body and breathe the breath of life then he could go kill the soil and do those various things right so we see that so but all the all the animals all the plants are coming back into harmony with the True Believer brother Branham give us that in a nice way he didn't say it like that but that's what was happening with him when he crossed the field and the bull run out to go and Gore him and he just said oh I'm sorry I Disturbed you your rest under the tree just go back and rest and then the bull just went off and went back to Wrath because the bull realized he recognized who he is and he has no hatred he has to know there's no sin in him that brings dangerous feelings in the animal so it just went back and rested right he's in his house he'd go out the morning and he opens the door and there is a possum and a possum comes right comes right in front of him and looking up and and it was wounded and you know the story he prayed for the possum what was it this is what I'm telling you about I'm telling you about it because though it was happening or some of it was happening with me I only now I'm consciously recognizing what is going on what is actually beginning and as you sons and US of God I want you to be made aware so that you can be conscious of what is taking place around us I'm going to close this I I have more that I could say but they are willingly bringing themselves um back under our Dominion to finish that Genesis that we were reading it tells you that I give you dominion over all pla all the animals everything all all of them have to be under your Dominion that is what we are going right back to that state we were in and when they recognize it they are bringing themselves back into harmony with you bringing yourself back to a place where they begin to obey the word of God within you praise the Lord so don't look at the chaos don't look at the madness that's taking place in the world around you you should rejoice because that is just letting you know that's the labor pains Arts labor pains to bring forth the sons of God the children of God being born and being made manifested in this day and in this hour if you were not fully conscious and fully aware of some of what I've said here today I pray that God will bring into a state of full Consciousness and awareness of what he is doing now not what he did back in the Bible days we read that we get inspiration we have faith from that but what God is doing right now Open Your Eyes Open the Eyes of your heart and see what he's doing in this hour and it happens so simple the problem said it happens so simple so humble that if you're not really watching you won't even recognize it you won't even know what's happening that's the way God works right he says the a whole lot of noise but he says look they got pumps pumping water oh my and they boast about it well you know 50 000 gallons a minute and so on like that he says in the Sun comes out and in one day all the place dry up they don't know where all these millions and millions of gallons of water disappear to with no noise no sound it's all gone up that's what's got how God works and that is what is happening right now praise the lord we are going through a change I'm going through a change you're going through a change I don't fully recognize it yet but praise God May the Holy Spirit bring you into the fullness of his divine presence amen praise the Lord shall We Stand look to the Lord in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for the word that we spoke here today and Lord it this really wants to uh Enlighten your people father as you it's not a sermon to uh heal the sick which though they can be healed in the midst of all of this it's not one preached and evangelically though they can come and surrender themselves to you and make their confession of Faith trust you and lay their lives into your marvelous hand and your gracious keeping father but just to shine the light upon the word upon the moment and the hour of what is happening what is taking place and father I'm announcing this to them so they can now become conscious be able to look around them and see people circumstances plants animals objects all coming back into harmony all coming back into subjection to the Sons and Daughters of God to thee be all the glory and the praise in the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord amen and amen thank you Lord praise God God bless you all [Applause] how many can say they believe that oh glorious victory [Music] that day he set me free and he made my heart his very throne my life is no longer mine I'm a prisoner of love divine and now I live to
