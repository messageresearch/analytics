[48:44] the prevailing power of revelation
[48:49] we have always talked about revelation
[48:51] you've heard me preached about

[48:56] together
[48:57] and we speak about the word
[49:00] that we don't speak about revelation
[49:04] because as you know
[49:07] in the church age
[49:09] message
[49:11] the prophet said
[49:12] the
[49:13] importance
[49:15] of revelation
[49:18] by this spirit
[49:20] to a true believer
[49:22] can never
[49:24] be over emphasized
[49:27] but you see we've always talked about
[49:30] revelation through the message we've
[49:33] always talked about how god makes
[49:36] himself known to us
[49:38] but what really caught my attention
[49:41] maybe later late you may say i'm a lit
[49:44] learner but that's okay
[49:46] but it's just struck me
[49:49] that he said
[49:50] the importance of revelation
[49:53] by the spirit
[49:55] not to the church
[49:57] not to the group
[50:00] not to anything else
[50:03] but the power of the revelation
[50:06] is to the individual believer
[50:12] and that is what i'm here to talk about
[50:17] he said the power to the individual
[50:19] believer
[50:21] that's when
[50:22] the revelation becomes powerful
[50:26] because it goes into the individual
[50:29] combustion chambers
[50:31] and then when that blasts out there's
[50:34] sparks of fire uh and the holy spirit is
[50:39] able to grant that believer dynamics
[50:43] on the mechanics that they have already
[50:45] received
[50:47] you'll receive the teaching the
[50:49] mechanics of the word
[50:52] and that was piled up into you
[50:55] but now
[50:56] let the fire fall upon the mechanics
[50:59] that were there and set the fire that we
[51:02] might go forth in the power of the holy
[51:05] spirit to carry out the will of god
[51:09] now
[51:10] he said when i say revelation
[51:14] i'm talking about all revelation
[51:18] see
[51:19] it's important to the individual
[51:22] true believer
[51:25] and it's tremendously important to the
[51:28] church now he brings that afterwards
[51:31] right only because when
[51:33] many people with individual revelation
[51:37] come together that you have an assembly
[51:40] a called out assembly right so there is
[51:44] where he's talking about praise god and
[51:48] with a revelation is what is the key to
[51:51] the entire bible
[51:54] because if you don't have it you can
[51:56] read it that's fine but you don't have
[51:59] the key so the door will not open
[52:02] it will not reveal
[52:04] and so revelation is the key
[52:08] that god has given to us
[52:11] now you know these things when he said
[52:13] the key of david and all of that and
[52:16] i alone have the power to open a power
[52:20] shut and when i shut no man opens when i
[52:23] open no man's shots praise god it's god
[52:27] using the power of revelation to the
[52:31] individual
[52:33] hallelujah now
[52:36] as an individual
[52:37] uh listen
[52:39] matthew in the book of matthew when he
[52:41] said here to them matthew 16
[52:44] whom do men say that i am
[52:48] and
[52:50] you say oh lord some say you're jeremiah
[52:52] some say you are uh you know you're
[52:56] this one moses some say you are elias
[52:59] some say
[53:01] lord
[53:02] john the baptist or whatever uh you know
[53:05] and then he says oh so that's men's
[53:10] interpretations and men's ideas of who i
[53:13] am
[53:14] maybe they've written great treaties and
[53:17] great
[53:18] books on the matter of who i am
[53:21] maybe they've raised up colleges and
[53:24] seminaries and gave great bible studies
[53:27] and eloquent talks of who i am
[53:31] but ah that's good but i don't want to
[53:34] hear that who do you as an individual
[53:36] say that i am
[53:39] have you got a personal private
[53:42] relationship from god of who i am
[53:46] oh my so but whom do you say that i am
[53:52] oh my praise the lord hallelujah now we
[53:56] know that the catholics do say
[54:00] uh that the church is built on peter
[54:04] but we know that that's not so
[54:08] the pentecostals and the protestants say
[54:11] it's built on jesus
[54:14] and that's all also not so
[54:17] it's not built on jesus
[54:20] but it's the revelation on who jesus was
[54:24] and is
[54:25] the revelation that not this flesh
[54:29] called jesus that god dwelt it was not
[54:32] built on that
[54:34] but it was built on who he truly was
[54:37] that he was jehovah god
[54:40] manifesting himself through that flesh
[54:43] that was called jesus
[54:45] god in flesh appearing praise god it's
[54:49] not built on the man jesus that was born
[54:53] of mary
[54:54] but is built upon jehovah god of heaven
[54:57] that lived in a man named jesus christ
[55:00] hallelujah oh praise god amen oh my
[55:05] praise god now my flesh and blood has
[55:08] not revealed this to you
[55:11] not theologian can
[55:13] no school can
[55:15] flesh and blood has not
[55:18] revealed this onto you and can never
[55:21] reveal this onto you no matter how
[55:24] eloquent no matter how well spoken no
[55:27] matter how well trained they cannot
[55:30] reveal this onto you
[55:34] amen flesh and blood has not revealed
[55:38] this unto you but my father in heaven
[55:42] hath revealed this onto you
[55:44] and upon this rock
[55:47] this rock of the revelation of who
[55:51] jesus really is
[55:53] amen i will build my church hallelujah
[55:57] so the church is built on what
[56:01] on the revelation of who jesus was
[56:04] when we look at this the church ages
[56:07] what do you see the foundation
[56:10] no i i just place in there jesus christ
[56:13] son of man but you'll see when uh
[56:16] brother branham's written it just has a
[56:18] thin sliver at the bottom he doesn't say
[56:20] anything but really what he's showing
[56:23] you is that the foundation of the entire
[56:26] pyramid of the church ages is built upon
[56:30] the foundation of the thin three and a
[56:33] half years ministry of who jesus was
[56:37] and that's what the entire church is
[56:40] built upon oh blessed be the name of the
[56:43] lord god
[56:45] now he says here
[56:47] how did abel know
[56:49] what to offer
[56:51] how did he know what to offer as a
[56:54] proper sacrifice to god
[56:57] what book what what book did he read
[57:00] where did he learn what school did he go
[57:02] to no bible was written nothing was
[57:05] written flesh and blood did not reveal
[57:08] this to him but the father in heaven
[57:11] reveal this unto abel
[57:14] he said but did cain get such a
[57:17] revelation
[57:19] no
[57:19] he said
[57:20] cain
[57:22] and abel
[57:24] they had a commandment to sacrifice
[57:27] they had a commandment
[57:29] but one by revelation with the one hung
[57:33] on to the commandment if you had the
[57:36] written word then cain would have held
[57:38] on to that written word and said look
[57:39] what it says here and he's arguing with
[57:41] you on that but abel had the written
[57:44] word but he also had a revelation from
[57:48] god on that commandment that was
[57:50] received hallelujah and we have it even
[57:53] today a lot of people are living christ
[57:56] living christianity by commandment
[58:00] they're living but look i see it there
[58:03] we supposed to do this i'm not supposed
[58:05] to be angry under this circumstance i'm
[58:08] supposed to act this way and i'm
[58:10] supposed to do that they're doing it
[58:13] by
[58:13] my script
[58:16] you understand they're doing it like you
[58:18] have a play and you have a script and
[58:21] you have to act according to that script
[58:24] they don't realize the holy spirit is
[58:26] there with the believer who believe that
[58:29] they are improvising but they are not
[58:32] because the spirit in them is moving
[58:34] them spontaneously
[58:36] by divine revelation
[58:40] hallelujah
[58:41] praise god hallelujah i want you to know
[58:45] my friends the greek word for revelation
[58:48] is apocalypse
[58:50] which means unveiling
[58:53] hallelujah let me just join a few more
[58:55] here unveiling or exposing
[59:00] uncovering
[59:02] or revealing
[59:05] praise be to god hallelujah i want you
[59:08] to see this
[59:09] now
[59:10] you see
[59:12] about by faith received the revelation
[59:17] of the blood
[59:20] can did not get such a revelation
[59:24] he had a commandment
[59:27] see he could offer a sacrifice too
[59:31] but one did it by what revelation
[59:35] the other did it by commandment
[59:38] see oh my
[59:40] oh and it was just that revelation
[59:44] that made the difference for abel and
[59:48] gave him eternal life
[59:52] or recognized that he had amen and
[59:54] that's the difference brother sister
[59:56] don't underestimate the little thing you
[1:00:00] think oh you we
[1:00:01] especially if you're in a message you
[1:00:03] start taking it ordinary oh i i got the
[1:00:06] revelation of the last prophet's message
[1:00:09] and you just sing it it becomes a sing
[1:00:11] song and the people don't realize
[1:00:14] the importance
[1:00:16] of it that that one little rock that
[1:00:19] you're standing on that one little faith
[1:00:22] one little scripture
[1:00:24] one little thought that's empowering you
[1:00:27] that is the thing that makes the
[1:00:30] difference between you and billions in
[1:00:33] this entire world that you are different
[1:00:36] you're born for a purpose
[1:00:39] you place them here with a purpose from
[1:00:41] the presence of almighty god
[1:00:44] amen
[1:00:46] listen
[1:00:48] individual
[1:00:51] you might even take what your pastor
[1:00:54] says now somebody may say oh i'm i'm
[1:00:58] putting down pastors uh or we don't need
[1:01:00] the five-fold ministry because here the
[1:01:02] prophet is saying no that's not what is
[1:01:05] being said but your eyes should be off
[1:01:08] the pastor of the prophet and on to the
[1:01:11] bridegroom amen that's where your eyes
[1:01:14] ought to be on the bright room get your
[1:01:17] eyes on him by revelation praise the
[1:01:20] name of the lord see all my you may take
[1:01:24] what the pastor says you may take what
[1:01:27] the seminary teaches they may teach it
[1:01:30] with eloquence but until god reveals it
[1:01:35] to you you don't have nothing amen god
[1:01:38] has to reveal his word to you and then
[1:01:41] that word becomes something to you that
[1:01:45] jesus is the christ hallelujah reveals
[1:01:48] to you that the blood cleanses you
[1:01:51] reveals to you that it is god that is
[1:01:54] your savior amen not now a third person
[1:01:59] or whatever but god himself amen you're
[1:02:02] saved by the blood of god you're
[1:02:04] redeemed by the blood of god hallelujah
[1:02:08] that's why we here this morning praise
[1:02:10] god not by formality but by revelation
[1:02:14] of the holy spirit of the living god
[1:02:16] amen yes sir it is this spiritual
[1:02:22] revelation
[1:02:23] that does it
[1:02:26] now
[1:02:27] here's another thing why revelation is
[1:02:29] of great importance to you for offense
[1:02:33] and for defense
[1:02:35] listen
[1:02:36] satan hates revelation
[1:02:40] amen
[1:02:41] he hates revelation
[1:02:43] and why because it reveals his end
[1:02:48] but let me let me let me give you some
[1:02:50] things here he hates revelation because
[1:02:54] revelation is really god telling us
[1:02:57] about the devil his character his works
[1:03:01] and all the strategies that he gonna try
[1:03:03] to he's going to use against you before
[1:03:06] he does it god reveals it
[1:03:09] god reveals all his moves that he he's
[1:03:12] gonna do
[1:03:13] god revealed to us the devil's beginning
[1:03:18] and right there we know he's not a god
[1:03:21] he's coming to an end
[1:03:23] because he at the beginning he's not the
[1:03:26] creator he is a created being he is
[1:03:29] subject to the almighty god
[1:03:31] hallelujah he's nothing but another
[1:03:34] subject but a wicked one hallelujah god
[1:03:38] showed his beginning that even though he
[1:03:41] is a spiritual being even though he's a
[1:03:45] religious being
[1:03:47] amen yes his beginning was in the midst
[1:03:51] of wars
[1:03:53] miss whisper campaigns
[1:03:56] rumors
[1:03:57] lies and everything else god reveals to
[1:04:01] us his beginning
[1:04:04] and he reveals to us the trail of the
[1:04:07] serpent
[1:04:08] his entire uh walk through the entire
[1:04:12] earth god reveals that to us also that
[1:04:15] he is his trail that he's walking on and
[1:04:19] then reveals to us
[1:04:21] his final end
[1:04:24] so we don't have to look in the crystal
[1:04:26] ball we just look in the bible
[1:04:29] we exactly can tell the devil his future
[1:04:32] like the one man came to me on the
[1:04:34] street
[1:04:35] and said oh i see this light around you
[1:04:39] i see this light around you i want you
[1:04:41] to know
[1:04:42] that i was sent to you uh to
[1:04:45] well when he got there to tell me this
[1:04:48] that i said just a minute you
[1:04:51] were sent to me
[1:04:52] i said you you've got it wrong
[1:04:56] i was sent to you
[1:04:58] and you're going to tell me my future i
[1:05:01] know my future i'll tell you your future
[1:05:05] you step back i said i see flames
[1:05:11] and when they started talking he took
[1:05:14] off in a speed he just ran for his life
[1:05:17] let me tell you something the devil is
[1:05:19] scared of being exposed
[1:05:25] if you can hide behind a religious mask
[1:05:28] and captivate your credibility
[1:05:31] and captivate your emotions captivate
[1:05:35] your sight your hearing your smelling
[1:05:38] use all kinds of means to control and to
[1:05:41] contaminate your faith he will but the
[1:05:44] moment he's exposed
[1:05:46] the light shines on him he runs for
[1:05:50] cover like an old rat roach or something
[1:05:53] else i thank god in this hour that there
[1:05:56] is a man here we can't see but he's here
[1:05:59] turning on the light for us that we can
[1:06:02] recognize who we are who the devil is
[1:06:05] what his end is going to be
[1:06:07] blessed be the name of the living god he
[1:06:11] hates to be exposed
[1:06:13] and he is coming to his end
[1:06:16] and not only him but all his followers
[1:06:21] whether it be angels that fell down here
[1:06:23] with him
[1:06:24] or whether it be human beings on the
[1:06:28] earth that he controls and manifests
[1:06:31] himself through
[1:06:33] they're coming to their end
[1:06:36] for the word of god says so hallelujah
[1:06:40] now you see
[1:06:42] right now he is fighting everything
[1:06:46] and doing all he can to do what destroy
[1:06:51] confidence in the world
[1:06:54] but when the church believes satan
[1:06:58] amen disbelieve satan and believe the
[1:07:03] spirit's revelation of the word then
[1:07:06] that gates are hell cannot reveal
[1:07:09] against her
[1:07:10] hallelujah then he begins to talk about
[1:07:13] his gift and then in talk speaking of
[1:07:16] his gifts he said you know when the
[1:07:18] devil can sense
[1:07:20] with the gift that is in my life of
[1:07:23] discernment
[1:07:24] that is now about time
[1:07:26] when i'm going to start calling names
[1:07:31] and when he knows i'm going to start
[1:07:33] calling names then he says he starts to
[1:07:36] manifest and you i can look and see the
[1:07:39] prophet is talking how some people faces
[1:07:41] begins to
[1:07:43] you know change and gets grotesque and
[1:07:46] showing various things amen
[1:07:49] you see for satan got a hold of their
[1:07:51] lives through sin indifference and true
[1:07:54] disease and you should see their faces
[1:07:58] because satan knows he is going to be ex
[1:08:03] exposed and the most peculiar changes
[1:08:07] come over them people's county nonsense
[1:08:10] why satan is afraid he knows the spirit
[1:08:14] of god is about to let the people know
[1:08:19] about his works of what he has done in
[1:08:22] their lives see the whole night and
[1:08:26] that's why he had meetings like this you
[1:08:29] see for when
[1:08:32] names are called and disease is revealed
[1:08:36] satan hates it because it's by
[1:08:40] revelation of the holy ghost
[1:08:42] oh praise god forevermore i want to
[1:08:46] thank god my friends that when satan
[1:08:50] hits now the
[1:08:51] opening of the world
[1:08:54] for the world is revealing his true
[1:08:56] character
[1:08:58] even though he hid in the church
[1:09:01] for seven church ages
[1:09:03] hiding under this guise of religious and
[1:09:06] enticing spirits hiding there and trying
[1:09:10] to undermine and contaminate and create
[1:09:14] chaos in the kingdom of god now the
[1:09:17] seven seals have been revealed and his
[1:09:20] character and his true works are now
[1:09:24] being exposed in a brighter light by
[1:09:27] many brothers who have received the
[1:09:30] genuine revelation of the word of god
[1:09:33] hallelujah
[1:09:34] and worst of all
[1:09:36] the revelation has come down to the
[1:09:38] individual
[1:09:40] and the seventh seal is now calling the
[1:09:42] names of the elect blessed be the name
[1:09:45] of the lord the devil can't stand it
[1:09:49] because your name is being called
[1:09:52] why he said not not james jim or
[1:09:54] whatever but while the word is being
[1:09:57] preached the revelation that is going
[1:09:59] forth is calling out to somebody some
[1:10:02] heart the deepest calling back to the
[1:10:05] deep and the deep response back to the
[1:10:08] word hallelujah god calling our names by
[1:10:12] the opening of the word
[1:10:14] that part of the word that called me
[1:10:16] might not be the partner called you the
[1:10:18] part that called him might not be the
[1:10:19] part that calls her but my god your name
[1:10:22] is in there praise god and when that
[1:10:25] word is preached when the seals are open
[1:10:28] your name is being called
[1:10:31] [Applause]
[1:10:33] hallelujah
[1:10:35] he hates the book
[1:10:36] he hits the revelation of jesus christ
[1:10:39] when it's in the church
[1:10:41] because he knows
[1:10:44] that jesus christ is the same
[1:10:47] yesterday today forever
[1:10:50] he knows
[1:10:51] amen more he knows that he knows more
[1:10:55] than 90 percent of them so-called
[1:10:59] theologians
[1:11:01] he knows
[1:11:02] that god has never changed his nature
[1:11:07] and he knows
[1:11:09] that if the church gets back to the
[1:11:11] original church like it was a pentecost
[1:11:15] with the power of god mark 16 in action
[1:11:18] the true church and all its claims oh my
[1:11:22] all else will be proven to be false and
[1:11:25] counterfeit
[1:11:27] hallelujah see oh my yes sir for the
[1:11:31] true church is a continuation of the
[1:11:35] book of acts blessed be the name of the
[1:11:38] lord god he hates
[1:11:41] people also knowing
[1:11:44] of the
[1:11:45] revelation
[1:11:47] of two spirits
[1:11:49] operating right in the church in the
[1:11:53] religious realm
[1:11:54] he said he hates people knowing that he
[1:11:57] wants them all to think that that that
[1:12:00] yeah but uh there's another quote i'm
[1:12:02] just bringing this to my mind now he
[1:12:04] says yes he says the church
[1:12:07] what he says
[1:12:09] god deals with the individual not with
[1:12:11] the group because in any group
[1:12:15] there is renegades
[1:12:18] there is
[1:12:20] wickedness there is all kinds of rebels
[1:12:25] in there so he says organization groups
[1:12:29] and all that out the door god is dealing
[1:12:32] with individuals
[1:12:34] hallelujah and so he he doesn't want to
[1:12:39] expose that he is operating in the
[1:12:42] church
[1:12:43] in the religious realm or to the people
[1:12:46] hallelujah because there's one brother
[1:12:48] sweet as anything else and there's
[1:12:50] another one over there also sweet but
[1:12:53] underneath that sweetness
[1:12:55] using that
[1:12:57] outside character for all kinds of
[1:12:59] wickedness and evils and manipulation
[1:13:02] and lies right the devil can lead you
[1:13:04] along for years and all of a sudden that
[1:13:06] brother who you were putting your faith
[1:13:08] on bang he falls
[1:13:10] he said well if that man was so true and
[1:13:12] he fall i might as well forget all this
[1:13:14] you see you weren't looking the right
[1:13:16] place
[1:13:17] your eyes your heart wasn't based on the
[1:13:20] right thing amen
[1:13:22] hallelujah now think of it
[1:13:26] this means this
[1:13:28] revelation is not to anyone it's not to
[1:13:32] everyone hallelujah praise god it will
[1:13:36] take a special class of people do you
[1:13:39] believe that
[1:13:41] yes praise god people with spiritual
[1:13:45] insight
[1:13:47] praise god it not mean you're smart
[1:13:50] therefore you got all these smart
[1:13:53] sharp intellectual insights no but he's
[1:13:57] talking about you having the inside
[1:13:58] teacher that the holy spirit in you who
[1:14:02] is going to teach you and be a witness
[1:14:04] to you
[1:14:06] to the word
[1:14:08] by saying in your heart that's right
[1:14:12] you just heard it but you don't know why
[1:14:14] you believe it but something and you
[1:14:15] spoke to you and say that's right
[1:14:18] just as simple as that that's right he's
[1:14:20] a witness in you testifying back to the
[1:14:24] world
[1:14:25] that that word is right it's thus saith
[1:14:28] the lord
[1:14:29] hallelujah amen praise god so satan
[1:14:33] hates
[1:14:34] that he hates that he doesn't want it
[1:14:38] see praise god for we will be powerless
[1:14:40] when the true church knows that
[1:14:43] amen hallelujah oh my when this
[1:14:47] particular church private i'm talking
[1:14:50] about the local church here
[1:14:52] hit some years ago at that point where
[1:14:54] the holy spirit revealed to us not to be
[1:14:57] just naive
[1:15:00] and every religious uh so-called person
[1:15:03] that says they believe the message
[1:15:06] every preacher that comes by and say i'm
[1:15:09] a preacher the message
[1:15:11] he exposed some of those before us
[1:15:15] he exposed even individual brothers that
[1:15:18] come in the church and they are doing
[1:15:20] this and doing that and then pulling all
[1:15:22] manner of tricks and all kind of things
[1:15:25] on the side and the holy spirit exposed
[1:15:27] them and what was he doing teaching us
[1:15:31] not to rely on just sight and sound and
[1:15:35] emotions and your own impressions but to
[1:15:39] rely on the revelation of the holy
[1:15:42] spirit by the word of god
[1:15:47] hallelujah blessed be the name the lord
[1:15:51] and two spirits operating in the church
[1:15:53] and he hates that revelation but we love
[1:15:56] it because with that true revelation in
[1:15:59] our lives the gates of hell cannot
[1:16:03] prevail against us amen but we will
[1:16:07] prevail
[1:16:08] against him praise god so it takes a
[1:16:11] special class of people praise god
[1:16:15] and that's something else you sit here
[1:16:17] so ordinary and god is calling you a
[1:16:20] special class of people
[1:16:23] you're special
[1:16:25] in his eyes he calls you the apple of
[1:16:27] his eyes
[1:16:29] he calls you the stars in this crown
[1:16:32] that calls you his glory the joy of his
[1:16:35] life amen praise be to god hallelujah oh
[1:16:40] praise god a special class of people
[1:16:43] people with spiritual insight listen to
[1:16:45] god's prophet
[1:16:47] it will take a people
[1:16:50] with the ability to hear from god
[1:16:54] some don't have that ability unto you it
[1:16:57] is given to know the mystery of the
[1:16:59] kingdom
[1:17:00] unto them it's not given
[1:17:02] amen you're all praise god hallelujah oh
[1:17:07] my you might have been born deaf or
[1:17:10] thinking that you're deaf but the holy
[1:17:12] spirit casts out that death devil from
[1:17:15] you that you can hear praise god by the
[1:17:18] spirit of almighty god amen
[1:17:21] now you're hearing the word of god
[1:17:23] hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the
[1:17:27] living god hallelujah oh a special class
[1:17:31] of people willing to
[1:17:33] with the ability to receive spiritual
[1:17:36] instruction
[1:17:39] the willing to learn
[1:17:42] hallelujah
[1:17:43] become children in the sight of god
[1:17:46] unwilling to learn praise god
[1:17:49] let me say to you
[1:17:51] there there is nothing of such
[1:17:54] prevailing power
[1:17:57] as the revelation of the world and
[1:18:00] that's why i'm talking about it
[1:18:02] the prevailing power of revelation and
[1:18:06] in particular to the individual
[1:18:09] when they have received it
[1:18:11] and then no i'd like to repeat it let me
[1:18:14] say it again somebody may catch it
[1:18:18] they know
[1:18:19] and they're certain of god that they
[1:18:21] know
[1:18:24] they know and they know that they know
[1:18:28] praise god it is it's like because now
[1:18:32] he can't shake you anymore because you
[1:18:34] know that you know
[1:18:36] and when he starts coming and talking to
[1:18:37] you get away from me the word is says so
[1:18:40] so so it's been revealed to me praise
[1:18:43] god hallelujah i know it by revelation
[1:18:47] no the pastor didn't give me the deacon
[1:18:49] didn't give me it's the holy ghost that
[1:18:52] gave me praise god and it lines back up
[1:18:55] with the word it lines up with the
[1:18:57] entire message from genesis to
[1:19:00] revelation
[1:19:02] most that's why brother branham said you
[1:19:04] know the revelation that you will get
[1:19:06] most of the time it'll take you from
[1:19:08] genesis you may be right away you can't
[1:19:10] see it but it will always take you from
[1:19:12] genesis right back to revelation
[1:19:15] right back to revelation it runs through
[1:19:17] the entire bible because it's all in him
[1:19:20] it's all in him
[1:19:22] and he is perfect every everything
[1:19:26] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:19:28] hallelujah but remember
[1:19:30] revelation of god
[1:19:34] must come for each age
[1:19:37] and it only comes
[1:19:39] at a specific time
[1:19:43] you could have received the message been
[1:19:44] listening to the prophet of malachi 4-5
[1:19:47] for 40 years
[1:19:49] and that's fine
[1:19:50] but the revelation of what he has said
[1:19:53] and what he has he's put out in the
[1:19:56] storehouse he said that is only going to
[1:19:59] be revealed at a specific time
[1:20:03] and you remember also i've always used
[1:20:05] that quote he said they will know when
[1:20:08] it is time for them to know and i
[1:20:11] believe now is the time i believe this
[1:20:14] is the hour it's breaking everywhere
[1:20:17] brothers are catching the word of god
[1:20:20] catching the revelation of the word of
[1:20:22] god not just the written word but the
[1:20:25] revelation of the word of god hallelujah
[1:20:28] oh blessed be the name of god i give god
[1:20:32] praise and honor and glory amen think of
[1:20:37] it some of them getting it by education
[1:20:41] oh they think they get it by education
[1:20:44] oh but the spiritual sages of god are
[1:20:48] getting it by revelation oh hallelujah
[1:20:52] oh praise god and let me tell you
[1:20:55] i'm quoting brother branham here one by
[1:20:58] revelation one by education
[1:21:00] or if we can just open that up you
[1:21:04] because you know there is lots of
[1:21:07] material laying behind that there amen
[1:21:12] praise god hallelujah one by education
[1:21:15] and one by revelation
[1:21:17] hallelujah o praise god so the church
[1:21:21] is really built
[1:21:23] on the individual
[1:21:25] revelation
[1:21:26] of who do you
[1:21:29] say that i am
[1:21:31] praise god hallelujah oh my think of it
[1:21:36] oh my
[1:21:39] now you cannot make a holy church
[1:21:42] there is no holy church nor no holy
[1:21:47] organization
[1:21:49] you know if you even take this message
[1:21:52] and start thinking one particular church
[1:21:55] is a holy church you're right off the
[1:21:57] word right there
[1:21:59] see god
[1:22:01] did not send the prophet to set up
[1:22:04] shrines
[1:22:07] sacred
[1:22:08] places
[1:22:10] he did not even he did not even pray god
[1:22:13] will make his bones sacred
[1:22:17] even though we know just as elijah's
[1:22:20] bones the quickening power will still be
[1:22:23] there with him
[1:22:24] but that does not mean that we have to
[1:22:27] go and pray by his grave
[1:22:30] it doesn't mean that his grave has to
[1:22:33] become an international shrine
[1:22:36] we respect it we love him we recognize
[1:22:40] who and what he represents but my
[1:22:42] friends the glory of god is in this
[1:22:45] world
[1:22:46] the power of god is in this world
[1:22:49] the revelation of god is in this word
[1:22:52] hallelujah there is no such thing as
[1:22:55] some holy church all the organization
[1:22:58] yes the holy spirit can be preached in
[1:23:01] it but in that
[1:23:04] group that
[1:23:05] you'll find good
[1:23:07] you will find the bad
[1:23:09] you'll find the renegades you'll find
[1:23:12] the indifferent you'll find everything
[1:23:16] else
[1:23:17] hidden in there see
[1:23:19] er
[1:23:20] no organization or group can hold see
[1:23:25] you can't say
[1:23:26] we got it
[1:23:29] none of the rest of them has it
[1:23:31] for the holy spirit is not poured out on
[1:23:35] groups it's poured out on individuals
[1:23:40] let me repeat it's the individual
[1:23:44] praise the name of the lord hallelujah
[1:23:47] oh my oh praise god now all down to the
[1:23:52] edges they receive the holy spirit but
[1:23:55] not in the measure we have it now
[1:23:59] praise god because the look it's been
[1:24:01] rising higher and higher the octaves
[1:24:03] going higher and higher the tide rising
[1:24:07] higher and higher and now we have to
[1:24:10] battle against all the demons of all the
[1:24:13] other ages and so god had to raise the
[1:24:16] standard oh praise god and the measure
[1:24:19] of the holy spirit they he said they
[1:24:22] don't have it in the measure we have it
[1:24:25] now because this is a restoration back
[1:24:29] to the first hallelujah
[1:24:32] amen now he's talking to the church ages
[1:24:34] there so he's talking about going back
[1:24:36] to the original pentecost but what we're
[1:24:38] talking about now is going right back to
[1:24:40] jesus christ the seed
[1:24:44] is that right
[1:24:45] going right back to the original seed
[1:24:48] where we come from the mind of god and
[1:24:51] we're going back to the mind of god but
[1:24:53] before you go to that you got to pass
[1:24:55] through the original church age thing
[1:24:58] right you got to pass through that but
[1:25:00] we are back to the original seed where
[1:25:03] god is making himself known through the
[1:25:07] individuals blessed be the name of the
[1:25:10] living god
[1:25:12] now
[1:25:14] he said
[1:25:15] this tabernacle here
[1:25:18] we'll say
[1:25:19] this is where
[1:25:21] he comes to church
[1:25:23] this
[1:25:24] tabernacle is not a holy ghost
[1:25:28] tabernacle
[1:25:30] there is no such a thing
[1:25:33] it's talking about the building
[1:25:35] right it doesn't matter whether it's
[1:25:37] this building that building even this
[1:25:39] building that we're sitting in here
[1:25:40] today that he's talking about he's
[1:25:43] saying this tabernacle this building is
[1:25:46] not a holy ghost tabernacle
[1:25:49] you see
[1:25:51] individuals that come into this
[1:25:55] church
[1:25:56] is the holy ghost tabernacles
[1:25:59] hallelujah they are the tabernacles that
[1:26:03] really contain the holy ghost but not
[1:26:06] the church not the group amen for there
[1:26:10] it runs out hallelujah praise god these
[1:26:15] individual tabernacles are in that
[1:26:18] tabernacle or in that building or in
[1:26:21] that group praise god hallelujah oh
[1:26:24] blessed be the name aren't you glad to
[1:26:26] be one of them amen
[1:26:29] now remember
[1:26:31] individual the power
[1:26:33] of prevailing
[1:26:35] revelation
[1:26:36] to the individual
[1:26:39] everyone has to live a private life
[1:26:42] with god
[1:26:44] for it's an individual private
[1:26:47] individual affair with these things of
[1:26:50] the spirit that carries you off into
[1:26:52] places that sometimes you dare not even
[1:26:56] speak of
[1:26:57] oh praise god hallelujah oh praise god
[1:27:02] i'm so glad for that because that is the
[1:27:04] truth now
[1:27:05] the pregnant person with the seed of god
[1:27:10] there alone is enough there for you to
[1:27:12] chew on
[1:27:15] the word
[1:27:17] in there now manifesting itself
[1:27:23] so surrendered to the will of god
[1:27:26] that the word and the word alone
[1:27:30] begins to manifest itself
[1:27:34] through that person
[1:27:37] that prisoner
[1:27:41] that individual
[1:27:43] hallelujah what he's saying here that
[1:27:46] when the person really catches a true
[1:27:48] revelation
[1:27:49] it starts
[1:27:51] helping them to clean up their life
[1:27:54] until he
[1:27:55] uh he begins to project himself in a
[1:27:58] clearer and brighter
[1:28:01] manifestation of his divine person
[1:28:04] through the individual
[1:28:06] and that makes them use the word
[1:28:09] prisoner a prisoner to christ the
[1:28:11] anointed world it makes them a prisoner
[1:28:14] to the world hallelujah praise god i
[1:28:17] wonder how many prisoners are in here i
[1:28:19] believe i'm one of them
[1:28:22] i believe i'm one of them
[1:28:25] i i like i always said it's too late for
[1:28:28] me to turn back now
[1:28:30] it's too late for me to stumble along
[1:28:32] the way
[1:28:33] hallelujah pressing on the upward way
[1:28:36] praise god now
[1:28:38] it's to the individual
[1:28:41] listen close
[1:28:43] and all hell
[1:28:45] is against this teaching
[1:28:48] now i've always read that and believed
[1:28:51] that it meant just everything that he
[1:28:54] said his entire message the devil is
[1:28:56] against his entire of course the devil
[1:28:58] is but what he was emphasizing here now
[1:29:01] the devil is against this teaching of
[1:29:05] him showing that the individual
[1:29:08] revelation is the foundation of the
[1:29:10] anti-church of the living god hallelujah
[1:29:14] and all hell is against this truth
[1:29:18] and it is the truth for jesus never said
[1:29:22] peter you and john and all the rest of
[1:29:24] you you've got the revelation now uh the
[1:29:27] whole church is saved because you got it
[1:29:31] no he says
[1:29:34] jesus said
[1:29:36] it's to you
[1:29:38] unto him personally i say unto thee
[1:29:42] peter
[1:29:44] hallelujah
[1:29:46] he didn't say but i'm calling brother
[1:29:48] branham he didn't say not to them
[1:29:51] right but to thee
[1:29:53] thou art peter
[1:29:55] and upon this rock of individual
[1:29:58] revelation to one individual person upon
[1:30:02] this rock is what i'm gonna build my
[1:30:04] church and the
[1:30:07] gates of hell will not prevail against
[1:30:10] it hallelujah flesh and blood has not
[1:30:12] revealed this unto you but upon this
[1:30:15] revelation
[1:30:17] amen i'll build my church
[1:30:21] listen
[1:30:22] in them
[1:30:24] right
[1:30:25] in them
[1:30:27] and all the gates say hell will never be
[1:30:30] able to prevail against that or
[1:30:33] withstand that amen praise god
[1:30:35] hallelujah well of course he's telling
[1:30:37] you ahead of time prepare for a battle
[1:30:41] because all hell is going loose against
[1:30:43] that teaching
[1:30:44] all hell is going to be loose against
[1:30:46] you when you realize your importance of
[1:30:49] who you really are and what is inside
[1:30:52] you
[1:30:53] sometimes you're going to even wonder
[1:30:54] when you're on your job where you're on
[1:30:56] the street why why did that person get
[1:30:58] angry at me for no reason
[1:31:00] why did that person want to lash out
[1:31:02] against me
[1:31:03] i didn't do them anything i tried to be
[1:31:05] good do everything i can for them and
[1:31:07] all of a sudden they hit me for what
[1:31:10] and you don't know but that devil knows
[1:31:12] what is in you
[1:31:14] hallelujah and he hates the revelation
[1:31:17] of jesus christ that's reflecting itself
[1:31:20] through you effortlessly
[1:31:23] you don't have to walk around trying to
[1:31:24] be a christian
[1:31:26] or let people see you that you're
[1:31:28] praying at six o'clock early in the
[1:31:29] morning
[1:31:30] and that you're uh this man is always up
[1:31:33] very early at 4 30 and he's walking down
[1:31:36] in the gardens with his book open
[1:31:39] praying what a godly man what a godly
[1:31:42] woman amen amongst the world we're going
[1:31:46] to have a fast from fish on a certain
[1:31:49] day oh
[1:31:50] what does man sacrifices all life that
[1:31:54] he might live for you see it's not based
[1:31:57] on that it's based on the revelation of
[1:32:01] the word of god and the power of the
[1:32:03] holy spirit in the life of the
[1:32:05] individual and the devil hates that when
[1:32:08] you recognize that and you you realize
[1:32:11] what god is doing with you amen praise
[1:32:14] god hallelujah
[1:32:16] all the gates of hell
[1:32:20] will never
[1:32:22] come be able to withstand that
[1:32:25] and just after that listen what he says
[1:32:27] and not one hair on your heads will
[1:32:31] perish
[1:32:33] hallelujah because when the devil comes
[1:32:35] he knows coming against you as an
[1:32:37] individual and most of the time you can
[1:32:39] wait while you are by yourself you got
[1:32:41] no helper wrong you know other brother
[1:32:43] you can call on the only person you can
[1:32:46] call is look onto the rock from whence
[1:32:47] come with your help your help coming
[1:32:49] from him oh above christ god that's
[1:32:52] where you got to look for your help
[1:32:54] praise the name of the lord jesus amen
[1:32:57] there is the revelation there it is
[1:33:00] it's never to them
[1:33:03] but it's to him
[1:33:06] an individual
[1:33:08] not to a group
[1:33:11] but to he repeats an individual
[1:33:14] all hell is against that
[1:33:18] that's what the the devil is against
[1:33:20] hallelujah and so you see
[1:33:24] his mystery is really only revealed to
[1:33:28] his beloved bride and no one else can
[1:33:32] see it
[1:33:33] hallelujah but god reveals it
[1:33:36] to his beloved bride can i share some
[1:33:39] more things with you here
[1:33:42] praise the name of the lord hallelujah i
[1:33:44] don't want to run so far ahead
[1:33:47] that you're not seeing me anymore and
[1:33:48] you can't follow

[1:34:47] the written word
[1:34:50] i hope a lot of brothers would
[1:34:53] but see this and recognize what he's
[1:34:55] saying it's not that you put away the
[1:34:56] bible you're not going to read the bible
[1:34:58] you don't know what the bible says but
[1:35:00] he's saying that is not what if they had
[1:35:03] that for hundreds or hundreds of years
[1:35:05] and it didn't get any better it's a
[1:35:07] revelation that elevates the church and
[1:35:10] puts her in the rapture amen you see
[1:35:14] blessed be his holy name
[1:35:16] for his god himself must reveal it to an
[1:35:19] individual and quickly

[1:35:54] enthronement in you the individual by
[1:35:58] the revelation of the affair with the
[1:36:00] word of god hallelujah then if the
[1:36:03] personal individual

[1:36:08] you
[1:36:09] and you say
[1:36:11] he's been revealed to me
[1:36:14] then the life
[1:36:16] of christ
[1:36:17] produced here in the bible
[1:36:20] that same life that was in him
[1:36:24] if that does not produce itself
[1:36:27] in you
[1:36:28] you've got the wrong revelation

[1:36:45] begin to project
[1:36:49] working out your salvation
[1:36:52] day by day
[1:36:54] and moving you from glory on to glory

[1:43:23] for you are the one
[1:43:25] that has to make that testimony
[1:43:29] individually oh not my church and being

[1:43:33] godly church no it's you the individual
[1:43:37] for each one of you has got to answer to
[1:43:40] god now
[1:43:42] for the revelation
[1:43:46] hallelujah
[1:43:48] you got the answer to god
[1:43:50] for the revelation
[1:43:52] what did you do with the pearl of great
[1:43:55] price
[1:43:56] that god placed in your heart what did
[1:43:59] you do with that it's just he said here
[1:44:02] like on the day of pentecost people were
[1:44:05] laughing at them and saying what they're
[1:44:08] talking about these men are just full of
[1:44:11] new wine that's why they're talking that
[1:44:13] way
[1:44:14] amen they weren't too far gone
[1:44:17] they had new wine in them
[1:44:20] but it was different from what they were
[1:44:22] thinking right now wha
[1:44:24] you see why you see it was god that's
[1:44:28] what was happening
[1:44:30] it was god revealing himself to them
[1:44:33] individuals and that's what made them
[1:44:36] behave that way
[1:44:37] they are saying tongues
[1:44:40] they don't understand
[1:44:43] what got them so excited and make them
[1:44:45] start jabbering and jibbering and
[1:44:48] speaking in tongues
[1:44:50] it was not the tongues that got them
[1:44:52] filled with the holy ghost but they got
[1:44:54] filled with the holy ghost by the
[1:44:56] revelation of what the holy ghost was
[1:44:59] revealing to them and they got so
[1:45:01] excited with it they tried to talk to
[1:45:04] one another and their words start coming
[1:45:06] out like that amen you see they were
[1:45:10] rejoicing because it was the
[1:45:14] individual revelation
[1:45:17] which is faith that was being revealed
[1:45:22] hallelujah and that's what it was all
[1:45:24] about amen praise god hallelujah oh
[1:45:28] praise god each one of them receiving
[1:45:30] and now
[1:45:32] this is our time isn't it
[1:45:34] this is pentecost back there i'm quoting
[1:45:36] from trying to do god's service without
[1:45:38] it being god's will but now
[1:45:41] this is
[1:45:43] the pride calling
[1:45:45] this is the calling of the bride the
[1:45:47] seven seals have been opened
[1:45:50] your names is what is referring to there
[1:45:52] your name's now being called praise god
[1:45:56] and the complete things that them
[1:45:57] reformers and all them is now opened up
[1:46:01] to you amen hallelujah it takes the
[1:46:04] revelation straight from god to the
[1:46:06] individual to do so it can't come to
[1:46:10] that group
[1:46:12] no
[1:46:13] it has never done
[1:46:16] one man
[1:46:18] one person
[1:46:20] individual
[1:46:21] it is always that way
[1:46:24] that's what god promised
[1:46:27] in the shadows of the coming
[1:46:30] for his bride
[1:46:31] praise the lord here and i wrote a note
[1:46:34] there rebecca
[1:46:38] rebecca
[1:46:40] when that messenger came to her
[1:46:43] he came to her
[1:46:46] and she saw that she had the qualities
[1:46:49] of hearing and so on in her
[1:46:52] she went to her
[1:46:54] uh to her family and told them
[1:46:57] what who this man was what happened to
[1:46:59] him and this and that and then what
[1:47:01] happened the oscar will thou go
[1:47:04] with this man
[1:47:07] whatever he told her about isaac
[1:47:10] without seeing him with her eyes
[1:47:14] she said yes i will go
[1:47:16] amen and that's what we did we haven't
[1:47:19] seen him yet but but
[1:47:22] we have heard but the the hour is coming
[1:47:25] now you see praise god oh my she said i
[1:47:29] will go with this man amen praise god
[1:47:32] and she accompanied the messenger
[1:47:35] talking with him along the way which
[1:47:36] brother branham has done and sharing
[1:47:38] with us all the wonderful things about
[1:47:41] isaac he did this he did that he's that
[1:47:43] kind of person he's this kind of person
[1:47:45] and she asked all the questions
[1:47:46] questions and answers and everything
[1:47:48] else and you know honey begins to answer
[1:47:50] and talk all the way but the bible says
[1:47:55] isaac loved to go for a walk
[1:47:58] and as he was walking in the fields
[1:48:01] praise god remember jesus is going to
[1:48:03] meet us in the air
[1:48:05] halfway right while she was yet on her
[1:48:08] way she looked and saw this man
[1:48:12] walking in the fields
[1:48:14] oh praise god hallelujah and she said
[1:48:17] it's that and he said yes behold the
[1:48:19] lamb of god this is the man
[1:48:22] oh praise god hallelujah
[1:48:25] oh
[1:48:26] my
[1:48:27] listen go read the scripture she lifted
[1:48:29] up her eyes she's not looking at the
[1:48:31] sceneries and all these churches and all
[1:48:33] these kind of beautiful things and
[1:48:35] wonderful things around her she lifted
[1:48:37] up her eyes oh my and the bible says and
[1:48:40] she looked
[1:48:42] but then it says a very important thing
[1:48:45] after that and she saw praise god when
[1:48:49] you look what do you see
[1:48:51] what do you recognize amen oh praise god
[1:48:55] the rest of the love story you know she
[1:48:58] jumped off the camel and run towards him
[1:49:01] amen and he runs towards her
[1:49:04] the deep calling to the deep they
[1:49:06] recognize one another the word calling
[1:49:09] back to the word amen oh bless god i was
[1:49:13] reading there brother branham said that
[1:49:15] he said the wolf called he said and they
[1:49:18] answer their make answers in the valley
[1:49:21] the eagles screamed hallelujah and he
[1:49:24] says now jesus calls from his word amen
[1:49:28] hallelujah calling to what calling and
[1:49:31] he uses the word he is now calling to
[1:49:33] his mate amen calling out to his mate
[1:49:37] amen oh praise god hallelujah i'm
[1:49:40] closing with this quote
[1:49:43] now
[1:49:44] this is expressed to one person relative
[1:49:48] to the word only one messenger comes to
[1:49:52] each age and receives what the spirit
[1:49:56] is saying to that age
[1:49:58] that one messenger
[1:50:01] to the true church
[1:50:03] he speaks for god
[1:50:06] by revelation to all the churches bought
[1:50:10] true
[1:50:12] and false
[1:50:14] right he's speaking to both true and
[1:50:17] false
[1:50:19] he speaks for god
[1:50:21] by revelation
[1:50:23] the message
[1:50:26] is then broadcast
[1:50:28] to all
[1:50:30] everybody hears his message
[1:50:33] but
[1:50:34] so it has brought cast for all who come
[1:50:37] within range of his message
[1:50:41] the message
[1:50:43] is received only individually
[1:50:49] by only a certain qualified group
[1:50:54] in a certain way
[1:50:57] each
[1:50:58] individual
[1:51:00] of of that group
[1:51:02] is the ones who have the ability to hear
[1:51:06] what the spirit is saying
[1:51:08] by the way
[1:51:10] of the messenger
[1:51:13] and those who here
[1:51:15] are not getting their own private
[1:51:17] revelation
[1:51:18] that i used to first of all uh you might
[1:51:21] have had that problem i had that problem
[1:51:24] when i was crossing over from just uh
[1:51:27] you know written word to revealed word
[1:51:30] and like that and what are these things
[1:51:35] where am i getting these ideas is
[1:51:37] am i making these things up in my own
[1:51:39] mind or the devil starts playing tricks
[1:51:42] with you
[1:51:43] to try to tell you oh that's you just
[1:51:45] you
[1:51:46] it's not a private interpretation
[1:51:50] it's the holy spirit revealing himself
[1:51:52] to you see
[1:51:54] oh my see those who hear this are not
[1:51:58] getting their own private revelation nor
[1:52:00] is it a group getting a collective
[1:52:03] revelation there's no uh william branham
[1:52:06] group getting a collective revelation
[1:52:08] they got a collective message but
[1:52:11] they're not getting a collective
[1:52:12] revelation
[1:52:14] see oh my
[1:52:16] but each person individual again
[1:52:19] hearing
[1:52:21] and receiving you can hear it and not
[1:52:24] receive it but hearing and receiving
[1:52:27] what the messenger
[1:52:29] has already
[1:52:31] received from god
[1:52:34] hallelujah so
[1:52:36] we are now seeing what one man
[1:52:40] already saw
[1:52:43] it's nothing new that we're adding on
[1:52:45] making uptake in a way nothing like that
[1:52:48] you maybe don't understand that you may
[1:52:50] be in seeing it but this is what the
[1:52:52] messenger already had and this is the
[1:52:55] hour when they will know when they are
[1:52:59] time for them to know and we are knowing
[1:53:01] it now as it's being revealed to us by
[1:53:04] the holy spirit and i want to praise god
[1:53:06] come on up
[1:53:08] musicians and i want to praise and thank
[1:53:10] god that i can say like bartenders i was
[1:53:14] blind but now i see
[1:53:16] oh praise god once sat alone by the
[1:53:20] highway begging his eyes were blind he
[1:53:23] could not see but thank god this message
[1:53:26] the word of god has been revealed amen
[1:53:29] oh praise god i thank god everybody
[1:53:32] making claims of of catching revelation
[1:53:36] the devil isn't confusing trying to
[1:53:38] confuse even at this stage where we're
[1:53:41] talking about revelation revelation
[1:53:43] revelation everybody all of a sudden
[1:53:45] we're talking about catching revelation
[1:53:48] but you know what
[1:53:49] you're gonna know
[1:53:51] because if you have it the genuine
[1:53:53] revelation and you hear it you see it
[1:53:57] you discern it
[1:53:59] the watchmen on the walls of zion are
[1:54:01] going to see eye to eye
[1:54:04] you don't even have to know the
[1:54:05] individual you don't have to know them
[1:54:07] they just start talking and you see the
[1:54:09] whole thing fits fits fits fifth fifth
[1:54:11] fifth fifth and you know they got the
[1:54:13] same thing you got you got nothing
[1:54:15] different we give god the praise and so
[1:54:17] it's supernatural and the devil hates it
[1:54:19] because it's not nobody organizing a
[1:54:22] bride organizing a group it's nobody's
[1:54:25] hands in getting all the ministers
[1:54:27] together it's not anybody's hands and
[1:54:30] pulling all the churches together no
[1:54:32] that's the job of the holy spirit
[1:54:35] working in the individuals and letting
[1:54:38] them do it not because of emotions
[1:54:41] because of loving this brother loving
[1:54:43] that sister loving this group or loving
[1:54:45] that group no it's the holy spirit will
[1:54:48] do it on an individual basis and all the
[1:54:52] redeemed are going to be gathered in for
[1:54:54] the glory of god hallelujah you got a

[1:59:36] want to work
[1:59:37] walk with your own extra for purchasing
[1:59:41] anything else you're going to see there

[2:00:21] all the pillars
[2:00:23] tumbled down broken down not one left on

[2:00:29] something for you to go and see even if
[2:00:32] it's once twice three times in your life
[2:00:34] for me i've gone there seven times
[2:00:37] and i want to go for the eighth time
[2:00:40] i believe that will be the last time i
[2:00:43] will
[2:00:44] return there praise god but i want to do
[2:00:48] it for this uh it time and praise god
[2:00:52] his god hasn't gotten old-fashioned to
[2:00:54] me but every time something newer
[2:00:58] is revealed and made known to me we will
[2:01:02] stay again uh some different hotels
[2:01:06] better
[2:01:07] newer
[2:01:08] and the last place we'll sit ramat
[2:01:11] rachel
[2:01:12] hotel which i know
[2:01:15] is near
[2:01:16] by the
[2:01:17] mediterranean
[2:01:19] and
[2:01:20] you know
[2:01:21] this beautiful site and then from there
[2:01:23] we go up to jerusalem you know jerusalem
[2:01:26] is on a hill down hills
[2:01:29] we go up to jerusalem and then we'll
[2:01:32] spend time in there
[2:01:34] walking around seeing where jesus was
[2:01:36] imprisoned seeing where the valley that
[2:01:39] they led him over to the pilot's
[2:01:42] judgment hall
[2:01:44] we'll see all of that and uh
[2:01:46] where they prayed in the garden the
[2:01:48] olive trees are still there after
[2:01:52] thousands of years they are still alive
[2:01:55] and they're still growing
[2:01:57] maybe some are dead i don't know but
[2:01:59] most of them are still there
[2:02:02] in the garden the only thing you'll have
[2:02:05] to put up with
[2:02:06] is the catholics have gone in there and
[2:02:09] quickly they bought up a lot of these
[2:02:11] places
[2:02:12] and built cathedrals around them and put
[2:02:15] a wall or whatever and of course
[2:02:18] you you you either have to pay to go in
[2:02:21] to see some of it but like i said all of
[2:02:23] that is think care of but the fact is
[2:02:26] that um
[2:02:28] i was thinking when i first went that my
[2:02:32] that um
[2:02:33] they've got everything they take up all
[2:02:36] mary's well and this place and that way
[2:02:39] they've gone all over the place
[2:02:42] and i was
[2:02:43] it was
[2:02:44] no i made them do that to preserve it
[2:02:48] for you
[2:02:51] you know if god didn't use them to
[2:02:54] preserve those places
[2:02:57] the prevailing um culture of that place
[2:03:01] they would have broke up all those
[2:03:02] things and tear them down
[2:03:04] they get rid of all the things of jesus
[2:03:07] christ and christianity but i use them
[2:03:10] to preserve those things
[2:03:12] that you might be able to go and see
[2:03:14] them
[2:03:15] hallelujah so i thank god for them that
[2:03:17] god bless them
