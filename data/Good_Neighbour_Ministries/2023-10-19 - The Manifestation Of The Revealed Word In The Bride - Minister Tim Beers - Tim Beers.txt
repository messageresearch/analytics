gathered I'll be in the midst and I know there's two or three that he not only is gathering but he's indwelling in amen so he's here it's a matter of us to uh allow our faith to move into another dimension Amen Let us move move on up to another dimension tonight amen God bless you Saints amen let's turn to the word we're going to go in Mark 11:22 then Romans 8:15 I want to speak on um I was going to continue on my series on the law and Grace but the Lord put something on my heart here and uh I want to speak on the manifestation of the revealed word in the bride manifestation is has been a a word that's been striking me amen so let us see what the Lord will have laid a little Foundation here here tonight and uh we want to get into some a few things here today amen hallelujah let us pray father we thank you Lord for this gathering tonight Lord of Light precious Faith father within the saints of God lord is it's not about the speaker here it's not about the hearer it's about you father you said if I be lifted up I'll draw all man unto me Lord father it's not about lifting up anybody but you tonight Lord and that's why we want to be where you are father Lord so Lift us up into Heavenly places Lord in our Spirits in our experience tonight Lord and may we see you glorified may we see you sitting at the right hand of the father tonight Lord may we see your word manifest father not only in our midst but in our lives oh God Lord grant these things tonight father take full pre and some full control Lord father we claim this this this area Lord we claim the atmospheres father for your honor and your glory Lord let the angels of God we command them come and fellowship with us come and move in our midst tonight keep all evil away and cast all demons out in the name of Jesus Christ keep a wall of fire and a hedge around us Lord Keep Your Glory around us oh God tonight father Lord grant these things so we may Lord glorify your Wonderful Wonderful Name Lord we're looking to thee Oh God for all things Lord because you're the only one that can provide all our needs Lord let there be Faith sufficient Faith here tonight Lord and may we leave different than we came in and may our hearts burn within us oh God as you speak to us along the way Lord grant these things in Jesus name we ask amen amen Mark 11:22 and Jesus answered and said unto them them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but he sh but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire When you pray believe in that you receive them and ye shall have them and when you stand praying forgive for ye have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive your trespasses let's go to Romans 8:15 amen forgiveness forgiveness is always about forgiveness we can't get anywhere tonight if we got an Unforgiven heart or we haven't forgiven somebody that's just is going to block the Holy Spirit from you not from me maybe not from some but whoever it is forgiveness Romans 815 for you for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear we heard we heard about fear last week but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father the spirit itself bear witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children than hirs and Heirs of God and Joint HS with Christ oh my I mean join HS and hes with him so everything that he is I am everything that he did I can do all power in Heaven and Earth was given unto him where is he so be that you suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that which shall be revealed in US of course not because all the suffering that we go through all the trials and is bringing his glory within us that's why Peter said rejoice when you come into many Temptations and trials Rejoice because glory is the next thing that's coming for the creatures was made subject to vanity not willingly but but but by reason of him who had subject the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our bodies God bless you as just seat it amen there's so much in here my brothers and sisters Hallelujah glory to God the manifestation you know there's a a great movement out there and I was thinking about um uh uh uh brother Danny's uh testimony of um you know before he came to the Lord he was in that movement of uh positive mental thinking and you know that's a great movement out there with the universe and uh the laws of God that they're using out there and and we don't realize that that you know sometimes they and doesn't even a scriptures say in Luke uh that the children of this world are wiser than the children of light be because of the fact they know the laws of God they know what God has delivered they might call it the universe amen we know who the universe is amen we we we not only tonight we want to look at um you know the laws of God we want to look at what they're looking at in the universe and all what God does right but we want to bring it back back to the Creator amen we don't just got the universe like they do right they they got all the laws of God that they're operating in but we got him amen we got him and that's a very uh very important difference to recognize in him Hallelujah but also recognize that we got the same Authority and power and even more to operate in this realm Hallelujah I'm just trying to lay something here and get out my thoughts here amen because they are operating in the Supernatural it is the spiritual that they're operating in they're bringing things into manifestation in their lives and changes in their lives amen because they're using what God has given them not not glorifying or crediting who it is that gave these laws but they're using them and they're manifesting them and that's why he says the children of this world are wiser than the children of light amen because we need to break into this amen and never before in this hour Hallelujah I don't know about you but when I hear the prophet and I and I see his life right what was manifested around his life was not natural natur Al it was Supernatural he was operating in the spiritual realm Hallelujah he was in between Heaven and Earth all the time Hallelujah and that's no different for us though we're not a prophet we don't got that part but our part that we got is going to operate in the same Dimension that he operated in to bring it to pass to bring it into manifestation that's that's where God operates and that's how the word comes to pass Hallelujah to receive a manifestation the promises of God must be received by faith must be received by faith it's impossible to please God impossible to go anywhere or make the next step if it is not by faith this walk and the just shall live by faith everything is by faith not by our understanding and our reasoning amen or how we can figure it out or put it all together it's by faith we walk in faith sometimes you don't know the next step sometimes you don't understand everything that's going on when it's by faith the the word we have received must be mixed with faith in our hearts and that's how to see the manifestation you may receive Hebrews 11:6 but without faith it's impossible to please him manifesting is not about attracting what you want manifesting is the awareness and understanding that you attract what you are they attract what they want and sometimes we pray amen sometimes we ask God in our lives for things that we want but that's not attracting the manifestation by the spirit of faith and Revelation in this hour for the Bride of Jesus Christ we want to attract who we are we want to attract our portion we want to attct how the Holy Ghost will use us in our lives and fall in line with that and when you see yourself falling in line with who you are and what God made you to be then you start seeing manifestations around your life of the supernatural you start seeing that word coming to pass amen what is the word made flesh is when the word starts manifesting when you and the word become one in the same amen your agreement you aligned your attitude your thinking in your thoughts your heart your soul with that word that's being revealed to you and then the manifestation starts taking place in your life so manifest the manifestation is about attrac in who you are not what you want Hallelujah remember let's go back into the scriptures here the greatest manifestation hallelujah or the greatest law of attraction scripture that has been given to us is what we read now if you listen to Jesus just going back here that whosoever shall say unto this mountain now you're saying unto this mountain because you're saying it by faith because you know in your life in your situation God has given you a word he always gives us a word in our situations he never leaves us or forsakes US in any area of our lives so he knows what's coming today he knows what's coming tomorrow he knows every test and trial because he approves it and he always gives a word to you sometimes it's wait sometimes it's be still but he always gives a word and that's the word that you got to speak to your mountain and your situation sometimes oh you trial oh you pain and heartache you're just going to work for the glory of God you're going to work for my good oh think about it said of crying I didn't say we cry ABA father didn't mean crying like that oh no the spirit of God the spirit of Revelation is going back to the father saying amen amen Lord hallelujah glory to God I agree Lord I agree what you have for my life what you're doing in my life oh Lord be thou removed and cast into the sea and shall not shall not doubt in his heart that's the problem got to get doubt Faith sometimes God gives us faith faith is starting to bring it to you you talk about Law of Attraction you're talk about the universe bringing it to you oh my when faith comes to you when God speaks something to you when he promises it to you it's already been released it's been released from the other dimension because God spoke it it's no difference than when God said let there be light and there was light no difference when he walked this Earth and he cursed the Fig Tree and he spoke to the Sea and the mountains amen it's no different when God speaks You by faith it's already been released and Satan knows there's a disturbance going on in a religious real in your life he sees the light coming amen he sees things changing in your life and then he comes with all these Petty things I call them Petty things that he can try to pull you with you see that's why Jesus said Satan come to me but he had nothing to pull on me Hallelujah and that's where God wants to get you to that place amen oh my I believe the Rapture is going to be such a continuing uh uh a process uh a a uh what word am I looking for it's just going to be like a a a a veyor belt just going boom boom boom one prophecy after another happening in our lives amen that's what it's going to be like when when we get and we realize one thing we got ourselves out of the way God dealt with us all these years to get this flesh out of the way get our own interpretation out of the way and then all of a sudden we start receiving the faith quicker quicker quicker obedience and we start walking in it walking in the Supernatural then we start seeing the manifestation this is the time to fight Saints this is the time to press in to the kingdom of God all Darkness Leo seeing the darkest ages here now amongst us don't think you don't have to fight you got to fight you don't fight you don't fight he'll get you he'll trap you you got to fight you got to take this word stay on top of this word stay on fire with this word don't let this lay your seeing cold I can't get off this I'm just going to do what the spirit tells me to do this this this cold lay seeing Spirit on you my brothers and sisters we should not be coming into church and feeling any coldness in here it should be fire in here it should be the Holy Ghost in here moving there's a bride that's coming into Rapture in faith Amen in this hour hallelujah it's up to you it's not up to the preacher it's not up to the pastor to keep you on fire it's up to you to stay on fire with God it's up to you to overcome it's up to you to step out by faith amen hallelujah glory to God wouldn't it be nice when that day comes when you don't need any preacher you don't need the fivefold ministry and what I mean by that is not maybe you're not going to need any preaching but you come in here you don't need to get pumped up amen you come in here pumped up amen you come in here on fire I love to see somebody more on fire than I am glory to God Amen come in here on fire oh my Hallelujah help me Lord Jesus amen glory to God thank you Lord you talk about positive this is Way Beyond positive mental there's some there's some mental issues going on there with their posit but not here amen what is the manifestation of the spirit the Greek word translate manifestation means to display to show a demonstration to give evidence the Holy Spirit displays God's power through each of us as the means of helping the entire church in each of of us the spirit manifests in one particular way for some useful purpose the Holy Spirit wants to give you a supernatural manifestation this is what this is the power that will work in you to get you to get your prayers answered to give you the victory in every area of your life and bring perfect faith and perfect realization in who who you are and your calling oh my not praying a myth oh you understand you understand how to pray you know let's get this denominational way of thinking of praying out of our heads amen we have been given a word amen we haven't not gone back to the the Pentecostal way of of praying Hallelujah we gone back to the Jesus way of praying the way Jesus prayed to the father is the way we pray to the father amen Jesus didn't cry out the Jesus didn't no Jesus knew who he was he knew his portion he knew what the father wanted him to fulfill he prayed in the spirit in that way that's how he's seen his prayers answered and manifestation after manifestation Supernatural after Supernatural getting this all this want I want I want what's good for my life Abundant Life oh live your Abundant Life live your perfect and and your your your full life now oh Lord manifestation as a broad topic as manifesting we can't get we can get very precise details on clearly identifying it but it is mainly understood as something put into your physical reality through your thoughts through your feelings through your faith through your beliefs meaning that whatever you focus on is what you bring into your reality you you see we look at these things and because we hear it so much out there hey we hear it so much out there that when we start listening to these things we automatically our religious legalistic spirit Rises up and says pushes us out listen it's not theirs it's ours it's yours this is what this is where it starts we we we we've heard it with the greatest battle ever fought it starts in the mind it starts it it started way back with God in the beginning God seen amen God visualized amen God spoke amen and then the word that he spoke which is him was manifested it's no different in our lives my brothers and sisters it starts in the thoughts God deals with our thoughts amen he speaks to our thoughts and he Reve heals to our thoughts his word he has to start every one of us individuals are different some receive Faith real strong real fast some receive it God knows the process of each and every one of us how to bring us to that place we're all different we're all individuals amen so but God speaks into our thoughts and he starts revealing in our thoughts and many times we leave it in our thoughts God in order to bring what we are are tonight who we are and the world into existence God had a process that he had to do and we're Made In His Image we got to bring forth that same process we got a battle amen we got a battle on our hands to go through that process because we bypass our theophany and we're working our theophany is being revealed more and more in US amen Jesus didn't bypass his theophany that's why he came as the anointed powerful Son of God speaking manifesting amen no delays in Jesus no doubting in Jesus just manifestation of God's Will and God's word that was in him to fulfill but we by past theophany so we have to move and grow into that and as faith and as we overcome that theophany is growing stronger and stronger and what is going to make us become my brothers and sisters in His image in his is likeness that's the manifestation that's the greatest manifestation that's taking place in this hour oh Miracles will come signs and wonders should be just the children's bread it should be just following us but we focus in this message we still focus on healing and miracles instead of moving in this perfect faith and this perfect realization and reality of God's word made flesh made real made a reality in our lives as individuals you may focus and manifest through meditation visualization or just your conscience or subconscious but if you don't mix it with faith you may end up not receiving your manifestation Hallelujah so don't stop visualizing don't God reveals something to you oh it's been so long so what Abraham 25 years he knew God couldn't fail he didn't stagger at the promises of God keep what's in your heart keep visualizing it start breaking into a real a spiritual real where you're bring it it what God has revealed to you to reality if you don't you know God when God seen he seen and he said it was good God seen it if you don't see it coming into manifestation that was the same process with God when God spoke his word he seen it he seen the animals he seen the land he seen the the the the air the darkness the light he's seen everything that he spoke into existence before it manifests and came in and that's the same process that we have to go through but we we have an adversary the devil is and tries to being unbelief and dealt didn't Jesus always say Lazareth was dead four days the daughter that died when he came he says don't doubt believe have faith you see what he was doing you understand what he was doing Hallelujah the hidden word is made visible when the word was hidden within God himself he was invisible to the created world but God made himself visible first God gave utterance to his voice and given rise to light from light and then he sent his own mind into the world visible before for God alone and not to the world but God made him visible the manifested word for this day so that the world could be saved by seeing him this mind that entered our world was made known as the Son of God all things came into being through him now I just can't have the time to break that down but my the son gave us the law and the prophets and he filled the prophets with the Holy Spirit to compel them to speak out inspired by the father's power they were to proclaim the father's purpose and his will you see God right from the beginning was always in control of everything you know God uses man God speaks through man but man is never in control God is always the one in control it's been his plan from the beginning and he'll follow it through right to the end when we realize that and recognize that in our lives what rest what peace it would bring to us that God is in control of your life your experience your situations your needs tonight he's always been in control the same God that called you will bring you R through he's the author and the finisher amen and all it is my brothers and sisters we come to realize as we grow and we mature in Christ we come to realize it's God that's in control he's always been in control and all you can look back and see you can see in your life the experiences the victories the overcoming power the things that God delivered you from blessed you with all you can see is the manifestation of God in your life Hallelujah and then you can look back and see all the areas where you got in the way you got in the way of him hidden word was made manifest so the word was made manifest as St John declares when summing up all the saints of the prophets he announced that this is the word through whom the universe was made he said in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God through him all things came into being not one thing was created without him and further he adds on that the worlds were made through him and yet the world did not know him he entered his own creation and his own creation did not receive him there's only going to be one class of people on the Earth in this last day and always have been that can receive him and that's those that are predestinated and called those that are a part of him the attribute in the seed of God can only receive him and I'm not talking about what he's going to do I'm not here nobody has the right in the fivefold ministry to take God's place in judgment amen and who's coming in who's going out that's none of our business hallelujah we're here just to preach preach the word and God didn't tell us to preach that amen who's coming in who's going out God is the judge he he said I will judge the motive and the attentions of the people's hearts I will show Mercy on who I show Mercy on Amen all we have to worry about and focus on Amen is giving our lives fully surrendered and completely over to Jesus Christ that attribute can do nothing in this day and age amen that attribute is driven Hallelujah it's driven in this hour to give a complete surrender what do you see when you see the wave sheet in our day what do you see what do you see when you look who do you see when you look what kind of life was manifested before you how how that that's the seed of God that came to maturity that's the seed of God Amen that became one with God you seen the word for for for for the day his day be made flesh it's no different in our day my brothers and sisters Hallelujah and when we see the word made manifest you see the father God because the word is the Father the word is God and the word made manifest is God himself taking his own word and manifested amongst Believers nothing can make it live in this hour and this day but Believers Sons and Daughters of God it's not for the church world but it's for the elected predestinated in this hour they're the ones that are going to make this word live again Hallelujah glory to God who are you tonight who are you tonight you come just to church to hear a good sermon to get tickled your ears get emotionally worked up who are you what have you been raised up for what have you been called in this hour for it it always brings the power it always bring when you come into a realization Jesus knew who he was Hallelujah that's why he can speak the way he speak with authority amen with power with demonstration because he knew who he was and he surrendered his life to who he was it's no different to us in your life that's why he says when a person comes to that place in their walk with God you go speak your world why you're not speaking a myth you're not speaking what you want but by faith you're seeing the word open up to you and God is saying to you speak that that I'm opening up to you that's your word world that's your portion that's your Victory that's your manifestation that I have for you in this hour oh my glory to God this thing is is is you know this thing I don't even know if I had the words very you know brother br let me put it this way just come to my thoughts brother Brown says if everybody here tonight can get in one Accord one mind and you can believe watch what God will do in our midst that's how simple it is but the problem is we got a flesh we got a devil a lot of times a preacher up here all these Ministers of God have to fight through you talk about the government fighting through red T tape or you have to fight through red tape to get anything done we have to fight through black tape after black tape and we got to take the red tape we got to take the blood and apply it and apply it so that you can leave here with something Hallelujah I don't need you to leave here and and think anything what brother Tim said was good no I need you to leave here that's what I'm fighting for up here that's why every Minister that fights up here wants you to leave here with a word of God Amen that God gave you something that God showed you that you can go forth now and visualize it amen pray over it speak over it and expect it to come in your life and expect the manifestation amen it doesn't matter how long it was for Abraham Abraham was expecting excited amen for his son to come oh my when 25 years later when that s that son came amen he was excited more than it was when when he when he when the promise was given to him oh that's what it does to a Believer that's what the word of God does to a Believer knowing that the word that's spoken is going to be made flesh in them and manifest in them oh my Hallelujah this thing is greater than 33 years ago when I was called I it was great back then man things were opening up and this and that man the supernatural was moving all the time amen God and set and free amen hallelujah cleaning me up cleaning me up cleaning me up it was glorious but it's even more glorious today because I see what he's done he's got me out of the way and now I can stand back and watch the glory of God the manifestation of the word in this hour to manifest through my life nothing greater to a Believer to step aside and watch him you talk about possession you talk about losing your your mind that's what it means lose your mind I lost my mind I'm losing my mind right now and I'm gaining the mind of Christ every me every moment of the day every minute of the day Hallelujah Paul says I Die daily daily minute by minute Hallelujah your desire in your heart I don't care if you're making mistake I don't care if you fall I don't care if you backslide Amen in your experience but that that seed inside of you amen is calling you pressing amen it doesn't stop it doesn't sleep it doesn't Slumber amen it's push it inside of you oh glory to God hallelujah amen Don't Be Afraid brother brothers and sisters sick the devil say Amen say glory to God hallelujah even if you don't feel like it you're tired I know I've been there I've been tired but I just say something ecy raises up amen glory to God I'm going to give God the glory amen the word is true the word is Right amen whether I don't feel it amen whether I don't see it in my life it's the truth hallelujah you start with that attitude you start with that way of thinking amen and watch God move on your scene you got to break through the unbelief you got to break through all that stuff amen you got to clear out those channels amen and come and believe the word of God that the word is true then you start seeing you start seeing word made flesh hallelujah amen justification Born Into The Kingdom John 1 this is Bible study too amen John 1 1213 John 318 1 Corinthians 123 Born Into The Kingdom the seed awak what a great manifestation that was that was a great manifestation sanctification 2 Corinthians 3:1 17:18 Galatians 52223 Romans 12 1-2 life sanctification a constant life process amen Sanctified right from beginning right to the End Amen this word inside of you as it grows is bringing this flesh under subjection to it hallelujah it's beating it down some things leave but some things got to be beaten down over and over God gives you faith and you realize that thing is not gone so God raises another standard of that faith it comes more under subjection it keeps getting weaker that fear in your life God keeps giving faith and he keeps giving faith and he keeps giving Faith amen and then that Fai that fear gets weaker and weaker amen then until you come to a place no matter what it is in your life you come to that place that you recognize amen that God is greater than it God has been bringing it under control and bringing it under subjection to his word God has been doing it by Faith by faith faith under Faith oh my that's when Faith becomes start become Perfect You're talk about Rapture is not going to be it's not going to be hard for God to uh Quicken our bodies and change our bodies when we come to that place Hallelujah empowerment hallelujah we're talking about the manifestations of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives empowerment acts 18 Luke 24:49 1 Corinthians 12 4 to 11 knowing who you are by Perfect faith knowing that God power is is inside of you you are joint HS remember go back to the scriptures joint HS with the father everything he is you look at his life you look at the prophet's life and how they overcome that's your life no different Hallelujah number four Holy Ghost Fellowship oh that's a nice one amen When the Saints get into Holy Ghost Fellowship Hallelujah but does the scripture say when we gather ourselves together and fellowship one with another confess one with another in the blood of Jesus Amen the Holy Ghost comes around and he starts manifesting himself in that Fellowship he starts doing signs wonders and miracles you talking about signs wonders and miracles amen stop looking at for healings and that those things will take place signs wonders and miracles your heart starts changing amen bondages start breaking off of you torments that were tormenting you starts leaving you when you get into Holy Ghost Fellowship listen Hey listen the Believers are not to get into this and stay into this carnal real and fellowship amen we can talk about cars we can talk about natural things but let me tell you if we leave without talking about the Holy Ghost and and break into that Supernatural where I want to see God speak into to me God manifest to me so the blood of Jesus Christ amen can come on the scene because I know when I get into Fellowship I always got a need and you might not know it but I always got a need you might not even speak it but when that blood when the Holy Ghost comes in that Fellowship amen hallelujah I start like Abraham when Abraham was walking he's changing changing this bride is moving up and stepping up amen when I just start moving out of that fellowship and I start walking in my daily life I realize oh I've been changed it's gone Hallelujah the answer is here it's revealed oh my you talk about manifestation you talk about the supernatural oh my brothers and sisters let's open our eyes and realize the Supernatural and what it really is and what it really does when it manifests in our lives hallelujah amen glory to God there is an authority and an ability in the seed of God that God commands it to manifest in its season Hallelujah when God speaks it's never you speaking never you speaking a lot of times we all we speak oh thus sayith the Lord this this that no when he speaks is all it's always different when he speaks Hallelujah and is believed in the heart it has to come to pass that's why my brother and sister when you grow and you mature amen you don't say nothing you got a situation you got a circumstance on your hand you don't say nothing you you just bring it to the father privately in prayer and you wait you wait for a word from God don't put your own interpretation on it don't put your own interpretation speaking it wait for a word God knows your situation God knows your heart just bring it before him in prayer amen and wait he'll give you a word in his time and in his season and when he do you know and then you go into prayer there's a power and an anointing on you you speak that word and you know something tells you it's going to happen it's going to happen that's perfect Faith it's going to happen oh glory to God hallelujah amen problem is we don't want to wait sometimes okay let's go the people say the universe manifests their desires and what they visualize what they don't understand is that God created the heavens and earth and the universe and in there he placed laws in there there's vibrations in there there's energy in there there's a law of sewing and reaping you talk about vibrations oh my you talk about energy you don't think that that's not you don't think you don't experience that you do experience that everything we're talking about here tonight when you break into faith and you start speaking the word and you start see the word manifest manifested you talk about vibration you know how much vibration it takes to bring something from the supernatural into the natural for you Amen to materialize what you've been what God has spoken to you what he's promised you amen you talk about a vibration a lot of vibration going on in Sarah's body Amen to receive a son after she was passed the age age of given naturally it was impossible but God's real of vibration and energy and spoken word hallelujah started coming and breaking down Hallelujah and that's what changed her body oh we break into vibration and energy all the time they don't understand what it is but God wants us to understand God wants us to take these law of sewing and reaping he wants us to understand the these things and apply it to our lives Satan always beating us down because he knows once you he doesn't care about them now listen to me he doesn't care about them you go on Tik Tok you go all that you see all kinds of people talking about manifestation the I spoke to the universe I visualized it I spoke it this that this came that came this came that came he's not going to touch them he's not going to bother them with those laws because they don't have the mind of Christ they don't got Christ's character and Christ's word because he knows if you catch that and you start moving and operating in that real you're going to be like Jesus Christ that walked on the earth and he knew he knew what it was like when Christ walked this Earth Hallelujah he knew what it was like oh my um you're talking about a million VTS going through the devil when he tried to touch Jesus amen hallelujah and then the apostles caught into it the apostles started moving into it amen and even their Shadow healed them even their Shadow delivered that's why he doesn't want you to know that's why he tells you and when you read all these things I was getting blessed reading all this stuff amen I'm sure brother Danny his background knowing all these stuff bringing it back to the word now oh my you see they don't have an adversary they don't have a devil fighting them fighting their flesh like we do cuz he doesn't want it to come to pass in our lives cuz he knows that we're not looking for our own wants but we're looking back to the word he knows that we are part of that word and he knows if if we're set free from that that word is going to come in flesh and it's going to manifest in our lives you need to understand that amen so you may understand the battle that you're going through hallelujah oh maybe God don't want that for you maybe as a Christian you shouldn't have that listen let me tell you if God spoke it to you you can see it identified there in the word of God it's yours God wants it for you and the quicker you can get rid of that liing devil the quicker you can start seeing it that's why he said my brother brothers and sisters he Brother Brad seen it so many times people had Faith he spoke you are healed you know that's no different tonight oh no no I know I know what you're thinking your only brother Tim your only brother Danny your only brother Simon you're not brother brandham so it can't happen but brother Bram says listen when he it wasn't brother brandom doing nothing anyways think about it when he when God showed him you are healed and then they started they started oh yeah yeah and then they started doubting he says don't doubt don't doubt you're going to take it away from you it's going to go away from you your faith brings it to you your doubt takes it away from you you know sometimes they manifest that I'm going back and forth here tonight sometimes they manifest that more than we that's why I said the scriptures they're wiser the children of this world but listen that's ain't going to stay that scripture ain't going to stay being fulfilled for much longer that scripture is going to come to pass and it's going to be for another day gone by very very soon because when this bride of Jesus Christ amen starts rising up and taking the things that God has given them this was created for you it was created for the Sons and Daughters of God it's for us to bring forth the word but they use it to bring forth their lust and their desires and their and their wealth and all these things but it's for us to bring forth the word and to manifest it in this hour Hallelujah the Bride of Jesus Christ has been predestinated to go right to the source himself and when she does she enters into his mind and his will she sees the perfect will of God and by faith it's revealed to her what God wants for her to manifest that is her part in the word and that's where she takes these laws of God and brings it forth in her life oh my glory to God I still got a few minutes here Saints amen thank you Lord skip over a couple things here so we can get down we therefore ought to be able to align the manifestations of God in our lives with the things that are necessary for developing and polishing our faith in him three things that are necessary for developing and polishing our faith number one the idea that God actually exists that means the word made flesh today oh yes I believe brother brother Tim God exists I believe there's a God ah they're saying that out there too that won't mean nothing that that's not what he's talking about here that God actually exists what are you talking about where is God today what's God's purpose today in me in you God exists oh yes God Is possessing his possession God Is possessing people in this hour oh yes God is walking God is living God is speaking God is thinking God is visualizing Hallelujah through people in this hour oh yes I believe that God exists in me hallelujah amen second a correct idea of his character Perfections and attributes oh yeah very important to know his character H Allelujah his heart his ways number three a knowledge of that life we are pursuing is in harmony with God's will we are a prisoner to the revealed word in our hearts we are in harmony with his perfect will you know Jesus in The Garden of Gethsemane he knew Calvary he knew the suffering and even for a slight moment there father if it be possible but it wasn't possible because he knew his will that's why he came back and said not my will but thy will be done and that was for us my brothers and sisters amen not our will but his will be done when we align with his will his heart for our lives oh you're going to see the supernal the manifestation of the word in your flesh experiencing it in in your flesh oh you can talk about the word made flesh the word made flesh but if the word is not experienced in your flesh you don't know what it is what it means the word made flesh applying the token and seeing it manifest in our lives Hallelujah glory to God now Faith is a substance going to start winding it down Hallelujah and by it we understand all those things are done it's not an imagination it's not it's a substance especially brother BR speaking here perfect Faith see if you had perfect faith you'll look straight to God and believe it and walk away we we read that so many times but listen put that in your experience say God if it's not in your experience say Lord help me to get to that place amen get to that place I I know I got no he doesn't want you to have faith my brothers and sisters he wants you to have perfect Faith Hallelujah perfect realization of who you are amen that you can look straight to what God is revealing to you and walk away and believe it other words it's done it's over it's finished it it can do nothing but manifest in my life whatever God promised you Hallelujah you don't need you don't have to no need to come into a prayer line that's still big in the message everybody needing to come into a prayer line you have no need of these things because your faith has done made it so already that's the problem prayer lines and all these things that happen happen is because people don't have the Faith said brother Tim that's that's pretty tough pretty hard statement Prophet said it if you had Faith go back in perfect Faith the message if you really got faith you won't need to come into the prayer line You'll stand right where you are and you receive whatever you have need of if you got perfect Faith tonight in your need you don't need brother Tim you don't need any of the other ministers to pray for you you can receive it tonight wherever you are you can receive whatever you have need of tonight that's why you said when the Holy Ghost is moving and the words coming forth and there's something on your heart claim it amen claim it in his presence you're in his presence tonight he is here whether you feel him or not he is here his mind is here his presence here his manifestation is here tonight come under the tent of the Holy Ghost the supernatural transformation power of God and leave out of these doors different tonight leave changed leave delivered leave set free let fear bondage everything break from you Hallelujah stop looking to man stop looking with your eyes look to the Unseen and for you to receive anything tonight you got to close your eyes and open your spiritual eyes hallelujah amen glory to God God created the universe through his word God was all alone not and not nothing exists but himself when he determined and created the world he thought it he willed it he spoke the word so he made it it came into instantly existence exactly the way he seen it he spoke it and he willed it it is enough then for us to be aware of a single fact nothing is equally existent without God apart from God there are simply nothing else yet through although he was alone he was he manifested because he lacked neither reason wisdom power nor counsel when he was alone all things were were in him and he himself was all at that moment of his own choosing and in the manner determined by himself God manifested his word and through him he made the whole world the whole universe Hallelujah acts 189 you talk about manifestation we shall receive power when the Holy Ghost comes upon us and in us and we will be Witnesses we will demonstrate we will manifest the power of God the people will witness the manifestation of God's power through the holy spirit in your life they will see the word be coming into a manifestation right before their very eyes all right my brothers and sisters listen it's coming fast because prophecy amen and the bride align themselves Israel and the bride aligns them himself Israel is taking land Hallelujah the bride is taking land now the bride is fighting now the bride is fully Awakening up now she's not sleeping anymore she's recognizing her land that she's got to take she's getting the squatters off of her land now amen she's speaking she wants the manifestation she doesn't want herself she don't care about gifts or nothing like that anymore she wants the word manifest in her life she wants Jesus Christ to come on the scene Hallelujah Oh Glory Glory you shall receive power Hallelujah brother Brandman speaking here in perfect Faith amen this is changing real quick he says now remember they had the power Jesus given them the power there's all kinds of Power hallelujah amen to heal the sick to raise the Dead cast out Devils amen just a few days before that he gave them the power but they didn't have the faith to use the power oh my that's a big statement my brothers and sisters that's a big statement that the bride I believe is starting to understand because I'm starting to understand it what he meant when he said that she had the power and sometimes we think and we get we get blindsided by the power manifesting amen and that's why spontaneous here there this that no Direction no purpose in it you see people going off here going off there going here going there leading astray to this leading astray to that because why no faith mixed with that power amen when faith comes to the individual amen faith is the one that governs controls and directs that power hallelujah amen he says that's the Tabernacle there's the church the bride today oh no no no no no no this is 1963 no no no this is changing real fast this this short quick work is happening real fast everything that God planted everything that he sown he knows when to bring it forth amen just like he spoke in the beginning Hallelujah he seen and spoke everything it could have been a billion years brother Bram says before it all came into existence God knew he knew exactly when Abraham you're going to have a child 25 years that came into existence this word of God this bride was spoken into existence amen hallelujah and God knows Hallelujah when it's going to manifest let me just wind it down now Hallelujah let me tell you something beautiful here my brothers and sisters when you start moving into this manifestation amen perfect Faith Masters all circumstances oh man I still Rejoice over that no matter what it is listen to to him no matter what it is it Masters it let me tell you don't you leave here I don't care what it is in your life don't you leave here defeated over that thing over that circumstance over that problem whatever it is because the faith that you got inside of you listen it's all in the seed that though that acorn tree is all in the acorn okay that perfect faith that we're talking about here was delivered by a prophet a spoken word seed Prophet speaking thus sayeth the Lord speaking the spoken word and that spoken word that was spoken is perfect Faith perfect Faith that's the seed that you have received that's the seed that woke you up inside of you that's the birth that you got it's there right now perfect faith is there now I don't care what you see what you fear I don't care how the enemy looks in your life right now trying to tell you you're defeated you can't move forward you can't change you got a perfect seed word of God perfect Faith inside of you that Masters all of it all your circumstances when you come in connection with that perfect Faith inside of you that realization and you look at that circumstance and says my faith my perfect faith Masters you what what am I saying it's so simple boo devil boo devil big big devil oh big boo going back he said boo devil got smaller boo devil so simple I love the Lord don't you when he just brings these simple thoughts you're preaching the word he just brings it so simple to us so we can understand understand little babes e now just watch when you believe anything do anything you got faith in what you are doing no matter what the circumstances around you that don't listen oh this is beautiful that don't have anything to do with it see it Masters that circumstance the Lord reveals that a certain thing is going to happen hello we're talk talking about that tonight is going to happen in your life you just speak it and go on don't speak it to anybody else okay God reveals something to you don't speak it to your brother or your sister or anybody else in Fellowship those are the things you don't speak in Fellowship because when you speak it and you just go on you know what your brother and sisters going to see when it's the time and season they're going to see the the manifestation of it and they're going to know you don't have to tell them let God show them let God manifest himself hallelujah oh my just don't ask any questions it's already over just keep going on you see it Masters all circumstances Faith believes that God will work it out and faith and love are relations because you can't have faith unless you got love because your faith is in a God Who is the very essence of love Faith and love works together Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah amen let me just let's musicians come up hallelujah amen thank you Lord you know the the Bible says that Jacob have I loved but Esau I have hated I heard brother coffee speaking that last week and I had these had this thought because I came across something that was very very nice we go like people just miss understand God how can God hate when he's the very essence of love we just spoken now how did God manifest his love towards Jacob and how did he manifest his hatred towards Esau this will help you understand how God is your father God blessed Esau with wealth with power he fulfilled all the promises towards Esau made him a great nation a great leader didn't he and that's what that's what what's happening out there hey they're taking all what we're saying here tonight and they're blessed there's Nations out there that are blessed and we we we try to look at that that's not for us to look at it's not for us at all to look at we got to put blinders on we got we got what we we there's nothing greater let me tell you there's nothing greater on this Earth that's going to take place but the manifestation of the word made flesh in The Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour that ain't even going to compare when the glory is revealed in her Hallelujah now listen the difference between Jacob and Esau God let Esau be Esau God let Esau live his own life he never disciplined him he never chastened him he never corrected him he let Esau be Esau he spoke Esau he blessed Esau and he let Esau be Esau but Jacob was disciplined trials Came Upon him God could not let him be that way a deceiver he changed his name Hallelujah that was God's love manifested to him to bring Jacob into the form and image of him God himself Christ that's how God manifests his love and his hatred those who I love the Book of Revelation says those who I love I rebuke I chasen I get after you my word get gets after you I encourage you I strengthen you I tell you you're more than a conqueror I tell you you got all the strength that you need I get after you you are my son you are my daughter you are to bring forth this word in this hour there's never been a love they don't know what love is my brother brothers and sisters if you find that love of God upon you tonight that you feel when the Holy Spirit is speaking to you the word is coming forth and it's it's challenging you it's pushing you through that pipe it's pulling on you pulling and pulling on you that's God's love and his grace hallelujah hallelujah amen when the written word starts revealing to you is a faith and you start applying it to your life and a manifestation starts taking place that written word starts becoming flesh applying the token is when perfect faith is manifested in you let us stand oh my brothers and sisters I pray that something the Holy Spirit spoke to you spoke to your faith spoke to your experience spoke to your condition and told you to keep pressing on we're not stopping my brothers and sisters there's no time to slow down there's no time to rest and take a break in this hour no it's time to keep pressing with this faith that has been given to us is there more oh God has great things we don't stand back and just say oh the rapture's coming look at Israel the rapture's coming rapture's coming when the there's something that stirs inside my heart because there's a place that I the faith inside of me I need to yield myself and that Faith needs to get to a place there needs to be a manifestation in my life because he said I have spoken my word and we believe that word that he has spoken is in US I've spoken my word and my word has gone forth and my word will not return to me void but it shall accomplish what I set forth to do it will manifest just like Sarah's baby came and manifested just like when Mary this Angel spoke to Mary and said you will have a son without bearing anything of this life Natural Life comprehension of how to bring forth a baby but the Holy Ghost will overshadow you amen Mary believed it be it unto me Hallelujah according to Thy word she heard the word by an Angel the word was revealed to her and she said be it unto me according to Thy word and she believed she went out and she believed that word there was nothing in Mary amen that can make her doubt or just believe that she was not going to bring forth a child without knowing a man because it was spoken and revealed to her oh what about us my brothers and sisters when this message and you Rec recognize that God sent a true prophet and you catch a revelation of that what are you catching to glorify a man or an office no you recognize the word that came through him is being unto me that's the spoken word The Living Word of God be it unto me according to the word that's been spoken in this hour and that's what our faith constantly says since the new birth always doesn't matter what comes in our lives what Satan throws be it unto me be it unto me father thank you for your word tonight thank you for your presence thank you for what you've done in the people's hearts you put a seed a portion of word here tonight Lord and I believe with all my heart not because of a man not because of a gift that's gone Lord because you are here
