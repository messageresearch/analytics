TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I guess I'm just gonna do check presentation because he's already given me the check and I've heard all Canada to check presentations and I said John 5:1 4:00 p.m. on Friday afternoon and so they gave us another big check here comes the victory stop here we go this is this because right up until right up until Friday I didn't know how I was getting there yet because the pressure and it was just so much going on all at the same time and it just everything was coming from every side and it was just unbelievable but then you know Friday after the dinner we do whatever we can do and make sure you're doing your best all thought wants is for you to just give your best even under the fears of pressure just still just keep your best you know you're gonna make the stage don't worry get up to eat your best God is going to do his part in darkness and so and then it just went from there you know it just kept and then it was just one blessing after the other blessing after blessing Holy Spirit just part of the state for people so I'm very grateful for that you're going to get a five-minute or maybe go ahead you want to explain what's happening all I see the elevator okay are well so at the beginning there you saw the sanctuary that's that's the sanctuary and everybody will be through services these are the areas right above the sanctuary and to the very back they have learned all the young people compete and serve downstairs outside the sanctuary they bring all the girls up this is where they were actually doing their their banners because we had it wasn't seven teams of eight teams that we had this year total of about 95 96 youth huge and so there was banners that were made they all had the paint your old banners you can see the creativity in these banners it all basically got to choose from certain themes based on the names [Music] [Music] [Music] actually some ministers in design 23 year old young man married designed for the purpose of ministering to the young people of this generation God prepared that vessel he gave his testimony he started preaching at the age of 14 and he grew up under the basically brought up by his grandmother this Angela's parents were golden family just a filmer appeal is the skits overdone which were really good [Music] [Music] [Music] songs for food song services and they were real [Music] I've never seen a creature that could preach without taking a breath I'm not you know this brother would go through 30 minutes tonight obviously breathe literally for like 20 to 30 minutes he could go without stopping with the thought process by which he was gifted to bring the word and never lost his train of thought stayed right in line with the thought that was coming and you would think that you know you would miss it but actually the wave was coming you know I asked some of the young people in this emoticon like because he would stay on it in such a way that would just keep moving and keep holding that thought and it would just get cooked right into their heart boom to second father back in the revelation that God was talking so it really is a remarkable gift [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] they said a song it was a song for us to sing and not ever say their song probably rates the sickness song this song goes like this [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] just got all caught up beginning and I'm going to you in that atmosphere that was there only just it was special it was just special and I'm just so glad to be a part of it and you should be very glad [Music] because our children they are the Lord tarries so what just continue to break them believe that God is going to continue the work that our lives because after the camp they still got to go back and they got a good deal of money and they got a deal with the peer pressure and they got to deal with you know the struggles one there was a word that was placed in them that can rise up it's the standard that's how God raises his standard in our lives he gives us his word and that is our staff praise God well this morning we're going to be ministering not very long we're going to be doing the Lord's Supper today but the Lord did give me a thought that we want to just bring and you know the title this morning is the invisible union now in community so there's there's something that's taking place in this pane in this hour that is drawing the people together under a revelation of what God is doing in this day at this hour it's very important for people to recognize that God is not a dead God he's not a dog he's a living God present present he's still moving along with the prophecy of his word but there were prophecies that were given for this baby for this hour that must come to pass and we can never disregard by getting caught up in traditions into you know organized religion they are not organized we are in the autumn of Jesus Christ we are living church body of Jesus Christ and it is the book of acts in continuation it's still doing everything that started back to the book of Acts when the first Christian Church went into that upper room and we see the Holy Ghost and came out speaking in different tongues and languages and get people to understand was because God was starting to move that was going to restore the church back to its original condition back to Eve again remember Jesus Christ Adam and Eve Jesus and the church Christ and his bride God the Father and his children it's all the same thing it's all just evicted in different forms and types everything that happened in the dark Medina was all a prophecy of things that were to come the book of Genesis is the book of beginnings is the seed book it's where everything had its beginning and there's a prophecy that's written into the book and it's all coming to pass everything that was going to take place from from the start to the beginning of God's plan of redemption that which God saw in his mind he placed it all into that one book of Genesis did you know that but yet if you played it out in all the 66 books of the Bible a just kind of showing himself Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Joe hold out of the Old Testament Jesus of the New Testament it's all God Jesus God Jesus is the Lord Jesus is Jehovah maybe Jesus needs so you've got all kinds of different teachings up there about religion about Christianity there is only one Christianity there is not 3500 different than ama national teachings of Christianity we need to get this straight if we need it we want to come to God that we're gonna need to come God's provided wait you're not saying oh you're a church that has the truth if you don't come to this church you're going into tribulation that's not what we're saying we're saying that there is only aren't true that that is the Word of God and that the Bible that God's Word be truth and that every man's word be alive but jesus said I said to the comforter which is the Holy Ghost and he will guide you into all now it's important to get the Holy Ghost that's why they live into the upper room he's still the same yesterday Reaper he does it the same way he has not changed everything remains the same because he is the same they saw with me this morning very well amen praise God because we want to just you know be like what we're going to communion today but yet there's an invisible union that has brought us into this very much and this invisible union is the Holy Ghost in you leading you and guide you into all truth you see there's certain things that you that if you are really born again and you are Christian that there's no way you cannot be buried into the water not this tank you people really contrary are baptized what they're about Kaiser who year hot tub and all the people it's irrelevant all right it's the symbolic outward expression of something that has taken place on the inside and that's why when he was being told about about Christ and about the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the moment he came across water he says look stop this now right now for the baptized me right now because he realized that something that taken place on the inside and I wanted to take you to be expressed somebody goes and gets baptized they are being buried baptism means to be buried into the water just like you were dying into a break and then being risen up into the mists of life and that all either stays buried and drowned in that water and that is the born-again experience that's written is it's not you brought up there honey that's not what this we are not religious people we don't drive Jesus down equal strokes we are sons and daughters of God that have recognized who we are and then it requires receiving the Holy Ghost in order for him to lead us and guide us into all truth sort of when you testify to somebody just like they did in the book of Acts listen everything you want a little out of the church operates just go back to the point about right even look at any cost acts 2:38 do they receive the Holy Ghost they came down and they were speaking to the people that were destined finder the people you need to receive all the ghosts this is what they were saying because look we ask in acts 2:38 what shall we do in order to receive this Holy Ghost you're talking about wait he said Peter Peter not never Peter who's with Jesus says we every one of you and be baptized Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and this promise is [Music] this is the way this year's the pork chop if you want that you if you've got an attribute of you that can respond to the Word of God in other words if your son or daughter of doctors never attack you we're not eternal means having to be giving in the land but what you did was you came to the spiritual I need you to come into this body and you come into this vessel that you're living in this earth and you're going to a baby's body and you know you've got to come through all these traditions and all these upgrades and all you know your generational teachings of your parents and all whatever it was but then the word comes to you and now if that if you were a son or daughter of God you always work then you hear this word you hear the truth is Jesus and the truth will set you free you hear this truth and all of a sudden your risible you know think understand i could have a thousand testimonies you know from all the people right here we might have a hundred testimonies of people that can tell when God revealed himself to them how they were enlightened by the Word of God to see truth and actually look into the word and see the baptism is clear as an awesome oh my god I got baptized as a baby I can't repent 25 years ago this one and I'm looking at I've seen I couldn't be kept as a baby and then when they baptized in the Catholic Church I see how they do it's in the name of the Father the Son the Holy Spirit and there's a Trinitarian teaching title and all of a sudden they just didn't make sense but this makes sense of working sense and when you will make a word their minds up to a revelation of God I was godly people would come to be say you need to go to church on Saturdays I said listen I said God wants me he can come talk to me itself just like that shut right down wasn't too long after that and now [Music] God comes you there's an invisible unit let's read the scripture it's from [Music] what was dr. 7 verse 4 says wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God just that scripture goal is everything I talked about everything I've talked about he says my brother ye also are become dead to the law by the body price in other words all that you're thinking all your traditions everything that you thought was was was true everything religions all these different interpretations are not once you haven't come into the body of Christ you are completely liberated and you receive truth that truly set you free we go down to verse 10 and it says that if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin in other words this isn't this isn't what God has redeemed God's not redeeming you as a human God is big Dini is all his attributes he's bringing back sons and daughters of God so sin now it's dead no longer has a control over your life anymore it's just remarkable but the Spirit is life the Spirit is life because of righteousness because of Christ because everything that God does is it's good but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead well you he that raised up Christ from the dentist of the Holy Spirit Christ himself his anointing his power lovely new even reason impressively dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in you so it's telling us that you're gonna be changed from this mortal body that's why he's not redeeming your or the lot therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh it's not good in other words we're not to be controlled by the flesh we're not to be under the bondage of the flesh we need to understand what this is what sickness is as we try to tell you you're not to be under the body sickness example flesh it attacks the flesh but we are not to become of a bondage of that right because of the spirit that dwells in us right and so therefore whether we're we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh if all you're looking at is my life but your revelation you should be that the Spirit that dwelleth in me shall overcome shall heal this father shall bring it under subjection to what the word says not what the world says I don't want the doctors before to tell me that I've got cancer the Word of God said I will work on all of this so I'm going to place that on and over the doctor's report right I'm not gonna redo the doctor he's doing his job he's doing what he has to do but the Word of God says different and if it's my time to go according to that way because in the peoples on here but through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body even in other words to allow the Spirit of God in you not your will God's Word to to prayer through dedication and through you know discipline by applying the Word of God Keeper you will bounce to take control amen for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God see everything we're just saying for him not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but he received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry adoption we've got a complete series on that about how God is placing you giving you a position in the body has given you a gift to operate in the body once you take that position once you allow a gift to operate through you and you do all that God has shown you according to the faith that God gives you you can actually be a powerhouse in the body of Christ you become nfie you become an encourage you become like you know something that nourishes the body of Christ all because you've come into your adoption the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children and if children then heirs heirs of God but these are powerful words there but let's let's let's populate what we're eating here heirs of God sons of God amen praise God and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ imagine so he's saved on put you right next to me not whatever you say if you say to this mountain if you say to this sickness if you say to this situation all of your work because you have a revelation of who you are as a son or a daughter of God simple look very powerful that we are the truth and Affairs two years of the Christ insult be that we suffer with him that we may also glorify them together be glorified together so what do you think it's going to be a bed of roses it's not you will suffer with him but better to suffer with him there's a lot of people suffering out there don't go to them and you try to you know you try to you try to help them you know keep you away get away too much more you can only introduce them to what God has done for you for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be even us so the creature was being subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who have subjected the same people because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious ability of children of God for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now near the final stages as bodies is travailing it's over covenants were in communion it's an invisible communion it's an invisible there's a there's a struggle within the body to come together and it's quoting if there's your situations and and you know about that and not only they but ourselves also you got to count ourselves into that we're growing we're all a part of that which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body let's pray father we thank you so much this morning Lord we've read from your word father we could just close it up right now and just be blessed father from what could have just revealed from the word appeared and minutes because you can your faith in your revelation to your people when you want to open the understanding you shall open and no man shutteth and we're so grateful for that work for this this Avenue by which we communicate by your spirit each individual person father we can be the praised the Lord as he's resting even now born after ministering the Word of property the word continue to stir on the Hudson may there be a crying out for the Spirit of God with your spirit neither we need more you remember all the young people that are received the word there last weekend boy we were in touch with him yesterday positive he's just he just relate how blessed he was how remarkable the cat was he was just grateful to be a part of it and Lord just remember him remember all those young people that were there Lord just continue like a hug their lives stir them and speak and Lord continue the work that you started in their threads and bless us now prosperous as we enter into your presence as we go to the [Music] well I had a chance right away this week to listen in on brother Andrews message for any girl that visited that you were here last Sunday when you are investing blessed been about hurteth must they've got a must must bless is truly a blessing it is the mind of God it's been it's like God's continuation if you go back it you just start the seeing to all the services that have been coming down right in front of you know right for the last couple months and the ministers that have come through and what it is that God is doing it's all right and even though the Holy Spirit gave me this title as I was in prayer is invisible and in that evening must be it must be a harmony there must be a people that come into fellowship and how the sons and daughters of God there's a strength in unity there's a strength in the body of the Christ that must be maintained in order for to have the power and in fact in order to fulfill the purpose of the plan of God right here right-handed bringing in Ontario right here at the good neighbor of mysteries and God would speak [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] why is God giving us such faith in Aries why is not testing us in these areas why because this is the final culmination remember that capsule we had a profit that came and told us clearly you will not get in there on their own you're not going to do it by your own works you have to do it in Harrogate buy buy buy buy my spirit it'll take my spirit in you it'll take grooming it'll take some suffering God does deal with our characters gotta move and shape us and break us if he has to break us in whatever way and then he'll know that sometimes it's painful it's painful we pass to deal and mold and shape us and doing us but but it's it's all for a purpose and God indicates that God comes in he'll send a minister through and the computer program he says I was going to treat something different I had a totally different message but the Lord and the precipice upon understanding of symbiotic relationships I'm just you know because I can see them that how the might of God is purity his children company is keeping us [Music] a separation every completed up blew up spirits that we try to bring wet just between you and your families your loved ones your brothers your sisters into whatever way we need to understand the power of God and how God can operate in such a way when you receive that word when you accept it you say be done to me according to thy word OPA and let that we have an effect on you don't worry that demon has to lead that power that control it cannot state must chickenshits word God's Word is truth [Music] absolutely he's done and you are liberated and you are free but some people will stay in that bondage and stay under that chain of circumstance will allow certain situations that people hold on their lives but no God says a relationship is a mutual relationship where both men and when you could look at the situation you can see on both betterment you're liberated he blessed you strengthened very much amen or it got the message on Wednesday that and I was bust on how the Holy Spirit is expedient that you understand and recognize that the Holy Spirit is in you that he's the one that is overcoming in you that you are an overcomer because of your recognizing who you are and it's all part of the by the duck bring us to a recognition of who we are so that we can stand in our post with authority we can stand around positions with authority without allowing any power or any influence wonderful blessed praise God brother Branham speaking here in the invisible union of the private price it is speaking about this age speaking about where we're at it will receive with it and he says here he says I am thankful to God to be living in this time of the closing scenes of this phone system now he was here in fact apparently this was back in 1965 and he was seeing how things were coming together in the world of prophecies word word will be fulfilled all around him and he goes on he says I'm so glad we seen this I don't know if I would have had a facial before the foundations of the world and God to me and said to me I want you to reach and now what age do you desire to go to the earth to preach for the bestest I would've chose this age for I think this is you know that age is now right here brother bad news got off the scene but the word that was dropped for the prophecy that he spoke the age that he was talking about remember he was seeing all these prophetic events how the church is gonna get you lined up how God had his advice on the scene of Israel's back into her homeland how it was things going on on the earth that were actually expressing the fulfillment of God's find the combination of calling a bride now the church the victory from the church with this day in this hour if we go back we look at certain victories and how God got you know started to bring the church into its fullness which is what were anything into now we can go back to the book of Acts like you said and the Holy Spirit came down on the day of Pentecost but that all continued it all went through the dark ages remember the enemy which is the devil has always been there trying to stop the plan enough he didn't in the garden he was a serpent in the garden is the surface channel that's been running all the way through there's always been an advocate there's always the enemy that's trying to stop God's plan God's purpose of God's program but he can't stop it and Saints been always trying to get to the church to disbelieve the work but yet here now become if we come hope we come through the Dark Ages and how the Christians they have the dot they had to give their lives I was all part of building up the body it's all part of milling about Luther you know he received a revelation from God he was a Catholic at the time in the Catholic Church at least and he was one of the sweetest word secret revelation from God that the just shall live by faith and that was the beginning of the Reformation that was when God was going to break the way down from from a man controlled because the Pope's they basically whatever the Pope said that was what the people wanted the Pope says you pay money people in the purgatory out he died that you get free to heaven the people said that how much because that's how they got to see but that's not what the word said he said I think you got a good old experience and relationship with me and so Luther broke away from the church because of that revelation and started that's why and from what he receives a revelation for the dog yeah if I think we also need to have a sanctified life you can't be living like that smoking drinking gene and lying and stealing everything else and say that you're a Christian and that you can just don't need to sanctify your life and Wesley that's why the Presbyterian Church was all about and they had Trinitarian teaching and you know that's what he did you and you trying to talk about Jesus Christ they say if you make him the Son of God God is perhaps not as we say that Jesus Christ is not he came down in a human vessel a manatee he'd come down the Word was made flesh and dwelt above the southeast Jesus Christ coming God coming down into a human body to express himself so he could go as a human to come to taking the place and so all of that was all in the program of God here in Luther grates away away all the servers would never be viable because without the spirit he got all truth and those spirit jesus said spirit and truth spirit and truth so you need the ball all of a sudden here comes the Holy Spirit at Pentecost 1906 and a constant movement Azusa Street and now he thought was called the Pentecostal movie because some things have gotten millions and millions of people that are Pentecostal and but the word didn't stop there in kept progressing and God house says a 20th century prophet people say go back to be no 66 books were adopted use a man filled with the spirit adopted the Word of God for that day God the sign of the scent of Gentile minister by the name of William Branham to bring the Word of God to this generation because it was going to show himself that there was going to be a church called out of all the churches and that there would be a revelation because
