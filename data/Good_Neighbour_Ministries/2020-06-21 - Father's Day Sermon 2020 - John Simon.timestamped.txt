[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] good morning friends let us come in to
[0:19] his house with Thanksgiving and enter
[0:25] his courts with praise may the Lord
[0:29] bless us all this wonderful Sunday
[0:34] morning today we come to speak about
[0:41] fathers may the Lord richly bless every
[0:48] father here today may we read our
[0:52] scripture out of Malachi chapter 4 verse
[0:57] 5 behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:06] Prophet before the coming of the Great
[1:11] and dreadful day of the Lord and he
[1:16] shall turn the heart of the father's to
[1:21] the children and their heart of the
[1:24] children to the father's to their
[1:28] fathers lest I come and smite the earth
[1:33] with a curse our gracious Heavenly
[1:40] Father we thank you for these wonderful
[1:42] words here today we ask your divine
[1:46] blessing may your great Holy Spirit
[1:50] anoint the written word to our hearts
[1:53] and knowing those who are in their homes
[1:56] or places watching or listening to
[1:59] receive the word Lord may the great Holy
[2:03] Spirit now spread out his great shining
[2:08] wings everywhere father to overshadow
[2:12] the elected seed and people everywhere
[2:16] that they may hear your voice hear your
[2:20] word and they attend
[2:22] Shannon take you take the glory father
[2:25] and all the praise father Amen god bless
[2:30] you this morning of course today we are
[2:36] not here to do an exposition of Malachi
[2:42] 4:5 6 we will not do any explaining
[2:50] about the coming of Elijah instead we
[2:56] are here to have a topical approach to
[3:00] this text today we are here to
[3:05] commemorate and to celebrate father's on
[3:11] this Father's Day 2020 I want to say to
[3:19] all fathers everywhere happy Father's
[3:23] Day but in saying happy Father's Day
[3:28] what does it mean to be a father
[3:31] of course it doesn't just mean being
[3:36] male because that only means that one
[3:43] has the capacity or the physical ability
[3:47] to produce a child but I do believe that
[3:52] a real responsible father believes God
[3:59] with all his heart and serves God a real
[4:05] father is one who is a man of faith and
[4:13] also recognizes he is the pastor priest
[4:19] or Shepherd of his own little home I
[4:26] also believe and the Bible teaches that
[4:31] a real father loves
[4:35] wife and love his children's mother with
[4:41] all his heart
[4:42] a real father also loves his children a
[4:51] real father is an example to his
[4:58] children and he's an example by modeling
[5:04] behavior positive behaviors in their
[5:10] presence around them and with them
[5:13] something that they can that can provide
[5:17] them an image that they can draw from a
[5:23] frame of reference that they may be able
[5:27] to live by of course I believe that a
[5:32] real father provides for his family I
[5:36] also believe that a real father protects
[5:42] his family he does everything in his
[5:45] power to protect his family and watch
[5:50] over them in love like a lion like an
[5:56] eagle or a beer watching over his phone
[6:01] I also believe that a real father will
[6:08] discipline his family he will restrain
[6:12] his family from certain things that are
[6:17] not good not proper he will restrain
[6:24] them he will speak act and do in ways
[6:29] that will place limits standards
[6:32] guidelines upon them now I'm here to
[6:38] apply this text to these perilous times
[6:43] in which we live for we are now live
[6:48] in as I've said the pre-tribulation
[6:51] period of the seventh church age the
[6:56] little dision church age which is loose
[7:02] lacks lazy and lukewarm in its ways my
[7:11] friends this is the age this is the end
[7:17] of the Gentiles age and this is the time
[7:22] when all the great wonderful standards
[7:28] that have been set of being swept aside
[7:33] by the rising tide of sin it seems as if
[7:38] we have a right to the time when nothing
[7:42] is sacred in the eyes of men and women
[7:47] everywhere the modern church finds
[7:51] itself in a time of modern spiritual
[7:57] blackout finds herself blindfolded or in
[8:04] blindness many unsaved backslidden
[8:11] preachers now lead God's people and they
[8:19] may be insincere sincere as they are and
[8:24] some are filled with anointing and fire
[8:28] upon them my friends but as the
[8:31] Scriptures have said they come into the
[8:34] presence of God with a strange fire taik
[8:38] about it
[8:39] they have Lord God standards of God's
[8:43] Word they have Lord God standards for
[8:49] holiness in the churches in the houses
[8:54] of worship places considered sacred
[9:01] it's no more the way it was in from
[9:05] Bible days or even in the days of our
[9:09] forefathers they have let down the bars
[9:13] and the goats have come in the standards
[9:17] for holiness have gone down and in some
[9:21] places outside of the door while it was
[9:26] in Israel some time ago point of view
[9:30] the inside of one of those beautiful
[9:32] ancient churches on the gates and on the
[9:38] wall outside was a same thing let not
[9:42] enter here with sharts let not enter
[9:48] here with just bikinis or half-dressed
[9:55] for we have provided here gowns that you
[10:00] must put on or you are not allowed in to
[10:05] the house of God
[10:07] my friends the standards have been let
[10:12] down but there are a few churches few
[10:16] preachers and men of God who will not
[10:20] compromise and will stand by the Word of
[10:24] God and by the truth of God's Word until
[10:28] the crowning Cain may God bless them
[10:32] whoever they are wherever they are
[10:34] everywhere in the Spirit of God continue
[10:38] to open their wisdom their understanding
[10:41] their anoint their utterance and give
[10:44] them all that they need to perform the
[10:48] purpose and the will of God for
[10:52] everywhere else the the standards of
[10:54] God's holiness has been lowered
[10:59] Christian conduct has been diluted it's
[11:05] just brushed aside lowering the bars as
[11:10] I've said
[11:12] you've diluted the doctrines the
[11:15] teachings of the Bible to make it
[11:18] acceptable the certain money class of
[11:22] people or kinds of people or cultured
[11:26] people are educated people oh whatever
[11:30] they have just left down the bars and
[11:33] let all kinds of spiders and frogs and
[11:38] snakes and and goats and wolves ravening
[11:44] wolves and everything else has entered
[11:46] the house of the Living God hucksters
[11:49] and everything else in the presence of
[11:52] Almighty God and let down the the bars
[11:56] of the standards of the doctrines and
[12:00] teachings of the Bible their perverted
[12:04] apostolic order of how the God's church
[12:09] should behave and be ordered and
[12:13] performed and have replaced them with
[12:18] what man-made denominational systems of
[12:23] church governments and administrations
[12:27] writing up their own books and
[12:29] fundamentals and and order and
[12:33] everything else quite dreary to the Word
[12:37] of the Living God and as a result our
[12:41] Lord Jesus himself has said if the blind
[12:45] lead the blind
[12:47] Zenda they were both fall into the ditch
[12:51] I believe as a result of this as a
[12:58] result of the misdirection of the Church
[13:03] of the Living God many families many
[13:09] fathers are fallen into that niche
[13:18] at the present time in which we live
[13:22] statistically many fathers have turned
[13:28] away from their children literally
[13:33] forsaken them abuse them and left them
[13:40] behind lift them to grow up by
[13:47] themselves fathers leaving their
[13:52] children just having children and
[13:55] leaving them oh my friends this has
[13:59] nothing to do with class color wealth or
[14:03] anything else it's just the spirit of
[14:06] the age that made the god of this evil
[14:10] age has blinded the minds and the hearts
[14:13] of men and women and caused them to act
[14:17] in such ways that they reflect the
[14:20] beastly nature of the serpent that was
[14:24] in the garden here my friends these many
[14:28] fathers leaving their children to group
[14:33] by themselves with no guidance with no
[14:39] leadership in their lives leave them
[14:45] with no proper example yes I know many
[14:52] women and God bless them have raised and
[14:56] are raising their children fight
[14:59] themselves and many are doing a great
[15:02] and marvelous wonderful job but the role
[15:06] of male and female are totally different
[15:10] and each one has its place and one
[15:15] cannot really take the place of the
[15:19] other and so that is why the male
[15:23] presence in the home in a family unit is
[15:28] so important as
[15:31] as a male without the wife's presence
[15:35] leaves him disarmed and when the male is
[15:40] not in the home that woman is left
[15:43] disarmed those children are left
[15:47] unprotected
[15:49] they left forsaken and forlorn all my
[15:54] friends left with no discipline to
[15:59] become rebellious in the home in the
[16:03] schools in the streets everywhere but
[16:09] really it's a cry for help
[16:12] within the coverings of their soul you
[16:16] can hear the echoes of their crying
[16:18] crying out somebody help me please
[16:22] somebody help me Oh somebody love me
[16:26] somebody talk to me somebody advise me
[16:30] it's just that these young people and
[16:34] children are crying up for help and as
[16:38] it's written in the scriptures these
[16:41] fathers have turned away from the
[16:47] children the hearts of the fathers have
[16:51] turned away from their own children
[16:54] walked away from them lift them to fend
[17:00] for themselves and when they do that
[17:03] along comes a gang leader along comes
[17:09] some kind of a pimp or trafficker or and
[17:17] the damn my friends what's at times we
[17:23] live in when these young people these
[17:27] kids are never straight brought into
[17:32] some kind of an escort service or told
[17:36] they will be come a model and then
[17:39] they're defrauded oh and they are just
[17:44] debauched god help us in the age in
[17:48] which we live left with no guidance no
[17:52] leadership homeless helpless aimless
[18:00] unloved confused but longing for love
[18:06] left with no no parameters no guidelines
[18:12] more restraint within their lives no one
[18:16] to set something some system or some way
[18:20] by which they should live and so they
[18:24] live the way they would to live and so
[18:29] there is no enforcement of discipline no
[18:38] authority figures in their lives and so
[18:43] when they are left like that they name
[18:46] their searching for some authority
[18:50] figure in their life it may be that a
[18:54] school principal their teacher their
[18:58] pastor a priest some leader will fill
[19:05] that void may God help us it was the
[19:10] wrong kind of leadership that will
[19:13] distort and convert that pliable image
[19:18] in the heart of a child or in the heart
[19:24] of a young people person left your
[19:29] children the heart of the father's turn
[19:34] away from his own children that he
[19:38] brought into this world and left them
[19:41] and walked away from them no support no
[19:47] provision no protection no example no
[19:52] idea what
[19:54] laughs to go into the home or in the
[19:58] street to become long as rebels and
[20:02] juvenile delinquents as it's been said
[20:07] the juvenile delinquency mainly did not
[20:12] start with the pig but the children most
[20:15] of the times if you were to trace it
[20:18] back the juvenile delinquency started
[20:21] with the parent the heart of the
[20:24] father's turned away from their old
[20:27] children and lift them in the state and
[20:31] which they're in all my friends if we as
[20:37] father's parents do not provide them the
[20:41] modeled example the advice they the
[20:45] nurture the care the love that they need
[20:49] the testing for it they are going to
[20:53] seek it out somewhere else and they'll
[20:56] find it in the arms of illicit love
[21:00] affair they'll find them in the in the
[21:04] model of a a movie star the image of a
[21:09] movie star they'll dress like are
[21:11] they're like him they'll walk like her
[21:14] or walk like him they'll talk like that
[21:16] person because in the depths and core of
[21:20] their being they are searching and
[21:23] seeking to find an example a model a
[21:28] great line something by which they can
[21:32] set their life trajectory upward or
[21:37] downwards friends children do not know
[21:42] what real love is and when they're left
[21:48] by themselves and do not know what real
[21:51] love is
[21:52] then they end up being targets for
[21:56] perverted forms of love and then comes
[22:03] along a slick good-looking
[22:08] men are a smooth-talking
[22:11] woman and tell them that they love them
[22:17] that they care about them that they'll
[22:22] provide their needs they can give them
[22:25] whatever they want and so they go with
[22:29] them and they become entangled and
[22:34] fornication in adultery and various
[22:40] forms of alternative lifestyles caught
[22:46] up in the sea of sexual promiscuity all
[22:53] friends what a sad iron a sad day in
[22:56] which we live
[22:58] first of all the social and spiritual
[23:02] acclaim in society is one of the main
[23:06] thoughts for this the spiritual decline
[23:13] within the church is a great fault for
[23:19] this for the church itself was lost her
[23:24] first love I believe it's time for the
[23:28] church to repent and remember from when
[23:31] she has fallen and go back to where she
[23:34] started in the presence of Almighty God
[23:38] with the power of the Holy Spirit and
[23:40] the leadership of the teaching of the
[23:43] holy smokes and the comforter to come
[23:47] and comfort and guidance with Ness warn
[23:51] exhort and lead by His divine presence
[23:54] in the house of the Living God secondly
[23:58] I believe it's also it's the fault of
[24:02] the modern-day farmers who have turned
[24:06] their hearts away from their own
[24:09] children that they brought into this
[24:13] world and have this
[24:16] certain them brought them into the world
[24:19] but we'll take no responsibility for
[24:23] them
[24:24] there are also fathers but many of them
[24:28] are right in the home but they might as
[24:32] well not even be in the house or in that
[24:34] home because they're in the home bodily
[24:38] but their hearts are turned away from
[24:42] their own children from their own young
[24:46] ones they're teenagers
[24:48] their hearts are turned away from them
[24:50] they look upon them as burdens they look
[24:57] upon them as hindrances many of them
[25:00] look upon them as like mill stones
[25:03] around their necks they themselves of
[25:08] that come to estate to realize the
[25:12] treasures that they have in those
[25:14] children those young people the
[25:16] potential the greatness the legacy that
[25:20] they have the ability to live for them
[25:23] they are not aware of it and as a result
[25:26] of that their hearts are turned away
[25:30] from their own children in spirit my
[25:36] friends I tell you many times they
[25:41] themselves have no real love so they
[25:44] don't know how to love they had no real
[25:49] empathetic relationship with their
[25:54] parents and so they come up
[25:59] consciousness with no conscience they
[26:04] come up with a conscience ear as a hot
[26:09] iron no feeling you know they just have
[26:14] no idea what real love is
[26:17] it's just like an animal and even the
[26:20] animals love and will protect their own
[26:24] and reach out further Oh
[26:28] they have no example no proper example
[26:31] of it in their lives maybe a brought up
[26:35] in an environment of cloying fussing
[26:38] fightin fretting like that brought up in
[26:42] with a behavior pattern that was
[26:46] negative
[26:47] cursing swearing lying smoking drinking
[26:51] every example of alcoholic environment
[26:56] that turned them away from God and God's
[27:01] Word and presence for they had no other
[27:04] example and that's what they saw an
[27:07] experience and drop with that pattern
[27:10] and that pattern in which they grew up
[27:13] they are now passing that on down to
[27:18] their children because they have no
[27:21] proper bility or capacity to be able to
[27:25] do that however thank God their
[27:29] repentance turn into God giving your
[27:33] life to Jesus Christ committing your
[27:36] life to the leadership of a proper
[27:40] ministry or men of God that God will use
[27:44] to shape you form you and guide you in
[27:48] your living for him it will change your
[27:51] life completely and put you on another
[27:54] level my friend even if you do not
[27:58] become huh let's say a dyed-in-the-wool
[28:02] Christian you kill it will at least make
[28:06] you a better person a better citizen it
[28:11] will bring you a a better state and
[28:15] status walk in society just commit your
[28:20] life to Christ just commit your heart to
[28:24] him ask him to come into your life ask
[28:27] him to open up his word to you ask him
[28:31] to give you a taste of this Word of God
[28:35] that will excite you and show you better
[28:41] how to live how to walk and how to treat
[28:44] those around you it's not a Bible in
[28:47] your hand that's when the Bible gets
[28:49] into your heart that is what changes you
[28:53] completely but the power and presence of
[28:56] the Living God we can spot we can talk
[28:59] the Bible we can even Colton doesn't
[29:02] make you a Christian we can take the
[29:05] sheep's wool and cover ourselves and
[29:07] that will still you'll still have the
[29:10] nature of a wolf but may the great Holy
[29:13] Spirit bring about a genuine
[29:16] transformation they're genuine change
[29:19] hallelujah no one is beyond the grass
[29:23] for the hand of Almighty God I pray God
[29:26] that God laid his hand upon you this
[29:29] hand upon father's everywhere save them
[29:33] Lord in the name of Jesus Christ open
[29:35] their eyes of their understanding father
[29:38] may the skins fall off and may they come
[29:41] to a genuine relationship with you Lord
[29:45] which will affect their entire life and
[29:48] family and blessed be a blessing to
[29:52] their children I want to say thanks me
[29:57] to God as it is written in our
[30:01] scriptures but I will turn the hearts of
[30:05] the children the fathers to their
[30:08] children oh praise God God promised it
[30:13] that though the fathers have turned away
[30:16] their hearts from their children he will
[30:20] by His Holy Spirit turn their hearts
[30:24] back to their children again I believe
[30:27] there's hope for you sir I believe
[30:30] there's hope for us all that he will
[30:34] turn our hearts back to our children

[31:10] encourage you today to provide a
[31:13] positive image for your children the
[31:19] best and the greatest way for you to do
[31:22] that is to come become a real Christian

[31:34] I'm free at last I'm free from my habits
[31:38] I'm free from my old ways and free from
[31:41] my old life and now I walk into the
[31:44] glorious liberty of a son and a child of
[31:48] God hallelujah tell your friends I say
[31:52] I've become a real Christian because
[31:57] many cloak themselves with the trappings
[32:03] of real Christianity but they're worse
[32:08] sometimes than the sinners unbelievers
[32:14] ungodly that are outside God's wonderful
[32:21] church you see men that claim to be
[32:27] Christians and are in the church yes
[32:30] abusing their wives abusing their
[32:33] children dominating domineering all my
[32:39] friends their own flesh and blood
[32:42] the God gave them and witness shower
[32:48] upon them they love God that he has shed
[32:52] abroad in their hearts may God help us
[32:55] all that we may be genuine true
[32:58] Christians and let the love of God flow
[33:01] out of our lives and be a blessing up

[33:10] physically by hitting them brutalizing
[33:15] them depriving them of nurture of care

[33:26] here you see brother Simon why don't you
[33:29] use better words why don't you make it a
[33:35] little smoother and easier to take then
[33:40] this is another time for us to be
[33:43] playing games from the pulpit my friends
[33:47] you've got to be like a tiger with the
[33:50] Word of God and let the world know that
[33:54] Jesus Christ lives and saves and he
[33:59] delivers and he can become the pilot of
[34:02] their lives by surrendering their hearts
[34:06] and the lives to him amen friends men
[34:11] claiming to be Christians and under the
[34:14] cover and cloak of their Christianity at
[34:17] many times mentally harassing their own
[34:23] children ways young people calling them
[34:28] all kinds of names
[34:30] cursing in the home swearing in the home

[34:41] walls of the home all of the old
[34:43] preachers at all if walls could talk my
[34:46] friends I tell you our Italy something
[34:50] else if the walls could talk but

[35:03] provocation as the Bible's
[35:07] that father's provoke not your children
[35:11] - and are unto wrath it's something that
[35:15] God Himself is against God does not want
[35:20] you to push your child or your children
[35:23] into a corner and provoke them to anger
[35:26] in any way many fathers also spiritually
[35:33] by their actions and by their ungodly
[35:38] example effect the future the life the
[35:43] personality of their children cause it
[35:47] cause their children's personality
[35:50] instead of blooming and blossoming and
[35:52] going to their highest potential and
[35:56] abilities they have perverted and
[36:00] stunted their spiritual growth and even
[36:04] sometimes their natural and mental
[36:07] growth in every way and suppress them
[36:10] and turn away their children from God
[36:17] from God's church keep them away from
[36:22] God's people keep them away from me they
[36:26] this book my friends sin will keep you
[36:33] away from this book or this book will
[36:37] keep you away from sin back to the Bible
[36:41] back took a Word of God
[36:42] back to church back in the house of the
[36:46] Lord
[36:46] back to the way maybe your mother
[36:49] brought you up and your wonderful way
[36:52] far in the sin come back to God come
[36:55] back to the Bible back to the word have
[36:58] a whole healthy happy family by God's
[37:02] grace today may the Holy Spirit speak to
[37:05] you out of this simple pamba rough maybe
[37:09] crude words but if the truth
[37:12] nevertheless my friends I tell you so
[37:15] many do what I'm speaking about my
[37:18] prayer today
[37:21] is that farmers everywhere we repent for
[37:25] sins committed against their children
[37:29] may God today turn the hearts of fathers
[37:35] back to words their children think about
[37:39] them wherever you are go look for them
[37:42] find them love them right where they are
[37:46] oh praise God attend new friends fathers
[37:50] brothers wherever you are God is a just
[37:52] God and when you love you will be loved
[37:57] when you are friendly you will have
[38:01] friends when you reach out to your young
[38:05] ones your teenagers your young people
[38:08] your children with friendliness with
[38:11] family nest with love and kindness you
[38:14] will receive it back you will receive it
[38:18] back gardening that only say anyway that
[38:21] he will turn the hearts of the fathers
[38:24] to the children but in this scripture it
[38:28] says at the same time that he will turn
[38:31] the hearts of the children back towards
[38:35] their fathers so that if their fathers
[38:38] in the past and abuse has misuse as has
[38:42] suppressed oppressed them in any way God
[38:49] said he can turn the hearts of those
[38:54] children back to their fathers if those
[38:57] fathers will only say I am sorry at the
[39:02] time I had not grown or mature the way I
[39:05] should have I was confused or I was in a
[39:10] terrible state I was in a mess I needed
[39:15] help
[39:15] oh my friend come let these children I'm
[39:20] speaking now to the children whose
[39:23] hearts God said and I will turn the
[39:27] hearts of the children back to the
[39:29] father's so the hearts of the fathers
[39:32] a turn back to the children and a loving
[39:36] God turns the hearts of the children
[39:39] back to the father's so that there could
[39:43] be a uniting time there could be a
[39:46] oneness of this family there could be
[39:49] love and peace fit in the home God can
[39:53] have them in such a blissful state again
[39:57] my friends but when the father loves
[40:02] cares and carries out his rose his
[40:07] rightful rose and takes up again his
[40:11] responsibilities of a real father when
[40:15] he does that then God said I will turn
[40:21] the heart of the children back to their
[40:25] fathers God is saying by that scripture
[40:33] and phraseology I will repair the breach
[40:38] I will repair broken relationship I will
[40:46] knit again strained relationships he
[40:56] promised to turn the hearts of these
[40:59] estranged lonely unloved rebellious and
[41:08] confused children back to their fathers
[41:12] oh god help us as God turned the heart
[41:17] of that prodigal son back to his daddy
[41:21] again and said I don't care what state
[41:24] I'm in I know I can have a better life
[41:29] and a better relationship if I turn my
[41:32] heart my life back over into my father's
[41:37] care
[41:38] may God help you to be worthy of that
[41:41] and to live that kind of a life where
[41:44] the
[41:45] parts of your children maybe turn right
[41:48] back to you as a father and I believe
[41:52] that if a father will sincerely repent
[41:56] and us begin to pray oh god I've been
[42:02] separated strained for my children
[42:05] regardless of what caused that
[42:07] estrangement Oh God
[42:10] turn the hearts of my children back to
[42:13] me back to me as a father Lord that I
[42:16] might be able to perform my role by
[42:20] Myron and take up my responsibilities
[42:23] within their lines old friend Oh
[42:26] may you ask God Lord I will provide for
[42:31] them I will provide the clothing the
[42:36] food the succored and nurture place for

[42:49] are robbing your children of your time
