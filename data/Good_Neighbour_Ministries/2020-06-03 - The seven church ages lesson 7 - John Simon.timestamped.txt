[0:05] [Music]
[0:18] good evening my dear friends how
[0:22] wonderful it is to gather with you
[0:25] together in the house of God on this
[0:30] marvelous Wednesday evening may the Lord
[0:34] bless you real good we will now read our
[0:38] scripture and do our short brief study
[0:44] reading from Revelation chapter 1 from
[0:49] verse 5 unto him that loved us and
[0:56] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[1:01] and had made us kings and priests unto
[1:05] God and his father to him be glory and
[1:10] Dominion for ever and ever amen
[1:16] god bless you tonight praise God I'm so
[1:22] happy to be in the house of the Lord
[1:25] realizing that as our scripture has says
[1:29] that he has loosed us from our sins the
[1:34] word moost or washed us from our sins
[1:39] really means he's looseness or freed us
[1:43] from our sins there there we are
[1:46] brothers and sisters
[1:48] reduced loose from those sins which
[1:53] means that we were once tied up
[1:57] we were once shackled we we were
[2:02] shackled and we were chained but now we
[2:08] are loosed this also gives us the
[2:11] picture that we were
[2:13] imprisoned but now by the power of the
[2:19] blood of the Lord Jesus Christ your most
[2:23] I'm most from my sins loose from the
[2:28] past loose from everything else this
[2:32] also gives us the the thought of let's
[2:39] say you have a garment and that you love
[2:44] that garment you love to wear it as we
[2:48] are told to put on Christ but we you
[2:51] know we love to wear a certain garment
[2:54] and you may be at a wonderful dinner and
[3:00] something stains your garment that you
[3:03] are wearing and but everything you have
[3:07] trade you could not get out the stand
[3:11] you've tried every chemical every
[3:14] man-made chemical every thing that was
[3:17] in the store and you could not get the
[3:20] stain out until one day you thought
[3:27] about it
[3:28] let me not just use the regular
[3:31] detergent I need to get some bleach to
[3:36] deal with this stubborn stain and there
[3:42] you place that piece of clothing into
[3:46] the water and they required amount of
[3:49] bleach and after a time you'll notice
[3:53] that the bleach seems to break up all
[3:59] the chemicals of that stain and until
[4:05] the stain begins to vanish away from
[4:08] your piece of clothing in actual fact
[4:12] the bleach moost the dirt or the stain
[4:17] from the fabric of the clothing and that
[4:22] is the sense that we have here today
[4:24] that he
[4:26] had mousse or washed us in his own blood
[4:31] may I say watch this in his own bleached
[4:35] blood the bleached blood of Christ has
[4:38] washed us and cleansed us completely
[4:42] perfectly and and set us free to worship
[4:48] Him and to praise his holy and precious
[4:52] name Lord a god did you really catch
[4:56] that he has washed us the book of
[4:58] Revelation chapter 1 verse 5 says in his
[5:02] old blood in his own blood he has washed
[5:07] us oh praise be to God
[5:10] I thank God for that now we understand
[5:13] that he did not wash this with human
[5:17] blood no human sacrifice or blood could
[5:23] wash away our sins but it took the blood
[5:26] of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself to wash
[5:29] our sins away thanks be to God it would
[5:33] have said we were not saved by the will
[5:36] of man or the blood of man oh praise God
[5:40] but here we see we are saved by the
[5:42] blood of God God's own blood which kid
[5:46] has the power and the ability to bleach
[5:50] us from every sin stain upon our hearts
[5:54] upon our lives we were not my friends
[5:58] saved by any other blood but the blood
[6:02] of God Peter calls that blood of God the
[6:05] blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah Paul
[6:08] called it the blood of the Lord Lauren a
[6:12] god and he also called it the blood of
[6:15] Jesus oh the blood of Jesus washes white
[6:19] as snow now see clearly not three
[6:23] persons one persons what God the blood
[6:26] of God the blood of Jesus hallelujah the
[6:30] blood of our Lord one God not three but
[6:33] one God that died on the cross and bled
[6:37] there for
[6:38] our sins one person there is the great
[6:42] revelation that Jehovah God came down
[6:46] and done from his glory everliving story
[6:52] my God and Savior came and Jesus was his
[6:56] name and this great Jehovah came down
[7:00] and by the means of the virgin birth was
[7:05] able to make himself a body thanks be to
[7:11] God yes sir and God made that body or as
[7:16] he would have said to Solomon he built
[7:19] his own house and God came down and
[7:24] lived in his own house or Tabernacle
[7:28] written with God's house
[7:31] God's tabernacle is Jesus Christ God was
[7:36] in Christ reconciling the world not to
[7:40] express the second person or a third
[7:42] person but unto himself that he was
[7:46] reconciling the world yes sir and that
[7:50] blood that marvelous wonderful blood
[7:53] that flowed of Calvary was the blood of
[7:57] God Himself that came to redeem us amen
[8:03] for God had to be in that body that he
[8:07] himself made he being a spirit could not
[8:11] bleed of his spirit but through the
[8:17] instrumentality of the body that he made
[8:21] for himself that body could bleed
[8:24] chemical blood that we human beings can
[8:27] see and identify but something visible
[8:31] that God himself had bled for our sins
[8:36] thanks be to God
[8:38] hallelujah now if we're to go to the Old
[8:41] Testament we may see this truth
[8:43] amplified through tapes through the type
[8:46] and a shadow of Adam and Eve being in
[8:50] the garden
[8:52] when Adam and Eve first sin of course
[8:56] that news went straight to heaven let us
[8:59] see it as an angel going into the
[9:03] presence of God to announce that his
[9:05] children on earth had sinned against him
[9:10] no what was your reaction the reaction
[9:15] was that God send another create another
[9:20] human being and send him or her down to
[9:24] do the redemption that God called out to
[9:27] Michael or some other great angel and
[9:32] send them down to do that great
[9:36] redemption oh my did God send his son if
[9:41] he had a second person to accept that he
[9:45] send the son but no God came himself
[9:49] into the garden to redeem his lost son
[9:54] for Adam said he heard the voice of God
[9:57] walking in the garden and the voice
[10:01] crying with a brokenness Adam Adam where
[10:05] are you where are you
[10:08] that's their fellowship meeting that
[10:10] they would have every evening when God
[10:13] and Adam and Eve would have their time
[10:18] of fellowship with the cathedral of the
[10:21] under the cathedral of the sky and so
[10:24] there they were God having such great
[10:28] love within his heart would not entrust
[10:32] the redemption of his creation there's
[10:36] redemption of his son if his daughter
[10:39] under any other but he entrusted it to
[10:44] himself as much as he said to Abraham I
[10:48] swore by myself
[10:51] God swore by himself God came down
[10:55] himself
[10:56] to go the redemption praise being a God
[10:59] that we have his personal attention
[11:03] his personal action within this great
[11:08] process of redemption so we are redeemed
[11:13] unto himself and we are redeemed by the
[11:16] blood of God his self thank God
[11:20] so this eternal God came down and dwelt
[11:25] in a mortal body in order to take away
[11:30] our sin he became the Lamb of God he
[11:36] became the Lamb of God to be able to
[11:41] shed his blood and enter beyond the veil
[11:46] to make sacrifice for our sins
[11:51] consider this my friends then if we are
[11:55] saved by the blood of God if we have
[11:58] been washed and loosed freed set free
[12:03] from the shackles of sin the habits of
[12:06] sin all the desires of sin free set free
[12:12] by the grace of God then it was the
[12:15] blood of God then it had to be perfect
[12:18] blood perfect blood and if the blood
[12:23] that perfect blood is losing us from our
[12:29] sins then my friends we are loosed by
[12:33] the power of this blood we are loosed
[12:36] from our bondage of sin from the power
[12:41] of sin from the very defilement of sin
[12:47] we have been set free by the blood of
[12:52] God which is the blood of our Lord the
[12:55] blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and this
[12:59] loosing is perfect and complete for we
[13:04] are perfect in him on the other
[13:07] righteousness of God in him we were
[13:11] chosen in him and in
[13:14] him we have redemption through Jesus
[13:17] Christ our Lord but a shed blood of the
[13:21] Lamb of God hallelujah and therefore
[13:25] there is no condemnation there is no
[13:31] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[13:35] Jesus
[13:36] thanks God hallelujah amen amen
[13:40] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[13:43] God's elect it is God that justify it or
[13:49] in other words it's God that has
[13:51] declared us righteous it is God hostak
[13:56] that has declared us sinless washed most
[14:00] freed by the blood of God himself who is
[14:06] he that condemneth it is Christ that
[14:10] died hallelujah
[14:12] Romans eight the 33 to 34 amen praise
[14:17] God and it took his death to give us
[14:22] this great prescription of the blood for
[14:26] when the people in the book of Acts
[14:29] realized that they were infected with
[14:32] the virus of sin they asked doctor Peter
[14:37] Simon Peter what shall we do to be saved
[14:40] and dr. Simon Peter answered repent and
[14:45] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[14:49] for the remission of your sins and
[14:51] furthermore there is no other name given
[14:55] under heaven whereby we must be saved
[14:58] but the name of Jesus Christ our Lord
[15:01] hallelujah glory to God so friends I
[15:05] tell you don't listen to men for we have
[15:09] been made free and guiltless or our
[15:13] guilt free condemnation is gone
[15:17] the blood of Christ has washed it away
[15:20] from us and set us free
[15:24] sitting sinless
[15:26] and faultless before the truth of
[15:29] Almighty God you are loosed but a blood
[15:34] of Jesus Christ

[16:09] tied down by the traditions of man by
[16:12] the Creed's of man or by various Church
[16:17] darkness don't allow that anymore and
[16:20] don't be led astray by listening to
[16:23] those who denied the power of the blood
[16:27] denied the power of the world and deny
[16:31] that Jesus is our God our Savior our
[16:37] healer God our Baptizer with the Holy
[16:41] Spirit God our coming God our soon
[16:47] coming King

[17:23] reading half of that verse and had made
[17:27] us kings and priests unto God and his
[17:31] father to him be glory and Dominion for
[17:37] ever and ever
[17:40] amen glory to God he had made us again
[17:45] he loosed us now it's him salvation is
[17:51] of the Lord salvation is not of works
[17:55] it's not a man it's not by merit it's
[17:58] not by anything it's not even by our
[18:02] sincerity salvation is by God's works in
[18:07] our life he has made us kings and
[18:12] priests unto the Lord
[18:16] salvation is his doing and salvation is
[18:21] all of grace it is by the grace of God
[18:26] not by works hallelujah thanks be to God
[18:31] amen I'm glad Martin Luther recognized
[18:34] that and had a revelation and broke from
[18:36] his traditions and his darkness and the
[18:39] old Creed's and walked away into the
[18:42] freedom of the revelation of the word of
[18:47] the Living God for he had made us kings
[18:51] and priests unto God hallelujah redeemed
[18:55] us and loosed us and did all of that
[19:01] friends and made us to be kings and
[19:04] priests so that now we are spiritual
[19:09] Kings oh thank God we reign over a
[19:14] spiritual Kingdom you may not realize it
[19:19] but we are in total Dominion and
[19:24] authority over the kingdoms of darkness
[19:28] over the kingdoms of this world over
[19:32] everything
[19:33] we are kings unto the Living God
[19:37] anointed by the Holy Spirit
[19:40] behold mark 16:15 behold I give you
[19:44] power power over all sickness all the
[19:50] day
[19:51] all those powers you do power to lay
[19:54] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[19:57] recover sickness germs demon powers all
[20:02] other things come under your authority
[20:06] which was taken away from Adam Adam lost
[20:11] his inheritance there in the garden but
[20:14] here
[20:14] Adams inheritance and the inheritance of
[20:17] this second Adam is restored back to the
[20:21] people of God the trimming of God we are
[20:24] in a place where we are restored back
[20:27] into our divine authority which God gave
[20:31] to us so here we are a spiritual Kings
[20:34] ruling right now and reigning with him
[20:39] over a spiritual Kingdom where our
[20:44] commands must be obeyed and every other
[20:48] power upon this earth even those
[20:53] so-called
[20:53] princes and powers of heavenly places
[20:56] are in subjection to us they are
[21:00] defeated by Jesus Christ and he has
[21:02] given us his authority to rule and reign
[21:07] over them now we are drawn spiritual
[21:11] kings now and we will be kings in the
[21:18] Millennial Kingdom to reign upon this
[21:22] earth with him Colossians 1 3 the
[21:28] scripture says who had delivered us from
[21:33] the power of darkness and that
[21:37] translated us into the kingdom of his
[21:43] dear son so right now we are reigning
[21:47] spiritually with the Lord Jesus Christ
[21:49] and whoever discovers sin over our flesh
[21:54] and over the world systems and over the
[22:00] devil and all of his influences and we
[22:04] are
[22:04] and we're showing that we have conquered
[22:08] and defeated Satan by the part to
[22:11] display and manifests the life of Jesus
[22:16] Christ which Satan has tried to prevent
[22:19] you and I in every way from doing that
[22:24] but by victory over him this glorious
[22:28] victory and the love divine we are able
[22:30] to manifest the life of the Lord Jesus
[22:35] Christ and show him forth to the people
[22:38] that they can recognize that Christ in
[22:41] you God lives in you and makes himself
[22:45] known through you Christ in us working
[22:50] willing and performing things for his
[22:54] own purposes and for his own good
[22:58] pleasure yes my friends even now we are
[23:02] a spiritual kings and priests seated in
[23:06] heavenly places in the Lord Jesus Christ
[23:10] and giving glory praise and honor to his
[23:14] marvelous name not only has he loosed us
[23:19] washed us freed us not only had he made
[23:23] us kings to rule and reign with him but
[23:28] my Lord is so gracious he has made us
[23:32] priests unto Him and again let me stress
[23:36] he has made us not by our just our
[23:41] desire not by our will power not by our
[23:46] might not by any hour even our own
[23:50] choices but he has made us priests yes
[23:56] priests unto him and you know what
[23:58] priests do priests up give offerings on
[24:03] behalf of the people they stand as
[24:06] intermediaries they stand in the gap Oh
[24:11] for the glory and praise of God and so
[24:15] he has
[24:16] prease puts us into the position for his
[24:21] purpose so we was saved with a purpose
[24:24] we have created for a purpose and here
[24:29] he has made us priests that we might
[24:33] offer him the offering of praise that we
[24:38] might praise his holy name and that our
[24:41] offering of praise will go before him
[24:44] like a sweet smelling perfume acceptable
[24:48] in his presence Oh glory to God he has
[24:53] made us priests that we may offer not
[24:57] just our praise but our lives as living
[25:01] sacrifices holy and acceptable to God
[25:05] which is but a reasonable service after
[25:08] what our he has done for us
[25:11] at dark Calvary we are here as priests
[25:15] also that we may worship Him we may
[25:20] glorify him along with the twenty-four
[25:23] elders and along with all those
[25:27] thousands upon ten thousands in the
[25:30] heavens above that give glory to the
[25:33] name of this great and mighty God
[25:37] hallelujah for thou art the Lord God
[25:40] Almighty we lift our hands and worship
[25:43] to thee to give your glory and honor and
[25:47] praise hallelujah yes sir
[25:50] so we given the offering an offering by
[25:54] being in the spirit while we worship we
[25:58] give him this offering my friends by
[26:01] being in the truth while we worship
[26:04] being made sure we are in the revelation
[26:07] of God while we're worshiping and not to
[26:10] be those who know not what they worship
[26:13] but some that worship Him with a lot of
[26:16] spirit
[26:17] a lot of emotion but they lack the truth
[26:22] then there are those who are filled with
[26:25] the truth but they left
[26:28] spirit but right down the center of this
[26:31] narrow way goes a little slop that
[26:34] worships him and gives him the offering
[26:38] of worship by worshipping Him in spirit
[26:41] and in truth
[26:43] give living lines of intercession living
[26:48] prayer lives genuine prayer lives which
[26:52] is nothing less to have a prayer life is
[26:54] to have a consistent life of prayer all
[26:58] things be the God petitioning us priests
[27:02] and interceding for others praying for
[27:06] others requesting for others with such
[27:09] humility with such love and grace not
[27:13] thinking of oneself but reaching out to
[27:16] the Lord on the behalf of others that he
[27:19] may bless them and you know when you
[27:21] pray with that sincere prayer of a
[27:24] righteous man when love projects grace
[27:27] takes over and when grace takes over
[27:30] miracles happen healing happen healings
[27:33] happen all kinds of supernatural takes
[27:37] place because of the the Spirit of the
[27:39] Living God working in the length of the
[27:42] believer who he had made chosen shaped
[27:46] and formed and presented the personality
[27:50] and their and their position to be
[27:53] priests unto him that is why my friends
[27:57] the things of this world holds no
[28:00] attraction for us there is no magnet in
[28:03] the world for us that will pull us away
[28:06] for if he said if I be lifted up I will
[28:10] draw all men unto myself hallelujah I
[28:14] trust he draws you here tonight to
[28:17] himself or draws you a closer to him if
[28:20] you are a believer closer to him in your
[28:24] walk with Him closer to him in your
[28:27] talks with him your fellowship with him
[28:31] your prayer with him that he will draw
[28:33] you closer deeper higher every day
[28:37] walking in this wonderful precious way
[28:40] Thanks being a god hallelujah we are a
[28:44] peculiar people we are that speckled
[28:48] bird spoken of in the Bible speckled by
[28:51] the blood of its mate
[28:53] Oh glory to God and loosed by his blood
[28:57] set free by the blood of Jesus Christ
[29:00] because He died for us we do not let
[29:05] friends have to bear that condemnation
[29:08] anymore we are a peculiar people chosen
[29:13] of God and crawled by the spirit set up
[29:18] part vessels for his glory and for his
