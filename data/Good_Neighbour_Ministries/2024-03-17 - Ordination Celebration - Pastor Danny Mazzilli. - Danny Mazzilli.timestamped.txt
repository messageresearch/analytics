[36:13] years according to the measure of the
[36:15] gift of
[36:16] Christ wherefore he said when he
[36:19] ascended up high he captivity cap and
[36:24] gave gifts
[36:26] unto ascended what is it but he also
[36:38] descended sorry about
[36:40] that now that he ascended what is it but
[36:44] that he also descended first into the
[36:47] lower parts of the earth he that
[36:50] descended is the same also that ascended
[36:55] far above all Heavens that he might fill
[36:58] all things and he gave some Apostles and
[37:02] some prophets and some evangelists and
[37:06] some pastors and some teachers for the
[37:10] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[37:13] the ministry for the edifying of the
[37:16] body of Christ till we all come into the
[37:20] unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[37:23] of the Son of God unto perfect man unto
[37:27] to the measure of the Statue of the
[37:30] fullness of Christ God bless you thank
[37:33] you Minister beers and now we will have
[37:37] Minister Christopher Fong reading to us
[37:42] out of uh
[37:46] John praise the
[37:49] Lord reading from John 5 from verse 14-
[37:55] 16 afterwards
[37:58] Jesus finded him in the temple and said
[38:01] unto him behold Thou Art made whole sin
[38:06] no more lest the worst thing come upon
[38:10] thee the man departed and told the Jews
[38:14] that it was Jesus which had made him
[38:17] hold and therefore did the Jews
[38:20] persecute Jesus and sought to slay him
[38:23] because he had done these things on the
[38:26] Sabbath day day amen thank you Minister
[38:30] beers but I have to thank you very much
[38:33] for reading that that's my mistake and
[38:35] writing it down I wrote down the wrong
[38:38] scripture that's not the scripture I
[38:40] wanted but somehow God knows where it
[38:42] fits in to this this entire thing right
[38:48] uh let me uh read what I have here John
[38:52] 15 reading from
[38:54] 14 you are my friend
[38:58] s if you do whatsoever I command
[39:04] you henceforth I call you no more
[39:08] servants for the servant knoweth not
[39:12] what his Lord
[39:15] doeth but I have called you friends for
[39:19] all things that I have heard of my
[39:22] father I have made known unto you
[39:29] you have not chosen
[39:31] me but I have
[39:35] chosen
[39:36] you and ordained
[39:41] you that you should go and bring forth
[39:45] much
[39:46] fruit and that your fruit should
[39:51] remain and whatsoever you shall ask of
[39:54] the father in my name he may give it
[39:58] to
[39:59] you now you must understand that the
[40:03] word ordained is really nowhere else in
[40:08] the Bible except when Jesus used it here
[40:12] saying I ordain
[40:16] you now we know that n's
[40:21] ordination is not uh just here on the
[40:26] Earth But as God spoke to Jeremiah and
[40:31] said I know you from before you were
[40:36] even in your mother's
[40:38] womb and I called you to be a prophet
[40:44] thank you
[40:45] Jesus and so we see at this
[40:48] time that God's call has come to our
[40:53] precious brother now the word ordained
[40:57] really means to
[40:59] appoint I've appointed you to be a
[41:03] prophet it means also to place someone
[41:06] in a position Place placing of a son so
[41:11] so I have ordained you or placed
[41:15] you or set you apart in this particular
[41:20] position to do a certain
[41:24] job and so as it was in the book of Acts
[41:29] we find out that Paul and Barnabas were
[41:33] set apart you know how the elders the
[41:38] spirit of God revealed it to the elders
[41:41] these are the ones to go out and to be
[41:44] missionaries and then what did the
[41:46] elders do they laid their hands upon
[41:50] Paul and Barnabas prayed over them and
[41:54] then sent them out as missionaries to
[41:57] the glory of God we want to do the same
[42:00] thing here for God's glory and for God's
[42:04] honor so ordination in short uh reveals
[42:09] to us God's call to
[42:13] Ministry and to carry out his Divine
[42:16] will it also the Earthly ordination I'm
[42:20] speaking of speaks of the church's
[42:23] approval of that
[42:26] individual as they carry out God's
[42:30] will it is also an
[42:33] acknowledgment that God has bestowed
[42:37] certain spiritual gifts into the life of
[42:41] this individual we know and call
[42:45] Danny to be able to perform the the work
[42:49] that he has prepared for him for God has
[42:52] said clearly I will send no one into
[42:56] battle
[42:57] without providing them with the weapons
[43:00] that they
[43:01] need he says first of all who will send
[43:04] a soldier to war and not provide him
[43:07] with the weapons he needs will I send
[43:10] you to go to my work and not provide you
[43:14] with the gifts the weapons that you need
[43:16] to do the job that is the way God looks
[43:19] at this of what he is
[43:22] doing therefore when we pray here uh we
[43:27] are we are not here to impart any gifts
[43:31] we are not here to lay hands and to add
[43:34] something to the individual we cannot do
[43:37] that God has already bestowed upon that
[43:43] individual and fill them with those
[43:46] things for his
[43:48] glory now what I'm saying that the
[43:51] individual may not even be conscious
[43:53] that those qualities powers and
[43:56] influences were embedded within their
[43:59] lives but as they step into the office
[44:03] they grow in maturity in that
[44:06] position and then these things begin to
[44:09] exude it begins to flow out of them and
[44:13] they become a greater blessing than they
[44:16] thought in their own mind because it's
[44:20] God's will being done his glory that we
[44:24] are here for today and I pray that God's
[44:27] spirit will rest upon our
[44:30] brother God will fertilize his mind his
[44:34] heart God will bless him in such a way
[44:39] that he will go beyond himself amen and
[44:43] move as we say in the spirit of almighty
[44:46] God Amen and become a blessing to all
[44:50] who come in contact with him amen amen
[44:56] yes sir so this
[44:59] individual now being
[45:03] ordained I believe he should live an
[45:07] exemplary life I believe he's already
[45:10] living one but I am still here to say
[45:14] these words that he might hear it again
[45:18] by repetition that it might rest within
[45:21] his soul that he should live an
[45:24] exemplary life he becomes the model
[45:27] for the church the model for the young
[45:31] people the model for all those who cast
[45:36] their eyes upon him he is the
[45:40] representative uh here that you should
[45:44] model and recognize that God is using
[45:48] him for his glory praise the Lord amen
[45:53] of course uh brother
[45:55] Danny your first responsibility is to
[45:59] the Lord Jesus Christ himself
[46:02] amen and your second responsibility is
[46:06] of course to the local
[46:09] church right that's what it is and to be
[46:13] in that position functioning as a leader
[46:17] and functioning in that way by your
[46:22] behavior uh the way you carry yourself
[46:25] so that uh the Jesus Christ may be
[46:29] reflected through your life to others
[46:33] amen and may you also grow into a
[46:37] greater and greater sense of
[46:41] responsibility to carry out this office
[46:45] amen hallelujah now I want to give
[46:50] brother Danny a charge and when I say
[46:54] I'm not using the word charge in the
[46:56] sense of an
[47:01] rest but just as God charged Joshua and
[47:06] says go but uh go but go with courage
[47:11] don't go in fear just go forward keep
[47:15] going forward Don't Look Backwards
[47:18] whatever happened behind there in the
[47:21] desert that's all behind you go
[47:24] forward amen and remember this I'll be
[47:28] with you you're not walking alone this
[47:32] unseen presence of a living God Who We
[47:35] Believe lives and Reigns today he is not
[47:40] dead he is no more in the grave he is
[47:43] not a statue on the wall he is not just
[47:45] a picture you have in your house you
[47:48] can't warm Yourself by a painted fire
[47:52] and we are here to live by the power and
[47:55] the presence the experience of a living
[47:58] God this God whom we talk about this
[48:02] eternal spirit when we come into a real
[48:05] Church of God like this and begin to
[48:07] talk about him his presence draws
[48:11] near we can't see him with our eyes but
[48:14] he promised us one day there'll be a
[48:17] Rapture and when there's a Rapture then
[48:20] we'll see him face to face and thank him
[48:24] and tell the story save by
[48:28] Grace Hallelujah
[48:31] Danny God has called you to this work of
[48:35] the
[48:36] ministry and the people sitting here has
[48:41] a have affirmed you in that position of
[48:46] this ministry because they've seen what
[48:49] has happened through the Expressions
[48:52] coming out of your life and out of your
[48:55] word words and preaching and work they
[48:59] have seen that in your life and the
[49:03] church today recognizes your
[49:07] call they recognize your call and we
[49:10] recognize it by setting you apart
[49:14] publicly as the prophet said a son comes
[49:18] to a certain place of maturity then he's
[49:20] taken out into a public place and there
[49:24] he is placed into his
[49:27] position right so we thank you for being
[49:31] here today and trust God that you will
[49:34] live up to this great
[49:38] responsibility
[49:40] I recommend you and commend you to the
[49:45] scriptures that God has given us hold to
[49:49] God's word as we love to sing that old
[49:54] song Hold to God's unchanging

[50:13] Eternal hold to God's
[50:17] unchanging
[50:19] hand
[50:21] amen I want you to pay attention
[50:25] especially to the words of our Lord
[50:29] Jesus and allow his words and his
[50:33] teaching to be a directive a charge to
[50:38] your entire
[50:42] Ministry oh may God help you I've been
[50:46] to the Mount of
[50:48] Beatitudes several
[50:50] times I wish that you could be there
[50:56] even if it's in your mind's eye and it
[51:00] sit with the young ministers the
[51:04] disciples that were sitting at the feet
[51:08] of the Lord Jesus as he instructed them
[51:12] on what it means to minister and to be a
[51:17] minister so what I'm saying is that you
[51:20] should allow the instructions that he
[51:23] gave those young ministers the Beed to
[51:27] as we know them to be let them be a a a
[51:31] direction a beacon for your life that
[51:34] you might live by the word of the Living
[51:37] God Amen let that be a charge for your
[51:41] ministry and remember you are the salt
[51:45] the influence that comes from your life
[51:49] comes from your heart through your lips
[51:51] by the preaching of the word it goes out
[51:55] it touches the light of others to
[51:58] transform lives to change Hearts change
[52:01] homes change young people deliver people
[52:05] just as Jesus preached the word and
[52:08] deliver men and women from
[52:12] demons now you said oh the devil has
[52:15] disappeared there's no more devil
[52:17] there's a still a real devil in the
[52:20] world he still corrupts he still lies he
[52:24] still cheats and robs you of your peace
[52:27] of mind he'll rob you of your health
[52:31] he'll rob you of of your the the
[52:33] Tranquility of your home he'll rob you
[52:37] in every possible way he'll addict you
[52:40] to something or the other he will
[52:42] misdirect you from off of the genuine
[52:46] Bible in some way or the other but you
[52:49] stay close to the word and hold to God's
[52:54] unchanging hand amen that's the way you
[52:57] ought to do it amen you are the salt of
[53:01] the earth you know salt is a great
[53:05] preservative if things are uh before
[53:09] things can even start rotting and you
[53:11] put some salt it will preserve that amen
[53:15] so God wants to use you as a
[53:18] preservative he wants you to be one that
[53:21] sheds forth uh light and life and Power
[53:27] and his presence working within your
[53:29] life amen amen so you are God's light to
[53:34] a world of
[53:36] Darkness you're
[53:38] finding and you know this there are less
[53:42] and less people in the world that have
[53:45] integrity honesty
[53:47] truthfulness that will live by God's
[53:50] word they think it's oldfashioned to be
[53:53] honest to be truthful to have integrity
[53:56] to Stand by Your Word and to Stand By
[53:59] God's word you think that's oldfashioned
[54:02] and that's just for you people go to
[54:04] church and you get emotional they don't
[54:06] realize it's
[54:08] real and when you check when you realize
[54:11] it it's real and then you want to live
[54:14] your life that way praise God hallelujah
[54:18] so that's my chge so you be a light so
[54:21] that others can see they won't see the
[54:23] original Jesus that was back there 199
[54:26] 100 years ago but they can see at least
[54:29] men and women and pointing to you as the
[54:33] new pastor of Good Neighbor Ministries
[54:36] that they can look at you and see the
[54:39] Life of Christ reflected through you
[54:42] thus bringing glory and honor to his
[54:45] great name amen praise God and we being
[54:50] as the scripture says Jesus said be ye
[54:53] perfect as your heavenly father is
[54:55] perfect amen so you are to try to be
[54:59] perfect as much as you can Hallelujah
[55:03] now we know no earthly man can't really
[55:05] be perfect you're going to stumble here
[55:08] you're going to stumble there you'll
[55:10] make mistakes but the point is God is
[55:13] letting you know I've placed something
[55:15] in you that will keep you I plac the
[55:19] word which is an anchor in you storms
[55:22] may come your mass may be broken your
[55:25] ship may be shattered it may move from
[55:28] every side to side but you have an
[55:30] anchor that will keep your soul it keep
[55:33] your being amen he'll hold you amen so
[55:37] hold to God's unchanging hand God bless
[55:42] you in every possible way and you know
[55:46] even though I'm using some notes that I
[55:50] plac together here during the week that
[55:53] is not just the notes you know this is
[55:55] coming from my heart uh to you and may
[55:59] God bless you in every way praise God
[56:02] follow the lord Jesus's directions to
[56:08] pray be a man of
[56:11] prayer that will separate himself every
[56:14] servant of God in the Bible right
[56:17] through were men of prayer they'll steal
[56:21] away somewhere by themselves they'll
[56:24] quiet themselves that they can hear the
[56:28] voice of God speaking to them either in
[56:31] their
[56:32] conscience or sometimes literal all of
[56:37] us are not blessed to hear the vocal or
[56:42] uh you know
[56:44] auditory um God's voice like that but
[56:48] most of the times he'll speak into our
[56:51] heart and we recognize that's different
[56:53] that wasn't my thought I never thought
[56:55] of any such such a thing and when you
[56:57] know that God will use that for his
[57:00] glory amen hallelujah now learn to be
[57:06] forgiven
[57:07] giving and also learn to forgive
[57:10] yourself right uh that's very important
[57:13] that we learn to forgive ourselves
[57:16] because some people don't know how to
[57:18] forgive themselves and they keep
[57:20] condemning themselves for one little
[57:23] mistake or stumble that they made yeah
[57:26] no you must not only forgive others but
[57:30] also learn to forgive yourself very
[57:34] important amen and put your trust your
[57:38] faith your confidence not in natural
[57:40] things right but put your uh trust in
[57:45] Heavenly things think about the things
[57:49] that are above praise the Lord and God
[57:52] will bless you in every way
[57:54] amen heaven the kingdom of God will
[57:58] provide all your needs God will provide
[58:01] your needs we know God has a plan and
[58:04] his plan is right here in the church
[58:06] you've heard it preached God said it
[58:09] that he sends his servants and even from
[58:11] the Old Testament he says the priests
[58:15] are going to minister to you as you plow
[58:19] the fields and King your uh you know
[58:22] carry on your flocks from that you will
[58:25] take at least least 10% and let that be
[58:29] given to that priest and that has
[58:32] followed right down through the Bible to
[58:34] the New Testament and so to this time we
[58:38] know God will provide our brothers needs
[58:42] it's not us because what you are giving
[58:44] there is not even your
[58:46] own right because God said it's my tithe
[58:49] that's the my tith you give it to me I
[58:53] give it to the
[58:54] priest that he might might be able to
[58:56] take care of himself and of the house of
[58:59] God that is here before you amen so
[59:04] build on the Lord Jesus
[59:06] Christ because you're building on a rock
[59:10] and when the storms come it won't be
[59:13] able to shake that house because you
[59:15] built it on a sure
[59:18] Foundation amen I repeat again pattern
[59:22] your ministry after the Lord Jesus
[59:25] himself
[59:26] and thus you will become his hands amen
[59:30] you believe we can become his hands amen
[59:33] you can become you will become his
[59:36] voice praise God hallelujah you become
[59:40] his heart loving the world loving the
[59:43] suffering the dying the trouble the
[59:46] tried the tested the tempted yes your
[59:49] whole heart will go out as his went out
[59:53] he'll give that that to you that you
[59:56] might be one with him amen praise the
[1:00:00] Lord so be like him a
[1:00:05] teacher be like him one that is filled
[1:00:09] with the
[1:00:10] meekness feed my sheep he said to Peter
[1:00:14] and feed my
[1:00:16] Lambs don't only feed those mature ones
[1:00:20] that need uh the mysteries of the word
[1:00:24] of God being preached to them but learn
[1:00:26] how to teach the young those that are
[1:00:31] just coming up teach them the ABCs of
[1:00:35] the gospel and bring them into Christ
[1:00:39] Paul puts it this way the older ones
[1:00:41] they can eat the meat just like you
[1:00:43] wouldn't just take a piece of steak and
[1:00:46] put it in a baby's mouth and then Paul
[1:00:48] goes on to say the sincere milk of the
[1:00:51] word so some needs the milk of the word
[1:00:54] and some needs the meat of the word and
[1:00:57] you need to know when to minister that
[1:01:00] to that particular individual for God's
[1:01:04] glory
[1:01:06] amen so then go to all places that God
[1:01:10] will call you go to all people to whom
[1:01:14] God will call you go and make disciples
[1:01:18] as he said in Matthew 24 go and baptize
[1:01:23] in the name of the father and of the son
[1:01:26] and of the Holy Ghost who we know is the
[1:01:29] Lord Jesus Christ for Peter in Acts 2
[1:01:32] 238 knew what was the name of the father
[1:01:37] Son and Holy Ghost and he didn't go and
[1:01:39] just repeat that over people but he says
[1:01:41] go baptize them in the name of the Lord
[1:01:45] and Savior Jesus Christ amen hallelujah
[1:01:49] and teach others to
[1:01:52] observe only scriptural things
[1:01:56] things let them practice only scriptural
[1:02:00] things and as you go Remember You are
[1:02:04] not alone for Jesus said go For You are
[1:02:09] not alone I will be with you always even
[1:02:13] to the very end of the age that's why I
[1:02:17] say he's not in the grave but even now
[1:02:19] that we're talking about him he's here
[1:02:22] amen you believe that amen I believe
[1:02:26] he's here while the
[1:02:28] disciples were walking on the street on
[1:02:31] the road to EMAs they were talking about
[1:02:34] him and the Bible says and as they were
[1:02:37] speaking of him he drew
[1:02:39] near he drew near he was supposed to be
[1:02:43] dead but he drew near and this is the
[1:02:45] same way we are on our way to glory and
[1:02:49] we're just talking about him and you
[1:02:51] just think it's casual but it's not
[1:02:53] because when you begin to talk to him
[1:02:56] his presence draws near to us praise the
[1:03:00] name of the Lord God hallelujah brother
[1:03:03] Danny sister Jennifer you come before
