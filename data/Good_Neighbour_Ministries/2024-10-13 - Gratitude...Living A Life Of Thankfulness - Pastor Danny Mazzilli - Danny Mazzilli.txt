into Heavenly places how many are excited about being in the house of the Lord this morning amen there's no other place no other place that I would rather be on any on any day of the week I'd love to just be fellowshipping and rejoicing but we also have the cares of this life that we must deal with amen and so um thank God that we have the opportunity to come together on Sunday mornings to Fellowship around his word amen you may be seated just for for a few moments um we want to welcome all our visitors and all of you this morning into the house of the Lord very grateful that you're here this morning and that there are people that are excited about hearing what the Lord would have for us amen because that's what this is all about this is about coming into the presence of the Lord with Thanksgiving in our hearts so that we can receive all that he has for us so that we can receive strength Amen to to meet the challenges that lay before us each each and every day amen praise God and so just a few things I want to thank God for brother Desmond he's back from Africa um he was out there doing some um some personal business and also uh in the business of the Lord amen we have a missions work that we've started there that we are assisting um a small new small group of uh Believers right there in brother Desmond's Hometown correct right in his hometown in Ghana and so we are financially assisting in the building of a new church for these Believers and we're just trusting God he's going to you know um progress this work and uh by his grace um make it possible for us to continue to support it financially until they have a a church building that they can worship and praise God in amen so we thank God for your giving towards the missions continue to give we want to be a river that lives and flows we want life to flow in we want life to flow out we want our offerings to flow in and we want them to flow out so that it keeps the body alive we are a living uh testimony of the word of God for this hour amen praise God and so brother Desmond will have an opportunity on Wednesday to share with us um a little bit more on what is going on there okay so we'll we'll leave it at that listen we prayed for a family a pastor um in India who um is a message believer for many years has a a Ministry established church there and they were attacked because he had you know testified and converted a Muslim to the word of God and the message of the hour while the devil got real upset and so they put a false accusation against him that um that he burnt the Coran and so all of a sudden they're after him to really to you know they'll they'll they'll kill him and his family so they had to go into isolation they had to go into hiding and so they are now there's a there's a a work in progress to get them out of India all right and so brother Dana who knows the brother personally has been there with the brother okay so you know after talking to brother Dana I you know the Holy Spirit just laid it on on our on our heart you know my on my heart and you know I said we need to do something and so we have participated in giving financially towards this so keep that family in prayer keep them in prayer they're supposed to be getting them out I believe it was all in progress they had gotten to the airport at one point and then they got stopped because of some documentation issues and so they held them they missed their flight and but then um there's other things in progress to get them out they may already be out by now okay so let's continue to pray and let's continue to give because we don't know where the Lord is going to lead us from time to time to support this type of um emergency that can raise up right amongst our Brethren amen praise God also uh this week I came across um and found out that uh uh Pastor Donnie Reagan and his church Word of Life in in um uh Johnsonville um Johnson City I believe that's in Tennessee right yeah um they started an effort to assist the people of Florida with the flood relief and so um what they've done is they've you know they've they've just put out a call it started with just one of the brothers in the church connecting with some people that he found out needed some serious help and that sparked some something where the Lord just moved supernaturally on his ministry and they started to um put out a call and there was a great response that came out um from many churches across the US they started to give they started to donate there are message churches that were seriously affected by the floods churches flooded out serious damage Etc but more importantly people needed the necessities of life and so they started this work and over the last two weeks they've delivered 77 truck loads and 28 full trailers of supplies to people in Florida where they were most affected they prepared over 1670 hot meals that were delivered they helped to clear roads the funds went to help to clear roads and an estimated 175 lives were saved between digging them out getting supplies to them Etc that's how serious this event and this hurricane was Hurricane helina amen and so the Lord allowed us to be participants in that so that we gave or in are in the process of giving right now towards this relief um so thank God for this wonderful work that the Lord is doing we're his hands we're his feet and you know you know these things come up and it's great that we can help those that are in other countries in Africa and India and so forth and we will do that but sometimes it hits right at home and we need to be prepared to do what we can to support and and do what we can to help these these unfortunate people that have been seriously affected by this so God bless you continue to give as the Lord leads give to the missions give to the relief for these types of things we want to be able to give and be channels for the Lord amen praise God glory to God okay so let's let's move on now um we know that this week um you know last week we we ministered on uh the Feast of the Trumpets on rashash Shana and this week this weekend it ends up with yam Kapur uh it's a Jewish feast and Festival amongst the um the the Jewish Believers and so um you know I just thought you know that's not my topic today we'll see how the Lord leads us but I just thought I would just you know bring this here today uh just a a quote from Brother Brenham from the Feast of the trumpets so we understand what's really going on you know prophetically in the world with Israel and the church and so here now brother Bram speaking here in the message he says now here is the calling out at the six seal when it was opened the persecution struck the Jews in the literal standpoint and we know that you know there was a there was a persecution that came against the Jews and here comes the persecution to the church because remember this is Israel and the church the church is the spiritual Israel being the natural what we see happening in Israel we know spiritually the church has gone through the same type of persecution like it did through the Dark Ages and so forth there's always been a persecution for the true church that's why when the word was made flesh came to the Earth they persecuted him amen they they they crucified the word amen and so but we need to understand what's going on and from a uh so he says here in the e e e e ecclesiastical standpoint because the bride is already called the sabbaths are over and ready for the Jews now to be called amen amen and so the sabbaths are over the Feast of atonement oh Church don't don't you see that called To The Feast of atonement what to recognize the atonement not no more chickens and geese and you know they would sacrific lambs and so forth and what they're doing but the Lamb of God slain from the foundation of the world Israel is going to know that they're going to receive their atonement their Awakening that's what this weekend is yam Kapur is about them coming to their atonement coming to recognize you know that that they've sinned and that they've that they actually missed the the they're going to recognize that they missed the Messiah but God's going to send them two prophets amen and they're going to have their Awakening but guess where we're going to be hallelujah we're going to be in glory amen the church goes into the Rapture because when those two prophets come on the scene this world is going to go into some serious three and 1/2 year tribulation amen so praise God so let's all stand now we're going to go to our message for today I just thought I would just make a comment on that so that we can recognize and you know when you see all of this going on and everything that's happening right now with Israel and Iran this is serious business Saints this is this is all scriptural Iran has always been behind you know we don't want to get into it all right now but let's see how the Lord leads us as we go forward over these next few weeks amen today um we're going to be talking let's go to the next slide we're going to talk about gratitude how many knows we're in Thanksgiving amen amen amen and so gratitude is something that you know um we need to have a clear understanding on and I believe that if we do our lives will be enhanced amen amen especially us that really have something to be grateful for amen it's all about living a life of gratitude and so you know it's um you know living a grateful life isn't easy it's it's not easy but it's worth it amen it's worth it to be grateful and to be thankful for everything that we receive in life amen you know that there's healing in having an attitude of gratitude amen praise God we're going to be looking at a few things and so let's just pray now father we're asking you Lord as we approach the word of God this morning in this thought of gratitude and living a life of thankfulness Lord we know it's not easy it's something that we literally we we need to be deliberate at times in giving thanks and showing gratitude for the things that we take for granted sometimes Lord help us to understand this more let your spirit ride upon the word this morning give us voice give us utterance let your spirit give us discernment oh God and may the hearts and the the lives of the people receive exactly what we need this morning so that we can live Victorious lives in this day with victory of gratitude and thankfulness Grant it we pray father father bless your people now in Jesus name amen glory to God let's go to the um video you may be seated we got a short video that we want to share with you it's slide number three [Music] [Music] [Applause] amen simple but very true amen let's read our scripture let's all stand Hebrews 13: 12-6 says wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate you know we're talking about gratitude but I want us to really focus on what we really are grateful for amen and Jesus came so that we could experience real true gratitude let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his Repro his reproach for here have we no continuing City but we seek one to come by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices God is well pleased Hallelujah the Lord add His blessings to the word you may be seated amen if there's something saints that we need to be truly grateful for is the fact that that that we've been given the ability to recognize the Plan of Redemption God's Plan of Redemption it started way before the foundations of the world but it manifested here on Earth about 2,00 years ago when Jesus Christ God himself was made flesh came to the Earth and he had to Bear the reproach outside of the camp he was not accepted no he's still not fully accepted in this generation he's only accepted by those that have truly recognized and have have realized the word of God for their day that Jesus Christ is in a is in is in the present stage of his ministry that he is speaking healing delivering opening the eyes of the understanding of those that are still requiring the healing of of blindness to the true word of God but you know what it requires it it requires for us to go outside of our normal Camp it requires for us to to step outside of our comfort zone and stand for the word of God the pure unadulterated word of God Amen not to tell the people you got to be perfect you got to live a perfect life oh look at me I live a perfect life shame on you if you think you live a perfect life you do not live a perfect life there's nobody that can live a perfect life the only perfect life is Jes Jesus Christ God himself and if he's in you then then that's holy you're not holy but he is the holy one that's in you and it's not your righteousness it's his righteousness amen and so for us to be able to stand and you know to to stand the reproach for the word of God we've got to know that we know it's then that we can truly be grateful and we can't be afraid you know to to to live this life to communicate it to allow it to be expressed through the Gratitude in our lives to let people you know say hey what are you thankful for this Thanksgiving there's nothing that comes to my mind that I could ever be more thankful for than the fact that the word of God has been revealed in my heart to know that those oh I see the conditions of the world I see all that's taking place around us in this world what what what could be what could we be uh more grateful for amen praise God listen listen to brother brandom here he speaks here you know um from the beginning it wasn't so from the message in 1959 re Reverend William brandom he says tomorrow is Thanksgiving a day that set aside where our Pilgrim forefathers set that day aside to give thanks to God for what they had amen what he had done for us for blessing them giving them crops and so forth It's one real American day all the other days like St Patrick and so forth they come from across the sea but this is an American holiday amen Thanksgiving day he says tonight I want to say that there's so many things that I'm thankful for I don't know how to give thanks to God for so many blessings be sure to remember that tomorrow if your church has service attend I'm glad that we're here this morning if you don't have church service then at home get the family together sit down take God's word and read it amen tell your children about it tell them that this nation was built upon such as that our forefathers who fought to bring this freedom to us and left the other countries so that we could have freedom of worship and freedom of speech and freedom of press and so forth we're thankful yet for it we don't know how long it will last that way but I say this long may our lands be bright with Freedom's Holy Light amen protect us by thy might great God our King amen amen praise God if there's a message that we need to uh you know share with the people is that there is no real hope or future except for the coming of the Lord Jesus this world has a prophetic timetable amen it's under that timetable right now we don't know how much longer this Earth is going to remain in the condition that it is I can tell you for many countries right now they're already experiencing Great Tribulation amen they're already experiencing their homes being blown up look at what just took place in Florida this is all part of the prophecy of this world that it's going to come and go into Great Tribulation ation that that there's going to be natural disasters like never before do you know that every year there's a new natural disaster that that breaks the record of the previous natural disaster why because it's not going to get better on Earth amen and that's why the only safe place is Jesus Christ the only safe place when when Noah received his message in his day God said build an ark Hallelujah today God saying to you build a life around Jesus Christ let him be your force field let him be the shackles that that that shackle you and keep you in in the safe place in God's Ark which is God's word amen let the Holy Spirit be your breastplate Hallelujah let the helmet of Faith be something that you put on because it's the only thing the only safe place here on Earth amen praise God hallelujah so you know um we've we've heard that song Count Your Blessings well it's not just a good song it's something we need to practice amen we need to look and and and recognize that God has bestowed upon us so many blessings and we need to we need to express it we need to show it need to deliberately you know intentionally do things that show gratitude in our lives amen you know that when you come into the house of the Lord when you join and you you you you become a a member in in a local assembly somewhere under the leadership of of the Holy Spirit you are in the service of the Lord amen and that is intentional service unto God and that you can be blessed as a result of that amen praise God let's go to the next slide what is gratitude gratitude is the practice of actively remembering and expressing the grace benefits we do not deserve that's what Grace is we didn't deserve the grace of God in our lives that he would come in and say forgiven amen hallelujah forgiven like you never done it in the first place what kind of mercy and Grace is that amen we didn't deserve that and goodness bestowed upon Our Lives amen praise God you know it's um I I took some a short list of the top 10 benefits you know from one author online and these are the top 10 benefits number one gratitude has lasting positive effects on the brain this is scientifically proven am somebody that's positive true somebody that's positive is usually somebody that's very grateful amen think about it positive people are grateful people negative people they're not they're they're they're miserable they're they're they're you know like we saw in the video instead of focusing on the good they focus F us on the grievance they focus on the bad amen and so when when you've got negative thoughts there's no way you can produce real gratitude gratitude boosts the immune system Hallelujah gratitude reduces stress anxiety and depression thank you Jesus gratitude promotes optimism and positivity gratitude number five helps create and strengthen relationships gratitude reduces chronic pain really it's a proven fact people that are positive that are grateful that are always showing thankfulness and living a life of thankfulness are people that are healthier they're just naturally healthier gratitude improves overall sleep gratitude Keeps Us grounded Ed in reality gratitude promotes exercise and healthy habits and gratitude improves our overall selfesteem amen these are just a few if you go online you could probably find all kinds of information surrounding gratitude but all of this positive info um you know brings us to a question on are you living living a life of gratitude are you grateful when you look to the left and to the right to your brothers and sisters are you really grateful for them do you realize that that you're one in a million and that the one next to you is also one in a million and the one to your right's one in a million and your pastor is one in a million your deacons your trustees your Sunday school teachers all of those that are you know in the household of Faith they're one in a million and you know you need to not only be grateful for those of the household of faith but you need to be grateful for your natural families for your work amen for your bosses and for your companies and and for your doctors and you know like listen I experienced something here just recently I'm grateful that we've got ohip and that we've got you know medical coverages here in Canada uh you know that sometimes we take it for granted but my daughter had an accident in Australia and she required emergency surgery on her knee lucky she had insurance coverage and the insurance coverage covered to bring her back from Australia to Canada it cost it cost the the insurance company over $1,000 to fly her home because she couldn't come in just a not natural seat you know like they had to put her into a a first class environment with her own bed and everything because of the situation that was going on in her leg and so but thank God she bought the insurance on her own that saved her a lot of money so there's a lesson for everybody you young people you're going out you're traveling all she was doing was going to play a friendly game of soccer and she ripped her meniscus in a serious way and and it required surgery but make sure you always take out insurance when you travel it's important because you never know what could happen but they would not cover the surgery there they said no because you have coverage in Canada you need to fly to your home country and have it done there and a surgery like that we costed it out it was like $22,000 thank God we've got the privilege of having medical coverage we need to be grateful for those things amen amen too many people are always bashing the the government for this bashing it for that why because they're focused on the negative focus on what's good and keep yourself healthy because negative people usually get sick Y and they're sick more often than they're not because it's a negative atmosphere that they bring around their lives amen praise God and so are you living a life of gratitude can you remember the last time that you took the time to thank God for all the things that we mentioned here this morning and we see that you know because it's a Bene a beneficial way to live doesn't mean it's easy CU it's not easy we go through times of difficulty we go through times of uh medical and you know health issues and so forth and that's never easy because we know the devil the enemy is going to constantly try to afflict us so that he can prove that God is Not A Healer but we keep coming back and saying Thank You Lord you are the Lord God that Health all my diseases oh thank you Lord You're Still the Lord God you still wish to prosper me Lord even in in health you see I thank you for that father and that defeats the enemy that puts a positive energy and sends the enforcer instantly into your life and into your situations to bring healing into your body amen glory to God let's take a look here we're going to look at a few examples through the scriptures of you know gratitude so let's go to our first scripture here in Luke uh chapter 17 from verse 11 to13 we're just going to move through it quickly and comment but I want you to draw some things here today this is not a deep message Saints this is practical things that we need to realize and recognize that you know if you want great miracles in your lives and you want to see God move you need to go back to the simple ABCs amen of always looking to see what the word says about you and your life and how you can live it better better amen so here he says and it and it came to pass Jesus as he went through Jerusalem that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee and as he entered into the certain Village there met him 10 men that were lepers which stood AAR off and they lifted up their voices and said Jesus Master have mercy on us now you know first of all in their calling out they must have known that Jesus was a Healer amen they must have known that that that he did certain things he did miracles for others and so they were in a state of desperation amen and they probably heard that Jesus was was a miracle healer amen and you know and that this was all part of his ministry as he moved from City to city and they came seeking healing for themselves as lepers amen you know leprosy is a type of sin leprosy is just another sickness when sickness comes into your life and it and it attacks your body we know that that is it's a devil disease is anything that's sickness is not of God God is the Healer of sickness amen so you know so sometimes sin you know we live lives and and we and we start to build all kinds of sin around our lives amen praise God well lepers back in that time they were forced to live in isolated communities you know there's a lot of people that are that are uh living lives isolated lives not knowing that Jesus Christ is is here today that's able to do like he did for them amen there's a lot of people that need to know that they don't have to stay in that condition they they they need to know that they don't have to allow sin to control their lives and keep them in a defeated you know medical condition or or financially beat down condition or a broken relationship condition amen they need to realize that Jesus Christ is here here present this morning and if you cry out to Jesus this morning anywhere wherever you are whether you're in the building you're out there online listen you're listen these 10 lepers are just like many people in this world living around us right now that are that are in isolation they don't know what to do they don't know how to get out of their situations well Jesus is here amen Jesus is able these people are living isolated situations in broken relationships broken financially broken medically well Jesus is here and he's able to do something all they needed to do was get his attention amen they they deliberately took the time to go because they heard that Jesus was coming amen some people just want to stay at home they want to just continue to live their lives the way that they are and they don't want to darken the walls of a church building where they can come and receive healing from the Lord Jesus Christ himself Hallelujah glory to God let's read the next scripture though this goes on and when he saw them he said unto them go show yourselves under the priests I'll tell you there's a lot of people that you know if they come into the presence of God you know you can just go back and think when God came into your life this was this was Supernatural what happened to these 10 lepers Jesus immediately healed them immediately told them go and tell your priests go and tell all those that you thought were we were you're uh you know we're going to do something for you you grew up thinking oh if I go to this church everything's going to be all right but Meanwhile your condition has never changed you're still in that defeated condition you're still dealing with that same sickness you're still in that rut of you know one week you're up the next week you're down one year you're financially up two years you're financially down one minute you've got a great relationship the next minute you got no relationship Oh Glory to God Amen they were in a rut but Jesus knew and you need to know and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed as they went they knew something had taken place and one of them now here's where we're going to draw something one of them when he saw that he was healed Hallelujah turned back and with a loud voice glorify God hallelujah glory to God listen I don't know about you but I remember when delivered me I was a loud voice glory to God I I knew that something real that taken place this wasn't just go to the altar go to church go to the altar cry go back and live the same life over and over again no sir this leper knew that he had been made whole he was he was not a leper anymore look he turned back with and he glorified Jesus he glorified God and fell down on his face at his feet giving thanks and he was a Samaritan Samaritans back then were were like pagans they weren't even they they were neither Gentile they were neither they were half and half they they didn't know what they were and and just like Jesus when he had need to go to Samaria by the by the to see a woman at a well amen that's the kind of life that these individuals were living but they knew just like you knew you were not living right you knew that you needed change in your life you knew that you didn't want to continue the way that you were you knew that there was no real future you'd look to your right you'd see problems with your relationships you look to the left you see problems with your health you look here you got all kinds of problems financially it's you were surrounded amen praise God but just One Touch One Touch just one contact with the Living Word with the Living Word listen Jesus you you may not see Jesus in the in the man of Jesus in this hour but he is the word amen that's where you need to find him you need to find him according to the word when the word says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that's the word speaking to you just like Jesus said to those lepers go and tell your priests amen it's the same thing amen praise God and so next slide here and Jesus answering said were there not 10 cleansed oh listen there's a lot of altar calls there's a lot of people that that have come to Jesus and their lives have been changed but a lot of them are just fading away they're not coming back in the way like he did that one leper he had to intentionally come back and realize and know that he knew that this was the Messiah those other nine they really didn't fully understand because they never came back to him they didn't realize the word that they had received they didn't realize the word for their day that he was the Messiah that would come and and take away the sins of the world not just their sin but everybody's sin hallelujah praise God you know Jesus responded to their suffering immediately he knew just like he knows us he knows who we are he knows where we were he knows the conditions that we've been facing and he's very seriously interested in dealing with your situation and providing for you where you are right now amen glory to God gratitude listen this this one leper he he intentionally came back because he knew something had happened he mentioned that that that uh he he was in intentional in coming back because where were the other nine he says were there not 10 but where are the nine there they are not found that return to give glory to God save this stranger and he said unto him and now listen carefully here Jesus now when he came back to give and show gratitude and to express his faith Jesus turn around and says to him go thy way arise go thy way for thy faith hath made thee whole we're not just talking about healing of the body here we're talking you know this this uh you know when when we read this scripture it makes mention of this scripture here in ways where whole means completely restored to recognize Mind Body and soul who you really are that's the Revelation that we have received that we are thankful for not just a joining of church not just a member in a church showing that we we got baptized and now we just go and live any way that we want no it's a life where you now come back over and over and over again to show that something real has has taken place in you and it's not something temporary a lot of people said 30 years ago oh Danny's just off on another one of his you know positive mental attitude things or he'll be back in a couple of weeks you know he'll he'll he'll he'll come back to himself no I never came back to myself amen thank you Jesus because that's not who I was I came to realize who I really was I was not that Danny misilli I was a Son of God am that was in a spiritual Amnesia living a life of complete and total darkness in many areas of my life sure there was there was light in my life but when I look back all the times where there was light it was where God unconsciously I wasn't aware of it but God was interceding and intervening in my life I would I can only go back and give him the the the the glory for for all the good things that happen in my life amen because good things people think you know listen I'm grateful for my family for my mother for my father amen they were good things in my life that was God ordaining from the foundations of the world chose my parents to send an attribute through them a Son of God Amen somebody that was going to come into their rightful position I'm talking about you this morning amen you're one in a million you were not supposed to uh end up in a life of complete and utter destruction you were ordained to hear this word and if you're a son or a daughter of God you're going to hear this word and it's it's going to change you you will not stay the same when you hear this Revelation this word this reality of Jesus Christ healing you and restoring you and being your savior amen glory to God and so here now we realize that you know healing in your body is a wonderful thing but the whole that Jesus is talking about when he says thy faith has made thee whole is total healing complete total healing salvation of your soul amen salvation now salvation of your soul is is that you awaken to who you really are amen it's not that some thing happened at that moment you go to the Altar and you come to the altar you realize you're a sinner you've been making a lot of mistakes you go to the Altar and you and you go there and and and the the the preacher prays over you and you leave if you truly haven't come to that contact with God where where he he you you know that he's touched you you know that that that he's awakened you yes what happens is you don't go home and and turn around and say oh I gave my life to the Lord that's what a lot of people say no if there's anything that you do you surrender your life amen but what really happened was I awakened out of my Amnesia I came out of of the life that I was living think that that thinking that that was my life but who I really am an attribute of God whose name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before this world before you came here you were always a Son of God you cannot listen if you're a son or a daughter of God you're Eternal you can't have a beginning you can't have an end you're a part of God being expressed in this day we were talking and fellowshipping about it last night and you know and the thought struck me that we are God expressing his story his story of being a father and so we're a part of his story because we are his children we are his sons and daughters and this whole Plan of Redemption that started you know before the foundations of the world in the mind of God it didn't just start in the 20th century here or when people started to hear about Jesus 2000 years ago it started way before this whole world began and you were in there back then but you had to come into a human body Express a life get caught into sin and wait for that day when you get to that state of desperation where you know that you need God now you there's nothing else that's going to that's going to fix this because you know that that attribute in you is ordained to contact God you you naturally in your carnal thinking and your own abilities you're looking at your conditions you're looking at the circumstances around your life and you're trying to figure out how in the world am I going to get out of this situation and that's where your focuses but the moment you made contact with the Supernatural and Revelation struck your heart to say you are not the son of Dominic and Ida mailli only you are here on this Earth but you are actually my child you are my son you are my daughter your life is not the life that you see around you I've got something ordained for you that I had planned for you that is going to place you In the End Time Imagine God chose the end time to Manifest this part of the story this part of his story because remember you're going to come to realize that it's him and you amen that's the only way you're overcoming that's the only way you're going to overcome whatever you're facing and you're dealing with right now the sooner you get to that place where you realize that it's greater that's he that's in you than he that's in the world the sooner you can live a life of gratitude a true life of Thanksgiving amen praise God to realize that your life can affect now you've come into a conscious realization you know who you are you're you're you're not the person that that that you know you were right up until that time where you gave your heart you allowed the Holy Spirit to you you surrendered to his will to his plan for your life that old life was was left buried in baptism that's why that's why you go into the water it's a symbol it literally is a symbol it's not you know people go into that tank a lot of times they go in dry Sinners they come out wet Sinners because nothing really changes on the inside but let there be one Revelation come into your heart of the reality of God you will not be the same person you will come out of there your life will never be the same you will look at situations differently you will know that that that there's things that have that have left your life you just don't have that desire anymore listen we're dealing with a supernatural God don't tell me that that leper when he looked at his hands and he saw he was he was he was clean he was whole don't tell me he didn't realize what he actually saw and don't you tell me when you look back at your old life that you're still that same person [Music] you've come into a reality you know that God is God amen hallelujah it's a difference now you're in a church you're not just in a in a church building you're in the body of Christ you're walking in the Supernatural anything that comes into your life has a purpose to come into your life now if God listen if God wants to keep you it doesn't matter what comes your way God's going to keep you amen it don't matter where it comes from the right from the left Hallelujah God is going to keep you glory to God Amen because God knows exactly the purpose and the plan that he has for each and every one of his children amen and so what happens when this attitude of gratitude takes a hold of us things start to change let me show you what happened here let's go to the next scripture let me let me show you here from the scripture rure from Acts chapter 16 we all know the story of Paul and Silas amen glory to God listen they just got beat up they just they just come through one heck of a time getting beat up for what because they believed the word in their day because they recognized Jesus Christ was the Messiah they knew that they had come into contact with the reality of God not some denomination not some teaching of man not some interpretation of the church oh you got to pray to this one you got to pray to that one you need Jesus you need to connect with him he's got to be your absolute there's no other mediator between you and him only him you want to go to the source amen glory to God when you know you've come to the source you can be grateful hallelujah oh you'll have a different kind of gratitude amen praise God but listen he said says here in in Acts 16 he says and at midnight it was a dark hour for Paul and Silas Paul and Silas prayed and sang Praises unto God and the prisoners heard them let me tell you you know you get into situations Dark Times dark seasons in your life oh let me tell you you know that praying is a life of Thanksgiving do you know that your prayer life is a life of gratitude amen what do you think Paul and Silas were doing when they were praising God just think about when you praise God think about when you give thanks for your brother or your sister I thank the Lord Jesus for you brother I thank God for the health that he's showing to you I thank God for the favor that he's show going to you you know what they were praying they were thanking God for their situation that they had actually been chosen of God to have to suffer for his reproach for his for for his desire for for mankind they they were praising God that they were chosen they didn't care about the circumstances but let me tell you something when you can get into that kind of attitude you're you're not going to only see Deliverance for yourself you're going to see Deliverance all around you people are going to be affected by your life and your attitude of gratitude amen people will know that there's something different about this person Hallelujah they just don't treat these kinds of uh you know terrible situations in the same way they're constantly praising God they're praising God for the for the for the dark moments at times Hallelujah so watch what and suddenly there was a great earthquake Hallelujah so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's bands were loosed everyone's Hallelujah not just them amen when you come into the house of the Lord and you've got revelation of who you are and and what God has done for you and you're in service and you're saying Amen brother praise God I believe it glory to God you know that there's somebody around you that when that earthquake comes when God comes down and he wants to meet your need do you know that those that are right there all of a sudden they're going to catch that anointing they're going to catch that Spirit of Revelation they're going to realize that hey wait a minute this brother he's just he he edifies me this sister when she speaks I feel good I feel strong I feel I feel the love of God coming off of their their their their their testimony and look they're in a and look at the situations that they're in I know there's people right here in this church that have been dealing with situations over the last year that have been very very difficult situations but yet they're steady they're solid they're believing God's word they're not bowing down they're they're they're trusting God they're getting behind the ministry they're supporting everything they're believing that God can still do it God is more than able to do it they realize that God has a time for everything they realize God has a time in a season if I can just stay solid and if I can just continue to praise God give him the glory then Victory is going to come and not only is it going to come for me but it's going to come for the church Hallelujah not only are they going to be affected not only am I going to be affected but they're going to be affected glory to God let me tell you go to the next slide Psalms 100: 4 to 5 says enter into his gates with what thaning what thanks amen and into his courts with what praise be thankful unto him and bless his name for the Lord is good his Mercy is Everlasting and his truth endureth to who all generations that same God who said that he's going to bless you he's going to prosper you he's going to heal you he's going to raise you out of that situation that same God is here today the same one that was with David is with you this morning because you are entering his Gates with Thanksgiving and you know what it does it brings his presence it brings his presence when we enter into the house of the Lord it brings his presence Hallelujah glory to God Amen thank you Jesus Hallelujah let me tell you God has given us this word of God so that we can understand what it means to be grateful and to live a life of Thanksgiving amen let's go to the next scripture listen to Thessalonians he says here Rejoice ever more pray without seizing in everything he didn't say something things everything that's why Paul and Silas they knew the the circumstances their bodies were broken they were bruised and bleeding but they knew the circumstance regardless they still knew knew that God was God they still knew that God was a deliverer they still knew that he was a Healer so no matter what they they saw in their bodies God could heal them it wasn't there's nothing too hard for the Lord whether he heals a cancer or whether he heals a natural cut on your arm you think there's any difference to God sometimes the the the the big you know sicknesses that come into our lives is because God's got a lot of faith in you God's got more faith in you than you know he'll Place certain things in your life because he knows you've got the faith in you that he wants to express for his glory he's not looking for you to get the glory we're not looking to get you know listen we're listen we're just a local church here good neighbor Ministries we are believers of the word of God for this hour amen we believe that God sent us a prophet in the 20th century to restore the world otherwise just like he said Luther Wesley Pentecost we would not have known the progression of the word unless he sent Reverend William brandham to restore us back to the original Faith that's why what you're hearing me what your I'm just reading what the word says amen he says in everything give thanks for this is what the will of God you mean it's the will of God for you to give thanks and be grateful for everything yes it is because it's Christ in you it's Christ it's you coming to a realization that that that he's in you expressing his word in this day Hallelujah and it's the will of God in Christ Jesus what concerning who you concerning each and every one of you he want you to know that Hallelujah glory to God Amen glor glory to God God's will for us in Christ is to be grateful in any and every circumstance gratitude humbles us you know you got to be humble to be grateful you know that some people are so hard in their character that they can't even go up to somebody and say thank you thank you for your gift giving your gift to the House of God to this body of Christ thank you for surrendering yourself in the cleaning committee thank you for be I'm saying it today and I've gone personally to people and told them that because I am truly grateful it takes more than just a a pastor and a few uh you know trustees and deacons to run a church it takes the whole body of Christ am glory to God listen you know I got a quote here I'm going to read it I didn't know if I was going to read it or not but I'm going to read it because it's a beautiful quote that you know my wife brought it to my attention she sent it to me this week and I thought wow that's beautiful and it says the way to have Fellowship it's it says here he says I'd rather have a church now listen just a moment he says here I would rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gifts and just be so in love with each other and with Christ I'd rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in the church now that might sound hard in a Pentecostal group but I would rather have it where there is gifts they'll fail oh let me tell you we've seen gifts come through this church ministers with gifts that come through this church and today those same ministers are denying this [Music] message oh yeah because gifts will fail Hallelujah where there is gifts they'll bring confusion oh I'm the prophet of this I'm the eighth messenger I'm the seven Thunder teacher I'm the no seals are not open teacher there's all kinds of confusion those kinds of gifts they don't do any good to the body but let me tell you what does good they listen where there is gifts they can be questioned but where there is love it is perfect that's right and if you had perfect love you'd have perfect gifts that's right so work first with love and that brings fellowship and the fellowship brings the gifts because who's the operator of the gifts it's always been Jesus Jesus Christ and when that gift is not operated with the character of Christ it's not love it doesn't edify it doesn't do anything it it can be actually used in a negative way Hallelujah but let the love of God fill that individual who's full of gratitude who believes God's word who knows that God is just working God's working on their testimony I look at my children I say Lord I know I know they deny you today but they're working on their testimony because I denied you for 33 years I denied the true Living God I was looking for you in so many places but then I realized that it wasn't for me to find that place it was for you to find me Hallelujah in in that point of time and season where you said okay now it's time they've had enough yes they've dealt with enough I've given them enough experience I've put certain things into their lives for a purpose so that they can have one heck of a testimony so that one day they're going to bring Glory not to themselves but to me the people will know that God is God that he can still deliver drug addicts he can still deliver cancer patients he can still deliver mental oppression oh God glory to God listen we're living in an age of mental health oppression like never before people are crying out they just need one word from Jesus they just need to hear I am your peace glory to God hallelujah let the Lord just give him one Revelation on I am your peace I am your healer I am your provider their life will never be the same amen glory to God hallelujah praise our God forever more let's let's go back to where we were here amen so here we are we're um what was our last slide Thessalonians amen praise God hallelujah Glory how many are enjoying the word this morning I'm enjoying his presence I'm enjoying his presence this morning I need I need this healing in my body amen I need this touch from the Lord I know that that I'm grateful I've never been this studying this this week just I said Lord It's so simple but then every day that I would go back to it it would just speak to my heart even more just how grateful what it is that God has given us to be grateful for amen and then you know I came across this scripture here as we wind down the musicians can start to come brother Bram speaking here in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ he says he this is what I I want you to focus on this we're grateful for this he says he the bridegroom took away your shame amen and put it in the sea of forgetfulness God took your life took all your guilt and all your shame that's why listen we're going to end this today and we're going to be able to really give God thanks and praise for for what we've really received in this hour you you really need to understand what God has done for you amen and what he can do for you if you've not come to this place yet he said I've put I've put your sin and shame away put it into the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word word and the blood of Life listen when you come into the house of the Lord when you hear services like this when you're receiving the word of God you're being washed you're being purged you're being set free the washing of the water of the word means that the word is now delivering you from the situations that you're bound up that's what the Bible said your first husband that you were married to the world Amen the anointed bridegroom which foreordained you has washed you you by the washing of the Water by the church no the congregation says we're not getting washed by the church it's not because you come to this church that you're going to get washed it's not because you belong to a certain Church you need the washing of the Water by the word the word Christ amen congregation says amen that don't sound right it says no you might find that in the almano but not in God's Bible by the washing of the Water by the word in the word see you are standing completely Justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is the kind of forgiveness of sin that people need to experience I remember when this reality struck my soul because I was living in a life of guilt I was ashamed of my life and I know a lot of you have been ashamed of your life and the way that you've lived and the attitudes that you've had even while you're serving the lord you can look back and you can feel that shame but I got something to remind you of this morning you just need to be grateful you just need to change your attitude to one of gratitude instead of an attitude of oh me all things have been going wrong for me things didn't work out the way that I wanted them you need to get to a place where you just want his will his desire his plan because guess what you're not going to be here very long amen the things that you're dealing with right now that you think is oh poor me and poor this and oh I don't have this and I don't have that it's all going to fade away in one moment things are going to change and war is going to strike and it's going to be right in our own backyards because the world is going into Great Tribulation you need to get your priorities right you need to to get the right attitude of gratitude here and be focused on what God has done for you you don't have to go on as you are you don't have to feel depressed anymore you don't have to allow anxiety to take a hold of you anymore you don't have to allow those things you can be free because he whom the front the son of man sets free is free [Music] indeed hallelujah amen you are standing completely Justified this is my message to the church now as you go off the air just in a minute you are standing if you're standing on God's word and with God's word every amen every jot every TT where you're standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from them Shucks am amen he says he says uh pull away he says and get out here in the wheat remember God is this is Harvest Time God is harvesting his church many uh you know there's there just not enough workers out there but the Harvest is plentiful Hallelujah God needs you to live and be grateful so that we can be that that that that expression that when somebody comes into your atmosphere they can they can come into what you've got amen praise God he says you're standing completely he says amen and get get out here in the wheat where you can get ripe before the sun I hear the coming of the combine amen glory to God you're standing complete Justified like you never did it in the first place Hallelujah talk about a Thanksgiving he says I feel real good I'm more thankful for that than anything I know of Praise the Lord did you hear that more thankful for that knowing that God has Justified me as though I never done any of it I've come into a true understanding of who I am that I am free I am free I am free I am not bound by the chains of circumstance anymore amen you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned at the first place you are perfect you're standing completely you never sinned at the first place God don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness amen oh I'm so grateful this morning Hallelujah you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son or a daughter of God hallelujah glory to God Amen he says and your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead that old life is put away it's dead it's in the sea of God's for fness only you bring it up every now and then and all that does is it brings discouragement to you and to those around you let me give you some advice leave the past in the past Hallelujah glory to God absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God you're The
