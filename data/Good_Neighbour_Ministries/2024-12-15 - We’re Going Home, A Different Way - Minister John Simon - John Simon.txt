being baptized today you know she came to me a couple of weeks ago and she says brother I was baptized when I was you know young I was a teenager at the time I I really didn't know what was you know really truly what was taking place and until you come to a place where something changes really on the inside then baptism becomes meaningful then it shows that something on the inside has been identified with the word of God Amen and identifies with what God is doing today amen glory to God that God has spoken to you today and has brought you into the today Ministry of the body of Jesus Christ Everything Changes all of a sudden like Phillip you know when he was walking there with the unic and they were walking along and Jesus had been on the scene and Philip was talking to him and you know he had heard these things but then all of a sudden Revelation struck his heart it struck his heart and he was talking about the scriptures Philip was expounding on the scriptures and immediately the unic said where's water where's water I need to get to the water because there's something on the inside of me that needs to be expressed to identify myself with Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen praise God do we have our brother God bless you brother come ahead sister Ken is identifying herself and making it known Lord is my savior amen [Music] [Music] [Music] Lord are you happy today the whole Heaven rejoicing so I believe you are rejoicing with the angels of the Lord cuz what the child of the child of God is coming home hallelujah we're going to read the book of Acts chapter chapter 2 verse 38 from 36 to 38 therefore let all the house of Israel know assur that God has made the same Jesus whom he have crucified both Lord and Christ now when they heard this they were pre in their heart and said unto Peter and to all the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah you cannot escape this Hallelujah for the for the promise is unto you and to the children and to all that are a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and with many others words me any other words did he testify and exal saying save yourself from unto un unto generation then that then that day gladly received his word were baptized and the same day they were added unto them about 3,000 Souls hallelujah hallelujah we are blessed so our sister recognized that he she was baptized when she was young but now God has opened her understanding that he need the Holy Ghost cuz he cannot work this where this journey alone he need God the spirit of God to guide her so she want to re baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ again am without further Ado I can read more about 19 verse one going on and said uh when they were they hav received the Holy Ghost and the Bible said they re baptized again and then the Holy Ghost Came Upon them and then the word of God start manifest in their life so this is a a genu and a real Christian baptism Hallelujah sister I'm going I'm

of you here the Lord bless you real good thanks be to the Lord amen uh we come with a me with a message today um from the Lord and I want to thank the Lord for it amen um you know of course every Minister will uh receive a thought from God and then he'll go to the word the Bible the quotes whatever to support the thought or Revelation that God gives to him however in doing so I couldn't find anything on this matter anywhere so I said this is very strange because it's very very very simple too right nothing or or shaking but is to bring attention to himself to his word and for his people it's between him and his people amen because the whole story of redemption is a love story the love of God for his people uh a love of God for his wife and he unveils it as we know um just like an onion just take the peel one after the other and it comes right down He makes himself known to his people so I'm trusting today that as we come together um with our brothers uh permission I'll bring forth the word and I pray that you will talk to me talk to the Lord respond to the Lord amen amen remember a a a church a service a worship service it's not the school schol room uh where we just sit down lined up and the pastor gets up here and speaks and and everybody stays quiet unless they asked the question and there is no uh wooden ruler that I have back hair to knock hit you on the knuckles or anything like that but uh respond just be normal be natural be who you are right if you don't uh if you like something I said said praise God Amen as I usually say I don't need Queen Elizabeth's approval for what I'm saying I don't need you to praise the Lord no no no no no be yourself praise God hallelujah praise God the Lord bless you real good I'm preaching my I haven't even started father we pray in the name of Jesus God as we come together that the great holy spirit will speak to us just a while father just myself brother Dan any other the brothers brother Tim brother Desmond any one of us stands here father we just stand there as men but Lord God it's just when the angel troubles the waters when the Holy Spirit Spirit comes when the angel of God draws near and he walks upon the word the waters may may that word come to life father giving us strength for the struggle giving us oh God that spirit for the battle that you might take glory and honor and praise today as we commit every little one every person uh from the oldest to the youngest into your great loving arms in jesus' name amen and amen the Lord bless you real good we're just going to read U um one text here out of Matthew Chapter 2 actually you can read uh 1 to uh I believe it's uh 15 sorry not 15 12 one to 12 but we don't need to read all of that here today I'm just going to read this one scripture and speaking of the wise men and being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod they departed into their own country another way that's what caught my attention there returned in another way amen praise the Lord God bless you uh please be seated now I'm just going to I'll tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to be preaching about the wise men but in reality I'm I'm really going to be preaching about you am and um uh I want you to know that I'm talking about the wise men but this applies to you and I um I will Begin by making Swift commentary on uh the scriptures concerning the wise men uh passing over it and then I'm going to go to what the Lord has placed upon my heart is that all right amen praise the Lord now is written Matthew 2:1 if you want to open your Bibles or if the scriptures up there you can follow it there quite easily right it tells you very much that when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem of course we know those wise men uh they tell us they come from India Persia Hindustan uh they came from the East and that means they come from the East going west praise the Lord hallelujah and there they were and um I want you to know that when they came from the East they went to what was considered the seat of religion in those days which was Jerusalem amen and they went there and um they asked where is he born King of the Jews now we know that these men obviously knew about balam's prophecy that out of the root of Jesse will rise a star and uh when the star appeared it means that the Messiah was on earth now uh the sign of the star in the sky would signify that the Messiah was born and he was here and so therefore when they saw the star they recognize the significance of the appearance of that star we recognize the significance of the appearance of Malachi 4:5 we recognize the star of the seven Church Age and what it meant to the age of his is coming at this particular time in history to come upon the scene so we thank the Lord God that they saw the star now we understand that they all three of them didn't all of a sudden get a group group uh Revelation because of where they were each got an individual revelation and they each one saw the same star amen now we understand sorry I have to uh say this it's the same star but they saw it from three different points let me put it that way okay they saw it from three different parts different parts they were countries and they saw it in three different parts but you know that three becomes one right praise the name of the Lord here they were they got it individually now these wise men didn't know each other they had no connection with each other but they received the same Revelation and under inspiration of that Revelation think of it they left their homes their families everything else and you can read several of brother Brandon's messages uh uh and sermons hear them how he spoke they left their families and they packed up uh uh the camels and left individually where they were from going out and brother brand says one of them's wives asked him where are you going with all this stuff he said well I don't know how far it is I don't know how long it will take I don't know what I'm going to meet I'm going to walk with everything that I need because I don't know what I'm going to come across oh but thank God brother BR said totally different to us when we leave here we're not packing up we're unpacking every sin that is Li besets us every bad habit we're unpacking we're throwing off every weight that tries to come upon us we want to cast it away because we are leaving here to go in the presence of God Amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen now where is he born King of the of the of the Jews and the wise men the theologians they didn't know they had no answer now remember these men were learned in the scriptures right they were learned in the scriptures but only when the wise men asked the question and then Herod says you'd better find an answer for me fast you you're making me look bad and they went search the scriptures and came back and says it's written in the scriptures in Bethlehem of Judea it's written by the prophet Hallelujah now these men had the scriptures it's not that he didn't have the same scriptures that the wise men had but the wise men saw the scripture had the revelation of the significance and the interpretation of the scripture Hallelujah but these men that were so trained and so learned saw the same scripture but they had nothing in them amen that can enable and Empower them to interpret the scripture and there they were blinded to the truth of the word of God hallelujah now he sent the wise men and said go and search diligently to find this uh child and when you found him find him then come and come and tell me so that I can worship him also we know that was a lie he just wanted to find where the child was to kill it which he did later on with all the others he couldn't find the one so he killed all right hoping that when he kills all he stamp out this message stamp out all of these people talk running around talking about a a star a message and all of this type of thing like that amen Hallelujah now they they stayed with Herod and the Bible said they departed and when they Departed the star appeared before them now brother Bram said do you know when they went to Herod the star left them that's right he says when you go to a denomination right there you're blinded and the light leads you right away but when you see the Bible says they departed from Herod they left the denomination they left that church they left that Society they were in they left that Lodge and they walk away from it they walk to the perfect light they walk away from all that was sin the star appeared the star appeared the light appeared again Hallelujah and when the light appeared and when there that religious institution the light of God LED them right to the perfect word I thank God for brother Brandon I said thank God for brother Brandon thank God for the Star Messenger that led us to the perfect word that same star LED them to that newborn child Hallelujah and there they met him praise God God after much trial and trouble look brother sister I don't know about you but I can tell you about myself it wasn't easy for me to come to the fullness of this message it wasn't easy for any of us to leave where we were in and walk away from it and follow this message under persecution under natural financial problem under emotional stresses under trials tribulations like nobody has ever seen oh think of these wise men leaving their homes they're coming with gold they're coming with frankincense they're coming with more these were all very expensive things any robber knows that you've got that kind of a gift on you it he will harass you give you all kinds of mental problems you wanted to know where it come from give you all kinds of physical sickness you want to where it come from you want all kinds of troubles your car wrecks breakdowns your life threatened every aspect of your life under danger why because God put a seed of life in you he put a attributing you and you're lead led by the word of God and while that word is leading you you're under threat behold their threatenings Paul said behold all their threatenings their blood thirsty that that's upon them oh God and stand with your people in this hour Hallelujah yes there it was they come across Hells and mountains and Moors and deserts under threat of robbers and everything else of course Satan is the biggest robber we know that right and the and the star LED them to this perfect child not in a Manger like they show us but in our house brother BM said they traveled for over two years to get where they were going and uh uh under inspiration he says now when when when when I was just uh coming to to know what God called me to do how that this woman that was an astrologer how many of you remember that story met him and said you young man he said there's a bunch of them were standing there talking young man you he says me he says yes you she says do you know that you're born under a star Oh my he says oh no no no I don't believe in that sort of stuff and she began to explain to him that you know just like how when the wise men you know uh followed the star each one following later on we understand it's Jupiter Saturn and Mars that those three stars right but as they approach Jerusalem the constellation cross and all three become one bright shining star and the prophet says here later on he's commenting on it he says while the stars were moving in the heavens and coming into conjunction on Earth these true three men who didn't know each other the spirit of God was moving them until their lives come into conjunction why do you think you're here today you think your here by chance you're not by chance you're here by the power of God by the spirit of almighty God let your here brought you into the house of God and we are now in a constellation of the revelation of the word of God hallelujah praise God praise God God moves in Simplicity it looks so ordinary oh I just felt like going to that church called Good Neighbor Ministries oh you you think it was like that no God lets you feel no he doesn't want you to be uptight feeling you under inspiration and you got to move like you you know like some people want to prove they're a Christian you got to have a Bible big like that for everybody no that's not the Bible on your chest it's the seed and the attribute of God in your heart that makes you who you are by the grace of almighty God hallelujah amen yes sir and you know when they came we understand that they gave him gifts and that's what everyone has to do is give him gifts give him whatever gift is in your life you may be not don't know that you have any gift for gifts and callings are without repentance brother Brandon said before you even repent or even talk to God that thing is in you it's there and maybe you even used to think why am I so strange why I feel so different you know as a as a child I used to wonder how do I know this I I don't know how I know but I know and I'm certain that I know Hallelujah and it's happening over and over again so what is it some other gift or thing was in you all the time from the day you're born and you didn't not know why you're made like that whether it's by dreams whether it's by significant other things that are around God placed something in you maybe you didn't even recognize it yet but I trust that you will recognize it today tonight tomorrow that you will recognize God put something in you and he wants to use it amen wants to use it for his glory and for his honor hallelujah amen offer your gifts to him gold frankincense M we know that speaks of his frankincense priesthood you know and the gold speaks of his deity and royalty and the mer speaks of his coming death right there you can see that those men didn't just read the scriptures they had a revelation they had a revelation of the scripture and that's why then knew what hallah that what were the gifts to bring they knew what gifts to bring because God had revealed it to them by the word now you got to remember when Abel Abel offered his Sacrifice by faith Abel oh so so so how could he get fith the Bible wasn't written yet how could he get Faith yes you see a lot of people think that faith comes just by uh reading the Bible it's good to read the Bible but real Faith perfect Faith the brother Bram said is a revelation and a revelation is by Grace a revelation you can't study it up you can't bring it down you can't beat a drum and bring it up or something it comes by grace and he only reveals to whom he Wills amen it's right in the Bible you'll find I'll give you the scripture later on where he said none knows the father none knows the son none knows the son except whom the father would reveal him and Noone knows the father except to him to whom the son will reveal him amen see so that's the way it is it's by Revelation and Revelation is not by reading the written word but the Holy Spirit revealing to you the unwritten word it's coming in contact with the Lo ghost you can't see the Lo ghost with your eyes unless he will permit you but uh by Revelation he brings you into contact with himself none can draw near to him unless he permits it none can come close to him unless he allows it amen praise God yes sir so they come with their gifts Lord and uh brought it to him the Bible said they worshiped and we know after that they prayed amen you know why they prayed now they have to go back to Herod and the Bible said they prayed I'm not going going to explain how they prayed what desperation in which they prayed and if they really prayed or they give a casual prayer Lord we have to go back there no they knew their life was in danger they knew everything was hanging online right so they prayed and L asked God what they should do let me tell you I don't care what corner you're in what problem you've got what situation you find in if you pray God Will Make A Way that God Will Make A Way hallelujah praise God forever more and when they prayed the Bible said they received a dream a revelation in other words the Revelation can come in form of a dream can come in form of an inspired thought it can come in the form of uh something out of the written word revealing Unwritten from written many ways praise the Lord but here we find that they were warned of God Amen in a dream don't go back to that denomination you came out of don't even go back to it get away from that thing and stay with the word of the Living God stay with the revelation of this hour oh praise God forever more Hallelujah and the Bible says and they departed into their un own country another way I want to tell you we're in a different country right now we're in a totally different country amen that we are from right now where we are at and we got to go back a different way amen right that's how we got to go back praise the Lord now we're getting closer and closer to my subject here praise God now we find out speaking the wise men brother Brandon speaking of the wise men not back he said the wise men of today do you believe that there's wise men today you believe he says Wise Women wise men and women of today do you believe you're one of them I said Do you believe you're one of them oh praise God look I'm not here to speak to sadak I'm here to speak to people that have been quickened by the word Made Alive by the spirit of the living godj Hallelujah oh praise God now God's gifts always find their places amen they know where to go God the spirit is leading them like it led the wise men they already had a gift of God in them and the gift caused them to see and they alone saw the star you can go read those things I don't need to go for that all them cities all nobody else saw the star but they recognize the significance of that star are and they had confidence in what they were seeing they followed it followed it because it could lead them nowhere else but to the Christ amen hallelujah oh yes so now notice he's speaking here when God's gifts find their places now Christ in this day that we are now living in is still identifying himself he is still deity he is still the word amen yes sir hallelujah oh praise God and God guided them Magi with them gifts he guided them with the gifts that they had with them praise God and the gift that is in you will guide you God will use that to open your eyes open your standing lead you at the right place at the right time of your life to hear the voice of God to hear the promise of this day for this time to receive him and recognize him praise the name of the Lord yes sir oh see them stars back there had to cross their orbits oh my it showed that there was something different and in the pth they were coming to on Earth they cross at Jer at Bethlehem at the same time he's talking about the Stars Crossing in the heavens and the men coming together at the same time by the grace of God hallelujah oh my and God guided them Magi because they had the right gifts hallelujah what was it the right gift was the gift to recognize the Christ child yes to recognize the newborn word oh praise God hallelujah they were to recognize the word and by the gifting them they were able to identify the word that is the true word amen because you know we living in a day of chaos we live in a day of Confusion And The Devil is a master of confusion he's a master of disaster and confusion amen and we know that once this message came out under a prophet you got people start to imitate the first B then you have another wave come out then it take the second pole all of a sudden everybody got discernment all of a sudden everybody can say oh uh your name is uh uh is Elizabeth your name is Elizabeth I think it says something like Liz Liz and the lady says oh Elizabeth yes that's what I was about to say see uh no no but not not like this G like the genuine see but they were imitators imitators the third P come along oh my spoken words is your Original Seed amen yes sir but do you know we got imitators too you know the devil come right in the message let me tell you right in your Bible all I have to do is quote the scriptures and you your mind could take you into those places Satan was where right in heaven showing what Discord confusion he had his own Angels right where the thron of God was the devil was right there spreading disinformation lies right there right in this message we've got a lot of disinformation amen we got a lot of people that are firefighters in the message instead of spreading the fire they want to put out the fire right is that right they tell we don't need that fire we don't need you to get emotional when you come in the house of God uh we don't we don't need to cry we don't need to shout we don't we don't need to sing and and and clap your hands that's not good church Behavior that's not good manners no we ain't coming here to learn uh manners from Miss mannerly or whatever her name is we are here to take God's [Applause] word if I got a dance to take it I'll dance if I got a shout to take it I'll shout if I got a roll on the floor to take it I'll roll on the floor if I got to speak in tongues to take it I'll speak in tongues whatever I got to do I want I want this kind of blessing amen a gift in you to recognize the Living Word The Living Word not the dead pages of the Bible but the Living Word the word made flesh again oh praise God hallelujah thank God for the right gifts amen oh my they went out think of it they were just humble men this is in God's WRA gift to find God's star they were going to follow God's Star Messenger and they'll follow that Star Messenger till they come to the perfect light am they follow the Star Messenger until they come to the perfect light listen to Prophet Revelation 1:20 remember them stars stars to them churches all m what we ought to do today is find the Starlight amen that's reflecting his glory not their own but you know another script another quotation brother brand said do you know the Stars only come out after the sun has gone down so that they can reflect the light of the sun back into the church age is that right praise God and so now what do we see here we see they followed the star and it guided them to the perfect light hallelujah amen yes sir and they said we come to worship him there were shouting screaming in the streets carrying on like Mad Men in the streets amen praise God you mean to tell me you left this perfect orderly church this beautiful cathedral that CA so many millions to build such marble such beauty this singing like Angels the colors around you like heaven come down upon the Earth the Priestly robes the ministerials if we come to the prend side oh well dressed in th suits worth thousands of dollars this is not worth thousands of dollars by the way and I'm not just saying that to put myself down this is just a regular suit but just so you know that God is not in the that whatsoever he was more interested in people like Shepherds that smell like sheep he was more interested in men screaming in the street shouting and praising God Amen Hallelujah you you realize there only a bunch of people recognize his first coming you realize that a bunch of shepherds a man that thought was a crackpot named Simeon is that right and here was a blind woman too claiming that she saw the Christ and she blind so just let let let me leave that but Brothers sister is just a small group of weird people there were odd balls brother Desmond they were OD balls brother J they couldn't figure out what is going on oh my yes sir all they know they seen the star they recognize the star and the gifting them could identify that what he was speaking was the word for the God for the Hallelujah nothing struck their soul like it they recognized that it was the word of God hallelujah we have seen a star yeah but we come to worship him we come to worship Him didn't come to worship the star I said we did not come here to worship the star we come to worship Him amen oh yes we come to worship Him the manifested word praise the Lord hallelujah the word unveiled before us amen we come to worship that word of the Living God hallelujah and that's why we are here today praise the Lord glory to God let me get past this these things here um laying a kind of a foundation for us as we go on Amen we have seen his star now you understand in the west have you have you seen his star now in the west Oh I thought the Bible says in the East I'm going to stay with the Bible got the Bible I says they come from the East forgive me it's just my way of seeing things right but now now you're telling me a star in the west amen you know oh what kind of a star yeah man praise God what is it he said it was a a church star sent to the churches what was it the Holy Spirit himself amen praise God oh my the Holy Spirit now moving in human beings what is it wise men and Wise Women of today that are humbl in heart amen we have seen his star and we have come to worship him him and that's why we here today I love him you may be ashamed of him but you can't even tell him that you love him but I want him to know I love him I love him with all my heart I don't care if every one of you turn back I'm pressing on I'm not saying you will but that's my way of expressing my determination amen doesn't matter he says whether kings and princes fall on your right hand and on your left hand he said put your faith in the Lord Jehovah amen praise God hallelujah amen now listen God God led the wise men to Christ by the star and that same God is here tonight in the form of the Holy Ghost amen what the Holy Ghost to give you give you Revelation to give you light do you know there's a man in here that can turn on the light all of a sudden a bulb in your head not saying your Jug Head or anything but all of a sudden a light goes off and you recognize you might have been here and all sitting down and hearing me hearing all these brothers going all the time like that but when your time comes and your time is ready God will turn on the light hallelujah oh my and lead you to the to Christ the New Birth the baptism the Holy Ghost which is God's provided way amen men and women have received it and I want to ask today have you been baptized into the body have you been baptized by the Holy Ghost amen now the brothers will preach on that in the future what is the real true baptism of the Holy Ghost if it's not speaking in tongues what is it so so these things will come forth by the holy SP spirit amen hallelujah oh praise God at this point he says here where is he born King the Jews oh God he is so good can you say that God is so good say it again God is so good say it one more time let me hear you God is so good all the time he is so good that he will catch the attention of every person every elect that is orain to life he will catch their attention regardless of who they are maybe in their own way of worship they worshiping but he will catch their attention he is God and he knows the hearts of men and he watches them he protects them and then brings them to a certain place amen while you were a sinner you don't know how God was protecting you amen watching over you until he brings you to a place where he opens your understanding to the revelation of the word of God brought you all this way through all this years he says he's bring you to that place when the Deep begins to call back to the Deep deep there's got to be something to respond to that call something has to be there to quench that thirst amen oh if he's caught your attention it's only one gift that you can give him and that is to give yourself do you believe that what more can we give him that he doesn't already own you can't get you we think we give him time and offerings the Bible says a cattle and a thousand hills belong to him right all the gold silver and everything in the ground is all his now what can we give him that he doesn't already own our gifts are gratitude our gifts are expressions of Love Back to God but we cannot outgive him in any possible way you see give yourself to God because God already gave you his gift right now the only thing you owe back to him is yourself to him wake up shake yourself look out there where we're at look those Wise Men We wise men of to we are in line with the word hallelujah just like they were in line with that star we're in line with the word of God the light of God is shining on your pathway glory to God in the highest he says glory to God in the highest who gave us our Lord Jesus Christ who we love and has brought us to this place we are his people bought with the price of his Precious Blood praise God now if you still have some stamina now we can start to really look into the word amen is that okay but before we look into the word let's sing a little song or chorus going home we're going home do we have that then you can put it up want everybody to going home we're going home we've got not long to stay for I've caught a glimpse of that Heavenly land thank God praise God we're going do you remember it now let's sing it go we are going home we've not got long to stay but long to stay for I've for I've caught a glimpse of that Heavenly land praise God where go in home amen now this wise men back there were going home by another way or I as I got into the office there I saw the Amplified Bible and I opened it and it says by another root right um and it made me look at something else there and it says they're going back by a different route a different way well you know you just avoided robbers and you going to go back the same way you don't think they'll be waiting you right well God knows that so he sent them back by a different by a different way amen praise God now they're going back home now you must recognize where we came from we didn't come from Earth if we if we are reected seed we come from above we are not of Earth we are of heaven we come from his presence the song says what this world is not my home I'm just a passing through my treasures somewhere beyond the blue the Angels yes sir the seventh angel can't feel at home in this world anymore yes so we come from the mind of God we were the original thoughts of God right and God's uh original intention was that we would come down here to be his spoken words Sons and Daughters just like Adam should have spoken the word to Eve telling her he wants a son he wants a daughter and that's the way it would have been but Satan perverted the whole thing and turned the plan upside down are you following me okay he turned it upside down so now here we end up coming to the Earth and before we could become what God wanted us to be amen we because when we left God we left in God's spirit image for he said let us make man in his own image right well no that's another topic you talk about that who's just us now we understand now that we are under Revelation that it's all his seed was in him and they were having a fellowship and they were talking and he was letting them know they're going to come to Earth here right and for them to come to Earth they going to have to become man and he's going to have to create flesh bodies and put them in but those bodies would be by his spoken word and not the All Flesh is is not the same flesh go and Paul will tell you about that right uh because we find out there that Jesus had flesh he said Spirit not Flesh and Bones but yet he could walk through walls and everything else and appear and disappear right that was the kind of Flesh that was We were supposed to be in but Satan now he wants to be uh trying to achieve creation uh you know uh without God uh chose the woman to use the woman as an instrument so we end up being trapped in a physical human body and as we say doing time and we've been doing time here in this prison of Earth inside of this body right and here we are and now we end up in a foreign land do you know this Earth is a foreign land Paul says we are aliens he says we are we we we are citizens of of heaven we not we not really from here praise God physically you are here but I'm talking about your soul inside you are not of this Earth praise God hallelujah we are the reality you know uh we are the ones with the eternal life right and we extraordinary people praise the Lord God hallelujah now you find yourself in a foreign land and you ask like I just went to South America and I wanted to be sure that whoever is going to guide me I know the person or the person knows somebody that I know and they're trusted and they have confidence I am not going to be led by somebody else into some dark spot robbed and choked and I I know you don't know anything about this that's why I have to talk about it right but here we as humans find ourselves in a foreign land instead of finding somebody we know we go and ask Mr Satan uh how we can get back home how are we going to return back where we come from right my goodness and of course being a good person as he think he is he gives you the best advice he knows amen first of all you need to join a good religion doesn't matter which one you can be Buddhist you can be Muhammad you can be Hindustan you can zoraster bahola swedenberg Mormon you whatever you want but you must be a religious person this is the kind of advice he gives to people yes lying because he wants to distract them from God's way because he presented himself that he's a Creator and we came to this Earth by way of the woman by the way of the woman praise God think of it so he says uh join a certain certain church and that church is the gate to Glory maybe you'll get back to Heaven that way and especially if you have uh the leader of that church say certain prayers over you sprinkle certain Waters or baptize you anoint you with certain oils you know um you know depending on what kind of oil it is you know I'm shocked I went into a store and they had uh bring back your husband oil there was another oil for wealth there was one another one to hold off evil to drive away this drive away that oils they have believe in that so he will go and tell you you know like that just go join a church become a good person especially now that you're getting old you know join a church when you're young dance enjoy yourself uh live while you're young you know time doesn't matter because you got a lot of time when you get old you can repent and go to church then but when you're young it's time to you know smooth moon walk and everything else those are oldfashioned dancing anyway but he'll tell you join a church but let me tell you joining a church was not going to take you in the presence of God we tell you become a member of a certain Society join a certain Lodge that has secret teaching right that will really show you how to receive Enlightenment right from the great eye of God and and to you become a man that's square and on the level uh like that so uh he'll teach you tell you all those kinds of Lies that's right not that those things are bad in the sense they they can make you a good natural person he can help you sometimes in certain situations amen but we are not called to do that we are led by the Holy Spirit through a prophet through the seventh star that has brought us this far amen and when the star brought them to the Christ child the star disappeared no more do you read them following the star there were now following a revelation that was given to them by God Matthew 2:12 being warned of God in a Dream by a revelation they went to their own own country in a different way they followed the Revelation that took them to their own country in a different way woman gives birth the water breaks the life comes forth Jesus uh John 3 Nicodemus was in a puzzle he was wondering what is Jesus talking about Jesus is trying to let him know you got to get back home in a different way right no man can come down go up to heaven except he first come down from heaven he had to be in the mind of God and then come down here trapped in a body but then to go back he came can't go back unless he was forc up there is that right you have to had to be an elected seed of God that was in God you come down you're trapped that's why we get all these things we we go into all kinds of stuff just like the people in the world did everything they did in the world we in here did it too sure it's not me just saying that Paul said he said Paul is trying to tell his own congregation he said you're sitting in front of me he he says we are all the saints of God but some of you were whoremongers abusing yourselves with mankind he says liars and he goes down a whole long list you're handing witchcraft you're handing this you're handing that he says such were some of you but he brought you out from the Mir clay put your feet on the Rock to stay praise God hallelujah we to him we give all glory and praise and honor hallelujah amen yes sir amen yes sir so God he's speaking to Nicodemus and Nicodemus didn't understand he said for me to get back home you mean I got to go back in my mother's womb to be born again Jesus said no you don't need to do that except a man be borned again he shall in no wise enter the kingdom of God then listen what he said he got he repeated it he says except you be born by water and by the spirit a woman gets birth the water breaks the life comes forth he says now you're going back but by the water and the spirit you see that's what Satan was trying to imitate and to copy he wanted to create like God could create and he chose the same kinds of methods but he chose it naturally but God is speaking spiritually here to us amen thank you Lord by the word of the water the word has got to break on you and when the water breaks catches your attention you see something in that Bible that you've been reading all them years all of a sudden it lights up you start to see lights upon the pages of the Bible the Bible becomes a new Bible to you there's not enough Mone markers in the world for you to mark all the passages that you think are significance after a while you almost have to give up because every word you read is a part of God himself oh bless God forever more the word breaks and then that Spirit of New Life comes Hallelujah yes sir I tell you friends man has asked as I said before the wrong person Satan and all the directions he's given you in your past they all failed but thank God there were still some men in the world they didn't bother to go and ask him amen they stayed away from him and they walk with God Enoch didn't ask the devil how you going to get back home but he walked with the word and the word showed him how to get home companionship with the word took him right back to his home Jacob didn't have to go and ask the devil but he lay there and as he lay there in a dream God showed them this is how you get back home he saw the ladder he saw the church ages he saw saints of God going up and down from top to bottom up and down carrying inspiration Divine communication under the power of the holy spirit amen yes sir oh my what about Elijah you think Elijah went and asked Ahab how can I get back to God how can I get back to Jehovah no no no the Bible said a fire Chariot came picked him up and took him back in the presence of the Living God what about Jesus the Bible says and while he yet spake unto them he started to ascend he started going up you know the prophet said could be any time while we come to worship like this one moment you're here and the next moment you're not Amen in the tling of an eye you're in the presence of of God praise the Lord what did he say to the thief on the cross uh after after go back to Rabbi uh um you know what's the rabbi ananas and let him U pay him some money to pray you out of purgatory first and then no no no no no and then maybe next week you'll be in my presence well I'm going to no he says today you'll be with me in Paradise today without money without price only with faith in God trust in the Ser savior faith in the Lord Revelation through the Holy Spirit bring you back in connection with him they found their way back amen yes sir but they were not returning the way they came let me say it another way we came here by human birth canal but we are not going back by human birth canal as we just read in John 3 Jesus said no you're not going back that way amen you come down from heaven you got to go back to Heaven you got to do so not by natural but you're going back by the water of the word has to break on you and the spirit then will come giving you life and you Born Again by the Holy Spirit except a man receive the water and of the spirit he shall in no wise enter into the Kingdom of Heaven glory to God you must be born again by God's provided way of the revealed word of God hallelujah yes sir praise the Lord so we have taken the word of God to be our guide to guide us and now now we are on our way home how many believe that we're on our way going home we're going home we've not got long to stay we've caught a glimpse of that Heavenly land because God sent a prophet to catch to reflect the light of the Sun and then reflect it back into the church age that we might see his deity we might see his glory and we might see his power expressed through a prophetic Ministry brother Brandon was a signpost he was there to point us we don't go and kneel down under the sign and say oh holy sign oh holy signpost no it's not the signpost go where the signpost is pointing praise the Lord so we're going where the SOS is telling us to go praise the Lord hallelujah amen yes sir I tell you friends we going back by Revelation amen we were allowed by God to see and because we saw we surrendered those men saw the star and they surrendered to the leadership of that star prophets said of course the star today is the Holy Ghost we surrendered to the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord see a lot of people get into fear because uh they say oh what you're saying there I didn't read it say like that in the Bible Well the Bible won't say like that because that part of the word is unseen it's an unfailing reality amen it's there in the word but it's not it's not the written word but it's there in the word he tried to explain it by saying my wife writes me a letter and when I read the letter I'm seeing more than what's written down on that letter I can see everything else that's there back of that and this is what the true bride sees when she looks at the word she just don't see the writing on the page she she sees beyond that because it's revealing it's making itself known it's exposing it's unveiling it's manifesting out of the word of God hallelujah oh my God I'm beside my myself sometimes amen praise God hallelujah thank God Amen that these Wise Men followed the Christmas star amen are you following the Christmas star I don't only mean at Christmas time because this star Christ means uh Christ Mass means worship of Christ so when I say Christmas star it's leading them to the worship of Christ Hallelujah yes sir and you know that the Christmas Stars I said before is a combination of them three stars that come together in one and so when God sent this seven Church AG messenger what have to had to happen you had to have Luther Wesley and Pentecost is a part of this message they come together in the fullness to bring what the fullness of the word it brought back the fullness of the word but you have to have those three combined together in one Ministry hallelujah oh my God hallelujah oh my I tell you I'm one of them you can call me all the crazy you want but I'm one of them you want to call me a Lutheran I'm one of the best lutherans amen you want to call me a Wesleyan and a Methodist I am one of the original methodists amen you want to call me Pentecost I am original Pentecost you see they can't distinguish between the real and and the false the true and the false they don't know when it's real Hallelujah the devil spread so much confusion that only those who have the eyes to see will recognize the difference hallelujah praise God I know by now you're saying brother Simon calm down be very uh you know discreet and you know in the way you're speaking so we can understand don't just get on like that you know but I I I just can't help myself I wish I could jump higher uh in the air praise God and click my heels like that man brother Bram saw drop down on the ground and go back up the other side of the rainbow come back down the other side preach a little more glory to God hallelujah oh my praise God hallelujah yes sir you you can read what I just said in uh the the restation of the Bright Tree amen and he he brings it right back and he says it comes right back to being what the Holy Ghost himself right brings you right back to he himself praise God hallelujah yes sir oh praise God they recognize the star was a fulfillment of scripture they recognize it was a fulfillment of of the star out of Jesse and we recognize this seventh Angels messenger messenger what Lo the Fulfillment just like them people on the mountain when they see Jesus riding in on on a donkey they realize they were watching a prophecy being fulfilled and when we see brother bram's life and Ministry the projection of love and the grace of God we recognize that's Malachi 4 being fulfilled there is Luke 17:30 being fulfilled there is revelation 1:20 being fulfilled there is revelation 10:7 making itself known we recognize it that's why we are excited that's why we are happy and that's why my soul rejoices in the Lord forever more and because we recognize the star it give us confidence to follow that star amen you going to just follow any Star it can lead you anywhere but confidence in that star by revelation amen and you will follow that star with all the confidence Hallelujah and where did the star lead them it led them straight to a new birth it led them straight to that house amen praise God now may not lead you to a house and a baby in a Manger but lead you to a a man like brother coffee looks like nothing but uh the Christ child is laying in there that seed of life is in there God is in that life that's where it's that now you know God is on his throne where you think sitting in the heavens no God is sitting in the throne in your heart amen is right he's sitting in the Thrones of our hearts he's enthroned in his people praise the Lord hallelujah and that's why every day we crown him Lord of all we cast all our ambition at his feet take off your crown all your achievements all your degrees throw them at his feet surrender all to him take it Lord take it Lord I am just one of your children I'm one of your sons one of your daughters I'm walking in the light of the day amen praise God forever more you can just pull my coils when you want me to stop brother Danny Hallelujah yes sir Hallelujah the star they followed LED them to a baby in the manger the star We are following led us to the Mighty God in Christ amen hallelujah yes sir in the form of the revealed word hallelujah and he the one who says I hold a ky David yes sir I shut up your understanding no Theologian can open it up no Theologian no none of them can open it up and if I open it none of them can't shut it amen is that right you seen you can't say you didn't see you seen praise God hallelujah I've caught a glimpse of that Heavenly land praise God I'm going home you're not going to get back by human guessing you're not going to get back by professors or by professing you're not going to get back by presuming we're going home not by the birt canal we're not going back by human efforts to bring forth a birth no sir we're not going back that way that's the way we came but like the wise men We're Going Home by a divinely appointed way a divinely revealed way we're going back by a Rapture revelation for the Rapture is a revelation Hallelujah and as you are caught up in that Revelation you are caught up in Heavenly places in Christ oh praise God hallelujah oh my my my glory to God hallelujah yes sir yes sir oh praise God yes sir they asked the wise men had a seed of Revelation so they could not uh be uh misled or or or they can't accept some impersonation because they had a seed of life within them no matter how religious it sound no matters how messy it sound amen right no matter how many quates they know and it's good they have the rewards cuz you know in the book of life it talks about the bride but everybody is not going to be in Bride doesn't mean only the bride going to be saved the book of life has positions 144,000 going to be saved those that uh did did good to the bride and didn't even know they were doing good they some going to be saved and so on there's a list there you know Prophet teaches us those things but so we got to understand they were not because they of all these quotes and they know all this and that and that they're going to be saved too but they will not be in included into the bride class of saints there will be somewhere else guard servants whatever there'll be somewhere else in the Kingdom but they won't be a part of that elected lady for the day and for this hour praise the Lord God I'm going to try to bring this uh to an end as quickly as I can but before I go further let me tell you this week I want all of you to go back read the book who is this MDC because it tells us our way back amen amen praise the Lord amen yes sir so we see our way back God shows us his int his original intention in the person of MDC how MDC came if you will read it you will will find he says here you see uh he came already in a word body theophany but you in order for you to stand Temptation you had to bypass your theophany right you had to come down here and be caught in flesh to be tempted then if you stand all the father has given me will come in other words he will come and call and all those if you stand all those who are his will I will raise them up in the last day amen hallelujah see praise God that's the kind of body he came with praise God he came in a theophany word body it and morphed itself and then it became flesh how are we going to go back we are going back in the reverse that's it there is the way not the way of the flesh but the way of the world we are going word became flesh that flesh might now go back to become the word and be the original what it was in the beginning the great Holy Spirit revealing to us his divine plan so he came with a word body that could form itself over a period of time into a flesh body right but we go back in the same way he came from a flesh body working its way back Revelation quickens you and brings you back to a word body praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen we're going back to the godhead I said we're going back to the godhead I'm talking about in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily all we were all in Christ we were all in the mind of God we were in the godhead then we flowed out from the godhead to this point where we are but we're going back to the godhead we're going back to Oneness we're going back to uniting time in him praise God forever more amen yes sir we're going back but another way praise God now we know uh and this the Holy Spirit was uh showing me this praise the Lord say that way that the the the original sin I myself we all get caught with that and we always say oh Eve was the one that commit the original sin yeah but the Holy Spirit was saying to me no she was only used to manifest what was your original sin right whatever happens in the heavens has to declare itself on the earth it was not the woman of herself it was Satan it all was in him with his perverted mind right this is what he did in the heavens now another place he says you know before you do anything long before you did it that thought was already there right even if it passed as a quick imagination it was there and then the act followers right so he already had it in his mind but just like anything else he has to use an instrument God could use his pure word and speak it let there be let there be but he has to use an instrument it just so happen he chose the woman to do that right is that right so this is what God was just showing to me don't just go blame the sisters or come down on the women just all the time no don't do that right because it's not them yes they were an instrument yes they were the first one to be to be deceived but it's not them it originate in heaven War originate in heaven Satan and his lies originate in heaven the original sin was not just in the garden the original sin was right in heaven and sake from Satan in his mind hallu yes yes sir so we see Satan with his evil mind srack the human race and got them trapped into bodies of Flesh using the woman as an instrument right and thus we bypassed our theophanies Hallelujah but now we're going back I said we're going back not by a woman but by the word not by the female but by the male not by the headship amen praise not by the the female but by the headship of the word amen Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it uh let me preach a little bit more let me year show her hands how many want but that's a kind of a trap cuz if you don't put your hands off everybody else I didn't mean it that way after I said it then I realized it oh my God some of them going to say oh my God he's smart he's just pulling a little stap it's nothing like that that was just innocently done but really I'm going to be finished very uh briefly it's exactly 1:00 so what is it if you give me 5 minutes morning praise the name of the name of the Lord Upon This Rock I'll build my church it's based and built upon divine revelation divine revelation and as I said it's Revelation is by Grace you could have read the Bible 5,000 times but when your time comes like I've always quoted the quote where brother Bram said yes and they will will only know when it is time for them to know when your individual time comes the word will break the spirit of God will move across your life like that amen so Upon This Rock I build my church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail of course the Gates of Hell going to fight it this is what he's saying here but it won't Prevail praise God hallelujah let me say make a statement here there's no person that has ever come in the presence of Jesus Christ or in the pr the real presence of God that ever went back out the way they came never Legion was mad as mad could be insane lost his mind he needed more than a psychiatrist needed more than a priest with a brass cross in front of him uh trying to rebuke the devil like by that no he none of those he didn't know what to do and they just left him in the tombs amen but praise God then came Jesus on the scene and he went back and was never the same again Bible says he was in his right mind why he met the word and when you meet the word you you've come to your right mind amen now they're telling you that you lost your mind when you took this Faith you follow this message you didn't lose your mind you gain the mind of Christ you gain the revealed word god straighten out your mind now you can see things by God's equation of his word amen what about the woman at the well she came and met him with her life one way she went back a different way come see a man that show me all things I have done you read the word god it will reveal every secret thing in your heart you can't hide from the Holy Spirit can't hide from the word of God it will search your heart it'll find you and it's Christmas time so let me say it again it'll pick every feather off of you like you pick a Christmas turkey clean it'll take every feather off right and make it clean glory to God hallelujah what about Saul Saul left and came from Jerusalem but he didn't know he was going a different way he left under orders to catch them Christians but while riding on a road to the masus bright Sun shining down in a hurry to catch as many as he can and to kill all of a sudden the Bible said at midday midday a light brighter than the sun yes a light brighter and the sun suddenly shined upon him and out of the light come of voice Saul Saul why persecutest thou me who art thou Lord he knew it's only God can do that who art my Lord the voice said I am Jesus amen isn't it wonderful that the that that Jehovah the Old Testament is a Jesus of the New Testament it's the same it's just that one come from Spirit and form itself into a flesh body and give the flesh body and name name Jesus but it's the same Jehovah God in Christ Christ in the church the kingdom being restored back to the word hallelujah caught up in the presence of almighty God Amen yes sir what about those Shepherds they come there in one way when they went back in another way oh my praise God forever more and the same way you come in the church here today you've been coming for a long time maybe you never came before but you're here today you'll never be the same again you can't plug your ears plug your mind close up you can't say I didn't hear you hear amen and you'll have to answer for what you heard of the day of judgment amen yes sir praise God hallelujah yes sir so thanks be to God they were led by star once they found where the fullness of the word was they didn't need the star anymore because they weren't going by Starlight they were going by Revelation amen hallelujah it led them straight and it has done their the job the star finish its job is that right the job the star finish his job doesn't mean that you you you don't respect the star you don't love the star you don't want to talk no we want to talk about the star we want to thank God for the star we want to praise God for such a life like that amen praise God but this is not about the Star Messenger this is about him the word making himself revealed once again praise the name of the Lord yes sir oh praise God see remember the children of Israel led by the pillar of fire when they come to when they came to the Gap uh of uh you you know the per pyramid and between the seven Church ages and the Capstone there's a gap that's a symbol of the same river that the children of Israel had to cross Jordan and go over into their promised land and you know the pillar of fire disappeared from that time never seen again until it comes back to the book of Acts wasn't seen again because they didn't need it they had the arrived they gone entered into their Promised Land praise the name of the Lord and now we are come to that place we don't need that star to guide us anymore it's brought us to the perfect word and the word takes us the rest of the way it take us across the chasm that's why you see he has holy spirit amen if it's up there you can see it the only person can take you over that is the Holy Spirit hallah Hallelujah by Revelation he takes you over yes sir amen praise God not by study not by look I've done all of that I've done the 21 day fast up to 40 I never went beyond that oh my God prayed all night after my wife is sitting right there she can tell you pray all night and not just soft nice prayers but prayers that will rock rock the building praise praying in the presence of God all of that but that's not what it is that's not what it is brother and sister it's simply God chose you and elected youah and he choose to reveal or make known himself to you and he can do it through or by the simplest piece of scripture in here the written word is only a representation of the invisible God see see so we just put our faith we read the written word so that he has a Gateway or a way to make himself known to us praise the name of the Lord I want you to get hungry enough so that when I leave here you want to leave here like a bunch of race horses to get to your uh get to sual or Steakhouse or or whatever or if you have a roasted Christmas turkey at home you want to get out of here quick but man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God is that right but while he is in this body he shall not live by the word of God only he needs some physical food for his natural body is that right brother praise the name of the Lord hallelujah so I said it and I mean it I'm going to be finished here hallelujah they got across Jordan it never was seen again and my closing thoughts now remember when Abra Abraham had the victory over the five Kings you remember that and you know I preached on that before the five Kings with your five senses is really what the spirit of God is teaching us Abraham is the type of the believer who by faith now overcome their five senses that tries to control their life the devil using your imagination your thoughts your your and so to control the believer but we got the victory over it we still have them senses but we don't trust them we trust the word our faith is in the word of God hallelujah no matter how my senses tell me one thing the word says something else is that right praise the name of the Lord so there he is coming back from defeating the five Kings and he is met by MDC what was he doing he was going home he's on his way going home and MDC meets him and what does he do he serves in communion right that's why when Jesus came later on he instituted it serving the communion the bread and the wine but MC had already done that back there right uh it's just that he came down into flesh and he did what he already done one he did up here and the next one he does here one he did to Abraham now we see Abraham's Royal F seed is coming back home after their victory over denominations over demons over Devils over trials and tribulation and they're going back home ready to go in a Rapture and again her comes MDC in the form of the revealed word his theophonic body making itself known to each individual believer and revealing it himself to them thank you giving them the bread thank and the wine thank you breaking to them the seventh seal opening up the word to them Peace by peace opening up the word to them and in pouring out upon them the wine of the holy spirit amen hurt not the wine or the oil don't hurt that bread don't hurt the wine why he's pouring it out right now upon the True Believer hallu hold to God's unchanging hands amen yes sir thank God pours upon you that new that last wine praise God we come out to the last Church age

age gone past and now he's opened the bottle he's pouring out the wine he's pouring out stimulation upon this revelation of the Rapture this revelation of the body change this revelation of the way
