TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] oh happy day oh happy day oh happy day when our savior washed my sins away praise god this is indeed a very happy day this marvelous wonderful sunday morning coming together to give him glory honor and praise we thank him we magnify him and we adore him praise the lord i ask god for grace and mercy to the families of those who have passed away we live in a great a time of great peril trial testing grief and fear but in the midst of it all god standing in the shadows watches over his own he has promised that he will never leave us nor forsake us but that he will be with us to the very ending of the very age and more so we give god the glory that christians physically may die may expire but spiritually he that liveth and believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live thanks be to god may god strengthen and encourage hearts around the world who may be suffering from the grief of the passing of a loved one they're passed from you into the presence of god and i believe god's warming comforting presence reaching out and saying come thou good and faithful servant enter into the joys of your lord i believe those are the greatest words that will ever be heard by those who have passed on and left the rest of us behind may god straighten us comfort us as paul said there are others who have gone before us therefore let us run the race with patience let us run not looking back looking behind but pressing forward to the mark of the high calling which is in the lord jesus christ how good to come at a time like this knowing that one has crossed into eternity others have crossed into eternity praise the lord may the great holy spirit warm our hearts and our lives comfort us in this hour and straighten us in this time of grief i also want to say that from around the world i have been receiving various letters to good neighbor ministries here our website wonderful letters from various ministers individuals and so on speaking of the blessing they have been receiving from the preaching of the word the reception of truth oh and the continuity of the revelation of the word that has been going forth it has been a strength a comfort a guide to many who would love to use this now why i'm remarking on this is to make it clear we are not here to set up a new denomination i am not here to gather a following after myself i am not here to build a name or or to gather fame or notoriety uh a matter of fact i believe it may be the opposite just a rough and ready fellow just one who simply and humbly wants to declare god's word and let the chips fall wherever they will amen oh praise god we are not here to ask you for money we are not here to ask you for anything but to give your life to jesus christ the rest is in the lord's hands and so we thank god for all our brothers and sisters wherever they are around the world but let me again repeat i'm not here to form another organization i'm not here to gather churches around myself i am not here to elevate myself in the modern day terms of being a a great archbishop or something of that nature amen of course from the bible a bishop is just a regular pastor uh it's a bishop it's it's uh that's been changed by the system uh over the years from ancient times so let me make that clear i am just here to represent jesus christ and to preach the word of god in his purity and with divine understanding that god has given me now you may want to differ from me and that is absolutely fine for we are both looking at the same bible the same word and you may want to or say it's a post and another man may want to say oh no uh touching the ears it's a fan and another one touching the the this snout uh will turn around and say oh that's a large horse that's a fireman's hose that's nothing not a pulse but the fact is the entire thing is an elephant and each one may be touching on a part of it and he's giving his revelation or his thought of what was given to him so uh god bless you wherever you are if you think what i am preaching it is uh not to your liking or anything like that god has fitted people from around the world that will receive my message a goddess fitted people that will receive your message you may think this is nonsense this is foolishness well if you call this crazy if you think this is foolishness then leave me alone and let me be a fool for christ let me give him praise and honor and glory using this life that i have to use it for him and for him alone praise god well for today our scripture is found in the book of joshua amen chapter 3 reading from verse 11 to verse 17. shall we read together behold the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth pass it over before you into jordan now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of israel out of every tribe a man and it shall come to pass as soon as the souls of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the lord the lord of all the earth shall rest on the waters of jordan that the waters of jordan shall be cut off from waters that come down from above and they shall stand upon a heap and it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass over jordan and the priests came bearing the ark of the covenant before the people and as they that bear the ark were come unto jordan and the feet of the priests that bear the ark were dipped into the brim of the water for jordan overflowed all his banks all that time of harvest that the waters which came from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city adam that is beside zaritan and those that came down towards the sea of the plane even the salzi failed and were cut off and the people passed over right against jericho and the priests that bear the ark of the covenant stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the jordan until all the people were past clean over jordan oh praise his marvelous and wonderful name let us pray dear ones in christ our gracious god our heavenly father poured down upon us the blessed holy spirit anoint thy word and anoint the hearts to receive the word may you lord god receive all glory honor and praise may your name be uplifted may your word be made manifest may your word be made clear and mere hearts rejoiced in christ together giving you all praise honor and glory amen in jesus name praise god hallelujah now my subject today is the crossing the crossing but in actual fact i want to speak my friends about three crossings three crossings israel crossing first of all crossing from egypt into the wilderness crossing the red sea i believe my friends that if we are to go back and look at this picture we are thinking of moses and the children of israel down in egypt's land sun and sand er and everything all around them moving around their eastern garments task masters cracking their whips on the backs of those poor uh weight laden slaves that were forced to build the the pharaoh's treasure cities burial places all the places and roads for their great empire they were pressed into service and their taskmasters cracked the whips across their backs without mercy fear or favor but then the 400 years that god had promised abraham that after 400 years i will remember your children abraham when they cry to me i'll answer their cry and i'll deliver them from the hand of their oppressor and so what happened as you know i'm shortening the story how that god raised up moses from the baby in the bull rushes to the time when he became a son of pharaoh's daughter and there he was raised trained in all art sciences wisdom knowledge of of egypt and was accounted that in his day he was one of the wisest men in all of egypt and so there was moses at the height of his ambitions at the height of his great achievements and while he was at this great height of his achievements the god of heaven looked down and knew of course that moses was a chosen vessel and god plucked him out of that after his great uh the great time of killing the egyptian and then having to flee into the wilderness but it was the leading of god god was doing that for his own purposes and there we find that many times many of us even in the modern age we may have a great job we may have a great powerful position we may be anyone for that matter oh glory god hallelujah but yet one day god will come to you and speak into your heart whether by dream whether by the preaching of the word whether by the reading of your bible whether you're a king a commoner a priest a judge a policeman a fireman a scientist whoever you are wherever you are you may be in a powerful uh influential or financially capable position and yet god will come and find you wherever you are and let you know that you are his son you are his daughter you are one of his chosen vessels you are one of his servants hallelujah praise god hallelujah and he may cause me to even say this so that you may just hear these words and recognize that it's the god of heaven calling you speaking his word that you may recognize you may even have had a premonition before god might have given you some inclination before god might have spoken to your heart somewhere and now the irs coming the power of god the great holy spirit you calling you to your place and your position that you might recognize and know him and the story goes on in the midst of the heat of egypt and not the sands of the time moses across the pharaoh and his entire empire just imagine one prophet one man anointed by the living god was enough to go down to egypt and take over the entire empire by the power of god's holy spirit amen glory to god and there was moses and he told pharaoh about the plagues pharaoh in his obstinacy and his stubborn uh personality rebellion against god turns around and says who is your god and the plagues ensued the plagues began to come upon them and after a while pharaoh's own child died reaping wailing in his house and he couldn't take it anymore and he says go out go out take them and go out with your flocks with your words go out in the wilderness go out i don't want you anymore oh my praise god hallelujah some of you because of the holy spirit in you because of your choosing because of your predestinated position you may even be in a denomination but already you're finding they're ready to kick you out the reason why it's not because you already recognize who you are and what god is doing to you but the devil recognizes who you are and what is in you and the things you are saying the actions you are you are having in your life they are unnerving them getting them very nervous and so you find yourself as an ugly duckling and plays to the point where they want nothing much to do with you you may be a preacher in an area and you're preaching the word of god they don't like what you're preaching they get mad at you they want to harass you harangue you they want us a spell say all manner of things against you and they want to speak against your preaching your teaching instead of leaving you alone to preach the word because you're not troubling them let them preach the word anyone else preach the word and praise god just leave him alone but the devil won't leave you alone i'm afraid for jesus said they persecuted me and they're going to persecute you also praise god hallelujah now this is not deep message this is no mysterious message this is something to go straight to your soul and speak right into your heart to let you know where you are and so moses led the churn of israel out i can see them gathering their flocks and words oh i can see them piling and packing their things upon their their blocks upon their their mules and their horses and their asses and and and just streaming out of egypt and heading towards the wilderness of course before they got to the wilderness they had to cross the red sea amen oh and you know pharaoh which is a type of the devil had set them free but after a while he thought about it why should i set them free what's the matter with me that i let them go and better gather my army and go back and capture them and bring them back again that's the same way when one is prayed for for sickness or a devilish cast out jesus said he go it about and he he looks up for another house and when many can't find one he said well why did i let that person go i should really go back and get them again and that devil will seek to return from whence he came and so under the hot sun of egypt i can see pharaoh with his army coming down towards the israelites that were towards the red sea the banks of the sea wanting to go over but there is a wide sea in front of them they had to make a crossing but how are they going to cross oh my and so pharaoh coming down against them to take them back into slavery bondage and the task masters were ready to crack the whips once more upon them and if you know the geography of that area one mountain on one side another mountain on the other side the sea before them and pharaoh coming with his hosts behind them charging down upon them with thousands of horses and chariots and horsemen armor streaming their all my friends the brass the the gold the silver bucklers upon them shining in the sunshine the plumes upon their helmets swaying in the wind as they charge down upon them and the israelites got nervous begin to scream to moses but praise god moses turned to them and said you should trust the living god you'll know it if you've seen the great movie the ten commandments you'd have seen how charleston heston stood up on that large rock it may not have been that way but he dramatized it how moses stood upon the rock raised up his rod amen praise god and called upon god and asked god to deliver his people the lord will deliver you by the mighty hand and the bible tells us how the wind blew and when the wind blew the waters began to churn and moved the east wind and the west wind blew and planted the waters glory to god hallelujah and the water spotted and the wind dried up even the bottom of where they would walk normally that would be muddy and everything else but the wind blew the waters apart and then it dried up where they're supposed to walk oh praise god and god's people came right down and were able to walk right over hurry across that river that great red sea amen hallelujah being chased by satan oh praise god my brothers my sister many times we are in positions where we feel we don't know how we're gonna get over how we gonna get over tonight are we gonna get over the next week the next month the next years oh how we gonna get out of this problem pharaoh is behind me trouble is behind me problems are behind me debt is behind me oh all manner of stuff behind me how am i going to get out of this but thank god we serve a god that will make a way where there is no way he'll open a door where there is no door you think you got monk rivers you tinker and crossable he you got mountains you can't tunnel true god specializes in things that are impossible and he will do whatsoever that he wants to do for nothing is impossible with god only believe for all things are possible to them that will believe the word of god hallelujah oh my listen you'll notice from the inner veil brother branham speaking after israel and overcome the israel egyptians by passing through by grace passing through the red sea god drowned the egyptians behind which is a type of the passing through the blood of the lord jesus christ and that all the task masters that once drove you to sin sins of the world they are all dead behind you now there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins and sinners plunge beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains oh glory to god hallelujah my brother sister this crossing of the red sea amen is a type of redemption by blood and power it's a type amen of the cross for the cross is a type of that where jesus hands were stretched out from eternity to eternity alpha and omega so that we could cross over him for he was our bridge of life he was the bridge where we can cross the great chasm and cross from eternity and back to eternity from sin to eternal life by crossing upon his shoulders at the cross at the cross where i first saw the light and the burden of our hearts oh my the burden of your heart oh it's all rolled away oh thank god i received my sight and now i'm happy all the day oh glory to god amen amen yes sir once we all dwelt in egypt a type of the church world the church world and of the natural world amen and we were enslaved by various masters we had all kinds of task masters maybe the master in your life was some man in your life maybe your master or task master was some woman that controlled your life maybe it was a a drug habit that overcame your life and was the task master that was over your life maybe alcohol was the cruel master that was cracking the whip across you you had to have it it drove you it moved you it had the thirst the hunger in you maybe it was nicotine cigarettes smoking maybe that was your taskmaster maybe you had to have your pills one to wake up one to go to sleep amen and you lived off of them as if there were your necessary food maybe you had a taskmaster named lying a taskmaster called swearing some folks call themselves christians and they're even swearing and calling and using the lord's name in vain and others they are their taskmasters is money and they'll die from their lost and their greed for over money because it's driving them to move and work and and use all manner of manipulations and schemes so that they can have it amen and so that was there was the four that's the first crossing that every human being is required to make and some will refuse to make it stay in the world stay in the so-called nominal church and they will not come out from under that great wicked taskmaster that's cracking the whip over them listen to this those old egyptian taskmasters that drove the people to do things that they were burdened to do but after they look back into that red sea they found everything that they had drowned in there amen my friends can you look back now and see all your cigarettes drowned in the red sea can you see your empty whiskey bottles your rum bottles tumbling up in the red sea can you see a drug habit over there in the red sea of the blood of christ can you see that man that woman that was mastering over you loosed bound amen by satan bung by god and allowed to drown in the red sea can you see the mighty hand of god as he drowned all your sins all your taskmasters all of them that were over you are controlling your life and influencing you oh my when moses saw that he began to sing the bible says he sent a new song oh praise god i bet a lot of you have got a new song now i believe we all have a new song oh happy day oh happy day oh when jesus washed my sins away glory to god and he sang in the spirit giving glory to god and the bible said that oh miriam his sister picked up that tambourine and began to play and begin to glorify and magnify god hallelujah and the rest of the churn of israel the daughters of the churn of israel they joined her and began to praise god and shout hallelujah let me tell you something god save you you're going to shout amen god take you out of your bondage you're going to praise him the lord set you free you're going to shout hallelujah you're going to say amen you're going to say thank you jesus amen praise god hallelujah there it is brother sister miriam dance on the banks of the red sea giving glory to god because when they look back they can see all the things that once controlled them all grounded in the blood of jesus christ the red sea is a type of the blood of the lord jesus christ from which all gods delivers us oh praise his name amen yes sir oh thank god what how wonderful that was they must have had a great old-fashioned holy ghost meeting down by the riverside giving glory and praise to god because well he set them free he set them free and more they were praising and magnifying him and giving him glory amen praise god hallelujah oh my glory to god brother sisters after israel came out of egypt they went into the wilderness and as you know their wilderness journey started and as their journey started journeying from denomination and from worldliness right to the promised land now i want you to see here brother sister we are left the world we left the nami nationalism and we've crossed to this time amen over jordan into the revealed word of god for the owl amen now i might what i want to stop for a brief moment here and bring to your attention that 40 years speaks of a generation brother branham died december 1965 and what happened is 40 years from that should be around two thousand and five one generations past and passing i said one generation that witnessed the ministry of this prophet has passed and their passing one by one they gain the portal and now from 2005 to this time and when i give these dates it's not uh let's not scruple over years and times to say oh it was it was 2007 or it might be 2008 or 2000 or whatever uh a point i am making is that a generation has passed 40 years have passed and those of that generation seen the prophet witness him they have passed and they are passing where are we now we are now like 15 to 17 years into a new generation that are in their teenage their twenties their thirties giving god the glory and in the prime of their strength watch my friends hallelujah the old ones that were there with moses dr moses witnessing the miracles in the wilderness purifying a pier of cloud seeing the great manna and the quail and the effort and the water present in the rock and could tell it because it was graphically manifested before them and that is their message that god has given to them and god blessed them and god used that and is using that for his glory and for his honor and that is just as powerful as a man that understands all the mysteries of the kingdom is just to tell what god has given you and what you know either in its complexity are in its humility and simplicity and god comes in just the same for the same pain in the morning same prayer in the evening same pay praise god hallelujah god bless them god rest their scale and soul and god use them for his glory and for his honor amen praise god so my friends right now it's time for another crossing time for the joshuas and the caleb's to cross over oh my praise god it's a crossing time now oh bless his name amen yes my brother here we are they're crossing over jordan once again but not that jordan that was there i've been into israel uh about not about seven times and i've been down to the jordan to from the source of the jordan i've been to its source in the very gates of dan and seeing where it issued from the springs in the mountains and begins to run down like a broken goes down right down into the entire country right until it joins the great dead sea the great sea amen so here we are my brothers uh that they had that jordan and the natural jordan is there oh but thank god we also have a spiritual jordan that god has given to us in his word to those of you who have seen the great pyramid diagram and seeing how the pyramid was made how that the pyramid that matter of fact let me give you this by the prophet himself now god made three bibles the first one he put in the sky right the zodiac then we see god's next bible was the pyramid back in the days of enoch when they made that pyramid he built it up like this right up right to the point and the capstone of that pyramid has never been found they never put a cap on the top of the pyramid i don't know whether they did nor not the big pyramid of egypt never had a top stone on it why the capstone was rejected christ the headstone in our time rejected christ the word amen rejected in our day right as we grow from luther to wesley to methodist to baptist pentecostal right up to this hour the captain stone amen we're waiting and longing for the capping stone to come down and set itself right down upon the building that's completed oh glory to god have you not read the scripture the stone that was rejected has now become the head of the corner don't you know christ is the chief cornerstone hallelujah the time of the coming of leo the lion the captain stone and in the day same day of the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god hallelujah do you see where we're at we're at the end time it's a crossing time now the crossing is here brother sister to cross over out of darkness into light crossover from denomination into christ hallelujah amen notice that cornerstone is the keystone and that capstone is the cornerstone see for the cornerstone in the pyramid was the capstone and the keystone and it held everything together for the glory of god and that keystone was rejected amen now what did that represent when enoch built it amen oh my christ the revealed word of the hour hallelujah amen praise god and the church and the word has to become one like the capstone coming down upon the rest of the pyramid to become one so must the bride the church and christ the word must become one that is the bride out of each one of those seven church ages being capped off by the fullness of the revealed word of the hour amen see there it is the church and the word has to be won just like jesus and the father was one god was in christ reconciling the world to himself and will christ christ will have to be in the church who are the anointed word of the owl amen and see to make everything be fulfilled that's the capstone that comes down upon the last church age listen to this carefully that's the capstone the revealed word the capstone that comes upon the last church age no not the laodicean church not let this you know but that last one hallelujah now remember the last shall be first and the first shall be last and it tells us clearly after you've passed through the seven day week which the seven churches are a type of a seven day week a seven day week of presuming and presumption uh wondering about different things until god sends a prophet to say thus saith the lord and that settles it but this capstone is coming to settle down not on the ladies yeah but on that last church age that one it's a crawling out of that bride out of a church a church from out of a church just like he did to israel back then amen calling them as a nation out of a nation back in egypt but now we are living in that day and we are grateful for these things and that we are seeing it glory to god we are able to see it and to recognize what god is doing in this hour or thank god forever that man that the prophet spoke of in the stature of a perfect man oh i'm waiting for that day in that hour when that man that woman or praise god that eternal church age that comes at the ending of the seals i'm looking for that man that woman that will walk into that church age oh glory to god hallelujah amen praise god a church age without beginning and without end are people without beginning and without end are people with eternal life to live in an eternal church age oh praise god hallelujah what a hour what a time brother sister think about it now we have come back to the very foundations we have come back to the capstone revelation the most important revelation of the godhead in the whole bible is jesus christ is god amen and the father and i are one there it is one god and his name is none other than the lord jesus christ oh glory to god hallelujah so we are living in the hour of the restoration of the capstone the coming of the capstone the setting of the capstone back on the top of the pyramid the word of god revealed bringing itself back to preeminence putting itself back into a position where it really is allowed to govern the lives of his people and of his children that he could tell his sheep to go out when to come in for the true sons of god hallelujah the wind lord where it listed but no man not where it would accept he that is born of the holy spirit amen yes sir praise god if you notice in a diagram of the pyramid between the church ages and the capstone there is a gap between there that is our jordan today amen only joshua and the priests of the five-fold ministry anointed by the holy spirit can take you over by the opening of the river jordan oh when those priests stepped upon the world the seals open up when thus priests put their foot upon their water upon the water in other words by the priests stepping on the water it displayed their faith in the word of god before they would ever step with that heavy ark upon their shoulders upon that walk of water they had to have perfect faith believing the words of jehovah to step upon the water and walk in the name of jesus christ for god had spoken that when they stepped on the word when they stand on the word when they step upon the water the waters will park lord of god the word will open up hallelujah the revelations will flow praise god amen amen hallelujah and so my friends israel got over by the faith the priest stepped on the water oh praise god and the waters of jordan opened up hallelujah now many pastors believers ministers of this message are stepping out and standing upon the pure revelation of the word of the living god hallelujah and then when they step upon this revelation and said this is the prophet of the 20th century when they take their stand their clear form stand william marian branham amen oh praise god is god's prophet come in the spirit of elijah to fulfill malachi 4 5 and all the scriptures in the word of god when they take that clear stand and they have a revelation of what they're doing then the all the seals open up the words open up the revelation breaks praise god forevermore hallelujah then the word flows like a mighty stream it flows like a river amen glory to god hallelujah oh my praise god amen praise god and here my friends as the word opens up revelation of the serpent seed revelation of the mystery of iniquity or trail of the serpent from the garden right back to the book of revelation we see the activity of satan we see the riding of the four horsemen of the apocalypse we see the mystery of the church and of the church ages we see the revelation of god himself in christ all the mighty god in christ making himself known because the waters have parted the crossing r is here and the young ones are ready to cross over the young ones are stepping true amen praise god hallelujah many of those who went before us have helped to open up the way amen priests of god ministers of god children of the king lord of god and now we can walk where many of them have passed before and we are walking over now for the young ones the young generation of this hour remember brother branham 65 2005 2005 until this time a generation that's 17 18 years 20 21 30 up there oh praise god a young generation vigorous anointed revelated by the power of god's word and the spirit of god is breaking forth with mighty revivals and signs and wonders in his own way and for his own glory blessed be the name of the living god amen praise god brother sister with those revelations making themselves clear and the word opening up parting of the waters for us to walk through in righteousness in victory in the presence of god because once you cross over amen through that open word water jordan spiritually speaking you reach the land of corn and wine amen you reach the land where there's honey in the rock my brother there's honey in the rock for you place yourself for the sins to cover there is honey in the rock for you your cross over in the presence of god into the promised land of the new found land of this revealed word a land of corn and wine and milk for those who need it and grapes and oh praise god hallelujah we go in now to possess our position amen we go in now to conquer cities hallelujah i don't mean you just go conquer a city like that but you're conquering over those princes those territorial spirits those demons that control your tongue your city oh praise god we have the authority we have the ability we have the revelation we have the power of god to conquer over those cities amen and drive out the giants that are in those cities amen those giants are nothing but those great educated great money people great powerful people influential people that make you feel as if you're a nobody but thank god the great somebody has come into the little nobodies and turn those little nobodies into somebody's with a power of god in their lives or praise god forevermore signs and wonders breaking out through them oh the word of god flowing out like a mighty stream and a mighty river through them praise god hallelujah amen listen friends we god has given us like he said to joshua unto israel i give you that promised land that is your inheritance from the time of abraham and made him look over and see the promised land that is your inheritance amen before you even go to war before you even go to battle i want you to know you are going to win you're bound to win because i say so it's your land doesn't matter who is in your body doesn't matter what sickness or what ailment is in your life doesn't matter what troubles you are carrying now doesn't one of my problems come your way it's your land because i gave it to you before you even go to war you even go to battle i am announcing to you you're a winner you're a conqueror you are the possessors of the earth by the parents presence of the living god hallelujah because you are going to fight but the lord will fight for you for the battle is not yours but the battle is the lord's hallelujah shout for the lord has given you the city shout the lord has given you your healing shout the lord has given you deliverance shout get up from your crippled wheelchair shout for the power of god gives you the answer right now god has given you that before you knew it now that you know it if i

sight i would look and see amen amen if i couldn't hear i would listen and i would hear oh praise god forevermore if i was lame i would rise and walk in the name of jesus christ hallelujah for the lord has given us the city before we even make an attempt to do it god already give you your healing god already gave you the miracle god gave you already the deliverance and by that he's letting you

you the victory the lord has given you all the victory you need now to walk out of your position your condition that you are in to give him the glory amen the cross from israel egypt into the wilderness and now it's another crossing time we're crossing over amen but now it's crossing from the wilderness of worldliness denominationalism all manner of other isms and we're crossing into the very promised land of the word of god and all the blessings that god has promised in the word for us the most of all that he would park the waters the water of the world he'll open up the seven seals he'll open up your understanding to the word he'll open it up and you'll walk through on dry ground for the glory of god hallelujah i've reached the land of corn and wine amen hallelujah if you don't want to god don't hinder me but i've reached that land of corn and wine oh praise his marvelous and wonderful name for this mighty god whom we serve oh praise god praise god praise god i tell you brothers and sisters israel came to jordan and when they came to jordan that was also a sign they were at the end about near the end of their journey praise god and now we are nearing the end of our journey it's rapture time it's going home time it's time for another crossing now not just the crossing of revelation through the jordan of the opening of the word but we are now in another crossing to cross from death to life the cross from from this world to rapture into heaven we're crossing over now there's a crossing going on now there's a translation taking place oh praise god that they who are dead will be raised up and which we who are alive shall be changed glory to god the change has taken place that the crossing is taking place right now amen every one of us have to come to this crossing amen all of the human race except if they are raptured in the presence of god they must come to this crossing crossing from human life with all its grief its pain sickness is sorrow and sin and cross from death to the other side other certain cultures call it the river styx the others call it many other names but you must cross over this river of death but that jordan is a type of a dying to yourself dying to your past dying to all your old habits dying to you all your tasks masters all the controllers and you are born into a new walk a new life in a new way with god controlling and moving within your life but many today don't worry about this last crossing the crossing of death amen but we should because we don't want to die and leap in the dark amen just a week or so ago a brother was converted went and was baptized in water in the name of jesus christ three or four days later or a week later he was slain oh my what was it just like the thief on the cross god saw him and knew he was one of his attributes and had him come baptized in the water confessed the lord jesus christ seeing the word of god changed by the power of god and called him home amen yes sir remember me when tears are falling down remember me lord god before you're called out of here jesus said today thou shalt be with me in paradise oh thank god that brother is in the presence of god i praise god he's giving god the glory tonight amen he's giving god the glory and praise and the honor god bless him rest his soul in the presence of almighty god amen hallelujah brother branham loved the song i come to the river at the ending of day when the last winds of sorrow have blown there'll be somebody waiting to show me the way i won't have to cross jordan alone i would have to cross jordan alone jesus died all my sins to atone in the darkness i see he'll be waiting for me i would have to cross jordan alone thank god we can cross over with peace with jesus hand in hand jesus leading the way thank god we have no fear of anything of death of life heaven we fear none for perfect love casts out fear we now live as honorable righteous children of god sons and daughters of the king and we have come to this place where we have another crossing and when it is our time to cross over we'll cross with joy and happiness we'll cross to the place where there is no tears no more crying no more sighing no more complaining or murmuring no more hunger or thirst for all those those things have passed away and behold said the voice of out of the temple of god for behold i make all things new may god give you a new life may god give you a new beginning may god allow you and help you to start over again and straighten you as he walks every step of the road beside you and lead you for the rest of your life if you are sick and you heard the word of god be healed in the name of jesus christ if you are crippled in a wheelchair stand up rise up make god's put straight into those knees into those legs and help you to walk again amen if you were blind and could not see i rebuke every blind spirit may you receive your sight in the name of jesus christ hallelujah amen you were deaf as a spiritual scientist of god anointing of the holy spirit thou blind spirits thou deaf devils loose the children of god loose the people regardless of who they are and set them free so they
