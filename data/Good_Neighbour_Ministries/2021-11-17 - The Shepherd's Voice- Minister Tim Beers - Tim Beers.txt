no blessing you've got to have something to uh lay upon the altar amen i know uh covet uh gave us a relaxing kind of feeling to make those sacrifices where we could sit on a home and you know we don't have to come out and that and but remember and that's all good i mean we we all enjoy that in the flesh right but god requires a sacrifice because there's something in a sacrifice that we give that's a blessing amen that we he made the ultimate sacrifice for us he gave everything he didn't even have his own life he had it right brother branham said to live his own life and do what he wanted to do get married or do anything he wanted to do but he let that goal and he sacrificed his life so that the gospel you know that that's what we have to do too even coming here tonight right feeding on the word feed it on not brother tim but feeding on the spirit of god feeding on the spirit of revelation it blesses your life right and then you can go out and be that sacrifice to the world again in this day and age and that's what we come here for not just be shown not to have good attendance but that christ may live more within us amen hallelujah let us go to the scriptures we're going to continue at part 2. i mean i i didn't have much according to my gift left if i preach a lot of that message and i went through everything that that he had there but i i got one scripture that i i got and that's what i'm gonna preach on tonight and a few other little things that is from it amen but it's uh it's all in in line with uh our vision and our purpose for this hour amen and i want to title this i know you have it down as uh who do you think you're talking to it is who do you think you're talking to part two but i want to title it the shepherd's voice i want to talk about the shepherd's voice tonight amen so let's go to uh slide two and let's go to john 10 1 in the scriptures welcome you all on youtube land watching from wherever you're watching from across the world it's great to have you here joining your faith because we know that walls and distance there is none with the spirit of god amen hallelujah let us go to the word but before we do let's pray father thank you for your love grace and mercy tonight lord thank you for each one that has gathered here today lord that made that sacrifice thank you for each one that is watching and that will be watching father lord it's not by might not by power that man can do but by your spirit father jesus when you walked on the earth you said flesh and blood has not revealed it unto you but my father which is in heaven has revealed it unto you lord father it's only by that lord tonight that we ask we come before you lord claiming the blood of jesus claiming the cross lord that lord if we if we've said anything if we've hindered the spirit we've grieved the spirit in any way father that you would place us under the blood of jesus christ tonight lord that you would bless us and refresh us in your presence lord that you would lift us up lord make your word more real to us oh god we know that man cannot do that but lord you can do that tonight lord there is no distance in prayer there's no distance in your spirit and what you can do and there's no condition there's no situation that a heart can be in that you cannot speak to father and that you cannot change so grant these things tonight as we uh go forward in in thy name father in the name of jesus christ we bind the devil because we know the devil don't like what god is doing and how the spirit of god is moving so by your name father we bind them in the name of jesus christ so that the sons and daughters of god can have the liberty that that you purchase for them by dying on the cross lord grant these things we pray bless each one meet every need you know what's in the heart of the people here tonight father you speak you speak to them tonight father out of the out of the supernatural and out of the unseen in jesus name john 10 1 verily verily i say unto you he that entereth not by the door other words not by revelation into the sheepfold but climb it up some other way some intellectual way some religious way the same is a thief and a robber wow a thief and a robber but he that entereth in by the door revelation is the shepherd of the sheep to him the potter open and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name he leadeth them out and when he put it forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of a stranger amen god bless you as you see it amen what's the so much in this scripture here hallelujah my sheep hear my voice and i call them by their name predestination has called us tonight amen into this we we call it we don't call it into the message because we can say into a church or into another organization but into christ amen because the re the message is the revealed word of god we're called by our names into this revealed word of god in this hour and what is it supposed to do produce the word again in flesh we're not just to listen to the tapes amen or we're not just listen to some great preacher or even anointed preacher around but we're here amen to become the word made flesh again in this hour in this day and if that is not the purpose if that is not what god wanted to accomplish then what was the message sent for amen so we can we can idolize uh a prophet we can we can lift them up as a god these things are happening i know for a fact that they're happening amen they're pla they're putting them in the wrong position if he was here in this hour he would not be wanting to put in those positions that people are putting them in he must decrease amen and jesus christ the mighty angel who came down amen that brother brandon machine with the wings in the middle coming down he must increase amen but jesus is saying here that he knows his sheep he calls them by name and they follow him and they know his voice i watched this video on uh youtube and it had it i just came across it and it's funny i was just going through this and uh they did a test they had four people three of them they had a the whole field of sheep out there in in a farmer's field of sheep and and four people were there and one of them was the farmer and the other three were strange voices strange people so they went out and the farmer told them to do a certain call to the sheep because every time that you call that certain way those sheep come so the first one came out and and they did the call and the sheep were down they didn't even move the second one same thing the third one same thing but the farmer came out and he did that call and all of a sudden you see it right on the tv it was amazing they all point their heads up they looked and they started coming running because they recognized the shepherd's voice amen hallelujah there's something with inside a believer amen that recognizes his voice and doesn't follow a strange voice amen hallelujah glory to god amen wow in jeremiah 29 just going to recap a little bit from the last service a couple thoughts here for i know the thoughts that i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace not of evil to give you an expected end a beautiful end of your life then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you there's that word again and when you call to me and you pray i will listen you see the connection between purpose and prayer between god's plan and your life it's always good amen god's plan for our life is good romans 8 28 and we know all things work together for good to them that love god to them that are called according to his purpose so we can rejoice when we run into problems and trials for we know that they are good for us for they help us learn patience and endurance amen god always gives me what i need not what i deserve amen oh thank god for that because if i if i got what i deserve i wouldn't be up here tonight amen you wouldn't be here tonight you wouldn't be listening on youtube tonight if you got what you deserve but he always gives me what i need and what i need is more of his word more of his presence more of the holy ghost in my life which is revelation amen that's what i need because you know when the enemy comes in at a flood the enemy is already here your greatest enemy is not the one sitting beside you or this person or that person or the or the world or things of the world amen your greatest enemy is yourself it's your own flesh amen your fallen flesh and and that that's what raises up against us sometimes our own weaknesses amen yeah satan does circumstances he he brings this up he brings that up he uses this person people at work he uses even the enemies of your own household he'll use your husband your wife he'll use all kinds of things your children all these things will come up in your life amen but god raises the standard so that you can live above it that you don't get distracted that you don't stumble that you can continue walking in the spirit because satan's objective is to try to get you out of rhythm amen out of the spirit amen an athlete when he's training he has to be dedicated for those six eight weeks or whatever that they're doing or the time that they need they need to be dedicated they need not to be distracted amen to perform the way they need to perform and my brothers and sisters we need to walk in the spirit amen we need to live in the spirit we need to act in the spirit and it's a it's a bad doll it's the greatest battle ever fought that has taken place and there's people that are overcoming there's people that are battling there's people that are trusting god's word his power to his overcoming power and their and they're winning they're winning they're overcoming amen hallelujah and then there's others that are given up they're given in they're making all kinds of excuses i you know they can be legit i saw my wife tonight they could be legit excuses but remember they're still excuses and excuses are of the devil amen psalms 103 10 he had not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities he has taken our sins away and removed them as far as the east is from the west i like that from the east to the west because there's no end to the east to the west we are free my brothers and sisters we are free from this body of sin amen has no more control over you hallelujah amen now we look in the scriptures and we look to brother branham here i'm going to read a quote hallelujah to get into the the second part of this message here brother branham speaking here in the church ages smear it in we did not become seed by the rebirth there is so much confusion out there amen and if you don't get the word right that's why he says if you put the cow on top of the roof you're gonna you're gonna mess up the whole picture amen so you have to get the word right with inside of you you need to understand it and that's that's why we need him that's why we need his voice because we can listen to so many and i've gone through it 30 years i've been walking in this word and some people even longer but i've heard many many different people preaching amen and and and some of it has been the shepherd's voice speaking to me and some of it's been strange voices strange teachings and doctrines amen and what that does is just like if you don't get the godhead right you don't get the baptism right in jesus christ's name and don't recognize there's only one god in three offices you'll never see and understand that god lived in flesh fully lived in flesh and that god wants to come again and live in flesh in our flesh you'll never be able to recognize that god in your flesh today and that's the message that's the hour that we're living in god in flesh again amen we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore we were reborn for only the elect can be reborn bottom line amen so you're born again tonight amen not because you had some experience not because you came to the altar and you bowed down not because you even got the baptism of the holy ghost you were born again because you were seed of god and that's the only reason that you can be born again if that you are seed of god only a seed can be reborn amen hallelujah [Music] god by his death the shed blood bought us back he bought his own back he bought the back the spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my voice the word and they follow me the word you always were sheep you were never a pig or a dog turned into sheep and so many times satan put putting guilt and trying to remind us of our past and and and saying look what you did though even look how you think now we're going to get into the thoughts and we're going to get into where they come from a little bit here amen but listen what he says listen deep with inside your heart go beyond your imagination tonight go beyond your feelings tonight go beyond your emotions tonight go down too deep into your soul and let that word truth strike your soul because that's where it takes that's where life takes place it doesn't take place on the outer rims and the senses it does not take place there the truth of the word gotta go deep down inside and anchor there where you know that you and that word that truth that opened up to you becomes one in the same amen i was never a pig or a dog amen never that life and everything that this thing fails today tomorrow next week amen it's got it has to go back to the accuser satan amen right from the beginning of the garden eden it goes back to him not me the only way i examine myself if the holy ghost speaks to my heart and says and convicts my heart that i'm out of line my attitude's out of line or my spirit's out of line then i repent but outside of that this thing doesn't belong to me it's been it's been redeemed oh my you see the liberty and and the freedom that's when brother brahm said in the quote there he says when she recognizes who she is this is all part of recognizing who you are amen she will be invincible because these things that tie us down what ties us down my brothers and sisters what keeps us from going forward it's always that that the characteristics and and the attributes of satan that does that through the flesh amen hallelujah that is impossible for every kind of life produces the same kind and there's no change of species as we were in the thoughts of god then expressed in flesh there had to come a day where we would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice become aware of our father's calling us and recognize that we were sons and daughters of god we heard his voice and we cried out like the prodigal son save me o my father i'm returning to thee that was my experience when i heard the word of god amen i was not convinced to follow any men i was not convinced to follow any organization i was in the catholic church i was the head altar boy i was doing i could have been a priest or i don't know could have done anything i wanted in there really big organization big church amen but it was the holy spirit it was the voice of god that was calling me amen and i i can remember that voice you say well brother brother my brother and sister um you know that voice only comes right when you hear the prophet on the tapes that voice only comes when you come into the message well i'm sorry my brothers and sisters i'm not claiming to be special more than anyone else but i heard that voice before i heard that voice when i was deep in sin speaking to me amen i heard that voice many times as a childhood growing up and what what what turned my life around it started moving in a different direction where god supernaturally send me people from campbell's soup amen to speak this message to me is i was in the catholic church kneeling down on my knees amen after giving a confession to the priest amen where i had an experience where i felt like i was raped spiritually raped in there where i confess all my my stuff to him and and god would just show me you don't confess to a man you don't confess to that that office you confess your sins to me and before i even i'd knelt down there and he said say hail mary's and and and our fathers or whatever that was amen and before i could even say one i didn't even wanted to say it i didn't even understand i didn't know this truth but a voice spoke into my heart and said you will not find me here and every time he spoke he spoke direct he spoke very few words in my life but in all those few words that he always spoke gave me direction amen and led me you will not find me here oh my i wonder i wonder that voice keeps speaking to me when it when you get into certain things and even in the message amen there are certain things that are going on in the message certain teachings certain followings certain clangs and groups and cults performing in the message and the same voice is saying you will not find me there amen you'll find me where i always am in the word in the revelation amen oh my what a secret life a secret catching away jesus said no man can come to me except my father draw him all the fathers give me will come to me now look how can you say that the spirit dwells in you though you've done everything you thought was right here's your evidence whether you got it or not if the spirit that was in christ is in you it also quickens the word to you for he is the word amen and if it's contrary it will quicken you away from the word then it isn't the spirit of christ for my sheep hear my voice and they shall live by every word brother is speaking here in the horizon of the son they shall live by every word they can you can only live by every word amen unless christ is living inside of you amen there's no way that's where people try to put on works amen legalism comes into play do's and don'ts you've got to live by the word you got to live by i know i just read it to you you got to live by every word but i cannot live by every word on my own my own self my own strength my own abilities but the holy ghost amen the the voice that spoke to me the revelation that came into me the new birth that he gave me by waking up the seed will live by every word all i need to do is yield myself amen what is your job tonight what is your job every night every day yield yourself to the holy ghost amen amen die out to those things that you know that the spirit of god is speaking to you amen things of your flesh amen do the opposite i wonder if we stop doing that brother branson said when the devil comes and tries to tempt you in this way talk to you in this way persuade you to to yield to your weaknesses yield to the sin in your life to do the opposite we can't stop doing the opposite my brothers and sisters you say that the angels told brother brown and press on press on you don't know what's laying ahead of you amen and brother branham cried out in the spirit and and i believe it's the greatest battle i've ever fought amen he says oh brother brad i'm a weak and weak no no you're not weak you're strong in the lord keep pressing on making that choice in that decision amen to follow let's go to slide three when we were born there is no one who teaches a baby how to hear that you can go to school teach a kid growing up right a lot of different things but you don't teach a baby how to hear they're born when they're born they can hear when they born they can see you can't teach that in them you see that saints simple simple when you're born again you don't teach a believer how to hear the voice of god you don't teach a believer how to see too many trying to teach people or amen with education into this kingdom of god when you're born again it's automatically in you to hear his voice automatically in you to see his word by faith so stop looking to a ministry stop looking to a man they are there to edify they are there to preach the word for the spirit of god to use yes that is true to edify you in faith and strength amen but they can never man can never do the work that god needs to do god before the foundation of the world set his plan and orders plant a salvation in order and he placed an attribute a seed inside of you that he would wake that up one day and give it the new birth and then when that new birth comes you're automatically going to recognize his voice you're automatically going to see his word unfold to you hallelujah amen hallelujah that's why i don't get excited when you know let's go to this camp and let's go down to these meetings you know so and so is preaching man that guy's anointed and maybe true oh that guy knows how to really divide the word may be true but i don't get excited for that i listen to my father's voice amen because i can go down there lots of rain lots of thought you know lots of thunder lots of thing but no no rain amen a lot of those things are happening all over the place i want to go where the spirit wants me to go i'll get fed amen i'll i'll get what i need to get amen if i'm following his voice his spirit right and i'll grow up uh if i miss this preacher i miss that preacher or whatever amen i'm not worried about those things amen if god led me this far and he took most of you out of a life of sin corruption darkness evilness drugs alcohol sex and he led you to this word can he not lead you all the way oh yes yes he can lead me he started to work inside of me i know he has i know he has started to work inside of me and i know he can finish that work because i know what's impossible with man is possible with god and everything is possible to them that believe amen and i can't help but believe him hallelujah amen hallelujah amen when you are born again no one has to teach you how to hear god's voice amen his voice can sound like the still small waters or the still small voice or in the book of revelation his voice sounds like the voice of many waters amen that will speak to your life and there are there are three voices that will try to get your attention in this life amen now if you look right there just before i move on uh um still small water still small voice and the voice of many waters amen now god god planned and i've been going through this that that that we just don't hear god's voice through the through brother branham's tapes because the purpose of the message amen even brother branham said it himself in the church ages was that the voice would get inside of her the voice is inside of the bride amen in this last days she will be the final voice to the final age that we are living and i believe it's now amen that voice is inside of her now and brother brown said when that word of god gets inside of her amen and has the preemis inside of her life a surrendered yielded life to god not their own ways and their own interpretations but to god amen you put the word of god upon their lips it's like deity speaking again out of who who's he talking about himself no he was talking about the bride of jesus christ what was the purpose brother brown said of the story of eliezer amen abraham sent out alieser tell me more what is isaac really look like what is the purpose of eliezer amen to take the position of isaac to marry rebecca no to bring amen eliezer to rebecca to introduce the the husband and wife together oh my three voices that try to distract you the satanic voice always speaking against the word of god the secular voice that means attitudes activities or other things that have no religious or spiritual base the spirit of god's word in john 14 26 the holy spirit will guide you and lead you into all truth so these are the voices amen that will try to pull on us therefore when you want to hear god's voice you tune in to multiple spontaneous or flowing thoughts of god's word coming into you that's god speaking by his word into you even satan's thoughts come to us spontaneous thoughts too which is why we are commanded to take every thought captive second corinthians 10 5. amen because we we see here that we have spontaneous thoughts of god's word uh moving and scriptures moving things coming within us and speaking to us but at the same time we have spontaneous evil thoughts trying to take us away from the word amen hallelujah god calling you to a deeper walk calling you to a deeper prayer life amen and then thoughts taking you away using the three voices there the satanic voices trying to take you away making you feel guilty unworthy amen the secular voices of the world the attractions of the world the things of the world speaking to you trying to take you away from what god is calling you to do spontaneous thoughts and you have to rightfully divide the truth that's why it says in the scriptures you've got to bring every thought my brothers and sisters how can i do that the holy spirit does it holy spirit does it i'm not i'm not training or teaching anybody here tonight how to bring every thought captive to the holy spirit but the scripture says it so the scripture will do it the holy spirit will do it it's the holy spirit that goes into the word and fulfills the word not men not your ability not your carnal mind holy spirit gets into the word so the holy spirit says bring every thought captive amen and then when it when after you bring every thought captive to the word of god then here you are discerning the lord's body discerning god's thoughts in your life you need to discern the lord's body for your own life you need to discern how god is leading you amen and when god's spirit is leading you into prayer leading into a deeper walk a deeper consecration you need to discern that and and kick out the evil amen cast out the evil one out of our lives amen we still got to do that saints we still got to cast him out we still got to take the word of god our authority in the word and cast them out we still got to bind spirits we still got to bind their activities they're not going to stop you can stop all you want you can make a a a a sanction or a what's the word uh um uh agreement with uh with the devil all you want but he ain't gonna stop or you leave me alone devil you you you get off my back devil and you know what i won't go you know deep where the spirit's calling me i'll just stay right here live a a a religious comfortable life amen you can make that that that treaty with the devil all you want but i'm telling you right now he's he's the guy that makes you do the crime and he's the one that calls the cop on you amen and he's going to come right back around and still try to destroy your life so settle it my brothers and sisters settle it now amen that you got an enemy and you need to attack that enemy amen every time he pops his head up like the rabbit out of the hall you need to shoot him down by the word of god take the word that's been revealed to you take the word that god has shown you in your life he's given you a vision of where he wants you to walk amen where he wants you to lead your life and anything contrary to that cast it down shoot it down amen hallelujah glory to god slide 4. let's move on here god's thoughts line up with the scripture and with his various names comforter counselor now look at these characteristics so any your thoughts that line up with these you know they're god's thoughts he's the counselor he's the comforter he's the teacher he's the life giver he's the healer he's the deliverer his thoughts edify exhort and comfort they are pure peaceable gentle reasonable full of mercy and good fruits unwavering james 3 17. now satan's thoughts line up with his various names what are his names i'm sure you can identify with some of these thoughts that you if you're a believer walking in the spirit and in this battle you'll you'll know these these uh characteristics here accuser adversary thief who comes to kill steal and destroy your walk amen that's what brother branham said in the church ages he's come amen to make the church lukewarm powerless amen hallelujah his thoughts condemn and bring despair rejection fear doubt unbelief in a general misery satan's thoughts bring jealousy selfish ambitions james 3 14 15. that's his thoughts amen we all get the waves of these thoughts amen even today as i was prepared for this message i was i was just feasting and listening to brother branham and and i go i asked you to go back and listen to the message hear his voice 1958 amen and and it was being so blessed in the word so blessed in the spirit of god amen and the next thing you know i'm just walking along so caught up and then all of a sudden who i'm going what where did this come from i said and i stand back and it was just trying to pull me tempt me pull me in i said get behind me satan what the bible say resist the devil and he shall flee amen just like it happened with jesus when he was tempted 40 days get behind me satan these thoughts are are not god's thoughts these are your thoughts amen recognizing and difference between god's thoughts amen hallelujah amen oh listen to that still small voice and come to the word you say i heard a voice tell me this if it's contrary to the word it wasn't god's voice god's voice comes to the word amen in the message thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy but there are so many voices today that takes the voice of our lord away from us there is voices of pleasure so many people listen to that voice of pleasure where they can go and have a good time now listen here and many of them are professing to be christians hallelujah you know it's not the good things of life i want and i we've all got we've all gone through it amen where um where we we look and we we you know we say that uh you know brother there's nothing wrong with that there's nothing there isn't there's good things of life amen but let me tell you one thing that these good things of life these pleasurable things of life amen it's not bringing you amen under under any kind of bondage it's not bringing you under any kind of legalism because if the spirit of god and the birth is not inside of you amen it's sin anyways what is not of faith is sin amen this is just the truth my brothers and sisters hallelujah and the good things the pleasurable things of life you know who has the who has the authority here if you're born again christian common sense let's talk common sense here god has common sense who has the authority in your life is it the good things of life the pleasurable things things i can do or can't do it's the spirit of god that has the authority in your life we surrender to him we give our lives and we die out to him we forsake all our rights to him our free more agency is gone in him it's done it's gone in him when you surrender your life like jesus did to the father i can do nothing unless the father shows me i can say nothing unless the father gives me words to say i can go nowhere i can heal nobody unless the father shows me you interpret that for yourself if the lord's speaking to you tonight hallelujah and many of them profess to be christians and then you go then to really get down and pray you got to you got many other things to do oh my i we all made those mistakes we're all we're all made these mistakes amen i mean i didn't make this mistake today i had a wonderful time in the lord preparing for this message praying praying and praying amen i think i was breaking in and catching some victory over these 40 days of purpose the momentum that the spirit has given don't look at anything else look at what the spirit is doing and what the spirit has been speaking through through the ministers that have been coming up here and speaking every gift given something according to their own experience amen stirring up our lives i mean it's stirring up my life it's stirring it up to and all all when god stirs up my life it doesn't make me wanna you know become more like the world or make me uh have my own ambitions or make me do my own thoughts when when god stirs up my life amen it it draws me closer to him to be more consecrated to be more dedicated to go back to that love of god amen hallelujah you only know what i'm talking about if you experience that love of god amen breaking through into his presence and that's what he's saying here many times god calls us the prayer amen and and we say a little prayer amen thank you jesus we read a scripture and say oh jesus wept and that's it for the day that ain't going to do it my brothers and sisters that ain't going to produce the life that is needed in this hour to overcome the enemy to overcome this age the darkness that is here it's not good enough how many and i judge myself in this category how many of you have broken through in prayer where you enter into that other dimension you know when they break space they break that the atmospheres of space and then when they get there there's floating and they're just floating up there's peace up there well it's only a type of what you do when you break through amen you got to pray my brothers and sisters you got to pray you got to turn off your phone you got to turn off all distractions you got to get away from things sometimes i know we have to work we have busy lives sometimes but you have to you have to you have to do this you have to get away and and make that time where you shut everything out no matter what and break through and get into that other dimension and when you break in i've been there many many times by myself i've been many times with believers we break into that dimension the next thing you know once you break through whether it takes a half an hour whether it takes an hour you sit there and i'm telling you everything is clear you know what to pray for you know what to speak for god will show you your life he'll show you your kid's life he'll show you the church he'll show you in that dimension he'll show you everything he needs to show you and then you just it's so sweet when you get into that dimension and you start when you start praying it's sweet it's not bothering it's not tired it's not like whoa my you know i've been praying for like uh an hour and a half now if you're still conscious of the time that you're praying and what you're praying then you haven't broke through yet you haven't broke through in that dimension amen and that's why jesus went many times off to pray let's go on here amen we'll get right into it so faith comes by hearing the word of god in john 10. behold i stand at the door and i knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and i will sup with him and he with me revelations 3 20. that's still the same today my brothers and sisters he is still knocking on our doors in all these areas amen he might not be knocking to reveal that you know the message to you or the new birth to you but he's still knocking and knocking in areas of your life to draw you closer into him not realizing my brothers and sisters when you surrender to that the very victory that you're looking for the very thing that you're looking for to overcome in your life lies behind that door that you need to open it lies behind that door whatever you're struggling with hallelujah this is what makes our faith different from every other storyline in the world god says you're a sinner you deserve punishment you deserve hell but i'm the good god i'm the good shepherd i love you i am the i'm also the holy and just god paid for your sins so that so here the deal i do i do it i pay for your sins i will come to the earth as the son of god jesus christ i will die for your sins you're not dying for mine i'm dying for yours god doesn't have any sin this is the gospel this is the king's sacrifice himself for his people amen the shepherd sacrificing himself for the sheep where do you find out there out there do you think that any shepherd will sacrifice themselves for any of their sheep you say brother that's that's natural that's that's crazy how can a human being sacrifice himself for a sheep an animal it's not crazy my brothers and sisters if you look at it through the eyes of god and who we were in in sinful lives in this flesh amen that's what really happened the shepherd the god of glory the king of glory sacrificed for his sheep us who were no good who didn't deserve anything he laid down his life the same even greater than the natural slide five here's the mind-blowing thing not only did jesus die to pay for our sins that's good enough right there but he has another thing he does in that there is the great exchange he imputes his goodness he imputes his goodness inside of you his life inside of you he takes all the bad out all the sin out and he puts all the good the word of god in hallelujah it's a blood transfusion that he is doing this is the great exchange my there is so much that he has done for us oh my but you wonder why brother branham cried out in the spirit so many times why shouldn't we live for him why shouldn't we give ourselves to him why shouldn't we sacrifice ourselves for him and what he's done for us amen hallelujah look at the next verse in the bible second corinthians chapter 5 21. god took the sinless christ he never done anything wrong and he poured into him our sins jesus takes the guilt from every rape every murder every gossip every lie every molestus evil spirit every tax invasion everything done wrong ever in history god took the sinless christ and poured himself into him for our sins all the sins of the world then here is the unbelievable part then in exchange he pours god's own life into us are you kidding me when god looks at you he doesn't see your sin he sees the blood he sees the life of christ he takes all the bad out then he puts all the good in that is the great exchange that took place in your life when you were born again amen abraham had to believe just what that voice told him and we are abraham's seed he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong given praise to god knowing that he was able to perform what he promised notice this something you possess it's not an imagination you really have it it's not it's just as real to you it's just as real to you as you know you're riding in your automobile here tonight it's just as real to you as you're sitting in the church it's just as real as you hear my voice it's a substance it's not an imagination it's not an emotion but something that you have and it comes by here in the word of god and that only where your faith then is not in some individual it's not in a man it's not an organization it's not in a group of people it's in god because god is the word my brothers and sisters it's not an imagination it's not an emotion it's not feelings this goes deeper it's something that you know no matter what condition that you're in tonight what you're feeling what your emotion level is tonight amen is something that you possess that is real you know you possess it you know you have it tonight real in your life and if it's not real and if you don't know you have it and you don't know you possess it it's the time and it's the hour to seek and you shall find knock and shall be open amen god does not withdraw nobody he said those who are hungered and thirsting for righteousness amen come come unto me those who have elated in burden come unto me pray unto me hallelujah my brothers and sisters preachers are preaching the true gospel of jesus christ all around the world we are in the darkest age amen we are in lael c and lukewarm spirit age we're all here fighting tonight i can see we're fighting it but i know deep down in your heart a true believer deep down in your heart amen you're you're craving that word you're craving the spirit of god but we're all fighting this elements here amen hallelujah amen that's why ii corinthians says casting down imagination and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bring every captive under obedience to christ here it goes again bring every thought captive to obedience to christ everything that exalted itself above god amen pride selfishness your own wants your own needs amen so many things slide six obedience the bible says it's better than sacrifice some people want god to speak to them when they haven't done what god already told them to do that's a big thing my brothers and sisters speak my lord speak my lord speak into my life i need you to speak i need you to speak and then you walk out to the church week after week month after month sometimes year after year crying the same cry speak to me my lord speak to me and god is saying when you obey what i've already spoken to you then i'll speak wow that's a big one my brothers and sisters you ever heard the saying go back to where you left jesus amen hey you have to judge that for yourself examine yourself to see if you're in the faith amen judge your own heart judge your own experience something wrong with your experience something dying into your experience something stale in your experience well get down and pray get down and fast amen get down before god with an with an open heart amen and say lord speak to me and he'll if if there's something that you're not obeying that thing will come right back again i've had it my brothers and sisters where i'm praying about things and i'm seeing things i'm seeing attacks all over the place and i'm praying for a breakthrough in a lot of different areas and i get down and i start praying and all of a sudden this thing just comes over softly and all so many times before i've looked at that stuff say ah that's nothing oh that's probably my thoughts oh that's so simple why do i have to do that who are you who are you to judge who am i to judge why god does what he does you know some of the greatest deliverance and the greatest miracles that took place were the simple things the foolish things that people have done out of obedience to god listen god hid in his simplicity and revealed in the same my brothers and sisters watch those simple things that cross over you you got you got a simple thought that oh something that you did or whatever long time ago or god wanted you to do a long time ago wanted you to say this or do this or or make this writer do that or do whatever it is my brothers and sisters just look at it when you're in prayer and that if that thing comes back and it keeps coming back to you you know what act upon it i know the spirit i know if you want to say it's not this way but the only way i can explain it as a human being i know the feeling of god's thoughts when they come when the spirit comes and he reveals and god speaks he god has a tone a sweet loving tone in his voice and when he speaks to you you know it washes over you you know that tone it's different than man's tone it's different than man's rebuke man can rebuke you but when god does there's a different tone to it there's a love tone to it even though it hurts it it's still the love behind it is comforting amen so philip obeys as he walks along the road he sees a man in the chariot on his way the man just happens to be a treasure of the queen of ethiopia he has been to jerusalem to worship and now he's trying to read in isaiah the scroll while he's bouncing up and down in his chariot philip doesn't know this yet but he is sharp observation he knows the spirit he knows how to listen to the spirit the spirit told philip go to the chariot and stay near it acts 8 29 catch up to it philip does exactly an assistance to the situation with the help of the spirit and you know what happened he led the man to christ why because philip was obedient to the spirit philip knew how to listen to the spirit he knew he was always paying attention to the spirit always listening for the spirit hallelujah what does obedience bring to your life my brothers and sisters it brings clarity of mind how many times we struggle with fog in our mind confusion in our mind amen god satan is the author of confusion it brings wisdom it brings the guided hand of god in your life it helps you recognize the voice of the holy spirit it brings peace of mind obedience brings all these things it brings deliverance in our lives hallelujah amen let me move along quick i don't have much left here the bible says satan is not afraid of your plans satan is not afraid of your schemes satan is not afraid of your budget or your strategy satan is not afraid of your programs but he's scared to death of your prayers then brother branham say that the weakest christian gets on their knees all of hell shakes we've been hearing it over and over in these 40 days of prayer if prayer brings blessings then why don't we pray pray i don't know how to pray ask the holy spirit to teach you how to pray get together with people that want to pray that know how to pray amen read the psalms read the proverbs read the bible it'll teach you how to pray amen hallelujah god is saying prayer is a big part it's not the part it's not the evidence but prayer is a big part that's going to bring this rapture on prayer is a big part that's going to bring deliverance in your life breakthroughs in your life i believe that's why god one of the reasons that i see that god is bringing us 40 days of prayer not to bring a program we can't go by programs we're not under that spirit of programs but god bring this our way through brother simon then gave it to brother danny and danny took it and brought it this way and and leading it all to us amen because god wants us to pray god wants us to break through god wants us to break through where we get to a place where we start speaking his word that he will reveal to us amen when we break through it's all different my brothers we can pray we can pray together we can pray on the phone together amen but there's a difference when you break through in that other dimension when you finally break through all the veils of this world the veils of your flesh the veils of your mind then the spirit of god is in there speaking to you and then when you speak he gives you instructions and that's what brother brown talked about he gives you his instructions and you carry them out he tells you what to speak and you speak it and then you'll see because it's not your word it's not a word of a man now it's the word of god it's the spoken word and it will bring forth amen hallelujah quickly here verily early in the morning while it was still dark jesus got up left the house and went off to a solitary place where he prayed going away to pray and listen to the father is important pattern in jesus's life one that he seeks to demonstrate before his disciples for them to copy luke 4 42 jesus and ah jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed luke 5 16 in those days jesus went to the mountain and prayed and he spent and he spent the night praying to god luke 6 12 all night praying to god you know i i looked at that my brothers and sisters and sometimes like the bible says some come out by fasting and praying and if you're stuck and there's some there's a stronghold in your life you got to get that lazy thinking out of your mind that devil out of your mind and you got a plan and purpose that whatever like the bible says in the book of acts they were there until until you know when you prayed about something amen and you prayed it out of your life and you prayed at that that demon was cast out amen from bothering you holding you back in your life you prayed until it was gone it might not happen you know but every one of us satan has a punch coming satan has an area of our lives and we we need to wake up and realize hey hold on a minute all this other stuff is not working i got to make this sacrifice i got to do this sacrifice ministers we need to pray we need to pray more and more to come under that anointing to come under that the spirit where the spirit takes control of us and that man's thoughts are not being projected but god's thoughts are being projected that the supernatural will come into these vessels and that we will step aside amen and watch him do the things watch him speak i'm looking for more for that i'm praying more for that amen i'd rather preach one message that that is so effective and so so god not brother tim not the gift but so god that's why brother abraham said all the words that i've said everything that i preach one word from god is greater than all the messages that's what we want to get to a place it's not just going to come by a lazy life and i i'm speaking to myself it's not going to come that way it's going to come by a life that surrender to god i look at my i look at my brothers my african brothers brother desmond brother phillip brother coffee going down to jamaica there god bless all the saints in jamaica amen and let's pray and continue to pray for them you think they went down there without a prayer life you think they went down there without prayer and fasting no no you don't we don't walk anywheres this world is satan's eden amen we want to be fortified under that anointing under that prayer life amen and speaking that word amen let me just wind it down now close it off here a couple quotes here and then we'll uh the shepherd's voice the still small voice amen hallelujah not only to pray and read scriptures which we must do but also listen to god's whisper his voice we might be ready for the day that he brings us start our day with prayer read in the word you're never too busy if you need to get up a half an hour early get up a half an hour early before work read pray that's what it means to abide in jesus where he talked about the parable of the vine and the branches john 15 1-9 in the church age again here brother branham speaking jesus the name the word will you can't separate god from the word they are one the word he had left behind on on printed pages is part of him when you accept it by faith into a spirit-filled life he said his word is life john 6 63. but that's exactly what he is john 14 6 says i am the way the truth and the life so when a spirit born spirit-filled man takes faith that word into his heart and places upon his lip why that's the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go satan cannot stand before that man so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith i mean substance faith he's isolated from the entire world he becomes a new creature in christ now you're getting into bride material you see see see you're getting into rapture and condition now that means for the laity every individual that walks in a world with god alone you're baptized into his kingdom and nobody in there but you and him he gives the orders you pack them out whatever he says there is not a shadow of doubt nowhere now to get into that kind of condition to get in that kind of life to be walking in the spirit my brothers and sisters it takes a life surrender to god if the lord says this there's nobody in the world that can talk you out of it you go just right on the same musicians you can come now you're coming into perfect faith hallelujah that perfection cannot fail that faith never fails yes it's a mystic to the world but not to them with perfect faith hallelujah let us stand i do not believe that one can earnestly seek and find priceless treasures in god's call without a devoted prayer life that is through god's word and prayer where he speaks there is nowhere in the world a kind of life more sweet and more delightful than that of continuous conversation in prayer with god those only can comprehend it who practice it and who experience it in their walks in their lives you have the anointing from the holy one and all you know the truth the anointing you receive from him remains in you and you do not need anyone to teach you it but as the anointing teaches you about all things and as the anointing is real not counterfeit just as it taught you it remains in you first john 20 2 20. revelations 2 7 [Music] closing quote under the bible whosoever has ears let him hear what the spirit is saying to the churches hallelujah what is god speaking tonight everyone is an individual here tonight what did god speak to you you walk out of here feeling the voice of god i don't care i don't care how i you know the service went or if i didn't preach up a big storm or any minister didn't preach up a big storm or how he laid out the word it doesn't matter my brothers and sisters that is irrelevant in the spirit of god that man should get no glory for anything but him be lifted up on high and you walk out of here knowing that god spoke something into your heart amen the word gave you a feeling in your heart in a direction in your life to move in a direction he's telling you move in this direction go where i tell you to go follow me i'm leading you with bloody footprints with a victorious overcoming life i took the debt hell and and the grave i took the keys i took the power away from satan over the flesh over the mind follow me i'm leading you i'm guiding you into all truth that you need to know to overcome because you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free that's why he guides us into the truth in our lives i need truth for me my life the way it is is different in your life this even naturally the way i was brought up the culture i was brought up under the generational things spirits and and line i came out of we're all different so i need truth from god amen and i need to follow that truth in order to be set free [Music] hear his voice the shepherd's voice [Music] if you haven't heard the shepherd's voice in a long time you need to get back to that place in your heart with him so that he can speak to you the hour is too late my brothers and sisters if you're going down his permissive will brother branham said plain english you're going to have more battle scars upon your life you go down his perfect will which is listening to his voice following him that's what he said to all his disciples come follow me then you're gonna have less battle scars and you're gonna you're gonna rejoice here in more victory more blessings more abundant life that's what he wants you're going to make the rapture nothing can change your call in your election but why not live a more abundant life that he purchased for us a more victorious life [Music] not controlled by anybody but god i want satan's control over my life no matter where it is how simple it is out out i want the word to control even their sinful flesh even this carnal mind i want the word to control it to give me peace let us pray [Music] let us pray it's the hardest thing to do in this hour to pray and break through but let me tell you you who yield to these services and what the purpose was for and you that bring forth a prayer life not just uh thank you father uh this and and that and whatever a little simple prayer and pray about pray about oh god this happened that happened this happened no no no no no no no that's not bride prayer bride prayer breaks in that other dimension where the word of god is being revealed amen that's satan don't care about those prayers not don't move him but when you start moving in the spirit and you start praying and praying it's time that we start praying saints and breaking through and i'm telling you these services the ministers amen that the anointing the power it will start breaking atmospheres and breaking dimensions we need it satan fights a true church of god he fights the atmospheres he fights the people in their minds but when we come praying amen he can't stand that he can't stand before that father we thank you for your love grace and mercy lord oh the shepherd's voice lord speak in the stillness in the quietness of every soul get every soul into a place where they can be quiet before
