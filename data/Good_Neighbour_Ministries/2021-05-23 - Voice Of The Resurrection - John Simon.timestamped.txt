[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] good sunday morning
[0:16] friends once again
[0:19] we are gathered together to give
[0:23] glory to his marvelous name
[0:26] as a people assembled in his name
[0:30] to give him praise honor and glory
[0:34] praise be to god now
[0:38] i would like to recognize that
[0:41] this day is the memorial day
[0:46] of pentecost it's called pentecost
[0:50] sunday a immemorial
[0:54] to the day when the holy ghost
[0:57] fell upon the apostles
[1:03] on the day of pentecost in the upper
[1:06] room
[1:08] my visit there to that room in jerusalem
[1:13] was certainly a life-changing experience
[1:19] and a wonderful thing to be there
[1:23] i give god the glory for the marvelous
[1:26] and wonderful opportunity to visit
[1:30] the upper room may god take our hearts
[1:34] and our souls
[1:35] back to the upper room again
[1:38] not so much to speak with towns
[1:43] but to be able to receive the word
[1:48] like they did until they got so excited
[1:53] they could hardly hold their speech
[1:56] may the lord help us this marvelous
[2:00] wonderful and glorious sunday
[2:03] that we have come together as
[2:07] seed saints sons and daughters of god
[2:12] in a marvelous fellowship here upon the
[2:15] earth
[2:16] once our fellowship which we cannot
[2:19] remember
[2:20] from the dim past of the eternities
[2:25] when we lived in the mind and presence
[2:27] of god
[2:29] glorifying and praising him all day long
[2:33] but now being here upon this earth
[2:36] trapped in a human body
[2:39] we do the best we can in the frailty of
[2:43] human nature
[2:44] and human flesh but i certainly
[2:48] recognize today the memorial day
[2:52] of the very first original pentecost
[2:58] but for today i'm not thinking about the
[3:01] holy ghost coming down
[3:04] my thought is about the bride of christ
[3:08] going up and my topic
[3:11] is voice of the resurrection
[3:17] our scripture for today is found in
[3:21] 1st thessalonians
[3:25] chapter 4 from
[3:28] verse 13 to 18.
[3:33] shall we read
[3:37] but i would not have you
[3:41] to be ignorant brethren
[3:46] concerning them which are asleep
[3:52] that you sorrow not
[3:55] even as others which have
[3:59] no hope for
[4:02] if we believe that jesus died
[4:05] and rose again even so them
[4:09] also with sleep in jesus
[4:13] will god bring with him
[4:17] for this i say unto you
[4:20] by the word of the lord
[4:24] that we which are alive and remain
[4:29] unto the coming of the lord shall
[4:33] not prevent them which are asleep
[4:38] for the lord himself shall descend
[4:42] from heaven with a shout
[4:45] with the voice of the archangel
[4:50] and the trump of god
[4:54] and the dead in christ
[4:57] shall rise first
[5:01] then we which are alive
[5:04] and remain shall be caught up
[5:09] together with them in the clouds
[5:13] to meet the lord in the
[5:16] air and so shall we
[5:20] ever be with the lord
[5:23] wherefore comfort one another
[5:27] with these words
[5:32] our gracious wonderful heavenly father
[5:38] may the great holy spirit
[5:41] take these words from human lips
[5:46] and further transform them
[5:49] into instruments of your voice
[5:53] give the winds a mighty voice
[5:57] let the holy spirit send
[6:00] forth your truth and light piercing the
[6:04] darkness near and far father
[6:08] wherever light is needed
[6:12] shine into the dark corners of every
[6:15] heart and every place of the earth
[6:18] may men and women come to
[6:21] recognize you as the great shining light
[6:26] the one who sits upon the throne
[6:30] yes lord we bow down before you we adore
[6:34] you we magnify you
[6:36] we give you all the praise the honor and
[6:38] the glory
[6:40] this day we pray may you gush forth your
[6:44] spirit and your word
[6:46] that we might live under its refreshing
[6:48] graces
[6:50] and rise up to call you blessed
[6:53] in the name of jesus christ
[6:56] whom we love and serve amen
[7:00] and amen praise god
[7:04] my brothers and sisters friends wherever
[7:07] you are
[7:08] in this scripture that we have just read
[7:13] god himself is speaking
[7:16] to us through the apostle
[7:19] paul about the rapture
[7:22] mystery now
[7:27] throughout the church ages
[7:30] and since the days of paul
[7:34] no one fully understood
[7:39] the rapture process
[7:43] of the rapture the unfolding of the
[7:46] rapture
[7:48] until brother william marion branham
[7:51] came on the scene sent by
[7:54] god to fulfill malachi 4 5 revelation
[7:59] 10 7.
[8:02] now brother branham was the one
[8:07] which revealed this rapture mystery
[8:10] in its simplicity at the time when he
[8:14] unfolded it
[8:16] many of the preachers didn't want to
[8:19] hear the rejected
[8:21] hymn and even now some still reject
[8:24] him the prophet to this 20th century
[8:28] sent by god calling
[8:31] him names as much as they called jesus
[8:34] names
[8:36] but nevertheless he was sent by god
[8:40] authorized anointed
[8:43] by the living god and vindicated by the
[8:46] spirit of god
[8:48] to bring this revelation
[8:52] of the rapture to us for a mystery
[8:56] is something that is hidden
[9:01] as uh a revelation is something that
[9:05] opens up and reveals that secret or that
[9:08] mystery
[9:11] now the revelation of the rapture
[9:15] understood by him and taught
[9:19] by this 20th century
[9:22] prophet he revealed that it first of all
[9:26] would be a
[9:26] secret rapture it will
[9:30] not be as many have visualized it
[9:34] and have dramatized it or have
[9:37] drawn it in pictures showing
[9:40] folks coming out of their graves and
[9:43] night gongs and
[9:45] slowly rising i should say
[9:48] white guns are slowly rising
[9:51] into the skies and going into the
[9:54] presence of god
[9:57] and the whole world watching on
[10:00] while they're going up and
[10:04] and then some of those believers waving
[10:07] and saying well
[10:08] you should have listened to me you would
[10:09] not be left behind now look i'm being
[10:11] caught
[10:12] no that's not how it's going to be
[10:16] the prophet revealed it would be a
[10:20] secret rapture for jesus himself said he
[10:24] would come
[10:25] as a thief in the night
[10:30] okay he made it clear
[10:34] that this rapture would be in three
[10:37] stages
[10:41] and clearly he said
[10:44] the shout the voice
[10:48] the trumpet of course
[10:53] we understand that
[10:57] we want to examine this
[11:00] we want to examine it in the form of the
[11:03] voice
[11:04] of the resurrection
[11:07] jesus is descending paul draws the
[11:11] picture
[11:12] of jesus descending coming for his bride
[11:17] and as he comes for his bride
[11:22] he gives a shout
[11:25] and then the voice
[11:29] and then the trumpet
[11:34] now brother sister
[11:37] why does he come secretly and why is
[11:41] this a secret
[11:45] because first of all we ought to
[11:49] read revelation 5 1-5
[11:54] in which a cry goes out throughout
[11:56] heaven
[11:59] of if there is one that will take the
[12:03] book out of the hand
[12:06] of him who sits upon the throne
[12:10] and would take the book
[12:13] and open the seven seals
[12:16] that seals up the book which
[12:20] is to say that the the word of god was
[12:23] sealed through the seven church ages
[12:26] sealed with
[12:27] seven seals and who will come
[12:30] take the book and will
[12:34] open these seven seals
[12:38] oh no man was found worthy a voice said
[12:42] no man was found worthy to open the book
[12:46] and the bible says john wept for no
[12:50] man no pope nope protestant
[12:53] no catholic no denominationalist
[12:56] no man whether he's interdenominational
[12:59] whether he's a superintendent
[13:01] a bishop an archbishop apostle whatever
[13:03] he wants to call himself
[13:05] the bible says no man
[13:08] was worthy none could open the book
[13:13] and if anyone tells you they can
[13:16] break those seals of themselves they
[13:19] cannot
[13:20] do it matter of fact it's already been
[13:22] broken by the holy spirit
[13:24] but can only be perceived by those who
[13:27] have already been given
[13:29] this seed germ of god
[13:33] or the master key in their soul
[13:36] to unlock the secrets of the word of god
[13:40] that you might ignore him in the power
[13:43] of his resurrection
[13:44] and in the fellowship of his sufferings
[13:49] and there came a bloody lamb
[13:52] and that lamb which we know the lamb
[13:56] was jesus christ a bloody bleeding lamb
[14:00] what fought a battle
[14:02] and ice preached on that how he went
[14:05] down in the hell and
[14:06] fought the great battle against
[14:09] satan and took away the keys of death
[14:12] hell and the grave
[14:14] amen and came up bringing captivity
[14:18] captives
[14:19] and giving back gifts unto men and
[14:22] coming
[14:23] back down in the form of the holy spirit
[14:26] to anoint his people and his children
[14:29] as they walk with him
[14:32] and in him so now here he comes
[14:38] he who has taken the book the seven
[14:41] sealed book is descending
[14:44] and he is descending as our kinsman
[14:49] redeemer to redeem us for the purpose of
[14:52] redemption
[14:54] the purpose to take his children out of
[14:57] here
[14:59] amen thank god for him
[15:02] as our great kinsman redeemer
[15:05] that will be another study but let's
[15:08] leave that now meaning that he is our
[15:12] brother he is our blood relations
[15:16] oh praise god descending to
[15:19] take us just take the study of the
[15:22] kinsmen redeemer
[15:23] and you'll know what i'm talking about
[15:26] those
[15:27] those believers who are aware of it
[15:29] rejoice in your soul
[15:31] your kinsmen redeemer has come is coming
[15:35] to redeem you through
[15:36] marriage by the invisible union
[15:39] hallelujah of this word of god
[15:42] and your soul that you might be born
[15:46] again
[15:47] truly born again not by the words of
[15:50] man not because you you're or you're
[15:52] crying because your old mother died
[15:55] or your old mother comes and say come to
[15:58] jesus and then you have a sentimental
[16:01] feeling no
[16:02] but you come with a clear understanding
[16:06] and
[16:06] revelation of why you must repent
[16:10] why you must be born again why must you
[16:13] must experience
[16:15] a supernatural awakening of this seed
[16:19] that god
[16:20] planted in you from before the
[16:23] foundation
[16:24] of the world oh glory to god our kinsman
[16:27] redeemer
[16:29] hallelujah is coming down
[16:32] and he's coming down my friends to
[16:36] claim his purchase possession
[16:39] because he has purchased us like uh
[16:43] like ruth was purchased hallelujah
[16:46] amen he's coming to purchase us
[16:49] by his precious blood not with silver
[16:52] and gold

[16:56] jesus christ
[16:57] come in to claim what is his

[17:04] many
[17:04] years you spent in the devil's pawn shop

[17:16] could pay the redemption price
[17:18] to take you out of that pawn shop with
[17:21] all those
[17:22] dead rotten things in there oh my
[17:26] god left you and allowed you to be in

[31:39] february 20th 1955

[33:12] seal was the revelation
[33:16] of the secret coming of the lord

[33:28] that in tucson arizona
[33:32] where this the wonderful
[33:36] marvelous picture
[33:39] of the cloud that i normally
[33:43] would wear if you will notice
[33:47] it is in the face of christ
[33:50] but white hair white clouds around him
[33:54] forming his face now you might look at
[33:58] that and think
[33:59] that was a beautiful artistic drawing of
[34:02] of
[34:02] of some man it was
[34:06] not it's the supernatural artistry
[34:10] and the supernatural representation of
[34:13] god representing revelation
[34:16] 1. standing
[34:20] there with the white here
[34:23] the supreme judge

[35:36] oh praise god june

[35:47] amen then he preached on the
[35:52] token amen praise god the token
[35:56] meaning christ himself here on the scene
[36:00] then he speaks on the indictment
[36:04] how you're going to indict somebody for
[36:07] this crucifixion in our day and in our
[36:11] time that they have crucified and are
[36:14] crucifying the word of god again
[36:17] in this day and in this hour from their
[36:20] pulpits not from god's hill but from
[36:23] their high and mighty puppets
[36:26] with the spear truss and the and the
[36:29] sword
[36:30] piercings by taking this very
[36:33] bible taking their their spears and
[36:36] criticizing
[36:37] calling it names piercing it everything
[36:40] else
[36:41] and then turn around and say oh i
[36:43] believe god and
[36:44] while the jews were saying we believe in
[36:47] messiah
[36:48] they were killing the very messiah on
[36:51] the cross
[36:52] while he was hanging there saying father
[36:54] forgive them
[36:55] for they know not what they do and here
[36:58] it is again
[37:01] these churches doing the same thing
[37:04] crucifying the word of god again calling
[37:08] it
[37:08] names calling it be elsa bob calling him
[37:12] that he didn't know who his father was
[37:14] in other words where did you get that
[37:16] from
[37:16] what is that oh my goodness gracious
[37:19] back to the bible search out these
[37:21] things whether they be of god or not
[37:24] they're in your book they're in your
[37:26] bible
[37:27] you've just got to search it hallelujah
[37:30] amen
[37:31] amen he's coming he's coming then all of
[37:34] a sudden he says a greater than solomon
[37:38] is here he's here so spiritually
[37:42] messiah is on earth now
[37:45] jesus is here his appearing
[37:49] in our midst by supernatural occurrences
[37:54] showing to you that his appearances
[37:58] is preparing us for his physical
[38:01] coming his personal coming again to take
[38:04] us out of
[38:06] here amen and he's here to call his
[38:10] children
[38:12] out of the dust of the earth
[38:16] by his spoken word for this hour
[38:20] and for this day bringing this
[38:23] bringing this and bringing us
[38:26] into the manifestation of the
[38:29] third pull or praise god
[38:33] like the first adam should have done
[38:36] using his spoken word
[38:39] to bring forth his child but instead
[38:44] god's program was temporarily
[38:47] derailed by the cunning fertility
[38:51] and intellectuality of the serpent
[38:55] in the garden which was not a snake
[38:58] at that time it was still uh the missing
[39:02] link that they are searching for
[39:04] as revealed by the servant and prophet
[39:06] of god
[39:07] this missing link is the serpent it
[39:10] stood up like a man it talked like a man
[39:12] it walk like a man it
[39:14] looked like a man the only thing it
[39:17] did not have is a soul because
[39:20] it was an animal it was an animal
[39:24] it is an animal between man and the
[39:28] rest of the animals and beasts
[39:32] and so he was able to contaminate
[39:36] the entire human race with his seed
[39:40] along with eve committing adultery
[39:43] amen contrary to the word of god
[39:46] bringing
[39:47] forth nothing but canaan uh a cane and
[39:50] canaanite business and all of that and
[39:52] leading into babel babylon and all the
[39:55] confusion
[39:56] and the nominations that we have here
[39:58] today
[39:59] oh my friends here it is
[40:02] in the word of the living god the
[40:05] gods program which he had
[40:08] in the beginning was upended
[40:13] amen god's program
[40:16] was thrown off kilter like this earth
[40:20] one day is going to be shocked into
[40:23] going off kilter and the weather
[40:26] patterns which are already
[40:28] changing and becoming extreme are going
[40:31] to get
[40:32] worse oh my friends it'll be like
[40:35] nothing you've ever seen
[40:37] before amen oh
[40:40] you said brother simon if god's program
[40:42] uh
[40:43] got off track how could it get back on
[40:46] track again
[40:47] and what part do we play in
[40:50] this amen praise god now
[40:54] genesis 1 god was creating
[40:59] but at the end of the sixth day
[41:03] after god had made adam and eve
[41:08] he stopped at that point
[41:12] with his program of creation
[41:15] and told them multiply
[41:19] and replenish the earth genesis 1
[41:23] 28 go out multiply
[41:27] and replenish the earth you see
[41:30] when god says that in the word we are
[41:32] thinking now
[41:34] humanly we are thinking now naturally
[41:38] down through the centuries how it's been
[41:41] handed down
[41:42] that they would produce children a
[41:45] certain
[41:46] way as we in our time
[41:49] and through the centuries have produced
[41:52] children
[41:53] that's the way we think god was speaking
[41:56] but you see my friends god wasn't
[42:00] speaking
[42:00] like that god was speaking to adam
[42:05] to do like i did i reproduce
[42:09] myself in you how by my spoken word
[42:14] speaking the two of you into existence
[42:18] molding and shaping you by the spoken
[42:22] word
[42:22] like us we are here in the word and the
[42:25] word of god is now
[42:26] molding and shaping us according to his
[42:29] spoken word
[42:31] amen hallelujah and so god made
[42:34] adam at that time with his
[42:37] bride in him amen adam's bride was
[42:41] already in him
[42:43] and so even so when jesus came his bride
[42:47] was in him praise god so
[42:51] eve was taken from adam's
[42:54] side and there less
[42:57] feminine feminist spirit
[43:00] was taken from adam and given
[43:03] its own body amen
[43:06] when it was taken from adam god did not
[43:10] pick up a separate piece of dirt
[43:12] but it took a part of adam to create eve
[43:16] which is a symbol that the true church
[43:19] will not be something created by man or
[43:22] manhandled but it will be a part of the
[43:26] original christ the original anointed
[43:29] word is what would make up the bride
[43:33] or the wife of jesus christ he took a
[43:37] part of adam to make eve
[43:39] god takes a part of his word to make
[43:42] the bride or to create the bride
[43:45] praise be to god he took the feminist
[43:48] spirit out of adam
[43:51] and place it in this
[43:55] wife this body now called eve
[43:59] so praise god that's why man
[44:03] shouldn't have any of that feminist
[44:05] spirit
[44:06] and women should not have any of that
[44:10] manish male spirit that
[44:13] kind of aggressive uh spirit that's in a
[44:17] man
[44:18] amen i'm not talking about being overly
[44:20] aggressive i'm not talking
[44:22] about there's just the spirit and action
[44:25] and attitude of a man
[44:26] he doesn't have to do anything for it to
[44:29] make itself manifest
[44:30] or ex he just stands there and he is a
[44:33] man
[44:34] she stands there and she is a woman
[44:36] because
[44:37] the spirit that god placed there one is
[44:40] feminist
[44:41] and one is man
[44:44] amen and so god took the feminist out of
[44:47] the man
[44:48] placed it there in its own
[44:51] body amen and so praise god
[44:56] hallelujah god
[44:59] was showing them the secret of
[45:02] of reproduction how
[45:06] he multiplied himself in the form of
[45:10] adam and eve
[45:11] by his spoken word and now there
[45:14] were supposed to go out and do
[45:18] the same by adam's spoken word
[45:22] just like how god gives us his word
[45:25] we as his bride church take his word
[45:30] and we speak it to be able to
[45:33] call and create call from the dust of
[45:36] the earth
[45:36] and create other sons and daughters of
[45:40] god
[45:41] so adam should have spoken
[45:44] his word of what he wanted son
[45:47] daughter to eve and then eve
[45:51] would take adam's word first adam's word
[45:55] like we are taking
[45:56] second adam's word and speak it and
[46:00] it would create or call that
[46:03] son or that daughter into existence
[46:07] by the power of god's eternal word
[46:11] or hallelujah amen amen
[46:15] praise god i thank god my brother
[46:18] sister that eve came from god
[46:22] splitting adam
[46:25] you know men thought it was a great
[46:27] discovery
[46:28] when they were able to split the atom
[46:31] atom but it was a greater
[46:34] thing when god split adam
[46:37] amen and made man and woman male
[46:41] and female praise god created he
[46:44] them all praises marvelous name and here
[46:48] we
[46:48] are at the pentecost there was a dunamis
[46:52] an explosion a spiritual
[46:54] explosion why god was creating a bride
[46:59] amen because the first one fell in the
[47:02] garden
[47:02] amen oh my god and here he was creating
[47:06] another one
[47:07] oh my lord hallelujah that she might
[47:10] stand by his word
[47:12] she must carry out his word speak his
[47:14] word and give glory
[47:16] to his marvelous name amen amen
[47:20] there were one in person
[47:24] and when there were one in person
[47:28] in adam because remember at one time eve
[47:31] was in adam and when you looked you saw
[47:35] only
[47:35] adam because she was in him she was
[47:38] there already
[47:39] but she was in him amen but when you
[47:43] looked
[47:43] you only saw adam
[47:47] and they were core equal
[47:51] core equal together
[47:55] there of one name of one accord because
[47:59] there were one
[48:01] amen and the bible tells us in genesis 5
[48:04] 1 to 2
[48:06] and their name was called
[48:09] adam their name was called
[48:13] adam she was not called eve or named eve
[48:17] until after the sin in the garden
[48:21] amen oh think of it
[48:25] and so uh when she was called eve
[48:29] it was not even god that called her eve
[48:31] it was
[48:32] adam called her eve which means mother
[48:36] of all living amen
[48:39] he didn't say mother uh that she
[48:43] was that he was the father or she
[48:46] was the mother of his sons both his sons
[48:50] but there it goes praise the lord amen
[48:53] mother of all living praise god and so
[48:56] my friends
[48:58] at that time there were still living
[49:02] in god's eternal day
[49:08] they were still in an eternal day
[49:11] amen but remember time
[49:16] had not yet begun
[49:20] it was not being yet counted
[49:23] and recognized there was still
[49:26] living in an eternal day
[49:31] but when they sinned of course they
[49:34] fell they fell from that eternal day
[49:41] into time and time began
[49:47] and once time begins aging
[49:50] begins if there was no time
[49:54] then nobody could count any age and we
[49:56] would be ageless
[49:58] we will be going on and on and on but no
[50:01] age
[50:02] but the moment time began aging began
[50:07] sickness sin began all manner of things
[50:11] begin and you know aging leads
[50:15] to death amen
[50:18] because what happened they cross the
[50:21] line
[50:23] they cross from eternity over
[50:26] in the time and the timeline
[50:31] between the two realms was broken
[50:35] their oneness with god was broken
[50:41] adam lost his life
[50:45] spiritually speaking he became lost
[50:49] he lost his life and i've said this
[50:53] before i'll say it again
[50:54] then he lost his wife
[50:59] and she then was not
[51:02] counted cro equal with him anymore
[51:08] he lost his spiritual inheritance
[51:12] of having dominion over all
[51:15] the entire earth
[51:18] and that's when they
[51:23] both had separate names
[51:27] after sin after
[51:30] the fall after time began
[51:34] then they both had different names
[51:37] now you have adam and you have
[51:41] eve oh my think about it
[51:46] amen you'll find my friends genesis
[51:50] 3 20 it was not god that named eve but
[51:53] adam that named her eve
[51:57] now praise god thank god anyway i praise
[52:00] god and thank god for my fifth
[52:02] rib i thank god for my precious wife
[52:06] amen praise god because that
[52:09] fifth rib i understand protects your
[52:12] heart
[52:12] and oh glory to god a real wonderful
[52:16] precious wife a wonderful wife
[52:19] always wants to be protective of her
[52:23] husband
[52:24] and she wants to always defend him
[52:27] and that rib just lays across that heart
[52:30] and protects it lord of god hallelujah
[52:33] god give us women like that god give us
[52:36] wives like that
[52:37] god give us laws that will go back to

[53:15] i just don't want to go off in different
[53:17] directions i'm seeing so many things
[53:20] while i'm speaking on it so let me just
[53:22] stay
[53:23] clear on the path that i am right now
[53:27] praise god
[53:28] hallelujah now
[53:31] adam was given eve
[53:35] to reproduce himself
[53:41] and that's what a man is given a bride
[53:44] for or has a bride for
[53:46] esto reproduce himself
[53:52] the second adam who is jesus christ
[53:55] also was given a bribe
[53:58] which we know the church the true church
[54:02] the revelated church the one who
[54:06] obeys his word listen to his word

[54:54] almighty god
[54:55] because she is the one he's coming for
[54:57] oh glory to god

[55:13] so praise god jesus christ
[55:17] himself was a spoken word
[55:20] seed sun just like
[55:23] the first adam was
[55:27] see adam was created
[55:31] and placed on the earth by god's spoken
[55:34] word
[55:36] and never passed through a woman
[55:39] but because of sin to redeem us
[55:42] back jesus god
[55:46] made himself into flesh
[55:50] called the begotten son begotten because
[55:53] it had to
[55:54] pass through the woman called mary
[55:58] amen that is why the bible speaks to us
[56:02] in another place that this is the
[56:04] beginning of the creation
[56:06] of god not that this supernatural spirit
[56:10] of god can be created
[56:12] but it's talking about that body that
[56:15] was created amen
[56:18] hallelujah and so that is how
[56:22] he came on the scene
[56:26] when adam's bride was in him they were
[56:29] called adam
[56:32] and when jesus bride is in him and when
[56:35] we are
[56:36] in him we are called christian
[56:40] we are called his name mrs jesus christ
[56:45] hallelujah lord of god amen
[56:49] what are we here for we are here
[56:53] to live lives to be the bride of christ
[56:58] so that he the word
[57:01] will be able to reproduce himself
[57:05] through astro testimony
[57:08] through the blood of the lamb amen
[57:12] and the word of our testimony
[57:15] he will be able to reproduce himself
[57:19] oh thank god he's reproducing himself
[57:22] thank god he's manifesting himself
[57:24] thank god is the same yesterday today
[57:27] and forever
[57:28] a god who cannot change who cannot lie
[57:31] a god who is omnipotent on the present
[57:34] the almighty the mighty god in christ
[57:38] amen hallelujah amen yes sir
[57:42] praise god hallelujah because
[57:45] he's the spoken word seed son
[57:50] and she came from him then she has to be
[57:54] a spoken word seed
[57:56] virgin bride amen
[57:59] by the word of god but the word has
[58:03] wiped out everything from her life
[58:06] and brought her to a place of spiritual
[58:10] virginal purity by the word of god that
[58:14] was quickened to her
[58:16] glory god hallelujah
[58:20] amen oh praise god
[58:24] hallelujah brother sister uh
[58:27] this thought is now going into a another
[58:30] little direction here
[58:32] and i'd like for us to pause at this
[58:35] point in time
[58:37] ah i'll just want you to salivate
[58:41] over the seven course meal that the lord
[58:45] is enabling me to place before you
[58:48] the next course is yet to come
[58:52] let's wait for the next course next
[58:55] sunday
[58:57] and hear what the word of god will be to
[59:00] say to us
[59:01] but for what you've heard here today
[59:04] let us go out and reproduce let us go
[59:08] out and multiply ourselves
[59:10] and when i say that i'm not speaking
[59:12] about physically
[59:13] i'm speaking spiritually i'm speaking
[59:16] about
[59:16] winning others to christ and i don't
[59:19] mean
[59:20] wrestling them to the ground arguing
[59:23] with them over scripture
[59:24] lassoing them you know i'm branding them
[59:28] with a church brand
[59:30] or a church name on there on their hide
[59:33] no sir that's not what we're here for we
[59:36] are
[59:36] not here to persuade we are not here
[59:40] to convince anybody we are here only to
[59:44] share and if there is any seed life
[59:50] hiding behind that skin
[59:53] then the seed of god
[59:56] that was planted there before the
[59:59] foundation of the world
[1:00:02] because like he said to jeremiah
[1:00:04] jeremiah i knew you before you was even
[1:00:07] in your mother's belly i know you
[1:00:09] because you first of all jeremiah was in
[1:00:11] him
[1:00:12] and then he placed him where he was to
[1:00:14] be born through a certain mother certain
[1:00:16] father
[1:00:17] just like with us so we are here now
[1:00:20] and now my brother sister he has to
[1:00:24] allow
[1:00:25] the word of god to be spoken to bring us
[1:00:28] to life again to spiritual resurrection
[1:00:32] by the spoken word of god to recognize
[1:00:36] that you are not just a church member
[1:00:38] you're not supposed to be just a church
[1:00:39] member
[1:00:40] you're a son of god you say oh but i'm a
[1:00:43] servant of god
[1:00:44] we are not just servants of god we are
[1:00:47] sons and daughters of god and because we
[1:00:50] are
[1:00:51] sons and daughters of god we want to
[1:00:54] serve god
[1:00:55] oh praise god but we are not here
[1:00:59] as just servants of god we are
[1:01:02] called to be sons daughters
[1:01:06] children of the most high and paul as
[1:01:09] the as the book of acts tells us
[1:01:11] for we know amen that god has made
[1:01:17] of all men of one blood
[1:01:21] and they are the offsprings or children
[1:01:25] of the almighty praise god so skin
[1:01:29] color tone whatever makes no difference
[1:01:32] who you are
[1:01:33] where you are king commoner prince
[1:01:36] popper
[1:01:37] down in the ditcher up there in
[1:01:40] in the ghetto or up in the palace
[1:01:43] doesn't make any difference
[1:01:45] praise god it's what's behind your
[1:01:48] skin what god place in you
[1:01:51] that seed that germ life that god placed
[1:01:54] there when it hears
[1:01:56] this word amen and i'm confident of it
[1:01:59] that this is the word of god for this
[1:02:02] hour
[1:02:02] whoever it is when they hear this word
[1:02:05] it wakes up
[1:02:06] something in you you come awake and you
[1:02:10] begin to realize who you are
[1:02:14] that i'm not just a creature of time
[1:02:18] i come from eternity and i'm going back
[1:02:21] to eternity
[1:02:22] i come from god and i'm going back to
[1:02:25] god
[1:02:26] hallelujah i'm just doing time
[1:02:29] i'm just passing through time and i've
[1:02:32] come from eternity
[1:02:33] i'm passing through time and i'm going
[1:02:36] back to eternity back to god
[1:02:38] that's what jesus was saying when he
[1:02:41] said i
[1:02:42] come from god and i go to god
[1:02:45] i come from being god and i'm going back
[1:02:48] to being god
[1:02:49] in the presence hallelujah and i'm going
[1:02:52] back to manifesting myself that way
[1:02:55] and here we are we come from god and
[1:02:57] we're going
[1:02:58] back to god and in god we're going
[1:03:02] right back where we come from as the
[1:03:04] rivers
