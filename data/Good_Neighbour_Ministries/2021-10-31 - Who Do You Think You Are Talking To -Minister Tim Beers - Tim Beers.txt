couple years uh since i've been up here but lord knows what he's doing i thought me and brother danny were talking there through kova and we said man did we preach our last message is this thing over amen but you know what i guess we've got a few more to preach amen but let me tell you it's getting close to the end amen hallelujah amen uh oh my there's so much to say this morning and um we just thank god for uh the opportunity to be here to be in front of you again uh just watching the lord jesus christ move in our lives i don't know about you right but in the last couple years god has done so many great things amen the devil can't lock us down amen the devil can't lock the spirit down he can't lock us up he can't stop the spirit of revelation to come upon a true child of god amen hallelujah amen because we live in a different realm amen we don't live in this dimension this flesh lives in this dimension but we live in a different realm that's when jesus said the son of man that you see standing here is also in heaven at the same time amen and that's where we are this morning i believe in heavenly places in christ amen we got the 40 days of prayer amen it's a it's a program but let me tell you the bride of jesus christ is on a different level different class amen amen she's she's been caught up by the revelation of this hour amen so the 40 days of prayer is a rock that we're throwing up but the way the bride sees it and the way the world sees it is two different things amen and god is stirring our hearts to pray i know our hearts and our my home is being stirred to pray more and more amen because you know what prayer is to the bride of jesus christ it's the spoken word amen and she must what prophesy amen that's why god's stirring our hearts to prophesy he wants to move through his spirit within us amen he wants to bring this how's this going to come to an end how's this rapture going to come to an end and a completion it's here it's you the kingdom of god is here now within us amen oh glory to god let us turn to our scriptures amen let's go to slide two amen glory to god let's see what the lord has for us this morning amen don't be in a rush this morning this is the lord's day i've been waiting two years to get up here so at least give me until my one o'clock amen hallelujah glory to god amen philippians 3 10. i think you have it up there yes amen then we're going to go to psalms 34 7. we want to take the part 3 there of this uh series who do you think you are talking to or do you know who you're talking to oh my if you catch a revelation which i believe most of you have this morning if not may god give you a revelation of who he is amen and who you are really talking to when you go in to prayer amen that ye that i may know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death amen that we may know him paul's talking i may know him in the power of his resurrection in the sufferings amen that's what we want amen we don't want our own lives we want his life experience his life amen psalms 34 7 and the angel of the lord encamped around them that fear him oh glory to god i believe the angels of god are encamped this morning amen and delivereth them oh taste and see that the lord is good amen the lord is good you're going to see this morning there is no evil there is no bad god can't be nothing but good and he hasn't been anything in our lives but good yes so you're praying to a good god amen hallelujah blessed is the man that trusts it in him father we thank you for your love grace and mercy lord let your anointing continue to flow we know it's not man lord but it's your spirit we know that you're here you might be invisible but you have come down the only way that the bride of jesus christ can be one with you is you had to come you had to come in your fullness we see that the word was restored the letter form was restored all the loose ends all the truths were tied up lord and that gave you that open door this step just like you stepped into a body like in melchizedek you stepped into a body you stepped into the word that was restored and all the truths in this day lord and as we have received it father the attribute has woken up and come alive we're born again by your spirit father now men and god are becoming one in the same again that we can say just like you said when you were on here on earth i and my father are one and the same oh god hallelujah thank you father bless us this morning take every spirit under subjection to the holy ghost father bind every power of satan lord in the name of jesus christ we pray father that your word might have preeminence in the hearts of your people father that they may receive it this morning not what i have to say but what their still small voice will have to say in jesus name we pray amen god bless you as you seen it oh hallelujah got to control that anointing or else i'm not going to have any voice amen but praise god what a blessed thing to lose your voice under the anointing of the spirit of god amen hallelujah it's a battle to get up here it's a battle and a fight in prayer but once you're up here amen the liberty of the lord where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty amen may you have liberty this morning in his spirit amen hallelujah glory to god amen the bible says there wasn't much to look upon him no beauty should we desire of him but when he throw back those little shoulders and said lazarus come forth a man that has been dead four days and rotten in the grave he came forth that was more than a man we're praying more than a man this morning amen more than just a prophet amen hallelujah show me any man that can do that amen they might be praying to all different gods out there all different idols out there but they're not praying to the person i'm praying to amen and i'm praying to the person not up in the sky i'm praying to the person with inside of me that's who jesus was praying not to another god but to the father that was inside of him amen oh god amen he broke the powers of satan he opened the prison doors of hell to every man that was shut up in this earth in the prisons fearing that when they he died what death would bring to him on calvary he opened those cell doors and let every captive go free you don't have to no longer be torn down by sin now listen you don't have to no longer yield your members your flesh your thoughts your mind to sin to unbelief drinking smoking gambling telling lies being dishonest but you now can walk uprightly amen we can walk uprightly we can walk in victory we can walk in overcoming power because of him so when we pray this is what we're praying amen overcoming power is given to us victory is given to us everything is given to us but if you don't know who you're praying to if you don't know doesn't the bible say for a lack of knowledge a lack of knowing god a lack of knowing the promises my people perish it's no in him it's knowing what god has given us it's knowing what he has done for us it puts you in a different element when you go into prayer you're not praying by emotions you're not praying by feelings amen you're not praying by your own thoughts and we're still moving in that room and praying in those our feelings and our emotions are not part of it it has nothing to do with it when you get down to pray you take that word of god you take what he has done for you you take the cross amen you take the promises and you go forth in every situation and circumstance amen and you speak that word you speak that word that's what it's about it's not about us my brothers and sisters it's not about how much you can cry how much you can get emotional amen is about looking to the word and the promises amen that's what's going to bring it to pass sometimes we think i'm talking about prayer this morning knowing him sometimes we think we can just cry to the lord with our emotions and our feelings let me tell you brothers and sisters the bride is reason to such a level of discernment they she can tell if you're talking to god when brother bradley walked into the room with that little uh woman there that's reminding a woman she started praying he said i know she talks to god oh i know she talks with him every night i know she's at his feet i know she knows him oh my that's what i want to talk to god in that way amen amen glory to god we're set free not under fear of death no no no longer fear of death anymore you know that's another thing we pray under fear amen we go into prayer and we go into prayer to god because we want to we want to release our fears there is no more fear amen he took fear he took the fear even of death not just circumstances in your life all financial problems health problems i know what health problems are my brothers and sisters i've been through them enough in the last six months i'm standing up here by the grace of god amen they want to operate on my back and my in my spine and put uh plates and everything in there amen i'm standing here because i know what it is amen about these situations but that's not that's that's not what god amen wants us to focus on and look at amen he wants me to look at his word look at his promises amen how am i going to receive faith for healing how am i going to receive faith for deliverance when i'm looking at all the circumstances when i'm approaching god in prayer by fear fear of these things i gotta approach him by faith i gotta look to the word look to the promises look what he said look what he's done for me listen calvary means everything to me everything until you get to a place where calvary means everything that calvary is your life and you're never going to meet god you're never going to know him like paul wanted to know him in the power of his resurrection amen hallelujah our relationship or revelation of the person determines how we talk to somebody what you know about somebody determines your conversation true now the same is true with god your understanding of what god really is shapes you shapes everything about you in your life including your prayer life nothing influences your life more than how you view god oh my i mean i i can i can just be uh gullible and think that everybody views god the way i view god but listen if you go through this morning here if god would come down and reveal how each and every one of us view god i bet you there would be different views this morning but your view of god amen determines your relationship with him how you see him too many people are relating this world this flesh your problems your circumstances your heartaches and your pains your viewing those things as god but let me tell you god is good and god is good all the time and god can be nothing but good that's who god is oh my amen now lots of people have misconceptions about god i believe that i believe that because i've been there as i grow in faith and i as i grow to know him i realize a lot of conceptions i had of god amen oh my realizing that wasn't never god speaking to me all these negative thoughts oh you're not saved you're not born again you're not going to make that you're not going to make it into heaven you're not going to make the rapture amen every one of us have to go through those stages i don't know where you are this morning amen but that can view satan can put that in your mind and that can that can that can form a view of god to you that god is speaking all these lies to you amen let me tell you one thing until you get those lies out of your head you cannot enter in you cannot seek god the way he wants and he cannot reveal himself through that you gotta that's why paul says i have to die daily die out to everything die out to your fears die out to your thoughts die out to all the insecurities that you have in your life you gotta die out to all that stuff you got to let it go you know i came to a place you know i came to a place where i used to tell satan when he used to come to me and speak all kinds of unbelief to me i say you know what satan i know i don't deserve heaven i know i deserve hell you know what and i believe there's still too many people think you deserve heaven let me tell you this morning you're going to heaven by the grace of god but you don't deserve it he deserves it he gave it to us amen that's the only way i deserve it the only way i deserve the blessings of god and god to come into my life and keep me every day he just didn't he just didn't save me back there 30 years ago and gave me the new the new birth he keeps me every day every day the battle gets tougher and stronger people are falling away by the minute people are falling away in their minds in their hearts amen they're leaving god by the minute but here i am this morning by the grace of god hear you this morning by the grace of god seeking amen thirsting and hungering for the living god because of his grace amen oh my hallelujah amen let me read some people think god is angry upset at them all the time never can please them you ever think that way you can never please god because you're looking at your failures you're looking at your backsliding he changes his mind continually about you you ever you ever go through that this is just common sense here amen down to earth basics amen that's what brother branham said he said god in simplicity your abc's amen we got the message of the hour we got the highest form of truth and revelation of this hour amen that you can ever break into amen but if you don't get past this you ain't going there hallelujah some people i look at him as a dictator god demanding more and more and more it's never enough oh what condemnation to be under satan puts you under all of these things not god god never put you under any of these any of these demands any of these controls is satan know your enemy know that you're in a battle too many people are crying and and crying and crying not realizing it's the devil and you've got the name of jesus christ you've got faith in your heart to cast them out but it takes prayer it takes time and prayer sometimes the bible says some only come up by fasting and pray those days are not over my brothers and sisters they're still here hallelujah amen and some view god as santa claus he's making a list he's checking it twice he's seeing if you're naughty or nice it's funny but it's true oh yeah i tell you you don't wanna you won't admit it but a lot of yous fall in this category the way you view god the way you think amen you got to change your thinking because that's the devil thinking not god god has nothing to do with that kind of thinking there are many characteristics of god well let us look this morning at the goodness of god because it's his goodness it's the goodness of god that is is the base of all our prayers if god is not good a good god you have zero reason to pray and zero motivation to pray is that the truth amen if you don't go into prayer knowing god is good amen whatever you're gonna ask him you're going to ask him by what emotion are by feelings no by faith faith in his word that god is good to honor his word amen god will back up his word when i go into prayer i know god is going to back up his word when i ask anything according to his will i don't got selfless mortals i don't think of my own life i don't think of my own agenda i think of god's agenda and when you think of god's agenda first and you go into prayer with that kind of attitude watch what happens jesus only prayed to the father he only prayed god's will be done father not my will but thy will be done thy will be done not my will even jesus himself prayed that way how much more us oh dying out my brothers and sisters to this flesh oh my you got to crucify this flesh amen oh my you don't want to die but everybody wants to go to heaven let me tell you you know we're going to die before we get to heaven we're dying now amen hallelujah now there's only only reason there's any good in the world is because god is good amen that's the only reason god and god is the creator of all goodness in all of this universe let me tell you something you can't spell good without god yes sir you can't spell good without god because good is god oh my brother tim why are you hitting this on this constantly because you need to know that god is good all the time every situation in your life no matter what it looks like even to the brink of death even on your deathbed god is good oh my woo jesus hallelujah if there's no god there is no good there is no right there is no wrong there is no good there is no bad there is nothing without god my god stands alone amen this word of this hour stands alone nothing compares to this word because this word is god himself this word that i'm believing this word that i'm allowed to take over my life that i'm surrendering to my life to this word is god himself amen oh my lord jesus now because god is always good i want you to understand these because when you understand how good god really is you're going to enjoy prayer oh my how many of us enjoy pray enjoy praying when it becomes a joy to pray oh my amen brother desmond brother desmond goes into prayer he enjoys it when a challenge of sickness comes before him it's been manifested you can't help god who believes the word signs and wonders follow them he goes into prayer knowing god amen it's not going to fail him because he's not going by his own feelings he's not going by his own emotions he's not going by what he thinks or what power or what or he's a healer or anything he's god knowing god amen knowing that god stands behind his word knowing that all his motive intention is for god and he knows god is good amen when you look at somebody sick you can't look at them and look and see their sin you can't look at them and see their mistakes amen god never looks through those eyes he looks and sees good amen amen he looks through the blood of jesus christ who am i who are you who are we to condem any one of us to look at any one of our faults i got faults i got mistakes i don't know how much is going to fall off before i leave this earth i got them but when you look at them look at them through the blood because if you don't and you say brother tim this brother tim that you're saying to the blood of jesus christ i say that by faith i believe that by faith so when i look at you i look it through the blood of jesus christ amen hallelujah glory to god it's not a duty it's a delight anytime prayer becomes a ritual boring to you it's because you don't understand or know how good god is people say well i just don't love god enough no that's not your problem your problem is you don't understand how much god loves you amen i don't love god enough no no you're putting on yourself your own works it's not about you whether your works are good or not it's his love when you look at calvary what do you see you see any part of you and calvary and what he did it's him it's how much he loves you he did that not how much you love yourself people say oh you've got to love yourself on the internet you got to love yourself you better love yourself let me tell you all i need to know is that god loves me that's all i need to know he loves me that brings all the confidence breaks all the complexes all the depression off of me i don't need no therapy out there i don't need no counsel out there i got my counselor i got my prince of peace i got my deliverer that's who i go into prayer for and with wow thank you we understanding prayer a little bit more through these series as we all preach the gospel well you just don't love god enough no that's not the thing god loves you everything in your life is a gift of god's goodness your existence here this morning is a gift of god you know that the sinners that walking on the street that will never know god never called the god because we know there's seed of god in the serpent seed amen still the truth i don't know if you believe it or not still but i believe it amen still the truth we're living in a world that's that's closing in satan's eating and trying to compress the people's minds trying to take truth away from you listen this message is the truth believe it exactly the way it is amen but even the grace of god amen gives them life out there amen hallelujah amen let us go to slide four slide four god's plans for my life will always be good god's plans for my life will always be good because god is always good people say there isn't anything anything god can't do there's a lot of things god can't do he can't deny himself he can't be evil god is good so by nature he cannot be evil he cannot be bad everything god does is good and so because god is good god's plans for my life will always be good what god does for me will always be good no matter what i go through it will be good my back my shoulders my health my heart it's good everything is good [Music] if i leave this world it's good i don't know about you but it's good to me i'll stay as long as he wants me to stay because i want to hear him say well done good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the lord so whatever he has me to say if i have to preach another message but let me tell you i always come up here preaching like it's my last because i have a revelation of that i ain't holding back my brothers and sisters amen i don't know if i got tomorrow but let me tell you if i don't it's good it's good [Applause] no fear here no no no no scripture says in jeremiah 29 for i know the thoughts that i think towards you sayeth the lord thoughts of peace not of evil to give you an expected end that means a blessed prosperous sin a good end whether it's by rapture or by sleep it's good oh it's blessed amen live your life and be free my brothers and sisters amen satan binds us so much to live in fear down here the fear of death was the greatest enemy that that jesus came to destroy and people are still under that fear of death when you walk free of that fear you experience totally different things they think they experience things out there when they when they meditate and or they get set free from certain habits or whatever they're on the mountain you see them they're expressing they break through certain things but my god they can't break fear they can't break through the fear of death the fear of being lost but only the bride of jesus christ by the word when you break free of that oh my you're living a totally different life amen then shall you call upon me and ye shall go and pray listen pray unto me and i will hearken unto you that's my word again and when you call to me and you pray i will listen you see the connection between purpose and prayer between god's plan for your life and prayer if you're if you're catching the letter then you're going to get bored very soon but if you're in the spirit and god you're walking with god every day you're walking in the spirit you know him this is just enriching you your relationship with him your purpose in life is going to encourage you to walk outside these doors that's what he meant to me he says lord let me walk out of these doors differently when i came in let me walk out more encouraged oh my more knowing who i am and who you are and my purpose in life that when i pray you'll hear me hallelujah oh my you may not know god as well as you think for he is far above us in the heavens far above the earth the bible says his greatness is unsearchable psalms 145 3 his judgments are unsearchable romans 11 33 his riches are unsearchable ephesians 3 8 nevertheless he is notable you could know him according to the bible he has revealed aspects of himself both in nature and in the word and we can know him who is unsearchable oh my what an honor and what a privilege we have to be in this position we call it the position in christ your position in christ but to be in this position to know the true and living god what is it going to be my brothers and sisters people who are sitting under this word of this hour i can say under this anointed ministry that god has given us here a man of god amen what is it going to be on that day when you realize you didn't search for him you didn't seek for him did he not say seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open doesn't the bible say you haven't strived under blood you haven't strived you haven't pressed your way in to the kingdom my brothers and sisters it's not time to get lukewarm lazy in lack and allow satan to come into the church and make it powerless formal amen it's time to shake ourselves it's time to release ourselves from the influence of the world and what's going on out there get our minds off of that and get our minds up back on the promise no matter how it changes out there my brothers and sisters god's word has never changed god's purpose for the bride of jesus christ and what he's doing in her life has never changed and people are drifting away from that not realizing it i don't want to stay here i don't know about you i don't want to stay here this is not my home we sing the song this world is not my home i'm just passing through my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue the angels are backing me from heaven's open door door and i can't feel at home i can't feel at home i can't feel at home in this world anymore is that where you are well let's get praying church let's get praying let's get speaking let's get dying out let's get this thing moving let's get this motivation of the word of god going oh my oh lord jesus according to the bible our god is the everlasting father the god of hosts the lord of heaven and earth the author and finisher of our faith he is the comforter he is the counselor he is the creator he is the great physician he is the god of all grace he is the i am the alpha and the omega the holy one of israel we call him jehovah the most high the lord of the living the lord of the dead he makes he is the maker of he's the maker he's the mediator he's the man of sorrow he's our prophet priest king he's our redeemer our refuge our rock he's our ruler of heaven and earth he's the friend of sinners he is everything to us what is left out my brothers and sisters in your walk in your life what hasn't he done what hasn't he provided for you to make him everything in your life why haven't you made him everything in your life why haven't you surrendered everything to him is there any more you can get out there is there any more better more secure than him than jesus christ if not then why haven't we surrendered everything to him hallelujah jesus trying to comprehend the person of god is like trying to capture all the galaxies of the universe in a child's mind yet the bible encourages us to try to seek to know the desires to be worshipped and worship him as he reveals himself in his creation and his word psalms 37 3 says trust in the lord and do good dwell in the land and feed on his faithfulness feed on his faithfulness oh my what does it mean to feed on his faithfulness it means the feed on his goodness feed on his mercy my brothers and sisters feed on his power feed on his presence feed on his promises feed on his love feed on his endless infinite attributes and qualities it means to feed on jesus the bread of life feed on him we've been given everything that we possibly can be given to feed on him oh my slide five only got ten slides so we're moving pretty good here we're moving pretty good i know you got the mask on there and kind of you don't want to say amen and that stuff but say it anyways i hear brother danny i hear brother desmond they got masks on praise god my brothers and sisters it's not because of brother tim it's not because of who's sitting beside you you realize the invisible one the creators of heaven and earth is here do you realize that there's angels in camp do you feel something brushed by you if you're in the spirit brushing by you the holy spirit moving listen where he wants to go moving how he wants to move oh my brothers when you when you when you call upon him when you seek him he comes amen hallelujah it's not just in the days of brother branham where they had those meetings amen the room got so cloudy with faith amen because people are seeking god amen people were seeking god so much back then now you know what they're seeking god for not necessarily the revelation of the word to to become one with him to allow that word to manifest in their lives and become one with their flesh they were seeking god back then and they had that kind of faith to move on the spirit of god for healing in their body how much more today how much more should we be seeking god and wanted his presence to move i've been there brothers and sisters you might be here this morning in sitting in the pew and just bored or sitting in the pew saying oh i you know i wish this would get over or whatever thoughts that you're thinking amen not having a desire to know god looking at the time when's the service going to be over when's he going to stop preaching when he's going to stop doing this not recognizing that you're missing the greatest opportunity that man has ever got amen to come into his presence and to know him and to know him and for him to come to you and reveal himself to you that's why we come this morning not because of a building we can lose that at any time any time in the future we can lose this we know it's prophecy and it's going to come to pass it doesn't matter where i am in a basement on the street amen his presence is the same no matter where i go because i seek him slide five we're there now listen my brothers and sisters the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and it's expose satan revealing his works attempt destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word but let me tell you one thing my brothers and sisters the bride of jesus christ he ain't going to let that happen if you're the bride of jesus christ you ain't going to let that happen because something which is the holy ghost which is christ himself amen is going to rise up inside of you the bible says and the bible is the word and the word is god says amen when the enemy will come in as a flood in my life my god is going to raise the standard why because he's good he's going to raise the standard he's going to make his word more real to me so i can live above that battle that i'm going through so when i get down in prayer and i'm in a battle and satan is trying to make me lukewarm and powerless i get down in prayer and i said my god you said amen that you're going to raise a standard that that that word is going to become more real to me and that's what i'm expecting in my life whoa hallelujah amen you see right down to the time he's cast in a lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get a true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and what she can do the greater works she will be invisible and that's what satan's fighting this morning he fights you every single time some of you have not broken through yet some of you have not passed through certain barriers some of you are living comfortable amen comfortable lives and you're happy in it amen you haven't broken through this yet and until you break through this until you overcome you see because when you get a true revelation of who you are what the church is who god is in your life personally then you're going to defeat satan and his powers she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits working in the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern withstand the antichrist satan will be powerless before her is anybody listening to me he will be defeated today today today as he was when christ stood his ever is every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against it but we but we will prevail over them [Music] that's why we go into prayer amen prayer is not a tradition prayer is not what the church has made it to be prayer to the bride of jesus christ is going and speaking the promises in the word prayer is her weapon amen in battle it's her sword the sword of the spirit the word of god coming through her mouth oh my oh my ephesians 1 17 that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him paul's speaking here that's what we need my brothers and sisters that's what we should be seeking for the spirit of wisdom and revelation and of knowledge of him that the eyes of your understanding may be enlightened that ye may know here's that word again know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance is in the saints what is our inheritance what is our inheritance abraham's faith seed faith is our inheritance well my brothers and sisters these people that you know uh rick warren and and 40 days of purpose they got faith out there they got faith out there we're we're not feeding off of that faith we got perfect faith there's difference here if you just got faith this morning because you're religious and you're you're reading all kinds of quotes from this person that person whatever and you're just religious then you've got faith yeah you might have faith but listen i'm talking about something totally different here i'm not talking about rick warren's faith i'm talking about perfect faith because that's all that's the only thing i can feed off of i don't know about you i can only feed off perfect faith and the perfect god in the perfect word of this hour amen hallelujah nothing compares to getting to know god who knows us he seeks to be known he reveals himself in nature and scriptures through our minds he comprehends all there is of god our souls find rest in him whenever around us fails he will never falter when foundations tremble he's changeless immovable eternal in the heavens when our hearts are overwhelmed he is the rock that is higher than we we must be still and know that he is god psalms 46 10 blessed be the god and father who blesses us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places amen hallelujah slide six friends we live in a broken planet everything on this planet is broken nothing perfect nothing works perfectly your body's broken have you noticed that yup yup i noticed that yep it doesn't always work the right way you're right your mind is broken it always doesn't think the right way but you know what that is the truth my brothers and sisters we know we got a carnal mind we know we got a flesh we know it's sinful we know there's no perfection in it but let me tell you something hallelujah there's a soul there's an attribute inside of here amen that is growing and it's growing you know what it's doing you know what you know what the caterpillar you know when it when it's walking around and it becomes a butterfly you know what it's doing from the inside out is changing amen and it's gonna have to put off that shell amen one day this body this mind is not going to take the capacity of the word of god that is growing inside of me the faith that is raising up in me and who i am and who he is wasn't that like he knocking the rapture enoch come home you know too much you're too high you can't be here on this this imperfect world with the revelation and the purity and the knowledge that you have of me and who you are and your purpose that i sent you here for oh my it's growing inside of me every day i come to church something is growing inside of me listen my brothers and sisters if you haven't recognized let me tell you this is the hour amen this is the hour you need to recognize that that has happened inside of you you need to recognize that you're born again amen that the spirit of god has started to work in you and you see him working and you know he's going to finish that work oh my glory to god amen the weather's broken the economy is broken relationships are broken everything on this planet is broken nothing is perfect so god didn't say i promised you perfection down here in heaven no sorrow no sadness no sickness no suffering but here there's brokenness but god says even in the middle of all this brokenness i have good plans for you hallelujah glory to god i got written down here glory to god hallelujah i have good plans for you i have a good life for you he says even when bad choi you you listen you hear can you hear me is it good even when you make bad choices don't we do that i'm greater than your choices and i can even fit the dumb decisions cuckoo we get sometimes that you have made into good plans wow i i don't even know i'm going to be sticking in his tongues in a minute hallelujah jesus oh my my my he can turn a crucifixion in your life into a resurrection oh my i believe him my brothers and sisters romans 8 28 we know that the god causes everything to work together for those who love god who are called according to his purpose i believe i'm called according to his purpose i believe because of his love i love him who love me and revealed himself to me that's why i love him he constantly reveals love to me over and over and over i'm here this morning because not because of my works and how much i pray and do all these things because he loves me he's good to me that's why i'm here this morning that's why i can press on that's why i can face tomorrow because he lives in me oh my glory to god glory to god you say i want to have a relationship with you i want fulfill the purpose you made me for this is not a promise for everybody in the world everything is not working together for good for everybody in the world everything is working together for good to those who give it all to god oh my ouch don't want to go there but i'm going to go wherever the spirit wants me to go those who give it all to god i wonder if there's anybody here today in your life you might hide it from one another that's fine but you can't the word of god is sharper and discerner of the thoughts and intents and the motives of the heart he's here not brother tim he's here i'm just a vessel like you like any one of us you're sitting here today believe in this believe in this lie it says those who are called god i want your plan your purpose for my life it doesn't say all things work together it says all work together even the bad and even the bitter all things work together slide number seven you know the story of joseph in the bible hey how many know it well what what a man on earth brother branham did he not say correct me if i'm wrong the closest man of perfection on earth outside of jesus christ my look at his life my brothers and sisters where his brothers sold him into slavery my my my my lord there shouldn't be any any complaining in us when we leave here about our lives anything he ends up being second in command in egypt and years later he confronts his brothers and he says in genesis 50 20 your plans wants to hurt me but god turn your evil plans into a good plan to save lives of many that is called redemptive suffering sometimes you may suffer for the benefit of other people amen that happens my brothers and sisters in our lives it's not just jesus is here now he's manifesting his word he's fulfilling all righteousness in us and sometimes we have to suffer and we go through suffering for other people but if we're stuck on ourselves and we're feeling sorry for ourselves and why why oh christian life has always got to be good is that your conception of what christian life is what this word is it always got to be a bed of roses amen everything has to be perfect i got to be prospering and being blessed and and healthy and everything all the time you're not reading the same bible i'm reading it doesn't not say any of that stuff and i ain't preaching any of that stuff but i'm preaching that god is good through and all all the time amen that's what jesus did for you when he died on the cross that's redemptive suffering he wasn't paying for his sins was he no no he didn't have he didn't have any he was paid for yours and sometimes like joseph's case god takes the bidder and makes it a world better because of what you went through god says it's not all good in your life but i can use it for good and fit it into my plan even when it hurts and sin of the other people even when you're innocent you're an innocent person and you've been hurt by others what that's good no that's not good it was not good to be hurt by others but god can use that hurt yes because god is a good god and he loves to bring good out of bad anybody can bring good out of good but god brings bad out of good out of bad amen are we seeing something here or do i have to break it down a little bit more here do you see do you see how your your motives your intentions your your selfishness can get involved in here it's not about you it says sometimes you gotta suffer my brothers and sisters how many are you in that category you gotta suffer for other people's sins you mean i don't have to judge their sins condemn their sins criticize their sins but lord you want me to suffer for their sins well you know you don't understand what that means unless you're walking in the spirit unless the very life of christ that manifests that on earth is living that through you now it's not our life paul said it's not i that live but it's christ that lives in me what am i talking about this morning am i talking about you working yourself up am i talking about what you can do to bring this to pass in your life all you can do is die out and surrender to the call of god in your life that's all you can do it's his life that lives out through you and you're sitting there experiencing that how how do i know that how can i know that scripture what i just read there in my life is when god puts me through it and i go through it how many of us are burdened in prayer how many of us got down you know jesus was in the garden of gethsemane yeah you're gonna say ah this is just for jesus what are you talking about brother tim jesus got down in the garden of yosemite and he bled sweats of blood because he was taking your sins he was wrestling every temptation every devil of hell that we would go through that we would have to go through in our lives that we would need victory over and he was praying and he was taking that sin he was taking our sin in prayer how many of us can take my brothers and my sisters sin and their lives in prayer and really oh not oh father help my brother you know he's a sinner and you know he sins all the time and he's got this habit this and that that's prayer that's selfishness that's carnality but you can get down in prayer and say father that sin that my brother is struggling that habit that he's stronger that demon i'm going there i'm going right down to the depths of hell and i'm going to pull him out of there i tell you when we get into prayer like that my brothers and sisters we start experiencing the garden of gethsemane in our lives for one another you're going to see a movement a revival a movement of the spirit of god amongst us you're going to see victory overcoming power in our lives like never before instead of letting satan make the church lukewarm lazy luck i need you i need you you need me i can't do it on my own i need you in prayer i need you to battle with me and me with you covered has separated everything the bride is not separated the bride is united by faith she's united by the holy ghost where there's no walls there's no distance i can feel your thoughts from a far away i know what you're thinking that's why sometimes we call each other or we send texts to each other and i sit there and i smile and on the other end when i send texts they sit there and smile brother i was just going to send that to you i was going to just do that what is that my brothers and sisters something for us to get tickled about no that builds faith inside of me because my thoughts are his thoughts they're your thoughts we're moving and i thought rem well what is that that's just an example my brothers and sisters when i get called to pray for an individual for something that's going on that's the thought read that we're moving and manifesting in i get down in prayer not just when and it's good and it's good when brother bill sends out all those uh prayer requests it's good but i you know what i'll tell you something my brothers and sisters not the boasts on me and some of you know what i'm talking about not to boast on me but i'm praying sometimes before those prayer requests come in exactly what's coming in all right don't look at me like some kind of superman or some kind of this not no i'm just moving in the spirit i'm just feeding on his word i'm seeking him every day i'm allowing him to live inside of me i will show you things to come do we believe the word or not no it's gonna you know the angel is gonna divide the religious people the wheat the tares he's dividing the now as the word goes forth brother tim ain't dividing pastor simon are the other brothers not divided it's the angels when the words going forth is dividing my brothers and sisters get into christ if you're not into christ young people there is no time get into christ you want a better life what better life is there out there for you there is no better life out there for you christ is the only life everything else is death amen let's move along here oh my god 25 minutes and we're going good hallelujah amen slide eight the more you trust the goodness of god the happier you're going to be romans 5 3 so we can rejoice when we run into problems and trials oh happy day i'm in a problem oh happy day amen i'm in a problem oh happy day because god is good amen and god's gonna turn this bad day into a good day he's gonna make me prosper i'm going to be stronger amen my weakness is going to be gone oh my happy day hallelujah we sing a happy day when jesus washed my sins away but happy day when the trials come hallelujah happy day happy day this happy day i'm happy you can be happy even in the middle of pressure trials troubles tribulation why notice the phrase for we know circle that in your head for we know for we know happiness in life depends on what you know not what you go through you hear that what you know not what you're going through don't look at the circumstance don't look at what you're going through don't look at the sickness whatever it isn't the habit is what you know and who you know you can take two people put them through the same circumstance one of them is happy and the other one is devastated oh my you know it's it's tough because we're in this rim you know and to say you shouldn't be devastated it's pretty tough because we're all at different levels of faith right right i'm trying to bring encourage your faith i know i know the gift that god has given me you know i'm not a great teacher i'm not even a great preacher really but i got a a a faith a something in my heart that when i was born again god gave me for the people to see them grow in faith and the knowledge of jesus christ and see i get more i get more excited and i get more fulfilled when i see you overcoming when i see you getting victory that's how i know my heart is right i have to judge my heart all the time by the word of god i judge myself the bible says right we will judge and we will be judged here right we need to judge this thing sometimes to see where we're at we need to bible says we need to examine our faith to see where we're at yes my brothers if you get if you get devastated from a trial that's okay but let me tell you encourage yourself one day maybe you won't you'll go through the same thing or maybe even worse and not be devastated anymore and that will see and show that your faith is growing in christ but if you're walking 10 15 years later and you're still getting devastated by the same things or over and over you're not growing let me tell you my brother and sister time is running out time is running out i believe the door's still open i believe that i'm not saying it is amen for you to run to the altar of mercy and grace and fall before his face and stop hiding behind many other faces you can't hide anymore we're naked before the lord all the earth is naked before him all is going to be exposed on that day listen there's nothing going to be hid that is trying to be hit now everything is going to come to light everything is coming to light even now so in my life and in my heart i want to be an open book in front of you all because the saints shall judge the earth and the saints are here this morning and i'm an open book for you to judge amen and pray and intercede for me the bible says by your prayers i was set free you know the bible says that by your prayers i was set free amen oh my we're winding it down here lord have mercy help us father amen slide number nine god always gives me what i need not what i deserve oh hallelujah hallelujah let us shake ourselves for a minute i know we've been sitting for a bit amen but i want to bring a couple thoughts here at the end that i think is very important amen to to to our our belief in our hearts and see amen how good god is amen psalms 103 10 he had not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities oh thank you jesus i don't know about you but i'm just feeling the love of god in my heart more and more when i read when i read this when i read this he just he just comes and he just jumps out at me he has taken our sins my sins you can say my sins he has taken my sins away and removed them far from the easters to the west i like that saying from the east to the west because there is no end to the east and west there is a north pole and a south pole there is an end to those but god says he takes my sins and he just wipes them out oh my one verse in the bible says he puts them in the in the deep parts of the sea and then he puts a sign up no fishing sign oh my oh glory glory when you realize your sins amen he's forgiven them oh my when you come into that realization that your sins are gone and you don't have to carry them anymore we carry them too much that's what holds us and bears us down but he's taking them and i can walk every day in this flesh and this dimension with all my mistakes with all my ups and downs with all my weaknesses and say he's taken my sins if god hasn't forgiven you you need to forgive yourself if god has forgiven you you need to forgive yourself now god is good he gives me what i need not what i deserve thank you father in the bible king david commits adultery and then covers it up he has his wife's husband murdered oh god pretty big sins murder and adultery right on the top but did david deserve to be forgiven no the david deserved mercy no but david knows that god is good and god is so he's asked so he asked him for mercy because he knows god is good how many times we keep our mistakes and our sins to ourselves and we don't approach god because we don't know he's good see david committed adultery david committed murder but he knew he knew that his god was good so he went to god not half-heartedly but brokenheartedly when he recognizes sin when the prophet told him his sin he went to god and asked for mercy because he knew god was good oh my oh my oh my brother my brothers and sisters that atonement is so the blood sacrifice is for us right now that bleeding lamb the lamb of god is on an altar of god making intercession night and day for us if you don't go to that lamb of god no matter what you've done what sin you're letting hold you back in your mind in your hearts go to the lamb of god ask for mercy ask for deliverance ask for grace this is the day and the hour to do that because when that day is over when that door is closed and the bride of jesus christ is coming all that's left is judgment the great white throne judgment and whoever god will show mercy on people are sitting there well you know on that day i believe god will show mercy or i'm waiting for the last day until i died and i'll say you like the rich like the thief on the cross god have mercy on me don't wait for that day my brothers and sisters this is the day of salvation this is the day of salvation for you you know this morning this is the day of salvation here's what he prayed psalms 51 1-2 if you are in a big sin right now you need to go read this psalm 51 god in your goodness have mercy on me not because i deserve it because you are a good god have mercy on me wash away my guilt and make me clean again all that guilt that guilt spirit it's tough eh i battled with that many times i've made mistakes and that guilt my god has kept me down it's kept a wall between me and god amen but he says he said i'll break that wall of petition amen i'll break that wall of petition between me and you guilt guilt satan just putting that guilt constantly we want to break all the walls down amen we want to come boldly before his throne cleanse me from my sin it's all based on who god is and who you are slide 10 jesus understands our weakness for he faced all the same temptations as we do yet not given into it oh thank you lord that means that means i have a god that when i have sin and i have temptation i can go to him do you know him do you know him that way that doesn't matter what you face can you say that in your heart right now that no matter what you face in your life you can go to him and he'll take care of it amen oh not not not oh okay you can do that because you know you're a good christian you're a good message believer you do all the right things your t's are crossed your dot well you know what if you uh make a mistake that a message believer don't make oh you're not supposed to make a mistake and when you're a message believer in that stuff you know i don't know where you're at you might have great victory in some areas great faith in some areas but you have you have a weakness in this area you could fall you can make mistakes this still can happen it doesn't mean that your motive and intention is to stay there or do that i hope not or else you need to get to the altar and get an experience but a born-again christian filled with the holy ghost like some of us in here today can make mistakes in our weaknesses amen and we can go through that but i know that he is a good god amen and i can go to him in prayer hebrews 4 12 for the word of god is quicker and powerful sharper than any two-edged sword piercing and divided asunder the soul and spirit and joints and marrow and the desert of the thoughts and tents of the heart neither is there any creature that is manifested in sight all things are naked and open before his eyes in whom we have to do with seeing that we have a great high priest has passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession amen he's our profession the word is our profession for we have not a high priest that cannot be touched by the feeling of our infirmities but in all points was tempted like us yet without sin so let us let us therefore come boldly before the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace in the help in the time of need oh i love a a a brother or sister who's walking in this kind of faith amen that that goes to god in prayer whether they make mistakes or not and know that they can go to god and they can obtain mercy amen and find grace oh my my brothers and sisters that sets you free when you know that you've got that available to you that you can obtain mercy and grace hallelujah amen let me invite the musicians i want to tell a story here i think it's a beautiful story of the grace of god and the goodness of god oh my brother branham speaking here in the message of grace look at that the message of grace and when he went down oh we're talking about a king you remember the story of the king and the man that murdered his son oh my listen to it again with an open heart and he went down and looked back in that cage like a cage in an animal he saw his little skinny body laying back there in the corner crying his face was sunk in his jaw set back his eyes way back was in his head and his mouth was white whited over no water thirsty laying there back on his face crying the king said stand up and he come up to him and he looked at him and said why did you kill my son now i hope you're typing this spiritually here why did why what did my son do to you what did he do to merit such a death as you killed him stabbing him to death with a spear oh what our lord went through if you know what he suffered and what he went through that's why i love him so much he said nothing my lord not one thing just my own selfishness just my own ways i killed him because i was jealous of him and i got a temper fit and i killed him now i'm to die under your justice sir i realize that and i deserve to do it and i deserve it it's like us my brothers and sisters we deserve hell we don't deserve all this goodness we don't until you recognize that and realize that you can't have the gratitude in your heart and the love of the heart for what god has really done for us we don't deserve it i am i am crying for that i'm just sorry that i killed a royal man like that without a cause the king turned on his heels and walked out went down to the desk and said destroy all the records i don't know what made him do that what made him do that there's a love that you cannot explain there destroy all the records wash him up clean him up send him down a robe for him my god from one extreme to another after a while a great big limousine drove up to the door when it did a carpet was spread out to the prison cell oh my the king the king stood at the end of the limousine and said come my son my son my daughter when the lord says to you my son my daughter ride home with me to the palace put the king's robe around his shoulders the holy spirit he said from henceforth you are my son because he had pity that's grace that was me that was you we killed the son of god with our sins we're alieated dirty filthy lying in the cells of this world but god washed us by his blood of his own son cleansed us put the robe of the holy spirit around us and now the great chariot of god will come back to the door someday and we'll go home and live for him forever all records are destroyed we can't be judged no more they are burnt up he put them in the sea of forgetfulness and remembers them no more no wonder we can sing amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved the rest like me i once was lost but now i'm found i was blind but now i see let us stand this morning god is good all the time knowing god's grace and love is knowing he is good and all-powerful when we by faith get to know him in who he really is then our prayer life will be about him and his kingdom jesus said i have come to bring a kingdom the kingdom of god god and behold the kingdom how god has come unto man let me say unto you behold the kingdom of god has come [Music] god's grace sent us a prophet in our day what did the messes do jesus revealed god so does the message reveal god and all his characteristics that we we may know our positions in christ paul said i want to know him and the power of his resurrection oh hallelujah let us pray and then we're going to worship with a song that i felt in my heart father take your word take your goodness take your love take all your characteristics take everything that you are lord speak to the people's hearts when
