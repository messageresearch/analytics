uh today I'd like to speak on the subject of have you any meat now H at first before I begin I want to thank the Lord for this great privilege of being here with you and it is a privilege indeed that God can still use me right right I stood here in the uh in a position and uh as Pastor for so many years and God decided to move me into another uh another office and Direction so it's a privilege for me to come and be with you here to share the word of God also a privilege to be allowed to address this portion of the Bride of Jesus Christ uh and I'm really happy to be here to to be among people that understand the word of God and the unveiling of the sons of God in this day and in this hour the manifestation of the word made flesh again the great Holy Spirit materializing by the opening of the word we so thank God for this honor and this privilege and as I see the fruits of the ministry blooming and blossoming and fruit bearing it's a wonderful wonderful honor and privilege speaking naturally now we thank God to see some of are all the faces of Believers that we know and have come up in the Lord and come up under this Revelation and we want to thank God to see you that you're still running for him in the great race of life so it's my honor indeed to uh thank God also for pastor Danny for asking me to come and say a few words now I'm just going to talk with you and have a wonderful conversation is that all right amen ra having a conversation doesn't mean I'm going to lecture or anything like that but um just so that we can have a heart-to-heart talk uh with you looking at the word and me speaking with you and let the Holy Spirit have have his way I thank God especially also for some of the saints that were away they're still coming back brother Alvin is here we thank God for that uh my own uh dear wife is back also but there was something important that she had to do out of town so she had to leave immediately we want to thank God for her that accompani me all the way into Germany and back praise God God bless you real good I won't keep you um hanging and waiting but I'll just go straight to the word I'm going to ask is brother Chris here okay um somebody that knows how to read here who brother oh brother says only you know how to read oh praise the lord well I want to read from John chapter 21 verses 1 to4 if you'll find it in your Bible find it in your Bible oh they have it up there that's wonderful yes brother I can read from the back of my head I know that praise the Lord after these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the Sea of tiberias of course it's the same Sea of Galilee which was renamed by the Roman emperor in his name right that's why it's called by both names Tiberius and in another moment it's called Sea of Galilee right uh there were together Simon Peter and Thomas called didus and Nathaniel of kaaa in Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two other of his disciples Simon Peter said unto them I go a fishing now this is just after Jesus had died and uh again they had no they didn't know really much about his resurrection or anything like that so and they were waiting in that waiting period between his resurrection on the day of Pentecost they didn't know what to do like a lot of people in between the prophet dying and going up to glory and waiting for the Rapture a lot of people don't know what to do a lot of people are getting confused misled misdirected misplaced and stuff like that misinformed and uh they're in a state of confusion and don't know what to do yet they are true believers but they're just confused as far as that goes right now here Simon Peter said unto them I go fishing I'm going to go fishing I'm not going to sit here doing nothing in church I've got to go do something all right now they say unto him we also go with thee they went forth there's the influence of leadership is very important they went forth and entered into the ship immediately and that night they caught nothing that mean they fished all night and they caught nothing okay but when the morning was come was was now come Jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus just as I may ask you the same question have you seen him since he's risen you knew him before but now he's risen he's in a revelated form Christ The Mystery of God now being revealed by the presence and power of the Holy Spirit not by human emotion or human instrumentality but by the grace of God he pours out his spirit upon All Flesh praise the Lord hallelujah and uh then Jesus said unto them children have you any meat they answered no and he said unto them cast the the net on the right side of the ship and you shall find the rest of the story you know you're aware the Nets were so filled they couldn't pull them in they had to call for other churches other ships to come and take some of the catch uh because it was so much but we praise God for his the reading of his word and using that as the absolute using that as the foundations right for us to say a few words for his glory and for his honor praise God hallelujah let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father once again we are honored to be here in your presence and with your people pray you'll take the word and apply the token to the hearts of the people that their hearts may may may be softened and maybe their eyes will be open their ears will hear and the Holy Spirit will represent himself through the word of God we ask this in jesus' name amen and amen the Lord bless you please be seated Jesus as we explained they they had fished all night uh not during the day and you know it's better fishing at night anyway fishes run by night and if you know anything about fishing when the moon or is in the right position the fish run even more and you're able to catch even more fish like that but they were fishing and they fished all all night first of all they made a decision to leave and go where they wanted to and to go fishing and they caught nothing with all their human struggle with all their expertise they were not just learning how to fish they were men who knew how to fish right just like these uh Jesus said the the stone which the build Builders rejected the builders experts they they they should be able to recognize that this was no ordinary Stone but the even the experts failed to recognize that was the Keystone The Headstone the Capstone that was the original Alpha and Omega amen upon which our faith rests upon Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever am okay now we understand here that when he said the scripture says there were fishing all night I want you to throw this thought in when he speaks of the night from the time they sun sets puts it in let me put it in the words of brother brandham he said the stars come out to shine only after the sun has gone down and so the messengers time of The Messengers started for them to shine it had to be night and so the church was out there fishing all night fishing through Seven Ages trying to catch something to eat even a crawfish even a a crab or something something to eat but we find they caught nothing drown Through the Ages it came that way phases different phases of the night they pass through it right and we know the darkest hour is just before the dawn amen I believe we are living right now in the darkest hour I believe all the prophet has prophesied is now coming to pass in his words modern events are making things clearer and clearer in the light of Vindicated prophecy amen so we are not only preaching talking living understanding the prophecies but we are part of that prophecy we are in the prophecy yes sir and we are making the prophecy known through our lives when Jesus died di on the cross around 400 and something prophecies were fulfilled quickly just like that it's the same with us we are here amongst the people they think that we are just the ordinary persons like they are not realizing that we are not creatures of time we come from eternity and we return back to Eternity every Jew drop that falls brother Bram said the Sun comes out to shine he says they go right back up where they come from and every Jew drop that's here this morning is going right back where you come from and you can't help it because we're in the presence of the Sun the sunlight of revelation of God's word strikes your heart and you recognize that it's not just man it's god making himself known in this hour what the day in which we are living when the world is making himself manifest again Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah yes sir and so he asked them praise God have you any meat praise the Lord I want you to know something here friends brother brandham touched upon this and I want to go to his quotation his sermon blasphemia names he spoke about the vision that he had in the forest if you have time you can read it yourself I'm not going to read word for word but get the gist or the understanding out of it he said and there I was I saw myself standing in the Sun not just Su but he's in Christ he's speaking the word under the anointing of the the Holy Ghost amen yes and you see it was absolutely perfect and the words you know that I have spoken can never fail praise God I thought I was the happiest person I ever seen standing in the sun there praise God and there was a large Mammoth congregation oh they were sitting in the forest streaks of sun were shining on them they had a little bit of understanding right and they were listening to him there there as they were getting the word but then preaching too long preaching too late preaching again he repeats too long and I preached so long until the congregation began to become hungry for physical food right they want to leave the message and go out take care of their necessities and their natural things first not we are supposed to take care of our families and of ourselves but I'm saying when you get drawn away by all these things of natural life right not keeping your eyes on Heavenly things not keeping your eyes on the things of God then we enter into TR trouble so they became hungry for physical food some of them got so tired they just got up out of the meeting and went out to get them some food and when they did that I said don't don't do that don't for I have two climaxes yet to come right remember the third the puls one two three right one to the flesh one to the soul and the one one to the heart one goes to the soul amen praise God so you realize that God's holy spirit in this last pull this last time this last climax God is pulling now for his chosen ones that at the elected life and seed and Gene germ whatever you want to describe it in them that's why the discernment of the spirit is going to it's going right there and the attraction of it is the magnet of the word deep calling to deep pulling towards that Soul that's been hidden there waiting for this hour when the word of God comes on the scene and begins to draw them back where they come from amen hallelujah praise God Amen I know the Lord had given that to me and any preacher knows when you really know that is God that gave it to you and it burns within your heart see and I saw I was preaching so hard to them like that about these great things of God oh I shouted glory to God look on these wonderful things oh but people began to talk and murmur because they were physically hungry right and they had enough spiritual they had enough spiritual things so now they started walking away he said and brother Bram yawns at this point and he literally yawns he said and some of them I saw started yawning and walking away from the message I was preaching I thought what's the matter with these people what's the matter with everybody and there were some young couples going along to my side I said just a minute just a minute you'll be back again when the evening Shadows Fall I said you'll be back again but let me give you the first climax before you go where does all these things come from that I have showed you where are they from here they are they are in the word of God they are thus sayith the Lord his promise all of you bear me record this Witness this commission all of gods just stay with the word what's the matter with you all can't you understand the word that you are receiving you must understand it and some of them said man uh man the word but I love to get some biscuits they leave the word to go and get biscuits okay I thought well glory to God if they want biscuits let them go get their biscuits I turned around and said but you know the Shadows are going to fall darkness in other words and the Darkness is falling right now we know that the darkness is falling right now then tonight when a congregation comes together I'll put the climax to them and tell them the things they've seen me do is found in the word of God and not it's not a myth because that's what the devil is trying to put out now to get people's minds starting to think maybe this are just nice stories man of long ago with miracles signs wonders healings and is just like the other evangelists and it's all going to pass and it's not going to it's not going to stay forever it's going to pass away so the holy spirit let him say this is not a myth this is not from some mythical book it's not from an organization it is found in the word of God every bit of it in the word because I am commissioned to do that you know there'll everyone be back tonight so I'll background kind of background until they get back I'll do I'll do these things the church ages and things like that background and what I said before I'll back ground on the word of God when this marvelous climax what a time it will be amen and then I seen myself begin to fade out like that and here I was oh my there it is praise the Lord friends never look at the world or the cosmos as the message of God Amen none of them preaching out side of this message may be religious it may be spiritual but don't look to any of that for any leadership don't look to any of that for any guidance let the Holy Spirit keep you in the message of the hour praise God you see let me say this brother Brandon saying when you go you say well brother Bose said I had a dream years ago God would send me to Chicago and Shake Chicago for the glory of God Joseph said he I said to Joseph he's already done it he said why they haven't been shaken since the time of Moody I said I am talking about the church I'm not talking about the rest of them out there the church World he's not talking about the church world he really talking about the bride right oh my that's just the dust of the earth that Bunch cramming through the streets painted Jezebels and everything else I said them big old lodges and things will all crumble and fall in the streets but he's talking to his church the church that has seen the the church that has seen the revelation of Jesus Christ made manifest and they those ones recognize it they recognize it there may not be 15 out of this city of Chicago you remember Jesus said few there be that will find it it's a narrow way and a lot of people see thousands and thousands of people in the message they think everyone is going here but uh well they'll go in but not as the bride as I've said before maybe as bridegrooms uh maybe as a guard maybe as a servant uh different levels of those that are in the book of life but they are not going in the bride they're not going in this particular time because he says in the city of Chicago which you know is millions of people he said only about 15 right my goodness think of it just as it was there might not be 10 come out of this generation that's how close it is that's why we have to make our calling and our election sure is that right make your calling and election sure don't guess don't hope I hope I be in the Rapture I I I I trust I'm going to be there no sir uh it just as it was as in the days of Noah so will it be at the coming of the son of man wherein eight Souls were saved let me say that the church has already received their shaking the church world has been Shook and a lot of fruits you know when I was a boy we'd go by in people's mango trees or banana trees or what it's not too near the fence or it's hanging over and uh you you know we' shake the tree and all the fruits will fall on the ground and the church world has been Shook and we came out from the church world we were shaken Loose by the revelation of this Prophet thank you Lord amen and God set us free by bringing us out by his grace amen hallelujah and when the first message when they see it everybody rallied for it amen Oh Glory to God hallelujah they they recognize it they know the word they seen the word when it was being materialized and they caught it amen look at that now oh my see oh Hallelujah then they go away some of them the same way they come Hallelujah think of it praise God but don't worry the sh Shadows are close at hand amen the Shadows are close at hand we can say they are here right now Hallelujah now let me uh pick up back my thought here that we are talking about the question that he asked the disciples you fished all night and you caught nothing whatsoever you did not catch amen Jesus asked them from the shore after a whole night of fasting come and have breakfast come break your fast from all the stuff that you uh the hunger that you were bearing now I want to ask you individually what are you eating we have come from everywhere uh we come from different groups different churches I said groups in the message and I'm still asking you have you any meat oh oh but I was in the message I heard the word I heard about the prophet and oh my goodness I got all kinds of Revelation and stuff of that nature and and and so I know the word of God and I I don't know what you're talking about here in that regard see but I want to ask you have you any meet you might have heard the word preached the in the form of even this message but even when you heard that did you get any meat out of it right now I want you to realize that God didn't want you you to eat on History he did not want you to eat on theology God didn't want you to eat on the stored up accumulation of human knowledge put into books that you can go study and then when you study enough of it you're so filled with it you sound as if you have Revelation because you can bring forth all that knowledge and present it to the people in that way but God is now separating the whole thing and letting us know Revelation is not that men talk about men that tell preachers oh I studied all night I fasted I prayed I read all the books so many many times I I know every Dot and everything else that's more no better than a Pharisee yeah no better than a saddu see uh right that's not what this is just to give you a hint what Bible did Abel read what Bible did Abel read did he just decide that well I'm just going to grab some uh fruits and offer it on the altar will I let me catch a bird or or I'll just go how did he know the Bible says by Faith by Revelation and no no Bible was yet written for you to go study the Bible from cover to cover uh this book from cover to cover to be able to know but Revelation is God's thoughts through your thoughts and through your mouth or through your life amen thank you Jesus the revelation of God's spirit by the word wants to make itself manifest who was that MDC who is this MDC who is the Son of God who is the child of the most high God the Holy Spirit of this last day comes to fulfill his own word hallu hallelujah satisfied with crackers and biscuits disguised as the message that's not what the real seed of God is here for to eat on the word of God you got some Believers that are even satisfied with road kill message uh you know dead dogs and dead Hawks and whatever else on the side of the road they they they're happy with that and they'll feed on that but that thing has been on the road for for maybe five six seven days and it's all rotten in the street that theology is nothing but a bunch of mock don't you know you're feeding on the dog's vomit amen it's Satan's vomit they're feeding on the same lies that he told in the beginning that just rumored and went through the heavens and went to the some of those angels they were eating nothing but the dog vomit of that devil amen and he has now regurgitated his life re gradated all his mess and he's spreading it everywhere within the message within the very presence of the Living God hallelujah but every time he does that God raises up a standard against him Hall and we are here to raise a standard against him amen raise a standard Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah yes sir false trinitarian do amen friends we got to preach the original and we got to touch back on the fundamentals that Jesus Christ is God Almighty amen that he is Lord of all amen that is every he is a great I am sir alpha and omega beginning and the end hallelujah amen I was speaking in Colombia and you know of L is a very Catholic country and I just began to ask them I said you some of you believe Mary uh is the one that you have to pray to I said but really uh who was the one that was B had a miraculous birth Mary or Jesus I said Jesus I said yeah who was the one that worked miracles on in Galilee they said oh Mary or Jesus said Jesus amen I said who was the one that went to Calvary and died on that cross was it Mary nail there or was it Jesus Jesus amen I said who went in the grave was it Mary did they bury her or was it Jesus they said Jesus went they said who rose again Mary or Jesus it was Jesus I said well who you going to who you going to live for who you going to get who's your savior who is who's the your mediator who is the one you're going to pray to marry or Jesus and of course you know he said Jesus I said well I come to the altar praise the Lord and so quite a few of them got converted because it was simple and clear amen Mary didn't die for us uh nobody else died for us no Pope no great man no nothing of that sort died for us it's Jesus Christ died for us the great Creator became Our Savior amen thank you Jesus the great cre Creator think of it became Our Savior and all God's fullness dwelleth in him amen the fullness of the godhead bodily was in him every one of us all the seeds all the germs all the genes it was all in him the fullness of the godhead and I thank God I believe I was one of them Hallelujah amen Satan's doctrinal vomit that he's teaching everywhere like that amen hallelujah regurgitating all kinds of history and impressing the People by quoting uh Shakespeare Spencer Kipling whoever they quote these great men and let them feed on that and they appear as if they're so brilliant and educated know something they know nothing thing because they're out of the stream of Supernatural Revelation not Revelation look there's two kinds of knowledge you know that there is sense knowledge and there is revelation knowledge education and all the highest forms of Education comes from the senses the accumulation of wisdom of men through their senses over centuries that is not Revelation that is human knowledge Revelation knowledge is what will make a prophet tells you not guessing but tell you your name is son so you come from this address 5432 whatever and your house has a blind and a blind the color of the drapes are this and that and oh by the way yesterday you went to the doctor and when you went there and the doctor was trying to give you the medicine his elbow knocked a bottle from off the shelf do you remember that the person screams and they shout why because it's a prophet speaking well God is making himself known to his people not at that level but it's the same vein of Revelation breaking upon his people and the word of God is opening up itself that we could recognize what he is saying hallelujah praise God do you recognize what he's saying amen amen yes sir Hallelujah yes sir I want you to know that that that's Satan trying to put forth his false tale knowledge that he stored up in all kinds of books listen I'm not just talking like that all this Pulpit commentary I've been been in all that stuff I still have them sometimes you need to look and find certain things to uh give you some understanding what other people thought about it but you're not going by what other people thought you're going by what God thought amen praise God hallelujah those things are wonderful uh and they're marvelous but if Satan got his lies mixed into these things amen yes sir let me tell you now friends it's so clear that when he ask have you any meat amen with all your works with all you working all night with all the theologians studying down through the centuries when you get that what have you got you've got nothing and your soul is starving for the reality of the power and the presence of almighty God hallelujah oh thanks be the God for the holy spirit that is the same yesterday today and forever praise God hallelujah amen now the it tells us that they saw him on the shore think of it a stranger on the shore they had spent three and a half years with him in the words of the Prophet they ate with him they slept with him uh they fished with him and yet when he came back with his resurrected revelated body they said they knew not that it was the Lord they did not recognize the same word that was there with them all the time I'm afraid that's what's happening with a lot of Believers following this message lot of Believers following this message fishing about fishing about fishing about and they're catching nothing some jump from church to church to church to church some run here run there let me tell you God's holy spirit will lead you and guide Le amen and he'll tell you where to be amen it's as simple as that it appears like nothing you see this kind of preaching God hides himself in Simplicity and and it appears like oh it's nothing I didn't hear anything yeah but God is speaking by his word and if you got the ears to hear you will hear it if you got the eyes to see you will see it praise the Lord so Jesus he said have you any meat and then they came to shore of course I don't want to go through the whole thing Peter jumping in the water and rushing to to meet Jesus all like that but look he already had the fish and bread prepared is that right he couldn't just light the fire just when they were close to the shore that means he had it prepared beforehand he had it roasting there and ready for them when they came in right and the food that we are eating now was food prepared before the foundation of the world this is not Seminary stuff this is not from some University this is not from some college this is not something I dig up on the Internet and look the internet is good I use it too but it's not just what we dig up on the internet that only as supports and helps what we want to try to make clear to you but this comes from the very mind of God the presence of almighty God God's holy spirit working across our hearts amen God revealing himself oh praise God forever more and so this word was there before the foundations of the world and the Bible said they found him roasting it on the fire oh praise PR God forever more let me tell you something friends we need the fire you can't uh and the reason why I say this do you know that God receives only his burnt offerings and to have a burnt offering it got to pass through fire and Jesus went down into hell so that he could be the true burnt offering of the people of God and even so I believe in this hour that we have to have calls of fire to roast and bring forth the juices and the life from out of the word of God I believe as in Isaiah six the fire from off of the altar was put on the town of the of the of Isaiah amen when he said speak my Lord I believe that same fire calls of fire from out of the word of God must come again upon the minister that there become burning fire brands for the glory of God hallelujah amen the message has got to come word to life yes and what's happened the devil has used when brother brandham said we are not Pentecostals oh my goodness that has made some people scared to clap their hands in church we're not supposed to be pentec they're scared to have a drum they're scared to play a guitar because they feel Church ought to be very Catholic Church ought to be very decently and in order not we must have order but that order is God's order of the holy spirit amen but let me tell you the day of Pentecost is the pattern for the church and we are the true original Pentecostals Alpha has become Omega amen oh he preached what Paul preached and the same way that the spirit made them act in the beginning is the same way the spirit will make you act here now at the end this is winding up this is all winding up because we're going up the devil is not going to shut us up we're getting out of here by the grace of God hallelujah glory to God Amen praise God glory to His Marvelous and wonderful name so the fish and bread had to be burnt in the fire praise God and I tell you I like the word burning within my heart praise God uh I went to a certain church and I was preaching there and after I finished preaching the a young preacher got up and we don't want any Pentecostals here and all because I spoke just for about five minutes and the people started shouting message people uh they forgot themselves and they started shouting and and like that and you know the senior preacher didn't even rebuke him didn't even correct him or anything because it seems like he himself can recognize what God is doing in this hour and in this time amen and that's the way it goes Hallelujah but a True Believer when they come in the presence of God nothing can shut them up nothing can shut them up amen they tell him when he when the when he was coming into Jerusalem amen they said tell your disciples to shut up tell them to stop shouting and carrying on like that but how could they shut up they were looking that prophecy being fulfilled right before their very eyes how could that shut up when they see uh zachariah's prophecy being fulfilled riding your king is coming in riding on the cult the fall of an ask how they going to shut up when they see the living word right before their very eyes my God Hallelujah the word making itself manifest in this hour [Music] Hallelujah you think the spirit you think the spirit that was upon B brother brandham is gone no amen where is Elijah that's not what we are here for right where is the god of Elijah where is the god of Elijah and that same God that was anointing Elijah as I as as I was with Moses so will I be with thee and that that Spirit broke itself up and went in the 70 men right and it was the same Spirit but it started the hour came represented by book of Acts 2:4 telling you how the pillar of fire stood there and then it started breaking into little pieces and going to each one of them Apostles that were there that's what is happening now the word is embodying itself not in brother William Marian branam he served his purpose it's now come to come into Believers and use them individually for his glory you believe that am amen that's what's going on right now the Holy Spirit making himself known by the word of God making itself known to them Hallelujah hungry he says you're hungry come and eat there's bread and Fish on the fire look there's bread and fish in the word but you won't recognize it that's what sets it on fire it's when the fire falls the Revelation comes the same word that you were reading all your life all of a sudden it comes on fire it comes on light it becomes bright your understanding opens your heart opens up and you begin to see and understand the word of God you remember when David Saul was after him how many remembers that Saul was after his life well this is not Saul this is the devil after you I said the devil is after you he wants every one of us if he can take us back he wants us right and David didn't know what to do because Saul had gone to all sent out his people and warn all the tribes not to give him nothing he's not to eat if you found it then you found doing that you're going to be in trouble so David didn't know what to do then he remembered all he can do is go to the high priest and so he went into the high priest and told the high priest he was hungry the priest said well we don't have anything here except the loaves of bread that are on the altar in the presence of God now you know those loaves of bread that were on the altar they were sitting there and they could not rot they couldn't rotten amen because they were in the presence of the pillar of fire that was hanging there with the Ark of the Covenant there and Aaron's Rod was even buding because that that it the presence of God brings life and when the presence of God is in a church it brings life you can't help it it brings life to it so so there it is that the priest said I have nothing and if you're not a priest and you eat that bread you will will die but David said I'm so hungry you know I might as well die even if I eat that bread I've got to eat something amen and he grabbed the whole of that shoe bread it's called the shoe bread oh my and he ate from the bread and we know now he did not die we are called Kings and Priests to God and the prophet said that shw bread could never rot not at all because it was in the presence of God and this message will never denominate the real message come on Amen now there are people in this message that are already denominating they they're in their groups they're in their this and that but they're not led by the spirit word of the Living God hallelujah amen but let me let you know in this hour praise God we are here by God as his chosen ones to eat upon that true bread that we might live forever in the presence of God hallelujah oh praise God that we might be Warriors for Jesus Christ like David was draw your sword let's go to battle for the glory of God hallelujah amen praise God so he at that sh bread that God gave to him he fed on it and life came to him and he was able to go out and finish his mission for the glory of God hallelujah oh thank God children have you any meat fear not you will receive spiritual food in due season Prophet said in that hour they will know when it is time for them to know not before but in the time and that breaks right down to the individual God doesn't come as a group and reveal us to he reveals to one by one we gain the portals there to dwell with the Immortals when they ring them golden bells for you and me one by one they gain a portal what is a portal it's an entry point it's an entry point into the old Revelation it's a Gateway praise God and he says you can't go in as a group singing no matter how much sing No matter how rejoicing you you're not going in as a group we go in we break into it one by one yes sir one by one may be at night it may be in your prayer room it may be on your job you're not even thinking anything all of a sudden he there's a man there that turned on the light and the light shined within your heart and the Darkness had to flee away and now you see clearly praise the Lord hallelujah I'm glad that I am one of them I'm glad that God raised up David all the prophets I'm glad that God raised us up to be Eagles is that right yes I said we were raised up to be Eagles how many hawks here is that right [Music] M how many canaries how many parrots all you know how to do is repeat what you heard right oh my God didn't call us to be canaries you know uh brother brandham said I saw that eagle sitting on a branch and he was just looking at the Rising Sun and receiving the word Warm Rays and just below him in the forest floor there was some Chipmunks and there were just chittering chattering carrying on oh my goodness keeping a whole lot of noise and the eagle would just slowly turn his head and look at them you know as if to say if I just move from here and grab one of you the whole bunch scatter I wouldn't waste my time he said and I looked at him and said oh man the prophet said that's a real like a real believer they just don't listen to those chip monks days of Miracles are passed no more healings no more real Supernatural Revelation not by study by Revelation Hallelujah listen I was in a bible college and I know when the spirit of God came to me and strike my Soul hallelujah oh praise God when I received those first two books I read them to my by myself and the spirit began to speak now you're going to have to leave all this now all this big certification and all of this big this and that as go out the door amen and you got to make a decision right there you're going to walk with the word or you going to stay with something natur natural that you know you're solidly going to be positioned you you've got to decide what you're going to do you got to let go of that old path and walk into the presence of almighty God Amen let all lovers go like any young girl she comes to the time of marriage what does she have to do let go of all uh all former loves all former admirers she got to loose them let them go get them out of our mind Focus her thoughts on the one man Hallelujah is that right oh my that's what we have to do amen I loved when I went to the Catholic church I I went to their uh I was that's where I got my primary education that's where I got it all right there and would go to the church and tour the church and Ash Wednesday and so on all this

the Lord hallelujah yes sir I'm going to uh wind this up I can mention you you can look at these things yourself how Phillip went into the desert to meet the Uno and he was already reading the scriptures this man knew the scriptures but when he hit that portion of the word um suddenly he got a block he couldn't understand it and philli came out and said do you understand what you're reading right he says no how can I know unless uh you know some man will come and and make it clear to me but the point is not just a man but God God has to be in that man that that that's making the word clear to you for they hour praise God see this man was hungry for truth and the Holy Spirit revealed himself uh through Phillip to him and gave him the real meat of the word of God hallelujah amen so friends let us be let us take our hunger and turn turn our hunger and our thirst towards him and towards this message of the hour now I have more to say but I'm going to stop right now just uh right
