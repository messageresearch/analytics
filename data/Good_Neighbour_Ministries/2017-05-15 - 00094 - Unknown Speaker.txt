TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we washed our robes in the Crimson Fountain and we are the sons of God we are the sons of God we are the sons of God we wash our Rob in the Crimson we are son we are the children of God hallelujah amen a Son of God a daughter of God you know what that is it's a lesser the same thing that the prophet was as a wave sheep that the god serve came in him and spoke through him is that right we are a lesser manifestation of that Messiah yet the God who serve one place that think he said that one day they realize the god they seek is within them God in you you are a walking son and daughter of God you're a you're you're you're predestinated predestinated you a body that was predestinated a body has not prepared me what body the bride he prepared for him from the four the foundations of the world and you were a part of that so we are the prepared people that was set here uh and and we we we all make different because like Paul said he said in a house there's vessels for all uses and everything else like that all the vessels are there but they're for different uses so here we are are vessels of God to contain God so God could come in us when he chooses and operate that's why he says take not what you going to say what you going to do and about this and about that but in that hour the heavenly father is going to speak through you he's going to act through you for the glory of God Amen you believe that believe that kind of Holy Spirit still operates right not from the public right down to the P right down to the very least right to the children that the same Holy Spirit praise the Lord operates like that and moves within the hearts of God's people praise the Lord hallelujah amen now we know what the True Believer it's the revelation of God being revealed in the age we are living in that's what it is the revelation of the word of God revealed in the age that we are living in Hallelujah so you you you got to let your life light up by that word for your day and for your you can gather a lot of truth from Luther Wesley all these men read their writings read their it's wonderful reading them but because you now have uh the people out there in the world they have a world view they view things through the lens of the world and the system of the world develop their world view right these are the people are viewing it through the Lutheran lens this lens that lens that lens But Here we are now we are viewing it through the telescopic uh eyes of Prophecy right a prophet came and we are looking at it with a totally different view they're looking at the same word and they're seeing something totally different you looking at the same word and the think is magnified because you're looking at it from the re ration brought to you by a prophet Hallelujah so when you look when you look what do you see that brother R asked when you look what do you see then he preach another message I'm seeing God he seeing God are you seeing God I see him every day I see him all the day praise the name of the Lord I see him when I was uh in the days when I worked in construction and I dropped a 2 in chisel which is a white one like that 2 and 1/2 in and it went straight down and that thing went bang and dropped right near my toes and said oh praise God hallelujah amen my toes would have kept walking and I still standing there it's right amen but it's God's grace Hallelujah many little things like that it's God that's keeping us so we have to understand we operate under the inspiration of living God and but the revealed word for the hour now let me wind this up right now now listen to what he says here now God misunderstood God misin misinterpreted amen think about it all them prophets prophesied against their Nation prophesied put curses upon them and they were misunderstood why were they misunderstood because they were true servants they were doing the will of God for that hour they were doing the service of God therefore they themselves were Miss on the stone you understand that if they called me this and call me that in the uh Green Tree when the tree get dry I mean what are they going to call you if I'm the Lord and Master they call me me what are they going to call you they persecute me they're going to persecute you they misunderstood him they'll misunderstand you misinterpret the word you are part of the word they'll misinterpret even some of the things you're trying to tell them praise the name of the Lord hallelujah yes sir they were God's servant doing the will of God doing the service of God therefore they were misunderstood and anybody that follows God is misunderstood and their actions misinterpreted he was misunderstood the wise men were misunderstood but yet they were following a genuine Supernatural sign to find the king and yet they were misunderstood even though the very scripture said there was going to be a star rising out of Jacob according to the Prophecies of Daniel and the King uh the king and those wild wise men should have known it but they misinterpreted the word for their hour amen he was misunderstood and see and then he goes on saying Noah on whenever people get under inspiration he said people like Noah he was misunderstood in this day building an ark where no rain falling yet they don't even know what rain is and he went through a bunch of people Daniel misunderstood in his age every Elijah telling them the rain is going to fall whatever I hear B rain the next you better take a chariot and rush back to the pal because you're going to have problems see always misunderstood a virgin will conceive and bear a son misunderstood see misinterpreting the word forly out because they're not you do ER not knowing the scriptures are the power of God if they were looking and understanding the prophecies that were given their thousands of years before not one but several they would have been able to interpret that word right but what Jesus saying you had so many opportunities to to interpret the word and still you misinterpret it you are not of God cuz if you were of God you would have known me the word you would have known me the word they so they didn't know the word and God didn't God gave them enough time God doesn't BR a man to judgment without first Waring that's right Prophet after prophets and prophesying prophesy prophesy and all those prophecies they didn't have the anointing to be able to weave the word together and have the Revelation come out of it and therefore they were walking in darkness they were walking in darkness contrary to the word of God hallelujah they misinterpreted even Jesus in the form of a man oh my think of it they misinterpreted he himself the word of God hallelujah praise God forever more so brothers and sisters amen you misinterpreted the people shouting screaming holling hosana blessed coming the Lord call you crazy you know he's going into all of this here they start to call you crazy because more and more your life is going to go out of sink with what's going on out there in the world do you know that just normally continue living this message and watch you going to start looking more like a square peg trying to fit in a rung hole you don't have to try to make yourself funny or like brother BR said walk with a 10 pound Bible on your arm with your head up in the air trying so spiritual you don't have to do that you even trying to hide but after a while you can't hide because a city s on the hill can't be here and caught the word and if the word is in you the light is going to shine in you bright and bright musicians is praise the Lord let's just have a a closing himym and a closing prayer and we can leave go to our home you can think on these things and see the both sides the positive and the negative negatively we should not misinterpret the word because misinterpretation of the word identifies that you are not in the AE you are not of the age in which you're living is that right and the word being misinterpreted to you actually strengthens you and defies you because you are kept by the anchor that God placed within you for in Daniel 7 we he says for the foundation stone was laid in you before the foundations of the world Hallelujah so you are foundations amen you're not trusting on yourself amen because your house is built upon the rock is that right your your house is built on the cornerstone praise God which he said is the same foundation stone the same stone that the builders rejected has now become the head of the Court praise the Lord hallelujah aren't you happy that you water there amen it's Honey in the Rock isn't it it's sweeter as the days go by praise the name of the Lord Jesus hallelujah our gracious God and Heavenly Father we thank you for the word for this hour thank you for the Prophet who came and stored up all the food in the storehouse now we have partaken of that food and it tastes fresh and sweet and filled with vitamins father to spiritualize our bodies and minds and hearts for the journey that is before us we are going to take a flight one day and father sometimes we are pressurizes so so that we can be ready for the astronauts life but now because we understand what you're doing we are willing we taking the training and we are ready to go home one day father help your people now to understand to be established and to grow up in the grace of God knowing what we're doing and to understand the signs of his Pro flashing red lights of the stomach and to obey the voice of the sign we ask this in the name of Jesus Christ for the glory of God Amen and amen praise the Lord the prayer meeting Friday night here in the house of the Lord and we'll be back on Sunday Morning by the grace of God to worship him would you love to worship him you love to give him praise amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah I like Wednesday nights too because then I can slow down and you know get into things um a
