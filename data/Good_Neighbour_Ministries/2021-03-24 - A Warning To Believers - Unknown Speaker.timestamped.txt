[1:36] we thank thee from the bottom of our
[1:39] hearts
[1:40] to thee be all the praise the honor and
[1:43] the glory
[1:45] in the name of our blessed
[1:48] lord jesus christ amen
[1:53] well our scripture for tonight
[1:58] is found in the
[2:02] book of jude verse
[2:06] 11.
[2:08] woe unto them
[2:13] for they have gone in the way
[2:17] of cain
[2:20] and ran greedily
[2:23] after the error of
[2:27] balaam for reward
[2:31] and perished in the game saying
[2:35] of core or quora may god
[2:39] bless his word to our hearts today
[2:44] amen glory to god hallelujah
[2:49] now let us take scriptural
[2:52] warning here let us take warning
[2:56] and this warning is to believers
[3:00] all believers everywhere
[3:04] of all ages and of every time
[3:08] may great the great holy spirit
[3:12] speak to our hearts for us to
[3:15] realize the seriousness
[3:19] of the deception
[3:23] uh created by the evil one
[3:27] in this twilight hour
[3:31] of the last age of the church of god
[3:36] now in the scripture we just read
[3:41] there is a warning
[3:46] there is a warning included in there
[3:51] how that in the days of the prophet
[3:54] moses
[3:55] as you know he was a prophet that was
[3:59] sorry
[4:01] vindicated by god
[4:04] by the holy spirit with signs
[4:08] wonders and miracles
[4:11] and most of all thus saith the lord
[4:16] whatever he said in the name of the lord
[4:20] is what came to pass and so he was a
[4:24] thoroughly vindicated prophet
[4:27] of the most high god
[4:31] but when he went out with the children
[4:34] of israel
[4:35] god using him to bring them
[4:38] a great deliverance redemption
[4:42] by blood and power
[4:45] passing through the red sea
[4:49] entering into the wilderness
[4:52] led by the pillar of fire and a pier of
[4:56] cloud
[4:57] under the protection
[5:00] and provision of drake the great job of
[5:06] god who was leading his people
[5:10] into a promised the promised land
[5:14] from a natural bondage
[5:18] natural slavery through a natural
[5:22] wilderness into a
[5:25] natural promised land of canaan
[5:30] we are the opposite we are also
[5:34] led by that same great jehovah
[5:38] but we are being led
[5:42] into out of a spiritual
[5:46] egyptian bondage of denominationalism
[5:51] systems and the works of the hands of
[5:55] man
[5:56] we are being called out
[5:59] pulled out led out
[6:02] brought out breaking away
[6:06] from such things and
[6:09] walking out into the glorious liberty
[6:13] of the great holy spirit
[6:16] trials will be there their testings will
[6:19] be
[6:20] there you will come to a red sea where
[6:23] it seems there is no crossing
[6:25] but god will make a way a miraculous way
[6:29] and bring us through we have a
[6:32] wilderness
[6:34] a wilderness of this modern world this
[6:37] modern age
[6:38] in which we live is a wilderness with
[6:41] wild beasts
[6:42] fiery serpents all manner of
[6:46] hardships hot sun
[6:49] of trials temptations and so on
[6:53] we are to face the same thing
[6:56] that they faced but in a spiritual sense
[7:01] but as they had ever present
[7:04] water from a natural rock we
[7:07] have ever present times of refreshing
[7:11] coming from the presence of the lord
[7:14] through our lord jesus
[7:16] christ hallelujah amen so how
[7:19] thankful we are that they israel
[7:23] in egypt israel in the wilderness
[7:27] israel in the promised land is a
[7:30] type of the church being in
[7:34] denominationalism control and slavery
[7:38] laboring working out their salvation in
[7:41] that natural sense
[7:43] into the wilderness of the world
[7:47] and then to be led by
[7:50] the pillar of fire god above us
[7:53] with the prophet on the earth at the
[7:56] same time
[7:58] to lead us thank god again
[8:01] he has sent a prophet malachi 4
[8:05] 5 this prophet
[8:08] amen of the 20th century to
[8:12] lead us out of the bondage
[8:16] of churchianity out of the bondage
[8:20] of denominationalism and the systems
[8:23] of man into the promised land
[8:27] of canaan canaan
[8:31] not being a type of heaven
[8:34] but because in canaan there were still
[8:36] wars and fightings
[8:38] that they had to do but it is a type of
[8:42] the believer
[8:43] entering into the
[8:46] promised land or the land of the
[8:50] promised
[8:51] word the word that is filled
[8:54] with promises waiting for you to see
[8:58] them
[8:58] understand them and to break into the
[9:01] revelation of them
[9:03] and recognize that there's milk and
[9:06] honey
[9:07] in the word of god for this hour
[9:10] so we are on the same journey
[9:13] but spiritually speaking and here we go
[9:19] just as korra and dayton
[9:23] withstood moses
[9:26] and rose up against that
[9:30] mighty prophet amen
[9:34] disputing with moses
[9:38] and claiming that they had
[9:42] just as much revelation as moses did
[9:45] so so they are also prophets so they can
[9:49] also preach the word
[9:50] and and they can withstand moses
[9:54] they could call him other names uh do
[9:57] whatever they wished
[9:59] and then they also were denying his
[10:02] leadership and his authority over
[10:06] them whatsoever amen
[10:09] praise god my friends the bible
[10:13] tells us cora rose up and
[10:16] withstood moses that means
[10:20] that he hindered or tried to obstruct
[10:25] moses in his path of duty
[10:30] and that is a a horrible
[10:33] an abominable sin in the eyes of god
[10:37] to do his prophet's harm
[10:41] and to hinder his anointed ones
[10:45] in the work that he has ordained for
[10:49] them
[10:50] to do amen now you say well brother
[10:54] simon you said korah
[10:55] and dayton which stood moses how did
[10:58] they
[10:59] withstand them well they would argue
[11:02] with him openly
[11:04] so that the people could hear not
[11:07] privately they'll take him and go
[11:08] discuss
[11:09] with him but that was another matter
[11:12] because they were scared about
[11:14] that the pillar of fire was there oh
[11:17] praise god man that will stand with
[11:21] god's prophet with the purifier standing
[11:24] there
[11:24] that did not want that just like the
[11:27] group up in chicago 400 of them
[11:30] they it's okay they were asking about
[11:32] the serpent see they were asking about
[11:34] this doctrine
[11:36] on one god they were asking him about
[11:39] his doctrine
[11:40] on the ev the towns being the evidence
[11:44] and he was taking god's word
[11:48] and making it clear that
[11:51] these modern day teachings of men
[11:54] so believable to modern society
[11:57] but was not approved or recognized or
[12:01] even
[12:01] known by the apostles the original
[12:05] doctrine of one god hallelujah baptism
[12:10] of the holy spirit
[12:12] by the revelation of the word
[12:16] amen hallelujah knowing him
[12:20] in the power of his resurrection so
[12:24] they were arguing disputing
[12:27] finding uh points of of
[12:30] of doctrine for disputing and
[12:33] denying the authority of this
[12:37] god ordained and god sent prophet just
[12:40] as they are doing today
[12:42] questioning obstructing disputing
[12:47] and denying the his authority
[12:51] and most of all the bible says
[12:54] there were gang saying
[12:58] the game saying of gora
[13:02] now i thought i'd lock this up so i
[13:05] checked checked
[13:06] up on it and i found that gail saying
[13:10] means brenda greek
[13:13] anti-logia anti-logia
[13:18] which means against
[13:21] the word anti-lodia
[13:26] meaning against the word
[13:29] they were gained saying or were
[13:32] against thus saith the lord
[13:36] spoken by the prophet moses
[13:40] they're against god's word and
[13:43] i would say uh personally
[13:47] i want to paraphrase this for our modern
[13:49] age in other words
[13:51] that taking what moses say
[13:54] said and they're taking what this
[13:57] prophet of this 20th century william
[14:00] branham
[14:01] said and twisting it
[14:04] perverting it adding a little hair
[14:08] subtracting a little bit over there
[14:11] rephrasing it
[14:12] right from his message they'll catch a
[14:15] little
[14:16] insight from his message
[14:20] nobody else ever thought of any such a
[14:22] thing
[14:23] before he said it but once he said it
[14:28] the seals are open they grabbed onto it
[14:33] get a little human insight on it
[14:37] rephrase it a bit publicly
[14:41] begin to express uh
[14:44] from it as if it's their great
[14:47] personal revelation or
[14:50] thought or that they had some
[14:53] higher or better understanding
[14:57] then the prophet of this 20th century
[15:01] that is what korah was doing
[15:05] to moses back there in order
[15:10] to twist the tail and to
[15:13] pull the rest of the people under the
[15:17] shadows
[15:18] and darkness of his influence
[15:22] so he added a little hair subtracted a
[15:24] little there
[15:26] just enough to contradict
[15:30] or to belittle the message of his day
[15:34] and of his hour and so do these
[15:37] in this hour contradict the word of god
[15:43] gain say the prophet of malachi 4
[15:47] 5 which not one of them
[15:50] was what stand before him
[15:53] when he was alive and the cat would
[15:57] stand the holy spirit of god
[15:59] even to this hour but personally
[16:03] in him the prophet the things they are
[16:06] saying now
[16:08] they will never say to his face
[16:12] on the basis that the holy spirit
[16:15] will not approve of it
[16:19] if in my own ministry
[16:22] i have literally witnessed after hearing
[16:27] my uh preaching of the word of god
[16:32] man standing before me
[16:35] calling all manner of names
[16:38] saying all manner of things and worst of
[16:42] all
[16:42] beginning to speak against the
[16:46] prophet of the hour following one of
[16:49] my believers and speaking all
[16:52] manner of things against the prophet of
[16:55] this hour
[16:56] and with the police
[17:00] there on the scene watching
[17:03] and listening to the going on the
[17:06] gentleman
[17:07] continued to speak against this prophet
[17:10] against this message and a preacher of
[17:13] this message
[17:15] and suddenly in the midst of it with the
[17:17] police standing there
[17:19] he suddenly went
[17:23] and fell on the ground
[17:26] instant death
[17:29] he died on the spot
[17:33] and the police themselves were scared
[17:36] they moved off the
[17:37] scene and they called for backup they
[17:40] didn't know how to handle it what to do
[17:42] but the point i'm making here
[17:47] these like korra
[17:50] speaking against the message you say oh
[17:53] you're just trying to get me afraid oh
[17:55] you may take it that way but if you
[17:58] continue
[17:59] down that path it's the past of
[18:01] destruction and blasphemy
[18:04] it's the past you're against saying
[18:07] against the word of god
[18:09] turn around turn around god is
[18:12] calling calling you from that life of
[18:16] wasted years
[18:17] back to the word back to christ back to
[18:20] this
[18:21] hour stand by the promise until the
[18:24] crown you
[18:25] gain god didn't ask you do you
[18:27] understand
[18:28] it all yes do you believe it
[18:31] hallelujah praise god i never fully
[18:34] understand
[18:36] the teachings on the serpent seed
[18:40] and this or that my friend but
[18:43] i knew there was something back there
[18:46] that spoke to my soul that caused me to
[18:50] recognize from the deep in my heart
[18:53] that this was the thus saith the lord
[18:56] that it is absolutely the truth not some
[19:00] man explaining it to me not some man
[19:03] paraphrasing parsing
[19:05] or are you arguing debating or bringing
[19:08] his logic
[19:09] to bear persuading no it was not by the
[19:13] persuasions of
[19:14] man but by the revelation of the holy
[19:17] ghost
[19:17] may the lord god grant you the same
[19:20] thing here tonight
[19:21] for his glory and for his honor glory to
[19:24] god hallelujah
[19:25] amen others may be able
[19:29] to take this word of god
[19:32] and logically beautifully
[19:36] be able to declare it with scholarship
[19:40] with knowledge with all manner of
[19:44] human means my friends like a lawyer
[19:48] to be able to disprove or prove
[19:52] but my friends when my heart
[19:55] begins to beat and i feel the
[19:58] inspiration and the pulsation of the
[20:02] blessed holy
[20:03] spirit within me i can't help it
[20:06] but become emotional in my expressions
[20:10] of this promise of this day and for this
[20:14] hour because it's real to me and i can
[20:17] see it
[20:18] clearly in the word of god may god help
[20:21] you
[20:21] that you may also see it in the word of
[20:24] god
[20:25] you will see if you want to see
[20:28] if you don't want to see then of course
[20:30] you'll blind your eyes and you'll
[20:32] you'll stop your feet you'll walk away
[20:35] you'll
[20:35] stop your ears you would want to hear
[20:39] amen because jesus said it they see
[20:42] and they see not and they're those that
[20:44] will hear
[20:45] just outward ear here and yet they hear
[20:48] not they understand not oh my
[20:52] praise god hallelujah amen
[20:56] even though it was
[21:00] moses that was leading them
[21:03] receiving manna from the heavens
[21:06] spiritual food in due season
[21:09] receiving quail from the heavens god
[21:12] feeding them leading them guiding them
[21:16] they could see the vindication
[21:20] of god back of this man
[21:24] called moses in our day
[21:27] the entire world can see
[21:31] in the life and ministry of william
[21:34] marion branham
[21:36] the inspiration the vindication of
[21:40] god being back of that man
[21:44] was not just the man but god
[21:47] was back of him and that has been
[21:49] vindicated
[21:51] and is still being vindicated in
[21:54] this day and in this hour that he's the
[21:57] same
[21:58] yesterday today and forever i am the
[22:01] lord that
[22:02] changeth not amen praise god hallelujah
[22:07] amen praise god so we see it my dear
[22:11] friends
[22:13] this same spirit of korah which
[22:17] is a spirit of rebellion
[22:21] the spirit of rebellion in man
[22:24] the same spirit that was in satan up in
[22:28] heaven
[22:29] to rebel against god and try to
[22:33] raise up and have a ministry like that
[22:36] prophet and lucifer trained to
[22:40] have a leadership and ministry like the
[22:43] god of heaven
[22:44] and he was kicked out into outer
[22:47] darkness
[22:48] where he still is today as the prince of
[22:52] darkness
[22:53] wishing that you will never believe in
[22:56] such a person as satan
[22:58] wishing that you would never believe in
[23:01] evil spirits and demons being
[23:04] in the background whispering peeping
[23:07] murmuring
[23:08] complaining or analyzing debating
[23:11] power doing all manner of evil seducing
[23:15] deluding creating illusions
[23:18] of the mind and the poisoning of the
[23:20] mind
[23:21] drawing man away from christ and away
[23:24] from the
[23:24] word of god for this day and for this
[23:27] hour
[23:27] but thank god yes promise he always will
[23:31] have
[23:32] his faithful few will stand by the
[23:35] truth and the word of god until they
[23:38] gain the crown that was promised to them
[23:41] in the word of god
[23:44] now they tried to show up moses
[23:49] they tried to preach a message that
[23:51] appears to be
[23:52] better smoother more logical
[23:56] more scholastic that they could present
[24:00] to the people
[24:02] and do you know many ran after them
[24:06] after hearing seeing
[24:09] the vindication that flowed out
[24:12] of the life of malachi 4
[24:16] 5 the prophet of this hour
[24:19] william marion branham the servant of
[24:23] the
[24:23] most high god who is present
[24:26] here with us in this day and in this
[24:30] hour amen remains the same
[24:35] he does not change and he's alive
[24:38] forevermore
[24:39] praise god hallelujah and so
[24:43] many leaders followed quora
[24:47] away from moses the prophet
[24:50] and so in our day many
[24:54] are following these smooth
[24:57] uh you know beautiful
[25:01] handsome well-spoken
[25:05] a presentation masterful
[25:08] my goodness they have all of the
[25:12] different angles of
[25:15] being photogenic they have all the
[25:18] actions all the gestures or everything
[25:21] that is necessary
[25:23] perfect even their speech is perfect
[25:26] no eyes and um hallelujahs and
[25:30] amen and these kinds of
[25:33] primitive kind of christianity behavior
[25:36] no they are schooled they are
[25:40] so systematized that they are caught up
[25:44] in the world of human ingenuity and
[25:47] education
[25:48] and the logical way of doing things
[25:53] now and so these
[25:57] followed the way of quora
[26:00] similar to a lot of the evangelists
[26:03] today and they came up
[26:07] with the golden calf scheme which they
[26:11] presented to
[26:12] aaron and caused the great
[26:16] uh destruction in the wilderness
[26:20] when the earth which is a type of world
[26:23] and worldliness opened up and swallowed
[26:27] an entire bunch of them
[26:30] but they deny the power thereof
[26:34] they disputed against the word of god
[26:37] they
[26:38] withstood and argued against their
[26:41] message of their
[26:42] hour like some are doing today
[26:44] discussing and arguing and proving
[26:47] against this hour spending thousands of
[26:50] dollars
[26:51] rather to win souls they're spending
[26:54] thousands of dollars to make many souls
[26:57] they twofold tenfold more
[27:01] the children of hell may god help us
[27:04] today
[27:05] may god send heavenly sunshine
[27:09] light from above to break up the
[27:12] darkness
[27:13] that is around you and around
[27:16] anyone that will hear the word of god
[27:20] the voice of god in this hour this
[27:23] ministry
[27:27] is just the fruit of brother
[27:30] branham's ministry this ministry
[27:36] is off of the same tree
[27:39] it is after the same kind it is after
[27:42] the same
[27:43] seed oh my it may not express things the
[27:48] way he did
[27:48] it the way god called him placed him
[27:51] that is his position his pulse
[27:53] and none can take his place there's only
[27:57] one messenger to this church age and
[28:00] any church age and the rest that follows
[28:04] are only sons daughters and
[28:07] other under shepherds
[28:10] and servants of the five-fold ministry
[28:13] and servants of the most high god that
[28:16] are just
[28:16] fulfilling their task in the
[28:20] in the light of this day and of this
[28:22] hour
[28:24] and we have faced today
[28:27] with the same thing moses face
[28:31] leaders following korra
[28:35] like the evangelists today
[28:39] back there they formed the golden calf
[28:43] so they can
[28:44] have all the people bringing their their
[28:47] gold their
[28:47] silver all their money is there and
[28:51] casting it before their feet
[28:54] and oh they're in their glory
[28:57] because people in this day they're
[28:59] throwing
[29:01] money they're trying jewelry they're
[29:03] bringing their dollars and
[29:05] sharing it upon them they take
[29:08] that to be a vindication of their
[29:11] ministry
[29:12] so called but that's
[29:15] nothing but a golden calf scheme
[29:19] and we have tons of them with these
[29:22] golden calf schemes
[29:26] my friends they look good to people
[29:31] just like korra looked really good
[29:35] religious like quora appeared to be
[29:40] korah was even quoting moses
[29:44] oh like the serpent quoted god himself
[29:47] did not god say
[29:49] so so so and then turn around
[29:52] but and then he gave his interpretation
[29:55] of what he thought it was and denying
[29:59] and disputing
[30:01] against the very word of god and yet
[30:04] he had multitudes following him
[30:07] because he appeared to look good
[30:10] sound good oh and it was to
[30:14] their modern intellectual
[30:18] and perverted twisted taste
[30:22] and so they accepted him
[30:25] but usually my friends
[30:28] these are really spiritual
[30:32] vultures that are trying to
[30:36] pose as if they are eagles because you
[30:40] know
[30:40] in the sky when they are very far
[30:43] up in the sky if you're not watching
[30:46] carefully
[30:47] you will mistake a vulture for an eagle
[30:51] but really a vulture cannot fly as high
[30:54] as an eagle
[30:56] he'll break up because of he can't stand
[30:59] the
[31:00] spiritual pressure that it takes to go
[31:03] into those realms
[31:05] but here we find
[31:08] modern-day evangelists of this message
[31:12] outside of the message in the message of
[31:14] this hour
[31:16] spiritual vultures trying to look
[31:20] like an eagle but the difference is they
[31:24] have different
[31:25] appetites one will
[31:28] partake only of the fresh
[31:32] killed revelation of the word of god the
[31:36] meat
[31:36] of god for this day and for this hour
[31:40] while the other is living off
[31:44] of the carrion of the
[31:48] rotten carrion of history
[31:52] the rotten carrion of man's
[31:55] theology church teaching seminarianism
[32:00] all these things oh my friends they're
[32:03] living off of their past
[32:06] and of the past things is what they're
[32:09] feeding on
[32:10] with the spirit and hunger and thirst
[32:14] of a vulture while the eagle wants
[32:17] nothing but the red meat of the fullness
[32:21] of the word of god is dripping with
[32:24] blood
[32:24] it's dripping with blood this holy ghost
[32:27] gospel
[32:28] is tripping with blood or praise god
[32:31] there is no salvation there is no
[32:34] redemption
[32:35] there is no token there is nothing no
[32:39] deliverance
[32:40] without the blood of jesus for the
[32:43] life is in the blood hallelujah
[32:46] only by the blood are we set free
[32:50] by the great holy spirit hallelujah
[32:53] amen oh thank god for the blood
[32:56] i know it was the blood i said i know it
[33:00] was the blood
[33:01] it was the blood and is the blood that
[33:04] sets us free
[33:05] and washes us white as snow yes sir
[33:09] they like vultures
[33:12] and you know vultures they're not real
[33:15] hunters they ask avengers
[33:19] they'll wait for the prophet to go
[33:23] and get that that spiritual
[33:26] kill bring out the revelation
[33:30] interpretation manifestation out of the
[33:34] word
[33:36] and then they will come after
[33:41] and feeding on that
[33:44] getting straight from it getting
[33:46] insights from
[33:47] it getting directions from it
[33:50] then go out with their partial
[33:54] understanding and go out with their
[33:56] partial
[33:58] private insights and begin to oppose
[34:03] deny and dispute and
[34:07] gain say against the very
[34:10] word of god that gave them their very
[34:13] life at that particular time
[34:15] so their spiritual scavengers
[34:18] of the word of this hour
[34:23] not only that but they are also
[34:27] parasites they don't have that prophetic
[34:31] insight
[34:32] but they are parasites
[34:36] amen now you know what a parasite is
[34:39] it's like a blood sucker a parasite is
[34:41] like
[34:42] um what do you call them um
[34:45] those bugs anyway you can take the word
[34:49] and
[34:50] break that down they're parasites to
[34:52] give you one example
[34:53] there is a beautiful plant called orchid
[34:57] but there is a type of orchid that their
[35:00] existence
[35:02] is not in the ground it's not like that
[35:04] drawing their own strength
[35:06] but they make it their business
[35:09] to be in a large tree
[35:14] and they draw their life from that tree
[35:19] they're in the jungles they're in the
[35:21] bushes
[35:23] orchids beautiful beautiful ministries
[35:26] beautiful men
[35:28] so-called beautiful women are even
[35:31] preaching and teaching
[35:33] and they will claim that they're sent
[35:36] from god
[35:38] oh and they'll talk about william
[35:40] branham
[35:41] what a powerful preacher he was what how
[35:44] god used him
[35:46] but you see that's nothing but a
[35:48] parasite
[35:49] that's living off of that ministry
[35:53] which it turns around and tries to kill
[35:57] it turns around tries to deny it dispute
[36:00] it
[36:01] gains say it and then on the other hand
[36:04] trying to use it as a launching pad for
[36:08] their own life
[36:09] oh my friends let us see the evil works
[36:13] and deceptions of satan parasites
[36:18] tree orchids living off of the life
[36:22] of the original plant
[36:25] of the word of god twisters
[36:28] of what he has said so many i have met
[36:33] or said oh random said the world is
[36:36] going to end in 1977
[36:38] he said no such thing he prophesied it
[36:44] when the angel of god said untime shall
[36:47] be
[36:48] no more they do not understand that time
[36:53] he was not speaking of the end of the
[36:55] world
[36:56] that was the end of the church ages
[36:59] being announced that the church ages
[37:04] have come at that time were coming
[37:07] to their end and that's all he was
[37:10] announcing
[37:11] they don't go on where he says well um
[37:14] i don't know it could be 75 years 100
[37:18] years it could
[37:20] i don't know but this is how i felt when
[37:23] i was in the vision
[37:25] amen uh there will come with little
[37:28] things like that and try to twist it
[37:31] and pervert it and pervert the minds of
[37:34] many
[37:35] away from the word of god that is just
[37:38] one
[37:38] i won't go into the other but many other
[37:40] things they will point to
[37:42] and make all kinds of remarks with no
[37:44] understanding
[37:46] whatsoever trying to lead people
[37:50] instead of leading the persons to
[37:52] salvation
[37:53] they're leading them to destruction and
[37:56] away
[37:57] from the tree of life amen no
[38:00] parasites amen
[38:04] perverts of the word and most of them
[38:07] become also
[38:08] parrots because they have no
[38:11] revelation that god will give them
[38:17] so all they can do is study what the
[38:20] prophet of god said
[38:22] and all they can do is quote
[38:25] continuously and continually what he
[38:28] said
[38:28] and they hide behind the veil of saying
[38:32] oh i'm only saying what he said
[38:36] oh my so i'll stay with the law
[38:39] by reading it when i get into court
[38:43] i will not have any insight i will not
[38:46] have any discretion
[38:47] in looking at the situation and knowing
[38:51] how to apply the law or how to apply
[38:55] the token for that moment that situation
[38:58] and that problem in this day
[39:01] this time this moment this hour
[39:04] god is calling men and women children of
[39:08] his
[39:09] to break into the life of christ
[39:12] that he might work through them and
[39:15] reveal
[39:15] to them the word of god for this day
[39:19] and for this hour perverters of the word
[39:23] pirates of the word of god
[39:28] they just know how to compare quotes
[39:30] compare scripture
[39:32] with scripture like that with no
[39:35] revelation
[39:36] whatsoever oh my you know
[39:39] a man eats the it's a meeting a dog eats
[39:43] meat so a man
[39:44] is a dog no doesn't work like that it
[39:47] sounds logical but it's
[39:48] not true and we don't go just by the
[39:51] comparison of scripture comparison of
[39:54] cults comparison of texts but we
[39:56] certainly allow the holy spirit
[39:59] to lead us and guide us as it
[40:03] as he has done to
[40:06] real servants of god regardless of what
[40:09] church
[40:10] what group what denomination whatever
[40:12] they are
[40:13] that god will speak and use them for his
[40:16] glory
[40:17] with us divine spirit of divine
[40:20] revelation
[40:22] inspiration and anointing are the holy
[40:25] ghost
[40:25] and they cannot be denied
[40:28] because it's the word of god hallelujah
[40:32] amen if god can work trucka hyphas
[40:35] if god my friends can use any person he
[40:39] chooses to use
[40:40] if god could use a donkey god can use
[40:43] whoever he wants
[40:44] amen and dare you to come against that
[40:47] you stay
[40:48] right where you are and said oh i don't
[40:51] understand
[40:52] or i don't know what it's all about i
[40:55] can't figure it out
[40:56] but leave it alone and shut your mouth
[41:01] don't say anything but the moment you
[41:04] begin to
[41:05] speak against what god is doing
[41:09] be it in a child be it in a donkey
[41:13] be it in a man who you think is
[41:15] uneducated
[41:17] unlearned not schooled in your colleges
[41:20] your bible schools and your seminaries
[41:23] you'd better be careful for god
[41:27] works in mysterious ways god
[41:30] hides and reveals himself
[41:34] in the most unusual places
[41:37] an old prophet coming up the road with a
[41:39] gnarled stick looks like a nobody and
[41:42] nothing and yet that man was the man
[41:45] that had
[41:46] power over the entire all of egypt amen
[41:50] let us be careful how we walk how we
[41:53] live
[41:54] and what is our spiritual perception
[41:57] given to us by the great holy spirit
[42:01] of the living god yes
[42:04] lots of these modern day preachers
[42:08] modern day churches and churchianity
[42:12] nothing but impersonators
[42:17] carnal opportunists
[42:20] to the word of god copycats
[42:26] compromises of the word of god
[42:30] listen they even allow
[42:34] amen women preachers
[42:38] in the church oh brother simon now
[42:40] you've got my attention
[42:42] are you preaching against women
[42:44] preaching
[42:45] in the church i am preaching the word of
[42:48] god
[42:49] listen first timothy
[42:52] chapter 2 verse 12
[42:57] listen what the word of god says
[43:00] but i suffer not
[43:05] a woman to teach
[43:09] nor to your serp authority
[43:14] over the man
[43:17] but to be in silence oh but brother
[43:20] simon we have a lot of
[43:22] female bible teachers and they're good
[43:24] teachers of the world well i don't deny
[43:27] that some of them are better preachers
[43:28] than men
[43:29] uh some of them are better uh i have
[43:32] more insight more understanding than
[43:34] even man
[43:36] but that has nothing to do with it
[43:38] simple
[43:40] humble obedience to the word of god
[43:44] is what god is requiring and asking for
[43:48] and regardless of whether talented
[43:50] gifted whether having this or that god
[43:52] said i mean satan was gifted lucifer was
[43:55] the most gifted but yet god kicked him
[43:58] out
[43:58] and even so god says but i suffer
[44:02] not not is definitive
[44:06] i suffer not a woman to
[44:09] teach all these so-called bible teachers
[44:13] wonderful god uh i tell you that
[44:16] they're fantastic in their teaching
[44:18] their explanations
[44:20] they they their layouts and it's
[44:22] marvelous to catch your attention
[44:24] but it's contrary to the word of the
[44:27] living god
[44:28] contrary for thou shalt not suffer
[44:33] a woman to teach nor to usurp authority
[44:38] over the man but to be in silence
[44:42] because teaching with man in the
[44:46] congregate i won't teach on this
[44:48] now i'm just passing
[44:51] presupposes that the teacher that's
[44:54] teaching that word
[44:56] has authority over those that are
[44:59] listening or hearing the word he has
[45:02] some authority to preach the word
[45:05] a woman has authority to teach her
[45:08] children
[45:09] a woman has authority to teach
[45:15] in a school a woman has authority to
[45:18] teach under various conditions
[45:19] but in this particular condition of
[45:22] preaching
[45:23] their word she shall
[45:26] not teach and the
[45:30] bible says it but the preachers will
[45:33] preach it
[45:35] because they believe it will damage
[45:36] their ministry it will get the
[45:39] the women to rise up against them for
[45:41] saying the truth of the word of god
[45:44] and all they're doing is not giving
[45:46] their opinion i'm not giving my opinion
[45:49] all i'm giving you is what it says here
[45:51] in first
[45:52] timothy chapter 2
[45:56] verse 12. oh you can have all your
[46:00] arguments you'd like against it
[46:02] but it still stands she shall not
[46:05] teach the usurp authority she shall
[46:08] not teach nor you serp authority but
[46:11] so-and-so
[46:12] she shall not teach it doesn't matter
[46:15] my friends she shall not teach for that
[46:18] is
[46:18] the word of our god that lives forever
[46:22] and cannot change and will not lie
[46:26] and these are the preachers with their
[46:27] golden calf schemes
[46:30] they'll open the church doors and have
[46:32] all kinds of people and
[46:34] women come in and give them post
[46:37] positions and elevate them and
[46:39] please them give them great names
[46:41] missionaryness
[46:42] deaconness that and uh all manner of
[46:46] names
[46:47] they'll give them to let them be puffed
[46:50] up with their
[46:51] religious position posts and and
[46:54] missionaries and missionary
[46:56] that it's not in the word it's not there
[46:59] that can accompany paul accompany peter
[47:02] go somewhere right there you'll never
[47:05] find it in this
[47:06] bible where god used them to go preach
[47:09] the word
[47:10] of god oh my here
[47:13] come on later these ones
[47:17] will allow women preachers
[47:21] allow women to go cut their hair
[47:24] i won't even bother to give you the
[47:26] scripture for that where the bible tells
[47:28] you clearly
[47:29] the hair is a woman's glory she should
[47:32] not cut off her hair where
[47:36] they'll see it in the bible but they
[47:39] won't preach it
[47:40] it'll make that congregation people will
[47:43] leave their churches and
[47:45] they won't have those thousands of
[47:47] people anymore they
[47:48] they wouldn't have the greater influence
[47:51] they have anymore
[47:52] so they will not touch that even though
[47:55] the bible says it
[47:58] she they'll they'll allow the women to
[48:01] waltz
[48:02] up the the middle eye of their church
[48:04] wearing slacks
[48:07] if at least not maybe shorts i've
[48:10] literally seen them in bathing suits but
[48:13] uh
[48:13] my friends right in the church
[48:16] and they'll allow them to walls up to
[48:19] the front with a
[48:20] tight pair of slacks on oh no i don't
[48:23] wear those spare sucks i wear gauchos i
[48:26] wear this i wear that
[48:27] but god's word speaks clearly
[48:31] in deuteronomy 22 5
[48:35] where the bible tells us
[48:39] the woman shall not
[48:42] wear that which pertain it
[48:45] unto a man neither shall a man
[48:50] put on women's garments
[48:54] for all that do so are a
[48:57] curse they are an abomination
[49:00] unto the lord thy god god is saying
[49:04] how would you like it if your husband
[49:06] starts wearing a dress
[49:08] but but it's okay for the woman to turn
[49:11] around and wear
[49:12] man's clothing no the bible says she
[49:16] shall not wear that which
[49:19] pertains to man for it's an abomination
[49:23] in the eyes of the living god let me
[49:25] repeat so you may read it for yourself
[49:27] that it's in your bible but teachings
[49:31] like that
[49:32] the preachers will not preach it because
[49:34] the people don't want to hear it
[49:36] and their churches are people are going
[49:38] to leave their churches
[49:40] and they're going to sin out like that
[49:42] they don't want to preach about the
[49:44] serpent seed
[49:45] about adultery in the garden what eve
[49:48] did
[49:48] in the garden they'll tell you she ate
[49:50] an apple or an ice apple
[49:52] or she ate a pineapple or she had a pear
[49:56] yeah it might be it might have been a
[49:58] pear not not the pear in the tree but a
[50:00] pear
[50:00] on the ground and a child's cane was
[50:03] born from it whom god cursed
[50:06] oh my god think of the hour that we're
[50:08] living in how far
[50:10] have we drifted away from the truths and
[50:13] the fullness
[50:14] of the word of god back to the word amen
[50:17] hallelujah
[50:18] glory to god amen yes sir
[50:21] they bypass the word of god and it only
[50:24] shows
[50:26] what kind of seed is in them
[50:30] for if there's a seed of god in there
[50:33] that seed is a part of god himself and
[50:36] is eternal as god is eternal
[50:38] and it can never deny god dispute
[50:42] god it cannot say something
[50:45] different from what god says for that
[50:48] seed
[50:50] is a part of him after his
[50:54] kind it cannot do it amen
[50:57] they'll stay with the word of god
[51:00] hallelujah
[51:01] amen but these
[51:04] they'll turn away from the word of god
[51:08] like some of jesus's disciples in john
[51:10] chapter 6
[51:11] verse 6-6 when he said eat my flesh
[51:14] drink my blood
[51:15] they don't understand it they didn't
[51:17] realize what he was talking about
[51:20] and so they left him oh my think of
[51:23] it he only had 120 to go up into the
[51:26] upper room
[51:27] and out of the 800 or so disciples he
[51:30] had
[51:30] all the rest of them left him and he
[51:32] ended up with
[51:33] 120 in the upper room because they
[51:37] could not stand the word of god oh
[51:40] but jesus said for the rest of you
[51:43] will you also go away and he said lord
[51:46] where are else we going to go
[51:48] thou hast the words of eternal life
[51:51] they stood by the unshakable
[51:54] rock revelation of the word of god
[51:57] hallelujah they live by the word of god
[52:00] they
[52:01] moved by the word of god or they just
[52:03] stood
[52:04] upon the promises of christ their king
[52:08] amen praise god glory to god hallelujah
[52:12] my friends the same is happening today
[52:16] some are leaving the word and some are
[52:18] staying with the word of god
[52:20] and it's happening in this hour
[52:23] that many
[52:27] are leaving as jesus said
[52:30] in this parable of the wheat and
[52:34] of the tears how that the tears
[52:38] are to be bundled and i believe that
[52:41] bundling
[52:42] uniting of those denominational spirits
[52:46] and systems
[52:47] are in progress right now
[52:51] but while they're bundling amen
[52:54] for the burning we are gathering
[52:57] for glory we are being gathered up
[53:01] in the weak harvest time when the holy
[53:05] spirit is gathering gold and
[53:08] grain ripe and ready for the master's
[53:12] hand
[53:13] oh glory to god hallelujah
[53:16] oh praise god i thank god we are not
[53:19] here just by chance but we are here
[53:23] by the end time promise god's end time
[53:27] promise
[53:28] we believe in that promise of the coming
[53:32] of the elijah spirit according to the
[53:35] prophecy of
