========================================
[Music] good evening my dear friends it's good to be in the house of the lord once again today's study will be the throne of the red dragon the red dragon strong may god bless us as we study this in the word of god this is not a story this is not mythology this is reality from the word of god i will encourage you my brothers and sisters and dear friends who are watching around the world on these wednesday nights in particular if you will have a a notebook and pen or pencil and make some notes to keep for yourself as it will be of great use to you and a blessing to your heart and life now and later in the future when you wish to refer back to some of these things so may god help us and bless us tonight as we look into the word of god tonight's reading will be from revelation chapter 2 reading from verse 12 to 13 and to the angel of the church in bergamos right these things saint he which had the sharp sword with two edges i know thy works and where thou dwellest even where satan's seat is and that thou holdest fast my name and has not denied my faith even in those days wherein antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where satan dwelleth amen praise be to our god our gracious father we ask your greatest and most wonderful blessings upon us we ask the great holy spirit will cause us to be prolific an expression of the word of god to the hearts minds lives of your dear wonderful people may the spirit of the living god take control of this earthly vessel that eternity can express itself through time and that the heirs of man can hear or discern the spirit of god taking the word and breaking the bread of life once again not by galilee but to you and me that our eyes may be open to see what thou has for your people in this hour for we ask it in the name of jesus christ amen and amen praise god hallelujah now we are speaking of the throne of the red dragon the bible of course expresses it thou dwellest where satan's seat is now this throne of the red dragon or satan is a throne of blood it's a throne of idolatry and it's a throne of polytheism it is also a throne of satanic worship thanks be to god for his wonderful elect his brave soldiers who fought against satan and overcame him right in the midst of his own throne room where he dwelt at that time they won the battle through the mighty name of jesus christ and by faith in the word of god that was made known to them and right in the middle of the camp of the prince of darkness they were able to overcome and win a marvelous and wonderful victory my dear brothers and sisters and so you can in the midst of the surrounding enveloping darkness of this day and of this hour we have this not only comfort but encouragement and strength and assurance to know glory to god that we can overcome and defeat satan in the midst of the darkness that he has created hallelujah what a tremendous commendation to god's people that we will and can and are overcoming right in this day and in this hour reminds me so much of david's mighty men when they cut their way through the the walls of the enemy to bring a drink of water back to david there to quench his thirst those men were giants of of the faith they were heroes mighty men of david who invaded the realms of the philistines at that time type of us who invades the atmosphere and uh you know the the territory of satan and defeat him on his own grounds to be able to preach and to exhort and to warn and to bring the people to jesus christ right in the middle of satan's cities kingdoms uh rooms wherever he has them that we can bring the word of god and bring out his captives out of their prisons bring them out of bondage out of habits out of sicknesses out of fear out of doubts out of denominational confusion chaos we can bring them out by the clear crystallized truth of the word of god that they themselves can see we have nothing to prove we have nothing to analyze and debate about we have nothing to have religious strife over force truth is stated truth or it's the truth or it's not the truth and we know that we have thus said the lord which is the truth from the very word of the living god amen hallelujah praise god hallelujah even though we live under the very shadows of death yet we know we have god's goodness and mercy walking with us on our right hand and our left hand protected from behind and before from the arrows by flood that fly by night the attacks we can't see and the arrows that come at us by day the ones we can see god defends us for the lord of battle israel is his name the lord of shabbat is his name the lord of hosts and of armies is his name and we are a part of that army of the most high living and mighty god the greater moya amen naomi praise god hallelujah the names of god as brother branham said the mighty god who moves like the wind the mighty god of the lightning and the thunder oh praise god that no wonder when the seals broke seventh thunders utter their voices for the voice of god is like the thunder across the plains amen may the glory and honor of the living god speak to us his words amen praise god hallelujah so god honors his people when they overcome satan living and battling satan in the very realm where he is and that's where we are for he is the god of this evil age he is the prince of darkness he is my friends lord of the flies and the lord of lies also and god has empowered us elected us to live in this hour in this age because of his confidence in us that we are able to overcome with god's help and defeat satan in the name of jesus and through the testimony of the word and the living blood of christ which is the holy spirit amen praise god amen hallelujah now my friends we find that evil has gained a lot of supremacy within the church of the living god now we find in this uh church age of pergamos the bible describes pergamos as the seat where satan dwellers wear his throne or the throne of the red dragon is so many phrases have been used and uh may god help us to marshal our powers of descriptive force to cause you to see to know and to realize what the great holy spirit is trying to convey to us and teach us by the unfolding of the word of god now we know that real history bears out this fact that pergamos was indeed the place of satan's throne and dwelling place now if you can remember some lessons ago i mentioned about how in pergamos it was the seat of escopalis which was the which was a serpent god they had a literal serpent in the temple and they would feed the serpent and they would worship that serpent and that serpent type of satan was their god now it's done in that way that the people are worshiping the serpent not realizing they're really worshiping the spirit that is behind that serpent which was and is satan himself so out of pergamus came this satanic serpent worship of mixed with sex and sin and that origin of course was originally from babylon and then came the pergamos for if we were to read in our bibles genesis chapter 10 verses 8 to 10 please write that down or note it we find in there that the bible tells us of the rise of nimrod and how he became a mighty one in the earth and was a mighty hunter before the lord also you would like to read genesis chapter 11 verses 1 to 9 and there you will have more information about that now he was the founder of bay bell see the bible says that he founded a bay bell and you know in the bible that's where the people decided to become one type of what's happening with the denominational council study coming into a one world government church you know and so they were doing that at that time in type or in shadow and god came down and confused the towns amen from one tongue he confused the tongues where they could not understand one another oh my there we find but of course babel is the original name of babylon babel of course means confusion it means chaos and there that was literally started by cush the son of him and was brought to a place and kingdom of power and notoriety and grandeur by his son cushy's son nimrod he was the mighty honda of genesis 11. we understand from profane history that nimrod had three ambitions in his heart one to build a strong nation that he could be master and leader of and to propagate his own religion separate from the religion of god that was already existent of one god he desired to propagate his own religion in opposition to god's faith certainly he wanted to make a great name for himself you see satan always wants to copy god to be like god to raise up himself in pride that he could be a god and he can be the god and all of that that is always his ambition and i would say this he is so dumb so stupid that he decreed creation is trying to overcome his creator he the one that is limited is trying to overcome the unlimited omnipotent omniscient mighty god to this day in this hour he will not learn his lesson but in obstinates the rebellion and pharsetical stupidity he is at this hour still rebelling resisting against the purposes and plans of the living god now at babylon this religion gained prominence and so much that in later years when daniel saw it was described as the head of gold among the various nations and it took place it took over the entire world his entire religious system described of write this down isaiah chapter 14 revelations chapters 17 and 18. in this bible god calls that mystery babylon back there it was literal babylon the city of babylon but now it has morphed and gone under cover and raising and rares up the red angry figure of the red dragon now raises up in the form of a church or churches dripping with inquisitory blood and here we find my brother sister the bible describes this as mystery babylon the harlot oh god have mercy upon us search the scriptures read your bible study those scriptures which i have and am giving unto you to check this out for yourself now history can prove that he invaded the whole world and that was the basis of every system of idolatry in the world today it is also the seam of all mythology that we may read about originates because this babylonian pagan religion invaded the entire world and though the names of the gods may differ in different lands among different nations it's the same evil god given a different name on the different tribes different languages different cultures but it's the same satan and the same god the same red dragon rearing his ugly and evil head this monster of sin and evil that lurks behind the scene tries to even create the atmosphere that he doesn't have exist tries to create the atmosphere as if he's not there these things are just happening evil had just taken place sicknesses pain trouble trial temptation seductions deceptions they all taken place the lukewarmness of the church the dying of the church the chaos confusion of denominationalism all these things it's just happening it's just confusion i tell you my friends in the name of jesus christ and by the word of god that there is an evil personality lurking behind the scenes there's a puppet master so devilishly evil that he is able to jerk the chains and move the strings of the puppets that he has seduced and induced to do his his evil will of course was able to make a name for himself and that will keep going on name name names blasphemous names various names he makes a name for himself and that will continue until our joseph our jesus comes again to reveal himself to his brethren which he is doing by the word and so satan will be honored and worshiped in these temples so-called churches of his and honored under a different name than nimrod they won't call him nimrod you'll instantly recognize it but it's easy for them to do what they did in 325 a.d when the babylonian and roman priests changed the names of the various gods janus jehovah yes change the names uh and we'll go into that later on but here my friends is being worshipped in temples different or from which he originally started because you see now the temples have modernized his places of worship has modernized and his form of idolatrous satanic worship continues but is now disguised under various forms of so-called christianity now it's going to be necessary for us to look at some ancient uh records to find out the answer of how pergamos became the seat of the satanic religion of babylon and the major sources for that will be found in egyptian records and grecian records you look into ancient egyptian records and into greek culture and you will be able to see this stream of black evil power of satan in operation now we realize that egypt received har mathematics science and so on from the chaldeans let me repeat the egyptians received their sciences mathematics and stuff from the chaldeans and greek the greek grecians in turn received their mathematics their sciences all coming from egypt it did not originate in europe it did not originate in such a place but they actually received it from in egypt now the priests of course were the ones who were teaching sciences actually as a part of religion so that is one of the reasons also why the babylonians religion gained strength because they're teaching religion and under religion they were also teaching science mathematics and all kinds of other isms in there along with faith and because of that we know that anytime one nation overcame another nation the religion of the conqueror became the religion of those that were conquered and that is how he was able to transform his false faith his false religion with its various built-in systems contrary to the word and rebellion to the word of god using it to transfer his religion from nation to nation and it is from this my brothers and sisters that the present world system and its so-called civilization that has spread throughout the world all its culture originated from exactly where i have told you all the babylon to this day and to this time where the foundations of the systems laws culture civilization so-called came from now it is well known that the greeks had the signs of the zodiac but they got that because it came from the babylonians originally and it was found in ancient egypt the zodiac was found in ancient egypt that knowledge and religious knowledge and natural knowledge was transferred from egypt into greece all the theories dear realms geometrical sciences this that it all came out from egypt who got it from babylon and then it was transferred into greece and all the rest of europe and now it is all over the world as civilization and as culture so-called but the origin is babylon in rebellion to god and his word led by nimrod who is not now here in the flesh but the same spirit that animated him and encouraged him to do what he did then is still here now the red still exists the god of war the god with a troll of blood and evil is still here among us working behind the scenes princes of darkness powers of the air oh lord of god but praise god we know from the word of god we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and the spiritual wickedness in high places all these territorial spirits that control cities towns villages nations we are here with the name of jesus christ the power of god and the holy spirit to break the chains that satan has put across these places and these peoples and set them free we have the power we have the power by the grace of god to accomplish this in his great and glorious name amen so the egyptians got it to repetition the the egyptians got their religion got their cultures got their sciences all from babylon then the greeks got it from the egyptians religion sciences culture so-called civilization all out of egypt of course they reshaped it reformed it into their style of it but the origin remained the same now these mysteries of babylon through the instrumentality of the nations that they conquered began to spread and before long the red dragon raised his head rared his head up in rome it spread and reared in india then again the red dragon raised his head whipped his tail around and there he was in china yes satan moved even into north america and south america and mound the peoples of these lands and they worship remains the same the same basic worship they may use different names and different ways of doing things but the basic foundations remains the same now ancient histories agrees with the bible that the babylonian religion was not the original religion that was there it was in rebellion to the original faith that was there amongst the earth's earliest peoples certainly historians like wilkinson historians like malay they have proven conclusively from ancient documents that at one time all the peoples of all the entire earth believed in only one god one god who was is supreme eternal invisible and now i say indivisible oh praise god hallelujah so the original faith was the belief and faith in one god eternal supreme so the babylonians were the first nimrod was the first to drift away from the original faith that existed among peoples upon the earth at that particular time satan is a corrupt being and everything he touches becomes corrupt and so he began with the corruption of the hearts and minds of men so that he can get them to reject the truth of god's holy word he tried to draw worship away from god and to bring that worship to himself acting as if he is god he wanted to draw it to himself wanted to exalt himself just like nimrod did want to make a name for himself uh yes and he he did accomplish his desire because he has been able to spread his religion into the whole world listen what the book of romans says when they knew god they glorified him not as god until they became vain in their imaginations and through darkness of the heart they accepted a corrupt religion oh my became vain in their imaginations and satan got them to accept a false faith a false religion and they began to worship creatures things snakes birds fishes trees rocks to this day there are still sane people people who claim they're intelligent under the system of babylon and they claim their intelligence and they're bowing down to rocks carves wood bowing down to a car whether it's a jewel or a diamond or whatever it doesn't matter what it is it's a rock and they worship such a thing contrary to the will of god making it so fashionable so beautiful like the serpent was so attractive and charming as the serpent was and is oh my think of it oh praise god remember friends how through that darkness he corrupted the minds of man now you must remember satan let's say lucifer not satan lucifer was a creation of god whoa so you're saying god created satan evil like that no god created lucifer who was called son of the morning we will not go out give you the entire outline but lucifer led a rebellion in heaven it's written in the book of revelation and there was war in heaven and michael and his angels fought against lucifer or satan and his angels amen and he was cursed by god and kicked out because of this act of rebellion in heaven his sin and the curse of god caused lucifer to become satan because his nature changed and with the change of nature came a change of name he was no more the light bearer he was now the prince of darkness but now yet on the various religions various teachings he is still trying to proclaim that he is going to give you some form of secret light but that so-called form of secret light coming from the babylonians and egyptians and so on is really darkness once he was the light bearer but when he rebelled against god raised himself up started his own religion trying to you know uh promote himself god kicked him out of the kingdom cursed him and then he went through a change of name from lucifer he now became satan because his nature was changed he became the personification of ultimate perversion of god's creation because god did not create a satan he created lucifer who perverted his own nature by his sin and perverted it to a satanic evil and corrupt nature let me give you an example god created revelation uh genesis chapter three god created the serpent revelation chapter 3 if you will make a note verses 1 and verse 14. you may read the entire chapter if you wish but we find the bible says the serpent was wines he was intelligent he was more subtle than any other beast in the field in other words he was the top animal in amongst animals there was man then the animal kingdom started and and the serpent was the top animal that was there over the rest of them for he was the only one that could reason that could think that was subtle only that he did not have a soul like man has a soul but he was wise he was intelligent he could walk he could talk the bible tells us you can go read that yourself how he walked with eve he talked with eve he reasoned with eve did not god say so and so soon so and he had his gospel so-called discussion means while he's inter introducing his perversion and perverted way of of seeking and perverted logic and stuff like that he was inserting it and injecting it into the truth of god's word to deceive her away from the word of god so he the serpent and you know the rest of the story and that is how all sex and sin got inserted into babylonian religion how he committed adultery in the garden with eve not eating an apple but committed adultery that's why god curse what cursed me the serpent from this day on thy belly shalt thou go he was not on his belly he could walk he could talk he could converse she wasn't afraid of him at that time they could just walk and talk but he was the serpent and he was wise and he was standing upright but god said from today you commit your sin on your belly on thy belly shalt thou go from this day you're gonna crawl and creep around on your belly then he turns around he says endow woman curse me that when conception from this day you're gonna have pains in giving birth you're going to have problems when it comes to that then he cursed what cursed me the ground the three participants in the act were cursed by god cursed me the ground now there wasn't weeds there wasn't thorns there wasn't anything like that but from today you're going to start to have thorns you're going to have to have weeds and all kinds of stuff and even though the man did not do anything but go along with his wife and agree with her amen god says breath from today from the sweat of your brow you're going to eat bread you're going to have to label you're going to have to go out there and work for what it is and do those things okay my friends but then he became a snake the serpent became what we know today as a snake we use the word serpent serpent like that but in reality there are no real serpents on the earth there are snakes but we as humans we just interchange the words snake and serpent knowing that the unconsciously or unconsciously that there is an affinity there is some kind of thing between what we will say serpent and slave but really there are only snakes on the earth today on thy belly shall thou go and so this sexual serpent warship came upon the earth through babylon passed into rome china india north america south america spread throughout the world blanket to the entire place but of course that vast babylonian group turned from god but thank god the descendants of shem or the semitic people held to the confit the faith of the original word hero israel the lord thy god is one lord i am the lord i change not beside me there is no god no other one god and today we know the jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new testament amen praise god and praise god there was only one original faith but once there was one now there is two there is the original faith and satan loves to create counterfeits and confusion so there was no real reason for confusion when there was one thing but now you have to you got two choices these days he's got thousands of choices and they're more confusion and so that's the chaos that's the babylonian system that's the confusion that he's caused on the face of the earth in the bible one book of acts one church one fate one baptism one name but soon the devil comes in oh what happens now we got three thousand we got thousands of them everybody claiming that they're the one like that no one my friends let's go back to the word back to the bible see the original faith what god has said in his word for now we see that turn monotheism one god into polytheism many gods belief amen and the devil's lies and his so-called mysteries of his faith began to rise up against the truth of the word of god satan truly became the god of this world and began to extract an exact worship from those whom he had duped deceived and seduced spiritually causing them to believe that he was the true god and that in their temples under the guise and forms of various forms of christian religion that they were worshiping the true god and god had already spoken that how they would be so deceived there will be worshipping satan in the house of god thinking and believing his lie but there will be really worshipping satan in the house of god thinking they're worshiping the true god when they have been led us free back to the word my friends back to your bible back to the original faith see what wonderful great things the lord has done for us and how he has opened the word of god to us how he's opening up our minds eyes how he's caught in your blinded soul to see your deaf and spiritual ears to hear and to recognize that he is the same yesterday to the end forever we have given you an outline of how the red dragon the red the troll of the red dragon was in bergamos but we had to go back and show you the very regions way back in genesis the rise of nimrod the establishment of babel through his ambitions to have his own nation his own religion and to exalt himself and how that he accomplish this and spread it not only at bay bell where god confused the languages but he propagated it proliferated it caused it to spread out across the world how it went down into into egypt and from how egypt jumped across the mediterranean to greece of which today we're they're claiming uh culture and and language and mathematics and science that's absolutely false it's absolutely a lie for all those things did not come either from greece or either from africa itself it came right out of babylon then came to africa then it came from africa into greece and then it spread to europe and throughout the rest of the world the entire thing is a system and scheme of satan pulling on his puppets controlling them from the great his his red throne to this very day moving his evil lies of his mysteries into the modernized temples of satan under the guise of so-called churches teaching not the original faith of one god but teaching of faith of polytheism poly meaning many or many gods contrary to this bible and to the original faith are of our fathers from abraham the patriarchs the prophets right on down to our day to this hour and this very moment right and wrong engages in that battle today it's about time showdown time is here the holy spirit is here the rapture is at hand and it will be all be over then when we come to the end of the way when the battle is over we shall wear a shining ground may god bless you my friends repent if you need to bring your life in line with the word of god to clean up and clear out the junk and the evil lies of satan that he piled up in your heart so many years may god by the fountain dripping with blood rise up within you and bring out all that evil confess it my brother my sister confess it cast it all away from you come to christ come to the waters of baptism come in grace come in love come in humility you may be high and mighty in the world but in god your justice child you may be nobody in the world but he said i'll blow praises i'll raise them up and make them plain maybe come together as one in christ confessing washing our sins away and naming no other name but the name of our blessed lord jesus god bless you we'll see you on sunday and next wednesday we will be back with another lesson from the series of the seven church ages may god bless you [Music] you
