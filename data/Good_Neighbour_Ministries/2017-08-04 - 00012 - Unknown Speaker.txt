TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the blood of Jesus Christ the way you get there is you simply accept him you simply accept him by Faith Lord I need you as a savior Lord I need you as a deliverer Lord I need you as a Healer whatever you need except God's way that's how you deal with the issue you bring in something bigger in your life than you Hall even in atmosphere like this where where I'm going to be real personal tonight you know atmospheres like this where you know most of you by amen most of you been in church all your lives am amen most of you been in church all your lives so you know how to be politically correct come on come on you know what's expected in church you know how to look sweet and innocent you know hallelujah how to be on time and dress codes you know all that stuff but what is your desire right what's going on in the inside of you if we strip the top off of you what will we find that's right when we find a person who's miserable or a person with issues or a person that really wants God Amen that's right let's strip back the payment today hallelujah amen I want to be a what's call a escavator that digs up the road it scratches up gets down to the dirt H it destroys the ser and it makes it real rough why because you got to put something smooth over it I want to be your es Lord tonight Hallelujah I want to deal with your issues Hallelujah some of you have been in church too long not to know God you come out of good family you got good parents your mom and dad got the Holy Ghost what's your problem that's right is he not the same God he the and you know like I said politically correct if I ask some of you young sisters why do you waste skirts most you say because we're supposed to politically correct you're supposed to but I said why do you why do you I'm not talking about everybody as a group why do you can you answer that question Hallelujah can you can you take me to the scripture or even not even the scripture but bring me your revelation of it bring me Hallelujah your heart your soul on why you do what you do amen church this is not going to be a a group h a group Affair of God dealing with us is an individual Affair that's right yeah I know they have you in groups and we're all part of as a group we're all looking for this great big package we waiting on it we're like hey I need you on my team but I'm saying tonight I need you on my team but I need you issue free amise the Lord hallelujah yes Lord you know we look at the standards of the gospel and people have SI young people have sit in church for years for years playing Church you say brother what do you mean by playing Church never taking the extra mile some of you are in the same place you were in last year when you came to the camp and some of you have gone a step further but where should we be we should be seeing Christ in our lives so we need to deal with the issues and the open doors you know hallah the reason why R sa because God told God anointed David and the Bible says the spirit of God Came Upon David and an evil spirit from the Lord Came Upon Saul and the problem of God say you're either going to be led by the spirit of the Lord or the spirit of the enemy you're either going to be led by good or led by evil and if you haven't been paying attention this world is to a place where God is ready to destroy it again that's right and I wouldn't want to be a lukor believer a message believer who's been in church all their life with no desire with no Holy Ghost Church you need the Holy Ghost because if you don't your house can be swept God is clean but the devil's looking for a door to get back in there and if the strong man which is the holy spirit is not in the front of your house the devil will find a way back in that's right that's the Bible he says he goes into dry places H he's looking for dry places dry places in your life areas where you're not happy mind battles or insecurities all these things that we carry as young people why cuz we have issues what it says the spirit of the Lord leaves and an evil spirit from God comes why because Saul was disobedient it was something he was supposed to do and he didn't do it a lot of times we find ourselves in a certain condition because it was something we did or something we didn't do amen and you know from there God told him God told Saul I want you to go down to the Amit and Destroy Everything kill everybody kill man kill woman baby suckling ox and Beast ass kill Le and sa said praise the Lord hey that's very easy and then you know what his problem was he had issues he couldn't listen so you know what because he was anointed he thought hey I can just do whatever and God will accept it God needs more than just your singing God needs more than just your your instruments God needs more than just your attendance God wants your life God wants all of you amen amen not some of you God will never to anything not Facebook not Instagram none of it God wants the preeminence Hallelujah and you know Church Saul goes down and this is how we do Saul goes down and he begins to wipe out everything that was ugly that's easy for us to do we'll Wipe Out the things we know we're not supposed to do we'll Wipe Out the things that may embarrass us but our little secrets we'll hold on to it the things we think nobody else knows about we'll hold on to it those little relationships that are very ungodly we hold on to it because we think nobody else knows you know what that is that's an Open Door that's an open door for the devil and sa he goes down there he begins to wreck up the he he took this he destroyed this he destroyed that but in the midst of him destroying things he saw some music he saw some nice o some fat cats and he said you know what I'll saved us for God that wasn't the Commandment God told him destroy everything and that's what's hard for us the things we like we hold on to and that's no more than an open door for the devil you have to close those doors whether you like it or not that's what makes is hard there are some things that you still desire there are some things that you don't want to give up yet and you know what that is that's a tool for the enemy because if God has put it there H God has put it on your heart God is s for the word for you to destroy destroy it amen but he holds on to it you know he he he shav some oxin some sheep and different things and he even Spar the king a go back and read it 1 Samuel 15 and he didn't destroy everything and now God calls Samuel he says Saul has disobeyed and I'm rejecting you this I'm no longer using him anymore my spirit is going to leave why because there was something he didn't do now you think about it in your Christian Journey how many times has God tried to get something out of you and you didn't do it because of your issues because of the perception of your PE or the perception of how other people may look at you who cares God is the one calling you to do it so he doesn't do it and then God rejects him and and and you know the worst thing you can do is fool yourself like you're okay right come on now that's right the problem God say the worst kind of Christian that is is a person who got just enough religion to make themselves sick right amen and you know there's people in church who really don't want to be in church there's people hallah going with the floow and doing things spiritually that really don't want to do it their heart is not in it that's the worst kind of person to be somebody who's just in a popularity contest but Saul opened the door for an evil spirit when he didn't do what God told him to do and from there Saul watch the anointing of God leave him and fall on David and from there he opened the door of jealousy and you look in the Bible how Saul for no reason he just wanted to kill David for no reason David hallah destroyed Goliath and all these things and jealousy Rises up in Saul why because Saul opened the door of disobedience that's right and once he open that door he begin to have an issue with those who were doing good and we find out that happens among us all the time Hallelujah jealousy comes in because someone one of your peers they really love God and because you have issues jealousy arises right and we begin to look at one another different which causes major issues in the church that's right the prophet says that's going to be up to you so you confess your sins before you come to the platform and say Lord everything everything in in your life you you you straighten it up now before you come for be it assured to you that the thing will hang right over you as long as you got unconfessed sins hallu let me tell you something if you got things in your life you think you going to take to your grave I'll tell you know you at right that's true it will come out sooner or later H because you can't hide anything from God and let me say this in God's presence there will not be any sin so your sins will be exposed that's right so God will deal with it sin will not lay his presence as they covering God always deals with the sins of the sinner amen so anything you think is unconfessed and you going to take it to your grave no you won't remember the woman who committed adultery on her husband and she was thinking hey I'm going to keep this my husband's in the military then she started dying and she didn't know why she was dying she goes to the prophet and she she she she she oh brother I'm dying I went to the psychiatrist and all these things I don't know what's going on she had unconfessed sins in her life and I wonder how many of you got things in your life that's buried that Mama don't know about that Daddy don't know about that the pastor don't know about but God knows nobody's getting away nobody escape the Judgment of God God can be Hallelujah the best sa in the world or he can be the most terrible judge that's right on no I'm not trying to scare you I'm trying to close these doors that we may deal with our issues and we wonder why church sometimes feel so stagnated because of your issues you know before I I I really got sealed in church it had to when I come to church it had to be fast it had to be all my flesh [Music] something that would stimulate My Flesh because there was no real purpose inside you know it was all about the flesh but when I got converted really converted then my life became a worship Hallelujah I can be in church and hear certain songs about the blood of Jesus and it'll make me lift my hands why because there's a change inside all my issues have been given over to him and I'm no longer in control we love control that's good that's right we've gotten to a place to where the preachers have preached the fire of God right out the church tell you young people don't get caught in Emotion you heard that don't get CAU in Emotion you know H emotion is this and emotion is that and the prophet said without emotion you what dead oh you know that no emotion means that your religion is dead he said if you if you out of church or service that know emotion he said you need to bury it because it's dead amen and we'll try to have a service or a life with God that's motionless that's sness that has no kind of activity in it at all that's not our God right those are our issues listen he he says unconfessed sins your unconfessed sins come he said oh maybe things in your life that you should have done that you did not do maybe something you did Hallelujah something that you ought to do and have not done but even those things confessing Hallelujah make it right now don't get it twisted tonight I'm not saying bring all your sins to me no bring it to to God Amen I'm not here to say tell me your business no tell it to God Amen I'm not your savior I'm just an agent Hallelujah hallah I'm your agent I'm here to put the devil on blast because he's been in our churches and he's been hiding too long Satan loves to hide you know most you know I was in South Africa amen I was preaching not this time a couple years ago I was preaching I was preaching on the the The Great I Am and you know before I got there in the service uh the choir came up to sing and it was it was a very anointed this young lady came to deep the chir it was just so powerful and everything and everybody was worshiping and all this and that then the word started comeing home and that young lady that just LED s that was so anointed went into a demonic manifestation being used and then being used because she had open doors in her life that the singing couldn't show but the spirit of God could bring it out don't let Satan embarrass you because you're holding on to things that you know are not right because it will that's his whole job he wants to embarrass you that's right amen he wants to make you look very foolish you know she was on the floor and she was doing all the stuff her eyes rolling her head and the sisters come to Grandma said leave her alone don't touch her that's what we do we love to run and be a safety net we love oh oh my precious oh my precious my precious your precious needs [Music] Deliverance oh that's my boy I love him so much he's so struggling that's Deliverance deliverance and you know I look at this looked at him in his face I said you got to turn her loose grab a chair and thre it at me I grabbed it mve it as side that didn't distract me cuz I realized I'm dealing with a demon power do y'all believe demons are real what is it that will make you hold back from god let's make it clear a demon a demon if you can't give God your all today a demon power is holding you right please don't shut me off say the only thing that stopped him from receiving the Holy Spirit at 12 years old was a demon Spirit 12 and most of you are Way Beyond 12 what's stopping you you know what I'm doing I'm stripping away all your [Music] excuses mom and my daddy we just got so many problems at home you think God don't know that that's true you think God don't know what you going through you think God don't know the burdens you carry you think and I and I love going down this Avenue you think God doesn't know your secrets your secret life outside the camp your secret life when you're all alone your secret life on your cell phone stay right here it's going to get more and more intense stay right here and assist me like you don't know what I'm talking about it's going to get more and more intense I'm going to go from your pinky toe to your big toe Hallelujah because God wants you to know how real he is I don't know you from Adam but God does God knows all your secret conversation God knows all your secret desires God know God even God can even look on your page and see your poses he knows everything about you he knows what's moate that c and issu that's right an open door you don't realize that there scen in your life doors that you open that allows the devil to step right in y that's right and once he get in he's wild he's not going to play nice when he gets in he wants to tear up the house he wants you to remember that you let him in that's right he wants you to carry him for a long time even when he gets kicked out of the house that's right that's right listen Saul disobeys God God rejects him and he tries to cover it up he says what I did I I did what you told me to do he saved everything that was nice and beautiful and then he tried to blame it on the people it was the people the people did we good at we're good at blaming everybody else you look at your mom young girl look at your mom it's your fault I look like you I the way I look I look like you if I may stupid God doesn't deal with us on that karmal level amen he wants the inside me you know your young brother you may look at dad like man time think about myself I just I'm SP of you you to be glad your dad got the Holy Ghost right Hallelujah let's dig into it a little bit Church listen the prophet of God says he says now we realize that it was reason common reasonings that started the ball of sin rolling at the first place it was reasoning what reasoning against the word of God and a lot of times that's how doors open because we reason against the word of God what is reasoning reasoning basically says to God I have a better way that's the reason he does reason he tries to find another way around to get to a certain place there's no way around the word of God and let me challenge you some of you gave so much out there you've got in here and you're tired right come on you did it all you did it all you gave you gave your best you probably would have jumped in the water every time if you good you gave everything and now you get here and the devil's trying to put you to sleep Devil's trying to make it this interesting if I can let me tell you what that is that's a demon now you to say you sleep tired you mean to tell me you going to let a demon put you to sleep you ain't got no power I'm going be realis you know this time when I was in church and I got tired you know what I did I stood up you didn't put me why the word is going not today you didn't put me no preach preaching I'm Hallelujah br you know Church be careful with me because I'm not one of those preachers who's just going to let the enemy do anything in service no I will challenge him Hallelujah I will call him out I will tell the enemy you're not going to do that tonight to these young people we will fight you everything got I have to come down there and you and you will close those doors Hallelujah see we we we we we take God for granted we take this part of the service that oh is this another service no this is life of death life is going alive without the Holy Spirit you will not make it I don't know how it's been presented you know I I I I know and believe that Pastor Simon believes that there's a holy spirit but church are we really catching it have have have we made that the most important thing about our lives what is the holy spirit it's the indwelling of Christ in you why wouldn't you want that do you remember in the Bible the last time God's spirit dwell in a body it was called Jesus Hallelujah and he went to a man Hallelujah who had a legion of demons and all those leaders of demons ran out there and torment Jesus Hallelujah but when they saw that Spirit of Jehovah in that body of Jesus Christ when they saw that they Bow Down and Worship that you every door every demon every Spirit you it'll close every it'll deal with every amen hallu oh my church listen Open Doors I want to deal with open doors how does doors get open I'm going read you a story of a young lady but before I get there you see this the Bible says G not the Holy Spirit it says it's your sealed to the day of the Redemption amenes 4:3 a seal you know what a seal is this a Seal Seal right can I get amen has the top one seal with this seal I can turn this upside down and nothing comes out why the seal is keeping it I can stra it around nothing comes out the seal is keeping it I can take it and toss it on the floor nothing comes out why because of the seal it's the seal that's keeping it church and once the Holy Ghost becomes the seal in your life it will keep you even if you're turned upside down even if you're tossed about even you're slapped upside down by the seal will keep you Hall theal sometimes you may feel like you're Dr on your head but everything stays intact why because of the seal Lord hallelujah why wouldn't you want the Holy Ghost it'll keep you in all your troubles and all your heart time SE hold sometimes you don't know if you're [Music] coming SE why would you want the S that's right it's built to last when God seals you the devil becomes powerless amen cuz nothing comes out and nothing comes in because of the seal and the only way call anything can come out and anything can go in and if the seal is broken that's right and there's not a demon in Hell strong enough to break the SE he can't the Holy Ghost Church the problem of God say for the enemy to get past the seal that means he has to be the same thing the inside for him to get past the seal he has to be your [Music] brother picture that you being Brothers with the devil right oh my church The Seal holds and I'm trying to show you the import import of the Holy ghosten let's get out of this relaxed you know lukewarm stage and you know I've been in the message all my life I have such a good pastor and mom and dad loves me and I just want to eat some more Doritos I just love God no you got to have a fire in your life you got to have something burning because Satan's going to try you in every Avenue that he thinks you're weak that's right if it's boys like I said this morning he's going to send someone tall dark and handsome and when you get around I'm going to need Goosebump you're so you're so you're you're you're my serent that's what it is and you brother the same way like oh she man you see her she oh F my your [Music] Jezebel that's all this sat open the door Bo some of yall thinking hard got issues church when I decided to give up it got a little easy because then all of my weight became God's weight M all my struggle became God's struggle you know I'm telling many that when I had cancer in my brain that when I talked to the doctors and they were like you be aess you take chemotherapy and all stuff whatever the word of God came Isaiah 53 God's p and the greatest thing my mom ever did for me she said I'm not going to make the decision whether you take the keyo radiation to me she said because I'm not going to have to live with it you are she said so you take it I got you back you don't take it I got you back but you going to have to make a decision and what was happening there she allowed God to open the door of faith for me amen because it was going to be my words H that God was going to act on not her words not her prayer my words and that's where you have to go you have to go from Mama and Daddy's conviction to your own conviction mhm yeah it's fine it's fine you know pleasing mom pleasing dad but when they around when you go to worship like Cain and Abel what's going to come out that's right it was all fine as long as they were going with with with with Adam and Eve but this particular day they went by themselves and now the true revelation of what they had inside had to come out hallah and that day Hallelujah Abel Hallelujah was in inspired by God and that day came was inspired by his father nobody knew who he was until that day because he was in he was under the umbrella of the household of God but this particular time when his true Revelation came out that door swung wide open everything came out which was a devil right listen the prophet tells a story about a young lady who grew GRE up in church and it starts like this he says he says you know as a little boy or girl a child one thing has happened that we can point back and say from that time such and such a thing we did such and such a thing taking place and from that time it was thus and thus or maybe the immoral woman could could say something like this or or I was virtuous woman I was raised in a strict Christian Home by a Godly father and mother and I was just as p as a l until one night I took a ride with a certain boy and we drove up to a dance hall and from that time you always relate back to something something sometime something happen see so what he's saying there's always a time in your life when you can realize when a door open and then from there he goes to tell a story about a young lady he's talking to a young lady he says and she said when I was a young girl brother I was raised in a real Christian home can I get amen most of you raised in what a real Christian home you afraid to say Amen yes we're raised in in in homes where people believe that God is real amen she acknowledging to the prophet that I was raised in a real Christian home and listen it says and I started going with a boy that smoked first first issue first issue she was raised in a real Christian home but she never became a Christian because if she was a Christian she would have never started going with a boy that smoke first Open Door issue the first issue was she never became a Christian she was in a Christian Home raised by Christian parents but she never became a Christian so because she never became a Christian her decisions were never sound so she chose a boy that smoke open door I started going with a boy that smoke and said first thing you know I was smoking she opened the door evil Communications corrupt good matters she says and one night he spiked a coke with whiskey all because she grew up in a Christian home but she never became a Christian so she chose a boy that smoked and this boy got her to smoking then he SP her drink with whiskey and now another door is open now she's drinking alcohol she went from a Christian home to smoking H and now she's drinking and all of this was something that she didn't have plann but it was simply because she never became a Christian although she grew up in a Christian home she had issues listen he said and that she said and that started me drinking she said I started from that to prostitution another open door I got your attention all started with a young girl who per se grew up in the message but the message never grew up in her and then she chose a young boy smoke then she began smoking and then he spiked the drink then she began drinking and then the drinking turned into prostitution door after door after door she said and I said said I live I live in the very guts of all the blackest of hell all that started because she never got the SE even though she was in the message she was in the message I'm not saying you're not in a good church what I'm saying is what that church is preaching have you become one with have you become one with or are you still consumed with a whole bunch of issues in your life church it's good brother she says I served four years in the cic institution good serus home and said in there I turned a new page we've heard that before right amen although she smoked she drank she got into prostitution she went to the black the gutters of hell she still found her way to the camp she found her way to good Shepherd's institution she found her way back to a good environment but it was no good without the SE all of that is just turning a new page you can leave this camp and say man we had a good time the word was good but without the seal you'll be back in next year doing the same thing that's right amen that's right come on I know some of yall think we see table I want to Rejoice we're rejoicing right now that's right H cuz the Bible says all Heaven Rejoice over one soul that repent and if I can get you to see how important your life is to God convert it then you he says you know you know look I've been doing this long I can feel your conviction I I I you know I can feel I almost want to quit and just bring bring the musicians up and say let's deal with these issues right now cuz I can I I I can feel the presence of decision I I can feel some of you are like in those valleys in those places Lord how how can I get rid of this and I've done this and I've done that and and you know I have so much baggage and so much issues I I I can feel the value of decision in the room but let me say like this don't Ras me just give [Music] up parents don't be dismayed by their silence God is working amen amen that's right is working he he he's the god of permanence hallah he knows how to he knows how to get right there to the edge and then push forward that's what God know God knows how to come right down her Avenue and say Brother D is talking to you he's talking to you and he wants you to give up not me God wants you to give up he wants to be a savior you know you make him what he is that's righten without your hurts he can never be a Healer amen listen she found herself in the institution she said in there I turned the new page and said when I get out here I'm going to go straight we ever did that before we messed up bad we went in prayer like oh Lord follow me forgive me love me break me out I never do it again and he do it he bring you out and you know what you go back to do it again why cuz there's no s yes Lord can I get amen she says I me it but as soon as I got out with the crowd again it was all over why cuz that Spirit was still there that's what we're dealing with church we're not dealing with relig we're dealing with the two Spirits Christ or Satan and one of those will dominate your life one of those will dominate your habits your being everything about you one of those spirits will dominate you you know you think that's going to get you you know the nice people going to be in Hell how many nice sweet young people who never did anything all they give us play hockey and go to Tim [Music] Hortons but they were never a benefit to the kingdom of God what good are you if God can't use you and and I know this is a little to you maybe a little intense hey but sometimes we need intense Services you know we need to stop playing with the devil yeah come on we need to stop playing with our salvation and we need to say see you guys are old enough for me to preach about you I don't have to talk about Power Rangers and all that stuff look we can be straight up and [Music] honest Hallelujah cuz cuz I'll be the first want to admit after God healed me from cancer I still didn't have the seal so it took me probably another 5 years to really get converted but all that time I was in church with no desire and you know I you know I can e the devil down I say you know I you know when I get Sav I really want to be saved I don't I don't want to be in the world and in church and in the world you know and all these things I really want to be sa you ever have that conversation with yourself that's right I really want to be saved I I don't want to be in the world and in church anywhere in church Lord I really want to give you my all am you ever had that conversation yes sir it's not too late amen but let's say like this you can't make deals with God right you can't negotiate your salvation with God either you give up or you don't [Music] listen she said I me that as soon as I got with the crowd Hallelujah she said it was all Lord she said then two years she said I did two years in the women's State Penitentiary all that started because she grew up in a Christian home but never became a Christian when you start to down SP sat wants you to hit the bottom hard hard you know and and some of us we've put our relationships before God you know as long as as long as I have him in my life I can serve God because you're my f will mess up that relationship because he wants you amen he will let it go you find yourself arguing and fighting and all these things why because God wants to be first she went from a Christian home to smok it to drinking to prostitution to the GS of Hell to the Catholic Good Shepherd's home and after the good Shepherd's home she ended up in [Music] jail that's a bad place what was going on with her she had issues and open no in her life but all that could resol if she would just became what her home was her home was a Christian environment and she should have became a Christian listen we're going somewhere she said and there I thought truly I was reformed and I come here and join another church and I told the pastor we went down to the alt and talk it over but she said I just can't keep from it she said I started Hallelujah she said it started one night she went to church maybe maybe we've seen people do this leave your church go to another church but they still the same Spirits cuz you're fighting demon powers we don't wrestle against one another it's demon powers people run from this church to that church take their young from this church to that church know your fighting demon powers amen when she gets out of jail she goes to another church her and the pastor go to an altar even though she went to the altar she felt pretty good she said one night it started all over again why because she never got converted she was just being churching boy I can't wait to see some of y'all skits listen and the prophet say I said lady don't you want to be a real lady have a hubby and babies like a real woman was she said oh with all my heart see in her heart she really wanted to be a Christian and no doubt most of all of us in here feel like that we really want to serve God what's stopping us issues in open doors that's right on see one thing I want you to understand Satan doesn't know what's in your heart am right he doesn't know your desire the only one knows that is God right so what Satan does he studies you he watches what you do on the internet he watches the kind of clothes that gets you excited when you're [Music] stream amen he watches all those things that gets you excited and he puts that in front of you to get a reaction that's what he does he studies your behavior because he doesn't know what's in your heart see he didn't know when I was in my car back in the 90s listening to Tupac riding down the road saying Dear Mama and all these things bopping my bopping my music bouncing he didn't know that I really had a desire to be a Christian praise the Lord hallelujah he didn't know Hallelujah because I had issues and open doors but he didn't know way down inside I wanted what my mama had don't y'all know Elvis Presley said the same thing even though he was Shake ring and rolling and doing all this stuff Hallelujah when all when all the music would stop and he get all by himself he would get on the piano you know what his favorite song was his favorite song was down from his glory
