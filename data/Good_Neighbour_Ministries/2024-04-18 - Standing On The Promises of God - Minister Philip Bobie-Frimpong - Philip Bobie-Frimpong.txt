speak to your bride oh God the sacrifice they have made to be here may they never leave you the same may you speak something and bless your children bless every aspect of the service and be with us and even in Us in Jesus name amen um we're going to go to our scriptures just two scriptures tonight Joshua chapter 1 verse 3-5 and I got um Hebrews 6:18 okay you got it there shall not okay verse three say every place that the soul of your foot shall Trad upon that I that have I given unto you I as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even into the Great River the river ephra all the land of the Hees and onto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of th life as I was with Moses so I'll be with thee I'll not fail thee nor forsake thee God's giv us that promise he will never leave us nor forsake us and Hebrews 6 18 that by two imitable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for The Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast and which entered into the that within the veil whether the Forerunner is for entered even J say made and high priest Forever After the order of MEC the m is the two imitable things in which it was impossible for God to lie you might have a strong consolation who have fled for The Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set before us Heavenly Father please bless the reading of the word in Jesus name amen please be seated yeah so as we just read from the scripture that the Bible said that every place that your footstep God says that given to them you know we spoke of this on Friday prayer meeting and I just feel led to just continue with it God could have wiped out all the heti ties all the jebusites all the Canaanites all those inhabitants and gave the city to them but remember in numbers there were 12 Elders from each of the tribes and God chose them to go and spy the land and as I was reading what really strike me was that when God told them to go and spy the land Moses told them to be courageous and bring fruit of the land and it strick me so much that these people were very courageous and truly they were able to bring the fruit of the land and say yes this place is what full of milk and honey it's a wonderful place the fruit the food is good and God has given them that courage yet when they came back they came back with evil report why will you have the courage to do something and then you still coming back with evil report and I was just looking into all those things and you see sometimes and not sometimes those people who evil report even though they have came out from Egypt Egypt was still in them Egypt has not left them so if you read the scripture they were even looking for a leader to take them back to eat their garlic they were looking for a leader but you know what um there was two of them before I go there um every human being whatever comes out from you is something that is already inside of you you manifest whatever is hiding inside of you a very good friend of M always say that money does not make people Pride they have that Pride hiding somewhere so the money come to manifest whatever is inside of them if somebody's abusive husband he always have that thing in him so when the situation comes it man it magnify it so so is a seed of God if you are son or daughter of God no matter what situation will be pushed under whatever pressure be pushed under because that seed in you it will come forth and manifest Christ so all these people those 12 leaders they still have the Egypt in them it hasn't gone as of them so that's why they were able to bring the evil report even though they have grapes wonderful food that they brought from their spine you know and I don't know sometimes people get attached with fears and they act so quick even yesterday I was talking to a friend of mine he has a lot of he has Farms chicken gold this he said f third word is coming I'm not selling my chicken to nobody I'm going to eat everything by myself J you see people tend to accept evil report easily and act right away and they got all the camp to follow them and they were meming and crying and everything but the Bible said that Caleb was of a different Spirit Caleb Tes a bride amen he has a different Spirit he didn't look at the condition himself and Joshua they saw the camp and they said that our God is able to deliver us our God is able to give us the land only thou can believe all things are possible Hallelujah so now the people of the Joshua character with a Caleb character in them can stand on the word of God and believe that all things are possible to them that believe because they believe God's report yes sir tonight what are you believing are you going to accept that doctor's report and just accept it and embrace it and live in fear or are you going to accept God's report the true report that said by his stripes I am healed by his stripes I am made whole by his stripes I made whole he was wounded for my transgression bruised for my iniquities the chastisement of my peace was upon with him and by his stripes I'm Healed tonight I'm accepting God's true report regardless of what the doctor is saying regardless of my financial situation I'm not looking at the condition going on I'm looking at the true report that said that Above All Things I wish thou May prosper and be in health even as your soul prospered that's the report for me and I'm standing on that good report regardless of what around me because I'm not looking at my circumstances those people were looking at their circumstances they have a shallow mind excuse me they forgot easily what God did to them what God did for them they forgot how God by his servant Moses spoke and they have Locust all around their water turned into blood they forgot how God delivered their first children when they applied the token on the on the on the lamp post but Joshua and Caleb never forgot they forgot when they got to the Red Sea Pharaoh's Army was after them brother Danny and the Red Sea was in front of them they didn't know which way to turn and God spoke to Moses and they went on a dry land there was a time there was no food for them and God re Mana to feed them they forgot of all all the goodness that God has done for them and any little thing they begin to complain what I hate is people always complaining in memory because those things will not do you any good it will make you more miserable it will make your situation worse but if you can stand on the faith of God maybe it may linger but it will come to pass am it may come to pass amen the vision may stay long but it will come to pass because one thing is the word of God said by his stripes you were he he said that lay your hands on the sck and they shall recover God never put a timeline on that he just lay your hands on the sck they shall recover there was no timeline he will do it on his own time I think that's the tactic Nat is using said that I'm not giving anybody a timeline when I'm going to strike when the time comes I'm going to strike God never gave us a timeline it's the scoffers it's the unbelievers that try to put a Time on God's promise but a True Believer will stand on the promise of God regardless of the situation regardless of the condition regardless of what he's going through he will because the Bible has let us know clearly that there's two imitable things God can not lie said let every man's word be a lie but mine be the truth amen so God keep his word yes sir he kept his promises it should it should stick right in our heart our soul mind everywhere listen if you human beings sometimes I do work for some Builders we are build that relationship and I have confidence brani that these people will pay me so when I'm doing the work for them I'm not scared I'm not scared to start the job without even a deposit because they have built that reputation of keeping their word and you can multiply by million and billion and trillion times with God because even though I have confidence in these people their company can go to a bankrupt they can be in a situation that they cannot pay me but I'm still half confidence because they keep their word what about God who created the entire universe who is infinite God that knows today from tomorrow when you make a promise to Abraham you SW SW by himself he never swore by anybody else because there's no one greater than him and our God is on he kept his word he keep his promises and if this God keep his word and keep his promises then we have to put our confidence everything that we have in this word because that word will never fail and he has given us that promise I will never fail thee nor forsake thee so why are you worried tonight we should be the most happiest people on the face of this Earth because what God has done for us is beyond our comprehension the greatest thing that could ever happen to any human race any human being on this Earth that's what the Lord has given to you and and me the salvation of our soul is the greatest thing that you can talk of in this world there's nothing that come close to it so we should be the most happiest every day on this Earth no matter what we are going through because remember because we are Sons and Daughters of God all the enemies attack will be of thir all the time but the Bible said said many afflictions of the righteous but God deliver him out of it all so no matter what comes our way our God is in control greater is he that is in you tonight than he that's in the world amen amen so our focus should be on him our confidence should be on this great God hallelujah amen so what am I trying to say so as Joshua said and God told Joshua everywhere that your footstep he has given it to you so you have to have that confidence and step on the word of God outside our comfort zone we have to go beyond the camp and step to the Unseen and trust God that the god that has revealed the thing to us will keep his word because he's on time God and I believe that's the same confidence that job had no Noah have because in the time of Noah Noah was told to believe something that has never happened in his time that there is going to be a rain and it has never ever rained in his time but he has confidence in God that gave the promise it took 120 years they scof at him they mock at him they did everything to him but he stand on the word of God and said said my God have said it I believe it the rain will come even though beyond all the scientific thing they have moveed they can move to the moon and check everything and said Noah you are an old man you don't know what you are talking about there's no rain in the sky but Noah said my God have said it and I believe it I'm standing on it he kept on building the ACT he kept on pushing he kept on pushing he kept on pushing he kept on doing it until God came and and and closed the AR by himself and then the rain came and what did he do it destroyed all those what scers that same God is here with this tonight we have been told to believe something that it has never happened a group of people in the world before and the people think that we are sometimes cucko here but we are not cucko Paul said the way they call heresy that's the way I worship my God one of these days in a twinkle of an eye we be changed and move up to be with our Lord amen the people like it or not we are going up you are not going down before as Mike was saying standing before any third world began this bride of Christ will take a flight amen so we are not scared of third world war we are not scared of the circumstances our confidence is in God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob that our God keep his promises yes he does he keep his promises so if he keep his promises then we have to stand on that Promises of God regardless of what we are going through tonight all that I want to leave here with you that we going to stand on that promise of God regardless of the situation regardless of the circumstances we're going to stand by it because we have a confidence we have a example here in Hebrews 11 some of them were son understand that some of them were put in firey furnace some of them were in the um in Lion's Den but they look to God promise and believe God and stand on the word of God one thing I think I'm going ahead of myself but regardless is that God doesn't like procrastinators when God reveals something to you you act on the word amen don't procrastinate L tomorrow may not be there for you act on that word of God once it's revealed to you because you read at the Bible I think I'm going over the place but I'm going to go I don't care just what is in my heart I'll spoke Abraham and the Patriarchs if you read the scriptures it said the self same day God spoke to Abraham he acted on the word by doing the circumcision circumcising himself and Isaac and and oh ishma and all his household you check all of them the selfs that the Patriarchs when God speak to them they act on it right away so whatever God is revealing in your heart to do don't wait because tomorrow may not be for you tomorrow May will not be for you you have to act right away so that the enemy will not mle the waters for you because when God reveals something for you act on it when you act it will come to pass because he that has revealed to you he that has made a thing known to you he going to bring it to pass regardless because God cannot fa and God cannot lie that's why okay I'm this I'll I'll talk about myself that I'll talk a little bit about myself too so God cannot lie and God cannot What fail so when God tell you to do something he expect you to act on it Abraham did that Isaac all the Patriarchs they never wait once is clear to them they act on that word of God that's why someone like um um blind bimus braam talk about his life being that um his wife was sick and at that time he has they use that turtle dove that's what they use to attract the rich people to give them money so that's what he used to make his jokes his his play so he can attract people to give him money when his wife was sick he what he told God that if you heal my wife I'm going to offer this totle Dove to you and God heal the wife he offered the ttle D and before I go there there was one time that even there was a prophet or a King when he went the war he promised God that the first thing that will come and dance he sacrifice that and his daughter that he loves he came she came the first thing and that King sacrificed that daughter because that was a promise he made to God and the Patriarchs those people they kept their promises so blind matimus when his daughter God sake I know you know about the story I'm just repeating it he asked God if you heal my daughter I'm going to sacrifice with the lamp the very lamp like dog that lead the blind people the very lamb that lead him he promised God to offer that lamb and when God healed that daughter he kept his path of the promise so when I came God called me to this message and I'll see with that proper immigration papers and trying everything I know you guys were born here you don't know what it is to be in the country without that um permanent residence even though I have the um the insurance C to work everywhere I was working with my own papers for like seven years six years and eight years that I still didn't have that and when I read about black bimos I believe it literally BR whenever I read and listen to that voice on the tape it become so real to me that my this is so clear this is rare I'm going to do exact same thing because this thing was so rare and clear when I listened the prophet talking about him the inspiration caught me so much and I said no I'm going to act the same way this man has acted and I promise God that when he opens door for me I'm going to send th000 support the missionary work at that time of voice of God and I gave that promise and then I went to see Pastor Simon and it's like my situation at that time the was saying the only way that you can get a right to live in the country you have to get married and I told pastor but deep in my heart I didn't believe that but that's what I was being told and Pastor said no Phillip I don't believe in that we serving a living God who has done for so many people if you have met somebody's different story but let's trust God and all my heart that was what I was looking for and within a couple of weeks BR Simon came and preached very powerfully and said that the Patriarchs because they believe that the god they are serving will always keep his part part of the promise he will never fail them God honest his word more than his name so when they have any Covenant with God they don't wait for God to do their part of the bargain they go right away and do their part because they are human and they can fail but God will never fail so when P Salon spoke that that W strike my soul like a magnet within that very night you preach on Sunday Monday I send that ,000 to pay for to support that missionary work and within a week that problem was solve why because it's the same yesterday today and forever so what am I saying it's a little small a tiny a testimony but I'm just saying that God can do more in a bigger picture whatever you going through tonight you have to keep your part of the promis keep your part of the by gain because God will always keep his part there's a part you have to play you have to put your foot forward footsteps mean possession that's why in Revelation 1 to3 it says Those Who overcome I'll give you to do this the Overcomers the Overcomers it's all being the Overcomers how can you overcome except God in you overcome for you but you have to give him an opportunity and Surround every because he overcame death hell and Grave and sickness and everything and he that overcame that is in you so you have to accept it what he did on Calvary every death was was was everything death hell and Grave were all what were were were conquered by him so he that overcame that is in you and in me amen so he has already conquered so all that you have to do take him at his word you have to overcome yourself it's yourself that you have to overcome you have to overcome your pride you have to overcome your unbelief you have to overcome the little things that SP the vine you have overcome things that is you know that's not right that you are feeding on you have to overcome the things that is H distracting you especially in these days the social media you have to overcome yourself and make sure that those social media is not using you you are supposed to use it but we become so distracted because it's all over you can't it's a it's an age they know exactly things that you like so immediately you just go on those things just come popping up it pop up on you and then he begin to use you move here left right left right left right left right by time you realize you come like two three 4 hours but you have to say no I'm controlling you I'm just going to search what I like I spent couple of once I'm throwing away you cannot control me you have to fight it's a battle it's a b to get hereon yeah it's a fight but you have to keep on fighting keep on keep on he say if you know what await for you I have not seen ear have not heard what God has in store for them that love him and that God loves you he cares for you he cares for one on all of us the main is sometimes sometimes we forget who we are and sometimes we neglect one another we think we can make it by ourselves but we need one another very very we need one another very important I remember sometimes certain things even your body you don't see how important they are unless something happen to it and I remember couple of months back I have a problem with my tooth and that tooth about 10 or 8 years back the dentist did um Ruth canine and put a gold on it and after like years I'm having pains so I went back to him he said oh I got to take this out I have to fix it I said no I'm feeling pain take it out I don't need it he said no let me let's maintain this I said no I'm feeling pain just take it out and I know how important that tooth is to me until you took it out then I realized my mouth is my tongue is going there this is happening there that is happening there so I didn't see the importance of that until the the Mind took it out so it is you and me sometime you don't see the importance of one another so you have to respect and love one another once you have an opportunity let's appreciate one another let's know that we need one another because I need I I covered your prayers I need your prayers you need my prayers so little things that you need from one another but we don't sometimes think that we are full of ourselves but let's pray for one another let's stay for one another let's trust for God for one another amen our God is good all the time and another person who never who never um who stood by the word of God is Abraham and we are abrahamic seed the Bible said that Abraham never sted at the promise of God he was constant ly giving praise to God and that God is in you and in me Abraham didn't look at his conditions he have confidence in God that gave him the promise even though it seeks to be him it seeks to him to be to able to give birth scientifically there was no way Abraham or Sarah could give birth at their age so Abraham initially in his own natural life he was telling God that God give me um um elazar to be my thing he said no no no you're going to have someone from your own what loons and Abraham believed that true report from God it doesn't matter how old he was it doesn't matter how old Sarah was he look to the one who gave that promise that he's able to keep his word so he never stacked at that promise of God he was constantly giving praise his confidence in God was so much great that when the time came for God to ask him to sacrifice the very child that he has been waiting for for 25 years he was still willing he never complained he told them the servants that the lad and I we are going to worship and what we are we come back yes sir he didn't know how he was going to come back but he believed he was going to worship and come back and it God spoke his needs into existence by providing a sacrifice for himself and you been a daughter or son of Abraham the same God that spoke Abraham need into existence tonight is able to speak your need into existence if thou can believe whatever you going through tonight my God is able to supply all your needs amen let's keep him at his word at his promise he said he has his Variety Store everything you have need of go to that supermarket and grab it healing Deliverance children whatever you have it's free of charge it's free it's not for sale without minding without price and the people don't want it why the people worry thems no wonder that the prophet asked the king is not not a a b of Gilead in in um there's no B of Gilead over there why the people are talk about why the people are worrying our God is more than able to supply all your needs to speak your needs into existence because as he did through Abraham he's going to do it through you going to do TR me because he's not a dead God he's a living God and God kept his promises he said that repent and be baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ for the Forgiveness of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost if you genuinely repent and you baptize in his name God is going to fill you with himself it's simple as that he keeps his promises he said the promise unto you and to your children and to them that are far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call is God still calling if he still calling then he's still able to do that because God hasn't changed he's the same yesterday today and forever as he did through the apostles he promised to leave we are the new book of us another book of us being written we are the written Epistles read of all men don't look down upon yourself he one time somebody came to this church a friend of mine left him here he came couple of months and I thought that I was just saying what the Lord has done for me just to encourage him God knows my heart and this man said oh you brag too much just like bra Bram asked the person I'm not bragging about myself and bragging about the Lord Jesus Christ the problem that people forget is that this Bible that you reading brani is the life of the Apostles it's the life of the Patriarchs it talks about the life of Abraham it talks about the life of Job it talks about the life of all those things when the people are reading they feel so God but when that life has come right now in me it came like he said that he is um Jesus Christ all that God was he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into the church so like he was the one he died on Calvary and divided himself and came on day of Pentecost in the apostles is that right and then he used the braam as a wave sheath he took his Prophet that same spirit is here with us so that same God that was in the prophet that was in the apostles that same God is in you and in me so whose life do you think you going to read again it's your life it's my life God has done through them and our life has to line up with what is in the word once your testimony lines up with this gospel then don't don't don't feel shy to talk about it let everybody know what God has done for you let the people know what God has done because he's the same yesterday today forever some people they feel good when they read what he has done in the past but when you tell them what God is doing now at present tense they begin to M against it they begin to whisper against it they been to gossip against it but the same God remember those people are what as scers if they were to believe in the time of Noah they'll be scoffing Noah if they be living the time of Paul and the apostles they'll have that Spirit of Demas and forsake Paul those are the people they were to be in the time of the 12th of the of the of those um two million people who the 12 leaders who who doubted and bring an evil report that's what they're going to be doing because when the word is put in flesh it becomes a trouble for them no wonder about whoever deny Jesus Christ has come in has not come in flesh is Antichrist because he's in flesh now it's the body and they are failing to recognize it and they're criticizing the body they don't know that they're criticizing God in the body is the same God the was the P they feel so good about him oh they like to read about him but they fail to recognize when he's you know walking in two feet on the a that's what is going on now God even his bride doing exact same thing he did back then because he's the same yesterday today and forever yeah God is awesome God hallelujah it's wonderful God Amen praise God hallelujah all that God is looking for now is an individual it's one that will become will let God have full preeminence will let God have full control because God don't need so many people he had only one Samson and he conquered the whole Philistines he one David just one Noah just all one person who are willing to die to himself and let God have preeminence one person like Phillip who was so obedient the word of God that he left all the um the Revival that he having Samaria and listen to the voice of God and go and meet only one Enoch that's what God is looking for that the bride of Christ will come to the place that we will be so preminent we we give him so preeminence that we not even going to say anything unless he tells you to move you won't do anything unless he tells you what to do and he's directing all your footsteps and he's getting the glory for himself oh man how God will be so happy when their sons and daughters reach that stage and they fully know full preeminence yes he's using this don't get me wrong he's doing here little here little there little there little there but before we leave it has to be foolest so that it's in full control that there won't be nothing to hinder his FL low amen so that he can have the full preeminence and use as mightly because God wants to pour himself more into us more than what we even think or expect he's an awesome God and He Loves Us amen so I'm just going to read this to just um cap it off in how can I overcome paragraph 68 okay from step now think hard now if you are laying around getting dirty get in hurry quick cuz the door might close at any time and there is always been an act in God's economy there was an act in the days of Noah for the saving of his people the was an act in the days of the Law act of testimony in the days of the law they followed the ark and there's a third dispensation now like Noah's time L's time and now this time there is an AR now and that AR is not a denomination neither is it a good work that you do is by one's spirit Romans 8:1 we are all baptized into one body in the domain of that Kingdom one spiritual baptism no matter how good how bad whatever you are in that Kingdom by the Holy Ghost baptism see that's the only way you overcome is all that's under the shed blood is overcome it CU you cannot overcome yourself it is he that overcame for you you you are resting amen it's a resting time Bron you can please come it's a time that you are resting in Christ that that he that is heaven Laden come onto me and I'll give you what rest you are resting in him in his leadership and
