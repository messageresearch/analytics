How many have set their wings this morning to move into a into a higher place &gt;&gt; with him in the cliff of the rock? Amen. That secret place with him this morning. I believe that if you've come expecting in that way, I believe that the Holy Spirit will take you right into that sacred place with him into the cliff of the rock will speak to you personal. Amen. That's what we desire when we come into the house of the Lord. We expect the Holy Spirit to come and speak to our hearts &gt;&gt; and to speak to our needs and to discern the things that are heavy upon us because we're human. We're living in this world. We're we're we're so uh um you know bound by the things of this life. Uh at times you know um time trying to control us and and the work and the efforts that we have to put forth every day to you know to keep food on the table to keep relationships together the pressures of life. Well guess what this morning you can come into his presence. &gt;&gt; You can release it all to him. He can speak to those situations and you can be set free. God bless you musicians. Amen. &gt;&gt; We certainly appreciate &gt;&gt; the worship this morning. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Um I want to welcome all the visitors. Welcome everybody into the house of the Lord this morning. We certainly appreciate um everybody. We appreciate our former pastor John Simon who's with us. Um, you know, he's a real strength and an encouragement to me and to this ministry and to all of you, I know. Amen. And so, we certainly appreciate um his uh his encouragement. Amen. Praise God. Because um you know uh we are here as his uh you know, converts and his offspring, you know. Um, we were having some fellowship the other day and he was just saying how proud he is to see that, you know, that that he's he's seeing the the fruits of of his ministry over the many years where he had to, you know, just kind of um just continue to just bring the word and to put aside all the distractions that were going on even around the message of the hour, you know, all the distractions. He's so grateful that the Holy Spirit just led him to stay with the word and and now the effects of that have come upon us because we're just loving the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We just want to hear the word. We just want to feed on the word. &gt;&gt; That's what caught our attention. Amen. It's the word. It's him. It's the person of God. It's the, you know, this is what we're going to be looking at today. This is what has set us a flame. If your experience didn't start that way where you actually met him, the person of of the Holy Ghost, then then you're you're still in progress. Then you're you're still you're going to find yourself uh you know in a place where you're still you know at times in a state of confusion and and so forth. So praise God. Let's um I bring greetings from brother Chris and Sister Farerita in in Trinidad. They they reached out and said, "Please send our our greetings to the saints." So, I'm doing that and I I'm thankful for the service we had here on Wednesday night. How many enjoyed that with brother Daniel Pasos? Amen. Praise God. Very simple uh you know anointing of the Holy Spirit to come and speak to his children in such a simple way. And I love that because God is hidden in that simplicity. &gt;&gt; Don't ever be looking for great things. Just be looking for the great God. Amen. To speak to your needs. Amen. Praise God. So this morning we're going to continue um where we uh sort of well we we left off last week with um you know we've been on a series here on the purpose of God. Amen. You can go to the next slide. And um you know uh today we want to look at you know a little bit more specifically the purpose of the Holy Ghost. Amen. And we just want to over these next couple services we want to dig. We want to we want to understand we want to break out of the confusion that's that's moving around the message of the hour and even out there in the world in in the in the Christian world because there's just so much you know um chaos and confusion about what the Holy Ghost really is and what the purpose of the Holy Ghost is and and people just don't know. You can go and ask, you know, five different people and you'll get five different interpretations of what they think the Holy Ghost is. But let's just see what the Holy Spirit gives us today so that we can, you know, trust that that we can walk out with clarity of mind and know exactly where we stand as sons and daughters of God. Amen. Praise God. Let's go to our um before we go to the scripture, let's pray. Father, we've come this morning with one desire, Lord, and that is that that we could enter into your presence because we know you're here. We already know that. That's your promise. That's the word. We we we don't join because we belong to some organization. We don't come into the into the uh church of God, into the house of the Lord. It's just a a church building. We come to assemble and gather around you, around your spirit, around your word. And Lord, that is what we are placing in front of the people this morning. Lord, take away the me, the self, the individual. Lord, take away all the and then on the people. take away all the the the scars and and and the perceptions and the insecurities of the people, Lord, because Lord, many of us come into your presence. And Lord, we we just don't know how to approach you sometimes. But Lord, uh this morning, may we approach you with what with one thing, a pure heart, Lord. A pure heart, Lord, to that that that we would see you, Lord. Blessed are the pure in heart. They shall see God, Lord. This is our desire this morning, Lord. That your word would become alive. That it would become real to each individual heart, Lord. So that we can leave here different than the way we came, Lord. That we can go out, Lord, and and have a confidence in this relationship that we have with you, Lord. Not with an association that God sent a prophet and and that and that that the you know that that mysteries have been revealed. Lord, all those things are a result of an experience and a walk with you, Lord. That those things become real, become a reality, become an experience, Father, uh in a in in the word, an experience in the word, not in just an anointing or an emotion or an atmosphere, but something that that is the word in us. Lord, you said that would be our hope that that that it would be your spirit in us, our hope of glory. And so, Lord, let that become more reality as we minister your word. Lord, minister to the hearts. Lord, take control. I surrender solely and completely unto you now in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. Praise God. Let's read. Let's read our scripture. Amen. 1 Corinthians chapter 12. Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. You know that ye were Gentiles carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led. Wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit. And there are differences of administration but the same Lord. And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which workketh all. Did he say some things? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; All &gt;&gt; in all. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; All in all, we need to first understand that God is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that he is the word. that in the beginning, before there was even a word, he was the self-existent one. He was the allencompassing spirit of the universe, of eternities, of dimensions, of everything that we could possibly imagine. He was the self-existent one. And there's nothing that exists that that would &gt;&gt; even potentially exist that was not and does not exist by him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. But God had something that he wanted to express. And when he and when the word when he said let there be light, there was a word light that was that came into manifestation. And that's when we we could see the manifestation of God by the word that he spoke. That's what that's what the logus is. It is the word that comes forth from God and that creates all things that exists in all things. The worlds were framed by the logos, by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so, um, I want to read a quote here from brother Brandham. He says here in the five identifications of the true church of the living God in 1960 he says you say well brother Brandham I believe. Well listen and I've never received the Holy Ghost. No you don't believe yet. &gt;&gt; He says you are just believing unto belief. &gt;&gt; You have hope. That's why, you know, people people talk about God, people talk about who he is, but really, you can go out there and I guarantee you that 95% of the people that you speak to on who is God, you're going to get 95 different answers. &gt;&gt; You're going to get all kinds of different interpretations. But here, here, Brother Brandham is saying, "Have you received God?" The Holy Ghost is God. It's the spirit of God. And then he goes out and he goes on to read, you know, 1 Corinthians chapter 12, which we just read, but I'm going to skip that. And he says, he goes on and he says, "You don't know nothing about it until you've received the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; You don't know nothing about God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care what you You know, listen, today we're going to listen, we're going to say some things today that is going to that that's going to challenge a lot of people, &gt;&gt; whether you're in the house of the Lord or you're online. Uh listen, I love it. I want to be challenged. I want to know what I believe. I want to know where I'm standing. Amen. I want to know that God is God and that I'm having a real experience. I'm not having some church membership. Not interested in church membership. We're way down the road, saints. &gt;&gt; This is not about church membership. This is about being the church of the living God, the body of Jesus Christ that the Bible talks about. Amen. He says, "You say I accept Jesus Christ as my personal savior. Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?" &gt;&gt; Oh my, I love that. I loved it when Pastor Simon, you know, he he he tells many times, you know, how how he came into that revelation at a very young uh, you know, early stage of his walk with the Lord where where the Holy Spirit showed him that, hey, you need to receive the Holy Ghost even if you think you're in the message. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's something here that's going on that that's beyond what you think is the is the is the culture of the message. Amen. Praise God. And so here, brother Brandham says it and he says, "If you don't, you can't even call him the Lord." Imagine that. You can't even call him your Lord. You want him to do things in your life. You want to You want to see God move. You want to see things change. You want to see healing in your life. And yet if you haven't received the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; you can't even call him Lord when you pray. You can't even call him Lord. That's why many are going to come to him on that day and say, "Lord, Lord, &gt;&gt; have I not cast out devils? Have I not prayed for the sick? Have I not spoke in tongues? Have I not?" He says, "I never knew you." &gt;&gt; Imagine that statement coming out of the Lord. I never knew you. Depart from me, ye workers of iniquity. Knowing what is true. That's why there's a lot of churches out there, but they're afraid of this. &gt;&gt; They're afraid of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's why when when when when you get into things like this, it starts to stir the pot a little bit and people start to get a little bit uncomfortable. So, if I see you starting to squirm in your seats, it's okay. &gt;&gt; That's all right. Let the Holy Spirit have his way in your life. Amen. Let him change. Let him transform your thoughts. Let him bring his nature into you. He says, listen, he goes on. He says you can't even call because he's not Lord. He's an historical being that you now he even says it by faith have accepted. So here now we can see that somebody can actually accept Jesus Christ and not have him. They can they can say, "Oh, you know, a lot of times you come to this church, just come here. Come to the altar. Now repeat after me and confess it with your mouth, that Jesus is your Lord, and you can leave now and everything's good. You're saved. All is well. Praise God." Everybody clap their hands. Glory to God. Amen. That's not it. &gt;&gt; No sir. He says by faith have accept but when he comes into you &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost he is your Lord. &gt;&gt; Now he now he comes into you now he is your Lord. And no man can call Jesus Lord only by the Holy Ghost. So until you are born of the spirit of God and the Holy Spirit is in you, then if you are, you're born into this kingdom and you're part of the church, you're the called out ones, then see you see it. All right. Now, praise God. Amen. Glory to God. And so here, let's go to the next slide. our scripture here. He says, now in John chapter 14 verse 26, he says here, but the comforter, now this is Jesus speaking, okay? So he's telling us, he's telling us about the Holy Ghost. But the comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. So here Jesus now, he's making it clear. Now, a lot of the people out there, they read this scripture and they say, "See, there's the Trinity. There it is right there. Jesus is saying that that the comforter is the Holy Ghost which the Father will send in my name and he shall teach you all things. And so right away if you don't have a revelation on who God is, you're going to look at that and you're going to see the Trinity. &gt;&gt; And you see, we know that that is false. &gt;&gt; There is no such thing as a Trinity. That's why we're going to be digging deep here. We're going to be looking in to see how the Holy Spirit unveils himself and makes himself personal to you so that when you read things like this, you understand your absolute. You understand where you stand. Next scripture, John 15 26 and 27. And he says, "But when the comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth which proceedth from the Father, he shall testify of me, and ye shall also bear witness, and ye that because ye have been with me from the beginning." &gt;&gt; Now, what's Jesus talking about there? See, a lot of people will read that scripture and they will look at that and they'll say, "See, there's the comforter. Jesus saying God's going to send the comforter whom I will send whom I will send unto you from the father." &gt;&gt; But he said I &gt;&gt; But he said I. Yeah. So, so what what is is there some confusion here? Yeah. You know, a lot of people they get confused by that. That's why, you know, you dig into things like this, right away it starts to, you know, cause people to squirm because they don't want to dig deep. They don't want to allow the Holy Spirit to deal with their lives to get out all the stuff that they need to repent of and move out of their lives, all the teachings that they've had growing up, all the the the theological background and and and traditions of man and all those things. They get so challenged by things like that. But here he's saying whom I will send unto you. But in the last scripture he says but the father whom the father will send in my name. And now he's saying whom I will send unto you from the father. You see you got to know that that that god before he was even father he was god. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he was expressing himself in manifestations and in dispensations. This is what we're going to be seeing here as we go deeper into the purpose of the Holy Ghost. We want to know what it is and what it's supposed to produce in our lives. So here now we we can see here and ye shall bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning. Which beginning? What it was? those disciples that that had just started with him on that day. &gt;&gt; No. He says, "Father, show them that that that that you have been with me from before the foundations of the world. Show them that that they were that they are that they are mine. Show them that all that the that the Father hath given me will come. Show them my Let them hear my voice." Well, if they hear my voice, that means that that that that they're my sheep. Let them know that they are one as we are one. &gt;&gt; Let them know that they are a part of me. Amen. This is what we're interested in understanding. But here, let's look at, you know, some of the common teachings of what is the Holy Spirit? You know, I did some research on the internet and over here it says the very first thing that they described when I put in the question was this. The Holy Spirit is the third person of the Godhead. &gt;&gt; The very first statement, the third person, three people in one. We know that's absolute nonsense. &gt;&gt; That's confusion. &gt;&gt; There's no sense to that. If you've seen me, Jesus said, you've seen the Father, Phillip. Amen. &gt;&gt; He It's not I that doeth the works, but the father which dwelleth in me? Who was the father? It was the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; So who who was it that came to Mary? Was it the Holy Ghost or was it or was it so so did did did uh did Mary have two fathers? Because one was of the father and the other one was of the Holy Ghost. So which one was it? You see? Well, unless you've got an absolute, and that's the first thing you've got to come to a place to understand that you must know who God is, that there is no other God beside him, that he is the one and only, there is only one Lord, thy God is one. Amen. Until that is a reality in your life, you're going to be confused. &gt;&gt; I don't care how long you've been in this message. I don't care how long you think you've understood. You're going to be challenged today. you're going to be looking a little bit deeper into the purpose of God. Amen. That's what that's what we're doing. And so he now he they go on to say he equally with the father and the son is God. As the Nyian uh you know constipalopian creed of AD 3:21 says he is the lord and giver of life who proceeds from the father and the son who with the father and the son together worshiped and glorified who spoke by the prophets. He is the spirit that is he is immaterial and he is holy that is to be set apart and without sin. We also knowing the following about the Holy Spirit. He goes on and it talks about the Holy Spirit is personal and scripture presents the Holy Spirit as a divine person. He is a divine person. You see, if you're reading this by revelation and you've got a revelation of who he is, this makes perfect sense because you've got a revelation of who they're talking about. But without revelation, with the teachings of man, an unrepented individual will hold to those teachings as a stubborn individual that will not allow the Holy Spirit to even begin the process of bringing him to a place where he can indwell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so he thinks and knows Corinthians chapter 2:10. He can be grieved in in Ephesians 4:30. He intercedes in Romans 8:26. Makes decisions according to his will in 1 Corinthians 12:7-11. And comforts and counselss in John 14. The spirit appoints specific people to specific tasks in like Acts chapter 13 and chapter 20. The Holy Spirit is divine. They go to say the fact that the Holy Spirit is God is clearly seen in many passages of scripture. In Acts 5 chapter uh chapter 5:es 3 and 4, Peter confronts Ananas as to why he lied to the Holy Spirit, you know, because now the Holy Spir he's he's a he's an enforcer. Amen. tells him that he that he had that that that he that that he had lied and and that you cannot lie to the Holy Spirit. You can't lie to God. That's true. God knows every one of you. God knows every situation that you're dealing with right now. Amen. And further, the Holy Spirit possesses the characteristics of God in that he is omnipresent. Amen. Where can I go from that from your spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? If I go to to the heavens, you are there. If I make my bed in the depths, you are there. Amen. Psalms 1:39. He's omniscient. Amen. He is eternal. Hebrews 9:14. And the spirit does things that only God can do, such as create, inspire scripture, and reveal the deep things of God. 1 Corinthians chapter 2. Amen. Praise God. These are the attributes of the spirit of God. These are the elements of the Holy Spirit that that you that you take for granted sometimes. You don't realize, you know, the depths of the Holy Ghost that you've that you've that you've entered into a relationship, the depths of this relationship and how powerful it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is it is the power to to overcome anything that comes your way. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you've received it and and you've got a revelation of it and that you know that he is in you. Amen. Where can I go? Glory to God. The Holy Spirit is as much God as the father and the son. It says as seen in the great commission. Jesus said that believers are to be baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit. All listen, they go on to say all three persons of the godhead are equal and share one name. &gt;&gt; You see it sounds very nice but but it absolutely makes no sense. &gt;&gt; It makes no sense because now which one do you fully surrender to? &gt;&gt; You know which one do you fully surrender to? You see, because you're you're in your mind there's confusion and you're not seeing him in the way that you should be seeing him. Amen. Praise God. You know, it goes on to talk about how the Holy Spirit is active and you know, um that how the Holy Spirit's presence in your life as a believer is beyond consequence. He he permanently indwells in believers and seals them until the day of redemption. God doesn't seal everybody. Amen. &gt;&gt; God seals those that are that are from the foundations of the world in the Lamb's book of life whose names were written before the foundations of this world. Listen, if God is omniscient, if God is omniresent, if God knows all things, then he knows exactly who you are. He knows where you're seated right now. He knows your condition. He knows if there's any confusion in your mind about your experience with him. And if there's a desire in your heart to to to to have this confusion lifted, it's because there's something in you that's of God. &gt;&gt; There's something in you that desires to know truth and wants to be set free and liberated so that you can live for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. You know, it goes on and I'm not going to read all of it. You know the the Holy Spirit also gives believers wisdom by which to understand spiritual things. We know that the spirit of truth. That's the comforter. He'll guide you what? Into all truth. How can the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost? &gt;&gt; Filled the the the the disciples in the upper room, filled them with his presence. Come out under the anointing. and Peter under the anointing in Acts chap 2 verse 38 and people will say well you know Jesus said go ye into all the world baptizing them in the name I'm going to repeat that in the name &gt;&gt; of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost. That name is no other name that man must be saved by but by the name of Jesus Christ. And Peter on the day of Pentecost, filled with the Holy Ghost. Okay? And now we just read here that the Holy Ghost is the comforter. He'll guide you into all truth. Now remember, Peter was the same one that denied the Lord on the night that he was being taken for the crucifixion. Three times he denied him, &gt;&gt; but yet he didn't have the fullness of the Holy Ghost yet. He was under an anointing when when Jesus sent out the disciples. He sent them out. He says, "I give you power to cast out demons, to lay hands on the sick, to do all of these things." But the Holy Ghost was not given until after he was glorified. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to be looking at this a little deeper and see how it is that that so that we can better understand. Amen. the the the the true reality. And so Peter here on he goes repent. Now that's the first thing that he said. Imagine that people don't repent. People have not truly repented. They want the Holy Ghost, but they don't want to repent. They think that they need the Holy Ghost in order to repent. People have it all confused. Oh, brother, if I get the Holy Ghost, then then I can overcome anything. No, no, no, no, no. That's not what he said. He said, "Repent, every one of you, be baptized in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall receive the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; So, there's a process there of repent, baptism, receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That doesn't change, saints. Praise God. Remember, listen, I don't want you to be confused by by you, you know, because we all know, you know, we're down the road. We know that there's an attribute of God in us that was placed in us before the foundations of the world. &gt;&gt; But let me say that if that attribute is there, it will not alter the word of God. &gt;&gt; It will not variate from the word of God. &gt;&gt; It will come under submission to the word of God and it will bring into manifestation exactly what the word said. &gt;&gt; That's how you know that somebody has truly repented because they come according to the word. &gt;&gt; They there's no way they'll deny the word of God. Amen. Praise God. Let's go on here. So, the Holy Spirit is personal. We can know him, fellowship with him because he's divine. We can worship and obey him because he is active. We can rely on his perfect work in our lives. but only when we've truly received him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Go to the next slide. Now, last week I mentioned to you, if you've got time, go back, read or listen to the message, what is the Holy Ghost? Because I'll tell you, a lot of my notes and a lot of quotes are coming right out of that message from 1959. I went back and listened to that a couple of times and I'm just I'm just rejoicing. I'm rejoicing. There's so much in there that that the Holy Remember, the Holy Spirit will bring light in the particular season that you're in &gt;&gt; so that you can recognize the word for your day. &gt;&gt; He puts light on his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; He He makes it live. Amen. A lot of people see they they've they've taken this what I'm saying right now. I went back and listened to the to the message. I listen to the tapes. I listen to them. I listen to them every single day. But I'm feeding on the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I'm not feeding on a man. &gt;&gt; I'm feeding on the Holy Ghost. I'm feeding on the revealed word. the the actually the part of the word that's not even written. &gt;&gt; This is the this is the ministry that we're actually under right now. But I don't want to go too far down the road here, &gt;&gt; but this is the element that we are under. &gt;&gt; We're not feeding on on man. We're not feeding on written word. We're not feeding on scripture. &gt;&gt; Everybody's feeding on scripture, but but the spirit gives it life. &gt;&gt; That's what we're talking about here. We want the Holy Ghost to give us the right interpretation on the word of God so that we can have a real experience with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that when we lay hands on the sick, we've got a revelation of what we're doing. It's not just some tradition. James says, "Anoint them with oil. They shall be forgiven of their sin." Period. Even if they're unrepented, they come in the into the presence of God. Come on. We're not we're not this is not some some uh you know some assembly line that has a you know uh the end result is going to produce this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the reality of God. This is what the Holy Ghost there's a purpose in the Holy Ghost. We need to understand that purpose so that we can have the right relationship not just with God but even with one another. &gt;&gt; Because I I can show you the scripture that says when you've been endued with power &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost, go and strengthen your brethren. &gt;&gt; How am I going to strengthen you if I ain't got the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; How am I going to do anything to help you if I don't have a true experience with the Holy Ghost and the word of God for this hour? I can't help anybody out there. &gt;&gt; I can't strengthen my brother because the strength doesn't come from me. &gt;&gt; It comes by the revelation that's on me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It comes by the power of his resurrection in our lives. Brother Glenn. Amen. Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So here now listen what he says. upon this place we wish to approach the subject which I think is the outstanding subject of today. I think that you know what when I when I heard brother Brandham say that and I've heard you know other ministers you know quote this quote but when I heard it I you know and and and and it was because God knew that I was digging. Oh, God knows when you're digging. &gt;&gt; Amen. God knows when you're when you're you're sincere and you're saying Lord let me understand let me have understanding on your word Lord that that that you alone can give this kind of understanding when I seen this I said outstanding subject of today he said yeah today right now this is outstanding this is something that that people are confused he goes on and he says of of what is the Holy Spirit what is it and now the reason I've taken these subjects in line like this. You cannot come and receive the Holy Spirit unless you know what it is. Makes perfect sense. And you cannot receive it if you know what it is unless you believe it's given to you. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute here. That you mean? You mean I I need to know and believe that it's for me? Yeah, you need to understand who you are in the day that you're living in. &gt;&gt; You you need to understand your life. You're con you're your your your your brokenness. You need to understand why you've come to a place in your life where you are you you you just you've come so far and you're looking to go deeper. You're looking to go further with God, but you don't know how you're going to go any deeper. And then all of a sudden the Lord comes into your Now, now I'm not talking about going deeper with God at the stage of your life like I just looked back at my own life and I knew that my condition was was a broken condition. I was in a broken vessel. I was in a drugaddicted vessel. I was in a broken marriage. Our marriage was falling apart. I was in a broken uh you know in a broken condition even business from a business perspective. I was at a point in 1993 where I was in in 1991 where I was ready to to just figure out exactly how to exit this life because of of the of the disaster that I was in the midst of when when the real estate crash came and I lost everything including the next 20 years of my wages. That's how much I had lost. I said, "How can I how can this move on? How can this go on?" But then there came a a point where I knew I there was something that came into my path which was this message. And when it did, it was God himself. and he had come into the into the into the part of my life where I needed him the most, not knowing what I really needed. But then when the the this word, this reality, the spirit of God came and and dealt with my life in a way that that that I that nobody else could do it. I realized this was for me. &gt;&gt; This was what I was looking for all my life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was looking for that perfect high. I was looking for that for the reason and the purpose of living. I was looking for that that next, you know, that that next uh way of of getting that next adrenaline shot, looking for that next, you know, thing to satisfy. You'll never find it. If you are a son or a daughter of God, and you always were, &gt;&gt; you will come into contact with the Holy Ghost and you will be able to say that you believe it's given to you. &gt;&gt; It was for you. &gt;&gt; He knew you. &gt;&gt; He saw you. He saw you in the condition you were in. He saw you in that situation. He saw you when you took that blow, Brother Tim. He knew exactly what you would need. Your mind would have been shattered without his coming into your life and and intervening in but you knew that it was for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So you need to know that this is something that that's for me. Amen. And then he goes on to say here he goes on to say here um uh uh and it's for you. And then you cannot know whether you've got it or not unless you know what results it brings. Amen. So if you know what it is and you and who it is and who it is to what action it brings when it comes, then you'll know what you've got when you get it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. Just that's just would settle it. He says, "Amen." Now, praise God. Brother Brandon preached these messages in 1959. He preached two nights in a row with um the first night, what is the Holy Ghost? The second night, what was the Holy Ghost given for? A couple of nights later, he does questions and answers on the Holy Ghost. Now it's important for us to understand that there is a difference between the spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, the baptism of the Holy Spirit or the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost himself. We need to understand there is a difference. But yet, I'm going to tell you, it's all the same person. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. So, so don't want to bring any confusion, but I want to tell you there is a difference, but yet it's all him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And as we move through these next few services, we're trusting that the Holy Ghost will reveal and bring clarity to us personally. Amen. To help us really understand what we have or don't have. have, don't have. &gt;&gt; You understand? Because we're just human beings. We're just walking this walk. We're trusting God every day of our lives. We know he's a reality, but yet we face situations every single day. The enemy fights. The enemy was fighting hard this morning for me to even get here, saints. It's a real It's a reality. I'm telling you. I don't I don't understand it sometimes. I I I just But but I say, "Lord, this has got to be, you know, this has got to be real because I don't understand why this pressure is on me. Why this this, you know, this uh uh this fight that that that's going on in the atmospheres, but you got to be still. You got to know that God is God. and you got to just move forward and that's it. &gt;&gt; If you listen I there's there's one thing I can tell you. I know God is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I know that God is is not some some uh you know some emotion that I got caught up into. &gt;&gt; I know where I'm standing with the Lord, but I also know that I got to fight an enemy every single day. So don't think that when you get the Holy Ghost that everything is just fine and everything is just wonderful and you can just go sit on your cloud and rejoice and sing songs all day long. &gt;&gt; You got to overcome. &gt;&gt; You got to fight. But if you But you know, as we go through this, I I'm I'm I'm trusting that you're going to understand some things that are available to you as a son or a daughter of God that will give you strength in a time when you need it. A supernatural strength that only comes by the Holy Spirit. Amen. By the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. Praise God. And so, let's look at some things here. We want clarity. So, you know, I was challenged. You know, I've been studying. I've been listening to different messages, different ministers, and and as as a minister, that's what we do as a pastor of the church. I'm I'm I'm hungry for for what God wants to bring to his sheep. &gt;&gt; My my concern is for for the sheep. I just want, you know, I want something that's going to be a balanced diet that's going to give them strength, that's going to give them uh, you know, uh, encouragement, going to give them overcoming power and ability by by by understanding the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. You need to understand when Jesus was saying that that they may see what is the truth. He was the the word see if you actually look it up in the Greek it means understand that you may understand. There are things that you naturally need to understand in order to have a real full experience with the Holy Ghost. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So here now I want I want you to understand something here in the Old Testament. Okay? Spirit of God is mentioned 14 times in the Old Testament. I I went right into my concordance. I went in. I looked at every I counted every single one. I hear things. But then I go into the scripture. I want to I want to understand. I want to see it. I want to because then when I go into it, I see even more. And here now, the spirit of God is mentioned 14 times. In the New Testament, it's mentioned nine times. Spirit of God. Remember, we're talking about the one that was before he was even known to be anything. He was the self-existent one. So, he's the spirit of God. And that's how they knew him in the Old Testament up to a certain time. and then and and to certain prophets, kings and priests. But here now in the Old Testament, the Holy Spirit is mentioned three times, only three times. And I mean Holy Spirit together, not just the word holy. If you put holy, you'll catch it 600 times. But in the New Testament, it's mentioned four times. In the Old Testament, Holy Ghost is mentioned zero times. Zero. Not once is it mentioned in the Old Testament. In the New Testament, it's mentioned 89 times. Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now, do you think does everybody believe that all scripture is written by men that were moved by the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Amen. that were inspired by the Holy Spirit to write the things that they wrote. Do you think that God would give them confusion when he when where where in in the in the beginning from the book of Genesis right up until Exodus chapter uh six I'm not sure but I've got it here where where you know holy is first introduced where it was only known as spirit of God that the spirit of God brooded over that the spirit of God came that the spirit of God did all these things and then when they would when they would write Holy Spirit that they had that that they were just, oh, I'm just going to call it Holy Spirit now and then in the and then not even mention Holy Ghost at all in the Old Testament and then all of a sudden mention it 89 times in the New Testament. &gt;&gt; Why why would he do that? Why why would the Holy Ghost Why would the spirit of God inspire these men to write in those ways and put those th write it exactly the way that that that he wanted him to write it? I'm going to say to you, it's because he had a different thought and manifestation behind the thought of when he mentioned Holy Spirit and when he mentioned Holy Ghost in the context of how he mentions it. That's why you need to go back and study these things. I've been studying these things. And when I go in there and you start to actually read the scriptures where he mentions Holy Spirit, then he mentions Holy Ghost, you you will see that there's a different context of what God is actually conveying in the thought behind the words Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost. There's a reason behind it. there's a there's a different manifestation of God that goes with the way that it's written. &gt;&gt; Then we look at So, so remember the writers of the Bible, they're all catching the very thoughts and writing it exactly as they receive it. Amen. Moses received things. He saw it. He heard it. He wrote it. Amen. Praise God. But but what we're seeing here is that the the this is why it's so important to have the spirit of revelation in your life &gt;&gt; because the spirit of revelation will immediately clear the confusion &gt;&gt; of even the godhead. Even though you don't even need a revelation to know that God is one, &gt;&gt; you don't need a revelation on that. I can show you scripture after scripture that says there is no God beside me, before me, nor shall there be one after me. I am the Lord thy God. I am one. Period. &gt;&gt; He never said, "I am two." It's just as simple as that. But yet, you need a revelation to understand when you're reading the scriptures and how it pertains to you in this day and in this hour because it pertains to your salvation. It pertains to your future. &gt;&gt; It pertains to you overcoming tomorrow &gt;&gt; when you leave this place and you've got to deal with the things of this world and the situations that you're going to have to deal with as a human being. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, so the different So, what what is the difference then between Holy Spirit, Holy Ghost, baptism of the Holy Spirit, baptism of the Holy Ghost? It's the manifestations &gt;&gt; under different dispensations of what God was manifesting himself in and through the people to bring his purpose, his word for that day to that particular people, nation, kingdom, king, whatever the situation was when the Holy Spirit would anoint back in the Old Testament. He was anointing them with the Holy Spirit. He was not embodying them in the holy with the Holy Spirit. He was anointing all the kings, the priests and the prophets. That's why you will not hear Holy Ghost in the Old Testament because Holy Ghost was the coming of the Lord where God himself now was going to come to the earth. Yes, he showed it in type when he came as Melzdc and and and met up with Abraham. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was Those are all types and shadows of what he's going to do and what he's doing right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the dispensation and the time whereby the Holy Ghost would possess you personal &gt;&gt; was was left for this age, &gt;&gt; for this time for the open book to be revealed so that we could understand what was written the the the the element that that brings you into a personal oneness with God to where you and God become one. &gt;&gt; Not two, one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So why is this the case? Why is there different manifestations? And what is the difference? The difference is the dispensations and manifestations of the spirit of God, Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost, yet all the same. But did you know that the word holy, and I just, you know, I just digging this up this morning, the word holy was only first introduced in Exodus 3:E 5 with Moses when when the Lord called unto Moses to the burning bush and said, "Take off thy shoes, for this ground that you are now standing on is holy ground." God was changing a dispensation right there. God was now starting to put an eye on a certain people, on a certain group of individuals. God was now going to convey and manifest himself in a different dispensation, the the dispensation of of of the law coming down to the people where God now would be known as God above us. Amen. God above us. that that that the people of Israel would know God now as as God that that was the the God of Israel. They had heard about, you know, about the God of Israel. They had heard about, you know, Abraham. They had heard about Moses, about Noah. They had heard about what God did through all of these patriarchs. But now they were going to experience God for themselves because God was now looking at them. &gt;&gt; God. Now look, he goes on here, holy ground. Then in Exodus 12, look, notice, notice the progression here. I just saw this this morning. Then in Exodus 12:1 16 where he says that the first day, the seventh day shall be a holy convocation, no manner of work. Hallelujah. The seventh day, the opening of the seventh seal, the the the the the seven seals being revealed, all these things. When when you start to look at these things, you're going to see there's there's something here that the Lord was conveying in all of this. Then he goes on, he says in Exodus 15:13, he has redeemed a people to guide them into a holy habitation where they were going to come into a holy habitation. And then in in in 19 in verse 19 or chapter 19 verse 6, ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and an holy nation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, praise God. If that isn't exactly what he's doing right now. Amen. In all of these things, here I go to digging in here to see about holy to understand why it was, you know, holy, where it started, what it means, and everything else. But these here, God was showing himself because, you know, you've been given the understanding. You've been given the mind of Christ. You can look now and you can see God in every scripture. Brother Bram says if you don't see Jesus Christ from Genesis to Revelation, go back and read it again. You're going to see him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. before this people uh you know before God made himself known to Israel and and come to them as a as a called out set a set apart people they worshiped they they got so corrupt in their thinking God had to destroy them before that with Noah God had to send a flood to wipe out the the the whole the whole earth because the mind of man without God without any leadership man goes and and and pride takes over and man wants to be something. Man wants to make himself something. What did they end up doing? They ended up to where every single thought that they had was corrupt. God says, "I got to wipe it all out." And that's why we had the seven different dispensations that we know of. the dispensation of innocence. Adam and Eve, they were in communion with God back in the Garden of Eden before any sin had come. They would walk in the cool of the night. They would have fellowship with the self-existent one. They were expressed in his image. They had perfect harmony with the father. They were walking with him. They were living in perfect total innocence because the Holy Spirit, the spirit of God was all around them. They didn't even know they were naked. There was no nakedness. They were absolutely pure in their heart. Don't you desire that that relationship back again? Don't you want to have that kind of a walk with God? Glory to God. But then the dispensation of conscience came in because of sin. They became conscious of their sin. Man becomes conscious of his unbelief. Oh my goodness. And then it goes into the dispensation of human government. And God has to come in and wipes out the whole earth and except for Noah and his family to start all over again. Then comes the dispensation of the promise where God comes to Abraham, &gt;&gt; calls him out, brings him out from amongst his people. Abraham recognizes this unknown God because Abraham was a pagan just like many of us. Until God came into our lives, we were lost in sin. We didn't know what was good, what was bad. We didn't we we would just justify everything by our own lusts and desires. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Abraham received the call and he also received a promise. And that promise now has come to you and me. Amen. Then came the the the dispensation of the law through Moses which lasted 1500 years. Glory to God. And then comes the dispensation of grace where Jesus Christ, the Lord himself, God now coming to change his manifestation to come into a new dispensation so that he could reveal himself personal so that he could now come under the dispensation of grace where man had sinned again. Man had fallen into a state where there was no hope for man. But if a man sin, a man must die. And so he now comes and makes that sacrificial price and pays the penalty. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that we could enter in. But here it was God changing manifestation. Now it was God now coming to unite with man. You see, when we talk about Holy Spirit, when we talk about Holy Ghost, when we talk about the spirit of God, it's always in relation to man. That's why it's relevant to us because it concerns you. You need to know what the Holy Ghost is. You need to know if you've got it or if you don't got it because it's a re it's it's in relation to man. And Jesus now was coming under that dispensation. And then the final dispensation will be the millennial dispensation of 1,000 years. But each of these dispensations had different manifestations of God. And God's purpose in each age, the Lord had separated people who he wanted to manifest himself through. And he does it by the Holy Spirit and now by the Holy Ghost. Glory to God. And in the Old Testament, God was manifesting himself in in different dispensations by anointing prophets, kings, priests with his spirit, showing that he was that he existed, that he was a reality, and that he had a purpose &gt;&gt; in every one of those manifestations that he would anoint each king, priest, prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had a purpose in it. When the Holy Spirit would come upon any of them, it was God saying, "I have called you &gt;&gt; for a purpose." &gt;&gt; Anytime the spirit of God would come on an individual, that's why you go back, you read the Old Testament, and the spirit of the Lord came upon Elijah, came upon Jeremiah, came upon all the prophets, and he would say, "Go and tell the people, thus sayeth the Lord." It would be the anointing of his spirit that would come upon them to so that God could bring his word into manifestation under that dispensation for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Look at David. God set David apart to be the next king of Israel as a young boy. He goes and he slays Goliath. What do you think gave David the strength and the anointing to slay Goliath? It was the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; That's what David had. He was anointed for the purpose of God to go and slay the enemy. But yet, even with the Holy Spirit anointing him, he committed adultery. He went and committed murder. You see, he wasn't he he he was under the anointing of the Holy Spirit. God would use him for a purpose and then he would still be able to sin and do things and show that that that there was something in him that had not been completed yet. &gt;&gt; That's why we have to come to this day. &gt;&gt; That's why without us they cannot be made perfect. They're waiting on on what we are going to manifest in this day and in this hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look at Samson under the anointing because you say, "Oh, they had the Holy Spirit. They had the Holy Ghost. They were anointed by the Holy Spirit. They were anointed by the Holy Ghost. They were anointed by the spirit of God to have supernatural strength to do the things that they did." But it wasn't until until Samson's hair was cut that he lost his strength, &gt;&gt; his Nazerite vow unto the Lord. God had called Samson for a purpose. And when God calls you for a purpose and you reject that purpose, you're going to find yourself in sin. You're going to find your life falling apart. You're going to realize that this cannot continue. I I'm missing something. There's an element that I'm missing. So the evidence of the Holy Spirit back in the Old Testament was not that they would live perfect lives. And the evidence of the Holy Ghost in this hour is the same thing. You're not going to live a perfect life. Don't be thinking you can live a perfect life thinking that if you get the Holy Ghost, that's all you need. You need much more than that. You need the person of the of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You need Jesus Christ himself. Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. So when the Holy Spirit or the Holy Ghost comes on a person, they can never remain the same. That's for sure. Because a process starts to take place within their lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; David knew that the anointing of the spirit of God was on him. And when he had fallen into sin, listen to what he says. Lord, take not thine Holy Spirit from me. It was on his life. It was around his life. It was prospering his life. It gave him an anointing and a strength. But when he had fallen into sin, he lost that anointing. He felt alone. He felt, you know, Lord, take not thine Holy Spirit from me, which means that he had this on his life. &gt;&gt; And it's not something that once you've received it, once you once you've truly come alive and come to a revelation of this, you can never lose it. Let's read the next quote. Now I want to talk on it as the Holy Spirit being a sign for it is a sign. We realize that that all promises is given to us by Abraham and Abraham was the father of the promise because God gave the promise to Abraham and to his seed after him. The promise was made to Abraham and to his seed. And this sign is uh to a covenant people. So we know that when God is going to give the Holy Ghost, he's giving it to a covenant people. He's given it to a to a people that he he he already knows who you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, there is a vast difference between just a Christian and a Holy Ghostfilled Christian. &gt;&gt; There's a big difference. &gt;&gt; And now we're going to get this from the scripture and place it just exactly in the scripture. The first the first place there is a Christian professed to be a Christian. But if this Christian has not yet been filled with the Holy Ghost, he's only in process of being a Christian. So, you're, you know, you're sitting there and you're hearing this and you're you're looking at your experience and you're wondering where do I fit in all of this? Remember, if you're a son or a daughter of God, you can never ever be lost. So, get that out of your mind that, oh, maybe I'm lost. If you're a son or a daughter of God, you can never be lost. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "But if this Christian has not been filled with the Holy Ghost, he's only in the process of being a Christian." See, he has professed to believe it. He's working to it, but God has not yet given him this spirit of the Holy Ghost. He's not yet reached that goal with God that God has recognized it. You will know when you have entered into that relationship with God. Remember when God comes into your life, you have to change. &gt;&gt; Your nature begins to change. If you have, if listen, if you're still in the same condition that you were a year ago, today, &gt;&gt; you need to check your walk with God. &gt;&gt; You need to take a closer look because his nature has to be taking over your nature. &gt;&gt; Because his nature has a purpose in coming into you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember, the Holy Ghost will not come into somebody unless God has a purpose for that individual. &gt;&gt; You can come into the church, you can get under the anointing. Oh, we had some wonderful meetings over here a couple of weeks ago. My God, the people were shouting. They were rejoicing in the in the presence of God. And there was such an anointing in the house that day. Oh, that over that weekend. And so many people were left rejoicing. I bet you you go back and talk to 80% of those people. They'll tell you, "Oh, brother, yeah, wow, those meetings, they were wonderful." But man, what a fight. You know, I'm still dealing with this. I'm still dealing with that. Of course, because it doesn't just end with an anointing. Your experience cannot be based on you coming to certain meetings and getting a fresh anointing. All you got was a baptism of the Holy Ghost. And do you need that? Yes, you need that because we know that you know the the whole process of of receiving the Holy Ghost. Luther, Wesley, Pentecost, and then the Holy Ghost himself, justification, sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But here we've got a prophet that was sent to us in the 20th century who was the messenger to the Leodysian church age. It went now beyond Pentecost. He was the one that was bringing this message in 1959. He knew that there was a dispensational change that was in motion. &gt;&gt; He was the one that introduced you know that nobody ever talked about this until he brought it out. What the Holy Ghost actually is. What is the Holy Ghost? People had a a conception. If you talk to the Pentecostals, it was speaking in tongues. It was gifts of the spirit, shouting, praising God. Oh, coming getting that anointing on your life. You come in, you get baptized, you go in a wet sinner. You go in a dry sinner, you come out a wet sinner. &gt;&gt; No change, no transformation, no nature change. That's not the Holy Ghost of this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Ghost of this hour will bring absolute change in your life. &gt;&gt; You will not remain the same today after this message here today. If you're under this anointing, if you're catching the thoughts, I can't convey to you in in in word, but I'm trusting that the Holy Spirit is speaking to your hearts and giving you an understanding. You you've got to progress. You've got to shake yourself. You've got to understand that the Holy Ghost is a is a lifechanging experience in your life and that things must change. They cannot remain the same. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Go to the next slide. I need a Kleenex. Some paper towel, please. Here he says, "He called Abraham, and Abraham moved out of his country and went into a strange land to dwell among strange people." And that was a type of when God calls a man to stop his meanness, repent of his sins. He turns them from the crowd that he was in to live in a new crowd. Amen. This is what God does when when when you've truly received his spirit among a new type of people, new types of people. I never knew I had never had any idea I'd be I'd be, you know, mingling with with so many different nations of peoples. peculiar people, very simple, humble people of of every walk of life. But when the Holy Ghost is in there, there's a fellowship divine. &gt;&gt; There's something that overrides how you look, how you think, how you speak, how you how you react to situations. When I get into fellowship with the Holy Ghost in you, it changes my love for you, my my desire to be with you, my my experience walking with you and edifying one another in the Holy Ghost, you come among a new types of people. And then after God found Abraham to be faithful, God's still checking, testing, cleaning, purging things in our lives. &gt;&gt; Because he wants us he wants to he wants to fully indwell us. &gt;&gt; He wants to fully consume you. &gt;&gt; He wants to he wants you to he wants you to give he wants to give you the fullness of the word. &gt;&gt; No more partial no more portion of the word. This is the hour where the fullness of the word, the fullness. And who is the word? It's Christ. &gt;&gt; He wants you to have it all. Amen. But he needs character. He needs maturity. He needs understanding. He needs you to study the word. He doesn't want you to get all caught up into the emotion of the word. It's not about emotion. It's not about yelling and screaming and shouting. Those things are all good. It's not about speaking in tongues. It's not about, you know, prophesying. It's about a humble spirit in the presence of God, willing to submit to his presence that he can change your life and and deal with the things that the enemy has been trying to keep on your life as a stronghold to prevent you into coming into the full maturity of a son or a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Abraham to be faithful to the promise that God gave him. God found him faithful that he would have a that he would have the child and through this child all earth would be blessed. Then God confirmed his faith by giving him a sign and that sign was circumcision and circumcision is a type of the Holy Spirit. It's a type of God vindicating. I'm pleased. I've separated you and now I'm going to place a seal on your life. I'm going to place my spirit upon your life. If you are not displaying the sign of the of the Messiah on your life, if people don't know you as Oh yeah. Oh yeah. When I talk to Tim, oh yeah, he loves the Lord. Yep. He loves to talk about God. Yep. When I talk to brother Eugene, oh yeah, yeah. Yeah. He comes to work, but he's praising God. He's saying God is good. Brother Phillip, he gets into a a job situation and he gets a contract. He says right to their face, "Praise God. God has blessed me by blessing you." Amen. You see all of these things, you've come into a relationship in knowing and and and God is pleased now with your life because you're actually displaying the sign of the Messiah. &gt;&gt; You're you're displaying the fullness of the word that's to come on display. And it's not some, you know, religious spirit. You go into work and say, "Praise God, I'm here. I'm going to pray for everybody today. Everybody repent right now so that we can pray before God." &gt;&gt; What is that? &gt;&gt; That's a religious spirit that's going to send the people further away from God. But if you see somebody that's struggling and you go up to them and you say, "Hey man, I see you're in a bit of a struggle. You mind if I pray for you?" Just personal, that person's going to wonder, "That's different." You see, it's it's because you've you you you know where you are. You know where you're standing. And this this is on display now in your life. It's just who you are. Praise God. Let's go to the next scripture. Ephesians chapter 1 verse 4. It says, "According as he hath chosen us in him," what time is it? 10 to 1. Okay, we're going to go through this and we're going to stop here. according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundations of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. Now, we read this a couple of weeks ago, but I want to bring it up again to to make clear here where we're standing. Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will. Next slide. having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself. He's purposed your life, your your being, your existence. It's in him. He's purposed it within himself. You're a part of him. You are now in the by you receiving the Holy Ghost. The purpose of you receiving the Holy Ghost is so that he can be on display. So that he can reveal his purpose, his will, why he's placed you in him. Amen. That in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth, even in him. in whom we also have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will. So what is the purpose of the Holy Ghost? Why is it that he that you know uh you know if you look at the word holy? Go to the next slide. It says holy is fundamentally meaning that you are being that you're being separated when you've received the Holy Ghost. You've you you've come into that relationship with him. Not by you know we're going to be looking at a lot more next week. This is just this is just really a foundation. We're going to be going deeper into the manifestations of the Holy Ghost and what it what how it brings change in our lives. But you need to understand that his purpose in giving you the Holy Ghost is to separate you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is to put a seal upon your life. He says in Ephesians 4, whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption. &gt;&gt; That seal is something that can never be taken from you. &gt;&gt; It can never be it can never be taken from you because God has sealed you by Holy Ghost. set you apart for a purpose. A distinct call to be holy through being set apart for the purpose of God. Holy. If you look at the word holy, it's not about being living perfect. It's about being set apart and called out by God. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's what holy is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People got that. They they they mis they misunderstand it. That's why a lot of young people, they think that that, you know, oh, if I receive the Holy Ghost, I got to live a perfect life. I just told you Samson received the spirit of God on him. And yet, while he was under that anointing, he was committing adultery. &gt;&gt; Should have been with another woman. He should No, David, he took another man's wife and killed the man while under that anointing. I'm not saying that you're going to go out and live that kind of a life. That's not what I'm saying. But you need to understand that the word holy when God was calling David, God was calling David for the position of being the king of Israel. He was setting him aside for the purpose of displaying his attributes through David. &gt;&gt; Right? And God is calling you as an individual by giving you the holy set aside purpose of God so that your life now can be on display a lot different than what the Christian world out there calls the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; There's a different understanding on the Holy Ghost out there than there is in here. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we must have the understanding of the difference in the manifestations of the spirit. The spirit of all existing one before there was a holy spirit before there was a holy ghost before there was any manifestation was the spirit of Elohim the self-existent one. Then we need to understand the holy spirit is the anointing on man but it is also him. The Holy Ghost is the person of the spirit in man. The Holy Spirit or the Holy Ghost baptism is the spirit of God anointing man. That's why you need the fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost when you come into the house of the Lord. You need to hear the word of God that brings a refreshing into your life that because and it's not an emotion. It doesn't have to be an emotion for somebody. It could be somebody right here, right now that's just sitting there and God is speaking directly to their hearts and maybe one tear coming down because they feel that that that that God, you know, God really wants them to to to have a closer walk with them and and and the anointing is is just revealing the word to them, opening up the scriptures to them, making the word come alive. All of a sudden, now I understand why the the prophet of Revelations 10:1-7 had to be on earth when the mighty angel came down because God was displaying and and bringing the first fruits of what we were to become. Amen. As sons and daughters of God, &gt;&gt; all of this starts to make sense. All of a sudden, now you're not being pulled by the tape ministry by you got to only listen to the tapes. Can you imagine what kind of an experience is that where it's only listen to the tapes, only get high and get emotionally, you know, uh, built up by listening to the tapes and then yet living a life where you're still depressed? You're still oppressed. You don't understand why you're still, you know, uh, bound by certain sin in your life and unbelief. You need the Holy Ghost person to come possess, take control, change you, remove every doubt that you had possibly would allow to come into your life. Amen. You have the baptism of the Holy Spirit. It gives man the supernatural ability to do things. You need the baptism of the Holy Ghost from time to times. You need God to come and anoint you sometimes. Even though you've got him, you still need his ability to come on you every now and then to to open the understanding so you can testify so that you can test give a testimony or or lay your hands on the sick. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And have them recover because of your relationship, your walk with God. He anoints you with his power, with his spirit, with his anointing from time to time. You need it. But there's a difference because somebody could get the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour of the day, Brother Aram said, and still be lost. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm going to stop right here, let the musicians come. Next week, we're going to be looking at how this dispensation changed from Holy Spirit of the Old Testament to the Holy Ghost in the New Testament. We're going to be looking at how John the Baptist was actually the one that would be introducing this this dispensational change &gt;&gt; that would take place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I know there's, you know, this is a bit of a study. It there's a bit of inspiration, but I'm trusting that, you know, that that as we go through this that it's going to put some light on your personal walk with God and give you a strength. You know, this has really strengthened me by understanding. I I've got a better understanding of my calling and why God gave me the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; is because God has a purpose in in in giving me the Holy Ghost. That purpose is on display right here, right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's right here. It's right there. It's right here. It's right there. It's right here. Right there. Right there. Right there. God is showing that his spirit has a purpose. And when that's why we read the first scripture that all the gifts are from the same spirit. He's in all and through all. &gt;&gt; But there's a difference when somebody comes to a a realization of the person of Jesus Christ that they've now come into full contact with him and that now he's in control. He's he's manifesting. He's displaying all the things. I I I'm still walking in the world. I make a mistake. All of a sudden, the blood covers it &gt;&gt; because there's a purpose in the Holy Ghost in me. &gt;&gt; I make a mistake, all of a sudden the blood covers it. &gt;&gt; He says, "No, no, no. My purpose overrides that situation. My purpose overrides your broken relationship with that son or that daughter or that situation." Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It overrides everything that God has put into your life for a test to see. Just like Abraham. Abraham, God says,"Abraham, take that first son and offer him unto me." &gt;&gt; Can you imagine what to his heart? And sometimes you're going through that the exact same experience where you're experiencing God in such a way where you are at a place in your life where you just don't know if you're going to make it. You don't know if you can get through this. You don't know if you're going to be able to do it. But but you just know something inside you is is is pulling you is is drawing you to a closer walk with God that you know that he can he's he's able to do it. He's more than able to do it. Abraham knew that God had told him that you will have a nation come out of you. He says count the stars. He believed the promise. He believed the word of God. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Do you believe what he said about you in this hour? Do you believe that you are the display of Jesus Christ in manifestation by the Holy Ghost to this generation that's now falling apart? &gt;&gt; Do you believe it with all of your heart that God can do whatever needs to be done to to get you through whatever situation you're dealing with right now? &gt;&gt; Believe it, saints. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Father, &gt;&gt; we so appreciate Lord that without you, Father, without your spirit, your anointing, your your person coming to each and every heart, Lord, we will find ourselves at times in such confusion. We will we'll be looking for for the Holy Ghost in so many different ways and so many different avenues. Maybe we got to go to this meeting or go to this camp meeting or join this church or or or maybe I got to maybe I just got to only listen to the tapes or maybe there's so much confusion out there. Lord, won't you come personal to every heart here this this afternoon, Lord, those that are in in the house of God, those that are out listening, Lord, let your spirit and your anointing go to them personally, Lord. Let it be in such a way, Father, that they can know that they know that the that that Lord, bring them to a place where they can truly repent and let go of the things that are holding them back from being all that you want them to be and to manifest in this hour. Granted, Father, we so need you, Lord. I need you more than ever, Lord. &gt;&gt; You know the things that I'm dealing with. You know every heart here. There's nobody perfect in this place, Lord. We need you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We need you in every area, in every situation, Father. We're calling upon you to come, Lord, and and and baptize us with your spirit so that, Lord, we have the supernatural strength to overcome the things that are trying to tear us down, Lord. Granted, Father, we know that nothing can ever change our salvation. Lord, you don't you're not an Indian giver. You don't give and take, Lord. Not in that way. Not when you give eternal life. No sir. Blessed be your wonderful name. Father, we so appreciate your word and all that you're doing in each and every one of our lives. Father, bless your people, Lord. Let us have a prosperous week this week. Lord, whatever lays before us, Father, give us the strength. Go before us, Father. Let your spirit direct and guide every circumstance around our lives, Lord, that we can see you this week in a greater way. Lord, I challenge you, Father, to come on the scene for every every heart that's cried out to you here this morning, Lord, that you would just do something in their hearts and in their lives, Lord. Something simple, something real that will that that they'll come back and say, "Glory to God. He's a reality in my life." Blessed be your name, Father. We give you the glory and all the praise in Jesus name. Amen and amen. Glory, glory, glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I had one song here. Amen. Have you been baptized into the body? Praise God.
