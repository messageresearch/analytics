[0:00] from that perspective now you're
[0:03] seeing that God is revealing to you what
[0:06] he's
[0:08] doing and there's nothing greater than
[0:11] that and you know we could go back and
[0:13] you know you look back when Christ here
[0:15] was on the earth imagine the word was
[0:18] made
[0:19] flesh and he was walking amongst the
[0:22] people and he was fulfilling all the
[0:25] prophecies that were written of him and
[0:28] yet just a handful
[0:30] actually recognized what was actually
[0:35] happening that just blows my mind every
[0:38] time I think of it and that's why you
[0:40] know we want to be able to look at our
[0:45] present state of
[0:47] Christianity and see where we fit
[0:50] in right we want to see where we fit in
[0:54] and how we would have been identified
[0:56] had we been back in that day that's
[0:59] right we have recognize the word would
[1:02] we have been one of those that God had
[1:04] chosen to reveal his word to and to
[1:09] bring the word to
[1:12] life and this is what we're experiencing
[1:15] in this day we are we are living the
[1:17] word of God Amen we are experiencing
[1:20] Jesus Christ in our daily lives and
[1:23] activities and we're seeing him move in
[1:26] Supernatural ways if we are looking for
[1:29] it and we are under expectation but if
[1:32] we're living with the world and like the
[1:34] world and we're seeing the World Through
[1:37] The Eyes of the world that we're getting
[1:40] caught up with all of
[1:42] the the teaching of this world and the
[1:46] way they're looking at the word of God
[1:49] Through The Eyes of this
[1:51] world like they did back when Jesus was
[1:54] on the earth they missed it a million
[1:57] miles so imagine if we're looking
[1:59] through that
[2:01] perspective what are we seeing we're
[2:04] seeing a a world where people go to
[2:07] church on Sundays and we you know we get
[2:10] excited you know oh yes we belong to a
[2:12] church and you know it's all about you
[2:14] know and because I I meet with many
[2:17] Christians and you know and we get to
[2:19] talking and the things they'll start
[2:21] talking about is the things that they're
[2:22] doing and how they're contributing to
[2:25] society and what they belong to and the
[2:28] different ways that they contribute and
[2:31] that's wonderful and I encourage that
[2:33] and I say praise God that's wonderful
[2:35] you know but
[2:37] then what about Christ and what he's
[2:39] doing right
[2:41] now how do you see that oh W how how are
[2:46] you acknowledging that how are you um
[2:48] you know and that brings a totally
[2:51] different perspective and all of a
[2:53] sudden you're either going to
[2:56] meet resistance that's right because you
[2:59] know you start to tell them about well
[3:02] there's like 3,000 different
[3:03] denominations out there how can we
[3:06] possibly know for sure because when
[3:09] Christ came there was a lot of different
[3:12] teachings and a lot of different priests
[3:16] and and churches but yet they didn't
[3:18] recognize when he was actually here it
[3:20] was Christ do you see what I'm saying so
[3:24] we're we're blessed tonight that we're
[3:26] under the teaching of the ministry of
[3:30] this hour in Jesus Christ and what he's
[3:32] presently doing right now am
[3:37] amen so we started last Wednesday we we
[3:40] were talking about born in time
[3:43] destined for eternity and I'm not going
[3:46] to go back over everything that I went
[3:48] through last Wednesday um you know go
[3:52] back and see if you can watch it or
[3:55] listen to it by CD a lot of it there was
[3:58] a lot of inspiration in there and um you
[4:02] know I would even have to go back I
[4:04] believe in the power of
[4:08] Christ operating in the church do
[4:11] you like when I come to church and
[4:13] there's somebody preaching there I got
[4:15] faith that I'm going to pull not the
[4:18] man's ability but I'm going to pull on
[4:22] Christ through that vessel right and
[4:25] that's that's that's also the message of
[4:27] the hour that's also the real teaching
[4:30] of this hour and if you have caught that
[4:33] then you're
[4:34] not looking at the
[4:37] man you're listening for the voice right
[4:41] and and the inspiration because the five
[4:44] full ministry remember is Christ in the
[4:47] church amen operating in those
[4:51] fivefold operations of Pastor teacher
[4:55] evangelist Apostles Prophets
[4:59] amen am praise God so
[5:05] um go back and see what uh was preached
[5:09] last
[5:10] Wednesday and then we'll continue where
[5:13] we're at so um we're going to we're
[5:16] going to read the
[5:17] scripture let's go to the next
[5:20] um
[5:23] Slide the scripture says Ephesians 1: 17
[5:29] to2 three that the god of our Lord Jesus
[5:32] Christ the father of Glory may give you
[5:35] unto you the spirit of wisdom and
[5:38] Revelation in the knowledge of him this
[5:41] is what we're doing this is what we're
[5:44] studying the eyes of your understanding
[5:47] be
[5:48] enlightened that ye may know what is the
[5:52] hope of his
[5:54] calling it's not your calling it's not
[5:57] good neighbor's calling it's his calling
[5:59] right amen and what the riches of the
[6:03] glory of his inheritance in the Saints
[6:06] and what is the exceeding greatness of
[6:09] his power to us word who believe
[6:13] according to the working of his mighty
[6:15] power which he wrought in Christ when he
[6:19] raised him from the dead and set him at
[6:22] his own right hand in the Heavenly
[6:24] places far above all principality and
[6:27] power and might and Dominion
[6:30] and every name that is named not only in
[6:33] this
[6:34] world but also in that which is to come
[6:39] and hath put all things under his feet
[6:42] and gave him to be the head over all
[6:45] things to the church which is his body
[6:50] the fullness of him that filth all in
[6:54] all let us pray father we want to thank
[6:57] you tonight Lord for this opportunity
[7:00] to study your word and to draw from it
[7:03] father all that you would have us to
[7:05] receive tonight open our understanding
[7:08] our hearts and our minds Lord uh let us
[7:12] just let go of the the the weak and and
[7:15] the cares of today and all the burdens
[7:17] that lay Upon Our Hearts and just rest
[7:19] and know that you can answer and provide
[7:23] every one of those needs if we just
[7:25] kneel at your feet and listen a while
[7:29] Grant we pray father in Jesus name amen
[7:32] God bless you
[7:38] s and so last week we're looking at how
[7:41] we actually came into time and how that
[7:46] you know if you have received the new
[7:49] birth and that you have an understanding
[7:52] of what it is to be born again then you
[7:56] have the spirit of Truth in you the
[7:58] spirit of Truth truth will guide you
[8:00] into all truth that's the Holy Ghost the
[8:03] Holy Ghost cannot go against his own
[8:05] word remember that the minute that
[8:08] somebody says anything contrary to the
[8:10] word of God like you say to them well
[8:12] you need to be baptized in the name of
[8:14] the Lord Jesus Christ and they turn
[8:16] around and say it don't matter they have
[8:18] not got the spirit of Truth they have
[8:20] not got the Holy Spirit though they will
[8:23] claim to have the Holy Spirit and I tell
[8:25] you
[8:26] 95% of the Christian teaching out there
[8:29] believes in a trinity believes that God
[8:32] is three in one they they believe in the
[8:36] name of the father and of the son and of
[8:37] the Holy Spirit they'll do the sign of
[8:39] the cross on them and so forth and you
[8:42] know I don't condemn those people and we
[8:45] should never condemn anybody okay but
[8:49] there's teachings and traditions and
[8:51] that's why when Jesus Christ was on the
[8:53] earth and he came and only a handful
[8:56] actually recognized who he was was
[8:58] because they had taken the word of God
[9:00] that they had studied so much and and
[9:03] and and created so many Doctrine and so
[9:06] much understanding on the word of God
[9:08] that their teaching made it of none
[9:10] effect to the
[9:12] people it just became of none effect
[9:14] because they came in with all kinds of
[9:16] you know today you've got like this the
[9:19] the the the the holy sacraments and you
[9:22] know these different uh uh communion and
[9:25] and you know first communion and Stu
[9:27] baptism of babies and so forth It's
[9:30] nowhere in the scripture and the Holy
[9:33] Spirit cannot lie he cannot lie God
[9:38] cannot lie can you imagine how can God
[9:41] possibly lie and and produce confusion
[9:44] and then say he's going to judge the
[9:46] people meanwhile he he allows this one
[9:49] to have this Doctrine and this teaching
[9:51] and then allow this one to have this
[9:53] understanding allow this one to have
[9:55] that understanding and say they're all
[9:57] fine how can it be he could not possibly
[10:00] be a just God oh but they want to say
[10:02] that no but you know all roads lead to
[10:07] Rome
[10:08] wrong God cannot go against his own word
[10:11] and so that's why the scripture here
[10:14] says that that the god of our Lord Jesus
[10:16] Christ the father of Glory may give unto
[10:18] you the spirit of wisdom and
[10:22] Revelation revelation of the word of God
[10:25] Amen in the knowledge of him and he is
[10:29] the word and so um you know let's go to
[10:33] uh uh number 23
[10:38] Faith so what we were looking at now
[10:41] we're going to take a look at um from
[10:44] time to Eternity and from coming from
[10:49] eternity into time and now going back to
[10:51] Eternity and all these time cycles and
[10:54] cycles that that that are going to come
[10:56] in that have come in and that are
[10:58] leading us up to here
[10:59] because through this and through the
[11:01] knowledge of understanding of God's Plan
[11:04] of Redemption understanding the time and
[11:07] the season is important you're going to
[11:09] need to know the season that we're in so
[11:11] that you can actually produce the word
[11:14] of the Season amen by by by Revelation
[11:18] by knowing what to do with the word
[11:20] right brother B said that we would come
[11:22] to a place where we would know what to
[11:24] do with the word and understand the word
[11:26] of God and so when we look at the
[11:28] Timeline we know God was in eternity
[11:30] before the creation and that's where we
[11:33] were before the foundations of this
[11:35] world if you're a son or a daughter of
[11:38] God there's never a time you were not a
[11:40] son or a daughter of God and so if you
[11:43] are born again and have the Revelation
[11:46] in the spirit of Truth is because God
[11:49] has opened your understanding that you
[11:52] were you're not just being taught
[11:54] history you're being brought back into
[11:57] the mind of God all right
[11:59] and so we came from eternity back there
[12:04] before God was even God because God
[12:07] means object of worship and then came
[12:10] the original Creation in Genesis 1:1
[12:13] where the scripture said let there be
[12:16] and God created the heavens and the
[12:19] Earth
[12:21] period genesis1 right now there could
[12:25] have been billions of years from that
[12:30] Point that's why a lot of people talk
[12:32] about oh but the Bible 6,000 years how
[12:34] do you mean how do you explain that you
[12:36] know dinosaurs everything else we've
[12:38] talked about that before the fall
[12:41] actually came could have been billions
[12:44] of years next and so
[12:48] [Music]
[12:49] um there's a prehistoric age of unknown
[12:54] duration that's how we can actually look
[12:56] at it okay that you know there's no age
[13:00] element there was no time element until
[13:02] the fall took place until the fall
[13:05] happened that's when time actually
[13:07] started okay next slide and then there's
[13:10] the 6,000 years that we have now
[13:14] fulfilled we're actually
[13:16] 6,7 years into this cycle okay
[13:21] now you know there's there's calendars
[13:23] and we can't say it's
[13:25] 67 or whatever but we know that it's
[13:29] definitely over 6,000 years and so we
[13:32] are in borrowed time because we know for
[13:35] a fact that that's truth anyway because
[13:37] God sent us a prophet and gave us a
[13:40] revelation and then open the Seven Seals
[13:43] Christ came down to open those seals
[13:46] because that's just before the Rapture
[13:49] takes place so we know that these these
[13:51] seasons have taking place so let's let's
[13:54] go on and so God rested then a thousand
[13:57] years and we know that there's going to
[13:58] be the Millennium right so right you
[14:01] know right after the Rapture we go into
[14:03] the Millennium okay so it's been 6,000
[14:06] years since Adam and Eve that's what you
[14:10] tell people that uh since Adam and Eve
[14:13] fell in the Garden of Eden it's been
[14:16] 6,000 years because Adam and Eve didn't
[14:19] die until after they disobeyed the word
[14:22] of God Amen it's when they disobeyed
[14:25] God's word that's when death entered in
[14:28] because he said the they you eat thereof
[14:31] ye shall surely die and death is time
[14:36] we're doing time right now amen because
[14:38] of the fall of our mama and papa In the
[14:45] Flesh next slide and so Adam and Eve was
[14:50] 6,000 years ago next
[14:52] slide then comes another 2,000 year
[14:56] cycle which is Noah right leading up to
[14:59] the flood which was 4,000 years ago from
[15:05] now 4,000 years ago okay so you
[15:10] understand the graph here then comes
[15:13] another 2,000 years after Noah which
[15:16] comes to Jesus Christ the word made
[15:20] flesh comes to the Earth Christ comes
[15:23] life death and resurrection and that was
[15:25] how many years ago 2,000 years ago right
[15:30] then
[15:30] comes the 2,000 years since Christ and
[15:34] that's from his resurrection 2,000 years
[15:38] ago to now and here we are at
[15:42] 2017 and we know that this age basically
[15:46] ends with the Rapture of the church
[15:50] praise God that's what we are fulfilling
[15:52] see we're right in that blue arrow right
[15:55] now we're actually in the Rapture and
[15:58] it's all already
[16:00] started what do you mean it's already
[16:02] started it's already started it's
[16:05] started for you the day you were born
[16:08] again by the revealed word of this hour
[16:13] am oh yeah that's when the Rapture
[16:16] started and that's the Revelation that
[16:18] you are actually going to manifest that
[16:21] is the word that you are going to
[16:23] fulfill that is the prophecy that you
[16:26] are going to fulfill in the word of God
[16:29] I get excited every time I think about
[16:31] that I because you know we're going to
[16:33] fulfill a portion of the word a lot of
[16:35] people say well what am I do it in the
[16:37] word what am I going to do in the
[16:40] word you need to know you're already
[16:42] doing it the day you receive the Holy
[16:45] Ghost the day you received this message
[16:48] the day you you you had a revelation
[16:50] that God that Christ was actually come
[16:53] down now to actually redeem his jewels
[16:56] redeem his his sons and daughters back
[17:00] in 1963 he decided Now's the Time and
[17:03] I'm coming down and there's a half hour
[17:05] of Silence that we're in right now and
[17:07] because it's Christ left the throne and
[17:10] there's silence in heaven when he's
[17:12] there there's a lot of worship going
[17:15] on oh you don't like worship down here
[17:19] just wait till you get up there you
[17:21] think it's too loud down here just wait
[17:22] till you get up there there's a lot of
[17:24] worship that goes on when Christ is in
[17:27] the midst because that's what we're
[17:29] experiencing now that's why when you
[17:31] come into the house of the Lord you get
[17:32] into that Spirit of worship and you get
[17:34] caught up into the Heavenly places that
[17:36] joy that you're experiencing that
[17:38] feeling of of release and being set free
[17:42] and that that that you know being caught
[17:44] up that's the presence of God Amen now I
[17:48] want you to multiply that by a
[17:54] eternity you can't even Paul says you
[17:56] eyes have not seen ears have not
[18:00] heard you have not
[18:03] experienced what God has in store for
[18:06] you we we get a little do drop every now
[18:09] and
[18:10] then praise God when we get that you
[18:13] know when when the Lord comes down from
[18:15] time to time you know and everybody has
[18:17] their personal moments and experiences
[18:19] with God okay but I can tell you one
[18:21] thing when you do have those those
[18:24] moments okay as you walk and then God
[18:27] comes down and he has a little visit
[18:30] with you let me tell you something if
[18:32] you had that
[18:35] experience you don't want to leave that
[18:37] experience that's right amen You Weep
[18:40] and cry and
[18:42] beg
[18:44] God to not let you have to go back to
[18:48] this Dimension here okay just those few
[18:52] times those times when you have it you
[18:55] the ones that know what I'm talking
[18:56] about you know you
[18:59] you just don't you just beg God don't
[19:02] don't let me have to go back to that
[19:04] again because that experience is is
[19:06] beyond you can't put words on it there's
[19:09] no nobody could people used to ask me
[19:11] because God when when the Lord called me
[19:13] out and gave me those those few times of
[19:16] experience those first few times it was
[19:22] like I've done drugs I've
[19:26] done whatever
[19:31] they had they don't even come close
[19:34] there's nothing on this Earth that can
[19:37] come close to God's love not one single
[19:43] thing on this
[19:45] Earth no where no how no way okay and
[19:50] that is what we can look forward
[19:54] to eyes have not seen ears have not
[19:57] heard what God has in store we're
[19:59] already in the midst of it and that
[20:01] leads us into the next Thousand-Year
[20:02] Millennium next
[20:04] slide right for the Thousand Years that
[20:07] we're going to be back here on this
[20:08] Earth because we go up in the Rapture
[20:10] and then we come back down so let's look
[20:12] at this go to the next slide after that
[20:15] eternity
[20:16] begins but the timeline let's look at
[20:18] those 2,000 year timeline Cycles because
[20:21] we're doing Bible study we want to see
[20:22] what took place we want to see how it
[20:24] types how it you know how it pertains to
[20:27] our day you can always look at
[20:30] everything back in history even looking
[20:33] back at Noah and see the whole type like
[20:36] Noah's uh experience types sort of like
[20:40] the Rapture you know what I mean like
[20:43] that experience of being called out from
[20:46] the world that's going to go into
[20:48] tribulation in in a way like Noah does
[20:51] type you know he types the foolish
[20:53] virgin it's Enoch that really typed the
[20:56] Rapture just before Noah right but you
[20:58] can see the compound revelation of God
[21:02] throughout the whole experience and
[21:04] everything that God was doing back in
[21:06] the history of each of these 2,000 Year
[21:10] events and so we know that Adam and Eve
[21:13] was 6,000 years ago 2,000 years go by
[21:16] and here comes Noah and then Genesis 3
[21:21] like going back now and looking it How
[21:23] It All Leads up we see that there was
[21:26] the fall in Genesis 3 and there was
[21:28] Adam's seed and the serpent seed and we
[21:32] know that you know by now we all know
[21:35] that the original sin was not an apple
[21:37] that was eaten but it was actually an
[21:39] adultery that took place in the Garden
[21:41] of Eden when the serpent went and
[21:44] beguiled Eve that's
[21:46] scripture that serpent who beguiled Eve
[21:49] deceived and got her to you
[21:53] know have sex and and and therefore
[21:58] bring forth through
[22:00] procreation
[22:02] children because we were in the image of
[22:05] God and God all he had to do was speak
[22:07] Adam was in the image of God all Adam
[22:10] had to do was just like what the angel
[22:13] Gabriel did when it went to the Virgin
[22:15] Mary and said blessed art
[22:19] thou Thou shalt bring forth a
[22:23] son you know and told her that she's
[22:26] blessed is her womb and and so forth and
[22:28] and and you're going to have a son
[22:30] you're going to call his name Jesus
[22:32] right there that was the spoken word
[22:33] coming through an angel speaking it
[22:36] right into the womb of Mary and that's
[22:38] why she had a virgin
[22:40] birth well Adam all he had to do was
[22:42] look at Eve and say Eve bring forth
[22:46] Richard it it was it was like the the
[22:50] the the word of God but then comes the
[22:53] procreation through the fall through an
[22:56] adultery now all of a sudden Eve gets
[23:00] excited by this experience and goes and
[23:03] shows Adam and then Adam to save her
[23:06] knowing what was going on does the same
[23:09] thing that's why Christ a type took sin
[23:14] on him come in the flesh to redeem his
[23:18] wife Eve the woman the bride the church
[23:22] the church is always called The Bride
[23:25] right and so within that church are Sons
[23:27] and Daughters of God and so this whole
[23:29] process was being shown the Plan of
[23:32] Redemption was being shown right from
[23:34] the very beginning when Adam went took
[23:38] his
[23:39] wife took on
[23:42] sin
[23:44] and in order to redeem her right just
[23:48] like what Christ did for us and so
[23:51] there's two seeds now because Adam knew
[23:54] his wife and two children are born you
[23:57] got K you got able Cain is of that
[24:01] Wicked one the Bible says it you're of
[24:04] your father the devil he was a liar from
[24:07] the beginning who told the first lie
[24:10] Cain the serpent when he went to Eve and
[24:13] he
[24:14] says you shall surely not he added one
[24:18] word and said You shall surely not die
[24:23] when God said he shall surely die the
[24:25] day you eat
[24:27] thereof and she was deceived and
[24:31] therefore brought
[24:33] forth a seed that came from that serpent
[24:37] who
[24:38] was the devil possessed in a serpent and
[24:43] the nature came upon his son that's why
[24:47] you look at you know you look at
[24:49] families usually the nature of the
[24:51] father will come upon the children the
[24:54] nature of the mother comes upon the
[24:55] children right and so in the same way
[24:58] that nature of the fall through that
[25:02] adultery came down on the human race and
[25:05] that's why the Bible says we born in sin
[25:09] sin is unbelief what was the unbelief
[25:13] when they disobeyed God's word and
[25:15] that's why we're born in sin shaped in
[25:17] iniquity speaking lies right from the
[25:20] day we begin to speak you asked that
[25:23] child where did you put that I don't
[25:26] know
[25:30] are you telling me the truth yeah what's
[25:33] behind your back I don't
[25:36] know you see what I mean it's it's it's
[25:39] just the nature that's on the human race
[25:43] and people want to say that they can be
[25:46] perfect and that they can be righteous
[25:48] and that they can no you can't amen the
[25:50] only thing that's righteous about you is
[25:54] the Holy Ghost in you that's right that
[25:57] attribute of God that was placed in you
[25:59] from before the foundations of the world
[26:01] that's righteous that's the word that
[26:04] cannot disbelieve that's going back to
[26:07] God because it came from God heavens and
[26:10] earth will pass away but his word never
[26:12] will will it pass away and so now we
[26:15] look at these two lineages we've got
[26:17] Adam's seed and we've got serpent
[26:21] seed Adam seed the replacement was Seth
[26:26] because Abel was killed by his evil
[26:30] brother where did that
[26:32] Wicked Spirit of murder come from that
[26:35] can't come from
[26:37] God can't come from
[26:42] God next slide and then we see that
[26:45] there's the lineage you know that comes
[26:48] forth and all of those that were Adam's
[26:52] lineage they were God's were God's seed
[26:57] Adam's
[26:58] seed which was Christ seed the righteous
[27:02] seed the word would flow through and
[27:06] that's why that that God's seed is
[27:08] always met resistance because Cain also
[27:12] had you know his seed but
[27:16] then we can look and we can see types
[27:19] again in Enoch because Enoch was the
[27:22] seventh from Adam a type of the seventh
[27:25] Church age type of SE it's always you're
[27:29] always going to see seven through the
[27:31] scripture because seven is God's number
[27:33] of completion and Enoch was the seven
[27:36] from Adam and here we are we are
[27:38] completing the seventh Church age we've
[27:40] actually moved out of the seventh Church
[27:42] age and we're actually into that Eternal
[27:45] Church age already because the Eternal
[27:48] messenger himself which is Christ has
[27:50] come down and it's already called
[27:53] you and already uh you
[27:56] know Tak you snatched you from the
[28:00] world yeah you're still
[28:02] here but you're not the same person you
[28:06] know what I mean you're still here you
[28:08] go to work like everybody else but you
[28:10] know you're different you know you're
[28:13] not the same you know you're not of this
[28:16] world okay you know that you're actually
[28:19] waiting on a body change that you're
[28:22] just waiting for a translation you've
[28:24] got rapturing faith already in you given
[28:28] to you by the revealed word of this hour
[28:31] every time you come into the house of
[28:33] the Lord if you come with the right
[28:35] expectation to receive something from
[28:37] God you're receiving another little
[28:40] portion of that rapturing Faith that's
[28:43] just you know building upon building
[28:46] precept upon precept line upon line and
[28:50] Adam the seventh from Adam was Enoch and
[28:53] he was a type because he walked with God
[28:55] Enoch walked with God and what did he do
[28:58] please God why did he please God because
[29:02] God gave him a revelation of what he was
[29:05] going to do the whole Plan of Redemption
[29:09] God got you know Lord gets excited
[29:11] sometimes and he starts really revealing
[29:13] and starts unloading and man you know
[29:15] you can get so full of inspiration and
[29:19] before you know it you you could get so
[29:21] caught up like Enoch that you're just
[29:24] you're God you're God you know you're
[29:27] God G in your thoughts you're gone in
[29:29] your Revelation You're Gone In Christ
[29:31] and you know you're you're you you know
[29:34] that you're you're another Enoch because
[29:36] you're just not the same as anybody else
[29:38] here on this Earth You are of
[29:43] another Dominion you're of
[29:46] another place and you know that that's
[29:49] the place that you must go back to
[29:52] there's nothing that can stop it and
[29:54] then comes Methuselah and he's a type of
[29:56] the Millennium you know n lives 969
[30:00] years right and so we go to the next
[30:04] lineage and we look at the serpent seed
[30:06] lineage and Cain's lineage was carried
[30:08] in the Ark by Noah's son and wives the
[30:11] sons and wives because that lineage
[30:15] continued through even though the Earth
[30:17] got flooded and got wiped out the
[30:20] lineages carried on they still carried
[30:23] through
[30:25] and on we go
[30:28] then the flood rained 40 days 40 nights
[30:31] in the ark one year 10 days so now let's
[30:35] look at the next cycle which is the
[30:39] 2,000 years that lead up to Jesus
[30:45] Christ next slide we see that there was
[30:48] a rainbow and God said this is the token
[30:52] of the Covenant which I make between me
[30:55] and you and every living creature that
[30:58] is with you for Perpetual Generations I
[31:01] do set my bow in the cloud and it shall
[31:04] be for a token of a covenant between me
[31:07] and the Earth God was showing that there
[31:09] was going to be fulfillments there was
[31:11] going to be covenants that would be
[31:13] fulfilled and that he would make certain
[31:15] promises and that those promises would
[31:17] be fulfilled and he promised After the
[31:20] flood that he would not flood the Earth
[31:23] again but that he would come and
[31:26] actually redeem us
[31:29] and so in the next 2,000 years we come
[31:34] to the age where God calls
[31:38] Abraham and then below remember the
[31:42] serpent seed carries on Nimrod Babylon
[31:47] right those two seeds got to keep
[31:49] running all the way through all the way
[31:52] to the end next slide then comes Moses
[31:56] King David Daniel
[31:58] and these are all the kings and all all
[32:01] that God was showing through their
[32:06] experiences and through each one of
[32:08] those individuals a type of exactly what
[32:11] he was going to
[32:13] do in our
[32:15] day and that we were going to receive an
[32:18] Abraham's call that we were going to
[32:21] receive a Moses that we were going to
[32:24] receive you know a a an understanding of
[32:27] the kingship of God and the grace of God
[32:31] you know what he what he showed through
[32:32] David's life and how he showed mercy and
[32:35] how he showed the grace and and and the
[32:39] Glorious um experiences that David had
[32:42] and then how he would bring all the
[32:44] prophecies through Daniel you know and
[32:47] all the the wonderful Revelations the 70
[32:50] weeks of Daniel and brother brand of
[32:52] bringing all that Revelation and all
[32:53] that understanding and that's why it's
[32:55] so important for us to continue to
[32:57] listen listen to the tapes and go
[33:00] through the tapes and listen to
[33:02] them praise God it all led up to the
[33:06] life of Jesus Christ and then down below
[33:10] which is the serpent seed we've got all
[33:12] these Empires that were constantly
[33:14] fighting against the
[33:18] word there's always going to be a fight
[33:21] right now our fight is not so much these
[33:25] Empires but we fight against powers
[33:28] principalities and dominions we're in
[33:30] another dimension our fight is another
[33:33] dimension Saints we're not to get caught
[33:35] up into the fight of this world the
[33:38] politics of this world they're just
[33:40] fulfilling prophecy but what are you
[33:43] fulfilling what is your destiny what is
[33:45] your position in the word of
[33:49] God so Daniel brought the understanding
[33:51] of the image the head of
[33:54] gold the
[33:56] silver the belly the brass the legs of
[33:59] iron and clay and we're not going to get
[34:00] into all the details of that what we're
[34:03] trying to bring through these through
[34:05] this study tonight and last Wednesday is
[34:08] just an understanding of
[34:10] Time Eternity time and back to Eternity
[34:14] and how it all fits
[34:16] together and so the third timeline is
[34:20] the 2,000 years of when Christ comes to
[34:23] the Earth to redeem next slide
[34:28] says the Creator himself became the
[34:31] Redeemer Christ had to come and take on
[34:35] human flesh listen here he says but he
[34:38] put man on free moral agency knowing
[34:41] that man would fall remember this is not
[34:44] some you know game like you know like
[34:47] you see on the internet where they have
[34:49] you know game of uh Thrones and all
[34:51] these you know different things that
[34:53] they set up and and uh it's no God
[34:56] placed us here under free moral agency
[34:59] and you're still under free moral agency
[35:02] you can choose to do right and do wrong
[35:06] you can choose to serve God you can
[35:09] choose to come to church on Wednesday
[35:11] night you can choose not to that's
[35:14] entirely up to you you can choose to
[35:16] come on Sunday you can choose not to you
[35:20] see what I mean you're under free moral
[35:21] agency but when you choose right you get
[35:25] blessed am you you can never go wrong
[35:29] when you choose God and what he's
[35:31] provided for you and in that then he
[35:33] became man himself in order to redeem
[35:37] back man that fell that's the reason
[35:40] that Jesus was Emmanuel God With Us if
[35:44] God sent another person besides himself
[35:47] then that wouldn't be just God had to
[35:50] come himself and take place and God
[35:54] could not become down in spirit and take
[35:57] take place he had to be made flesh In
[36:00] the Flesh of his own creative son his
[36:04] own son that he cre he created himself a
[36:07] body so that he could dwell inside that
[36:10] body so that it could go because God
[36:12] can't be a liar if God says if you sin
[36:15] you shall surely die then God had to
[36:18] make a way for us to be to be brought
[36:21] back because he couldn't go against his
[36:23] word see God's going to prove everything
[36:26] by his word by fulfilling his word and
[36:28] by doing what he said he promised he
[36:31] would do amen so he became flesh and so
[36:36] next slide we look at the 2,000 year
[36:39] cycle of Christ and what's within those
[36:42] 2,000 years next slide we get the seven
[36:45] Church ages 1 2 third fourth fifth all
[36:49] the way up to the seventh and we've
[36:51] already come out of the seventh age even
[36:54] though we're in the Leo Dean Church age
[36:56] we are actually
[36:58] by Revelation Way Beyond that we're Way
[37:02] Beyond that Saints you should see that
[37:04] by now that we that brother Bram came he
[37:08] was the messenger so let's go on it says
[37:11] here and when I saw him I fell at his
[37:14] feet as dead and he laid his right hand
[37:16] upon me saying unto me fear not for I am
[37:20] the first and the last this is Christ
[37:22] now speaking to
[37:24] John Revelations 1:7
[37:28] I am he that liveth and was dead and
[37:30] behold I am alive forever more amen and
[37:34] have the keys of hell and of death who
[37:36] was speaking there Jesus Christ it's
[37:41] Jesus Christ it's not you know people
[37:44] say oh there was you know three in you
[37:47] know three in one the Father the Son and
[37:50] the Holy Ghost no it's one God it's
[37:55] always been one God there's no one
[37:57] beside IDE me there's no one after me
[37:59] nor before me it's just God and his name
[38:02] is Jesus Christ in in the in in our
[38:06] human realm of understanding it's Jesus
[38:08] Christ I am he that liveth and was dead
[38:11] and behold I'm alive forever more amen
[38:13] and at the keys of hell and of death
[38:16] write the things which thou H has seen
[38:19] and the things which are and the things
[38:21] which shall be Hereafter The Mystery of
[38:24] the Seven Stars which thou saw in my
[38:26] right hand and the seven golden
[38:28] candlesticks the Seven Stars he's
[38:30] telling them what those seven stars were
[38:33] are the Angels of the seven churches and
[38:36] the Seven candlesticks which thou saw
[38:38] are the seven churches next slide and so
[38:43] we've got the seven Church ages and
[38:45] we've got the seven Messengers and we
[38:47] all know about the seven Church ages you
[38:50] know this is all the history that we
[38:53] received through the message of the hour
[38:56] and through William Mary brandom who was
[38:58] the seventh messenger am okay to each of
[39:02] those Church ages in order to have a
[39:05] revelation of what God is doing
[39:08] today I'm going to emphasize this you
[39:12] need to see this you need to understand
[39:15] the ages that we have come through you
[39:17] need to understand the reformation and
[39:21] what the a lot of people talk about the
[39:23] Reformation I belong to the Reformed
[39:25] Church I said that's great but did you
[39:28] know that the Reformation has progressed
[39:31] and continued on Amen to the Fulfillment
[39:34] where Christ is going to take a church
[39:37] and in a Rapture they're still living in
[39:40] that reform age they're still living
[39:43] under the under the reformers of those
[39:46] particular ages they won't deny you you
[39:49] tell them but if you heard of William
[39:50] Brown who's
[39:53] that but then you turn around and say
[39:55] well what's the name of your church
[39:58] we are Lutheran Church is that right I
[40:02] said who who's Martin Luther well who's
[40:04] Martin
[40:06] Luther they'll stand right behind him Bo
[40:09] let me tell you who's joh West what are
[40:11] you talking
[40:12] about but they don't realize what so God
[40:15] cannot continue
[40:18] on and fulfill all that he said he was
[40:21] going to fulfill in the Book of
[40:23] Revelation what happened to the seven
[40:25] Church age what happened to the
[40:28] continuation and the Reformation that
[40:30] would lead up to Jesus Christ coming to
[40:33] the Earth do you see what I mean and
[40:35] what was God going to do and how do you
[40:37] explain Malachi 4:5 and how do you
[40:39] explain Revelations 10 and and all the
[40:42] scriptures they don't have a clue about
[40:44] that why because they're stuck in a
[40:47] certain age and they're not willing to
[40:50] march on and progress with the word of
[40:54] God and the thing is when God said
[40:57] brother bradam a prophet to this 20th
[41:01] century he took the word and restored
[41:05] all things he was the one Malachi 4 that
[41:07] would restore the faith of the fathers
[41:10] back to the children where we whereby we
[41:13] could actually know which would be the
[41:16] right
[41:18] Church where we would need to go just
[41:21] like when John the Baptist was on the
[41:23] earth God sent John the Baptist so that
[41:26] he could announce the coming of the Lord
[41:30] Jesus and those that were following
[41:34] John were led to Jesus Christ and he was
[41:37] the word and brother bradam was Elijah
[41:41] he was the messenger that would that
[41:44] would introduce the second coming of
[41:46] Jesus Christ people are talking about
[41:48] he's coming again he'll shall he'll come
[41:50] in the Clouds Of Glory and you know and
[41:53] they're and they're under this
[41:54] expectation and meanwhile here you are
[41:57] and he's already come amen amen and you
[42:00] know it and he came in a cloud amen he
[42:03] came in
[42:05] 1963 he had seven angels come down and
[42:09] open up those Seven Seals of the Book of
[42:12] Revelation he did all those things and
[42:15] it's all in the scripture but yet the
[42:18] people you you start to talk about the
[42:20] Book of Revelation oh but you know
[42:22] that's that's too
[42:25] complicated yeah sure it's complicated
[42:27] the whole word of God the Bible says
[42:30] that the letter kth but the spirit gives
[42:33] it life all you need is the holy spirit
[42:38] oh really yeah that's all you need is
[42:40] the Holy Spirit and you the spirit will
[42:43] show you truth amen oh how do I get the
[42:46] Holy Spirit by obeying the word of God
[42:48] that says repent be baptized in the name
[42:52] of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall
[42:54] receive the gift of the Holy ghost amen
[42:58] it's that simple acts
[43:01] 238 that's God's provided way so how are
[43:05] you baptized I have not been baptized as
[43:08] an adult I was I was baptized as a child
[43:11] you need to be re-baptized you have not
[43:15] come according to the word of God and
[43:18] God is not a liar so if you're telling
[43:20] me that you're experiences enough and it
[43:23] ended with a baptism when you were five
[43:27] 7 months
[43:28] old or you got baptized in another
[43:31] church as an adult and you ask them well
[43:34] how are you
[43:36] baptized well I went to the pool
[43:39] and I went into the water I came up okay
[43:43] do you remember how you were about do
[43:45] you remember what he said because the
[43:47] scripture there's 8,000 baptisms in the
[43:51] New Testament in the book of Acts and
[43:52] every one of them was in the name of the
[43:54] Lord Jesus Christ right so how were you
[43:57] about well oh yeah it was in the name of
[44:00] the father and of the son and of the
[44:01] Holy Spirit I said you haven't been
[44:03] baptized what do you mean I went into
[44:05] the waters yeah but you didn't have you
[44:08] see to repent is to turn away from
[44:12] unbelief and if you stay in unbelief by
[44:16] believing that there's a
[44:17] trinity Father Son and Holy Ghost then
[44:20] you really have't taken on the name of
[44:23] Christ which is the bridegroom Christ is
[44:27] the groom that's your husband right yes
[44:31] okay so usually the wife will take the
[44:34] husband's name I'm being a little caral
[44:36] here in the way that it's being uh uh
[44:40] given but yet there's a revelation that
[44:43] a wife will take her husband's
[44:46] name and that's why the Bible says that
[44:50] many are going to come to Jesus Christ
[44:52] on that day and say
[44:53] Lord let me in
[44:57] did I not prophesy in your name did I
[44:59] not cast out devils in your name did I
[45:01] not pray in your
[45:04] name he's going to turn around and say I
[45:06] never knew you I never knew you Adam
[45:10] knew his wife gave seed gave Revelation
[45:14] gave understanding I never knew you
[45:17] depart from me ye that work iniquity
[45:20] what is that knowing truth but rejecting
[45:24] it having the truth come right up to you
[45:26] give given to you shows you that you
[45:28] need to be baptized according to
[45:30] Christian baptisms in the name of the
[45:32] Lord Jesus Christ in water and you turn
[45:36] around and you say don't need it doesn't
[45:39] matter okay so then you then do then you
[45:43] could have been baptized in the name of
[45:45] the lily of the valley then oh no but he
[45:48] just told me it doesn't
[45:50] matter you see either you believe the
[45:53] word of God or you don't either you got
[45:57] the holy ghost or you don't it's just
[46:01] that simple God is not the author of
[46:03] confusion and all of these truths were
[46:06] brought out through the ministry of
[46:09] brother William brandham who was the
[46:10] seventh Church age messenger amen amen
[46:15] next slide and so those seven
[46:17] candlesticks we just heard it it John
[46:21] was told that those seven candlesticks
[46:22] were the churches but they were all lit
[46:25] by the Messengers that God God sent and
[46:28] every one of those Messengers were lit
[46:30] by The Same Spirit you see it's always
[46:33] been Christ in every age it's always
[46:35] been the Holy Ghost in every one of
[46:38] those Reformation age and you know
[46:40] through the Dark Ages it was Christ in
[46:43] the people it was Christ in every one of
[46:45] those angels and Messengers but what
[46:48] happens is they kick Christ out of the
[46:50] church by taking on their own Doctrine
[46:54] and not moving on with the progression
[46:56] of the word of God that leads us to this
[46:59] day and when you leave when you when you
[47:02] reject Christ like they rejected Jesus
[47:06] when he came into the temple and he
[47:08] stood there and he read the word and he
[47:11] spoke the word to them and he said this
[47:13] day this word this prophecy this
[47:16] scripture has been fulfilled before your
[47:18] very eyes they turned to him and said
[47:22] what crucify
[47:24] him blasphemer
[47:27] seeing that he is the word made flesh in
[47:31] this day
