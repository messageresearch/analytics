TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening it's wonderful to be here again with you on this marvelous wednesday evening in this glorious marvelous continuing series of the seven church ages of course tonight our topic is come walk with me in white come walk with me in white and our scripture is found in revelation chapter 3 reading verse 4 thou hast a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy amen to him that overcome it the same shall be clothed in white raiment god bless his wonderful word to our hearts and our lives as we come together here tonight of course i read the scripture once more just for a bit of emphasis thou hast a few names then it uses this word even in sardis god is saying think of it even in sardis even in sodom even in the midst of babylon thou hast a few names in the midst of the chaos the confusion the unfulfillment the unfaithfulness of this age of sardis god is saying with emphasis even in sardis even with all satan's wiles and tricks and traps and trials even with satan's temptations and his terrible uh strategies that he used even in sardis thou hast a few names amen a few names that have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy of course the word names actually refers to people as we can see in the book of acts chapter 1 verse 15 concerning those that were in the upper room the bible says the number of names together were about a hundred and twenty so names refer to people so thou has the few people in that age in that church that will walk with me in white now of course signifying only people that thought goes a little further than that and it brings out the truth that this church system that was forming itself coming up in its sprouting time the springtime of growth the reformation of the entire system and there god is wanting us to see that there are two vines this trail of the serpent this continuing moving of the mystery of iniquity it continues from the garden of eden and it travels down the streams of time until the that day and to this day that we are living in god is saying there are two vines there are two trees there are twin spirits operating within the church body true and false but thanks be to god though he could have separated them though god could have separated cain and abel though of god could have separated jacob and esau though god could have separated jenny's and jamborees away from moses and so on through the bible this mystery of evil riding side by side or walking side by side with the good is in the scriptures from genesis to revelation judas with jesus right on through the book of acts right from among yourselves men right right will rise up who are what ravening wolves right in your midst and god is saying that this was like that in this age of sardis yet in his great purpose he calls them the church he calls both groups lumped together as one he calls them the church now he rebukes the age and on to the church which is in sardis i know thy works that you are dead and your works are unfulfilled not completed and then god goes on and says thou that's the church which is in sardis just has a few people amen hallelujah that are living right walking right and not wrong hallelujah like the majority of the rest of them are doing god is speaking to the age of sardis these few are they that walk in clean garments that are worthy of him oh praise god may god help us to live our lives and walk our christian walk with this same attitude with the same burning desire that we should walk worthy of our calling of the lord as we ask the question is your life worthy of the gospel is your life worthy of the truth that we speak that we teach that we witness is does our life match up with our testimony that we give may the great holy spirit help us that we walk with our lives worthy of the gospel now these people that were the true saints the elected of god in that time were walking in such a way that their lives were all pleasing to god and that is why god points them out singles them out lets them know that he has his eyes upon them thou hast a few names hallelujah and my eyes are upon them i've seen them and they are pleasing to me said the lord their garments were clean because they are walking in the light of the revealed word of the living god hallelujah now for us to understand what is being said here they will walk the world with me in white now in those days as you know the people wore uh long eastern garments and many times those garments will sweep along the ground now remember back then they had no pitched roads beautiful highways lovely lanes they had no street sweepers machine to pass by and to clean the streets and have them beautifully clean by morning they did not have that instead what they had were roads in which there were ruts in which camels walked in which donkeys walked dogs other animals and as they walked their refuse would also be in the streets so one had to walk carefully watching how they walked where they walk and what they were doing one had to pay attention so god is saying here in the word they shall walk with me in white because what they have not defiled their garments their garments are not spotted their garments are without blemish and so therefore he says they shall walk with me remember as i just referred one has to be very careful of how you're walking back then lest you were to step into something undesirable in our modern times you may step into a uh an undesirable situation condition or position so one had had to be careful then where they walked some streets were worse than others and one had to choose their path where they were walking as much as we have to choose our path of life what will my life be what will my future hold in what direction am i headed one has to be careful watchful and aware of how they're walking and where they're walking and also one has to be careful of whom you are walking with you must be careful that you're not with someone that will distract you that will delay you one that will uh have you walking into a mess with them so he is saying they shall walk with me because they are careful they're watchful they're aware they know what is happening and even in the midst of the the chaos the unfulfillment the systematic evil that pervades sardis god is saying there are a few even insiders that will walk and is walking the world with me in white and that same one invites you tonight come walk with me in this world in white that he might lead you and guide you that he might surround you and keep you in holiness and his righteousness that you may walk through the world without blemish and without blame oh praise be to god hallelujah amen those wands my friends did not walk in a place where their garments will pick up defilement where their garments will pick up dust and dirt dirt and the things that would be scattered within the street amen because they were watching how they walked where they walk and with whom they were walked so god is saying they they're not corrupted by the world they have tru they have tried to keep out of the systems the temptations the evil the corruption and the chaos that which is within the world its system and its civilization and therefore they will walk the world with me in white and you are invited to walk with him i am invited to walk this world with him in white of course white he is speaking of walking with him in righteousness walking with him in holiness let us go on as we look into the word hallelujah amen friends you will say well how could they do this in such a wicked and evil age how could daniel do that how could he live godly in babylon how is it possible that he could do that how could they walk the world walk through the age of sardis and come out on the other side in white with their garments clean unspotted praise god how could those three boys down in babylon with daniel how could they go into the fires of babylon even walk through the fire that was set for them and come out of the fiery furnace and the bible records that there was not even the smell of smoke upon their garments may god help us in our walk in our way of living that the reality of this gospel will strike our soul and it will not just be a something of tradition are just trying to be religious but being his life in us keeps us and my friends moves us to the point where we want to walk through this entire world in white in cleanliness amen unspotted from the world and the things of the world i ask the question how could they do it they do it and you and i can must and will do it by walking with and in the spirit of almighty god walking with the holy spirit walking in the holy spirit being guided by the holy spirit oh every step we take my friends ought to be by the leadership of the holy spirit of whom the bible tells us the sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god so must we today be led by god's holy spirit through this earth and the world that we are living in hallelujah they were holy they were blameless walking before him praise god and by doing that they were fulfilling their life's purpose ephesians 1 4 says that that is the purpose of god for us that we should be holy and without blame before him o praise god amen now the scripture tells us friends that the elect of god that was within the body or framework of the sardis church was just a few people just a few names in the massive majority of that day there were only a few names jesus referring to his time and referring to our day in which we're living in where there are millions upon millions claiming to be true sons and daughters of god claiming to be real christians and yet he says fear not little flock little flock it is my father's what pleasure to give you the kingdom jesus is saying again as we come to the end of time the end of the church ages few there be that will walk the world with him in white not that there will be few in the church there'll be many in the church there'll be many religious many christians yes but there are just a few names that will walk the world come walk with me through this world of white is the cry of the holy spirit come walk with me in the midst of the madness mayhem chaos that we are living in come walk with me believe the word of god and allow the word to influence your life change your actions and attitudes and i will lead you and guide you so that you may walk through this world in white hallelujah now as we can see the teaching of this age was very chaotic it was not enough so that the age was unfulfilled it did not come up to its full expectations it was split into scores of ways and god rebuked the entire thing rebuked them in its entirety for the age was weak it was also sickly and not only was it weak and sickly what it was sick and nigh unto death oh think of it a man laying in a sick bed nigh unto death and usually he's gasping for fresh air he's gasping for some air that he might live and so god is using this reference that we might recognize the seriousness and the danger of this age of sardis an age gasping for breath an age br gasping for the breath of the holy spirit gasping for a fresh move of god a revival of the holy spirit that will re-energize and quicken the age back to the word back to christ back to the original apostolic faith as found within the bible now this was not a glorious age as many uh protestant historians have tried to make it out to be my friends spiritually as i said this age was upon its deathbed and it was crying out for god to sin and outpouring of the holy spirit to be able to lift it to higher ground if we're to take a look at the age of sardis and envision it as a great tree then we will see it as a tree that was sorely conquered a tree that was blighted by various worms and bugs eating at its roots branches and foundations yes a tree denuded even of the of its leaves which represents praise worship adoration honor respects and glory to god the tree of sardis was denuded of its leaves yes sir and barren a fruit they could not bear sweet precious fruit for the glory of god in the environment in which they were living it was a strain it was a struggle it was a continuous intense pressure upon them and they just could not produce the fruit for his coming glory that he so desires in them and even if they did show as if they had some fruit usually the fruit was deformed and wormy eaten by worms doctrines of men teachings of man insertions of men within the framework of the word of god and the church of the living god oh and not only that the fruit from off that tree of sardis was dropping fast it was just dropping off of the tree and falling to the ground but look a little closer look to that tree of sardis god said but thou hast a few names amen hallelujah that are worthy and will walk the world with me if you look to the top of the tree as we may look to the top of the pyramid in our age and time there you may see a few fruits hidden beneath the leaves but exposed to the sun at the highest point being ripened with the sweetness and the savor that comes from the heat of the sun and so will you and i be ripened through the revelation of the sunlight of the holy spirit coming forth from the word of god amen though the tree be blighted deformed wormy and everything else at the top of the tree in the pyramid exposed to the s o n of god is the shining light of god shines upon the true fruit of god and brings it to its luscious sweetness amen so that when jesus comes again and he reaches out his hands to his to the tree oh shall he find fruit yes he will for there will be some that are made sweet by the heat and clarity of the revelation of the word of god to meet him when he comes again o blessed be the name of our beloved lord hallelujah thank god for these wonderful fruits that are at the top of the tree and are exposed to the light of the sun hallelujah what they are the first fruits amen there you may even say they are the last fruits but the last shall be the first and the first shall be the last amen i remember as a boy many times there would be a fruit tree and all the fruits from the lower branches were would all be picked and gone but as boys you would look carefully with searching eyes and there in the top of the tree right towards the end of a branch hidden by some leaves there you will find some of the sweetest fruits which were the ones at the top of the tree and that were exposed to the sun thou hast a few names even in sardis hallelujah even in the evil and the wickedness of sodom a babylon and of sardis out of that you still have a few names i'm thinking of the angel that cried who are these that come forth from from edom with their garments dripping with blood and there we hear the boy these are they who washed their robes white in the blood and made them white in the blood of the lamb may god help every one of us to wash our walk or talk or look or or move or are the way of worship wash them in the blood of the lamb wash them by the opening of the word of god to our understanding hallelujah they're perfect in him walking with him because we were born in him born in him and we are filled with him and thus we are perfect in him not of ourselves hallelujah walking with him are you going to walk with him walk with him is to walk with the word hallelujah so here we are let us walk with god's word walk step by step as an old song i just recall that keeping step with the master wherever he may go hallelujah let us keep step with jesus let us keep step with the word let us keep step with him oh my and may he be glorified within our lives thank god for his faithful few wherever they may be thank god for those few in our age that will walk with him in this present world of accumulated evil multiplied evil from sadness to this time and still they will walk this world with me the word in white hallelujah praise god listen they shall walk with me hallelujah god will bestow upon you or upon anyone that will walk with him hallelujah he will he will uh give them their inheritance of a robe of righteousness because it's their inheritance and it was reserved for them hallelujah your wedding robe provided by the bridegroom was reserved for you so you will walk this world walk through it as the old song says through many dangers toils and snares i have already come has brought me safe thus far and grace will lead me home my friends god is saying that if you will walk with him through all your toils through all your troubles through all your trespasses through all your temptations and your tests amen he will honor you he will remember you and all your contributions he will reward you hallelujah for our god it's not forgetful of any little thing we do for him for any of these little ones sake the imprisoned the troubled the tried the lonely the heartbroken the sick o my friends i tell you god will reward you and will honor you it does not matter if man honors you or man regards you you may be counted as not as the bible tells us they will eat up my people like man eating bread but nevertheless the world may think you foolish the world may sideline you them world may place you in a little corner but remember the eyes of the lord are upon thee and god is watching over his own hallelujah amen god is not forgetful of our labor of love and will always recompense those who live lives and who sacrifice to walk the world worthy and white with him praise god hallelujah amen listen they these few enzardis had walked through this treacherous world full of traps and they had not partaken of it or was trapped by it they had not let that prevailing world system overcome them so should we not let the world system of this day overcome us in any way amen hallelujah when the simple the humble and the reverent to god were walking quietly with him many illustrious ones of that day and of this day my friends have yielded to all the temptations and blemishes of the state many great preachers great men yielded to political mindedness rather than being spiritual minded and heavenly minded as paul said and they are on their way back to the world and in the world even though they're just covered with religious garb and having religious certification they're actually on the way back to their vomit they're on their way back to wallow in the mire they're on their way back to their old jezebel mother they're on the way back to the house of harlotry they're walking away from the word of god in this day agent time in which we are living in yes my brother hallelujah but god is saying that there are a few who stand by the word of god and honor god in the midst of all that was happening and because they did it god said i will honor them amen and they shall walk with me in righteousness in holiness amen hallelujah god had identified them amen because they had identified and were not ashamed to identify themselves with him while they are here upon the earth they were not ashamed of him on earth and so he will not be ashamed of them in the new jerusalem praise god how marvelous will it be when the lord identifies you by calling you out come thou good and faithful servants enter into the joy of your lord oh praise god forevermore hallelujah amen amen amen amen praise god hallelujah yes sir wow think of it that will walk the world with me in white this refers to he is saying i will not be wearing a different clothing from their wearing we will all be wearing the same thing for he is not like an earthly ruler or earthly rulers who will wear certain different colors to identify who they are and their greatness or their height of popularity but now he wears white and he says they will also wear what i am wearing they will wear white no wonder the bible says we shall see him as he is and we shall know him praise be to god because we will be like him praise god hallelujah they shall walk the world with me in white for they are worthy do you realize who is saying this oh praise god this is jesus that is saying this that they will walk with me he is saying they are worthy this is the same one in the book of revelation when the cry went throughout the heavens and the earth who is worthy to take the book and to open from the hand of him that sitteth upon the throne and open the seals thereof and the bible tells us that there was none found worthy in the earth in the heavens under the earth nowhere none was found worthy but then there came a bloody lamb thank god for that bloody thou dying lamb thy precious blood shall never lose its power till all the ransom church of god are saved to sin no more thank god jesus that bloody lamb that shed his precious life's blood to redeem us and bring us back to god he alone was worthy and he being the worthy one to break those seals the one who is the perfect judge to be able to say what he is saying he looks at those few he looks at the few for our day and our age and he is saying to your heart thou art worthy to walk the world with me in white you are worthy the only one that can account you worthy praise god hallelujah and he is saying to to us saints to the saints back then to the saints today fear not you are worthy the accuser of the brethren no doubt might have whispered and maybe is whispering in your ears hallelujah since the covet time look at your actions look at your walk look at your talk look at your associations look at how you are doing and making all manner of accusations and evil whispering in your ears telling you that you are unworthy but let me tell you in the midst of all that is happening the worthy one jesus christ is saying thou art worthy to walk this world with me in white and to be able to walk and to avoid defilement uncleanness and the earthliness that is within this world hallelujah thou art worthy he is saying amen that romans 8 3 says god says you we are the righteousness of christ in him you are righteous you're worthy you're justified you're washed in the blood you've been cleansed amen the sweet voice of our lord is saying the word mine you belong to me praise god you're righteous come walk with me in white praise god hallelujah yes sir what an invitation to walk with him amen to be invited to walk with the president is a great honor to be invited to walk with the queen of england a great honor and now we have the greatest of all honors jesus saying come walk this world with me in white live holy be holy be be walking in divine perfection amen because i in you you and me praise god hallelujah amen oh praise god hallelujah brother sister we find the light of god's righteousness shining upon us and our lies made clean by the blood of the lamb in revelation chapter 3 verse 5 he says he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment hallelujah amen he that overcome it overcome it what overcometh the world overcome at the world systems overcome it the beast system overcome with this babylonian denominational chaotic system that is out there of my friends hallelujah he's that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white garments hallelujah it's the same promise walking with him and overcoming with him the same reward to walk with him and be clothed in white this few that have not defiled their garments hallelujah and have kept to the word as we say in our times keep your skirts clean keep your walk clean don't get involved in questionable things and others or get allow others to influence and involve you in things that don't concern you amen but stay clear of all of it and allow him to deal with your life hallelujah god will reward all those who follow this this wonderful advice yes my brothers my sisters hallelujah he is we are going to be clothed in white even as he is clothed in white even us he is the righteousness we are clothed with his righteousness amen praise god when peter james and john went up with the lord on the mount transfiguration the bible says his raiment his garments began to shine with a brilliancy a light that was so bright a blinding white light was shining out from him hallelujah and he is saying you will walk this world with me in white with this kind of light of god shining from you in the righteousness in which you are walking you will be clothed in light you'll be clothed in white you will be clothed with his presence going every step of the way with you praise god hallelujah friends you know we are living in the end times right now we're living in this age when all the various denominational churches and groups are all coming together and they're coming to the place where they're now beginning to control world politics and very soon they will come to the place where they're rich enough to control world finances world economics they'll be able to control all of that amen and then if you don't belong to their organizations if you're not registered with their organizations if you are not accounted as one of them that approves of their organizations the bible tells us you will not be able to buy nor to be able to sell you won't be able to make a living or do any business and you're going to lose everything hallelujah but if you stayed true and all to god's unchanging hand keep your garments white amen hallelujah my friends listen this here is a prophecy from the prophet of this 20th century and i want to say this exactly oh those that will keep their garments clean from the defilement of this world system of church orders will be physically bereft there will be presented to them a great temptation it will be given to them and preachers will give in with the excuse that they will serve god within the framework of that antichrist beast system they will give in to its flatteries and blendishments of the hierarchy they'll give him the financial temptations yes sir oh and the people will follow follow them right into the slaughter that right there that's right ahead for they follow those false shepherds that are contrary to the word and follow them right to the slaughter no my friends you can't walk in this spotted garments of this world with him you can't dance with the devil and say you're walking with the lord oh choose this day whom you're going to serve choose lady choose church who are you going to walk with are you going to walk with the word are you going to walk with the devil or dance with the devil on his own dance floor amen time to wake up and hear the voice of god crying out come out of her come out of organization come out of denomination come out of the entanglement of this religious world that we are living in that you receive not her plagues and don't be a partaker of her sins amen hallelujah if you will follow the word of god you will shun the religions you will shun the religions of this world like you are shunning the coveted 19th virus as if you're shunning a plague flee from the religions of this world leave off walking with the world amen like you my friends and make your garments white by repentance make your life transformed by repenting of your sins confessing not to a priest but to god himself to the lord jesus christ himself and washing cleansing your life your mind in the precious blood of the lamb but there is still wonder working power in the blood that washes white as snow do it now right now while i'm yet speaking tomorrow may be too late come to jesus now talk to him now ask his forgiveness now and is cleansing now and may god help every one of us wash us in washes in his precious blood of forgiveness and redemption and bring us back into his loving arms that we might love him serve him and walk with him as i close this topic today i'm thinking of the words of a song that i love which goes this way come walk with me the way is straight and narrow come walk with me you cannot walk alone [Music] for the way is rough and there are many dangers come walk with me and i will see you home oh come walk with him today and let him receive you into his loving arms and into his glorious kingdom in the name of our lord jesus christ god bless you my friends until next week keep your heart keep your mind and keep your eyes looking away to jesus for he is coming soon god bless you amen [Music] you
