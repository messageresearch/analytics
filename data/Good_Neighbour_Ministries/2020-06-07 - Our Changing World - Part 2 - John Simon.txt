TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] they're friends I'm happy to be here on another Sunday morning giving glory praise and honor to God may God richly bless you and may he anoint the words of the Bible and of this sermon right to your heart reading from Danielle 2 verses 19 to 22 in there is found this verse where Daniel said to King Nebuchadnezzar he Jehovah change at the times and in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 1 it reads to everything there is a season and a time for every purpose under heaven praise God let us pray father we ask your divine blessing upon this online broadcast made a great Holy Spirit come and anoint the word of God to our hearts to every Herer every one that passeth by Oh Lord may the Holy Spirit come up on the scene father and let thy word live again in the name of Jesus Christ we ask her divine blessing amen granted father that you'll bring that lawsuit last one in that lost one in wherever they are whoever he isshe is they are made on this spirit Lord reach out and take a hold of some life some heart someone to recognize their day and their message and they are in which we're living to see be all the glory and the praise in Jesus name Amen it's good to be here today friends and to our subject last week we spoke on part one of our changing world and there I stressed that right before our very eyes our times are changing we documented or we traced or followed this change from the time of Adam and Eve when they lived in the dispensation of innocence living innocently in the garden but then with the coming of the serpent with his seductive powers on the scene it changed from innocence to men with his conscience then Noah followed up and the dispensation changed from conscience to human government not to detail every change but we'll go to the change in the times of Jesus when Jesus arrives on the scene to bring about a change from law with its legalisms condemnations and judgments took grace the day of grace so Jesus was the one they're changing law to grace now certainly friends we can also see Luther coming on the scene and it change from the all paganistic traditional religion of Rome right to the faith of our fathers the return of the true faith in just a little bud just a little glimmer of light came forth in the time of Luther and it traveled down pastor Wesley came to the times of the great Pentecostal revival when the great Holy Spirit of Almighty God was poured out upon every nation on earth under the Sun as it was in acts 2 there we find brethren at the same time there came upon the scene a great messenger of that in the time and day of that Pentecostal revival never had a light shine so bright from the pains of Jesus Christ himself never had a light shined upon us and so this messenger William Marion brendham changed the focus from denominational worship and idolatry to the fullness of the Word of God for the hour now we know that prophets are always signposts reading from various parts of the Bible when it's Ezekiel random we know that prophets coming on the scene it's a sign to the age now I believe this present age is in danger of missing their samples and if we miss our signpost friends we will find ourselves in great danger for God does not send a man or men into judgment without first giving them a warning God always gives warning before judgment and he is giving Fortis warnings even now you are being warned even though that it is God Himself that is changing the times for certain prophecies have to be fulfilled there are certain things that must take place so that his word may be fulfilled in our day and in our times so he changed the times I mentioned at the end of my last street livestream that we are now standing at the times of the ending of the Gentile dispensation and it seems that in the mind's eye we can see the plan writing written on the wall the signs around us in earth and sky in ear in every aspect whether its government will its politics whether it's in the courts in the schools in the streets wherever the signs of the times are everywhere and there's a brand new feeling coming it's in the air can't you feel it friends there's a feeling that something is fixing to happen something is about to take place there's a assessment shift going on right while we are knows we are now here seeking and talking about these things now many years ago there was an earthquake in India and it's most reported that many before the actual earthquake animals were were moving away from walls going on the trees or going into the open field and dogs were howling and people wondered why what was going on but you see what they sense the oncoming danger before the human beings did and even God and His Word says the stark the animals they know the judgments and the coming of the Lord but my people knows not the judgments of the Lord and this we are seen happening in our day and in our times yes friends he changed the tanks and to everything there is a season and there is a time and when that season is up and a new time or age is about to begin then my friends we must be able to recognize it and be prepared to see those changes I believe we are now at the changing of another time as I've said it's a time for something to take place Jesus spoke in the words Matthew 24 when you see signs in the heavens signs in the earth Paris turns upon us with Wars rumors of wars earthquakes everywhere the sea is roaring my friends pestilences he spoke about coming upon the face of the earth when you see those viruses those epidemics those pestilences coming upon the face of the earth know that my coming is naughty so I announce to you the coming of the Lord is at hand are you prepared prepare to meet thy God if you have not left close as you possibly can draw nigh to him call upon his name ask for his forgiveness ask him to come into your life and if you claim and believe that he's in your life tell him Lord I want to walk closer and closer as I possibly can for your glory and for your honor yes sir Jesus spoke about this day he says when you see this these things it is the beginning of Sorrows the beginning of Sorrows saying in other words we are now living in a pre tribulation period we are living in this period my friends when the tribulation is starting to usher its way in gradually by increasing birth pains and problems and travail and trials coming in and while that is happening the rapture is fixing to take the bride out of here for God is not going to leave his people his children him here upon the earth when all of the major judgments and the major tribulation begins we will be taken out of here by what we believers know as the rapture of the Saints of the Living God oh I live for that day and for that hour but even if I am NOT alive or you were not alight for that hour he promised he will raise the dead first and then that remain and are alight he'll be caught up into the presence of the Lord absent from the body with the Lord oh what a great day what a great captain in time we will have what a great brush our time in the presence of the Living God when we shall meet and greet each other and the saints that have gone before in the house of the Lord however Jesus said at the beginning of Sorrows the beginning of sorrow our tribulation that is to come also known as the time of Jacob's trouble yes my friends we live in this time when it's time now for God's time clock is striking the hour you say what do you mean God's time clock God's timepiece Israel the nation of Israel it's God's timepiece if you want to know the time of the day you want to know the hour if you're asking me sir do you know what time it is I will answer you by saying look at the nation of Israel for something is fixing to happen with her and for her we my friends can look ahead and see that Israel is suddenly going to be voted into a position of power and influence great influence if you think that she has influence and power on the earth now watch my friends what's fixing to happen for Israel is now fixing to enter into her global power the presence of the anointing of God is leaving the Chettle church as the Gentile church rots and goes into her time of corruption and travail my friends the Spirit of the Living God it's writing the words across every door in Chabad written across every denomination the glory of the Lord is the pardon the glory of the Lord is slowly slipping away and that's the Sun rose in the east and sets in the west my friends and then when it sets in the west the next morning it goes back east even saw the Sun s um som rose in the eastern world Jesus Christ came in East and my friends now time for sunset is the sunset hour on upon the western world everything is going dark everywhere the church age going dark the spirit of Leticia upon the church world cry out against the church oh my god take them out that blow the trumpet in Zion tell them people my people their iniquity and the house of Israel of our sins yes my friends and so the light of God which has shined and is still shining in a glimmer upon the Gentile world especially here in the West that spirit of Almighty God the anointing the light of God the great perfect realization that comes by the revelation of the Holy Spirit it's going right back east again and it's going to rest upon the Jewish people and anoint them and use them for his glory and honor no matter what your thoughts are about that's the word of the Living God written in the spider that must come to pass for heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall never pass away market in Israel is coming into power further and far and by the fulfillment of prophecy amen yes sir oh praise God hallelujah I'm saying my friends it's not that I naturally know anything but in my soul my spirit I know my friends from the Word of God than the revelation of the Holy Spirit that Israel my friends is first going to experience a time of great trouble and trouble upon earth it is the time of Jacob's trouble then what will it be time of Jacob's trouble Israel will be deceiving others just like Jacob deceived others trick others Israel my friends would be in such a place where she will also be betrayed by a lot of other nations in whom she put her trust in whom she trusted their loyalty and their friendship she's going to face a time of betrayal also on trickery and deception he will use trickery and deception but she will also be betrayed and tricked that time is right at the door right upon us yes sir so we see in order for her to come to a place for Israel like Jacob to really be able to grab ahold and hold on to her rightful birth right inheritance she will use every trickery every deception and every betrayal in the book for that's Harbert right and she'll take a hold of it and she what let it go but while she's doing that she will also be tricked and be betrayed for we know this world adding into that we are now the pre tribulation period and they're going into the tribulation period so subtly that you you know you will hardly realize or recognize what's really taking place and one day you'll wake up and say oh I thought we were to be warned you are being warned by the signs of the times by the servants of the lid God wherever they are that we are in this season and time is slipping away and time will soon blend and change into eternity it will all be over then but before that certain things in the Word of God must take place friends Israel must as I say come to her place of power she must come to her time of the Feast of the Trebek's she must also regardless of whatever obstacles are in her way she must rebuild Solomon's Temple right where it is for when she does that there must be the sacrifices reinstated so the red heifer will suddenly appear on the scene oh praise be to Jehovah praise be to the Lord God Almighty may his name be praised and blessed forevermore glory to God that powers upon us I feel it in my spirit my soul write down my friends that the Word of God is now moving the supernatural the universe is moving things are shifting and taking place and God is about receive his glory yes sir here we are my friends I tell you but after his rally has been tested after the testing will come the blessing after jacobs testing then came the blessing so will it be with Jacobs children and his generations that have held to God's unchanging hand of the Word of God friends sometimes we don't understand that nation may stumble it may even do wrong things at times it may do things maybe contrary to what's even written in the word but regardless of that you must look beyond and see they are the children of the people of God God will judge where and who he has the judge and who yes the best he will bless who has to repent they'll have to repent as a nation but never mind all of that the holy God of heaven is in control for he changed the times he changed the seasons and when they moral and spiritual supernatural arc of the universe is moving none should get in its way and try to hinder it or stop it for as the scripture said you got Mills of God grain slow my friends but if you get in its way it'll grind you to powder whether you be a person whether you be a power of government no matter who and what we are the mills of God will grant you the powder make way for the king make way for the fulfillment of the word make way for the word of God to come to pass my friends for it will surely come to pass whether we are willing not it will come to pass for God has spoken and his word cannot change yes my friends we see clearly that God's fig tree has already begun to blossom in preparation for when he comes again he'll be able to go to that tree Israel being the grobotz fig tree and find sweet fruit for his coming glory that he might eat something that's a sweet in his in his mouth and the sweet mass trails of perfume in his nostrils as he receives the great sacrifices in his wonderful presence oh praise God the Messiah's glory about to be made manifest oh god the manifest God to his people declaring himself by the unveiling of his word in this hour but then they shall see him face to face oh my god they'll see him face to face we speak spiritually but they will literally see him for all every eyes shall behold him and they have recognized him as their Messiah Oh glory to God SARS Ebola and now Karuna my friends when near this these plagues begin to fall and when we see the plague Korona crowning our lands crowning the people evil coming to its crowning time my friends I believe it's at the same time of darkness as it was in Egypt I believe it's the same time when my friends the angel of God comes at that particular time you say well why is the angel of God the God going to come when is darkness and and you've preached a few weeks ago how the entire light and truth of the word of God is going to a spiritual supernatural black oh just as it was in Egypt when it was darkness then the angel of God was set forth for those who had the blood upon their doorposts and so it was then so is it now that the angel of God is now going forward in a sealing time there is a ceiling anointing when the great Holy Spirit the great angels are here to seal the true believers in their foreign seal them in their foreign Florida God yes sir he's sealing his own he's sealing their minds he's protecting their minds against the arrows of the devil the suggestions the evil thoughts from the devil the temptations the seductions the charm the witchery that the devil is sending forth took to me guile the people of God these enticing and seducing spirits that have invaded our planet invaded the Church of the Living God in this hour until the mouths of many men of God have been corrupt and they then they can't even give a warning anymore they hardly use the word hell they'll hardly speak about sin repentance back to the word they'll hardly tell you repent your people get on your knees talk to God crane with sincerity not some dry eye mascara painted wipe of your face but a genuine repentance of comes from the Living God when your heart reaches up to and he reaches out to you and you realize from that hour you are a changed person changed not by the words of a man by your change by the hand about money God thank God II stretch down his hand for you and it stretching down his hand today to pick you up from wherever you are raise you up and put you up on solid ground to walk in the power and might of his great holy spirit yes sir he's sealing his own in this outlaw sealing our brains and our hearts against the works of the devil yes sir right now that greatest battle ever fought is going on my friends the longest running war which started in heaven but Michael and the Angels it's still running here today the battle between God's revelation wisdom versus my the wisdom of Satan versus the Revelation faith wisdom of God given to his anointed servants in this day and in this hour and a battle is now raging my friends and see here it is my friends that this great Word of God is being fulfilled so God's power against demon power God's power against satanic power God's power against dénouement demon nation's power God's Spirit anointed Word of the Living God to rebuke and bind and shackle every Prince of Darkness every one of them I tell you scepter and Crown must tumble down and in the dust be equal made and the glory of the Lord must be revealed for all to see it and don't know that yes God our God is not dead he is not a mockery or an object of laughter he's not an idol on the wall he is not a bell Justin ringing in the temple he's the Living God he lives and he lives in true believers that restiveness promises holds about God's unchanging hand the world around you is changing but you hold to God's unchanging hand curve it madness world's finger itches all my friends for all of that will be burnt and decayed oh praise God I'm saying if God bless you and you have it use it for his glory use it for yourself of course and use it for his glory but don't put your trust upon that trust in the Lord my friends don't trust it not many cars you have don't trust in how many soldiers you have don't trust my friends in how many chariots you have don't trust in how many how much money you have my friends but trust in the Lord and the Lord Jesus with Christ we'll see you truth amen God's Satan's plagues are here to infect you to steal your help to steal your joy his spirit of seduction of churchianity his spirit my friends a spiritual death and disease and oppression is here to destroy you but Jesus has said the thief cometh not but for to kill and to destroy but I am come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly so Satan comes with his plates but God's power is here to anoint you and to immunize you and to seal you by his presence and his power and his person within your life and to make you a person that is the house of God for this hour a habitation for the holy spirit called out cleanse set up separated set apart and filled with His divine presence garden you greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world you have the power to face any challenge of any hour any day or any time and to overcome for we are more than conquerors through him that lives in us praise God hallelujah amen yes sir here we are then as believers walking through this world filled with filth and sin filled with all manner of evil but the Bible says will come out walking like Daniel without any smoke upon our clothing will come out of this sinful period with a robe of a bribe of spotless weight not a not one speck was since Cain will be dare there any more for reason they're washed by the blood of the Lamb even now we are under the protection of the blood of the Lamb upon our hearts glory to God this great Holy Spirit blood of God the sealing spirit and sealing time of the Living God doesn't hear upon us o friends God he not things that are hears he knows those that are here and he is able to call out to anoint and to seal those that are his for his glory praise God hallelujah all my friends my father was a builder of ships and when those ships were sealed I friends I tell you then and there launched that the water could be all around that ship but the water will not be able to get in the ship because that ship is sealed praise God from the outside to the inside or from the inside to the outside the ship is sealed and then my friends a true believer it can be said of them they're in this they're floating through this sea of sin and they're in the sea of sin but the ship sin is not in the ship Thanks being a God we are floating down the stream of time we have not long to stay Oh friends we're out of here by the power of the Holy Spirit or the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you he shall also quicken your mortal bodies by the Spirit of the Living God that dwells in you here we are under the protection of the blood the same posts everywhere are pointing to a coming of the Lord and evil has seconds and the mocking of our God and of his people is now taking place but there's a changing time as I've said that change will be Israel coming into her power in this hour amen watch it now it's about to happen and you must be ready for it amen and it's coming whether whether you are ready or not it's coming and it's going to happen there's another changing time that's here upon us a new world order it's now beginning to emerge [Music] amidst disappearance of covet 19 revelation 19 this environment of pandemic is a saying for spiritual people of the Living God to recognize what is taking place for it is the changing of the world system the entire changing of this systems of the world is now taking place morally spiritually the entire cosmic environment of the entire world is now undergoing renovation restoration use any word who want transformation simply it's going through change and when God begins to change the time the season and age he says I am God who can withstand who can't stop words ten his power who can withstand the changes that he is making and he makes glory to his marvelous and wonderful names so this great moral and spiritual supernatural are of the universe kids who feel it friends get to recognize it it has moved the pillar of fire that led the Church of Israel has picked up itself and it's starting to move as I said the force moving from the agendas going back to Jewish brothers and sisters that trust in the great Jehovah God amen yes sir learn his marvelous name but even wider than Israel itself this presence of Almighty God is it's just seeping out and permeating every aspect of the entire universe Oh friends it's everywhere if you have any super spiritual sense you'll recognize that the universe is moving we live in a changing world and there is a new world order being born and emerging and you know for the new world order to come into being or to fully appear on the scene the old order must go it has to rot and die in the put away so that the New World Order can come to life and be made manifest right before us so therefore we are in the midst social change is going on political change is going on there's a generational change that's going on yes this new generation their way of thinking their mindset is totally different from the last generation or let me say my generation even my generation they won't taste us and their mindset is totally different this is going straight my friends the one world citizens of one world citizens American German Spanish French African whatever nation you're from it's moving away from that and it's growing my friends not to any specific race or any specific nation but it's moving on us all back to the original where we were at the beginning of the world with Adam and Eve when it was one race just one race and the name of that great race is the human race and thank God I'm a part of it I trust you are too regardless of who we are we are all moving into that great time yes sir one man sang some wonderful words one loved one world one word and it's also of course I am absolutely against one world church one world orna of man I'm talking about the order of man trying to control the world whatever you want to see about it but I'm telling you that I am making a clear and plain I am against that but I look at the word and the Word of God said whoever or whatever is to be done will be done and there will be this one world order one world government and one world church it's coming on the scene Oh friends it's even now beginning to display and the incrementalist show its powers to change the entire world scene to change the that the politics to change all the thinking and thoughts of the people in the world it's doing that right now so just to repeat we are undergoing moral and spiritual change we are undergoing social change we're undergoing a generational change just as much as when Joshua and Caleb they came to the Jordan then there was a new generation led by Joshua and Caleb that entered over into the promised land and all of that older generation the Bible said then died out and their bones bleached in the wilderness sad as it sounds that is what had to happen for the new age this new world order to emerge and to come upon the stream some folks are fighting and resisting change but it's not time for that you God the true believer doesn't need to fight and resist change but we can live in that change because like Daniel who did not fightin and rebel against Nebuchadnezzar but he lived proved he could live godly in the midst of Babylon whoa friends you are called out to be the ladies of the Living God that can come up from the buck the pond right through all the muck and mire and raise yourself to the rising of the Sun and Jesus said of them Oh Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these because Solomon was a fading glory his Solomon's glory was temporal it was just human but that one was god-given glory given to that Lily all you great wonderful lilies of God you children of the Most High wherever you are hear the word of the Lord have a voice or the Holy Spirit come out from amongst them be not partakers of their plates and alter God's unchanging hand listen to the Shepherd's voice my sheep hear my voice and the stranger they will not follow but they will follow and come to their Shepherds boys my friends the many do not realize the bigger picture that a new world order see a new world system is now being born one is being dismantled while the new has been now constructed right before her very eyes it's happening and if you're not watching it'll go right by you and you will not recognize it the old order has to die and pass away so you must be aware acknowledge these changes are here upon us right now praise the name of the Lord isn't our God good my friends the Scriptures tell us and I'm beginning to wake this up now that perilous times will be upon us when men are going to be lovers of their own selves trucebreakers traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God selfish the Bible tells us from such turn away all my friends turn turn turn why will you die come out from amongst them be not partakers of their plagues be not partakers of their sins be not partakers of their disease and their experiments be the partakers my friends and their foolishness come to the wisdom revelation and anointing of the word of God and you can have a new life a new walk you can even have a new Christian walk in Christian do you want to be a real Christian but the great Holy Spirit as in the Bible days living and working and moving within your life and with your soul accept him now and he will receive you into his marvelous kingdom who have you our area

Spirit upon you in every possible way our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you on this marvelous wonderful Sunday another opportunity to lift up your name and give your glory and honor Lord may the great Holy Spirit go far great all this spirit shine forth Lord God Oh spirit of the Living God there is no distance in prayer the world is like a drop in a bucket to you and you can take your word in the furthermost and uttermost part of the earth and plant the sea the spoken word seed of a living God to germinate and come to life for if that she'd been planted oh the watermen reason up again father made that predestinated seat on the living god come to life father by the hearing of the voice and the deep calling to the deep may the deep respond for your glory in Jesus
