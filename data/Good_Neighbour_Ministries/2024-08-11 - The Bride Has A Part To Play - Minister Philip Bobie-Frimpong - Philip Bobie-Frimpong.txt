thanks for even wickedness up today not so many people get up from their bed but you by your grace you are here and also we have somebody that you can lay our beding on him people in the world World they go through the same thing we are going through but they don't have no one to commit their problems too but we are so privileged that we are Sons and Daughters of God we can lay all our burdens on the Lord Jesus Christ and that makes the difference amen so without wasting much time let's pick up our scriptures my first scripture will be 2 Peter 1 verse 15 to 21 verse 15 to 21 moreover I will endeav that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance for you have not followed Finly devised fables when he made know unto you the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were eye witness of his majesty for he received from God the Father honor and Glory when they came such a voice to him from the excellent Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased um Verse 18 and this voice which came from heaven we heard when you were with him in the Holy Mount we have also a more sure word of Prophecy where unto ye do well that you take heat as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day Dawn and the day start arise in your hearts knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of Man by the holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost Joshua 1:3 every place that the soul of your foood shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses and the last one Revelation 19 verse 7 to1 maybe verse 7 Revelation 19 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamp is come and his wife had made herself ready amen and to her was granted that she should be IR in fine laning clean and white for the fine laning is the righteousness of saints and he said unto me right right right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamp and he said unto me these are the true saying of God and I fell at his she at at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren that have the Testament of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is a spirit of Prophecy I titled I will say that um the bride has has a part to play let's pray Heavenly most gracious Eternal God we are here this afternoon morning by your grace and mercy Lord Jesus Christ there is nothing that is hidden from you we are naked before thee we asking you for your mercy and Grace that you forgive us if anyone of us has done anything wrong against you father you didn't mean it but you have this confidence that the blood of Christ washed us from all sins all unbelief so Lord as we come to bring the word take me aside and help me that one word from you Lord will make a difference come and speak to your bride Lord we come against anything like may your spirit take full control over the service and please bless your children oh God let no one live the same way they came may they live more rejoice and more dry to your presence in Jesus name amen please be seated so if I title this I'm going to say that the bride has a part to play or as we said that um the bride has made herself ready and before I go more forth as you read from those Scriptures it tells us that P said that he was there when he heard that voice that said this is my beloved Son hear ye him because at that time they were going trying to make an image for Elijah and some for Moses but there The Voice spoke and said no I'm the only one that deserve to be worshiped God Shar not his office of worship with anyone that's why he kicked the devil out from Heaven because him being a creation of God wanted to receive worship but God never Sayes worship with anyone that's one of the reasons why you know that the Lord Jesus Christ is God because he received worship because it was God in flesh God who could not die as a spirit as a spirit as a spirit created a body to come and live in and die and Sav us and his name is the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so those thing that came over there that voice because they wanted to make an image for Elijah and for Moses Elijah is a chief justice justice of God Moses is lawgiver and none of us want to approach god with law but you want Grace Grace Grace Grace Grace that is greater than all my sins the Capstone when the cry went out he said Grace Grace Grace it's not by power or by might but by my spirit says the Lord amen because remember the letter kth but the spirit that giveth life amen hallelujah so no scripture is of private interpretation amen and I love um last Sunday what our pastor Danny said about the reason why um we quot the prophet of God God send us a Vindicated prophet and he was trying to say that he was saying that none of us can really say it exactly how he said it that's why some most of the time we bring the quot to back what we are saying and uh I was just thinking about it and I I happened to go to um a coffee shop with a a new brother duie and one brother um the Mexican brother his name is Abel and then we buy coffee and blah blah but in the coffee shop I began to tell them about how this church started how God used Pastor Simon to um he used someone to send two books to him and when he received those two books commotion started he was kick out from the bible college and God used him to set up everything and it happened that I I was supposed to pass by Pastor former Pastor Simon and drop something for him so when we went there H with those brothers p Salon began to talk about the exact same thing I was telling them but the difference is because it was him that went through the whole thing he knew exactly place in Guyana when all those things happens so when was giv his personal testimony it doesn't matter how much I tried to explain to those Brothers when he spoke it there was a difference amen there was a difference because he has been there himself and what we are trying to say is that no one can talk about you than yourself you are your own you can you are the one that have to give your own testimony nobody knows you better than yourself I can talk about things about you but when you are talking about yourself it's a different ball game alog together because you are the one that has gone through it you know what God has done for you so if you can check and see our prophet of God what he does he talk about Elijah talk about Abraham talk about Isaac talk about everything but the testimony of on every instant he bring it back to present day Ministry of what God is doing in his life so what I'm trying to say is that Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's good to talk about the past it's good to talk about the future but you have to know what God is doing in your personal life right now present stage of his ministry what is God doing through you is your life worthy of the Gospel Are you standing by the word of God or are you just following the crowd are you following just the crowd what is God doing through you as Des said that you cannot talk about my testimony you have to have your own personal experience with God you have to able to give up your own testimony What the Lord Has Done For You amen but we are not trying to bring it to make it like um what am I trying to say to make it so huge and so big that people will look down upon themselves because remember what every what God does is according The Measure of Faith so don't compare yourself with somebody and say God has used this one so big my testimony doesn't mean nothing amen something brother sister amen because listen even to live in this present age the things that is going on for you to even to have have a sound mind it's a victory the prophet said that all the people will go in sane except those that are true bride of Christ to live with your wife and husband for all these years doesn't matter what problems you have and God kept that marriage is a victory Amen to have children and raise them up to have aign man or whatever it is is a victory listen don't take things for granted to have your health is a victory that's why I said um say um speak about what God has done for you it will surprise to What the Lord Has Done For You amen talk about what good things God has done in your past it will surprise you think about that and give testimony of those things and that will R will give you faith that will encourage you so that you can get more and more and more of those so don't look huge things yes the prophet God spoke through him those with that leg get leg with that that's all good that was the height of his ministry I'm not saying that God cannot use us like that because said the works that I do shall you also greater than these because it's going to be a m member body he's the same yesterday today and forever so what I'm encouraging is that just give your testimony and listen Peter and John um what am I trying to say Jesus Christ is same yesterday today and forever so God as a spirit could not die that Spirit created a body to die and to come and live and save us so when he died he gave up The Ghost and then what happened that's when um he went after Calvary he gave his Spirit out he came out that Spirit came out and then on the day of Pentecost those 70 people 120 were the first to witness the Christ Living in us the Holy Ghost and they asked Peter what shall you said men and Brethren repent everyone of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is what is unto you and to your children and to them that are even a far of as many as the Lord Our God shall call is God still calling amen if he still calling that promise is for you and me today because he's the same yesterday today and forever and I think I believe that when that thing happened to Peter and John and the rest their faith went up like that amen they began to give a testimony of what God has done for them that's why I say it's important to talk about your testimony amen so remember when when they met that that gate of beautiful amen what they said they said that Silver and Gold Have v n what we have is in the name of Jesus get up and walk and that lay man get up and began to walk and hop amen amen because why Peter and John was giving their testimony and in that meeting when they did that because that man who was was there the Pharisees and the sagues sad you see when God Use Somebody to do this Mighty work instead of them being happy they were grief in their heart why because they didn't want that name of Jesus Christ to be mentioned again and they tried to shut Peter and John down and said don't mention that name said should you listen to man or God Amen we we we what I'm trying to say is that we obey the laws of the land amen don't get me wrong we are obedience but when the law of the land is contrary to this word of God I go by like this amen you can't shut my mouth I believe that's what right Peter did he said that should you listen to man or should you listen to God Amen so when they tried everything they said that these people you can't do nothing to them then they are ignorant and unlearn it bra said that even Peter canot even write his name but you know the emphasize the emphasize is that they have been with Jesus that makes the difference it doesn't matter if you don't even know how your left and right how to read your name or to write your name all that God requires that you have to be with Jesus people have to see the Life of Christ in you it is the life that the demon fear and tremble the name behind the life behind the name that let the demon fear and tremble so they have to see your testimony and then your testimony has to back up with the word of God and the people have to see that you have been with Jesus that's the only requirement there is no any other requirement than being with Jesus you have to project Christ wherever you go let people see Christ in you don't look at somebody's testimony and disregard yourself you are a son or daughter of the Living God the same God is in you the same God that was in the prophet that's in all those High people that same God the same God in the woman who is a wash washing the same God is here God hasn't changed God that that was in Abraham that was in Isaac that was in Jacob that came in the form of a man and died on Calvary and gave up his ghost that same God is here with you and me toight he's in you it's in me have that confidence that God created the whole universe oh yeah he lives in he lives in me he's the same yesterday today and forever he took his prophet he never took his spirit that spirit is here where is Elijah God the god of Elijah that's why we are serving you are not worshiping Elijah we worshiping the god of Elijah and what that God did through Elijah if thou can't believe he can do exact same thing through you according to your faith all things are possible to them that believe amen it's not according to me or what but those that believe all things it's not something all are possible to them that believe that have recognized that they have baptized the name of Jesus they have recognized what God is doing and have that confidence that God did not let a Spirit when he took his Prophet that same spirit is here and he riding the trail in the with the bride once again amen is God in you the hope of your glory he's the same yesterday today and forever no matter what you going through have confidence in God believe God he said believe in God and believe also in me if it are not s I'm going to prepare a place for you where I am there you also be amen we enjoy kofi's testimony amen he talk about Lazarus and the god that raised Lazarus up that same God is here listen the scripture said I'll not leave your soul to suffer in Hell or what to see corruption after 4 days corruption set in so God won't allow his son to go through that but listen Lazarus wow Lazarus died for 4 days his sister said that he at this time he's stinking corruption was set in and God raised him up tell me this afternoon what are you going through that the Lord God cannot bring you out if he could raise Lazarus up someone who has died and is tinking and rais him up from Death what are you going through tonight don't worry all things are possible to them that believe if thou can believe all things are possible our God is awesome God he's the same yesterday today and forever he promise he will never leave you nor forsake you amen let's have confidence in God Amen he'll do the same thing to us amen hallelujah so it's about your personal experience how can you that got exp that experience it is through Revelation amen it's only God who reveals himself without Revelation it's impossible to please God Amen you can never please him with that Revelation hallelujah amen and God himself has to reveal himself to you Hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever I'm just going to read this quote here just to back up my point here um God is his own interpreter um paragraph 3338 God does his own interpreting to to Hest sincere heart men and women that looks upon upon the things that is mysterious if you are Hest and sincere and will believe God has a way of interpreting to you first find out if it's a promise Hallelujah if Joseph had just have went back and got away from the traditions and went back to the Bible and find out what Isaiah said she was going to do that and the place I like vers 38 he said as I was preaching a few weeks ago living in a glare a glare is a marriage Mirage sorry the sun reflecting itself and is false and any glare of another age is false reflection the people always are walking in something that happened years ago they look are working in a Lutheran glare Luther's sunlight was fine in his day Wesley was good in his day Pentecost was good in his day we are going up on the ladder you are living in another age we are going on and we can't keep looking back so every age the people who recognize what God is doing they are the children of God in that age and what happen that God is his own interpreter he makes it clear the Bible has said a virgin shall conceived and he'll be born in Bethlehem he gave all those descriptions but the firest SE they s Seas they have what make up their old way that thing will happen so when that thing happened right in their eyes they did not see it and is a history always repeat itself God is his own interpreter he make it plain plain as plain can be he said a virgin shall conceive He he'll be born in Bethlehem all those things were de clear in the Bible the Pharisees they have read the Bible they know they can just put a pin and tell you every scripture to the dot but when the thing happened they couldn't see it but Simon someone who was blind man he was waiting on God he had an honest heart he was looking to the Lord Jesus Christ and God has to visit him and told him Simon go here this is that lady Mary was look upon down was look down they thought she has committed adultery nobody know the father of his son and they were making moery of him and when you think about it the Lord that created the whole universe gold silver everything is his he came he didn't even have a place to sleep they cover him with a swadling clothes and I imagine all those people were getting away and what making not about Mary saying something bad about her but she knew what the Angels spoke to her she knew that she has SM the angel for herself so it doesn't matter what the people are saying she didn't pay any attention to them so it's a true bride of Christ you knew we have been in that that room with the Lord Jesus Christ you knew how God came to you you alone knew how God has revealed himself to you and nobody what the people tell I remember when God called me my friends thought I was cuckoo here but I wasn't cuckoo I've met the Lord Jesus Christ I know what God was doing in my life I was so confident I'm so sure of what God was doing because I have been what carrying the word of God from that time Mary was carrying that word of God in her womb she didn't care how mocky people were thinking about her she she knew what she was caring so you knew what God what has come to you so doesn't matter what the people from outside talks about you look down upon you persecute you ridic you say what by you you know what you are caring is the word of the Living God so you don't look at those things just give God thanks give him praise give him the glory give him honor thank you for everything because he has done great things in our lives by even all mind the greatest thing that could ever happened to anyone is a Salvation of their soul and you and I have come to recognize that the god that created the whole universe he has come to us as he came to Peter and the rest on that age he has come to us in this age if we were living the time when when he came in flesh you have been those that be following him because why he came this year he came in our time you recognize it so you are that bride of Christ you are that one don't let nothing look down upon yourself be happy and move on doesn't matter what what sh no no no wonder Paul said oh sorry Peter said where can we go thou alone has eternal life what shall separate us from the love of God is it persecution trust nothing God has been so good to us so let's Press On Let's press on if you only know what are wait for us in future we going to be pressing on if you only know what's at the back of it you're going to be pressing on pressing on pressing on press on press on Don't Look Back lot look lot wife look back and he became like salt we moving forward lay aside every weight of sin that beset you and move Higher Grounds higher higher Amen in the Lord Jesus Christ go deep in the word give God a chance Lay Your Side yourself side aside and let God deal with your heart and give you whatever is on like the just cast it out because listen God you are naked before God everyone of amen no one can hide anything from God so what are you hiding just be honest with yourself and if there's anything that you can't solve is bigger than you just leave it in God's hands and he will bring it to pass in Psalm 107 said that commit your ways to God and he will bring it to pass he will bring everything to pass just commit it to him because you cannot solve those problems I cannot solve it but God can solve it so lay everything in front of him and don't hold anything your heart against anybody no grudge it doesn't matter what they have done to you just forgive because if you don't forgive how your heavenly father also forgive you so let's forgive and move on and believe that God will what do Mighty Works through us because he's the same yesterday today and forever he's an awesome let's give him an Applause our God is good all the time amen praise God [Music] hallelujah oh thank you and Abel offered an excellent Sacrifice by revelation and God will testify of his gift in him so if you do the Bible said anything done without FEI is sin so anything you do with Revelation behind it as God testify of Abel's sacrifice he will testify of yours too but if you do it just to please people or you do it because someone tells you to do it and you don't have the understanding why you doing it is going to be stink in God's nose God don't want us to be a copycat just do it because somebody said do it and even if you're going to do it have an understanding why you are doing it because God hasn't changed and he the same yesterday today and forever God could have let the children of Israel give them Victory everything is that right but he took told them that everywhere that you put your foot I've given to you footsteps mean possession so there's a part we have to play there's a decisions we have to make in every marriage before that marriage takes place um that let me just uh see if I can just um make it more simple here uh before every marriage takes place that's fine there's a decisions that we have to make is that right when the man me the bride the bride has to the man has to propose to the bride and the bride has a choice to accept or reject it is that right and I believe that God sometimes most of the time some people they like to play around things they don't want to be certain so you got to be put in a PO a spot that you have to make a decision because the groom and the bride they can be friends and talk for so many years now these days they want to just called for like 10 years 5 years before they get married but some men don't don't have don't want them don't want their time to be wasted so they'll bring to a point that he's going to go and propose to you and said do you love me I love you I want to marry you at that time you cannot hide you are forced to make a decision yes or no so is with the word of God when God comes to you can accept this or you can reject it and all those things God bring people to that point I believe one time Joshua saw the same thing if the God on the other side is God you people worship him I and my family you going to Worship the Lord Jesus Christ he made that choice Elijah told them if bail be bail worship bail if God is God worship God so God doesn't want a lukewarm Christianity hot or cold you have to make a choice you have to make a decision I believe that Nom brought Ruth and opah in that same Junction of time they were forced to make a decision and in that decision Opa being a type of the larm denominational church he just walk away because Naomi presented it to her in such a way that there's no need for her to follow her because she said now I'm an old lady even if I have to go and get another man to get married are you going to be able to wait until I get a child and then you go and marry that child so naturally it look very what it look very it doesn't make sense for them to follow neomi but Ruth was of a different spirit I believe she was of the bright Spirit she said whever you go I will go with you your people will be my people your if wherever you die I'll die with you whever you eat I'll eat with you your God will be my God that's what God is expecting from us to make that right commitment that decision said Lord I'm following you through think or think I've made up my mind to go God's way all the way amen Goodbye old world I have nothing to do with you My Mind Is Made Up To Go God's way all the time amen so we have to make decisions after the decisions are made I think the next thing is um engagement after engagement is the wedding end the wedding ceremony Hallelujah I think I have something that clarify here yeah okay the promise made there has to be a promise made to one another like that you make a promise sweetheart if you marry me I promise that I'll be loyal and true I'll look upon no other woman or I'll look upon no other man and I'll do all that as a duty as a wife we have children it will do all as a duty as a as a mother I will be a housekeeper all the promise has got to be made or should be in a correct wding and that's the same thing when you come to Christ Lord if you receive me in your kingdom I promise there you are I'll love you sometime you forgot our first love I'll be true to you I'll serve you day and night it's too bad we forget that I'll serve you day and night I'll fast I'll pray I'll be loyal to you I'll bring my Tian into your Storehouse I'll pray many times a day I'll I will do anything and I'll pledge all my love to you that's what we should do that's exactly right where you promise that and should come from your heart so when that woman made that promise to the woman to the husband and that promise is not coming from her heart she's receiv receiving that man but you can't deceive God so that woman is just raising the children for that man because in her heart she didn't make that promise from the depth of her heart so that woman is not 100% true to the man she's just raising her children but if it comes from heart through death pain or sorrow of enjoyment she stick they stay together because she love her and that love is not based on any condition it's based on a pure love that's why right now if money was to be the evidence or a milestone for love then Elon mask um Jeff Bezos and bate they'll still be keeping their wives it's based on the love so it's the love of God in our heart that makes a difference and if you make that promise andore from your heart that marriage artificial marriage the same thing we have tooth your tooth broke you replace it it's a artificial tooth you're not taking that with you those things replace the we are not is not going back it's attached to us but it's not part of us you understand what I'm saying so to be part of God is to be born again that's a true Christian and to be born again it means that before you even came here God knew you before the foundations of the world we did not become SE by what the r birth we were SE and therefore you were reborn for any elect can only the elect can be reborn so because we are seed of God we can what be reborn and we make those decisions from our heart and God being God did not wait for you to make that decision because he being god with his elective and predestinated and for knowledge he knew before you even make that decision based on that he said Jacob have I loved Esau have I hatte before those children were even what born that same God is here tonight so you can't be a Christian until Christ inject himself by the baptism of the Holy Ghost into you then you are connected with him you are no longer Twain you are one Christ promised to be in us as the father was in Christ I am my father are one you and I are one see Christ in us all that was what that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church to continue what the work of the gospel and we are the Contin ation of the book of Acts whatever God did through the apostles I believe he's doing the same thing through US amen true us and in us because he's the same yesterday today and forever we have an awesome God so the bride has a part to play and her part is to make herself ready just like Esther Esther when the king were looking for virgins she didn't go with material adoring of the body braam says she went with a pure an excellent Spirit That's What attracted the king is a pure Spirit a Bible say that a contract and a broken spirit I will not despise and what is that pure Spirit what is that pure heart that Pure Heart Is What by washing of the word by the word of God you let the word of God wash you and cleanses you by the word of God that give you what that Purity around you and God is looking for an honest heart and pure heart because without that you always going to be artificial you cannot be part of him but those who are part of him they have that ability to receive that word of God and live it as said that those who hearts are pure will see God it's a scripture but the Purity comes by cleansing your heart just like Esther she makes sure her heart was clean so when she met the king the king all those women that came with all those all those kind of dressing blah blah blah she he put them as a concubines but when he met and felt the presence the atmosphere and ran I said this is the one she is my bride amen and what he he took her to be her wife so our part is to what have the pure Spirit around us amen that's most important thing our God is good he's the same yesterday today and forever he hasn't changed amen whatever he promised to do he'll do it again hallelujah thank you Lord amen hallelujah praise our God so what am I trying to say that we have to be ready because we have a part to play and remember somewhere in the Bible it says that the people were son ascender they were uh they didn't have a place to to sleep they did all those things but they without us shall not be what made perfect the Olympics that they just ran they everybody left those when the Baton was changing they left their fastest guy in the last lap amen and Canada left Andre the grass who is our best guy on the last lap to complete the race so God has done to you and me he has left us at the last ones to come to finish the race so let's finish the race with what pure heart and let's not give up on anything because you are the one they are depending on us all those people that you look to Peter Paul oh man this is the most glorious age if there was any time that this a glorious age yet is the most deceiving age but it's the best of times it's the best of age that God is revealing himself he has never revealed himself the highest manner like this before amen all those things listen it's a two-way thing all those demons from Nimrod and all those things are all cating but all those Spirit from Adam from Joshua from all those things are also what house communting us and we we are what greater is greater he that is in you than he that's in the world so God of the whole universe is in you and it's in me and is able to face every challenge that you come across in this time so just don't lose hope no matter what comes your way our life is in his hand he will fight our battles he will give us the victory victory in Jesus Christ he's the same yesterday today and forever our God is awesome he has done Mighty work to us let's remember to thank him to give him praise and adoration all the time because he deserve our worship he deserve to be glorified he's the same yesterday today and forever don't look down upon yourself give him praise give him thanks no matter what comes away our life is in his hand he's the same yesterday today and forever as he did back then he's doing the same to us amen God is good God hallelujah amen you could have choose for the people to be you have to overcome there is something you have to overcome he said that is given to overcome us he's giv to overcome us but he made it simple he that overcame Liv in you amen so he overcome for you amen but there something you have to do brother and sister it's not a flurry bed of easy Christian work is not a flurry bed of is butam Sam said that he has been in battle and been fighting ever since for all these 30 years but you see God has come to a place the the word has come to a place that God has given us a rest and we realize that our human effort we can't do anything so we are resting on his word we are resting on him to our B to do everything for us because our might we cannot do it it has come to a part that it takes God himself some situations that some people are going through we are going through it takes God on the scene it takes God on the scene it takes God himself to overcome those situations and if that God lives in you when the time comes he will show up amen when there he will show up you just relax he show up when he has to show [Laughter] up so don't worry all things are possible to them that love God when the time for him to show up he will show up amen praise God our God is good he's a wonderful God Amen I'm going to just give my last word and then I'm going to prepared I don't talk for too long so don't don't worry about me that's the way I am I'm not long uh speaker so I'm going to be trying to R wind up very soon um one other thing too you see um what am I saying the wise men in their time they look and saw the linting of the stars and when they saw that they knew that the Mah was Bor and I believe the wise men in our age in our time is a bride of Christ and we look through a prophetic eye that God said as a Vindicator Prophet his name is William Aon Braham and God gave him seven visions and all those seven Vision has come to pass and weew that with this things happening our Redemption is drawing nearer when you look at what happened in Israel Britain in chaos everywhere in chaos if you look at things that happened around you even people who are not Christians they could sense something is coming something is not right the whole world isul by Sodom Spirit as it was the the days of Sodom and Gomorrah so shall it be when the stand of man is revealed we are in Sodom everything is sodomite the whole word is gone insane you look at Israel oh man fight they fight everywhere on from many on many fronts and God is fighting their battle for them and we are type of Israel the Bride is a spiritual Israel so it means that there a battle going on but God is the one who's fighting for our battles he going to give us a victory because we have already overcome already overcome he overcome already just have to follow his voice follow that voice of God the voice that call you the voice that have followed all these years that's God's voice is going to lead you through have confidence in that voice it's the voice of God it let do nothing to to the pure word of God for your age so we have to have confidence in that voice that the voice of God will lead you through amen that little small voice don't ignore it just be attentive and spiritual to it God want to speak to you what going to direct you don't brush it off let God have preeminence lay aside every weight of sin that Bes set us let God move through our ministry so that we can be a blessing amen because when the last one comes in we are going but how can he come we have to Avail ourselves are you ready for God to use you he said the Harvest are plenty but the laborers are few are you the one availing yourself so that God can use you in this end time it doesn't mean that maybe you have to win 10 souls or whatever whatever God wants you to do listen one time God told the prophet just go and C somebody's grass that was the purpose that God wants him to do just be attentive he can use it for bigger things I'm not um neglecting that he can use to do raise the dead do everything it's all part of his ministry can just tell just give somebody a tip or give somebody a right just something small do something for somebody read help him whatever it is I don't know but just be attentive to that little small voice so that you don't miss your blessing and count your blessings and name them one by one it will surprise you what does God has done for you and the last thing um I read last week about Rwanda that they Clos about 5 or 7,000 churches and they saying that oh all those T because if the wise men could see that the L of the stars and could know that the Messiah is born so is a bride of chist you have to be what wake up and see the things that happen around us and they have closed all those churches they say they said most so they are not signing through blah blah but behind that they hide a word that most of them those Pentecostal CH they have no theological certificate is it the time that they using as a pilot program to come against us without those theological certificates I don't know but all these things should let us awake when you see what happening in Israel when you see things that is going on we should be aler like those wise men knowing that our Redemption is Drawing Near amen amen so many things you can see so many that's happening even braam said I was going to be a a vice president and the woman the purple and all those things happening happening in our eyes we've seen all that Catholic Church ruling now in the US Congress they have inflated all they have infiltrated all mostly Catholics Roman Church ruling everything what time are we living in sin I believe that when Daniel read Jeremiah writings it put him under desperation and there was a time that the bride of Christ has be desperate is now and if you know want to be desperate he going to put that to make you desperate you're going to bring situations your life that going to put you on your knees to cry to seek his face to have more of him so that you can fulfill your purpose amen because there musicians can get can begin to come there's some purpose that you have to fulfill there's something that you alone has to fulfill I cannot do it you have to do it no and listen even if you chose not to and you try to run away and do what whatever God has purpose to happen through you it will come to pass one time Zacharia refused the voice of God and and doubted his doubt didn't stop God from bringing John the Baptist through his lineage that same God is here so being a son or daughter of God sometime you have choice and you have no choice it's a paradox but one of these days one of these days you're going to go for the marriage supper of the lambu you're going to go to be in the Rapture for three and a half years honeymoon he's coming
