[1:15] all these that are watching listening

[1:21] uttermost part of the earth may you take
[1:23] all the praise the honor and glory and
[1:26] may your word go forth Lord Jesus with
[1:30] clarity and divine understanding be
[1:34] given to all those who desire to have it
[1:37] has become it ourselves to you our
[1:40] selves to you now in service for your
[1:44] glory and honor alone in Jesus name Amen
[1:51] reading from John from the book of
[1:55] Revelation chapter 1 verse 4 John to the
[2:02] seven churches which are in Asia grace
[2:05] be unto you and peace from him which is
[2:11] and which was and which is to come and
[2:19] from the
[2:20] and spirits which are before his throne
[2:28] now friends let us go back to the Bible
[2:32] last week of course we touched upon the
[2:37] deity of Jesus Christ and showing to you
[2:42] the fallacy of the doctrine of the
[2:47] Trinity of the Godhead now let's go back
[2:54] to the Bible and see who or what God was
[2:59] in the beginning now according to the
[3:03] revelation that God gave about himself
[3:06] he Jehovah appeared to Israel in the
[3:12] form of a pillar of fire and there he
[3:15] was high above their tents in that form
[3:19] and as the angel of the Covenant he
[3:24] lived in that pillar of fire and a led
[3:29] Israel daily for they can see the pillar
[3:33] fire and when it moved they move when it
[3:36] stopped they stopped but one day he was
[3:43] made manifested he Jehovah was made
[3:47] manifested in a virgin born body that
[3:53] was prepared for him as it's written in
[3:57] the scriptures our body has now prepared
[4:00] me now the god that was tabernacled
[4:06] above the tents of Israel in the form of
[4:11] the pillar of fire now took upon himself
[4:15] a tenth of human flesh and tabernacled
[4:23] amongst us as a man but he was the same
[4:31] God now God
[4:34] above us God among us and now in our day
[4:41] it's God in us now the Bible teaches us
[4:46] clearly that God was in Christ the body
[4:51] of course was Jesus and in him in that
[5:00] body called Jesus in him dwelt the
[5:04] fullness of the Godhead bodily God dwelt
[5:10] in Christ but nothing can be plainer
[5:14] than that that we can see the truth of
[5:17] the revelation of the Godhead if he
[5:22] wasn't
[5:23] three people then back there in Israel
[5:27] above their tents and he isn't three
[5:32] people now for God is a God that never
[5:37] changes oh praise this wonderful name
[5:42] that we serve this mighty God now Jesus
[5:48] himself said in John chapter 16 verse 27
[5:52] to 28 I came from God and I'm going back
[5:57] to God clearly that is exactly what
[6:01] happened because after he he was
[6:04] crucified
[6:05] of course he disappeared from off the
[6:08] scene his next reparent was when Paul
[6:14] met him on the road to Damascus and Paul
[6:19] saw him and the form of a pure fire or a
[6:25] blinding light that struck him off of
[6:28] his horse you see he had gone back to
[6:33] the way he was exactly the way he said
[6:36] he would do I came from God and I'm
[6:40] going back to God he was the purifier
[6:44] over the tents of his
[6:45] and now he went back to his original
[6:49] form and position as that purifier
[6:53] that's true pull off of his horse and to
[6:57] prove it the boys from the light said
[7:02] Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and
[7:09] Paul asked the question who art thou
[7:13] Lord and the voice answered back the
[7:18] purifier answered by this blinding
[7:21] shining light answered back and said I
[7:25] am Jesus whom thou persecuted
[7:29] Oh Paul immediately recognized that pure
[7:36] fire was God and he asked the question
[7:40] who art thou Lord and the voice from the
[7:45] pure fire answered back and said this
[7:49] God this purifier answered back and said
[7:52] I am Jesus you see he had gone back to
[7:59] his original form that he was in before
[8:04] he had taken on a tabernacle of flesh
[8:09] now Luke chapter 2 verse 11 says for
[8:15] unto you Is Born This Day in the City of
[8:18] David a saviour which is Christ the Lord
[8:23] now he was born Christ but eight days
[8:28] later he had to have an earthly name and
[8:32] the earthly name that was given to him
[8:36] was Jesus now I was born a cypress and
[8:44] when I was born they gave me the name of
[8:50] John you see he was given he was Christ
[8:56] but when he
[8:58] came to the earth he had to be given an
[9:01] earthly name and his earthly name was
[9:04] Jesus which makes him Jesus Christ
[9:09] because we know clearly friends that he
[9:14] that upward Tabernacle was called Jesus
[9:19] but on the inside he was the Lord of
[9:23] glory on the inside he was the great I
[9:29] am on the inside
[9:32] he my friends was the mighty God the
[9:37] Almighty God manifested in flesh he was
[9:43] God the Father the Son and the Holy
[9:46] Ghost the only God and he is all in all
[9:52] yes Father Son and Holy Ghost are just
[9:57] titles they are not names that is why we
[10:06] baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[10:10] Christ if you were to come to good
[10:14] neighbor ministries and ask me or any of
[10:17] my deacons to baptize you in water they
[10:21] will baptize you in no other name but
[10:24] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you
[10:29] see for the name Jesus Christ is a name
[10:35] not a title that is the Jesus Christ is
[10:42] the name of those titles just like if
[10:48] there was to be a you were to have a
[10:51] newborn a baby
[10:54] you find there that you would want to it
[11:00] is a son you will want to name him Jim
[11:03] or Jeff for or John now baby is his
[11:10] title but
[11:12] or John is his name see that's the way
[11:16] it is No
[11:17] so that's it friends just like that I
[11:20] I'm her father
[11:21] but that's not my name I'm a son to my
[11:25] mother
[11:26] but that's not my name I'm a human being
[11:30] that's what I am but that is not my name
[11:34] those are titles my name is John and
[11:39] that is the difference between the
[11:42] titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost and
[11:46] the name Jesus Christ and that is why we
[11:52] baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[11:55] Christ now we do not baptized in Jesus
[11:58] name for there are thousands of Jesus's
[12:02] many people even before Jesus was born
[12:05] what that were called in Jesus but there
[12:10] was only one born Jesus the Christ the
[12:15] Anointed One the Word of God the Word of
[12:20] God made flesh in a body called Jesus
[12:25] but he is distinguished by being the
[12:29] Christ the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[12:35] praise God John Scott's bells listen
[12:39] carefully in the beginning was the word
[12:43] and the Word was with God and the Word
[12:46] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[12:51] dwelt among us see there it is Jesus the
[12:56] tabernacle said my father
[13:00] dwells in me my father dwells in me why
[13:05] because the farmer spirit the great one
[13:09] had created this body and the body was
[13:15] the son of that spirit and the father
[13:18] came and dwelt in the son who was not
[13:22] another
[13:23] but he dwelt in the in the body that he
[13:27] had brought on the scene or created or
[13:30] prepared for himself God dwelt in Christ
[13:34] Jesus was the tent that God dwelt in
[13:41] this is which he spoke of when he said
[13:44] Solomon you want to build me a house how
[13:48] can you build me a house the heavens of
[13:51] heavens cannot contain me but I'll build
[13:54] myself in other words of my own house
[13:56] and that house of God is Jesus Christ
[14:00] for God dwelt in Christ amen and amen
[14:04] now God has many titles Jehovah our
[14:11] righteousness he is our peace he is the
[14:16] ever-present water from the rock he is
[14:21] father he is son he is all his ghosts
[14:24] but he only has one human name you may
[14:29] call him by many other names but he but
[14:31] by many other titles but he only has one
[14:35] human name oh praise the name of the
[14:40] Lord now don't be confused by any of
[14:44] these offices for it's God in a tree
[14:49] form manifestation on earth he was a
[14:53] prophet in heaven at this time he is our
[14:58] great High Priest offering in the
[15:00] session for our sins in the presence of
[15:04] his throne he was a prophet he is the
[15:11] priest and coming back to earth he is
[15:15] the king of kings and Lord of lords yes
[15:19] that's who he is yes no wonder the
[15:23] scripture says Amen he my friends that
[15:29] was that is and he that is to come
[15:35] thanks Peter
[15:36] God hallelujah blessed be his holy name
[15:41] now notice carefully now the revelation
[15:45] that we are bringing is that Jesus
[15:48] Christ is God I want you to understand
[15:52] that clearly that Jesus Christ is God
[15:57] and that day Jehovah of the Old
[16:02] Testament is the Jesus of the New
[16:07] Testament
[16:08] it's just that Jehovah went into a body
[16:13] fulfilling God was in Christ reconciling
[16:18] the world unto himself and no matter
[16:23] what anyone tries to do you can never
[16:28] and cannot prove that they were three
[16:31] God's by using this Bible or from
[16:35] anything God has said in his word but it
[16:40] does take a revelation by the Holy
[16:42] Spirit for you to recognize that but and
[16:46] Satan has crept into the church into the
[16:50] highest heights of of accomplishments
[16:54] within the church and using his position
[16:58] as a great angel of light as he did in
[17:02] heaven has blinded the minds of men
[17:06] blinded and blindfolded the hearts of
[17:10] men that's why we sing this song open
[17:13] the eyes of my heart Lord that let me
[17:16] see you I want to see you which is the
[17:20] presuppose that that person was blinded
[17:23] and could not recognize who is Lord but
[17:27] I'm here to proclaim that Jesus Christ
[17:30] as Lord Jesus Christ is Father Son and
[17:34] Holy Ghost amen and amen yes sir Judas
[17:39] crept into the church blinded the
[17:41] preachers blinded the people to this
[17:45] marvelous truth but takes me to God it
[17:49] not long my friends where they vary
[17:52] Church of Rome
[17:54] stop baptizing in the name of the Lord
[17:58] Jesus Christ will touch on that later
[18:00] but we understand that originally they
[18:04] Roman the church baptized in the name of
[18:09] the Lord Jesus Christ as I do and as
[18:12] true believers do they baptize in no
[18:17] other name but the name of the Lord
[18:20] Jesus Christ now this takes a revelation
[18:23] but takes me to God the God's powerful
[18:27] prevailing overcoming church is built on
[18:31] the rough foundation of Revelation upon
[18:35] this rock will I build my church and the
[18:38] gates of Hell will not prevail against
[18:42] it thanks be to God the foundation of
[18:45] God's church is prevailing revelation
[18:49] and I use the word prevailing because he
[18:52] clearly said that the gates of Hell will
[18:55] not prevail against the true Church of
[18:59] the Living God which is the same it will
[19:01] fight it will try to overcome try to
[19:05] block out try to to dumb down and line
[19:09] the Church of God but it will not
[19:12] prevail against the overcoming blood
[19:15] wash powerful Church of the Living God
[19:18] in this day praise God
[19:21] so we need revelation to recognize this
[19:25] but in actual fact for the water baptism
[19:28] we don't need a revelation you don't
[19:31] really need a revelation because it's
[19:34] right there
[19:35] before your very face in the Word of God
[19:38] in the Bible for you to recognize us now
[19:43] that's the way the Apostles baptized and
[19:45] if they didn't baptize that way if they
[19:49] did not recognize or what Matthew 28 men
[19:53] when it says baptizing them in the name
[19:56] of the Father
[19:58] of the Son and of the Holy Spirit if
[20:01] they did not recognize that then when
[20:04] they spoke in in Acts chapter 2 verse 38
[20:10] and other scriptures acts 4:12 and so on
[20:13] is that then there will be in
[20:15] disobedience there would have been in
[20:17] disobedience to the Word of God but
[20:21] clearly when they were asked the
[20:23] question men and brethren what shall we
[20:28] do to be saved and a Peter the so called
[20:32] for spoken and said clearly and
[20:36] unequivocally he said clearly repent and
[20:41] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[20:45] Jesus Christ and that is because he
[20:48] understood the name of the person who
[20:53] carried those titles oh yes so he said
[20:57] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[21:00] Jesus Christ so clearly here we see in
[21:05] the Word of God they knew what the name
[21:08] was then you what and who carried in him
[21:14] and so they baptize in the name of the
[21:18] Lord Jesus Christ and there is no place
[21:20] no place that anyone can find in the
[21:25] scriptures where anyone anywhere was
[21:29] baptized any other way but in the name
[21:34] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[21:36] no wonder the Apostle says all that you
[21:41] do do it in the name of the Lord Jesus
[21:44] Christ and again for there is no other
[21:48] name given under heaven whereby we must
[21:53] be saved but the name of our Lord and
[21:57] Savior Jesus Christ
[21:59] now clearly friends common sense will
[22:04] tell you that they book of Acts is the
[22:08] Church of the Living God in action and
[22:12] yes they baptized only in the name of
[22:16] the Lord Jesus Christ then that is the
[22:20] way we should all be baptizing in the
[22:24] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[22:27] so because that's they as we usually say
[22:31] that's the original church that's the
[22:33] pattern for the ages that were to come
[22:36] and so we should accept the truth of
[22:40] God's Word
[22:41] despite all these traditions of men all
[22:44] these teachings of men all these
[22:46] insertions and interjections of men into
[22:49] the very word of God blinding poisoning
[22:53] and distracting the minds of men from
[22:56] God's Word and team with the Word of God
[22:58] that he has given to us to recognize
[23:01] what he has said no we realize that even
[23:05] in the Bible they that work they work
[23:07] some people that were baptized wrong and
[23:11] you may be baptized wrong here it was
[23:14] the great great the wonderful people
[23:18] Apollo's other ones that Priscilla
[23:22] Aquila they were baptized wrong and so
[23:27] fun moving through the upper parts of
[23:31] Ephesus preaching the word and being
[23:37] received of the people they said they
[23:41] never heard it in this fashion we have
[23:43] not ever heard of the Holy Spirit and
[23:46] Paul said listen he explained to them we
[23:52] should want to baptize them Anto because
[23:56] normally you're baptized in water in the
[23:58] name of Jesus Christ the next thing that
[24:00] follows is the Holy Spirit comes to the
[24:03] believer to open up their understanding
[24:05] to anoint them with the waters of the
[24:08] word of God hallelujah so tyrannous he
[24:11] said then unto what were you baptized
[24:13] and they said we were baptized to John's
[24:17] baptism he says oh no John was point
[24:22] - this John was pointing unto him that
[24:27] was to come and he asked him and his
[24:30] name is the Lord Jesus Christ so if you
[24:33] were taking John's baptism now you need
[24:36] to take the baptism of the Lord Jesus
[24:39] Christ amen and they were humble enough
[24:44] they were understanding and winning
[24:48] enough to submit to the teaching of the
[24:51] word of God and a Bible says for upon re
[24:57] baptize them in water proper Christian
[25:01] baptism in the name of our Lord and
[25:04] Savior Jesus Christ there were five
[25:07] people but they still got three baptized
[25:12] you may be a fine person they felt
[25:16] secure they felt there it was fine they
[25:19] were already Saints they didn't need to
[25:21] listen to anybody else but the Holy
[25:24] Spirit through the bridge and a fall
[25:27] opened up and expanded and magnified the
[25:30] Word of God in such a way that their
[25:33] understanding opened up and they
[25:36] recognized their deep need and asked to
[25:40] be rebaptised by Paul hallelujah thanks
[25:44] be to God I'm not Paul I can't be bald
[25:47] and never will be Paul but I'm still a
[25:51] servant here to baptize you in water if
[25:55] you're so desire in the name of the Lord
[25:59] Jesus Christ praise God now said if you
[26:03] have been baptized in water the right
[26:06] and proper way which is in the name of
[26:08] the Lord Jesus Christ then God is
[26:11] obligated to fill you with the Holy
[26:14] Spirit and God my friends will begin to
[26:18] unfold the wonderful treasures of his
[26:22] word and His grace opening up the eyes
[26:26] of your understanding and filling you
[26:29] completely with His divine self praise
[26:33] God now Paul was teaching
[26:36] in Ephesus and Paul had not yet met
[26:42] Peter and yet he was written exactly
[26:46] what Peter preached in Acts chapter 2
[26:49] why because they were of the same spirit
[26:54] which is why Paul later on said oh I
[26:57] wish I could make all men see what is
[27:01] the Fellowship of this mystery because
[27:04] if two persons are in that same genuine
[27:09] Holy Spirit led by him with never having
[27:13] met like the prophets in the Bible like
[27:16] the great sages and men of old without
[27:19] knowing each other over that period of
[27:21] 1,600 years yet they spoke the same
[27:25] things and everything they said rolled
[27:28] together until it formed one book by
[27:32] these different writers over this period
[27:36] of time the mighty paths all his spirit
[27:39] is still at work today he is still able
[27:42] to a night man use men for his glory by
[27:46] the same Holy Spirit that that's written
[27:49] off within the very Bible now you'll
[27:54] find if you have the time research this
[28:00] there is a genuine record of a water
[28:05] baptism that took place in ancient Rome
[28:11] in d 100 it was and has been reproduced
[28:20] in the Time magazine December 5th 1965
[28:29] and I quote the deacon raised his hands
[28:34] and Publius Decius step through the
[28:40] baptistry door standing with the deep in
[28:45] the pool was Marcus Vaska the woods
[28:50] he was smiling as Publius waded into the
[28:55] pool beside him krita's he's he asked
[29:04] credo responded
[29:07] Publius I believe that my salvation
[29:11] comes from the Lord Jesus Christ who was
[29:16] baptized under Pilate Pontius Pilate and
[29:21] with him him I died that with him and I
[29:27] may have eternal life
[29:31] then he felt strong arm supporting him
[29:38] as he let himself fall backward into the
[29:43] pool and he heard Marcus's voice in his
[29:49] ears saying i baptize you in the name of
[29:55] the lord jesus christ as the cold water
[29:59] flows round about him friends that's the
[30:04] way the baptism was done in Rome
[30:08] not for convenience sake not for a
[30:12] little sprinkle here or a sprinkle there
[30:15] not for a flag passed over your head not
[30:18] just for a handshake of fellowship not
[30:22] in the resort but just as Jesus was
[30:25] baptized coming up out of the water just
[30:30] as the Bliss was baptized here in
[30:34] ancient Rome which was original the
[30:38] Roman water baptism but the church has
[30:42] drifted away from her original position
[30:45] the entire Worldwide Church I'm talking
[30:49] about yes has drifted from the original
[30:53] Word of God and a way of baptism
[30:57] according to this Bible that we have
[31:00] here now right up
[31:02] until this time that your the truth was
[31:05] lost and did not return until this time
[31:11] this last page in this hour in which we
[31:15] live whoever tells us clearly that pervy
[31:18] Elijah the prophet will return in this
[31:21] Gentile Age praise God the spirit of
[31:25] Elijah will anoint a man in this age and
[31:28] he will turn the hearts of the children
[31:31] that apostolic children back to the
[31:35] apostolate father's oh praise God it's
[31:39] happening it's happening right now by
[31:42] the power of the Holy Spirit and I thank
[31:45] my God for this oh yes friends know this
[31:49] we are speaking about from the time of
[31:52] the Nicean council till the turn of the
[31:55] century this true baptism was not heard
[31:59] about any longer for it was pushed aside
[32:02] for a Trinitarian baptism which closed
[32:10] early misunderstood the word of God and
[32:14] misinterpreted what God has said
[32:16] and to this day continuing to baptize in
[32:21] titles empty titles of Father Son and
[32:24] Holy Ghost and not in the name of the
[32:28] person that carries those titles yes sir
[32:32] but now thanks be to God that's
[32:35] restoration and it has come back it's
[32:39] been restored the truth of the word is
[32:43] now being restored to everyone that had
[32:46] an ear let him hear what the Spirit of
[32:50] God is saying to you
[32:52] rip Satan can't keep that revelation
[32:55] down he cannot keep this revelation of
[32:58] the name of Jesus the revelation of the
[33:01] Godhead the understanding of the truth
[33:04] water baptism he can't block it out for
[33:08] if the spirit wants to give it he cannot
[33:12] block it for God has
[33:14] but who shall resist who shall bruise
[33:17] who shall prevail against the mighty god
[33:21] the almighty when he brings his words
[33:24] for he sends his word and his word
[33:27] performs what every sense and it runs
[33:31] throughout the earth oh please God to
[33:34] accomplish whatever he wills it goes to
[33:37] any person anywhere in any land in any
[33:41] language of any culture region race
[33:45] religion wherever you are the Word of
[33:48] God goes out hallelujah for it's him the
[33:52] word the holy spirit making himself
[33:54] known in these last days praise God
[33:58] hallelujah now if there are really three
[34:03] gods then maybe that's why because of
[34:09] thinking that they baptize in those
[34:11] titles but the revelation that's in this
[34:16] Bible that was given to John clearly is
[34:21] that there is one God and His name is
[34:25] none other than the Lord Jesus Christ
[34:28] and you you baptize or we baptize for
[34:33] one God and only one God Peter the
[34:38] Apostle Peter baptized that way he did
[34:45] it on the day of Pentecost Paul baptized
[34:50] that way all the Apostles baptized that
[34:55] is way now Paul had to be true to the
[35:00] revelation that God had given to him
[35:05] which was let all the house of Israel
[35:10] know assuredly which means for certain
[35:13] for sure that God had made this same
[35:18] Jesus but lower than Christ he is the
[35:25] Lord Jesus Christ
[35:28] thanks be to God I tell you friends this
[35:34] great Lord Jesus Christ is one God than
[35:41] the hope of the old testament is now
[35:45] manifested in human form under the human
[35:52] name of Jesus Christ
[35:55] Philip once said to him one day Lord
[36:00] show us the father and it will satisfy
[36:04] us and Jesus listen close to how jesus
[36:09] answered him because remember in the Old
[36:12] Testament he was called I am I am that I
[36:16] am
[36:16] when offended when those Pharisees and
[36:22] Sadducees you know asked him he said
[36:27] before Abraham was I am
[36:30] and now Philip is asking here Lord show
[36:35] us the father and obviously Jesus was
[36:41] puzzled that they did not yet fully
[36:45] recognize who he was and so he said have
[36:49] I been so long with you have I you're
[36:54] asking for the father and yet he said
[36:57] have I I'm the father the spirit that
[37:01] was in that body answering John Philip
[37:05] and saying have I been so long with you
[37:11] and you don't know me he that has seen
[37:19] me has seen the father
[37:22] why for I and the father are one the
[37:28] same person I am the father are one
[37:32] there is no three God I am one God
[37:35] hallelujah and so friends that's the way
[37:40] this hearing nice
[37:42] in that you may say well brother Simon
[37:44] yeah you know it's it's three gods
[37:48] because here we are he said I and my
[37:52] father are one they are one in purpose
[37:55] there one in objectives there one in
[37:59] planning but he made it clear that was
[38:04] not that kind of a oneness that was
[38:07] being spoken about he clearly said I and
[38:11] my father are one
[38:13] right no the question may be asked
[38:18] you're looking at me you're seeing me
[38:21] now but do you see my wife and if you
[38:25] were to see my wife does that mean
[38:27] you're seeing me
[38:28] obviously not Jesus wanted them to
[38:33] understand clearly that he was their one
[38:37] true God now made manifest in flesh and
[38:42] said I and my father are one
[38:46] praise God Zechariah chapter 14 verse 7
[38:51] as I'm winding this down now said
[38:54] clearly it shall be light about the
[39:00] evening time or saying at evening time
[39:06] it shall be light in other words light
[39:09] will shine in evening time of the world
[39:12] revelation will come on the spending
[39:15] will come the power the presence of the
[39:18] holy spirit will prevail in these last
[39:21] days and will come upon the earth

[39:26] years ago saying it shall be light about
[39:31] the evening time the path to glory you

[39:38] light to be buried in the precious name
[39:42] of Jesus
