that's what the world is becoming and God is trying to tell you hold of God's unchanging hand Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] toing God no matter what's taking place the worldall falling apart the social system falling apart amen everything becoming so dark and disal unclean confusing but we are to hold to God's unchanging hand hallu if you're a Christian you will not be blown away by the UN coming storm because we have UN in Christ Jesus the rock of for me hide myself in praise be to God hallelujah amen spiritual Amnesia when the man thinks that he's a woman and the woman thinks she's a man when the voes start change and the woman's voice start to get BR and the women start to get aggressive with a masculin spirit and the men start to become feminine they have a h s right like that and the women's Voice start give me that give me that H over there turn is a man when you look you can't believe your eyes like but it's changing that way right the feminization of men and the masculinity of women and the women start to grow huge beer and the man's face start to get and they start to use creams and all kinds of stuff you know like that my God the whole thing is messed up I know about female gender male gender I never heard the Bible talk about gender but it seems like they're developing all kinds of stuff God but that's the way it is now but see because the people have lost their identity social STI they lost their identification they don't really know who they are and so they're acting like the best thing that they think they believe they can act like and that mistakes are made that way see you lost your spiritual memory when we were in heaven with him worshiping we were there before the foundation of the world but we lost our memory and we lost where we come from we lost our position that we have we lost our genealogy your roof your family you lost it all amen see and I want you to know this brother sister there was ways that they're working on to Amia and one of the ways to cure Amnesia is to give you the right medicine and that's what I'm trying to give you every day you might like the taste of it and nobody likes the taste of medicine except the wi know who like to go and buy those cough syrup and knock down a bottle just to get the percentage of alcohol in but the fact is brother and sister that I have to feed you the medicine of God's word amen and the medicine of God's word if the takeing the right has explosive [Laughter] force you're laughing because you understand what I'm saying it's really a spiritual prud is that right and after a while you can't control it it's going to begin to purge out the sin in your life purge out the uncleannesses in your system amen it's going to make you do that brother sister praise the Lord because God wants to clean you up and lean you out and make you a real child of God hallelujah amen praise the name of the Living God yes sir and also another way that they going to cure Amnesia is that you went into that state by a Shar so to bring you up they got to give you an equivalent shop and so what happens is that they're going to give you an electric shop with so many BTS in it and bring you back to yourself so sometimes you come in church here and the preacher got to preach the word and take you to a shocking experience and and the word of God got to shake you up amen when the word of God really shake you up come to your sens wake up praise the Lord somebody the preach got to pick you up and slap you a couple of times slap you a couple of times for you to come back to your senses to recognize who you are where you actually come from amen at other times the psychologist or the doctor will take that person and take them back to places where they used to live they pass by the old Home Place see if their memory going to keepi in they pass them by their old school or they bring them back their old friends that they used to have to see their faces to see them if something will just kick in that's why I'm preaching to you amen I'm preaching to you and taking you back to the old familiar places amen Were You There When They Crucified My Lord Where Were You When The Morning Star s together and the sons of God shout for Joy trying to take you back to a familiar place I want to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also I'm trying to bring you to a familiar place so somewhere your spirit catches on the word of God don't be afraid I'm finding this up now praise God hallelujah so take you back to those places so that you could recognize who you are and recognize where you come from I'm not supposed to be this person that I am you're a better person than you think you are the devil has made you put yourself down but in natural fact you're a better person than you think you are they only know outside but God knows you the woman the man that lives on the inside God knows your heart Hallelujah no matter what you're going through God knows your name he knows all about you praise God forever more hallelujah amen look you remember when Jesus on the morning when he rose from the from the dead and Mary rushed to the tomb and when she went there at first there was nobody the next time she came back and she looked in and when she stood up up there she saw a man and the Bible says she taught him to be the G and then that person spoke and says Mary I don't know how he said it but somehow she knew that voice and she knew when her name was called and right away she said Roni Master amen right away she recognized who he was amen let me tell you again he's risen from the dead it's calling your names by the word of God and right right now all of us may not immediately recognize who he is and what the word is really saying to you amen but somewhere along the line these words I'm speaking to you here today it's going catching the soul and you recognize it's that great Shepherd calling out his sheep and calling by your name the voice of God amen amen Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah amen a man sitting by the wayside begging while he was sitting there he says Lord have mercy on me and the Bible tells us Jesus stopped and laid his hands upon him and gave him his sight amen oh praise God he's passing our V here again today when Jesus came and call then things happen when Jesus comes whenever he comes things are changed when he comes to stay by God's grace Hallelujah I honestly believe he's the same yesterday today and forever for you come musicians when he calls me I will answer I'll be somewhere listening for my name Hallelujah what
