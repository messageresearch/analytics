And I believe if you've come tonight with some expectation within your heart, then the Lord will speak to you and give you something that you'll leave here tonight and you'll say, "It was good to be in the house of the Lord." Amen. Praise God. With uh this evening with us we have brother Pastor Daniel Pasos. He is all the way from uh Acra. Amen. From Ghana, Africa. Amen. Praise God.

Um and sister and sister Marsha. Praise God. Amen. Sister Marshall. Yes. And uh so he has been a wonderful host to our brothers when they go to Acra. Amen. Brother Kofi has spent time with him and his family at their home and uh he's been very hospitable and we certainly appreciate that very much. And so we want to show hospitality to you this evening, my brother, and we welcome you here in the house of the Lord. And we ask you to take the liberty uh this evening.

At least most of are familiar with me cuz it's not it's my first. It's about my third time of being here. So, I'm actually at home. Hallelujah. Amen. And I want to thank pastor Danny for giving opportunity to you know uh take the service tonight because I believe that every pastor always has a lot on his heart and mind to his church and so it's always a sacrifice for a pastor to let go of the service time to give to another pastor is a sacrifice and pastor Daniel I certainly appreciate that God richly bless you and I thank brother Simon also for the sweet transition that the Holy Ghost led this church up to. Are we thankful for the transition? Thank you for the sacrifice and for the maturity that you shown us. Pastor Simon, God richly bless you and all the sacrif you made also to follow brother Paul and and and the family to come all the way to Ghana to pick up a bride and who have to be the in-law for our brother Kofi. That was a sacrifice also. Thank you very much and I thank you for the church for the support that you gave Paul by brother Kofi and the family to help his son Paul to get a bride. Thank you all and God richly bless you all. Hallelujah. And so tonight um let's to be honest with you let me tell you the truth. I have nothing new to give you. Don't expect anything new for me. I have nothing new to give you. Jesus the same word of God I've been feeding all this year. Pastor Simon Fed this chair for many years with the word of God Daniel continue. I'm just just I'm just a liberal just going to add a little bit of it. The same food. Yeah. That I'm going to share. So don't expect anything new from me. Hallelujah. Amen. So let's pick our Bibles. Let's if you brought it, you know, let's projection help us to turn to second Peter chapter one and see what happen. Second Peter chapter one. Let's read from verse 5 to save some time. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness brotherly kindness, and to bar kindness charity. For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But he that lackth these things is blind and cannot see a far off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. Amen. Let's take a second scripture which you help me to read and that will be in the second period. Still second Peter but chapter 3 now and moving reading from verse 18. So this one uh it says but grow in grace but do what? Do what? But do what? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But grow in grace and the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever. Amen. Amen. And the last scripture, let's take it from um Hebrews 11:6. Bear without faith is impossible to please him. For he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. And may the Lord add his blessings to read of his word as you also take the comfort of your seat. God bless you. Amen. All right. So tonight have a little message I want us to share together. We want to um just echo part of the prover message on the touch of a perfect man. It's a long message but just speaking just one part of it. We look at um faith is the foundation. Want to speak on this theme. Faith is the foundation. If we call it part A of the message of start of perfect men if time watching the time the time allows us we will probably add another virtue to it which will be virtue. So let's start. um what the prophet say about it. Let's start from one. Let's go to note one. In a message of prophet man, the prophet really laid the foundation for the message and he said look and this morning let's say this evening we want to speak on a subject or teach rather if we can building the living tabernacle. But it said building the living tabernacle of the living God's dwelling place the perfect man. the living tabernacle of the living God where he dwells. Hallelujah. So the message of Sep is a great message and deep rich message for for a prophet to take his time to teach us how to build the living God, the living tabernacle where God will dwell. So I think that we are privileged to have a prophet to teach us how to build a spiritual house, a spiritual tabernacle where God can dwell. Hallelujah. So let a few of his comments that the prophet mentioned let's move on to paragraph 31. see a message that's a key reference message 62 10:14 m the prophet man 31 said now we approaching the seven seals we have judgment the seven church ages and this is a message of teaching thank you pastor I appreciate And now approach the seven. We have just made the seven churchages. And this is a message on teaching that ties the man in the man that is going to be redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus. And it's going to be in that church age, that eternal church age at the end of the seals. Hallelujah. So it it's a it has to be a very rich teaching teaching us how God is going to redeem us by the blood of the lamp and that man that's going to go into that eternal church age that's going to how it's going to be like how that person can get in that's essence of the message that he brought the statue of a perfect man hallelujah and then he kept on give a lot of comment on it. Another point he said in 65 or 62 62 rather they said look so today we are going to try to take that same key to unlock the way to become a virtuous Christian in the stature of God that and be a living tabernacle for the living God to dwell in that you and I will be the living tabernacle that the living God will dwell in &gt;&gt; but I'm going to teach you how to do that. How to build a house so we can get get to that point. Hallelujah. Here in 65 message for said what is it God is condensing to his creation. God wants to be worshiped. The word God means object of worship. And is God trying to condition his people so he can get from them what he created them for? Then he makes an outstanding statement. He never made you to be something else besides a son and daughter of God. If you have missed that or being a son of God, you have missed the mark. The Lord created you to be his son, to be his daughter. Nothing else but just that. That you be a daughter of God. You be a son of God. But if you miss that one, you miss the mark of really being a son of God and reflecting as a son of God or miss being a daughter of God reflect at the door of God because you have missed the mark. Hallelujah. That's why he's going to teach us how not to miss the mark. Hallelujah. Amen. And then for the same message, he says that know how that God is in his church. The church is now supposed to taking the place of Christ carrying on his ministry. Hallelujah. So it's going to just talk about the individual son of God, that of God. Then talk about the church as a collective body as well and what does one of the church is where we ought to be by now we should be supposed to take the place of Christ carry on Christ ministry. So all this is going to come about by the teachings that he give us out of this message of the story of a perfect man. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord. So the first principle on this type of prophet men that we need to realize note three please that the most high does not dwell in temples made with hands. So yes, we we we there's termin where God dwells and all that which is going to teach us how to say look you need to first be reminded that the living God does not dwell in temples made with hands. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. And so St. Paul talked about that in in in Acts 17 when he went to mass hills in Acts 17:2 says that then Paul stood in the midst of mass hills and said, "Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious." But as I passed by and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription to the unknown God. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worshiped, him I declare unto you. 24 God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands. Hallelujah. So St. Paul brought this truth out that the living God does not dwell in temples made with hands. Hallelujah. Steven also said it in Steven said earlier on in Acts chapter 6 chapter 7 before Paul also echoed it. So in Acts chapter 6 talking about just that's a background to um what happened to Stephen and then uh we told in Acts 67 and the word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiply in Jerusalem greatly and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith and Steven full of faith and power did great wonders and miracles among the people. Hallelujah. And by the way, just want to remind tonight the same call that was with Stephen to do great miracles and miracles is with us here right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So expect your miracle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Expect the great wonders. Hallelujah. Cuz he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; And he's here with us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's see what Stephen said in verse um let's start from verse 9 Acts chapter 7 let's go to seven and let's see what they accuse Stephen of and verse 10 and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake oh may the Lord grant us tonight the wisdom and the spirit that's in your heart hallelujah resist him such a wisdom of that he had that the the whole Gian and the Sanhindrance and all they were able to resist Stephen and that wisdom we ask that the Lord should grant unto us tonight as well in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Then there man who said we have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God. So they accusing Steven of things he haven't done but they said he has spoke blasphe against the Moses against God. And then verse 12 they said and they start the people and the elders and the scribes and came upon him and caught him and brought him to counsel and start false witnesses who said this man said not to speak but spoke words against the holy place and the law. So in reality they accused speak of four things. He spoke against Moses spoke against God speak against the holy place which was the church the tabernacle. Yeah. And they spoke against the law. Hallelujah. So after he has made his submission to them then in verse to save some time let's move up to verse um 47 or probably 46 46 okay for we have 47 in script let's reference 47 that's I I cut it short for for us so but Solomon built him a house 48 how be it the most high dwellth not in temples made with hands. Hallelujah. I said a prophet, heaven is my throne and earth is my foottool. And what house will you build me says the Lord? Or what place is the place of my rest? Had not my hand made all these things. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the principle foundation is that the most high God does not dwell in temples made with hands. and a prophet pick up this same scripture of acts 7 and echoed it in the same message we're looking at prophet man in paragraph 67 prophet talked about it said now we going to study his word Stephen said acts seven let me just read and prophet read it he started from verse 34 he read it and then read of course what we have read uh from the 47 prophet read it all and then uh so let me know the prophets were not words that prophet said he said my sermon build my house be the most high do I not in temple with hence as said the prophet heaven is my throne and earth my foot what has built me said the lord or what is the place of rest then paragraph 68 prophet asked on this is that now tabernacle is of course a place where we go to rest so remember that tabernacle is a place where we go to rest get freshness and so forth like resting from and so forth. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. 69 said, "But what is tabernacle now?" A body. God taken in a body. So a tabernacle is a body. God tabernacle in a body. Hallelujah. Amen. So now the foundation leader, God doesn't dwell in a temp with hands. So what is next? Now if he doesn't dwell in a temple made with hands then he has to have a place to dwell. He has to build a house. And father tells us in the message paragraph 135 that's slide six. Now building a house you just put up your uprise and everything else but the wood and some of these carpenters and contractors here could tell us how you build your house. See, but I'm going to tell you how to build your spiritual house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where God can dwell. He wants to dwell in you. He wants to make you like himself. He wants to be reflected or reflecting rather his being. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's an outstanding statement. Paul said God wants to dwell in you. &gt;&gt; He wants to dwell in me. Almighty God &gt;&gt; wants to dwell in you. What a privilege to have that the God of creation wants to dwell in you. Hallelujah. We got to take advantage of that that the almighty God dwell in us. He said Paul said he wants to dwell in you. He wants to dwell in me. He wants us to reflect his being &gt;&gt; that you as I sit down, you reflect the being of God. &gt;&gt; That as I stand here, I need to reflect the being of God. That's God's mind. The Bible said that this is his this is God's mind. That's what God wants to do. He wants to reflect himself in you and in me. Hallelujah. But to do that then to do that he has to build a spiritual house that he can dwell in that he can reflect himself in that spiritual house. Hallelujah. Amen. But how does it do it? So went on tell us about how it does it. He said in the old time uh the gold miners when they pick up the gold when they get up door comes with a lot of dust and all that. So they have to beat it, heat it by by fire, you know, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, heat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it until finally they get the gold and they can see themselves reflected in the gold. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Same thing. God picks you up from the mar clay. Yeah. And then he beats you by his word. He beats you by his word. And then sometime you think, oh, but who want to tell the preacher my story? Then the preacher tell my story. Nobody told the preacher. It is God just want to beat you by his word and bring conviction to your heart that you repent and that you know that he's the living God. He knows all your thoughts and all your heart and all all your challenges. He knows it. &gt;&gt; God beating his people by his word that he can make them himself be able to reflect him. Hallelujah. Just as a gold miner beats the gold beats it out until he can see himself fling in it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's part of God's process of building his spiritual house that he can dwell in. Hallelujah. Amen. So if you ever came to church and you had a preacher saying something that concerns you, it's not because anyone have told him that. Nobody want to tell you report to to the to the pastor. The Holy Ghost knows you. God knows you. And the Holy Ghost want to correct you. God want to teach you. The ghost want direct you. And so the anointing of God comes to the pastor and preaches and teaches everything that nobody that going to report you. Nobody reported you. It is still part of God's process of you beating himself, beating all the death out of you and make able to reflect himself in you. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. So if want to build a tabernacle then certainly there must be a foundation to that without foundation I mean our contractors would tell us said that us want to build a house this building has a foundation upon all this is standing and so there has to be a foundation if God wants to build a house there has to be a foundation so what the prophets say let's turn to let's go uh seven yeah just come skip the time to skip some of uh slides. Let's go to uh slide seven. Building goes through tabernacle begins with a foundation of faith. Hallelujah. Amen. Next slide. Notice the voice speaking now paragraph 102 of the same message the start of prophet man 62 10:14 m. Notice you must be born again. And when you are born again, you can't be born again without having faith. Hallelujah. You can't be born again without having faith. But you must be born again. That is right. So you see on my chart here, I don't have the chart here, but I'm sure you have an idea where the chart because our ministers have taught it time and again. So you know that chart. Hallelujah. He said, I got the very foundation. Faith is the foundation of all of it. Hallelujah. And in reality, that's why you speak on this subset of the message. Yeah. The subtitle like I told earlier on faith is the foundation. And that's said to to build the spiritual house of God. Paul said that faith is the foundation. It's the foundation of it all. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Faith is the found for without faith is impossible to please God. He that cometh to God must believe that he is and is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him. Faith is a foundation. Hallelujah. And when you are kept of the Bible, when you are scared of the word being right, test might as well stay back until first you believe it. Hallelujah. Faith is the foundation or the spiritual house that God wants to build to dwell in. Hallelujah. say that you must must be born again. In other words, if you are not born again, you have not started the the building at all. You've not started cuz you can't start a building without foundation. You want to start a building build this house. You have to have a foundation that you really started and but you have to be born again. And to be born again, you need faith to be able to be born again. And when you're born again, you have the faith for your foundation. Said you have just started. Hallelujah. You have just begun when you are born again. Praise the Lord. So what is faith will be a natural question to ask. What is faith? If faith the foundation then what is faith? If a prophet taught us what faith is in the next slide eight he said in the message another one at the end time 53 the prophet asked the same question. What is faith? Hallelujah. What is faith? Faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be. Faith is a revelation of the will of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What is faith? Faith is a revelation of the will of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you need this revelation to be born again. And when you are born again, you have this revelation. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. And then in the message faith is a substance uh part of 19 C says my scripture lesson tonight said faith the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen. See it's a substance. It's something direct something that you really have. Not something that you imagine or something that you just think you will have but it's something direct positive act that you have. You see what I mean? So faith is a substance. Faith is not an imagination. Faith is a revelation of the will of God. Hallelujah. That you get and when you get it, nobody can take that away from you. Hallelujah. No devil, nobody else can take it from you cuz it's a revelation &gt;&gt; of the will of God for you. Once you get it, nobody can take it from you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And that's the foundation that you must have. Hallelujah. For for foundation of a spiritual house that God wants to build that's really forever for for for a foundation. Hallelujah. So if faith is so important to be the the the foundation then the question that we answer what are some of the characteristics of faith because faith has it own characteristics whether for you to see whether you really have faith or you don't have it is a character that will determine whether you have it or you don't have it. So let's take a few of the characters of faith first. How do you get faith is a question that also answered faith cometh by hearing? Hearing what? The word of God. Hallelujah. So that's in in the verse perseverance. A prophet taught us that in paragraph 37 said, "And faith cometh by hearing." Hearing what? The word of God. And that's Romans 10:17. Therefore, if this be the word of God, and it is, what it teaches, we can rest upon it. God cannot change. God must forever remain God. His word must be just as true in this age as it was in any age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Faith comes by hearing. And the word of God can be trusted, can be relied upon. Hallelujah. If you hear it, please rely, believe it, rely upon it because it will do exactly what it say it it sent out to do. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Architects of faith that but without faith it is impossible to please God. And that's Hebrews 11:6 say without faith is about to please him. For he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. Hallelujah. He that cometh to God must have faith in God that God is God. &gt;&gt; God is. &gt;&gt; He said he must he is. &gt;&gt; He is what he a lot of St. Paul actually stopped short of trying to bring out characteris because honestly if he wanted to p that he wouldn't have finished writing the book of Hebrews. Hallelujah. Because what God is is deep and great. Hallelujah. So we just have to just pick just maybe three of that talk about three of that. You you must believe that he is he is what? He is God. &gt;&gt; If you come to God that further he is God. and and and and and sometimes people learn it the hard way that God is God. If you remember uh the ten commandments, yeah, which recommended for us to watch in the in in in the movie which the prophet really told us about what happened. Don't forget also that a prophet was a prophet and so he's able to see things that you do not see. The Lord to sins and scenarios which he to see to see. So sometime when make comments don't take it for granted. Yeah. In in in in the ten commandments movie a a pharaoh Ramsey's struggle all the struggle that he was struggling with Moses when Moses sent the message the word of the Lord that look the Lord have sent me said let my people go. When he was walking where you coming from I come from the kingdom of God. what for is what your message let my people go. And then he resisted that message that Moses brought from God. Let my people go. So all the the the plagues that were coming, it came as a result of the resistance of the word of God and the word of God. He was resisting, resisting, resisting, resisting. Finally, he let him go. And then he said he thought look we made a mistake. We should have let him go. But the wife was teasing him. The wife teased him so much he go and said no I have to go get these guys. So he organized I mean to chase Israel. Yeah. And then he chased them and he got to said when and then he he he he sat on his horse his chariot and he said ah the God of Moses is a poor general. How can he lead his people into this trap? Lead them into a place where there's a mant on the left, a man on the right, and the sea before them and have no place to go. And we are we have come with chariots. He said the god was is a poor general. That's his comment. Okay, but that wasn't the end of story. Eventually, we know the story. The Lord opened the Red Sea for his people, not for the Egyptians. Don't forget that. God didn't open the way for the Egyptian. He opened the recipe for his people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then the family of God went through the the sea and then just about around probably midway or getting to end of it, the Egyptians are look, they have to chase them in the in the in the in the sea. And I remember if you look at the film, if you watch the film, Yeah. One of his commanders said, "No, no, Pharaoh, king, we don't have to go." And he said, "No, just he said, "No, I don't think we have to go. Look at this. It's amazing. So, don't let us go." He said, "No, go." And he commanded them to go. And then he went and then what happened? You see, the God that we serve is a real God. &gt;&gt; That's why he must know he is. &gt;&gt; He is God. the things that God wants to do for you, you have no idea. &gt;&gt; Your little brains, our little brains usually minimizes, you know, what God can do for us. I tell you the truth. Let me give you a test to continue to to practice the point that I'm making. You see how this surgery here is a cut here is actually a surgery that I had in 2011. To cut a long story short, five years down the line when I started ministry in 2016, uh it's about four months down the line, I could feel a pain when I preaching and it's you feel a pain of a sharp something, you know, breaking pricking the the the flesh, breaking the the the the jaw right there. So I went to the hospital and then the doctor said do we go taking the X-ray I went for the X-rays brought it show to the light said what is this what is this I haven't seen some before apparently the metal yeah the titanium that have been fixed here to support my jaw was broken how it got broke no one knows But clearly it's in a ring form that the ring is here. It's been it's still there. It's still there on my jaw. It's been it's been fixed here is there. But it was broken. He said, "I haven't seen some of this before in all my career. I haven't seen this." And I know for a fact that the method is the best. So he said, "Daniel, you know what? Um, you go and give me time to think through because I don't know what to do for you." And they said you took a lot of hours to get this thing done for me. So I went home went home n by my bed. I said Lord your servant at the rich hospital Dr. Max J. He says that he doesn't know what to do for me. I know how to fix this for me. So father I pray that you please fix it for me. Hallelujah. You fix it for me. That was my prayer. Two weeks after then I became conscious that oh for a week I have not felt the pain. Oh so the after done is already and I I didn't even realize that it stopped. The preaching has stopped. My wife said by the way I came with my wife Sella. Yeah that's my wife. I came with her. Hallelujah. Yeah. She called I tell her our standing lady. Yeah. By the grace of God, she said, "Pick go to the hospital." I said, "I'm not going to go." He said, "No, go." I said, "Look, let me tell you the truth." That once I was blind, but now I see. &gt;&gt; If you are blind and you now see, do you need to see the the optician? Do you think you really have to see optician for seeing? You were blind. You were once blind and now you can't see. Do you have to go and see optician? What for? I said once I had a pain but now there's no pain. No need for me to see the the dentist. &gt;&gt; It's gone. So I didn't go. That was 2016. Then another five years after that, that's 2011, which is 10 years after the surgery now. I one day I found out there was a fluid coming out of where one of screws was cured. Yeah, there's a flu coming and it was very bad scented. Yeah. So I called my niece to a doctor in the UK and he said I should go and see a doctor and then he actually prescribed me to take some antibiotics. So I bought it and I start taking it and then I went to see a doctor. When I went he wasn't in he was in a theater but I met his goal doctors and they said okay let's let me examine. So I went to lie on the table and then um one of the doctor he examined me put everything there he said but your jaw is fine everything there is fine then the next doctor came al so everything's fine there said I thought your conservative is fine but you go and come early tomorrow morning come early because otherwise you'll miss out our boss but you going to get tomorrow too I said okay thank you doctors so I went home then the following day I name went very early to the hospital. Then I met the doctor. They said, "Oh yes, I was told that you were here yesterday." I said, "Yes." I said, "Okay, go and take a X-ray." For they have an X-ray in the hospital. Earlier I want have to go to another bigger hospital to refer us to go. But now they have the X-ray right there in the hospital. So I went to the X-ray room. I met a technician. Then I give a little history of what it told us. So he took the X-ray and then right on the screen you could see that the metal was all intact. Everything was intact. I said but everything's intact. &gt;&gt; I said so I I looked at said I said can I take a shot of say yes do that. So I took a shot of that and then when I left the X-ray room and I got to the consulting room where doctor was here he was shouting this is a miracle. This is a miracle. Ah this this had to be God. This is a miracle. There has to be God. Why? Because he knew very well and he must well that the metal was broken 5 years ago but now the metal is intact. entered. Remember, not bone. &gt;&gt; It wasn't bone that was broken. It was metal. &gt;&gt; Titanium that was broken. 2016, 21, it was interface nothing. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? But almighty God, we say, "Brother, he that cometh God, he is &gt;&gt; he's God." back to where we were in Exodus where Pharaoh decided to chase his people. So what happened? So in my story, the Lord became my dentist. Don't forget that. He became my dentist to fix the my my my job for me. &gt;&gt; And that's why he is he is everything to us. &gt;&gt; He's everything to us. &gt;&gt; In time of need, he he will show himself as what ought to be for you. In the story of of Moses in the story so they went rescy and decide become a vulcanizer. How many know vulcanizers the the the the technicians who work with ties? Yeah. If you have a lorry tie you go they remove the t that's vanizer. The lord became a v organizer and the chariots of the Egyptians that decided removing the ties one by one. Removing the ties the chariots of the ties. They run. By the time they realize they were all swimming in the Red Sea. Hallelujah. And then the Rammeses goes back to the palace, goes home, met the wife before he left the palace to go chase Israel. They said, "I'm going I and I'll kill I'll come. When I come, I'll kill you." That's why he told the wife, I'm going to kill you. Kill the nefari. He said, "Before but before I come, make sure you kill Moses first and bring his blood and come and kill me. So after all that he he came back now stood there in the palace. He he first he drew the sword to kill Neferti. He said before you kill me show me the blood of Moses. Show me his blood. Then his hands got weak and the software from his hands. And then hands said his God is God. All the resistant are resistance just to say that Moses God is God and that was the problem by the end the L the go that God is God &gt;&gt; and you might believe that God is God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And what you believe him for is what he does for you. If you believe him to be a dentist, he will work do the work for dentist for you. Believe the gynecologist work for you. when they are filled I'm not say don't we should contact them as well but where join them he does that for you hallelujah God is God hallelujah he's l Elohim the self-existing one yeah but now as a certain point he decided to be to make himself known to us and the course of history I had a friend call Abraham our father and when he called him Abraham in um uh uh chapter 17 of of of Genesis. So, and when Abraham was 90 years old at nine, the Lord appeared to Abraham and said to him, I am the Lord. I am the Almighty God. Walk before me and be thou perfect. Hallelujah. Walk before me and be thou perfect. Hallelujah. So that's how reveal himself to to to to our father Abraham and then almighty God like we know Paul told us that it means El Shadai the breasted one the God who has double breast the breasted one like a mother to feed his children and tonight he wants us to us to feed on him remember that he's he's a blessed one all that we need he's here to give Draw your strength from me. I'm the strength giver. El Shai. Remember, he's a strength giver. In your weakness, in time of weakness, remember the Lord is a strength giver. &gt;&gt; He's El Shai. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The strength giver, the almighty God. Hallelujah. And then when he appeared unto Moses in Exodus, he reveals himself to Moses in another way. And it's according chapter 6. Let's read that quickly. Then the Lord said to Moses, "Now shall say what I will do to Pharaoh. For with a strong hand shall he let him go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land." And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord. I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty. But by my name Jehovah, was I not known to them. Abraham didn't know that God's name is called Jehovah. God did not reveal it to him. He didn't reveal it to Abraham. He didn't reveal it to Isaac. He didn't reveal to Jacob. He didn't reveal to Levi to Amram. He didn't reveal to all of them said by my name Jehovah. I he don't reveal it to them. Why did he even himself name Moses? Because Jehovah means the God who lives with his family. And God's family was locked up in Egypt. So he's going to send Moses to go and lead and bring his family out of Egypt. So remember he's Jehovah. He's a God who lives his family. God lives with you with your family. He's a God who lives his family. That's why he's called Jehovah. Hallelujah. Amen. So continue with the faith. What is faith? We've told us a revelation of the will of God. But why should they have faith? Move on the next diet loving a please woman. Faith leads to the path of obedience. Hallelujah. No, please just go to Yes. Yes. No, please go back for me. Stay with that where you were 10. Let's talk about that. In a message f prophet men 8 said faith does the rest. And we need to understand why prophet says so. one said, "And now faith does the rest of it." Faith does the rest. So you must have faith for a foundation. All Christianity. All you are, all you will ever be is based upon faith in the word. with us quoting that you must have faith for a foundation. All Christianity, all you are, all you will ever be is based upon faith in the word. That's the reason I believe the word. So we must believe the word because your present and your future is still based on faith. your present as a Christian and your future as a Christian is based on believing in the word of God. Having faith in the word that's what it is brothers and sisters and we have to have faith in God's word because that's what it is. Faith does the rest of faith does the rest of it. Get the faith as your foundation. Faith will do the rest for you. Hallelujah. Amen. Faith leads to the path of obedience. If you have faith and you don't obey God's word, I'm sorry for you. You really don't have faith because faith leads to a part of obedience. That's why prophet told us in the message why Christ speak 173 said faith led Moses to the path of obedience. Hallelujah. Faith leads to the path of obedience. If you have faith, you obey God's word. That's what it is. That's what it is. If you have faith in God's word, you obey it. The fact that you are disobeying God means that don't have it. The faith, if you fa, you obey it. So, Moses have faith in God's word. When the Lord met her back out of the desert and said look introduce him to him and said look I have not even I to your fathers are Jehovah but I'm tell Moses trust me believe it I'm Jehovah I'm sending you to Egypt to go and people out Moses believed in this god and I kind of and so Moses went to Egypt in obedience to God's command for him because he had faith in what God had said so faith led Moses to the path of obedience Hallelujah. Now notice what said this is a young pharaoh. There's young Moses. Both of them with opportunity. Moses in the report of a people encountered it greater pleasure than all Egypt. And he led and he led by faith. He followed what faith said in the word and it led him to the path of obedience. So faith will lead you to the path of obedience. And finally, glory, immortal, never to die in the presence of God. Hallelujah. So that's what faith does. Faith leads us into the path of obedience. Let's see what faith did to our father Abraham too. Faith in the word led to the path of obedience our father Abraham. So remember in the mind story of Abraham in Genesis 22 when the Lord came to him said now it came to pass after these things that God tested Abraham and said Abraham and said here I am and he said take not your son your your only son Isaac whom you love and go to the land of Moriah and there as a burnt offering as on one of the mountains which I of which I shall tell you. So Abraham rose early in the morning and saw his donkey and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and he split the wood for the bent o offering and arose and went to a place of which God had told him. Now the question is why do you think Abraham woke up early in the morning and called two of his servants and Isaac let's go and do the firewood let's go because Abraham had faith in what God have told him he had faith in God faith in God's word and therefore it led him to obedience obedience so calling his son awake the Bible say early in the morning but before The son actually said the son son rose guys let's go because that was faith that he had in this god that spoke to him and therefore it led him to obedience to what god have said that's what faith does if you believe God's word you obey it faith leads to the path of obedience hallelujah amen praise the lord let's keep that go to 12 now the context of faith faith in the word knows no fear. Hallelujah. So when Moses got to Egypt you know and this here is Pharaoh and Egypt was a great you know it was the greatest nation in the world at the time. But did did Moses fear a Pharaoh? Not at all. So in the mercy why Christ paragraph 176 said Moses with his faith did not did did never did fear Pharaoh. Moses with his faith that he have in God he never feared Pharaoh because faith in God's word would drive away fear. In fact the two do not live together. Faith and and and and and and fear they don't live together. They don't not at all. They are not twins. They are not neighbors. They don't live together. They're not friends. They don't live together. It's either faith or fear. But if you have faith, you don't fear. It drives away fear from you. Hallelujah. You don't fear what the devil can do because the God who is in you is bigger and greater than the world the devil that's in the world. &gt;&gt; That's why there's no cause for you to fear. Have faith in God. Believe him and cast away all your fears. The God is in you is greater than the devil that's in the world. Have faith in God. Hallelujah. So fear faith mostly did not have you know fear Pharaoh and didn't in 177 there's no fear in faith. That's a speaking. There is no fear in faith. Faith knows about faith. Faith as I always said is got great big muscles and hairs on the chest. Hallelujah. That's what faith is. Faith has got big muscles. Yeah. And hairs on the chest. 179. It said, "Notice Moses never feared Pharaoh after God have beenated his call. When Moses believe he was called for that, but when God told him him up there, it so and come down and show before Pharaoh and all the rest of them that he was sent to do it." Moses never was scared of Pharaoh. If you have faith, you're not scared of Pharaoh. You're not scared of any any man. Have faith in God. Hallelujah. Faith knows no fear. Oh, let's I didn't my time is going, but let's talk about this one. The other example of Shadrach, me. You know, faith in the word knows no fear. Because remember Moses had earlier on given a commandment in Exodus chapter 20. Uh verse three says, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shall not make unto me any given image or likeness of anything that is heaven above or that is in the earth beneath and that is in the earth and and in the water and earth." Five, thou shall not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them. For I I am for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God. Hallelujah. Moses wrote this story way back in Exodus hundreds of years after here comes three young Hebrew children whilst they were in exile and the king makes you know an image everybody should bow remember faith in God's word knows no fear so the king came and said guys if if if you would just I let them play the flute and if you just bow a little that should be fine with me I all accusations that we accused of. I will just write it off. I will just let it go. I pardon you of that. So, and the and the guy said, "Look, King, oh king, we just want to tell you this. Our God is able to deliver us from your your fire anyway, but even if he doesn't do that, we want to tell you to your face. We shall not bow today. We shall not bow tomorrow." He said he said he get he get over he seven times thinking by saying that get over here seven times is to put fear in them. Yeah. Because why you hit it seven times. He said he seven times but I think saying that seven will put fear in the people they have faith in God's word and therefore they have no fear because faith in God and his word knows no fear. So no matter how the the king wanted to put fear in there, they did no fear. &gt;&gt; Eventually they were cast into the fire and then the king left. He said and I'm sure when they said you foolish boys, you will see who is who. So he left went took his lunch and then came back. So when he came back, it's recorded in in excel of Daniel chapter 3. Let's read a little bit more. Let's go. Um let's get scripture for it in Daniel chapter 3. So he came back. Let's let's let's start from uh let's start from verse 22. Next slide. I've just I'm trying to save my time. So I'm move on to the next. I think we are in 12 13B. Go to 13B for me. We have scripture there. I put some scripture down. Yeah. There was a book full of full of full of fury and and and form of and for his visage was was changed against the three men. There was a commanded that they should they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was heeded. So just go down and then 25 I want to say my time. So 24 let's start on 24 now what it says there. Then Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and rose up in haste and spake and said unto his counselors, "Did not we cast three men bound in the midst of the ferry?" He's asking his counselors, "Did you not bound three people in the ferry?" And the counelor said, "Oh, king, your eyesight is perfect. Your memory is right. We actually bound three people. You're absolutely right, king." And the king said, they answered and said the king, "True, oh king." He said, I said, "Lo, I see four men lose." Oh, three men bound, four men lose. Hallelujah. He said, "Did you not say, did you not cast three men bound?" That was his memory. They said, "Ke, you are right. Your memory is right. It was three men bound." But I said, "No, but I see four men lose." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what our Lord can do. No matter what the devil tries to do to us, we have a God who is able to lose us from everything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember loose. So have faith in God. Don't fear. Cast away all fears. Hallelujah. Paul said faith has no reason. Faith has no reason. And I want to just run very quickly now because we have barely time to close. I'm not going to give you the quotations I probably give you but not me not read it. And the message start 186 prophet said faith has no reasoning. Hallelujah. And then another message with prophet preaching the message perseverance 63 0113e that faith has no hindrance. So don't forget that faith has no reason. Faith has no hindrance. Hallelujah. And I give example of the great senician woman. She had a lot of hindrances but her faith knew no hindrance because faith knows no hindrance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Faith knows no defeat. So, so prophet talked about in the same message perseverance talk about the same Greek reference sufficient woman that her faith knows no defeat because faith knows no defeat. Hallelujah. That's part of characters of faith. Faith knows no shock. Hallelujah. Don't forget that faith knows no shock because the Greek was was supposed to be shocked. He has heard of Jesus and what he can do. He has trusted him and traveled all the way to get to Jesus. Remember the disciples tried to restrain him. Oh no, you don't have to see me. Oh Jesus, get this woman. I was shouting. B was shout no. He he was able to push his way through until he caught attention of Jesus and he said, "Oh, but woman, I also even sent to you. You you your tribe, your relations, your people are just dogs." Said that you should have been shocked by that. Is is that how you are? with all the good I had about you with Jesus and you tell me that I was not sent to you dogs said that faith knows no shock &gt;&gt; he wasn't shocked by that because faith knows no defeat hallelujah &gt;&gt; he persisted faith to make you persist and he got what he looking for he got healing for a daughter hallelujah faith knows no shock faith is a victory that overcomes every curse of the devil. Hallelujah. I like this one. 19. That's where we are now. Faith is our victory. It's a message from page 58 104 paragraph 64. And faith is a victory that overcomes every curse of the devil. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Faith is a victory that overcomes every curse of the devil. You must have faith in God. Hallelujah. Faith is a conqueror. Proverb 52. Next slide. Faith is a conqueror. Faith is an overcomer. It isn't just a peacemaker. It overcomes. Faith is a victory that overcomes the world. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. And from what went on again said faith is a victory. Pro 59. And let's read slide 21. Probably we have to close on that. It's now 8:45. Our time is up. So let's look at the read last one. Faith is a victory over death in paragraph 59. It reads, "Did not I tell you not to doubt?" He said to Gyros that night and on that day or that day, if you only believe, you can see the glory of God. Hallelujah. And in the church, if you only believe, you will see the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Faith overcomes death. Faith is the victory over death. &gt;&gt; Faith is the victory over sin. &gt;&gt; Faith is the victory over sickness. Faith the victory over worry. &gt;&gt; Faith the victory over frustrations. Faith the victory over the world. &gt;&gt; Faith overcomes every curse of the devil. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Our time is up. Let me outside. Let's sing a song. Let's sing one song and then we can pray cuz our time is up. Musicians, please come over and help us with this. Do you have this song? Come Jesus come. Do you have that in the in the in our database?
