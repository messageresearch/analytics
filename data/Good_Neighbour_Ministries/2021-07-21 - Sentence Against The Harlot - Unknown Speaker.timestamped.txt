[0:14] good
[0:14] wednesday evening my good friends
[0:18] may the lord richly bless you
[0:22] and may he take praise
[0:25] honor and glory over this entire
[0:30] service let us
[0:33] turn our attention to the word of god
[0:38] with thankful and grateful hearts
[0:42] that he hath given himself to
[0:46] die for us to be our substitute
[0:50] so that he may cause his word to become
[0:54] so
[0:55] real to us that we may understand
[1:00] what it is that he has done
[1:03] is doing and will do
[1:07] at the time of the consummation of the
[1:10] ages
[1:12] may god bless us all welcome
[1:15] into his divine presence as the word of
[1:18] god
[1:19] goes forth receive it into your heart
[1:23] and may that word of god live
[1:26] forevermore
[1:29] last wednesday we
[1:32] spoke on or about
[1:37] the harlot jezebel
[1:41] and how she seduced
[1:45] the servants of god to commit
[1:49] fornication fornication of course
[1:53] worship of id idols or idolatry
[1:58] seducing enticing
[2:01] and even forcing some
[2:05] to enter into the worship of idols
[2:09] and for this we read the scriptures
[2:15] revelation 2 reading from verse 20
[2:20] notwithstanding i have a few
[2:23] things against thee because
[2:27] thou sufferest that
[2:30] woman jezebel which
[2:33] call it herself a prophetess
[2:37] to teach and to seduce
[2:42] my servants to commit
[2:45] fornication and to eat
[2:49] things sacrificed onto idols
[2:54] and i gave her space
[2:57] to repent of her fornication
[3:02] and she repented not
[3:06] behold i will cast her
[3:09] into a bed and
[3:12] them that commit adultery with her
[3:16] into great tribulation
[3:20] except they repent of their deeds
[3:24] and i will kill her children with death
[3:28] and all the churches shall know that
[3:31] i am he who search at the reins and
[3:35] hearts and i will give unto
[3:39] every man every one of you
[3:42] according to your works
[3:46] praise our god our righteous father
[3:50] we thank you for the leadership
[3:54] of your word may your great holy spirit
[4:00] now move upon the waters
[4:04] father move upon
[4:07] our hearts and let your word
[4:11] come to life so let it be
[4:15] in the name of our lord jesus christ
[4:18] amen and amen praise
[4:21] god hallelujah this
[4:26] topic of course will be
[4:30] sentence against
[4:34] the harlot sentence
[4:37] against the harlot
[4:41] now of course this woman
[4:45] that woman jezebel
[4:50] this church a woman of course
[4:54] represents the church
[4:58] this unfaithful unrighteous
[5:01] unclean adulterous
[5:04] woman according to the word of god
[5:08] god is saying i will
[5:12] cast her into a bed
[5:15] and them that commit
[5:18] adultery with her
[5:22] into great tribulation we
[5:25] are now god is showing to us
[5:29] that this woman will do these
[5:32] unrighteous unclean acts
[5:36] but at the end of it all
[5:40] at the end of his patience
[5:44] god is saying i will arrest her
[5:49] i will stop her in her tracks
[5:52] right now she seems as if she's just
[5:55] going along
[5:56] having her merry way
[5:59] and no one seems to be
[6:02] able to stop her
[6:06] or arrest her a bring her to her senses
[6:10] of what she is doing but god is saying
[6:14] but i i
[6:17] will cast her into a bed
[6:21] i will arrest her
[6:25] just imagine this evil woman
[6:30] this unclean red
[6:34] light district person
[6:37] arrested by god
[6:41] and brought to the high courts
[6:46] of the universe that she might not tried
[6:51] for the evils that she has done
[6:54] the sins she has committed
[6:58] the wickedness that she has encouraged
[7:03] all my friends what
[7:06] what a picture to see this woman
[7:11] in her scarlet robes
[7:14] in the beauty of the world
[7:18] the world's style of beauty
[7:21] haughtiness dignified
[7:24] pride and arrogance but
[7:28] suddenly she is handcuffed by the holy
[7:31] ghost
[7:32] she's arrested by the angels of god
[7:36] she is brought before the high courts
[7:39] of the universe amen
[7:42] and now evidence is taken against her
[7:48] and sentence is passed by the
[7:52] white haired judge of revelation
[7:56] chapter one here he stands the
[8:00] mighty god standing there
[8:04] and passing sentence upon this
[8:07] filthy harlot church
[8:11] that commits herself to universal crimes
[8:17] she's arrested and she's arrested
[8:22] for her own personal
[8:25] nature of harlotry
[8:29] she's drawn to it she's drawn
[8:33] like a vulture to rotten
[8:36] carcass she is drawn
[8:39] to harlotry she cannot stay
[8:43] at home within the word she cannot stay
[8:48] within the confines of the scriptures
[8:52] but she must go out and commit her
[8:55] crimes because it is her
[8:58] nature and her desire to be a harlot
[9:02] and because of this god
[9:05] promised in his word that he will
[9:08] judge her and sentence her
[9:12] because of this she is not only
[9:15] sentenced because of that
[9:18] but the bible calls her the
[9:22] mother of heartless
[9:25] amen the mother
[9:28] of harlots think of it
[9:32] this woman has children
[9:35] the scripture said i will kill her
[9:38] children
[9:39] with death this harlot
[9:42] has children and
[9:46] god is saying sentence is passed against
[9:50] her
[9:52] for being the mother of harlots
[9:56] what is the sentence for not just
[9:59] bringing forth harlots
[10:01] but encouraging her daughters
[10:04] and her children into the same
[10:08] system and organization
[10:11] and pattern of harlotry
[10:15] that way my friends god
[10:18] passes sentence against her
[10:22] because of her encouragement
[10:26] seduction and enticements
[10:29] an example to her children
[10:33] and drawing them into this
[10:36] same pattern of her
[10:40] harlotry now you must remember
[10:45] we say today uh
[10:49] uh i'm remembering now of some person
[10:53] in los angeles california
[10:57] that was arrested and
[11:00] brought before the courts for
[11:03] she was a madame
[11:07] that influenced young women
[11:11] beautiful girls brought them in
[11:14] and brought them and
[11:18] appeared them along with rich men
[11:23] whoever will pay the price
[11:27] now she was called a madame
[11:30] but the bible uses the ancient term
[11:34] the mother of harlots
[11:37] in other words this mother of harlots
[11:41] had a house of our harlotry
[11:44] she had a body house that she
[11:47] kept and stuffed it with a stable
[11:52] of using her own children
[11:56] her own daughters that is
[11:59] an a crime beside your own
[12:03] harmony you're involving your children
[12:07] in the tree also and thus you are called
[12:11] the mother of harlots so she is
[12:14] judged by god for her own harlotry
[12:19] she is judged by god for her
[12:22] encouragement
[12:24] to her children into harlotry
[12:28] amen yes sir this mother
[12:32] of harlots certainly
[12:35] turning them into harlots
[12:39] by encouraging them to do what to
[12:42] denominate
[12:45] or to organize themselves
[12:48] like she organized herself
[12:51] and was able to capture the religious
[12:54] world
[12:55] as rome conquered and captured
[13:00] the then known world
[13:04] by military power and force
[13:08] and a psychology of divide
[13:11] and conquer so she applies that
[13:15] to the spiritual and religious
[13:18] world and she has been
[13:22] successful at it and so she
[13:25] passes this ancient
[13:28] wisdom down to her children
[13:32] and encourages them to use the same
[13:35] blueprint
[13:36] the same pattern and use it
[13:40] you may change the name of it you may
[13:43] give it another label but it remains the
[13:47] same
[13:48] pattern of organization of
[13:51] system and apply it
[13:54] and you'll be able to make lots of money
[13:58] you'll be able to amass lots of
[14:02] wealth right and that
[14:05] also is the path to earthly
[14:08] power she encouraged her children
[14:12] to do this and by doing that
[14:15] by becoming a denomination or to
[14:17] denominate
[14:19] you will gain popularity you will
[14:22] gain worldly respectability
[14:26] despite your harlotry if
[14:29] you follow this pattern that you're
[14:32] being given
[14:33] amen and so
[14:37] she encouraged her daughters
[14:40] into this pattern of organizational
[14:44] system and denomination
[14:48] and she caused them to join themselves
[14:53] to denomination so
[14:56] that they may not be just a nameless
[14:59] group
[15:00] an unrecognized group
[15:04] but that they will have a name
[15:07] under which they can find
[15:11] security religious security
[15:15] as lots of women these
[15:18] will seek a form of what is called
[15:21] a covering a security
[15:24] the protection and so to get
[15:28] protection they enter into denomination
[15:32] and they enter under that covering
[15:36] oh messing numbers
[15:39] and in numbers they believe there
[15:42] is strength and by having
[15:45] a name right and
[15:49] name a denominational name they believe
[15:52] it's the
[15:53] pastor to instant respectability
[15:58] they did not achieve it and not
[15:59] accomplish it by themselves
[16:01] but they entered into a denomination
[16:05] to get protection to get wealth money
[16:09] fame power popularity
[16:12] my friends think about it
[16:15] and recognize what god is saying
[16:20] she is the mother of harlots because she
[16:24] is the first
[16:25] organized church on the face of the
[16:29] earth
[16:30] the mother of organized
[16:34] religion the mother
[16:37] of all the various organizational
[16:41] systems that may come out
[16:45] from the minds of men
[16:49] here it is my friends and the first one
[16:52] to break out as we know
[16:55] was martin luther or the lutherans
[16:59] the lutherans broke away but
[17:02] history tells us that did not completely
[17:06] break away they had a part of the word
[17:10] and so uh luther and the lutherans
[17:13] continue with their candles
[17:15] continued with certain forms of catholic
[17:19] warship
[17:20] and they continued on though they had a
[17:23] part
[17:24] of the word but they were the first to
[17:27] break away
[17:28] but they continued some of that
[17:31] original pattern out from them later
[17:35] came the methodists
[17:38] and the methodists themselves went a
[17:40] little further
[17:42] but they maintained or retained
[17:47] many of the all practices
[17:50] patterns and ways
[17:53] of worship and organizing
[17:58] of themselves by certain patterns
[18:02] so the methodists also
[18:06] came to that then out of the methodists
[18:11] came the protestants of course i can't
[18:14] outline
[18:15] all the various groups because from the
[18:17] lutherans came out
[18:19] a whole bunch of various groups
[18:22] and out of the methodist came out
[18:24] another set of various
[18:27] denominational groups and we go on that
[18:30] way
[18:31] and now narrower to our time
[18:34] out of the methodists came the
[18:36] pentecostals
[18:38] of this day and of this hour and
[18:41] out of them came out many organized
[18:44] groups
[18:45] that went out at this particular
[18:48] time amen yes sir
[18:51] and one after the other amen praise
[18:56] god and organize themselves
[19:00] hallelujah but i want you to thank god
[19:04] the it's the word has gone through its
[19:06] cycle
[19:08] and the seed that was planted
[19:12] has come back to seed again
[19:15] after being planted in the ground
[19:18] and now there will not be
[19:23] an organization that will make it to the
[19:27] rapture
[19:28] but it will be the seed life of
[19:31] god in bright form that will be taken
[19:35] in a rapture according to god's word
[19:38] amen this woman
[19:42] stands before the great judge
[19:45] of the universe
[19:48] her case is being tried
[19:53] the judge of course
[19:56] is the word of god and as you
[20:00] know we will all be judged
[20:03] by the word of god
[20:06] no church will be judged
[20:10] by any other church's doctrine
[20:13] or teaching we will not be judged
[20:17] by any church and sickly holes
[20:21] bulls or whatever they want to
[20:25] propound so it may sound
[20:28] good in our heirs we will not be judged
[20:31] by that
[20:33] but we know from our bible
[20:37] god has said the world
[20:40] will be judged by the word of god
[20:45] so the word of god
[20:48] is the judge why let
[20:52] him let god's word be true
[20:55] and a word or doctrines or teachings or
[21:00] whatever be a liar
[21:03] in the sight of the living god oh
[21:07] judged by your word by god's word
[21:10] hallelujah
[21:13] this woman stands before the living word
[21:17] not just the bible shall argue you to
[21:20] death with the
[21:21] written word of the bible but standing
[21:24] before the judge himself
[21:27] does this woman my friends as she stands
[21:31] there
[21:32] what is her plea she's asked
[21:36] what do you plea as any criminal
[21:40] or any arrested person is asked
[21:43] what is your plea i gave her a space to
[21:47] repent
[21:49] but she did not repent god says
[21:53] in his word what is this woman's plea
[21:57] are you guilty or not guilty
[22:01] what does she plea what else do you
[22:04] expect
[22:06] this woman please that she is not guilty
[22:12] she does not cry out to the great
[22:15] judge asking him for mercy
[22:22] she does not falls upon his grace
[22:28] and asked him for forgiveness
[22:33] no sir this woman
[22:38] is in a died in the wool
[22:41] her left in her heart in her nature
[22:45] in our ways all my friends
[22:49] and now she even
[22:53] protect before the judge
[22:56] she's killing a state of rebellion
[22:59] she protects her innocence
[23:03] enter the filth after the rottenness
[23:06] after the fornication
[23:08] after the adulteries with kings and
[23:11] great men of the earth and all kinds of
[23:14] false gods false teachings idolatry
[23:18] persecutions insurrections
[23:21] inquisitions all of that and
[23:24] she still pre-protects
[23:27] her innocence and stands and
[23:31] proclaims puberty oh my friends
[23:35] think of it she thinks
[23:39] because she robes herself with white
[23:44] because she paints her cathedral's
[23:47] white paints
[23:51] the outward part of her body
[23:54] white god isn't looking just at the
[23:57] dress
[23:59] he is not looking at whether you dress
[24:01] up as a bride
[24:03] god not the heart this is the
[24:06] judge who knows the intent
[24:10] and the motivations of the heart
[24:14] oh praise god the omnipotent omniscient
[24:18] all-knowing god who cannot fail who
[24:21] cannot lie
[24:22] but stands by the word for he himself
[24:26] is the word amen yes
[24:30] this woman puts up a
[24:36] one whale claiming her
[24:40] innocence claiming
[24:43] how pure she is to him the word
[24:47] claiming her honesty
[24:53] she's claiming her kindness
[24:57] in putting up children's
[25:00] schools orphanages
[25:04] uh uh bread you know
[25:07] food baskets and feeding the poor
[25:11] and and charity taking care
[25:15] of so many in various areas
[25:19] building hospitals and everything else
[25:22] outwardly that is fine
[25:24] that is man looking at it that way but
[25:27] this is the great
[25:28] judge of heaven the god of the universe
[25:33] looking and seeing the deeds
[25:36] behind the words and behind the
[25:39] appearances
[25:41] this great judge sees it all
[25:44] and knows it all as she
[25:47] protests her innocence and
[25:51] talks about her honesty and about her
[25:54] kindness
[25:56] in feeding masses around the world
[26:00] in all my friends
[26:03] she protests this innocence and
[26:06] calls for support that multitudes
[26:10] billions of people from her wrecks
[26:15] will come to bear witness great men
[26:20] of this world wise men of this world
[26:26] influential men of this world
[26:29] will come and argue on her behalf
[26:33] about her goodness her innocence or
[26:36] honesty
[26:38] and so on her purity it will speak
[26:41] and they will speak for her human
[26:45] and protest uh her arrest
[26:50] before this great judge
[26:53] of the universe but here she stands
[26:58] still manifesting secretly
[27:02] that same ancient cruelty
[27:06] that has always been in within her heart
[27:11] she refuses the headship
[27:14] of her true husband the
[27:18] revealed word of god she wants nothing
[27:21] to do
[27:23] with the revealed word she rejects his
[27:27] word
[27:28] she rejects his person of one god
[27:32] she will not accept one man
[27:35] within her life the word of god made
[27:39] manifest amen she looks to
[27:43] this multi-dimensional world
[27:46] out there all my friends
[27:49] oh while claiming
[27:53] that jesus the word is our
[27:56] founder and her husband
[28:01] yet she turns around
[28:04] and rejects him and rejects
[28:07] his word she maintains her truthfulness
[28:13] while spreading and propagating
[28:15] religious
[28:16] lies and various uh denominational
[28:20] artifices
[28:21] around the world around the entire
[28:25] place oh my friends
[28:29] she claims she has never
[28:32] and has not been unfaithful
[28:35] to the word and while
[28:38] she is saying it
[28:42] while this woman is still having
[28:46] so-called worship and services and
[28:49] and you know taking what she claims
[28:52] is the word of god while speaking
[28:56] like that my friends
[28:59] carrying within her church body
[29:03] satan's seed satan's seed
[29:08] now forming in the swelling
[29:12] ranks of her the numbers
[29:16] that she carries within
[29:19] her church body within that body
[29:26] something is taking form and
[29:29] is not the form of the stature of
[29:34] a perfect man christ the word
[29:37] she that thing has taken the form
[29:41] of the image of the beast
[29:45] yes carrying certain seed
[29:50] telling lies propagating
[29:54] absolute stuff that is
[29:58] absolutely contrary to the word of god
[30:02] there's only one god and his name is
[30:05] jesus christ
[30:06] not three gods one god there's only
[30:10] one mediator between god
[30:14] and man the man christ jesus hallelujah
[30:18] or blessed be the name there's only one
[30:22] true form of water baptism
[30:25] and that is to be what the apostles
[30:28] thought
[30:28] what the apostle preached what peter
[30:31] thought
[30:32] it has not changed it is in the bible
[30:36] baptizing them in the name
[30:39] of the lord jesus christ one god
[30:42] one name one mediator she
[30:46] speaks my friend in total opposition to
[30:50] that which i have just declared
[30:53] out of the word of god while
[30:56] carrying satan's seed in her
[31:00] that is being forming itself right now
[31:03] as i speak into the image
[31:07] of the beast and not
[31:10] in the image of the word
[31:14] and so acumenism is coming because she
[31:18] is
[31:18] calling out to her daughters to come
[31:22] back to mama come back home
[31:26] let us be one let us
[31:29] tend together as one and resist
[31:32] this judge and resist this sentence
[31:36] that is about to be passed against me
[31:40] yes sir i see here my friends
[31:44] this great evidence we cannot ignore it
[31:47] any longer
[31:49] for the swelling
[31:52] of the numbers of our church body
[31:56] tells us that she has and she is
[31:59] carrying
[32:01] the seed of satan within her which will
[32:04] produce
[32:05] nothing less but that beast-like
[32:08] spirit that is the spirit of cain that
[32:12] killed his brother abell that's why we
[32:15] know she'll repeat it again and over
[32:19] and over again for it is a nature
[32:22] upon of her it is a spirit of satan
[32:26] upon her and she must do it and
[32:29] all those that join themselves to her
[32:32] all those who take her pattern all those
[32:36] who denominate
[32:37] all those who organize with the systems
[32:41] of man
[32:42] of satan and of the world they will come
[32:45] that's why god said
[32:47] come out of her my people and
[32:50] be not partakers of her sins
[32:54] amen yes sir we see it clearly
[32:58] in the word of god
[33:01] amen yes
[33:04] here we find friends
[33:07] that as the church goes into idolatry
[33:13] and refuses to take the headship as many
[33:17] women of this modern age will refuse the
[33:20] hateship
[33:22] and leadership of their husbands either
[33:24] because they have better education maybe
[33:26] they have more
[33:27] money because they may be wiser they may
[33:30] be more gifted
[33:31] but god still says that she
[33:34] should be subject to her husband amen
[33:38] she can give him the best advice she can
[33:41] guide him she could
[33:43] tell him this or that and how to go
[33:45] about things
[33:46] like that but she still ought to know
[33:49] how to humble herself
[33:50] and to be a godly dignified loyal
[33:54] fateful woman that is modest in
[33:57] every way and carries her herself
[34:01] loyal faithful true and
[34:04] pure to her husband and to the word
[34:07] of god if a woman is not true to her
[34:10] husband
[34:12] then she becomes an adulteress oh my
[34:15] friends
[34:16] and what will the punishment of this
[34:19] harlot
[34:20] and her daughter's be what will it be
[34:23] first god said i will
[34:26] cast her into a bed amen
[34:30] what bed the bed of tribulation
[34:34] what that means number one
[34:37] god is saying her punishment will be
[34:41] that i will cross her to mr rapture the
[34:44] glorious event
[34:46] that we all with great expectation
[34:50] waiting on the coming of the lord
[34:53] when jesus himself will descend
[34:57] or hath descended and now to catch his
[35:00] waiting bride away
[35:02] and those who uh postulate those who
[35:06] present
[35:06] themselves that they are
[35:10] the brand that they are married to
[35:13] christ
[35:14] when they have a ring of rebellion
[35:17] instead of us who carry a ring of
[35:20] righteousness
[35:22] and royalty holding to god's unchanging
[35:26] hand and word
[35:27] oh prince club that's why he'll take
[35:30] some and leave some
[35:32] amen yes sir so soon the rapture will
[35:36] come
[35:37] and you'll take the bride out of here
[35:39] but
[35:40] things he promised in his word his
[35:42] judgment will be
[35:44] that he will they'll miss the rapture
[35:47] secondly
[35:48] i'll cast them into a bed of tribulation
[35:53] they'll have to go through the
[35:54] tribulation period
[35:56] sentence against the harlot one
[35:59] mr rapture sentence go
[36:03] into the tribulation period amen
[36:07] yes sir and there to face the
[36:10] the tribulation with all its troubled
[36:14] trials
[36:14] and tests amen then god
[36:18] said not only that i'll put her to death
[36:22] with death england yes sir he'll
[36:26] put her to death spiritually right now
[36:29] it doesn't seem like she is dead
[36:31] spiritually
[36:33] but as the bible said oh
[36:36] she a woman that lives in cities dead
[36:38] while she appears that she's leaving
[36:41] yes she appears that she's prospering
[36:44] she's growing
[36:45] she's living and carrying on but the
[36:47] bible said she's
[36:49] dead jesus put it this way
[36:53] you look righteous you're well dressed
[36:56] oh
[36:56] my but inwardly you're rotten
[36:59] you're stink because you're inside you
[37:03] you carry the history you carry
[37:06] the very residual of dead man's bones
[37:11] oh god have mercy in this world in which
[37:15] we
[37:15] live today may god take these few words
[37:19] make them real and true to you
[37:22] may the word of god break through your
[37:25] consciousness
[37:26] may break the veil of sin
[37:29] of blindness and bring to you the
[37:32] fullness
[37:33] of his word and of his divine presence
[37:36] amen
[37:37] god said sentence you'll go
[37:40] with the rapture you're going to the
[37:44] tribulation
[37:47] and at the end of it all
[37:50] i'll put you into spiritual
[37:54] death amen yes sir
[37:58] oh and why i'll put you to spiritual
[38:02] death
[38:03] what is it you'll die by death
[38:07] think of it amen oh
[38:10] my let them be put
[38:14] to death with death in other words
[38:18] your spread spiritual death then i'll
[38:21] let you
[38:21] die by the same false doctrines
[38:25] and things you were peddling and pushing
[38:28] the same religious dope and addictions
[38:33] that you were propagating and
[38:36] pushing and spreading amen
[38:39] and your mad billions to die
[38:42] by it you'll die by death
[38:46] the very death that you were selling
[38:49] and peddling the poison that you are
[38:52] propagating i let you die
[38:56] by the very poison that you
[38:59] were pedaling and selling indeed
[39:02] we find the principle that evil
[39:06] always destroys itself
[39:11] when a snake is so vicious
[39:15] that it will bite and snap at anything
[39:18] that seems
[39:20] it cannot agree with can it see the
[39:23] light can it see the truth
[39:24] it just has to have a little movement
[39:27] coming against it
[39:28] it's ready to snap and the poison
[39:31] acids of hate comes out of it
[39:34] but this time god said i'll put you to
[39:38] death by
[39:39] death i'll let you kill yourself the
[39:42] snake bites its own tail oh
[39:45] think of it the vicious evil wicked
[39:48] snake
[39:48] bites its own tail poisons its own self
[39:52] like the liar will always be
[39:56] caught by his and whip their
[39:59] own lies for liars will find their
[40:03] pathway into the lake
[40:06] of fire the bible tells
[40:10] us i'm winding this down now how that
[40:13] there were ten virgins five wise and
[40:16] five full
[40:17] foolish amen and this woman will be
[40:21] among those
[40:22] that will run around seeking oil they
[40:25] thought there were
[40:26] virgins all the time that thought they
[40:28] were bride that thought they were ready
[40:31] for the rapture they thought they were
[40:33] ready to get out of here
[40:35] only to they did not accept the word
[40:40] they did not walk with the word and in
[40:42] the word
[40:43] and so in the last moments they're
[40:46] running around
[40:48] trying to find oil hallelujah
[40:52] and then but the wise already had the
[40:55] oil
[40:57] and the crown went out behold a
[40:59] bridegroom comet
[41:01] amen go out to meet him
[41:04] go out to face him go out
[41:08] to stand before him oh my
[41:11] friends amen yes sir
[41:15] but those five my friends
[41:18] five went in to meet the bridegroom
[41:21] and the five stayed out because
[41:24] they had no oil within
[41:28] their lamps and that is certainly what's
[41:31] going to happen
[41:33] while one bride or goes in
[41:37] to meet him and is caught up
[41:40] into the spiritual presence of god or
[41:44] the upper atmosphere
[41:46] or into the air amen the other five
[41:51] will be left out they are left out of
[41:54] the understanding now
[41:55] they are left out of the revival now
[41:58] they are left out of the revelation now
[42:02] and they don't know him now and they
[42:05] will not recognize him then
[42:07] may god help us friends may you be
[42:10] in that number that will recognize him
[42:15] now in the word so that when he comes
[42:18] again
[42:19] you'll be able to recognize him in his
[42:22] divine person
[42:23] may the holy spirit take these few words
[42:27] of just a sinful man
[42:30] trying to live god's life
[42:33] trying to present god's word to you
[42:37] not me look past me
[42:40] but see the word and make this
[42:43] word of god catch within your soul
[42:47] and produce nothing less but the
[42:51] image of jesus christ that you may
[42:54] live now and forevermore may god bless
[42:57] you
[42:58] as we come again this sunday
[43:02] will gather in good neighbor ministries
[43:05] where i will be speaking on the
[43:09] word of god for the day star
[43:12] from on high is still shining may god
[43:15] bless you now
[43:16] and we'll meet again next wednesday here
