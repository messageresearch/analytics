[3:57] a clean heart
[3:59] before i sing that song i just wanted to
[4:00] read where this song was taken out from
[4:02] the psalms david had
[4:05] sinned against god
[4:06] and nathan the prophet came to him and
[4:08] told him god was displeased because he
[4:10] had gone with another man's wife
[4:12] bathsheba this buried me is a little bit
[4:15] lengthy but
[4:16] have mercy upon me oh god

[4:21] according to the multitude of my tender
[4:23] mercies
[4:25] blot out my transgressions watch me
[4:28] truly from mine iniquity
[4:30] and cleanse me from my sin
[4:32] for i acknowledge my transgression and
[4:34] my sin is ever before me
[4:36] against thee the only have i sinned
[4:39] and done this evil in thy sight that
[4:42] thou might just be justified in those
[4:44] speakers and declare or end our judges
[4:47] behold i was sharp shapen in iniquity
[4:50] and in sin did my mother conceive me
[4:53] behold all desires true to the inward
[4:55] paths
[4:56] and in hidden path thou shalt make me to
[4:58] know wisdom purge me with hyssop
[5:01] and i shall be clean wash me and i shall
[5:03] be whiter than snow
[5:05] make me to hear that like gladness
[5:08] that the bones which thou hast broken
[5:11] may rejoice
[5:12] hide thy face from my sins and blot out
[5:15] my iniquities
[5:16] created me a clean heart

[5:20] me

[5:29] of thy salvation that will hold me with
[5:30] thy free spirit then i will teach
[5:33] transgression and thy ways and sinners
[5:35] shall be converted unto thee
[5:37] and i'm going to go down to verse 16 it
[5:39] says for thou desires not sacrifice else
[5:42] i would give it
[5:44] thou the lightest not and burnt offering
[5:47] but the sacrifice of god is a broken
[5:49] spirit and a broken and contrite heart

[35:39] god heavenly father we commit to you
[35:43] your people
[35:44] into your hands i pray you'll bless us
[35:47] today in every way in jesus name amen
[35:52] uh please be seated i'd like to
[35:55] note here
[35:57] the passing or the crossing over of one
[36:01] of my oldest converts since i was just a
[36:04] teenager
[36:06] and preached the word of god
[36:09] brother
[36:10] smith his name is smith
[36:13] and
[36:15] he
[36:16] was one who held to the word from those
[36:19] times
[36:20] until today
[36:23] he passed
[36:24] on i believe friday morning
[36:27] at 96 years of age
[36:31] trusting the lord and believing every
[36:33] step of the way
[36:36] trials on every hand
[36:38] he was a tailor
[36:40] and did a lot of his training overseas
[36:44] and went back
[36:45] there and set up his
[36:47] his
[36:48] shop
[36:49] not really a shop he had a building and
[36:52] everything else like that with equipment
[36:54] and
[36:54] other tailors working under him he had
[36:57] an establishment and he was that kind of
[37:01] a person
[37:02] but nevertheless
[37:04] here comes a young boy preaching the
[37:07] word and it caught the seed caught in
[37:10] his heart
[37:11] and he believed and held to god's
[37:14] unchanging hand
[37:17] never mind whatever happened he was a
[37:20] real true believer
[37:22] and anybody will testify to that brother
[37:25] aubry and those brothers were just
[37:28] young kids when he came in right
[37:32] and they grew up and he was still there
[37:35] and they come overseas he's still there
[37:37] pressing on
[37:39] but now
[37:40] the lord has seen it fit to promote him
[37:43] higher and to god we give the glory and
[37:47] i would like to acknowledge that
[37:50] his faith and trust in god
[37:52] and in the word that he received it led
[37:56] him safe
[37:57] until this hour he didn't have to wander
[38:01] in his crossing if he had to cross alone
[38:04] or if he's going to the right place
[38:06] or whatever the lord took him and now i
[38:10] believe he is happy
[38:11] in the presence of the lord and back to
[38:14] age 2021 in the fullness of his strength
[38:18] amen
[38:19] we thank god for that amen we're going
[38:22] to have uh the baptism of grace
[38:26] bobby frimpong
[38:28] brother phillips daughter
[38:31] um
[38:32] last sunday
[38:34] god has been speaking to her heart but
[38:36] last sunday seemed to have
[38:39] brought it to the more to four
[38:42] and so she's asked
[38:44] told her father of course he was
[38:46] surprised that she wants to be baptized
[38:49] in water in the name of the lord jesus
[38:52] christ so we thank god
[38:53] [Applause]
[38:58] and as it is fitting brother uh danny
[39:02] will do the baptism praise the lord
[39:06] after which we do have a certificate
[39:10] here that will be presented to the dear
[39:14] young lady may god bless her heart in
[39:17] her journey as she in her walk with god
[39:20] as she walks with him through the pair
[39:23] these perilous times
[39:25] of life that we're living in amen i want
[39:29] to ask you also to pray for our dear
[39:32] brother um michael eastman and his wife
[39:36] they
[39:37] left
[39:39] and are in panama
[39:41] right now
[39:42] and of course the hurricane is hitting
[39:44] their place
[39:46] up there his daughter is there but let's
[39:49] pray for their safety
[39:52] because they were flooded out completely
[39:55] the last time with the wind and the rain
[39:57] said cars were just floating down the
[39:59] street
[40:01] so we just got to believe and trust god
[40:04] that god will take care of all his
[40:07] affairs amen praise the lord at the end

[40:36] that praise the lord well today by the
[40:39] grace of god all week

[41:11] place and plainly say that i
[41:15] am speaking on the eternal church age

[43:14] in our eyes
[43:16] this is the day
[43:18] which the lord hath made
[43:21] we will rejoice
[43:24] and be glad in it praise the lord may
[43:28] the lord richly bless us all heavenly
[43:30] father we thank you for the reading of
[43:33] the holy scriptures and now as we come
[43:37] before thee may the spirit of the living
[43:40] god make the word come alive quicken the
[43:44] word father
[43:46] by the great fire of the holy spirit
[43:49] that we might reflect you and give you
[43:52] glory honor and praise god bless you
[43:55] please be seated
[43:56] brethren
[43:59] hallelujah glory to god
[44:02] amen
[44:05] now we just
[44:07] some time ago i uh not some time ago a
[44:11] long time ago as a young man i i was
[44:14] reading the some of the sermons and
[44:17] writings of great preachers of the past
[44:20] and among them was one called joseph
[44:23] parker who preached on the subject of
[44:26] the
[44:27] stone the builders rejected the rejected
[44:30] stone
[44:31] and he was saying do you notice
[44:34] the stone that the builders
[44:37] he said first of all this wasn't just a
[44:40] brick
[44:42] that's man-made
[44:44] this was a stone
[44:47] and so it was
[44:48] god that created that stone
[44:53] and now he said the next thing you
[44:55] notice
[44:56] those were not just ordinary people
[44:59] these were builders
[45:01] he said today we'll call them
[45:03] theologians experts
[45:05] experts in the scriptures experts
[45:08] in the bible
[45:10] but they refused
[45:13] the cornerstone
[45:15] that god
[45:16] had made
[45:18] amen
[45:20] but the bible tells us that the
[45:22] cornerstone
[45:24] has become
[45:25] they had stone
[45:27] and we want to thank god for that
[45:29] that that cornerstone has now become the
[45:33] headstone praise the lord
[45:35] i'm just getting myself organized here
[45:38] mentally and in every way praise the
[45:41] lord
[45:42] now we realize brethren
[45:45] that
[45:46] when you are building
[45:48] a building or building a house
[45:51] the house has corners
[45:54] and each corner actually points two ways
[45:58] it's leaving one age and going into
[46:01] another
[46:02] but it's a corner stone right
[46:06] or praise god i'm so glad to have
[46:09] contact with the cornerstone
[46:12] now we understand that also from
[46:16] a various uh quotes and
[46:19] sayings of the prophet
[46:21] that the cornerstone
[46:24] instead
[46:26] of just
[46:27] being a cornerstone
[46:29] through the ages just turning the corner
[46:32] through the ages
[46:34] after all the ages
[46:36] have come
[46:38] and passed
[46:39] you don't need a cornerstone anymore
[46:43] and that cornerstone
[46:46] moves to its position
[46:49] of being the headstone
[46:52] it moves to the head
[46:54] and it sits there
[46:56] because the same
[46:58] cornerstone is the headstone
[47:02] that it just changes the position
[47:05] or changes the age
[47:07] in which you are living in
[47:10] after that corner
[47:12] has
[47:13] been turned
[47:15] we want to thank the lord for the
[47:17] recognizing that in our day
[47:21] now when brother branham was teaching on
[47:24] this topic or subject of
[47:27] the
[47:28] cornerstone
[47:30] he immediately introduced the pyramid
[47:35] he introduced the teaching on the
[47:37] stature of a perfect man
[47:41] and in actual fact he was portraying the
[47:45] pyramid as a building
[47:47] being builded
[47:49] and these stones all being built up
[47:53] into a spiritual house
[47:58] in actual fact
[48:00] i have a where he says here in the
[48:02] leadership book
[48:05] we are
[48:07] you're building a wall
[48:09] but that's only one straight way
[48:12] and that's all fine
[48:13] see they're going a row
[48:16] but when you have to turn the corner
[48:20] that's where realize
[48:23] that's when you've come now
[48:26] to the whole building you realize you're
[48:30] not just building wall
[48:33] you're building a house
[48:35] that wall has to fit into a house
[48:37] so in actual fact you're building a
[48:39] house
[48:40] and the house has walls
[48:43] and the walls have corners
[48:45] so don't just take the age like that it
[48:49] fits somewhere else
[48:51] so that something else could fit again
[48:54] because you are building a complete
[48:57] house
[48:58] amen just like when we come to luther
[49:03] then wesley
[49:04] and pentecost
[49:06] but it is here again
[49:10] praise god
[49:12] they turn the corner
[49:14] luther wesley pentecost he said but it's
[49:18] here again
[49:20] there's another corner to be turned
[49:23] again
[49:24] praise god hallelujah oh praise god
[49:29] listen we have turned the corner
[49:32] and now
[49:33] where are we
[49:34] we're looking towards heaven we're
[49:37] watching for him to come
[49:40] it's the coming
[49:42] it's the cap on the pyramid amen you see
[49:46] he become the what the capstone
[49:49] right because that's the headstone that
[49:53] was the same cornerstone now become the
[49:56] capping stone
[49:58] hallelujah oh my see so he's
[50:02] back praise god the cap on the pyramid
[50:08] praise the lord jesus we thank god for
[50:11] that hallelujah that we have come
[50:13] through the seven church ages how many
[50:15] knows that
[50:17] lord of god hallelujah but there were
[50:21] ages
[50:22] remember that there were ages i believe
[50:27] somewhere here i made a note here
[50:30] that the word ages comes from the greek
[50:32] word a on a i o n
[50:36] right
[50:37] which is ages which is a a certain
[50:41] period of time that god designate to
[50:44] deal with human beings over a certain
[50:48] matter or thing that he has in his own
[50:50] thoughts
[50:51] it's just a time
[50:53] so the church changes are of the time
[50:55] element
[50:57] and god dealing with his people in that
[51:00] time element over a period of time
[51:04] praise god hallelujah so we find friends
[51:10] that
[51:10] they
[51:12] church
[51:13] this pyramid that the prophet is talking
[51:16] about he called it stature
[51:18] of a perfect man
[51:21] now by now
[51:22] you would have grown a maturity enough
[51:24] to realize that pyramid does not just
[51:27] represent uh as many preachers of the
[51:29] past uh preached it that it's you that
[51:33] has to become perfect
[51:36] and you got to build up these pyramids
[51:39] into yourself he was actually talking
[51:43] of the building materials of the church
[51:46] ages
[51:48] for these churches each represented a
[51:50] virtue
[51:52] or a part of the building materials that
[51:55] god the great workman was building his
[51:59] own house
[52:01] to dwell in and
[52:04] the
[52:05] pyramid represented the stature of the
[52:09] perfect man christ jesus
[52:12] hallelujah of course it also represents
[52:17] us but the emphasis was not on us it was
[52:21] him that was that we are looking at
[52:24] there
[52:25] amen being built up
[52:27] a spiritual house through seven church
[52:31] ages praise the lord so we give god the
[52:35] glory and thanks for that uh him
[52:39] building that way praise god now that's
[52:42] going to take me back to the statue of a
[52:44] perfect man to this wonderful quote that
[52:48] i love so much praise the lord
[52:50] hallelujah because he taught it and we
[52:53] believe it here in the word of god
[52:57] hallelujah well let me nail this down
[53:01] each one of those virtues
[53:03] actually represented a church age
[53:07] the people of that church age were going
[53:09] to manifest that particular virtue
[53:13] hallelujah
[53:14] okay
[53:16] jesus christ himself all those virtues
[53:19] are in him
[53:21] so if he comes into you
[53:25] it's not you going to
[53:27] fight to put these virtues on
[53:30] because he is in you with all those
[53:33] virtues
[53:35] so
[53:36] you are saved by his salvation
[53:39] you are perfect with his perfection
[53:43] for he in you makes you perfect
[53:47] and now we realize
[53:49] from the teaching you have been
[53:50] receiving and from the word that is not
[53:53] perfecting your flesh
[53:56] it's perfecting your manifestation
[53:59] of that gene seed through your flesh
[54:04] right
[54:05] you have it's like a baby trying to walk
[54:08] and the word tells you what you have to
[54:11] do but reading it hearing it and doing
[54:14] it is another matter you can say walk
[54:17] baby walk walk the child is still going
[54:20] to walk and fall and stumble and bruise
[54:23] their knees and everything else but
[54:26] that's only part of the process of
[54:28] walking
[54:30] so we have to deal with it from that
[54:33] point of view praise god so then brother
[54:37] sister we see
[54:39] in the scriptures
[54:41] luke uh chapter 20
[54:44] verses 9 to 16 the story is told of the
[54:48] man who rich man who had a vineyard
[54:53] and
[54:54] he sent out his servants
[54:56] one at a time
[54:58] right you already know that types the
[55:00] messengers one at a time coming out
[55:04] and when they come out
[55:06] uh there these people or what men
[55:12] refused them
[55:13] rejected them and beat them
[55:17] from receiving
[55:19] the lord's words his orders
[55:22] his will of what he wanted done amen
[55:27] praise god so we watch the church ages
[55:30] and we see luther wesley we come on down
[55:33] to pentecost
[55:37] and god
[55:39] sent a great sweep in revival
[55:42] hallelujah
[55:43] and in that revival there were great men
[55:47] that god used
[55:49] men like a.a allen jack cole
[55:52] ff bosworth velma gardner gordon lindsay
[55:56] many many others who
[55:58] whose names you don't need to know but
[56:01] there were a
[56:02] miracle men
[56:04] like
[56:05] a dime a dozen all around the country
[56:09] not now you get one put on a white suit
[56:11] and gets up and thousands of people come
[56:14] to this was everywhere
[56:18] it was everywhere
[56:20] amen
[56:21] i've seen in my own country there as a
[56:25] boy
[56:26] one of those ordinary the missionaries
[56:29] come to teach him the bible and the word
[56:32] and the man stood up there in the
[56:36] headquarters and started to preach the
[56:38] word the building shook the power of god
[56:42] struck the place missionaries were on
[56:45] the stomach they were screaming and
[56:47] crying out to god demons were coming out
[56:50] amen everything was going on while he
[56:52] was preaching the word amen it was the
[56:55] spirit of pentecost the real pentecost
[57:00] that had struck the world
[57:02] i came in at the ending part of it
[57:04] brother sister watching them and saying
[57:06] so-and-so is coming this sunday you know
[57:09] don't bother
[57:11] that person is going to br they never
[57:13] seen the person in their life and they
[57:14] turn up and the pastor just gladly
[57:17] welcomed them to the pulpit because god
[57:19] himself said them
[57:22] and they know before he got there that
[57:24] he was coming because somebody that was
[57:27] in prayer and fasting caught a
[57:30] revelation
[57:31] amen hallelujah so the power of god was
[57:35] sweeping the country sweeping the entire
[57:38] world hallelujah amen and i want you to
[57:43] see here
[57:45] that
[57:46] brother branham himself or roberts all
[57:49] these brothers that came along
[57:52] hallelujah amen but brother branham my
[57:56] brother sister being amongst them
[57:58] he was yous of god and you know he was
[58:03] the messenger to the obedient church age
[58:08] but go back just to briefly mention to
[58:10] you the use of a cornerstone it don't
[58:13] only
[58:14] you know turn the corner it points to
[58:16] the new corner that's coming and then it
[58:20] points back to the corner it just turned
[58:23] right so so the prophet's ministry
[58:26] there's quotations to prove that is
[58:28] twofold right he was not just the taking
[58:32] the messenger to the church age but he
[58:34] turns around and he points behold the
[58:36] lamb of god that taketh away the sins of
[58:39] the world he's coming amen oh praise god
[58:43] hallelujah goes up to sunset mountain
[58:46] and there he is praise god welcoming the
[58:50] mighty angel of revelation 10 1 who
[58:53] comes to bring the opening of the word
[58:56] for once the book was closed and only
[58:59] one opened the book the lamb opened the
[59:02] book but when the angel came the bible
[59:05] said he's descended to the earth with
[59:07] the book open within his hand hallelujah
[59:10] revealed it to revelation 10 7 and said
[59:13] time shall be no more
[59:16] we thought we used to think in the early
[59:18] part of the message the end of the world
[59:20] but no he was just saying that your
[59:22] changes are over
[59:24] i'm stepping on the scene now
[59:27] i'm taking over you don't need no
[59:30] messenger
[59:32] i am the church age messenger
[59:36] i am the one that sent them hallelujah
[59:40] the boss himself has come glory to god
[59:43] we thank god for the boss hallelujah
[59:46] that he's come up on the scene amen
[59:49] praise god yes sir i tell you that this
[59:53] is the truth out of the word of god now
[59:58] the church age brother branham came in
[1:00:01] was what
[1:00:03] brotherly kindness
[1:00:06] that was the church age
[1:00:08] that he came in the church age of
[1:00:10] lodesia of brotherly kindness and then
[1:00:14] the next stage
[1:00:16] is love
[1:00:17] praise god hallelujah now let's
[1:00:21] go to statue of a perfect man
[1:00:26] now
[1:00:28] we are approaching the seven seals
[1:00:34] we've just finished the seven church
[1:00:38] ages now you got to remember the seals
[1:00:40] weren't preached yet he's telling you we
[1:00:42] are now approaching this approaching the
[1:00:45] seven seals
[1:00:46] amen
[1:00:47] right praise god he is announcing that
[1:00:51] he's turned the corner
[1:00:53] the seventh sea the seventh church ages
[1:00:56] are now over
[1:00:58] and the church is moving on spiritually
[1:01:02] to something else
[1:01:04] that's not me saying it
[1:01:06] praise god i'm prepared to be
[1:01:08] misunderstood by preaching
[1:01:11] this like that plain and open that there
[1:01:14] is another age beyond the seven church
[1:01:18] ages
[1:01:19] and that's not a regular church age as
[1:01:22] we call it because it's not one that's
[1:01:25] built in time but it's one that i i'm
[1:01:29] preaching on today
[1:01:32] that eternal church age
[1:01:35] listen
[1:01:36] praise god
[1:01:38] we have just finished the seven church
[1:01:42] ages
[1:01:44] and this is talking about him preaching
[1:01:46] stature of a perfect man
[1:01:49] is a message on the teaching
[1:01:53] that ties the man in
[1:01:56] hallelujah is turning now the men and
[1:02:00] women elected from the seven church ages
[1:02:05] this teaching of the statue of a perfect
[1:02:08] man
[1:02:09] understanding and the revelation of the
[1:02:12] pyramid
[1:02:13] ties them man in
[1:02:15] that's going to be
[1:02:18] redeemed
[1:02:20] hallelujah
[1:02:22] by the blood of the lord jesus
[1:02:25] hallelujah praise god amen we know the
[1:02:30] token itself that is the blood the holy
[1:02:34] spirit is the blood of the lord jesus
[1:02:37] listen i know when i start preaching
[1:02:39] something like this people misunderstand
[1:02:42] what's he talking about
[1:02:44] that uh what's he thinking who does he
[1:02:46] think he is what is this all about it's
[1:02:48] nothing to do with me and even if you
[1:02:50] don't understand the holy spirit will
[1:02:53] cause you to understand if you are one
[1:02:55] of his own
[1:02:57] this is a message on the teaching
[1:03:01] that ties the man in
[1:03:04] that's going to be
[1:03:06] redeemed
[1:03:07] by the blood of the lord jesus
[1:03:12] and is going to be
[1:03:15] in the church age
[1:03:18] that
[1:03:19] eternal
[1:03:21] church age
[1:03:23] at the end of the seals
[1:03:27] hallelujah i think you can find that
[1:03:29] page six uh statue of a perfect man if
[1:03:32] it's a reprint book it might be around
[1:03:34] page 200 uh but you'll find that you
[1:03:36] just go look on it you're gonna find it
[1:03:38] that's not me saying that that's brother
[1:03:40] branham saying that amen thus set the
[1:03:44] lord behind it that eternal church age
[1:03:49] at the end
[1:03:51] of the seals hallelujah now he's talking
[1:03:55] about this before he even opened the
[1:03:58] city the seals were even open
[1:04:01] or before he himself had a revelation of
[1:04:05] those seals
[1:04:06] amen praise the lord
[1:04:09] hallelujah but he knew that at the end
[1:04:13] of the seals there was going to be an
[1:04:16] eternal age
[1:04:19] he called it church age so we can
[1:04:21] understand
[1:04:23] because church age is in time element
[1:04:27] but the moment you put eternal on that
[1:04:29] it's actually not a age as we human
[1:04:32] beings uh
[1:04:34] you know will think of it this one now
[1:04:37] is timeless
[1:04:38] this one is eternal
[1:04:41] and we are moving from time and breaking
[1:04:44] back into eternity
[1:04:47] by the revelation of the word of god
[1:04:50] amen hallelujah
[1:04:53] they praise god oh my
[1:04:56] yes sir so here we are we're back
[1:04:59] brought back
[1:05:00] coming from remember teaching on the
[1:05:03] genes and the
[1:05:04] germs of of god
[1:05:07] we are not of time
[1:05:10] we you
[1:05:11] the inside man
[1:05:13] you're not from time
[1:05:15] we are just sent there just like jesus
[1:05:18] was
[1:05:20] he didn't come from mary
[1:05:22] mary didn't produce him
[1:05:24] he was just designated by god to pass
[1:05:28] through mary
[1:05:30] hallelujah and god designated to us
[1:05:34] everything a time and season god
[1:05:36] designates us to come up in the seventh
[1:05:40] church age physically and pass through
[1:05:42] it
[1:05:43] but we are not from it
[1:05:46] we were allowed to pass through it but
[1:05:48] we are not from it
[1:05:50] the word of god is our origin
[1:05:53] we come from eternity and we pass
[1:05:56] through time to go back to the eternal
[1:05:58] back again to the glory of god
[1:06:01] hallelujah
[1:06:03] amen praise god i'm talking about what
[1:06:06] the eter that eternal church age
[1:06:10] and i'm deliberately using the specific
[1:06:13] words that brother branham himself used
[1:06:16] so that you can't say i made up
[1:06:19] something
[1:06:20] it's right there
[1:06:22] and he said it amen praise god now you
[1:06:26] know
[1:06:27] by now i'm not here preaching to make
[1:06:30] believers
[1:06:32] i'm not preaching to great pretenders
[1:06:36] i'm not preaching to slip and slide duck
[1:06:39] and hide
[1:06:40] i'm preaching to real believers
[1:06:44] i'm preaching to the bride
[1:06:46] the genuine elect of god
[1:06:50] hallelujah amen praise god amen yes sir
[1:06:54] my only interest here is to edify the
[1:06:57] body of jesus christ
[1:06:59] esther build up the body of jesus christ
[1:07:02] look everybody likes to be prosperous
[1:07:05] everybody likes to be blessed but i will
[1:07:07] tell you from the beginning the calling
[1:07:10] of god money was never my problem to be
[1:07:14] worrying about money and trying to fight
[1:07:17] and work and try to amass wealth and
[1:07:20] that's good if god gave you that kind of
[1:07:23] a gift and he wants to bless you that
[1:07:25] way
[1:07:26] wonderful i said wonderful
[1:07:29] praise god so i'm all for that but i
[1:07:32] want you to know i got no other motives
[1:07:37] but to ratify the body and build up the
[1:07:40] body of jesus christ hallelujah
[1:07:43] if you turn uh tomorrow like demons
[1:07:47] against paul or one of those others it
[1:07:50] doesn't matter hallelujah i'll be
[1:07:54] concerned for your soul but really
[1:07:56] friends i am pressing on the upward way
[1:08:00] you hide some gaining every day
[1:08:02] hallelujah pressing on in the name of
[1:08:05] the lord
[1:08:06] amen praise god glory to god could you
[1:08:10] well you don't have that here but the
[1:08:12] seven seals
[1:08:14] page 124
[1:08:16] to page
[1:08:17] 128 saying it so it will go out and you
[1:08:21] can check that afterwards
[1:08:24] now
[1:08:26] we know
[1:08:27] the book is a revelation
[1:08:30] hallelujah
[1:08:32] and a revelation is something that has
[1:08:35] to be made known
[1:08:37] amen
[1:08:39] it's closed up
[1:08:41] until the latter times
[1:08:45] the whole mystery of god
[1:08:47] has been closed up
[1:08:50] until
[1:08:51] the latter time hallelujah or praise god
[1:08:56] but he put it out like in a
[1:08:59] actor's form he means like a drama
[1:09:02] amen yes see and he he speaks it
[1:09:07] as it were in parables
[1:09:11] amen and he'll speak of it
[1:09:14] in the form like a beast here or a beast
[1:09:18] there
[1:09:19] he'll he'll he'll portray it as an
[1:09:21] animal
[1:09:23] right like that and so forth but he's
[1:09:26] doing it in an act or in a drama
[1:09:31] see oh my think of it and these ones
[1:09:36] they all began back in the first church
[1:09:39] age
[1:09:41] because all these ages
[1:09:44] it's christ
[1:09:45] revealing himself to the seven church
[1:09:49] ages
[1:09:50] amen remember that it's christ
[1:09:54] but at the end of the church age
[1:09:58] the seventh angel's message picks it up
[1:10:03] picks up all the lost mysteries
[1:10:05] and gives it back to the church
[1:10:08] amen
[1:10:10] not
[1:10:11] then
[1:10:12] revealed
[1:10:14] in their true state
[1:10:17] he gives back the revelation
[1:10:20] of what was lost in the past
[1:10:24] and he leaves it but listen what he says
[1:10:27] but it is not
[1:10:29] then revealed
[1:10:31] in
[1:10:32] their true state
[1:10:34] you can go back read it study it for
[1:10:36] yourself in the seven seals where he
[1:10:40] spoke of this amen see that's the way it
[1:10:44] was
[1:10:46] because these mysteries were back there
[1:10:50] even in the bible times
[1:10:53] right they were there
[1:10:55] and they're seeing these things happen
[1:10:58] but they're seeing it the same way john
[1:11:01] seen it in other words they've seen it
[1:11:03] in types and symbols the
[1:11:06] the mystery was not veiled to them but
[1:11:08] there's a people that god is going to
[1:11:11] unveil it and it says those people are
[1:11:13] going to be especially in the latter
[1:11:15] times that they're going to have a clear
[1:11:18] understanding of what it was all about
[1:11:21] amen because a revelation is a mystery
[1:11:24] mysterious secret that was once hidden
[1:11:28] but now mad plain
[1:11:30] hallelujah brother ben said he spoke it
[1:11:33] he delivered it but it's all brought
[1:11:35] forth but not yet in its true state
[1:11:39] hallelujah what's it going to take to
[1:11:41] put it in its true state the holy spirit
[1:11:45] hallelujah
[1:11:47] amen
[1:11:48] see my friends
[1:11:50] the mystery comes but then what they
[1:11:54] don't know
[1:11:55] they didn't know
[1:11:57] but it's
[1:11:58] to be revealed
[1:12:00] it's to be made known
[1:12:03] hallelujah praise god glory to god they
[1:12:07] presume that it
[1:12:09] hallelujah because they saw symbols of
[1:12:13] it
[1:12:15] and so they presumed that what that
[1:12:17] meant
[1:12:18] oh my see
[1:12:20] but they did not understand
[1:12:23] glory to god hallelujah and it's the
[1:12:26] same way with the seven thunders
[1:12:31] they didn't know
[1:12:33] what the thunders were saved
[1:12:36] they knew there were seven thunders they
[1:12:38] could say seven thunders they could say
[1:12:41] all the seven thunders this and the
[1:12:43] sevens understand but that did not know
[1:12:46] what the seven thunders were saying
[1:12:49] they didn't know what it is hallelujah
[1:12:52] they presumed at what the thunders was
[1:12:55] saying
[1:12:56] was it saying virtues
[1:13:00] was it saying this was it saying that
[1:13:02] was the same power was it telling you
[1:13:06] about power coming later on were you
[1:13:08] going to speak on arms was it saying
[1:13:10] that they did not understand
[1:13:13] we're not saying that they were wrong or
[1:13:17] or something like that what we're saying
[1:13:19] is that they misunderstood
[1:13:22] and it was not the time for it to make
[1:13:25] itself known you he said here remember
[1:13:29] the voices of those thunders
[1:13:32] john was forbidden to write
[1:13:34] amen he could not write the full truth
[1:13:40] he could not write the full truth
[1:13:43] later on he's going to tell us why he
[1:13:46] couldn't write the full truth amen right
[1:13:49] but here it is because john himself did
[1:13:54] not get the full revelation of the seals
[1:13:58] he didn't get a full revelation he was
[1:14:00] seeing the forms and the symbols and
[1:14:02] everything else but he didn't get a full
[1:14:04] revelation of what the seals were
[1:14:07] hallelujah because the seal broke
[1:14:10] amen and when the seal broke it
[1:14:13] thundered in other words a voice spoke
[1:14:16] amen whose voice the voice of the mighty
[1:14:19] angel amen but the bible tells you when
[1:14:22] he comes down and he spoke his voice was
[1:14:26] seven thunders blasting out amen and the
[1:14:30] thunder and lightning when he spoke the
[1:14:32] word of god it was the voice of the
[1:14:35] mighty angels hallelujah speaking out
[1:14:38] and john didn't get a full revelation he
[1:14:43] could only hear the voice saying come
[1:14:46] and see
[1:14:49] he couldn't come and understand what
[1:14:53] john come and see hallelujah and so
[1:14:58] john would then go
[1:15:00] and look
[1:15:01] hallelujah
[1:15:02] but when he looked all he could see was
[1:15:05] a symbol
[1:15:06] he couldn't see the full revelation of
[1:15:09] it he could see a white horse riding out
[1:15:12] with a with a with a bar without a ball
[1:15:15] and then he has to presume
[1:15:18] of what that really meant
[1:15:20] but he did not get the full
[1:15:23] revelation of it and as i've preached
[1:15:27] before so through the ages many have
[1:15:30] presumed through them seven church ages
[1:15:34] presuming at the truth
[1:15:37] of what the truth
[1:15:38] of the word was i remember reading
[1:15:42] writings
[1:15:44] dr uriah smith
[1:15:47] reading from
[1:15:49] the so-called prophetess of the
[1:15:51] adventists
[1:15:53] ellen g white
[1:15:55] reading the writings
[1:15:58] of
[1:15:59] charles
[1:16:00] russell of the
[1:16:02] jehovah witnesses
[1:16:05] and even
[1:16:06] reading writings of joseph smith
[1:16:10] the founder of the mormons
[1:16:12] now
[1:16:13] i want you to understand all these
[1:16:15] people had good intent
[1:16:18] they had good intentions
[1:16:20] they were trying to accomplish something
[1:16:22] for god
[1:16:23] what they presumed on the world
[1:16:27] and their presumptions were wrong
[1:16:30] it was com
[1:16:32] completely out of the walk of god i
[1:16:35] don't mean everything that said was
[1:16:36] wrong
[1:16:38] but the direction in which they're going
[1:16:40] they were out of whack with the word of
[1:16:42] god because you if you ever did you
[1:16:44] don't need to do it but if you ever did
[1:16:47] you'll find that they they have a little
[1:16:49] truth there truth their truth their
[1:16:51] truth there amen because god led me a
[1:16:54] certain way from my youth god allowed me
[1:16:57] to be friends with the adventist friends
[1:16:59] with the motherless friends within
[1:17:00] nazarene friends with the pilgrimage as
[1:17:03] friends with the breadwinner and when
[1:17:04] they have revivals i will go into their
[1:17:06] churches and even now some of my friends
[1:17:09] are now way up almost head of the
[1:17:11] adventist church and so on in different
[1:17:15] places and the thing about it is
[1:17:18] back then we didn't fight
[1:17:22] i go to the adventist church they know
[1:17:23] what i believe and i'm listening to
[1:17:25] their preaching on prophecy
[1:17:28] they come and they listen to what i'm
[1:17:30] preaching
[1:17:31] uh go over to the baptist there that's
[1:17:33] another one there the young man is now
[1:17:36] head of the baptist organization then
[1:17:39] and my friends we were listening because
[1:17:43] we all wanted the word
[1:17:45] but everyone has to find their position
[1:17:49] and god positioned me to follow this
[1:17:52] word and this message of this hour
[1:17:56] because i come through pentecost
[1:17:59] i've seen the power of god in the lives
[1:18:01] of others
[1:18:02] and others have seen the power of god
[1:18:05] walking through this life
[1:18:07] hallelujah oh my from from teenage right
[1:18:12] to this hour the power and the presence
[1:18:14] of almighty god hallelujah amen you say
[1:18:18] you're talking about it now yeah we're
[1:18:20] in the word form of the manifestation of
[1:18:23] the word we don't have to go producing
[1:18:26] miracles to to to show you we are in the
[1:18:28] world that's not where it's at now
[1:18:31] them things are good but that's not
[1:18:33] where it is at now it's the word coming
[1:18:36] out of you by revelation that identifies
[1:18:40] you who you are and where you come from
[1:18:43] amen praise god so they were presuming
[1:18:47] all these marvelous wonderful people
[1:18:49] brother branham talked of some of them
[1:18:52] clarence larkin
[1:18:54] amen
[1:18:55] great outlines on the dispensation of
[1:18:58] ages and
[1:18:59] things like that but there weren't
[1:19:02] exactly right it took a profit to go
[1:19:05] back and even read the writings of some
[1:19:08] of these people and then he will see the
[1:19:10] full truth of it and then he will
[1:19:11] outline that
[1:19:13] uh just this week i was reading somebody
[1:19:15] trying to accuse the prophet of copying
[1:19:18] uh
[1:19:19] clarence lock in but they don't
[1:19:20] understand that he had to gather up the
[1:19:23] lost things and from the lost things
[1:19:27] like like i've tried to tell a lot of
[1:19:29] people you think that brother branham
[1:19:31] sat in the room and all the revelations
[1:19:33] just came to him like that
[1:19:35] some came that way but other things the
[1:19:38] angel would tell him go and look here go
[1:19:41] over there turn to this scripture and
[1:19:43] look there
[1:19:45] go read over there and then he would sit
[1:19:48] in the room and then all them things
[1:19:50] will come together and the full truth
[1:19:52] will flow right out from it amen praise
[1:19:55] god so i want you to understand that
[1:19:58] praise god of what god did and hear my
[1:20:02] friends that they were presuming amen
[1:20:06] hallelujah
[1:20:07] excuse me continuing
[1:20:10] but that mystery now
[1:20:12] what it was
[1:20:14] they did not know
[1:20:16] see
[1:20:17] because
[1:20:18] it was to be
[1:20:20] revealed hallelujah oh praise god the
[1:20:24] lamb
[1:20:26] had to reveal it after he leaves that
[1:20:30] time of intercessory back there because
[1:20:34] he knew there were names on that book
[1:20:37] hallelujah
[1:20:39] and names in there that were on there
[1:20:43] from before the foundation of the world
[1:20:47] hallelujah praise god
[1:20:49] men of all ages have paid a great price
[1:20:53] pay the great price just to know if the
[1:20:57] name was on that book
[1:21:00] but none of the rest of them knew
[1:21:02] i'm thinking of charles wesley
[1:21:05] the brother of uh john wesley and you
[1:21:09] know the one was inspired to preach and
[1:21:12] the other one was anointed and inspired
[1:21:15] to write hymns and songs and to play
[1:21:18] musical instruments and he is the one
[1:21:21] that wrote the great hymn
[1:21:24] is my name written there
[1:21:27] on the page
[1:21:28] white and fair
[1:21:30] in the book of thy kingdom
[1:21:33] is my name
[1:21:35] written
[1:21:36] there
[1:21:37] see they weren't certain
[1:21:39] of their name being on the book
[1:21:42] but what a difference to you to whom the
[1:21:45] word of god is revealed and it's being
[1:21:49] revealed that you can recognize this and
[1:21:52] you with the in the words of the prophet
[1:21:55] become certain of god
[1:21:58] amen you're recognized and you're
[1:22:00] certain of god
[1:22:02] hallelujah praise god oh my whether it's
[1:22:07] brother philip over here what is brother
[1:22:10] bill whether it's brother brad over
[1:22:12] there it doesn't matter what's going on
[1:22:14] in your life these problems different
[1:22:17] things comes brother bill different
[1:22:19] things come to you brother hallelujah
[1:22:21] god bless you but let me tell you it is
[1:22:25] god who looks at the man on the inside
[1:22:28] hallelujah and says your name is on that
[1:22:32] book
[1:22:33] [Applause]
[1:22:34] hallelujah praise god you see i i've
[1:22:38] thought on that before it's not just
[1:22:41] your
[1:22:42] condition that you're presently in
[1:22:44] people are judging people by the
[1:22:47] condition that they're presently in
[1:22:50] right
[1:22:51] oh he's drinking oh he's smoking oh he's
[1:22:53] lying he's that
[1:22:55] that may be so
[1:22:57] but
[1:22:58] it is not your condition on which your
[1:23:00] salvation is based it is your position
[1:23:04] right
[1:23:06] this is what jesus meant when he said he
[1:23:08] says yes a servant i can fire and i can
[1:23:12] drive out of the house forever for doing
[1:23:14] something wrong but a son he abideth in
[1:23:17] the house forever
[1:23:20] amen there's a difference between a
[1:23:23] sinning son
[1:23:26] and a sinner
[1:23:28] you got me
[1:23:30] your son make a mistake
[1:23:32] it don't matter how much you don't like
[1:23:34] him you want to put him out you want to
[1:23:36] do this you want to do you can't change
[1:23:39] your original he's already a son
[1:23:42] he's already a daughter you run your
[1:23:44] child of god in that you can't change
[1:23:47] you're gonna deal with him you're gonna
[1:23:49] work it out you're gonna do what you
[1:23:50] have to do but he and she is still a son
[1:23:54] and a daughter of the living god your
[1:23:56] position doesn't change
[1:23:59] your conditions may change with time and
[1:24:03] problems and trials temptations this
[1:24:07] that in your life but your position
[1:24:10] hallelujah of who you are remains
[1:24:13] forever because you come from eternity
[1:24:17] and you're going back to eternity and
[1:24:19] god said i'm not gonna lose one
[1:24:22] that's in the palm of my hand
[1:24:25] your name in the book he's not gonna
[1:24:27] lose one
[1:24:29] one of joseph's bones are going out of
[1:24:32] here
[1:24:33] [Music]
[1:24:35] every one of joseph's bones will not be
[1:24:39] left in this egyptian night but it's
[1:24:41] going right back to god where it come
[1:24:43] from
[1:24:44] glory to god hallelujah amen praise god
[1:24:49] god bless you all for being here today
[1:24:52] by the grace of god hallelujah amen john
[1:24:57] looked and saw that bloody bleeding lamb
[1:25:02] come through the great battle down in
[1:25:04] hell hallelujah and come back amen
[1:25:08] bleeding and dying for us hallelujah
[1:25:12] amen but my friends those names are all
[1:25:16] sealed in the book
[1:25:18] hallelujah john knew names are in the
[1:25:21] book but he didn't know and they didn't
[1:25:24] know that for sure that their names were
[1:25:27] there they believe unto
[1:25:30] eternal life they believe unto it
[1:25:32] hallelujah by the grace of god amen yes
[1:25:36] sir oh my i tell you john screamed
[1:25:41] hallelujah he just gave out a great
[1:25:44] scream amen hallelujah because god gave
[1:25:49] him what
[1:25:50] a revelation
[1:25:52] just like you had to have a revelation
[1:25:56] brother i had to have a revelation you
[1:25:58] got to have a revelation that your name
[1:26:02] is on the book amen
[1:26:04] and john at that point
[1:26:07] caught the revelation that his name was
[1:26:10] on that book and that is why john
[1:26:12] screamed hallelujah amen he knows there
[1:26:15] were many other names there but he saw
[1:26:17] his name
[1:26:18] praise god there's lots of other
[1:26:20] people's name there but god is not
[1:26:22] asking about other people is your name
[1:26:24] written there
[1:26:26] hallelujah have you caught the
[1:26:28] revelation that your name is written
[1:26:31] there within that great lamb's book of
[1:26:34] life hallelujah oh praise god amen
[1:26:38] praise god did he see his name written
[1:26:41] there
[1:26:42] j o h n
[1:26:45] no
[1:26:46] not like that
[1:26:48] but he saw himself fulfilling the word
[1:26:51] for his age
[1:26:54] and by him fulfilling the word for his
[1:26:58] age
[1:26:59] it made him know
[1:27:00] that his name was in that book because
[1:27:04] he is doing what he is supposed to do
[1:27:09] not consciously but unconsciously
[1:27:12] something made him do what he was doing
[1:27:15] and he was fulfilling the word by
[1:27:17] revelation
[1:27:20] hallelujah
[1:27:21] that's why the devil can't mess with the
[1:27:24] third poem
[1:27:26] because it's not my system not by
[1:27:29] knowledge not by study not my wisdom
[1:27:32] though those things are wonderful but
[1:27:34] it's not by that it's by the revelation
[1:27:36] of god
[1:27:38] it can be here and anytime you move like
[1:27:41] lightning it flashes this way that way
[1:27:43] that way that way it speaks to anyone at
[1:27:46] any time and it will send the devil
[1:27:49] crazy because that lightning moving ever
[1:27:52] what
[1:27:53] he doesn't know what's going on is god
[1:27:55] moving by his spirit
[1:27:57] making the word of god known amen
[1:28:00] hallelujah we know of course that
[1:28:02] brother branham didn't break the seals
[1:28:03] how many knows that
[1:28:06] let's write in the bible the lamb broke
[1:28:09] the seal
[1:28:11] i mean
[1:28:12] i say it myself but when i say it i know
[1:28:15] what i'm saying
[1:28:16] right and when you say it you must know
[1:28:18] what you are saying
[1:28:20] because it's the lamb himself
[1:28:22] broke the seals
[1:28:24] no man in heaven on earth that search to
[1:28:26] find a man and no man couldn't break the
[1:28:28] seal so not even brother branham could
[1:28:31] break the seals so when those seals were
[1:28:33] being opened it was what it was christ
[1:28:38] it was revealing christ
[1:28:40] hallelujah and brother branham was just
[1:28:43] used as a humble instrument that god
[1:28:46] could come
[1:28:47] and speak his word true for the spirit
[1:28:51] speaks through the prophet
[1:28:53] and the holy spirit the great god of
[1:28:56] heaven was able to find a vessel
[1:28:59] that he was predestinated for known and
[1:29:02] placed in this season in time that he
[1:29:04] could use to make known his word and
[1:29:07] fulfill
[1:29:10] the word in revelation 10 7 and malachi
[1:29:14] 4 5 amen hallelujah praise the name of
[1:29:18] the lord and in whatever ages these
[1:29:20] people came up in
[1:29:23] the elect of that age
[1:29:26] had to catch a revelation for their age
[1:29:32] to see that they were fulfilling the
[1:29:34] word whether it's gesture lived by faith
[1:29:36] fulfilling the word whether it's
[1:29:38] holiness fulfilling the word whether
[1:29:40] it's well you know no real pentecostal
[1:29:44] is still alive
[1:29:46] how many knows that
[1:29:48] no real original pentecostals are still
[1:29:50] alive
[1:29:51] these ones are make believe
[1:29:53] they're having miracle signs wonders
[1:29:55] that's marvelous but
[1:29:57] they're not the genuine elected seed of
[1:30:01] god no those ones are dead
[1:30:04] they're already dead their age is over
[1:30:07] and gone with completely amen because on
[1:30:11] that day of pentecost the apostles
[1:30:13] screamed because they realized they were
[1:30:16] fulfilling joel 2 28 they actually
[1:30:19] realized that they were the fulfillment
[1:30:22] of the word taking place for their day
[1:30:26] hallelujah so it's not they have to
[1:30:28] write read their name on a book but they
[1:30:31] see their position in christ hallelujah
[1:30:35] oh my just as we are to see our position
[1:30:38] right now for his glory that we are not
[1:30:41] in these church ages
[1:30:43] hallelujah glory to god though we pass
[1:30:46] through them but we are not of the
[1:30:49] church ages glory to god hallelujah amen
[1:30:53] glory to god hallelujah amen brother
[1:30:57] sister i'm so thankful in this age
[1:31:01] that only a rapture people
[1:31:05] are people predestinated for the rapture
[1:31:08] are going to recognize their name in the
[1:31:12] book
[1:31:12] by the life they live according to this
[1:31:15] word fulfilling the word for their day
[1:31:19] and for their hour and the more we look
[1:31:23] into the word
[1:31:25] it'll be like the
[1:31:27] boy that looked into the mirror
[1:31:30] god's word is a mirror you know that he
[1:31:33] looked into the mirror
[1:31:35] and after a while
[1:31:37] he starts seeing himself
[1:31:41] my
[1:31:42] i thought he was only talking about
[1:31:43] jesus i thought it was only talking
[1:31:46] about this or that the other then you
[1:31:48] start seeing it was it is talking about
[1:31:51] you
[1:31:52] right it may be also talking about jesus
[1:31:55] or this one or that one but he's talking
[1:31:57] about you
[1:31:59] and then you ain't imagining you
[1:32:03] literally see yourself
[1:32:05] positioned in the word
[1:32:07] hallelujah you see yourself positioned
[1:32:10] in the word of god hallelujah praise god
[1:32:15] you know sometimes when i'm preaching
[1:32:17] like this
[1:32:18] do you think that i just preaching and
[1:32:20] that's wonderful victory
[1:32:22] no the devil constantly coming is it you
[1:32:25] know are they going to understand are
[1:32:27] they going to think you're crazy
[1:32:30] uh
[1:32:31] yes he's talking all the time while i'm
[1:32:32] preaching to you
[1:32:34] and saying and he said where do you get
[1:32:36] that from what what what are you talking
[1:32:38] about
[1:32:39] this and that and the all kinds of stuff
[1:32:41] it comes bombarding against you while
[1:32:43] you are trying to bring forth the truth
[1:32:46] of the word of god but i am certain of
[1:32:48] what i am seeing
[1:32:51] and so i'm saying it to you that you
[1:32:54] might recognize hallelujah praise god
[1:32:58] what it is that you are getting a hold
[1:33:01] of amen lord of god you cannot take this
[1:33:05] rapture with doubt in your heart
[1:33:08] amen
[1:33:09] doubt in your heart doubt about the word

[1:33:26] message of this hour you can't go in the
[1:33:29] rapture with any doubt within your heart
[1:33:33] praise god no doubt about it you got to
[1:33:36] have a full confidence and assurance
[1:33:40] within your soul no shadow of a doubt
[1:33:43] that your name is on the lamb's book of
[1:33:46] life
[1:33:48] hallelujah praise god amen lord of god i
[1:33:53] think uh brother sister i believe i'm
[1:33:55] going to stop here now because i've got
[1:33:58] a lot more to say and if you don't mind
[1:34:01] if you will permit me or allow me then i
[1:34:04] will continue in the next week and allow
[1:34:08] god to have his way within your heart
[1:34:11] and life is that okay
[1:34:12] we have a lot of baptism here also
[1:34:15] praise god and
[1:34:17] that will take place
[1:34:19] now
[1:34:21] and we want to give god the glory for
[1:34:23] that glory to his marvelous and
[1:34:25] wonderful name brother sister i am
[1:34:27] thanking god
[1:34:29] beyond any measure that my eyes have
[1:34:32] been opened
[1:34:34] the eyes of my heart has been open that
[1:34:37] i can recognize the word and the day
[1:34:40] that i'm living in to some people who
[1:34:42] even follow this message it's just a
[1:34:44] light thing
[1:34:46] right they just hear it and
[1:34:48] well it's religious it's nice makes me a
[1:34:50] good no it's more than that
[1:34:53] it's life and when you see it the right
[1:34:55] way when you see it the way god wants
[1:34:58] you to see it
[1:34:59] as like david said it's more than life
[1:35:02] to me
[1:35:04] it means natural life
[1:35:05] it's more than life to me
[1:35:08] amen because that other life
[1:35:12] that's eternal
[1:35:14] this one we have here
[1:35:16] is only for a period of time
[1:35:19] and a matter of fact when this one ends

[1:35:31] breaking right back into it and we're
[1:35:34] doing it even now while we are seated
[1:35:37] here for the bible tells us we are not
[1:35:40] going to prevent them that are asleep
[1:35:44] because there are certain people going
[1:35:45] to be alive at the rapture
[1:35:49] the prophet is telling us some
[1:35:51] are not going to be dead
[1:35:54] but they're going to be alive
[1:35:57] and while they're alive
[1:35:59] they shall be changed
[1:36:02] see simon i'm not feeling that you don't
[1:36:04] have to feel it he said do you believe
[1:36:06] it
[1:36:07] you're being changed
[1:36:09] praise god matter of fact i don't want
[1:36:11] to go back in the quotes i got got the
[1:36:13] quote brother brown said change from
[1:36:15] glory he said you're being changed from
[1:36:17] glory on to glory unto glory
[1:36:21] hallelujah i've said it over and over
[1:36:23] but he is saying it you'll change by
[1:36:26] god's power to transform
[1:36:28] hallelujah in other words it's like me
[1:36:31] going and looking
[1:36:33] at brad over here and said let me look
[1:36:35] at him tonight and see how much he's
[1:36:37] going to grow is as much as you're going
[1:36:38] to look at the plant
[1:36:41] to see how many inches it's going to
[1:36:43] grow overnight
[1:36:45] right and look as if the moment you're
[1:36:46] not like listening look back up the
[1:36:48] thing gone up three inches
[1:36:50] when did that grow see god has his own
[1:36:52] way of doing things
[1:36:54] and he just said in the word
[1:36:56] you will be changed from glory on to
[1:36:59] glory
[1:37:00] and we are being changed right now a lot
[1:37:03] of people say oh the rapture on the
[1:37:04] rapture day all of a sudden you change
[1:37:06] right then now that is the instant
[1:37:09] completion
[1:37:10] of what is already in progression
[1:37:13] is that right it's already in
[1:37:14] progression you're being changed the

[1:39:46] but
[1:39:47] they're going to make it the same way
[1:39:48] that every son and daughter makes it
[1:39:51] and that is to receive the revelation
[1:39:53] from god that they are
[1:39:55] a daughter or a son of god
