any kind of Finance or anything as a matter of fact the streets will be gold and we'd be walking on it it'll just be the perfect place but in the meantime there's a war on there's a battle on and we want to contribute and be the soldiers in the war so we're we're doing what your word says bring in our ties bring in our offerings and we ask you to bless Lord because your word also says when we do

your word this morning thank you Lord bless it bless meet every single need in this place we pray in Jesus name praise God praise God as you give your offering give him a hand clap Hallelujah okay let's go to uh a flat we're so glad to see that our pastor is back with us and we're glad that he went and had a a good uh a good time rest and relaxation I believe he did some Ministry and whatnot but we'll hear about that but we're glad he's back anyway and uh may God just bless him and you know I was reading this morning uh uh Psalm 92 where it said I I will be Anointed with fresh oil and even in thy and I'm not saying pinning us on anybody but even in my old age you'll bring forth fruit praise God how many old people can say praise God for that amen well let's sing this one there's no one there's no one like Jesus there's no one there's no one like him oh there's no one there's no one like Jesus there's no one there's no one like him well I searched everywhere no one I turned everywhere no one no one I searched everywhere no one no one there's no one there's no one like him oh there's no one There's No One Like Jesus there's no one there's no one like him no one like Jesus there's no one there's no one like him the original line the original sin the original word is what I believe the son of man is revealed that 17 is come on let's sing it one person God's attributes were manifested to his right in this last stage we have caught the Revelation by the last prophet's message and we know who we are and what we're raised up for praise the Lord the original line the original line the original sea the original word [Music] the son of man is [Music] and I am one of the few one of the few and my faith in God's word I can claim it though the way may seem long the opposition strong for the brothers away provided if I plan to go through just to hope it will not do I must be firmly decided [Music] alone [Music] I'm one of the few and by faith in God's word I can claiming though the way may seem long the opposition shrunk for his brother so waiting providing and to go through just to hope it will not do our minds [Music] God bless you Pastor Simon thank you brother Mike God bless you happy to be back in the house of the Lord with the saints of God God bless you please be seated it's certainly wonderful to be here and to worship with you in the house of the Lord last week at this time I would have been in the pulpit in Grenada uh there they served the service starts at 10 A.M and uh goes on as long as this needs to be and praise the lord we were there Pastor Padgett Graham and there we saw sister Susanna and brother Fitzroy are all receive their conversion marriage or whatever else right here in this church and they're they're a blessing there and we thank the Lord for the work that he has done and is doing in that church there uh I will comment on these things and bring the various uh maybe pictures on Wednesday night uh I'll show that to you as we give glory and praise to God Amen but I'm just so happy to be back and to share with you the grace of God God is good isn't he praise the Lord so I give him glory and honor and praise praise God hallelujah amen so I'll go to the word I'm not going to you know talk around different things right now we'll do that maybe on Wednesday night but to the word of God my intent was to bring a different kind of message but all of a sudden this is what God tells me to say and it might be to some people um something of controversy controversy some may not like it Others May I don't know but all I have to do is to bring it because you know preachers are just God's Postman I don't bother kicking the postman after you read the bad news from somewhere else you know you get the bad news and then you want to beat up the postman the postman didn't send the letter he didn't write the letter he just delivering the letter and that's all we are here to do is to deliver the letter is that right praise God so once you understand that then I feel free that nobody will run up here and try to pull me down or anything like that like uh a certain Bishop over there in the United States when I was preaching and he didn't like what I was saying and he didn't even walk up the aisle he was coming across the on top the pews it was that mad but God by his grace just kept us and preserved us to this day and time we give God the praise and honor and Glory our scripture is found in Hebrews chapter 7. Hebrews chapter 7 and we will read from verse 1. right down to verse 10. and read with your understanding not just reading like you're reading a novel think about what you're reading as you see it up there praise the Lord I have it in front of me here I can open this but I have it printed out here okay so I'm going from this a gracious father as we about to read the written word we pray that your spirit will hover over it may the great light of God that hung above the Ark of it of the Covenant may he Lord just hang over this Covenant of your word and may the Holy Spirit of almighty God shed forth upon us your matchless grace for we ask it in no other name but in the mighty name of our Majesty the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen and amen for this Melchizedek king of Salem Priests of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that king of Salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither the beginning of days nor the end of life but made like unto the Son of God abided a priest continually now consider this great man amen well this great man was unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tent of the spoils and verily they that are the sons of the sons of Levi who receive the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren through they come out of the loins of Abraham but he whose descent is not conquered from them receive signs of Abraham and bless him that had the promises and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better and here men that receive tithes that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them of whom it is witness he live at and as I may so say Levi also who receive tithes paid tithes in Abraham for he was not while he while he was yet in the loins of his father for he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him praise the Lord my topic today is God's teaching on tithing please be seated why after all this marvelous parade of deep Supernatural things the Holy Spirit would swing my attention to something like that I don't know I am just following what the holy because I've preached on this many times years ago and different messages along this line and at this time you're thinking that real Christians already should know all this stuff so you don't bother with that you keep going into all but no come back and speak on this amen so that's what I am doing here and God will speak to you and fulfill his own purposes and his own plans what he has in his mind uh the first thing is here first I can go to the scripture that we read here and just give a quick run of this not touching on it but it's saying here that Abraham paid tithes to this one who is eternal no beginning no ending it's plainly there and that person of course is God but he was appearing in a body like unto the sun right he appeared in a body like that that was the theophany god's theophany condescending before it could turn into actual flesh right it wasn't a theophonic condition or state at that particular time before it came to be Jesus Christ amen so we know Jesus Christ is the same Melchizedek all right I made manifest In the Flesh right brother Brandon priests that wonderful message who is this Melchizedek amen praise the Lord think on that but glory be to his wonderful name the Bible says here this consider how great this man was making sure that that you know it was a man right but in the inside of what appeared to be a man was God right now but considering how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tent of the spoils and they that are the sons of Levi who have received the office of the priesthood or as a pastor or Minister have a commandment they have a commandment if we say don't obey that commandment of accepting tithes from God's people there will now become guilty if they don't preach on it if they don't instruct the people on it they become the guilty ones it's right in the scripture praise the Lord now um uh tides of the people according to the law that is of their Brethren praise the Lord though they come out of the loins of Abraham they are just as much Christian as you are but yet they turn around and they pay tithes to you right in the as a representative of God but who he he who's this sentence not counted from them receive tithes of Abraham and blessed him that had the promises is showing that God didn't have to receive no tithes he don't need anything he owns the whole world but he was showing you an example of what you are supposed to do whatever believer is supposed to do because you see type Abraham is the father of the faithful and the father paid tithes to Melchizedek is that right and now uh you say oh I I have faith I believe God right now if you believe God and you are or believe you are a son or a daughter of God and that you like Levi paid times when he was Abraham representatively right he was in Abraham so when Abraham paid tithes it shows Levi who's coming after him that believes like he believes will also pay tithes and if then a person does not pay times they're really showing their real origin they didn't come from the loins of Abraham they come from somewhere else but not from Abraham now of course I'll speak and expand a little more just that now without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them of whom it is witness he liveth as I may also say Levi who received times bad times in Abraham while he was unborn and yet in Abraham praise the Lord for for he was yet in the lines of his father when Melchizedek met him praise the Lord okay I'll stop there and I'll go this way now this subject might be a bit controversial and most pastors don't like speaking on it because the devil is such a cunning person that he'll Twisted the wrong and make it seem like the pastor is preaching on that because he wants to receive and let me I'll talk plainly with you is that okay or he wants to receive all this money so so so he's going to break John tines to stir up everybody to really give so that he could get uh like that so it becomes a controversial and touchy subject that most pastors don't want to give on it but thank God I'm retiring at the end of the year so you understand I am not saying it here now because I want to get anything from anybody and even when I was not retiring I did not have I never have had any motive like that from since I was Teenage to this very day and time never praise the Lord now this person asked brother Branham a question and if you listen and if you're spiritual you can catch what is unspoken and what is behind the question listen brother Branham should a person pay tithes to an individual or should that Christian work you understand really brother Brown didn't break that down he just the question came and then he started answering it but the point is this person is really maybe looking at their pastor and saying why should I be paying tithes to an individual why don't he go out and find a job like me see how hard I work and all he does on a Sunday is get in the Pulpit preach for about a hour and come down and then he's got paid all these tides my goodness I wish I could be a preacher myself and that's the reason why we have all these copycats and impersonators that God didn't call they went but they weren't sent they're not armed with the word of God they're not armed with the things of the message of the defeat the Devil in every turn he takes amen but praise the Lord a true man of God will stand by the word of God Amen brother Brandon is answering now sure he should and one man that will work will be a Christian any man that's a Christian will work did you hear that listen praise the Lord now but the other part pay tithes to an individual it depends on who the individual is because in Hebrews 7 the first time Tidings were ever talked about or pain wait a minute see now in Hebrews 7 chapter Abraham returning from the slaughter of Kings met Melchizedek and paired him a tide that was Melchizedek king of Salem which was no body but God himself amen you believe that amen was nobody but God himself praise the Lord see oh praise God now let me back up a bit the Bible says Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek first time this was ever done or talked about in the Bible praise the Lord now you got to remember Abraham paid tithes before the law amen and this will pertain well we've had some people many years ago not now left the church because they don't believe that tithing is a new testament teaching it's all Testament and that's passed away so we don't have to tithe anymore and we can keep our money for ourselves and just Prosper like that you see but listen Abraham didn't fit tights under the law Abraham peptides by revelation uh brother Branham said it somewhere else on a quote where he said Abraham paid Ties on the grace and I understand that because what he's saying is revelation is by Grace you don't make it up or you don't go and study together it comes by grace so when Abraham paid by Revelation he was paying tithes on the grace praise the Lord which he says brother Branham is saying it here before the law before the law even existed or Moses was even on the scene Abraham paid tithes so paying ties was even before the law in other words it's got nothing to do with the Old Testament and all them laws and things that God gave to to the people he gave it to them because they wanted it and they needed it Hallelujah but the true belief of prefigured by Abraham doesn't need laws doesn't need none of those things all they need is the Revelation and the direction of the Holy Spirit of what to do how to act and then they act upon that word that God has placed within their own heart so we are not a people of law and Abraham paid it under uh the Covenant of Grace amen hallelujah and he baptized praise the Lord and thank God for that amen so we understand that it's all by Revelation through the holy spirit amen now when you pay tithes really you all tidings but the place where you get your food where you get your spiritual food that's where you owe your Tides that's where you ought to pay your tithes is that right praise the name of the Lord hallelujah many of you know I've used the illustration many times that something that the Lord placed in my heart and I just say it now you don't go like last night was the uh birth the birth day of my um my uh granddaughter and so uh the mother and dad took her out and they invited us when we turned up it was a surprise to her right and we we had a wonderful spread I know you would have liked to be there but you couldn't but anyway it was marvelous ice cream everything else you think mixed into it and we really enjoyed it and when it was all over I noticed the dad left and went to the front and and there he paid and they're wondering well why is he paying at this restaurant I know he likes the other restaurant up the road that why didn't he go over there and pay but you see that's what a lot of Christians do they received their food under the ministry of one pastor and one Church and uh when they their Joy is a real blessing and everything else and then they leave and they go to another restaurant that they admire and go pay over there means of the year but you know what even the cops the police would come and arrest you for doing that because it's not even naturally right much less for you to do something like that spiritually right absolutely wrong and you're guilty if you do anything like that praise the Lord hallelujah but I'm a pastor I'm a pastor I don't really have to pay tithes where you heard that every believer ought to peptides every minister in here and anywhere else Let Me Maybe hearing me or the bad times say but I don't see where the pastor paid times I don't see where this one Faith times I don't know you see they must spare time Hallelujah we'll touch on that later but the point of it is they must do it like anybody else every Christian has to do that amen I'm okay but many times the pastor doesn't put back his ties in the church so that they will go around and come back to him you see sometimes he has to go send it off to missionaries sometimes you go send it off to help voice to God or you send it here where he knows there is a need and you don't know anything about that or something happens somewhere constantly doing that but he has to pay tithes and he must be tights and any minister of men of God must baptized and if he's not doing that he is guilty in the presence of almighty God for we must pay days according to the word which the Bible says where the Prophet says where you all tied things is where you get your food bring you all the tithes into my store I'll say it the Lord Malachi praise the Lord you believe that [Applause] amen and prove me hallelujah praise the Lord the fact that God is saying prove me that just tells you already you know some people gonna doubt some people are going to question some people are going to wonder but he said well okay you don't believe me prove me prove me and Truth I'm paying your times you're not really trying him improving him you may pay your tithes and you think by paying your tithes you are God is obligated to you God is not obligated to nobody he's not obligated to you you're going to give him the world give him back to him what is already his own amen and then tell him that he's got an obligation you know there are people like that they give you things they give you gifts uh to bring you under a state of obligation to them praise the Lord the True Believer doesn't get to those positions where they obligated like that and God is not obligated to not answer one of your prayers God is not obligated to heal you or do nothing if he doesn't want to he knows our times he knows where he wants us to be he knows what he wants us to do all we ought to do is trust him and follow don't try to sink out figure out and analyze and all these minor things in your in your mortal mind your mind but trust the word of God that he will make all things well Hallelujah that's how you got to trust him without obligation trusting God Amen praise God prove me if I will not open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing that you would not have room enough to receive it oh my God but I bet my times and this didn't happen I paid my ties and that didn't happen I paid my tithes and I prayed and I prayed and I prayed and this didn't happen it's not based on that it's based on the Revelation you have in your heart when you pay those eyes because God is seeing your motives and your intents in your of your heart you you give it and you let it go it's not even your tithes anymore because it's not yours it's his and even what you earn what you work for is not even yours it's his because he let you get it amen he let you get a job you let you get the help to go to the job he let you have a car to go to the job he let you have the boss you have he loves eat let it all happen and you ought to give him praise and honor and Glory Hallelujah amen prove me that I won't open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing you would not have room enough to receive it amen praise the Lord Amen brother Brandon says here I challenge any man or woman that is not a Thai spear to to accept that and believe it and they'll see the hand of God but you end up being in debt and you come out from one hearing another one you know you're in debt all I mean you're wondering why some people don't pay their tithes and what happened see I'm not going to pay my ties I got to fix my car I gotta do this I gotta do that okay you do that and you keep the dive and the car get fixed and you go out with it in a week or two or even a month the same car breaks down and then you you go out and you have to pay more money than the tithes that you should have paid to go fix the same car or maybe you get sick and it takes you more money than the tithes that you robbed from God Amen now listen think of it I was just as loyally speaking of himself as I could be and I paid my tithes when I took my own money from the church here I paid my times or when I heard them campaigns you see I gave my tents oh my the campaigns grew now we're talking about thousands and thousands of people now all right from his little Church of maybe 200 people or so it's gone up to thousands of people many of them multi-millionaires in there he said I give he's kept giving his stance he says then you see it got to a place where I take it and have to give it out to other ministers to help them and gave out the rest of it to them whenever when that got much more I couldn't even do that now you're listening to me now because now we're talking multi-multi-millions coming in right and he's saying it got to when I couldn't even do that right when the then the thing I did from then on I kept 10 for myself and I gave them 90 to God is that right I kept the 10 for myself and I gave the 90 to God oh my when I did that oh the Lord came to me and told me you can't do that you have to take it that's so they can tax it what they were worried about I'm talking about the law now or the government is that he's getting all this tithing and he's giving it all away and he's given it to other ministers he's sending it overseas and only taken at that time a hundred dollars a week you couldn't live on that maybe for a day or two on that anyway but the fact is he was giving it all away and all the all of the taxes he had to pay was on 100 a week so instead of admiring a man like that they they were going the fact that they're losing out on all these millions of dollars they're not getting any taxes they say you must take it where's that in the law with the law forcing you to take money from somebody else I never asked the people for anything they just decide to give it right praise the Lord and so I couldn't do that see I you see my it was all to be charged he said here to it then I had to look for a way to bypass that Brother Brad now the Government tried to tax all those millions of dollars that were coming in and he says okay he didn't say okay sir I'll I'll just uh 10 90 or whatever and we'll just give it no he said before I do that I began to talk with the brothers and I had to and bypass it try to bypass doing that and place it into foreign missions he began to pour it out into foreign missions and so forth there may be other ideas praise the Lord and then out of that whatever went to the church I took only 100 a week so that I could pay my tithes only on that my brother Branagh why would he think of a way around the taxes right but you under you got to understand that money is really God's and he knows that that's Satan behind those governments which and you're supposed to pay your taxes and they're trying to get every bit of tax they can from you every set that can squeeze out of you but you also have the right if you can to bypass it or get around it to keep as much as you can so that you can give as much as you can and that God's kingdom could expand and be glorified amen we're not talking about stealing we're not talking about withholding from the government what is due to them but we're talking that as uh one that is wise to look at whatever is coming in to you and you do what God in this world tell you pay your tithe amen pay your tithes and you you pay your tithes and let God have the glory I want to go on expanding on that praise the Lord hallelujah amen oh my you say oh uh I believe yes sir I tell you I truly believe in paying tithes how many air believes in pain ties praise the Lord I don't ask for sure hands but a show of hearts praise the Lord raising hands could be a disguise and still you're not paying tax so I don't know it's between you and God praise the Lord yes sir I believe in pain tides it's one of God's big Cardinal thieving uh ministers thinking of itself I've messed up the whole thing until every Minister that uh people come in contact with they believe that that is their aim and their goal and the foundation of their ministry right and so they don't trust ministers and you can't blame those people but the word still stands true it don't change regardless of how men act or what men do the word doesn't change it Remains the Same hallelujah amen now that is it we must understand that some will even come and say and some have said it to me before I even read this years ago well I I don't keep that because that's of the Old Testament he said I'm here to tell you it is of the New Testament also yes sir it is praise the Lord hallelujah praise God another question would it be wrong brother brannerman to use my times on church building funds now back of that think about it this person God maybe bless them in a wonderful way and maybe like if they used to give to the tithings fifty dollars a week twenty dollars a week all of a sudden they get blessed with an inheritance two or three million and the tidings got to be thirty forty thousand fifty thousand sixty thousand seventy eighty a hundred thousand oh that's too much to give to an individual I can't give him or her that the the that person is going to get rich that person going to be able to have this or they're going to have that that's behind this thought this person is asking here would it be wrong in other words they're trying to bypass the minister and give that tithings and justify it in their heart that they're doing God's work by giving it to the building funds but he's not getting my tights that's really what's behind this right oh my think of it would it be wrong to use tights on church building funds oh my here's a touchy one I know he saw what I just said but he want to speak openly like that no a touchy thing for the church now correctly science is to go to the minister that's right in the Bible for in the Bible they had a box that they set at the door in the Old Testament the building the box was the fund where the people put in for repairing and those sorts of things you've read it many times in the Old Testament how they upkeep the buildings and things like that and all the repairs were to be taken out of that amen now we have a box out there too but we have it separated where the people will pay their tithes into the tight box and they'll give their offerings into the offering a slot that's on that box now he's telling you what it is for the times is not considered no matter how much it is to go for repairing buildings and fixing things it's to go to that minister remember I'm saying all these things because I am going and I got to preach the word what God gave to me praise the Lord see that Tidings belongs to that minister and what is Place us offering is to go for the repair the upkeep uh the the um declarations everything else of the building if you have a mortgage it's not going to help to the mortgage payment of the building is that right praise the Lord that's what it is now for myself as a minister the types come to me praise the Lord but this church has ever been set up that way because since I was a young teenager and started to preach I saw that the only nobody ever told me this but I saw it amongst all the preachers all the preachers Billy Graham was the only one I knew at that time never had any problems with the law or the government and the reason why is because he they received the monies but he only took a salary and then if he had a problem and he needed to go and use out of his his tithings then he went to news out of it as much as he wanted if he needed it he used it but other than that he took a salary that is exactly what I've done through all these years it just took a salary so when um we account to the government on don't think his brother Mike does the accounting we have outside accountants that go over everything that he did that I did whatever they go over it because their name is on the line now they gotta present that and that's got to go to the government and so they go over that and so far all these years never never had a problem nothing whatsoever not a smell because I am not around for that the men have been set in position that they will do the counting and not one person doing it several are there and they do the counting they do the banking and I am not even near to it amen they just know to issue me my salary at this certain set time they issue my salary praise the Lord hallelujah but remember the tides are still mine when I need to use it our problem Rises up for private personal problem and I need to use it that's what it's there for then I can go in and say uh brother Mike or brother so-and-so uh write this check for I need it I need to do something I don't even have to tell them what I need it for because that's my my private uh funds if you want to put it that way for the glory of God I'm telling you what's in the Bible what the prophet said and I'm telling you from my personal private experience of handling God's tithings then sometimes the offerings in the church if it's not enough and there's a problem that's necessary there needed then I will dip into the tithes and turn around and give it back to to be used for the glory of God to help the church but I don't do that all the time so that the church become dependent on me and that my influence on the church will be because the church is obligated to me through my assistance to the church with either no praise the Lord but if there comes up a situation where it's necessary doesn't matter how many thousands there just give it God will God knows what he's doing praise the Lord our ministers passing through ministers pass through and sometimes the church may not have enough to be able to deal with one two three pass in a row and maybe one and and then can wait for another and then deal with another one but if they come like that and they have to be dealt with sometimes I do that and I'm not doing that to put feathers in my cap here I'm not a chief or something like that but um do you do that for the glory of God you don't even think about it because in your heart you want to do these things from God's glory amen praise the Lord so now you you getting a little idea of what this business of tithing is about it's not some man-made trumped up cause that somebody worked up somewhere this was before Moses this was before this came from through Abraham praise the Lord oh praise God now let me move on because these things can be expanded on but the spiritual men here praise the Lord now so you see they give and what they give kept up the buildings repairs on the buildings were taken care of out of that amen you see but remember that tent all of all Tidings went to the priests in other words he says to their pastors see yes tithings are to go for nothing else did you get that praise the Lord amen I'm glad you're thinking when you start getting quite like that you're thinking that's good praise the Lord oh now I know there are some people take their tithes and give them to some old widow woman I'm telling you that is wrong let me say that again I know people who take the tithes and give them to some old widow woman that is wrong if you've got anything to give to that widow woman give her but don't you give her God's money that's not yours in the first place because you're giving somebody else's money amen praise the name of the Lord now in this church the policy is and let me make it clear now if something comes up you have a problem you have a great need not every little problem come up you run to the Deacon or you run to the pastor uh as if they're a spare tire on a car and when the wheel gets punctured you run to the pass you run to this and you don't have the pressure to pray you don't have the pressure to believe you you use them as a place where you can let off your pressure or I'll get it from the church sure I'll get it from over here no our focus should be on believing God and his word amen you have not Jesus said because you ask not you have not you don't believe you don't really believe you're talking about your mouth but you're not as we say you're not putting your money where your mouth is right you've got to do that praise the Lord you place it where you get your spiritual food amen praise the name of the Lord now you understand that uh and let me say this that widows especially it touches your heart somebody's husband passed away and leave them behind and you have to struggle through life right uh and it touches your heart but there are some widows that will deliberate deliberately try to plan your Heartstrings so that you will give and give and give and support them listen what brother Branham says here now you see my if you do that that is not yours that is God's Hallelujah now we set it up here so that you have those needs talk to your deacon Peter and Paul on them set it up that if there is a problem in the congregation or your problems that you tried your best and you can't handle go to the deacon talk to the Deacons oh well I don't want to tell anybody my business well then you don't really need help you just go ahead people want to want always to be prayed for sickness even to the pastor individually but they don't want to tell him what is the sickness so what's he going to pray for and just pray like that now I'm going off here but those are just things little little things a pastor meets in his lifetime this is a secret this is a private this is a not to if you're talking to the man of God if you're talking to all the people and you're going to shout it from the house stop that's another matter but you're talking to the man of God you and the secret thing this this what secret what are you talking about to the serve the true sermon now amen is a different mother praise God hallelujah yes see why we said it that way is because you have these Spirits moving amongst the people constantly is that right now just pass over this you got foxy spirits right will sit in any congregation cunning smart you got snakes spiritually oh they know how to twist turn and everything else like that you got all these Spirits moving in the church right and they will try to coil put their coils around you especially when it's a young believer that hasn't matured enough to be able to have the spiritual strength discernment and the power of God that says no go to the deacon see they don't want to come straight to the Deacon or the pastor because they know they're going to be discerned and they know they want to stay in the darkness they don't want to come to the light all right and so they want to move like that within the congregation so that they can avoid detection and one that it's detected brother Brandon said you know like rats like roaches he says creatures of the night will turn on the light they run and Scamper to find some corner to hide behind in like that amen but thank God we walk in the light as he is in the light and we have Fellowship one with another what you talking about people say oh but somewhere you talk like that listen if things get so bad that I really need some help amen or you need some help praise the Lord then I will either go to brother Mike or if God says no I want to bless this person talk to this person praise the Lord talk to them amen and oh brother I don't have it I only have this twenty dollars but that's what God wants to see the heart of that person and that twenty dollars they give that twenty dollars and say oh and I'm going to give my twenty dollars to him I'm gonna give my last piece of bread and my last piece of this mix that and give you to give that to the prophet and me and my son died no you see she God stretches you he knows how to stretch you and he does it for his glory and for his honor praise the Lord amen yes praise the name of the Lord now if you sent me downtown to buy you a loaf of bread and gave me 25 cents back then not 25 cents now to get that loaf of bread and when I go down the street I met someone else right who asked me for money and I with the sympathies gave them the money you gave me to buy the loaf of bread see oh my then I have to give them my money I can't give them the money you gave me to buy a loaf of bread amen but this you see it's your money on a tenth which is what the word times means one tenth one tenth and Levi the priesthood or the pastor is supposed to live by that tenth the 10th is to be a tithing that's to be brought into the storehouse with a promise of God to bless it and the proof if you don't believe it prove me if I won't do it that's right Tidings goes into the church for the pastor and things that is separate a fund all together right that is scriptural praise the Lord then he begins to talk about himself I remember a time I was so sick when I was a boy I came out of the hospital owing about two thousand dollars and it used to be a drugstore I owed him about three or four hundred dollars medical bills he didn't even know me and there it was he sent a bill to me and I said Mr swaniger I owe you oh it was Mr Mason Duncan Court Avenue and Spring Street I'm just counting him here so sir I owe you but I'm still awfully sick and weak and I'm trying to work even though I'm still sick and weak but now I can't pay you I just become a Christian but miss first thing Mr Mason as my duty to God I owe him my tithes in other words if I earn any money I got to pay God my tithes first seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all other things will be added on to you do you believe it amen see oh my so first I must pay my tithes and I want to pay him my tithes and my next Duty since I owe you is to pay all my debts amen I said my father is sickly there's ten more of us in that house and I he's still sick and I am trying to work to maintain all those younger ones along with the sick Daddy that was in that house if I can't pay you more than 25 cents on each payday if I can't even pay you that I'll make sure I come by and tell you that this week I can't pay you oh my and now by the help of God I want you to know I paid every bit of that off see praise God God bless that Prophet he's showing that he was done in the dumps like anybody else he went through debt crisis like anybody else friends I am not ashamed I've passed that way also by his grace many troubles and trails but God has brought us through to this hour I live from the day when the church used to take in two dollars then when it take to begin to take in a hundred and fifty dollars a month and I was rejoicing praise the Lord and God continued to bless and grow it until it comes to where it is now and we give him all the praise the honor and the glory and I want everybody to take their hand and do like this I can't come on top each one of you on the back and say God bless you but I'll let you do it for yourself God bless every one of you that are giving to support the work of God here in the house of the Lord Hallelujah now he stops to give an illustration about this debt crisis that goes on in the church let me back up a little bit and that's the reason why we don't believe in this church and always have that Believers need to go amongst one another and borrow from brother so and so over there secretly privately unknown to the pastor unknown to the Deacon uh borrow so much over there and then go over here also and borrow over there and bar over and have this network this web uh working like that in the church but if persons come like that and you say oh uh brother sister you you do have a need oh my goodness well you know what you ought to do why don't we just go and talk to brother Danny or brother Tim or brother Desmond or or let's go talk to the pastor most of the time you see that Spirit back right off you see if it's a real need it doesn't care it will come it will come but if that thing is not of God it'll back right off like that so we've never had that problem in the church this church any time for all these years of people going around amongst one another trying to borrow money here borrow money there and trying to play on your sympathies especially when you're a young Christian that matured yet they play on your heart strings like that uh God tells us not to be naive live by the word and the principles of the world are being laid out so live by that you see when you come out of that that's where Satan gets you but when you stay within the word he has a problem because he's going to be brought into the light and he doesn't like that lighting praise the Lord we'll touch him later praise God hallelujah amen you don't mind him not running here today I'm taking my time to to make sure I nail every nail in I don't want loose boards on the house and if life's lightest wind comes the boards start falling off no I want to clinch the nail bang bang and if you need something of them I'll hit you seven times with the word to make sure that nail holds amen praise the name of the Lord God Amen now there was a Christian at this church one time went out and got some work done on his car here no that man said I'll pay you he couldn't pay them he tells the mechanic I'll pay you when I get paid on Saturday are you listening to me close now praise the Lord and he never even paid him drive by the man's shop every time doesn't pay him weeks and after weeks and weeks Roll by still never bed him and also never even went and said a word do Christians do that well this question did that and even in this day people who claim to believe this message and believe the word still do that but they don't want nobody to know about it but God knows about it all right now know this until that mechanic that man that he owed the money to came to me that man came to Branham Tabernacle came and seized brother Branham and spoke to him praise the Lord now I'm not preaching about half hour silence I'm not preaching whether Redemption is over I'm not preaching on the mystery of iniquity or godliness and not preaching on 666 or some great subject like that that could get your mind caught up with you see no I'm bringing the word to you that you're not to just be spiritually high-minded and on Earth as we usually say you know Earthly good you're so high-minded that you know Earthly good you're so spiritual you can't even live and be practical by the word right so let's look at our lives in the light of the word praise the Lord Hallelujah no and he told me about it now I won't say it but it you see things like that reflects against the entire church is that right it reflects against the church it reflects against Christ himself because you're using his name that you're a Christian right oh my you can't pay him or pay them then go tell them say I owe you I'm going to pay you I am a Christian but I just can't do it right now I can't do it I all this I know I oh oh it it's not only on your books brother Brandon is saying no remember that death is also on God's books you know that I'm trying to offer myself and for all of us together try to be ready friends pay your debts we know we are getting near to something now very near something is about to take place and when it does we want to be ready Hallelujah let me put it I'm I'm talking now what is saying that don't try to use the Rapture as an escape from your debts I'm sorry but mine look at the word I see all these things he's telling you don't you wait and delay and delay to pay your debts and try to use the Rapture that the Rapture gonna take you out of here and and you're free from all your debts and and like that he says no doesn't work that way God got it on his books too amen see oh my so we all want to be ready for the coming of the Lord is drawing nigh and we want to be ready for that great hour is that right we don't want to think if we want to think pentecostally you're trying to go up and rise in the Rapture and a bag of some death hang on one foot and you can't go up because the weight got you held down to the ground here on Earthly things no it doesn't work that way we must pay our debts now listen I'm not talking to an individual because I don't know nothing about any individual in here I know you but I don't know anything about an individual and why God has let me speak this way is maybe he's stuck into some individual of our individuals you have got to find out that by yourself whenever you come to the Limit his limit of what he can take from you and what you're doing and he may be fixing to do something about it so before do that God doesn't do anything unless he first gives warning praise the Lord hallelujah amen now this is a solemn thing we should think on it for a little while how that Israel they're believed yes and yet when they got to the Waters of Nara we saw what they did we all Mara means bitterness and that speaks of every one of us have got to go through the bitterness of life and this life we live on earth there's a lot of bitterness sometimes that we come across we can't stand the bitterness we can't stand sometimes the bitter medicines of that we have to take from the great physician well we want to spit it out we don't want to take it in we're going to face the bitterness of life but listen just the answer is still the same Moses took a a branch of a tree and threw it into the waters and the Bible says the water becomes sweet the bitter Waters become sweet out of your trials God can have triumphed out of your bitterness God can make sweetness God can have a testimony praise the Lord for without a test or without test you can't have a test the money praise the Lord your test is money in God's bank and God begins to bless you and pay it out in another way we're going to trust him and believe him forever promise that he made within his word praise the name of the Lord glory to God hallelujah amen so there at Mara before them and they have to pass through also the Wilderness of sin praise God that's them naturally but the spirit of God is telling us we all pass through that way we got to pass through that way of the Wilderness of sin we pass through that way and we make mistakes we stumble we fall we do all manner of things amen but you don't keep on the ground crying for somebody to come and wrap your knees no you rise and try again said the prophet of God Amen Hallelujah you rise up and you try again how's a child going to learn to walk if when they fall on the ground they don't try again to get up and start trying to walk again and the same it is in a Christian walk to walk with God hallelujah amen there they walk me walk they walk through the windows of sin then on to Mount Sinai praise God we're going to hit some mountain tops is that right we're gonna hit some mountain tops and God bless you and you walk up there but the sister Johnson love to sing is God on the mountain yeah but then sometimes you got to go back down in the valley and that's where you need to trust him down in the valley to walk with your lord down in the valley of trails and Temptation down in the valley of deaths and creditors calling you on your phone and listen that down there trust him and believe him and believe his promises amen praise God and then after that that mountain tough experience they went on to kadish barnya where they have their doubts doubts deliberations wondering about that and that was just 11 days before the crossing he's telling us after he just spoke that look the coming of the Lord is drawing now now he's telling us 11 days before the crossing he's telling you it's near to the Rapture now and you got all these things you have to pass through or maybe you already passed through some of them but you got to come true all amen you got to pass through all of it amen see they couldn't believe it after they had seen all those wonderful things amen and that's where Israel made its fatal mistake because right there the renounce Grace and accepted the law Hallelujah while Moses was leading them through the Wilderness with all the miracle signs wonders they were still under the grace that came from Abraham but then when they didn't even want to live by God's Unwritten word then he had to give them written word which he caused Moses to do on top of the mountain and they from then on they rely begin to rely on just the written word that they had and by doing that they renounced their renounce the grace and accepted the law and so is the modern Church the same thing when oh my goodness the the word the word the word is good you're saying the word but do you have a revelation of the word because that's where your faith should lie on Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it it'll Prevail against the written word with the argumentation with analytics with all kinds of deliberations with all kinds of uh uh coming together of biblical conferences they will prevail against the written word but they can't Prevail against the unwritten word the logos of God revealing itself momentarily Moment by moment no anticipation of the devil he doesn't know what God is going to do God just reveals the word and the believer acts on the word hallelujah amen see there wasn't satisfied amen they didn't wasn't satisfied with the grace of God which he was showing to Abraham a complete Grace that provided a special lamb for him that he didn't even ask for Hallelujah a revelation you didn't know you didn't ask for whatever and God reveals it Grace Revelation comes by Grace it's not by study not by wisdom not by knowledge not by years oh I'm old I'm 70 years I've been in the message so it doesn't come by that you respect that that's wonderful but it comes by revelation hallelujah what are you talking about that I can't explain fully to you God has got to make that clear to you amen praise the name of the Lord amen see they it provided see as great sacrificial lamb the god provided them with a Revival there that was with Moses and they still wasn't satisfied with that they wanted something that they could literally see and argue about is that right and that's what we got here today right we got the message and they are arguing for scriptural points so if you want this and that and the other but once the Believers have begun to catch the revelation Isaiah's prophecy becomes fulfilled and it shall come to pass in those days when the word is revealed The Watchmen on the walls of Zion will see eye to eye amen see eye to eye because they can't see anything else the word is one the word is not the proliferation of ideas the word is one so when the Believers have caught the Revelation the true revelation of God they will automatically begin to say eye to eye it may not express it in the same way amen but they'll know that the person is saying the same thing that they already see and they already know they'll know it praise the name of the Lord notice them blessings come to Israel that is from church choosing law over Grace that's the message there blessings have come to Israel and yet they wanted to have a law or something that they could do themselves and it's like many questions today uh to be a Christian they think they have to do some Christian Works they have to do this or that of course you want to do that but that's not what it is all about you do it because of the love of God within your heart you're not doing it because you're sending up uh numbers are you sending up money to God are you sending up Good Works to God I was a good man I was just like that you're not doing it for that so when you have enough up there you says well now I can go I don't have to worry when I meet Peter at the get he said oh come right in Mr sunso I know you did this you did this now it doesn't work like that that's Pentecostal beliefs denominational beliefs our beliefs is blessed upon the word of God which has to do with predestination election for knowledge amen and then the spirit of God comes and places you in whichever age you're supposed to be in you are positionally placed in that age and then within that particular age that you are placing you recognize your purpose amen not in the individual Church you recognize your purpose but in the age this is the age in other words oh now I know I am supposed to be in this age you could be in no other age but in this age because God shaped you God planned you God purpose you God had your personality set up in such a way that it will only fit in this age and that is why you are here in this age and when the Holy Spirit reveals himself to you that that is him placing you as a son or as a daughter and say I recognize you within this age and that's why you can't go back to any passage because you won't fit there and you will be out of order absolutely praise the name of the Lord they wanted something for them to do themselves they want to justify themselves that I you know I did something too I I I I kneeled on the cathedral steps and I did the 13 Stations of the Cross I let so many candles what you gave there was this two inch candles my own was 18 inches wide across there and when you see you burn that things begin to happen up in heaven oh my you saw Martin Luther where when he said there John tetzel says as soon as your money drops within the Box the soul of your mother Rises up to God it's not in the Bible but the way he was a real speaker the way he said it he got the people to believe right so people believe still in crawling up the steps flagellating themselves and everything else and they're not paying attention to the word of God you see because they want to have something they can do themselves they want some Sabbath day that they can keep oh my think of that my goodness they want some other Church ordinance that they're told to do that they can go do that and when they do it perfectly they feel that justifies and qualifies them for entrance into the presence of God oh my or something or another they want to do it but they want something to do themselves they don't like it when they're here there is nothing for you to do salvation is by God Alone is that right salvation is God alone all you got to do is accept him accept it receive it within your heart and allow God to work within you and work out his purposes within your life praise the Lord is not works and so that's why the the devil literally got even me in the first part of your Christianity to start guarding people to works that they have to be this you have to be that you have to be that but it's an individual thing how you have to be because the holy spirit is going to deal with you just as much as he deals with me as a Shepherd in general I have to try to hold the sheep together with the word of God but each individual believer must speak to God In Prayer in Bible reading and fellowship and listen for his voice speaking to them how to walk how to conduct themselves how to carry go forward in the name of the Lord or brother Brandon asked the angel sir what of my future what of my future the angel pick up a piece of paper crumple to design through it in the air and said your future is clear oh praise God May every one of us hear the voice of God saying to you your future is clear clear everything else out of the way and let the spirit of the Living God shine brightly upon your lies praise God I'm watching the timing I'm not going to keep you longer than I ought to but I'm trying to get as much of this as I can to you is that okay praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen now remember there is not one thing any of us can do to save ourselves do you believe that amen there is not one Speck of it you can do it is all Grace law is what you do in regards to the grace you received is that right amen or by of God is showed to you by Saving you as I have often said I don't run around with other women because I'm afraid my wife will divorce me it's got real quiet now it's okay but listen I'm just going to quote brother brother here now I don't run around with other women because I'm afraid my wife will divorce me but I don't run around with other women because I love my wife can some of you Brothers Say Amen so half-heartedly say it like you really mean it let's do it again Brothers praise the Lord because they are listening praise God do you love your wife I do if you don't I do hallelujah amen see I don't believe you should run wrong but the law isn't what keeps me in other words now listen to this it's some some of these courts Brothers don't even see them they pass over them he says do you know it's not even my marriage vow that keeps me that is law and we got to keep natural law surely but that's not what he's saying here that's not what's really keeping me it's my love for my wife that's keeping me amen and you pay regard to your vows that you made like that you see but this is my love for her and it's the reason why I obey the word of God is the reason why I live for him it's because I love God I love him it's not because I'm afraid he'll send me to hell that I'm serving him I'm serving him because I love him amen so much that I don't want to do anything that will bring heart to him and so do I and so do you if you're a True Believer praise the name of the Lord Lord of God Amen now when men and women get to a place and begin to say well I really ought to stay at home because my favorite television show is coming on tonight I tell you they'll think I'm back slid if I don't go down to the church if I don't go down to the church the church people are going to think I'm backslid amen and you sat there and you just sleep away you might as well have stayed home and looked at something that you may enjoy more than being in the presence of God when you but when your joy turns and becomes the Lord see and the Lord becomes your joy you can't stay away from church then you now you're getting somewhere the church now was in better shape 40 years ago than it is here tonight amen because they were closer to God they had God among them they had more Spirit among them than many churches got in them today amen is that the truth my God bless us praise the Lord I meant to Antigua and we were reminiscing in some of the times we got together in in each other houses groups of us would get together one playing a guitar the other singing sisters cooking rejoicing in the presence of God going by brother Mike's mom sitting in our little tiny little uh house that she had cropped together and she's bringing out those brownies and teas and pieces of pizza and paper rejoicing in the presence of God and bringing glory to his name Hallelujah and that came was coming back to those Believers and myself while we were there what sweet wonderful times were in the presence of the Living God amen hallelujah oh praise God but that's the way it is Friends uh now today I believe we need that together in the grace of God because the devil is encouraging selfishness in the church everybody lives their own life to themselves forget about the rest of them but this getting together Fellowship rail Fellowship a fellowship on the phone Fellowship on the computer Fellowship by WhatsApp Fellowship by Twitter or Instagram or something like that but face to face Fellowship you know like that that's another matter I don't have time I'm too busy this guy work out amen but Brothers we've got to try to get that Spirit moving in our hearts amen where we value one another praise God there's nothing like the give and take that comes from one heart to the other the spirit of God working and moving Hallelujah like that in a special wonderful way amen now friends let me say this amen God will provide you with all the works if you will just keep walking in Grace you keep walking in his grace and automatically works are going to come off of you amen you'll be in fact he said you will be more at work than you are right now see oh my all them things oh praise God remember your tithes pears the preacher the preacher is to live by the tithes of the people and we had to go and get other things we want to do to pay the preacher tithes and offering goes to Levi which was the minister you understand what God is talking about when they had the 12 tribes and and if you know God divided up and said well you get this you get that this ottoman will do this this other but you tribe of the Levi all you will do is serve me in the temple and even though you don't have to go to the field you don't have to go chasing after sheep you don't have to do this you don't have to do that stay in the temple and you serve me in the temple and I'm gonna let all the rest of the tribes give the tithes for your support here in the temple of God that's where God was talking about and that's what it is praise the Lord hallelujah amen praise God now remember that I'm going to pass over that and move on to something else now every man ought to have a church who who believes that praise God you ought to have a church home see you ought to have a place not just be a floater floating about from Pillar To Post you have somewhere you must have somewhere that you go to church praise the Lord amen and you called that place your church see that is somewhere where you must pay your tithes somewhere where you can help to support the cause praise the Lord hallelujah praise God but do you know I feel that the church member their first obligation is with the tithes and offerings is to support the church and if you are members of fine churches that's represented then you'll support that church Amen in other words tithes and offerings are not relegated to just people in the message it's represented in every Church regardless of who they are they're supposed to pay this tithes and he's saying that that's your first duty to God and the stories you surely know what that is it's where you get your food that's where you get your spiritual food and your obligation is to that church not to any evangelist or anybody else like me and anywhere praise the Lord hallelujah well well I send my times to voice of God over here over there I said to brother this or brother that no your taste goes to the church where you belong and where you get your spiritual food now if there are people and there are people out there where there is no pastors they're scattered everywhere the scattered out east out west everywhere they're scattered there are no pastors there uh there's no church there and they maybe will listen to Somebody Like Me online and they decide to send their tithes on their offerings because this is where they get their spiritual food off of this ministry same with the voice of God somebody out there with no pasta and uh the voice of God is where they listen to and they get their spiritual food they are on the obligation not me telling you to do it but the word tells you you you're on the obligation wherever you get your spiritual food that's where you're supposed to send your time so even if I disagree a little bit with this brother here and disagree is approach on this or that when it comes to this God spoke in his word Claire is that right amen no so some of those people they need the better times and they decide they're paying it to the voice of God right what if there is a church in your neighborhood there is a real Pastor there and you want to hide your rebellion and your rebellious Spirit uh behind it and say oh I got my spiritual food from uh brother so and so I get it over here from Brother here so I'm going to send it there and I'm not going to that church or God will hold you guilty because there's a place for you to worship there's a place for you to receive your spiritual food but oh no I I rather to listen it online and rather to listen it there but you don't get the same Fellowship when you got to get together with true Saints of the Living God hallelujah and that is necessary for you to do that for the glory of God Amen so God bless them brothers whoever they are wherever they are that God will bless them but I trust God's spirit will help the rest everybody to get this straightened up in their hearts and in their thoughts amen praise the name of the Lord yes sir o praise God forever let me go over some things here and then I'm going to stop do you see what a strict thing God has it for us to pay our tithes tithing is right every Christian is Duty bound to pay their time and that has never been changed amen see oh my it's never been changed they tried to change it for everything else they're trying to change it for somebody playing lottery in the church and if they win to take the place of the God's blessing where he said try me and prove me they're trying to replace it with a lottery I forgot what's the word they use when they bring it in the church they don't call it Lottery they call it something else um amen see our suppers or things like that my goodness my now all of that trying to bypass God's tithing let me tell you what it is it is nothing but enticing spirits that have come down trying to substitute something else for the obeying the word of God did you get that oh my I didn't know that myself until being led to that now these are enticing Spirits he said that have come down and all they're doing is putting all kinds of ideas in people's minds and leading them off to make them avoid doing God's simple command pay your tithes pay your tithes oh my you see they're trying to substitute something else for the word God has no substitute none whatsoever for his word is eternal and forever and faith has no substitute true Faith stands alone it stands on the word of God and it stands alone amen because it no it cannot be moved hallelujah praise God it knows that it's being predestinated the the Sea The Rock of god holds them and will prevail forevermore praise God and I'll shut it I'll stop right here on this last quote here because these are the things I could say but listen what he says here when he says don't you think about that raise up Let the spirit Take You Higher get into this High spiritual atmosphere get away from that don't stand down there with them chickens fly up fly out to there get away chickens everywhere down there and are just sitting around watching for some old rat to come out of some Barn amen but if you take it off further and join church and come every Sunday we'll have a little game here we'll play croquet in the backyard that's not what this is all about brother amen pay your pastor amen oh my don't go off and say oh we'll put on our bedding suits after service go swimming and we'll get ourselves a good sun tan he says you'll get it all right but not a S O N Tan you'll guess you'll get a s you get a you won't get a s-u-n-10 you'll get a real suntan amen and it won't be he said from just that sun in the sky it will be from Mr branham's son that is gonna Tan Your Hide he said if my children do like that then I'll give them a 10 in myself praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God God bless you I'm going to stop here God bless you all so much talks about being able to live like a Christian musicians are coming he says pass through all them Muddy Waters in other words it's only the devil trying to muddy your mind pass through them Muddy Waters of Egypt pass through all the dogs and all the frustrations all the arguments all this Jews and come down amen pray the preacher if you get over with here under God's laws under God's word and walk with God you'll pay your tithes and the preacher will get along fine if you'll do that and walk with God see what he's referring to there do like Enoch did praise God you got a hint there Enoch even had a revelation before Abraham is all right praise the name of the Lord and there does he says and just keep walking with God walk with God and Bishop will get along fine all right old muddy waters leave them all Muddy Waters and do what drink from the rock ever present fresh water coming from The Rock and get away from the devil mudding up the water mudding up your mind to make you think of all kinds of things get away from them boasting Physicians of Egypt get away from them and come to the great physician and leave and leave his other Egyptian Physicians leave them behind and believe the fullness of the word of God hallelujah do you believe this I certainly believe it I put my faith in God and everything I've said to you I've done it myself and I still am doing it and I'm trusting him every step of the way oh my many other things I wanted to say but I wasn't permitted to say yeah you know I don't I'm not here to ruffle feathers and you know anything like that I mean you're just a preach the word and let the word of God has his way within your heart and Minds praise God hallelujah amen amen glory to God I want to thank God for all his blessings on me on you I thank him for where he brought me from and where I could have been transformed my entire life and I thank him and praise him for that and many that have walked within this ministry God has blessed in wonderful ways many have gone from just having a regular job or a regular small company until they have become big and huge and gone from just a few thousands and gone into millions God bless their heart and life and I'm glad that God used me to be a part of it praise God I don't look necessarily to get human acknowledgment my acknowledgment comes from God God works it out praise God but you know sometimes somebody say oh I did it myself oh I I did so I did this I did that look at what the Lord helped me to do but it doesn't work that way God knows everything amen and he is the one that's working everything oh pour down His blessings upon me blessings that I don't have place to receive may he do the same for you and in this coming year God permitting many years ago God began to show me some things in brother Brandon's message where he kept saying I don't have the time he couldn't speak on Christian prosperity because he had a message and he has to stay on that line but he just touched on it and passed over it and by the grace of God I was able to preach on a series on it which was spot not thing within the hearts on minds of believers and they give one example there is one brother that that nothing and the next thing you know he was almost having a million and God began to bless him but I'm not only talking about prosperity in terms of money for when the Bible talks about prosperity in John it's telling you about your whole person your prosper in health don't you want to prosper in health don't you want like Isaiah said then shall your health burst Force speedily amen and your skin he says shall become like a child glory god don't you want scripture like that the prophet's already prophesied that if you believe the word of God you prosper in health and your health will spring forward speedily amen hallelujah spiritually you'll Prosper also your spiritual life your understanding your wisdom will grow and God will begin to move in a supernatural way within your heart and life amen you think you're blessed now but you can even be more blessed Hallelujah beyond what you can think or ask or desire God can bless you and show you the things that are to come God bless every one of you praise God God bless you brothers and sisters oh I love him [Music] because [Music] and purchase [Music] [Music]
