[0:00] yeah yeah well we're still only 21 years
[0:10] old
[0:12] praise God amen well it's good to be in
[0:15] the house the Lord once again this
[0:17] morning we ministered here back in
[0:22] January
[0:23] the rap should be fine it's exactly one
[0:29] month ago and I knew I wasn't finished
[0:32] there yet and I know I'm still not
[0:33] finished because there's just so much
[0:36] that we can draw from it and its really
[0:39] a series that have been on for the last
[0:42] 10 years which is called calling the
[0:46] resurrection it's all under that
[0:49] inspiration of the Holy Spirit you know
[0:52] really inspires me in that area and you
[0:55] know today you'll understand even more
[0:57] how the gifts operate in the body of
[1:01] Christ and how it is that the Lord we
[1:02] use in certain ways and how each and
[1:05] every one of us is uniquely designed by
[1:09] the hand of God amen for a certain and
[1:13] appropriate time this season
[1:15] amen so praise God we're going to
[1:17] continue along that line you can put up
[1:20] the first slide we're going to take the
[1:22] same scripture that we took from January
[1:28] the 12th I believe of us and then we'll
[1:30] move on there will be some whole-step
[1:33] that are seeing you
[1:35] notice but it's just the way the Lord
[1:37] just inspired you know breaking down
[1:41] drawing from and pulling from what has
[1:45] been been available to us in the
[1:47] storehouse that God gave us through a
[1:51] vindicated prophet amen praise God we
[1:54] are feasting and we have a storehouse
[1:58] that's that's eternal amen and eternal
[2:02] small house is full of nuggets a lot of
[2:05] people often turn around saying why you
[2:07] just got to say exactly what the Prophet
[2:09] said nothing more nothing less
[2:10] that's because they don't have a
[2:12] revelation on what the Prophet said it's
[2:15] just that simpler because if they had a
[2:18] revelation of the mind of God and the
[2:21] revelation and how God gives revelation
[2:24] and how its divided now it's personally
[2:26] inspired every son and daughter of a
[2:29] drive because we all have a part that we
[2:31] must fulfill then you won't say things
[2:34] like that
[2:34] you can drop from the storehouse and you
[2:37] will receive inspiration in its season
[2:40] important to what God asks you to do
[2:42] amen praise God forevermore
[2:45] so before we do us to pray father what a
[2:49] privilege and what an honor for each and
[2:53] every one of us this morning that we can
[2:55] assemble under the message of this day
[2:58] this hour knowing that it is your spirit
[3:01] that comes and ministers to each and
[3:05] every lead that it is you the mighty to
[3:08] let us come down in this day this hour
[3:10] that operates to a fine
[3:12] ministry to perfect your church and to
[3:16] get her ready for the fulfillment of the
[3:19] rapture of the bride Lord what a
[3:23] privilege bless and prosper speaker and
[3:28] here this morning thank you for reading
[3:31] our pastor box from ready Lord willing
[3:35] Oh God many years of experience that we
[3:38] continue to drop on and continue to feed
[3:41] upon Lord we are so blessed that you
[3:45] placed a living candle in our midst
[3:48] you could do the praise the glory and
[3:51] the honor bless us now we pray heavenly
[3:54] places in Jesus name communion according
[3:58] as he hath chosen us in him before the
[4:02] foundations of the world that we should
[4:05] be holy and without blame before him in
[4:08] love having predestinated us unto the
[4:13] adoption there's a there's a time when
[4:17] you as a son or a daughter of God will
[4:21] be adopted he will be placed you will be
[4:24] positioned in the mock of Jesus Christ
[4:27] it is absolutely essential for each and
[4:30] every southerner God to receive this
[4:33] because it's his promise he did it from
[4:36] these four the foundations of the world
[4:37] so we are just now manifesting it in its
[4:41] time and in its season adoption of
[4:43] children by what by Jesus for us
[4:46] Tolu himself they want to say there's
[4:49] three times he's saying right there to
[4:53] himself because this is about the plan
[4:57] this is about his plan redeeming his own
[4:59] to himself according to the good
[5:03] pleasure of their go know his will
[5:09] praise God do the Lord has blessed us
[5:11] Coubertin next slide I don't want to use
[5:15] the clicker ok soldier
[5:16] this way you can be a part of the
[5:18] service and you can receive - amen
[5:22] praise God it says your mother says that
[5:26] when you see BP dance because it's
[5:28] brother branham's money he says but to
[5:30] the church the pride the rapture is a
[5:33] revelation to her it's revealed to her
[5:36] that the revelation the truth
[5:39] private Christ will be waiting for that
[5:42] revelation of the rapture revelation one
[5:50] morning that's going to fulfill all the
[5:53] December eesti month line upon line
[5:56] precept upon precept but then Cox didn't
[5:59] truck one last revelation and it's going
[6:02] to change it's gonna translate you it's
[6:06] going to move you from this dimension
[6:07] directly into the other dimension amen
[6:10] praise God next slide Ephesians chapter
[6:13] 2 verse 21 it continues to say in home
[6:17] oh the building hit me bringing together
[6:22] brought unto an holy temple in how many
[6:29] bodies are going in the rapture
[6:37] the bottom of Jesus Christ and when you
[6:41] were called into this revelation is
[6:44] because you were positionally being
[6:46] placed and adopted as a son or a god of
[6:51] God to fulfill a certain part in the
[6:55] word so that that revelation of the
[6:58] rapture of the church being translated
[7:01] can be fulfilled you must find your
[7:08] position to be placed through the
[7:20] mystery of word through the word being
[7:23] preached through Malachi 4:5 restoring
[7:27] the word of them revelation 10 to 7 the
[7:29] mighty angel coming down and now the
[7:31] fivefold ministry speaking the word
[7:34] perfecting the church positionally
[7:36] placing give you direction of
[7:38] instruction according to his purpose and
[7:43] season and his word next brother and
[7:50] says here now preaching usually catches
[7:52] the center brings another confirmation
[7:55] by the word but teaching places the man
[8:00] positionally what he is and we can never
[8:04] be able to have faith until positionally
[8:09] we know what you now in the united
[8:14] states of this fair land
[8:16] as an ambassador of this nation to
[8:19] Russia that if they have officially sent
[8:22] me to record all the power that the
[8:24] United States ask is behind me my word
[8:27] is just the same as the United States
[8:30] and I have been recognized as an
[8:33] ambassador and you has a son of God
[8:36] that's been positionally placed by the
[8:39] Word of God have been given an authority
[8:43] you do not have to bow down to the
[8:46] circumstances that that are in your life
[8:48] that control you in any way shape or
[8:50] form if I talked to you would have not
[8:54] picked by the Word of God to do demons
[8:59] you can speak the word because but
[9:02] please not 14 you
[9:08] [Music]
[9:22] [Music]
[9:37] [Music]
[9:47] in the south this work cannot return for
[9:52] big next time anyone this is number of
[9:58] the brand sweet anyone who attends this
[10:02] church for any length of time without
[10:04] hearing about the need to have the
[10:13] [Music]
[10:16] Ministry of the Lord because that's who
[10:18] we are
[10:21] we exist to disciple ministers I'm not
[10:28] just talking about ministers that come
[10:30] and stand behind the pulpit but you are
[10:34] cleaning the washrooms water Minister
[10:36] because we're going to string them to
[10:39] the bar because it's his house you have
[10:45] [Music]
[10:58] [Music]
[11:12] [Music]
[11:25] [Music]
[11:42] [Music]
[11:48] [Music]
[11:58] [Music]
[12:05] that's how much for that's how much
[12:07] confidence
[12:15] to be the keys to the kingdom all such
[12:18] great promises he's given to the church
[12:22] how many emotion you not be activated
[12:41] you can't just be some church members
[12:43] sitting at the Pew we didn't wake up
[12:46] without having a purpose without having
[12:48] a desire to bless and edify the body of
[12:53] Jesus Christ
[13:36] [Music]
[13:43] [Music]
[14:11] [Music]
[14:13] or recognize those things and that's why
[14:17] your deacon or your pastor or the Holy
[14:19] Spirit come and minister to you to a
[14:22] friend to the mob through whatever it is
[14:26] because he does not care how he's going
[14:30] to give to you name because his
[14:33] revelation is divided to spire it's no
[14:37] man can give revelation that's why it's
[14:39] rather than how he comes to speak dog
[14:41] who's that dog
[14:52] [Music]
[15:03] there's no you should be this is
[15:36] wonderful you can see how all these
[15:45] things because it expresses and now
[16:05] Christ in the church is just be made
[16:08] know the whole thing is the revelation
[16:10] of God to take heed back to her right
[16:14] position again with her husband notice
[16:17] and Donna's husband of the church and
[16:19] the church is his bride all if the judge
[16:23] only knew its position
[16:52] [Music]
[17:00] [Music]
[17:04] receiving perfect beauty so that you can
[17:16] the rapture when it knows what it is
[17:25] what's one of the primary reasons that
[17:29] we exist is for you happy to discover
[17:34] God's purposes to the Lord we have about
[17:44] seven seals or seven Church ages or
[17:47] anything like that when God calls an
[17:49] individual it's a supernatural event
[17:51] here in okay he comes he calls and then
[17:56] he gives the Holy Ghost to you wakens
[17:59] that attributed body waters that seed
[18:01] that's in there from before the
[18:03] foundation of the world and then he
[18:04] needs and died
[18:09] and I'll just bring you this it's gotta
[18:14] bring it to her you recognize who you
[18:17] are because the problem of their church
[18:26] denominational world reach the point of
[18:33] the rapture is because they take the
[18:37] word and they just keep their own
[18:40] interpretation the first church a second
[18:48] church a stir and it kept progressing it
[18:50] kept moving on and kept moving on until
[18:53] we are here to the same spirit which is
[19:05] positionally placing them that's why I
[19:11] try to listen the rapture revival
[19:13] because because we need to be we need to
[19:16] be open up out of that sleep state that
[19:20] the Scriptures said wake up out of that
[19:24] sleepy condition because the foolish
[19:26] virgin she was sleeping she didn't hear
[19:31] the call of the bridegroom he's probably
[19:33] not the wise here
[19:44] [Music]
[20:16] [Applause]
[20:20] [Music]
[20:39] [Music]
[20:47] it's by doing ministries how to discover
[20:50] your purpose what and how God made you
[20:54] to be
[20:55] determines what he intends for you to do
[21:04] [Music]
[21:07] I will see more
[21:10] [Music]
[21:39] [Music]
[21:48] [Music]
[22:00] [Music]
[22:11] [Music]
[22:26] [Music]
[22:39] [Music]
[22:54] [Music]
[23:11] listen
[23:12] so you for example that's what they do
[23:34] there just because
[23:38] [Music]
[23:51] [Music]
[24:21] all these experiences were deliverance
[24:24] you were gonna take you certain
[24:27] experiences and supernatural things and
[24:29] they wanted to that cannot build or add
[24:41] by the body this a total waste right
[24:50] that's the same might deal with
[24:53] Christians would don't discover their
[24:56] ministry there's many many different
[25:01] mysteries like I can't give it up just
[25:04] that this this is like an introduction
[25:07] and then for them because us Lord needs
[25:10] fervor for me to come to Mister again
[25:13] because I'm having so much fun and bless
[25:17] you from this this series that I believe
[25:21] there's so much more that we can drop
[25:22] prophet but we're just gonna hide that
[25:25] we they have certain things so we get
[25:26] you thinking and get you looking within
[25:29] yourself that would be a total waste
[25:33] doesn't deal
[25:40] [Music]
[26:03] [Music]
[26:14] [Music]
[26:20] you need to discover your unique design
[26:25] you can't see this because this is
[26:28] something that's been used teachings
[26:38] there's a lot of teachings out there but
[26:39] let me tell you something you when you
[26:41] take that teaching you start breathing
[26:52] to manifestation of you so you need to
[26:54] discover a very needy designer for your
[26:57] ministry
[26:59] you're given gifts and abilities in
[27:02] serving God and others this is not just
[27:08] about serving stuff a lot of people what
[27:12] certain Lord while you serving yourself
[27:15] because you you know you know you know
[27:18] edify your brother or your sister in the
[27:21] way that you're serving the Lord
[27:24] you can be in a position in the church
[27:27] and be miserable what I'm talking about
[27:32] works here you can tell the difference
[27:37] when somebody's operating in their
[27:39] office they don't show up they put
[27:50] things of the world the things of God
[27:55] more oh yeah listen this is the awkward
[28:00] area it's going to be you know things
[28:03] are going to be exposed because remember
[28:06] this is the only time this is a
[28:07] perfecting time this is not an officer
[28:10] not because it's convenient you are
[28:12] going to be in town and you know things
[28:15] are
[28:22] [Music]
[28:30] it's not because Jesus he said it was to
[29:44] love it was now I'm not talking about
[29:47] correcting and something has his ways of
[29:50] correct even identifying and dealing
[29:52] with the people in the church he has
[30:03] [Music]
[30:25] [Applause]
[30:26] [Music]
[30:32] [Music]
[30:40] but you're gifted of God it's not work
[30:46] it's a battle but it's not work it's
[30:53] different you're just naturally able to
[30:59] do the things just gives you you can be
[31:10] the best cleaner nobody please my
[31:14] brother what he does the class because
[31:23] it's clean that's one aspect of his
[31:30] ministry
[31:31] what yeah it's a part of a ministry
[31:39] [Music]
[31:52] [Music]
[32:10] your character your gifts are building
[32:12] by defeating on the word assembly
[32:15] yourselves and remaining sensitive to
[32:18] this leading through a prayer life occur
[32:22] tonight assembling yourself people are
[32:29] taking it to life but you can be a
[32:52] mystery here and one of you are in
[32:55] ministry operating in your ministry to
[32:58] realize that you are overcome because
[33:04] you received when you receive this
[33:12] message
[33:23] [Music]
[33:38] because the situation supernatural
[33:59] [Music]
[34:07] receive the word about you Dennis your
[34:10] master of life you're you're receiving
[34:14] the healing virtue that come from the
[34:16] word about the receding toll the genre
[34:19] that provided all of your needs
[34:20] he's just supernaturally killing me with
[34:23] his word
[34:53] we can be by ourselves okay simple
[36:08] questions
[36:14] [Music]
[36:30] [Music]
[36:37] [Music]
[36:47] [Music]
[37:02] [Music]
[37:22] [Music]
[37:23] so these place those spiritual gifts it
[37:33] will show demonstrate vindicated a man
[37:36] must be sometimes pastor Simon calls we
[37:38] must been brother I can't take the
[37:40] service time I am stuffing I've been
[37:43] preparing I think what we rounded the
[37:46] Lord's I said what I got love this is
[37:48] good
[38:00] [Music]
[38:08] [Music]
[38:19] [Music]

[38:54] [Music]
[39:04] [Music]
[39:43] [Music]
[39:49] [Music]
[40:08] [Music]
[40:41] [Music]
[40:45] next personality where it is my
[40:50] personality best suit need to serve if
[40:55] your are going your to communicate with
[40:57] people and you know you love kids
[41:06] if you've got natural abilities and
[41:10] you've got a personality that goes with
[41:13] your abilities and how do you know that
[41:15] they can pulse with your abilities is
[41:17] when you operate and that ability your
[41:21] personality shines it doesn't it doesn't
[41:35] [Music]
[41:45] [Music]
[41:48] sometimes I would see what I thought
[41:50] there was something to come to me but my
[41:52] wife my brother said go easy see our
[42:00] personalities are designed in a certain
[42:02] way for a purpose but then we need to
[42:06] know how to harness you and develop and
[42:11] grow in Christ a lot of the Spirit on
[42:13] the mind of Christ to take a hold of
[42:15] that personality that seemed still that
[42:18] seems a little bit hard but that went up
[42:22] needs to use it under the desperation
[42:24] under the leadership of the revelation
[42:28] and decision it does its purpose you see
[42:33] that's the thing that's where we need to
[42:35] come and realize how we've been built
[42:37] how we've been designed and how we are
[42:40] in the body of Jesus Christ where is my
[42:45] personality used in the situation's into
[43:47] the people into whatever it is into your
[43:52] hats
[43:52] you'll be seen because it's God's love
[43:58] God's Way when it's not about think
[44:01] there's a huge difference when it's
[44:04] being done and you don't want to do it
[44:11] experiences experience Lord Jesus
[44:22] because you know I've just had so many
[44:25] experiences most of my fault because
[44:30] it's pity or whatever else but then a
[44:33] lot of them because God
[44:38] [Music]
[44:55] [Applause]
[45:08] [Music]
[45:28] [Music]
[45:37] [Music]
[45:49] [Music]
[46:03] so you need to look at the positive
[46:05] aspects of your experiences
[46:43] [Applause]
[46:50] [Music]
[47:00] [Music]
[47:05] revelation nothing you can only have to
[47:08] see you were let them speak to her
