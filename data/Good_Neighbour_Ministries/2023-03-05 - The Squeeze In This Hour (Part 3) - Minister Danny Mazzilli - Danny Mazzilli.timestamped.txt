[1:17] amen let's give God an Applause
[1:19] [Music]
[1:24] as scripture is taken from psalm 27.
[1:28] [Music]
[1:32] the Lord is my light and my salvation
[1:37] Whom Shall I Fear
[1:39] the Lord is the strength of my life
[1:43] of whom shall I be afraid
[1:46] when the wicked even my enemies and my
[1:51] foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh
[1:55] they stumble and fell
[1:58] though and who shouldn't come around me
[2:01] my heart shall not fear the world should
[2:06] Rise Against Me
[2:07] in this will I be confident
[2:12] one thing have I desired of the Lord
[2:15] now will I seek Arthur I may dwell in
[2:20] the house of the Lord all the days of my
[2:23] life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[2:26] and to inquire in his Temple
[2:30] for in the time of trouble
[2:33] he shall hide me in his Pavilion and the
[2:36] secret of his Tabernacle Shahi set up
[2:40] upon a rock

[3:06] have messed yourself on me and answer me
[3:11] when that said seek my face
[3:15] my heart said unto thee thy face law
[3:20] will I seek
[3:22] hide not thy face far from me
[3:25] put not thy servant away in an anger
[3:29] the house be my help
[3:31] leave me not neither forsake me oh god
[3:35] of my salvation
[3:37] when my father and my mother forsake me
[3:40] then Lord will take me up
[3:44] teach me that way
[3:47] oh Lord
[3:49] Lead Me
[3:51] in a plain path because of my enemies
[3:55] deliver me not over to the wall of mine
[3:58] enemies
[3:59] for false Witnesses are risen up against
[4:03] me and such as I breathe out cruelty

[4:12] see the goodness of the Lord in the land

[44:31] hour
[44:32] and uh this morning we're going to look
[44:34] at part three
[44:36] um just things that uh that the lord has
[44:39] laid upon my heart and you know when you
[44:41] think about the squeeze you think about
[44:43] you know uh pressure you know coming
[44:45] down you know when when we think about
[44:48] it and when we talk about it sometimes
[44:50] oh when the squeeze comes down upon the
[44:53] bride she will do things and and
[44:55] experience Supernatural like never
[44:58] before well
[45:00] you can look at it that way or you can
[45:02] look at it and recognize that you're in
[45:04] the midst of it right now because of who
[45:07] you are and because you're a carrier of
[45:10] the word for this day and for this hour
[45:12] that's what the pressure is on
[45:17] and we're living in a time in a season
[45:19] where this pressure is is creeping in in
[45:24] such a way that it would be so deceiving
[45:27] that it would deceive even the very
[45:29] elect if it were possible
[45:32] but we know that's not possible
[45:34] let's read the scripture
[45:36] Colossians 1
[45:39] 21 to 29.
[45:46] foreign
[45:49] that were sometimes alienated and
[45:52] enemies
[45:54] in your mind by Wicked Works yet now
[45:57] hath he reconciled in the body
[46:01] of his flesh through death to present
[46:05] you holy and unblameable and
[46:08] unreprovable in his sight
[46:12] if ye continue in the faith in the
[46:15] revelation
[46:16] grounded and settled and be not moved
[46:20] away from the hope of the Gospel which
[46:23] you have heard and which was preached to
[46:26] every creature which is under Heaven
[46:28] whereof I Paul and made a minister
[46:33] who now rejoice in my sufferings for you
[46:36] and fill up that which is behind of the
[46:39] afflictions of Christ in my flesh for
[46:42] his body's sake which is the church
[46:47] whereof I am made a Ministry repeat he
[46:51] repeats that
[46:53] I am made a minister Pastor Simon has
[46:56] made a minister brother Tim
[46:58] brother Chris brother Philip
[47:00] brother Desmond brother Kofi brother uh
[47:03] Corey ministers God has provided
[47:08] ministers in this hour amen whereof I am
[47:11] made a minister according to the
[47:14] dispensation of God which is given to me
[47:18] for you
[47:19] we need to recognize the hour that we're
[47:23] living in the word that is being
[47:25] provided the five-fold ministry that God
[47:28] has provided for us to minister the word
[47:31] to give us the kind of faith that we are
[47:34] going to need to receive and go in the
[47:38] rapture
[47:40] notice according to the dispensation of
[47:44] God
[47:45] that's been given unto me that's been
[47:47] given unto us ministers in this hour to
[47:50] bring the mind of God and the will of
[47:53] God and the only way we can do that is
[47:55] recognize the supernatural element of
[47:58] the ministry
[47:59] that it's God that ministers and speaks
[48:02] his word to you as an individual
[48:05] it's God that is calling not a group
[48:08] he's calling you you you
[48:12] every single one of you
[48:14] to the attention of your position in the
[48:17] word of God Amen
[48:19] even the mystery which
[48:23] hath being hid from ages and from
[48:25] Generations
[48:27] but now is made manifest to his Saints
[48:31] to whom God would would make known what
[48:35] is the richest of the glory of this
[48:38] ministry among the Gentiles which is
[48:42] Christ
[48:44] in you
[48:45] wow
[48:47] you know this word it just becomes more
[48:51] and more alive every time you you read
[48:54] it and and you come under the anointing
[48:56] of the Holy Spirit
[48:57] amen the hope of glory whom we preach
[49:01] warning every man and teaching every man
[49:05] and all wisdom that we may present every
[49:08] man perfect in Christ Jesus where unto I
[49:12] also labor striving according to his
[49:16] working which worketh in me mightily
[49:20] may the Lord add his Blessing to the
[49:22] word you may be seated
[49:24] I trust this morning that the word is
[49:28] going to work mightily in each and every
[49:30] one of us and it's going to bring us to
[49:33] a place where we can recognize the hour
[49:35] that we're living in the dispensation
[49:37] the time how wonderful is this
[49:40] dispensation how wonderful is the work
[49:43] of God in each and every one of our
[49:45] Lives amen you know go to the uh to the
[49:49] next slide
[49:50] now I only added this slide this morning
[49:54] because you know I've been reading the
[49:58] supernatural book I took it with me book
[50:00] six when we went down south and and I'm
[50:03] probably three quarters of the way
[50:04] through it now and I was reading it and
[50:07] I was getting so blessed Saints
[50:10] I adjure you
[50:11] read those Supernatural books as often
[50:15] as you can they will bless you they will
[50:18] give you present Revelation things that
[50:23] God is doing even right now in the midst
[50:25] of his people amen because remember he's
[50:28] the same yesterday today and forever
[50:30] I got nothing new to bring you to you
[50:33] this morning there's nothing new okay if
[50:37] there's if there was anything that that
[50:39] I had to do then Christ going to the
[50:41] Cross would have been
[50:43] for none
[50:44] he did it all he provided it all and and
[50:48] especially in the day in the hour that
[50:50] we're living in right now and so this
[50:52] morning I was reading it and uh you know
[50:55] I came to the place where where uh uh
[50:58] the brother that wrote the book he came
[51:00] to the place where where brother Branham
[51:02] preached on Christ The Mystery of God
[51:03] revealed and I realized as I was reading
[51:06] it that it was the scripture
[51:08] that the Lord inspired me to use
[51:13] uh days ago for this message
[51:16] and it was the same scripture of
[51:18] Colossians and it struck me and I
[51:20] thought oh so then as I was reading
[51:23] through his you know as as I was reading
[51:25] it I came to this place here and and
[51:28] this is you know around a lot around the
[51:31] thought of where we're going and the
[51:32] hour that we're living in and what it is
[51:34] that's really taking place in this hour
[51:36] and so I took this quote and and brother
[51:39] Bram speaking here in the in the message
[51:41] he says not knowing of course being
[51:43] spiritual you watch spiritual things
[51:47] not knowing this God knows it but if you
[51:51] turn and look at the clock it's on the
[51:54] dot two o'clock the end of the second
[51:57] pull the third pull is at hand see at at
[52:01] the name of Jesus bowing falling
[52:04] prostrate At His Feet King of Kings in
[52:08] heaven will crown him when our journey
[52:10] is complete precious name second pull
[52:14] has been made manifest hope of Earth and
[52:18] Joy Of Heaven he's singing Here precious
[52:20] name oh how sweet hope of Earth and Joy
[52:24] Of Heaven did you notice the spirit take
[52:27] the song the same song and picking it up
[52:30] an octave higher like that that next
[52:33] pull is at hand amen uh-huh take the
[52:37] name of Jesus with you it's later than
[52:40] you think
[52:41] and that really struck me and I you know
[52:44] the spirit of God you know has been just
[52:47] blessing my heart with you know with the
[52:51] the the present stage of the ministry of
[52:53] the Bride of Jesus Christ and how that
[52:56] Ministry came about and how powerful
[52:59] that Ministry is and it's all under the
[53:02] opening of the word and everything that
[53:04] took place in 1963 when the spirit of
[53:08] God the mighty Angel himself came down
[53:11] to say that time shall be no more and
[53:15] that now there would be a message there
[53:17] would be a dispensational change that
[53:20] would take place that would come to the
[53:22] anointed Sons and Daughters of God in
[53:26] order to receive the word that they
[53:28] would need to overcome in this day and
[53:30] in this hour
[53:32] when Christ came down in 1963 we came
[53:36] down
[53:37] because the attributes of God were in
[53:40] him amen and he was expressing them and
[53:43] he was now coming to redeem them he was
[53:46] coming to call them amen praise God
[53:49] and so next verse uh Slide the God of
[53:53] this evil age now the little
[53:56] humble little bride of Christ just
[53:58] simply believes the word
[54:01] whoever she is it's individuals it's not
[54:05] God calling churches
[54:07] that party's over
[54:10] I mean we can get into all kinds you
[54:12] know we know that that brother Branham
[54:14] came here in 1963 those seals were open
[54:17] 1964 he preached the indictment of of of
[54:21] of the churches that there would be no
[54:24] more possibility that churches could
[54:27] actually repent
[54:29] it's God's individual Sons and Daughters
[54:32] of God that he's calling now
[54:35] it's no more to the churches it's God
[54:38] calling individuals out of the churches
[54:41] in leadership he says God's calling
[54:44] individuals I stand at the door and
[54:47] knock if any if any man any person one
[54:51] individual out of a thousand it could be
[54:54] one out of a million
[54:58] wow
[54:59] God is calling you
[55:02] amen God is speaking to you
[55:05] God wants you to recognize the time the
[55:08] season
[55:11] now here brother Branham
[55:14] was was living in in such a time when he
[55:18] reached the Pinnacle of his ministry
[55:22] where where he said in in the seventh
[55:25] seal I like to add this that of all the
[55:27] services I've ever had in my life
[55:29] I believe this week has been the most
[55:32] glorious time of my life in services
[55:36] no matter what I have I've seen great
[55:38] Miracles performed of course before in
[55:41] healing services but this is beyond that
[55:47] it's been one of the greatest time
[55:49] highlights of my life is is to be here
[55:52] and seeing this little Tabernacle take
[55:55] on the different look not only that but
[55:58] the inside has taken on a different look
[56:00] everything changed from that moment on
[56:06] and I want you to know that at that time
[56:08] in that moment a squeeze Came Upon Our
[56:11] prophet
[56:12] and pressure Came Upon him over the next
[56:16] few months over the next several months
[56:18] he was actually contemplating to quit
[56:21] and actually become a mountaineer just
[56:24] take his family and go into the
[56:25] mountains because he got so depressed
[56:28] because all the doors started to shut
[56:30] when the word was made manifest you see
[56:33] the word came on the scene and the word
[56:36] never changes Jesus Christ imagine God
[56:39] himself walking on the Earth
[56:43] and they rejected him they called him
[56:45] Beelzebub when the moment that he
[56:48] started to speak the word and he started
[56:50] to reveal the word because remember it's
[56:53] all about the word it's all about him
[56:55] bringing us back
[56:58] and there's only one way that we can
[57:00] come back and that's by the
[57:02] unadulterated word of God
[57:05] but we're living in a Time
[57:08] of great deception
[57:13] we're living in a time where the world
[57:16] in the same way that the world
[57:19] and that in the same way that we are
[57:22] Awakening
[57:24] in the same way that we're Awakening to
[57:26] Who We Are
[57:27] there's another Great Awakening taking
[57:30] place in the world
[57:32] let's look at the next slide
[57:35] there's a Rapture Awakening
[57:38] versus an astrological Awakening
[57:44] we're in right now in the age of Pisces
[57:48] the age of Pisces is now moving from the
[57:51] age of Pisces into the age of Aquarius
[57:55] we're in a transitional stage right now
[57:58] we're probably already in the age of
[58:00] Aquarius
[58:02] it's known that we're that likely
[58:05] because of the circumstances around it
[58:08] now the Lord led me to these things and
[58:10] I was wondering you know like because
[58:12] this Awakening
[58:15] is real to us
[58:17] but it's just as real
[58:19] to those that have not received this
[58:22] word
[58:24] they're being affected
[58:26] by the atmospheres of the spirit of God
[58:29] and the anointing because remember
[58:33] the white horse rider that that first
[58:36] seal that first right white horse rider
[58:38] that went out it was a writer of
[58:40] deception
[58:42] it it continued to ride through every
[58:45] one of those dispensations and it's
[58:47] writing today it still rides in this day
[58:50] and in this hour
[58:51] and it's purpose and its desire is to
[58:55] get you to disbelieve the word of God
[58:57] it's always been the purpose the enemy
[59:01] wants to do one thing
[59:03] gets you off the word
[59:05] he hates the fact that you can receive
[59:08] Revelation and he can't
[59:12] he can't stand that and so he fights up
[59:15] because he can't understand it he he it
[59:19] boggles his mind
[59:20] but he can never receive Revelation
[59:23] because he is not from God
[59:26] he was created
[59:29] and so anything that is created
[59:32] has a beginning and will have an end
[59:35] anything that is an attribute of God
[59:37] that comes from the mind of God
[59:40] had no beginning and can have no end
[59:44] and therefore Revelation is reserved
[59:47] only for
[59:49] Eternal attributes of God
[59:52] they can only be received by Eternal
[59:55] attributes of God
[59:58] and we need to recognize how significant
[1:00:01] that is
[1:00:03] because it's what differentiates the
[1:00:06] rapture
[1:00:07] from The New Age movement and the
[1:00:10] transition and the the Transcendence
[1:00:15] the journey into Collective
[1:00:16] Transcendence that they are experiencing
[1:00:19] which is becoming very powerful
[1:00:22] in this day and in this hour
[1:00:24] we need to be aware of that
[1:00:27] I believe that's why the Lord just led
[1:00:29] me into this let's go to the next slide
[1:00:32] it talks about the age of Pisces now I
[1:00:34] got this information in research over
[1:00:37] the internet
[1:00:38] and I thought yeah this makes sense to
[1:00:40] me
[1:00:41] and so here the age of Pisces has shaped
[1:00:44] human history for around 2 000 years
[1:00:49] and is slowly Con coming to an end as
[1:00:52] the age of Aquarius takes its turn
[1:00:54] there is no firm consensus among
[1:00:57] astrologers as to when the age of Pisces
[1:01:00] began and even less to when it ends
[1:01:04] exactly but what is certain is that the
[1:01:07] transition between these true these two
[1:01:10] astrological ages has already started
[1:01:14] and one of its biggest aspects is the
[1:01:17] battle between science and religion
[1:01:20] that has marked the development of Human
[1:01:23] Society for the past centuries
[1:01:26] the age of Pisces defines the time where
[1:01:30] human beings engaged more than ever in
[1:01:33] the matters of the Soul
[1:01:35] the ideas of human transcendence
[1:01:38] disillusion of the self and connection
[1:01:41] to a higher ideal Consolidated in the
[1:01:44] collective Consciousness and took shape
[1:01:47] in various forms the birth of Jesus
[1:01:50] Christ the founding of the church and
[1:01:53] the establishment of one fundamental
[1:01:55] religion were a few great marks of this
[1:01:58] time which influence human life until
[1:02:02] today
[1:02:03] did not Jesus say when he was on the
[1:02:06] earth I'm going to make you Fishers of
[1:02:09] Men
[1:02:11] the dispensation of Pisces
[1:02:13] did did not you know if you start to
[1:02:17] really pay attention you will see the
[1:02:19] fish symbol the fish symbol is the fish
[1:02:21] symbol for Christianity it's you know
[1:02:24] the pope has has a fish right on his
[1:02:26] head
[1:02:28] looks just like a fish with his mouth
[1:02:30] open you see all these things that that
[1:02:34] that we you know sometimes we don't
[1:02:36] realize it but it's happening it's a
[1:02:38] it's going on around us it's it's taking
[1:02:41] place and so we know that we've gone
[1:02:43] through a a huge Spiritual Awakening
[1:02:47] if there was ever a time where I mean
[1:02:49] God sent us a 20th century prophet in
[1:02:52] this day and in this hour for the
[1:02:55] purpose of opening our eyes to the
[1:02:59] revelation of who we were as Sons and
[1:03:01] Daughters of God
[1:03:03] we need to recognize just how powerful
[1:03:05] this dispensation was
[1:03:07] but we're now transitioning into
[1:03:09] Aquarius
[1:03:11] next slide
[1:03:14] the age of Aquarius symbolizes the time
[1:03:16] of Discovery Innovation and progress
[1:03:19] it represents the thirst for Change and
[1:03:23] the longing for a better future
[1:03:26] ruler of the collective Aquarius
[1:03:29] speaks of humanitarian ideals
[1:03:32] cooperation and Brotherhood it also
[1:03:35] rules the Realms of the personal and
[1:03:37] Collective mind the searching and
[1:03:40] sharing of information
[1:03:42] and the flight and the fight for
[1:03:44] personal and intellectual freedom
[1:03:47] have we not been experiencing that
[1:03:50] especially you know just you know
[1:03:52] probably started really strong in the
[1:03:55] days of Martin of Martin Luther King
[1:03:58] you know when when uh you know there was
[1:04:00] a a great movement you know I mean we
[1:04:03] know that there's been a lot of it in
[1:04:04] seed form that started with you know
[1:04:07] with the blacks and slavery and
[1:04:09] everything else but you know it just has
[1:04:11] been evolving in people wanting to be
[1:04:13] identified wanting to be identified and
[1:04:16] and recognized as individuals and that
[1:04:19] that they have a place and and and so
[1:04:22] forth and and so this has you know been
[1:04:24] been you know a fight for personal
[1:04:27] intellectual Freedom at the same time
[1:04:29] science has been developing in a faster
[1:04:32] rate each year
[1:04:33] I mean look at technology look at where
[1:04:36] we're at where are we going to be I
[1:04:38] believe it was Nikola Tesla said that
[1:04:40] that you know as science continues
[1:04:43] um to uh enter and and look into the the
[1:04:47] the metaphysical you know the the Beyond
[1:04:51] uh science into the into the
[1:04:54] metaphysical Realms that they'll be able
[1:04:56] to achieve in 10 years
[1:04:59] more than they've achieved in decades
[1:05:02] and hundreds of years
[1:05:04] why because Daniel said knowledge would
[1:05:07] increase in this day it's the hour for
[1:05:10] these things to happen
[1:05:12] and we need to recognize and so at the
[1:05:15] same time science has been developing a
[1:05:17] faster rate each year and has already
[1:05:18] completely changed societal structures
[1:05:21] technological advancement permitted the
[1:05:24] invention of machines internet opened a
[1:05:27] full range of new possibilities for
[1:05:29] social connections social media
[1:05:32] completely changed the way human beings
[1:05:34] interact
[1:05:36] and globalization may be one of the
[1:05:39] greatest marks of this age
[1:05:42] how else
[1:05:43] is the whole world going to know about
[1:05:47] Jesus Christ
[1:05:50] moreover Collective thinking and
[1:05:52] technological advancements are
[1:05:55] contributing to the fight against social
[1:05:57] and economic inequality and the fight
[1:06:01] for expression and freedom of identity
[1:06:03] has opened the door for more diversity
[1:06:06] and acceptance now today we've got
[1:06:11] he she them
[1:06:13] neutral gender
[1:06:15] you can call yourself a toothpick if you
[1:06:18] want
[1:06:21] it's opened up to absolutely a place
[1:06:25] where there's just no sense anymore
[1:06:30] the word of God has been just completely
[1:06:33] put aside
[1:06:36] it was Adam and Eve god listen in God
[1:06:40] like we can I've had Communications with
[1:06:43] with people about this topic and I tell
[1:06:47] them yes God in his
[1:06:51] Elohim
[1:06:53] position
[1:06:55] in the beginning Elohim the
[1:06:58] self-existent one
[1:07:00] there was male and female in God
[1:07:05] absolutely
[1:07:07] but you need to come to the to the
[1:07:09] understanding of the age the time the
[1:07:12] season and the planet that you're on
[1:07:17] I don't doubt that there was thousands
[1:07:19] of Worlds the Bible says that the worlds
[1:07:22] didn't say world
[1:07:24] it said worlds
[1:07:26] were framed by the word of God
[1:07:29] there may have been a thousand other
[1:07:31] existences and human civilizations
[1:07:34] before ours
[1:07:36] it's very possible and most likely was
[1:07:39] because God is eternal
[1:07:41] there's no time or space in God
[1:07:44] we only speak in time or space but the
[1:07:46] moment you break out of this Dimension
[1:07:49] you're in an eternal Circle where all
[1:07:52] things
[1:07:53] are now
[1:07:55] that's why you hear about people that
[1:07:56] have these you know uh near-death
[1:07:59] experiences and they enter into death
[1:08:01] for a moment and they say that their
[1:08:03] whole life flashes before their eyes
[1:08:06] well of course because the moment you
[1:08:09] step into that Dimension it's Eternal
[1:08:11] you'll be able to see past future what
[1:08:14] happened yesterday what happened a year
[1:08:16] 10 000 years ago because it's in the
[1:08:19] mind of God
[1:08:21] there's nothing impossible that's why
[1:08:23] when we receive these Revelations from
[1:08:26] the Lord Saints this is this is only the
[1:08:29] beginning
[1:08:31] what is going to take us out of this
[1:08:33] Dimension it's going to be the
[1:08:35] Revelation it's going to be God's mind
[1:08:37] being revealed to you more and more
[1:08:40] about why you were here where you are
[1:08:43] going where you came from and where
[1:08:46] you're headed everything that that all
[1:08:49] those questions in your mind but we are
[1:08:51] so human in these vessels of clay
[1:08:54] we get so discouraged we get so beat up
[1:08:57] sometimes we get so down on ourselves
[1:09:00] you know it's a paradox Saints once in a
[1:09:03] while you're going to sit there like I
[1:09:05] do and one minute you're you're you're
[1:09:07] you're down and you're out and you're
[1:09:08] thinking about your future you're
[1:09:10] thinking about your pension you're
[1:09:12] thinking about your retirement you're
[1:09:14] thinking about your health you're you
[1:09:15] know you're you got all these things
[1:09:17] hitting you from this side and this in
[1:09:18] the next second you're in this dimension
[1:09:21] of Eternal attribute
[1:09:24] that cannot disbelieve the word of God
[1:09:28] and God said you're Justified you're
[1:09:30] you're glorified you everything that you
[1:09:34] are you already were
[1:09:37] Glory
[1:09:40] I mean that blows my mind
[1:09:43] when that when that thought comes and
[1:09:45] and it just becomes a reality it just
[1:09:48] changes everything
[1:09:51] it's it sets you free it liberates you
[1:09:53] in such a way that you know that that
[1:09:55] yeah you know you it actually gives you
[1:09:58] the strength if you receive that in the
[1:10:00] right way
[1:10:02] you get overcoming power because that's
[1:10:04] the revelation God gives us
[1:10:07] he gives us Faith to overcome
[1:10:10] not to get discouraged and look at all
[1:10:13] of our all the issues and get to a point
[1:10:16] where we want to commit suicide
[1:10:18] that's a demon from the pits of hell
[1:10:22] and that suicide demon is so strong
[1:10:24] these days it's one of the biggest uh
[1:10:28] takers of of the young people's lives in
[1:10:31] North America right now
[1:10:35] because they can't fathom
[1:10:37] they can't get their mind around the
[1:10:40] pressure of this life
[1:10:42] and so they want to give up
[1:10:45] but we're not
[1:10:47] give upers
[1:10:49] we are Overcomers
[1:10:51] [Applause]
[1:10:53] all that all that you need
[1:10:56] all that all that God requires
[1:10:59] is for you to believe his word
[1:11:03] and faith will come to you
[1:11:06] I was saying the last you know the last
[1:11:08] time I ministered that you know Faith
[1:11:10] needs to come to the youngest of our
[1:11:13] children
[1:11:14] in order for them to overcome this age
[1:11:17] we as the parents all we can do is teach
[1:11:21] them and show them and read the word of
[1:11:24] God to them bring them into the house of
[1:11:25] the Lord teach him about the word of God
[1:11:28] but it's the spirit of God that gives
[1:11:31] them faith
[1:11:33] and when that faith comes in it's not
[1:11:35] something that they need to interpret it
[1:11:39] interprets itself
[1:11:41] you don't need to tell me or Pastor
[1:11:44] Simon or the deacons if you've got faith
[1:11:48] we see it because it's going to manifest
[1:11:52] in your walk it's going to manifest in
[1:11:54] your talk it's going to manifest in your
[1:11:57] in your life in your experiences because
[1:12:00] faith is is a substance it's something
[1:12:04] real
[1:12:07] Hallelujah
[1:12:11] let's go to the next okay the last uh uh
[1:12:14] paragraph but the fight for Freedom also
[1:12:18] pays a price
[1:12:20] On the Dark Side of Aquarian age lies
[1:12:23] disorder
[1:12:24] Rebellion
[1:12:26] breaking of rules skepticism and the
[1:12:29] change above everything mentality the
[1:12:33] current growth of progressive thinking
[1:12:35] has created a counter current of
[1:12:38] conservatism discrimination religious
[1:12:41] Fanatics and the obsession with
[1:12:43] technological advancements has also
[1:12:46] brought negative consequences to the
[1:12:48] world we live in now that's the truth
[1:12:52] my God if there's ever been a time of
[1:12:55] rebellion and disorder and and the
[1:12:58] things that we've been seeing people
[1:12:59] like
[1:13:01] Canada
[1:13:02] is a divided nation right now
[1:13:05] we saw it happening in the U.S when you
[1:13:07] know when the election took place there
[1:13:09] with Trump and and Biden and we saw a
[1:13:12] country that was completely divided
[1:13:15] well that's all part of this age that's
[1:13:17] all part of the deception it's all part
[1:13:20] of the plan of the God of this evil age
[1:13:23] to bring the world into Absolute Total
[1:13:27] uh chaos
[1:13:29] it's going to lead into the Great
[1:13:31] Tribulation
[1:13:32] that this world is going to be going
[1:13:34] into there's nothing that we can do to
[1:13:36] stop that
[1:13:37] the conditions of the world the
[1:13:40] conditions of Politics the conditions of
[1:13:42] the people the mindset of the people the
[1:13:45] Revelation that's that's being bombarded
[1:13:48] upon the people Satan's Revelation
[1:13:51] Satan's teachings
[1:13:53] New Age teachings on on you know that
[1:13:57] you you can be God
[1:14:02] that you are God I am I hear people
[1:14:05] saying I am God
[1:14:08] I know they got no revelation
[1:14:11] because of where they're coming from
[1:14:15] but if you say I am an attribute of God
[1:14:20] and I have a revelation of what God is
[1:14:22] doing in this day
[1:14:24] that's a totally different
[1:14:26] statement
[1:14:28] two different worlds you see
[1:14:31] because the minute you take Jesus Christ
[1:14:34] out of the equation
[1:14:37] everything falls apart
[1:14:41] it can only lead
[1:14:43] to destruction
[1:14:45] it's not going to lead
[1:14:48] to a rapture
[1:14:50] it's not going to lead to a millennial
[1:14:52] Reign where you will reign as part of
[1:14:56] God's economy
[1:14:57] listen
[1:14:59] this Plan of Redemption
[1:15:01] is what we are dealing with
[1:15:04] this is Who We Are
[1:15:06] the Bible was given for that purpose
[1:15:09] it's the game plan
[1:15:12] it's the instruction
[1:15:14] it's the doors that open other doors
[1:15:17] and in 1963 a door was opened
[1:15:22] let's let's move on because I don't want
[1:15:24] to get ahead of myself
[1:15:25] so in final words the Rapture
[1:15:27] dispensational change versus the
[1:15:30] astrological transition in final words
[1:15:33] the transition of the age of Pisces to
[1:15:36] the age of Aquarius represents the
[1:15:39] battle between two different systems
[1:15:41] progress versus tradition mind versus
[1:15:45] soul
[1:15:47] or God versus machine
[1:15:51] but it also represents the possibility
[1:15:53] for joining the spiritual to the
[1:15:56] collective a time in which the longing
[1:15:59] for Transcendence and divine connection
[1:16:02] surpasses the barriers of identity race
[1:16:05] color and social status to the place
[1:16:08] where all Humanity May reach the Eternal
[1:16:11] Universal collection
[1:16:13] it sounds great
[1:16:17] and there's a lot of Truth in that
[1:16:20] if you bring it into the context of who
[1:16:23] we are as Sons and Daughters of God as
[1:16:27] those that have that that have received
[1:16:30] the the the the word for our day that
[1:16:33] have received the instruction that God
[1:16:36] listen God has provided instruction just
[1:16:39] in the same way that he did with the
[1:16:41] children of Israel people believe the
[1:16:44] Bible
[1:16:45] there's so many different Christian
[1:16:46] denominations out there they're
[1:16:48] preaching from the same Bible every
[1:16:50] Sunday they believe the word
[1:16:53] but yet they're not willing to accept
[1:16:55] what God did that he's the same
[1:16:58] yesterday today and forever
[1:17:00] and that God deals with people in the
[1:17:02] same way when God was going to liberate
[1:17:06] the children of Israel out of Egypt God
[1:17:09] decided to send a Moses
[1:17:11] right he sent a messenger to liberate
[1:17:15] the children
[1:17:16] so God has a provided way of doing all
[1:17:19] things and we need to recognize that and
[1:17:22] come under it and come under that
[1:17:25] leadership come under that instruction
[1:17:27] recognize what God is doing in this day
[1:17:30] don't get caught up with going you know
[1:17:34] into science and and transcending into
[1:17:37] these areas because look Transcendence
[1:17:40] meaning in the dictionary is existence
[1:17:42] or experience beyond the normal or
[1:17:45] physical level they're trying to break
[1:17:48] into dimensional change they're talking
[1:17:50] about it if you talk to the New Age
[1:17:53] movement people that are that are that
[1:17:56] are in it and I'm not against them
[1:17:59] I I know many of them and I love them
[1:18:04] I'm not against them
[1:18:07] I'm talking about the missing link
[1:18:11] that would that would take all their
[1:18:14] thinking
[1:18:15] and bring it so perfect perfectly
[1:18:17] together if they could recognize
[1:18:20] the key element of Jesus Christ
[1:18:24] and all that was was that Jesus was God
[1:18:30] Source they call it
[1:18:32] Elohim the universe
[1:18:36] the self-existent one they've got so
[1:18:38] many names
[1:18:40] energy call it what you want we know it
[1:18:43] as Elohim God
[1:18:46] the self-existent one
[1:18:48] the Eternal God the Creator he's Eternal
[1:18:53] having no beginning and no end we're
[1:18:55] talking about the same thing here
[1:18:57] but yet you're missing the formula
[1:19:00] you're missing the game plan you're
[1:19:02] missing why Jesus Christ had to come to
[1:19:05] the Earth your your own birth
[1:19:07] certificate Bears record that he came
[1:19:10] when you look at your driver's license
[1:19:12] they ask you when were you born I was
[1:19:14] born
[1:19:15] 1961 years after Christ
[1:19:23] I don't care who you are
[1:19:26] that alone is going to be a testimony
[1:19:28] against you
[1:19:30] if you don't accept it
[1:19:32] but you need to recognize God's provided
[1:19:35] way
[1:19:37] let's move on
[1:19:40] now just to confirm you know we're
[1:19:42] talking about the astrological uh uh
[1:19:45] process and understanding astronomy you
[1:19:49] know that uh an astronomer came to
[1:19:51] brother Branham one day
[1:19:54] and I'm just going to read this and I
[1:19:55] just you know when I when I got that
[1:19:58] information I thought you know I'm just
[1:19:59] going to throw this in the Lord just led
[1:20:01] me to bring this in and and so I'm just
[1:20:03] going to read so the now the astronomer
[1:20:05] she was a psychic she's talking to
[1:20:07] brother Branham you can go back and read
[1:20:09] it how the angel came to me and his
[1:20:11] commission okay but he says she said
[1:20:14] maybe I better explain myself she said I
[1:20:17] am an astrologist
[1:20:19] and now I'm also bringing this for
[1:20:21] another reason the Holy Spirit showed me
[1:20:23] he says
[1:20:25] you need to let the people know the
[1:20:27] importance
[1:20:28] of William Miriam Branham
[1:20:31] his ministry was not something that was
[1:20:33] just another religious evangelist
[1:20:37] he's a huge Link in all of this
[1:20:40] and we're going to be looking at that
[1:20:42] and how important it is to recognize his
[1:20:45] ministry his dispensation and why God
[1:20:48] did what he did through him
[1:20:52] why the voice of God
[1:20:56] spoke through William Branham
[1:21:00] she said I'm an astrologer I said I
[1:21:02] thought you was something like that
[1:21:04] she said I'm on my way to Chicago to see
[1:21:07] my boy who's a Baptist Minister I said
[1:21:10] yes ma'am she said anybody ever tell you
[1:21:13] you were born under a sign
[1:21:15] I said no no ma'am
[1:21:18] I lied to her there
[1:21:21] a lot of people say
[1:21:23] the prophet never lied
[1:21:26] never said anything you listen only to
[1:21:29] the tapes
[1:21:30] you only listen to the tapes you say
[1:21:33] exactly what he said forget about you
[1:21:36] getting your own revelation
[1:21:38] no sir
[1:21:40] I got my own revelation
[1:21:42] but I'll say Amen
[1:21:44] to the prophet of God
[1:21:46] every time
[1:21:49] he said
[1:21:51] anybody ever know ma'am I lied to her
[1:21:54] see and I said just wanted to see what
[1:21:56] she was going to say and she said I said
[1:21:59] no ma'am and she said doesn't hasn't
[1:22:02] ministers ever told you I said I don't
[1:22:05] have nothing to do with ministers
[1:22:07] and she said uh-huh and I said she she
[1:22:11] said to me I said well she said if I
[1:22:15] tell you just exactly when you were born
[1:22:17] will you believe me I said no ma'am
[1:22:20] [Laughter]
[1:22:27] he was just a man of like passion
[1:22:31] no ma'am
[1:22:33] and uh
[1:22:37] um
[1:22:40] and she said well I can tell you when
[1:22:42] you were born I said I don't believe it
[1:22:46] and she said you were born on April the
[1:22:49] 6th 1909 at five o'clock in the morning
[1:22:55] now
[1:22:57] God can do anything he wants
[1:23:00] God can reveal in any way that he wants
[1:23:05] and he was making it very clear that
[1:23:07] another gift was coming to the Earth
[1:23:10] in the 20th century that would change
[1:23:13] religion
[1:23:15] and Christianity forever
[1:23:20] and I said that's right
[1:23:22] I said how do you know that
[1:23:25] well God knew it
[1:23:29] let's look to the next scripture
[1:23:31] Revelations 10.
[1:23:33] verses 1 to 7.
[1:23:36] you've still got about 45 minutes here
[1:23:41] and I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[1:23:43] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[1:23:46] rainbow was upon his head
[1:23:48] and his face was as it were the son and
[1:23:52] his feet as pillars of Fire
[1:23:54] and he had in his right hand a little
[1:23:56] book
[1:23:58] open
[1:23:59] the book was open
[1:24:02] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[1:24:05] and his left foot on the earth and cried
[1:24:08] with a loud voice as when a lion roarth
[1:24:11] and when he had cried seven Thunders
[1:24:13] uttered their voices and when the seven
[1:24:17] Thunders
[1:24:18] had uttered their voices I was about to
[1:24:21] write
[1:24:23] and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying
[1:24:25] unto me seal up those things which the
[1:24:28] seven Thunders uttered and right them
[1:24:31] not
[1:24:32] and the angel which I saw stand upon the
[1:24:35] sea and upon the Earth lifted up his
[1:24:37] hand to heaven and swear by him that
[1:24:39] liveth forever and ever who created
[1:24:41] heaven and the things that therein are
[1:24:44] and the earth and the things that
[1:24:46] therein are and the Sea and the things
[1:24:48] which are therein that there should be
[1:24:52] time no longer
[1:24:53] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:24:56] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:24:58] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:25:00] finished as he hath declared to his
[1:25:03] servants the prophets we have read this
[1:25:06] scripture many many times we know what
[1:25:10] it represents
[1:25:12] but even more so as as we approach that
[1:25:17] final stage of our ministry
[1:25:20] because I want you to know that you have
[1:25:23] a Ministry
[1:25:24] I want you to know that when the mighty
[1:25:26] angel came down in 1963 it was Christ
[1:25:31] himself coming down to possess and
[1:25:34] redeem every attribute son and daughter
[1:25:38] of God to bring them back into their
[1:25:41] position as miniature gods
[1:25:46] as little Messiahs
[1:25:48] now I say that in a humble way I don't
[1:25:51] say that in a way to say that oh we are
[1:25:53] Gods because then I'd be putting myself
[1:25:55] in the same category as as you know this
[1:25:58] New Age movement
[1:26:00] no
[1:26:01] God is God but God had attributes God
[1:26:07] expressed himself like he did in the
[1:26:10] Garden of Eden when he expressed Adam in
[1:26:13] His image Adam was in the image of God
[1:26:16] and God took from Adam the female aspect
[1:26:21] that's why from the womb of man
[1:26:25] he took one man and created the woman he
[1:26:30] took the female aspect of himself so
[1:26:34] that he could have Fellowship
[1:26:36] and we need to understand that as an
[1:26:40] attribute of God we are a portion we are
[1:26:43] a thought that has been expressed from
[1:26:47] God
[1:26:48] into this dimension
[1:26:50] because remember we got to deal with
[1:26:52] this dimension let's not get carried
[1:26:55] away you know you talk to people they
[1:26:56] want to talk about a hundred thousand
[1:26:58] years ago and about the you know the the
[1:27:00] different races and you can go into
[1:27:03] caves and you can see their writings on
[1:27:05] the caves and they're proven to be
[1:27:06] thousands of years old and all this
[1:27:08] that's great but that's not what we're
[1:27:11] dealing with
[1:27:12] we're dealing with a war right now in
[1:27:14] the Ukraine
[1:27:15] that could eventually turn into World
[1:27:17] War III
[1:27:19] and the world is in the condition that
[1:27:21] it's in because the scripture said it
[1:27:23] would be in that condition
[1:27:25] and so we need to realize as attributes
[1:27:28] of God now we are Awakening
[1:27:31] to Who We Are
[1:27:33] the position of who we are as Sons and
[1:27:36] Daughters of God
[1:27:38] listen to brother Branham next slide in
[1:27:40] 1963 the first seal and then there's
[1:27:43] coming forth seven mysterious Thunders
[1:27:45] that's not even written at all that's
[1:27:48] right I believe that through those seven
[1:27:51] Thunders will be revealed in the last
[1:27:54] days in order to get the bride together
[1:27:57] for rapturing Faith because what we got
[1:28:00] right now we won't be able to do it
[1:28:05] you know you could take that statement
[1:28:07] right there
[1:28:08] and I'm telling you that you know well
[1:28:10] let's read on there's something we've
[1:28:12] got to step farther
[1:28:17] we can't have enough faith for Divine
[1:28:19] Healing hardly
[1:28:21] we got to have enough Faith to be
[1:28:23] changed in a moment and be swept up out
[1:28:26] of this Earth and will find that after a
[1:28:28] while the Lord willing find where it's
[1:28:31] written
[1:28:32] and so you're going to need I'm gonna
[1:28:35] need we're all under the expected we
[1:28:38] need to be under the right expectation
[1:28:40] of what it is that we need in order to
[1:28:43] take the rapture
[1:28:44] because remember
[1:28:46] even that new age teaching is telling us
[1:28:50] that the world in the age of Aquarius is
[1:28:54] going into total chaos
[1:28:57] there's going to be more war there's
[1:28:59] going to be destruction like never
[1:29:01] before but there's going to transcend a
[1:29:05] people out of that chaos that are going
[1:29:09] to not be part of that and so they look
[1:29:12] at it and I've talked to them they look
[1:29:14] at death in the same way sometimes like
[1:29:17] they welcome it they go I'm just going
[1:29:19] to go into that other dimension I'm
[1:29:21] looking forward to it
[1:29:23] s Earth is no good anymore look at
[1:29:25] there's nothing I can't I can't do
[1:29:27] anything of Great Value here on this
[1:29:30] Earth it's all political control
[1:29:33] and it's true
[1:29:35] it is all political control we talked
[1:29:37] about it's everything that they talk
[1:29:39] about is in the scripture that's where
[1:29:42] it started they're looking at the
[1:29:44] astrology which is also God's Bible by
[1:29:49] the way
[1:29:50] you can look at the 12 planets or the
[1:29:53] the the the 12 months of the year
[1:29:55] and then Jesus Christ as the son and
[1:29:58] those planets revolving around the Sun
[1:30:01] it's all there
[1:30:02] that Bible that they're talking about
[1:30:05] and they call it astrology it's all in
[1:30:07] the word of God Jesus Christ is the
[1:30:10] focal point of it all but they fail to
[1:30:13] recognize that they will not oh Jesus
[1:30:15] reached the State of Consciousness that
[1:30:18] we should all try and reach a state of I
[1:30:21] agree
[1:30:24] but they're leaving out everything that
[1:30:26] leads them
[1:30:27] to that condition
[1:30:30] and that's why it's so important to
[1:30:32] recognize the word for our day because
[1:30:35] in that word is contained the perfect
[1:30:38] Faith the rapturing faith rapturing
[1:30:42] Revelation the the mind of God what it's
[1:30:45] going to take if the same spirit that
[1:30:47] raised Christ from the dead if it dwells
[1:30:50] in you it'll speed up your molecules
[1:30:53] it'll Quicken your mortal body you talk
[1:30:56] to the new agers they talk about yes
[1:30:59] it's a frequency if we can speed up to
[1:31:01] the frequency of the next Dimension
[1:31:03] it'll put us into that Dimension exactly
[1:31:05] right Hallelujah
[1:31:08] amen
[1:31:10] they're missing the quickening power
[1:31:13] which is the Holy Ghost
[1:31:15] you're going to need the quickening
[1:31:17] power in order to make that dimensional
[1:31:20] change and the moment you do not accept
[1:31:23] that he went to the Cross I'm going to
[1:31:26] make it as simple as possible even for
[1:31:28] the youngest person in here Jesus died
[1:31:31] and went to the Cross so that he could
[1:31:34] give up the Holy Ghost which is the
[1:31:37] quickening power so that it could come
[1:31:40] out of him and go into a multiplied form
[1:31:44] into each and every son and daughter of
[1:31:47] God so that they could be quickened from
[1:31:50] this Dimension to the other dimension
[1:31:53] and miss the Great Tribulation that's
[1:31:55] going to come upon the Earth
[1:31:59] that's why when when you when when you
[1:32:02] came to the Lord and you you had that
[1:32:04] experience of of meeting God the first
[1:32:08] thing
[1:32:09] I want the Holy Ghost
[1:32:11] I want the spirit of God in Me
[1:32:14] because that is the key that is the
[1:32:16] formula
[1:32:17] that is the only thing that's going to
[1:32:19] take us out of here next slide
[1:32:23] in the third poll he says now that's the
[1:32:26] reason today that the revivals that
[1:32:29] we're supposed to have we have
[1:32:30] denominational revivals we haven't had a
[1:32:33] real stirring no no no don't think we
[1:32:36] got revivals we haven't oh they've got
[1:32:39] millions and millions and millions of
[1:32:41] church members but not a Revival nowhere
[1:32:44] no no the bride hasn't had a Revival yet
[1:32:47] now you got to remember I'm reading from
[1:32:49] the third seal in 1963 when the seals
[1:32:53] were being opened by this Mighty Angel
[1:32:55] himself
[1:32:56] to reveal what was coming down the road
[1:33:00] okay we need to understand where we were
[1:33:02] and where we're at and so he's saying
[1:33:05] here there was no Revival for the bride
[1:33:08] yet why because it was going to start
[1:33:10] right then and there on the opening of
[1:33:12] that seventh seal
[1:33:15] it was going to change absolutely
[1:33:17] everything
[1:33:18] and the whole Christian world was going
[1:33:21] to dispensationally change from allele
[1:33:25] to seeing time dimension
[1:33:28] into an eternal age led by an eternal
[1:33:32] messenger Jesus Christ The Mighty Angel
[1:33:35] himself
[1:33:37] and there is absolute scientific
[1:33:41] evidence that he actually came to the
[1:33:44] Earth
[1:33:46] there's a cloud right here look into the
[1:33:49] cloud Google search it
[1:33:51] mysterious Cloud
[1:33:53] 1963 sunset Mountain Arizona you will
[1:33:58] see that it was caught by many
[1:34:00] scientists and to this day they still
[1:34:03] can't explain it
[1:34:05] we can
[1:34:08] we're looking for it
[1:34:10] it'll take those seven unknown Thunders
[1:34:13] back there to wake her up again see yeah
[1:34:16] he'll send it he promised it now watch
[1:34:18] and now watch look at where you are
[1:34:21] today here we are over 60 what
[1:34:27] 59 57 years after brother Branham uh
[1:34:32] ministered and the mighty Angel spoke on
[1:34:34] the opening of these seals and here we
[1:34:37] are and look at the dispensation that
[1:34:39] we're in look at the conditions of the
[1:34:42] world tell me that the prophet did not
[1:34:45] already tell us
[1:34:46] that this condition and these things
[1:34:49] were going to happen he told us already
[1:34:52] we knew that these things were coming
[1:34:54] it's the very evidence that we're
[1:34:57] actually going into that Transcendent
[1:34:59] stage of the Rapture that we are going
[1:35:03] to be quickened out of this Dimension
[1:35:05] but it requires a supernatural faith in
[1:35:09] order for that to happen next slide
[1:35:13] and just then
[1:35:16] from the seventh seal he picked me up he
[1:35:18] took me up and sent me way up high to
[1:35:21] where a meeting was going on
[1:35:24] look like a tent or a cathedral or some
[1:35:27] sort and I looked and there was a little
[1:35:30] box like little place over in the side
[1:35:32] and I seen that light was talking to
[1:35:35] somebody above me
[1:35:37] that light that you see there on the
[1:35:39] picture it Whirled away from me like
[1:35:43] that and went over that tent and said
[1:35:46] I'll meet you there now this is an in a
[1:35:49] vision that brother Branham was
[1:35:50] happening having
[1:35:52] and and the voice told them out the
[1:35:54] pillar fired I'll meet you there and a
[1:35:56] lot of people are still waiting for a
[1:35:59] tent
[1:36:00] Vision to be fulfilled
[1:36:02] they're looking for brother Branham some
[1:36:05] people are actually looking for brother
[1:36:06] Branham to raise up again and set up a
[1:36:08] tent and and where there'll be meetings
[1:36:11] again and people will go in and actually
[1:36:13] be discerned you know for situations in
[1:36:15] their lives and and and and there's
[1:36:17] going to be something that's going to
[1:36:19] happen in that form that's not what it
[1:36:21] is listen I'll meet you there and said
[1:36:23] this this will be the third pull
[1:36:28] this is so important for us to
[1:36:30] understand to realize that after 1963
[1:36:35] and brother branham's dispensational
[1:36:37] change went from Brother Branham to the
[1:36:41] mighty angel I had the decrease he said
[1:36:44] so that he could increase Elijah okay
[1:36:46] there came a change and when that
[1:36:50] seventh seal was opened it released the
[1:36:53] seven Thunders
[1:36:55] it released the opening of the word
[1:36:59] and those unknown Thunders it's not
[1:37:02] something that we can explain
[1:37:05] that's why it's so important to go and
[1:37:09] listen to the seals read the Seven Seals
[1:37:12] again listen to The Seven Seals again
[1:37:14] tell people about the Seven Seals let
[1:37:18] them know uh that you know a lot of
[1:37:20] people they say oh you know what when we
[1:37:22] read the book of Revelation it's just so
[1:37:24] hard to understand it
[1:37:25] just say read the Seven Seals
[1:37:29] by William Miriam Branham
[1:37:32] there's information in there that can
[1:37:35] supernaturally Enlighten you
[1:37:39] but we also know that it's only
[1:37:41] if he wants to Enlighten them
[1:37:45] a lot of people say oh so what you're
[1:37:46] making yourself something no I'm not
[1:37:50] why did Jesus walk on the Earth
[1:37:53] walk down a street
[1:37:55] there was thousands of people hundreds
[1:37:57] of people
[1:37:58] they were all all kinds of them touching
[1:38:00] him because they knew he was a Healer
[1:38:03] and one woman touched His Garment and he
[1:38:06] stopped and he says
[1:38:08] somebody touch me
[1:38:11] you you tell me why
[1:38:14] if you can tell me why he did that I can
[1:38:16] tell you why he opens the eyes and he
[1:38:19] shuts the eyes
[1:38:21] he opens the ears and he shuts the ears
[1:38:24] it's the scripture I can't tell you why
[1:38:26] he does it
[1:38:28] I can only tell you what the scripture
[1:38:30] said
[1:38:31] but she had some sort of a
[1:38:33] representation just like the woman at
[1:38:35] the well when Jesus said I have need to
[1:38:37] go to Samaria tonight
[1:38:39] what for
[1:38:41] I got a need to go
[1:38:42] because there was a prostitute who
[1:38:45] happened to have an attribute of God in
[1:38:48] her
[1:38:50] she had representation from before the
[1:38:53] foundations of this world
[1:38:55] we need to recognize that it's not all
[1:38:58] starts right here it doesn't start right
[1:39:01] here
[1:39:01] your human life started here as a little
[1:39:04] baby
[1:39:05] but the attribute of God the soul the
[1:39:08] seed of God that came into you by
[1:39:11] predestination just by the grace of God
[1:39:13] that's why it says by grace are you
[1:39:16] saved because you can talk to a hundred
[1:39:18] people and out of those hundred people
[1:39:19] uh 90 of them will just walk away but
[1:39:22] ten will say Amen
[1:39:25] what is that it's because of Grace
[1:39:28] I didn't do this I didn't do anything to
[1:39:31] deserve you didn't do anything to
[1:39:32] deserve this but God elected God could
[1:39:37] see now it's not I'm going to choose him
[1:39:40] I'm not going to choose her I'm going to
[1:39:42] choose him I'm going to no
[1:39:43] God placed all of us on free moral
[1:39:46] agency
[1:39:47] but he knew that when the time would
[1:39:49] come that the word his plan
[1:39:53] his game plan
[1:39:55] would come and he would give the
[1:39:57] instruction through his fiery ministers
[1:40:00] because God uses man to minister his
[1:40:03] word
[1:40:04] God is using man right now God is not
[1:40:07] using tapes God is using man but the man
[1:40:10] that was in the tapes is still God's
[1:40:13] prophet and he had his time his season
[1:40:16] on the earth he fulfilled his purpose
[1:40:18] and God took him to his reward
[1:40:21] we'll see him again
[1:40:23] but now we've got a work to do and God
[1:40:26] is doing that work through man through
[1:40:29] us through ministers like Paul said this
[1:40:31] dispensation which has been given unto
[1:40:34] me
[1:40:36] I can't help the ministry that God gave
[1:40:38] me you can help the ministry that God
[1:40:39] gave you
[1:40:41] it's what God gave you to fulfill as a
[1:40:45] Son of God or a daughter of God in this
[1:40:48] time
[1:40:49] you can't change it nobody can change it
[1:40:52] and because you do it by Revelation and
[1:40:54] that's why Jesus himself said to Peter
[1:40:57] he says uh
[1:40:59] who do you say that I am because
[1:41:00] remember God walked on the earth he was
[1:41:02] amongst all the people and everybody was
[1:41:04] saying oh he's beelze above this one was
[1:41:06] saying he's the Messiah the other one
[1:41:08] was saying he's a Healer the other one
[1:41:10] was saying oh he can discern people's
[1:41:11] thoughts oh he can raise the Dead
[1:41:15] he turned to Peter he says Peter who do
[1:41:17] you say that I am
[1:41:19] he said Thou Art the Christ
[1:41:22] the anointed word for this day
[1:41:25] the prophecy of as I of Isaiah you are
[1:41:29] that prophecy that would come riding in
[1:41:31] on the fall on the ass of a mule that
[1:41:34] you would come riding into Jerusalem you
[1:41:36] are the Fulfillment of the word of God
[1:41:38] for our day now I kind of exaggerated a
[1:41:42] little bit
[1:41:44] but he recognized that he was the word
[1:41:47] and Jesus looked to him and says Flesh
[1:41:50] and Blood did not reveal this to you
[1:41:52] Peter
[1:41:53] you didn't get this from mama or Papa or
[1:41:57] your priest
[1:41:58] you got this he says from the father
[1:42:03] the father is his spirit
[1:42:06] the father and the Holy Ghost are the
[1:42:08] same
[1:42:09] and Jesus Christ was a vessel that God
[1:42:13] created so that he could dwell in it
[1:42:17] that's it
[1:42:18] it's one God
[1:42:21] and he says flesh and blood has not
[1:42:22] revealed this to you
[1:42:24] but my father
[1:42:26] which is in heaven he hath revealed this
[1:42:28] unto you
[1:42:30] and then he adds and he says
[1:42:32] and I'm going to build a church
[1:42:34] see he had a plan
[1:42:36] I'm going to have a people in the last
[1:42:39] days
[1:42:41] and that's going to be built upon that
[1:42:45] Divine inspired Revelation faith that
[1:42:50] comes directly from the mind of God to
[1:42:53] you as an individual you as an
[1:42:56] individual you as an individual in
[1:43:00] perfect Faith where you can see yourself
[1:43:01] in the word of God now you can see the
[1:43:04] time that you're living in the season
[1:43:06] that you are in and recognize that you
[1:43:08] are a part of that word and that God is
[1:43:11] going to that you're going in the
[1:43:13] rapture you can't help it
[1:43:15] you're just a part of the word
[1:43:17] and the word is going to leave the Earth
[1:43:19] and this world is going to go into chaos
[1:43:21] the only thing that's keeping this world
[1:43:23] together right now is the fact that the
[1:43:26] word which framed the world is still
[1:43:29] here in a calling dispensation right now
[1:43:34] just to bring the last few in
[1:43:38] but we need to recognize what draws the
[1:43:40] last few
[1:43:42] the third pull
[1:43:44] it's not your ability
[1:43:48] to put this message together
[1:43:50] and and quote a million quotes and and
[1:43:54] you could know the Bible better than any
[1:43:56] minister in here
[1:43:59] but without revelation
[1:44:00] it means nothing
[1:44:02] the Bible says the letter killeth but
[1:44:04] the spirit gives it life
[1:44:07] and if you've been awakened by the life
[1:44:11] of Jesus Christ which only comes through
[1:44:14] the message of this hour God's provided
[1:44:16] way God is not the author of confusion
[1:44:19] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:44:21] forever if you want to know what he's
[1:44:22] going to do today just look at what he
[1:44:24] did yesterday
[1:44:26] that's why we say we as ministers we've
[1:44:28] got nothing new to bring we're bringing
[1:44:31] you the quotes we're bringing you the
[1:44:32] word of God we're we're bringing it to
[1:44:35] you the way the Lord inspires us to
[1:44:37] bring it by experience but it takes a
[1:44:40] supernatural element between you and God
[1:44:44] for you to receive it so that you can
[1:44:46] actually live it and overcome this
[1:44:48] dimension
[1:44:53] the seventh seal and just so he says
[1:44:56] that uh this is the third pull and
[1:44:59] there's three great things that goes
[1:45:00] with it and one unfolded today or
[1:45:03] yesterday the other one unfolded today
[1:45:05] and there's one thing that I cannot
[1:45:07] interpret because it's an unknown
[1:45:11] language
[1:45:12] those seven Thunders it's an unknown
[1:45:15] language it's not something that we can
[1:45:18] interpret but it's supernatural it's
[1:45:21] it's it's calling your name right now as
[1:45:24] I'm ministering this word those Thunders
[1:45:27] are actually uttering through the word
[1:45:30] of God it rides the word and it allows
[1:45:33] you to recognize you you're placing your
[1:45:36] calling you're saying Amen to this
[1:45:38] you're putting it all together it's all
[1:45:40] making perfect sense that God had to
[1:45:43] send a prophet God had to correct all of
[1:45:46] the teachings do you know listen go back
[1:45:48] and read the seals do you know that it
[1:45:51] changed Christianity's interpretation on
[1:45:54] the Book of Revelation completely
[1:45:58] that where they thought that that first
[1:46:00] white horse rider was Christ going out
[1:46:02] to conquer the churches it was Satan
[1:46:05] going out to conquer the laity
[1:46:08] and and and then the second horse rider
[1:46:11] the red horse rider then the black horse
[1:46:13] rider and the pale horse rider that
[1:46:15] writer is still writing today
[1:46:18] if it wasn't for God sending a prophet
[1:46:22] to this 20th century in order to bring
[1:46:25] this message and the opening of the word
[1:46:28] to reveal the Mysteries like we just
[1:46:31] read there in Revelation 10 in the days
[1:46:33] of The Voice
[1:46:35] a lot of people they only want to hear
[1:46:37] Brother Branham they're listening and
[1:46:39] hearing brother Branham but they're
[1:46:41] failing to recognize that it is the
[1:46:43] voice of God that came through brother
[1:46:46] Branham that is what is the same
[1:46:49] yesterday today and forever and what
[1:46:52] you're trying to tell me that that voice
[1:46:53] now cannot go into individual sons and
[1:46:56] and Daughters of God and continue this
[1:47:00] calling of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:47:03] this calling of the Sons and Daughters
[1:47:04] of God
[1:47:06] it's doing it
[1:47:08] that's what called you and me
[1:47:12] some of you were in churches before and
[1:47:14] you were brought up in churches and you
[1:47:16] were taught the the the teachings of the
[1:47:19] church and the doctrines and the Creeds
[1:47:20] and the teachings of man and you heard a
[1:47:23] lot about the word of God you heard a
[1:47:24] lot about Jesus Christ but when God gave
[1:47:27] you one revelation of this message
[1:47:31] in the same way that when brother
[1:47:33] Branham said in 1963 that if the angel
[1:47:36] of the Lord had not come into that room
[1:47:39] I would have I would have been teaching
[1:47:42] something wrong to the people but God
[1:47:45] would not allow it because this was the
[1:47:47] time where where truth had to be brought
[1:47:50] in order to call the Sons and Daughters
[1:47:52] of God
[1:47:54] the attributes of God could never accept
[1:47:57] a lie they could never you could you
[1:48:00] just couldn't pinpoint it you'd be going
[1:48:02] to the church but he just just couldn't
[1:48:03] get into it now you were looking forward
[1:48:05] to the party on Friday night you didn't
[1:48:07] care about being a church you were there
[1:48:09] because your mom and dad said you got to
[1:48:10] go to church
[1:48:11] and they won't even go
[1:48:14] but when the spirit of God
[1:48:16] caught you and awakened you
[1:48:19] and this is the time in the season right
[1:48:21] now where we are under the third pull
[1:48:24] Ministry of the word where it's Christ
[1:48:27] himself it's under it's based on the
[1:48:29] opening of that seventh seal that is
[1:48:33] calling Sons and Daughters of God
[1:48:36] into their position so that they can
[1:48:39] take the rapture
[1:48:41] the whole purpose of the opening of
[1:48:44] those seals was to preach
[1:48:48] rapturing Faith so that the bride could
[1:48:52] be taken from this Dimension to go to a
[1:48:55] three and a half year honeymoon
[1:48:58] in a in another dimension and this world
[1:49:01] goes into three and a half years of
[1:49:04] total chaos
[1:49:07] then we come back
[1:49:10] but right now we're looking for that
[1:49:12] last one
[1:49:14] and let me remind you of something
[1:49:18] every single son and daughter of God
[1:49:22] was already known from before the the
[1:49:25] foundations of the world
[1:49:28] so don't you be trying to convince
[1:49:30] somebody
[1:49:32] no nobody had to convince me
[1:49:35] Gabriel would call me every couple of
[1:49:37] weeks three I'll be driving by over
[1:49:39] there I'm going to church tonight you
[1:49:40] want to come no
[1:49:44] all he did
[1:49:45] was
[1:49:47] he pestered me so much that I said okay
[1:49:52] I'm Gonna Come
[1:49:54] and he picked me up at Tim Hortons on
[1:49:56] them on on Mississauga Road in the QEW
[1:49:59] he pulled up in this van and he had he
[1:50:02] had all the United Nations in there
[1:50:06] and I thought what in the world am I
[1:50:09] getting into here
[1:50:11] I thought what is going on here
[1:50:16] and I went with him I got into the car
[1:50:19] and we went to the church
[1:50:21] and all I can tell you is when the word
[1:50:25] spoke
[1:50:27] and don't I cannot tell you I cannot
[1:50:29] explain to you and you will know what
[1:50:31] I'm talking about if you've received
[1:50:33] this
[1:50:34] that when God awakens you
[1:50:37] and you you you just something changes
[1:50:41] inside of you you can't put an
[1:50:43] interpretation on it
[1:50:46] but it was the spirit of God Awakening
[1:50:50] me from my amnesia
[1:50:52] it was God waking us up from our Amnesia
[1:50:56] that when we came to this earth and we
[1:50:58] got locked into these bodies we went
[1:51:00] into a a human Amnesia and and our
[1:51:04] spiritual position or where we came from
[1:51:07] who we really are why we're here on
[1:51:09] Earth it was not known it needed to be
[1:51:12] awakened in US
[1:51:14] and when that happens everything starts
[1:51:18] to change now you're being taught by the
[1:51:21] Holy Spirit In You
[1:51:22] it always was there it was just the time
[1:51:25] in the season for your calling some of
[1:51:28] us had to go through drug addiction some
[1:51:30] of us had to go through uh marital
[1:51:33] situations some of us had to go through
[1:51:35] serious health issues some of us go
[1:51:37] through nothing and then God just
[1:51:38] awakens you it's up to God it's his time
[1:51:41] and it's his season
[1:51:44] but it's a supernatural thing but he
[1:51:46] says here he says but I stand right
[1:51:49] there and looked right straight at it
[1:51:51] and this is the third pull coming he
[1:51:54] knocks on the pulpit three times and the
[1:51:56] Holy Spirit of God oh my that's the
[1:51:58] reason all heaven was silent
[1:52:03] if you look at the seventh seal
[1:52:07] and you read it in Revelations chapter 8
[1:52:09] verse 1
[1:52:13] you will see that the
[1:52:16] lamb
[1:52:20] left
[1:52:22] and there was absolute silence
[1:52:26] that's why he's here now
[1:52:30] that's what we're experiencing now
[1:52:32] that half hour of Silence
[1:52:35] I don't want to make it anything more
[1:52:36] than what it is Christ
[1:52:38] has come down
[1:52:41] Christ has come down
[1:52:43] he is the Capstone
[1:52:45] he has come down
[1:52:48] to reveal and make known unto his own
[1:52:50] who they are why they were here and now
[1:52:53] why we're bringing you home I'm bringing
[1:52:56] you home
[1:52:57] he's here to Quicken you by the word of
[1:53:00] God through the preaching of the word
[1:53:02] to recognize who you are and why you
[1:53:05] have come
[1:53:07] next slide Jesus said as it was in the
[1:53:09] days of Sodom so shall it be in the
[1:53:12] coming of the son of man
[1:53:14] this from the token message and by the
[1:53:16] way the token message brother Bram said
[1:53:18] that that that became his very Pinnacle
[1:53:21] that became like uh the message that the
[1:53:23] Holy Spirit placed upon him and he you
[1:53:26] you look after the after he opened those
[1:53:28] after the Lord opened those Seven Seals
[1:53:30] brother Branham preached on the token
[1:53:32] many many times and he was he was saying
[1:53:35] you need the token you need the token
[1:53:37] what was he talking about he's talking
[1:53:39] about the Holy Ghost the quickening
[1:53:41] power of the word of God that's going to
[1:53:44] take you out of this Dimension because
[1:53:46] he realized now that it was going home
[1:53:48] time
[1:53:49] and he says here the message would not
[1:53:53] be till now the world wasn't in the
[1:53:57] condition until now
[1:54:03] this
[1:54:04] is the hour that Jesus could appear at
[1:54:08] any time
[1:54:10] the sleeping virgin coming in trying to
[1:54:13] buy oil that time when the bride went in
[1:54:16] and the rest of them was left there did
[1:54:19] you ever think what happened
[1:54:21] they were right ahead preaching they
[1:54:24] went right ahead preaching and thinking
[1:54:26] they were getting Soul saved and
[1:54:28] everything and did not know it they knew
[1:54:31] nothing about it the church will go on
[1:54:34] thinking souls are being saved and
[1:54:36] everything else and the church is
[1:54:37] already the brides sealed away
[1:54:41] they don't know it certainly that's
[1:54:43] exactly what the scripture said Noah
[1:54:46] went into the ark and God sealed it out
[1:54:49] truly and the time will come when men
[1:54:53] and women will cry to God and even think
[1:54:55] that they've got something when they
[1:54:58] haven't got anything
[1:55:02] and so this is a sovereign hour Saints
[1:55:05] it really is a sovereign hour
[1:55:08] it's it's it's a time where you know
[1:55:12] to miss what God has done in this day
[1:55:15] and in this hour
[1:55:17] means that anybody outside of Christ not
[1:55:22] outside of this church I'm not saying
[1:55:24] this church I'm not saying anybody
[1:55:26] outside of Christ
[1:55:29] will remain
[1:55:32] here on the Earth for the continuation
[1:55:35] of what is prophesied for this Earth
[1:55:39] and it's not going to be good
[1:55:42] it's not total Annihilation by the way
[1:55:46] but it's going to be pretty close
[1:55:49] to as bad as it can get
[1:55:54] but the only and you know people say oh
[1:55:57] you preach and Escape religion
[1:55:59] you you know you're preaching it to out
[1:56:02] of fear to scare the people I'm not
[1:56:04] preaching anything out of fear
[1:56:08] you need to make your own decisions
[1:56:11] on your own salvation your own future
[1:56:15] your this is not between me and you this
[1:56:19] is between you and God you and the
[1:56:23] source you and Elohim you and whatever
[1:56:26] you want to call it
[1:56:28] but you're going to need at some point
[1:56:30] to recognize that there is an absolute
[1:56:34] next slide
[1:56:36] like he give Egypt
[1:56:39] he give Egypt a place to repent what was
[1:56:42] that last plague was death
[1:56:45] anything outside of the blood of Jesus
[1:56:49] Christ when you reject Christ dying on
[1:56:52] the cross which is the formula
[1:56:56] Christ plus Calvary equals the Holy
[1:57:00] Ghost
[1:57:01] the spirit of God coming back on you to
[1:57:04] reject Christ going to the cross
[1:57:09] eliminates your ability to receive
[1:57:12] the quickening power
[1:57:15] now I'm not saying
[1:57:18] you're going to get it you're not going
[1:57:19] to get it if you're going to get it
[1:57:21] it was already
[1:57:24] in the mind of God because he could look
[1:57:26] down and he he knew that when the word
[1:57:28] was going to come to you you were either
[1:57:30] going to say uh I'm going to take the
[1:57:32] new age teaching that makes more sense
[1:57:35] to me fine and I tell them I say listen
[1:57:39] God bless you I tell him what I have to
[1:57:41] tell them
[1:57:42] and that's it
[1:57:44] after that they need to carry on and
[1:57:47] move on with their own decision and and
[1:57:50] that decision is their responsibility
[1:57:52] I'm not responsible for them
[1:57:54] and neither are you that's why this is
[1:57:57] not about getting out there and and
[1:57:59] slamming the Bible and slamming the
[1:58:01] messages in front of the people and
[1:58:03] condemning the people and saying you're
[1:58:05] living like a devil and this and that
[1:58:07] nah nah that's not what it is
[1:58:09] get them to Christ
[1:58:11] get them to this message they need to
[1:58:13] hear what God has done and what God is
[1:58:16] doing in this hour in order for them to
[1:58:18] trans to be translated into that other
[1:58:20] dimension and so the last plague that
[1:58:23] hit the Pentecostal Church its spiritual
[1:58:25] death and the last plague that now is
[1:58:28] hitting this world is spiritual death
[1:58:31] outside of Jesus Christ it's just as
[1:58:34] simple as that and to reject Christ is
[1:58:38] death
[1:58:40] and all death is is separation from God
[1:58:44] and so you do not go to a glorious
[1:58:47] Victory you go to
[1:58:50] whatever it is that God
[1:58:52] has for the world in the tribulation and
[1:58:56] the dimensions Beyond this
[1:58:58] and he says it's spiritual death she's
[1:59:01] dead
[1:59:02] that's in the name of the Lord she's
[1:59:04] spiritually dead he gave her place to
[1:59:06] repent and she rejected it now she's
[1:59:09] dead she'll never rise again
[1:59:13] and so as we wind down here
[1:59:16] the next slide
[1:59:18] Saints
[1:59:20] this is the greatest message that the
[1:59:22] world has ever received
[1:59:24] and it's taking place right now
[1:59:28] I want to I want to just highlight some
[1:59:30] of these things the Lord just I wrote
[1:59:31] these things the opening of the seventh
[1:59:34] seal is the literal coming of the Lord
[1:59:37] and that is why there is silence in
[1:59:40] heaven right now
[1:59:43] these are just straight facts right out
[1:59:45] of the word of God there's a lot of
[1:59:47] Christian teaching out there I challenge
[1:59:49] them to go and read the Seven Seals by
[1:59:53] William Miriam Branham and and and and
[1:59:56] take your Bible and put it together and
[1:59:59] see if there's something that isn't
[2:00:01] supernaturally revealed to you he came
[2:00:05] to call you personally
[2:00:07] brother Branham did not open the seals
[2:00:10] it was the mighty Angel himself that
[2:00:13] opened the seals
[2:00:17] we hear his voice we hear the voice of
[2:00:20] God you're not listen whatever struck
[2:00:23] your soul this morning it's not Danny's
[2:00:25] Voice
[2:00:27] if something struck you and opened your
[2:00:29] understanding or or quickened something
[2:00:31] to you that's opened your eyes of
[2:00:33] understanding is because he spoke to you
[2:00:36] he opened the understanding in your
[2:00:39] heart
[2:00:40] the lamb had the book in his hand and it
[2:00:43] was the only and he was the only one who
[2:00:46] could open the seals so it wasn't a man
[2:00:49] that opened the seals
[2:00:51] he was the bleeding bloody lamb
[2:00:53] everything was done from before the
[2:00:54] foundations of the world and when he
[2:00:56] opened that book and he opened those
[2:00:58] seals it was to reveal your name
[2:01:02] it was to call you out of this
[2:01:04] dispensation right now the Lamb's Book
[2:01:07] of Life has your name in it once you
[2:01:09] hear your name called you can never be
[2:01:12] the same and you can never be lost
[2:01:15] Hallelujah
[2:01:17] glory to God Amen
[2:01:19] we bypass the Great Tribulation
[2:01:23] next slide brother Branham will the
[2:01:26] bride go through the persecution as the
[2:01:28] early Apostolic Church did no I just
[2:01:31] explained that a few minutes ago no next
[2:01:34] thing is the rapture remember we're at
[2:01:38] the promised land we're at the border
[2:01:42] next one you say the church has to go
[2:01:44] through the persecution for the
[2:01:46] Perfection of it the blood of Jesus
[2:01:49] Christ perfects you
[2:01:51] the five-fold ministry the purpose of
[2:01:53] Ephesians chapter 4 is for the
[2:01:56] perfecting of the church
[2:01:58] we are in a perfecting stage right now
[2:02:01] through the third pull
[2:02:03] by the supernatural element of the
[2:02:06] mighty Angel himself
[2:02:08] let's go on a man who chooses a wife
[2:02:11] don't put her through a lot of
[2:02:12] punishment he's already found Grace
[2:02:15] to with her she has found Grace with him
[2:02:18] he engages her and if there's anything
[2:02:21] he'll keep her from every place to turn
[2:02:23] her hand his grace is so great upon them
[2:02:26] that's what God did for you
[2:02:28] it's because he loves you next slide
[2:02:32] it is the rising of the sun and the sun
[2:02:34] has got to be revealed again in the
[2:02:37] bride in the last day the quickening
[2:02:39] power this is what we need this is what
[2:02:42] was that's why repent be baptized in the
[2:02:45] name of the Lord Jesus Christ you shall
[2:02:47] receive the gift of the quickening power
[2:02:50] Hallelujah the quickening power has got
[2:02:53] to come Quicken them out of these dead
[2:02:55] denominations and Creeds to a Living
[2:02:57] Word of a living God
[2:03:00] to rise in the sun look what we've seen
[2:03:02] in this day the quickening power has
[2:03:04] come to us to open the Seven Seals what
[2:03:07] was that the intelligence of a man no
[2:03:10] the quickening power of God see the
[2:03:13] quickening power of God foretold this
[2:03:15] would take place the quickening power of
[2:03:17] God made the worlds testify to it it's
[2:03:20] the truth
[2:03:21] the angel of the Lord I told you was
[2:03:24] around in a pillar of fire quickening
[2:03:26] power let the world testify that it's
[2:03:28] the truth and in that they didn't know
[2:03:31] what it was and we knew just look this
[2:03:34] way and it's our Lord up there you see
[2:03:38] he is the one who opened those seals
[2:03:41] he's those seals for the whole word of
[2:03:44] God is Christ and Christ is the seals
[2:03:47] that was opened what is the opening of
[2:03:49] the seals then revealing Christ
[2:03:52] and every and and the Very seven angels
[2:03:55] which represented the seven churches all
[2:03:58] completed and we couldn't even see it
[2:04:01] they did they took the picture not us
[2:04:04] and there he is standing there Supreme
[2:04:06] judge showing that he is Alpha and Omega
[2:04:10] the beginning and the end what
[2:04:11] identification quickening power did that
[2:04:15] to us
[2:04:16] it's going to take the quickening power
[2:04:18] to put us in the Rapture amen
[2:04:22] God hiding himself in Simplicity and
[2:04:24] we're gonna close out here right now
[2:04:26] just another couple minutes see
[2:04:29] that's the way we want the Bible just
[2:04:32] the way the Bible says it that's the way
[2:04:34] we want it just like that don't put your
[2:04:37] own no interpretation to it it's already
[2:04:40] interpreted now who has no you got to go
[2:04:43] back
[2:04:44] and listen to the seals and brother
[2:04:46] Branham opened up the services on God
[2:04:49] hiding himself in simplicity
[2:04:51] and revealing himself in the same
[2:04:53] God was going to be doing a mighty
[2:04:56] mighty thing
[2:04:58] right there in 1963 in the opening of
[2:05:01] these Seven Seals and look and look at
[2:05:03] the scripture that he takes now who has
[2:05:05] believed our report and to whom is the
[2:05:08] arm of the Lord revealed let me read it
[2:05:11] again now closely who has believed our
[2:05:14] report question
[2:05:16] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[2:05:19] revealed in other words if you have
[2:05:21] believed our report then the arm of the
[2:05:23] Lord has been revealed
[2:05:25] if you can accept this message if you
[2:05:29] can accept that God sent a prophet that
[2:05:32] God has turned the hearts of the
[2:05:34] children back to the faith of the
[2:05:36] fathers it's because God has extended
[2:05:39] his grace to you God has given you the
[2:05:43] ability to recognize his word for your
[2:05:46] day and to be included in this in this
[2:05:49] wonderful glorious message that he's
[2:05:52] given to us in other words you have
[2:05:55] believed our report then the arm of the
[2:05:56] Lords now I want to read also in the
[2:05:58] book of Saint Matthew gospel the 11th
[2:06:01] chapter of Saint Matthew and now you
[2:06:03] bring your papers and things because
[2:06:05] constantly if you don't have a recorder
[2:06:08] you you bring your paper so you can get
[2:06:10] it he's white like he's letting them
[2:06:13] know like hey something's Great Is
[2:06:15] Happening Here
[2:06:16] he says now he says uh um uh the 11th
[2:06:21] chapter of Saint Matthew the 25th and
[2:06:24] 26th verses 11 26 and 12. I'll write
[2:06:26] Jesus speaking in prayer I want to begin
[2:06:29] a little bit behind that let's make it
[2:06:31] 25th and 26th verse I believe that's
[2:06:34] where I announced though for I had it
[2:06:36] marked here in my Bible at that time
[2:06:39] Jesus answered and said I thank the old
[2:06:41] father Lord of Heaven and Earth because
[2:06:44] thou has hid these things from the wise
[2:06:47] and The Prudent and has revealed them
[2:06:49] unto babes even so father for it seems
[2:06:53] good in thy sight catch those two
[2:06:56] scriptures who has believed our report
[2:06:59] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[2:07:01] revealed even then Jesus thanked God
[2:07:05] that he hid the Mysteries
[2:07:07] that were under those seals he hid them
[2:07:11] from the wise and the Jesus came to the
[2:07:13] earth and the Pharisees the Sadducees
[2:07:16] nobody could recognize that it was
[2:07:18] Messiah
[2:07:19] it was hit they were blinded for our
[2:07:22] sake
[2:07:23] and now this world is going into
[2:07:25] blindness to the Gentiles for the sake
[2:07:29] of the hundred and forty four thousand
[2:07:31] that God is going to call out of the
[2:07:33] Jewish Nation
[2:07:36] there's just so much Hallelujah
[2:07:39] he hid it from the wise and The Prudent
[2:07:41] would reveal it to babes such as would
[2:07:43] learn for it seemed good to do that
[2:07:46] Look Away to Jesus and if Christ lives
[2:07:49] in me the works of Christ you'll do it's
[2:07:52] got to be and what is it what is Christ
[2:07:55] the word he said if ye abide in me and
[2:07:58] my word in you then ask what you will
[2:08:00] it'll be done because the word is there
[2:08:03] just needs the light and the light makes
[2:08:05] it live so now I am going to say
[2:08:08] something to you now that I haven't said
[2:08:10] all along and that is the thing that we
[2:08:13] have looked forward to for so long for
[2:08:15] so many years four or five years or
[2:08:18] maybe longer the third pull has now been
[2:08:22] Vindicated and I'm sure you all know
[2:08:25] what it is now remember there'll never
[2:08:27] be an impersonation of that
[2:08:30] this is not something that we can
[2:08:32] impersonate your Christian walk you
[2:08:35] cannot impersonate it
[2:08:37] you'll you'll be exposed like that
[2:08:40] this is the hour where Christ comes in
[2:08:44] and dwells in you and experiences
[2:08:46] through you and lives through you right
[2:08:49] at this time now it just happened so it
[2:08:52] could identify its presence among you
[2:08:54] see but it will not be used in a great
[2:08:57] way until this Council begins to tighten
[2:08:59] up and when it does when that does the
[2:09:01] Pentecostals and so forth can almost
[2:09:03] impersonate anything can be done but
[2:09:06] when that time comes when the squeeze
[2:09:08] comes down then you'll see what you've
[2:09:11] seen temporarily be manifested in the
[2:09:13] fullness of its power Saints we are we
[2:09:16] are progressing into the squeeze in a in
[2:09:19] a different format where this world and
[2:09:22] the Council of churches and and there's
[2:09:24] going to be a deal that's going to come
[2:09:25] together with the Pope and with the with
[2:09:28] the with the Catholic church and and
[2:09:30] Wall Street and there's going to be
[2:09:32] things that are going to happen we're
[2:09:33] now moving into those things as we speak
[2:09:37] and Saints this is our time
[2:09:41] we have no message of Our Own
[2:09:43] we need to share that the Lord is
[2:09:46] revealed what the Lord is revealing to
[2:09:47] us today and the spirit of the Lord will
[2:09:50] reveal it to his own
[2:09:52] stay with the message that God has given
[2:09:54] you
[2:09:55] tell them of the seven Church ages and
[2:09:57] the Seven Seals tell them that God sent
[2:10:00] a prophet remember the Lord gives
[2:10:02] Revelation to awaken individuals you
[2:10:05] don't give revelation
[2:10:07] and in conclusion
[2:10:11] brother Branham left and I I just these
[2:10:14] things just came to me
[2:10:16] this week and I just I you know I was
[2:10:18] talking to Sister Jen and we were there
[2:10:19] you know because we just sit at the
[2:10:22] beach under a nice Cabana and we would
[2:10:24] just Ponder and you know I would say so
[2:10:27] you know I said brother Branham left in
[2:10:29] 1965. the Azusa Street Revival started
[2:10:32] in 1906 and we look at when brother
[2:10:35] Branham left the earth and the mighty
[2:10:37] Angel Ministry started into its fullness
[2:10:39] we have 59 years and if we add 59 years
[2:10:43] to 1965 when the prophet left we end up
[2:10:47] in around 2024. if Elijah Ministry
[2:10:50] Elijah
[2:10:52] and then the Elijah Ministry Came Upon
[2:10:55] Us to ride this Trail again thou must
[2:10:58] prophesy again this is Revelations 10 8
[2:11:01] verses uh 10 verses 8 to 11 10 7 8 to
[2:11:06] 11.
[2:11:09] that we've got a Ministry
[2:11:11] and something is going to culminate at
[2:11:13] some point and when we look at the
[2:11:15] church ages we see that the last Church
[2:11:17] age the laodicean church age started in
[2:11:19] 1906 and it's supposed to be the
[2:11:22] shortest Church age when we add the
[2:11:24] shortest Church age the Ephesian Church
[2:11:26] age which lasted 117 years to 1906
[2:11:30] we're right around 2023.
[2:11:32] I'm not putting a time or anything
[2:11:34] listen no man knows the time that's the
[2:11:37] beauty of what's going on here
[2:11:39] but how close are we Saints
[2:11:41] let the musicians come
[2:11:46] what a Time
[2:11:48] what a Time thank you I'm sorry I went a
[2:11:50] little over
[2:11:52] but I wanted to get this all done
[2:11:54] [Applause]
[2:12:03] there's something in you
[2:12:07] there's a pull
[2:12:09] inside of you
[2:12:11] see that's why brother Branham when the
[2:12:13] angel of the Lord told him how to fish
[2:12:16] he told them don't pull too hard on that
[2:12:20] third pull be careful
[2:12:22] you got to be wise you got to wait
[2:12:24] because we're looking for the rainbow
[2:12:25] trout we're looking for those that are
[2:12:27] that are the sons and daughters of God
[2:12:29] they're not going to be caught by the
[2:12:33] Small Things sure we got healings sure
[2:12:35] we've got prayer lines sure we've got
[2:12:37] Supernatural uh healings going on and so
[2:12:40] forth but the greater than all of that
[2:12:43] is when you can accept the word for your
[2:12:45] day which gives you the quickening power
[2:12:47] to be translated out of this Dimension
[2:12:50] into that Redemption uh Dimension the
[2:12:54] the red the the dimension of the
[2:12:56] redeemed that's what we're looking for
[2:12:59] and so we need to recognize that this
[2:13:03] message that we've got it attracts the
[2:13:05] attention of the rainbow trout
[2:13:08] that's what we've got here and we need
[2:13:10] to share it
[2:13:11] we need to understand what we need
[2:13:13] that's why the bride when brother Brown
[2:13:16] says she'll know what to do with the
[2:13:18] word
[2:13:20] sounds like a big statement
[2:13:22] she's going to speak this and speak that
[2:13:24] no
[2:13:26] God hiding himself
[2:13:29] in you and me
[2:13:31] in simplicity
[2:13:33] let us pray father
[2:13:36] we thank you for the word this morning
