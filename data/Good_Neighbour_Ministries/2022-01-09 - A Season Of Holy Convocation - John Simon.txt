because of covered concerns within the society may the lord bless us as we come together under these conditions and may the lord send forth his word his light his truth to feed our souls to rejoice our hearts to stimulate oh praise god our entire being that we may walk in the light of the day the light of his word may god bless us together this morning we want to look at the the topic of season of holy convocation season of holy convocation and our scripture is found in the book of leviticus chapter 23 reading from verse 39 and also in the 15th day of the seventh month when ye were gathered in have gathered in the fruit of the land you shall keep a feast unto the lord seven days on the first day shall be a sabbath and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath and ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees branches of palm trees and the boughs of sick trees and the willows of the brook and you shall rejoice before the lord your god seven days and you shall keep a feast unto the lord seven days in the year in the year ye shall be it shall be a statute forever in your generations you shall celebrate it in the seventh month you shall dwell in boots seven days all that are israelites born shall dwell in boots that your generations may know that i made the children of israel to dwell in boots when i brought them out of the land of egypt i am the lord thy god and moses declared unto the children of israel the feasts of the lord hallelujah amen now my friends i want to point out to you that this wonderful nation of israel had three feasts fall feasts that they keep for the lord in the month of tishrei which is september to those of us that go according to the english calendar september 1st was and still is feast of the trumpets september 10th the feast of the day of atonement and september 15th was the feast of tabernacles or feast of boots as it may be called or it's also called time of him gathering time oven gathering and god caused them to live in boots uh the word sukkahs has been used so that they may be reminded that they are pilgrims and strangers in the land oh praise the name of our god forevermore we give him all the glory and praise hallelujah strangers in the land now this marvelous time of the feasts of boots seven days which represents the seven church ages and i will pass over this briefly because uh next sunday i will come to this subject from another point of view to point out and expand on those matters but here we are looking at israel having this feast for seven days and on the eighth day the eighth day there were to come in the presence of god the seven days being a type of the seven church ages and the eighth day a type of holy convocation eighth day a type or sign of another eternal day we realize that adam and eve lived in an eternal day and time for a season and they fell out of it into the frame that we call time they fell from eternity into time and so the apostles also on the day of pentecost they had the marvelous opportunity of breaking entering in to this eighth day experience uh and to live in what i call the eternal day or a day which is really the first day similar to the first day right there they were as a journalist in the land god wanted israel to know no matter how prosperous you become no matter how many great buildings you have put up be ready to leave at any time because you are only pilgrim and strangers here and so are the true believers to recognize and understand no matter how prosperous we may become no matter what foundations we have upon this earth we must always be ready to answer our master's call or praise god whether to work on the earth here before he comes or to answer his call when he comes but we must always be vigilant watchful and ready for his marvelous wonderful coming hallelujah now adam and eve they lived on an eternal day the apostles lived in an eternal day for a season until they broke out of the word the pure word of god now it's our time it's our turn as a people to live in the great word of god in this eternal day or time season of holy convocation for the eternal day the eighth day is a time of holy convocation and this takes place after the church ages are over after the fullness of time hallelujah then comes the eighth day i want you to listen to this as brother branham speaks future home of the heavenly bride and the earthly bride bridegroom an earthly bride now in ephesians 1 10 it's called not the seventh day it's called the fullness of time and when the fullness of time was has come that's when time has been fulfilled when there is no more time then you go into eternity after the seventh church age is over you go into eternity and luther's age is over methodist age is over and now you go into what you go into eternity where there are no more sevens hallelujah no more of that you are now in eternity where you do not have numbers and times and things to deal with amen praise god hallelujah now i want you to understand this what is brother branham speaking about he he's not telling us that physically when the seven church ages are over that we just walk into eternity but he is speaking to the elect he's speaking to the members of the lord's bride that are within the message within the church within the flock there within it and so he is saying in your soul that eternal part of your being your gene that is in you oh praise god after the seven church ages are over spiritually after you have come true in your experience the seven church ages by revelation by understanding you enter back into eternity again where you come from you came from god you're going back to god you came from his presence you go back to his presence blessed be the name of the living god oh praise god oh my how wonderful it is to know that after the church ages are over after the fullness of time is over you know what the bible tells us revelation 10 1 to 7 how the great mighty angel came down from the heavens with a rainbow around his head roaring a mighty voice like when a lion roar seven thunders uttering their voices and as the mighty angel all one foot on the land and one foot on the sea with his hands raised to heaven and in the other hand an open book hallelujah and says time shall be no more oh so you may understand he was saying an announcing that with the ministry of the seventh angel of revelation 10 7 the church ages are over the church ages are complete they are finished and now that the portal is ready now you are ready to uh to enter in to that feast that holy convocation that holy eight-day convocation this season of the supernatural entry into the presence of almighty god where god is able to feast along with his people glory be to his holy and wonderful name for this marvelous entrance that we have into his divine presence now many have preached and many have taught about this subject or on this subject of the holy convocation god bless their hearts they spoke it preached it and taught it according to their understanding and that is what i am doing here today preaching it according to my understanding from the word of god as given to me so here we are brother sister once again hearing of this topic which you might have heard about it before because in the day in which we live everywhere we are hearing about holy convocations and churches are having holy convocations denominations are having holy convocations and so i want to show you that we are now living in the actual season of god's holy convocation and that we are living not in the seventh church age physically we are still in that but spiritually you have if you have caught the revelation then you have entered in to the holy convocation god's holy convocation hallelujah for the eight day feast the holy convocation is the feast after the seventh day feast oh praise god you go to the new testament you'll remember that jesus came towards the end of the last day of the feast and lifted up his voice oh praise god hallelujah amen and everywhere we can see various denominations are organizing convocations great conventions and they're calling them holy convocations but i'm not speaking about those church denominational church convocations or conventions whatsoever i am speaking about god's great holy convocation you say well brother simon what is a convocation what really is a convocation and you will find that the word convocate means together to assemble or to congregate or to meet convocate when we say convocation we're speaking of a a great gathering of people a great meeting you're having a great meeting or you you may use the word or thought a great assembly see a great assembly oh and in particular in particular when the word convocation is used it's used in terms of congregation's great assembly of clergy of of men and of god coming together to talk about the things of the church the things that the word uh in those in that way and so when we use convocate it's the leadership of the church uh coming together various delegates i'm speaking naturally here come together and they're speaking on the affairs of the church of god but not only that convocate speaks of the formal assembly of a college or university especially at the time of graduation and i have attended some of those uh when there is a great convocation come together to celebrate the time of graduation when these students are finally come through their years of study years of preparation years of training and when they have come to that place where they can be recognized as certified sons daughters and students of that college then they're brought and displayed before all and they are given their graduation diplomas there in the presence of admiring friends oh my yes sir so that is mainly what convocate means now i can remember when i was a boy just at school uh in my memory i think of this how we would have in those days they rang a bell they rang a bell to let you know it's time for classes to start it's lunch time we are let out and then they would ring a bell for us to return back to our classes when the classes were over they'd ring another bell but when a very important person like the queen the president or the principal someone of great reputation note someone having something important to say then they rang the bell but that bill had a different tone to it a different sound to it and you knew by the ringing of that bell that this was not an ordinary meeting this was not an ordinary assembly this was a convocation for a get-together for the entire school to be present for this because this person is fixing to speak and we would all make sure that we are there in time for it praise god but this convocation of which i am speaking jesus christ himself is the speaker or the convocator of this meeting hallelujah he is the convocator convocator the one who calls for the convocation and our great shepherd is now calling his sheep calling them by the opening of the seventh seal and the calling for sounding forth of their names within the word of god as it's being revealed to them to recognize themselves in god's word of this hour and of this time hallelujah amen yes sir oh praise god hallelujah i'm so glad our great shepherd is calling all his sheep and is calling them by name for he knows his sheep and his sheep knows his voice and they know how to answer praise god and they answer his call glory be to god hallelujah he's calling his sheep calling them together summoning them together into his divine presence glory be to god forevermore oh my oh praise god i bless his holy name i'm thinking of up here in northern canada we have a lot of ducks and they have their season for the laying of their eggs and the hatching of the eggs and those eggs would hatch and out of them will come the ducks various young ducks and amongst them will be a young drake a wonderful uh leader for the flock for when they're going to head south or praise god to escape from the blistering cold winds and ice on formality of winter they're escaping to the south and a young leader would arise just born he's never been south he doesn't know the way how to get there oh praise god but then as time a season comes around something within him causes him to begin to crawl out he begins to cry out and call the other ducks all around him i believe god used our precious brother william branham for that purpose to begin to call together his people amen in the last stages of his ministry or praise god when he moved out of the office of just being seventh angel to become the fullness of the voice of the mighty angel of revelation 10 1 and there oh praise god inviting god's bride god's children to go into this time of holy convocation oh glory to god and he would assemble them bring them together hallelujah and they will come together amen i want you to see what drew them together what caused him to be able to crawl out together what caused them to all want to go south or praise god because naturally they have an instinct in them something called instinct and when the time comes they'll all fly up and when they fly up they don't even know their way but led by the instinct that is within them it'll take that young duck and those other ducks they'll fly straight down to the south and they'll find no doubt the swamp or the pond where their parents were feeding in the year before and they'll go back right there maybe even find the old nest and they will go right back there all my friends praise be to god that the same holy spirit is right here with us that was with all the patriarchs all the prophets all the apostles all the saints of all the ages oh blessed be to god the name of the lord hallelujah and the same holy spirit all by a supernatural instinct and inspiration hallelujah begins to lead us back to heaven so that we may take a rapture never went there before never flew into the presence of god like that before but he will lead us and guide us right there into the presence of god but we must convocate come to a meeting of minds meeting of hearts a convocation of divine revelation convocation with a watchman on the walls of zion see eye to eye oh praise god because they have caught the revelation of the last prophet's message they caught the revelation of the fullness of the word of god and it doesn't matter if they never met before they never heard the other one before they never seen each other the other before or like paul and barnabas and peter all praise god when they come together they still find themselves saying the very same thing maybe himself in different ways but saying the same thing because there's only one god and there's only one divine revelation of himself so no matter where we are who we are and we look at the whole plan of god we can only see one god one revelation one jesus christ oh praise his marvelous and wonderful name amen praise god forever so here we are by holy ghost instinct brought together by the grace of almighty god amen as us the prophet has said magnetized we are drawn together by a magnetic pull of the holy spirit the third pull the great holy spirit of almighty god i know to some i sound as if i'm speaking in other towns and cannot be fully understood but to those whom god has given eyes to see ears to hear god it's clear pure to their hearts and their rejoicing night and day as they walk this narrow way for the hand of god upon their lives they see or praise his marvelous name and if you can't see if you can't understand right now you lack wisdom the bible says ask of god who giveth liberally to all that will ask him and he will deny you not but ask the lord god open my eyes that i might see glimpses of truth oh god from thee open the eyes of my heart lord i want to know and see what it is that these brethren are seeing what they have caught onto what is being made known to them oh blessed be and my friends if you come humbly if you come with open heart if you come repentant god will reveal himself unto you and you know god puts filters barriers and things that unless you are his genuine seed it'd be hard for you to get past those filters he'll put filters like uh making the man uh save things that might not be sound accurate he'll make him act sometimes crude he'll make a profit where camel's skin is not dressed right he's maybe he don't talk right maybe he doesn't have the proper grammar maybe he's uneducated like peter or maybe you know he's like john they come out never oh god have mercy just to create a filter and if you can only get past that filter oh and get beyond the veil and be able to see and to recognize the presence of the living god you'll go through such a life change such a change a transformation by the presence of the holy ghost amen praise god magnetized by the holy ghost oh my you feel magnetized an unseen power has come on the scene and taken a hold of your soul where you are no more your own but you do recognize not by reading just the scripture not by just understanding the scripture but you know within your heart amen that you redeemed you really have been redeemed by the blood of the lamb hallelujah amen yes sir magnetized by the holy ghost that unseen influence amen or praise god uh the story's been told of one who went to a factory where instead of having folks sweeping the floor at the end of the day in this machining factory they would come down with a large magnet and that large magnet will magnetize the little bits and pieces oh my that are on the floor on the ground anywhere and they'll all be drawn up to that great magnet by that invisible power of magnetization i want to tell you we have a magnet the magnet of the holy ghost unseen influence of the living god the same power of god that the power that drew those pieces of metal together to the great magnet in the sky above them that same or invisible power of the living god you are magnetized the genes of god are magnetized by the holy spirit amen they're drawn by the holy spirit they can't escape it because they're they're one and the same they're made of the same metal they're made up the same way and they're drawn together by the unseen power of the living god hallelujah the great magnet who said in john chapter 12 verse 32 and i if i be lifted up i will draw all men unto myself o blessed be the name of the lord jesus is saying if i be lifted up if i when i'm resurrected i'll be able i'll draw i'll magnetize all men unto myself oh hallelujah glory to god i'm so happy that the holy spirit is here the unseen pattern presence of the living god is here to draw and to magnetize those that are his own back to himself by the third full power of his divine presence amen praise god hallelujah we are lifted up he said i'll draw men unto myself draw them into a convocation draw them into a holy union a great assemblage of saints drawn together not by advertisements not by tv ads not by various programs on the tv or radio not by any human earthly invitation not by any human efforts whatsoever but the we hear the call of the great shepherd calling his sheep calling them by name and calling them back to his divine presence luke 17 amen the son of man we are in the season when the son of man is now being revealed again not as the headship one man in jesus christ but she being a part of him this is her iron time hallelujah of her manifestation and revelation of that great that bride of his that is now going back to his side glory to god hallelujah and there my friends he brings her together in a marvelous holy convocation drawn together by the pull of the word of god hallelujah amen you're not drawn together by the noise of man they're not drawn together by any kind of uh man-made efforts you know man makes pups and there's been a lot of flooding out west in british columbia there's been a lot of flooding down in the south and many sick towns water water everywhere and flooding everywhere and pups are working 24 7 to pump the waters out that people may have a living environment but the noise the pumps are making 24 7. they're making a lot of noise oh and they're boasting of how many thousands of gallons that they're able to pump out and to clear out of there but oh i trust god we trust the power of god we trust the presence of god because the sun only has to come out and the sun will draw up more thousands of gallons of water than those water pumps ever could and the sun will do it without noise without sound imperceptibility you may not be able to discern it but you just see the sun is drawing the water back up where it came from and so the same sun but s.o.n is drawing his children back up where they come from by his divine presence and power we are being drawn back into the presence of god hallelujah not all these bells and whistles and programs and uh and and services where they believe they need to pump the people up into a a religious ecstasy of a belief no but with the quiet faith quiet expectation quiet revelation of the holy spirit in the soul of man who truly believes and sees what god is saying from his word oh hallelujah my god hallelujah yes sir so i'm happy today to tell you that we are invited to come into this a wonderful holy convocation of the lord being drawn upwards right through the portals of glory amen the portal of revelation the doorway are the gates to glory opens up when the word opens up i am the door when he opens up he the word when he opens up himself and makes himself known when the author of the book himself begins to speak inspire and declare to you who he is what he is what he has done what is fixing to do oh praise god now you have a first hand revelation from the presence of god and you can rest on that and rely on that for the glory of god amen praise god hallelujah or thank god that there's a poll going on right now and as the songwriter said they come from the east and west they come from the lands of far to feast with the king to dine as his guests how blessed these pilgrims are beholding his hallowed face a glow with light divine blessed partakers of his grace as gems in his crown to shine jesus is coming soon o hallelujah amen drawn by the holy spirit into a holy convocation of revelation where we see eye to eye by the holy spirit of the living god amen i ask you today what is the attraction on the mountain what is the attraction what was the attraction then matthew chapter 21 verses 1 to 11 what was the attraction on the mountain what was it king god king jesus king word was riding a donkey into genuine to them by the grace of god how marvelous how wonderful how simply the word of god seeks to write into our hearts how wonderfully he seeks our king seeks to come within our lives if we will permit him we don't want to say a master quiet down your disciples because they're keeping so much noise they're shouting your name they're they're calling your name there they're strewing the way with palm branches oh my but we have to destroy his way we have to use pam branches for his glory and honor we have to give him praise we have to give him honor for all the great things he has done because that displays to them his great victory over satan our redemption our salvation our manifestation of himself displays the very victory that he has had and is having over satan in this day and in this time blessed be the name of the living god oh praise god hallelujah amen oh it's a wonderful time for you and a wonderful time for me to be a part of this great season of holy convocation not by the will of man not by the invitation of man not by programs of man not by the efforts of man trying to pump up something but quietly humbly sincerely reverently the holy spirit in this hour is making himself known to the lord's despised view or praises name and while that is happening those that are on the outside and satan on the outside trying to peer in peep in or to get in in his own manner trying to climb into this holy convocation and i want to say he may try to use the window of education and of human wisdom oh he may try to use that to come and enter in by that window into the great wedding feast this great convocation by education all religious and secular may want to come in by theology wants to come in my friends by his various degrees but you're not allowed in god will only open the eyes of those who he wants to open those whom he choose he will show mercy unto whom he chooses to show mercy or praise god forevermore some try to enter in by the window of religious excitement and religious demonstrations and healings oh they feel they can shout it down they can dance it down they can sing it down they they can do whatever they believe that that creating an atmosphere to break in to the dimensions of god and of the supernatural realm of god and my friends but i'm here to say that is not the way you might have come that way during the seventh church age but the seventh church age is over and gone spiritually experientially those who recognize what has happened what is happening oh praise god we enter in by the revelation opening of the doorway or portal of the word of god to see the unseen to come to a perfect realization a complete recognition of the great circle of eternity and of eternal things for his glory and honor oh some believe that god can be bribed said peter can be bribed that they can enter in by their wealth that they can pull it over god's eyes and their culture they'll be able to slip through or climb in to the window by culture some believe that by having a wonderful service of filled with dignity and culture oh and respectability there may be able to enter in to this convocation but this holy convocation that i am speaking of none can enter there unless they have been invited by the convocator jesus christ himself has to invite you amen oh blessed are your eyes praise god because you've been given eyes to see if you're elected you've been given ears to hear if you were elected but unto them it is not given it is given unto you and you ought to praise god and take god that is open your eyes of your own heart praise god others try to slip in or climb through the window of good works they believe that they may be able to get in without the wedding garment they believe they can climb in by being a good person oh i lived a good life i never hurt anyone i never swore at anyone and ever cursed anyone i never did any evil to anyone uh i i i support many charities i i do this for the church i do that whatever it is none can enter there none can climb in to this convocation natural convocations you're not allowed in without having your token ticket or pass because of the things that will be discussed even in the natural convocations when it comes to this supernatural convocation the holy convocation of the spirit of almighty god none can enter there except those who have been invited by him the great holy spirit no matter what good works you have you try to enter in without having on the wedding garment you're not robbed by the holy spirit you don't wear the holy spirit on you as a robe he hasn't covered you under his wings and brought you under his severity and preeminence oh praise god hallelujah amen oh my my friends what a wonderful time to know the true believer to rejoice and know they're brought in to a holy convocation by the holy spirit himself oh but yet there are many convocations going on everywhere everybody has a convocation and what are you talking about about a holy convocation we heard about it so many times but let me tell your friends back in the old testament there was a man named ahab a king and his wife jezebel and they had a convocation too first kings 18 and the motivation for that convention or convocation was to eradicate the name of jehovah from within the land of israel you want to get rid of the name of jehovah and as we are here today i want you to know they want to get rid of us talking about the name of jesus christ i was invited the very prestigious uh prayer breakfast where ministers of different faiths would say a few words will be a little prayer prayer and when it was made clear to me by those who would organize this when you pray don't call any name just use the generic term god well god just means object of worship which god so don't mention the name of jesus just pray you're supposed to pray in a lofty dignified religious way but don't mention the name of jesus just say god and i absolutely refused and rejected it this great meeting of all the high in the mighty uh so-called my friends i turned it down and walked away from it because at the name of jesus every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that jesus christ is lord amen i know some would have been tempted and give in to that just for the exposure and the recognition to be in such an august crowd but no we are not called to cut corners we are called to stand for jesus and he will stand for you when you stand by the word of the living god there were absolutely having this convention this convocation for the purpose of eradicating the name of jehovah within the land of israel they were anti-jehovah and they wanted to get rid and cleanse the land of the teachings and prophecies of this so-called elijah that that cursed old harlot jezebel and her daughters brought the saint the lord god of israel against them and spoke the word amen and she haunted him to get a hold of his life oh as as such oh but they called because they wanted to immerse the people into this kind of anti-elijah anti-present-day william branham who was god's and his gods elijah for this age for god's glory and honor the one who called conventions and convocations to be raped to to come against his name his message the voice of god who spoke through him to be anti-elijah an anti-word anti-his doctrine and teaching is nothing less than the word of god and thus saith the lord hallelujah oh my yes they were against elijah's prophecies and for this convention was not going to be an ordinary one for this convention she brought their 450 prophets of baal well-trained men schooled in all manner of doctrine and teachings of their false god trinitarian god and along with those 450 were 400 prophets of the groves and they're at from jezebel's table and they came to this great convention this great convocation and the motivation to repeat was all was motivated to the destruction of elijah and his message but thank god elijah met them up in chicago elijah in the bible met them on mount carmel and you can read in your bible first kings 18 how they jumped their carry on a petty crosstalk meeting like you've never seen jumping around and dancing and screaming and calling and in the bible said they even cut themselves some of them have oil and blood coming out of them trying to bring the genuine god on the scene or my friends and when it came towards evening hallelujah at the time of the evening sacrifice elijah got them to put all the bullock and the wood on the altar playset he plays it praise god and then he turn and tell him look you can pour cold water you can criticize you can say whatever you want uh my job is done you can even get rid of the messenger but you will never get rid of this message of the spoken word of malachi 4 5 revelation 10 1-7 luke 70. you cannot get rid of it because it's the word of god it will not die but it will live on and on and his word shall not return unto him void for it's thus saith the lord god hallelujah of hosts amen praise god yes sir and elijah just simply prayed and asked god to answer by fire and the great pillar of fire came down and burnt up the sacrifice god will always vindicate this message god will always vindicate his word he'll vindicate the prophecies of elijah the prophet in the bible and the elijah of this day that he has sent according to his word many do not recognize it yet but he himself has said after i'm gone they're going to start realizing that a lot of the things i've said and done with the word of god and they're going to begin to ask you about it oh they're going to want to know about it too late the door is closed the bridegroom has come and they all the wise have been shutting with god and he's speaking and whispering to them the secret things within the word of god and you're wondering to know where they hear that where they got that where is that where do i find that where can i you can't educate yourself into this you cannot this cannot be impersonated it's only revelated it's only given by god himself for his glory and honor blessed be the name of the lord yes sir ahab had a convention another convocation and he had this convocation at the gates of samaria along with king jehoshaphat and the motivation for that one listen close was to convince jehoshaphat to join with him or to unite with him to go to war but the emphasis i'm putting here is to unite to join with him so that they can fight against the common enemy you see that points to how they will do everything to try to get the elect to unite or cooperate or join with them yes that they might go against the unbelieving oh lord have mercy but thank god that god had a micaiah in that day and take god he has my kaya spirit anointing many in this day and in this hour that will stand by the word of god what did ma maikai stood by the prophecies of elijah i can say nothing different than what elijah has already prophesied how the dogs will lick your bow your bones amen how the how that uahab and you you are not going to have any victory whatsoever and then he told this great vision and everything else that god has given to him and then they threw him into jail as their will with many of you who truly see recognize and believe not have enough fiction or a fantasy or some religious delusion in your heart oh or some enchantment or you're charmed by this because it sounds nice and religious but because you caught something at the root of your being amen

pray for me as i pray for you that god will explain that god will magnify and expand his word that we might be able to grasp a whole of it like young eglets grasping a hold of their mother's feathers that they may mount up with wings like eagles run and not be weary walk and not fade god bless you real good [Music] you
