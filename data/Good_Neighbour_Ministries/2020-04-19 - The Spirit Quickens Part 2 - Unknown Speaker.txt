TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good Sunday morning neighbor I'm pastor John Simon from good neighbor ministries of Burlington Ontario Canada welcome to this broadcast today and also welcome into the presence of God may God richly bless you as we continue with our talk today concerning the Spirit quickens the word part 2 now on last Sunday's broadcast I spoke about the spirit quickening the Word of God specifically the spirit of the word of God quitting's they were to the age in which we are living in now in 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 verse 6 it is written in the Word of God not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who also had made us able ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the Spirit gives it life now last week I spoke on this wonderful subject of the spirit giving life to the word quickly in the word making the Word of Life and in that we showed how that God's Spirit quickened the word at creation then we showed how the Spirit of God quickened the word in the womb of Mary and caused a supernatural birth to take place we further show how the Spirit of God quicken the body of Jesus Christ that was in the tomb and God quickened him and raised him remember he was the word made flesh we received the truth from that the God's Spirit it takes God's Spirit to raise up resurrect or to quicken the Word of God this is why Paul used the term if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it shall also quicken your mortal bodies by that spirit the Holy Spirit that dwells in you so the word quicken the word at creation the word quickened in the new creation it quickened the word in the womb of Mary it quickened Jesus the word that was buried in the grave for three days then it raised it up we further made clear that even though the burial death burial and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ in type are in foreshadowing that his body his church his wife would be buried and we further show how did the spiritual resurrection of the true apostolic church the body of Christ with all of its original teachings its doctrine that body of Christ was buried during the dark ages killed pierced buried burned boiled and persecuted during the dark ages and placed in the great oven two men living under that Roman persecution suffering and finally death she was dead and buried the truth was dead and buried the word became dead it became a litany it became literature it became beautiful poetry in the minds of men it became religious history in the hearts of many men under Satan's seductive teachings and words mr. distractions of God's words subtractions from God's Word just deluded and deceived and seduced the minds of men by his enticing teaching spirits grabbed the whole of the mind of men took them away from the Word of God and so the true church was buried during these dark ages however I reminded you that in Joel chapter 2 verses 23 to 26 God promised according to his word I will restore saith the Lord God promised that he would restore everything let the plumber work the caterpillar and the cankerworm had eaten away from the church all the church was one church but after the Dark Ages it became broken up divided search into denominational isms and the fellowship the unity the love the brotherly kindness the joy the saints of God shared because they could see eye-to-eye on the troops of the Word of God that was taken away from them by the introduction of all manner of perverted doctrines contrary to the Word of God and so God promised in his word that he would restore his word he would restored his church and so justice in three days jesus' body was raised up from the grave we find that in three ages of the church the spiritual body his spiritual body was raised up from the tomb of the Dark Ages where Satan tried to kill her and bury her and confine her there but by the power of God the holy spirit of the Living God began to raise the church back up out of church history began to raise her up and bring her back to her original position we made clear to you that the first let's say the first indication of this or first sign of this was their life the shoot of God a little leaf just pointing out of the ground which represents Martin Luther a sprout coming out of the ground Martin Luther with his doctrine of justification by faith paved the way for John Wesley and the doctrine of sanctification first Wesley was teaching you're not only to be justified or saved and then live all kinds of lights contrary to the Word of God but you must live a justified life and also a sanctified or holy life toe toe so that you will represent God and your life your walk your talk your will be a testimony for the glory and praise of God but that was not at all the the true church was not yet fully restored under justification nor was it fully restored under sanctification so sanctification teaching the doctrine for doctrine means teaching on sanctification had to give way or make way for the Pentecostal baptism of the Holy Spirit the great 1906 read Bible on a Sousa Street when the Holy Spirit once again visited the Church of the Living God and revealed to us it's not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord so the Spirit of the Living God came back to the church again and began to move with signs and wonders and miracles and out poured himself upon the church with great anointing of the Holy Spirit and in there we find out how God was misunderstood because man had already inserted their various doctrines initial evidences their fundamentals their catechisms their books of claiming this is the book of truths and each one pointing in a different way so God sent a marvelous wonderful messenger and out of this great of pouring came God's messenger for the aged William Marion brand him better known in the writings of Gordie Lindsay of the Pentecostal revival wrote this marvelous life story of brother William Marilyn Brennan and entitled it a man sent from God the 20th century prophet God had promised according to Malachi 4:5 then he would send back the spirit of Elijah the spirit of Elijah to rest upon a man in our day and in our time to restore back the faith that was given to her Apostolic fathers buried during Roman condemnation and destruction and burial and that it would be restored and resurrected back true the message the Ministry and message not by the man but by his message God would use that to bring his elect back to the fullness of the truth and the revelations of the Word of God now this messenger we know with brother William Branham God rest his gallant soul a soldier an anointed man of God one like in his capacity and stature one said to each generation and now he has dead and gone and we are surrounded by a lot of imposters copycats impersonators contrary to God's promise of the owl now as I said before he is dead and gone but his message that he had and declared and is now preparing brothers and sisters preparing the way for the coming of the Lord himself farming no the scripture tells us Christ means The Anointed One he makes the way his message is making the way just like John the Baptist with the spirit of Elijah his message prepared the way cleared the baggage out of the way for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and then he had had to find the Word of God for that hour so does the Ministry of this messenger prophet identify the Word of God for this hour and this thing now identifying Christ Christ means The Anointed One or specifically the anointed Word of God anointed Word the Messiah the Word of God said to us back then that word that was sent came in flesh but now he has returned in Word form and we are to unite or meet not him in this corporal body at what we know in scriptures at the rapture but here he is appearing revealing making himself known in the form of the word and the ways being prepared for his physical coming his corporal coming in his corporal body for right now he is here in the form of the Blessed Holy Spirit God anointing and revealing his own word to his people for those who have two ears to hear let them hear what the Spirit of the Living God is saying to the churches speaking to his elect loss that he lost from the for the foundations of the world but and has come to seek and to save those that were lost many of them from from youth they recognized that they were born different they were born with a different in them sure they might have done every crooked thing every evil thing every wicked thing every sinful thing but yet in the deep of their heart they're recognized there's a voice calling there's something speaking to them and that same God promised that he would redeem he would call back his children back to himself that they will know him in the power of his resurrection and I want to take God today that under God be the glory that the seven seals of the book of Revelation have been opened unto us and out of the opening of those seven seals we fight all of it came for quitting power to quit net that God's spiritual body his church his elected church his wife to quicken her by the opening of the word the seven seals open out of it this quickening power was released upon the Church of the Living God the seven thunders came for the voice of God the mighty angel came forth and the true election of God could recognize it for this day for we cannot live us off of yesterday's mana we cannot live off of Luther's teaching we cannot live off of Wesley's teaching we cannot live off of all dead Pentecostal mana we must live from the fresh word of bread from heaven sake from God true God sent God anointed and God vindicated prophet and because we know that the word he preached that many have misunderstood it was not his word but it was thus saith the Lord long after it is gone yet God's Spirit is vindicating that message vindicating that word bringing it to pass unfolding it revealing it manifested and manifesting it in Revelation in understanding and wisdom and in healing miraculous power and the raising of the Dead mighty works of God being done through the Ministry of the entire bride of Jesus Christ for he has returned to inhabit and to possess and to claim his entire body and to take it with him back in the rapture for his glory amen praise God so we understand then friends that he the spirit out of the seven seals that were open came out to quicken their word for the hour to resurrect and restore that word that was lost not her only during the dark ages but God had lost his word beyond the foundations of the world which let me let me take that time I'm going to get to that but God's Word had to be restored back to us the word that was predestinated for this hour that part of the world and all of the work that was predestinated for this hour God promised to resurrect revive and restore this word back to us and when I say this word I'm speaking about the written word and I'm also speaking about the Living Word the Living Word and when I say the living word I'm not talking about Jesus that was back there 1900 or two thousand years ago and though was the word made flesh and then was crucified dead and buried but I'm take talking to you about when he died and he gave up the ghost and the Holy Spirit went back to heaven came back down came back down that he might be the spirit of truth that he might be our do the Miss are the power to give us power to be witnesses to fill us to anoint us and to dwell in us to be his people and he to be our God to live within his people to have his own house for Solomon could not build him a house but he has built and is building his own house building his house to live in his people for his people are the house of God knowing not you are the temple you are the temple your body is the temple of the Living God and God lives within your heart by faith if you are his elect and you believe his word you receive them within your heart amen so the word is being made flesh again not just in Jesus for that was already prophesied by Isaiah and many of the other prophets that the word would be made flesh and that word became flesh in one man named Jesus Christ and God the Jehovah of the Old Testament dwelt in him but he had an Earthling name that was called Jesus but the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the same Jesus of the new for he said it is when I to speak but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth these words God and Christ her one he said I am my father are one God created that body in the womb of Mary for himself came down and dwelt in that body and God in that physical body could not be killed they tried to crucify it at Calvary but he left that body came back down and now to dwell in the body of his believers or his believing elected church elected for this hour in other words when I say left I mean that God predestinated you to this out that when he comes in this age he was fine vessels prepared and waiting for him to indwell and use for his glory to manifest his presence to declare his word and to fulfill their purpose and mission here on the earth and to declare the name of the glorious heavenly Father amen and amen Oh may God bless you unbelieving god that while I'm speaking somewhere someone will recognize their position not in the church but in Christ that they will recognize their position of who they really are and why God placed them here upon the face of the earth now we know that Jesus Christ lost the head he was the word in them and he was the head of the body and that head of the body was raised up the entire body was crucified Devon berry but he died had ship amen represented there as the head of the church head of the body was raised up now we are in the midst of another resurrection but it's not the resurrection of the body of Jesus Christ back there it's now another resurrection of the spiritual body of Jesus Christ those who are elected to make up that spiritual body those who he he elected of course he's calling and placing them positionally before they're caught up and caught away in the what we know scripturally as the rapture rapture process now we know the very word rapture is not really found written in the scriptures but it says caught up they shall be caught up they'll be caught away sudden secretly they'll be caught away by the grace of God but we are in the midst and in the middle of another great resurrection and that resurrection has already started we are raised up from the darkness of the grave grave of what you are spiritually dead but you had hid quicken he has quickened you or raised you up to live above sin and to walk in a resurrected life or in a new life raised up above all the filth all the darkness all the doctrines all the confusion and the chaos of the age and the world and time and season that we are living in raises you up above every every blockage that will be placed in front of you that you might recognize him who to know his life eternal now that resurrection has already started and that resurrection leads right into the rapture so let me repeat Jesus Christ the head has already had his resurrection now this is the body time this is the bride's time this is the Lambs wife time train for his spiritual body to be made manifest it's manifesting time time for the glorious manifestation of the sons of God of God that were hidden in all these various denominations which the Bible types and calls in symbolic form about Mystery Babylon the mother of harlots and says in the book of Revelation come out from her my people be not partakers of our plagues God wants you to come out from these denominational strongholds of spiritual darkness and come to the light and Christ will give you life now when he died spiritually we died spiritually we were identified with him and in him for we were in him and together we made up the fullness of the word for in the beginning John chapter 1 verse 1 was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God now Jesus Christ Himself is the sum total of all of the word but the rest of the word was in him and so we were in him just as a man's life giving stream is in him God's germ of life was in him God's gene was in him God's attributes were in him and we see when he raised up that was his spiritual headship went to glory amen when he raised we raised spiritually so the head of the body went back into glory sent back the Holy Spirit to come back here and to quicken his spiritual body his life body amen that's the reason why he says in Luke 17 30 and 31 that as it was in the days of lot when in other words when you see the same conditions settlement conditions conditions of sin and darkness perils come upon you truth an era in disarray the entire thing era sits on the throne and the truth says by the wayside are begging for people to believe then in that day as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the day of the when the Son of man shall be revealed let me put this word here revealed again for he was the son of man when he came the first time and now he becomes the son of man the word made flesh back there now the same word of God wants to come to a flesh live in us what in US and he is given the word but not in the form of one man in the headship but the body Ministry of Jesus Christ living walking talking ministering moving main Festing even truth his people for his glory and honoring their word honoring their life letting them be written epistles to be read of all men thanks Peter our gracious Heavenly Father and so now we see his quickly his spiritual body the true church calling out to his lost wife his rib to come right back and to take her stand by his side to return to her original position where she was standing in the word in the days of the Apostles and the stone stand firm and be able to say a mighty fortress is our God a bulwark never failing our helper he amid the flood amen in many men we thank God for His Never word for heavens and earth will pass away but God's Word is eternal if you're a part of that word war eternal for heavens alerts will pass away but my words shall never pass away thanks be to God hallelujah amen so his still his seed which was and is still buried in the ground not natural ground but in the ground of our human bodies Oh blessed be the name of the Lord and the Spirit of God is here to call it up and out of the great sleep the great sleep of death spiritual death that she finds herself in raise them up by revealing his word his promise his truth none of just any random age but the word for the age in which we are living in and to make clear who you are who is what is your position what actions you're supposed to take how to live and walk and do and how we were to interact with what is God program of what he's doing in this day and time God's Spirit is here to quicken the word to the age raise us up into another dimension place us into a place where we can be in to begin to acclimatize into a rupturing condition where he has to take his church out of here by the power of the Holy Spirit for the same spirit if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you he shall also quicken your mortal body by that spirit that dwells within you oh yes was planted in you Roubaix before were even born blended in you before the foundation of the world for me no gifts and callings of God are without repentance for the gift of God is eternal life Oh God planted his gift in the elective to receive that gift in this hour that she might not be Ginn to see begin to have some realization of who she is Oh blessed be the name unto you you elected you who are called according to his purpose unto you it's given to know to see to understand the mystery or the revelation of the mystery of the kingdom of God in this out the full Word of God unfolding and making itself all clear to you just as much as fireworks going off oh the Word of God becoming a new Bible the Word of God becoming ablaze with light and love and and grace to recognize that you are not just a nobody you are not just somebody placed by the wayside but you're a better person than you think you are and God wants to have the right away and the preeminence within your heart and your life so that you bring you back to yourself to himself and that you might begin to know yourself of what God has in store for you and thank God that that seed of God that was buried in you that little piece of God that chip off of the old Rock of Ages that was in you before the foundation of the world that seed that was in there God now sends me the the Holy Spirit their water laughter and former rain to follow up on that scene that's in your heart to quicken the seed and to bring it to life Oh born again not by the will of man not by Seminary teaching doctrine of teaching from a Bible school a university though those things are good to know there Elementary's but talk of God taught by the Holy Spirit not to reject education not to reject any by the teaching but to recognize who you are and be able to discern the Lord's body of truth and to recognize what it is know what it is know what to take in and to filter out what you are to cast aside yes brothers and sisters born that can not by the will of man but we have born again by the revelation of God we are born again by the blood of God and we know that the life is in the blood o blessed be his name Oh glory to God so justification has made way for sanctification sanctification that's made wait what for Pentecost with the baptism of the Holy Spirit and now this is hard a Pentecostal doctrine and teaching of the initial evidence being speaking in tongues must now make way for the Holy Ghost himself we do not want just the towns we want the whole shoe we want the end carefulness of the Word of God now we see it clearly that this is where Pentecost failed they fail because they began to sink they were at the apex the pinnacle of all divine revelation and that God had stopped but I have news for you my brothers and sisters my wonderful Pentecostal brothers and sisters our God is marching on the pillar of fire never stopped it marched on until it was assured that their cross Jordan and were in the promised land and after that we do not read of its appearance until later on in the Bible to Paul and so on now we want touch on that but we understand clearly our God how smart stone and is marching on by his marvelous grace yes sir so we see friends clearly that they denominated and now modern-day Pentecost with it all it's miss placed doctrine misunderstanding God custom make way and is making way for the Spirit Himself justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the holy spirit but the baptism of the Holy Spirit is not the end all it makes way for the Holy Spirit himself in other words before the Apostles came on the scene with the back to the Holy Spirit Jesus this scene of God was there on the earth and here made way for these marvelous outpouring he gave up because came back when the Apostles and now the seven churches began the Word of God began to go through its cycle and after it goes through its cycle then it has to go back to being seed again it has to go back to being seed again and it takes nectar not just to have the Baptist Holy Spirit but the purpose of Pentecost the real purpose of the Holy Spirit is the car and baptize to empower the that seed of life God's like that germ the little spot the gene that was in you to anoint the attribute that offspring of the Almighty God to spirit unless that and brings it to life just let me read a little poem that I love so much listen what it says here it's called a little plant in the heart of a seed buried deep so deep a tiny plant lay it fast asleep wake said the sunshine and creep to the light wake said the voice of the raindrops bright the little plant heard and it rose up to see what a wonderful outside world this would be I trust the little seed within your heart will wake up to recognize the Word of God for your day that you will wake up and come to the light come out of the grave of denominationalism formalism come out of traditions of man come out of weird wacky perverse and perverted message teaching back to the word back to the original faith back to what God is calling to you you took you have a witness within you the Holy Spirit took to vindicate the word and reveal to you whether you are hearing or knowing the truth or not amen amen amen in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God the Word was with God I believe I was in God and with God I believe is your election see you were with God and in God hallelujah and the Word was with God and the Word was made - that we say that that does not mean just made flesh in Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago but the word was made flesh then and it's being made flesh in us now that seems new birth or not birth from your the seed of life in your virgin heart is now repeat rep reducing and new creation and new birth to manifest your heavenly father with all his glorious characteristics of the stature of a perfect man and to make him manifest to a world that is blind and walking in little decian darkness and to bring them to the perfect light man you wise men of today recognize the star that will lead you right to the perfect light there we were before the foundation of the world we were in God as the genes of God as Levi was in Abraham in type we were in God as the germs of God for the spoken word is the original seed the children of the offspring of God of children of the Almighty and offspring of the Almighty as the book of Acts calls us attributes of God or the seed gene the seed of God and so on and so on but when Jesus came to the earth we were in him and we were already a part of that word we were part of that word when he came here and we were all in him I said we were all in him because in himself says the scripture in Paul their thing is Ephesians that in him dwelleth the fullness of the Godhead bodily was in Christ the fullness of the Godhead bodily was in Christ all that with that wasn't God what poured into Jesus Christ and now what is happening that all that was in Christ oh is now by the Blessed Holy Spirit being poured down upon the Church of the Living God to wake her up to the rising of the Sun wake her up to the Sun shine bright and to recognize herself in the mirror of God's Word and rejoice with a hallelujah and a hosanna this it is he that cometh in the name of the Lord the white horse rider reigning right into your heart upon the perfect word of the hour that you might know who he is that he might come to your heart Lord Jesus conquer my heart today I surrender all Lord take my life and let it be Oh God let it be Lord Jesus or spirit of Almighty God take us here today so here we are and when he came to earth we see in him yes the fullness of the Godhead bodily praise God for evermore brothers and sisters we
