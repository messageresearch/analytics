this weekend we're going to be celebrating our precious John and Desiree Simon who God has given us in this life but I see something much bigger Hallelujah much greater praise the Lord much much more than what we could ever possibly imagine but just to know that we're a part of it amen just to know that God called us and gave us this representation here amen I want to welcome each and every one of you here tonight um praise God um you know before we get into uh acknowledging so many that are here I want to just acknowledge our Pastor John Simon and sister desire because it's this weekend that we've put together to acknowledge and to celebrate their Ministry amen praise God he might think he's retiring but God's got a greater work because there is no age in God there's no time in God Amen God is God and he's got a program and he's doing something and and John and Desiree they have a huge part and they're still in that plan praise God you know um as I was thinking about it there was two scriptures that came to my mind Jeremiah 3:16 or sorry Jeremiah 3:15 and I will give you pastors according to my heart and that just that just really struck me which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding if there's ever been a Ministry of a true Pastor it is in John Simon because I know and there's many out there that know that are here present now that have been a part of that Ministry years ago and know that God fed them God spoke to them God delivered them you're looking at a living testimony of a total Deliverance of the word of God that came through John Simon and there's many others here in James 4:10 it says humble yourself in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up we are not lifting up our Pastor John Simon and sister Desiree God is declaring his word and how pleased he is with the ministry and the life and the dedication that he gave and that he continues to give amen praise God he's a he's a front runner of the word yet he stayed in the background we were never a Ministry that was pushed up in front of the people he was never a man that was pushed up in front of the people but he was a front runner of this word and this message this weekend we're here to celebrate John and uh John Simon's Ministry in the service of our Lord Jesus Christ for close to 64 [Music] years to celebrate his wife sister Desiree who stood dedicated and a dedicated confidence to stand next to him through the good times and the tough times I want you to listen closely this weekend as we hear the Lord's Voice through the ministers that he has chosen to be here

that God is in the midst Hallelujah as we stand we're going to come from Matthew the 27th chapter appreciate you it's been a long time since I've seen brother Ro amen and we appreciate him by the name by God's grace it's been a long time and we want to go ahead forward within the word of God tonight Matthew 27 amen we're going to start at the 51st verse and behold the veil of the temple was rent in Twain From the top to the bottom and the Earth did quake and the Rocks rent and the graves were opened and many bodies of the Saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after this after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many let us pray our gracious father God we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for all that you have done for us and everything that you doing for us on tonight Lord we pray that you would break the bread of life to us oh God give us what we stand in need of encourage us rebuke us whatever you need to do Lord give us Grace to move completely out of your way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated when we think about the last days and we're living in a time where the world is truly falling apart even among the Christian uh people we realize that something strange is happening there are those who are getting closer to God and then there are those who are not so and we realize by the grace of God there is a pull upward and there is a pull downward I would like to entitle this message the veil is rent when I think about what took place there we know that it was necessary for Jesus Christ to die and to raised from the dead had he not done that we would not be here today enjoying his victory uh I thank God for the message of the hour thank you Jesus had not God sent Malachi for uh where would we be but I wanted to say these things to so that we can see that no matter how great the Revelation or Revelations are we must always come back to the place where it was made possible uh we understand the grace of God we understand how in the book The Bible itself was a closed book and everybody couldn't read it and even those who were ordained to read the scriptures were blind by their own traditions and we realize by the grace of God that even when Jesus was crucified oh Satan thought he had gotten the victory uh but he he failed to understand the scripture even so the Bible said had he known the princes of this world had known who he was they would not have crucified him and so we realize by the grace of God when Jesus uh uh uh descended into hell uh you know brother Adam said that when he went to Calvary he went as a man he died as a man and when when he went into hell he came to do one thing and that was to conquer and we realize by the grace of God according to the way brother bam described it he Satan said oh I got you now yeah I wish he I know he wish he hadn't had him but he had him right but he thought he was the Victor but we know know that Jesus came and he conquered Satan on his own territory I mean he took the keys of death hell in the grave and brother R said he kicked him back inside I like that drama I kind of wish it was my foot amen but nevertheless amen he he he he made an open show of his victory praise the Lord and you part of it Hallelujah see when you see me you don't you're not looking at defeat you're looking at Victory when I look at you knowing what this message have gone through many who started out with us is no longer here hallelujah but you see when you catch the truth of the revelation of this message you like Peter where else can we go Hallelujah amen because we realize by the grace of God no matter how much Satan has tried to destroy it you cannot destroy the true word of God hallelujah and God has said he'll never come back void now Jesus this is what I love it I love about the word that that here was Jesus in in in hell in the reason of the loss and you know he couldn't even resurrect here there was an appointed time and that time no matter it doesn't say what he what all he did now brother random said he preached he preached to those souls in the ant that was in the anal luian day right why didn't you believe but however long it took him he could not get up until he had an appointed time to resurrect because the scripture says as Jonah was at in the belly of the well so sh shall the son of man be Hallelujah and then there was another scripture says I will not leave your soul in Hell neither will I allow your flesh to see corruption so he had a time period that he could remain in hell you understand me he could not even get up if he wanted to Hallelujah as a a man he had to wait to that appointed time now listen the Bible says that when the When when when when the when the veil was rent the graves were open they were open but they couldn't get up until see they had an appointed time because Jesus had to be the first one get up he had to be the first fruit of the Resurrection and then after he got up they could get up y'all understand what I'm saying so we realize amen as I say all the time everything's moving by the power of God hallelujah yeah Lord so now people don't understand and they looking at this message and say you know we've been gone a long time it hadn't happened yet but what they failed to see is already happened sir I don't know about you but the Bible tells me that when I receive the Holy Ghost I am now sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus yall understand me you said well brother Brooks you haven't made it yes I have brother Brandon went behind the curtain of time and when he went there he saw me he saw you Hallelujah which was a Vindication to me that I have a a a theophany you understand me that there is no way that I can appear before God naked Hallelujah because I have a body but I'm waiting for that appointed time see here was Jesus many of them saw him as Mary's baby or Joseph's baby or carpet's son and here he was now being crucified by his own people sounds familiar and We Know by the grace of God that he knew these things were to take place he wasn't ignorant of it matter of fact when he was in the garden of Ed uh in in the Garden of Gethsemane he prayed father I would that this cup pass from me but nevertheless not my will but thine be done see that that there there's a great uh lesson in this because here was the son of God who was God cu the Bible said the fullness of God the fullness of the godhead dwelt in him Hallelujah but here as a man he's he had a will Hallelujah and he had to take his will and bring it to the will of God y'all understand me being in the flesh because the flesh has a will and You' got to kill it Paul said I I crucify this old man every day Hallelujah you see there's a purpose for this there's a walk going on my wife and I we we flew here from uh uh uh New York and and and we it was to to Toronto it was the worst turbulence that she and I had ever uh flown together you know with uh it was terrible and and she she she was terrified and uh one thing my wife got out of it she said to me she said it looks so peaceful from here but she says up there there's a war going [Laughter] on Hallelujah that's right you might look at me and it it may look peaceful but inside there's a war going on Hallelujah yes sir and I am determined to win the battle Hallelujah yes sir here was Jesus in plain view they didn't even know who he was they were still making mockery right I mean it's amazing that that that they couldn't see him that's right hanging there amen dripping with blood he was the true Mercy Seat he he was the one that they should have turned to but instead they walked away from him we realize by the grace of God that God intervened I love this because when Jesus said father is finished and he gave up the ghost it was like a amen from God he split he he he WR the faing to from top to bottom Hallelujah so when Jesus said it was finished it was finished I don't I'm not concerned about making the Rapture or whether I'm saved that has already been settled Hallelujah and you ought to know it's already been set out Hallelujah because he rent The Veil he was the only one that was qualified to take the book out of the right him hand of him who sat on the throne the Bible said no man was worthy that means me that means you that means everybody in here not one man was worthy Hallelujah except the lamb the bloody lamb Jesus himself was the only man worthy you say well brother Brooks how you going to make it to heaven I made it to Heaven by riding in him Hallelujah is that right cuz Paul said now my life is hid in Christ Jesus that's right I'm accepted into heaven only by him because I am accepted in the Beloved y'all hear what I'm saying you sure what brother Brooks we've heard this before it ain't about hearing it in your ear it's about hearing it in your heart Hallelujah but when you know that you've truly been set free some of us haven't been set free but the Bible said he whom the son is set free is free indeed Hallelujah free from what condemn Nation Oh my right he hung there they looked right at him and then see him hidden from them because they were blinded the Jews were blinded and of course Paul's uh Revelation and and words we realize that the Jews were blinded for us right but now the Gentiles are blind y'all hear what I'm saying that means the the Gentile age is almost over can I say it like that amen and and and and once that door is shut yeah brother random said not one extra only those whose names are written on the L Book of Life Hallelujah you don't have to worry about that why why would you you can't do nothing about it you might as well enjoy Jesus yall understand me so I look at this thing and I just believe it I don't know when it came to me I was bride but it's a revelation I have you see that Revelation keeps you from follow following all these winds and doctrines Hallelujah because you recognize no man put me in and no man can take me out hallelujah it's not about your a system this is not a system this is every individual coming to know Jesus Christ for themselves Hallelujah this is not a group Revelation some I was telling my church I was telling my church I said you know what you got Baptists who are Baptist because they go to a Baptist Church you got message people who claim to be message because they go to a message church and that's that's false that's false because you go to a message Church don't make you part of it Hallelujah you got to come into Christ hallelujah it's about being in him Hallelujah you love the Lord see that's what the Jews messed up they thought because they were Jews that settled it but no sir it didn't matter whether you was a Pharisees sadducee herodian it doesn't matter Jesus said except you believe that I am he Hallelujah they can say whatever they want to say about Malachi 4 Hallelujah except you believe that he is he now you say oh what brother explain that way he was human flesh but that was God manifested in that flesh the son of man right amen a son of man revealing the son of man Hallelujah but many people missed that Hallelujah that day Jesus was the mighty conqueror Hallelujah is that right and it proved moved it amen because he was the only one that was able to take the book but it doesn't stop there he says unto John you take the book and eat it all up Hallelujah he didn't say smack at it he said eat it all up and that John represents the bride I don't want part of the message I want all of the message Hallelujah now how I'm going going to get all of the message by taking what the prophet said and looking through the UR thurm yes sir Hallelujah you said why would you do that because he declared the book is now open y'all understand me shadows and types and all the things that that once was a mystery is now available Hallelujah don't be afraid that's right a lot of time we afraid of uh how brother them call it the doomed Devils the devils are doomed they know all about it why would we be afraid of them Hallelujah when we know what we have y'all hear what I'm saying you know what I'm trying to do I'm trying to take the responsibility of your salvation off of your shoulder and put it on his shoulder because the Bible said the government shall be upon his shoulder not yours his and when you can see that you're free and when you can understand what God has done for you then your joy will increase Hallelujah that's the truth people are sad because they don't understand who they really are Hallelujah but once that seven Thunder miss you or that seven seal mystery strike your soul then you become the word right yes sir Hallelujah you love the Lord hallelujah the Lord is so good to us I I I have a few quotes and I hope that's okay he said I tell you when you break that traditional barrier see that Jesus is way back and he he isn't now you know how people say like I try to tell people at my church your revelation of Jesus Christ is your strength if Jesus is not the same yesterday today and forever in your life you've got a weak Jesus that's right he is the same he cannot change Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the new Hallelujah and when you can I say see that but I mean receive that understand it here not here you become a Victor Hallelujah why because you realize that you are now just a model of of what Jesus wants he wants to act his life out through you Hallelujah and no matter what it is whether it's the experiences in the valley or whether it's on the on on a Mountaintop wherever it may be you say Lord not my will but thine be done Hallelujah is that all right see when you find out he's the same yesterday today and forever there's no limit to what God could do right here in this convention hallelujah it's the truth sir people think oh I got to feel a m rushian win you don't have to feel no no might rushian win Jesus said in that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father's in me and I am in you Hallelujah have you ever felt how can I say it like have you how do you know your heart is in you you've never seen your heart but it's in there hallelujah amen and let me say it like how do you know cuz sometimes you can feel it beaten and that's how it is with God when God is in there you'll know it you understand me and when you packing God let let me say it like this because when I think about him and sometime the devil tried to take it from me but when I think about how magnificent he is he created the heavens he created the Earth he created the universe and as the prophet said nothing is out of beat or time and then we think to ourselves is he strong enough to handle my battle let me tell you something he created it he started it and he knows how to finish it Hallelujah whenever God puts you through a battle he's expecting you to come out as a winner Hallelujah yes sir I don't care what it is he expects you that's the truth that is the truth than Lord hallelujah you know and and this is why when people don't understand I I say it like this when when the Old Testament dealt with the law you know the law we might look at it in this day of Grace like oh that's just too much but you got to realize that God gave them the law just to protect them that's right it wasn't like he put it there to imprison them but he put it there to protect them all those filthy Nations that they had out there all kinds of aeral diseases and all kind see it was a lot going on that's why God said don't don't mingle with that A little leaven leav the whole lump y'all understand me but see this is how it is and this is the the devil's program being in the message may even look boring to some compared to what the churches out there doing y'all understand me and somehow that Hollywood Swinging stuff seemed to appear to the flesh Hallelujah it was that that then when Israel with Moab and all of the others out there see when they had Church they had Church yeah but it involved a lot of Filth y'all hear what I'm saying and here was Israel look like they locked down Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not they didn't understand it so but when they would get into these kinds of Acts they seem to forget God you understand me they got into Idol worshiping and all of these things are I didn't mean to go this way but this is the way he's got me going see listen and and what happened is God was trying to get a a pure seed keep it clean keep it pure Hallelujah it it wasn't the people it was what they were worshiping how they were worshiping that God wanted to keep them away from it Hallelujah now we see the same thing happening even Among Us yes Hallelujah we look at them and say if they can do it we can do it but we need to stop that foolishness God has set the order of worship for the Bride of Jesus Christ and we need to stay with that order don't look around don't get out of Step see because let me say it like this there's nothing you can do to save yourself you're already saved is that the truth yes sir the prophet of God said before the foundation of the world he not only called you he elected you he chose you he put your name in the book the blood was shed for you way before you even came into Consciousness hallelujah oh my God so no matter how big the threat is can't stop this you love the Lord when people get hungry in their hearts there's a veil ready to be broken and I'm going tell you like this if you're not careful you'll think that you got the real Goods but you need to make sure you do have them you understand me because we have been called in this hour to be the Tabernacle of God hallelujah and like I tell my my my my church at home God don't live in a duplex hallelujah it's a one room house Hallelujah there ain't no two Thrones in this this chamber there's only one throne and he is the one that sits on that Throne Hallelujah now the thing is you're the greatest enemy you are your greatest enemy and God has to conquer you you say what yeah the devil's been conquered over 2,000 years ago you're the one that needs to be conquered Hallelujah is that all right it's nothing but the truth you know a lot of time we say well Lord why did you let me this happen to me no you failed the test let's move on See Jesus still stands among the among the people tonight Hallelujah and he's here to conquer your traditions y'all love that because everybody's got them I I was thinking the other day I said oh my God the work Paul had moving from Judaism into christianism and he had to deal with Gentiles my God didn't call us dogs for nothing see L literally I I don't know about brother John Simon but I've had my church had me on my knees crying not because they hurt my feelings because I'm crying out for their souls y'all got quiet on that one y'all don't know what a pastor goes through God bless him he's made it long enough to even retire praise the Lord amen God bless you brother brother Smith how are you amen I had brain freeze when I was calling earlier but still God is good to us isn't he no matter how people do and how they act you know I I'll say it by the grace of God God stands among his people you got to realize that how can you get rid of God anybody knows how to get rid of it the psalmist says I'll make my bed in hell Thou Art there he's always here but we fail to recognize who he is oh Lord have mercy upon us right really what was behind the veil brother let me go back to where I started what was behind the veil and and I'm not going to name off all of the the the symbols that was there the chairs and all but what was behind the veil was the allmighty god let's just go to the spiritual aspect of it we call it the holies of holies and we understand by by the word that there was there was only one one person or priest that could go back there was and that priest was the high priest and that was once a year but when that veil was rent that that's when God opened his arm and said whosoever will let him come now you got to realize amen that behind the veil was not only the anointing but it was the word and that word amen that that was delivered by Moses was kept for thousands of years Hallelujah and and it showed by the grace of God God had it written in stone to show you that the word can never change no matter how you think it's going to change it can never change Hallelujah but that anointing that power of God Amen was given amen at that time of of Pentecost because what God was doing was restoring because you got to realize by the grace of God when Adam and Eve fell they literally changed the dimensional World Hallelujah there's a Time Adam could hear God and God could hear Adam that's right but that that sin brought a breach something happened Hallelujah and we realize by the grace of God God the elect of God those who are of God God had had a place for them we call it under the altar Hallelujah it was once paradise and that paradise was split in two that was for the rich man y'all know how that was and it was for for for the the the the beggar that was there you know and they could commune or talk or see how it was but after the resurrection something happened and things began to move back in his position and you got to realize that here was Jesus the Chief Cornerstone he was the one that was going to operate everything and bring it back to his proper place why do you think when the seals were open brother random said it took us back to the Garden of Eden before the fall now I believe that and I believe that if you really do believe that you can glean from that Hallelujah now listen to way he says it he says before the fall so if you put yourself in that position you stand holy before God there is no sin in your life you stand powerful before God you become a messiah you become oh my God you become an AM to God that's who you are it can't be just here it's got to be here oh God help us here because I I found out that among my people if I could say it like that I struggled for years trying to help them see what I knew they did could not see and then you know I had a few Witnesses come to me and say you know what these people just need to be saved I'm trying to teach a message when they need acts 238 you understand me and you find that all among the churches people belong to message churches but that don't mean they're in the message Hallelujah and we preach to them like they in the message and they're scratching their head like what does he mean you understand me because he hasn't yet been born an eagle and you got to be born of Eagle I can't teach that to you glory to God right so we're in this time and and we're celebrating I'm celebrating I have I haven't gotten to the Celebration part yet but I'm celebrating amen what God has done in this ministry as I know some of the testimonies how how how the Lord allowed our brother John to be able to present Jesus to you yes sir you say you can't give nothing you don't have you got to have it to give it Hal Hallelujah and so we realize by the grace of God here God in this ministry you say has the brother been perfect he hasn't but you don't know it he hasn't but you don't know it cuz you looked at the false of the man you looked that things God don't look at right Hallelujah and you better be glad for your sake he doesn't Halle y'all hear me you can't be holy and Unholy at the same time you can't be a sinner and a saint you either one or the other Hallelujah and one thing I know about the Lord Jesus Christ he's does not he does not vindicate a lie hallelujah what is it we got I don't mean no how but I got to say it we got such cheap imitations of Jesus Christ I call them fake AI because you know they can say well brother brand say You must love your brother but ask him what is love and ask him do you love your brother but see a computer can answer that a computer can tell you amen what it it it's been programmed to say and that's what's happened to a lot of us we've been programmed to say but do you know him do you know him Paul said I don't want to know nothing except Jesus Christ and him crucified I want to know him in his suffering and I want to know him in his resurrection hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my God if we could get the people to see that there is a real life some people I'm going tell you something I've seen God baptized people with the Holy Ghost and I didn't I never had to preach to them any kind of doctrine of what to wear and what not to wear cuz when you get the real deal the Holy Ghost will tell you is that right and when the preacher says it you say amen hallelujah but you see people struggling they're not there yet oh but I saw them shouting I saw them dancing I saw them speaking speaking in tongues they're not there yet Pentecost did that ain't that amazing and they call themselves Apostolic but never got up to that place help us Jesus see we call ourselves message but we got a place to come up to y'all understand me the real life of Jesus Christ the real word manifested is is who the bride is she's not a fake she can't help herself I love that she can't help herself it's what she is hallelujah you know I was telling somebody I said you know how people say you know you too sheepish I'm a sheep it's my nature Hallelujah you know what I'm saying you you you're fnati you're too much of a Christian I'm a Christian it's my nature to be like Christ hey Hallelujah glory to God so we realize by the grace of God people want you to be what they are no sir I can't help it to be what the nature that's in me Hallelujah is that right that's why they couldn't understand the prophet of God because he was another nature he wasn't a denominational seed he was a word seed that's why why they don't understand you because you don't have a denominational brand on you you like a woman with no name huh but we do have a name is called the word of God you say brother Bo what are you talking about you know when the prophet of God went across the uh he had that vision of coming before when they was giving out rewards and they called William brandom he said oh I wasn't aware that I was supposed to go through this you know what I'm saying he said he started walking and all of a sudden his first wife grabbed his arm and his second wife grabbed the other arm well God never called their name yet he did cuz when he called William brandham he called them too because they were married to him yeah that's why the Bible said the whole family of Heaven and Earth is named after him oh somebody help me here is that right God couldn't destroy Sarah because what Abraham and when you see these things you realize no matter how what kind of tactic Satan formed against me I understand it now no weapon formed against me shall prosper hallelujah it's because of who I am it's because of who you are that's when that veil was rent the revelation of God overflowed see it's it's it's amazing how people struggle and and I said well if William Brandon wasn't the Elijah of this day we might as well look for another but we don't have time the world is falling apart y'all understand but if if he didn't introduce us to the Messiah wait a minute he introduced us to the Messiah John the B introduced the Jews to the Messiah and the Elijah of this day introduced us to the [Applause] Messiah Hallelujah that was him in 63 oh come on [Applause] somebody people can say whatever they want to say I remember when I was a boy a little boy I was out there playing football and a white man I may have testified about this a white man came in my neighborhood well that was not the usual thing normally if they came it was on the weekends collecting insurance or a Milkman or the policeman that's the truth but I remember when I was a boy we was out there playing and this white man came to me with the Life Magazine oh and he opened the book he said can you see the Lord he said the Lord is soon to come now I don't know who it was but I do know Willam Brandon was in town during that time in South Carolina I don't know but the man had on a black suit white shirt and black tie I don't know I can't remember the face but I do know one thing this man opened that book and out of those boys I was the only one that could see that cloud and you know what he did when I said oh I can see it I can see it that was my almost exact response you know what the man did Clos the book walked off and I never seen that book again until I came into this message now I that's my testimony that's my testimony and let me say it like this how often I mean what is the ratio of that ever happening that's all I'm saying see one thing I know about me and I know about you those who are truly called of God you are the invisible script you are the ones that are living this message out even in your lives now you may not be casting out Devils but you living the life amen you understand me everybody ain't ordained to cast out devils like everybody ain't ain't ordained to fast y'all know that one don't you so I'm just saying by the grace of God you have been ordained for certain things in your life recognize what it is and be happy but we were looking at everything else and God said don't look at every listen the Bible say don't examine your brother the Bible said examine yourself see whether you be in the faith hallelujah oh the Living Word of God is now on display and everybody think we supposed to be acting like Pentecostals you're beyond that that's all I'm trying to tell you you got something they don't have and that is life and let me tell you like this amen we needed the message we needed the opening of the word because that was the only way the veil to the soul could be open people say I had the Holy Ghost way before I'm not saying you didn't but I'm going tell I tell you what there was another room that needed God needed to go into is that the truth and only this message could have told us that cuz I was Apostolic and I thought I had it all of it y'all better hear me but one day I realized the power I thought I had was dis appearing and I remember what he said to me I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you and if he's leaving me something's wrong glory to God see you can't take that you got to have a birth in this [Applause] message I was telling somebody the other day I said brother bam said say it just like I said and people don't even know what he meant he well how you going to tell you don't be a parent don't be a bird a par key and just repeat it's like AI right don't just repeat understand what I'm saying re see every quote however you quote it has to have a revelation behind it Hallelujah you don't understand this thing intellectually you understand it by Revelation and Upon This Rock I build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail Hallelujah Jesus made a lie this is where we supposed to be in a time this is the time that Jesus is supposed to be made alive in you you are the light of the world Hallelujah Elohim dwelling in you you're the ones Hallelujah is that right she is the word and I know you've heard these things but it ain't just hearing it's manifestation time when I see the blood I'll pass over you amen and we know the blood of this day is the life of the blood when I see the life of the blood I'll pass over you I say that again when I see the life of the blood in you I'll pass over you the foolish version thought they had the blood but see that it has to go down to the soul Soul it's the soul that sinth shall surely die and this down in the soul is where life comes it is God's temple in the soul y'all understand that I'm not saying people are not saved I'm talking my bride right now yeah there'll be a lot of folks come up yes that'll be saved but when it comes to bride she's got to go through every one of the cours courts she's got to meet God but behind the veil is that right you know and I know it was one time illegal unlawful Amen to to for mankind to go behind the veil especially if he wasn't appointed to do so it was automatic death but since Calvary since Calvary sir amen it is death if you don't go back there Hallelujah and the only way you can get there is to die there you got to die if Jesus had to die for you to be free you must die in order to Be Free Die to what all your Traditions oh and we got a plenty of those we won't even go there but the Bible says whatsoever you do in word or deed do it all what in the name of Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him think about what we do during the day can you do it all in the name of Jesus I'm laughing like you now that's the truth that's the truth we all come short but by the grace of God he's Justified us and this is what I love about the Lord Jesus when he sets you free you are free Hallelujah now the the Bible says this that the whole family of Heaven and Earth is named after him right and and and and and and the whole thing is about this mystery as Paul said is to make men all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery you what this it's not just a mystery but it's supposed to be Fellowship right fellowshipping in this mystery and in other words whatever God say you are you say amen that's the truth if he says you are an invincible Army amen if he says you are without spot wrinkle of blemish amen if he says you're a messiah amen is that right if he says you're omnipotent amen see some of us you looking at your flesh your flesh will never be omnipotent sir amen he's talking about your soul the thing that makes you operate and I'm going to tell you what the the problem the problem with most people say Lord I want to be desperate but if you don't love him you'll never be desperate Love Makes You desperate you understand me love for Jesus Christ will make you desperate and if you don't love him you'll never get desperate Lord I want I want desperation I I got to make it you got to love him why do you want to make it let me move on by the grace of God the Bible says set your affection on things above and not on things of the earth is that right so what are we doing setting our affection on heaven in Heavenly places it says therefore put to death what belongs to your Earthly nature put to death your sexual immorality your impurity Your Lust your evil desires and Creed witches idolatry put them to death Lord how I'm going to put him to death down on my knees can I get a witness I shouldn't have to ask for it but that's how we do it prayer I'm almost done I'm coming when when I look at this thing this is this is how the the prophet God says I'm identified with a group that knows he's unveiled [Music] Hallelujah you see and and when you see that the word has been unveiled that what we experience in this day was Jesus Christ coming to his bride and when we can see amen that there's supposed to be an invisible Union how you going to how you going to unite with him if if if the word is still Veil you got to understand the day you're living in and and this we're not in the the seven like people no we we of that but we're not in it right and we're now in a bright age we're in an age where God is transforming US changing us from the inside out now I don't can anybody raise their hand on that God is changing me Hallelujah it changing me because I'm not doing the work he's doing the work Hallelujah I'm resting brother I'm resting because he's done the work and the work is already finished Hallelujah you don't have to worry you know the devil like oh and that's why a lot of us can't get over our sicknesses you always worrying but if you trust God you go to God In Prayer let me tell y'all something I don't care what kind of medication I'm not against medication but let me say it like this I don't care what kind of medication the the doctor give you there's only one Healer now they've been designed to help you but they can't heal you and you say oh I went to the doctor so and so and the doctor so and so is so good doctor so and so didn't do nothing for you but give you a prescription and you believed in the prescription and God healed you give me the shortcut Give Me Jesus H y'all hear what I'm saying give me Jesus I'm all I'm almost done but I'm celebrating because I could not have received my healing they said I I had cancer uh uh and everything and you know of prostrate and it was going to be this that and the other and you know how the doctor scare you y'all done heard that already but he scared me and I was I was I was crying and everything and I didn't think I was scared but I was because the way he laid it down and then he and then he didn't have enough Doctrine in him to even call me to the office he called me on the phone Hallelujah I thank God for my wife she sits quiet at time but I'mma tell you when you stir her up she know Faith Comes somewhere I don't know how I get there but it's dead two things you don't mess with her husband and her children [Applause] amen I think God for she said the Lord show me you don't have cancer I said praise the Lord I'm going to take your [Applause] [Music] report amen amen guess what I did me and her I said I'm going to give me some popey chicken cuz y'all know what it is you you trying to stop the cancer by eating all that nasty food y'all know it's nasty all that Health stuff they say you got to develop a taste I'm like Lord have mercy it's going take a long time for me to devel oh my God but by the grace of God we overcame until this day I get I get tested every year cancer free amen I got a I got I got the paper at home where they say I got cancer and got the paper at home where I say I'm cancer free amen no radiation no no no no cutting other than that they did the biopsy but but no no medical stuff God came on the scene H y'all hear what I'm saying and let me say it like this it wasn't me he gave me that faith I I just wish I could hold on to it y'all know what I'm saying he gave me that faith for the moment I can't explain it but I knew I just knew and I'll stop every demon that would come up to me but what if I said ain't no if and you know I wasn't nice either I wasn't nice in saying I had to rebuke him what you mean if if if if God didn't what no if I wouldn't let a crack of unbelief come my way that's how you have to do it and when your best of friends cuz many of them are my friends and family but if don't but if me God done show me yes sir you understand me that's how the bride stands she stands on his voice she stands on his Revelation and when he he reveals something to you don't you waver you stand right there Hallelujah that's when it comes to pass like they say he may not come when you want him but he's always on time Hallelujah he's unveiled and where is he now he's in you you need to use what you got sometime it takes more than one person to move the stone of unbelief it take a Mary and a Martha Hallelujah that's what prayer Warriors are far maybe you can't do it and you feel yourself doubting get you someone else to help you move the stone Hallelujah the bride work together not separate one body we is that right he's the same yesterday today and forever is that all right it's unveiled I I can't preach it like I want to but I'll tell you like this coming to see what the message has meant to me there were things in my life I thought I could never overcome even as a Pentecostal Apostolic whatever you call us oh I could shout I could dance I could speak in tongues run up and down the aisle the only thing I didn't do was a cartwheel I wanted to but I didn't want to hurt myself either I'm just being honest amen but by the grace of God oh man I tell you what he's still the same God and you know the prophet of God said it was Christ in Moses it was Christ in Joshua it was Christ in Jesus and it's Christ in his church and it's Christ in you but the Satan will always keep you down until you come to recognize he's in you and he not he because you don't feel him don't mean he's not there sometimes your body will be racked in pain you don't feel like speaking in tongues huh but you got to know he's there you got to know you got to know you can't fear the devil that's what he wants you to do no sir no ma'am I'm almost done just give me a minute I'm alone with the preacher if I don't be careful I'll be here you know how that works but uh so I'm trying to trying to we at a place where the Bible says says this Kingdom cannot be removed you know what I'm saying once you in the Kingdom you're in the kingdom and Satan's job is to keep you away from being getting there but a word of of uh encouragement he can't if God has predestinated you if God has chosen you to be bride there's nothing he can do to stop you it it's just how can I say it it's like being born well they trying so bad nowadays trying to change a man into something else but if you're born a man but if you're born a man you're a man I don't care how you fix it up shape it up cut it up the truth of the matter is your DNA is going to show you what you really are I didn't even mean to say all of that you know what I'm saying listen we are a Time the Bible said my sheep heareth my voice and a stranger they will not follow and I always try to tell people I said well then where was the voice but that voice wasn't wasn't it wasn't there to remain in William brandham or Elijah however you want to put it I have to say that name sometime because if I don't y'all going to think I'm not in the message and you know what that is tradition if I don't say Jesus Christ then you need to be wondering what I'm preaching about but anyway we look at these things and we find out by the grace of God and I'm I'm going quick cuz I'm I'm I can feel it moving but let me let me my she he gave me permission so set you know fasten your seat belts no to be truthful let's move on my sheep hears my voice but that voice is supposed to be in you now because the voice is the word and you've been commissioned to go look for the Sheep right you have been commissioned so when you preach or when you speak it's the same voice see brother brandom didn't have another Holy Ghost there's only one and when you get the Holy Ghost it's the same Holy Ghost now you might be commissioned to do something different than him but it's the same power is that right that's what he said he said a spoonful of the ocean is still the ocean all the qualities of the ocean is in the Spoonful and we need to recognize what who we are stop letting the devil beat you up we got to stop being carnal because that's the problem and you don't realize and I'm not screaming to fuss at you I'm trying to encourage you because I'm trying to tell you we need to Get Up Stand Up Get Out of the Dust of the earth you know stand up and be the bride and do what God tell has told us to do so we can get out of here that's what I'm interested in you're not tired I'm tired of this that's why I don't chew gum to this day I get tired of it right I just it and you know it's amazing how we we we don't but God is go he has a way doesn't he you know he had a you know Samson lost his way didn't he but God knew how to bring him back to censes and whatever God needs to do to bring you back to your senses he's going to do it he will do it and I trust he will because I like to see everybody on the other side everybody on the other side you love the Lord know that the that the debt has been paid you're free and you should choose to live the life for him because you're free let's stand [Applause] I hope this is not one of those songs you gonna sing because I feel led to sing it I love you Lord for your Mercy never fails me all of my days I've been held in your hand for the moment that I wake
