[16:37] now in 19 july
[16:40] 9
[16:42] 1982
[16:45] an intruder
[16:47] climbed up a drain pipe
[16:51] at buckingham palace
[16:53] and went right past all the security
[16:58] and went into the queen's chamber
[17:03] and there he had a a conference
[17:07] or a talk with the queen
[17:10] telling her about the social ills of the
[17:14] day
[17:15] and about his particular
[17:17] personal
[17:18] uh situation
[17:21] well the queen and her maid
[17:25] kind of distracted him
[17:29] and
[17:30] called for security and they later
[17:33] arrested him
[17:36] now i want you to see it's 40 years
[17:39] later
[17:40] this is like israel coming through the
[17:42] wilderness
[17:44] but 40 years later
[17:47] and today i'm speaking
[17:50] about
[17:51] the king of heaven's chamber
[17:55] i'm speaking about entering
[17:58] the king's chamber
[18:01] and not by climbing up a drain pipe
[18:06] not by
[18:07] climbing up
[18:09] a true and open window like a thief and
[18:14] a robber
[18:16] or
[18:17] like an
[18:18] uninvited
[18:20] guest
[18:21] but
[18:23] we
[18:24] want to enter the king's chamber i want
[18:27] to
[18:28] enter the king's chamber and i believe
[18:32] i have entered into the king's chamber
[18:35] and i trust many others
[18:38] will will
[18:39] walk the the golden stairs and enter the
[18:43] king's chamber also
[18:46] and so
[18:48] here we go as we
[18:51] go to the king's chamber
[18:54] we don't want to climb through a window
[18:57] as i have said
[19:00] but we want to walk up
[19:02] the step seven stairs
[19:06] of the seven
[19:08] church ages
[19:10] or
[19:11] spiritually speaking
[19:14] jacob's ladder
[19:16] uh portrayed in the bible
[19:19] by which
[19:21] entry
[19:23] into the king's chamber
[19:25] will take us
[19:27] to a wonderful wonderful place
[19:32] revealed by god himself alone
[19:36] praise god this chamber we use the word
[19:41] chamber
[19:42] but chamber can
[19:44] uh speak
[19:45] of a bedroom
[19:48] and it can also speak of a
[19:52] an audience room
[19:54] where a king or royalty
[19:58] will meet in chambers
[20:01] their
[20:02] court
[20:03] their ministers
[20:06] they will meet their counsels
[20:08] and there have
[20:10] secret
[20:11] conversations
[20:13] with them
[20:14] in that chamber
[20:16] their
[20:18] deliberations
[20:20] come to decisions
[20:21] and things very secret things will be
[20:25] talked about there
[20:28] i want to thank god
[20:31] for brother william marion branham
[20:35] god's great prophet
[20:38] of this
[20:40] 20th century
[20:43] and he referred to this
[20:46] sacred place this
[20:49] holy place of god
[20:51] and using uh many terms
[20:55] or many names
[20:57] but
[20:58] one of the most enduring
[21:01] and one with which
[21:04] many believers
[21:06] would be very familiar with
[21:10] is
[21:11] the very term
[21:13] that the angel of god
[21:16] when the angel of god met him
[21:20] and took him to the little room
[21:24] and then said to him
[21:27] i'll meet you in there
[21:31] i'll meet you
[21:34] in there in
[21:35] the little room
[21:38] is where he planned to meet him
[21:41] now you can uh you know much more about
[21:45] that
[21:46] and how
[21:48] he
[21:49] very much
[21:51] saw
[21:52] many people
[21:53] entering
[21:55] into that little room
[21:58] and when
[22:00] they came out of that room
[22:04] they were totally different
[22:07] they were changed
[22:08] by the power of god
[22:11] and made
[22:12] into different persons
[22:15] by god's grace
[22:17] now
[22:19] i want you to understand
[22:22] that
[22:25] many have talked
[22:28] about this
[22:30] great
[22:31] pyramid
[22:33] the great pyramids of egypt
[22:37] and there in the mysterious pyramids of
[22:40] egypt
[22:42] we find out my friends
[22:44] that there have been many studies done
[22:48] by dr petry dr davidson
[22:51] and many many others about the king's
[22:55] chamber
[22:56] a literal
[22:59] king's chamber
[23:01] built in stone
[23:04] there
[23:06] in the great pyramid
[23:10] and
[23:11] in their their writings and research
[23:14] they found that they
[23:16] a great pyramid
[23:18] was never kept
[23:21] there are other pyramids sitting in the
[23:24] desert
[23:25] but this great pyramid
[23:28] was never kept
[23:31] or
[23:32] they could not find a capstone they
[23:34] don't know what happened to it where it
[23:36] is it's a mystery to this very day
[23:42] oh praise god
[23:46] another thing is
[23:48] not only did they notice and see
[23:52] that the
[23:54] capstone
[23:55] was missing
[23:57] but they
[23:59] were intrigued
[24:01] by the
[24:02] repetitive use
[24:04] of the number seven
[24:07] used over and over again
[24:11] in the mathematical
[24:13] uh
[24:15] diagrams
[24:16] measurements
[24:18] and things
[24:19] in that pyramid
[24:22] and
[24:23] they were wondering
[24:25] about it
[24:27] of course if you were to literally
[24:30] go visit the great pyramid
[24:33] you'll have to enter there
[24:35] and then you'll have to go up what they
[24:38] call the grand gallery
[24:41] before you will get to
[24:44] climbing into
[24:46] the king's chamber
[24:49] before
[24:50] entering
[24:51] into
[24:52] the king's chamber there
[24:55] my friends
[24:57] which
[24:58] when they got in it was plain and simple
[25:03] they thought they would come into
[25:06] something
[25:07] ostentatious something that befits a
[25:11] great pharaoh or great king
[25:14] it was a simple
[25:17] room
[25:19] nothing
[25:20] for the eyes natural eyes to behold of
[25:24] it praise god hallelujah and i thank god
[25:30] god doesn't deal
[25:32] with these
[25:33] shiny
[25:35] ostentatious things
[25:38] but
[25:39] in simplicity
[25:42] he hides himself
[25:44] and he also reveals himself
[25:47] in simplicity
[25:50] and thank god
[25:51] our precious brother branham
[25:55] speaking about this
[25:57] king's chamber the king's chamber
[26:01] not a queen not a king
[26:05] but this king of kings and lord of lords
[26:10] his chamber room
[26:13] praise god
[26:14] listen
[26:16] he says now
[26:18] that door is still open
[26:22] people are coming from the east and from
[26:25] the west north and south
[26:28] they are gathering in
[26:31] there are great signs happening
[26:35] see in the skies fearful sights
[26:39] atomics of the air has been split
[26:43] the hydrogens are being burnt off
[26:48] saucers are flying around
[26:51] missiles
[26:52] that cannot be understood
[26:55] what sort of intelligence
[26:58] is behind that
[27:00] uh oh
[27:01] mysteriously
[27:03] things are slipping in on the scene
[27:06] with lightning speed
[27:09] i tell you we are
[27:11] near the end
[27:13] he continues
[27:15] and the great pyramid
[27:18] that enoch built
[27:22] enoch built the pyramids
[27:25] the great pyramid
[27:27] and that is why
[27:29] it's such a mystery and they are
[27:32] wandering so much about it
[27:35] the last chamber
[27:38] is now
[27:40] gone through
[27:42] we are now ready
[27:44] for the king's chamber
[27:47] the coming of the lord oh hallelujah
[27:51] glory to god
[27:52] right on top
[27:54] for that's the key stone
[27:57] the capstone is the keystone
[28:00] all the calendars
[28:03] of astronomy
[28:05] points right straight
[28:07] the stars
[28:09] are now declaring it
[28:12] you see the first time he
[28:14] came the wise men looked up and they saw
[28:18] the stars
[28:20] and by the stars they knew
[28:22] that the king was coming
[28:25] messiah was on earth
[28:28] they would recognize it by the presence
[28:31] of the stars in the skies but thank god
[28:35] it in our day it was not stars like the
[28:39] wise men saw back there up in the
[28:42] firmament of the heavens
[28:45] but
[28:46] seven
[28:47] stars
[28:48] that he held in his hands
[28:51] which represents
[28:53] seven messengers or men
[28:56] on the earth
[28:57] and this last one is saying
[29:02] we have now gone through the last
[29:05] chamber
[29:07] ready for the king's chamber
[29:10] amen oh and the stars are pointing to
[29:15] what the coming of the lord pointing to
[29:19] what the presence of jesus christ
[29:22] oh hallelujah
[29:24] where are we at that's out of the ark
[29:27] amen
[29:28] whoa
[29:29] see
[29:30] everywhere prophets have prophesied
[29:35] distress among nations
[29:37] the sea roaring tidal waves
[29:41] carriages going through the highways
[29:44] with great torches running like
[29:47] lightning
[29:48] see
[29:49] we've passed right on by these
[29:53] milestones
[29:55] of prophecy
[29:57] as if there were nothing at all why
[30:00] because the people do not recognize what
[30:04] is happening around them they not
[30:07] recognizing
[30:09] these things when they take place
[30:13] only the spiritual minded
[30:16] are catching
[30:18] signs of his coming
[30:21] oh praise god
[30:23] the nearness of his coming
[30:26] now
[30:27] in the bible
[30:30] we are living in the last day do you

[30:35] i believe we are living in the
[30:38] last days now

[34:58] seal of the united states of america
[35:03] and the next site is what
[35:05] is a pyramid

[37:26] last messenger

[37:31] and protecting the world to move out of
[37:34] the scene so that the king will bid you

[38:57] and be able to see
[38:59] the day
[39:00] in which you are living in in the
[39:03] pyramid he was trying to let the people
[39:06] know that he was that lost guard he was
[39:11] the last star messenger to be able to
[39:15] bring you to the presence of the king
[39:18] hallelujah amen now
[39:22] in this pyramid as i've said
[39:25] was seven steps
[39:28] and there to the king's chamber

[39:40] before the king takes his throne oh
[39:44] glory to god amen my friends that is so
[39:49] plain
[39:50] so
[39:51] straightforward
[39:53] if you can't see that then you're
[39:56] certainly spiritually blinded this is
[39:59] not something man made or made up by me
[40:03] or any other person this is from how to
[40:06] the mouth of god's prophet just thus
[40:09] saith the lord hallelujah
[40:12] amen oh praise god amen that my friends

[40:45] notice i do not preach a pyramid
[40:50] message or a pyramid religion
[40:54] see
[40:56] but we know
[40:58] certainly
[41:00] that
[41:01] the pyramid
[41:03] and its foundation goes right up
[41:07] into the king's chamber
[41:10] but just before
[41:12] you hit
[41:14] you hit that seventh
[41:16] introduction step
[41:19] amen see
[41:21] there's a little
[41:23] introduction plan plank there
[41:27] an introduction area
[41:30] where that one last one would introduce
[41:34] you
[41:35] where
[41:36] a messenger
[41:38] comes out
[41:40] there to bring you to the king or bless

[42:00] manifested revealed to us
[42:03] and
[42:04] making itself clear to us by the
[42:08] inspiration of the holy spirit this is
[42:10] not forsaken for healing of the satan
[42:14] and the discerning of spirits but this
[42:16] is the revealing of the word this is the
[42:20] spoken word making itself manifest as it
[42:23] lives in and through the hearts and
[42:26] lines of the believers oh blessed be the
[42:29] name of the living god
[42:31] now
[42:32] when you get to that seventh wall there
[42:36] there there is an introduction plank
[42:40] where a messenger comes out to bring you
[42:43] to the king thank god he helped to bring
[42:46] me to the king but you see
[42:49] the headstone was rejected they don't
[42:53] know
[42:54] where it's at because it's a rejected
[42:57] stone but that's the stone that will
[43:01] kept the whole thing amen
[43:04] that is what makes it
[43:07] amen
[43:09] the pyramid
[43:11] after
[43:12] completing
[43:14] seven church ages
[43:17] that's what makes it you see that one is
[43:19] natural you can see it with your eyes
[43:21] but spiritually
[43:23] hallelujah
[43:26] the church was being built
[43:29] a city four square
[43:32] being built up
[43:34] a new jerusalem beautiful
[43:37] like a bride adorned for her husband
[43:40] blessed be the lord amen and there it is
[43:44] see for the stone caps the whole thing
[43:48] that makes it the pyramid
[43:52] through them seven church ages
[43:56] hallelujah
[43:58] and it all
[44:00] works that way then he talks about
[44:02] adding grace and adding all these and
[44:05] that has been something misunderstood a
[44:07] lot of people thinking that you can add
[44:09] those things to yourself not having a
[44:12] revelation of it but god use that for
[44:15] his glory to draw people closer to him
[44:19] until it gets up to christ
[44:22] who is the head stone
[44:25] listen
[44:26] and the headstone is the door
[44:29] for i
[44:30] am the door jesus christ is the
[44:33] headstone
[44:34] and he says
[44:36] i am
[44:38] the door hallelujah god's only provided
[44:42] place of worship
[44:44] on praise god friends i'd like to share
[44:47] with you
[44:48] the words of this beautiful
[44:52] old song
[44:54] that goes this way
[44:56] in the upper room with jesus
[44:59] sitting at the mercy seat
[45:03] daily there my sins confessing
[45:06] seeking there
[45:08] his mercy sweet
[45:11] trusting in his love and merit
[45:14] as i seek for him
[45:17] in prayer
[45:19] speaking there with him in secret
[45:23] telling
[45:24] him
[45:26] where
[45:27] my weary feet have trod
[45:30] there in the upper room with jesus
[45:34] my lord
[45:36] and
[45:37] your god
[45:40] now i'm quoting from the seventh seal
[45:44] and now as certain as i stand at this
[45:47] platform tonight
[45:50] i had a revelation
[45:54] that revealed
[45:57] and that
[45:58] revelation is in a three-fold manner
[46:03] that i will speak to you by god's help
[46:07] one fold of it
[46:10] and then you you let's go over that
[46:13] first
[46:15] here is the revelation
[46:18] see
[46:19] those seven thunders
[46:23] that he heard thunder
[46:25] right
[46:27] and was forbidden to write
[46:30] that's what the mystery is laying behind
[46:34] is them seven consecutive
[46:37] thunders rolling out and here it says
[46:41] brother ran him wrapped his hand on the
[46:44] pulpit seven times one two three four
[46:47] five six sev he wrapped his hands on the
[46:51] pulpit like that now see it is the
[46:55] secret behind that
[46:57] that no one knows about
[47:01] hallelujah
[47:03] and john
[47:05] was forbidden
[47:07] to write it
[47:09] oh praise god now brothers do you see
[47:13] you hear myself
[47:15] and maybe others
[47:19] say and speak of
[47:21] the unwritten word
[47:25] the devil in turn twists that
[47:28] and tries to get fault to believe
[47:32] that it's something you're adding on to
[47:34] the word or you're trying to make up
[47:37] your own revelation and and place it in
[47:41] there or you're trying to make yourself
[47:43] spiritual
[47:44] but that's not the case
[47:47] it's out of god's own prophet's mouth he
[47:52] was forbidden to write
[47:55] the words
[47:57] that rolled out roared out and spoke out
[48:02] for that was the voice of the mighty
[48:04] angel speaking who was who is what
[48:06] christ
[48:07] the word
[48:08] speaking
[48:10] but he was forbidden to write he
[48:13] couldn't write that part
[48:15] oh my let's go on hallelujah see he was
[48:20] forbidden to write it
[48:22] not even a symbol which means he wasn't
[48:26] even the right words because words are
[48:28] symbols uh you know to symbolize meaning
[48:31] so he wasn't allowed to write
[48:35] see
[48:36] oh my see
[48:38] and so
[48:39] why
[48:41] there was no activity in heaven and the
[48:44] reason why
[48:46] because
[48:47] it
[48:48] might give away the secret
[48:52] god's great secret
[48:54] would be
[48:55] discovered because the devil is
[48:58] everywhere always peeping and prying and
[49:02] looking and searching and trying to find
[49:05] the secret things of god
[49:08] to copycat to get as close as he
[49:11] possibly can for he's not a creator he's
[49:14] a perverter he uses what god has already
[49:18] made and there's a lot of people with
[49:20] that nature
[49:22] they can't create them for themselves so
[49:24] they they'll steal they'll lie they'll
[49:26] cheat they'll take other people's things
[49:28] and then they'll pervert it
[49:30] and then they'll claim
[49:32] they created it their claim ownership of
[49:35] it but here look look at the word
[49:38] oh see it might give the secret away
[49:43] oh my
[49:45] what the thunder sound right out seven
[49:48] straight thunders
[49:50] right in a row
[49:52] one two three four five six rolling
[49:57] thunder
[49:59] oh my see what a perfect number what
[50:03] that's speaking of the perfect word out
[50:07] of the mouth of god
[50:09] seven thunders in a row amen see there
[50:14] it is my brothers and sisters we see the
[50:19] word of god and the heavens could not
[50:22] write it
[50:24] the heavens or the angels
[50:28] they knew nothing about it
[50:31] nothing else about it
[50:34] it was a relaxing time
[50:37] it was great
[50:39] because it was kept secret from the
[50:41] angels friends when you enter into this
[50:46] little room of revelation
[50:50] of divine wisdom and understanding
[50:54] you've come to a rest
[50:56] you've come to relaxation in god
[51:00] you're broke through every song barrier
[51:04] and there you are
[51:05] resting in his grace love and mercy
[51:09] oh praise god you're not keeping
[51:12] yourself
[51:14] you don't have to work yourself up into
[51:16] anything
[51:17] you don't have to my friends
[51:20] do anything of your own self
[51:22] but salvation is of the lord and you
[51:26] rest in his love and great mercy amen
[51:31] hallelujah
[51:32] oh my
[51:34] wow why was it kept so secret
[51:38] no why
[51:40] you see
[51:42] if satan could get a hold of it
[51:45] he might do great damage
[51:49] but there is one thing he don't know
[51:52] see
[51:53] now
[51:54] he can interpret anything else he wants
[51:56] to interpret
[51:58] i want you to understand that the devil
[52:01] is so cunning so slice or slick so smart
[52:05] so intellectual and intelligent that he
[52:08] can analyze debate and he can
[52:12] parse things and bring them down to
[52:15] little bits and pieces you see he can
[52:18] interpret
[52:19] anything he wants to
[52:22] and he can impersonate
[52:25] any kind of a gift gift and brother
[52:28] branham pauses here to say
[52:30] i hope you are learning something
[52:34] here amen he can impersonate
[52:38] any kind of a gift
[52:41] he knew very well after he's gone people
[52:44] are gonna rise up
[52:45] and impersonate discernment impersonate
[52:49] calling people out of their seats and
[52:50] their names and various things like that
[52:53] there will be impersonators just like
[52:55] moses had his impersonators that will
[52:57] throw down their snakes and say oh look
[53:00] i'm doing the same thing like him and
[53:02] it's nothing of the kind there's only
[53:05] one like that in every age
[53:08] the rest are impersonators and copycats
[53:11] whoever they be this is not to do with
[53:14] the individual the person but the spirit
[53:17] that's motivating them making them think
[53:20] they're doing god a service but not
[53:23] doing his perfect will
[53:25] amen yes
[53:27] there it is
[53:29] he can impersonate any kind of a gift
[53:33] but he cannot know this nor impersonate
[53:37] it
[53:38] for it's not even written
[53:42] in the word
[53:45] the unwritten word
[53:47] it's a total secret
[53:49] it's the word
[53:51] but it was that that was not allowed
[53:55] to be written down
[53:57] oh my
[53:59] hallelujah
[54:00] oh praise god
[54:03] amen
[54:04] the angels were shut out of it
[54:08] if they even made one move
[54:11] they will give it give something away
[54:14] so they all decided to shut up
[54:18] they'll quit their hopping i hope a lot
[54:21] of people will quit that everything
[54:24] stopped right there
[54:27] you see seven
[54:29] god's perfect number
[54:32] amen
[54:33] and he knocks on the puppet seven more
[54:35] times amen right down the road seven
[54:40] thunders uttered right straight together
[54:44] and they uttered like they were saying
[54:47] or spelling out something
[54:49] something was being said
[54:53] something was being said words were
[54:56] being said
[54:57] right and john
[55:00] started to write it
[55:02] amen
[55:03] hallelujah but he was stopped he said
[55:07] don't write it john
[55:09] don't write it
[55:10] hallelujah oh my
[55:13] spoken
[55:15] but not allowed to be written
[55:21] amen do you get it
[55:23] holy men of god wrote as they were what
[55:28] inspired by the holy spirit they were
[55:32] able to write it and it's the same way
[55:36] in this day and in this hour
[55:38] remember they did not have any written
[55:42] bible at the time
[55:43] but by inspiration of the holy spirit
[55:47] they knew god's truth
[55:50] and then
[55:51] when it was time when they were
[55:53] permitted then they wrote it in what we
[55:57] know now as the bible
[56:00] but everything has gone its full circle
[56:04] its full cycle
[56:06] and the seventh day must give way to the
[56:10] eighth day
[56:11] and the inspiration and the anointing
[56:14] that was upon them in that day to make
[56:18] them write the word that same
[56:21] inspiration
[56:22] has come back in this day the blessed
[56:26] one knowing to fill up people that they
[56:29] might not
[56:30] write it in the terms of a book but they
[56:34] are the living epistles of the living
[56:36] god living bibles living walking words
[56:40] of god they are expressions of the
[56:43] almighty on the face of the earth
[56:45] hallelujah sons and daughters of god
[56:48] with all of his characteristics and his
[56:51] mannerisms because the holy spirit flows
[56:54] through them praise god forevermore the
[56:58] mighty god in christ now christ in the
[57:00] church the kingdom coming oh blessed be
[57:03] the name of the lord amen what is it
[57:08] the angels in heaven
[57:10] don't even know it
[57:12] but it's there
[57:14] it was spoken
[57:16] so it's there
[57:18] but john wasn't allowed to write it
[57:21] oh praise god what is it the word of god
[57:25] cannot return to him void
[57:28] and the word the unwritten word is there
[57:32] it's here among us
[57:34] whoa
[57:36] and those who were elected and anointed
[57:40] him that had an ear or he or she that
[57:44] was given an heir to hear
[57:46] given the spiritual eye of the heart to
[57:49] see
[57:49] amen they'll see it they'll hear it
[57:53] they'll understand it while others are
[57:56] peeking and prying and theologizing and
[57:59] wondering and everything else god will
[58:02] make it clear hallelujah for he is his
[58:05] own interpreter and he'll make the world
[58:08] clear to your soul that you'll recognize
[58:11] him whatever it is that he is doing amen
[58:15] oh my
[58:17] yes you see if satan could get a hold of
[58:20] it he could do great damage
[58:24] you will have to take my word for this
[58:28] but i know if i'm planning to do
[58:30] something
[58:31] i know better than to tell anybody about
[58:34] it not that the person would tell it
[58:38] but satan would hear me saying it
[58:41] and he can get it
[58:43] amen he but he can't get it
[58:46] if in my heart
[58:48] it's there
[58:51] as long as god has got it in my heart
[58:54] closed up
[58:56] with the holy spirit
[58:58] then it's between
[59:00] me
[59:01] and god alone you see he's talking now
[59:05] about when an individual
[59:07] into the king's chamber enter the little
[59:10] room and they have a conference with god
[59:15] and god begins to speak with them
[59:18] and reveal things to them then my
[59:21] brother son certain things are locked up
[59:25] in the heart oh glory to god it's locked
[59:28] up amen inside of the heart
[59:32] and the devil can't get it while it's
[59:36] locked up inside of the heart for it's
[59:40] sealed or closed up by the holy spirit
[59:43] and the devil can't
[59:45] get to it amen hallelujah he don't know
[59:50] nothing about it
[59:52] until you speak it
[59:55] then he hears it
[59:57] oh
[59:58] my friends i have to told people a
[1:00:02] certain certain thing then you watch the
[1:00:05] devil
[1:00:06] cut off every avenue every wheel that he
[1:00:09] can to get there and beat me to it
[1:00:15] but if i get a revelation from god
[1:00:18] and don't say nothing about it
[1:00:21] then it's different
[1:00:24] remember
[1:00:25] when i say to you satan will try to
[1:00:30] impersonate
[1:00:32] he'll try to impersonate
[1:00:36] everything
[1:00:38] that the church will do he thinks by
[1:00:41] doing that that's me speaking now he
[1:00:44] that that by doing that
[1:00:46] he he'll suddenly find the right thing
[1:00:49] or or he'll he'll slip into the right
[1:00:52] thing that he couldn't see or couldn't
[1:00:54] understand maybe if he studies the
[1:00:58] message more maybe if he spend more time
[1:01:02] with the listening to the tapes alone
[1:01:06] then he'll get it or or
[1:01:08] or if he goes another way
[1:01:10] whatever way
[1:01:12] it is but he can't get it
[1:01:15] so he'll try to impersonate it
[1:01:18] he's going to manufacture something
[1:01:21] he'll try to impersonate he's tried to
[1:01:24] do it
[1:01:25] we notice it he's done it through the
[1:01:28] antichrist
[1:01:29] amen but there's one thing he cannot
[1:01:33] personate there'll be no miracles to
[1:01:36] this you see
[1:01:37] cause he don't know it
[1:01:40] there's nowhere for him to know it for
[1:01:43] this is the third pull praise god now
[1:01:47] how simple that is but a lot of folk
[1:01:51] have been distracted they have been
[1:01:54] thrown off balance
[1:01:56] they the they've just gone off
[1:02:00] with their ideas of what this third pull
[1:02:03] is about just by taking a mass of
[1:02:06] quotations and massive sayings putting
[1:02:09] them together
[1:02:10] and thinking that that will give them it
[1:02:13] that doesn't give you it the holy spirit
[1:02:17] is the one that has to bring you into
[1:02:20] the room oh no only the spirit of god
[1:02:25] after the invitation by the last guard
[1:02:29] messenger star on the stairway oh my
[1:02:34] then the king invites you to come
[1:02:37] oh my and then my friends no one else
[1:02:40] has anything to do with it not the last
[1:02:43] messenger
[1:02:44] nobody it's you now and god alone as you
[1:02:49] enter into his presence but a revelation
[1:02:52] of the holy spirit oh praise god
[1:02:55] forevermore amen yes sir for this is the
[1:03:00] third paul
[1:03:02] amen
[1:03:03] he knows nothing about it
[1:03:06] he doesn't understand it
[1:03:09] there's a secret that lays behind there
[1:03:13] amen
[1:03:15] glory to god
[1:03:16] in the highest
[1:03:18] i can't never think be
[1:03:20] think or be the same

[1:19:32] light
[1:19:34] and can't see the stars shining brightly
[1:19:37] in the sky
[1:19:40] because they're looking so much at the
