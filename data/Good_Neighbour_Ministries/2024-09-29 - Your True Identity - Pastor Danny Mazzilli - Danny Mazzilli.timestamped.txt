[38:49] to talk about your true
[38:52] identity amen your true
[38:55] identity um this is a day day where
[38:58] identity crisis is in
[39:02] fullblown
[39:03] uh
[39:05] turmoil amen people just are are being
[39:09] bombarded left right and center and uh
[39:12] many people can't even
[39:14] identify who they are anymore and this
[39:17] is the age that we're living in we're
[39:20] going to be reading from First
[39:23] Corinthians chapter 13:
[39:26] 9-2 for we know in part and we prophesy
[39:30] in part but when that which is perfect
[39:34] is come then that which is in part shall
[39:37] be done away we believe that we're
[39:40] living in a day where that which is
[39:43] perfect is
[39:45] come that which is perfect is Jesus
[39:49] Christ the
[39:50] word it is prophesied for this day that
[39:54] the word would be fully restored amen
[39:57] amen and we have received that that word
[40:00] we've received that message and we know
[40:03] now that the day that we're living in is
[40:05] going to give us more than just
[40:09] Christian uh doctrines or theology or
[40:13] churchgoing but that which is perfect is
[40:17] come and then that which is in part
[40:20] shall be done
[40:22] away when I was a child I spake as a
[40:25] child I understood as a child and I
[40:28] thought as a child but when I became a
[40:32] man I put away childish things for now
[40:36] we see through a glass Darkly but then
[40:39] face to face now I know in part but then
[40:45] shall I know
[40:46] even as also I am known you may be
[40:51] seated the Lord add His blessings to the
[40:53] word of God Amen praise God
[40:58] you
[40:59] know one day a famous preacher was
[41:02] visiting a nursing
[41:04] home where some patients with
[41:06] Alzheimer's lived and he went around and
[41:09] he was greeting the people who were in
[41:12] The the nursing home and they were very
[41:14] glad to see him because he was a famous
[41:17] preacher and he walked up to one lady
[41:20] and asked hello do you know who I
[41:24] am and she turned around and looked at
[41:26] him and she says well
[41:27] if you go to the front desk the lady
[41:30] there will tell you who you
[41:32] are you see sometimes it's not just
[41:35] people that are experiencing Alzheimer's
[41:38] that forget their
[41:39] identity it's Everyday People it's
[41:43] Christians it's those that are you know
[41:46] living for God and believing that
[41:48] they're living for God and and
[41:50] identifying themselves as Christians but
[41:53] not recognizing that they've actually
[41:55] lost their identity they've lost their
[41:59] Oneness their their their their pure
[42:02] relationship with God because to truly
[42:06] know God will truly bring you into a
[42:10] place where you know who you are amen
[42:14] and so
[42:16] um maybe we're
[42:19] under a delusion of mistaken
[42:23] identity maybe uh you know like the
[42:26] world right now uh one of the the
[42:29] biggest um thefts that's taking place
[42:33] right now is identity theft it's a
[42:37] proven
[42:38] fact and um you know uh stolen identity
[42:44] is an
[42:46] enemy it's something that
[42:48] steals things that are important to
[42:52] people you could even say that we have
[42:54] we've participated in a form of identity
[42:58] theft our god-given identity can get
[43:01] lost or stolen by our enemy who comes to
[43:06] kill and to steal and to
[43:09] destroy Satan's goal is to destroy your
[43:14] ability to know who you really
[43:18] are you know American adults lost a
[43:23] total of $43
[43:25] billion to ident theft and fraud in
[43:31] 2023 and it's growing it's getting worse
[43:35] that includes 23 billion lost to
[43:39] traditional identity fraud which
[43:41] affected about the same number of people
[43:45] 15 million in 2022 when the number was
[43:50] 15.4 Million but total losses grew by
[43:55] 133% last year according to a
[43:59] report it's it's it's it's an identity
[44:04] crisis okay one-third of adults in
[44:07] America have experienced some level of
[44:10] financial identity theft we're talking
[44:15] $43
[44:16] billion in Theft that's just a type and
[44:21] and and billions of
[44:23] people it's just a type showing how many
[44:29] Christians these days and the number of
[44:33] so-called Believers of
[44:36] God that their true identity is being
[44:40] stolen today you can identify
[44:43] yourself with anything you can identify
[44:47] yourself with any gender you can
[44:49] identify yourself with an animal or
[44:54] anything just as long as the enemy can
[44:57] get you into a state of deception where
[45:00] you don't identify with the
[45:03] word that's what the enemy is trying to
[45:06] do and that's why we're in such a
[45:09] condition where the world is is uh is
[45:12] totally uh lost and and and mental
[45:15] health is at levels like have never
[45:19] experienced before people are losing
[45:23] their minds which is in direct
[45:25] correlation with losing losing your
[45:30] identity when you identify yourself with
[45:33] the
[45:34] word it gives you a
[45:36] foundation it tells you who you are it
[45:40] tells you where you came from and it
[45:43] tells you where you are
[45:45] going when a person has balance in their
[45:48] lives where they know who they are they
[45:51] know where they came from they know who
[45:53] their parents were they know where
[45:55] they're going they 've got goals they've
[45:58] got passions they've got uh a a destiny
[46:02] in their hearts and in their minds on
[46:04] what they want to
[46:07] accomplish they're on a
[46:09] mission they're more
[46:11] positive they're more focused they can
[46:14] see the future they can see that they
[46:17] have a
[46:18] future but let me tell you in a world
[46:21] like today where the world is complete
[46:24] in total chaos where Wars are breaking
[46:26] breaking out and things are at the worst
[46:29] that they've ever been they are worse
[46:32] they are worse today than they were last
[46:35] Sunday all you need to do is look to see
[46:39] what's going on with God's time piece
[46:41] which is
[46:43] Israel Israel is God's time piece you
[46:47] can go back and study the history of
[46:49] Israel you will see that it lines up
[46:52] with many different world
[46:55] events everything surr founded Israel
[46:58] the World War II the World War I the
[47:01] World War II 1948 when Israel became a
[47:05] nation taking back its Land showing that
[47:08] God was restoring his
[47:11] people we know that it's a terrible
[47:13] thing to see what's going on to see
[47:15] these wars and the numbers of people
[47:17] that are being destroyed and killed but
[47:20] yet we cannot deny the word of God and
[47:23] the prophecy of God's word god has
[47:27] identified that Israel are his chosen
[47:30] people it was them that he gave the land
[47:33] to regardless of what anybody else says
[47:37] you cannot change the word of God don't
[47:41] argue with
[47:43] me you need to search the scripture and
[47:47] you need to see what the word of God
[47:50] says about Israel and about all of the
[47:53] other nations that surround it amen we
[47:57] cannot change God's
[48:00] plan amen glory to
[48:06] God some of the uh identities that we
[48:08] can draw from the Bible because we are
[48:11] today we're going to look at you know
[48:13] finding our identity and solidifying our
[48:17] identity and seeing what the word says
[48:20] about us so that we can have Victorious
[48:24] lives in Christ so that we don't have to
[48:27] get caught up into the identity crisis
[48:31] where we don't know which church we
[48:33] should go
[48:35] to I mean listen this identity crisis
[48:39] it's it's it's really uh affecting all
[48:42] of the churches because there's so many
[48:45] Christian so-called churches out there
[48:48] how do you know which church is the
[48:50] right church because you've got so many
[48:53] different doctrines and teachings on the
[48:56] word of God
[48:57] well if you've been listening to what is
[48:59] ministered from this Pulpit week in and
[49:03] week out we don't bring our own
[49:05] interpret word of God the word of God is
[49:09] of no private interpretation amen it is
[49:13] very important to lay out the foundation
[49:16] that the word is God's
[49:19] interpretation and God interprets his
[49:21] own word individually to individuals and
[49:26] you need to not uh identify yourself as
[49:30] a
[49:32] member you need to identify yourself as
[49:35] a son or a daughter of
[49:38] God that's what the true church is made
[49:42] up of not
[49:45] members the moment you identify under
[49:49] membership then you come under man's
[49:52] doctrines man's
[49:54] teachings and all of a sudden it's what
[49:57] the priest says or what the pastor says
[50:00] or what the bishop says or what the Pope
[50:04] says it is none of those it is what the
[50:08] word says amen and that's why we will
[50:11] always we will always bring you back to
[50:15] the word that is the foundation of your
[50:18] experience and so when we identify from
[50:21] the word we've got some scriptures here
[50:24] that we can identify
[50:26] it says in 1 Corinthians 6:17 that we're
[50:30] identified and Sanctified in Christ
[50:33] we're chosen we're holy we're blameless
[50:38] and we're Beyond reproach based on
[50:41] Ephesians 1 for Colossians
[50:44] 1:22 Justified and righteous according
[50:48] to Romans 3:24 liberated and free
[50:52] according to Galatians 2:4
[50:55] 51 accepted forgiven Ephesians 1:6 and 7
[51:01] we are his possessions Isaiah 43 and we
[51:05] are complete and perfect in Christ amen
[51:10] these are the things that we can these
[51:13] are just a few examples from the
[51:14] scriptures that we can identify
[51:17] ourselves by the word of
[51:19] God when you place the word as your
[51:23] identity it places you into a completely
[51:27] different circumstance now your life is
[51:32] not being controlled by how they want to
[51:35] identify you or how somebody else
[51:39] identifies themselves but it's how the
[51:41] word identifies you and how you identify
[51:45] with the
[51:47] word amen praise God Colossians 2:10
[51:51] we're hidden in Christ Colossians 3:3
[51:54] don't uh uh
[51:58] we're hidden in Christ
[52:00] sorry so what's happening the enemy is
[52:03] stealing our personal
[52:05] identities this is how the devil wants
[52:08] the people of God today he wants to
[52:11] steal your identity if he can steal your
[52:14] identity he can kill your
[52:16] joy the moment that you're not sure of
[52:19] who you are you start to lose the joy of
[52:21] your salvation the Devil comes and you
[52:24] know starts bombarding your mind look at
[52:26] this situ situation look at this that's
[52:28] going on in your life see you call
[52:30] yourself a Christian and this and this
[52:32] situation is in your life those are lies
[52:35] of the enemy he's trying to he's trying
[52:37] to get you to identify with the
[52:39] circumstances instead of identifying
[52:42] with the word and the promises of his
[52:44] word amen the Bible says in John 10:10
[52:48] the thief cometh not but to for to steal
[52:52] and to kill and to
[52:54] destroy amen the devil knows your
[52:57] identity is the key to your Victory he
[53:01] knows that if you can get to a place
[53:03] where you know who you are and you stand
[53:06] on that promise of God's word and you
[53:08] don't move off of that and you
[53:11] regardless of the circumstances you
[53:13] stick to the promises regardless of how
[53:16] long it takes When you pray you wait on
[53:19] God you don't you don't you don't Place
[53:22] time as a a prerequisite to God's
[53:25] promises
[53:27] God is God is eternal amen God he says I
[53:30] knew you before you even came to this
[53:34] earth he knows all that you have need of
[53:37] Amen you can keep to his promised word
[53:40] and you can just stand and know that he
[53:42] is God Amen praise God hallelujah we got
[53:46] so many people these days billions of
[53:49] people identifying themselves with
[53:51] everything except
[53:53] Christ it's a total mess amen they want
[53:57] to put their their their their future
[53:59] into
[54:00] science they want to believe in science
[54:03] they want to believe in in in the
[54:04] teachings of of uh of Darwin that that
[54:08] we evolved from from from some amiba
[54:12] some sort of tadpole and then you know
[54:14] contined to evolve and evolve and evolve
[54:18] if you are a son of God you always were
[54:20] a Son of God Amen there was never a time
[54:23] you were not a son of God you came from
[54:26] God you got to go back to
[54:28] God time is only in this
[54:32] Dimension but when we break out of this
[54:34] Dimension by the rapture we will not be
[54:37] in time anymore we will be exactly who
[54:41] we've always
[54:43] been Hallelujah to identify with Jesus
[54:46] Christ is life and to identify with
[54:49] anything else is death it's as simple as
[54:54] that we want to know our true identity
[54:58] today thank amen praise
[55:02] God and death is what separation from
[55:05] God amen hallelujah oh you can be
[55:08] religious you can claim you know you can
[55:11] claim that you believe Jesus Christ is
[55:13] your savior but your life will reflect
[55:16] exactly what you actually
[55:21] believe when you go to somebody and you
[55:24] tell them about Jesus Christ being God
[55:27] that Jesus Christ is God that he is the
[55:31] word that was from the beginning that he
[55:34] was the self-existent one like we we
[55:36] brought on Wednesday night we got into
[55:38] the godhead and we talked about you need
[55:40] to know who you're worshiping amen if
[55:43] you don't know God how can you possibly
[55:45] worship him you know not what you
[55:48] worship you're worshiping a Doctrine
[55:50] you're worshiping a man-made teaching
[55:52] you need to know him in the power of his
[55:55] resurrection
[55:57] amen glory to God you can't believe God
[56:00] unless God unless the word is revealed
[56:03] to you this is the Paradox this is where
[56:07] we're going to be going now because
[56:09] without the foundation of knowing that
[56:11] listen you can CL oh I want to know God
[56:14] I want to know God if you really want to
[56:15] know God then pay attention today amen
[56:19] because God has a provided way of coming
[56:23] to him of of of approaching in him you
[56:27] must approach him with
[56:30] humility you must approach God and and
[56:33] and say Lord I know
[56:36] nothing I know nothing you need to teach
[56:39] me what I need to
[56:41] know man's Wisdom is foolishness unto
[56:46] God so don't rely on any man's Wisdom
[56:50] relying on the power of his resurrection
[56:53] amen praise God and so today the Lord
[56:56] Lord wants you to know who you really
[56:59] are he wants you to identify yourself as
[57:02] either a son or a daughter not a
[57:07] member not a
[57:09] churchgoer not somebody that shows up to
[57:11] church more than anybody
[57:13] else it's not about how often you come
[57:16] to
[57:17] church it's not about how how how many
[57:20] works you
[57:21] do it's not about how much money you
[57:24] give a lot of people will join these big
[57:28] churches where there's thousands of
[57:30] people so that they can hide in the
[57:33] crowds so that they don't have to
[57:35] identify fully that they serve Jesus
[57:39] Christ as their lord and their
[57:42] savior you need to Bear the reproach for
[57:44] this word amen praise God and that's not
[57:48] easy to
[57:50] do you'll be rejected from your friends
[57:53] from your family because you stand
[57:55] solely on on the word of God but let me
[57:58] tell you as everything is starting to
[58:00] come down all around us and this world
[58:03] is falling apart let me tell you they're
[58:06] watching you they're watching your
[58:09] attitude they're watching how solid and
[58:13] how steady you are with your
[58:15] testimony they're watching to see if
[58:17] you're going to if you're going to
[58:19] submit or bow down to the
[58:23] enemy that's trying to steal your
[58:25] identity
[58:29] but how's it all
[58:30] start how does this relationship with
[58:33] Christ
[58:35] start it starts with the one question
[58:39] that Jesus asked in Matthew chapter 16
[58:44] and verse
[58:45] 15 he said unto them but whom say ye
[58:51] that I
[58:53] am this is the question that that I am
[58:56] posing to each and every individual
[59:01] that's an earshot of this word this
[59:05] morning you need to ask
[59:08] yourself when Jesus asks you the
[59:12] question who do you say that I am do you
[59:16] have the right answer do you really
[59:20] know are you going to put him into a a a
[59:24] teaching of Jehovah Witness where he's a
[59:27] mighty God but not the almighty God are
[59:31] you going to put him into a trinity
[59:33] where he is just the son and then
[59:35] there's another father and then there's
[59:38] another Holy Spirit how are you going to
[59:41] place him are you going to place him as
[59:42] oh he was a a great Master at one time
[59:46] upon the
[59:47] Earth or are you going to say like
[59:51] Peter when Jesus looked to him and said
[59:57] Gabriel whom
[59:59] say that I
[1:00:01] am when he looks at
[1:00:04] you
[1:00:06] individually what is going to be your
[1:00:09] answer is it going to be like Peter's
[1:00:13] answer let's listen to the prophet
[1:00:18] here Peter when he called said Thou Art
[1:00:23] now this is Peter speaking this is from
[1:00:25] Christ the mystery of God revealed 1963
[1:00:28] William Brandon he says Thou Art the
[1:00:31] Christ the son of the Living God now
[1:00:34] watch blessed art thou Simon barjona
[1:00:38] this is Jesus responding back he says
[1:00:41] which means son of Jonah see he knew who
[1:00:46] he
[1:00:47] was and when Jesus asks you that
[1:00:50] question and if it strikes your soul
[1:00:52] this morning it's because he's speaking
[1:00:55] to youen if it's just another sermon oh
[1:00:58] Pastor Danny is just preaching another
[1:01:00] good sermon sounds good no if it's
[1:01:03] striking your soul this morning is
[1:01:06] because he's interested in you amen it's
[1:01:09] because he wants to communicate with you
[1:01:11] he wants to identify himself with you
[1:01:15] we're looking at your true identity this
[1:01:17] morning we're going to go a little
[1:01:19] deeper than you know we've heard all
[1:01:20] these scriptures we've read all these
[1:01:23] scriptures but we want to go a little
[1:01:24] deeper this morning to to see if our
[1:01:27] identity is really with
[1:01:30] Christ and he says here blessed art thou
[1:01:33] Simon bar Jonah blessed art thou for
[1:01:35] Flesh and Blood never revealed this to
[1:01:38] you so it's not something that you were
[1:01:42] taught it's not something that you were
[1:01:44] you know that you learned in school who
[1:01:46] Jesus was because he's asking that
[1:01:50] question it's not some Jesus is making
[1:01:52] it clear no man Flesh and Blood no no
[1:01:56] man can teach you who God really is who
[1:01:59] Jesus Christ really is but he says here
[1:02:03] you never learned it from some
[1:02:06] school but here's you know where a lot
[1:02:08] of people get confused when Jesus says
[1:02:10] but my Father which is in heaven has
[1:02:13] revealed this unto you and right away
[1:02:15] they say see there's the
[1:02:18] Trinity now there's the father who's in
[1:02:20] heaven and Jesus the son who's on Earth
[1:02:23] no the word was made flesh God made
[1:02:28] himself a human vessel that would have
[1:02:31] to go to Calvary to fulfill his word
[1:02:35] amen I'll go one step further to say
[1:02:39] that you when you receive the word of
[1:02:42] God in your life you become
[1:02:47] God manifested in the day that you're
[1:02:51] living by you identifying with the word
[1:02:56] thank you you're starting to reflect the
[1:02:59] word when you were when you say I got
[1:03:02] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:05] Christ in a tank buried in water you are
[1:03:10] actually saying acts
[1:03:13] 238 you are reflecting you are
[1:03:16] manifesting you are materializing the
[1:03:19] word made
[1:03:21] flesh so it's all Elohim the
[1:03:25] self-existent one it's all God
[1:03:29] reflecting himself through each
[1:03:34] attribute that
[1:03:36] manifests on Earth at certain times and
[1:03:39] periods we're going to look deeper into
[1:03:40] that but just going to throw that in
[1:03:43] there so Jesus Christ was God the word
[1:03:48] Emmanuel means god with
[1:03:50] us and when he said the father hath
[1:03:53] revealed it he's talking that I have
[1:03:55] revealed this by
[1:03:58] the
[1:04:00] self-existent almighty spirit of God my
[1:04:05] thoughts can be expressed into your
[1:04:08] thoughts amen and I can reveal myself
[1:04:10] directly to
[1:04:13] you that's why he said Thou Art the
[1:04:16] Christ the the anointed one the Messiah
[1:04:20] the Messiah of the Old Testament was
[1:04:24] Isaiah that said on unto us a son is
[1:04:27] given his name shall be counselor the
[1:04:30] Prince of Peace the Everlasting father
[1:04:34] so if Jesus is the Everlasting father
[1:04:37] then why can't he be almighty God he is
[1:04:42] almighty
[1:04:44] God so here now he's saying my father so
[1:04:48] I have revealed this to you notice what
[1:04:51] he said to him Upon This Rock okay
[1:04:55] that's Peter the predestinated seed
[1:04:58] Peter the word Peter means Rock but it's
[1:05:01] not upon
[1:05:02] Peter that he's going to build the
[1:05:05] church it's upon the way he communicated
[1:05:08] who he was to the individual that's how
[1:05:12] he's building and identifying his
[1:05:16] church and so he says here Upon This
[1:05:19] Rock that's Peter the predestinated seat
[1:05:21] of God that had received his light and
[1:05:25] and given the keys to the
[1:05:27] kingdom Peter's given the
[1:05:31] Revelation so that he can live the
[1:05:35] Revelation and he says Upon This Rock of
[1:05:38] revelation of who Jesus Christ
[1:05:43] is it's Revelation in other words it's
[1:05:46] God's
[1:05:47] thought
[1:05:49] being delivered into your mind of who he
[1:05:54] is simp simple as that and then all of a
[1:05:57] sudden you see it as clear as a bell and
[1:06:00] now you're no longer confused about
[1:06:02] Trinity you're no longer confused about
[1:06:05] Mighty Almighty you're no longer
[1:06:07] confused about a great master or a
[1:06:10] Buddha or a whatever other te no you've
[1:06:13] come into a complete and total clear
[1:06:17] identity of who God
[1:06:20] is and he says now he is the full
[1:06:24] manifested
[1:06:26] God Upon This Rock not a father not a
[1:06:31] son not a Holy Ghost and him being the
[1:06:35] second person Upon This Rock I'll build
[1:06:38] my church he says no upon the Revelation
[1:06:41] and the Gates of Hell will never shake
[1:06:44] it down never Prevail against it see he
[1:06:48] says I'll build my church Upon This Rock
[1:06:51] a revelation of Jesus Christ look Christ
[1:06:56] in you makes him the center of Life of
[1:07:04] Revelation Jesus Christ in you makes him
[1:07:10] the center of life of the Revelation so
[1:07:14] in other words when Christ is in you you
[1:07:17] start to manifest the word you can't
[1:07:21] help it when somebody says how you were
[1:07:23] baptized you go right to the word Act
[1:07:26] 238 repent and be baptized in the name
[1:07:29] of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:07:31] remission of sins you shall receive the
[1:07:34] gift of the spirit of God the Holy Ghost
[1:07:38] and if that same spirit that raised
[1:07:40] Christ from the dead dwell in you it'll
[1:07:42] Quicken you it'll translate you out of
[1:07:45] this Dimension and you will be
[1:07:47] identified with the
[1:07:51] Rapture see Christ's life in you makes
[1:07:54] him the center of the Revelation Christ
[1:07:57] in the Bible makes the Bible the
[1:08:00] complete revelation of
[1:08:03] Christ everything you read from Genesis
[1:08:07] all the way to the last chapter of the
[1:08:09] Book of Revelations is talking about
[1:08:13] Jesus
[1:08:15] Christ the Messiah the
[1:08:19] Lord the Mighty God he said beside me
[1:08:23] there is no other sin
[1:08:26] savior there's nobody else that you must
[1:08:30] identify with in this day and in this
[1:08:32] hour if you are going to escape what
[1:08:34] this world is now barreling
[1:08:39] into 10 years ago we weren't
[1:08:43] even like you wouldn't even imagine that
[1:08:46] Israel would be in such a condition like
[1:08:49] like it is right now where every front
[1:08:53] and you pay attention and you listen to
[1:08:55] their
[1:08:57] talk listen to Benjamin Netanyahu listen
[1:09:01] to their previous
[1:09:03] president listen to the way they talk
[1:09:06] they will never bow down they will
[1:09:10] defeat the enemy yes all that they're
[1:09:13] saying is like we as Christians we will
[1:09:16] never bow down to the
[1:09:19] enemy we will never allow him because
[1:09:22] remember Israel is a type of the
[1:09:24] spiritual Church Israel is the natural
[1:09:27] Church the the Gentile church is the
[1:09:30] spiritual church when you see Israel in
[1:09:33] battle you can rest assure that the
[1:09:35] church is truly in battle if you're not
[1:09:38] in battle right now I don't know which
[1:09:40] church you belong
[1:09:43] to it's not easy to stand in this day
[1:09:47] and in this hour on this particular word
[1:09:50] where we stand fully on the word of God
[1:09:52] we do not compromise God's word
[1:09:58] Israel says they will be
[1:10:01] destroyed the enemy will be
[1:10:05] destroyed they will stop the heads
[1:10:07] they're not talking about all those
[1:10:09] innocent men women and children they're
[1:10:11] talking about those those powers and
[1:10:14] principalities and and hierarchies that
[1:10:17] have nothing in mind but the destruction
[1:10:20] of
[1:10:21] Israel and you know what that's the
[1:10:23] Devil he's the same devil that's has
[1:10:27] that that we talked about here in in St
[1:10:29] John 10:10 that has no other plan but to
[1:10:33] destroy to annihilate and to wipe out
[1:10:36] the Sons and Daughters of God you are
[1:10:40] the enemy's
[1:10:41] Target but greater is he that is in you
[1:10:44] you see the moment that you've
[1:10:46] identified with
[1:10:48] Christ it's no longer you that has to
[1:10:51] fight the
[1:10:53] battle you yeah you're you're dealing
[1:10:56] with the circumstances yes all those
[1:10:58] things that are going on I'm dealing
[1:11:00] with stuff you're dealing with stuff I'm
[1:11:02] talking serious stuff that we've got to
[1:11:04] deal with in this life but greater is he
[1:11:08] we know that he started a work in in our
[1:11:11] lives he's going to finish that
[1:11:13] work if you believe this word you will
[1:11:16] not you will not look to the left you'll
[1:11:18] not look to the right you'll just
[1:11:22] stand Christ in you made makes you the
[1:11:26] complete listen what he says here Christ
[1:11:29] in you makes you the complete revelation
[1:11:33] of the whole thing see you see what God
[1:11:36] is trying to
[1:11:39] do we're talking about your true
[1:11:42] identity this morning it's a simple
[1:11:44] message but I want it to go deep I want
[1:11:48] you to think I want you to think about
[1:11:50] your experience I want you to think
[1:11:52] about you know those that are out there
[1:11:53] online that are that are attending
[1:11:55] church every Sunday and you know just
[1:11:58] doing it out of tradition I want you to
[1:12:00] look a little deeper because things are
[1:12:02] starting to come down situations are
[1:12:05] starting to happen on on the world scene
[1:12:08] and you need to be prepared for what's
[1:12:10] coming and if you're not sealed in
[1:12:12] Christ if you're not identified with
[1:12:15] Christ then something other than a
[1:12:18] Rapture is going to take place in your
[1:12:20] life it's going to be a Great
[1:12:23] Tribulation it's going to be worse than
[1:12:25] it's ever been Jesus said worse than
[1:12:28] it's ever
[1:12:31] been
[1:12:34] Hallelujah let's read the next
[1:12:37] scripture Ephesians 2:1
[1:12:41] 19-22 listen here these are the this is
[1:12:44] how we identify you are therefore you
[1:12:47] are no more strangers and foreigners but
[1:12:50] your fellow
[1:12:51] citizens with the Saints and of the
[1:12:54] household of God this is who you
[1:12:57] identify with and are built upon the
[1:13:02] foundation of the Apostles and the
[1:13:05] prophets Jesus Christ himself being the
[1:13:09] Chief
[1:13:11] Cornerstone this word the Old Testament
[1:13:14] every chapter every book every
[1:13:18] line is the
[1:13:21] foundation of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:13:26] the fullness of the body of
[1:13:28] Christ and we are members of that body
[1:13:32] in whom all the building fitly framed
[1:13:36] together groweth unto an Holy Temple in
[1:13:40] the
[1:13:40] Lord in whom ye also are builded
[1:13:45] together for an habitation of God
[1:13:48] through the
[1:13:50] spirit so when you receive this word
[1:13:55] when all of a sudden you go deep you
[1:13:57] answer that question where he says who
[1:13:59] do you say that I am you start a
[1:14:03] journey you start a journey of getting
[1:14:06] to know who you are and getting to
[1:14:09] really know who he is go to the next
[1:14:14] scripture and hath put now listen when
[1:14:17] you're into that body and you know who
[1:14:20] you
[1:14:21] are you need to understand that and have
[1:14:25] put all things under his feet he's
[1:14:27] talking about Christ and gave him to be
[1:14:29] the head over all things to the church
[1:14:33] which is his body the fullness of him
[1:14:36] that filth all in
[1:14:40] all the body of Christ filth all in all
[1:14:46] everything that is against the word are
[1:14:51] under his feet and if you are in the
[1:14:54] body they're under your
[1:14:56] feet you become identified with Christ
[1:15:01] listen here he says
[1:15:04] now in Christ The Mystery of God uh
[1:15:06] revealed now notice god making himself
[1:15:11] known not we're not supposed to make
[1:15:14] converts to Christianity by a government
[1:15:17] but by Revelation if you're coming into
[1:15:20] the body of Christ if you're going to
[1:15:22] identify yourself with Christ you can
[1:15:25] only identify by Revelation not
[1:15:28] membership remember that this is not
[1:15:30] about joining Good Neighbor Ministries
[1:15:32] every church is going to have three
[1:15:34] kinds of Believers in it every Church
[1:15:37] there'll be a make believer there'll be
[1:15:40] an unbeliever and there'll be a True
[1:15:42] Believer in every church but if you're
[1:15:46] going to be coming in and being in a
[1:15:48] True Believer it's only going to be by
[1:15:50] Revelation no other
[1:15:52] way the Christ in you
[1:15:56] you as God was in Christ as God was in
[1:16:00] Christ Christ in you when what God did
[1:16:05] in
[1:16:06] Christ Christ does in
[1:16:10] you let me repeat
[1:16:13] that as God was in Christ Christ in you
[1:16:17] what God did in Christ Christ does in
[1:16:21] you what signs did God in Christ Christ
[1:16:24] Christ does in
[1:16:27] you oh it's it's that beautiful oh my I
[1:16:31] like that Jesus said at that day that's
[1:16:35] this
[1:16:37] day at that day when this Revelation is
[1:16:40] made known you will know that I am in
[1:16:42] the father and the father in me and I in
[1:16:46] you and you in
[1:16:48] me when the Revelation is made manifest
[1:16:51] at that day ye shall know that I
[1:17:01] sorry I had a thing come up on my fer
[1:17:03] and it covered when this Revelation is
[1:17:05] made known you will know that I am in
[1:17:07] the father and the father in me I in you
[1:17:10] and you and me when the Revelation is
[1:17:13] made manifest at that day ye shall know
[1:17:16] that I and the father are
[1:17:19] one I am in the father and the father is
[1:17:24] in me me he's making it very clear here
[1:17:28] then when the re when the Revelation
[1:17:30] comes forth then then it's I in you and
[1:17:34] you in me there you are amen Ephesians
[1:17:40] chapter 1 22 to 23 he's put all
[1:17:46] things now listen see continuing now you
[1:17:50] see down Through the Ages we started off
[1:17:53] from the foundation from the the first
[1:17:55] church age when the seed went in the
[1:17:57] ground the complete seed then it come
[1:18:00] out through the feet Luther come back
[1:18:04] out then through Wesley then into the
[1:18:06] Pentecostals the tongues in the lips see
[1:18:09] now it's in the eyes the prophetic of
[1:18:11] Malachi 4 okay and you need to
[1:18:14] understand Malachi 4 was a prophet to
[1:18:17] the 20th century William Branham that's
[1:18:20] why we quote from William Branham that's
[1:18:23] why people quote from Martin Luther
[1:18:25] that's why people quote from John Wesley
[1:18:27] that's why they quote from Wigglesworth
[1:18:30] that's why they quote from all kinds of
[1:18:32] different reformers well William
[1:18:35] brandham was the last reformer in the
[1:18:38] form of a prophet that restored the
[1:18:41] fullness of the word of God Amen he
[1:18:43] fulfilled Malachi 4 and so forth and now
[1:18:46] there's nothing else left for it to come
[1:18:49] but himself to step into that because
[1:18:52] that's the last thing there is the next
[1:18:55] is the intelligence and we have no
[1:18:57] intelligence of our own it's his we have
[1:19:01] no sight of our own how can a man
[1:19:04] foresee those things he can't do it it's
[1:19:08] God himself see it's becoming to a place
[1:19:13] and he's governed the body all the way
[1:19:16] through than the complete body of Christ
[1:19:19] is revealed in the form of a
[1:19:23] bride that was taken out of his side
[1:19:26] like Adam did at the beginning like Adam
[1:19:29] was rather at the beginning and so the
[1:19:33] church that is
[1:19:35] identifying herself with
[1:19:38] Christ is a church that is the word
[1:19:43] church she cannot identify with the way
[1:19:47] the world is identifying
[1:19:51] Christianity she identifies by the word
[1:19:54] of God she will not let the teachings of
[1:19:59] this world and the and the doctrines of
[1:20:02] man identify her with the word of God
[1:20:05] she can only identify with the groom
[1:20:10] which is Jesus
[1:20:11] Christ the groom and the bride amen
[1:20:15] praise
[1:20:18] God 1
[1:20:20] Corinthians
[1:20:22] 12:27 now you are are the body of Christ
[1:20:26] and members in
[1:20:28] particular every single one of you once
[1:20:31] you identify yourself with the word of
[1:20:35] God you come to realize that you have a
[1:20:38] place in the body you have a position in
[1:20:42] the body you're not just a church member
[1:20:45] you're an active living walking
[1:20:50] Messiah you're a walking Christ you're
[1:20:54] anointed Ed by the word of God you're
[1:20:56] not living a normal life anymore you're
[1:20:59] living a life that's
[1:21:02] Supernatural all the things around you
[1:21:05] though they they appear natural but
[1:21:07] there's a supernatural element that's
[1:21:10] walking with you that's moving around
[1:21:12] your life that's taking you deeper into
[1:21:15] the word of God that's causing you to go
[1:21:18] deeper into Christ when you look at the
[1:21:20] conditions of the world it causes you to
[1:21:22] go deeper to really know that you know
[1:21:25] that you
[1:21:26] know amen that you truly can identify
[1:21:30] yourself as a son or a daughter of God
[1:21:35] not just identifying yourself as a
[1:21:39] church
[1:21:41] member amen praise God listen here
[1:21:45] brother Bram speaking in the choosing of
[1:21:47] a
[1:21:48] bride the other is pregnated by the word
[1:21:51] of
[1:21:53] God and will bring forth the body now
[1:21:57] he's talking about the church we're
[1:22:00] talking about here when you answered
[1:22:02] that
[1:22:03] question and you said Thou Art the
[1:22:07] Christ you know now who he is you know
[1:22:10] now who you are you actually received
[1:22:14] his
[1:22:15] word and you were pregnated by his word
[1:22:19] that's why many Christians at the end
[1:22:20] are going to come and say Lord Lord uh
[1:22:23] did I not cast out devils in your name
[1:22:25] that I not uh do these things lay hands
[1:22:28] on the sick Jesus is going to turn
[1:22:30] around and say I never knew
[1:22:33] you that's scripture what does he mean
[1:22:36] by that they never received his word
[1:22:40] they never answered that question they
[1:22:43] weren't willing to accept his word into
[1:22:46] their hearts and therefore by being
[1:22:49] accepting that word you are birthed into
[1:22:52] the mystical Body of Christ
[1:22:55] you experience a new birth you
[1:22:56] experience a new life Everything Changes
[1:23:00] you're you're no longer the same people
[1:23:02] look at you and say what's come over you
[1:23:04] it's because you've accepted the word
[1:23:07] and you're now living a life that's
[1:23:09] that's that's overtaken you it's the
[1:23:12] Life of Christ the word of God so watch
[1:23:14] he says the other is pregnated by the
[1:23:17] word of God and will bring forth the
[1:23:20] body the finished body of Jesus Christ
[1:23:23] which is the bride
[1:23:25] the bride is the only church that goes
[1:23:28] in the
[1:23:30] Rapture because it is the body of
[1:23:32] Christ we are making up that
[1:23:36] body the body of Christ isn't finished
[1:23:39] yet how many knows that a man in a woman
[1:23:43] is one and Christ is one body the word
[1:23:47] the bride will have to be the rest of
[1:23:50] that
[1:23:52] body like Adam in the Garden of Eden Eve
[1:23:56] was taken from his side Adam was in the
[1:24:01] image of God he was God on
[1:24:06] Earth and God wanted to express himself
[1:24:10] as a family so everything that he had in
[1:24:13] his mind he was expressing it through
[1:24:15] Adam and when he took Eve from his womb
[1:24:19] that's why she's called womb man she
[1:24:22] came from the womb of the man
[1:24:24] it was God's
[1:24:27] female attributes being
[1:24:30] expressed into a separate vessel so that
[1:24:33] he could express family
[1:24:37] fellowship well he's doing that now
[1:24:41] remember everything is being restored
[1:24:44] back to that in order for the Rapture to
[1:24:48] be
[1:24:49] fulfilled and so like Adam and the two
[1:24:53] together
[1:24:54] makes the one body again so as you
[1:24:58] accept the
[1:24:59] word receive the word come into the
[1:25:03] church which is the body of Christ you
[1:25:07] become one with Christ and you become
[1:25:11] the church that goes in the Rapture it's
[1:25:15] simple but you need to go deep into your
[1:25:17] thoughts and into your experience and
[1:25:20] into your
[1:25:21] identity amen so like Adam was at the
[1:25:25] beginning man his wife are one now she
[1:25:29] the true
[1:25:31] bride Soul sold out to him is not going
[1:25:35] to identify with the way the world wants
[1:25:39] you to identify Christianity
[1:25:42] Trinity all these different doctrines
[1:25:44] and you've got all these different
[1:25:46] denominations that's why the true church
[1:25:49] the bride of Christ will only look at
[1:25:52] the word she'll only look at her
[1:25:55] experience to see if it lines up with
[1:25:57] the word if baptism is in jesus' name
[1:26:01] and somebody says how are you baptized I
[1:26:03] was baptized in Jesus name according to
[1:26:05] the word because the word can never go
[1:26:08] against
[1:26:10] itself Jesus said I'll send you the
[1:26:12] comforter which is the Holy Ghost which
[1:26:15] is his Spirit that's why he says on that
[1:26:18] day you shall know that I am in the
[1:26:19] father ye in me and I in you that Spirit
[1:26:23] In You it'll only identify with the
[1:26:26] word and so your baptism will be
[1:26:29] identical to the word oh no but I got
[1:26:31] baptized as a baby it's not in the word
[1:26:34] a baby doesn't believe a baby can't
[1:26:38] believe it's he that believeth and is
[1:26:41] baptized you see now you're in the body
[1:26:45] now you're identifying yourself you're
[1:26:47] you're your true identity now is with
[1:26:50] Christ it's with the body it's
[1:26:53] identifying with the word word and the
[1:26:55] word says in this day and in this hour
[1:26:57] there's going to be a Rapture to take
[1:27:00] the church out of the Great
[1:27:02] Tribulation everything else goes into
[1:27:04] tribulation for
[1:27:06] purging that's what salvation is all
[1:27:10] about salvation you talk about salvation
[1:27:12] that people want to know what what is
[1:27:14] salvation Salvation is is to be
[1:27:17] delivered from
[1:27:19] Death from what's coming on this Earth
[1:27:23] Hallelujah
[1:27:24] so she Soul sold out to him and she she
[1:27:29] used no mind of her
[1:27:31] own his mind of course is his will and
[1:27:36] his will is his
[1:27:39] word
[1:27:41] amen
[1:27:44] hallelujah Ephesians 5:29 go to the next
[1:27:47] scripture says for no man ever yet hated
[1:27:51] his own flesh but Nour isth and
[1:27:55] cherisheth it even as the Lord the
[1:27:59] church do you think for one moment God
[1:28:02] is not going to give you everything that
[1:28:04] you have need of in order to
[1:28:07] overcome whatever you're facing right
[1:28:10] now God he does not hate his body he
[1:28:14] loves and nourishes his body that's why
[1:28:17] you need to be in that body that's why
[1:28:20] you need to identify with the right
[1:28:22] Jesus there's there's a lot of jesuses
[1:28:25] out there that they're identifying him
[1:28:27] and and they're and they're placing him
[1:28:29] but they're not placing him right
[1:28:31] exactly where he's supposed to be God
[1:28:34] Almighty the word from the beginning was
[1:28:37] the word the word was with God the Word
[1:28:39] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:28:42] dwelt Among Us amen
[1:28:45] hallelujah and that same Spirit came
[1:28:47] back down on Pentecost which is Christ
[1:28:51] himself coming back into his church and
[1:28:53] then God sent us a prophet and then God
[1:28:57] s uh goes off takes his Prophet off the
[1:29:00] scene so that Christ himself in
[1:29:02] 1963 could come down to Sunset Mountain
[1:29:05] to say that he is now here to to to to
[1:29:09] meet with his body amen glory to God
[1:29:13] this is what we're all this is what
[1:29:14] we're talking about this is the
[1:29:16] Revelation that we are under this is
[1:29:19] what called us to this to this church to
[1:29:22] this body of Christ is because God has
[1:29:24] done something in our day and we've
[1:29:26] recognized what he's done it's when you
[1:29:29] can that's why our sign says come
[1:29:32] recognize your day and its
[1:29:37] message Christ is alive right now he's
[1:29:41] moving right now amen even as the Lord
[1:29:44] the church for we are members of his
[1:29:47] body of his flesh and of his bones
[1:29:51] listen if Jesus is on the Earth right
[1:29:53] now he's in you amen that's what the
[1:29:55] scripture says he's walking in you amen
[1:29:59] your bone of his bone your flesh of his
[1:30:01] flesh amen and the blood is the holy
[1:30:04] ghost that is in you that is that's what
[1:30:07] identifies us together that's why I can
[1:30:10] call you brother and sister in Christ
[1:30:13] because the same blood that operates
[1:30:15] through your body operates through mine
[1:30:18] what is that blood it's the blood of
[1:30:20] Jesus it's the spirit of the Living God
[1:30:22] Amen if the Same Spirit spirit that
[1:30:24] raised Christ from the dead dwells in
[1:30:27] you it'll Quicken your mortal body
[1:30:32] Hallelujah glory to God Amen listen to
[1:30:34] brother brandom here the invisible Union
[1:30:37] but you remember when it went down and
[1:30:41] the grain begin to ripen that you find
[1:30:43] before that grain can ripen everything
[1:30:46] in that stock has to be dead listen
[1:30:49] we're living in a day where everything
[1:30:52] that seed is coming to a ripening time
[1:30:56] it'll only be the pure unadulterated
[1:30:59] seed word of God that is going to go in
[1:31:02] the
[1:31:03] Rapture remember if you are a son or a
[1:31:06] daughter of God you always
[1:31:09] were everything else around it all these
[1:31:12] all these Church ages all the churches
[1:31:16] through every
[1:31:17] age it was carrying the seed and in
[1:31:21] every Church age whoever was identified
[1:31:25] as the seed in that age just like when
[1:31:27] when Luther broke away from the Catholic
[1:31:29] church he was identified as the seed of
[1:31:33] justification he came out and he says
[1:31:35] wait a minute here the just shall live
[1:31:38] by Revelation he caught that Revelation
[1:31:41] he answered that question like you
[1:31:43] answered when he says who do you say
[1:31:46] that I am you see all of a sudden Luther
[1:31:48] realized that wait a minute it's not the
[1:31:50] way the priest is telling me I need my
[1:31:54] own experience with God and anybody that
[1:31:57] broke away with Martin Luther at that
[1:31:59] day they were the bride of Christ that
[1:32:02] had recognized their day and the message
[1:32:05] that God was bringing down as a part of
[1:32:07] the
[1:32:08] Reformation every age amen so what's
[1:32:12] happening now is that this church that
[1:32:15] we're talking about here that we
[1:32:17] identify our true
[1:32:19] identity is is is a a ripened matured
[1:32:23] body body seed word of
[1:32:27] God remember there was certain seed that
[1:32:29] fell by
[1:32:30] the street side and some got scorched by
[1:32:33] the by the world some got but then there
[1:32:36] was some good seed that good seed has
[1:32:39] continued that good seed is the word of
[1:32:43] God and that seed was in you before you
[1:32:46] came here and when the question was
[1:32:49] given to you who do you say that I am
[1:32:51] right away you looked and you had the
[1:32:53] answer you didn't realize that there was
[1:32:55] an attribute in you that had the ability
[1:32:58] to respond to that question and
[1:33:01] immediately you identified and you
[1:33:03] realized wait a minute this is who I
[1:33:06] really am this is who I'm supposed to be
[1:33:10] that's why when I was all messed up on
[1:33:12] drugs and and my life was a complete
[1:33:14] mess it like just like any seed the
[1:33:17] seeds got to be in the dirt and
[1:33:20] sometimes it's so surrounded by so much
[1:33:21] dirt that you don't see that there's
[1:33:23] actually a life in that dirt but the
[1:33:26] moment that the spirit of God called on
[1:33:29] that seed that seed had to come to life
[1:33:34] it had no
[1:33:35] choice listen anybody that's hearing
[1:33:38] this word this morning it could be all
[1:33:40] kind of scattered all over the place but
[1:33:42] if you're hearing something this morning
[1:33:44] you're hearing the voice of God calling
[1:33:47] you to the attention of his word in this
[1:33:49] day and in this hour something starts to
[1:33:52] pull on your heart you can't explain it
[1:33:55] but you just all of a sudden now you
[1:33:57] want to search the scriptures you're
[1:34:00] looking deeper into the word of God
[1:34:02] because something is calling you to to
[1:34:04] to something more something is
[1:34:07] delivering you all of a sudden the
[1:34:09] circumstances around my life I didn't
[1:34:12] understand it but I was coming to church
[1:34:13] with Gabriel i' go into the church I
[1:34:16] listen to the word of God and I couldn't
[1:34:18] understand it but something was pulling
[1:34:20] me out of that old life out of my own
[1:34:24] thinking of who God was and God was
[1:34:27] interpreting it for himself amen he was
[1:34:30] now calling his seed he was now placing
[1:34:34] it into the body of Christ and all of
[1:34:37] that seed is going into the burn
[1:34:39] remember we're at the end time
[1:34:42] Harvest but there's not too many workers
[1:34:45] out there that are preaching this
[1:34:47] word they want to preach a nice Jesus
[1:34:51] Loves You Jesus is there for for you I'm
[1:34:54] telling you all those same things but in
[1:34:57] such a way where you can know Jesus is
[1:35:02] with me Jesus is a
[1:35:05] reality Jesus is the word I I haven't
[1:35:09] bowed to a teaching of man I haven't I
[1:35:11] haven't compromised to identify myself
[1:35:14] with this gender or that gender I've
[1:35:16] identified myself with the word amen
[1:35:19] with the
[1:35:20] word this is what's going to take me
[1:35:23] this is what's going to restore me this
[1:35:25] is what's going to heal me this is what
[1:35:27] will take you out of your problems and
[1:35:29] your situations and the circumstances
[1:35:31] that you're dealing with right now it's
[1:35:34] him so here now he's talking about this
[1:35:37] seed everything in that stock had to be
[1:35:40] dead Hallelujah can't you see where
[1:35:43] we're standing life is in the grain
[1:35:46] again it's back what is it just exactly
[1:35:50] like the same grain that went in the
[1:35:52] ground
[1:35:54] the same Jesus in The Bride form same
[1:35:59] power same church same thing same
[1:36:05] word the same word sucked up through
[1:36:08] these and come out here he's talking
[1:36:11] about the same word that come through
[1:36:13] that stock all through the Reformation
[1:36:16] ages how the life just kept moving
[1:36:19] through the stock how everything else
[1:36:21] had to fall away every every seed that
[1:36:24] was of God it that's why the church
[1:36:27] would keep putting the spirit out but
[1:36:30] the spirit would move on and go on to
[1:36:32] the next predestinated seed and that's
[1:36:35] why we're in the day that we are today
[1:36:38] and this is where it all finishes up the
[1:36:42] grain goes into the barn which is a type
[1:36:44] of the Rapture and everything else gets
[1:36:47] bound together for the Great
[1:36:51] Tribulation and it's going to be a fiery
[1:36:55] ugly
[1:36:58] tribulation those people that are in the
[1:37:01] Middle East that are seeing those bombs
[1:37:04] land in their backyard and seeing the
[1:37:08] destruction that's going on they they
[1:37:10] they couldn't have
[1:37:11] imagined that they'd be seeing those
[1:37:13] things but they
[1:37:15] are those people in the Ukraine that are
[1:37:18] experiencing thousands of people dying
[1:37:21] being blown up all the these bombs
[1:37:24] falling around them they would have
[1:37:25] never thought but it's happening Saints
[1:37:27] it's happening we're blessed to be here
[1:37:30] in Canada we're blessed to be in North
[1:37:33] America where there is no war we're
[1:37:36] blessed to be here right now but the
[1:37:39] scripture doesn't keep it this way
[1:37:42] unfortunately the whole world is going
[1:37:44] to go into World War
[1:37:46] I when God's his own interpreter I'm not
[1:37:51] going to put a time a date but if I was
[1:37:54] to look around and see some of the
[1:37:56] circumstances that are going on around
[1:37:58] us I would say you better look up and
[1:38:01] you better make sure you know who you're
[1:38:03] identifying with because whatever you
[1:38:06] identify with that's where you will
[1:38:08] stand on that
[1:38:10] day he says just exactly like the same
[1:38:13] grain the same word and all that life
[1:38:17] that come through here picked up its
[1:38:19] people now it's forming up into a head
[1:38:24] for the
[1:38:25] Rapture now it's coming together it's
[1:38:29] forming up into ahead for the
[1:38:34] Rapture praise God forever
[1:38:38] more as we wind this
[1:38:40] down 2 Corinthians 5:17 to19 it says
[1:38:45] therefore If any man be in Christ he's a
[1:38:48] new
[1:38:50] creature I want you to know that you
[1:38:54] can
[1:38:55] change and your life can be transformed
[1:38:59] into a new that that word creature is
[1:39:02] creation your whole life can be
[1:39:04] transformed by the word of God old
[1:39:07] things are passed away behold all things
[1:39:12] are become new and all things are of God
[1:39:15] who hath reconciled us to himself by
[1:39:19] Jesus
[1:39:20] Christ it's Jesus that's that's calling
[1:39:23] you that's reconcilia you that's that's
[1:39:26] bringing you back into into your your
[1:39:30] rightful position so that you can
[1:39:32] identify yourself in this day with the
[1:39:35] word of God and hath given to us the
[1:39:37] ministry of
[1:39:39] reconciliation not only are you
[1:39:41] reconciliated into the body but he's
[1:39:43] given you the same work that as you go
[1:39:47] out there and live this word and testify
[1:39:49] and and tell people about Jesus Christ
[1:39:52] and what he's done for you you start to
[1:39:55] just like when Gabriel handed me that
[1:39:57] tape he didn't realize he was under the
[1:39:59] ministry of
[1:40:00] reconciliation just like when you
[1:40:02] testified to whoever you testify to and
[1:40:05] they're serving the lord today is
[1:40:07] because you were under that Ministry of
[1:40:10] reconciliation you become the body of
[1:40:12] Christ you become the living mystical
[1:40:16] body of Jesus Christ in the midst of the
[1:40:19] people and when Christ was on the earth
[1:40:23] not not everybody was responding to him
[1:40:27] but he went to those he says come follow
[1:40:29] me and the ones that he spoke to that
[1:40:32] were his sheep recognized his
[1:40:35] voice and they had to respond thank you
[1:40:39] Lord hallelujah so he's given it to wit
[1:40:42] that God was in Christ reconciling the
[1:40:45] world unto
[1:40:48] himself not imputing their trespasses
[1:40:51] unto them and hath committed unto us the
[1:40:54] word of reconciliation in other words
[1:40:56] when he called you into this body he
[1:41:00] Sanctified you he justified you he wiped
[1:41:05] away all your
[1:41:07] unbelief if you're hearing this message
[1:41:09] this morning and you you you haven't
[1:41:11] fully identified yet with Christ I want
[1:41:14] you to know that if you identify with
[1:41:16] Christ if you're able to respond to this
[1:41:19] word and and identify yourself with this
[1:41:22] message you come in you get Justified as
[1:41:25] though your old life never happened in
[1:41:27] the first
[1:41:29] place that's the mystical a supernatural
[1:41:33] God that we serve he had to make a way
[1:41:36] for you to be a perfect bride without
[1:41:40] spot or wrinkle how's he going to have a
[1:41:42] bride without spot or
[1:41:43] wrinkle you see that's why you you look
[1:41:46] at you know you look at what you did
[1:41:48] last week you know you made mistakes you
[1:41:50] know you sin you know you lied you know
[1:41:52] you cheated you know you did certain
[1:41:54] things but Christ knew that and when he
[1:41:58] looked at you he was not looking at your
[1:42:02] sin he was not looking at your unbelief
[1:42:05] all the traps that the enemy set up for
[1:42:08] this flesh he was looking at himself the
[1:42:11] attribute the portion of himself that he
[1:42:14] placed in you that's why when Adam
[1:42:18] looked at Eve he knew that she had
[1:42:21] sinned he knew that that that she blew
[1:42:25] it so he knew that the only way that he
[1:42:28] could save her was to give his own life
[1:42:31] Adam knew exactly what he was doing when
[1:42:34] he went with his wife and partook of the
[1:42:38] unbelief but it was also that God could
[1:42:41] fulfill his plan of showing that Jesus
[1:42:45] Christ was going to come to th 4,000
[1:42:48] years later to take on a human body
[1:42:52] because his Church Eve the body the C
[1:42:55] the the the the the Church of this day
[1:42:57] the Gentile Church of this day would be
[1:43:00] deceived you know that all would be
[1:43:03] deceived all a l l except those whose
[1:43:08] names were written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:43:11] Life every churchgoer out there unless
[1:43:14] their name is in the Book of Life
[1:43:17] they're in
[1:43:17] deception it's I'm sorry it's the word
[1:43:21] it said all would be deceived except
[1:43:24] those whose names were written in the
[1:43:25] Lamb's Book of Life you got to read the
[1:43:28] word you got to study the word and
[1:43:30] that's why if you're going to identify
[1:43:32] with the word then you need to know the
[1:43:34] word so you can properly identify where
[1:43:37] you
[1:43:38] stand amen and so Jesus Christ knew that
[1:43:44] he had to go to Calvary he knew that
[1:43:47] he'd have to die for your unbelief in
[1:43:49] 2024
[1:43:53] he doesn't see listen if you've been
[1:43:55] called into this body I don't care how
[1:43:58] much unbelief was on this flesh he
[1:44:01] doesn't see it
[1:44:03] anymore and when you come to understand
[1:44:06] that and you you enter into that kind of
[1:44:08] a relationship with Jesus Christ you
[1:44:11] want to love him and you want to serve
[1:44:13] him with all that's in you because of
[1:44:15] that Mercy that he extended to
[1:44:17] you you want to give him your life you
[1:44:20] want to serve you want to obey the word
[1:44:22] you can't wait to get to that water and
[1:44:24] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:44:27] for the remission of your sins because
[1:44:28] when you get buried as an adult knowing
[1:44:31] that you that you sined that you were
[1:44:34] wrong that you made those mistakes
[1:44:36] you're confessing you're re that's what
[1:44:38] the word repent means to turn away from
[1:44:42] what you knew was wrong and bury
[1:44:45] it bury it so that you can come up brand
[1:44:49] new start a brand new
[1:44:52] life have a Victorious walk with God
[1:44:55] know that regardless of what takes place
[1:44:58] on this Earth regardless of what you see
[1:45:00] on CNN regardless of the outcome of the
[1:45:03] US elections regardless of the chaos
[1:45:06] that's going on in Israel regardless of
[1:45:09] what's taking place in the Ukraine
[1:45:11] regardless of the government of Canada
[1:45:13] and all the doors that they're opening
[1:45:15] up to same J samex genders and all these
[1:45:19] different Abominations of the word of
[1:45:22] God regardless of all of those things
[1:45:24] you're sitting in the body of
[1:45:27] Christ
[1:45:34] Justified you've identified with your
[1:45:37] true identity let the musicians
[1:45:41] come
[1:45:43] Hallelujah now if we are those
[1:45:46] attributes and things that are to be
[1:45:49] 1965 if we are those true attributes of
[1:45:52] God we cannot live by Creeds we cannot
[1:45:56] live by denom denominal
[1:46:01] denominationalism we must live by the
[1:46:04] word because the bride is part of the
[1:46:08] bridegroom like any wife is a part of
[1:46:12] her husband therefore we must be that
[1:46:15] word bride and what is the word bride
[1:46:18] the manifestation of this
[1:46:21] hour the the the church the bride not a
[1:46:26] Creed not a
[1:46:28] denomination but a living Oracle of God
[1:46:32] remember God has given us the
[1:46:35] ministry of
[1:46:38] reconciliation people need to hear this
[1:46:42] word Jesus Cho chose the foolishness of
[1:46:46] preaching so that the foolishness of
[1:46:49] preaching could be could be uh sent
[1:46:51] forth and the word could go forth in
[1:46:54] this day and in this hour that's why
[1:46:56] it's so important that we understand
[1:46:58] that it's not just pressing play and
[1:47:00] listening to the tapes yes that is the
[1:47:03] word that is God's Prophet that is word
[1:47:07] that that's being fulfilled and God can
[1:47:09] speak to you through all of that but
[1:47:11] that
[1:47:12] doesn't put aside the five-fold ministry
[1:47:16] that has the ministry of reconciliation
[1:47:19] in her to speak the word so that the
[1:47:22] sons and Daughters of God wherever they
[1:47:24] are trapped can be set
[1:47:27] free it's not just preaching salvation
[1:47:29] it's preaching Deliverance it's
[1:47:32] preaching healing it's preaching uh uh
[1:47:35] giving you you know that the the Lord
[1:47:37] can give you back a sound mind amen
[1:47:39] praise God the manifestation of this
[1:47:42] hour the bride not a Creator
[1:47:44] denomination but a living Oracle of God
[1:47:47] a living attribute of God displaying to
[1:47:50] the world the attributes of God God in
[1:47:53] the formation of the Bride that's to be
[1:47:56] expressed in this hour that we're now
[1:48:01] living
[1:48:04] in we
[1:48:09] are the last
[1:48:11] sign we're the last
[1:48:16] generation we're the ones that are going
[1:48:18] to close out the Gentile
[1:48:21] dispensation there's no other scripture
[1:48:24] after Revelations 21 where it says and
[1:48:28] the spirit and the bride say
[1:48:32] come we are that bride that's saying
[1:48:35] come if you really want to be identified
[1:48:39] with Christ you want your true identity
[1:48:41] then you need to come you need to
[1:48:44] identify yourself with the word not good
[1:48:47] neighbor Ministries not uh so and so
[1:48:50] Ministry down the street not this
[1:48:51] Baptist Church no
[1:48:53] Christ be identified with the word and
[1:48:57] the word is Jesus Christ the same
[1:49:01] yesterday today and
[1:49:04] forever

[1:49:11] close says see what great love the
[1:49:14] father hath lavished on us that we
[1:49:17] should be called the children of
[1:49:20] God and that is what we are
[1:49:24] and the reason the world does not know
[1:49:27] us is that they did not know
[1:49:30] him that when he asked that question who
[1:49:33] do you say that I
[1:49:37] am they couldn't
[1:49:40] respond because it was not given to them
[1:49:43] to respond it's a
