TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good morning friends how good it is for brethren to dwell together in unity it's a marvelous thing when we come together again in our father's name to worship him and to give him glory honor and praise may the lord richly bless us all today which is considered as father's day a day when fathers are revered and fathers are praised and recognized for their positions and for their work uh their contributions to their families and to society may god bless every father christian and otherwise bless him with salvation bless him with the joy of life and joy of his family may the great holy spirit of god take the word of god and apply it to our hearts and our lives so that we may be able to have a road map to live by may god bless us all as we enter into the scriptures matthew chapter 6 reading verse 9. now in this verse the disciples early in their time with jesus they heard him praying and praying different times praying and so they asked him this timeless question lord teach us to pray and jesus responded with these words that we find in matthew 6 verse 9. after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name let's read the next verse thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven may god bless the reading of his word to our hearts here today blessed be god our heavenly father who has given us this word to feed on as children of the living god today we would like to talk about qualities of a good father qualities of a good father and of course if we are to discuss or talk about the qualities of a good father god comes into perspective right then for he is the perfect father that is the reason why the lord jesus himself said our heavenly father praise god we love the words that wonderful song we have a heavenly father up above oh my his eyes full of mercy and his heart is full of love oh praise god thank you lord for being our heavenly father and we call him our father because of our relationship with him we have a relationship with him through the recognition of the holy spirit by revelation of the word we call him our heavenly father because we now recognize we came from him and we recognize on earth we recognize the one on earth that we came from in heaven we recognize god our lord jesus christ as our heavenly father praise god and so we are using today this wonderful uh relationship and fellowship that exists or should exist between a father and his children and so when we look into the bible which is the written word of god we find that god being the perfect parent the perfect father then we should use him of course as our pattern and we find first of all when we look at god then we want to take those qualities and place them on an earthly father and thereby present to you the qualities of a good father if it's good for god it's good for me and so we find a good father loves and cares for his own he cares for his children and it's a horrible thing when a man does not care for his children i've said to my own church and to my own people from time to time that there are good fathers and there are bad fathers and uh in this we find out we are living in an age when uh people have lost the vision or the pattern of who and what is a good father and we find that being a good father is just being able to equate one's self with the fact that they're able to bear or to have a child or children or many children and uh but as i've said and will say again that is only proving to the world that you are male that you are a man that you have the ability to produce children but fatherhood is different from that that doesn't make you a father that just identifies you that you are male and that you are a man but fatherhood now is taking the responsibility over those children that you have issued forth into this world and they're here coming from you because just like us we were once in god we were hid in the mind of god and we have no recollection of it we have no memory of it we can't remember it we can't think about it but we know from the word of god and from present truth that we were once in the mind of god just as we were in our dads our fathers we were in their loins we have no awareness no consciousness of that but we know we were there if we were not there then we could not be here if we were not in god then we could not be revealed at this time as a manifested son a manifested child of the living god but we were in him so you see a good father is one that after his kids are made manifest uh to his eyes to his sight then he wants to take that baby he wants to take that child and to love it and to care for it in every possible way oh i'm so glad that we have someone to care i've sung it i've said it and we'll say it again someone to care someone to share all your struggles like no other can do he'll come down from the skies wipe the tears from your eyes you're his child and he cares for you first peter chapter 5 verse 7 says casting all your cares upon him for he care it for you yes he cares for you through sunshine or rain through darkness through pain he cares for you no wonder jesus said cast all your cares upon me amen oh praise god may you take your troubles your problems your sickness your sorrows your temptations your grief your repressions whatever they may be cast your cares upon him for he cares for you i'm so glad that we have a heavenly father up above and that heavenly father cares for us the devil will want to make you question that many times he'll try to test you try you for you to question that whether god cares whether god really loves you but i'm here today to say amen that he cares and he loves and cares for his own he loves his children hallelujah amen so a good father cares for his children and then since he cares for his children a good father protects his children jesus protected us jesus kept us out from of hell jesus gave his all for us he spread his arms through art to heaven as the bridge of life and there he allowed himself to be nailed to the cross for us the old song says he was nailed to the cross for me he was nailed to the cross for you and i and that is how much a father a good father should love his children and protect his children in every way and to stand as a buffer as a protector as god is our shield so a father ought to be a shield to the evils that will attack his children that is what fatherhood is about and that is another quality of a good father listen to the word of god amen but those who are matthew 18 6 but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that the millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depths of the sea god protects his own remember there's another scripture where the lord said touch not my anointed do my prophets no harm amen for god is watching over his own like an eagle fluttering over its nest watching over its young protecting his young amen glory to god god watching over his household and nothing can touch them nothing can do anything to them we all we have many times told the story of how the great eagle what's come and picked the little eaglets up from the nest place them on her wings and then they fly right down to the valley floor and then that father sits in a rock that mother sits on a rock high up on the mountainside and watching those little ones playing in the valley floor and even so my friends while they're playing having fun with one another if a fox if a wolf if any mountain lion or some other wild creature were to be drawing near to attack them they are not caring they cast their care on their mother their cast their care on their father they're not worried because they're trusting in their heavenly father their father is up above when they look up and they see their father sitting on that rock with those evil eyes looking around and looking down at them they know they are safe because if any danger was to come to them he would be swooping down with the wings of an eagle and the talons of an eagle to protect his own and that is our god who is our refuge and our strength our god our help does not come from the earth but our help comes from above our help comes from the holy hills of heaven our help comes from our god amen and he's watching over us every step we make every move everything we do he's watching over us brother sister don't fear don't worry don't get into a into a worked up back state but remain calm confident resting and relying and trusting in the lord amen for all things all a-l-l all things whether they appear good or bad will work together for good to them that love the lord god protects his own and a good father will always seek to protect his child amen praise god a good father also provides for his child but god provides for us philippians 4 19 says but my god shall supply all your needs according to his riches in glory by christ jesus god will supply all your needs no wonder jesus prayed give us this day our daily bread hallelujah brother sister god has promised us our daily bread and we should expect that god will provide for us amen god will take care of his children and provide for his children all their needs will be provided by him we are in his care we are in his watchful care we are in his tender care and our heavenly father watches over me glory to god a good father always provides for his children we're so called today there are men of all stripes older men middle-aged men young men that just go around producing children but they don't provide for them and they thought what to provide for them oh but our god regardless provides for his children he doesn't care where they are he will watch over them and he will provide for them but we living in a day now when they can desert that mother with our children desert those children forget about them heartless cruel without that goodness of a good father who will provide for his own and will protect his own yes my friends no good father will walk away and leave his children without his protection no way will he do that but we have promised in the bible that as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in this day of the coming of the son of man he says they took unto themselves women that took to themselves amen and so that's what we see today there is a lot of so-called common law not god's law not god's word not god's way but common law relationships and this is anyone is free to live that way the government allows it and no one could say anything about it unless i am telling you from the word of god god said it would repeat again in this day that men would just be living with women living with them and that is all no real marriage relationship no real god's approval uh as long as they have proof of it they think it's all right but according to this bible according to god's word my friends god is the one that instituted marriage and one should not just go take a woman have children all over the place that's nothing but an unclean spirit that is resting on a person that will do something like that and the thing to do to cleanse yourself from the filth of an unclean spirit is to repent turn your heart and your life to god and may he take control of your entire life that you may walk out in the newness of life with a new vision with a new purpose to fulfill your way and your position of who you are in jesus christ a good father doesn't only bring his children into this world but a good father tries to guide them and to teach them and he does that by word and he does it by example or action and so a good father always does that he models a behavior that he like his children to pick up and before that before that he he does these things or he'll say certain things to them over and over again so that they will remember what their father said and many of us while i'm speaking here can think about our own father and remember clearly some of the statements that he made over and over it stuck with us uh it's stuck in our memory and so our father has a great responsibility to guide his children and to teach his children for god promised in his word john 14 26 but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and oh bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you so god teaches his children god guides his children as he did with the pillar of fire god guides us by his word through revelation for the god's word is a light onto our feet and a lamp onto our path and god's word revealed to us is that light and that lamp by which we are guided and we are taught by the blessed holy spirit and god being our perfect heavenly father a good father taking that example will guide his children and teach his children by example a brother was recently reminding me of a story i told some time ago of how this father was a great drinker he loved alcohol he loved the bars he loved the friends the laughter the smoke the atmosphere loose men loose women loose talking in the bar they call he called that freedom but anyway he loved the bars and so this one winter night he was home with his wife and with his child little boy and while there had the craving for drink and so he decided he was going to go to the bar and have himself some drinks before coming home and so he left to go to the bar and walking in the snow down the pathway of that home and he sensed as if there was someone following him and he looked back and to his surprise there was his little child wearing a pair of his boots and trying to walk in his father's footsteps but of course his legs were too short but he was making the attempt to walk in the imprints of his father's footsteps in the snow and when that dad that father looked back and he saw that it sucked touched his heart it broke his heart that he turned back picked up the boy headed back to the home in tears and asked his wife to lead him to christ that he might know him all my friends even so brother sister we may not know they're watching they're listening to us wow we are to guide them and teach them but what are we teaching them by what we say we teaching them are we teaching them to swear are we teaching them to curse are we teaching them to lie are we teaching them negative things are we teaching them by our actions are we teaching them to fight the fuss oh frank to worry what are we teaching them and so my friends this father realized that he was leading his son to the bar rooms to a life that would be a life of reckon of shame and so he turned back and gave his life to christ may some father hear me today and turn his life to christ give his heart over to the lord and may jesus take control of your life that you may be a good father a worthy father a responsible father and that god will be able to bless you and use you for his glory amen praise god hallelujah amen yes sir what are we teaching them what are we what examples are we providing to them what are we showing them what is it that we're leaving for them praise god hallelujah listen the a good father also helps his child praise god as god our heavenly father helps us oh no other help i know amen god will help you jesus will help you the god of heaven will help you listen my brother sister oh when your child is running towards you and they slip and fall and bruise their knees you don't take a whip to them and whip them for falling down because their children you don't whip them for bruising their knees you know whip them for falling off they swing oh my they may get in the swing of the world and they fall off or they get in the crowd and run and the next thing you know they fall and they bruise their knees you must recognize they're wrong but you don't whip them my friends for falling you know whip them in any way for bruising their knees because that is a teachable moment there is something for them to learn from that we pick them up we brush them off we dress the one the best we can and they we put them to rise and try again and so a good father will guide and teach his child and a good father will help his child and brush the dust of life from off of them psalm chapter 46 verse 1. god is our refuge and our strength our very present help in the time of trouble we have help in the time of trouble and our god is our help in the time of trouble are you in trouble are you in a black hole are you in a pit my friends and this hour god is your refuge and your strength a very present help in the time of trouble he'll take you out as this old song said got any rivers you think are impossible got any mountains you can't tunnel true our god specializes in things that are impossible and he will help you he will bring you through for he is a very present help in the time of trouble blessed be the name of our god a good father will not put down his child you see there are many parents and many fathers in particular that tried to raise their child but while raising them they put them down at the same time and they use statements like oh you're not a monk to anything you're no good this boy is bad that girl is horrible she won't get anywhere in life she is this she is that always discouraging and putting their child down calling them all kinds of names telling them they're useless oh my oh friends we should not engage in anything of that nature for god tries to lift us up god tries to encourage us god tries to straighten us amen he is our invisible backer and he's always behind us to help us when we fall to help us when we awake to help us in every aspect of human life i'm speaking about the qualities of a good father trusting god that you will have those qualities and if you do not have all of these qualities you will ask god to help you with them amen but a good father will not discourage his children he will lift them up will not call them names will not put them down will not embarrass them in front of their friends or in front of the neighborhood or in front of anybody for that matter but will try to encourage them in every way now watch colossians chapter 3 verse 21 fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged you know adults can literally provoke a little child take advantage of them by provoking them by doing and saying things that can get your own child angry and the bible says fathers you are not to provoke your children but to encourage them you are not to discourage your children but to lift up them lift them up and to point them in the right and in the proper way now a good father also will discipline his children not dr swiss seuss method we are not to follow just dr seuss doctor this this other professor they may have good remarks that they may make but our eyes should be upon the blueprint of god's word for god is the greatest child trainer god is the best upbringer god is the best sheep razor god is the one where to look to him for we have a heavenly father up above eyes full of mercy and a heart that is full of love god that cares for his own o blessed be the name of god amen yes sir you know these various doctors and writers of child rearing books will tell you oh you you should not really uh discipline the child uh with the with their switcher or something of that nature you should not touch them you should only speak to them and when you speak do not speak with a stern tone because it may hurt them emotionally in some way or the other but my friends i'm telling you it never hurt me it didn't hurt me emotionally or in any other way amen because god in his word tells us what we are to do he says a foolish father or mother foolish when you do not discipline your children amen whoa listen to the word of god amen clearly hebrews chapter 12 verses 5 to 11 amen praise god now and you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the lord love it he disciplines he chasten it and scourge at every son whom he received every child of god is going to be tested it's going to be disciplined it's going to be touched by god amen for whom the lord love it in other words if parents love their children they're not going to lose them to the foolishness of just psychology but they will take the word of god that says we ought to discipline our children for he those whom he loves he chastens amen now if we endure chastening god dealt with us as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our prophet in other words the discipline is for your prophet is for your for you to profit or to learn something oh yes oh praise god that we might be partakers of his holiness furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh who corrected us if your father loves you your mother loves you they'll correct you in every possible way and we give them reverence respects for shall we not much more rather be in subjection unto the father of all spirits our heavenly father amen and live now no chastening no discipline seem it for the present time to be joyous but grievous god you tried you tested you chastened it's grievous you feel it to the bone but nevertheless afterwards it yielded the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby amen praise be to god a good father will discipline his child many examples of fathers in the bible who did not discipline their children and you may read the scriptures and see the various examples in the word of god but god being our perfect father disciplines his children and said even your earthly father knows that correcting his children is good for them and the children also know it for later on they turn around and reverence or respect their father because of the correction that he gave now make no mistake about it when i speak about disciplining our children and correcting our children i have no thought i'm not projecting the idea and even some in the religious realm have the wrong idea which turns discipline into child abuse we are not here for the purpose of child abuse but there is appropriate measured discipline and corrective action as displayed in the word of god and we must and should obey the word of god and we will see the good results of it when we stay close to god's word i repeat we are here not to abuse our children not to go against what the word of god says not against what the law says as long as this law lines up with god's word we are for that law amen but our faith is with the word of god but the faith that is in the word of god does not recommend or speak of any form of child abuse and it's any real father or parent mother our father that really and truly loves their children will discipline them in an appropriate measured fashion just so that they could can learn and profit from the teaching and guidance that they receive also another quality of a good father a good father feeds his children but god himself matthew chapter 4 verse 4 and he answered them and said it is written men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god and of course you see the symbiology and the typology in his feeding of the five thousand and the three multitudes of five thousand and three thousand god feeds his children god provides for them housing food and clothing and he makes sure that they're taken care of don't call yourself a good father if you're not doing those basic fundamental things and in some form or the other some level high or low doesn't matter as long as we fulfill the guidance that we have been given in the word of god so a good father will feed his children god feeds us daily upon the living bread of his word but he said listen you should not live by bread alone which is saying man should live by bread man should live on his natural food for natural food holds body and soul together so you can worship god but don't just eat natural food and not take in the spiritual food which is very important because if you go one entire day or week without food you're going to be weak amen and this one preacher once said seven days without prayer makes one week weak w-e-a-k right so one got to be careful let us feed upon the word of god from which we receive our strength glory to god then a good father will pl has plans for his children jeremiah 29 11. for you know the plans i have for you god has plans for us friends plans and it goes on in that scripture to say blends the prosper you the the new international version gives it clear god has plans for you and the father will plan for his children whether by day night early morning whatever he's thinking of his children he's planning for his children he's preparing for their future amen praise god hallelujah oh my some people think they have no future but god is telling you i have plans for you amen and i i have plans for you to have a future amen don't think your life has come to a dead-end street and there is no way out for you because you're serving a god who has plans for you and a plan for you to have a future and a good future and he will take you from where you are to take you into the future that he has planned for you you will walk right into that reality the unfailing reality of the living god making his word known amen hallelujah ah yes my friends god a good father will never purposely do or say anything to purposely hurt his child he will only do things that will help that child whether it's a girl or a boy male or female he will only want to help them not to hurt them yes sir you only want to do things to help them to grow in their lives and not only to grow physically but to mature mentally and spiritually in every way this is what god is doing for us as believers feeding us caring for us watching over us planning for us so my friends that we may grow in grace and we may mature in our walk with him praise be to god oh praise god our heavenly father operates in a wonderful way and as the scripture says his ways are perfect and you know i thank god that the heavenly father his ways are perfect but earthly fathers as good as some of them may be earthly fathers are men and they may err they may make mistakes and these things that i have said to you and i've preached here to you it is not new despite it has been preached and said by many great men many other preachers hallelujah and no real preacher will sway or wave away from the word of god but will stay with the word of god amen hallelujah amen and so friends as good as our earthly fathers may be they may still have their flaws places where they air or an error so the only real father that we can look to knowing that he is perfect is the god of heaven our heavenly father for god never make mistakes in his dealings with his children listen romans 8 28 but we know all things work together for good to them that love the lord amen and are called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate predestinated for what predestinated to a confirmation to his image to the image of his son hallelujah praise god that we might use jesus as our example as an image a visual image of the stature of a perfect man that we can use that for our growth and for our spiritual maturity amen praise be to god moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified hallelujah we have been justified and now the glorific glorification the glorifying power of the holy spirit moving in us preparing us for that wonderful rapture amen yes glorifying you oh praise his marvelous name i'm glad i heavenly have a heavenly father amen a heavenly father who loves and care for his own i'm so glad i have have a heavenly father that sick sits on a high place as the scripture says he sits high but he's looking low he's watching over his own while they are playing around in this world of sin and there are wolves and snakes and scorpions and all manner of evil animals trying to eat up his people as if they're eating bread but the great eagle eyes of our god is watching over his own fear not little flock it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom may the holy spirit apply the word of god to our hearts today listen to matthew 7 11 if you then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him oh praise god hallelujah brother sister let me say this i want to read from matthew 7 as i'm just winding down now ask and you shall be given seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that ask it receive it some years ago i preached a message called every prayer is answered and this was the text he said everyone that asked it receive it every prayer is answered but you must understand sometimes god will say yes you can have it and he'll give it to you another moment he'll say just wait a little while before i give it to you and you'll just have to pray and pray and wait and another time he'll says no it's not right i won't give you a knife you're too young to have a knife you're too young to have a gun you're too have too young to in christian life to have what you're asking me for so your every prayer is answered yes wait a little while or no but every single prayer that is prayed is answered amen for every one that ask it receive it and he that seeketh find it and to him that knock it it shall be opened or what man is there whom if his son ask him for bread will give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he give him a serpent if you then being evil or sinful know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him may god bless his word to your heart and may you learn to appreciate and love your heavenly father we love a song we sing it many times in our church we have a heavenly father up above with eyes full of mercy and a heart full of love oh thank god and then there is heavenly father i appreciate you heavenly father i appreciate you i love you i adore you i bow down before you heavenly father i appreciate you gracious heavenly father we appreciate you on this father's day and we bless your name and if we're to wish anyone happy father's day we want to wish you a happy father's day and on your behalf as your son and servant i in turn bid all these listening watching fathers wherever they are a happy father's day and a happy father's life that they may go from this place take this wisdom and knowledge from your word and from your your example and action and to go live by the pattern of the qualities of good fatherhood may god bless us all here today in jesus name amen brothers and sisters god bless you i want to announce to you that we will be having a partial re-opening of our in-house church services
