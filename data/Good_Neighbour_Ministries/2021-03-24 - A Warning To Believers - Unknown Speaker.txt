TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] my dear friends good evening may the lord richly bless you i come this evening with a warning a scriptural warning for believers of all ages may the great holy spirit take the word of god and speak to us just for a while god richly bless us together let us pray our gracious heavenly father how thankful we are that you never change you never lie you're the same yesterday today and forever may you lord god cause your word to speak and live and receive glory as the word goes out as the word is broadcast to the very ends of the earth to call your elected and beloved bride together again as the family of god we thank thee from the bottom of our hearts to thee be all the praise the honor and the glory in the name of our blessed lord jesus christ amen well our scripture for tonight is found in the book of jude verse 11. woe unto them for they have gone in the way of cain and ran greedily after the error of balaam for reward and perished in the game saying of core or quora may god bless his word to our hearts today amen glory to god hallelujah now let us take scriptural warning here let us take warning and this warning is to believers all believers everywhere of all ages and of every time may great the great holy spirit speak to our hearts for us to realize the seriousness of the deception uh created by the evil one in this twilight hour of the last age of the church of god now in the scripture we just read there is a warning there is a warning included in there how that in the days of the prophet moses as you know he was a prophet that was sorry vindicated by god by the holy spirit with signs wonders and miracles and most of all thus saith the lord whatever he said in the name of the lord is what came to pass and so he was a thoroughly vindicated prophet of the most high god but when he went out with the children of israel god using him to bring them a great deliverance redemption by blood and power passing through the red sea entering into the wilderness led by the pillar of fire and a pier of cloud under the protection and provision of drake the great job of god who was leading his people into a promised the promised land from a natural bondage natural slavery through a natural wilderness into a natural promised land of canaan we are the opposite we are also led by that same great jehovah but we are being led into out of a spiritual egyptian bondage of denominationalism systems and the works of the hands of man we are being called out pulled out led out brought out breaking away from such things and walking out into the glorious liberty of the great holy spirit trials will be there their testings will be there you will come to a red sea where it seems there is no crossing but god will make a way a miraculous way and bring us through we have a wilderness a wilderness of this modern world this modern age in which we live is a wilderness with wild beasts fiery serpents all manner of hardships hot sun of trials temptations and so on we are to face the same thing that they faced but in a spiritual sense but as they had ever present water from a natural rock we have ever present times of refreshing coming from the presence of the lord through our lord jesus christ hallelujah amen so how thankful we are that they israel in egypt israel in the wilderness israel in the promised land is a type of the church being in denominationalism control and slavery laboring working out their salvation in that natural sense into the wilderness of the world and then to be led by the pillar of fire god above us with the prophet on the earth at the same time to lead us thank god again he has sent a prophet malachi 4 5 this prophet amen of the 20th century to lead us out of the bondage of churchianity out of the bondage of denominationalism and the systems of man into the promised land of canaan canaan not being a type of heaven but because in canaan there were still wars and fightings that they had to do but it is a type of the believer entering into the promised land or the land of the promised word the word that is filled with promises waiting for you to see them understand them and to break into the revelation of them and recognize that there's milk and honey in the word of god for this hour so we are on the same journey but spiritually speaking and here we go just as korra and dayton withstood moses and rose up against that mighty prophet amen disputing with moses and claiming that they had just as much revelation as moses did so so they are also prophets so they can also preach the word and and they can withstand moses they could call him other names uh do whatever they wished and then they also were denying his leadership and his authority over them whatsoever amen praise god my friends the bible tells us cora rose up and withstood moses that means that he hindered or tried to obstruct moses in his path of duty and that is a a horrible an abominable sin in the eyes of god to do his prophet's harm and to hinder his anointed ones in the work that he has ordained for them to do amen now you say well brother simon you said korah and dayton which stood moses how did they withstand them well they would argue with him openly so that the people could hear not privately they'll take him and go discuss with him but that was another matter because they were scared about that the pillar of fire was there oh praise god man that will stand with god's prophet with the purifier standing there that did not want that just like the group up in chicago 400 of them they it's okay they were asking about the serpent see they were asking about this doctrine on one god they were asking him about his doctrine on the ev the towns being the evidence and he was taking god's word and making it clear that these modern day teachings of men so believable to modern society but was not approved or recognized or even known by the apostles the original doctrine of one god hallelujah baptism of the holy spirit by the revelation of the word amen hallelujah knowing him in the power of his resurrection so they were arguing disputing finding uh points of of of doctrine for disputing and denying the authority of this god ordained and god sent prophet just as they are doing today questioning obstructing disputing and denying the his authority and most of all the bible says there were gang saying the game saying of gora now i thought i'd lock this up so i checked checked up on it and i found that gail saying means brenda greek anti-logia anti-logia which means against the word anti-lodia meaning against the word they were gained saying or were against thus saith the lord spoken by the prophet moses they're against god's word and i would say uh personally i want to paraphrase this for our modern age in other words that taking what moses say said and they're taking what this prophet of this 20th century william branham said and twisting it perverting it adding a little hair subtracting a little bit over there rephrasing it right from his message they'll catch a little insight from his message nobody else ever thought of any such a thing before he said it but once he said it the seals are open they grabbed onto it get a little human insight on it rephrase it a bit publicly begin to express uh from it as if it's their great personal revelation or thought or that they had some higher or better understanding then the prophet of this 20th century that is what korah was doing to moses back there in order to twist the tail and to pull the rest of the people under the shadows and darkness of his influence so he added a little hair subtracted a little there just enough to contradict or to belittle the message of his day and of his hour and so do these in this hour contradict the word of god gain say the prophet of malachi 4 5 which not one of them was what stand before him when he was alive and the cat would stand the holy spirit of god even to this hour but personally in him the prophet the things they are saying now they will never say to his face on the basis that the holy spirit will not approve of it if in my own ministry i have literally witnessed after hearing my uh preaching of the word of god man standing before me calling all manner of names saying all manner of things and worst of all beginning to speak against the prophet of the hour following one of my believers and speaking all manner of things against the prophet of this hour and with the police there on the scene watching and listening to the going on the gentleman continued to speak against this prophet against this message and a preacher of this message and suddenly in the midst of it with the police standing there he suddenly went and fell on the ground instant death he died on the spot and the police themselves were scared they moved off the scene and they called for backup they didn't know how to handle it what to do but the point i'm making here these like korra speaking against the message you say oh you're just trying to get me afraid oh you may take it that way but if you continue down that path it's the past of destruction and blasphemy it's the past you're against saying against the word of god turn around turn around god is calling calling you from that life of wasted years back to the word back to christ back to this hour stand by the promise until the crown you gain god didn't ask you do you understand it all yes do you believe it hallelujah praise god i never fully understand the teachings on the serpent seed and this or that my friend but i knew there was something back there that spoke to my soul that caused me to recognize from the deep in my heart that this was the thus saith the lord that it is absolutely the truth not some man explaining it to me not some man paraphrasing parsing or are you arguing debating or bringing his logic to bear persuading no it was not by the persuasions of man but by the revelation of the holy ghost may the lord god grant you the same thing here tonight for his glory and for his honor glory to god hallelujah amen others may be able to take this word of god and logically beautifully be able to declare it with scholarship with knowledge with all manner of human means my friends like a lawyer to be able to disprove or prove but my friends when my heart begins to beat and i feel the inspiration and the pulsation of the blessed holy spirit within me i can't help it but become emotional in my expressions of this promise of this day and for this hour because it's real to me and i can see it clearly in the word of god may god help you that you may also see it in the word of god you will see if you want to see if you don't want to see then of course you'll blind your eyes and you'll you'll stop your feet you'll walk away you'll stop your ears you would want to hear amen because jesus said it they see and they see not and they're those that will hear just outward ear here and yet they hear not they understand not oh my praise god hallelujah amen even though it was moses that was leading them receiving manna from the heavens spiritual food in due season receiving quail from the heavens god feeding them leading them guiding them they could see the vindication of god back of this man called moses in our day the entire world can see in the life and ministry of william marion branham the inspiration the vindication of god being back of that man was not just the man but god was back of him and that has been vindicated and is still being vindicated in this day and in this hour that he's the same yesterday today and forever i am the lord that changeth not amen praise god hallelujah amen praise god so we see it my dear friends this same spirit of korah which is a spirit of rebellion the spirit of rebellion in man the same spirit that was in satan up in heaven to rebel against god and try to raise up and have a ministry like that prophet and lucifer trained to have a leadership and ministry like the god of heaven and he was kicked out into outer darkness where he still is today as the prince of darkness wishing that you will never believe in such a person as satan wishing that you would never believe in evil spirits and demons being in the background whispering peeping murmuring complaining or analyzing debating power doing all manner of evil seducing deluding creating illusions of the mind and the poisoning of the mind drawing man away from christ and away from the word of god for this day and for this hour but thank god yes promise he always will have his faithful few will stand by the truth and the word of god until they gain the crown that was promised to them in the word of god now they tried to show up moses they tried to preach a message that appears to be better smoother more logical more scholastic that they could present to the people and do you know many ran after them after hearing seeing the vindication that flowed out of the life of malachi 4 5 the prophet of this hour william marion branham the servant of the most high god who is present here with us in this day and in this hour amen remains the same he does not change and he's alive forevermore praise god hallelujah and so many leaders followed quora away from moses the prophet and so in our day many are following these smooth uh you know beautiful handsome well-spoken a presentation masterful my goodness they have all of the different angles of being photogenic they have all the actions all the gestures or everything that is necessary perfect even their speech is perfect no eyes and um hallelujahs and amen and these kinds of primitive kind of christianity behavior no they are schooled they are so systematized that they are caught up in the world of human ingenuity and education and the logical way of doing things now and so these followed the way of quora similar to a lot of the evangelists today and they came up with the golden calf scheme which they presented to aaron and caused the great uh destruction in the wilderness when the earth which is a type of world and worldliness opened up and swallowed an entire bunch of them but they deny the power thereof they disputed against the word of god they withstood and argued against their message of their hour like some are doing today discussing and arguing and proving against this hour spending thousands of dollars rather to win souls they're spending thousands of dollars to make many souls they twofold tenfold more the children of hell may god help us today may god send heavenly sunshine light from above to break up the darkness that is around you and around anyone that will hear the word of god the voice of god in this hour this ministry is just the fruit of brother branham's ministry this ministry is off of the same tree it is after the same kind it is after the same seed oh my it may not express things the way he did it the way god called him placed him that is his position his pulse and none can take his place there's only one messenger to this church age and any church age and the rest that follows are only sons daughters and other under shepherds and servants of the five-fold ministry and servants of the most high god that are just fulfilling their task in the in the light of this day and of this hour and we have faced today with the same thing moses face leaders following korra like the evangelists today back there they formed the golden calf so they can have all the people bringing their their gold their silver all their money is there and casting it before their feet and oh they're in their glory because people in this day they're throwing money they're trying jewelry they're bringing their dollars and sharing it upon them they take that to be a vindication of their ministry so called but that's nothing but a golden calf scheme and we have tons of them with these golden calf schemes my friends they look good to people just like korra looked really good religious like quora appeared to be korah was even quoting moses oh like the serpent quoted god himself did not god say so so so and then turn around but and then he gave his interpretation of what he thought it was and denying and disputing against the very word of god and yet he had multitudes following him because he appeared to look good sound good oh and it was to their modern intellectual and perverted twisted taste and so they accepted him but usually my friends these are really spiritual vultures that are trying to pose as if they are eagles because you know in the sky when they are very far up in the sky if you're not watching carefully you will mistake a vulture for an eagle but really a vulture cannot fly as high as an eagle he'll break up because of he can't stand the spiritual pressure that it takes to go into those realms but here we find modern-day evangelists of this message outside of the message in the message of this hour spiritual vultures trying to look like an eagle but the difference is they have different appetites one will partake only of the fresh killed revelation of the word of god the meat of god for this day and for this hour while the other is living off of the carrion of the rotten carrion of history the rotten carrion of man's theology church teaching seminarianism all these things oh my friends they're living off of their past and of the past things is what they're feeding on with the spirit and hunger and thirst of a vulture while the eagle wants nothing but the red meat of the fullness of the word of god is dripping with blood it's dripping with blood this holy ghost gospel is tripping with blood or praise god there is no salvation there is no redemption there is no token there is nothing no deliverance without the blood of jesus for the life is in the blood hallelujah only by the blood are we set free by the great holy spirit hallelujah amen oh thank god for the blood i know it was the blood i said i know it was the blood it was the blood and is the blood that sets us free and washes us white as snow yes sir they like vultures and you know vultures they're not real hunters they ask avengers they'll wait for the prophet to go and get that that spiritual kill bring out the revelation interpretation manifestation out of the word and then they will come after and feeding on that getting straight from it getting insights from it getting directions from it then go out with their partial understanding and go out with their partial private insights and begin to oppose deny and dispute and gain say against the very word of god that gave them their very life at that particular time so their spiritual scavengers of the word of this hour not only that but they are also parasites they don't have that prophetic insight but they are parasites amen now you know what a parasite is it's like a blood sucker a parasite is like um what do you call them um those bugs anyway you can take the word and break that down they're parasites to give you one example there is a beautiful plant called orchid but there is a type of orchid that their existence is not in the ground it's not like that drawing their own strength but they make it their business to be in a large tree and they draw their life from that tree they're in the jungles they're in the bushes orchids beautiful beautiful ministries beautiful men so-called beautiful women are even preaching and teaching and they will claim that they're sent from god oh and they'll talk about william branham what a powerful preacher he was what how god used him but you see that's nothing but a parasite that's living off of that ministry which it turns around and tries to kill it turns around tries to deny it dispute it gains say it and then on the other hand trying to use it as a launching pad for their own life oh my friends let us see the evil works and deceptions of satan parasites tree orchids living off of the life of the original plant of the word of god twisters of what he has said so many i have met or said oh random said the world is going to end in 1977 he said no such thing he prophesied it when the angel of god said untime shall be no more they do not understand that time he was not speaking of the end of the world that was the end of the church ages being announced that the church ages have come at that time were coming to their end and that's all he was announcing they don't go on where he says well um i don't know it could be 75 years 100 years it could i don't know but this is how i felt when i was in the vision amen uh there will come with little things like that and try to twist it and pervert it and pervert the minds of many away from the word of god that is just one i won't go into the other but many other things they will point to and make all kinds of remarks with no understanding whatsoever trying to lead people instead of leading the persons to salvation they're leading them to destruction and away from the tree of life amen no parasites amen perverts of the word and most of them become also parrots because they have no revelation that god will give them so all they can do is study what the prophet of god said and all they can do is quote continuously and continually what he said and they hide behind the veil of saying oh i'm only saying what he said oh my so i'll stay with the law by reading it when i get into court i will not have any insight i will not have any discretion in looking at the situation and knowing how to apply the law or how to apply the token for that moment that situation and that problem in this day this time this moment this hour god is calling men and women children of his to break into the life of christ that he might work through them and reveal to them the word of god for this day and for this hour perverters of the word pirates of the word of god they just know how to compare quotes compare scripture with scripture like that with no revelation whatsoever oh my you know a man eats the it's a meeting a dog eats meat so a man is a dog no doesn't work like that it sounds logical but it's not true and we don't go just by the comparison of scripture comparison of cults comparison of texts but we certainly allow the holy spirit to lead us and guide us as it as he has done to real servants of god regardless of what church what group what denomination whatever they are that god will speak and use them for his glory with us divine spirit of divine revelation inspiration and anointing are the holy ghost and they cannot be denied because it's the word of god hallelujah amen if god can work trucka hyphas if god my friends can use any person he chooses to use if god could use a donkey god can use whoever he wants amen and dare you to come against that you stay right where you are and said oh i don't understand or i don't know what it's all about i can't figure it out but leave it alone and shut your mouth don't say anything but the moment you begin to speak against what god is doing be it in a child be it in a donkey be it in a man who you think is uneducated unlearned not schooled in your colleges your bible schools and your seminaries you'd better be careful for god works in mysterious ways god hides and reveals himself in the most unusual places an old prophet coming up the road with a gnarled stick looks like a nobody and nothing and yet that man was the man that had power over the entire all of egypt amen let us be careful how we walk how we live and what is our spiritual perception given to us by the great holy spirit of the living god yes lots of these modern day preachers modern day churches and churchianity nothing but impersonators carnal opportunists to the word of god copycats compromises of the word of god listen they even allow amen women preachers in the church oh brother simon now you've got my attention are you preaching against women preaching in the church i am preaching the word of god listen first timothy chapter 2 verse 12 listen what the word of god says but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to your serp authority over the man but to be in silence oh but brother simon we have a lot of female bible teachers and they're good teachers of the world well i don't deny that some of them are better preachers than men uh some of them are better uh i have more insight more understanding than even man but that has nothing to do with it simple humble obedience to the word of god is what god is requiring and asking for and regardless of whether talented gifted whether having this or that god said i mean satan was gifted lucifer was the most gifted but yet god kicked him out and even so god says but i suffer not not is definitive i suffer not a woman to teach all these so-called bible teachers wonderful god uh i tell you that they're fantastic in their teaching their explanations they they their layouts and it's marvelous to catch your attention but it's contrary to the word of the living god contrary for thou shalt not suffer a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence because teaching with man in the congregate i won't teach on this now i'm just passing presupposes that the teacher that's teaching that word has authority over those that are listening or hearing the word he has some authority to preach the word a woman has authority to teach her children a woman has authority to teach in a school a woman has authority to teach under various conditions but in this particular condition of preaching their word she shall not teach and the bible says it but the preachers will preach it because they believe it will damage their ministry it will get the the women to rise up against them for saying the truth of the word of god and all they're doing is not giving their opinion i'm not giving my opinion all i'm giving you is what it says here in first timothy chapter 2 verse 12. oh you can have all your arguments you'd like against it but it still stands she shall not teach the usurp authority she shall not teach nor you serp authority but so-and-so she shall not teach it doesn't matter my friends she shall not teach for that is the word of our god that lives forever and cannot change and will not lie and these are the preachers with their golden calf schemes they'll open the church doors and have all kinds of people and women come in and give them post positions and elevate them and please them give them great names missionaryness deaconness that and uh all manner of names they'll give them to let them be puffed up with their religious position posts and and missionaries and missionary that it's not in the word it's not there that can accompany paul accompany peter go somewhere right there you'll never find it in this bible where god used them to go preach the word of god oh my here come on later these ones will allow women preachers allow women to go cut their hair i won't even bother to give you the scripture for that where the bible tells you clearly the hair is a woman's glory she should not cut off her hair where they'll see it in the bible but they won't preach it it'll make that congregation people will leave their churches and they won't have those thousands of people anymore they they wouldn't have the greater influence they have anymore so they will not touch that even though the bible says it she they'll they'll allow the women to waltz up the the middle eye of their church wearing slacks if at least not maybe shorts i've literally seen them in bathing suits but uh my friends right in the church and they'll allow them to walls up to the front with a tight pair of slacks on oh no i don't wear those spare sucks i wear gauchos i wear this i wear that but god's word speaks clearly in deuteronomy 22 5 where the bible tells us the woman shall not wear that which pertain it unto a man neither shall a man put on women's garments for all that do so are a curse they are an abomination unto the lord thy god god is saying how would you like it if your husband starts wearing a dress but but it's okay for the woman to turn around and wear man's clothing no the bible says she shall not wear that which pertains to man for it's an abomination in the eyes of the living god let me repeat so you may read it for yourself that it's in your bible but teachings like that the preachers will not preach it because the people don't want to hear it and their churches are people are going to leave their churches and they're going to sin out like that they don't want to preach about the serpent seed about adultery in the garden what eve did in the garden they'll tell you she ate an apple or an ice apple or she ate a pineapple or she had a pear yeah it might be it might have been a pear not not the pear in the tree but a pear on the ground and a child's cane was born from it whom god cursed oh my god think of the hour that we're living in how far have we drifted away from the truths and the fullness of the word of god back to the word amen hallelujah glory to god amen yes sir they bypass the word of god and it only shows what kind of seed is in them for if there's a seed of god in there that seed is a part of god himself and is eternal as god is eternal and it can never deny god dispute god it cannot say something different from what god says for that seed is a part of him after his kind it cannot do it amen they'll stay with the word of god hallelujah amen but these they'll turn away from the word of god like some of jesus's disciples in john chapter 6 verse 6-6 when he said eat my flesh drink my blood they don't understand it they didn't realize what he was talking about and so they left him oh my think of it he only had 120 to go up into the upper room and out of the 800 or so disciples he had all the rest of them left him and he ended up with 120 in the upper room because they could not stand the word of god oh but jesus said for the rest of you will you also go away and he said lord where are else we going to go thou hast the words of eternal life they stood by the unshakable rock revelation of the word of god hallelujah they live by the word of god they moved by the word of god or they just stood upon the promises of christ their king amen praise god glory to god hallelujah my friends the same is happening today some are leaving the word and some are staying with the word of god and it's happening in this hour that many are leaving as jesus said in this parable of the wheat and of the tears how that the tears are to be bundled and i believe that bundling uniting of those denominational spirits and systems are in progress right now but while they're bundling amen for the burning we are gathering for glory we are being gathered up in the weak harvest time when the holy spirit is gathering gold and grain ripe and ready for the master's hand oh glory to god hallelujah oh praise god i thank god we are not here just by chance but we are here by the end time promise god's end time promise we believe in that promise of the coming of the elijah spirit according to the prophecy of malachi 4 5 we are here believing the promise that the word of god that lay seemingly dead through the ages oh my it's supposed to be quickened in this last day under the inspiration and the anointing of the blessed holy spirit that will turn the hearts of the children back to the apostolic fathers oh it is the rising of the sun yes the sunlight is here the darkness and the gloom is being pushed out and pushed away when the sun comes up the darkness has no place anymore it has to back away from the fullness of the word of the living god i praise god and thank him in this hour amen for this great hour that we are in the last of the gentile dispensation the last of the church ages the ending of it all hallelujah thank god for this marvelous servant and prophet god sent who started from genesis the serpent seed actually he started up in heaven before that but i'll just come here he started from the serpent seed in genesis right to the seed of god in her bride form in the book of revelation and thank god we are a part of it the denominations korah and dayton rejected moses the denominations the make believers has rejected this prophet of this generation but true believers regardless of where they are what church names they're hiding under just as elijah god had to tell him i've got thousands in eating from jezebel's table they're mine also but i'm calling out there calling them out come out from a mouse them and be not partaker of our place amen may that same great holy spirit take the word of god that's being declared here tonight and bring it into the portals of your heart that you may find your own way your own path into the presence of our king may god forgives of our unbelief or misunderstanding the word our disbelief of the word of god and bring us to
