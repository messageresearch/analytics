current events and seeing what's going on and and we know being the the the the the true church that's been given a a a a prophet in the 20th century that was able to unveil and also uh Step Beyond this Dimension here and to see things that were going to come that we are standing on some sure ground amen and that's why when we um you know we take quotes from William Branham who was a great minister of God um who fulfilled Malachi 45 Revelations 10 1-7 um you'll you'll see that we take quotes from there and we try to bring the understanding to see where we fit in the whole aspect of it amen because we have a Supernatural Part in this whole prophecy that is now taking place around us even right now amen so let's read the word of God from uh before we read let's just pray father we're hungry this morning Lord to hear from you and to receive the portion of word that you've ordained for us this day in October 2024 we acknowledge you as a present Supernatural God in our midst the almighty God in the form of a fivefold Ministry that will speak as oracles through your your anointed ministers in this hour we believe it Lord we receive it father we're under expectation to hear your voice this morning so won't you come into our midst move through the pews this morning search the hearts you know every need Lord though we are preaching on current events and and things that pertain to the church Lord the church is made up of individuals and we are those individuals this morning that are hungry like eagles for freshh Mana to give us the direction the guidance the confidence and the inspiration to press through the challenges that we will face as Sons and Daughters of God in this age Grant it we pray father anoint now your word in Jesus name remembering our pastor our former Pastor John Simon that will Minister your word in BC this morning for that little flock Lord may your anointing move over him and May present truth oh God move through the hearts of the people and stir their lives granted father we pray in Jesus name amen and amen um also just continue to pray for Joshua um that's brother uh ard's uh son brother Muhammad sister farida's brother's son who was in a serious accident had surgery he's um he's doing better by the grace of God we heard from brother Chris this morning that um that he's in good spirits under the circumstances he's you know it's a supernatural miracle that he only came out with a couple of scratches but yet a very serious injury in his spine and so continue to pray they've done the surgery now the great physician will do his surgery in every area of his life so pray for him pray for his family continue to lift them up before the Lord Lord and let's let's let's wait on a great testimony from the Lord to see what he's doing in our young people in this day and in this hour amen praise God God bless you Saints so we'll read from Ezekiel 34:12 it says as a Shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered so will I seek out my sheep and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the Cloudy and dark day amen God bless you may be seated next slide today I want to talk about Israel and the church the time of gathering last week we spoke on the time of Jubilee and we brought a thought that there's a sounding of the message in the trumpet of God that is setting all the captives free and it's a time of Jubilee for the church for the Gentile Church to receive the word for their day and to be loosed from the chains of denominational thinking man's interpretation on the word of God that it's a time to be set free from the slavery of all the bondage that religion religion is putting upon the people religion is not what we are we are not religious We Are Spiritual Sons and Daughters of God that have been awakened by the word of God for this day and in this hour and so uh last week we had brother Bill sound the chofar and this morning I'd like him to sound and and and to and to have it sound four times amen because four represents justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and now the Holy Ghost himself that's the that's the hour that we're living in we're living in the time where the Lord Jesus himself is in the church amen praise God we're living in Ephesians 4 where the church is being united and brought together for the perfecting of the body of Jesus Christ amen we're in the time of Revelation 4 where he says come up hither a time where the church is going to be called up so that she can recognize while she's in Heavenly places all all the things that are to come to pass you're living in that age amen we're in first Thessalonians 4 on Amen where the Lord himself shall descend glory to God hallelujah and we which are alive and remain shall not hinder those that sleep we're living in that time Thessalonians 4 amen the voice of the Archangel the Trump of God Amen come ahead brother Bill we want you to sound it four times because this morning we're going to be moving into the thought of gathering a time of gathering go ahead brother Bill [Music] thank you brother Bill praise God hallelujah amen four if you take the number four and you multiply by two you get eight it's not Revelation 10:7 it's Revelation 108 it's not the ministry of Elijah it's the ministry of Elisha amen we've been given a Ministry in this hour to prophesy the word of God by the anointing because we've been given the book and it wasn't just a regular book it was the sealed book of God it was an open book it was unveiled to the Sons and Daughters of God in this day and in this hour and that word that's now in US is calling a resurrection it's calling Sons and Daughters of God wherever they are locked up bound up under denominational bondage under the chains of tradition wherever they are there is a sounding going out right now saying come up hither come out of her my people be ye set free from the from the chains of sin and unbelief amen glory to God God has a time right now where he's calling a people unto the Lord amen praise God let's look at the next scripture it says here in Deuteronomy 7: 6 and 7 now listen what he says here about his people for thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy th God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the Earth the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any other people but ye were the fewest of all people amen glory to God that's why listen don't be looking to you know for for the majority of of people to to believe what it is that you believe when it comes to the word of God you've been given Revelation on the word of God it goes so much uh so much into another realm as as Sons and Daughters of God that when you receive Revelation on God's word you come to realize that you are a minority you can't add people to your church all that we listen we could do all the Outreach and all the and and these are things that we must do we must testify we must reach out we must speak to people we must let them know the word that we've received in this day is the true word of God that liberates and sets you completely free but it's God that opens the understanding it's the Lord that gives Revelation it's the Lord because Revelation when you go to a person and you speak to them and and they're in a sick condition they might have a cancer they might have a a a you know a a disease in their body and you speak to them about the word of God for this hour and Revelation breaks into their heart it's not you going there to lay hands on them and praying over them that that actually did it though this is what we do but it's because the Revelation strikes the individual and they get healed and that is the interpretation of the word and now you try to get that person to deny God yes when God just supernaturally delivered them from whatever condition whatever circumstance there's no uh big sin and small sin it's all sin there's no big sickness and small sickness it's all sickness to God he can heal the L the the worst scenarios to the to the most simple scenarios amen praise God because he's the Lord God Almighty the one and only true and living God hallelujah so here now when we read this scripture I want you to see that God has chosen an Israel and God has also chosen a people for his name's sake see everything runs in parallels so as you as we're reading as we're speaking as we're teaching I want you to see the parallels until we come to the next aspect of this service to where we focus in on the Gentiles and then you will know where we and the Jews the Gentiles and the Jews fit into the whole prophecy of what is taking place in this day and in this hour but listen here the next scripture in Zechariah 12:10 he says in that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem so we we need to see here what it is that God is doing we need to understand that that Israel is a is a chosen people unto the Lord listen I don't I'm not here to you know to to to bash anybody I'm here to bring the word of God and these are scriptures from the word amen and here he says and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David and the House of David shall be as God as the angel of the Lord before them and it shall come to pass in that day that I will see to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem listen it doesn't matter what comes against the nation of Israel God already promised it by his word listen you go back and read the book of Isaiah go back read all the Old Testament books and and just pay attention lately I've been reading you know Old Testament scripture and I can't help but see every everywhere it's all over the place where he's talking about My People Israel I will stand with you I will go before you I will fight your battles I will put clothes on listen when when they were in the wilderness he was the god that was putting clothes on them he was the god that was feeding them he was the god that was fighting their battles amen he was giving them water to drink he was giving them Supernatural Mana from Heaven amen glory to God and you are that people this morning we don't feed on on on written word we're feeding on the logos The Living Word the Christ the same Supernatural Pillar of Fire that moved in the in the wilderness is that same Pillar of Fire that moves in this house here and moves into the pews and goes into your hearts and your lives and searches out the things that you need to be delivered of Amen he's still the same God if you've got a Deliverance that you need this morning you trust him you you you you reach out to him this morning he he'll speak to that need his word shall not return void if you can receive it it will come back Victorious Hallelujah glory to God and so no matter who comes against who comes against the children of Israel listen Hamas a year ago on October the 7th attacked Israel it was an unprovoked attack we need to understand the enemy when you look at them just just simple things here I want to bring I want to show you something about Hamas in particular okay Hamas was the one that that that that was used to launch this massive attack against the nation of Israel and this Hamas is not a word per se as an acronym like they would but in Arabic it stands for Islamic resistance movement and there's a very similar sounding word in Arabic that means Zeal or those who are zealous but let me tell you the irony of this in choosing this name for themselves is that Hamas is also a word in Hebrew and that means brutal unjustified evil Wicked violence amen last October the UT evil atrocities that amas had done to Israel we have firsthand been able to witness it and see the things that they did now we're not fighting against flesh and blood here I hope you're getting my you know uh the the the understanding here this morning okay we are not specifically targeting people we are not specifically speically targeting Muslims we are not attacking the Palestinians we are talking from scripture and don't tell me that those evil atrocities that they did that there's that there's no difference between killing and outright brutal murder slaughtering children women burning children in front of their parents doing all kinds of rape and everything else right there in front of their families that is not war that is just pure unadulterated demonic warfare Hallelujah and this word repeated throughout the Old Testament it's in the Old Testament and it's used to describe horrific acts of violence rape mutilation Slaughter of innocent people you can find it the Hebrew word Hamas the first time in Genesis 611 where it says the word violence and what translated in Hebrew it's Hamas Hamas Hezbollah houthis they are all evil proxies that are operating under the leadership of demon power that is based in Iran it's been identified this is not I'm not bringing something new here that's why it's shocking that you know we see these things the US you know all the all the the the countries they're seeing this very Act of evil they're they're they're they're identified where they're headquartered how they're being supported how they're financially being supported with billions and billions of dollars from countries that are buying their oil and supporting Iran in certain ways it's but you got to understand they are blind to recognize prophecy and to recognize what God is doing the whole world is blinded to this and that's why they will just like nonchalantly allow it to go by happen though Israel does have support from Nations it's it's kind of like a muted support and you can see now that more are starting to turn against Israel than are for Israel this is the time and the season that we're living in and so I don't think it's a coincidence to think that these forces of Darkness that are under these these evil leaderships have chosen this name Hamas Satan knows and has been here fighting against God from before the foundations of the world the Great battle started before we came to this earth it's just manifesting here on the Earth but there's a plan that shows what the end is going to be amen and so all these players and all these demonic influences and powers and principalities they're not stupid in the way that they're you know naming themselves and putting themselves out there mocking the people even saying right outright death to Israel death to America imagine it's in their slogans death to America death to Israel and they can go and speak these things and then outright attack and send in over 180 ballistic missiles into Israel and stand back and say well you know what you got to be careful how you how you handle this response you got listen we're living in the time where prophecy overrides man's decision Visions they are being governed by the word of God whether they know it or not and you are blessed to be able to recognize what it is that God is doing in this day to realize that that God has provided a way for you out of this mess okay it's common understanding you can go into almost any Christian church and they'll tell you that there's going to be a Great Tribulation the only problem is is they don't really believe it they'll talk about it but the majority of them don't really believe it don't really want to talk about it they're afraid to expose it because hey what does that mean for me well if it really if you were really concerned then you would search the scriptures for in them you have what's found to be eternal life but you need to search the scriptures you need to find your placing in the word of God Amen praise God hallelujah so there is a difference in war between executing and and and doing the the the the atrocities that they're doing as opposed to an you know self-defense War which is what Israel is doing right now sure there's going to be innocent people that are killed and it's terrible it's not good but they must defend themselves they're a small country and if you look at their at their map you can see that just a small little sliver and they're surrounded by by the enemy all around them it's it's Muslim um you know uh people that are against Israel all kinds of different spiritual powers and dominions and principalities and they're all focused on one thing annihilate Israel they can't do it and so while this prophecy is all in progress we are under a prophecy we are under a prophecy that is drawing us together go to the next slide and so we're going to talk a little bit here about the time of gathering the Gentile church because when that sound of the trumpet that is now being sounded through the five-fold ministry through the through through the mighty Angel himself that has come down to call a people unto his name while all of this is going on in the world there's a people that are hearing their V their their name being called there's a people that are able to respond to the word of God it's a uniting time there's a uniting going on all over the world there's the you know what was it in 2018 the pope was in in uh in uh uh the meeting there with the World Council of churches and trying to unite the churches together asking them and it was their seven their seven the anniversary there's the number 70 again he addressed the World Council of churches Central Committee and other delegates calling on Christians to work together in charity and to overcome the cultural and partisan interests uh um uh partisan interests he also said that Christians should not appear indifferent to those other so-called Christians denominations religions drawing them into a Unity of the World Council of churches well we know that this is supposed to happen this is scripture being fulfilled the United Nations Gathering Together mostly against Israel now and the true church is gathering into the body of Jesus Christ so that she can fulfill her part because the Gentile Church cannot be here when when when the the the angel of the Lord sends Moses and Elijah over to the 144,000 the nation of Israel the Gentile Church cannot be here and therefore there's a call and a gathering that's going on right now within the Gentile church and this is what we want to focus on this morning let's go to our next slide we're going to read some scriptures to lay in just some simple Foundation here Mark 4 and he taught them many things by Parables Jesus always spoke many times by Parables and said unto them in his Doctrine hearken behold there went out a s to seow and it came to pass as he sowed some fell by the wayside and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up and some fell on Stony ground where it had not much Earth and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of Earth but when the sun was up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away and some fell among thorns and Thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no fruit he's talking about the kingdom of God here the whole Plan of Redemption so put your mind into that thought into that frame of thought as we're reading here and other fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased and brought forth some 30 some 60 and some 100 let's go to the next scripture so here now he says in Mark 4:13 to20 and he said unto them because they were asking him after he had told them the parable they said well you know uh can you give us the interpretation of the parable you know we we want to understand and this is what he said and he said unto them know ye not this Parable don't you understand understand what it is that I'm saying and how then will you know all Parables you see unless you are you unless you come under the spirit of Revelation it's going to be very difficult to really understand the the the the meaning behind all of The Parables that are written in the scriptures but one thing that you've been given in this hour is the spirit of Revelation by the Holy Ghost to recognize what the word means there's there's a difference between between written word and spoken word spoken word when it's received by Revelation you receive the meaning of what is being spoken and it's the mind of God behind that word so the swer Seth the word notice what he's sowing and these are they by the wayside where the word is sown but when they have heard Satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was swn in their hearts and these are they likewise which are sown on Stony ground who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness and have no root in them no now we're going to talk about what that root is no root in themselves and so endureth but for a time a lot of people hear the word oh wow man that sounds interesting boy I wonder what that you know that's that's really cool like I I need to do certain things do I need to load up on food and and uh should I load up on some supplies because tribulation is coming and uh you know should I do this and should I do that you see they don't have a revelation on the word of God and have no root in themselves and so endure but for a Time afterwards when Affliction or persecution arises from the for the word's sake immediately they are offended you know all of a sudden you tell your friends and you oh I heard that God sent a a a a prophet in the 20th century you know you need to read this look at this you know it's it God sent a prophet you know to to fulfill the word of God these are scriptures that pertain to this day and this hour and you know he was he was the messenger and one of the Angels the seven angels that was sent through the seven Church ages and all of a sudden your friends and family are looking at you and wondering what are you doing I did a search online the guy's he he's they call him he's a cult they say it's a cult because the first search that they did they'll go in there and they'll put William brandom is it a scand and right away because a lot of people you know they're getting scammed these days on all kinds of stuff they get phone calls they get textes they get emails and the first thing they'll do they'll go to Google and they'll put in the name and scam Bingle there it comes up oh yeah it's a scam it's a fraud right away you see but not the Sons and Daughters of God there's something in you that's been placed there from before the foundations of the world let's move on here and these are they which are sown among Thorns such as hear the word and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lust of other things entering in choke the word oh what a time you know this is happening this is a reality that if that word isn't solidly anchored and you are not constantly feeding on the word of God you're constantly reading the word of God you're you're coming into the house of the Lord you're supporting the ministry you're in your position listen you are a human being with an attribute of God inside of you but that attribute is like the camels when when uh when you know they those camels needed to be fed so that eleazer could get his bride Rebecca to Isaac Hallelujah you need to be feeding on the word of God you need to be coming into the house of the Lord you need you need spoken word you need you need the word to be spoken God chose the foolishness of preaching do you know that preaching it's not just Faith to understand the word that that you're given you're given the ability to overcome you're given Faith cometh by hearing and that word that's coming in you not only is it is it saving you it's healing you it's restoring you it's delivering you it's breaking the chains that Satan puts on your life you need the Living manifested Word of God in this day and in this hour Hallelujah and these are they which are sown on good ground such as hear the word receive it and bring forth fruit some 30 some 60 some 100 some gets so excited they'll go out and my God they'll add 30 to the church some will add 60 to the church some will add a 100 to the church because of their testimony it's it's because it's a reality in their lives and because there's life in the word that they've received life is the only thing that can bring forth more life that's why if the word is mixed with anything but the pure word it cannot bring forth life that's why the seven Church ages all the messengers why do you think through the Reformation why do you think Satan who is the devil that comes into the midst to seow the terrs we're going to read on here why do you think that that every Church age fell into apostasy fell into deception went off the word because they took man's interpretation on the word of God instead of keeping the pure unadulterated word of God to allow himself to be his own interpreter to the point that by the time they reach the Leo Dean Church age Jesus Christ was outside knocking on the door saying if anybody can hear me in all those denominational churches I'm knocking but you're going to need to come out you're going to need to come out of that situation you're going need to come out of those bondages out of those denominational uh theologian teachings of the scripture putting their own interpretation on the word trinitarian uh all kinds of of of scripture that's not scripture because they have no Revelation on the word of God hallelujah next scripture in Matthew 13 now listen he says here so the Servants of the householder came and said unto him sir did not thou so good seed in thy field from whence then hath it tears listen you ever go into a field that hasn't been properly taken care of it's so full of weeds that you can't even see the real plants anymore and what do you think Satan's tactics are especially in this this age that we're living in right now where where where this is information overload this is where there's so many interpretations on God and the what God is and God is you know it's the universe God is uh uh you know uh in in in Idols God is in in listen people will worship something because it's in them to worship I don't care even an atheist is religious because they're worshiping the fact that there is no such thing is God and they've got other people that believe the same thing and they'll get together online and they'll they'll they'll they'll have their church and they're say oh no we're not religious oh yes you are because you believe in something to the point where you've United with others that believe the same thing it's just that what you believe is absolutely going to produce death because the only thing that produces life is word of God amen the unadulterated word eternal life is only found in God's word not man's interpretation on the word man begins something there'll be an end to it but if God starts it there's no end to it hallelujah praise God and so why is there so many tears we're living in a world and you you know listen you're a minority you're a minority you are the wheat you're the ones that have taken God's word that that that receive God's word and and doesn't believe anything else but the word of God because you know that's the only safe place in this day and in this hour he says an enemy had done this the servant said unto him wil thou then that we go and gather them up but he said no lest while you gather up the tears you root up also the wheat with them and that's why we're not you know we're we're we're not people that are you know that that that we we force ourselves under people and start you know ripping sin out of people's lives and tell them oh you're you're lost you're this you're that let the word do that let them search the scriptures I remember it wasn't when when I came you know became a part of this ministry my brothers and sisters were showing me so much love and so much grace that that and and it what was it it was God showing me how much he loved me how much he believed in in what he had placed in me that it would not return void and he nourished that word that was in me he nourished and fed the the the the desire of my heart to to to worship and to know God in because there was something already there from before the foundations of the world am it wasn't it wasn't forced and oh you got to believe this and you got to believe that and you need to come to my church you're lost listen the word will gently tell them that what they believe is false or they will reject the word and just go on as they are it's as simple as that and so that's why we're not he says let them grow together until the Harvest until this day because it's the God is going to do something in the end time he says and in the time of the Harvest I will say to the Reapers Gather ye together first the tears and bind them in bundles to burn them all right but gather the wheat into the barn listen this great economical move that's going on all over the world on uniting the churches and everything else if it's not based and foundationally structured upon the pure unadulterated word of God it will fall it will go into a great burning okay now what that is is is is you know they're going to go into the Lake of Fire and a lot of people think oh they're going to go into a hell and it's a burning hell and it's a fire no the Lake of Fire is God that's what the Lake of Fire is he's just going to consume back those that were not Sons and Daughters of God from before the foundations of the world there are children of God on the earth and there are children of the devil it's in the scriptures I'm only telling you what's in the scriptures and so you need to recognize this a lot of people say oh no no no no that's that's you're preaching hell and you know Hellfire religion I'm preaching the word of God you got a choice which which which will you choose today if you've got a uh you know if you've got the ability to choose are you going to choose to be one of those that are deceived and and caught under the traditions of man or are you interested in knowing what the truth is for this day and in this hour Hallelujah let's go to the next scripture here let's move on he answered and said unto them he that sth the good seed is the son of man God has a plan of redemption Saints this is not something that just started today this is something that he started before the foundations of the world in his mind he's just expressing it in the form of a parable he's just he's just revealing what it is that he's doing he says here the field is the world and he says the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tears are what the children of the wicked who was the Wicked one from the very beginning who was the liar at the very beginning who was that serpent that beguiled Eve at the very beginning you're Jesus himself stood there before the Pharisees and all the priests of that day and they were they were saying to him we are the children of Abraham we are the sons and daughters of Abraham we are the Seed of Abraham the Lord Jesus God made flesh they didn't realize who was standing there speaking to them look look what he said he says you're not the children of Abraham if you were the children of Abraham you'd to recognize me because he spoke of me you see he he had a revelation of who I was you've got all law you've been you you you've been blinded to the word of God and he says you're of your father the devil who was a liar from that Wicked one who was a liar from the beginning who was the one that was the liar from the beginning and told Eve no you're not going to die if you partake of this you see this is the deception amen we know who the enemy is the enemy that sowed them is the devil and the Harvest is the end of the world and we are in the end times it's not that the world is going to blow up it's not that the world is going to blow up completely and there's going to be nobody and everybody's going to be annihilated no there's a lot more to the Plan of Redemption but we need to know and recognize where we are at now and what it is that God requires of us let's move on here amen listen brother brandom here in modern events made clear by prophecy then if you are a son of God or a daughter of God you were in God all the time but he knew what bed and time that you'd be planted Oh Glory to God Amen oh there's a time and a season for all things glory to God and he says so now you're made a creature a Son of God manifested son or daughter of God to meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate the true and living God of this hour look what he says the the message that's coming forth in this time boy I'll tell you brother brandham was saying that back in 1965 look what's coming forth now Sons and Daughters of God that are coming into a a a perfect faith and Revelation that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world she's coming into that perfect Faith amen you are done there before the foundations of The World God knew exactly what he was doing when he came to [Music] you listen here I'm going to read on in a message a greater than Solomon is here brother Braham says all the father hath given me will come and I'm happy for that so we don't know who is who and who is not it's not up to us to say oh there's a Son of God oh there's a serpent seed oh there's a unbeliever oh there's a makeb Believer no every church has three kinds of Believers the True Believer the make believer and the unbeliever and they'll all receive the rain falls on the just and the unjust and sometimes you come into the house of the Lord and the spirit of God moves and starts speaking and and hallelujah praise God just like some of those that fell on the on the Stony ground they they get excited by the word of God but then when they leave on Sunday afternoon Monday morning they're cursing cheating stealing lying committing all kinds of unbelief drinking smoking all the attributes of sin because listen those things are not sin those are the attributes of sin if you fed on the word and the word has has anchored inside of you and it's and and and it's and it's a reality your your life cannot remain the same because it's the living word that has possessed you and the Living Word brings forth life it brings forth Deliverance your life starts to manifest Deliverance it doesn't manifest unbelief if it's if if you go out Monday morning and you start manifesting unbelief you you no word anchored inside of you it wasn't it was just you just got caught into the emotion it's like a lot of time people go into church and you know the way the preacher preaches the word of God and delivers the word of God he can get the people so excited you know because of the emotion that he puts behind the word of God to the point where you know people will will get caught up into the emotion and then you'll talk to them after the service and you say praise God brother did you enjoy that oh glory to God do you remember what the scripture was do you remember the thought behind it they'll look at you kind of funny you see they got caught into the moment of the emotion but they didn't catch the word the life the aspect of the word that that that transforms them that Chang them that's why one word spoken to you this morning that that that that meets and and attacks a certain situation in your life and you say that's me I receive it that's me Lord oh God that's me I need it right now Lord and and it's because you've come into a realization you you've died out to yourself you've died out to the pride you you died out to all the things all the lies of the enemy because he's holding you in that in that condition let the pure word of God come into your life when it speaks to that need you will immediately manifest Deliverance you can never be the same that's why listen the worlds were framed by the word of God you know that without the word of God there there's nothing you know that it's it's because of God's word that anything exists and it's because of God's word that even when he went to the children of Israel and he gave them the the the the Ten Commandments it's because he had to put his word into their lives so that they could recognize what it was that they were because they were living like Savages they were killing one another they were beating one another they had no understanding of of God but when God came he gave them his word and he sent them his word and his word healed them Hallelujah his word is a lamp unto my feet glory to God his word is the reality that when you receive it and it comes into your life you are delivered you can't remain the same way you face the enemy because you know that you know oh glory to God hallelujah I'm so happy so we don't know who is who and who's not we just scatter forth the seed that's all we do some Falls by the wayside some Falls this way and that way but some does fall on good ground that's right Hallelujah ground that's been prepared by God to receive his seed that's why listen we read it the seed is the word in the beginning was the word in the word was with God and the Word was God am without the word there's nothing nothing can nothing can can can be held together the universe and all of the laws that God has placed that's why people that deny God deny the intelligence of God's word even their own ability to speak is because God gave them the ability to communicate do you know that it's only human beings that can speak with words to one another you don't hear chimpanzees speaking we got logic in the words that we speak and God has placed his thought into his word and that's why when it's received which is called by Revelation not by teaching of man listen when when when he asked the people when he come down he says to his disciples who do the people say that I am he knew he was God he knew the word that he was fulfilling but he wanted to know what what are the people saying about me and they turn and say oh some are saying you're Jeremiah some are saying you're Elijah this saying that you're you're a risen up Prophet this and that and he looked to Peter he says but who do you say that I am you see something was revealed directly into Peter's heart and you've got to have the same kind of experience if you want Deliverance in in this word you got to have that same experience come into you and and all of a sudden Peter immediately Thou Art the Christ you are the God you are God you are the word you're the Messiah that that they've been talking about that was to come and Jesus said Flesh and Blood didn't give you this and that's why it's not going to be you just reading the word of God oh I'll just stay home and read the word of God I'll just listen to the tapes meanwhile the logos is in the house of the Lord this morning he wants to speak to you he wants to connect to the word that he's placed inside of you so that you can manifest him in this day and in this hour because when you manifest him you manifest the Rapture brother Bram said the Rapture is a revelation so if you don't have a revelation on the Rapture you're going to believe all kinds of teachings you're going to go to YouTube and you're going to listen to this one well that one sounds good oh this one sounds even oh is it premim you know what the tribulation could be pre or it could be after you see it's all a guessing game but let you get one time into the house of the Lord and the logos starts to seek out that prepared ground where seed was planted in in prepared ground listen to brother BR he says any seed has to have its ground of course therefore all he forne see he already knew what was going to happen amen by the forn knowledge of God he could predestinate you unto the adoption of the Sons and Daughters of God because he had a plan he knew what he was going to do this is from the message works his faith expressed he says now notice Jesus said again about the seed some fell on Rock others in mixed ground see over where uh there's Thorns thistles and everything else it couldn't grow and others on good ground good ground good soil which had been prepared already prepared so don't you think that it was an accident when somebody walked up to you and said hey have you heard that there's a message in the land that's calling the church out of the churches what oh yeah you see when Jesus was here on Earth he was calling his disciples out of a out of a religious group group of of of a couple of million people in that day and there was only a dozen of them that actually recognized really yes it's always been a minority let me ask you a simple question my friend have you been baptized well of course I got baptized as a baby yeah but wait a minute can I show you in the scripture where there was 8,000 baptisms just after the day of Pentecost when Peter who had the the the the Holy Ghost had the reveal word for his day he had the instruction for the people how they would receive the Holy Ghost can I show you in the scripture what it says in Acts 238 well sure go ahead and you show it to them and I remember when I read that and I saw that and I seen it it was like an explosion took place within my heart don't ask me to explain it but all of a sudden I saw it as clear as day I realized I said oh my God that's when I went to Pastor Simon I said Pastor Simon I need the Holy Ghost I need to be baptized I realized that the Scripture it come to life to me it was a reality what was that that wasn't because of my ability to read anybody can read acts 238 but let the anointed logos of God's word the spirit that's behind that word speak to you just one time and deal with you in whatever it is that you're overcoming right now for me at that time it was a drug addiction and when I went into that water and I came out of that water don't ask me how he delivered me but all I can tell you is that that was the last moment that that demon power of drug addiction had any hold over my life why because he did it he delivered I didn't do anything I had believed all kinds of different teachings and all kind I was going to all kinds of different seminars on on how to Chang my life because I was not satisfied with the life that I had and that's why the drugs would satisfy me and give me a break for a while so that it would Release Me from the from the from the from the heartache and the burden of trying to figure this life out but then one Revelation one Revelation from God started the whole process and that's all it takes in your life and that same process is still happening today not just in my life should be happening in your life you should be having those same experiences today he's the same yesterday today and forever you got something you need deliverance from he can deliver you he can set you free but you need to come God's provided way you need to identify that you are prepared ground Hallelujah that you can receive that word and you can bring forth maybe 30 60 or 100 Hallelujah bringing forth fruit many of you can fellowship with me on this thought listen you knew you were different he says uh when you was a little boy or a little girl you would walk around and there would there would be certain things that that would just when where it wouldn't bother other people but it would bother you yes sir you remember that yes can you identify when I read that I identifi with that I I couldn't understand I'd be I'd be with with certain friends and I and I hung out with a Rowdy gang I'm telling you these guys they were just they would be training all day long so that they could go out Friday night and pick a fight all week they were pumping iron and doing their you know this and that so that they could go to the bars and they could stand there and I remember I used to hang around with this group it was called La Familia which is the family you know like like a like a like a small little mob group and and we would go from place to place we'd be in Hamilton at the bars over there and this and that and you know that there was there was a lot of brawls and fights and one time actually a good friend of mine got into a fight and over absolutely nothing just because they nudged like this and the guy turned around what's your problem no what's your problem on the ground kicked my buddy in the head so many times dead right there on the spot I wasn't there there there was other fights where they tore up the whole place I wasn't there I kept saying to my friends said how in the world I just left and this all happened after you see God was in your life and he's in your life and he's keeping you even right now because you got a purpose you got a purpose God has a reason why he's planted that seed into your life he's gathered in that seed right now he wants to he wants to shift through all the tears and all the the the the the different uh uh schools of teaching out there because he's got Sons and Daughters of God that are still trapped but he's Gathering them in it's time to gather it's time to gather he's gathered Israel already Israel's already been gathered they're in their Homeland praise God hallelujah he says here he says you would just walk around and there would be certain things that would just wear wouldn't bother the other kids it seemed like there was something in you that cried out there was God somewhere yet you were a sinner you remember that certainly now what was it that was the little form of life in you back then this is not something that God is just doing now if you're a son or daughter of God you were out there on on YouTube and you're listening in onto this word and you're you're you're just wondering what's striking your heart it's because God already knew you God already started on you from before the foundations of the world you just got to come into your time you just got to come into your season where the word of God the life of the lust takes a hold of you and it starts to speak back the word of God back to God Amen and he says certainly he says after a while you heard the gospel maybe you went to church you picked out this and that and went from denomination to denomination but one day you being a part of God you had to be a part of the word and when you heard the word you know where you come from you know what was the truth you were always the seed was in you always glory to God Amen you come from God you go back to God you can't go to God unless you came from God hallelujah you were always the seed you were always the seed seen the word and and that was in you that was before the foundations of the world saw the word and you came to the word that's why Faith cometh by hearing the word hallelujah glory to God Christ The Mystery of God revealed he says now you you see the seals when he was in his meditor work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in this book would be in him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him and if you are in his word then you are a manifestation of him in the day that you receive the word amen hallelujah listen if you can't see Jesus Christ from Genesis to Revelation you've missed something right everything that we've been speaking here on and all the scripture that we've read it's all about his Plan of Redemption everything surrounding his great plan and if you can't see Jesus Christ is God from Elohim the self-existent one in the very beginning to the god that's in Revelations 22 where it says and the spirit and the bride say come it doesn't say and God the Father and Jesus and the Holy Spirit say they come it says the spirit which is what the Holy Spirit which is what Jesus Christ which is what the word and if you are in the word and the word is in you then you're going to be one of those that's going to say on that day that I know that I am in the father and the father is in me and I in you you'll be able to recognize that you are the word manifest Hallelujah glory to God it's always been his Plan of Redemption it's always been his word it was his word in Abraham it was his word in Abel in in in Adam it was his word in in Seth all the way down it was his word in Noah it was his word in in Abraham it was his word in uh Isaac and Joseph and and all the Sons and Daughters of God all the way down through the Old Testament it was always his word coming into manifestation in a particular time and season and when you can recognize that you believe the word and you're seeing it in your day it's because you are the word that is to manifest the Rapture because the message of this hour is the rapture to take the church out before the Great Tribulation when the church goes out Moses and Elijah are going to come on the scene and they're going to go directly to Israel and they're going to start to preach Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen they're not going to preach a different message they're going to preach this word and the same deliverer that delivered you and me is going to deliver the 144,000 as a as a as a nation not individually as a nation Israel will be converted in one day they're going to recognize the Messiah is going to show up and they're going to say where did you get those nail prints he's going to say in the house of my friends they're going to realize what you mean it was us yes and that is going to fulf fulfill the scriptures and it's going to fulfill everything about Israel and then there's more to come after that after the 144,000 go up into the into their Resurrection then comes the Great Tribulation where there's going to be some serious Wars on the earth there's still going to be Nations on the earth when we go here there's going to be hardly anybody that's going to really notice only those that are your friends and you know those that are your family are they going to be calling they're going to be wondering wait a minute here how come I haven't heard from them this week and then they're watching the radio they're listening to the to to the radio they're watching the TV and there's all kinds of missing people reports you've seen it in the movies it's going to happen it's a reality Saints it's something that's going to happen amen praise God glory to God listen I'm going to wind it down here Christ The Mystery of God revealed what was it that God was trying to do here what is it that he was doing when he planted that word in you is because he wanted to express himself and Christ The Mystery of God revealed first to express himself completely God in Christ so he came as God in flesh Emmanuel will God With Us second to have preeminence by this in his church which is for him to come and take control within the the the boundaries of the church and this is what we are under right now amen glory to God and then which is also the lifegiver to the word the seed to vindicate that seed in that season you see that's what he came to do he came to awaken the seed of himself in you you can't even believe this word unless he's in you to believe it that's why without the Bible says without faith it's impossible to please God what's he saying there unless you can repeat back to him his thoughts that he's given to you by Revelation you're just quoting scripture the listen the letter it can kill but when the Holy Spirit comes upon you to read the letter it brings it to life and that's what he's been trying to do his Spirit coming upon you upon that seed that like he said here so that he says in his church which is his body he says uh he which is the lifegiver to the word the seed to vindicate that seed for That season for which season this season this season there's seed in you that's got to overcome amen there's seed in you that's got to let drop away all the sin and unbelief in your life the only way it's going to happen is if that word that life of the word gets in you and it awakens you to recognize that this is the truth this is absolutely the truth I can't see it any other way glory to God Amen so here now he says first so he continues on here Christ The Mystery of God revealed he says Christ he says first to express himself completely God in Christ second to have preeminence by his church and his church which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them he's expressing life through you that's why don't take it for granted what you've received Saints don't make it complacent in your life feed on on the word of God every day you you you you don't realize what that does for you you don't realize how powerful it is when you read the word you don't realize how powerful it is when you come into the house of the Lord and receive the word you you you come with expectation and you come with faith in your heart it changes you it delivers you it sets you free sickness Falls away from you just automatically things because the word was sent to deliver his people and that's why you need the word for this day and for this hour you can't live on a on a word from that day gone by you can't be just quoting oh God sent a prophet God sent a prophet yeah but what did he send the prophet for to turn your heart back to the original word so that you could receive the word and awaken the seed of God the attribute of God the part of the word that you were ordained to be in in 2020 4 a lot of you have still not fully awakened to recognize your part in the word of God but God is is shaking God is Gathering God is sifting through God is saying wake up come out of your sleep and slender that's why Ephesians 4 and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for what for the perfecting of the Saints we are now in a maturity state where we are being perfected for the Rapture amen praise God listen what it says for the perfecting for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ listen God is going to he's going to sift out every demon I'm telling you right now I'm praying I'm believing for this church God didn't put me here to be the pastor of this church just to be in a position I don't need more positions I I couldn't even understand why he put me here with all the positions that I already had but I said Lord it doesn't matter whatever your will is whatever your plan is you if you start this work in my life you're going to finish it you're going to keep me and but I come to realize that this position holds holds a seriousness I I I got I I've I've never been so stirred like I have been and I've never fought battles like I've been fighting in the last six months I can tell you right now God gave me a little honeymoon the first six months I said Lord thank you very much I thought oh wow praise God you know feeling nice inspiration you know but all of a sudden the enemy starts attacking my God why because I started to get serious I started to realize wait a minute here wait a minute here this what's going on here this look look at Israel look look at the condition of the world look at look at the condition of the people look what's going on in the United States right now now in a week from now we don't know what's going to happen we've got a country that's fully divided split right in half completely like night and day how can a country listen unless two walk together and agree how can they walk together we're living in a time where there's a gathering going on but the rest of the world is gathering into Clans into tribes into into teachings of man men they're they're they're they're they're they're stealing the word of God out of the schools they're they're they're stealing our gender identity away that we are Sons and Daughters we are men and women male and female they're stealing all kind they're putting so much confusion into the people's minds so that they don't know who they actually are but you as a Son of God as a logos son the attribute of God when you come to that word you come to realize that wait a minute here I know who I am I realize what God is doing I I can't help but see it it's just clear as a bell this word is a lamp unto my feet this word is my shield and my buckler without it listen if I I can study all kinds of things but the minute that I start to look to psychology I'm going to need a psychiatrist who's also seeing a psychiatrist you know that that's a fact a lot of them a lot of psychiatrists have psychiatrists yes because they don't realize what they're dealing with you see they need the word they need to understand that the word has to have a meaning in their hearts today they're taking the word and they're they're they're making it of none effect to the people because they'll accept anything they're replacing the word they're coming up with their own words their own interpretations on words and it changes the meaning behind the words and it changes everything to the individual do you know that if you if you you know you know you've heard the the people say oh he talked me out of it why because there's power in words there's power when you can when you can talk somebody out of something somebody can talk them into something but not with the word of God because the word of God is life it's it's it's Eternal it discerns the thoughts and intent of the heart that's why you can't fool God God knows your heart God knows what you mean when you tell some listen when you tell lies that's coming back to you I can tell you right now it's going to come back to you and it's going to haunt you it's gon to it's going to come back because a lie when it goes out it's got to return to snap and and to hit you back and to to distort everything it's going to ruin your life it's going to ruin people are not going to trust you anymore a liar how can you trust a liar you can't trust anything that that comes out of his mouth anymore and that destroys your reputation it destroys your ability to have any kind of effect that's why you got to watch the words that you speak you got to be careful how you speak those words to people and how you interpret things to people how you share your testimony share it but share it with a reality don't be putting so much supern Supernatural this Supernatural that Supernatural this people are wondering this guy's cuckoo show me something simple show me how you were delivered this is what God did for me I don't I can't give you an understanding on it but God did it I believe God's word it's become a reality to me amen we don't we want to share the gospel of Christ in a way that's that's a reality that's something real that's not something that you know oh you know he's he goes to that church for 6 weeks and then you'll see him at a different church then you'll see him at another church it's because there's no foundation on the pure word of God let the word anchor into their hearts I'm going to finish up here five more minutes let's go to the next scripture we're going to close this up real fast because I want to get something H Allelujah Jeremiah 3110 it says hear the word of the Lord all ye nations and declare it in the Isles of far off and say he that scattereth Israel will gather him and keep him as a Shepherd doth the flock amen praise God hallelujah listen to brother brandom he says now 2700 years ago since that time he said in the third day we'll be gathered again after two days and in the third day will be gathered again and receive life in his sight do you see the promise the hour perfectly wrote on the wall we see where we are living now in the Homeland waiting for the Feast of trumpets Israel now in their Homeland or the recognizing of the atonement to wait to wait for the coming to mourn for the rejection the first time that they rejected it they're in the Homeland for that waiting what are they all everything is positionally placed okay everything is in place right now for Israel they're in their Homeland they're they're they're defending their Homeland amen praise God but here we are in our position now listen here he says he gathered Israel the three days in the third day he said he would do it 2700 years have passed in that third day he said he would gather them together and he's done it he said he'd make known the way of life there you are just waiting now for the bride to get out of the way so they can come home the two prophets Hebrew prophets that'll recognize amen praise God let's go to the next slide so we're talking about Israel is God's time piece and in Matthew 24:31 he said Jesus he said he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect this is the hour we're living in for the Four Winds from one end of Heaven to the other now learn a parable of the Fig Tree when his branch is yet tender and put it forth leaves you know that summer is nigh so likewise ye when you see all these things know that it is near even at the doors verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled now I want you to understand here Jesus was talking to the Jews he was talking to the children of Israel at that time and so he was talking about a time when the when because he knew that that there was going to be an absolute desolation of of of Jerusalem okay and in ad70 he they went in there and they completely the Romans went in there and completely annihilated Solomon's Temple completely wiped out everything and Scattered the the the the children of Israel that they could not have anymore their Homeland until 1948 now Jesus was talking about a future event here and I believe he was talking about this day this time where Israel is now in her Homeland because the Fig Tree is Israel how many knows that brother Braham said that very often and we know that through the scriptures you can go back and read where God speaks about about the Fig Tree and even Jesus spoke about the Fig Tree but he said when you see this happening that generation I believe he was talking about this generation now if we look at Generations you know a lot of people say oh but a generation I used to think oh a generation is 40 years or 50 years guess what if you were living in the days of Noah generation would have been maybe 150 years if you were living in the time of Adam and Seth you might have lived 800 years okay but here I want you to listen here as we close now because I'm going to end with with this okay listen here now brother braham's speaking here in the seventh seal he says now when he said you see these Jews begin to put forth their buds Out Over Yonder when that Israel begins to turn back getting into her country when she gets there the church is ready to Rapture okay now he was saying that back in 1965 1963 in the seventh seal there's only three and a half years left until the end of the old world and she goes into total chaos and it comes to the Millennium and to the new Earth said even at the door 1,000 years on Earth is only one day with God in three and a half years what would it what would it be it would be like the blink of an eye so many seconds in God's time that's the reason he said it's at the door verily I say unto you that this generation shall not be consumed done away with this people until all these things are what what won't be done away with they've tried to kill the Jew off the Earth all the time they'll never be able to do it but notice the very generation of Jews that seen the return back to Palestine that generation would see these things happen and just the last two years she was fully become a nation with her own money and whatever there she is now I want to take you to the next scripture here go to Psalms 90 and we're closing here just a few minutes bear with me and we'll get done he says now this was the only Psalm that Moses wrote and he says here Lord thou H has been our Dwelling Place in all generations see he he recognized Moses had a revelation of who Christ was who God was he was their Dwelling Place he knew before the mountains were brought forth or even thou Hast formed the earth and the world even from Everlasting to Everlasting Thou Art the Lord Jesus Hallelujah Thou Art God but he goes on and he says here the days of our years are three score years and 10 and if by reason of strength they be for scorn Years yet is their strength labor and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away now I'll read it to you in the Amplified version now what I'm talking now we're talking about a generation here and we're looking at how long a generation is the Days of Our Lives interpreted Amplified Version Psalms 910 it says the Days of Our Lives 70 years or even if because of strength 80 years yet their pride in additional years is only labor and sorrow for it is gone and we fly away oh there's going to be a flying away one morning let me tell you Saints glory to God hallelujah go to the next slide real quick real quick this here is a gentile dispensation I'm not going to spend any time on it but it just shows you all the way from the book of Acts when the Holy Spirit came down all the way to where we are right now which is 1 Thessalonians 4 1 Corinthians 15 where the bride is going to be taken in a Rapture and then after this it goes into and it goes to the Jews we go for a three and a half year honeymoon and the Jews are going to receive their two Prophets next slide just showing you the time here that's gone by this the 70 weeks of Daniel if you look closely here you can't really see it you know perfectly but you can see here that Daniel's prophecy to the end it's all you know if you want a copy of this just let me know send me a text message I'd be happy to email it to you um you know you can pick it up right off the internet okay it's done by Pastor Ron m malbo okay but it's it's a nice illustration of the times and the season and where we're at but here's what I want to show you that the Holy Spirit showed me and and Saints I'm just I'm just bringing what the Lord laid on my heart so take this and and understand that that you know it's it's just God has always put it on me that prophecy is something that that I've always been watching I'm watching for prophecy that's why you saw you know I ministered on the on the sun and the moon and the and the and the eclipses and and and the timing of the of the of the the cloud and all the breakdown of all those things and the hour that we're living in but here now watch Israel in the time piece a chart and a table of Israel's life expectancy which I got which was right from a a a good source from the United Nations projections okay also included right through the year 201100 you can look this up on the internet but the current life expectancy for Israel in 2024 is 83.6 three years 83. 63 years the life expectancy in 23 was 83.4 n so life expectancy is actually in a in in a bit of an uptrend right now so let's go to the next slide because this I just wanted to draw out draw out here where are we at Israel became a nation in May of 1948 and that was the time that the Fig tree was putting forth its buds and the average life expectancy in 2024 if we look at Psalms 90 and we look and we see how it says that you know between 75 or you know 70 to 80 years and we use that formula today it's between 73 and 83 as a reference and you add those two numbers together which equals 156 you divide it by two equals 78 when you take the year of 1948 and you add 78 years to it we come to 226 I'm not telling you that that's exactly the date that it's going to happen the year it's going to happen the scripture didn't say it said we wouldn't know the the the hour but I believe that we're coming into the very last moments of this season and if this points to 2026 this generation will end around 2026 to 2030 or maybe 2025 we don't know but all I know is that this generation that he was talking about is going to see that event of Israel receiving their two prophets they're going to witness they're going to these things are going to happen what time are we living in Saints brother brandham said that Israel was allotted 1,954 years up until when they rejected Messiah and then it went to the Gentiles and if you take the Gentile dispensation and you go 1900 and brother Brenham talked about at that time when he when he did the formula he says he he believed that it would all come and and happened right around 1977 and he was looking for something to happen right around that time that all things would come together but he never said thus sayeth the Lord he said now this is me but he knew something was cooking because he was looking at the time and the season and the and the and the and the the 70 weeks of Daniel and he was putting it all together and if you add 1954 to the time when Israel okay rejected the word you had 1954 years when they rejected Messiah you'll come and if if the number was 1977 which brother Brenham said it was then you add 50 years to 1977 which is a Pentecost which is our Jubilee you'll come to 2027 I'm not saying that that's all I'm trying to say is where are we at how close are we are we are we recognizing ing the hour that we're living in are we are we see let the musicians come are we seeing the the the time and the season that we're living in are we taking H our our walk with God serious are we are we looking to to improve our walk with God to get closer to God to let others know what the Lord is doing in this day and in this hour because we're just looking for that last one remember the Gentile dispensation could already be over it could already be over Saints all that the that that's to be in there they just need some perfecting they need some some some some tweaking they need some some Deliverance in their lives they need to be placed into the body of Christ to the place where God wants them to be so that they can manifest the portion of the word that God wants to manifest because he called you for a purpose amen what time are we living in Saints what an hour amen we were thinking 2000 then we were thinking 2015 then we were thinking 2020 then we were thinking but then you know as the time goes on all of a sudden the inspiration starts to come and I believe that we are going to receive faith in this word that's going to bring us right into Heavenly places where we are going to see so much of the word he's going to reveal so much because remember this is all a progression of his plan and his plan will never stop it's going to progress us until we go into the Rapture until we spend three and a half years with him and then come back to have to fight and and Reign and Rule with Jesus Christ in the Millennium what an hour what a plan I'm just so glad to be a part of this Saints I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk this Pilgrim way I'm rejoicing to know that the Holy Spirit has given the the the ability given this church this group of people here the ability to recognize the word and to say Amen to the revealed word of this day and of this hour and allow it to over uh possess them and take control and lead them and guide them regardless of the battles isra Israel said we will fight this alone if we got to fight it alone and I'm telling you if you've got the spirit of God inside of you you will not bow down to to the enemies oh you know what you should just you know like you can you can let uh you know uh a homosexual Minister come and speak not in this this hour not in this church I love that person but they need Deliverance they need the spirit of God once the logos comes into them they can't stay that way amen they'll be delivered they'll be set free I'm not bashing gazing this and that that's not what that I'm just telling you what the word of God says it's an Abomination before God and we will not we will not bow down to to man's teachings and the laws of this land if it's going to compromise the word of God God will God says you don't have to you just be still you just be still I'll give you the wisdom I'll give you the words I'll give you what you have need of I know this is strong Saints but this is the hour that we're living in we are not going to bow down we are not going to let the enemy come in and take control of our children in the schools teaching them gender this this gender that you could be a girl or you could be a boy no sir we are going to keep our land that was an Abomination back in the days of of of of the children of Israel it's still an Abomination today he's the same God back there that he is today amen praise godj and we're going to stand on the word of God we're going to let the Holy Spirit vindicate his word confirm his word and and he is going to interpret his word we don't have to do anything we just have to say yes Lord hallelujah thank you for giving me this few extra minutes God bless you all let's pray father Lord we we realize the day that we're living in Lord is a is a time of of great burden upon the people Lord upon uh the churches upon the common
