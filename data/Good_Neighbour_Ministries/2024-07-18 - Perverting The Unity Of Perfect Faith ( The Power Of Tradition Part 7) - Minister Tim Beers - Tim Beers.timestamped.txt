[19:25] right from you know the the the
[19:29] the Pharisees and sagues bringing right
[19:31] back from Moses the
[19:32] law right right into Jesus right into
[19:35] the Dark Ages right into you know Luther
[19:38] Wesley right into Pentecost right into
[19:40] the message this is where it has to come
[19:44] this is you know Satan is always going
[19:46] to fight and be closer to the light not
[19:50] the darkness because he is Darkness so
[19:53] he's going to be right here to fight the
[19:55] children of God but God has promised to

[20:14] getting into it a little bit more on the

[20:17] how all these tie in together of what
[20:21] I've been speaking about hallelujah amen
[20:24] let us go to Isaiah 59:19
[20:35] Hallelujah you didn't pray for me today
[20:37] because you didn't know I was
[20:38] ministering as I pray for you you pray
[20:40] for me we're all in this together amen

[20:49] as God has given to me but I need you I
[20:52] need Faith to pull on it amen we
[20:57] together create at something powerful
[21:01] amen and victory comes through that
[21:05] Hallelujah not just the
[21:07] minister so shall they fear the name of
[21:10] the Lord from the West and his glory
[21:14] from the rising of the
[21:15] sun when the enemy shall come in like a
[21:20] flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift
[21:23] a standard against him and we know
[21:25] brother brandham said when the enemy
[21:27] comes in as a flood in your life God
[21:31] will make his word more real to you oh
[21:36] yes that's what we want more than all
[21:39] the gifts and the signs and the Wonders
[21:42] we want in this hour that word to become
[21:44] real to us hallelujah because that's the
[21:47] only way we're going to overcome in this
[21:49] most wicked age that we're living
[21:52] in and the Redeemer shall come to Zion
[21:57] and unto them that turn from
[21:59] transgression in Jacob sayeth the Lord
[22:03] as for me this is my Covenant with them
[22:07] sayeth the Lord my spirit that is upon
[22:10] thee and my words which I have put in
[22:13] thy mouth shall not depart out of thy
[22:17] mouth nor out of thy mouth of thy seed
[22:22] nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed
[22:26] sayeth the Lord from henceforth and
[22:29] forever
[22:30] more H Allelujah let's go to John 8:32
[22:33] we can see the Lord here showing
[22:35] predestination showing election showing
[22:38] that he's placed the seed in every one
[22:41] of his children
[22:44] hallelujah
[22:46] hallelujah John 8:32 and ye shall know
[22:50] the truth and the truth shall make you
[22:53] free they answered him we be Abraham's
[22:56] seed we were never inod to any man how
[23:00] sayest thou you shall make us free Jesus
[23:03] answered verily verily I say unto you
[23:06] whosoever committed sin is the servant
[23:08] of sin just think about it they are the
[23:10] people back there supposedly the people
[23:13] of God believing the prophet Moses's
[23:17] message and living it to a
[23:20] tea and saying and Jesus comes along the
[23:23] revealed word of the hour comes along
[23:26] and says you are living in
[23:29] sin and committ in sin and you need to
[23:33] be set free listen my brothers and
[23:36] sisters we come here tonight to be set
[23:40] free by the word of God Amen we are
[23:45] constantly being set free by his
[23:49] word and the servant abideth not in the
[23:52] house forever but the son abideth if the
[23:55] son therefore shall make you free you
[23:58] you shall be free
[24:00] indeed I know that you are Abraham's
[24:03] seed I know you're in the message I know
[24:06] you're a
[24:08] Believer but you seek to kill me because
[24:12] my word had no place in you what do they
[24:15] seek to kill what are they going to seek
[24:17] to kill that's inside the Bride of Jesus
[24:21] Christ today the revealed
[24:24] word 2 Corinthians 2:10
[24:34] Hallelujah Les Satan should get
[24:36] advantage of us for we are not
[24:40] ignorant of his
[24:43] devices H
[24:45] Allelujah because God has given us a
[24:49] prophet given us a word and now he has
[24:52] come down and he's revealing it to us
[24:56] personally those seals are being opened
[24:58] open to the Bride of Jesus Christ and as
[25:01] they're being open
[25:03] Hallelujah listen this is a battle this
[25:06] ain't all about joy happiness and you
[25:08] know praise God all the time and this is
[25:10] a battle this is between life and death
[25:14] Hallelujah that's what we're in and we
[25:16] need to be certain of God that's why
[25:18] brother brandom preached those messages
[25:21] greatest battle ever fought put on the
[25:23] whole armor of God and that's what we're
[25:26] here tonight amen may you be encouraged
[25:29] and strengthened Hallelujah let us pray
[25:32] father thank you for your love grace and
[25:34] mercy Lord I stand Here by faith father
[25:38] believing in you Lord and the people of
[25:40] God have come tonight Lord they have
[25:43] come hungry Lord and we know that let
[25:46] every man's word be a lie but your word
[25:49] to be truth tonight lord it's not the
[25:51] minister not the elders not the pastor
[25:54] but it's the Holy Ghost Lord Jesus that
[25:57] can only take the word not by might not
[26:00] by power but by your spirit Lord oh God
[26:04] ride on the word tonight Lord into the
[26:07] hearts of your people father we
[26:09] surrender ourselves to you father Place
[26:12] us under the blood hide us under the
[26:15] cross oh God from our weaknesses this
[26:18] flesh father the mistakes of our our of
[26:22] our day father the thoughts in our mind
[26:25] oh God bind every contrary Spirit father
[26:28] and every fiery Dart of the enemy Lord
[26:31] and Lord let the spirit of God had
[26:34] prance here tonight father so that we
[26:36] may leave
[26:37] rejoicing in Victory father in Jesus
[26:41] Christ's name we pray amen God bless you
[26:43] as you're
[26:44] seated
[26:46] hallelujah what a message we got amen
[26:50] glory to God what a message if this
[26:53] message has been really and is being
[26:55] really revealed to you oh my what a word
[26:59] of God we got
[27:01] hallelujah
[27:03] amen hallelujah you know you look at uh
[27:08] what I've been preaching on I don't want
[27:09] to get ahead of myself here what I've
[27:11] been preaching on here hallelujah
[27:15] talking about the Rapture age talking
[27:18] about the Eternal Church age talking
[27:20] about the LC in church age
[27:24] recognizing in in everything that we've
[27:26] been saying here that we are both in the
[27:29] leoan church age this flesh and we are
[27:32] also in the Eternal Church age or
[27:35] brother brandom called it the Rapture
[27:37] age or the Capstone age amen hallelujah
[27:40] you say brother Tim where do you where
[27:41] do you get that from well it's all all
[27:43] through the message if you go and study
[27:46] your message that God has given you in
[27:48] this hour but in John 3:9 Jesus himself
[27:51] demonstrated that and he said the son of
[27:54] man that you see standing here on Earth
[27:56] is also in heaven
[27:58] and I believe the Bride of Jesus Christ
[28:01] amen that is standing on the earth
[28:04] Hallelujah is also in heaven amen by the
[28:07] new birth she's been translated in this
[28:10] hour that's what the Rapture is all
[28:12] about amen she's not playing Church
[28:15] Hallelujah she's not playing religion
[28:18] amen she's got an experience of the new
[28:20] birth amen of the opening of those Seven
[28:23] Seals she's been birthed under that not
[28:26] other justification not under Luther
[28:30] sanctification or or the Pentecostal
[28:33] message amen she's been birthed under
[28:36] the revealed word opening up to her in
[28:39] this hour by who the Holy Ghost himself
[28:42] not by a prophet but by the Holy Ghost
[28:45] himself amen taking the word of God in
[28:47] this hour
[28:49] hallelujah
[28:51] amen glory to God and we understand that
[28:54] both in this message as a whole there's
[28:56] the Pentecostal message says it's here
[28:59] where the seals were breaking but they
[29:01] weren't open Hallelujah so there is
[29:05] revelation in this Pentecostal message
[29:08] that that people are feeding off of and
[29:10] that's what we've been talking about
[29:12] Allelujah people receiving a birth in
[29:15] this message receiving it under a
[29:17] Pentecostal
[29:19] message but also in this message is the
[29:22] opening of The Seven Seals and the birth
[29:24] is available and that's the only birth
[29:27] that's available in this hour Hallelujah
[29:30] that we can be birth under and that's
[29:33] what produces the real change in this
[29:35] hour Hallelujah glory to God
[29:40] Amen that's what we want to recognize my
[29:42] brothers and sister that's what's
[29:43] burning on my
[29:45] heart Hallelujah the deception I'm
[29:51] seeing that people are not being led to
[29:54] Christ in this hour in this message not
[29:58] being led to the New Birth the real
[30:00] genuine
[30:02] birth not pressing into the kingdom with
[30:05] violence not overcoming the things that
[30:08] they need to overcome listen this is a
[30:11] death this is a total death to yourself
[30:15] not any of us can live in ourselves and
[30:18] receive this new birth inside I'm
[30:22] talking about we know this flesh won't
[30:24] inherit the kingdom of God it'll always
[30:27] struggle it's that emity with God but
[30:29] inside there's got to be a total rebirth
[30:32] a total death inside desires motives
[30:36] intentions everything and you can't do
[30:39] it
[30:40] yourself you can't do it yourself you
[30:43] can't put this
[30:45] on all you can do is seek
[30:49] knock that's all the Bible says you can
[30:52] do if you feel the call of your god of
[30:55] in your heart then that's what you do
[30:57] you seek you knock Hallelujah but Satan
[31:00] comes and and and uses the message and
[31:03] the quotes and everything like that and
[31:06] comforts you saying you're okay you've
[31:08] gone far enough he doesn't want you to
[31:11] go all the way he doesn't want you to
[31:13] break through to get the new birth in
[31:15] this hour to see what's actually being
[31:20] revealed you know your conscience tells
[31:24] you there's something that you're not
[31:26] seeing there's something that's you're
[31:28] not recognizing you're not
[31:31] fellowshipping under the mystery of
[31:33] Christ Hallelujah that means you're
[31:36] under a strong delusion of Satan taking
[31:39] the word he didn't deny the word back in
[31:43] the Garden of Eden to he didn't say oh
[31:46] the word's not right he just perverted
[31:50] it the perverting of the unity of
[31:53] perfect faith in this hour Hallelujah
[31:58] the first step on our way to Victory is
[32:00] recognizing the devil the
[32:03] enemy the Bible says in Ephesians 612
[32:06] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[32:10] blood we're still trying to understand
[32:13] that into deeper depths but against
[32:17] principalities against Powers against
[32:21] rulers of Darkness of this world against
[32:25] spiritual
[32:28] spiritual
[32:31] wickedness
[32:35] spiritual in high
[32:37] places
[32:39] Hallelujah you see the battle is not
[32:42] with flesh and
[32:44] blood the battle is not even with false
[32:47] preachers false prophets and all these
[32:49] things it's against
[32:52] principalities
[32:54] Hallelujah spiritual wickedness demon
[32:57] powers
[32:58] same devil taking the word of God that
[33:00] he did in the Garden of Eden in this
[33:03] hour taking the message and that's where
[33:06] the people get deceived how can how can
[33:09] I be deceived if I got the message of
[33:11] the hour because I know he's a true
[33:13] Vindicated Prophet I know God Vindicated
[33:17] him I know the pillar of fire was with
[33:19] him I see the signs and wonders I see
[33:21] his life I can go on and on and on but
[33:25] that's the very thing that Satan will
[33:27] take take to try to distract you divert
[33:31] you deceive you bring you in a
[33:38] delusion I want you to arrive I'm sure
[33:41] you want me to arrive more and more
[33:44] that's what we're fighting for amen
[33:47] hallelujah now brother Brandon speaking
[33:49] here in the God of this evil
[33:51] age notice
[33:54] Satan is not calling the God of this any
[33:58] other
[33:59] age but this age he's called the
[34:03] god think about
[34:06] it it was his ambition to be like God
[34:09] from the very beginning Isaiah 14:12
[34:13] Thou Art fallen from Heaven o Lucifer
[34:15] the son of the morning Thou Art cast
[34:17] down to the ground which did weaken the
[34:20] Nations for thou has said in thy heart I
[34:23] will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[34:26] throne above the star stars of God I
[34:29] will exalt myself above the Sons and
[34:31] Daughters of God think about it where
[34:34] are the sons and daughters of God in
[34:36] this hour that's where Satan is trying
[34:40] to exalt himself above the Sons and
[34:42] Daughters of God above the true bride of
[34:45] Jesus
[34:50] Christ and I will sit also upon the
[34:53] Mount of the
[34:54] congregation in the side of the North it
[34:58] was Satan's ambition to be worshiped
[35:00] like God he took two-thirds of the
[35:02] angels of the stars of
[35:05] Heaven of send it himself above those
[35:09] stars and preach to
[35:11] them and deceive two-thirds of them you
[35:14] see it all right notice that his
[35:17] ambition now he's ready with his careful
[35:23] selected educated bride by his own
[35:26] knowledge
[35:29] in this deceit of big buildings big
[35:33] denominations the knowledge the theology
[35:37] the smart the intellectual the
[35:40] educated to deceive the whole world and
[35:43] become a God that's what he has
[35:47] done in this
[35:50] hour listen he ain't stopping out there
[35:54] he's moving on
[35:57] there is one
[36:00] body one Spirit just also we called in
[36:06] one hope of your calling there is one
[36:08] Lord One Faith one baptism one God and
[36:14] Father of all who is over us all and
[36:18] through all Ephesians
[36:20] 4:6 this is God's inspired master plan
[36:26] for true unity in the body of Jesus
[36:30] Christ nothing else my brothers and
[36:32] sisters and if you break that down one
[36:36] calling one Lord One
[36:40] Faith one baptism yeah I know brother
[36:43] Tim but Lord Jesus help us to see amen
[36:48] the deception in
[36:50] it the Apostle Paul knew the importance
[36:53] of unity in the church he told the
[36:56] Philippians to make make my joy complete
[36:59] by being
[37:01] likeminded having the same love being
[37:04] one in one spirit and purpose doing
[37:08] nothing out of selfishness or selfish
[37:11] ambition or vain conceit but in humility
[37:16] consider others better than yourself not
[37:19] looking out for your own interests but
[37:22] also the interest of others Hallelujah
[37:28] Paul then shares that if you want to
[37:31] experience genuine Unity with one
[37:35] another the key is to reflect Jesus
[37:40] Christ not anything else but reflect him
[37:45] the word the revealed word of this hour
[37:49] and the only way you can reflect him is
[37:51] that if he's living inside of you
[37:53] through the new birth through the
[37:55] Awakening of the seed of God inside of
[37:57] you you
[37:59] Hallelujah be like him think like him
[38:04] and it starts with a heart attitude like
[38:08] him the character and quality that Paul
[38:11] points them towards is Jesus
[38:15] humility oh
[38:17] my it's hard to be
[38:20] humble it's hard to be
[38:24] humble you see nobody in here can be
[38:28] humble in themselves if it's not the
[38:30] grace of
[38:32] God we're always constantly being lifted
[38:34] up in
[38:36] Pride Hallelujah constantly battling
[38:38] these things but it's hard to be
[38:42] humble
[38:43] Hallelujah Paul says if you want Unity
[38:46] you need to have the same attitude Jesus
[38:49] did even though he was God in humility
[38:52] he emptied himself all the way to the
[38:56] Cross didn't didn't Paul say I Die
[39:00] daily it's not a one-time death is a
[39:03] death that is dying out to yourself on a
[39:07] daily basis is picking up your cross
[39:11] amen the cross is heavy sometimes the
[39:15] cross weighs us down sometimes problems
[39:19] situations get in our lives trials
[39:23] Temptations come our way why so that can
[39:27] bring us to a death can bring us to a
[39:30] state of dying daily a state of humility
[39:35] to be like Jesus Hallelujah you know
[39:38] that's is the is the simplest thing that
[39:42] but it's the most powerful thing that is
[39:45] in this message is the
[39:47] humility of the of of a prophet a life
[39:51] so simple and
[39:55] humble and people think it's easy to
[39:58] live that it's not easy to live that you
[40:02] got to go through hard things to live
[40:05] that hallelujah it's not the easier way
[40:10] hallelujah it's the harder
[40:12] way that we have to go and those who
[40:16] accept the hard way
[40:19] Hallelujah you hear what I'm saying
[40:21] those who accept the hard way those who
[40:24] receive the hard way those those who
[40:27] don't pray against the hard way in your
[40:30] life is those who receive
[40:34] it
[40:36] hallelujah amen glory to
[40:39] God
[40:41] [Music]
[40:42] hallelujah now let us go a little deeper
[40:46] in this perverting that is happening in
[40:48] this
[40:49] hour the seven Seal's opening and the
[40:53] revealing was the Capstone Ministry the
[40:56] calling the bride into perfect Faith
[40:59] perfect realization perfect
[41:02] understanding of who she is that is
[41:05] living behind the
[41:07] veil Hallelujah listen we can't preach a
[41:12] water down message gospel we can't
[41:15] preach a Pentecostal gospel that is not
[41:19] the message of the hour that is not the
[41:21] word that's being revealed in this hour
[41:24] that's not the word that's going to take
[41:26] a body change and change these
[41:29] bodies
[41:31] hallelujah it's a life we're preaching a
[41:34] life that is died surrendered a humility
[41:38] in our lives that causes us to live
[41:42] behind that
[41:43] Veil
[41:45] Hallelujah glory to God
[41:49] amen
[41:51] amen which is the Capstone which is
[41:54] Christ himself by the new birth in this
[41:57] hour the calstone age is rejected
[42:01] brother Brandon speaking here the whole
[42:03] age is
[42:04] rejected and who is living in the age is
[42:08] rejected too so we can see that every
[42:11] age when they receive their portion of
[42:14] word are you listening to me every age
[42:17] that receives their portion of a word is
[42:22] rejected oh my you see the delusion
[42:27] can you see and
[42:29] understand that how Satan is
[42:33] stopping this word in people's lives
[42:37] from moving
[42:39] forward by keeping them in a past age a
[42:44] past
[42:46] light feeding off of things of a past
[42:51] word and making them
[42:55] believe that they're okay
[42:59] that they're
[43:00] fine listen no preacher no person no
[43:06] husband no wife no mommy no Daddy can
[43:10] tell you that you're saved you're born
[43:13] again and you know that you know that
[43:17] you are it's you and
[43:20] God it's got to be revealed between you
[43:24] and God and you can't come no other way
[43:29] Pentecost is pentetic cost and everybody
[43:33] has got to come through the blood of
[43:35] Jesus
[43:36] Christ everybody's got to die out to
[43:39] themselves everybody's got to come the
[43:42] same
[43:43] way
[43:44] [Music]
[43:45] Hallelujah listen I want to be that that
[43:48] kind of preacher that you don't feel
[43:50] safe just because you're in the message
[43:52] J but you walk out of here with
[43:55] confidence Hallelujah
[43:58] sometimes brother brand says you need to
[43:59] shake yourselves sometimes the Holy
[44:01] Ghost will shake you shake you right to
[44:05] the core and that's what causes you to
[44:07] go deeper and we constantly need to be
[44:10] going deeper this Revelation is
[44:12] constantly unfolding and opening up like
[44:15] the Roman Candle the word the truth is
[44:18] pressing on it's marching
[44:21] on we don't know it all we don't see it
[44:24] all right now or else we would not be
[44:26] here if this word was completed in The
[44:29] Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour the
[44:31] Rapture would have
[44:33] gone Hallelujah so we are here and we
[44:37] have to keep pressing
[44:39] on oh yes brothers and sisters I know
[44:43] the ministers know when they're up here
[44:45] that gross darkness is getting heavier
[44:48] and heavier the song leaders know that
[44:52] when they're up here trying to get the
[44:54] people to worship it's getting heavier
[44:57] and heavier upon the
[45:00] people because Satan has come down
[45:04] Hallelujah to
[45:07] deceive so this gross Darkness upon the
[45:11] people of Co of this course is
[45:14] prophesied of this day now that we are
[45:17] now living in but the oil has moved into
[45:22] the
[45:23] Capstone this is the age amen where the
[45:27] oil has moved
[45:29] on the 10 foolish virgins five wise with
[45:33] oil five foolish without oil is
[45:37] happening right
[45:39] now right here right now being fulfilled
[45:44] people claiming they have the message
[45:47] but not recognizing the day that they're
[45:49] living off of they're living off of a
[45:51] false light a mirage taking the same
[45:54] light remember it's light
[45:58] a false light and a true light are both
[46:05] lights then using it to stay in a past
[46:10] age a false light is a light a mirage is
[46:16] an image that seems to be
[46:19] true but it keeps you from the True
[46:22] Light the true image of God and that's
[46:25] what's taking place in this hour
[46:28] that false
[46:30] birth that false light that's being
[46:34] preached that false image of Christ in
[46:37] this hour is keeping people from the
[46:40] True Light the true birth in this
[46:43] hour let us move on
[46:46] here I got more to
[46:48] say why God planned it this way is to
[46:52] show his election and his choosing
[46:54] because all because of the fall the
[46:57] Serpent's Seed came
[47:00] in
[47:01] Hallelujah the serpent seed came in
[47:05] that's why he's got to reveal his word
[47:07] through the prophet and through the
[47:09] ministry of this hour like this because
[47:11] the serpent seed came in and he knows
[47:15] his bride will not be deceived that's
[47:18] prophesied she will not be deceived in
[47:21] this hour but she will see her way
[47:23] out
[47:25] Hallelujah Satan is always trying to
[47:28] pervert what God has created because
[47:30] Satan cannot
[47:34] create he can't create so he takes think
[47:37] about it he takes what God has created
[47:40] what God has spoken what God has done
[47:44] and then he tries to pervert it and
[47:47] mislead the people and direct them in
[47:49] another different direction against away
[47:53] from what the new
[47:55] birth Jesus said you must be born again
[47:58] why do you think he said that you must
[48:00] be born again or you cannot see or enter
[48:03] into the kingdom of God so Satan knows
[48:06] that Satan knows when the new birth
[48:09] comes to an individual he's done he's
[48:12] finished he can try to attack but that
[48:15] new birth will always rais up just like
[48:18] in the prophet when he lost his his wife
[48:20] and his daughter he and Satan came to
[48:23] him and started pounding him and he was
[48:26] about to give up but he said then
[48:27] something raised up inside of him that
[48:30] new birth that genuine New Birth raised
[48:33] up and kept him going and said blessed
[48:36] be the name of the Lord it wasn't just
[48:38] words it was an action it was an
[48:40] experience that he had blessed be the
[48:43] name of the Lord he give he takes what
[48:45] is
[48:47] this the new
[48:50] birth he takes that
[48:52] away but he gives me eternal life
[48:56] through the new
[48:58] birth Hallelujah so blessed be the name
[49:01] of the Lord
[49:04] hallelujah
[49:06] amen but it keeps you from the True
[49:09] Light the image of God why God planned
[49:12] it this way to show his election Satan's
[49:16] always trying to pervert what God has
[49:17] created because Satan cannot create
[49:19] himself are you seeing the true light or
[49:22] the false light they're both lights are
[49:24] you seeing the True Image or The False
[49:27] Image in this
[49:29] hour the God of this evil age now back
[49:33] through there other ages you belong to
[49:36] denominations you belong to this you
[49:38] belong to that and others what happened
[49:41] to the denomination stock it dried up we
[49:45] can see that right the spirit keeps
[49:48] leaving it and going on are we
[49:52] listening and it heads up in a seed
[49:58] you see in the temptation of both heads
[50:01] back the same way it was in the
[50:05] beginning notice don't forget it now
[50:07] first John 4:5 he puts the spirit it is
[50:11] it is the spirit of
[50:14] error that he puts
[50:18] there Eve never just simply walked out
[50:21] willfully and say I don't believe God I
[50:23] don't believe the message of the hour I
[50:25] don't believe God sent a prophet
[50:28] I'm just bringing it right down to
[50:30] today no it was an error she
[50:36] believed Satan never comes out and says
[50:38] oh well that's not even the word of God
[50:43] he emites the word of God but he puts
[50:46] his own interpretation on
[50:48] it hallelujah how much
[50:51] interpretation the prophet preached the
[50:54] a whole message
[50:57] God is his own
[50:58] interpreter he will make it plain we
[51:01] don't understand
[51:03] that we don't understand that ministers
[51:06] don't understand that that we're not to
[51:09] interpret the word of God God will
[51:11] interpret it he will make it plain he'll
[51:13] bring it to pass I'm just telling you
[51:16] that there's there's a devil there's a
[51:18] new birth there's a walk there's a life
[51:21] of God that has to manifest amen God
[51:24] will interpret it I don't need to
[51:26] interpret it I can interpret it it's not
[51:29] laid in the power of man's hands man's
[51:32] hands will not touch this that's why
[51:35] when brother bradam supposedly people
[51:38] say open the Seven Seals he did not open
[51:40] the Seven Seals said the seven seal is
[51:43] Christ himself that's why when he
[51:46] preached the message the title seven
[51:49] seal there is nothing there that was
[51:52] revealed that was revealed in the first
[51:54] six seals because Christ came on the
[51:57] scene he's his an own own interpreter he
[52:00] will make it plain he reveals himself to
[52:03] the
[52:04] individual nobody else has that position
[52:07] nobody else has that office in this hour
[52:10] but Christ alone that's why he came
[52:13] that's why the bride's going to overcome
[52:16] that's why she's going to take a body
[52:17] change and be victorious in this hour
[52:20] against all the Ws of the devil because
[52:24] he's here that's one of my greatest
[52:26] songs he is here hallelujah he is here
[52:30] amen it's because he is here that's why
[52:33] I said we're two or three are gathered
[52:36] together I'm in the midst and all things
[52:38] agreeing together on the word of God it
[52:41] shall come to pass do you realize the
[52:44] power we have here tonight in agreeing
[52:47] and being united by the word of God
[52:50] that's being revealed by faith and
[52:53] speaking
[52:54] it Satan shuts your mouth shuts your
[52:58] heart shuts your spirit because he knows
[53:02] if you just do what God tells you to do
[53:05] what he's purposed for you to do which
[53:07] is speak that word of God when it comes
[53:09] into your heart he's
[53:12] finished
[53:13] hallelujah
[53:15] amen glory to God brother brandham tied
[53:19] all the Loose Ends by revealing the
[53:22] Mysteries now it's for the Bride of
[53:24] Jesus Christ to bring
[53:27] back amen now we're not going back to
[53:30] Pentecost back there especially the
[53:33] modern day Pentecost but it's the Bride
[53:35] of Jesus Christ bringing back the acts
[53:39] of the Holy Ghost in the church again

[53:44] and the holy ghost moving through the
[53:46] church the bride in this hour the same
[53:49] Holy
[53:51] Ghost oh but we we got an interpretation
[53:54] that is manifesting around this message
[53:56] message we're going around and seeing
[53:58] the atmospheres we're seeing the
[54:00] conditions of the people it's not the
[54:02] people's fault it's what's being
[54:04] preached to
[54:05] them hallelujah it's what's being
[54:11] preached pting people on the back it's
[54:13] come right here oh yes it's come right
[54:17] here I feel the pressure sometimes oh of
[54:21] giving you what you want to hear or
[54:23] making it so positive what you want to
[54:25] hear you feel that pressure not telling
[54:29] you the truth not telling you that

[1:05:55] street if you've been at my house you'll
[1:05:56] see it across the street was so high
[1:05:59] that it was almost overflowing onto the
[1:06:01] roads and there's a steel cage that goes
[1:06:04] down it was lifted right up now the
[1:06:07] pressure to lift that right up so none
[1:06:09] of the drains could receive any water so

[1:06:29] threw it but there's nothing blocking it
[1:06:32] and I'm on my knees and I said and I'm
[1:06:34] looking at the backyard and it's just
[1:06:36] going like this and if it goes right
[1:06:39] down into the basement and that's that's
[1:06:41] it it's
[1:06:42] finished and I I was on my knees and I
[1:06:44] just said actually I didn't say
[1:06:47] nothing I told her I said it's in God's
[1:06:50] hands I just got there and I took it out
[1:06:52] when I took out what was there and it
[1:06:54] was I knew the pressure from the water
[1:06:58] underneath there's nothing you can do
[1:07:01] there's nowhere for the water to go and
[1:07:03] no word of a
[1:07:05] lie if that you know the drains that had
[1:07:08] the steel cages around there I was

[1:14:37] born again then I came to understand
[1:14:39] later down the road that God sent a

[1:14:43] spirit inside of me agreed with the word
[1:14:45] of God
[1:14:47] hallelujah amen instead of taking an
[1:14:50] experience of the gifts of the Holy

[1:15:12] when the word came to me and told me
[1:15:14] that I I have to repent and be baptized
[1:15:16] in the name of Jesus Christ that's what
[1:15:18] opened up to me I recognized that I was
[1:15:21] a
[1:15:23] sinner oh people in this message message
[1:15:25] people around growing up in this message
[1:15:27] don't even recognize that they're a
[1:15:30] sinner you have to recognize that you're
[1:15:32] a
[1:15:33] sinner not because somebody told you or
[1:15:36] because the Bible say so or brother
[1:15:38] Brown said so but you recognize that you
[1:15:40] are actually a
[1:15:43] sinner sinner you're
[1:15:52] sinning and that you're a child of God
[1:15:55] that's what it does it makes you
[1:15:57] recognize you're a sinner a lot of
[1:15:59] people don't recognize their sinners in

[1:16:19] sinner saved by grace I've been elected
[1:16:21] and predestinated by the grace of God
[1:16:25] it's my experience my brothers and
[1:16:28] sisters not because I'm
[1:16:30] religious not even because what I
[1:16:35] believe is because of the grace of God
[1:16:38] let me just try to wind this
[1:16:40] down I have lived three
[1:16:43] lifetimes with all the experience I've
[1:16:47] had and still having because
[1:16:50] experiences open the door to a deeper
[1:16:53] understanding
[1:16:55] now I'm talking about experiences here
[1:16:57] because people get deceived Satan uses
[1:16:59] experiences to deceive people that
[1:17:01] they're born again you can have
[1:17:03] experience after experience and still
[1:17:06] not be born
[1:17:07] again oh
[1:17:09] yes of who you are in Christ but the New
[1:17:14] Birth has to be there in order for you
[1:17:17] to recognize who you
[1:17:19] are or your experiences are just what
[1:17:23] they are experiences
[1:17:25] they're not pointing you or directing
[1:17:28] you to any particular
[1:17:31] direction people have all kinds of
[1:17:34] experiences you see it out there in the
[1:17:35] Pentecostals you see it with the gifts
[1:17:37] signs of Wonders but not going in any
[1:17:40] different
[1:17:42] direction Hallelujah people believe in
[1:17:45] being born again is just an
[1:17:48] experience it's an
[1:17:50] Awakening of the seed of God inside of
[1:17:54] you that's what it is am I taken away
[1:17:57] from experiences am I saying experiences
[1:17:59] are false no but there's two different
[1:18:02] things here in this message is where
[1:18:06] Satan is
[1:18:08] perverting the unity of the true
[1:18:10] birth we have it if you can see God sent
[1:18:15] a
[1:18:16] prophet or we have it if you can
[1:18:18] understand denominations of the
[1:18:20] devil or you can see that God
[1:18:24] is given in this hour of rapture or the
[1:18:27] world is full of lies and evil people
[1:18:31] and Liv in wrong
[1:18:33] ways all kinds of
[1:18:36] deceptions believing in this message
[1:18:39] that you have it it's only by
[1:18:44] election many are called but few are
[1:18:47] chosen God doesn't want positive mental
[1:18:50] thinkers he wants the word of God to
[1:18:53] manifest
[1:18:55] H
[1:18:57] Allelujah he doesn't want good church
[1:19:00] attendance and good works great meetings
[1:19:03] or camp meetings he wants you to be born
[1:19:08] again oh
[1:19:11] yes all
[1:19:13] deceptions deceiving the people
[1:19:16] misdirecting them from what the new
[1:19:21] birth taking the word of God and try
[1:19:24] trying to make it of none effect to the
[1:19:26] people when Jesus said that you must be
[1:19:29] born
[1:19:34] again
[1:19:36] oh bringing forth signs and
[1:19:39] wonders The
[1:19:41] Awakening and becoming a reality in your
[1:19:44] experience where you recognize who you
[1:19:47] are in the reveal truth of this hour not
[1:19:51] you recognizing you are a message
[1:19:53] believer and you believe God sent a
[1:19:56] prophet it's knowing God sent a prophet
[1:20:00] because I'm a son and daughter of God
[1:20:03] it's because I'm a child it's because
[1:20:05] I've been born

[1:28:15] night but it was Christ
[1:28:17] there that got me through the night and
[1:28:19] I
[1:28:21] lived I should have been dead many times
