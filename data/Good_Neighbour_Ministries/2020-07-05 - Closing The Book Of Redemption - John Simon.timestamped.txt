[0:13] good Sunday morning brains praise the
[0:18] Lord praise the Lord Most High it's
[0:22] wonderful to be in his presence again to
[0:27] share with you the joy of the Lord the
[0:32] Word of God the promise of this age
[0:37] may the great Holy Spirit bless us today
[0:41] as we come together giving glory honor
[0:45] and praise to his name
[0:47] let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father
[0:52] approaching you by the way of prayer to
[0:55] the bluff Christ made a great holy
[0:58] spirit anoint the Word of God for hearts
[1:02] and maybe have such a wonderful time of
[1:06] fellowship feasting around the table
[1:10] you have spread receive O God or
[1:15] gratitude or thankfulness for your grace
[1:19] and mercy in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:23] Christ amen
[1:26] praise God today I read from the Gospel
[1:33] of Luke chapter 4 verses 14 to 21
[1:40] which reads thus and Jesus returned in
[1:46] the power of the spirit into Galilee and
[1:50] there went out a fame of him through all
[1:55] the region round about and he taught in
[1:59] their synagogues being glorified of all
[2:04] and he came to Nazareth where he had
[2:08] been brought up and as his custom was he
[2:12] went into the synagogue on the Sabbath
[2:16] day and stood up for to read and there
[2:20] was delivered unto him the book of the
[2:24] Prophet
[2:24] I sayeth and when he had opened the book
[2:29] he found the place where it was written
[2:33] the Spirit of the Lord is upon me
[2:36] because he had anointed me to preach the
[2:39] gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[2:42] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[2:44] deliverance to the captives recovering
[2:47] of sight to the blind and to set at
[2:50] liberty them that are bruised to preach
[2:54] the acceptable year of the Lord
[2:58] and he closed the book and he gave it to
[3:04] the minister and sat down and the eyes
[3:09] of all them that were in the synagogue
[3:12] were fastened on him and he began to say
[3:17] unto them this day this scripture is
[3:22] fulfilled in your ears now here we see
[3:31] from this text how Jesus was returning
[3:37] from the temptation in the wilderness
[3:41] and came back to Nazareth and the Bible
[3:47] says he went to church he went to the
[3:52] synagogue as his custom was as his habit
[3:56] was to go into the house of God to give
[4:01] glory and praise to Jehovah if we want
[4:05] to be like the Lord Jesus then we need
[4:08] to be in church we need to be able to
[4:13] worship God and give glory and praise to
[4:16] his marvelous name well you may say
[4:19] brother Simon we can't go to our church
[4:23] building because of kovaydin because of
[4:27] gum
[4:28] restrictions and so we are not free to
[4:31] congregate in huge numbers as we
[4:34] normally do yes that may be the case but
[4:38] at least you can go to church by
[4:42] watching faithfully your church's
[4:46] website life stream what they are
[4:50] offering from the word at this
[4:53] particular time if you cannot have the
[4:57] entire loaf then at least try to get a
[5:01] slice we a Christian ought to read their
[5:05] Bible pray every day and faith cometh by
[5:09] hearing and hearing by the Word of God
[5:13] so the importance of church attendance
[5:18] cannot be overemphasized
[5:21] for the Bible tells us for Satan not the
[5:25] assembling of yourselves together as the
[5:28] manner or the habit of some people are
[5:33] they just dismiss it they they it's
[5:36] casual about it and may I say this what
[5:41] is the church the Church of God is not a
[5:44] building ecclesia meaning called out
[5:49] once we are called into a fellowship we
[5:52] are called to fellowship with our with
[5:56] God and with our fellow men of like
[5:59] precious faith so let us be faithful in
[6:03] this are of change when we are changing
[6:07] from attachments to buildings and
[6:10] positions and things of that nature to
[6:14] the ground where we enter into are
[6:18] spiritually into our closet where we are
[6:21] worshiping God in spirit and in the
[6:24] truth so so let the Holy Spirit bring
[6:28] about that mental and spiritual change
[6:32] that we ought to be just as faithful
[6:36] with our online stream
[6:41] because this is the Church of today this
[6:45] is the way that we practice church this
[6:48] is the way we have church so the you
[6:51] approach it casually but soberly and
[6:55] seriously with righteousness and
[6:58] sincerity of the Lord God within your
[7:02] heart and being a holy spirit bless you
[7:05] praise God for evermore
[7:07] so Jesus returned from the deserts the
[7:12] wilderness the the place of temptation
[7:16] where he my friends came back and
[7:22] returned to his hometown of Nazareth and
[7:26] went to the synagogue there to worship
[7:32] God now just imagine the scene in the
[7:38] synagogue colorful Eastern garments all
[7:45] gathered together in the synagogue and
[7:50] here comes this young Jewish young man
[7:56] and enters into the single also and they
[8:02] all were together and as Jewish custom
[8:06] was and is there are times when
[8:11] individuals are allowed to read from the
[8:15] Torah so Jesus rose up to read from the
[8:21] Torah and delivered the message of the
[8:27] Spirit of the Lord is upon me out of the
[8:31] Book of Isaiah and when he had finished
[8:36] and this is where I take my topic from
[8:39] the Bible says and he closed the book
[8:44] and sat down he gave it to the minister
[8:49] and he sat down Oh
[8:53] speak to God I'd like to speak today on
[8:57] the closing of the book of redemption
[9:00] the closing of the book of redemption
[9:05] my friends the Bible says that he sat
[9:09] down now when Stephen saw him
[9:14] let's eat Stephen in the book of Acts
[9:18] saw the Lord Jesus after they had stoned
[9:24] him mocked him Stephen
[9:27] the Bible says lifted up his eyes looked
[9:31] up to heaven and he saw the Lord and the
[9:35] Lord was standing the Bible says he the
[9:39] Lord was standing praise God hallelujah
[9:43] I'm so glad friends that Jesus is still
[9:47] standing up for us I am happy that he is
[9:51] still standing in the gap on her behalf
[9:54] he is standing with us in between the
[9:59] judgments of God and the mercy of God so
[10:03] he is like the rampart he is our
[10:06] fortress he is our great honor mow the
[10:11] armor of God to protect us and keep us
[10:14] from the plagues and the wrath of God so
[10:18] I am happy today that Jesus Christ our
[10:22] risen Lord is standing for us my friends
[10:26] let me say this he is timing still as
[10:30] our great intercessor praise God
[10:34] hallelujah
[10:35] we need no Saints we need no one else
[10:39] but she look away and see Jesus only
[10:43] standing there interceding on our behalf
[10:47] father I paid the price of judgment I
[10:53] took upon myself the sins of the world I
[10:57] accepted it all and I paid for all there
[11:02] since Father forgive them they did not
[11:05] know what they were doing for in the
[11:08] time of their ignorance and in their
[11:10] darkness Lord I tell you Father forgive
[11:14] them amen
[11:16] and so I'm so happy that Jesus is still
[11:20] our intercessor aren't you happy that he
[11:23] is still our intercessor and that he is
[11:26] still standing up for us and standing in
[11:30] the cash I want to say I am glad he is
[11:33] standing still standing as our mediator
[11:37] we need no other mediator for the Bible
[11:43] tells us clearly there is one mediator
[11:47] between God and man the man not the
[11:52] woman not any other person but the man
[11:56] Christ Jesus is the only mediator
[12:00] between God and man and there is
[12:04] salvation in no other name but in the
[12:08] name of Jesus Christ or risen Lord from
[12:13] the glory of God hallelujah I'm so very
[12:16] happy about that I'm glad that he is
[12:19] standing for us praise God
[12:23] standing as our lawyer as our advocate
[12:30] the one who is standing and arguing are
[12:35] presenting our case for us thank God
[12:39] that we have Jesus Christ our Lord and
[12:43] it's the greatest lawyer the world has
[12:47] ever seen a lawyer that has never lost
[12:50] the case for everyone that comes to him
[12:54] he has the power to st. he has the power
[12:58] to heal he has the power to deliver he
[13:01] has the power to redeem and so he stands
[13:05] in the presence and places his blood as
[13:09] the
[13:09] evidence and as the proof that the price
[13:12] was paid and now he can redeem back his
[13:18] purchase position ui who were once in
[13:22] Satan's pawn shop you and I who once was
[13:26] in Satan's grip now Satan has to let you
[13:31] go for because the price of your
[13:34] Redemption has been paid and I'm so glad
[13:38] he brought me out of the pawn shop out
[13:41] of the miry clay and put my feet on the
[13:46] rock of ages' to stay here in
[13:48] forevermore taste Vita God hallelujah
[13:51] for the Lord Jesus Christ who has
[13:54] brought me out for a great shout
[13:57] glorifying and worshipping God
[14:01] hallelujah here we are brother sisters
[14:03] with this joy of God in our hearts
[14:07] glory to God now the Bible says that he
[14:12] closed the book then gave it to the
[14:16] minister and sat down now in the book of
[14:22] Revelation chapter 5 we read in the
[14:27] scriptures and I saw in the right hand
[14:32] of him that sat on the throne a book
[14:36] thank God it's him not them but are they
[14:40] but I saw in the right hand of him that
[14:44] sat on the throne a book written whips
[14:49] in and on the backside sealed with seven
[14:53] seals and I saw strong angel proclaiming
[14:57] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[15:01] the book and to loose the seals thereof
[15:05] and no man no man in heaven in earth
[15:12] neither under the earth was able to open
[15:16] the book neither
[15:19] No thereupon so no man no human being
[15:23] can open this book no human being of
[15:27] himself can interpret this book no human
[15:31] being by his exalted position by his
[15:34] popularity by his intellectualism by his
[15:38] human accumulation of wisdom can open or
[15:42] interpret this book but this book is
[15:46] held in the hand of Almighty God and so
[15:50] the Bible says and John says and I went
[15:55] much because no man was found worthy to
[15:58] open and to read the book neither to
[16:02] look there in there on and one of the
[16:06] elders said unto me weak not behold the
[16:10] Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[16:13] David has prevailed to open the book and
[16:17] to loose the seven seals thereof and I
[16:21] beheld and lo in the midst of the throne
[16:26] and of the four beasts and in the midst
[16:31] of the elders stood a lamb as it had
[16:36] been slain having seven horns and seven
[16:39] eyes which are the seven spirits of God
[16:42] sent forth in all the earth and he came
[16:47] and took the book out of the right hand
[16:50] of him that sat upon the throne lower to
[16:53] God the rest you can read where the
[16:55] elders rejoice the four beasts rejoice
[16:58] they sang a new song the word worthy the
[17:02] word worthy to take the book and to open
[17:05] the seals thereof and I beheld and heard
[17:08] a voice of many angels around the throne
[17:11] and then and the elders and the numbers
[17:15] were were ten thousand times ten
[17:17] thousand and thousands of thousands
[17:21] saying that a loud voice worthy is the
[17:24] lamb to receive power riches wisdom
[17:27] strength and honor and glory and
[17:30] blessing praise be to God hallelujah
[17:34] what a scene in Nazareth that day what a
[17:41] scene also in heaven on that day for the
[17:45] scene in Nazareth my friends was a pre
[17:50] figure of this scene that was to come so
[17:55] we understand here clearly amen
[17:58] that the book was in the hand of the
[18:02] Father amen
[18:04] there it was the Bible tells us clearly
[18:09] that the lamb came and took the book now
[18:15] the Bible describes this lamp as a live
[18:20] it was slain in other words a bloody
[18:24] lamb a bleeding lamb but not only was
[18:29] this lamb bloody and bleeding let us
[18:32] recognize that just as Jesus went into
[18:37] the business and had a humdinger of a
[18:41] fight our trial attempt and temptations
[18:45] personally with the devil and overcame
[18:49] the devil and that's why we can overcome
[18:52] today because he is over our overcome oh
[18:56] now he overcame the devil in the
[19:00] wilderness how did he overcome by the
[19:02] Word of God amen
[19:05] praise the Lord he always said it is
[19:08] written it is written he referred the
[19:11] devil back to the Word of God and he
[19:14] defeated the devil on the basis of the
[19:18] Word of God
[19:19] now here we find he comes out of the
[19:22] wilderness after his fight with the
[19:24] devil but that was a procedure of
[19:27] himself and how he made friends would go
[19:32] and have a grape
[19:36] fight with Satan again I we call it the
[19:41] greatest battle ever fought for there he
[19:46] had this the battle started in heaven of
[19:50] course it will it was right through his
[19:52] ministry but it intensified in the
[19:56] Garden of Gethsemane what the Bible said
[20:00] under they strain the stress the
[20:03] pressure of this greatest battle ever
[20:06] fought that did this sweat became us
[20:10] blood an angel
[20:14] had to come and be straightening him in
[20:18] that garden Oh takes me to God that he
[20:22] went to Calvary for us because after the
[20:25] great fight in Gethsemane then he went
[20:29] to the great Mount Calvary battle and
[20:33] there my friends again
[20:37] we see him surrounded by Devils on every
[20:40] hand Devils mocking him him the Word of
[20:45] God made flesh now the same Devils are
[20:49] here the day when he reverts back to his
[20:52] word form and those same Devils are
[20:56] mocking him because he had no beauty to
[21:00] be desired of him he had none of their
[21:03] Grace's he had none of their
[21:06] acceptability but there he was hanging
[21:10] on that cruel cross on Mount Calvary to
[21:14] be mocked by man the Creator being
[21:17] mocked by his own creation all because
[21:21] they didn't recognize him the word that
[21:25] he did not have the kind of beauty they
[21:29] were thinking he didn't have the natural
[21:32] beauty he did not have the theological
[21:34] beauty he did not
[21:36] and this thing that could draw them to
[21:38] him his reputation yeah it uh things
[21:42] said about him the things that were
[21:44] blackening his name the very background
[21:48] his history of his birth and life
[21:52] everything the devil took induct every
[21:55] dirt he could find upon Jesus and upon
[21:59] his name but glory be to God there is no
[22:03] on the name as great as this name for
[22:06] the name of Jesus every knee shall bow
[22:10] every tongue shall confess that Jesus
[22:12] Christ is Lord of all and so here we
[22:16] find my friends that John heard a voice
[22:20] in heaven saying first of all let me
[22:23] touch on the fact that John wept and
[22:27] John was weeping because there was none
[22:31] to open this book and I say John being
[22:36] in the spirit be in the spirit in the
[22:40] presence of God recognize that this book
[22:44] was an important book that held the
[22:47] secrets of God for the rest of of
[22:51] earthly life right back into eternity
[22:54] and John wept there in the presence of
[22:59] God and one of the twenty-four elders
[23:01] says John with not John for the Lion of
[23:05] the tribe of Judah has prevailed John
[23:09] said and I turned to see this Lion of
[23:13] the tribe of Judah but when I looked
[23:16] instead of seeing a lion
[23:18] there'ss to him as it was slain in other
[23:23] words there stood a bloody bleeding lamb
[23:26] as if it was in a battle yes he was it
[23:30] was the Lamb of God that taken away the
[23:33] sins of the world and he was in the gray
[23:37] this battles ever thought and he fought
[23:41] all the way through Galilee to get
[23:44] cemani and on the mountain in Calvary
[23:49] back down in the valley of Gehenna or or
[23:54] similar type of Hell the Bible tells us
[23:58] he went down into hell and there had a
[24:03] titanic battle with the spirits for the
[24:08] souls of those in prison now for before
[24:12] his death and his blood as the Lamb of
[24:16] God was shed the Patriots placed their
[24:21] faith in the sacrificial blood of the
[24:26] natural lands that were slain but by
[24:31] faith as a bell hand by revelation that
[24:36] they all have they recognize that the
[24:40] shedding of the blood of these natural
[24:43] lands along the way was us were symbols
[24:50] types shadows prefiguring the coming of
[24:54] the real lamb the Lamb of God that will
[24:59] not take away your sins for a year and
[25:03] you must come back to Jerusalem the next
[25:06] year to be cleansed again but this lamb
[25:11] well take away the sins of the world
[25:14] once this man as the Bible says sat down
[25:17] oh praise God he just sat down and get
[25:22] away with her sins once and for all it
[25:25] was all gone thank God my sins are gone
[25:28] there underneath the love of Jesus
[25:31] Christ and I'm free I thank God I'm free
[25:35] because this bloody lamb went into a
[25:39] battle praise God
[25:41] of course brothers being the lion being
[25:43] the lamb is speaking about they the
[25:46] personalities of
[25:47] that once he has will you receive it now
[25:51] as your lamb as your edema or your
[25:54] savior if not his personality will
[25:57] change though sinners in the hands of an
[26:00] angry god you will be in the presence of
[26:03] the Living God who will then be the
[26:06] supreme judge they the white hair just
[26:10] the Ancient of Days that will judge you
[26:13] by His Word at that particular time
[26:17] no brother sister here we see this limb
[26:20] having gone through the great battle
[26:23] going down into hell having a fight
[26:27] there what Satan unseen just my friends
[26:32] of the outward form of him hanging on
[26:34] the cross being taken down and place
[26:37] with either to but his soul went into
[26:41] battle against the demons of Hell and
[26:45] the great battle was raging for our our
[26:49] salvation oh praise God forevermore here
[26:53] he came up now and because he paid the
[26:57] price for the church as bows paint the
[27:02] redemption price for roofs a simple type
[27:06] of the Bride of Christ now he could come
[27:09] so he came to the presence of his father
[27:13] amen and they're presented his blood his
[27:19] own blood as the evidence that he had
[27:24] finished the mission the great work of
[27:27] redemption upon the face of the earth
[27:30] all thanks be to God hallelujah
[27:33] so that cry went out that there was no
[27:36] man in earth in heaven or under heaven
[27:41] that could take this book and open the
[27:44] seals no man but God Himself could this
[27:49] is why Jesus said I hold the key of
[27:52] David cause he holds the key through the
[27:55] opening of that book he himself
[27:58] my friends is the key and he opened up
[28:02] the book praise God hallelujah open up
[28:06] this great book of retention this seven
[28:10] sealed book for us all glory to God that
[28:14] we could go free because when he went
[28:18] into him had that great battle with
[28:21] Satan my god
[28:22] Satan was that was they they jail keeper
[28:26] he was the jailer and had them keys no
[28:30] doubt hanging on his waist and sitting
[28:34] there gloating over the prophets and
[28:37] Patriots who were gone before that he
[28:41] could hold them there temporarily
[28:44] because the blood that not mention by
[28:48] the way no one has to be held
[28:51] temporarily like that anymore because
[28:53] now the blood is shed there is no such
[28:57] an intermediary place anymore
[28:59] as Paul made it clear absent from the
[29:02] body present with the Lord
[29:04] instantly prison with the Lord this is
[29:08] the way it is now by the grace of God
[29:11] from the time that Jesus died first
[29:14] since the dispensation change we are not
[29:16] under law we are now under grace we are
[29:19] no more under the types and the shadows
[29:22] and the schoolmasters but we have come
[29:24] to a supernatural graduation by the
[29:27] anointing of the Holy Spirit that has
[29:29] delivered us to walk into this marvelous
[29:33] glorious light of our Lord and Savior
[29:36] Jesus Christ
[29:37] aren't you happy that you can say I'm a
[29:39] Christian I am truly serving the Lord
[29:42] Oh glory to God hallelujah I'm happy
[29:46] today in the sunshine pray for all my
[29:49] sins have been taken away so the here
[29:53] comes this bloody bleeding lamb and just
[29:57] as Jesus took the book in Nazareth and
[30:03] reads out of the book and interprets
[30:07] Isaiah the prophet what
[30:10] being said and interpretation was the
[30:14] manifestation the manifestation was the
[30:18] interpretation for he took the book
[30:21] reading about himself that he was the
[30:24] fulfillment of that scripture he was the
[30:27] interpretation of that scripture and he
[30:30] says to them in public this day this
[30:34] scripture is fulfilled in your ears he
[30:38] could have literally said but they might
[30:41] of course have item right then this day
[30:44] is this scripture fulfilled in your
[30:47] sight Oh glory be to God
[30:50] for he was the interpretation of the
[30:53] scripture he was the fulfillment of the
[30:55] Word of God standing right before them
[30:58] the unrecognized presence of the Living
[31:02] God and still they did not recognize who
[31:05] he was God being misunderstood by his
[31:10] own people his own creation not
[31:13] recognizing who he was thinking that he
[31:17] will come from star to star coming with
[31:20] a golden chariot coming with golden
[31:23] slippers coming with perfumed lace
[31:25] handkerchiefs coming my friends with
[31:28] beautiful lots upon him and and here he
[31:31] comes
[31:32] they dick neck just couldn't accept him
[31:34] for who he was and what he was and how
[31:37] he appeared to be a Bible sister he had
[31:41] nothing that was acceptable or admirable
[31:45] in their eyes it was a shock to them so
[31:49] they could not see God the Father living
[31:54] in the Sun they could not recognize his
[31:58] living interpretation this Living Bible
[32:02] this living fullness of the word of God
[32:06] and here he stood that blood
[32:09] lands and they're in hell with this
[32:12] great thing happening he goes up to
[32:15] Satan with those keys and all of the
[32:19] partying health stops the music stop all
[32:23] the crazy madness of health stop there
[32:27] was Oh silence my friends why because he
[32:32] grabbed the whole of those keys from
[32:35] Satan that he's a death hell and the
[32:38] grave and no one else has that power to
[32:43] open death hell are the grave but Jesus
[32:47] Christ anyone claiming to be able to do
[32:50] that in this day or any other day is
[32:53] Antichrist and gets the Word of God for
[32:56] it's only Jesus Christ Himself is able
[33:00] to do that and he has never given that
[33:03] power to any one else
[33:07] praise God so he took away those keys
[33:10] away from Satan and his demons of Hell
[33:15] and if we go into David speaking he says
[33:21] that in the Book of Psalms he reads
[33:25] about to open up you everlasting gates
[33:29] so that the King of glory may come in
[33:32] and there upon the battlements of heaven
[33:36] as they looked out they saw the Lord of
[33:40] glory cunning and behind him heaps
[33:44] cunning with the multitude
[33:46] I believe David looked at him and saw
[33:48] Jesus bringing up those Patriots and
[33:52] prophets with him after freeing them
[33:55] from Satan's prison house and as his
[33:58] taking men their captive and bringing
[34:02] them captive so he could send back
[34:04] glorious gifts unto man the voice cried
[34:08] out who is this Lord of glory
[34:11] Oh who is this Lord of glory and the
[34:15] Lord of glory answered back the law
[34:18] are mighty in battle the Lord mighty to
[34:22] save glory to God none other but Jesus
[34:26] Christ Himself the Lord that was mighty
[34:30] and is mighty to save praise God and let
[34:34] them back in the glory for their
[34:37] believes unto righteousness they were
[34:42] looking to the cross so they had to wait
[34:46] for the fulfillment of the manifestation
[34:49] of the word of God where the lamb will
[34:51] die
[34:52] the lamb would do battle the lamb would
[34:54] set them free
[34:55] the leg would raise them up so they can
[34:58] walk in the streets of Jerusalem and the
[35:00] land will lead them back to heaven and
[35:04] the presence of Almighty God and now we
[35:08] are here in our time and dispensation
[35:11] not waiting to be taken out of an
[35:14] intermediary state we are looking back
[35:17] my friends back to the cross it has
[35:21] already happened the price is already
[35:23] paid we are free because jesus said to
[35:28] the seat on the cross that very day he
[35:31] said to him today
[35:33] thou shalt be with me in paradise today
[35:37] not tomorrow not after somebody prays
[35:40] you out of there now
[35:42] I fear paid a huge sum of money not
[35:45] after you you give to charity but you
[35:49] today thou shall be with me in paradise
[35:53] because you ask for my mercy
[35:55] you asked for my pardon and you asked
[35:58] you spoke to me and recognize who I was
[36:02] the Word of God back then made flesh you
[36:06] are being called upon to recognize the
[36:09] Word of God for today who he is in the
[36:13] form of the Word of God like Jesus
[36:17] in your imagination back there walking
[36:20] on the streets yes that was
[36:24] but God has and more fed himself he has
[36:29] now come back into the farm of his word
[36:33] hello glory to God hallelujah
[36:36] so now brother sisters yes taking them
[36:39] back to glory took the book amen
[36:44] now you say well brother Simon what was
[36:48] in that book why was it so important
[36:50] that the lamb had to take the book why
[36:53] was it important that Jesus had to take
[36:56] the book there in the Gospel of Luke and
[36:59] then interpret the prophecy of Isaiah
[37:03] and by manifesting the prophecy of
[37:06] Isaiah first of all I want you to know
[37:10] that that was the Seventh Seal book that
[37:14] was close but now we find that the book
[37:18] is opened as it said in the Book of Luke
[37:20] he opened the book and then he began to
[37:25] read out of the prophet Isaiah amen but
[37:30] first he opened the book then he began
[37:32] to interpret the book praise God
[37:35] hallelujah
[37:36] even so we see in the book of Revelation
[37:39] he had to open those seven seals with
[37:43] seven blasts of thunders as the word of
[37:46] God was foodless of the word seven
[37:49] number perfection came for perfect
[37:52] understanding supernatural
[37:54] interpretation and divine communication
[37:57] by the presence and power of the Holy
[38:00] Spirit
[38:00] oh thanks being a God so here my friend
[38:04] sister this mysterious book was a book
[38:07] of the seven seals and all of those
[38:10] seven seals
[38:12] it was revealing to us the mystery
[38:15] coming of Christ no man knoweth the day
[38:18] or the hour oh praise God hallelujah
[38:22] amen but now we can recognize the coming
[38:27] of the Lord the presence of the Living
[38:29] God hallelujah the mystery coming of
[38:33] Jesus Christ
[38:34] I move on from that I will expand on
[38:37] that right now but I'll move on on from
[38:40] that praise God and the mystery coming
[38:43] of Christ is not a man it's not a human
[38:46] it's the Lord and self that has this
[38:49] sentiment a shout with the voice of an
[38:52] archangel on that shop of God Oh glory
[38:55] to God hallelujah amen this body also is
[39:01] the predestinated mystery will of God in
[39:06] the Bible says in mystery
[39:08] the predestinated mystery of his will
[39:11] some years ago this was made clear that
[39:14] it is God's predestinated mystery will
[39:17] like a man has a will and that will is
[39:20] kept secret locked away for in that will
[39:24] is the names of all of his beneficiaries
[39:27] and their inheritance of what they were
[39:30] want to receive when that will was read
[39:34] by a prophet by a lawyer by one who was
[39:38] designated for that particular job and
[39:42] here we see clearly in the Word of God
[39:45] hallelujah this book count the names of
[39:50] the held the names and the portions the
[39:53] positions that places the purpose of
[39:57] these beneficiaries of what they were to
[40:02] receive thanks be to God
[40:04] brother sister so this book held the
[40:07] names of gods elected in their gods
[40:11] elected children their names were in
[40:15] their the names that were in the Lamb's
[40:20] Book of Life before the foundation of
[40:24] the world because as you know God is
[40:27] omnipotent omniscient is all-knowing the
[40:31] mark God doesn't have to wait until we
[40:36] make the decision
[40:37] to accept him to know who would accept
[40:42] him God already knew that from before
[40:44] the foundation of the world and please
[40:48] the names of those whom he already has
[40:51] for known to will receive him and place
[40:56] their names on the lamb spot of life
[41:00] there is no new name going to be written
[41:03] in glory
[41:04] for the names are already recorded in
[41:07] the Lamb's Book of Life so now we got
[41:12] from this to see that in his mystery
[41:17] coming he has come
[41:21] supernaturally to call out the names of
[41:25] this elect to call the Mount of Babylon
[41:28] called them already
[41:30] darkness call them out of any habits
[41:32] call them out of any dark depressing
[41:36] position situation any sinful chains of
[41:40] imprisonment of the body mind or spirit
[41:44] or soul that they are experiencing he
[41:48] has come to call his own and to know
[41:51] that beautiful wonderful song he knows
[41:54] my name I want you to know he knows your
[41:58] name that's how he called the chanyeol
[42:01] that's why he called Peter Andrew and
[42:03] many others in the Bible he knew their
[42:06] names he was trained to let them know
[42:08] that though he was now in a body who he
[42:12] really was that he knew their name from
[42:16] before the foundation of the world
[42:18] that's why he could say you are
[42:20] Nathanael or your name is Peter son of
[42:24] swords oh you are this person that's the
[42:28] reason why he was under that kind of
[42:31] anointing for the Spirit of God the
[42:34] fullness of the Godhead dwelt in him
[42:38] bodily he was in manual God with us but
[42:43] now he has returned to be God in us if
[42:47] we will let him come
[42:50] his habitation in I'll live within our
[42:53] hearts and lies so now we find not just
[42:58] back then but right now the seven seals
[43:02] have been revealed and God is calling up
[43:06] the names of his elect to come back to
[43:10] him and to know him enough power his
[43:12] resurrections and just as much as he
[43:15] called the disciples back there by their
[43:17] names and said come follow me they've
[43:19] never heard a person like this before
[43:22] they're never seen anything like this
[43:25] before but when they heard that boys
[43:27] when they're recognized what he was
[43:30] saying they followed him without a
[43:33] question or a shadow of doubt no bishop
[43:36] no priest no no high authority no great
[43:42] fever could stand against it because
[43:45] they were thirsting for the true Word of
[43:49] God the Fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[43:52] and the realities of failing reality of
[43:56] the Living God walking and moving around
[43:58] us and there he was standing alone look
[44:03] away the Jesus praise God so the Lord
[44:07] calling out the names of all the elect
[44:12] calling them out of the sin he is
[44:15] calling you out of your sin calling them
[44:18] to their inheritance to take possession
[44:21] was to possess their possessions he is
[44:25] calling them out by their names praise
[44:28] God calling them to take their position
[44:32] and purpose in the plan of God for all
[44:36] God's gifts find their appropriate
[44:38] places in the fullness of time praise
[44:42] God
[44:43] I want a little brother sister this
[44:45] calling is going on right now you say
[44:49] well well God is calling you out on my
[44:51] name not my
[44:53] natural names amen but your supernatural
[44:57] name by which he knew you before the
[45:02] foundation of the world the songwriter
[45:05] says yes he knew me yes he yet he loved
[45:09] me he knew you he loved you and now he's
[45:13] here by his word to come to hell
[45:16] the tension of his word and to recognize
[45:19] him who don't know his life he turned
[45:22] the Word of God so that called started
[45:25] amen and it started way back from the
[45:29] into this Gentile age as he began to
[45:32] call out his elect from the time he
[45:35] began to call his disciples and continue
[45:38] right through the book of Acts right
[45:40] through the church ages using the seven
[45:44] spirits of God the seven messengers the
[45:48] seven angels of the church which are one
[45:51] and the same oh praise God the angel
[45:55] messages of church which are men
[45:59] anointed man sent of each age that
[46:03] anyone could recognize that they are the
[46:07] messenger the angel to the church for
[46:10] the aged as Elijah was in Israel and
[46:14] even for Jezebel did not recognize him
[46:18] as her pastor yet he was because his
[46:22] life his ministry stood the test of time
[46:25] and was minded and vindicated by God and
[46:30] proved to the entire world who he was
[46:33] for his words came to pass every time
[46:36] Gordana
[46:37] and so it came right down through the
[46:40] center changes where God use each
[46:43] messenger to call out the elected for
[46:47] his particular age Luther called here's
[46:50] Wesley called years and so on right on
[46:53] down to the Pentecostal age which I
[46:57] believe and teach that brother William
[47:00] Brandon was that messenger to pet the
[47:04] Pentecostal churches to call out of the
[47:08] Pentecostal church age into the new
[47:11] church age of the capstone ministry of
[47:15] Christ himself
[47:16] call out the believers to the fullness
[47:18] of the word not bound by denominational
[47:22] boundaries not bound in their mind by
[47:25] denominational theories precepts and
[47:28] platitudes but they are they are free in
[47:31] Christ to recognize what the Word of God
[47:34] is saying to them not who do they say I
[47:39] am not who do they tell you that I am
[47:42] but when you look into the word who do
[47:46] you say I the Son of Man am who do you
[47:50] say I am what do you think of Christ The
[47:54] Anointed Word of God for the hour this
[47:57] is the question this is what is taking
[47:59] place right now praise God hallelujah so
[48:02] the names are being called but what I'm
[48:04] about to say friends when he is finished
[48:08] doing most of us is read another book

[48:15] to say to you my friends the book of
