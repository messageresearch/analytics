that you are with us even in US what a victory Lord and what an hour father to to be able to stand with confidence and no fear and to know exactly who we are and why we have been called in this last days to reveal things in these last times Lord that could not have been revealed at any other time but now and so we ask you to come and and just Minister through the word and through your minister tonight Lord here through each and every one of us give us ear ears to hear and recognize what you have for us tonight Lord we pray remembering all those that are um not well that are uh in need tonight Lord you know every situation all the requests that have come before us this week father may you just continue to meet those needs we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen praise God let's go to our scripture 1 Peter chapter 1 um same scripture that we started with blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead everything surrounds Christ we need to keep this in the center focal point of our minds this is an age now where they are removing Christ from his rightful place and position in the word of God when you do that you throw everything out and I don't care how smart or how intellectual or how much you can uh you know understand the universe and the way things work and your understanding without Christ there is no salvation there is no uh continuing City there is no ET Eternal Body amen praise God you then identify yourselves as having a beginning and an end anything that has a beginning must have an End Amen so to an inheritance Incorruptible this is not anything that can this is absolutely Incorruptible undefiled and that fadeth not away it's reserved in heaven for you amen and for me who are kept by the power of God through Revelation Faith people say faith oh I got faith I got faith faith is when God reveals to you who you are and who he is am without any confusion amen through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time in the last days the Lord add His blessings to the word of God Amen praise God God so um you know uh let's read that that quote again um next slide here brother Braham speaking and he says and these things that we're talking about was to be revealed when at the last days amen just before the last trumpet at the end of the message of the last Church age how many knows we've already we've already uh transitioned from leoda the bride has already trans IED amen everything under the seven Church Ages was led by man the the uh uh the eighth day okay the holy convocation if you go back into the into the feasts of of Israel there was an eighth day and it was the Holy convocation and that was back to the beginning again that was another day it was an eternal day the beginning was eternal the end will be Eternal amen praise God and so we need to understand that the church age uh you know the leod deian church age though we are physically still in it the bride is operating in a realm above it it's called this the the the Eternal Church age it's where there is an eternal messenger where Christ has already come amen praise God that's right and if you want to read that now you can turn to I just referred to you last night three times Revelations 10 1-7 see and in the days of the sounding of the seventh Angel's message the mystery of God would be revealed and finished and so we know that that through the the ministry of William Maryam Branham certain scripture was fulfilled and one of them was Revelations 10 1 through 7 amen where the seventh angel because there was seven Church age men Messengers amen remember while brother brandham was was preaching this he was the seventh angel to the seventh Church age we were still under the dispensation of time we were still under the dispensation of man amen but as we know that there was different anointings the man anointing through Luther and and and so forth until we came to the eagle anointing which was Eagle is prophetic and that was William bram's Ministry the seventh Church age and he was the messenger to the Pentecostal Church age understanding that we were still under man under time at that time but when the seventh when the seventh angel was what brother Brandon was told to go back to Jeffersonville to preach the opening of The Seven Seals that was a supernatural event that that took us from time to Eternity from an Earthly Messenger to a Heavenly messenger which was Christ The Mighty Angel amen praise God and so it's important to understand these things when when it comes to um you know placing where we are now a lot of people are still stuck under William brandham under a man Ministry though he was a prophetic Ministry they're still stuck on oh you just got to listen to the tapes you got to you got to only say what the tapes say and they're not recognizing the transition from the mighty angel coming down himself it was Christ himself coming to meet and Unite with the body and people want to stay with the with the sign post the one that was pointing just like John the Baptist Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world okay they had to leave John and follow Christ and when brother brandham said uh you know that he had even he even said himself he's gonna have to go off the scene in order for him to come on the scene and take his rightful position and that's the message that we Preach Today that's what separates us and transitions us from denominational Church to the Eternal Church where Christ is now operating in a people yes through a five-fold Ministry speaking to you individually remember when Mary listen when when when Jesus was on the earth he had a public Ministry he was publicly going to different places uh you know he would debate with the Pharisees they would challenge him and everything else but after the Resurrection Mary goes to the to the tomb to go and and see uh you know you know where they had laid him and she goes there and she didn't actually recognize when she went to the tomb there was somebody standing there and she asked him if he had seen where Jesus was she couldn't actually recognize that it was him until he spoke her name until he said Mary and then her understanding was opened what was that that was now him going to individuals no longer going to the people they had rejected the word they had crucified the word it was no longer going to be to a mass amount of people it was going to be to individuals Christ speaking directly look the the brothers the disciples on the road to EMAs he walked right up to them remember they were with him but their eyes were held that's why Christ can be here and so many people will not recognize him because he has to open your eyes he has to open your understanding so that you can recognize that it's him that he's here now unveiling himself personally he it wasn't until he broke the bread with the disciples that their eyes were opened what is what is breaking the bread breaking the word opening the word of God so that you could recognize what was actually going on and from that point on Christ was making himself known personally to individuals and that's what he's doing now he's in that Ministry now it's not about John the Baptist it's not about William Branham though you could never remove William Branham from the portion of the word that he fulfilled and the ministry that he fulfilled but he went off the scene he's no longer here and and we need to get our Focus On Christ the word he's telling you listen it's me but he opens the eyes and the understanding of whom he chooses we don't open people's eyes we can invite them to come into the house of the Lord we can invite yeah come to Good Neighbor Ministries everybody is welcome but people will come and they will go people will come and they will stay because they will say you alone have the words of eternal life not Pastor Danny or whoever's ministering behind here Christ himself unveiling himself personal by Revelation breaking the bread of the word opening the word to you individually so that you can recognize he's alive he's a reality he's not a denominational Christ but he's the Living God in the power of his resurrection amen praise God so when this took place um you know uh let's read let's read the uh the quote and these things um yeah the second seal and these things that we're talking about was to be revealed in the last days just before the last trumpet at the end of the message of the last Church age that's right if you want to read that now you can turn to it I just referred to it last night three times Revelations 10: 1-7 and in the day days of the sounding of the seventh Angel's message the mystery of God would be revealed and finished so you need to understand that the opening of The Seven Seals was what brought Christ to the Earth it wasn't William branam that open those seals remember the mighty angel in Revelations 10:7 is standing there with one foot on the land one foot on the sea okay and he's got a book in his hand and it's open so the book had already been open remember so now and there's only one thing left when this seventh sealed book is open than the entire mystery of God why we've probed at it through the years and according to the scripture then there was no way to understand it until this day brother bram's talking about his day amen okay that's where God had unveiled those seven seals brother B says my God if the angel had not come into the room every night to correct me on what my interpretation was on these seals I would have made a mess of it because Christ had to open those seals no man was worthy to loose the seals thereof so don't don't go be looking back and say oh William brandham opened the seals no he didn't open the seals he was the messenger that was sent to speak and preach and be the voice of God in that age in order to speak the mind of the mighty Angel himself who had come down amen there was no way to understand it until this day because it's been hid we've seen the symbol that it was symbolized by but it could not be correctly revealed until the last day see now then we must be there at at the end time and so this now is what is in progress right now this this aspect of the word being fulfilled through the opening of those seals it's in progress a lot of people thought that um you know even in the message even now people are thinking that that when the Seven Seals were opened it was revealing things that were to come but we know that the first six seals were almost all fulfilled amen but but it had to be properly placed the events the the the the characters people did not understand that the seals that the first six seals had all been opened under the seven Church ages it all started happening right from from Pentecost all the way down down up until now and that pale horse rider the fourth Rider he's still riding and you know where he's riding now in the message where he could be so deceiving that he would deceive even the very elect if it were possible but it's not possible am it's impossible because you can't deceive Christ and it's Christ back in his church again amen praise God Halle so so uh when brother brandham ministered on those seals it it was it allowed the spirit of Christ to unveil what was under each of those seals the Mysteries that were locked up under those seals of who the the horse riders were that you know a lot of people even now there's some that are still preaching that the white horse rider is Christ but BR God's Prophet caught the Revelation and and the Lord revealed to him him no that's Satan it's just him changing his his his placing and his levels of deception through the church ages all the way down through you can you can look from the first horse rider all the way down and you you'll see through the first second third fourth Church age how they all correlate how they run parallel how those characters operated how the same Spirits were operating throughout the Dark Ages with the red horse rider the black horse rider the black horse riders War right we went through World War I World War I and there is a World War II all of these things were opened up under the six seal and it's history now but World War II is still to come amen and so Satan just he was just changing his disguise from one to the other so the six seals was was being un veiled through the seven Church ages without the opening of the of the Seven Seals the book would still be closed that's why the book needed to be open everything would have still been sealed the mystery of Christ finished when William brandham spoke those Seven Seals and when he got to the seventh seal Christ had fully come and took his position now to go and meet with the church and to call individuals into the body of Christ amen praise God but the book had to be open and now the book has to be transferred in typ form okay into the hands of the Bride let's continue on and you'll understand that even more okay so the mighty angel in Revelation 10 now standing saying time shall be no more because the book was open when that book opened it was to unveil an eternal church it was it was yet when the book was open seven Thunders uttered their voices but then John was told you can't write that why was that not written that was a portion of the word that was to remain sealed in those seals though the seals were open but yet the Thunders were not revealed so you know you wonder well why what was going on there well let's move along so the opening of The Seven seal uh took place through the ministry of William Branham it brought Jesus Jesus Christ in his second coming we need to understand what those seals what the seventh seal actually did it brought Christ cuz remember 1 to six was all history but the seventh brings Christ on the scene it's what brought Jesus Christ in his second coming a lot of people out there a lot of churches 99% of Christian churches are still waiting on the second coming of Jesus Christ he's here he's already come and they're and they're waiting for him to show up in the clouds he's already showed up in the cloud oh my what an hour we're living in amen and he's here he's now operating in the bride to fulfill right now the Rapture of the church remember the next major event is the rapture it's in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we're going to be changed praise God hallelujah let's go to the next scripture so there's review here and then there's whatever the Lord added here in my notes so and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and 4 and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of oders which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song now it was a totally different song because now somebody had taken the lamb had taken the book and had loosed the seals and they sung a new song Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain has redeemed us to God by the blood of out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on Earth notice there and behold and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the and the elders and the number of them was 10,000s times 10 thousands and thousands of thousands amen praise God there's going to be a a a a Hallelujah re reuniting up there let me tell you because this is what uh this is telling us they were singing a brand new song they had entered into a a a a revelation that they were going to be restored back to their rightful position because remember in the other scriptures in in in uh Revelations 5 John wept John was panicking because there was nobody that could actually take the book so there was something that was that was that that that was being held back and John was was panicking like all of all of everything would be be lost the whole earth everybody would be lost nothing would be would would be complete the whole Plan of Redemption would have gone down the drain in John's eyes if somebody had not been able to take that book and to loose now remember it's not a literal book get that out of your head we're talking about a book we're thinking and I know our minds operate you know when we say a word we immediately associate with a book but you need to see beyond the book the book is God it's Christ it's not even god listen before there could be a god there had to be something to worship God so God was God is just a word that that that describes an object of worship amen he was the self-existent one the Eternal one amen praise God and so there was there was Great Tribulation in the heavens because nobody could be found to open this book amen glory to God let's read now let me see here so in Revelations 10: 1-7 the head comes to meet with the body showing that the spirit man Adam was coming to hand the book to the spirit man bride okay this is an event that's taking place you got to you got to understand what what this whole Plan of Redemption engulfs it's God redeeming his own amen put the heat down just a little bit please God redeeming his own God coming back to restore Adam and Eve amen okay glory to God anything or person that had a beginning must have an end but there's an invisible Union that had to take place it was the spirit God Adam restored coming to meet with the with the spirit part female aspect of himself amen so because we are not any longer identif ified As Time beings though we operate in time our true identities as Sons and Daughters of God are Eternal and we need to understand that we are matched with an eternal mate Adam and Eve back in the very beginning when God created Adam In His Image made that made him male and female called their name Adam I know you've heard this but you got to you got to bring the the the clarity of the revelation of what I'm saying here because it's so important to understand who you are and what it is that God is doing in the true church in this hour it's not about church going it's not about joining a church that's all that's all traditions of man that's all traditions of man we need to get we need to live our our our our our thinking our our senses our in our intuition to to a level of faith into Heavenly places where we can see our rightful positions as Sons and Daughters of God we are not creatures of time we are creatures of Eternity the only ones that can go back to Eternity are those that came from eternity amen we are not identified with time anymore more even though we're in it but we are the final voice to the Gentile dispensation that operates in time because that's their position their their position is not in the body of Christ remember all that was in God he poured into Christ all that was in Christ he poured into the church so actually what's happening is God is calling ACH church out of the churches and that's why we've been called out people think we're strange where what is this that you believe we believe the word you see that's that's what came and called you you're not oh I believe a prophet God sent a prophet yeah you believe God sent a prophet because you believe the word you wouldn't you wouldn't be able to believe sorry I was going to sneeze there you wouldn't be able to believe that God sent a prophet unless you believed the word that says behold I send unto you Elijah the prophet you wouldn't be able to believe that you wouldn't be able to identify with that unless you could believe the word and that's why when when you say to somebody well how are you baptized and and they don't even know they oh I got baptized as a baby they never look to see if their experience lined up up with the word because God is not going to judge you based on your priest's interpretation or your Church's interpretation he's going to judge you according to his word hallelujah so we are the last and final voice to the Gentile Christian Church age amen hallelujah so now we understand that the mighty angel came to open the book which was sealed by Seven Seals and thus the requirement of William branham's prophetic ministry as a prophet to preach the Seven Seals to spiritually open the book loose the seals the word thundered out so when the when the Thunders took place he was told not to write that and that was right in Revelations 10 1-7 and and to this day there's no interpretation on the Thunders why because it's being manifest in you and me so John was not permitted to write it because it could only be revealed in the last time God had placed himself a portion of the word identified in each and every one of you as individuals in this time in 2024 I don't know when this is all going to end but until it does come to the Fulfillment of the Rapture there's going to be attributes Sons and Daughters of God that are going to hear this message and they're going to be able to respond to the message because it's God calling their name remember when Jesus said Mary he called her name and immediately her eyes were open it takes Christ to call the individual amen praise God and that's all in the Thunders and the Thunders was all in the book it was all sealed in the book remember when the seals were open seven Thunders uttered their voices these Thunders have voices yes they do so the seals are open but the Thunders are not revealed they're Unwritten listen to brother brandham here and then there is coming forth seven mysterious Thunders that's not even written at all that's right and I believe that those that through those seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing Faith did you hear that I'll read it one more time and I believe that through those seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing Faith because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it see brother brandham realized right and here he was in the midst of so much Supernatural in his ministry people would walk up into his prayer lines and he would look at them and the angel of the Lord would would show him a vision would break right in front of him and he'd look at the woman he would he would tell them what their name was where they lived where they were yesterday they were with a doctor and he had a dark he had dark hair on his name was Dr so and so and he told you that that that you know that your test results had produced this and that you had cancer and that you had this much time to live and the person would just go into shock and say how could this be how can this man here William brandham was experiencing so much Supernatural somebody died right in his M right in his meetings and he said hold on just wait let's see what the Lord is going to do went there prayed over the individual right back to life back to the service again a dead a woman brings a dead child from early in the morning she had held that dead child in that meeting in Mexico for hours and hours and it wasn't until that night that the holy spirit said call up the woman to bring the child because God had showed him that that child was going to live and the child was brought to him dead affidavit signed by doctors proven 100% God was doing so much Supernatural in his ministry but yet here he says that we we wouldn't be able to produce the rapture there is something we've got to step farther he knew there would be a progression to the word of God and here we are 60 years later things are progressing the word is progressing the word is unveiling itself he's the same God but yet he's got something within those Thunders that's now in you and me and operating in our lives to fulfill this word and to bring something that's going to give us rapturing faith in our lives listen the Rapture is already in progress It's already started in your life your friends and your family they've been missing you for years they know you're not the same person that you used to be because now you are being led by the spirit of God you're no longer led by man you're no longer led by man's intellectual teaching it only goes so far you can sit talk with scientists and and theologians and you can talk with very smart intellectual people but yet they don't even come even one% of what God has revealed to you personally imagine that and it's not because you did anything it's because your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life it's because you were ordained as an attribute to be awakened to who you are in this day simple Hallelujah he says we've got to step farther we can't have enough faith for Divine Healing hardly we've got to have enough Faith to be changed in a moment and be swept up out of this Earth and we'll find that after a while the Lord willing find where it's written God is revealing that it's written somewhere but it's not written in a book cuz it's not even a book it's written in Epistles read of all men it's written in the volume of the book it's written in the body of Jesus Christ it's written in you and me fulfilling the word for our day identifying ourselves as the body of Christ in this day and in this hour Hallelujah the whole mystery that was revealed in the opening of that seventh seal was around the manifestation of God throughout the entire book remember from Genesis to Revelation you should be able to see Christ in type form it was always God fulfilling his Plan of Redemption manifesting type in type form through Abraham his first appearing was MDC it was Christ Christ the one who had no beginning and no end appears to Abraham the second time he comes what does he do he appears to Sarah and tells her about a promise that she's going to bring forth first he comes to the man then he comes to who the bride Hallelujah glory to God God comes to Sarah to unveil unto her that she's going to bring forth a son a supernatural son it's going to require her to be changed her bodies need to her her body needs to go from old to young again hallelujah we're being changed line upon line precept upon precept because we are going to bring forth a body change you can see him everywhere he's in every type in Joseph he's every it's Christ the same yesterday today and forever if we are the bride then we are not confused by the godhead as a matter of fact we have recognized that all that was in Christ has now been poured into us the church amen you got to come to a place where you recognize that you got to stop playing Church you got to stop playing religion we're not religious we are a million miles from being religious we are the sons and daughters of God amen and God brings forth Gods I know it's a little hard you know but you know what you're going to have to come to a place where your mind breaks into the mind of God this is not about exalting man it's never been about exalting man remember there was no man in heaven or on the earth that would be found worthy so there's no man or any woman there's none of you or no big minister no big Pope there's absolutely no one that can open and take the book it had to be Christ Adam the Lord Elohim the self-existent one the spirit man the almighty he's the only one that could take the book and unveil his plan and he's the only one that can say you are in and you are out he's the only one that could say my sheep hear my voice he's the only one that could say all that the Father the spirit the spirit God the Elohim the self-existent one all that he had thought and planned in his mind will come if you're an attribute you must come and it was all written in that book but there was going to be a time when the seals were going to be ripped off the book there was going to be a time like all of a sudden like we said when we ministered there a couple weeks ago there's no real talk about a book in the whole Old Testament not in any way shape or form the way that the book is being unveiled now and we know that the book is the Bible but yet the Bible is sealed unless God opens it to you that was the whole thing that's why the scripture says in Corinthians that the spirit gives the word life the letter kills the same Bible that scriptures that we read there's people reading it and they're reading it with no revelation of who God is and therefore there's no life because life only comes from God himself Hallelujah glory to God so no man could take the book no one could be found but notice that the book was at one time with Adam and Eve because brother brandom said we read the quote where Adam lost the book because the book was the book of life it was it was the book of that that that contained everything that was in the mind of God every single uh portion of himself that would be manifest Eternal everyone that that was was was in that book and Adam was was had the book when he was expressed in the image of God now remember don't physically think it's a book understand that he's the book but you have to be in the right position in order to unveil the pure unadulterated word of God without any any interpretation of man that's why Satan so so so when when Adam lost the book remember Eve was in Adam when he was in the spirit man form when God created let us make man in our image you were there the US was you and me we were there we were in the mind of God we were we were his female you know we're just using the word female aspect but it's God God expressed himself as male and female that's why he called their name Adam male and female but it wasn't until God created that body and Adam looked at her and called her name Eve it was then that she was identified with a different name before that she was Adam before we were in this dimension we were God we were with God Amen but he looks he calls her name Eve because he knew Adam knew he was the book he knew because the whole Paradox is that he's got a Plan of Redemption in the back of his mind and that's a that's something a lot of people forget to to identify and and bring to the surface that God has a plan Glory he has a plan he wanted to redeem he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a Healer so he called her Eve because he knew that she would be the beding ground for serpent seed he knew that there was going to be a deceiver that was going to come and plant his own seed into Eve so that he could create for himself Satan wanted to be a Creator like God why so he could have people worship him and that's why he's got all these people worshiping him all over the Earth 98% of the people are deceived into worshiping Satan through all the political and World Systems that we are in today I was reading just yesterday about or this morning about about the religions of the world my wife and I were fellowshipping we're talking about yeah the the the the number one religion in the world is Christianity with 2 something billion people that identify with Christianity second is Islam and they're at like 1.7 or six billion I can't remember the exact number but do you know that the Jewish religion is 0.2 of 1% not even 1% I said to Sister Jen I said do you see do you see how how how because Israel always types the bride and you see now why our faith and our belief in the word of God is less than 1% of the whole population yeah there's 2. something bill yeah we call ourselves Christians because we are Christlike but we identify with the word and just like when Jesus was on the earth and he walked amongst the people he was being followed by a dozen people there was millions and only a dozen people were following the word you need to see something there Saints you are a minority don't think people are going to you think but how can they not see this how can they not see that God sent a prophet how can they not see the the the restoration of the seven churches it's all history it's all in the it's on Google you can look it all up you can they'll look up John Wesley they'll look up Martin Luther they'll look up Martin they'll look up Paul the first Messenger to the Ephesian Church age they'll see all of that they'll see that it's all history and when they come to William Bram the seventh Church age messenger who was the one that would that would turn the hearts of the children back to the original faith in other words to bring us back to the word because Satan had infiltrated all the church ages and gone off with trinitarian Doctrine with uh you know praying to to to the Virgin Mary you know whatever wherever he could get you off the word it would be enough to get you away from Christ right up until today where they got the New Age movement and where they'll talk about everything and they'll even say that Christ was a master oh yes he reached the highest level of Consciousness not recognizing he's the absolute key he says no man comes to the father but by me no one goes back to Eternity but through me that's the plan you I you you you you remove him from the plan you can never go back it identifies that you never even came from there because only Eternal thoughts of God which is God himself and God can't make mistakes God's omniscient he's omnipresent he knows the beginning from the end he knows he he knows how many times a fly bats his eye because he's infinite and you want to go and tell the infinite God how the plan is going to work you want it to work no no it's going to work the way I say never mind this Jesus guy we're going to do it my way I'm a scientist don't you know I've got 17 degrees on my business card l l d d p h g a b c d e f g f for fool it's as simple as that because God is infinite God reveals himself to whom he will he says the scripture says in Hebrews uh 12 that without faith Hebrews 11 without faith it's impossible to please God and you want to tell him the way that it is without God revealing himself you you know nothing Hallelujah glory to God Amen praise God Amen so here now let's go to the next slide um the six seal here he says and she sorry it says that's the reason John wept because if no one could get the book all creation everything was gone she would just simply turn back to atoms and molecules and so forth in Cosmic light and not even be creation person nothing else cuz Adam lost the rights to that book there it is he forfeited it when he listened to his wife and she listened to Satan's reasoning instead of the word of God and that's what the world that's what the world is listening to they're listening to Satan's reasoning on Consciousness the universe Source levels of understanding and they want to leave out Jesus that's all Satan's teachings I'm going to tell it the way it is the truth is what sets you free you reject the truth you reject salvation it's as simple as that Adam lost the rights to the book he forfeited it when he listened to his wife and she listened to Satan's reasoning instead of the word of God see it was forfeited then it couldn't go back into the dirty hands of Satan who tempted her out of the way so therefore it went back to its original owner like any abstract deed would do see goes right back to its original owner and that was God the Creator Elohim Source the absolute it had to go back to him because he's the one who planned it all he's the Creator he made it and he holds it and there's a price and that's Redemption because part of the plan was that there would need to be a redeemer for sin and that's why Christ is the key there is some price for Redemption and there was nobody could do it so he said made his laws his own laws of kinsman redeemer that's why Adam is the only one that could redeem Eve and Adam was God no doctrine of man no teaching of man no other Buddhist or Hinduism or own attributes if you're redeeming something it means you owned it at one time God is redeeming himself back to himself this there's a scripture where Christ is reconciling the church back to himself and so there's some price for Redemption he said made his laws his own laws of kinsman redeemer then they could could find nobody everybody was born of sex that was the original sin anything that was born of sex could not open the book could not be in the book could not listen when you open a book you're revealing something right something is in that's being revealed well if you were not in the book how are you going to be revealed you could only be in in the book if you were always a part of the book and remember we're not talking about a book get that book out of your head every man was born of sex born of after sexual desire he was in the original sin Satan and Eve there's the original sin Satan and Eve so he could not do it there is nothing in him no holy Pope PRI priest doctor of divinity whoever he might be he would he would nobody worthy and he couldn't be an angel because it had to be a Kinsman it couldn't even be an angel if God is going to redeem God then it's got to be God as the kinsman redeemer you're making yourself God no we are Eve that was was in Adam that God created in his own image in the beginning am if that's a little easier for you to Pal it then receive it that way because people will turn around and say oh this church you know the these people are thinking they're God they're going to find out that God lives in his word and God lives in the body Hallelujah then God himself become a Kinsman by taking on human flesh that's why Jesus had to come by a supernatural birth not by sex that's just common understanding and knowledge all the churches know that they're all worshiping Mary at this time of the year because she apparently is the mother of God like God can now have a mother the self-existent one no she had to be a virgin God had to show through the Spoken Word by sending an angel that that's how originally it would be done in the beginning all that Adam would have had to do when he expressed Eve was call Sons and Daughters of God out of that Dimension into this one he could just speak it and that's what he did when he sent the angel to Mary and Mary said be it unto me according to Thy word because the word said Mary you're going to bring forth a son and you're going to call his name Jesus and he is going to be the savior of all mankind and that's why John the Baptist when he saw his cousin he said Behold the Lamb of God and who took the book a lamb was able to take the book and that lamb was not another individual that could go up and take the book out of the hand of God that was sitting in the throne it was the lamb changing his disguise he was going from lamb he was going from God to the lamb coming to the Earth Emmanuel the word was made flesh and dwelt among us so that he could be a sacrifice hallelujah praise God through the Virgin birth taking on flesh through the Virgin birth it had to be a virgin birth glory and he shed his blood that wasn't the blood of a Jew it wasn't the blood of a gentile it was the blood of God see the Bible said we're saved through the blood of God which was Jesus Christ and you want to leave him out good luck good luck hallelujah praise God Amen so let's just move along here here we're going to wind this right down another 5 minutes we're done amen we could you know you could just go on all all night long this is this is this is glorious I don't know about you I'm in Heavenly places I'm rejoicing I could hear this over and over and over and over again because it's telling me who we are it's giving us identity of who we really are that this life we we struggle I tell you right now tomorrow morning there's going to be a bunch of you you're going to be complaining you're going to be all upset you're going to be going to work ah I hate this job because you're still stuck in this but wake up move a little higher come up hither move your thoughts out of this Dimension get your head out of the out of the out of the the the the this human stockpile of of sin and unbelief it's a rat race don't get caught by the by the routine of life every day acknowledge Jesus Christ Christ your healer your savior your provider and and even more so that now your hope is that he's in you that's the hope of glory that's that's our Victory this world is falling apart Saints all the political systems are fall even our political system right here in Canada is completely falling apart and there're supposed to be the ones ruling the world but the scripture said very clearly that they would all fall apart there will be no successful government until Jesus Christ sets up the millennial Reign right here on this Earth for 10,000 years of peace and he's going to have some real Governors glory to God hallelujah so here let's go to the next slide I just want you to notice these are things that I I picked up I was reading I thought oh look at this comparison on Revelations 5 1 11 and Revelations 10 1-11 notice that here in Revelations 5: 1-7 they are crying for someone to take the book and in Revelations 10 1-7 the mighty Angel has the book and it's now open then in Revelations 58-11 the lamb takes the book and in Revelations 108 to1 John a type of the Bride is now asked to take the book so here it is in in in Revelations 5 and in Revelations 10 you've got a parallel running again God showing he's the same yesterday today and forever and there's one that's got to take the book now Revelations 108-111 he's telling John a type of the Bride which is you and me to take the book in other words to take and believe the word that's been revealed to you that's been given to you to unveil this great mystery of God which is God it's the the great mystery listen Christ The Mystery of God it's always been God unveiling himself in his identification with man the whole Bible all the way from Genesis right up until the end of the book of Revelation where he says and the spirit and the bre died say come you see it's always been God in relation to man God in relation to be in man to be to be possessing man God look God the the Old Testament was the Lord above us then Christ comes and he's God with us as Brethren but today it's God in us it's God being restored back everything that that that he did in the beginning had to be reversed that's why the first Adam fell but the second Adam which is Christ doesn't fall amen it's the it's it's the restoration of the true church bringing her back into her rightful position and so here now this book that the bride is now taking she's told to take the book eat it so that she can prophesy because Faith cometh by hearing the word and if you're a carrier of the word everything you do everything you say your life is an expression of God's word yeah there's human mixed up with it that's why you know your carnal mind is at emnity that's why you'll struggle even to get to church because your your your your your carnality will will will put all kinds of obstacles in your way and if you're still living too much in the flesh you get you get pulled by those things that are in the flesh that's just nature it's human nature they call it but that's why your greatest enemy is this thing right here you got to overcome it you got to eat the book you got to you got to you got to allow the word to be uh uh completely ingested into your entire life that's why David he would put up sayings all around him the Lord the Lord is a lamp unto my feet blessed is the man whom the Lord does not impute iniquity because I make mistakes all the time but here the Lord tells me I'm Justified I'm I'm as though I never done it in the first you've got to live in the word while you're living in this life you're not going to I'm not talking about being super religious where you're anytime you go out and you see people praise God I am a son of God Hallelujah glory to God you need to receive the word of God you're going to hell if you don't that's not what it's about that's not what Jesus did he lived the word he allowed the word to live through him it's an unconscious living amen glory to God and so when the word was was was uh when the when the seals were open those Thunders they were re they they they were re they revealed something but John wasn't allow to write it because it's now being placed in the book in The Bride in order for it to be revealed now those Thunders are thundering right now right here this evening those Thunders are being unveiled because we are the book we hold the book we've taken the book we've allowed the word of God to to to fully immerse our lives and our lives are starting to manifest the word and and and and supernaturally things will happen around your life you're not going to need to try to put anything on this is not about oh I got to read the Bible I got to read from morning till night I can't go to work I got to read the word no no you got to go to work it's it's a revelation you've come to recognize who you are and now because of that all of a sudden we read those quotes where you know and I and I and I've got the quotes here but I I I don't want to go over them again but you know I'll just go to you know maybe let's just finish up with this quote okay I read it last time but this will become a little more real to you to see that you're not putting something on he's doing it he's in you he's he's going to do these things don't don't worry about the next bill yes it's going to come but trust him do what you know you're supposed to do pay your tithes give your offerings the Lord will do the rest amen he will supernaturally work into all of those situations if you really do believe a lot of people say they believe but they don't I can tell by their testimony negative negative negative because they're they don't really believe that God can do it and so they want to put their interpretation on it and it's negative and every time you speak something against the word of God you're pushing it away from you instead of allowing it to pour into your life Hallelujah let's read it here next slide as she is part of the groom true to him in every Point waiting the wedding uniting not The ecumenical council but in the sky at the wedding supper she has been given she's been given this this is not something that that you worked for that's why I highlighted she's been given this is for our own church brother Braham speaking about the body of Christ she has been given she has been given and revealed to her the seven seal Mysteries of the Bible she sees the Folly of the deceiver she sees through all the lies of the enemy so very close to the truth that it would almost deceive the elected she sees it see the two opposing Spirits at work in this evil age can you see it every each very religious Cain and Abel Spirits again coming to their heads still same as they started one worshiping by Beauty and one by knowledge and by education and by science and by ethics and the other one the bride by faith of the revelation of the word of God if God's revealed to you that he's Jehovah Gyra then live it don't fear live it do your work do what you have to do God will multiply and provide every Financial need that you have Hallelujah both of them is standing right in this building this morning that's right there's a Believer and an unbeliever next slide but in obedience this little faith woman that lives by Revelation the bride the person here there one is over here one's is what he's saying one over here off somewhere else some other Church some other denomination wherever she is if she hears this message she could be in another denomination with 10,000 members in that church but if God wants to reveal himself to that one she'll come out that's why the scripture says come out of her my people be ye not partakers of her fornications her sin her unbelief they claim to know Christ but they reject the word Hallelujah but there's one here there's one there believes the word of God obedient waiting in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed what age this age the bride age the Thunders in the bride the Thunders is now in the bride because she's taken the book and the book is him she's United with him she's one with him Eve back with Adam again in their original Spirit man form in the image of God she will be bone of his bone flesh of his flesh amen glory to God she's waiting for that to be confirmed she is watching for it she is a part of that word and she is watching for her life to manifest that word did you hear that she's watching for her life to manifest the word she's not trying to put it on she's making making herself ready by knowing what to do with the word by feeding on the word assembling herself coming together allowing the word to to to to break her her her Pride to break down all of her own ideas and her own ways of of her interpretation on how things should be no she's allowing the word to manifest she's allowing that life to be manifested in her Brethren can't you see that I hope that didn't go over you you say something like this I hope you can hear what he's saying here I hope it hasn't gone over your head amen I know you're tired but let the word manifest itself through you don't you try to put something on you try to put something on you'll be a hypocrite God don't want Hypocrites the body is waiting for which is the word the body is a word the body is the word that's what's going in the Rapture waiting for the life which is the spirit to confirm or make it alive that's what she's waiting for no other life will work in her she can't come to life any other way do you see how you can't miss this you're either in or you're out yet she feels it out there she knows it's going to happen then here it happens then she wakes up God said let Let There Be and she came forth like the first one come forth the real Church of God is watching for the coming of that glad Millennial day let the musicians come Glory Glory Hallelujah praise God go to the next scripture we're going to close with and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifested in the flesh God is manifesting in your flesh but you're not justified in the flesh you can only be justified in the spirit it's only when you recognize that you were a son or a daughter of God you were part of that Spirit man Adam in the beginning only then are you truly Justified and you will not allow sin and unbelief to bring you under condemnation there is therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Christ you recognize that you're in the word you're in the body that greater is he that is in you you've come to realize it it's become a reality in your life seed of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory and that's what's going on right now God moving in your flesh justifying you in the spirit preaching to the final Gentile age just before we get received back up into Glory Hallelujah glory to God and
