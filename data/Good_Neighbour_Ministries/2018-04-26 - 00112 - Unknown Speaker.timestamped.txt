[2:29] he gives us faith in this topic were so
[2:32] discouraged that we're down that's how
[2:34] the people of God continue to move in
[2:37] this vein in the South amendment so
[2:40] let's not waste any more time I don't
[2:42] mind one who came to hear the word to
[2:44] receive the Word of God so we were here
[2:50] that sudden we had a wonderful word of
[2:52] God of the tip speaking from the Book of
[2:54] Ezekiel speaking about how we need to go
[2:57] deeper we go to the depths you know but
[3:02] sometimes fear keeps us from going to
[3:05] those steps because we think we're on
[3:06] our own we think that we gotta go there
[3:08] alone but that's not the way it is God
[3:11] is with us
[3:12] God has called you to go deeper into
[3:15] walk the poor with God intently to go
[3:18] beyond all your traditions
[3:30] so that you're fully empty you can never
[3:55] stop growing in Christ if you ever
[3:58] thought get bored you know this is all
[4:02] there is we need to get back on your
[4:05] knees got a plan that's not appropriate
[4:08] pops up to something think God's taking
[4:11] us out of here he then he's not and I'm
[4:13] just glad to be a part of the plea we've
[4:15] heard many times he's up to something
[4:18] I'm just glad I could be a partner so
[4:22] let's pray before we go to the Word of
[4:24] God we're going to be reading from The
[4:25] Book of Ezekiel and actually going to be
[4:28] from Ephesians chapter four first and
[4:33] then let's pray father

[4:43] opportunity to come and be your voice

[4:49] lord allow the spirit to move us aside
[4:53] and just let us just completely be

[4:59] desire of every son and daughter of a

[5:04] you want you to hear through us we want
[5:06] you want your will and your mind and
[5:08] your purpose for this day right now what
[5:11] we have data for so that we can
[5:13] leader year encouraged and ready to meet
[5:16] whatever challenges before us
[5:18] granted father remember our past
[5:20] courtesies on with his wife on rest you
[5:24] know type of vacation Lord liberate them

[5:38] love we appreciate them if you love
[5:40] appreciate you giving you all the praise
[5:45] Jesus
[6:08] today we're going to be speaking to you
[6:11] from the book of Ephesians and then
[6:15] we're also going to be looking at the
[6:16] book if you seek you will let's read the
[6:19] first virtue
[6:33] okay so we're speaking out the series
[6:35] we're gonna continue in a series that we
[6:37] started many years ago calling the
[6:40] resurrection today's title is owned to
[6:44] his born from Ephesians chapter 4 verse
[6:47] 16 it says from whom the whole body
[6:49] fitly joined together and compacted by
[6:53] that which every joint supplieth
[6:56] according to the effectual working in
[6:59] the measure of every part make an
[7:03] increase of the body unto the edifying
[7:14] of itself in love the Lord has blessed
[7:28] so today we're looking at how it is that
[7:34] this body of price is now coming
[7:36] together that there is a season where
[7:41] each and every one of us are going to
[7:45] have to join together into the body of
[7:48] Christ and make up and finalize that
[7:55] bride so that she can fulfill the part
[7:58] of the word that she is Ephesians
[8:01] chapter 4 talks about how the whole body
[8:03] is fiddly joined together every one of
[8:06] us has a part there's a boat coming to
[8:10] his boat and that's that's you know
[8:13] we're going to be looking at that
[8:14] we do tcpo but we need to realize as the
[8:17] background you know to make it a
[8:20] background here what we're going to be
[8:21] looking at is that each and every one of
[8:23] us has a part each and every one of us
[8:25] must come into our positions each and
[8:29] every one of us must realize the hour
[8:31] that we're living in and the purpose
[8:34] that it is that God has called us this
[8:37] is the alley where each part of the body
[8:39] of Christ comes together every one of us
[8:43] must come to our position must recognize
[8:46] that we are important in the body of
[8:49] Jesus Christ that we are important in
[8:51] the fulfillment of God's plan in order
[8:54] to produce the rapture of the church
[8:57] this is what we've been taught to do
[8:59] this is the part that we are fulfilling
[9:02] when we look into the Word of God we
[9:05] should be seeing the the revealed Word
[9:07] for this hour which is to bring you into
[9:10] perfect faith to bring you into a place
[9:12] where you can be a part of the body that
[9:16] edifies the body of Jesus Christ but
[9:20] you're just not a church member that
[9:22] you're not just coming till you know to
[9:24] join the church and say well I belong to
[9:26] a church and that's enough to take me in
[9:29] the rapture it's not enough you must be
[9:32] back to be operating in the body of
[9:35] Jesus Christ under a revelation of a
[9:38] perfect faith that God is giving you an
[9:40] anointing to fulfill you
[9:43] we must together we must bow to this
[9:48] boat goddess deciding this church has
[9:51] placed this church here in Burlington
[9:53] for a purpose yes it just placed this
[9:56] church here just for the sake of another
[9:58] Church on the corner if that was the
[10:01] case we'd be filled with people this
[10:06] place would be loaded we have people all
[10:09] across the back there if we were if we
[10:11] were operating under the the the kind of
[10:14] 19mm and the the atmospheres that the
[10:18] church is up there producing we can fill
[10:20] this place but that's not the kind of
[10:26] [Music]
[10:33] history because we want to know what
[10:36] time we're in we want to get to where we
[10:40] are and sometimes we need to review you
[10:43] know the purpose of the Old Testament
[10:45] and what it was that God was showing
[10:48] throughout the whole Old Testament and
[10:50] so we're going to just a really brief
[10:52] quick review I came across this
[10:55] PowerPoint presentation here I've
[10:57] modified it you know because you know
[11:00] when we receive inspiration we started
[11:03] looking in in every area to try to find
[11:06] what what it is that God wants us to
[11:08] bring forth and us as sons and daughters
[11:11] of God above this message I want you to
[11:13] realize you probably already realized
[11:16] but when you come across something when
[11:18] you read anything to do with the Word of
[11:20] God or you come you know I'm looking for
[11:22] certain you know
[11:24] history or or arguably some research
[11:27] everything filters through the word for
[11:30] this day everything you know all of a
[11:35] sudden you start to see things in you
[11:37] know they're not seeing these things but
[11:41] it's because you've been given the
[11:42] Spirit of God at the revelation around
[11:44] with this data for this hour and that's
[11:47] what gives you the ability to know the
[11:49] difference right and so when we look at
[11:55] this here this was a beautiful
[11:57] illustration of the Old Testament you
[12:00] know it starts showing about the three
[12:02] flood and you know four thousand years
[12:04] the darker beaten you know we can see
[12:07] the history in the time this is about
[12:08] four thousand years before and then we
[12:10] see the post flood you know in the days
[12:12] of Noah and then we see the calling of
[12:15] Abraham the patriarch him who died given
[12:19] the faith
[12:37] [Music]
[12:47] [Music]
[12:49] and he starts to speak about your life
[12:51] that tells you things we can't stick out
[12:55] too much of this we're just going to
[12:56] look at the history go quick and then
[12:58] the time of the Exodus and the type of
[13:01] baggage and how Israel now everything
[13:03] you're looking at here I want you to
[13:05] recognize that this is all about Israel
[13:08] this is all about God's chosen people
[13:10] they are all a type of the private Jesus
[13:13] president you can see seasons of your
[13:16] old life man in every one of these
[13:19] seasons on the air you should be able to
[13:21] see times in your life where you are
[13:23] under bondage and some of you might
[13:26] still be able bondage and the trust in
[13:28] the words delivery amen because that's
[13:31] what the word has come to do it comes
[13:34] remember us wherever we are to whatever
[13:36] condition we might be in and then we
[13:39] look here and we see that it moves on to
[13:42] the west - experience how many have no
[13:44] business experiences
[13:49] you probably out there once a week
[13:54] because there's times when you're tired
[14:00] there's a replica here that we need to
[14:02] recognize that we're where we were human
[14:05] but also sons and daughters well it's a
[14:08] paradox sometimes if listen what I clap
[14:12] you to say things the right way I don't
[14:16] see things the way that I should be
[14:18] seeing I see
[14:40] [Music]
[15:12] [Music]
[15:24] [Music]
[15:30] [Music]
[15:41] it's a concrete and then the time of
[15:44] judges and then the time of the United
[15:47] Kingdom's and then the time of there's
[15:49] divisions you know this is all talking
[15:51] about tear changes this is all talking
[15:53] about churches the stages all the kings
[15:56] of the you know that they begin to
[15:58] already unite the number of a sudden
[16:00] they separate you got churches had come
[16:02] together
[16:02] you got churches that build up you got
[16:04] churches that split you got all kinds of
[16:06] situations but these are all parts of
[16:09] growing into the perfect that's so that
[16:13] God is prepared
[16:18] stand-alones
[16:19] you thought you might be like - now you
[16:22] gotta be alone and then sometimes you
[16:24] get your hands are tired there's not
[16:27] much you can do the circumstances every
[16:29] time what you can do but don't worry
[16:31] father's coming out to see me because
[16:33] there's also attack restoration
[16:36] worried about so now that we've entered
[16:39] into the time of the prophets we know
[16:41] that God doesn't do nothing unless he
[16:43] reveals that the servants the prophets
[16:44] and so we realize that the time that
[16:48] we're living then we see that whenever
[16:50] God did anything he did it by the word
[16:52] of a cop he oh through the word of the
[16:56] Prophet I thank God that we've received
[16:59] the Prophet for our business right there
[17:01] twelve O'Clock how close our sakes what
[17:05] are we where we're we're right one
[17:08] minute to midnight happy we're 30
[17:10] seconds to dinner
[17:12] I'm not sure I know that we're right
[17:15] there copy men because it takes a
[17:19] message
[17:20] it takes a message is every time that
[17:22] message comes what does it say revenge
[17:28] you know that's the same message mmm
[17:31] God does never change it's always the
[17:35] same message no matter where your
[17:38] condition no matter where you are today
[17:40] whatever your situation however then fee
[17:44] that you might feel or however contempt
[17:47] you might be feeling or whatever it is
[17:49] that you've got that situation in your
[17:51] life God just says we've had these just
[17:53] turn away from it everything can change
[17:56] right from this woman at 12 o'clock
[17:58] today you can leave this place from this
[18:01] moment to be differently to be strong
[18:03] you can be encouraged yeah you can be
[18:05] you can be courageous yes there's
[18:12] nothing between you and God
[18:17] listen you know if you're hearing my
[19:09] voice today the voice of God he's not
[19:12] telling you he's restoring you or
[19:15] positionally placing you into the body
[19:18] of Jesus Christ
[19:19] to fulfill the Word of God for this day
[19:21] in this hour and to fulfill his purpose
[19:24] and his plan because of something good
[19:26] that you did right he says no it's
[19:29] because I've spoken
[19:31] because I've spoken I will perform in
[19:34] your life Damon he's overriding your
[19:37] condition today
[19:38] he's overriding their weaknesses today
[19:40] he's not looking at your condition
[19:42] brother he's not looking at the fact
[19:45] that you might be sick he needs you
[20:01] [Music]
[20:16] and he says here in the fifth
[20:41] [Music]
[20:52] [Music]
[21:00] [Music]
[21:06] he says the fifth day per month which
[21:09] was the fifth year the King Jay Hawkins
[21:11] captivity the word Jehovah he expressly
[21:15] to Ezekiel you know that God but he
[21:18] needs to do something he goes direct if
[21:21] he needs to use you to serve you know he
[21:24] will speak to you they will show me the
[21:27] energy haria
[21:29] the priest the son of Busey
[21:32] the child needs by the river eight more
[21:35] and the hand Jehovah was there a partner
[21:45] in Ezekiel 37 wonder 14 we're looking at
[21:50] three things we're looking at the vision
[21:53] that was conveyed to us personally
[22:15] [Music]
[22:18] because there's you gotta see these
[22:47] three happen to these three parts and
[22:49] you've got to be willing to submit to it
[22:52] because that's you know creepy mysteries
[23:01] here or trying to make this difficult
[23:07] just literally just receive it I can
[23:10] apply
[23:15] [Music]
[23:20] because we see that weed knowledge and
[24:08] that you believe from the Word of God
[24:12] and salvation was upon me and he in the
[24:20] spiritual and set me down in the midst
[24:23] of the valley and it was full bones and
[24:29] he caused me to pass by that roundabout
[24:32] and behold there were very many in the
[24:36] open valleys roll they were very dry you
[24:41] know States we're living in a time of
[24:43] the season where there are so many
[24:46] churches there's there's thousands and
[24:51] thousands of churches but within those
[24:54] churches equal when it's very dry
[25:00] [Music]
[25:28] religious light using the word of God as
[25:32] a cloak as a as a clothing but they're
[25:36] not willing to be fully exposed by the
[25:39] Spirit of God
[25:42] it continues we've got this trick to
[25:46] drive numerous good-for-nothing death
[25:49] Leitrim valiant I post all kinds of
[25:53] there all kinds situations around our
[25:56] lives this is what it looks like people
[26:01] thinking that they're that they're alive
[26:03] that they're gathering together in them
[26:05] and that things are just fine and you
[26:07] know they can throw some money into the
[26:09] basket and they can leave you know they
[26:11] can think you know given our time here
[26:14] there oh I did
[26:39] [Music]
[26:53] [Music]
[27:17] [Music]
[27:34] [Music]
[27:57] [Music]
[28:03] for me
[28:09] he can change their lives he says and
[28:34] [Music]
[28:44] [Music]
[28:58] [Music]
[29:23] into it was the save the Lord it was God
[29:29] speaking it's God telling us that he
[29:33] wants to he wants to bring the light
[29:35] into our lives he once said he wants to
[29:38] raise you up into your positions
[29:41] he wants to particularly place you we
[29:44] heard that there be position unto the
[29:46] doctrine we've been called over being
[29:49] positioned where were Lully were
[29:51] maturing were
[29:53] we're coming into a place where God can
[29:55] use a second they see news upon you and
[29:59] will break up flesh upon you and cover
[30:03] you with skin and put practablity
[30:06] shout and he shall know that i am the
[30:10] lord so much in the scripture states the
[30:21] command was obeyed by the prophet he
[30:25] just recognized that he just don't paid
[30:27] the word of god is it possible he did
[30:31] say well i'm not good enough you start
[30:46] to question dr. you start to wonder if
[30:51] God is really gonna do it
[30:53] God is gonna do it he said I have spoken
[31:01] notice the results so I prophesied so I
[31:07] did what God showed me that I should do
[31:09] a baby
[31:11] alright I accepted his word and what he
[31:14] said about me and they said that I could
[31:16] achieve by his grace and I prophesied as
[31:21] I was commanded and as I prophesied
[31:24] there was a noise and behold the shaky
[31:26] and the bones came together bone to this
[31:30] book you see when you walk with God when
[31:34] you you know you connect
[31:36] the Ministry you allow God to use you in
[31:40] the ministry to do that little simple
[31:42] part that God is giving you that God has
[31:45] placed you you know they listen we were
[31:47] just talking simple things you do want
[31:51] to recognize body simplicity when you're
[31:53] giving you your position when you do
[31:55] what God is asking you to do and you
[31:57] just obey the Lord you're not trying to
[32:07] fit a Bible into adela because you're
[32:12] gonna have something that's distorted
[32:14] you're gonna have some kind of a
[32:16] perverted thing when you try to take and
[32:19] put yourself somewhere try to make
[32:21] yourself something God knows your
[32:25] position God knows your feet God knows
[32:27] your ability yeah listen to brother
[32:31] Brendan says like you seek you said
[32:33] there was a body full of dry bones he
[32:36] said can easily
[32:37] he said that Phyllis so he said prophesy
[32:41] to the dry bones and when the bones come
[32:44] together there was a rattling and the
[32:47] shaky and the love books and sometimes
[32:49] there's the authors there's a lot of
[32:51] rattling and shaking in our lives and
[32:53] there's a lot of noise and situations
[32:56] and circumstances and trials and fiery
[32:59] trials all joy that you get tried that
[33:10] you get put through the fire because God
[33:12] is preparing you guys mostly because
[33:14] shaping you because he wants to do
[33:16] something he wants to push
[33:20] he wants you to live you can't hold your
[33:26] breath
[33:32] you need breath and if you are a son or
[33:35] a daughter of God you don't need just
[33:38] natural you need there's a there's a
[33:44] season at the time where the Word of God
[33:46] has been prophesied the Word of God
[33:48] that's now in the pride that's why this
[33:51] series is about calling the resurrection
[33:53] our part in the Word of God we are
[33:56] important without us there later they're
[34:02] watching but right now they're saying
[34:04] yes brother Danny let them know about
[34:06] this remind them how important they are
[34:09] to be perfected in this problem because
[34:20] we've got one beautiful honeymoon three
[34:24] half years
[34:31] I said let's go to church let's feed on
[34:58] the Word of God let's let's pray warned
[35:01] us our lives or that's let's you know a
[35:06] tree or our children or us let's do
[35:09] those things because you know that what
[35:11] you do those things peace comes and rest
[35:14] comes to know that rest is what vacation
[35:17] is all about people want the occasion
[35:19] because they'd be arrested are the two
[35:22] more vacation without faith you're not
[35:24] gonna get arrested you're not going to
[35:26] get the kind of rest that you need as a
[35:28] survivor of God and so so so we kind of
[35:31] recognize that God is working things out
[35:34] in our lives and allowing us to go
[35:36] through these situations so that he can
[35:38] put blank and my sister brother
[35:40] practices and when the balls come to get
[35:42] us run around and shaking lotta noise
[35:44] but then when the skin come on them the
[35:47] meat come on them there wasn't much
[35:49] noise you see we can get so perfectly
[35:53] dressed we can help along here we can
[35:59] have two nice suits we can have the nice
[36:03] put on the slide and still have no
[36:07] breath
[36:11] [Music]
[36:20] [Music]
[36:41] because he wants to be something that
[37:29] goes beyond this world and you move it
[37:33] into that fight my faith and my maturity
[37:36] in the Word of God and he says so it's
[37:39] not a matter just be dressed right
[37:41] looking right it's about having the life
[37:44] of Christ in you and you willing to do
[37:47] what it takes you're willing to
[37:50] sacrifice and do what it takes so that
[37:53] you can receive His blessing his life
[37:55] and he says he says the meat come on
[37:58] that there wasn't much much he said
[38:00] prophesied
[38:02] spirit now see I think that's what's
[38:04] going on now itself work being
[38:09] prophesied to these bolts and now
[38:12] there's a shaky border there's there's
[38:15] old snow that are starting to raise up
[38:17] because people are starting to recognize
[38:19] that God is God watching God needs you
[38:23] listen was in a terrible condition
[38:27] they were amassing all kinds of
[38:30] circumstances they think that there was
[38:32] no way that they can ever serve God
[38:34] again but it didn't matter because God
[38:36] said I'm sending the word
[38:38] that's what he's done today he sent his
[38:41] word if he could have done anything
[38:43] better he would have done if they send
[38:44] us his word and amen and he says here he
[38:48] says both the Cates cuffed in silence
[38:51] broken bones we'd fit together all these
[38:54] things were taking place when he spoke
[38:57] and all of a sudden these bubbles
[39:00] started to rise up let's just start just
[39:06] do what you can
[39:07] maybe you feel that I've been through it
[39:11] enough maybe I need to just be able get
[39:13] things do it again don't worry you know
[39:16] it's like it's like when you do an
[39:18] exercise for a long time and then you go
[39:20] to stretch it you feel the pain goes you
[39:25] know it's like you know because you
[39:26] haven't done an exercise it haven't been
[39:28] exercising your faith you've been kind
[39:31] of sitting still for a long time and you
[39:34] know you're not moving forward in your
[39:36] walk you're feeling like a little bit
[39:38] you know skeptic in a lot of areas of
[39:40] your walk over and when I we help all
[39:43] the seniors in the flash came upon them
[39:46] and the skin covered them above but
[39:48] there was no breath in them you see
[39:55] because they do that sometimes you need
[40:01] to see there's something in the book so
[40:19] you because the pun your plan and when I
[40:51] build all the simians there was both
[40:54] president st. his tendons muscular power
[40:57] you see energy starts to come to the
[40:59] body when God starts to add little by
[41:01] little he starts to give you strength to
[41:04] overcome stress they give you faith to
[41:06] keep pressing on cold with nobody looked
[41:11] at that he looks here he says Ezekiel 37
[41:14] mattresses that said he had to be beside
[41:17] unto wind because the Spirit of God is
[41:22] moving in the land he's moving all over
[41:25] the place and this is the hour where we
[41:30] are catching his winding his
[41:32] and this is where the pride starts to
[41:34] receive in such a way that she knows how
[41:37] to apply the Word of God she starts to
[41:39] realize that she's got a part that she's
[41:41] got something to say that the son of man
[41:44] had saved the women that saith the Lord
[41:47] God come from the four winds o breath
[41:49] and breathe upon these slain that they
[41:52] did that so I prophesied as he commanded
[41:54] me and the breath came into them and
[41:57] they lived and stood upon their feet of
[42:00] exceedingly great God is raising her me
[42:08] demon God is wanting you to be in that
[42:13] earth goddess giving us a kind of think
[42:17] that we need to overcome it to beat the
[42:19] enemy because when the breath comes in
[42:23] when the word of life comes in it
[42:26] strengthens you it gives you strength
[42:28] the community thank you
[42:30] if you have those experiences where your
[42:36] situations we just about changing around
[42:38] you and then all of a sudden didn't do a
[42:41] heck of a lot you were praying you will
[42:46] yield of yourself you would keep in your
[42:47] world because sometimes we speak things
[42:51] and make things worse by the things that
[42:55] we say you see that's wisdom with little
[42:58] birds that's word sometimes can go a
[43:00] long way and things start to change
[43:03] around your life you see these are
[43:06] seasons in our walk but we come to
[43:08] realize and that God is preparing us to
[43:12] be here be people humans it will bind
[43:16] this up like Ezekiel 37 these dry bones
[43:20] program says the valley full of dry
[43:23] bones Ezekiel saw their return
[43:26] I said after two days after two days he
[43:31] would return to them he will receive us
[43:34] and give us and revive us I'll continue
[43:38] to read because something says Detroit
[43:51] holds the valley of dry bones
[43:53] Ezekiel cite their return again that
[43:57] notice Jose has said after two days
[43:59] after two days he would return to them
[44:02] he will reply to us and give us revive
[44:06] us never revive doesn't mean
[44:08] resurrection revived there is the same
[44:12] word used everywhere else I just looked
[44:15] it up means a revival some of us need
[44:18] some personal revival some of us need to
[44:20] be you know encouraged by the Word of
[44:23] God and revived out of our conditions in
[44:26] our situations he says he will revive us
[44:29] after two days that would be in the
[44:31] third day he will revive us again after
[44:34] he scattered us and blinded us and
[44:37] taught us you know the Jews were blinded
[44:40] for the very purpose that we could have
[44:42] sight they were torn apart scattered as
[44:46] a nation rejected their Messiah that we
[44:50] wait to see the decide and there might
[44:52] be a people talk about of the Gentiles
[44:56] for his namesake
[44:58] amen glory to God
[45:01] so what started that people started
[45:05] coming into their positions that's what
[45:07] we're looking forward to here we're
[45:10] looking to see everybody come into their
[45:12] place coming into their positions both
[45:15] of them coming to this mode ever find
[45:18] encouraging building up giving you time
[45:21] giving your backwards giving them your
[45:24] finances and your tight giving your
[45:26] offerings of the house Lord
[45:28] these are the simple things that God is
[45:30] looking for us to do in order to build
[45:34] up and to strengthen this particular
[45:36] house that he's given us
[45:38] hey my third we have seen the vision the
[45:44] valium tribe owns the me and they said
[45:52] them to be son of man these bones are
[45:54] the whole house of Israel look at that
[45:58] this is the bride we are the people we
[46:05] need to recognize that we are peculiar
[46:07] people that we are we are the ones that
[46:09] God is using in this pain in this hour
[46:15] is there any question people hope they
[46:18] say our bones are dried and their hope
[46:21] is lost
[46:21] we have cut off from our parts a lot of
[46:25] people get discouraged times of
[46:27] discouragement not realizing that that
[46:30] it's because you've been walking in
[46:32] other directions you're not blocking
[46:34] with talk how can we understand this
[46:39] vision unless we understand where the
[46:41] children of Israel are a type of the
[46:43] pride how can you know what God wants
[46:46] you to do unless you know where you are
[46:48] the condition you know this is simple
[46:51] stuff but we need to be reminded of our
[46:54] conditions and not stay in those
[46:56] conditions be willing to move out and go
[47:00] deeper with God and to press hidden and
[47:03] then to go beyond our regular routines
[47:06] because you know
[47:07] such a way that he's a creature happen
[47:10] to need to break some habits you need to
[47:13] break so those dirty half to make the
[47:15] brakes of those habits of giving you
[47:17] away from God you know constantly got to
[47:20] come to the house the Lord get away from
[47:22] those habits and pull you away from
[47:24] prayer
[47:26] [Music]
