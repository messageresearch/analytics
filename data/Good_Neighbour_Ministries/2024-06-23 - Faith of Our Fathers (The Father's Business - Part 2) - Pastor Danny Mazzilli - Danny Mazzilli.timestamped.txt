[27:55] Multicultural and in every culture
[27:57] you've got many different ways of
[27:59] worship different ways of prayer you
[28:01] hear Brother Desmond the way he prays

[28:09] leader who's singing differently and you
[28:11] know you got one song leader this way
[28:13] another one that way one screaming one
[28:16] praising God one you just you know like
[28:18] but God hides in it
[28:20] all that's what makes you know that's
[28:22] what makes this word so real to the Sons
[28:26] and Daughters of God because they're not
[28:27] looking looking at that they're
[28:29] listening for the word they're paying
[28:32] attention to what is the present stage
[28:36] of the ministry of Jesus Christ in this
[28:39] hour and what is the Lord doing right
[28:42] now where is he right now what's he
[28:45] concerned about in my life how's he
[28:47] dealing with me personally you know
[28:50] that's the thing this is Ephesians 4
[28:53] Ministry Ephesians 4 Ministry is all
[28:56] about the perfecting of the Saints and
[29:00] you're going to see saints that when the
[29:02] word comes to perfect some are going to
[29:05] say I'm going to defect because they
[29:08] can't handle the perfect right and this
[29:11] is the thing that we got to realize that
[29:13] listen don't be looking for big numbers
[29:16] don't be looking for uh you know that
[29:18] all listen when Jesus was here on the
[29:20] earth he was just a small little flock
[29:22] when he came into when he came on the
[29:24] scene and he came into his public
[29:25] Ministry it got it got to isn't that the
[29:29] son of Joseph the
[29:31] Carpenter and what's he doing making
[29:34] himself something saying things that
[29:36] that are different and how many were
[29:38] actually following him there was more
[29:41] that we rejecting him that than we're
[29:43] following him and he was the
[29:46] word amen praise God so uh we we
[29:50] certainly want to remember brother Tim

[31:25] if they're going to be here today they
[31:27] didn't uh they mention mention they may
[31:28] be here today but um they're uh from The
[31:32] Cameroon all right and uh they plan on
[31:35] uh you know coming into the service they
[31:37] were very excited to know that we have a
[31:40] church here locally um and so we give
[31:43] God the glory for that and uh we
[31:45] certainly welcome them and the other
[31:47] sister that was with us here last week
[31:50] um she lives close by and the Lord uh
[31:53] certainly did something wonderful for
[31:54] her in finding this particular Ministry
[31:57] history and so we thank God for that and
[32:00] when they do come we'll give them an
[32:02] opportunity to share some of their
[32:03] testimony on how they found us by the
[32:06] grace of God Amen praise God remember
[32:09] it's the Lord that adds to the
[32:13] church and when the Lord adds to the
[32:16] church they're genuine they'll come in
[32:20] they'll get fed by the word of God they
[32:22] will connect with the word not so much
[32:26] they'll connect with the people of
[32:27] course
[32:28] and they'll and they'll they'll realize
[32:29] that they're getting fed through the
[32:31] ministry but it's connecting with him in
[32:35] in his provided place of worship amen
[32:37] for their particular lives at this
[32:40] particular time and so praise God for
[32:44] that um so let's go to the word this
[32:46] morning I'm I'm excited about the word
[32:49] this morning I'm always excited about
[32:51] the word amen especially when
[32:54] inspiration starts to fall and starts to
[32:56] come and and then I I get excited
[32:58] because I know that this is something
[33:00] that the Lord wants the people to have
[33:02] and so uh you know we're just conduits
[33:05] as ministers and we're just going to put
[33:07] ourselves aside today we're going to let
[33:09] him have his
[33:11] way let's all
[33:14] stand and
[33:15] let's read the word of God praise God
[33:22] Amen from the
[33:25] beginning and so we're going to continue
[33:27] continue um along the same path that we
[33:30] started last week we were talking about
[33:33] faith of the fathers you know I know it
[33:35] was a Father's day last week but last
[33:38] week's message it's a Father's Day
[33:40] message every week because we're talking
[33:44] about the great father who if we follow
[33:47] him and we're about his business we
[33:50] become good Fathers also we become good
[33:53] stewards of the word of God and then we
[33:55] can say like Jesus we're about the
[33:57] father's business amen and so that's
[34:00] what we want to continue on this week um
[34:04] we're going to go to part two of uh the
[34:06] father's business and so let's read the
[34:09] scripture our first scripture again is
[34:12] from St Luke chapter 2 verse 49 and he
[34:14] said unto them how is it that ye sought
[34:17] me was not ye not that I must be about
[34:22] my father's business let us pray father
[34:27] what a privilege and what an honor it is
[34:29] Lord to be a part of your economy and
[34:33] not only that but a part of your your
[34:35] business Lord you have a a business here
[34:39] on Earth that that Lord that you started
[34:41] from before the foundations of the world
[34:44] and here we are today Lord and we're
[34:47] we're a part of that business and by us
[34:50] seeing that we're a part of that
[34:52] business it gives us perfect Faith to
[34:55] recognize Who We Are and who you are and
[34:59] that is real true Christianity in this
[35:04] hour knowing you and knowing who we are
[35:09] Lord may your spirit take control now
[35:12] speak to each and every one of our
[35:13] hearts Lord you know what we have need
[35:16] of those that are online that are
[35:17] listening in we certainly welcome them
[35:20] and we ask that your spirit will go and
[35:22] and ride the word of God as it's going
[35:25] forth into their hearts into their into
[35:28] their needs into their lives into their
[35:30] homes and meet those needs and may they
[35:32] know you in the power of your
[35:35] Resurrection we pray in Jesus name and
[35:38] remember brother Tim this morning Lord
[35:40] as he's ministering your word move him
[35:42] aside and let them be a blessing to your
[35:45] people in Jesus name amen praise
[35:49] God and so you know um it's a wonderful
[35:53] thing to know that we are a part of
[35:55] God's business and just like Jesus
[35:58] Christ when he was here on Earth even at
[36:00] 12 years old he realized that he was not
[36:03] just an ordinary person he wasn't just
[36:05] an ordinary child he was somebody that
[36:08] was uh that God had intervened in his
[36:11] life and that he was actually the word
[36:14] for his day and that he had to come into
[36:16] the into the uh season of where he would
[36:19] have to be about the father's business
[36:22] and until you come into a realization
[36:24] that you're not just a human being here
[36:26] on Earth that belongs as a member to
[36:28] some church organization or don't even
[36:30] belong to a church and you're here on
[36:33] Earth and you've got no purpose you've
[36:34] got no vision you've got no Clarity of
[36:37] why you're here you're dealing with all
[36:39] kinds of circumstances in your life and
[36:41] you know you got heartaches you got
[36:43] breakups you got family problems you got
[36:46] Financial issues you got all kinds of
[36:48] things and you know so many people I was
[36:50] telling my wife this morning so many
[36:52] people are looking to others for for
[36:56] explanation and they want to go to
[36:58] psychiatrist they want to go to to
[37:00] self-help and they want to they want to
[37:02] go every other place but they don't want
[37:04] to go to the Creator himself who's the
[37:08] one that Jesus said you're you're heavy
[37:11] ladened you're you're burdened you got
[37:14] so many situations in your life come
[37:17] unto me I will give you rest and you
[37:22] know it puzzles me why somebody wouldn't
[37:25] allow that to be their first choice to
[37:27] give give God the opportunity the Lord
[37:29] Jesus an opportunity to really liberate
[37:32] you and set you free from the burdens
[37:35] and the and the cares of this life amen
[37:38] and so when we come into that place it
[37:41] certainly changes our attitude it
[37:43] changes our Outlook and it puts us into
[37:46] business with Jesus Christ himself and
[37:50] then we start to say hey I must be about
[37:52] my father's business everything I do is
[37:56] my father's business
[37:58] everything that I that I work at uh uh
[38:01] my my work my my marriage my my
[38:04] relationships uh all everything that I
[38:07] do if I place it first as Jesus Christ
[38:11] first in my life and make his business
[38:14] first then everything else is going to
[38:17] follow naturally and I'm going to fall
[38:19] right into his plan his desire his will
[38:22] and his purpose for my life amen praise
[38:26] God and so
[38:28] um let's go to the next scripture I
[38:29] believe the you know um we we can draw
[38:32] here from this scripture here in the
[38:34] book of Acts uh chapter 1: 6 to8 let's
[38:37] read it and being assembled together
[38:39] with them commanded them that they
[38:42] should not depart from Jerusalem now
[38:45] this is where Jesus appears to the
[38:47] disciples and the apostles all right
[38:50] after he had
[38:51] risen but wait for the promise of the
[38:54] father he says which sayith he ye have
[38:56] heard of me for truly John for John
[39:00] truly baptized with water but ye shall
[39:03] be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many
[39:06] days hence this still pertains to this
[39:09] day and this hour because a lot of
[39:11] people need to receive the Holy Ghost
[39:14] okay when they therefore were caught
[39:17] together were come together they asked
[39:20] of him saying Lord wil thou at this time
[39:23] restore again the
[39:25] kingdom to Israel and he said unto them
[39:29] it is not for you to know the times or
[39:31] the seasons which the father hath put in
[39:35] his own power so we know that he's got a
[39:38] plan he's got a plan and we need to come
[39:42] into that plan the father's plan he says
[39:47] here he says but ye shall receive
[39:50] power
[39:52] after note here after
[39:57] that the Holy Ghost is come upon you a
[40:01] lot of people say oh I got the Holy
[40:03] Ghost I went to church I spoke in
[40:06] tongues I got anointed I started to
[40:09] shout and scream I got baptized as a
[40:12] baby I was baptized in the name of
[40:14] Father Son and Holy Ghost I was blessed
[40:17] by the Trinity oh the Virgin Mary she
[40:20] she appeared to me in a
[40:22] dream they ain't got the Holy Ghost yet
[40:25] they just don't know it but after the
[40:28] Holy Ghost has come upon you and
[40:32] then ye shall be Witnesses un me both in
[40:37] Jerusalem and in all Judea and in
[40:40] Samaria and unto the
[40:43] utter most parts of this earth the earth
[40:48] and this is where we are right
[40:51] now and when he had spoken these things
[40:54] while they beheld he was taken up and a
[40:57] cloud received him out of their sight
[41:01] praise God man that just reminds me of
[41:04] the cloud that brought him here in
[41:07] 1963 in the same way that you shall see
[41:10] him go you shall see him come and I
[41:13] believe that that he has come now with
[41:16] this message that burns within the heart
[41:19] of the True Church of Jesus Christ in
[41:22] this day and in this hour the true
[41:24] Christian Church people ask me all the
[41:25] time Danny what do you believe I said
[41:28] read the book of Acts if you read the
[41:31] book of Acts you will see that it is not
[41:33] the Acts of the Apostles but it is
[41:36] actually the acts of the Holy Ghost in
[41:39] the
[41:40] apostles fulfilling the word of God and
[41:44] declaring and
[41:46] interpreting his word for this day and
[41:49] we are a continuation of that church
[41:52] everything you saw them do in the book
[41:54] of Acts we do it today we have the
[41:57] Lord's Supper we baptize in the name of
[41:59] Jesus Christ just like they did back on
[42:02] the day of Pentecost when 3,000 were
[42:04] added to the church we do it the same
[42:06] way we're the same church we're anointed
[42:10] by the same holy spirit that was given
[42:13] back on the day of Pentecost and it's
[42:15] available here today amen praise God and
[42:18] so that same spirit is about the
[42:21] father's business because you know what
[42:24] the father's business has always been
[42:26] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[42:30] and
[42:32] forever back in the mind of God remember
[42:34] he wanted to express himself as a father
[42:39] and he had a plan and that same plan has
[42:42] been unveiling itself unfolding itself
[42:45] we're going to be looking at it a little
[42:46] more here as we get into this message
[42:49] and so it's all about the word business
[42:53] somebody say to you what business are
[42:55] you in I'm in the word business business
[42:58] I'm in the I'm in I'm in the business of
[43:00] declaring the word of God for this day
[43:03] Christianity you want to see real
[43:05] Christians then you got to look at the
[43:07] word of God and if the word of God is
[43:10] Not mirroring that that that Christian
[43:12] experience you need to go back and check
[43:15] because the word will always declare
[43:18] because remember the holy ghost that he
[43:20] says I'll send you the comforter which
[43:23] is the Holy Ghost Jesus said himself and
[43:26] he will guide you into all truth which
[43:29] is the word of God and so when you're
[43:31] looking at the word and you see baptism
[43:34] in the name of Jesus Christ you're
[43:35] saying amen because the same holy ghost
[43:38] that was in me led me right to the water
[43:40] I believed and was baptized like Jesus
[43:43] said he that believeth and is baptized
[43:46] shall be saved okay not he that that the
[43:50] the the the parents decided to sprinkle
[43:52] water on him or or the priest decided to
[43:54] baptize him into titles of father son
[43:56] Holy Ghost you might as well baptize
[43:58] into titles of the of the the the the
[44:00] lily of the valley or the like what's
[44:02] the difference why are you baptizing in
[44:04] the titles of Father Son and Holy
[44:07] Ghost do you see what I mean so it's all
[44:10] back to the word it's the that's what
[44:12] you're going to hear here amen praise
[44:14] God and so we read the scripture on
[44:16] Malachi 4 verse 5-6 behold I will send
[44:20] you Elijah the prophet before the coming
[44:22] and the great and before the coming of
[44:24] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[44:27] and he shall turn the heart of the
[44:29] fathers to the children and the Heart of
[44:31] the children to their fathers lest I
[44:34] come and smite the Earth with a curse
[44:36] you see it's all about the father's
[44:38] business that's what we're the heart of
[44:41] the fathers back to the children and
[44:43] then now here we are we're the children
[44:46] of the many fathers that have been our
[44:48] fathers the the prophets of old father
[44:51] Abraham the same Faith coming down
[44:54] through each dispensation through each
[44:56] Church age it was the same spirit of God
[45:00] it was the it was the father's Spirit
[45:03] which is Christ which is Elohim which is
[45:06] the one and only true God the
[45:07] self-existent one it's always been him
[45:10] declaring himself so here let me read a
[45:14] quote um here it kind of you know gives
[45:19] us a a platform to to move from here and
[45:23] and here brother Braham speak in 1963 in
[45:26] Christ the my of God revealed he says he
[45:29] has shown or revealed it in every type
[45:32] that's in the Bible yes if you want to
[45:35] see Jesus Christ you can start right
[45:37] from the book of re Revelations from the
[45:40] first very first word that was in the
[45:43] beginning
[45:45] God hallelujah it was Jesus Christ the
[45:50] same yesterday today and forever it's
[45:52] all about him so watch he says here
[45:54] therefore the entire Bible is the
[45:57] revelation of God's mystery in
[46:02] Christ the entire Bible is an expression
[46:06] of one goal that God had one purpose he
[46:10] wanted to achieve in the entire Bible
[46:14] listen carefully here people all the all
[46:17] the acts of the of the Believers in the
[46:21] Bible has been in type and expressing
[46:25] what God's Great goal is and now in this
[46:30] last day he has revealed it and shows
[46:34] it and with God's help well you'll see
[46:37] it right here this this morning what the
[46:41] Lord has had in his mind all along and
[46:45] has expressed it therefore you can see
[46:48] the great meaning of what's being to
[46:51] know this and then to try to bring it to
[46:54] the people see and then you don't I
[46:57] haven't went into details to try to
[47:00] explain it as God has revealed it to me
[47:04] it you know first of all what we're
[47:07] talking about here is God has to reveal
[47:11] it to
[47:12] you that his plan is to dwell in
[47:17] you the whole thing is about Jesus
[47:21] Christ in different stages of his own
[47:25] personal Ministry God wanting to express
[47:29] himself but in a many membered form so
[47:32] that he could have
[47:33] Fellowship because he was the
[47:35] self-existent one but then his thoughts
[47:38] were were so uh him that he could he
[47:43] could express himself into many
[47:45] different forms and yet still be God and
[47:50] allow them to communicate one with the
[47:52] other I know it sounds you know like
[47:54] it's it's it's almost a paradox but this
[47:56] this is a revelation this is something
[47:59] that that that brother brandham says you
[48:01] know I I've received it in such a way
[48:04] that that it's hard to explain it it's
[48:06] not something that you can explain you
[48:09] must experience it and that's why a lot
[48:12] of people you know they'll take that
[48:15] quote and they'll just place it just on
[48:17] brother brandham and that it's just him
[48:19] experiencing that and it's just him the
[48:21] one that's got it him the one that's
[48:23] that that can only declare it and that's
[48:25] why today you hear them say press press
[48:28] play and Obey don't go anywhere else
[48:30] they want to leave Jesus Christ out of
[48:32] this they don't realize that that's what
[48:34] they're doing when they do that yes he
[48:36] was God's Prophet yes he was God's
[48:38] messenger and yes he fulfilled Malachi
[48:41] 4:5 Revelations 107 but the voice was
[48:44] always the voice of God that's why he he
[48:48] made sure it was named the voice of God
[48:50] to leave it as a testimony in case they
[48:52] started to get mixed up in the last days
[48:54] because remember it would become so
[48:57] deceiving that it would deceive even the
[49:00] very
[49:01] elect if that's the key word it's not
[49:06] possible you'll never deceive the elect
[49:09] because the elect have Jesus Christ in
[49:12] them and they'll never go against their
[49:15] own word that's why you'll never hear me
[49:18] uh say false prophet what he said wasn't
[49:23] the truth that what he said was not thus
[49:25] you'll never hear me say that because I
[49:28] know by Revelation what he said thus
[49:30] sayeth the Lord was the voice of God was
[49:34] the truth and we are the manifestation
[49:37] of that word in this day and in this
[49:39] hour fulfilling the the the the
[49:42] Ephesians Ministry of Ephesians chapter
[49:45] 4 where God now has put and placed
[49:48] himself into a five-fold Ministry Christ
[49:52] in the present stage of his ministry
[49:55] having fellowship with his children
[49:57] every Sunday every service every prayer
[50:02] meeting every time you listen to the
[50:04] tapes Oh you mean God can speak to me
[50:07] while I of course he
[50:08] can but he speaks to you from here
[50:12] too and you are not to just place it in
[50:15] one place the minute you do that you
[50:18] have isolated yourself you've placed
[50:21] yourself as a as a a lamb and the wolves
[50:24] are looking for lamb to eat
[50:27] they love it when Lambs go off on their
[50:29] own and they start declaring their own
[50:31] interpretation on the word of God don't
[50:33] do it you need to find your pastor who
[50:36] is your Shepherd you need to come under
[50:39] your pastor under that Shepherd under
[50:41] his
[50:43] leadership amen a lot of people still
[50:45] having trouble with that there's people
[50:47] they still have trouble calling me
[50:49] Pastor I don't care that's their problem
[50:52] that's not my problem they're going to
[50:55] have to come to a place where they'll
[50:56] realize that it's not Pastor
[50:59] [Laughter]
[51:00] Dany but it's Christ in the present
[51:03] stage of his ministry wanting to feed
[51:06] his sheep and my sheep hear my voice no
[51:09] other voice will they follow they don't
[51:12] realize they just got a bit of a
[51:13] rebellious Spirit still holding back on
[51:16] their lives and still they they still
[51:18] don't want to let go they don't want to
[51:19] let go of Pastor Simon they they they
[51:21] they think that oh Pastor Simon he was
[51:23] the one he was the one he never was the
[51:25] one Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[51:28] today and forever is the one he's the
[51:32] one he's the one that I followed he's
[51:34] the voice that I heard that give me the
[51:36] birth that delivered me from from the
[51:39] sickness and the the addiction and
[51:41] everything that was in my life it's not
[51:43] man it's God it's always been God and if
[51:46] I stop listening for that
[51:49] voice and want to hear that voice that
[51:52] speaks to my heart that delivers me in
[51:55] the in the time of my need
[51:57] I don't want to be having to rush to a
[51:59] tape and and and and try to listen in on
[52:01] a prayer line to see if I can can I can
[52:04] hear something that that relates to my
[52:06] situation and and then oh there it is
[52:09] they're taking tapes where brother
[52:11] Brandon married somebody and they'll and
[52:13] they'll do a ceremony with brother
[52:14] brandom purposely saying oh I got
[52:17] married by the
[52:18] prophet
[52:21] nonsense but can God speak to you
[52:23] through those tapes it's happened to me
[52:26] where he spoke lip to ear through the
[52:29] prophet's voice in a prayer line and
[52:31] showed me and revealed to me things that
[52:34] there was no way the timing and the and
[52:36] the the that moment and that was God and
[52:39] I was delivered because it was
[52:43] God but did I make it the absolute now
[52:47] where the only way that I hear I hear
[52:49] testimonies you know sometimes and then
[52:51] at the end of the testimony all they
[52:53] declare is that it's because they listen
[52:55] to that tape
[52:58] nonsense you need to listen for the
[53:01] voice of God and he can speak to you
[53:02] through a mule yeah if he wants to speak
[53:05] to you through a
[53:07] mule what an hour Saints we're talking
[53:11] about the father's business this morning
[53:13] and I love it praise God let's go to the
[53:16] next
[53:21] slide St sorry
[53:27] Hebrews
[53:29] 4:14 seeing then that we have a great
[53:33] high priest that that is passed into the
[53:36] heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold
[53:40] fast our profession now I want you to
[53:43] notice here in the scripture that we
[53:45] read in in Acts okay I highlighted
[53:49] something here and I want to mention it
[53:51] ye shall be Witnesses we Are Witnesses
[53:55] of the father's business bu we're
[53:58] talking on that and when you look at the
[54:00] word witness okay when you translate
[54:03] that word from the Greek
[54:05] translation it's Martis m a r t s in
[54:10] Greek and when you look at the actual
[54:13] meaning okay they've got a few different
[54:16] breakdowns I got it right from the
[54:17] internet this morning Nas word you know
[54:20] uh definition and it says a witness in a
[54:24] legal sense an historical sense and one
[54:27] who is a spectator of anything of a
[54:31] contest in an ethical sense now listen
[54:34] this is what caught my attention those
[54:36] who after his example after your own
[54:40] example of the way you live and what you
[54:42] profess have proved the strength and
[54:46] genuiness of their faith of your faith
[54:49] in Jesus Christ by undergoing a violent
[54:53] death in other words they have come so
[54:56] much into the Revelation and
[54:58] understanding of God's word and and and
[55:03] in the power of his resurrection that
[55:05] there are so much that nobody can tell
[55:07] me I am not a witness of the
[55:10] supernatural God I could give you
[55:13] testimony after testimony of the
[55:16] supernatural I witnessed it and I was a
[55:19] part of it and nobody can ever take that
[55:22] out of me and if they took me to a place
[55:25] where they said that you've got to deny
[55:28] that that happened to you or we're going
[55:29] to remove your head I'd
[55:32] say start from this
[55:35] side it wouldn't even glitch because a
[55:40] true son or daughter of God does not
[55:43] fear death that's why if you go back and
[55:46] study the Dark Ages and the Christians
[55:48] of the Dark Ages they were burned alive
[55:51] they were cut into pieces they were
[55:53] listen there was atrocities that were
[55:54] done to them that I don't even want to
[55:56] mention but they had the anointing on
[55:59] their lives to withstand that and were
[56:01] able to go through it and today this
[56:05] word still lives because you can never
[56:07] kill Christ you might take the vessel
[56:10] but the spirit moves on hallelujah
[56:13] praise God and that's why a True
[56:15] Believer has no fear and this this
[56:18] really caught my attention that was the
[56:20] the definition that they came up with in
[56:22] in the you know when they when they when
[56:24] they looked at the definition of the
[56:26] translation from the Greek they brought
[56:28] it back to the word of God and so here
[56:31] now we need to realize that our
[56:32] profession and what we speak and what we
[56:35] give as witness when it's really a
[56:38] genuine birth where something has truly
[56:42] taken place you become a witness that
[56:45] when you profess you've got the high
[56:47] priest right there who's standing right
[56:50] behind his word and backing his word
[56:53] amen because Jesus the son of God let us
[56:55] hold fast fast because of him being our
[56:58] high priest he's the one that's standing
[57:00] there with us and so watch brother
[57:03] Braham speaking here he says now
[57:06] remember every Redemptive blessing has
[57:09] already been purchased the price is paid
[57:13] there is only one way that you'll ever
[57:16] be able to receive it is to believe it
[57:19] and to accept it he's the high priest of
[57:22] our
[57:23] confession the Hebrews there that
[57:26] Hebrews letter says he's the high priest
[57:29] of our profession to profess and to
[57:32] confess is the same thing of course so
[57:35] we he's the high priest of our
[57:37] confession therefore he cannot do
[57:40] anything for us now this is important
[57:43] until first we
[57:47] confess that he has done it it's a
[57:51] finished work everything you're healing
[57:55] it's a finished work it's just a matter
[57:57] of what in his time he's going to do
[58:00] it you know your your your circumstances
[58:03] that he said I'll provide all your needs
[58:06] you might be in a situation you might
[58:08] find yourself in a in a very rough
[58:11] condition right now financially but
[58:13] listen if you stand on the word and you
[58:15] profess and confess he's Jehovah Gyra
[58:19] he's Jehovah Gyra he's going to provide
[58:23] I'm going to do my part by going into
[58:25] the house of the Lord I'm going to going
[58:26] to do my part if I receive a dollar I'm
[58:28] bringing 10 cents and I'm going to drop
[58:30] it in the bucket it's as simple as that
[58:33] because he's still Jehovah Gyra it has
[58:36] nothing to do with with with what what I
[58:39] have to do no no no no listen here he
[58:41] says and then when we confess it he's
[58:44] the high priest a mediator to go to work
[58:47] on that and make it right so we pray
[58:50] trusting in God today tonight in his
[58:53] kindness and mercy that he will give to
[58:57] us his abundance of
[58:59] Grace amen and now remember you must
[59:04] accept it and that's why a lot of people
[59:07] you know you go to them with the word
[59:09] you tell them about proper baptism you
[59:11] tell them about how to receive the Holy
[59:13] Spirit how to how to how to receive the
[59:15] gift of of of life and they reject it by
[59:20] saying no I had I got baptized when I
[59:23] was a baby I go to this church I believe
[59:25] this one I watch this guy on television
[59:28] and I send my money there I don't want
[59:30] it no you just want my
[59:35] money we don't need anybody's
[59:38] money we need God's
[59:40] honey Sweetness in our lives glory to
[59:44] God and when that comes everything else
[59:46] follows amen praise God so we've got a
[59:49] pro listen Proverbs 18: 211 death and
[59:52] life are in the power of the tongue
[59:56] you you know people you you run into
[59:58] people how's it going terrible oh well I
[1:00:01] guess your day is not going to go so
[1:00:03] well not bad people say to me oh I go
[1:00:06] how you doing I go not bad I I said so
[1:00:09] bad but not too
[1:00:11] bad how about
[1:00:14] saying things are good things are
[1:00:17] getting better things are improving in
[1:00:20] my life because you have the power of
[1:00:23] the spoken word in you and you got to be
[1:00:25] careful the enem wants to use you in the
[1:00:27] negative way he wants to turn your your
[1:00:29] your your your your positives into a
[1:00:31] negative everybody's always looking at
[1:00:34] at the weather and then you know and the
[1:00:35] minute that there's any rain coming oh
[1:00:37] it's going to rain but the last 17 days
[1:00:39] there was Sunshine heat I mean like you
[1:00:42] know you could have done so many
[1:00:44] different things but the minute there's
[1:00:46] one oh the rain I I love the rain when
[1:00:48] it comes because it Waters everything
[1:00:51] makes everything look beautiful and Lush
[1:00:53] and green I look out in my backyard my
[1:00:56] grass is looking so good and trees are
[1:00:58] looking nice and Lush getting the rain
[1:01:00] you know when it needs it God is just
[1:01:02] providing praise God I love it you see
[1:01:06] it's all about your attitude and your
[1:01:09] attitude needs to profess the right
[1:01:11] things because he says here in Proverbs
[1:01:14] and they shall love it and shall eat the
[1:01:17] fruit
[1:01:20] thereof wow I love that I read it again
[1:01:25] death and life are in the power of the
[1:01:28] tongue and they that love it shall eat
[1:01:32] the fruit thereof and that can
[1:01:34] work for the black dog or the white dog
[1:01:39] CU sometimes you can eat some sour
[1:01:43] fruit glory to God Romans chapter 5 go
[1:01:46] to the next
[1:01:47] slide it says here in Romans chapter 5
[1:01:50] or Romans chapter 10 sorry slide number
[1:01:53] five verses 8 to to 12 but what what
[1:01:56] saith it the word is NY even in thy
[1:02:02] mouth and in thy heart that is the word
[1:02:07] of faith the word of Revelation if God
[1:02:10] has revealed to you by by his stripes
[1:02:13] you're healed if he's revealed that to
[1:02:16] you then it's then it's the faith that's
[1:02:18] in your heart and that's what's going to
[1:02:20] come out and that's what's going to be
[1:02:21] confessed and that is the word of faith
[1:02:24] which we preach
[1:02:26] that if Thou shalt confess there it is
[1:02:29] with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall
[1:02:32] Believe in thine heart that God hath
[1:02:34] raised him from the dead Thou shalt be
[1:02:37] saved you see how salvation comes it
[1:02:40] doesn't come people say oh you just got
[1:02:42] to confess Jesus Christ as your savior
[1:02:44] that's all you got to do just just come
[1:02:45] on come on just confess it I've I've
[1:02:47] seen people going on the streets you
[1:02:49] know trying to get you know help people
[1:02:51] on the streets and just just say no just
[1:02:53] just come on come here come here come
[1:02:54] here just confess it sin this say say it
[1:02:57] after
[1:02:58] me that's not going to do it that might
[1:03:02] be a
[1:03:03] start but they need to come to a place
[1:03:06] where they lay prostate before him and
[1:03:09] they they become naked in his presence
[1:03:11] and realize that they need this
[1:03:13] Supernatural God to do more than just
[1:03:15] because they've spoken out before
[1:03:17] they've they've cried out to God
[1:03:19] everybody cries out to God when in a
[1:03:21] time of emergency oh God help me here
[1:03:24] you know but not not but they don't want
[1:03:26] to go to God and scream out and say
[1:03:27] Glory Hallelujah praise our God but when
[1:03:31] a time of emergency comes they oh God
[1:03:33] why did this happened to me and they
[1:03:35] want to curse
[1:03:37] God but no you need to have it all lined
[1:03:41] up properly so that if Thou shalt
[1:03:43] confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus
[1:03:46] the Lord meaning that you've made him
[1:03:48] Lord over your life and Shall Believe in
[1:03:51] your heart that God hath raised him from
[1:03:54] the dead Thou shalt be saved there it is
[1:03:57] again for with the heart man believeth
[1:04:01] unto righteousness and with the mouth
[1:04:04] confession is made unto salvation and we
[1:04:08] carry the word of Salvation within us
[1:04:11] when we confess it and that's why our
[1:04:14] business and the father's business is
[1:04:16] salvation is that when we testify and
[1:04:18] when we give testimony of what God has
[1:04:21] done in our lives it can actually bring
[1:04:23] Salvation into other people's lives
[1:04:25] that's how I received it that's how you
[1:04:27] received it for the scripture saith
[1:04:30] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[1:04:35] ashamed aren't you glad of
[1:04:37] that glory to God Amen praise God
[1:04:40] forever more and
[1:04:43] so um here listen to brother Bram he
[1:04:46] says notice now when Jesus was here on
[1:04:48] Earth he made the sacrifice for healing
[1:04:51] and for salvation everything was done do
[1:04:54] you believe that
[1:04:56] Jesus could not come today tonight and
[1:04:59] save
[1:05:02] you he's already done it the sin
[1:05:05] question was settled he is the Lamb of
[1:05:07] God that took and take a take away look
[1:05:12] look took away the sins of the world he
[1:05:14] was wounded for our transgressions with
[1:05:17] his stripes we were healed in past tense
[1:05:21] he says no matter how much you would
[1:05:24] scream out how much you would scream out
[1:05:26] that wouldn't do a bit of good until you
[1:05:29] accept
[1:05:31] it and he is the high priest sitting at
[1:05:34] the right hand of the Majesty on high to
[1:05:37] make intercession on our profession see
[1:05:40] he's he's making intercession on our
[1:05:42] profession a lot of people want to go to
[1:05:45] other intercessors there is no there is
[1:05:47] no other intercessors by the way there's
[1:05:49] only one intercessor and the Bible says
[1:05:51] very clearly it's Jesus Christ there is
[1:05:53] no other intercessor I don't care if you
[1:05:56] go to the Virgin Mary I don't care if
[1:05:57] you go to St Christopher or you go to St
[1:05:59] Joseph or you go to St Peter or whoever
[1:06:02] you want to go to they can never
[1:06:04] intercede for you ever there's no
[1:06:07] scripture for it nowhere in the Bible I
[1:06:10] listen God bless you for your your
[1:06:13] sincere desire to to to you know to go
[1:06:16] to the Virgin Mary to go to these
[1:06:18] intercessors but you're sincerely wrong
[1:06:22] and you need to come back to the word of
[1:06:24] God and know that he the high priest
[1:06:26] Jesus Christ went to the Cross he's the
[1:06:28] one that died for your sins he's the one
[1:06:31] that died for your healing he's the one
[1:06:33] that died for your salvation nobody else
[1:06:36] and so that's the only way we come to
[1:06:39] True salvation amen praise God and so no
[1:06:42] matter how much you can scream you've
[1:06:44] got to accept it and profess it see
[1:06:47] that's correct same way by healing he
[1:06:51] says the same
[1:06:53] Revelation comes by healing feeling
[1:06:56] everything needs to be professed and
[1:06:59] recognized by the grace of God let's go
[1:07:02] to the next
[1:07:03] scripture we're moving along just fine
[1:07:05] here this morning I got some things I
[1:07:08] want to uh you know the Lord just
[1:07:10] blessed me with all of this and I just
[1:07:11] want to unveil I just want to just get
[1:07:14] it off of me and I believe that that uh
[1:07:16] somebody's going to receive something
[1:07:18] out of it in Revelations chapter
[1:07:21] 10
[1:07:22] um sorry let me just
[1:07:26] yeah Revelation 10: 8-1 11 very familiar
[1:07:30] scripture you know it's interesting back
[1:07:33] in
[1:07:34] 1995 this Revelation struck my heart and
[1:07:38] I looked back and and it was back then
[1:07:41] that I got my first email address for as
[1:07:46] a Son of God you know and my first email
[1:07:50] address was rev
[1:07:52] 1011 and it's still to this day I've got
[1:07:56] rev 1011 at Hotmail I've got rev 1011 at
[1:07:58] gmail nobody else can have
[1:08:02] it because it's a revelation that God
[1:08:05] gave to me became so real when that when
[1:08:08] I listened I I was at a service and that
[1:08:11] scripture came out and it just jumped
[1:08:13] out of the pages it struck my heart and
[1:08:16] I said my God and every time I read it
[1:08:19] every time I see it it just it it makes
[1:08:22] the reality of this message and the day
[1:08:24] that we're living in more real to me he
[1:08:27] says and the voice which I heard from
[1:08:29] Heaven spake unto me again and said go
[1:08:32] and take the little book which is open
[1:08:35] in the hand of the Angel which standeth
[1:08:37] upon the sea and upon the earth now
[1:08:39] remember brother brandham fulfilled
[1:08:41] Revelations 10
[1:08:43] 1-7 he never ever went to Revelations
[1:08:48] 108 go ahead search it you will not see
[1:08:51] that he ever went there because it
[1:08:53] didn't pertain to him pertain to you and
[1:08:57] me and he says take that book because
[1:09:01] now the mighty Angels come down he's
[1:09:03] open the book The Seals have been open
[1:09:06] the word has been open and now it's
[1:09:08] available to you the next stage of the
[1:09:11] ministry brother brandham had to
[1:09:13] decrease so that Christ could come on
[1:09:15] the scene and fulfill through Ephesians
[1:09:19] chapter 4 the ministry for this hour
[1:09:22] which was Christ in his bride
[1:09:26] this is the bride age this is the time
[1:09:28] for the bride to manifest the word speak

[1:09:34] he's talking to he says take that book
[1:09:37] take that open book as a matter of fact
[1:09:40] and he said take it and eat it up and it
[1:09:41] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[1:09:44] be in thy mouth sweet as honey oh you
[1:09:47] know when when when when it's sweet in

[1:12:34] Revelation to do and to act on the word
[1:12:37] and that's how you'll know that his
[1:12:39] spirit is in you because it'll start to
[1:12:41] do the things that he does it'll start
[1:12:44] to express and edify the body of Christ
[1:12:48] like the B like the Bible says in
[1:12:49] Corinthians that the body nourisheth
[1:12:52] itself okay if you're truly member of of
[1:12:56] of the of the ministry and this local
[1:12:58] body you will edify the
[1:13:01] body you will not de edify the body you
[1:13:05] will not be a sore that never seems to
[1:13:09] heal and constantly needs to be dealt
[1:13:12] with and dressed and constantly needs to
[1:13:14] be oh oh you know we got to Pat it and
[1:13:17] and and deal with it and what's that
[1:13:20] it's either you haven't fully
[1:13:21] surrendered or you need to find
[1:13:24] somewhere else to wor worship because
[1:13:25] you're not going to do us any good here
[1:13:27] if you're in constant you know uh
[1:13:30] Rebellion you you don't want to come
[1:13:31] under subjection to the word come on
[1:13:34] Saints you know wherever you are if
[1:13:37] you're a part of God's local economy and
[1:13:39] his body the Bible says you will edify
[1:13:42] the body of Christ your ministry will
[1:13:45] edify your fellowship will edify it will
[1:13:49] not separate it will not bring division
[1:13:51] it will not have a spirit of Gossip
[1:13:54] praise God Hallelujah this is preaching
[1:13:56] I can't help it but this is where it all
[1:13:58] starts Saints we got to we got to come
[1:14:00] under the the real true leadership of
[1:14:03] God's word if we want that word to have
[1:14:04] an effect and we want to see the
[1:14:06] supernatural in our lives and so here
[1:14:09] now this the reason I'm bringing this he
[1:14:11] says here and he said unto me thou must
[1:14:15] prophesy again before many peoples and
[1:14:18] Nations and tongues and
[1:14:22] Kings you and me have a
[1:14:25] testimony you look at the word prophecy
[1:14:29] prophesy it means to give testimony it
[1:14:32] was look here he says right
[1:14:38] here in the in the
[1:14:40] translation okay actually I'm not going
[1:14:43] to go there just yet because it's going
[1:14:44] to be the next
[1:14:45] scripture but we need to understand that
[1:14:48] God has placed us into this ministry of
[1:14:51] Revelations
[1:14:53] 108 to 11
[1:14:55] and then one thing that I noticed just
[1:14:57] an observation of course go back to the
[1:15:00] previous
[1:15:02] scripture Romans
[1:15:04] 108
[1:15:06] to2
[1:15:07] profession confession and here we are in
[1:15:11] Revelations
[1:15:13] 108 to
[1:15:15] 11 I'm just saying what I'm a little
[1:15:18] superstitious no I'm saying God is
[1:15:22] making it clear that we can draw from
[1:15:24] his word by Revelation things that he is
[1:15:28] doing to vindicate and confirm his word
[1:15:30] over and over and over again and if he
[1:15:33] brings it to your attention it's because
[1:15:36] he wants you to know about it he wants
[1:15:38] you to see what it is that he's doing
[1:15:40] now let's go to the next scripture and
[1:15:43] see how powerful this is and there was
[1:15:46] war in
[1:15:48] heaven Michael and his angels fought
[1:15:51] against the dragon and the dragon fought
[1:15:54] and his angels listen we're we're we're
[1:15:56] in Warfare Saints you need to know that
[1:15:58] you need to realize that that's why it's
[1:16:00] so hard to come into the house of the
[1:16:02] Lord to get into your position to you
[1:16:04] know to to be a blessing in the body to
[1:16:07] give you financially to the ministry to
[1:16:09] you know to do all those things to give
[1:16:11] of your time it's a fight there's a
[1:16:13] constant battle for your time one minute
[1:16:16] the phone's pulling you here and and
[1:16:17] then they're pulling you there and then
[1:16:19] this situation arises it's all
[1:16:21] distractions to get you away from the
[1:16:24] father's business business but God wants
[1:16:26] you to get
[1:16:27] focused and he says here listen yes he
[1:16:30] he knows you're in a fight but he's
[1:16:33] there if you can profess and confess
[1:16:35] he's the one that's there fighting your
[1:16:37] battles for you I'm I'm witnessing that
[1:16:39] and I'm I was telling my wife I said Jen
[1:16:42] I'm praising God all the time since I
[1:16:44] came into this office the like I know
[1:16:47] it's fearful and and and it's been and
[1:16:49] and it's not easy and and it's it's a
[1:16:51] great battle but I can tell you I've
[1:16:54] never seen the Lord raise a standard
[1:16:56] around my life like he has done in the
[1:16:58] last 6 months while I've been in this
[1:17:01] position I know it's got to be the the
[1:17:03] the the prayers of the Saints whatever
[1:17:05] it is I give God all the glory for it
[1:17:08] because when the battles come and the
[1:17:09] situations come and I and I get into a
[1:17:11] place where I just bow my head and I
[1:17:13] don't know and I don't understand and
[1:17:15] then something takes place God does
[1:17:17] something and I see the Supernatural and
[1:17:20] I Rejoice I'm experiencing this
[1:17:24] profession and this confession I've
[1:17:26] taken my position I am professing it I
[1:17:29] accept it I'm allowing the Holy Spirit
[1:17:31] to place me as the pastor of Good
[1:17:33] Neighbor Ministries and I believe if God
[1:17:36] shows you clearly that I am your pastor
[1:17:39] that you will benefit through this
[1:17:40] ministry by the word of God not because
[1:17:43] of brother Dany or Pastor Dany but
[1:17:45] because you have come into the
[1:17:47] revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[1:17:51] present stage of his ministry and allow
[1:17:53] him to do in your life what what he
[1:17:55] wants to do and you will see the
[1:17:58] supernatural you will witness the
[1:18:00] supernatural you will experience things
[1:18:02] that you never thought were possible
[1:18:04] you'll get job raises you'll get
[1:18:06] financial blessings you'll get healings
[1:18:08] you'll get uh relationship situations
[1:18:11] dealt with and healed God will do all of
[1:18:14] those things I'm witnessing it I'm
[1:18:17] experiencing it and it's because I
[1:18:19] believe it and I confess it with my
[1:18:23] mouth praise God forever more and so
[1:18:26] here now he's saying you listen there's
[1:18:28] a battle and he and and and listen the
[1:18:30] Angel Michael and his angels fought
[1:18:32] against the dragon and the dragon fought
[1:18:34] and his angels and prevailed not neither
[1:18:37] was their place found anymore in heaven
[1:18:40] and the Great Dragon was cast out that
[1:18:43] old serpent called the devil who was the
[1:18:45] serpent back in the Garden of Eden that
[1:18:47] went and spoke to Eve it was the
[1:18:49] devil right there it's just clear that
[1:18:52] old serpent it's right there Genesis
[1:18:55] three called the devil and Satan which
[1:18:59] deceived the whole
[1:19:03] world you can't go over that the whole
[1:19:09] world deception if if there's ever been
[1:19:12] a time where the whole religious world
[1:19:15] and the whole global economy and
[1:19:17] everything else is under under deception
[1:19:20] it's right now Israel is is right in the
[1:19:23] place where she's supposed to be under
[1:19:26] the conditions and the circumstances
[1:19:28] that she's supposed to be right now
[1:19:30] because the world is fulfilling that
[1:19:33] prophecy that we just read in in
[1:19:36] Revelations 108 to to 11 even the kings
[1:19:39] are going to hear this prophecy that's
[1:19:42] why he says Thou must prophesy again
[1:19:43] before many nations this word has gone
[1:19:47] out Nationwide it's gone to Kings it's
[1:19:49] gone to every single individual in power
[1:19:53] if they don't if they reject it that's
[1:19:55] that's their problem but this word will
[1:19:57] not fail heavens and earth will pass
[1:20:00] away but this word is going to it's not
[1:20:02] going to
[1:20:03] fail it's going to be fulfilled amen
[1:20:06] praise God and that's why this this
[1:20:08] whole thing is is is because deception
[1:20:12] is all over the world and he was cast
[1:20:13] out into the Earth and his angels were
[1:20:16] cast out with him and I heard a loud
[1:20:19] voice saying in heaven
[1:20:21] now is salvation come CU that's when
[1:20:25] Christ came this is where
[1:20:29] salvation was made available and that's
[1:20:32] why there is no other way to be saved
[1:20:34] but through Jesus Christ and that's why
[1:20:36] we always bring that right back you got
[1:20:38] to come back to the word you got to come
[1:20:40] God's provided way and he says here now
[1:20:44] is Salva now has come salvation and
[1:20:47] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[1:20:49] the power of His Christ what's he
[1:20:52] talking about his Anointed The Power
[1:20:54] power of His anointed remember Christ in
[1:20:58] you my my my I don't want to get ahead
[1:21:00] of myself you see
[1:21:04] the his anointed for the accuser of our
[1:21:08] Brethren is cast down which accused them
[1:21:11] before our God day and night and they
[1:21:14] overcame him by the blood of the lamb
[1:21:17] and watch now and by the word of their
[1:21:22] testimony what do you testim
[1:21:25] what word are you declaring what
[1:21:27] business are you in are you in the
[1:21:30] father's business because if you're in
[1:21:32] the father's business then you're
[1:21:34] declaring the father's word am you ever
[1:21:37] try to go and join a company go right up
[1:21:40] the guy want to see the
[1:21:42] president I'm going to tell you how to
[1:21:44] run this
[1:21:46] company before he even says the next
[1:21:49] word there's two guys throwing them
[1:21:51] right out you're not going to tell the
[1:21:53] president how how to run his company
[1:21:57] when he's been running it since before
[1:22:00] the foundations of the world so don't
[1:22:02] come to me and give me your
[1:22:04] interpretation on baptism your
[1:22:06] interpretation on the Trinity your
[1:22:09] interpretation on on uh you know uh the
[1:22:12] uh intercession of the Saints don't I
[1:22:14] don't want to hear it show me in the
[1:22:16] word of God where it exists show me that
[1:22:20] you can back it by God's word and by the
[1:22:22] revelation of God's word and then I'll
[1:22:25] believe it because I can never by the
[1:22:27] Holy Ghost In Me deny that word and when
[1:22:30] somebody denies the word and says I got
[1:22:32] the Holy Ghost something's wrong it's as
[1:22:35] simple as
[1:22:37] that by the word of their testimony
[1:22:39] that's how they overcame and that's how
[1:22:41] you're going to overcome and they loved
[1:22:43] not their lives unto death and that's
[1:22:46] what we were talking about that when you
[1:22:47] come to a place where you believe the
[1:22:50] word to the point where where you're
[1:22:52] you're not afraid of of any anything
[1:22:54] you're going to stand right there that's
[1:22:57] what he's talking about there that that
[1:22:59] they loved not their lives unto death
[1:23:01] therefore Rejoice ye heavens and ye that
[1:23:04] dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of
[1:23:06] the earth and of the sea for the devil
[1:23:09] has come down unto you having great
[1:23:12] wrath because he knoweth that he hath
[1:23:15] but a short
[1:23:17] time his time is short and he knows it
[1:23:20] and that's why this world is not going
[1:23:21] to get any better I'm not being the
[1:23:24] bearer bad news I'm just telling you
[1:23:25] what prophecy through the scripture is
[1:23:28] saying and what is going to come to this
[1:23:30] earth it's not going to get any better
[1:23:33] there's going to be some tribula
[1:23:36] tribulation times that are going to
[1:23:38] strike the Earth you got to know where
[1:23:40] you stand and who you are in the word of
[1:23:43] God but when you look at the word
[1:23:44] testimony now
[1:23:47] okay and we're going
[1:23:49] to let me see
[1:23:52] here yeah we're defin definitely not
[1:23:54] going to finish
[1:23:56] today but we're going to continue next
[1:23:58] week because it's it's good when you
[1:24:00] look at testimony and you look at the
[1:24:03] Greek translation the word marua m a r t
[1:24:09] r i a
[1:24:11] matura kind of like maturity you know
[1:24:13] maturity but anyways a
[1:24:16] testifying it's it's it's testimony
[1:24:19] record
[1:24:20] report the office uh uh
[1:24:24] committed to the prophets of testifying
[1:24:27] concerning future events that's that's
[1:24:31] the definition a testifying the office
[1:24:34] committed to the prophets of testifying
[1:24:37] concerning future events what one
[1:24:40] testifies
[1:24:41] testimony and so Revelations 108 thou
[1:24:45] must prophesy again we're giving
[1:24:48] testimony of what God is doing now it's
[1:24:53] not so much repeating everything that
[1:24:55] God did oh God sent a prophet God said
[1:24:58] all people want to do is they want to go
[1:25:00] and give people the tracks of brother
[1:25:02] branam and it's good but you got to give
[1:25:04] it to them by Revelation you got to give
[1:25:06] it to them with with the right
[1:25:07] understanding so that you can lead them
[1:25:09] in the right way because like I told you
[1:25:12] I came to this message and it wasn't
[1:25:14] until nine months later after I was
[1:25:16] delivered from from the sickness from
[1:25:19] the addiction of my life from the things
[1:25:21] answering and delivering me and giving
[1:25:23] me an experience with God that I came to
[1:25:25] realize that God had sent a
[1:25:27] prophet so it wasn't that that but the
[1:25:31] minute that the Holy Ghost
[1:25:33] came it had to lead me to the word and
[1:25:37] when the word became alive to me Malachi
[1:25:39] 4:5 became alive Revelations 10 1-7
[1:25:43] became alive brother bram's Ministry
[1:25:46] became alive I saw how it actually fit
[1:25:49] perfectly into the restoration of the
[1:25:51] word by looking at even the Natural
[1:25:53] History of the Reformation of Luther
[1:25:56] Wesley Pentecost and William brandham
[1:25:59] it's just that the world doesn't want to
[1:26:01] you know most of the world they don't
[1:26:03] want to research and go in and see
[1:26:05] clearly how William branham's Ministry
[1:26:08] was the Fulfillment of these scriptures
[1:26:10] to turn the hearts of the children back
[1:26:12] to the faith of the fathers and that's
[1:26:14] the business that we're in
[1:26:18] today and so we're giving our testimony
[1:26:23] and our testimony becomes powerful when
[1:26:25] somebody can receive it because it's the
[1:26:28] word for this hour amen praise God and
[1:26:33] so the
[1:26:35] prophecy that calls out the bride is
[1:26:39] what we
[1:26:40] contain our prophecy and the word that's
[1:26:43] in US it doesn't call nominal
[1:26:48] Christians that's why they can't respond
[1:26:51] to it that's why you'll talk to them
[1:26:53] about the word you'll talk tell them
[1:26:54] about the word and then they'll just
[1:26:57] well that's nice good to see you nice
[1:27:00] meeting you see you later and you got to
[1:27:03] say see you later hope to meet you for
[1:27:05] coffee again sometime whatever you got
[1:27:09] because my sheep hear my voice but you
[1:27:12] go and let
[1:27:13] somebody that's walking by and they hear
[1:27:19] something and catches their attention I
[1:27:22] remember when I was at brother Gabriel's
[1:27:25] and I believe brother Tim was there and
[1:27:27] there was a couple of other believers
[1:27:28] were there at that time visiting brother
[1:27:31] Gabriel they give testimony of that
[1:27:33] because they remember seeing me come in
[1:27:35] with this wild boy running
[1:27:39] around and I remember hearing them
[1:27:42] saying God bless you God bless you just
[1:27:46] just remembered it did it did it do
[1:27:48] anything no but but now I realize the
[1:27:52] word was in the place
[1:27:55] the word was
[1:27:56] present and anybody that's a word
[1:27:59] carrier becomes a word
[1:28:01] giver and that's why Apollo's planted
[1:28:05] but God Waters
[1:28:07] it you see what I mean the word's got to
[1:28:10] get watered by the spirit that's why you
[1:28:13] could read every single track of William
[1:28:15] brandham and you become so much a parrot
[1:28:18] and so much a person that can quote
[1:28:20] every single quote everything he said
[1:28:23] perfectly but without the spirit you're
[1:28:25] only a parrot you're not a son or a
[1:28:28] daughter of God I'm not being
[1:28:31] disrespectful but I'm just telling you
[1:28:33] the way it is there's got to be an
[1:28:35] Awakening in the bride because right now
[1:28:38] this there's a great falling away that's
[1:28:39] taking place and deception is is is at
[1:28:43] the highest level now the highest level
[1:28:46] that it would deceive even the very
[1:28:47] elect well the very elect are not stuck
[1:28:49] in Catholic churches and and Pentecostal
[1:28:52] churches
[1:28:54] they're right in the ranks of the
[1:28:56] message that's where the very elect are
[1:28:59] and that's where the foolish virgin is
[1:29:01] and there's we're the ones that are
[1:29:02] going to reject this word that when we
[1:29:05] bring it out in this way and and we we
[1:29:07] just tell it plain the way it is and and
[1:29:10] they don't want to they don't want to
[1:29:11] they don't want to hear it that way they
[1:29:12] think that we're off the word fine what
[1:29:14] are you going to do let them go on but
[1:29:17] we go on the word will progress and take
[1:29:20] us listen to brother Bram he says these
[1:29:22] men why why was they called and was put
[1:29:26] in this condition now think these
[1:29:29] Pharisees by Jesus said in vain you
[1:29:32] worship me worship Him genuine worship
[1:29:36] true worship from their hearts you in
[1:29:39] vain you worship me why teaching for
[1:29:43] Doctrine their tradition of
[1:29:46] man therefore you make the Commandments
[1:29:48] of God of no effect to the people here
[1:29:51] he was rebuking the people for the the
[1:29:54] very same things they're taking just the
[1:29:57] Traditions they're just you only say
[1:30:00] what the prophet said you only say what
[1:30:03] the prophet said you only listen to the
[1:30:05] tapes you don't need to be under a
[1:30:07] minister no no no no no no see they made
[1:30:11] the word of God and the Commandments of
[1:30:14] God the word of God not the word of man
[1:30:17] the word of God of none
[1:30:19] effect and all of a sudden it it it I
[1:30:22] and if I taught you a Methodist message
[1:30:25] it would take no effect on you this is
[1:30:27] bright time he
[1:30:29] says if if Moses taught the message of
[1:30:32] Noah it would it would take no effect if
[1:30:35] Jesus taught Moses message it would take
[1:30:37] no effect because the predestinated seed
[1:30:40] are laying there that will only be
[1:30:43] watered by that type of water that's
[1:30:46] give for that
[1:30:49] seed see it won't grow under any other
[1:30:53] condition
[1:30:54] it must be the condition that grows it
[1:30:57] and the condition is the word for this
[1:31:01] hour and Jesus
[1:31:04] Christ in the present stage of his
[1:31:11] ministry I'm gonna I'm gonna end with
[1:31:14] this quote and then we're gonna come
[1:31:16] back next week we're GNA
[1:31:19] finish let the musicians come in birth
[1:31:23] pains brother speaks here he says the
[1:31:25] word must
[1:31:27] deliver the word bride
[1:31:30] church I'm going to repeat that the word
[1:31:33] must deliver the word bride church not
[1:31:37] all the other churches out there that's
[1:31:39] why don't think that they're going to
[1:31:40] accept this message you could go into a
[1:31:43] whole church of Pentecostals and preach
[1:31:46] this message and at the end of the day
[1:31:48] they would just say thank you for coming
[1:31:50] brother have a nice life
[1:31:54] or you could go somewhere where I hear
[1:31:56] it's happened where they go into
[1:31:57] churches in Africa we've had testimonies
[1:32:00] where they'll go in it's a Pentecostal
[1:32:02] church and they'll come in with the word
[1:32:04] of God that I've been preaching here
[1:32:05] this morning under the anointing of the
[1:32:07] spirit of God and the spirit of God
[1:32:09] falls into the hearts of the people and
[1:32:11] the whole church gets
[1:32:15] converted and rejoices and and and just
[1:32:18] can't believe that they've come into
[1:32:19] this revelation of what God is doing in
[1:32:22] this day and in this hour but he says
[1:32:24] here the word must deliver the word
[1:32:27] bride church the church has got to be
[1:32:29] delivered out of her a bride for Christ
[1:32:34] remember the church comes out of the
[1:32:37] church
[1:32:40] World them that fell asleep in all ages
[1:32:44] will make up that bride and come out on
[1:32:48] the word that they come out on like from
[1:32:51] your feet coming to your head she gets
[1:32:54] greater and the more you have to have
[1:32:57] and so forth as the body grows up so
[1:33:00] does the body of Christ grow up and then
[1:33:04] finally the head will come to it like it
[1:33:06] did in
[1:33:07] 1963 and the head of it will now if we
[1:33:11] notice cause it's all linked to the head
[1:33:15] the head does the turning and the
[1:33:19] pulling and in 1963 when that
[1:33:22] Supernatural cloud came down in the
[1:33:25] opening of those Seven Seals it was to
[1:33:28] release the Mysteries that were under
[1:33:32] those Seven Seals and under that seventh
[1:33:35] seal there were
[1:33:37] names and when that seal opened up names
[1:33:41] started to get
[1:33:43] called it all started right then there
[1:33:46] was a dispensational change it was
[1:33:49] coming into the final stages of the
[1:33:52] Gentile age coming to an end and God is
[1:33:57] calling the last
[1:34:00] few we will continue this next week and
[1:34:03] it's just going to get better and better
