of order the best thing is get to Jesus in a way the original top Salvation an old time machine you got to get their church blue 5 verse 17 to 24 Luke 5:17 and 24 to 17 compassion to certain things as he was teaching that there were Pharisees and doctrines of the Lost City Bible to come out of here every time we Galilee in Judea and Jerusalem and the power of the Lord was present to heal them even though this was all the people coming around there power of the Lord was a penalty they were in this little there is no support from Anthony in Jesus was standing in their teaching to be simply he said the old men brought in a band of man which was taking root palsy that said he can disease and said they thought about what means he might bring him in and lay him before him it couldn't be didn't about that you were so great for it the widow's they were in the door they couldn't get him in and what they could not find what way they might bring him in because of the multitude they went up on the housetop and laid it down through the tiling when the shout into the mess before Jesus see those Deacons Craig Internet walk right in front of the lower right okay and it's not like him in the dimension it's not only we know that Jesus didn't see me verse 20 says and when he saw there they were so determined to get to Jesus so they come when he saw their faith he said it's a man I said to forgive me the Pharisees scribes said they begin to reason thing was when Jesus perceived their thoughts the answering said unto them what recently in your heart whether teachers say that forgiving it which they rise up and walk were that you may notice on man that power on earth to forgive sins he's actually in the street of the palsy I said that he lights up and pick up that couch in Co Atlanta house and he jumps up off that car he picks up his bed and they let him out through the roof see you later guys don't you know standing here you talk about that one first customer first got saved and I first have called crazy and I use such things like this when the blind man came to Jesus to be healed and Jesus stopped it he stood down and picked up some some dirt and clay and he spit he started rolling and he snuck into the man's eyes you talk about until the man [Music] I think naman the leper had leprosy Oliver had to go live another free company when Israel came across with Syria they captured a teenage suit either like Berlin Raqqa Syria to wait on Neiman's household his wife his children who's a working girl working in there she could've been discouraged just she could have been so upset she could have been singing why me Lord what a viper done but no she no more she was planted started testifying telling him his wife about the power of God of the prophet of God I was thinking for doing and she said I would have gotten my neighbor could get into the prophet of God for I go God will recover his leprosy if somebody heard this and will take you to the king of Syria that didn't work until finally they sent England to the Prophet Sawa's story become very cherish stepping outside sir went up to the door and was there I'm here and he had this and the three can see back together remember you said behold I thought surely you come on strike and I should send a servant seven times or get seven times in Jordan and that special coming in like a little baby longsword

raised him up is right here now we are now in heaven places we are now in the power of the Resurrection if that wasn't the law then sons and daughters of God can create them a world of gold upon a private life but you have a party you do that right now if the power you need to do it if you've got a shadow of the power of God you've got the power to do it you could speak a world into existence and go live on the television anymore that's what powers on the church right now a church right now but it's controlled by its controlled by law and that law is not keeping a bunch of amendment it's the law of faith all things are possible to them [Music] so underneath legend even coming you're going bachelor children the church is gonna be glass [Music] [Music] [Applause] put seats out what
