[18:00] when christ was on the cross we were in
[18:03] him
[18:04] when he when you stood in the
[18:07] paris parasite that we were there
[18:11] when he was standing in sanhedrin they
[18:13] were mocking him we were there

[18:52] he went for it
[18:55] that he gave everything upon himself he
[18:58] took everything for himself that we
[19:00] should not go
[19:02] the same way that he went through
[19:04] so we have to be the happiest people in
[19:06] the face of the earth
[19:08] hallelujah thank you lord he gave you

[19:34] yeah is it 27 or 28.
[19:43] no we need to i need a 28-27
[19:54] that's 27
[20:00] you
[20:02] 27. is that 27
[20:06] okay 27
[20:10] if you cry to hide okay
[20:13] if you try to hurt your sins
[20:15] you will never succeed
[20:17] but if you humble
[20:19] confess and reject
[20:21] reject him you will receive mercy
[20:25] if you try to hide your sins
[20:27] you will never succeed
[20:30] you cannot hide your sins
[20:38] because the bible said
[20:40] the believer
[20:43] does not make
[20:46] don't have sin
[20:48] because he took everything upon himself
[20:52] so you cannot hide nothing from god
[20:59] bible said you have an advocate
[21:02] with the father
[21:05] so he is the judge
[21:08] all what you have to do
[21:10] you have to get on your knees and repent
[21:14] and talk to him
[21:15] because
[21:16] he wants us to talk to him
[21:19] he don't want us to get away
[21:23] he wants us to talk to him
[21:27] don't
[21:28] encroach yourself to somewhere
[21:31] because of what you have done
[21:34] he is your lawyer
[21:36] the same time he is your judge
[21:40] so
[21:41] you have to pray you have to talk to him
[21:46] don't exclude yourself
[21:50] hallelujah you cannot cut cut you cannot
[21:53] cut corners
[21:57] hallelujah
[22:01] amen
[22:02] glory to god
[22:05] even
[22:06] david said
[22:09] you know that david
[22:11] he has so many thoughts he was a man
[22:15] he did something
[22:16] that he cannot do he shouldn't do
[22:21] but he thought he was doing in secret
[22:24] what can you hide what can you hide from
[22:26] god in secret
[22:28] you tell me
[22:30] what can you hide from god in secret you
[22:32] cannot hide nothing
[22:35] even the syrians they want to attack
[22:38] israel they went to their best chamber
[22:40] to have a conversation how they are
[22:42] going to attack them by the time they
[22:44] realize everything is in israel
[22:46] what they are doing
[22:48] so how can you hide something from god
[22:51] you cannot
[22:54] and god said he has forgiven you
[22:56] everything already
[22:58] he put it under the sea
[23:00] where you cannot reach to
[23:03] take it take it back
[23:07] why
[23:08] he wants you to be free
[23:11] the bible says we are created
[23:14] free moral agency
[23:17] he
[23:18] we are his children
[23:19] we are his partnership she's so he
[23:22] always wanted to talk to him
[23:26] talk to him
[23:27] you did something wrong talk to him
[23:30] god is a being
[23:33] before when we know god was saying we
[23:36] thought god was way high in the sky i
[23:39] used to look around to see if i can pick
[23:42] go and take my eye on
[23:44] above the crowd to see him when i was
[23:47] young
[23:48] when i see the moon when i see the moon
[23:51] i look the moon i thought god was there
[23:54] hallelujah
[23:57] not knowing
[23:58] he was living inside of me
[24:01] hallelujah
[24:02] so how can you hide something from him
[24:05] even before the thought comes to your
[24:07] mind he already knows
[24:10] hallelujah
[24:12] oh glory to god our god is good
[24:16] amen
[24:18] david said even if i send
[24:23] i send into heaven he is there
[24:28] and behold
[24:30] if i i make my bed under hell
[24:33] he's already there
[24:35] so why are you gonna hide
[24:38] you cannot hide
[24:40] thank you
[24:42] he is always there for you
[24:45] he holds there for you there is no
[24:47] mistake
[24:49] that god cannot forgive you
[24:51] there's only one mistake as the holy
[24:53] spirit then if you sin against the holy
[24:56] spirit you blaspheme against the holy
[24:59] spirit
[25:00] you would be never be forgiving
[25:03] because holy spirit is god
[25:05] himself
[25:07] so any other than that
[25:10] god will forgive you everything
[25:12] rise up
[25:15] and go forward
[25:17] hallelujah
[25:19] we're gonna go slide number 29
[25:27] 29
[25:29] that's 29
[25:30] okay yes i look around and ask the holy
[25:34] spirit to use me
[25:37] how many here tonight want the holy
[25:40] spirit to use them
[25:42] hallelujah
[25:44] this is what we are here for
[25:48] when we read the bible we hear
[25:50] what god does to our brethren
[25:53] our four fathers everybody rejoiced
[25:58] when we read about paul
[26:01] when we read about peter
[26:03] when we read about john
[26:05] when we read about nathaniel
[26:08] but jesus christ said he is the same
[26:11] yesterday today and forever
[26:14] he does not change
[26:19] even
[26:20] our
[26:21] prophet
[26:23] came down here
[26:24] we saw
[26:26] how
[26:28] how much the holy spirit used our
[26:30] brother
[26:32] and now
[26:36] he passed everything unto us
[26:39] we cannot come to his presence every day
[26:43] every night
[26:45] yes
[26:47] without seeing the manifestation of god
[26:50] in your life
[26:51] one time
[26:52] you have to see god in your life just
[26:55] one time
[26:57] that's your testimony that will drive
[26:59] you
[27:00] every time you guarantee that that thing
[27:02] hit your mind
[27:03] this this is not i did it but god
[27:06] that is your strength
[27:08] that is taking you right down to the
[27:11] journey you need something
[27:14] that will take in you
[27:15] to drive you
[27:18] hallelujah that's why this purpose of
[27:21] prayer is very important because
[27:24] god wants to draw you closer to himself
[27:27] hallelujah to know him
[27:30] the power of
[27:32] his resurrection each and everyone has a
[27:36] gift because the gift is in you that
