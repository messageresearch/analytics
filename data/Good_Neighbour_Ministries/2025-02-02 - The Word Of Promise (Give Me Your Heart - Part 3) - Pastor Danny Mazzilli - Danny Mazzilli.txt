him all the glory all the praise and all the honor welcome everybody into the house of the Lord this morning you may be seated just for a moment amen we want to give the Lord praise and glory it all started uh about a week ago last Friday when when um we were having our prayer meeting and brother Christopher and sister farita had brought up a request that brother Christopher was not feeling well um they both were kind of under the weather but uh you know brother Christopher's blood pressure had spiked all of a sudden out of nowhere and so the request came and we started to pray and we believe the Lord and then as the week progressed well things uh developed into an attack on our precious brother amen uh he wasn't feeling well uh Thursday he decided that or actually on Wednesday he decided that he would go to the hospital so they went to the hospital they checked in they started doing tests for some reason his blood pressure was not coming down and um uh they said well we're going to have to keep you uh they kept doing blood tests and checking they couldn't find anything uh finally at around 2: a.m. on Thursday morning uh brother Chris you know sister farita just left at about midnight and around 2: a.m. brother Christopher started to really feel terrible started to sweat immediately called the nurse and that's the last thing he remembers he went into a cardiac arrest and his heart stopped and luckily by the grace of God we know that it's God that led them to go to the hospital he was at the right place at the right time and divine intervention the doctors the Lord could use them right away to bring him back and to um stabilize him and bring him right back again I received the call it was around 2:30 in the morning I told sister farita after we prayed I said I'm on my way and uh you know I said Lord what's going on you know what I mean and and it just like you know it's it's a times like that where you really you you you focus into that relationship with the Lord you know and as I'm driving to the hospital you know I I said well I just hit my uh radio to put on some music and the songs I was listening to some uh gospel songs from the tidwells all week and it was one song After the other that the Lord was just showing me all is well there's nothing that that you know and all I could see was brother Christopher at the the hospital in the hospital bed and he was fine and that's what I was seeing while I was driving to the hospital and so when I got to the hospital I walked into the room there he was he looked over and he looked he I said praise God brother Chris I said how you feeling he says I'm feeling fine I said glory to God I said you look good you know he looked he looked like he didn't look like he'd just come out of a war for his life that's for sure and we know that that was the supernatural move in hand of God Amen praise God and so um you know from there you know he got transfer the next day they did an angiogram they checked his heart all they found was a one artery was a little bit plugged okay but that was not the cause of the cardiac arrest the doctor said clearly this was caused by improper medication the medication that he had received was not the proper medication and it and it didn't respond well with his body and it and it was just an attack of the enemy but God is always one step ahead amen amen praise God and so we want to give God the glory this morning that brother Christopher is now home amen he's doing much better he's getting stronger by the minute and uh let me tell you he's going to come back stronger than he ever was and that's what we need to know we need to know that God is able that through the trial he can take it and turn it right back around and give you even more strength more Victory and more faith to meet every challenge that we must face as Sons and Daughters of God Amen so praise God we want to give you that uh report I know that it didn't go out with all kind but everything happened so quickly and you know immediately you know I sent it out to the leadership team and we we were all praying and we were believing God and we know that there was a lot of prayer going out and uh they are very Greatful for all of that I'm sure that you'll be hearing a testimony when brother Christopher gets back we're going to let him rest and um and get uh completely back to his full strength again amen praise God and so um before we go to the word also we want to remember the Samy family in Trinidad last week um uh sister farid's uh they're they're related you know through uh sister-in-law and and brother-in-law and so forth sister Samy Gail Samy passed away last week um her husband was brother Winston who I met you know years ago when we went to to Trinidad uh lovely people praise God uh one by one they gained the portal praise the Lord uh she's reunited with brother Winston her husband who went a few years ago so let's uh continue to pray for uh their family that the Lord will strengthen them um through this time because it's always never easy for those that are left behind amen praise God and so um does anybody have a request this morning as we go to prayer and we go to the word of God Amen praise God father once again Lord we come to you uh Lord humbly before your presence oh God knowing Lord that uh as humans we are unable Lord even as a minister here I stand father Lord I'm I'm needy of you Lord and without your inspiration your Your Divine uh spirit moving across the word and inspiring my heart and the hearts of your children this morning lord it's it's just words it's just uh um more teachings and and uh Lord there's plenty of of that that's going on in the churches this morning but we're not interested in that Lord we're interested in the word for this day in knowing that you are present here in the service this morning that you will ride the word of God and speak to the very needs of every single son and daughter of God Lord that's listening in this morning Lord you're the one that can bring life to the word make it real to us Lord make it uh not some tradition or some habit of going to church but Lord something that's real that when we leave here we are stronger than ever we are we have the confidence of your word and the confidence to know that you have done something glorious in our midst Lord grant it this morning remember our former Pastor John Simon Lord this morning as he ministers your word in Iowa there at Higher Ground Tabernacle our precious brother Isaiah Brooks and the Little Flock there Lord may your spirit and your anointing move over that place this morning may you anoint our precious brother Lord to bring the word of life that the people would be encouraged and Lord leave victorious in the name of Jesus Christ Lord we know that you are good all the time and so we place this service now into your care in Jesus name amen praise God let's all stand as we read the word we're going to have a play and so we are not going to be keeping you long we're going to try to be done here by uh 12:30 at the latest amen and that'll give time for the um for the Sunday School uh to set up there's going to be a play after the service so we we uh invite you all to stay and support and watch and be blessed amen praise God let's read the word of God and so this morning we're going to be uh we're we're continuing along that thought that we started at the beginning of the new year give me your heart there's so many aspects of that I believe that today um you know the Lord is just going to take us into another area um along the same lines that we've been uh but we want to talk about the Word of Promise amen and we want to uh allow the Holy Spirit to speak to our hearts and give us the strength that we need amen you are ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart amen you may be seated praise God you know Paul was excited that um you know that that he as a minister would be ministering the word of God and that he knew that the that the word was having an effect on the people and the Lord knows that um you know he has uh designed it by the by the uh Ministry of preaching the word that we would receive what we have need of amen and word of God in this hour is uh is is so powerful it is much more than what the world you know the Christian Church world and the denominational teachings are making the word of God the word of God is the power of God it is the transforming power of God it's not something that just changes the flesh but it goes to the innermost part uh of the heart of the being of the Soul so that you are transformed and so that you actually become written Epistles the word of God in this day in this hour is not going to just set people free from sin and unbelief and from uh you know sickness those are those are just um aspects of the benefits of the word of God but the word of God for this hour is going to be written into the heart of the Sons and Daughters of God that it will bring forth the literal body of Jesus Christ it will bring forth the True Church the true church that was that was um the church that is of the word amen that is going to produce Jesus Christ once again in these last days because the church is out there they're gathering together they're preaching doctrines but most of them are doctrines of man we're not interested in the doctrines of man we are interested in the word that changes transforms and is going to produce the Rapture the body change the supernatural perfect faith that is going to translate us out of this Dimension that is now going into total chaos amen we are in a world we are in the last days we are in the time when everything goes into total chaos but God said he's going to have a bride he's going to have a church his Plan of Redemption will be fulfilled and there will be a people that will be able to receive that word and bring that word into full manifestation right before the very eyes of the world Amen praise God and so as we look into this we want to go to our next scripture in Romans chapter 9 9 we read from this scripture last week and we just want to we want to draw from it you know as as you know as I was studying all of this this week it just the word just keeps breaking open and everything starts to tie in everything starts to come together from Genesis all the way to revelation we start to see how these two Spirits have been operating right from the very beginning amen and how the the enemy is to you know Satan wants to have his bride he wants to have his people but his bride is going to be an intellectual bride it's going to be a bride that's going to be based on works it's going to be one that's going to be based on law uh you know because listen let's look at the scripture we're going to expound more as we go not as though the word of God hath taken none effect for they are not Israel which are Israel neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed singular be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed plural uh singular not plural singular for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son amen next slide here brother Bram speaking now I took I took a lot of this context and everything we're going to be speaking on this morning from this message the seed shall not be air with the shuck it's about a 60-minute sermon if you get a chance this week go back and listen to it after today it's going to it's going to really break open even more and it's going to become even more glorious to your soul amen praise God now here he says here the seed starts in the promise and we're talking about the the the Word of Promise the seed starts in the promise and Abraham here slightly doubted by Ish now he's not talking about that Abraham doubted but it was Sarah that actually doubted and Abraham listened to his wife and participated and I want to show you the three stages of these of this seed and that we're going to speak of which is not air with the Shu three stages so it's not just uh now it it's not just going to be be Cain and Abel it's not just Jacob and Esau it's not just Isaac and Ishmael but there's actually three stages here okay that we are going to be looking at but these two Spirits operating within these three stages now we find that in the beginning here that God gave Abraham the promise he gave adam the promise first and that was or the Covenant was on condition so when Adam received the Covenant the promise it was based on if Thou shalt do this then this will not happen in other words you can eat of all the trees that are in the garden but the day that you eat thereof you shall surely die so there was a promise of eternal life but the moment that any unbelief would come in death would come in and so he says if you will do this but when he gave it to Abraham it was unconditional thank you Jesus it was a a promised word that was totally unconditional to his seed amen amen I have already done it he never what he did it was unconditional he gave to Abraham now and through that Abraham having the promise therefore we have to be Abraham's seed it was not only to Abraham but to his seed after him now if you'll notice it wasn't seeds after him but seed after him amen praise God forever more and so now we want to look at our next scripture in Galatians 3: 18-31 now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ so the whole promise was based on a promise of the coming of Christ that that was the promised seed that was the one that would inherit the kingdom of God that was the one that he was talking to and so he says and this I say that the Covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ the law which was 430 years after cannot disol that it should make the promise of none effect so in other words we're not going to be looking that that anything Chang changed even though the children of Israel went into bondage for 430 years and all the things that that took place with Jacob and Esau and all the way down through all the unbelief all that the enemy did that he tried to deceive the Sons and Daughters of God and constantly bringing them into bondage and bringing them into sin they went into the Wilderness for 40 years they fell in the wilderness in in the in the in the valley of sin they they fell in unbelief amen praise God that promise was not based on on human uh uh completion it wasn't based on on all the things that we see back through the scriptures where man fell amen for if the inheritance can be of the law it is no more a promise so it wasn't based on the children of it listen the law was brought for the purpose of bringing man under obedience to God they they they they went wild because the lineage of Cain was a wild lineage it was a beastly nature it had no desire to serve God and the moment that it was mixing with the the Sons and Daughters of God unbelief was would set in and and that's why God had to bring the law in order to bring control over the beastly nature of the of the of the people because all were born in sin all came under the curse of the original sin and so that's why in you and me in in this condition in a human uh uh body we are going to have to struggle with that Jacob and Esau's spirit that Ishmael and Isaac's spirit that is constantly trying to pull us away from the word of God Amen but God has a promised word in this hour that he is going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle she will overcome the bonds woman amen let's let's let's move on for if the inheritance be of the law it is of no no more a promise but God gave it to Abraham by promise wherefore then serveth the law you know this is uh Paul speaking to the Galatians because there was a struggle between law and Grace and that struggle is going to be in you until you leave this place you're going to have to overcome that struggle that is within your nature that nature that that was injected into you because of the original sin and that's why a new birth is required it was added because of transgression that's why the law was added because of unbelief till the seed should come to whom the promise was made did you hear that y until the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by the angels in the hand of a mediator now a mediator is not a mediator of one but God is one and so here now what he was saying here was like Moses Moses was the mediator at the time God gave him the law and God would bring them the law Thou shalt not do this Thou shalt not do that thou shalt not do this and so the law and Moses became the mediator for the people because they would have to because of their their their unbelief and their sin they would have to make an offering unto the Lord Lord that's why when when when they sinned back in the Old Testament they knew that they had sinned they would have to take a lamb a goat something that they would have to uh uh offer it on the Altar and the life of the Innocence of the animal would cover the the the sin and the unbelief that was in the individual but then there was a seed that would receive promise that it would not re require the blood of bulls and goats and that's why the promised seed was Christ and that's why without Christ I don't care what the world wants to uh do about the end time and what is going to happen to the earth and the Great Tribulation that's coming and how the Earth is you know they they talk about uh you know that it's going to be a a a weather event it's going to be earthquakes it's going to be that the Earth is going to no they need to know that it's all based on the prophecy of God's word and that there's only one way to Salvation and that is through Jesus Christ everything in the Old Testament was talking about Jesus Christ the Messiah that would come to take away the sins of the world the reason why they had to use the the the blood of of bulls and and goats and and and sheep on the altar was because the the of the original sin being a blood sin amen but Jesus Christ would reverse that curse by his blood not by human blood but the by the blood of God and that's why without the blood of Jesus Christ without Calvary there is no salvation amen all that were under the Old Testament all that were under the of the law of the Old Testament they had to use a a a blood sacrifice to cover their sin but when Christ the Messiah came he abolished all of that amen and he went directly to The Mercy Seat like we were talking about on Wednesday night and he's he was on The Mercy Seat making intercession now for the Gentile seven Church ages amen amen praise God all those that were under the blood all those that were that were that were using blood sacrifice in the Old Testament when Christ came he abolished the need for the blood of bulls and goats and those people don't need intercession anymore because he made the ultimate sacrifice and they're already dead they don't need intercession but through the seven Church ages there was intercession required until the coming of the Lord the second coming of the Lord which took place in 1963 and that's why in 1963 he could leave The Mercy Seat he could leave because he he was the lamb that took the book amen praise God he was the one that took the the the book of redemption he was Seated on the throne making intercession for all those seven Church ages right up until Pentecost amen but right when Pentecost and and God sent the seventh angel messenger and that messenger under the anointing of the spirit of God was given the commission to go back to Jeffersonville that the Seven Seals were going to be opened and the Mystery of God was going to be revealed that was the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and people that don't recognize that coming to this day are going to miss everything and everything that they're doing all the teachings that they're giving in the churches they can try to figure out the Book of Revelation they'll never do it because it's only by faith it has to be revealed by faith amen praise God you got to know how to approach God you've got to be ordained of God from before the foundations of the world to be able to receive the pure unadulterated word of God for this day and this hour which gives you the birth amen the only way you can get the birth in order to to be a trans ated in the Rapture is to receive the word for this day and the word for this day is Christ hallelujah praise God forever more amen so the mediator up until right up until the seventh age God had men that he would have to anoint with the word of God for that particular day and that's why when you go back and you study the seven Church ages you you'll see that there was seven Messengers that God had to anoint in order to break them from their Traditions to to to escape the the the the the seed of the serpent the the the the the the the seed the the the mark of the beast because the mark of the beast was actually to to get the people to disbelieve Christ that's what the mark of the beast is that's why in ad 325 when when they had the the the nian council meeting what what what did the Catholic church do they injected their own interpretation on the word and they started to take away the deity of God the moment you pull the deity of God out of the scriptures you don't know who you're serving you know not who God is you don't know who you're going to where where you're going to receive your F your your salvation from is it going to come from God the Father is it going to come from the son or is it going to come from the Holy Ghost which one you see if you don't know the very foundations of the word of God that God is one you're lost right from that point on Hallelujah so every mediator that God sent through these Messengers amen they could only receive a portion of the word not the fullness of the word because God was in a state of reformation God was restoring the word that's why if the corn of wheat didn't die there would be no Resurrection there would be no Holy Ghost remember God Jesus Christ was not the son of Joseph and Mary no sir we're going to be looking at that this is the this is the the the the whole element that that we want to bring forth here Jesus Christ was the blood of God he was seed male female both both seed and egg came together and it was God and it was placed in the womb of Mary amen praise God and she had the right kind of Faith glory to God Amen and so there was there there wasn't a perfect word restored yet and that's why this battle that's still going on between these two Spirits amen they still go on to this day it's a fight it's a constant fight the battle is within you and sometimes right within your own church because that's where the enemy is going to deceive how could it be so deceiving that it would be uh that it would deceive the very elect if if it were possible it's going to have to look just like the real thing yes amen praise God hallelujah and so Christ knowing that that that each messenger would only have a portion he knew that the people through those ages would still continue in sin like Luther he broke away from the Catholic Church by justification but yet he was still smoking he was still drinking there was no there was no uh you know sanctification so the Christ was Seated on The Mercy Seat making intercession for our our ignorant sin sins of ignorance like we said on Wednesday that back in the Old Testament the The Book of Numbers a high priest would go Before the Throne make a sacrifice for the ignorance of the people for the sins of ignorance that they didn't know what they that they were sinning and that's what was going on all the way through those seven Church ages but then when Christ who took the book and and left the throne in 1963 because in Revelations 10: 1-7 it said that a mighty angel came down put one foot on the sea and one foot on the land and he had in his right hand a book that was open amen he had left the throne because if you look at the seventh seal all it says there there was a half hour of Silence amen because now he was coming down to to to put it all together Amen to bring forth the fullness of the word to unite with a perfect virgin born church that would not be be uh uh injected with man's interpretation she would not receive man's doctrines amen praise God he was now coming down to unite with that church for his Redemption time had come amen and that's the hour that we're in we're in the hour of complete and total Redemption of the Sons and Daughters of God being restored right back to the way we should have been before the fall amen praise God listen here so Christ now the atonement and this is important you need to see this the atonement now that's why all the churches out there until they come to realize because they're still waiting on the coming of the lord they're still waiting for him to come into the clouds and they're going to see him and they figure that their bodies are going to rise up to meet him in the air in his coming he's already come and the reason why he came was so that now he could possess a bride amen possess a church and that church now becomes his voice becomes his feet his arms his his his mercy seat so if people want to know now that you know you talk to people and they're they're talking about Christianity they they believe in Christianity they want to know about the Lord but they don't realize that he's left The Mercy Seat he's no longer making intercession for the denomination he's making intercession now for that last one he's looking for that last one and the only place where intercession and atonement can now be found is in the true church for the word of God for this hour Hallelujah she's Anointed with the word she realizes who she is she's come into a place of of deity she realizes now that that there's only one way that that that salvation can be found and that is not by by joining a church it's by receiving the Holy Ghost the word of God for your day in this hour amen we're not talking about baptism of Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll do things for you oh yeah it'll set you free in areas it'll heal you but baptism is not enough amen baptism was only to bring this this sinful nature Under The Obedience of God's word so that it could draw your attention he said I will send you the comforter who which is the Holy Ghost and he will do what guide you back to truth because it's the truth that's going to give you a body change it's not going to be some teaching of man it's going to be the ultimate word the truth the the the the absolute Supernatural transforming power if this spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you it'll Quicken you it'll translate you out of your unbelief we're not looking for baptisms of the Holy Ghost anymore did that under Pentecost but the Holy Ghost the baptisms of the Holy Ghost were for one purpose so that the baptism could introduce you to The Giver Hallelujah glory to God The Giver of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's got to bring you into that contact that Unity that invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen so he goes on to say here in our in our uh next quote he says that's what the church is doing today for Jesus is the word and he is the bridegroom now pay attention and the bride is part of the groom so therefore the word that is to be fulfilled this day is the same part of the word that was fulfilled in his day am Adam and Eve you see word upon word amen glory to God now pay attention he says here same word same experience same life for when God separated Adam he was both we find out Adam was Spirit to begin with he made man in his own image created he male and female and then in Genesis chter 2 and on he created man out of the dust of the earth Man was created in God's image God is a spirit so when Adam was in the in the image of God before God took of the Dust of the earth he was male and female it was Adam and Eve he called their name Adam they had supreme authority and it was God Amen it was God expressed in human flesh amen out of the D so he's a spirit man then when he become flesh man animal Flesh on the earth he is he is showing portraying here the bride oh my it was not until after the dust of the earth that he created himself a body that the woman Eve actually comes on the scene the bride the female aspect of himself it's it's himself amen and that was that's portraying here the bride he never taken and made another being but he took part of Adam the original creation took from him a rib from his side and took what the feminist Spirit out of Adam left the masculine spirit in there and placed it in the feminis part therefore part of his Spirit part of his body flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word life of his life and that's the way the bride is to Christ thank you Jesus do you see it so this is not just joining church this is not just being you know able to keep all the scripture all the listen I'll tell you there's people out there in the in the denominational churches that can live holier than you they can keep the law much better than you because they figure that their salvation is based on the law like the seven-day Adventist you talk to them they tell you oh you don't keep the Sabbath you're going to hell you're not you're you're you broke the law of the Commandment that thou shalt not do anything on the Sabbath day and that's why to this day they still believe that that that by keeping the Sabbath they're entitled to Salvation when Jesus Christ Christ himself rebuked them and said I am the Sabbath I'm the reason why there is a Sabbath I'm the purpose of the Sabbath glory to God Amen praise God and so here now we come to realize that that they don't understand that the word has been fulfilled in our day by the opening of The Seven Seals and the importance of that and that's really that's the message that that of the hour for us me as a minister you know I I go to studying and I I say Lord you know there there could still be one or two or we don't know how many you've got your you said all that the father hath given me will come we don't know where they are there still could be some that are still you know uh you know under some denominational teaching so when we bring the word of God we've got to bring it in such a way that there there's some Simplicity because really it is simple this word we should not make it complicated because it was revealed to to babes such as these it's actually hidden from the wise and The Prudent Jesus himself said that these scriptures no matter how much they see it they could have eyes to see but they don't see they have ears to hear but they don't hear but he says but unto you he's talking personal he's talking individuals he's talking election amen unto you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom and that's why when we talk about the mystery of the of the seventh seal and the opening of the word it's it's it it it means something to us because we' we've crossed over we've crossed that Chasm of time when the angel came he said time shall be no more amen we're no longer under the the the the the time of of leoda we are in leoda but we are actually in a bride age we've crossed over into the supernatural bride age where the word of God now has become a reality to you personal amen praise God hallelujah and so here now let's read our next scripture we're going to try to we we're only going to get so far today there's there's so much more here now brethren in Galatians 4 28-31 now we brethren Isaac was are the children of Promise we're the children of promise okay you got to understand that we're not the children of the flesh there's the children of unbelief which was Ishmael then there was Children of the flesh which was through Isaac which produced Israel okay Church natural we are of the promised seed we're not of any of those seeds we of the promised seed which was Christ remember that that's the three aspects Church unbelief Church natural Church spiritual amen brings us to where we are but as then he that he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so is it now we are struggling against this Same Spirit and we will struggle with it until we are changed out of this Dimension that's why you're going to have to overcome that's why to this to to to those that overcome in this age will I grant to sit with me in the throne what is the throne the throne is the place of authority the throne is a place where God rules and what happens after the Great Tribulation we go into 1,000 year Millennial peace amen and where do the Sons and Daughters of God go to rule with him on the throne amen so we need to see okay nevertheless what sayith the scripture cast out the bonds woman and her son for the son of the bondswoman shall not be air with the son of the free woman so then brethren we are not children of the Bond woman we we are of the free amen because of the because Sarah by faith okay Sarah by faith received the strength in her body to bring forth Isaac but it still came through sex which was the original sin and therefore it only brought Church natural based on a promise that God had given Abraham that his seed would would would multiply and and be blessed and would be God's chosen people on the Earth he even blessed Ishmael and ishmael's people became more than the children of the free woman as we've heard amen praise God and so here now let's move along here because I want to get to a certain place now now listen here next slide he says hold on he says oh word Believers give my message now hang on go back go back sorry I'm one step ahead here I've got to go to my notes so here now now we Brethren as Isaac okay we read that okay so this is a type that's being fulfilled in the church today and even in our own flesh like we were saying this struggle between the bonds woman and the free woman and you as a Believer are going to struggle with this this this struggle and and especially now even more so as we come to the very end of the end time to where the struggle now is Right within the womb of the message of the hour because remember we're way down the road if there's elected seed somewhere out there in the denominations then they're going to need to hear the word of God they're going to need to respond to the word of God and they will come to this Revelation if they are Sons and Daughters of God that were in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundations of the world they got to come to this they can't miss it there's no way that they can miss it but this is the very meaning of of of what Christ is doing in this day and in this hour that he's trying to show himself in a people that have received the word for their day that it's actually him in them it's the very essence and the Very meaning of of what Christ is trying to reveal through the message of this hour amen and so it means that God's seed or word has to be in us if we're able to respond you could never respond to this message and be set free unless there was an elected seed attribute of God in you because we live by faith living by when you live by the law it it actually doesn't allow Revelation to come into your life the moment that you're constantly oh you got to do this you got to do that you can't do this you can't do that you're actually you're you're you're you're shutting out the ability to receive Revelation which comes by Grace so you need to settle down you need to allow the Holy Spirit to to speak to you you know amen the Lord was always very clear in scripture when he said the promise word would be would be to whom the promis word would go to the promised seed amen and the promised seed is Christ and that he would come forth to bring forth a bride in his very image so the promise of Salvation can never come by the law it has to come by the word by Grace amen amen you can't get it any other way but you know what people they seem to feel a lot safer when they're under the law because they know they can't do this and they know they can't do that and that's why like we were saying last week our children cannot be brought up under that kind of of constant you know School Master yes the school Master when you first came to the message you came under the school Master you were you were uh you know all of a sudden because you were like a pagan you were wild you were out of control you know you come to the Lord and you come to realize my God there's unbelief everywhere around you and so God had to use the school master and the teaching of the law to bring order into your life but your salvation and your relationship does not come by law you can never be saved by the law the law will only punish you if all you want is law then you and and if all you're doing is placing that on your children and placing that in your ministry and placing it upon the people then you're constantly having to punish and and and that's not the word for this hour no sir amen glory to God that's the same way as as bringing organization into the church and we're not interested in organizing because that's the mark of the beast the moment that they organize and try to take the word and organize the word it brings it under under the mark of the beast it brings it under the teachings of man and they're trying to do it even in this message amen how do they do it in this message you know they they they say well it's it's safe to only say what the prophet said even if you don't have a revelation of what the prophet said just say what the prophet said well in the beginning when you come in under the school master and you're listening to the messages yes you're you're you're to you're to hearken to it because it's God actually delivering you it's it's God bringing the Holy Ghost into your life because remember the message of the hour is the Holy Ghost and when it comes into your life it starts to purge your life starts to clean your life starts to deal with all the unbelief in your life starts to set you free from all the things but the moment that you make brother brandom the prophet the absolute instead of the word as your absolute where do you end up you end up maybe under a seven Thunder Doctrine or you end up the seal the seven seal is not open or you end up to where oh no no no I don't need to go to a church I don't need to be under the leadership of a pastor I can make voice of God my pastor yeah you could there's people that legitimately can do that and it's because of where they are or whatever but until God raises up a minister or a five-fold Ministry where you can go and receive the word for the perfecting of the Saints that's perfectly fine but God is always going to make a way according to his word amen and so you cannot make William brandham the absolute it's like making Martin Luther the absolute or making John Wesley the absolute or saying oh it all it all finished up in Pentecost all we need to do is go back to Pentecost all you need is the evidence of the Holy Ghost is to speak in tongues or to have healings we're not going back to p Pentecost Pentecost is Leo deia There's No Redemption there there's no atonement there there's no Revelation there it's all the teachings and the doctrines of man and they've gotten so far away from the word of God they don't know that they've made the word of God of none effect hallelujah we're moving forward Saints we don't want we don't want to organize this message God is is not looking to organize this message the holy spirit is coming to a church that's why when Jesus Christ you know let's read on here I don't want to get ahead of myself amen why does the scriptures tell us that Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse because he took everything that was the sin that was the result of the law that man would fall into sin and unbelief he took it all to the cross so that he could make that ultimate sacrifice so that you don't have to live by the law anymore I'm not talking about living you know disgracefully either but we're free we should be living free we are children of the free amen amen we're not under the bondage of of the law where where everything is do do and don'ts if you don't do this then this is going to happen if you don't do that no what's listen what about the relationship what about the the the reality of God in your life becoming personal to you to where you can go through situations and you can see him moving in your life amen praise God hallelujah listen because of the original sin we have a carnal nature that's on us and that carnal nature is going to be your enemy it's going to fight you until the Holy Ghost brings it under full obedience to the word of God Amen and that's why you need to assemble that's why you need to feed on the word of God that's why you need to know what it is that that you're actually feeding on you need to go back recognize the day that scripture has been fulfilled realize that the seals have been opened why was what was the purpose of the opening of those seals the purpose was so that Redemption could be completed so that Redemption could be done and and and so that the church that that's been talked about that I will restore sayeth the Lord all of that had to take place in order to bring us to where we are right now amen praise God and so we need to understand you know uh what law and and and Liberty is you know Cain was was law Faith was able Abel expressed Faith Cain expressed thew serving and and worshiping God God all by law and all by rules and by Beauty and by his own interpretation we're not to interpret the word or put our own private interpretation on the word of God Amen praise God message Believers that are living now under the law thinking that they're free but they're actually under law because they're taking the prophet they're taking his message they're making it an absolute they're making it a Doctrine they're allowing the people to to to only you know like you know you hear testimonies and the testimonies are a result of someone listening to the tapes only and they glorify that now don't get me wrong I've been blessed and and healed and God spoke to me and still speaks to me through those tapes I will never say that that that the that the voice of God doesn't still speak the voice can speak through anyone the voice of God is Not Just bottled up into tapes the voice of God is a living God that's present in a five-fold Ministry in you and in me if you've received the pure and adulterated word of God for this hour then he's in you amen praise God hallelujah we just can't go any further here because now we're going to we're we're going to go in so we're going to have to wait until the next time let the musicians come I said we would be finished by 12:30 amen praise God but Saints this revelation of who God is actually coming to in this hour and who he's unveiling himself to and why he requires pure now I'm not talking about pure lives you can never live perfect don't even think for one minute that you can live perfect that's why he went to the Cross to bring sin and nailed it to the Cross you can't be perfect but there is a perfect word which is Jesus Christ and he wants to come and dwell in you he wants you to know that you know who you are so that you will not come under the bondage of the bondswoman the nature of Ishmael the nature that Cain injected into Eve we're going to be looking at all of that the next time we come together and we're going to be looking at the reason and the purpose why God had to come to a virgin why it was that he went to the Virgin Mary there was something in the virgin Mary that that that that would that would be required in order to bring forth Jesus Christ the the the the pure word the pure sacrifice the ultimate Perfection of God's word come now into you and me as the Sons and Daughters of God Amen praise God God bless you brother Anthony I'm going to hand it over to you and a couple of songs and uh please enjoy the play that they've

our very own Sunday school children they have been so dedicated and committed the play is about the greatest gift which is the gift of Salvation and this is what they wish to convey in their message and in display and hopefully it is a blessing to each and every one of you and again we are so proud of everyone who have dedicated your time and countless hours despite everything the obstacles that came in their way with flu and traveling and everything it has been a little bit delayed in timing but nevertheless I am proud to present God's lambs of Good Neighbor Ministries e e so what do you think Miss John mon to do for this holiday project build a snowman at a math homework no Liam she said it had to something meaningful for Christmas not another excuse for you to slack off we could build a big gingerbread house ever like one so big we can actually live in it that's preposterous do you even know how much gingerbread that would take the structural Integrity alone relax Aiden he's dreaming big it's Christmas me I'd vote for something practical like a giant Christmas Pizza because nothing says Christmas spirit like a greasy slice of pepperon can we make it with candy canes that' be the coolest pizza ever candy Cates are cute Ethan but she said had to be something meaningful actually what if we did something to help people like collecting toys clothes for families who may not have much this Christmas I could build my I could build my my favorite truck it still looks new even I played with it a lot that's a great idea Ethan giving something you love is a great way to show kindness and we it's like being little angels can be dress up too I'd be the Archangel Michael I bet he have the biggest Wing is a huge sword big guy huge sword totally my body that that's a nice idea but what would we call it the charity drive of Awesomeness that's not bad but let's have a name that's about something deeper it should represent the true meaning of Christmas what do you mean something deeper are you saying Christmas isn't just about getting presents nope it's about giving love and the greatest gift of all you mean a unicorn no she beats Jesus exactly Jesus coming down to earth to be our savior is that is the greatest gift because God gave gifts to the world giving is a great way to show God's love so no unicorns then absolutely no unicorns we can focus on helping others by collecting toys clothes and food for families and shelters and by giving to food banks oh I love it we can wrap up everything in pretty paper and make cards too so collect items wrap them up and deliver them I'll make the spread sheets for the assignments wow Aiden you really know how to take the fun out of fundraiser that's a great idea Aiden let's call it the greatest gift project that's perfect because it's exactly what God did for us he gave himself as the greatest gift to show his love fine but I'm still dressing up as Archangel Michael I want that huge sword as long as you don't eat all the donations Liam hey I only did that once sounds like you all came up with something amazing care to share we're calling it the greatest gift project it's a way of giving for those in need and the way of showing God's love I love it excellent idea children and we all know that our Salvation through the Lord Jesus Christ is the greatest gift ever I'm excited let's get to work his J [Music] you J PR e e e e survive Christmas without EA the gingerbread ornaments okay barely but I still deserve a medal or a plaque that says Liam resisted sugar for 12 days probably more like 12 hours speaking of Christmas wasn't the greatest gift project amazing I still can't believe how much we collected my TR is one of those boxes do you think the kid who got it liked it I'm sure they did Ethan you probably made their whole Christmas I've got the number we donated over 50 toys 30 coats and enough canned food to stock an entire pantry and here I thought spreadsheets were boring whoa that's a lot we're like superheroes exactly super Liam saves a day one canned Peach at a time hey it's not just about the stuff we gave it was all the people we met all the families were so happy to receive our packages I could still remember the look on their faces they were totally in awe I didn't think it was theoretically possible for someone to open their mouth that wide seriously though I think about why we did this project to begin with to show God's love and to spread Sparkles and happiness not everything needs Sparkles Ethan says the guy who labeled the donation bins with glitter pens glitter pens areac Aiden said they're easy to read Aiden said it worked didn't it you both did great everyone did you know it wasn't just about giving I learned a lot too like what I mean I learned all the blessings I take for granted and I mean I have so much I wasn't able to help those who didn't even have warm socks me too I thought Christmas was about what I can get now it's even more meaningful the more I can GI I learned that I'm a natural packing gift boxes seriously my bows work perfect don't fush it Liam I learned that the best gifts isn't about what we can buy at the store but how we can show God's love in actions and words I think I learned that even little things matter a small gift can make a big difference wow Aiden that was almost deep don't get used to it good morning kids good morning Johnson happy New Year Mrs johnon children I've been getting amazing feedback from the community about our project and look I have a huge thank you from the shelter be read it okay dear students your kindness brought so much joy to our family Christmas the gifts food and clothes you provided made a huge difference thank you for being perfect examples of the true gift of Christmas that's amazing you should all be very proud of yourself what you did wasn't just a project it was a Ministry a practical way to show God's love and you succeeded does this mean he get we'll see a but you also get something even better the knowledge that you made a real difference in somebody's life and we can never put a grd on that how about award certificate can we get that maybe Aiden but now let's take a chance to reflect what's one thing you'll carry with you from this experience that love is the greatest gift we can give yeah even small act of kindness can have real impact to change someone life that glitter pen glitter pens do have their place and that I'm a gift wrapping Legend's of next time we'll collect double the donations 100% increase oh boy here we go again [Applause] e e oh that was wonderful let's get the [Applause] behind let's sing one more song before we leave um sing that same song we will work till Jesus come we will work till Jesus come we will work Jesus come we will [Music] work oh we will World till Jesus come in World till Jesus come we will work till Jesus come and GA his home Oh Land of rest for the I I went will the moment come [Music] when I shall lay my arm by and dwell in peace and hope oh we will work till Jesus come we will work till Jesus come we will work till Jesus come and heart is whole oh we will work till Jesus you are dismissed word [Music]
