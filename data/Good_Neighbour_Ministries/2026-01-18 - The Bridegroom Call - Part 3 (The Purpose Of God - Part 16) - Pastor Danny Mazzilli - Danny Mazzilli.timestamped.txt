[44:10] the sh [singing]
[44:13] I will see
[1:01:55] seventh angel's message.
[1:01:58] This is the age where where where the
[1:02:01] mighty angel himself has come down
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; who came down in 1963
[1:02:08] whom brother Branham under the under the
[1:02:11] the the ministry under the word that he
[1:02:14] was the light of that particular day to
[1:02:17] manifest Revelations 10:7 Seven.
[1:02:51] It's not the voice OF OF WILLIAM
[1:02:54] BRANHAM. IT'S NOT THE VOICE OF A
[1:02:56] PROPHET. IT'S THE VOICE OF GOD.
[1:03:00] IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE VOICE OF GOD.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESUS.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; IT'S ALWAYS BEEN HIS VOICE.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; If you WILL HEAR HIS VOICE, HARDEN NOT
[1:03:09] YOUR HEARTS.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; You've got to recognize the day, the
[1:03:14] season, the hour, the word for your day.
[1:03:17] Otherwise, you're going to fall under a
[1:03:19] a another dispensation, and you will not
[1:03:22] have been birthed
[1:03:24] into the dispensation
[1:03:26] of this hour. Amen. Praise God.
[1:03:29] Hallelujah. THE PRESENT TRUTH BY THE
[1:03:32] MESSAGE OF THE hour is what we
[1:03:35] recognize.
[1:03:37] Here we read this quote. Now remember,
[1:03:39] you can put it up there. Number eight,
[1:03:41] he says, "Now remember that was not
[1:03:43] Jesus talking to Abraham there that
[1:03:46] could discern the thoughts in Sarah's
[1:03:47] mind behind him. That was not Jesus. He
[1:03:50] had not yet been born. But it was a man
[1:03:53] in human flesh that Abraham called
[1:03:56] Elohim, the all the the great Almighty.
[1:04:00] THAT WAS GOD SHOWING HIMSELF BACK there
[1:04:03] in in in Melzdc what he was going to be
[1:04:06] doing right here
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; when he when he showed himself to
[1:04:11] Abraham. Amen.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; And showing and Jesus said, "As it was
[1:04:15] in the days of Sodom," now watch close.
[1:04:17] in the days of Sodom. So will it be at
[1:04:20] the coming of the Son of Man when the
[1:04:22] Son of Man is being revealed. Not no
[1:04:25] more as a church.
[1:04:27] Not no more. He says the bride is
[1:04:30] called.
[1:04:32] This is now where the mighty angel comes
[1:04:35] down to call the bride, to call her
[1:04:39] name, to bring her out of her amnesia.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. to recognize in that day the son
[1:04:47] of man will be revealed what to join the
[1:04:50] church to the head unite the marriage of
[1:04:54] the bride and so for the last 63
[1:04:59] years or so
[1:05:02] there's been an invisible union that's
[1:05:04] been taking place and the bride is
[1:05:08] already united with him
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; people want to place it into a future
[1:05:14] tense EVENT, BUT IT'S ALREADY NOW. IT'S
[1:05:17] ALREADY HAPPENED. AND YOU KNOW, IF
[1:05:18] YOU'VE united with the with the groom,
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT UNDER CONFUSION. YOU'RE NOT
[1:05:24] WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN IN the
[1:05:26] future. It's already in progress. You're
[1:05:29] already married. YOU'RE ALREADY SHUT IN.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT'S THE FOOLISH VIRGIN
[1:05:36] that's confused THAT ARE KNOCKING THAT
[1:05:38] ARE CONSTANTLY KNOCKING. AND WHAT WHAT
[1:05:41] ARE THEY DOING? THEY'RE THEY'RE KNOCKING
[1:05:43] IN A PLACE WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO GET
[1:05:45] ANSWERS. THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
[1:05:46] WHY THEY'RE IN THE CONDITION THAT
[1:05:48] THEY'RE IN, WHY THEY'RE NOT FULLY UH
[1:05:50] SATISFIED, WHY THEY'RE NOT UH YIELDED,
[1:05:53] WHY THEY FIND THEMSELVES JUMPING FROM
[1:05:55] church to church, NOT NOT RECOGNIZING
[1:05:58] THAT THAT THAT THE THAT THE MIGHTY ANGEL
[1:06:01] HAS AN order
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; for the body to come in and be led by by
[1:06:07] the five-fold ministry of this hour.
[1:06:09] AMEN. AMEN.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS an order.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. All the previous seven
[1:06:17] church ages called out bride in every
[1:06:19] SINGLE AGE.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; BUT THIS IS the age WHERE THE FULL SEVEN
[1:06:24] course meal is made available.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; The bride now unites with THE GROOM AND
[1:06:30] SHE BECOMES HIS VOICE.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; She becomes and and and she she gets
[1:06:35] placed into a place of authority.
[1:06:39] Too many people are afraid of that.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; NOT WILLING TO TAKE THAT POSITION.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. But we need to understand
[1:06:49] that that the message that came forth
[1:06:53] under every one of those seven church
[1:06:55] age dispensations, the messengers that
[1:06:58] came to each of those ages, they died
[1:07:02] along with the people that had TO DIE
[1:07:05] UNDER THOSE AGES. THIS is the only age
[1:07:09] where the word is brought forth, where
[1:07:12] the uniting IS TO BRING FORTH A BODY
[1:07:15] CHANGE,
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; it's going to it's going to translate us
[1:07:19] into the ceremony,
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; into the MARRIAGE SUPPER.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Praise God. THIS IS WHERE
[1:07:26] THE MIGHTY ANGEL COMES DOWN in
[1:07:28] Revelations 10:1-7 and says, "Time shall
[1:07:32] be no more." Amen.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, we're not DEALING IN
[1:07:37] TIME ANYMORE.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; YES, BUT WE'RE still in time. Of course,
[1:07:41] we're still in time. So, what did he
[1:07:43] mean by that?
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT WHAT DID HE MEAN THAT TIME
[1:07:46] SHALL BE NO MORE?
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WELL, let's see what it says in
[1:07:50] Ephesians 1:es 9 to11. Next slide. He
[1:07:53] says, "Having made known unto us." SO,
[1:07:56] HERE IT IS NOW. He's he's letting us
[1:07:59] know these are mysteries THAT THAT WERE
[1:08:02] LOCKED UP IN THE WORD OF GOD. BUT THE
[1:08:04] OPENING OF THOSE SEALS RELEASED and
[1:08:06] opened all the mysteries.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; There's no more mysteries.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; The mystery of God is finished.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; It's it's there's nothing else THAT
[1:08:16] NEEDS TO BE DONE OTHER THAN FOR IT TO
[1:08:18] MANIFEST.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S BEEN REVEALED.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; THE MYSTERYY'S been revealed.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; THE MYSTERY OF THE BOOK HAS BEEN OPEN.
[1:08:27] BUT WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST FOR THIS AGE,
[1:08:30] UNDER THIS DISPENSATION, YOU CAN'T
[1:08:32] interpret it.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Do you know that those that were in the
[1:08:37] previous ages could not receive this?
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Luther could not receive
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; this revelation.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; It it would IT WOULD HAVE BLOWN UP ON
[1:08:48] HIM BECAUSE IT WASN'T the time.
[1:08:52] BUT THERE'S A PARTICULAR TIME AND season
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; for attributes of God that are ordained
[1:08:57] for that particular time
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; to to be able to receive that portion of
[1:09:02] the word because she GETS AN ANOINTING
[1:09:05] BY THE HOLY GHOST TO OVERCOME THE AGE OF
[1:09:08] DECEPTION THAT she's in.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you couldn't even handle it.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; You're ordained to handle it. YOU'RE
[1:09:19] PREDESTINATED UNTO THIS. HE SAW THAT YOU
[1:09:22] COULD RECEIVE this word.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. But look, HE SAYS HERE, HAVING
[1:09:26] MADE KNOWN UNTO US THE MYSTERY OF HIS
[1:09:28] WILL, according to his good pleasure,
[1:09:31] which he had purposed in himself, that
[1:09:33] in the, now pay attention, that in the
[1:09:35] dispensation of the fullness of times,
[1:09:40] this is the age where the fullness of
[1:09:42] times, in other words, when you look at
[1:09:45] times, he might gather together. It
[1:09:47] talks about dispensation of the fullness
[1:09:50] of times.
[1:09:53] dispensations. ALL THE DISPENSATIONS,
[1:09:55] THEY COME into this dispensation.
[1:09:58] They all fall under this this TIME AND
[1:10:02] SEASON WHERE TIME SHALL be no more.
[1:10:05] Where we go from time back to eternity.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; We move from this because listen, the
[1:10:12] next stage for the church, there's no
[1:10:14] more church ages.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; There's no more preaching after this.
[1:10:19] THERE'S NO MORE. LISTEN, THIS IS THE
[1:10:21] FINAL VOICE TO THE FINAL AGE.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOING TO BE NO OTHER WORD WHERE
[1:10:26] people are going to SAY, "WELL, IF I
[1:10:27] MISSED IT LAST TIME, MAYBE I CAN CATCH
[1:10:29] IT THIS TIME." NO, SIR.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; The foolish virgin IS KNOCKING AT THE
[1:10:33] DOOR, BUT IT'S ALREADY UNITED. SHE'S
[1:10:36] ALREADY UNITED with the groom.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; She recognizes THAT THE NEXT STAGE IS
[1:10:41] GOING TO BE A CHANGE.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; SHE REALIZES THAT SHE'S GOING TO HER
[1:10:45] ETERNAL BODY. THANK YOU, LORD.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; SHE REALIZES THAT THE NEXT STAGE IS HER
[1:10:49] THEOPHONY.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO MORE EARTHLY MINISTRY. TIME
[1:10:54] SHALL BE no more to the BRIDE OF CHRIST.
[1:10:56] WHY? BECAUSE FROM here we go to our
[1:10:59] theophony. WE COME BACK in eternal
[1:11:03] bodies
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; to reign and rule with CHRIST FOR A
[1:11:07] THOUSAND YEARS. ARE YOU UNDER TIME?
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; NO, you're not under time anymore.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. This is where the
[1:11:13] fullness of time where all THE
[1:11:15] DISPENSATIONS GET LOCKED up into the
[1:11:18] bride of Jesus Christ and she moves into
[1:11:21] her her her her eternal destination who
[1:11:25] she always was. Amen. Now look, he says
[1:11:29] that he might that that in the
[1:11:31] dispensation of the fullness of times
[1:11:34] plural, he might gather TOGETHER IN ONE
[1:11:37] ALL things in Christ, both which are in
[1:11:40] heaven and which are on earth, even in
[1:11:44] him,
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; in whom also we have obtained an
[1:11:48] inheritance,
[1:11:50] being predestinated according to the
[1:11:52] purpose of him who workketh all things
[1:11:55] after THE COUNSEL OF HIS OWN WILL. WHAT
[1:11:57] IS THAT INHERITANCE, SAINTS?
[1:11:59] It's not an earthly inheritance.
[1:12:02] It's not SOMETHING HERE THAT YES, he's
[1:12:04] going to bless you. Yes, he's going to
[1:12:06] give you houses. He's going to give you
[1:12:08] lands. He's going to provide your needs.
[1:12:10] But that's not your inheritance. YOUR
[1:12:12] INHERITANCE IS A THEOPHONY.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; IT'S WHAT YOU'VE BEEN ORDAINED. IT'S
[1:12:17] WHAT YOU HAD. IT'S WHAT YOU WERE. IT'S
[1:12:20] WHAT YOU bypassed
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; in the beginning. That was the great
[1:12:25] deception. Amen. Praise God. So, this
[1:12:28] has been going on SINCE BROTHER
[1:12:31] BRANDHAM, WHO was the seven earthly
[1:12:33] angel, son of man, a son of man
[1:12:36] ministry,
[1:12:38] revealing the son of man himself.
[1:12:42] And that's what gets people all
[1:12:44] confused. That's why even to this day,
[1:12:46] you got people that worship William
[1:12:48] Branham.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; They worship brother Brandham like he's
[1:12:51] God. THEY PRAY TO HIM. THEY HAVE
[1:12:54] SERVICES where if somebody's going to
[1:12:56] dedicate a child or get married, they
[1:12:59] will have brother Brandham officiated
[1:13:02] through one of his previous messages.
[1:13:06] They're living under a dispensation
[1:13:09] WHERE WHERE WHERE THEY'VE ACTUALLY PUT
[1:13:11] CHRIST OUT OF THE CHURCH. AND HE'S
[1:13:12] SITTING BACK AND HE'S LOOKING. He's
[1:13:14] going, "I'm here.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; I'm here.
[1:13:21] What are you doing?
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A son of man revealing the
[1:13:28] son of man. BUT BECAUSE THEY SAW SO MUCH
[1:13:30] supernatural in his life, they got
[1:13:33] distracted by the flash of the
[1:13:36] supernatural.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; And do you notice that today you don't
[1:13:41] see a lot of that?
[1:13:43] You don't see the pillar of fire showing
[1:13:45] up into the services. You don't see the
[1:13:47] the the the the pillar of cloud. You
[1:13:50] don't like I'm not saying it doesn't
[1:13:52] happen. It may happen in certain places.
[1:13:54] You don't see the the the the
[1:13:56] supernatural miracles like like we did
[1:13:59] when William when brother Brandham was
[1:14:00] on the earth.
[1:14:02] There was miracle after miracle and
[1:14:04] people that witnessed it that are even
[1:14:06] still alive to this day. They they can't
[1:14:08] get away from it and they're and they're
[1:14:10] distracted by it.
[1:14:13] But that's not the attraction to the
[1:14:17] bride in this hour.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; SHE'S NEVER BEEN ATTRACTED TO THE
[1:14:23] MESSENGER.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; She She HEARS THE VOICE OF GOD COMING
[1:14:27] THROUGH THE MESSENGER under the Listen,
[1:14:30] I love his voice. I love Brother
[1:14:32] Brandham's voice. I love listening to
[1:14:34] the tapes and I do every single day. But
[1:14:38] I'm hearing the voice of my beloved.
[1:14:42] THAT'S WHAT'S EXCITING MY SOUL. THAT'S
[1:14:44] WHAT'S GIVEN ME STRENGTH TO OVERCOME IN
[1:14:46] this age.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST BY HEARING HIS VOICE. IT'S
[1:14:50] BY HEARING THE VOICE OF GOD.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Speaks to me in my heart reveals HIMSELF
[1:14:55] TO ME IN THE SAME WAY he revealed
[1:14:57] himself to the prophet. Amen.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Look, it was AN INVISIBLE UNION. BUT
[1:15:02] LISTEN to brother Brandham here. He's
[1:15:03] speaking here in in proving his word. He
[1:15:06] says the bridegroom call will come right
[1:15:09] through this when the son of man will
[1:15:11] come down and come in human flesh to
[1:15:14] unite the two together. The church has
[1:15:18] to be the word.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; He is the word and the two unites
[1:15:23] together. AND TO DO THAT it'll take the
[1:15:25] manifestation of the revealing of the
[1:15:29] son of man. It'll take Christ himself to
[1:15:33] come personal to each and every one of
[1:15:36] you.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not a clergyman. Do you see what I
[1:15:40] mean? He says, "See, the son of man,
[1:15:42] Jesus Christ, will come down in human
[1:15:45] flesh among us and will make his word so
[1:15:48] real that it'll unite the church and him
[1:15:52] as one, the bride, and then she'll go to
[1:15:55] the wedding supper." Amen.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Next slide. She's already united.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; She's already united. Amen. You see, he
[1:16:06] says WE GO TO THE WEDDING SUPPER, not
[1:16:08] the marriage. The marriage has already
[1:16:10] taken place in the invisible union.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; IT'S SAID AND DONE. WE GATHER here today
[1:16:15] because we identify with Christ as our
[1:16:18] groom. Amen. THAT HE'S HE'S OUR HEAD.
[1:16:21] HE'S OUR he's our our leadership in this
[1:16:24] day and in this hour. And we KNOW THAT
[1:16:25] THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO MAKE
[1:16:27] IT THROUGH THIS AGE. AMEN.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; No other way will we make it through.
[1:16:31] Amen. She's already he says of of of
[1:16:35] flesh and body because the marriage of
[1:16:36] the lamb has come. But the rapture is
[1:16:40] going to the wedding supper. When the
[1:16:42] word here unites with the person and
[1:16:45] they two become one. Then what does it
[1:16:48] do then? It manifests the son of man.
[1:16:52] Again,
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; not the church theologians, the son of
[1:16:58] man. The word and the church becomes
[1:17:02] one. Wherever the son of whatever the
[1:17:05] son of man done, he was the word. The
[1:17:08] church does the same thing. Glory to
[1:17:12] God. just a that that's just a review
[1:17:15] from the last time we ministered because
[1:17:18] it's important to understand the
[1:17:19] ministry that we're under so that we it
[1:17:22] becomes more real to us what it is that
[1:17:25] the word is supposed to produce in our
[1:17:28] lives.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. We don't want to be
[1:17:31] looking into a future event. We don't
[1:17:32] want to be looking back. We want to
[1:17:35] recognize what God is doing right now in
[1:17:38] our midst. Amen.
[1:17:42] So let's move along here. In the next
[1:17:45] slide, we're going to read from St. John
[1:17:48] chapter 3 verses 26 to uh uh
[1:17:54] 31.
[1:17:56] Now pay attention here.
[1:17:59] And they came unto John, and said unto
[1:18:01] him, Rabbi, HE THAT WAS WITH THEE beyond
[1:18:04] Jordan, to whom thou beest witness,
[1:18:07] behold, the same baptizeth,
[1:18:10] and all men come to him.
[1:18:13] So here now, the people are telling
[1:18:15] John, they're going to John. They're
[1:18:16] saying, "Hey, you know the, you know,
[1:18:18] Jesus, you know, the one that you uh,
[1:18:20] you know, pointed out back there at the
[1:18:22] Jordan, the people are starting to
[1:18:24] gather around him. Why is it that
[1:18:26] they're gathering around him and they're
[1:18:28] kind of not so much around you anymore?
[1:18:31] Now, pay attention here. John answers
[1:18:34] and says, "A man can receive nothing
[1:18:38] except
[1:18:40] it be given him from heaven."
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Ye yourselves bear witness of me that I
[1:18:48] said, I am not the Christ, but I am sent
[1:18:52] before him.
[1:18:54] So here John now the people come to him
[1:18:57] they say HEY YOU KNOW THEY'RE STARTING
[1:18:59] TO FOLLOW JESUS THEY'RE NOT FOLLOWING
[1:19:01] you anymore well that's a good thing
[1:19:02] John says he says he says and by the way
[1:19:07] they are following him because something
[1:19:10] was revealed to them
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; there's no way that they could recognize
[1:19:15] unless it be given to them
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T RECOGNIZE this
[1:19:21] message you cannot come under the
[1:19:23] headship of this ministry. I'm not
[1:19:26] talking about the this good neighbor
[1:19:28] ministry. I'm talking about the ministry
[1:19:30] of the word for your day where where
[1:19:33] where now you have to you you got to
[1:19:36] bear the reproach for what the word says
[1:19:39] you're to produce.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; And if your life is not producing some
[1:19:43] turmoil in your surroundings is because
[1:19:47] you're you're you're TOO YOU'RE TOO MUCH
[1:19:49] LIKE the world. Amen. There's a
[1:19:52] difference when the word comes in this
[1:19:54] hour. It separates.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; It shows a definite difference by the
[1:20:00] revelation of the word.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; You you receive THE HOLY GHOST FOR YOUR
[1:20:04] DAY. You cannot remain the same.
[1:20:06] Everything around you starts to change.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; The people know that you're different.
[1:20:10] They know it's a reality.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So here now John is
[1:20:15] telling them and and and by the way and
[1:20:17] he's telling them, "AND I TOLD YOU it
[1:20:19] wasn't me." See, YOU'RE TELLING ME,
[1:20:22] YEAH, THAT THEY'RE FOLLOWING JESUS, I
[1:20:24] TOLD YOU IT WASN'T ME.
[1:20:27] But listen what he says here. Go to the
[1:20:29] next scripture, next verse in verse 29.
[1:20:32] He says, "He that hath the bride is the
[1:20:37] bridegroom."
[1:20:38] Hath is a past tense.
[1:20:42] He already knew his bride. He already
[1:20:46] knew who would hear his voice.
[1:20:50] HE ALREADY KNEW WHO THE WISE virgin
[1:20:52] would be.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; HE ALREADY KNEW THAT THAT OIL WOULD BE
[1:20:55] IN them because it was we read it. The
[1:20:58] quote, brother Bram says the Holy Spirit
[1:21:01] which is himself.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; It's Christ himself.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the friend of the bridegroom
[1:21:08] which standeth and heareth him rejoicth
[1:21:11] greatly because OF THE BRIDEGROOM'S
[1:21:13] VOICE. THIS MY JOY THEREFORE is
[1:21:16] fulfilled.
[1:21:18] So, he was he WAS RECOGNIZING THAT, HEY,
[1:21:20] I'M SO GRATEFUL
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; THAT I WAS ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT GOD
[1:21:25] OPENED MY EYES TO THE REVELATION OF WHO
[1:21:28] HE WAS. LISTEN, WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM,
[1:21:30] WHEN THOSE SEALS GOT RIPPED OPEN AND THE
[1:21:33] AND THE and the and THE REVELATION OF OF
[1:21:35] CHRIST, THE MYSTERY WAS UNVEILED, HE WAS
[1:21:38] REJOICING. HE WAS HE WAS SAYING, "THIS
[1:21:40] IS A NEW BOOK. IT'S A BRAND NEW BIBLE.
[1:21:43] EVERYTHING'S BECOME A REALITY TO ME NOW.
[1:21:46] NOW I KNOW. NOW I SEE WHO HE REALLY IS.
[1:21:49] AMEN. I listen IF IF THE HOLY SPIRIT IF
[1:21:53] GOD HAD NOT SENT ONE ANGEL IN every
[1:21:56] night of the OPENING OF THOSE SEALS, he
[1:21:58] would have made an error with the mess
[1:22:00] with those horse riders.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; HE EVEN CALLED THE WHITE HORSE rider in
[1:22:07] a in a quote. I can't remember where
[1:22:10] back in 50s sometime
[1:22:13] where he said it was the HOLY GHOST.
[1:22:18] BUT AFTER THE OPENING OF THOSE SEALS, HE
[1:22:20] SAID, "THUS sayeth the Lord."
[1:22:22] Hallelujah. That white horse rider is
[1:22:26] that impersonator, the one that's been
[1:22:28] deceiving the church all along. Amen.
[1:22:31] And he's still trying to deceive the
[1:22:33] church and keep her in a bondage.
[1:22:37] Glory to God. He Now watch John now.
[1:22:41] Just like brother Brham when John
[1:22:44] realized the dispensational change that
[1:22:47] was taking place that his part was to
[1:22:50] introduce the bridegroom.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; He had to step back and he said it right
[1:22:56] away while he's saying all of this AND
[1:22:58] HE'S SAYING I'M REJOICING. I'VE
[1:23:00] RECOGNIZED HIM. The people that that
[1:23:02] that are recognizing him. They've heard
[1:23:04] his voice. They they they were ordained
[1:23:06] to it. He says, "NOW I GOTTA decrease so
[1:23:10] that he can increase."
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "I GOTTA DECREASE
[1:23:14] SO THAT HE CAN INCREASE." THIS IS NOT
[1:23:17] ABOUT FOLLOWING BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:23:19] ANYMORE. LISTEN, WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO
[1:23:21] FALL IN LISTEN, WE DON'T FALL IN LOVE
[1:23:23] WITH THE WITH THE MESSENGER. WE FALL IN
[1:23:25] LOVE WITH THE MESSENGER,
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; THE THE THE ONE THAT HE BROUGHT.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; CHRIST HIMSELF.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN ELEAZAR. WE'RE
[1:23:37] NOT WE'RE NOT GOING TO GLORIFY ELEAZAR.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; ELEAZAR WAS TELLING REBECCA ALL ABOUT
[1:23:43] ISAAC. AND THAT'S WHAT BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:23:45] WAS DOING WHEN THIS BOOK BECAME A BRAND
[1:23:47] NEW BOOK. HE SAYS, "I CALL YOU NO MORE
[1:23:50] CHURCH. I CALL YOU THE BRIDE OF JESUS
[1:23:53] CHRIST."
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; HIS WIFE.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Glory to God. Amen.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; RECOGNIZING
[1:24:02] JOHN TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD TO STEP BACK.
[1:24:05] HE HAD to and and you know listen people
[1:24:08] are worshiping brother Brham that
[1:24:11] brother Brandham himself warned THE
[1:24:13] PEOPLE DON'T DO THAT. IT EVEN GOT HIM TO
[1:24:16] A PLACE WHERE HE WANTED TO STEP RIGHT
[1:24:18] OUT OF THE MINISTRY.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS I'D RATHER STEP DOWN THAN ALLOW
[1:24:22] THE PEOPLE TO to come and make me an
[1:24:24] antichrist.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; IMAGINE.
[1:24:28] BUT YET THE PEOPLE are so blinded
[1:24:32] that their that their eyes are strictly
[1:24:34] on the signs, the wonders,
[1:24:39] failing to recognize the angel himself.
[1:24:42] We see it all typed. Amen. We listen
[1:24:48] uh we see it all typed in the bridegroom
[1:24:50] and the bride. It's all about a
[1:24:53] marriage. But we must be clear that the
[1:24:56] marriage is between Christ and his
[1:24:57] bride, not the messenger in the bride.
[1:25:01] Amen. John the Baptist made it clear
[1:25:03] that he was not the bridegroom's voice.
[1:25:07] Amen. He says HE WAS THE VOICE OF THE
[1:25:10] ONE THAT was to introduce the Messiah,
[1:25:13] the voice of one crying in the
[1:25:15] wilderness, make way for him.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:22] Now, the virgins.
[1:25:24] Okay, so now we're going to deviate a
[1:25:26] bit here. We're going to look into the
[1:25:28] the the the virgins. Okay, the virgins
[1:25:33] that Jesus is talking about here in the
[1:25:35] parable, he's not talking about literal
[1:25:38] virgins
[1:25:41] where people because there's people that
[1:25:43] that that that have taken the word of
[1:25:46] God and there's people that are
[1:25:49] literally living
[1:25:51] exactly
[1:25:53] as the scripture said where they they
[1:25:55] will not allow themselves to be touched.
[1:25:57] You've got nuns in the Catholic church,
[1:26:00] right? It's all a perversion.
[1:26:03] It's not about
[1:26:06] virgins
[1:26:07] in the way that it's written in this
[1:26:10] into the scripture here. Amen. So
[1:26:12] talking about sons and it's talking
[1:26:14] about sons and daughters of God who've
[1:26:17] been washed by the water of the word.
[1:26:20] Amen. Being called out from the
[1:26:22] indoctrinated teachings of this age.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there's a lot of people
[1:26:29] now. Now, I'm bringing this out here
[1:26:31] because listen, there's people that'll
[1:26:33] hear this message that are still kind of
[1:26:36] uh, you know, bound into into
[1:26:38] denomination. And we're looking for the
[1:26:40] last one.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Okay? Whether they're in denomination or
[1:26:44] whether they're in this message,
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; because there there's there's some that
[1:26:48] ARE BOUND IN THIS message
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; under the legalism of the teachings that
[1:26:53] come in the BOUNDARIES OF THE MESSAGE OF
[1:26:56] THE HOUR.
[1:26:58] boundaries of it, not the actual message
[1:27:01] of the hour. Christ is the message of
[1:27:03] the hour. So we must be careful
[1:27:07] of carnal interpretations within the
[1:27:09] message which causes confusion for many
[1:27:12] ministers for sisters putting a spirit
[1:27:15] of law on the people and blinding them
[1:27:17] from seeing Christ the word.
[1:27:21] There are teachings in this message that
[1:27:24] now remember keep your spiritual
[1:27:27] thinking caps on here. I'm not trying to
[1:27:30] bring some kind of uh you know uh uh
[1:27:34] doctrine or teaching on marriage and
[1:27:36] divorce and this and that. We need to
[1:27:38] have our spiritual thinking caps on.
[1:27:40] Okay. But there are teachings in this
[1:27:42] message that if a minister, for example,
[1:27:44] has married a woman THAT THAT WAS NOT A
[1:27:47] VIRGIN, he cannot preach the word of God
[1:27:50] for this hour.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; There's teachings like that. That's the
[1:27:55] same lying spirit,
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; controlling spirit that's trying to use
[1:28:01] the word
[1:28:04] TO JUSTIFY CERTAIN SITUATIONS OR JUSTIFY
[1:28:07] THEIR POSITION IN THE WORD OF GOD
[1:28:10] because it makes them feel safe.
[1:28:16] I'm bringing this here as an example as
[1:28:19] it pertains to what we're ministering on
[1:28:22] here this morning. So put on your
[1:28:23] thinking caps. We're we are talking
[1:28:26] about understanding the difference
[1:28:27] between the wise and the foolish virgin.
[1:28:30] Okay? One has the Holy Ghost. The other
[1:28:32] one doesn't. The one without the Holy
[1:28:35] Ghost cannot interpret the word.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; She'll see the word carnally.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember the wise had oil, the
[1:28:44] Holy Ghost, but the foolish had no oil.
[1:28:46] The fire that brings light to the word
[1:28:49] of the hour. The word of the hour.
[1:28:53] Amen. What is the Holy Ghost? It's
[1:28:54] Christ in you. It is his identification
[1:28:58] that he's chosen you personally.
[1:29:02] HE DIDN'T CHOOSE HE DIDN'T CHOOSE
[1:29:03] COUPLES. HE DIDN'T CHOOSE CHURCHES.
[1:29:06] THIS is you and Christ.
[1:29:10] The bridegroom and the bride.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we need to we need to see that
[1:29:15] that he's speaking personal. Amen.
[1:29:18] Hallelujah. What is the Holy Ghost?
[1:29:20] CHRIST IN YOU. PAUL in the New Testament
[1:29:23] never wrote anything about New Testament
[1:29:26] ministers having to marry a virgin.
[1:29:31] Somebody show me anywhere in the New
[1:29:32] Testament where Paul said he has to
[1:29:36] marry a virgin. No, he said he has to be
[1:29:38] the husband of one wife.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:29:43] Now, I'm not bringing this to try and uh
[1:29:47] you know uh substantiate people's
[1:29:50] positions here. This is all based on the
[1:29:53] bridegroom call. So, keep your minds in
[1:29:55] the right place. Amen. He said, listen,
[1:29:59] there's nowhere in the New Testament.
[1:30:01] NOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM DID say in the
[1:30:03] message marriage and divorce sermon that
[1:30:06] a priest could not marry a woman that
[1:30:08] had that had had another husband.
[1:30:12] But I want to read that quote.
[1:30:15] Okay, you can put it up. 15. There is no
[1:30:19] minister that can marry a widow.
[1:30:22] Did you know that? You want to read it?
[1:30:25] You want to read that? All right. You
[1:30:27] get in Leviticus, Leviticus 21
[1:30:32] 7 and Ezekiel 44:22.
[1:30:34] AND I'LL SHOW you that the priesthood
[1:30:37] was not to marry a woman THAT BEEN
[1:30:40] TOUCHED BY A MAN.
[1:30:42] This type is of the virgin bride OF
[1:30:46] JESUS CHRIST BECAUSE they handled the
[1:30:48] fire of God.
[1:30:51] The priest did. Aaron's sons. WE HAVEN'T
[1:30:56] GOT time to read it all and get out by
[1:30:58] noon. We only got 20 minutes yet. And
[1:31:01] then it's Aaron's sons that handled the
[1:31:04] fire of God. So they could not marry a
[1:31:08] woman that had been touched by another
[1:31:10] man.
[1:31:12] It's very clear. PEOPLE TAKE THAT VERY
[1:31:15] quote and they will use it as the
[1:31:17] foundation for trying to justify. See
[1:31:20] that's why they can't be one of the wise
[1:31:23] virgin.
[1:31:24] That's why they can't be bride.
[1:31:27] That's why BECAUSE THEY HAVE FALLEN
[1:31:30] under this situation here and and so and
[1:31:35] so so many people and I don't know where
[1:31:38] they are wherever they are BUT IT'S IT'S
[1:31:42] BROUGHT CONFUSION. IT'S HURT PEOPLE.
[1:31:44] IT'S CAUSED DIVISION. It's broken up
[1:31:46] churches.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; But this IS THE HOUR
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; WHERE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST RECEIVES
[1:31:54] her word FOR HER DAY. HOW IT PERTAINS TO
[1:31:58] HER AND IT AND IT'S RIGHT FROM THE
[1:32:00] SCRIPTURES.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT GOING TO BRING ANYTHING THAT'S
[1:32:03] NOT IN THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. LISTEN,
[1:32:09] let's read
[1:32:12] the next slide here.
[1:32:14] The unchanging God said, so this is from
[1:32:18] marriage and divorce. They could not
[1:32:20] marry another woman and a woman being
[1:32:23] touched by a man showing in type
[1:32:27] in type.
[1:32:29] IF YOU WANT TO see it, that the church
[1:32:31] of the living God
[1:32:33] is purely unadulterated, THE WORD OF GOD
[1:32:37] AND NOT A DENOMINATION THAT'S BEEN
[1:32:39] HANDLED BY MAN.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; WAS HANDLED by a man by a by a previous
[1:32:49] marriage.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; YOU WERE BORN IN ADULTERY.
[1:32:54] AMEN.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; DON'T BE TRYING TO JUSTIFY ANYTHING.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Some want TO USE THIS ONE QUOTE FROM
[1:33:02] BROTHER BRANDHAM AND SAY HE SAID IT.
[1:33:04] THAT SETTLES IT. But remember, it's
[1:33:07] important to make sure we have a clear
[1:33:09] revelation on what he said. AND THAT
[1:33:13] WHAT HE SAID NEEDS TO RUN TRUE ALL THE
[1:33:16] WAY FROM GENESIS TO REVELATION.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; The word of God.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; QUOTE, LISTEN.
[1:33:25] BROTHER BRENNHAM is speaking to a woman
[1:33:28] who was drawn away.
[1:33:30] Started listen right here. I'm just
[1:33:32] going to read a a very quick excerpt
[1:33:35] here on a woman that had been drawn away
[1:33:39] and she started
[1:33:42] hanging out with the wrong people and
[1:33:45] before she knew it she become a public
[1:33:46] prostitute.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Okay. She started living AND SHE TOLD
[1:33:53] BROTHER BRANDHAM EXACTLY
[1:33:55] EVERYTHING. She spilled her guts
[1:33:58] because she had come into contact with
[1:34:01] something she had never come into
[1:34:03] contact with before.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; And and and now listen to brother
[1:34:07] Brandham here. I don't have the quote up
[1:34:08] there because I just pulled it. He says
[1:34:11] and it's from 1961 from that time. And I
[1:34:14] said, "Hear in your heart, you're
[1:34:16] telling me," he's talking to the woman,
[1:34:18] "that you'd love to be married and have
[1:34:20] a husband."
[1:34:22] I said, "You're a beautiful girl. YOU'D
[1:34:26] MAKE A REAL SWEETHEART FOR SOME LITTLE
[1:34:29] TIRED preacher
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; of God."
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; NOW, HERE'S BROTHER Brandham
[1:34:38] saying it right here.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; OKAY? YOU WILL NOT FIND ANYWHERE ELSE
[1:34:43] WHERE BROTHER BRANDHAM ever uh quotes
[1:34:46] and says that a that a that a man who
[1:34:50] who who marries who doesn't marry a
[1:34:52] virgin cannot preach the gospel of
[1:34:54] Christ. Nowhere.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Now, HE GOES ON. HE SAYS, "I SAID, BUT I
[1:35:02] WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. Your sins
[1:35:04] MAY BE AS BLACK AS SMUTTY AS HELL." He's
[1:35:08] talking to the girl. But I KNOW THERE'S
[1:35:10] A FOUNTAIN FILLED WITH BLOOD DRAWN FROM
[1:35:12] EMANUEL'S VEINS.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; WHERE SINNERS PLUNGE BENEATH THE FLOOD,
[1:35:16] LOSE ALL THEIR GUILTY STATES.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; It can MAKE YOU WHITE AS SNOW. SHE SAID,
[1:35:22] "OH, IT SEEMS LIKE IT COULD BE JUST A
[1:35:25] MYTH, MR. BRANDOM." SHE SAID, "I WANT TO
[1:35:28] BE THAT." I SAID, "WILL YOU PRAY WITH
[1:35:31] ME?" AND SHE SAID, "YES, SIR." WELL, YOU
[1:35:33] can go back and read the quote from 1962
[1:35:37] uh in in uh May 20th from that time and
[1:35:40] you can read the entire story. She got
[1:35:43] converted. She was purged. SHE WAS
[1:35:46] WASHED. SHE WAS CLEAN. AMEN. Glory to
[1:35:49] God. Amen. So, so the scripture tells us
[1:35:52] that we need that uh you know that out
[1:35:55] of the mouth of two or three witnesses,
[1:35:57] let everything be established. And
[1:35:58] there's no other quote before or after
[1:36:02] this marriage and divorce quote where
[1:36:05] brother Brham said that a minister must
[1:36:07] marry a virgin. What brother Brham said
[1:36:10] was absolutely the truth.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; It's from the word of God from
[1:36:15] Leviticus.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen here. THE LEVITICAL
[1:36:19] PRIESTHOOD ESTABLISHED BY MOSES who made
[1:36:23] Aaron the first priest.
[1:36:25] Now, if we were to still be under the
[1:36:28] Levitical priesthood, naturally
[1:36:30] speaking, I would not be able to be up
[1:36:33] here
[1:36:35] because the scripture says in Leviticus
[1:36:38] 2:15, they shall NOT MAKE BALDNESS UPON
[1:36:42] THEIR HEAD.
[1:36:49] I SHAVED MYSELF THIS MORNING AND I'M
[1:36:52] SHAVING myself and I'm thinking about
[1:36:54] this scripture.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; If any of AARON'S SEED HAD any blemish,
[1:37:05] BLINDNESS, ETC., THEY COULD NOT MINISTER
[1:37:08] THE WORD. IF THIS IF THIS WAS THE IF
[1:37:10] THIS WAS THE CASE, PAUL, he had a he had
[1:37:13] a a problem WITH HIS EYESIGHT.
[1:37:16] BUT YET, he wrote the whole New
[1:37:17] Testament.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. He'd have been disqualified.
[1:37:21] Brother Brandham said that the priest
[1:37:23] could NOT MARRY ANY WOMAN that had BEEN
[1:37:25] TOUCHED BY ANOTHER MAN. SHE had to BE A
[1:37:28] VIRGIN. PERIOD. AND NOW THIS IS THE
[1:37:30] ELEMENT. THIS TYPE IS OF THE VIRGIN
[1:37:32] BRIDE OF JESUS Christ because they
[1:37:35] handled the fire of God back then when
[1:37:37] Moses established the Levitical
[1:37:39] priesthood.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; AND THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; IF A WOMAN AND a man HAD BEEN CAUGHT
[1:37:46] HAVING uh relations before marriage,
[1:37:49] THEY WOULD BE STONED TO DEATH.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; MY GOD, WE'D HAVE GRAVEYARDS. WE'D BE
[1:37:54] LOOKING AT GRAVEYARDS INSTEAD OF HOUSES
[1:37:56] AROUND us
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; if that was the case. Listen,
[1:38:04] go to the next slide. Scripture here,
[1:38:06] Hebrews 7. We're going to look at this.
[1:38:07] If therefore perfection
[1:38:10] were by the Levitical priesthood, for
[1:38:12] under it the people received THE LAW,
[1:38:16] WHAT further need was there that ANOTHER
[1:38:19] PRIEST SHOULD RISE UP AFTER THE ORDER OF
[1:38:21] MELZDC?
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; NOW, this is the hour we're living in.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; This pertains to you and me. because
[1:38:30] we're under that same order. AND NOT BE
[1:38:33] CALLED AFTER THE ORDER OF AARON,
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; SIR.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; FOR THE PRIESTHOOD BEING CHANGED, THERE
[1:38:40] IS MADE OF NECESSITY A CHANGE ALSO of
[1:38:43] the law.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; That's why you will never hear Paul
[1:38:48] preaching and telling you that a man has
[1:38:51] to marry a virgin in order to take the
[1:38:53] word of God. that a man has to marry uh
[1:38:56] cannot marry a woman that's been married
[1:38:58] to another man. A man cannot even marry
[1:39:00] a widow. THERE'S TALK CAN'T EVEN MARRY A
[1:39:03] WIDOW IF IF THAT WIDOW WAS NOT FROM A
[1:39:06] FROM A FROM A A marriage of a previous
[1:39:08] priesthood.
[1:39:10] WHAT ARE THEY DOING? THEY'RE BRINGING
[1:39:12] BACK THE LAW. AMEN.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE BRINGING BACK ORGANIZED
[1:39:17] RELIGION.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; IN ORDER TO BIND THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY
[1:39:23] CAN FEEL SAFE UNDER THE MINISTRY THAT
[1:39:26] STAND WITH THE WORD and we we only do
[1:39:29] what the word says and and and this is
[1:39:32] you can't you know they want to they
[1:39:34] want to they THEY WANT TO DISQUALIFY SO
[1:39:36] MANY PEOPLE. THAT'S NOT the spirit of
[1:39:39] God.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; No sir. You're going to see what the
[1:39:42] spirit of God is. For he OF WHOM THESE
[1:39:46] THINGS are spoken. For listen verse 12.
[1:39:48] For the priesthood being changed, there
[1:39:51] is made of necessity a change also of
[1:39:54] the law.
[1:39:56] For he OF WHOM THESE THINGS are spoken
[1:39:59] pertain to another tribe.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; OH, OF WHICH NO MAN GIVE UTTERANCE at
[1:40:05] the altar.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Listen, go to the next uh verse here.
[1:40:10] Verse 14. For it is evident that our
[1:40:13] Lord sprang out of Judah,
[1:40:17] OF WHICH TRIBE MOSES SPOKE nothing
[1:40:20] concerning him,
[1:40:22] concerning the priesthood?
[1:40:26] Didn't talk about the tribe of Judah.
[1:40:29] Moses never made any any reference to
[1:40:31] that. It is but AND IT IS YET FAR MORE
[1:40:35] evident for that after the similitude of
[1:40:39] Melzdc
[1:40:41] a man in human flesh.
[1:40:46] But yet God
[1:40:48] come to the people come TO SPEAK TO TO
[1:40:52] Abraham
[1:40:53] to make a promise TO ABRAHAM THAT YOU'RE
[1:40:55] GOING TO BRING FORTH A SON and that son
[1:40:59] IS GOING TO COME THROUGH SARAH.
[1:41:02] IT'S NOT GOING TO COME THROUGH THE
[1:41:03] BONDSWOMAN. IT'S NOT GOING TO COME
[1:41:04] THROUGH UNBELIEF. It's going to come by
[1:41:07] a word promise.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; And the bride will only believe the
[1:41:13] word.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; She'll only take the promised word.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; She will NOT TAKE ANOTHER MAN'S
[1:41:18] INTERPRETATION of the word.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Never.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; He says, "And that there ariseth." So
[1:41:26] for that after the similitude of Melzdc
[1:41:28] there arriveth there there ariseth
[1:41:30] another priest WHO IS MADE NOT AFTER THE
[1:41:33] LAW OF A CARNAL COMMANDMENT.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; NO SIR
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR commandments here
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; BUT AFTER THE POWER OF AN ENDLESS LIFE.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; That's the eternal word OF GOD THAT GOD
[1:41:48] HAS TOLD YOU. YOU COME FROM ME.
[1:41:52] AMEN.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; YOU ORIGINALLY WERE ME.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T BE LOST.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T BE FOUND IN ADULTERY.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T BE LOST. YOU ARE MINE. YOU ARE
[1:42:05] in me. IT'S AN ENDLESS LIFE. IT'S
[1:42:08] ETERNAL. AMEN. HE SAYS, "FOR HE
[1:42:11] TESTIFITH, THOU ART A PRIEST FOREVER
[1:42:16] after the order of Mechazdc."
[1:42:19] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Listen, if you
[1:42:23] just just a little commentary here on on
[1:42:25] these scriptures here, he says, listen,
[1:42:28] the focus on these scriptures was the
[1:42:31] the the temporary Levitical priesthood
[1:42:34] to the eternal there was a comparison to
[1:42:36] the eternal priesthood. That's what the
[1:42:38] scripture in Hebrews is talking about
[1:42:39] here. Okay? And it argues that Jesus
[1:42:42] priesthood IS SUPERIOR BECAUSE IT'S
[1:42:46] BASED ON THE DIVINE POWER OF HIMSELF
[1:42:49] that he swore by himself and not by a
[1:42:53] man's
[1:42:55] vow
[1:42:57] which will always fail.
[1:43:02] A non priestly origin. The author notes
[1:43:05] it is evident that Jesus DESCENDED FROM
[1:43:07] THE TRIBE of Judah.
[1:43:10] He descended from the tribe of Judah. IN
[1:43:13] THE MOSAIC LAW, THE PRIESTHOOD was
[1:43:15] strictly reserved for the tribe of Levi.
[1:43:18] Moses never authorized the tribe of
[1:43:21] Judah for priestly service.
[1:43:28] So the power of the messianic king while
[1:43:33] Judah WAS NOT A PRIESTLY TRIBE, IT WAS
[1:43:35] THE ROYAL tribe of King David by
[1:43:39] identifying Jesus with Judah. The author
[1:43:43] is confirming his kingship WHILE
[1:43:46] SIMULTANEOUSLY PROVING HIS PRIESTHOOD
[1:43:49] MUST OPERATE UNDER A DIFFERENT HIGHER
[1:43:52] AUTHORITY than that of the Levitical
[1:43:54] priesthood.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; He overrides it all.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I'm married to the king.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; The final word.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Listen here.
[1:44:12] Let's read the quote here. We're going
[1:44:13] to we're going to we're going to wind
[1:44:14] this down now. We're going to read some
[1:44:16] quotes and and it's from the invisible
[1:44:18] union of the bride of Christ. And I want
[1:44:21] you to see yourself. I want you to
[1:44:23] recognize here that you are not to allow
[1:44:27] any
[1:44:30] denominational
[1:44:32] controlling spirit to come and take
[1:44:35] control of your life as you walk with
[1:44:38] Christ.
[1:44:39] I'm talking about people that are
[1:44:41] seriously walking with Christ here. I'm
[1:44:42] not I'm not presenting this as an
[1:44:45] escapegoat. You know where you stand.
[1:44:47] You know if you've you know if you're
[1:44:50] walking with God. You know if you're if
[1:44:52] you're naked before God. You've you've
[1:44:54] you've you've divulged everything. You
[1:44:56] you've allowed him to have his way in
[1:44:58] your life.
[1:45:00] He says here in invisible union. He says
[1:45:03] now it was nature associated with death.
[1:45:09] Your first husband that had rule over
[1:45:12] you was your nature by natural birth.
[1:45:17] So you had a natural husband natural.
[1:45:19] You love the world because you are the
[1:45:22] world. You're of this world. YOU YOU YOU
[1:45:25] came into this world. Okay. Part of the
[1:45:27] world. That's right. YOUR DESIRES WAS BY
[1:45:30] NATURE to love the world which you're a
[1:45:33] part of. You're a part of nature.
[1:45:37] You believe that? And that's your
[1:45:39] natural thing. Next slide.
[1:45:43] That's the reason you have to be born
[1:45:45] again.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE. YOU HAVE TO DIE TO
[1:45:50] THAT first husband.
[1:45:53] That's what we're talking about here.
[1:45:57] This is the true revelation
[1:46:01] on THE PRIEST CHRIST AFTER THE ORDER OF
[1:46:04] MELZDC will only take A VIRGIN BRIDE.
[1:46:08] YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN. Your old life,
[1:46:11] YOUR OLD NATURE, YOUR DESIRES FOR THE
[1:46:14] WORLD, YOUR DESIRES for the doctrines OF
[1:46:16] MAN, YOUR DESIRES FOR YOUR denomination
[1:46:21] all have to die
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; completely.
[1:46:25] YOU HAVE TO DIE TO THAT FIRST HUSBAND.
[1:46:27] You can't live with it. You just you
[1:46:29] can't say, "Well, I'll divorce him and
[1:46:31] hang him up here till occasion." No,
[1:46:34] sir. NO WRITING OF DIVORCEMENT. HE DIES.
[1:46:40] The nature of the WORLD HAS TO DIE.
[1:46:43] EVERY SPECK OF HIM HAS to die. You have
[1:46:46] to be reunited again with another
[1:46:48] nature. Your name of your first nature
[1:46:52] was born and put in a book of life.
[1:46:57] And all your deeds was wrote in it too.
[1:47:00] Everything you done under that nature
[1:47:03] was put in a book called the book of
[1:47:05] life.
[1:47:08] That's why
[1:47:10] you want the new birth.
[1:47:14] That's why you need to be baptized and
[1:47:17] buried into the water so that your old
[1:47:19] life gets buried with your old life with
[1:47:23] all the sin and all the unbelief. All
[1:47:26] the things that you did before you
[1:47:28] received Christ the word. You need that
[1:47:32] all wiped away from your life. Then
[1:47:35] nobody can tell you nothing.
[1:47:39] TELL YOU THIS, TELL you Levitical this,
[1:47:41] Levitical that, tells you you can't do
[1:47:43] this, you can't do that. No, you've
[1:47:45] entered into a relationship with the
[1:47:47] king himself
[1:47:49] and he vindicates his life in you. But
[1:47:53] first, you die.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; So, we don't want that book of life.
[1:48:03] Listen
[1:48:04] here in second Corinthians
[1:48:08] Paul he's talking about here he says
[1:48:12] would to God YE COULD BEAR WITH me a
[1:48:14] little bit in my folly and indeed bear
[1:48:16] with me for I am jealous over you
[1:48:21] with godly JEALOUSY FOR I HAVE ESPOUSED
[1:48:24] you to one husband that I may present
[1:48:26] you as a chasteed virgin to Christ but I
[1:48:30] fear less by any means as the serpent
[1:48:32] beguiled Eve through subility.
[1:48:36] So your mind should be corrupt from the
[1:48:39] simplicity that is in Christ.
[1:48:43] Now here Paul,
[1:48:45] he's talking to the Corinthians.
[1:48:50] He says to them, now you got to you got
[1:48:51] to, you know, bear with me here. I'm
[1:48:53] going to be a little bit bold because
[1:48:55] I'm I'm I'm you know, I I I've
[1:48:57] recognized what's going on here. You
[1:48:58] guys are in a mess. You guys, you you
[1:49:01] guys, you guys need to understand
[1:49:04] something here. You're you're listening
[1:49:06] to to to the doctrines of man. You're
[1:49:08] allowing other men to take control of
[1:49:11] your mind to where you are being
[1:49:13] beguiled by the simplicity of Christ.
[1:49:18] I'm telling you that you THAT I AM GOING
[1:49:21] TO PRESENT YOU. I'M MY GOAL IS TO
[1:49:23] PRESENT YOU TO CHRIST A CHASTEED VIRGIN.
[1:49:28] But I CAN SHOW YOU SCRIPTURE WHERE PAUL
[1:49:30] IS REBUKING ALL THOSE PEOPLE, TELLING
[1:49:33] THEM, LISTEN, SOME OF YOU WERE
[1:49:35] ADULTERERS, SOME OF YOU WERE
[1:49:37] FORNICATORS, SOME OF YOU WERE MOLESTERS.
[1:49:39] THIS, THAT, SUCH WERE A LOT OF YOU.
[1:49:45] BUT UNDERSTAND THAT THIS RELATIONSHIP
[1:49:48] THAT I AM BRINGING TO YOU, THIS
[1:49:51] REVELATION ON JESUS CHRIST THAT I AM
[1:49:54] BRINGING TO YOU, THIS PAUL SPEAKING,
[1:49:55] HE'S BEING BOLD. HE SAYS, "DON'T YOU
[1:49:58] ALLOW THAT SAME SERPENT."
[1:50:01] He knew what had been revealed to him.
[1:50:03] He was talking about the SERPENT FROM
[1:50:05] THE BACK in the at the beginning THAT
[1:50:07] THIS THAT THAT DEFILED EVE TO get her to
[1:50:11] accept adultery.
[1:50:15] ACCEPT HER CONDITION TO ACCEPT THAT WORD
[1:50:18] where it brought death into her life and
[1:50:20] into the LIFE OF MANKIND. BUT JESUS HAS
[1:50:24] COME TO REVERSE THAT.
[1:50:26] And his goal IS A IS A CHASTEED VIRGIN.
[1:50:31] AMEN.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:50:34] SO PAUL'S MAKING IT VERY clear here.
[1:50:37] He's he's he's saying, listen, he's he's
[1:50:39] he's comparing don't listen to these
[1:50:42] false teachers. Be careful of
[1:50:44] denominational teachings and and and and
[1:50:47] men's ideas
[1:50:50] which will bring you into a spirit of
[1:50:52] condemnation where you don't where where
[1:50:54] you DON'T ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE WHAT GOD
[1:50:56] SAID YOU ARE.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Let's read on
[1:51:03] number 22. He says, "WELL, YOU SEPARATED
[1:51:05] FROM YOUR FIRST union by spiritual
[1:51:07] death. Now you are born again or
[1:51:10] remarried again
[1:51:13] to the new spiritual union and not your
[1:51:16] natural life of the things of the world
[1:51:18] but an eternal life. Amen. The that germ
[1:51:23] that was in you at the very beginning
[1:51:26] found you.
[1:51:30] Now your OLD BOOK IS GONE. Your old
[1:51:33] UNION IS GONE. NOW YOUR NAME is Now your
[1:51:37] name in your old in your has been
[1:51:40] transferred.
[1:51:42] Now you say, "Do you mean to tell me
[1:51:43] that my old book God put it in the sea
[1:51:47] of his forgetfulness?"
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; YOUR OLD LIFE IS GONE ONCE YOU'VE BEEN
[1:51:53] BIRTHED by the word of God of this hour.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; You stand perfectly before God. Amen. He
[1:52:00] goes on here, next slide. HE SAYS, "NOW
[1:52:01] YOUR name is now in the new book. Amen.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; This is the book
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; that we're speaking from. The new book.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. NOT THE BOOK OF LIFE, BUT THE
[1:52:12] LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; What the LAMB REDEEMED. NOT THE OLD BOOK
[1:52:19] OF YOUR NATURAL UNION, but your NEW
[1:52:22] BRIDE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE NOW THE SPOTLESS BRIDE OF JESUS
[1:52:29] CHRIST. Your new life is in THE LAMB'S
[1:52:32] BOOK OF LIFE. your marriage certificate.
[1:52:35] Hallelujah. Where your true eternal germ
[1:52:38] from the beginning TAKES A HOLD. NOW
[1:52:41] YOU'RE NOT ONLY FORGIVEN, BUT YOU'RE
[1:52:44] JUSTIFIED. GLORY.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; He says, ROMANS 5:1 SAYS, YEAH. ROMANS
[1:52:49] 5:1 SAID, "THEREFORE, BEING JUSTIFIED BY
[1:52:52] REVELATION,
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; BY THE word of God." Amen. By faith.
[1:52:56] Look up the word I, THAT WORD DON'T MEAN
[1:52:59] FORGIVEN. THAT WORD MEANS JUSTIFIED. I
[1:53:03] IT IT DON'T MEAN YOU'RE FORGIVEN.
[1:53:06] IT MEANS YOU'RE JUSTIFIED LIKE YOU NEVER
[1:53:08] DONE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. GO TO THE
[1:53:10] NEXT SLIDE. HE SAYS, "BUT THE WORD
[1:53:12] JUSTIFIED IS THOUGH YOU NEVER DONE IT."
[1:53:15] AMEN. IT'S NOT EVEN REGARDED AT ALL. HOW
[1:53:18] IS IT DONE IN GOD'S BOOK OF THE SEA OF
[1:53:21] FORGETFULNESS? YOUR OLD BOOK AND
[1:53:24] MARRIAGE IS DIVORCED AND DEBT.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:53:31] That's every unbelief in your life.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO difference between this sin,
[1:53:37] that sin.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Paul murdered Christians.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; DON'T TRY AND PUT SOME SOME levels of
[1:53:47] sin. THERE'S NO LEVELS OF SIN.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; SIN IS JUST UNBELIEF IN THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS YOUR OLD MARRIAGE IS DIVORCED
[1:53:56] AND DEAD.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And it's NOT EVEN IN THE
[1:54:00] MEMORIES OF GOD. AMEN. YOU ARE
[1:54:02] JUSTIFIED. THEREFORE, BEING JUSTIFIED,
[1:54:05] IT WAS IT WAS uh therefore being
[1:54:08] justified, it was accused. You was
[1:54:11] accused. You never done it in the first
[1:54:13] place. The old union is in the SEA OF
[1:54:16] GOD'S FORGETFULNESS. YOU WASN'T MARRIED
[1:54:18] TO IT TO begin with.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. AMEN. LET GO OF THIS WHOLE
[1:54:26] DIMENSION. LET GO OF EVERY
[1:54:27] DENOMINATIONAL CURSE,
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; every spirit, every uh uh new age
[1:54:34] teaching that may have been uh placed
[1:54:36] into our minds and our hearts, IT'S ALL
[1:54:38] LIES.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU will come to realize is that
[1:54:41] you have only been listen
[1:54:46] 95% of everything that we hear that we
[1:54:50] were taught
[1:54:52] it's a lie.
[1:54:54] IT'S IT'S IT ONLY TAKES ONE little word
[1:54:58] that's altered. What is a lie? It's the
[1:55:01] truth perverted.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Everything. And all the enemy has ever
[1:55:06] done is come in and just pervert the
[1:55:09] word a little bit.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; That's all he's ever done all along.
[1:55:14] Comes in, takes what's been taught,
[1:55:16] takes what the the what the bride takes
[1:55:18] for that age, believes it to be thus
[1:55:20] sayeth the Lord for their age, starts to
[1:55:23] produce it in their lives. And what does
[1:55:24] the enemy do? Comes in and injects a
[1:55:28] question into it. Just like the serpent
[1:55:31] when he went to Eve and said, "Hath God
[1:55:34] said that you cannot eat of all the
[1:55:37] trees?" He was quoting exactly what God
[1:55:39] said.
[1:55:42] God said, "You shall surely die when you
[1:55:44] do." He did one thing. He added the word
[1:55:49] not.
[1:55:51] You shall not surely die. And that's
[1:55:54] what all the teachings out there have
[1:55:57] done. They will let you have a nice
[1:56:00] compromised religion. They will bring
[1:56:02] you people are running to Christ.
[1:56:04] There's a lot more people like, you
[1:56:06] know, you look at the conditions of the
[1:56:07] world, what's going on, and on the
[1:56:09] brinks of World War II, and the people
[1:56:11] are getting, they're starting to wake
[1:56:13] up. They're starting to say, "Oh, wait a
[1:56:14] minute here. You know what? I better
[1:56:16] make sure I got a reservation where I'm
[1:56:18] going after this because this party
[1:56:20] could be over sooner than I thought, you
[1:56:22] know, and they'll go and they'll join
[1:56:24] any church,
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; but it's not going to be joining church.
[1:56:27] Yes, they can come to salvation. They
[1:56:30] can listen if they change their lives,
[1:56:31] if they repent and they turn to God and
[1:56:33] they start to live for Christ and they
[1:56:35] produce a a a good sanctified life and
[1:56:39] they they they repent, they get baptized
[1:56:41] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:56:43] they come according to the word of God,
[1:56:45] God will honor his word and will save
[1:56:48] them.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean that they're part of the
[1:56:51] bride.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; This revelation that we feed on, this is
[1:56:55] about the invisible union of the bride
[1:56:57] of Christ. Amen. It's a different
[1:56:59] revelation. It's a different part of
[1:57:02] Christ. Amen. Listen here. He goes on,
[1:57:05] he the br the bridegroom bore your
[1:57:08] shame.
[1:57:09] Amen. Himself for you in your place. He
[1:57:14] took your place for you were
[1:57:16] predestinated for him to be the to be
[1:57:19] his bride before the foundations of the
[1:57:22] world.
[1:57:24] The Bible said. So you are a
[1:57:26] predestinated seed. How did you come to
[1:57:28] this? You were deceived into into it by
[1:57:31] your first marriage
[1:57:34] to your adulterous parent Eve.
[1:57:39] There it is making perfect reference
[1:57:41] right back to the very beginning. That
[1:57:43] lie, that curse has been reversed in
[1:57:47] you.
[1:57:49] IT'S NO FAULT OF YOUR OWN. He says,
[1:57:53] go on. HE SAYS, "BY YOUR NATURAL BIRTH,"
[1:57:55] LET THE MUSICIANS COME. He says, "By
[1:57:58] your natural birth,
[1:58:00] you come after Eve
[1:58:03] who committed adultery."
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE REASON YOU WERE BORN an
[1:58:12] adulteress.
[1:58:14] Every one of us born in sin, shaped in
[1:58:17] iniquity, speaking lies.
[1:58:22] YOU'RE A SINNER TO BEGIN WITH. THAT'S
[1:58:24] RIGHT. YOU WAS DECEIVED INTO IT. YOU HAD
[1:58:27] NO NO YOU. IT AIN'T YOUR FAULT. YOU
[1:58:31] NEVER DID IT BECAUSE THAT LITTLE germ
[1:58:33] that was in you
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; was to be you before the foundations of
[1:58:39] THE WORLD BECAUSE GOD PUT YOUR NAME in
[1:58:43] the LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; and the son of MAN MINISTRY OF THIS HOUR
[1:58:49] WHICH IS THE BRIDE CHRIST IN BRIDE FORM
[1:58:52] that has the word that has the OPEN BOOK
[1:58:55] THAT'S GOT THE BOOK OF REDEMPTION THAT
[1:58:57] HAS AN OPEN UNDERSTANDING ON THE WORD OF
[1:58:59] GOD IS WHILE SPEAKING the word to the
[1:59:02] sons AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD, calling their
[1:59:05] names from the Lamb's book OF LIFE THAT
[1:59:08] YOU ARE MY BRIDE. YOU ARE MY SPOTLESS,
[1:59:11] SINLESS BRIDE BY THE WORD OF GOD OF THIS
[1:59:14] HOUR.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; She believes it. She stands on it. And
[1:59:20] she will not compromise
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; with any man's teachings. Amen.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless and inspire and
[1:59:32] release sons and daughters of God from
[1:59:34] the bondage of the enemy that's tried to
[1:59:36] keep people in in in bondage by by using
[1:59:40] the word of God to place them under a
[1:59:43] previous age to place them under some
[1:59:45] Levitical teaching of the of the word of
[1:59:48] God. Yes, those are actual words from
[1:59:51] the Bible, from the word of God. But we
[1:59:53] need to recognize the age that we're
[1:59:55] living in. This is the age where the
[1:59:58] bride of Jesus Christ, SHE SHE IS
[2:00:01] ABSOLVED OF everything
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; because she is not of this world. She
[2:00:06] was with him before Eve sinned.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; And she's being awakened to that
[2:00:12] revelation in this day and in this hour.
[2:00:16] Hallelujah. Let us pray. Father,
[2:00:19] Lord, we are so grateful.
[2:00:22] Lord, I I I I said it the best that I
[2:00:24] possibly could. I pray that the people
[2:00:27] will receive it. They'll they'll uh
[2:00:29] receive the liberty of your anointing
[2:00:32] and and Lord, it'll draw them to a
[2:00:35] closer walk with you, a more sincere
[2:00:38] walk with you, Lord. a a an
[2:00:41] encouragement to know that Lord that
[2:00:43] that there is a a sacrifice that there
[2:00:47] is a a life that that we need to let go
[2:00:50] of. We need to release the old marriage
[2:00:53] in any way, shape, or form. if it's got
[2:00:55] our our our minds or uh captured our our
[2:00:58] thoughts or our emotions in any way,
[2:01:01] Lord, we've we've got to be willing to
[2:01:03] to forgive ourselves and and to and to
[2:01:06] move forward [music] in the name of
[2:01:08] Jesus Christ because Lord, if you
[2:01:11] forgive us, who can override you?

[2:01:18] Father. I pray that the blood of Jesus
[2:01:21] Christ [music] will move in our lives
[2:01:23] this week. And that you will direct and
[2:01:26] guide us and watch over us. And Lord,
[2:01:28] let our lives move uh closer to you into
[2:01:31] a a direction, Lord, where this marriage
[2:01:33] becomes more intimate with you. [music]
[2:01:35] where Lord, you you you we we speak
[2:01:38] sweet uh things to one another in the in
[2:01:42] the in [music] the in the closeness and

[2:01:47] that we Lord expose ourselves completely
[2:01:51] so that we can be clean, washed in your
[2:01:55] presence, oh God. Grant it, Lord, bless
[2:01:58] your people, prosper our [music] weak,
[2:02:01] Father,
