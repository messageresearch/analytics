[0:00] purpose that's because we know that by
[0:03] coming into the house of God we are
[0:06] keeping our connection with an unseen
[0:08] being the great Holy Spirit The Shepherd
[0:11] of the Sheepfold amen who has come down
[0:14] Among Us by the opening of that seventh
[0:17] seal and even though we don't see him
[0:19] brother Bram said yet the one who you
[0:22] feel in your heart one day he'll come
[0:26] visible before you you'll become
[0:28] personalized you
[0:30] him because you see him in the world
[0:33] that's why I'm here that's why I'm
[0:34] always touched when I come into this
[0:37] place whether there's 2 or 10,000 which
[0:39] I've spoken to 25,000 at one time it
[0:43] makes no difference Brothers amen
[0:46] something happened to me when I was
[0:48] young and it's never left
[0:50] me I I don't believe it ever will it's
[0:54] got a hold of me and it won't let me go
[0:56] amen I thank God that even though I as a
[1:00] human being in weakness you may want to
[1:02] let go but he won't let you go
[1:04] Hallelujah because we belong to him
[1:07] we're glad to be here in the house of
[1:08] the Lord welcome back and the Lord bless
[1:12] you real good now we know time is of the
[1:15] essence especially in the middle of the
[1:17] week and we'd like to uh take for
[1:22] topic uh
[1:24] tonight the mystery of the ages if those
[1:28] if we can get that of let's see if it's
[1:30] going to work um and we want
[1:35] to
[1:37] uh we we would like to use the scripture
[1:40] here out of just let me get a shorter
[1:45] scripture so that we don't have to read
[1:49] that long a long one that I have
[1:55] here
[1:56] the okay First Corinthians
[2:01] 27 but we speak the wisdom of God in a
[2:05] mystery even the hidden wisdom which God
[2:08] ordained before the world unto our Glory
[2:13] which none of the princes of this world
[2:15] knew or had they known it they would not
[2:19] have crucified the Lord of glory amen
[2:24] gracious Heavenly Father we thank you
[2:26] for your grace your love your mercy we
[2:29] thank you that we a part of your plan
[2:31] your predestinated plan of what you're
[2:34] doing in this great hour and in this
[2:36] great time we pray that you'll bless us
[2:39] tonight as we go into the word in Jesus
[2:42] name amen amen God bless you I as a
[2:45] pastor I'm just trying to build into you
[2:50] building blocks of
[2:52] life that every night something is added
[2:56] every day something is added so that you
[2:59] can can grow in the grace of God amen
[3:03] amen now who likes a
[3:07] mystery I don't know about you but I
[3:09] take
[3:10] Mysteries amen and human beings are
[3:15] naturally created with a
[3:17] curiosity that anything that stifles
[3:21] them anything that they you know they
[3:23] unknown let me use the word that the
[3:26] unknown actually attracts us if we don't
[3:30] know something we want to know about it
[3:32] we want to know what it is and so we are
[3:35] always attracted uh by Myster but yet we
[3:38] got a little there a little fear also
[3:42] with that mystery we call that reverence
[3:44] from God is Not fright but a little fear
[3:47] a respectful fear because you don't know
[3:50] what it is and so here it is brother
[3:53] sister uh from the beginning of
[3:56] time all
[3:58] creation uh all creation everything that
[4:01] God created whether it be the moon the
[4:03] stars the Earth the the animals the the
[4:08] plants the whatever it is the fishes in
[4:11] the ocean all had one ultimate goal and
[4:16] purpose amen one ultimate go and purpose
[4:21] and that was that uh which is what I
[4:24] want you to know is that God had this
[4:27] purpose that he wanted to have a bride
[4:31] for himself one that could rule and
[4:35] reign with him amen this is what was in
[4:39] his mind now you understand that first
[4:42] of all uh from We Know by The Prophet's
[4:45] message through for knowledge
[4:49] predestination you know calling
[4:51] justification and then we end up with
[4:54] glorification when we get into Glory
[4:56] we're glorified now by the Holy Spirit
[4:59] the proph said but then you really will
[5:01] have the full total Deliverance when you
[5:04] get into the presence of the Lord
[5:06] however here we are now first we were in
[5:09] the mind of God the mind of God
[5:13] spiritually and then we were in
[5:17] Adam naturally amen because God was
[5:23] displaying in Adam the figure the
[5:26] representation of Adam actually what he
[5:30] was doing or going to do in himself amen
[5:34] So Adam came and when he came he had a
[5:36] bride in him right right amen so God was
[5:40] showing you that from the from from
[5:44] eternity from the Eternal uh ages we
[5:49] were in his mind amen you see we were in
[5:52] his mind we he had a bride in him but
[5:55] his bride was in his mind Adam's bride
[5:58] was in him in his side right is that
[6:01] right but then we understand later on
[6:05] brothers and sisters that there God had
[6:08] to make her manifest so we understand
[6:11] now the next thing
[6:13] is that since we were sat down here I
[6:16] can't dwell on all these of course uh we
[6:20] we we were just like other people we
[6:22] living like everybody else we're just
[6:24] humans we living here we we do
[6:26] everything everybody else did we sin we
[6:28] curse we where we li we lost we
[6:32] whatever whatever but then what actually
[6:36] uh God sent out his has his plan where
[6:41] his children would be born again or
[6:44] salvation by Revelation amen amen so
[6:48] that you will begin to know who you are
[6:52] and understand who you are in other
[6:55] words you start to come into an
[6:57] understanding of the mystery am this
[7:00] mystery the Ages which started way in
[7:05] the Eternal
[7:06] Realms and now we start to get an
[7:10] inkling of an understanding of who we
[7:14] are where we come from who our real
[7:18] parent is amen all right we have natural
[7:21] parents but now we not to understand
[7:25] like brother B said I understand I am
[7:28] not really the child the son of Charles
[7:31] and Elam oh great Jehovah you are my
[7:35] father I'm coming home
[7:38] to you see really God is our
[7:42] parent because we are Eternal as he's
[7:45] Eternal am our natural parents are going
[7:48] to die and they're going to go on unless
[7:51] they were a part of this mystery also
[7:54] see but our father is eternal so an
[7:58] eternal father father Eternal children
[8:01] God being almighty God God goats give
[8:05] you know work to goats horse to horse
[8:08] and God to God God Amen Gods that's why
[8:12] he said you are God Miner Miner in other
[8:16] words you have the same traits you got a
[8:18] creative spirit either you want to paint
[8:20] sing whatever because the spirit of
[8:23] creation is on you doesn't matter who
[8:25] who the child is born they want to
[8:27] create take a stick make a snowman or
[8:30] make a sand man or something because
[8:32] they have a part of God uh in them amen
[8:37] and so God starts by now by loing of the
[8:41] seven seal he starts to give an
[8:44] understanding to us an ining of his plan
[8:48] that he had before the world began and
[8:52] that he is revealing to you your life
[8:54] didn't start 20 30 40 50 years ago you
[9:01] there was no time when you were
[9:03] not right you always in him from before
[9:07] the foundation of the world but then he
[9:11] wanted to make you manifest just like
[9:14] when he wanted to make himself manifest
[9:16] he made a body and he stepped into it
[9:19] right but in this case he used a mother
[9:22] and a father to make that body
[9:24] so you can step into it brother said the
[9:28] moment that get St that spirit from God
[9:31] or wherever it come from goes into that
[9:34] child right so here you are you're now
[9:38] in Earth you are now on Earth Daniel
[9:41] said and I looked and I saw Thrones and
[9:43] crowns cast down from the heavens is US
[9:47] Kings and Priests to God and we come
[9:49] down here but what happened by by mother
[9:52] and father your physical body was made
[9:54] you entered into it but that was not the
[9:57] beginning of your existence no you
[9:59] existed as long as God existed and
[10:02] that's for eternally amen amen amen so
[10:05] now we are starting to understand the
[10:08] mystery praise God and as by the
[10:11] revelation of this message as we
[10:14] understand the Myster that is what
[10:17] causes you to be able to enter what is
[10:20] known as Paul calls it The Fellowship of
[10:23] the mystery right amen because once the
[10:26] genuine Revelation I'm not talking about
[10:29] understanding the message I'm talking
[10:31] about catching the genine revelation of
[10:33] Y breaks upon you and you go behind that
[10:37] Veil and you begin to really catch
[10:40] Revelation from the Holy Spirit feeding
[10:43] you him his own word of breaking apart
[10:47] of himself amen right and feeding
[10:51] himself to you amen Jesus but he's the
[10:53] bread of life yes and he gives a part of
[10:56] himself to you praise the Lord and once
[11:00] you begin to understand that and that
[11:04] begins to take a hold of you then there
[11:08] becomes a separation from unbelief amen
[11:12] praise God what am I talking about you
[11:15] might be in the message M you might be
[11:18] even in the church yeah and then you
[11:20] start talking to a fellow uh message
[11:24] believer and you start talking about
[11:27] what God is doing in your life and your
[11:30] understanding of the word amen and as
[11:33] you you talk you are going to sense I
[11:37] can't explain that to you they're not
[11:40] catching what you're talking about amen
[11:43] they're quoting the same words but
[11:44] they're still not catching what you're
[11:46] talking about it's passing right by
[11:49] they're not understanding it whatsoever
[11:51] then you realize wait a minute you in a
[11:53] different
[11:55] dimension even though we got the same
[11:57] message we talking the same same works
[11:59] we still in the same
[12:01] Dimension and only the people who have
[12:04] caught the Revelation to that level can
[12:08] really Fellowship amen it's like let me
[12:12] illustrate uh you can play with your
[12:16] kids when they're two and three years
[12:19] old but you really can't have fellowship
[12:21] with them you see and so when the
[12:25] believer hasn't really caught the
[12:27] revelation right uh fully and it has
[12:31] gotten a hold of them to the point that
[12:33] it scripped them and will let them go
[12:35] now you can't say you didn't know you
[12:37] don't can't say it was revealed to you
[12:39] you can't escape it now it's got a hold
[12:41] of you amen then you enter into what
[12:45] Paul calls The Fellowship of the mystery
[12:49] right where even if you beet a strange a
[12:52] stranger you mean another believer the
[12:55] first time doesn't matter who they are
[12:57] if they are that same fellowship with
[12:59] the mystery you're going to fit like a
[13:01] hand to the glove amen if not the case
[13:05] you're going to be stalk in the word and
[13:06] then you come up against a wall or you
[13:09] come up against something that's you
[13:11] know goes this way or goes that way or
[13:13] it differs you start to
[13:15] enter into the Fellowship of the mystery
[13:19] you really cannot have a genuine
[13:24] Fellowship in other words it's not
[13:25] gathering together in a crowd is
[13:27] fellowship or oh we got to have a
[13:29] fellowship tonight so there's oh a th
[13:31] people oh it was a great Fellowship that
[13:33] doesn't make it a great Fellowship what
[13:36] makes it a Great Fellowship is when in
[13:38] the words of Isaiah in that day The
[13:41] Watchmen of the walls of Zion will begin
[13:44] to see eye to eye right amen you're
[13:47] going to be right on the word and you
[13:50] start to understand it even if you never
[13:52] heard it before when you heard hear it
[13:54] you going know your spirit I had never I
[13:57] had never heard brother bradle
[14:00] I never heard anything about
[14:02] it but then at 16 years old when that
[14:06] message book come in to come to me stuck
[14:09] on my door and I started to read that
[14:12] thing Serpent scen and all this stuff my
[14:15] God I never heard such a thing I didn't
[14:18] understand it but there was something in
[14:20] me that believed it come on you see not
[14:23] my head but my heart I believed it I
[14:25] believed it before I understood it you
[14:28] see and God is telling you the same
[14:31] thing that uh and even I think it was uh
[14:35] John he said and you have a witness you
[14:38] have something in you that will witness
[14:40] back to the world Amen brother puts it
[14:43] this way the Deep will call to the
[14:46] deepen it'll call right back there
[14:50] something starts going on between you
[14:52] and the word and then when you get to
[14:54] that place you'll feel it even coming
[14:56] from the pulpit it'll go back and forth
[15:00] back and forth between you and the word
[15:03] coming off of the pulpit what is it it's
[15:05] the holy spirit amen be record to the
[15:08] word of God amen amen praise the Lord
[15:13] then after you begin to understand the
[15:15] Fellowship of the mystery and break into
[15:18] it praise the Lord that is when you
[15:22] yourself begin uh to become a revelation
[15:27] of that mystery am I making sense here I
[15:30] don't want to be talking to
[15:31] myself because I get carried away and
[15:35] then you know I just keep
[15:37] talking but you become a revelation of
[15:40] the word you're not going to try to be a
[15:43] Christian no you're not going to try to
[15:46] be to reveal the word you're not going
[15:49] to try to have patience Temperance
[15:51] brotherly kindness godliness oh you got
[15:54] to have perfect love that's good but the
[15:57] fact is who by taking thought can add
[16:01] one cubit to his stature you can't
[16:04] really add one cubit to his stature he
[16:07] said oh but Peter said to your faith add
[16:09] patience add this add that wow what he's
[16:12] talking about is not you going into to
[16:14] make more but it's meaning that you need
[16:17] to grow into the stature of Christ just
[16:20] as much as long as you feed your child
[16:23] they going to be adding height they
[16:24] going to be adding weight they going to
[16:26] be adding wisdom they're going to be you
[16:28] see it's just going to be that way it's
[16:31] not you sticking something onto them a
[16:32] bird feather or a dove feather and
[16:35] telling them they a dove and now they're
[16:37] Christian that's not the way it works
[16:39] it's the word that brings it out and
[16:41] then you just live your life amen
[16:44] naturally super naturally M because the
[16:48] holy spirit in you is going to make your
[16:50] life a supernatural one even though
[16:52] you're living naturally like everybody
[16:54] else amen and so you become a revelation
[16:59] praise God now
[17:01] why because Christ is the mystery of God
[17:05] being
[17:07] reveal but you are you must understand
[17:09] you are a part of him so the headship
[17:14] came and revealed
[17:17] himself now it's the bride part of God
[17:22] that is revealing
[17:25] herself and if you understand uh what
[17:28] I'm really talking about here I really
[17:31] haven't even gotten to it I'm just um
[17:33] give background but the fact is I'm
[17:36] talking about the bride I'm talking
[17:38] about you and I I'm talking about the
[17:40] church the church was a mystery that God
[17:43] hid from Satan and the princes of this
[17:46] world he hid it even from the prophets
[17:48] and the Patriarchs even most of the
[17:51] Jewish Patriarchs did not know that God
[17:54] was going to have a gentile
[17:57] bride because he himself he told the
[18:01] Jews they must marry Jews they must they
[18:03] must marry with their Jewish thing but
[18:06] then if you watch the tipes and the
[18:08] Shadows you watch the very Patriots that
[18:11] are acting out God and dis playing and
[18:15] representing God this one go and marry
[18:19] to an Ethiopian the next one marry a
[18:21] midianite the next one marry a woman
[18:23] from AI you know you what's going on God
[18:26] just told him to marry all within the
[18:29] certain boundary but then you see it's
[18:31] tiped out there amen coming all the way
[18:36] down to fulfill his purpose which is in
[18:39] the book of Acts when Peter said it that
[18:42] this mystery was hi because God was
[18:45] going to call out of the Gentiles a
[18:48] people for his name amen hallelujah a
[18:52] people for his name that we would be
[18:54] married to
[18:56] him praise God that he bypass all others
[19:00] and marry a gentile bride and the times
[19:03] are right there whe it's RAB R you you
[19:06] know you can come you through the Bible
[19:08] yourself he was short it was literally
[19:10] right in front of them and they still
[19:12] couldn't understand because it wasn't
[19:14] the time for it to be made known or to
[19:17] be revealed but now is the time for us
[19:20] to understand so we can enter in The
[19:23] Fellowship of the mystery and recognize
[19:26] we are a part of that
[19:30] and the Bride is a part of the
[19:32] revelation of
[19:34] Christ Hallelujah yes for we are the
[19:37] bright part of him Amen brother puts it
[19:40] this way she is him
[19:43] revealed praise God she is him revealed
[19:47] glory to God hallelujah I'm so glad that
[19:51] I can say I'm amen praise the Lord and
[19:55] every day you know I said wow I read all
[19:58] the books I heard all the Tes my
[20:01] goodness I've gone over the church age
[20:04] books so many times until my church AG
[20:06] book is falling apart from the marks I
[20:09] don't have any more space to put any
[20:11] more notes and everything else and you
[20:13] said well this is it you know it's going
[20:14] to come to it can't come to an end
[20:17] because it's God Amen is all right yes
[20:21] and Revelation keeps unfolding not that
[20:25] it's going to come with something
[20:26] different contrary to the world or
[20:28] mysterious or something like that but it
[20:30] will unfold the same word and make you
[20:33] see it in different lights different
[20:35] angles different colors of the rainbow
[20:38] you know Lightnings Thunders coming off
[20:40] of the Throne of God's word so that you
[20:43] can recognize it's all God amen amen
[20:47] praise the Lord hallelujah so uh first
[20:50] of all we know our place we have to know
[20:53] place that we are we are that mystery of
[20:57] the angel amen you and I that's what was
[21:01] hidden from from the
[21:04] devil that we were going to be here and
[21:06] we were going to be manifesting Christ
[21:10] when you hear Brother speak and say oh
[21:13] the Mighty God unveil before us oh lots
[21:16] of people think it's
[21:18] him right oh the Mighty God unveiled
[21:23] before us the word is now being revealed
[21:26] to us in this hour praise God the Mighty
[21:29] God is on Veil before us he really was
[21:32] pointing to the bride now being on veil
[21:35] by the word that he was preaching amen
[21:38] he was lifting the veil off of her so
[21:40] she could know herself and so people
[21:43] could know her and that she could be
[21:45] made known to the world praise the Lord
[21:47] and it's going on right now because all
[21:49] of the Bride is not in yet Hallelujah so
[21:52] they're still being called out and still
[21:54] being unveiled the unveiling of the
[21:57] might God the unveiling of the Bride is
[22:01] taking place and of course the unveiling
[22:03] of the word is still taking place and of
[22:06] course the Lord himself is still
[22:08] revealing himself amen hallelujah and we
[22:11] are a part of this thing uh like I've
[22:15] said before to you uh not to you
[22:17] personally sister I talk like that and I
[22:20] point I'm not talking to you in
[22:21] eventually but I'm talking to you as a
[22:24] as a group God is up to something big
[22:27] amen and glad I'm a part of it now you
[22:30] know what this something big is and you
[22:34] are a part of that mystery of God now
[22:37] being revealed glory to God hallelujah
[22:41] oh glorious mystery that day he set me
[22:45] free and turn my heart into his very
[22:48] home oh my what an hour what a time what
[22:52] a season that we could know who we are
[22:56] recognize our position and know where we
[22:59] are
[23:00] going hallelujah amen this is not my
[23:05] chance it didn't happen unanticipated
[23:08] but let me mention when you come down as
[23:11] an eternal spirit your mom and your dad
[23:13] were used by God produced the body you
[23:16] entered in it and right away you become
[23:19] trapped in
[23:22] time I think it's in the future home
[23:25] brother gram said trapped in a body all
[23:28] time amen calls it a city so you're
[23:32] trapped we got trapped in this body now
[23:35] why would he say trap because your
[23:38] spirit was like God's spirit there was
[23:40] no
[23:41] walls there I mean the wall wouldn't be
[23:44] an object for you to see beyond it or

[25:01] certainty just as much as H2O is water
[25:03] doesn't matter how you work the formula
[25:05] is got to come back to water and if you
[25:08] are a part of him you're coming back to

[25:36] he shed the blood the blood was shed to
[25:39] eradicate to erase to wipe away
[25:43] everything the devil will do to try to
[25:46] upset God's plan he can't do it God oh
[25:51] if the princes of this world knew they
[25:53] would never crucify the Lord of glory
[25:57] amen we are not here by
[25:59] accident glory to God Amen you
[26:02] understand that he's been building this
[26:05] image this body uh through endless ages

[26:12] amen you and I are God's Masterpiece
[26:15] here we are the Masterpiece of God look
[26:19] we are going to have un bailing when we
[26:22] come to the end praise God now we hid
[26:26] amongst all the other people people
[26:28] right now we hidden amongst them but
[26:30] there's going to be a day when we going
[26:31] to be unveiled by the great artist and
[26:34] the world will recognize us for who we
[26:36] are amen praise the Lord glory to God
[26:39] hallelujah amen amen you can read Romans
[26:43] 8 and Ephesians
[26:45] 1 glory to God
[26:48] hallelujah amen now First Corinthians 27
[26:52] and 8 said but we speak
[26:55] wisdom even his
[26:58] wisdom which for God ordained before the
[27:02] world unto our Glory you understand what
[27:05] that means that God hidden the word the
[27:08] revelation of the word hidden wisdom
[27:11] hidden before the foundation of the
[27:13] world knowing that his genuine children
[27:17] when they have caught that hidden
[27:20] wisdom it glorifies them it giv it
[27:25] glorifies them puts you into a when
[27:28] glorified which none of the princes of
[27:32] this world
[27:33] knew for had they know it they would not
[27:38] have broken the seven
[27:41] seal they would not have uh crucified
[27:46] the Lord Of Glory of course what I'm
[27:48] saying there is that physically he was
[27:50] the Seal of the Father the father was in
[27:55] him and when he got crucified of Calvary
[27:58] it was a symbol or a type also that one
[28:02] day he the seven seal would be
[28:07] broken and the blood that was in that
[28:10] seal like it was physically shed back
[28:13] there would now be shed or set free
[28:18] praise the Lord so that you could
[28:20] receive it brother R said of course we
[28:22] know the blood it's not the red blood
[28:24] back there he said it's the Holy Ghost
[28:27] right it's the Holy Ghost amen and the
[28:31] church is the blood of Christ by the
[28:33] holy spirit being in her amen hallelujah
[28:38] what allows you to catch this mystery
[28:40] except a man be born again amen he
[28:43] cannot see the kingdom of God hallelujah
[28:48] then again he said uh in the same uh
[28:51] chapter except a man be born again he
[28:54] cannot enter the kingdom of God you can
[28:57] go read it in John chapter 3 two times
[28:59] he talks about being born again and the
[29:02] effects of being born again is forced to
[29:05] make you see and then to make you enter
[29:07] Because if you can't see how you going
[29:09] to find the door to enter you first of
[29:11] all have to give you Revelation open
[29:13] your eyes open your understanding and
[29:15] then you can enter praise God salvation
[29:17] is by Revelation glory to God Amen so
[29:21] now listen to this the apostles they had
[29:24] to catch the Revelation before they can
[29:26] break in
[29:27] that's what happened to them them under
[29:29] their Pentecost listen Ephesians
[29:33] 3:9 Paul
[29:35] speaking and to make all men see what is
[29:40] the Fellowship of the mystery which from
[29:43] the beginning of the world have been hid
[29:47] in God who created All Things by Jesus
[29:51] Christ Hallelujah glory to God so God's
[29:56] ultimate goal
[29:58] was to create uh some persons to inhabit
[30:04] eternity with him someone that he could
[30:08] share with and have fellowship with and
[30:11] that he could love and I would love him
[30:14] praise the Lord hallelujah thank god
[30:17] brother and sister that we are the
[30:19] children of God Amen not uh not an
[30:25] animal not a beast not something else
[30:28] because you fellowship with something on
[30:30] your own level of
[30:32] being right you can't fellowship with a
[30:35] monkey or a parot that only can repeat
[30:38] the message you you can't fellowship
[30:41] with my or or something else you have to
[30:44] fellowship with a being on the same
[30:47] level amen praise the Lord amen so here
[30:50] it is amen God had a desire to have a
[30:54] bride from way back there and like I
[30:57] told you he has been working on that
[31:01] right through all these endless ages
[31:03] amen and that is the mystery of the ages
[31:06] not only tracing the serpent seed but
[31:09] tracing the seed of righteousness that's
[31:11] coming down right on Amen the mystery of
[31:15] godliness coming right from Genesis from
[31:18] eternity down to Genesis right on to
[31:21] this very time the mystery of godliness
[31:25] praise God hallelujah amen so that is
[31:29] why we have been
[31:32] predestinated to be here in this season
[31:35] and in this time for this hour and we
[31:39] are the last
[31:40] part of God's body that was being built
[31:44] through the ages of the body of the
[31:46] second Adam the second Adam's wife being
[31:49] built Through the Ages we are the last
[31:51] part of it right because he started way
[31:54] back there with Paul of them praise God
[31:57] and started building that body and then
[31:59] you know the devil tried to give him a
[32:01] setback in the Dark Ages and stuff and
[32:03] then you know he continued his job and
[32:06] brother Bron goes through that is
[32:08] showing you stature of a perfect man
[32:10] until we come right down to this last
[32:13] Church age that we are in Ephesians uh
[32:17] says here in whom also we have obtained
[32:21] an inheritance being
[32:24] predestinated according to the purpose
[32:26] of his him that worketh all things after
[32:30] the comfor of his will praise God
[32:34] predestinated we are the bride is called
[32:37] what the family of
[32:40] God family of God blood relations in
[32:43] other words it's like the Bible he's
[32:45] telling you your blood relations with
[32:47] him you are part of the family of God
[32:51] Amen God's blood is Spirit the Holy
[32:53] Spirit brother V say God doesn't have
[32:56] chemical blood he went into a body so
[32:58] that you could recognize that he bled
[33:00] something out but when he when that
[33:03] bleeding was finished he said he gave up
[33:05] the ghost right and the Holy Ghost is
[33:08] the token which is the spirit blood if
[33:11] you want to say it that way of God Amen
[33:14] that's made available to us now and we
[33:16] are the family of God Amen Hallelujah
[33:21] but not only are your family the bride
[33:23] is described as the God's house many
[33:26] scriptures no he not through the temple
[33:28] and so on many many scriptures
[33:30] Revelation when it says for the
[33:32] habitation of God is not with man and I
[33:35] will dwell in them and walk in them and
[33:38] I they shall be my people and I will be
[33:41] their God hallelujah so we are the house
[33:43] of God but listen any house being built
[33:47] has to have a foundation that's right is
[33:50] that right if you going to build a
[33:52] building it has to have a foundation if
[33:54] you're going to build even a family that
[33:57] has to have a
[33:58] foundation any individual their
[34:01] character has to have a
[34:03] foundation amen or just be wish Wasing
[34:06] you got to have a foundation even in
[34:08] your character praise be to God
[34:11] hallelujah and the building the family
[34:15] the the
[34:17] individual and their life or their
[34:21] existence is going to be no better than
[34:25] the foundation of what which it
[34:29] rests foundations are important
[34:32] amen because you're want to BU a super
[34:35] structure which is why Jesus
[34:37] illustration illustration about God
[34:39] building on the sand the other one
[34:41] building on the Rock be cure what you
[34:43] build on Paul speaks and said be careful
[34:45] what you build onless when you come to
[34:47] an end you finish the building and you
[34:48] think it's okay you know and it's tested
[34:51] by fire it's tested by this and that the
[34:54] whole thing crumbles because you didn't
[34:56] pay attention
[34:57] to your foundation to make sure it was
[35:00] the genuine revelation of the
[35:03] hour and that is what you're built on
[35:06] the foundation praise the Lord amen and
[35:09] so we know that the foundation of this
[35:13] entire mystery is the revelation of who
[35:16] Jesus is amen his the ENT the
[35:20] identification of our Lord Jesus Christ
[35:22] that is not just a prophet he's not a
[35:24] passing scholar he's not a philosopher
[35:27] he's not just the wise man he's not the
[35:30] greatest salesman in the world he's not
[35:32] the deepest Lodge man he's not the
[35:35] wisest teacher but he is the god of the
[35:40] prophets amen God come down to be his
[35:43] own Propet Jesus amen almighty God one
[35:48] God and his name is Jesus Christ amen
[35:51] and everything is built on that you see
[35:54] uh if the the picture of the pyramid
[35:57] glory to God uh the picture of the
[36:00] pyramid uh that we usually have up there
[36:03] it starts with the slier and the
[36:06] foundation brother R put Jesus Christ
[36:09] amen hallelujah so that's the foundation
[36:12] that we built on praise God but we're
[36:15] not building on the man Jesus Christ
[36:18] because Jesus came to do what Ral the
[36:21] father or reveal God we're building on
[36:24] the revelation of who he is flesh and
[36:27] blood has not revealed on but my Father
[36:31] in Heaven has revealed on you amen and
[36:34] Upon This Rock I'll build my church and
[36:37] the gates of H not against the
[36:40] revelation of who he is praise the Lord
[36:43] hallelujah amen so the entire mystery of
[36:47] the genuine true church rests not
[36:54] on itn't rest on
[36:58] indulgences 1 Stations of the Cross it
[37:02] doesn't rest upon any history of man it
[37:07] rests entirely upon the
[37:10] foundations of the Apostles and the
[37:14] prophet and the Great Indian chief chief
[37:19] Corone uh is built on him Christ the
[37:23] Chief
[37:24] Cornerstone the one rejected
[37:27] the stone a great preacher by the name
[37:30] of I believe his name was uh J Parker
[37:33] preached a message called uh the
[37:35] rejected Stone and what he said is
[37:38] notice in the Scripture it says the
[37:41] stone the Builder is rejected he says
[37:43] these were not ignorant people these
[37:46] were trained Builders they're supposed
[37:49] to know how to recognize the good Stone
[37:53] and the properly place it when they're
[37:55] building something but for some reason
[37:58] they looked at this Stone and don't bite
[38:00] it and they just didn't include it in
[38:03] their building and you know whatever re
[38:05] built is got is going to all come down
[38:07] soety is going to come down every
[38:09] structure that man builds is coming down
[38:12] the world is falling apart and the only
[38:14] thing that will stand is the word of our
[38:18] God that will stand forever forever 1
[38:22] Corinthians 3
[38:25] 10-13 amen
[38:26] [Music]
[38:30] according to what God has given unto me
[38:33] as a wise master builder I have laid the
[38:36] foundation and another bill there on
[38:39] what's he talking about Paul already
[38:40] knew other Messengers will come after
[38:43] you and that he would do his job and
[38:47] leave a foundation the next messenger
[38:50] was come and build on that the next one
[38:52] will come and build on that and build on
[38:55] that but I am laying
[38:57] my part now as a wise master builder
[39:00] praise God you see and another build it
[39:03] there on but let every man take heed how
[39:09] he builds there on hallelujah praise the
[39:12] Lord what is he saying there he saying
[39:14] stay in the
[39:16] word be careful how you're building and
[39:19] don't move away from the word be careful
[39:23] how you build on the foundation that I
[39:26] done
[39:27] for other Foundation can no man lay
[39:30] there is no other Foundation that you
[39:32] can lay it's got to be as as Isaiah said
[39:37] word brother BR said word on top of word
[39:40] Isaiah said it word on top of word here
[39:42] a little there a little here a little
[39:44] there a little but it's got to be word
[39:45] on top of word it can't be anything else

[40:30] shields of brass and and the entire
[40:33] thing become a mockery that's the type
[40:35] of the modern church the church how been
[40:37] going through the ages and devaluing the
[40:40] word of God right devaluing the word of
[40:42] God until now you know that they valued
[40:44] it to such a point that when you try to
[40:46] share it with people they think there's
[40:48] no value to their life listening to any
[40:50] Bible or any picture or or anything to
[40:52] them they don't think there's any value
[40:54] to it there's the value that effectively
