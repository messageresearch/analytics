mean if you look at the verge of building our tradition and it might not be so great you might leave the same way to became a of any worse but coming into his presence as individuals you have your walk with us thirst 108 by day speaking to reveal that's all personal through the message of the hour that needs to be come to us you didn't say that he said I'll be with you and I'll be in you so if we look back at the same one that what the Sea of Galilee and he walks through the pages of the Bible and we see what he did he said I'll be with you and in you to the end of the time amen so he's consciously revealing himself to us now if he's if you're not hearing from him if you're not seeing him or here it is voice clearly than there's something clogging up the tent amen that's what we're going to talk about a little bit about to make a mint avoiding spiritual amnesia title we're going to turn to Ephesians 1:3 we got to scriptures readings here this Bible study tonight be a little patient with me had just you know we all work today I just take minutes a lot of the Chicago I'm standing up here so let's all work together and drive this tiredness and thing away from us let's get refreshed in the work I'm Billy I can easy sometimes you know it's not for me to get their imagination because I'm coming in during really delayed and I got no sleep at all and what I'm just saying tonight leave I feel that my body about say leave up what this work first that's what we have to do sometimes I look beyond natural you know infirmities and something that I want the Word of God they meant Olivia the faeces one three does it be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ have blessed us with all spiritual blessings they say some are all all in heavenly places in Christ accorded as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love we just got to read these two just read the Word of God in this sea we don't have to do much park but minister the Bible says is bringing you into of what has already been said spoken by the Apostles by the Prophet our prophet and the Lord Jesus Christ himself that's it they been having predestinated us unto adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he had made us accepted in the beloved were already accepted in whom we have redemption through his blood and forgiveness of sin according to the riches of His grace where he had come towards us all wisdom and prudence how to make known unto us the mystery of his will for he's made known unto us he's forgiven us wisdom according to the his good pleasure that he had purposed in himself so he purposed in himself that he was going to do everything that he was he was going to do to us that the dispensation of the fullness of times might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven which are earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to its purpose to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will through the council is in our lives so this is speaking of him what is speaking of us is speaking of the Dominion he has in us and what he's done for us when he surrender our will to him we surrender our lives to him then we come under this promise this blessing amen 2nd Peter 1 verse 8 to 15 or if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall never be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ Wow never but he a lot of these things is blind and cannot see afar and had forgotten that he was was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather being given disease to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall that's what we want to talk about and he says of mine is a mental amnesia dementia Alzheimer's disease is a medical disease that's what we's Liebman the prophecy is an insane age and this is all connected to the mind amen and forgetting is the biggest part of if you the science of it forgetting forgetting things it's all above the mind well we're gonna see how it connects to its later or so and interests that we ministered up to you the monthly into the devil hasta kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ where her eye I will not be militant to put you in always in remembrance of these things though he know them you see when you say here I must put you in remembrance of all these things though you know them that's why the works that he preached the message has not decreased the quotes going to be preached over and over and over those what he's doing know them and be is fabulous in the present truth yet I think it meet as long as I'm in this contact to the stirrup by put you in remembrance again remembrance know that surely I was put off this power that even as the Lord Jesus Christ has shown me over I endured dirt that gave me be able after my decease to have these things always and remembers Wow they have us pray father thank you for your love bracelet thank you for bringing us all the way sin remembers so many times this world pulls us in so many different directions but you come by your word by the prophet the voice of God these last days and you bring these things that you've spoken trusting in our endeavors and that's what quickest us that's what strengthens us and that's what gives us Lord the ability to move and press on into the image that you have prepared for us that's what the absolute feeds off of that's what the attribute father grows by the Word of God Lord as we bring things into remembers tonight may you bless us quickness lift us up into heavenly places Lord father we how do we receive anything unless we're in the spirit of the Word of God tonight and that's where Stedman Lord the Word of God to breathe personally into our lives might an open up to us Lord and put everything aside and expect the Living God fulfill his promises I expect you to come to my lord I expect you to use me eyes to reveal things more I expect you to bless your people are open to be blessed tonight Lord and I pray for each one forgive us of our sins yes may the blood Jesus Christ the everlasting covenant Lord as we heard on Sunday washes and cleanse us tonight Lord let me come boldly before your throne even though Satan is putting condemnation and guilt and from our mistakes leaving our sins we can come boldly nothing more than the blood stands between us and there above Jesus Christ and then Lord we can expect signs wonders and miracles yes in the simple serves like this signs wonders and miracles and we can lead different and changed he'd rather father in Jesus name we pray amen you may be seated I realize what this message together I got a few minutes they sign of increasing up ahead but we all do I just hit on some things tonight but there's so much in this series that would make a serious offer because it's it's a day that we're living it this age that we're living it it's the Battle of the pepperball true that we're facing every day brother Graham says the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind and this is where where you talk about in the greatest pilot reply talk about the victory of the life of Jesus Christ a victory unraveled has to come by the spine overcome because the mind is not what it is the channel is not what it is but the Word of God comes to the - holding to the mind and then it comes down to the channel and when the light comes down to the channel and everything is cleared out and purged out then the life of Christ comes and that's what we want we want the life of Christ in this last day we don't want religion we don't want a Pentecostal faith we want this faith the original faith the truth baby amen and in order for that to happen the channel has to be cleared up and too many times we're finding people that they're not people from here sir God every day I see here up to here for myself that has get worse and worse and last words people are becoming insane where I believe and Trust at times where I see people I'm not looking the other way because you see the uncertainty and being in possession I'm talking the church where there's a life problems happening and we must have the mind of Christ we must renew our mind in Christ in the Word of God daily we really realized and powered the forces of darkness is the evil that is out there of unbelief we're program since we have been driving a little bit of length because in this dangerous old godless yes religion yes big churches but but this no like openness to live the life of Christ or come lives have be mold and shape into Pacific including to the church our personality but in His image demon that's what this is all about that's what preaching the Word of God comes for and then what you sit in these pews what are you coming to church and I see I look at this right by something change me to the bone that I know I think pure Word of God I got no excuse each and every one of us have heard enough we have no excuse you're not put on this word to not overcome to not press it to the kingdom I don't care how young you I don't care for their teenager it doesn't matter God speaks to all the many cities all ages all ages because he said I won't lose one and we don't learn a lot space hallelujah and Matthew 16 you know the scripture is what we're going to go over them he said up to them but whom say ye that I am the Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God Jesus has said blessed art thou simon petrikov flesh and blood has not revealed about you but my father which is heaven and I say unto thee thou art Peter and upon this rock revelation I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it I will give you unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatever else shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven now think about it he was given the keys we are keeping the keys the keys a thing and he says the gates of Hell will not prevail against the revelation and he also said 100 you say whatever you find Luce will be done but these are under conditions of Revelation these are under conditions that that word of God is come to you and you have come under beatings to that word of God what has been revealed spirituality Jie brother branham talking here just trying to find my study here that's so easy today and we forget sometimes what a Christian Church is we act like the world that shows that we got spiritual amnesia because now you don't act like that the Christian you're supposed to be you act like the world you receive the heart of the world and it causes this here we find that Israel had exposed to the world and had fell into its run and this prophet was sent to dig them out of it if we could I would tell them God by His grace chose Israel all the rest of the families of the earth Greece had did that he didn't give them the choice when he gave them houses that they never built God did that he gave them parks that they never want he eat the food that they never planted he gave them wells that they never done he gave you the victories and they never won he gave them grace that they never married God did that by His grace or his people his nose [Music] [Music] [Music] where we see that all things work together for good we place ourselves and 2018 today here without his race it's impossible I wanna describe here what that is now we're taught absolute eggs of spiritual brother breath he preached the message the spiritual amnesia it's going to be do you really good PTA is the state of confusion that occurs of meal inequality a traumatic brain injury TBI in which the entry person is deep disoriented and not able to remember events that occurred not with the injury the person may be unable to state his or her name with meat or she is and what type today's is the continuous memory returns PTA is considered to have result resolved why PTA blacks new events cannot be stored in the memory now type all the spiritual I want you just the soak it in because that's the message lost on you understand a little bit more about the third about a third of patients with black head injuries are reported to have islands of memories in which the patient can recall only some events during PTA the faces conscious is clouded remember brother Graham talk about that evil he's an eagle they said the cover was covered over his eyes his ways talk about where you can't see that evil because PTA involves confusion in addition to the memory loss typically of amnesia the term post-traumatic confusional state and and proposed as an ultimatum Deuteronomy 9 7 remember and forget not how bogus the Lord I thought to wrap in the wilderness from the day that thou eatest depart out of the land of Egypt until he came to the place he had been really rebellious against the Lord the Lord speaking here how can two walk together unless they agree Amos 3:3 the more you know who you are in Christ the more your behavior will reflect your true identity do not be conformed to this world now that does me just worldly things but the world Cosmo and every single one of us finally they by name because they are in the world were not moved beyond the world of one where in the world were tempted to be like the world pretended to think like the world but you see when we mix with the world you say brother - I don't got DJ I got a visa when you mix with the things of the world they're coming on your spiritual amnesia to the revelation of the word not to the alcohol the swab tube to lift an effective personal life you need to know and believe who you are in Christ in Christ it's critical to the lipid life as of God intended you to live the best way to renew your mind and experience the inner transformation is my know that thinking and speaking out loud the revelation God is giving you in this hour of who you are in Christ when you look through the message when I study to the message there's nothing I can see but the word coming to us to identify us [Music] because remember Jesus enough when he was in this healthy that peasant he knew all things even as a child he knew all things he was the plan he did my box no movie what we what we were born on desert but there's something inside of us say more than this this like it cost you to speak to us because it was the afternoon that held up in a we need us time you look at your life the situation around what was taking place because in this ears around there was an awakening there was a resurrection community arrived and I meet you in person with a gun I don't know I first heard the word of God I found out when I study here I don't need to accomplish much but the first thing I heard was the scripture that spoke to me and said you must repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and that ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost when I heard that for the first time the blogs about the church religion that struck me so tell me why did you start to break there was an awakening to the seat of God what take place to return this word of God's sake this afternoon what it's gotta be the word got one for the GMB shall wait for me what's going to keep all these medical illnesses away from me both naturally is fiercely the Word of God did feed on the word that made don't tell me you just I just read it to you I know all these things but the Bible says the Apostle said bring these things and remember lastly to the saints of God because this world is so designed that make you forget this work is so designed to get your mind in such a place amnesia and that's when you forget who you are how many people are backslidden how many people are forsaken and why would the Lord what has he done they were sitting in the Word of God and they love spiritual media to cover the more or less the work nobody helped it unless you know your spiritual and lets you fall don't think you don't know unless you fall keep in the Word of God keep in the things that you know keep in listening to the Word of God the over and over seems to know everything about amnesia amnesia but that we do it has nothing told to you from the beginning the Holy One is great and strengthen money and power it's understanding is unsearchable Isaiah 40 21 it seems like ever since the beginning of time we keep forgetting that did not indeed they have everything they could ever want or vote for in the Garden of Eden and did not tell them to enjoy it all except one thing that tree when that was in the middle of the garden and how that we seemed fine went out until the serpent came along and tempted Eve to forget the whole of God at your school think about think about something so long [Music] stay in the work in a team or puckered darker the word Essenes intense us so much he Burgess us down it causes a heart beating heart situations are situations you ever experienced wave after wave after wave of things you're like Joe Blow this guy Oh Treasure Island less you can see when season you start growing into the Lord then you start fighting you start growing in this grace I think they can't get you can't make you hold this way on that way goes to your kids be dozen babies not you because that's what is designed as that's wearing good weight there becomes the sodium for weeks financially aside one it is lesson God's death that's the message said that the complexion as they said little do these things how they sitting over deliver unacceptable Dido let's get into it a little bit first Timothy 4:1 now spirit speaks expressly that Mohammed I shall some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils optimism that was speaking lies and a prophecy a pathetic conscious snare with the higher net what a condition to get into forbidden to marry and commanding to abstain from meats which God had created to receive the Thanksgiving with them was believed not well the truth for every creature of God is good enough to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving or an ascetic life by the Word of God and prayer it out put the Brethren in remembrance of these things else would be a good minister of Jesus Christ nourished up in the words of faith and a food doctrine where in two thousand tendons in Ephesians one of the cravings and desires of our flesh every thought was evil and being dead in transgressions when our sins and we live and follow the ways of the world and the spirit and is working in the some were such a bust that's the way we were the way you were the greatest sin or the represents a locking prayer Locker read about the consecration dedication for the Word of God they're hungry for the word of God but here the different spirit a great spirit here and this thing in this age and this love America and we need to wake up and realize that were in huh I mean we sing it over and over and it loves people's lives were still beginning around people's lives like it could be that they eat he was alive but not overcome and that they should be was live and that growth and each other then there's something wrong Haga and we want to lead people there Christ we can't see each other we haven't eaten Oh Satan and God you've overcome yourself no but God brings us up to sit with him in heavenly realms I search the seat my experience every day and my empty places my friends I'm not talking about the thousands when you go through about three year old company of praying here into distress you're not really thinking about it in empty places or not but we're not always walking miles to that extreme we have quiet time where we have to examine our self bias that they stand with your self procedure in the faith that's a constant reminder the word of the mind not I read once I examine myself I came into the message did not rebuke them self they said a palpable a stop and that's all I have to do to go to a constant examine yourself where are you today in that region the Bible says except your faith accepted the things that are written accepted what is this spoken of you as c4 be in that faith the upper transform the seed of his word and there's only one thing that can quick in the word and that is the spirit for it is life the life giver to the word and when the light is in the word and meets the life of the Spirit it reduces whatever the seat is now notice what happens here and the governor being in the ignominy of innocence that was the what dispensation the first is the station was innocent that people know no sin they didn't know anything about sinning both I would Eve were needed but they were hit on their nakedness by the spirit veil over their faces it's not what's most producing Las Vegas again the same experience that being on the talking natural lots lucky in the natural I'm talking about because of the word of God family had not there in the natural and they didn't know that they were needed wool it do it in the spiritual care think about what kind of veil is over your life over your mind we're thinking of your interpretation carnival carnality flexp worthy or is it the Word of God Christ who you are they knew they never knew that they were naked at all because they were hidden for God fail in their own minds they didn't know what right and what was they only knew what the Word of God was we have these things if we think that is because your thinking is wrong it is perverted by the devil or if you love the world order or the things of this present world is because the love of God is not even a new remember that Oh God look and see what you're looking into like season at the beginning when he come to the Garden of Eden he could not dig up those seeds he could not destroy them but he sprayed them with poison and in the form the seed in didn't bring forth it's right kind back then it deported the original seed some truth and God has promised in these last days there will be arrived he because he the prophets of the Balcon seen one failure after another he came up here because we estimated to be in her to overcome I cry and to remembers of who she is [Music] foresee a spirit of god and the spirit because all things Mustang news of the Holy Ghost when the Spirit of Truth has come it will not do to lead you into war in your life and your walk and your journey in that you need to overcome Sego 3625 he meant by the study here today Rena lobster juice a lot of quotes the brake assembly member Cooley on then under sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness from all you - I will cleanse you a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh now listen listen and I will give you a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you and cause you to walk in my statutes and my judgments and do them and and I gave to your father's our father Abraham the father of eight the food that is given us the same journey of world of Spira see that Abraham was on and ye shall be my people and I will be your God and I will also save you from all uncleanness and I tell you for the court and will increase it and [Music] [Music] [Music] we fret we fight we did this we circle for that we start going off the trail then we see the girls - in that condition Danny pumps dislike for the granite with his wife and his child I and he sit there and say Caitlin that time of course always have to be decided because always when try to hurt me down situations in your life maybe not win every battle Jake comes and says they've got posts all these things to you and look what you're doing these files you preach like nobody else and he lets your life we cha what we can see at that point in time they're all killed for us you know realized every story everything the Prophet went through was given to us in our lives and we can reflect we can take something of it we look back at that time when I read that life story I started weeping and crying every single time because I put myself in his position I feel the pain he felt any person yeah yeah you're right yeah you're right I understand why you say that because of the condition that he seen about time and it's the same God for her conditions but the Bible says be still he know that I know he still he raised up inside of him he did go back up the world but he said yes yes yes you're right great but something raised up inside them it was the new bird he said it was the real birth [Music] [Music] we need to give ourselves out of the way more times than not when dealing with an internal external struggle we just have to learn to get our own way thinking about it often do we find yourself struggling to make something work or happen in your timing danger and your picture and your picture only to later realize that you are violating the principles of the vine timing in your life
