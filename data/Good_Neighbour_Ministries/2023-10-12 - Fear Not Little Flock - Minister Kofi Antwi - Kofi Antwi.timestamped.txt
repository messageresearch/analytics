[20:40] but God is up to something big always as
[20:45] our beloved pastor says and I want to be
[20:48] a part of it you must be a part of it so
[20:53] I won't delay
[20:55] tonight we will go into the scriptures
[20:58] please thank you so much for your
[21:02] contribution every single one of you
[21:05] that support Good
[21:08] Neighbor with your
[21:11] support
[21:13] uh my
[21:15] scripture will be
[21:18] taken from Luke
[21:21] 12
[21:24] 32
[21:26] and first John
[21:28] 3 chapter
[21:32] 1 uh Tim please can you play for us
[21:36] tonight before I
[21:39] start yeah lead us in
[21:46] prayer yes
[21:52] Lord yes
[21:55] Lord yes Lord
[22:03] yes
[22:04] Lord yes
[22:11] Lord
[22:14] amen Luke
[22:17] 1232 which will be my topic it
[22:21] says fear not little
[22:24] flock for it is your father good good
[22:28] pleasure to give you the
[22:34] kingdom and first
[22:37] John
[22:40] 3:1 behold what manner of love the
[22:45] father had bestowed upon us that we
[22:51] should be call the sons of God therefore
[22:57] the the world
[23:00] knowth knowth us not because it knew him
[23:07] not may the Lord had his Blessing please
[23:10] be
[23:13] seated fear
[23:16] not why is it that any time in human
[23:23] race the Lord or angel of God will
[23:28] appear onto Humanity the first word the
[23:32] angel will speak is fear fear not
[23:36] because in knew human heart there's
[23:39] always
[23:42] fear fear is something even the animals
[23:47] when they want to catch one
[23:49] another you see the animal that wanted
[23:53] to catch the strong one that wanted to
[23:56] catch the weak one
[23:58] he always put
[24:02] fear in these days if you watch the
[24:07] church and the world the world is in
[24:12] fear that is the ttic the enemy is
[24:17] using people can't come to
[24:20] church or can progress in their life is
[24:25] all because of what fear
[24:29] because when you
[24:32] fear you can't progress in natural
[24:35] life when you are a
[24:38] Christian and you allow the devil to put
[24:41] fear on you you cannot progress the way
[24:46] God want you to
[24:48] progress because fear is
[24:53] something we have to get out from from
[24:59] and you cannot do it unless you are a
[25:03] seed of God and you
[25:06] recognize that at this hour you are
[25:10] portion of the root of David that have
[25:14] to be made
[25:16] flesh then once you recognize it it
[25:21] takes the fear from
[25:24] you then you begin to know who you are
[25:28] what you are rais up
[25:30] for then the enemy no matter what he
[25:34] bring on
[25:36] you he can't overcome
[25:39] you because you'll be strong like a like
[25:43] an eagle wanted to catch
[25:46] hyena the the the devil is the hyena
[25:50] Eagle is not hyena but when hyena see
[25:54] the eagle he is running for cover when
[25:58] the devil see you like our pastor says
[26:02] when you become a hot
[26:04] potato right the devil can't handle
[26:09] you because God you have know who you
[26:13] are
[26:14] am you know that God didn't raise you
[26:20] just to be an a
[26:21] chicken or just to come to ordinary
[26:25] church because these days the churches
[26:28] have so many coming going coming going
[26:32] people have stay in the church long but
[26:34] they don't know who they are they coming
[26:36] and they going but you become so certain
[26:40] of
[26:42] God because you
[26:44] know that you
[26:47] know because God has made known to you
[26:52] that's why the Lord himself said fear
[26:56] not it is your father pleasure to give
[27:00] you the
[27:02] kingdom what is the kingdom the kingdom
[27:04] is the word of
[27:06] God and it's within you
[27:10] Hallelujah the kingdom is the word of
[27:12] God and God says the kingdom of God is
[27:15] within you so you have to recognize who
[27:19] you
[27:20] are what you are here for what is your
[27:25] purpose on
[27:26] Earth
[27:28] do you know when you recognize who you
[27:31] are no matter how situation appear in
[27:35] your life you are not shaken by it you
[27:39] are not worried about it as this man
[27:43] outside man here will be always
[27:47] worryed that's his
[27:49] job but I'm not talking about the
[27:52] outside man I'm talking about the Inner
[27:56] Man the in man has no revealed to
[28:01] you that God you are one of the little
[28:06] FL because not Jesus said many are
[28:10] called few are chosen if you are one of
[28:13] the chosen one God made known to you and
[28:18] it become R to you who you really are no
[28:22] man can take it from
[28:24] you it's not a church give you eternal
[28:28] life it's not your father give you
[28:31] eternal life it's not your mother give
[28:34] you eternal life your husband give you
[28:37] eternal life you could wear long dress
[28:40] up to here you could wear long hair up
[28:43] to your long hair up to down here and
[28:47] don't paint your face it's all good but
[28:51] that does not make you a
[28:56] Christian Christian you were born as a
[29:01] Christian because when Jacob even while
[29:06] he was yet in his mother womb he has not
[29:10] stepped up to the Earth God says I love
[29:14] Jacob I hate Esau when
[29:19] job was sick all kinds of boy the Lord
[29:24] revealed to him when the Sons and
[29:26] Daughters of God
[29:28] shout for Joy where were you
[29:32] job where were
[29:35] you job saw himself
[29:39] there that he was a part of
[29:43] God do you know when you begin to see
[29:46] that for
[29:48] yourself put
[29:50] yourself into that
[29:53] condition you will see all things that
[29:57] that are not
[29:58] good that used to hold you begin to
[30:01] leave you yes let me tell you it doesn't
[30:05] matter what happen once you have this
[30:09] breath in you and you are walking on the
[30:14] head there's no time your head going to
[30:17] walk down because you know why the
[30:20] perfect one has come and reveal himself
[30:24] to you you become set
[30:29] you know this Bible become a new Bible
[30:33] unto
[30:34] you the Bible become new Bible to you
[30:37] now when you reading the Bible you're
[30:40] not reading it like the way you used to
[30:42] read or you listen to the tape of
[30:45] brother Braham you not listening to it
[30:47] like that or reading it like that letter
[30:50] to the letter but you are seeing
[30:54] yourself in the in the script scripture
[30:57] brother thank you you finish it for me
[31:00] you look into the mirror what did you
[31:02] look brother BR says when you look into
[31:05] the mirror what did you
[31:08] see do you see yourself this is the
[31:12] mirror the mirror of God word hallelujah
[31:16] when you look into it what do you see do
[31:20] you see
[31:21] anybody or
[31:23] yourself and who knows you better than
[31:26] yourself
[31:27] when God made known to you let me tell
[31:32] you there's no
[31:33] fear fear run from
[31:37] you because fear is of the
[31:41] devil fear is not of God let me tell
[31:47] you when even you don't have money you
[31:51] are not
[31:52] shaking you are not panicking you speak
[31:55] it you know you're going to get it
[31:59] because you know what everything God
[32:02] have for you is there already before you
[32:05] came here and you speak the things God
[32:09] have for you and bring it to
[32:13] you before you seen
[32:15] it because you listen let me tell you me
[32:21] I believe God God is real to me God
[32:28] I may not be a big preacher or that that
[32:31] but let me tell you
[32:33] Norman the point I reach can deceive me
[32:37] on the scriptures you can deceive me on
[32:40] the letter form but in inside my soul
[32:44] God speak to me and The God Who lead me
[32:49] from Africa jungle straight down all the
[32:54] way to North Africa come right to Europe
[32:57] come right to Canada
[33:00] Toronto you think that God will will let
[33:04] me
[33:05] down sir you think now you're going to
[33:08] let me down sir he's read to me as you
[33:12] are
[33:13] sitting he so real to me I'll go down my
[33:18] knees when I go down my knees I open my
[33:22] heart to him said Lord I don't know this
[33:27] this brother says so this sister says so
[33:29] this if I'm wrong I'm ready to repent so
[33:33] father show me let me tell you God does
[33:36] not lie I lie you lie any human being
[33:41] lie God is the only one that has in lie
[33:45] he will come he knows my heart better
[33:48] than any
[33:50] Humanity God knows my
[33:54] heart no human because we human being we
[33:59] hide we hide that's why sometime if you
[34:05] Pastor Simon knows a lot because he been
[34:09] preaching at the age of what 14 years
[34:12] you have seen people they look real like
[34:14] a Believer and as the word
[34:18] come and blow on that person all of a
[34:24] sudden sometime you see them wash away
[34:29] because what most of them they are cha
[34:33] they can't take the fire where the fire
[34:36] is they don't want to draw closer to the
[34:39] fire they want to stay away from the
[34:42] fire because a lot even in the message
[34:47] they love it but when the Holy Spirit
[34:51] that the L
[34:54] ghost passing through the mess age
[34:58] because they are not part they want to
[35:00] stay in the mess age which brother
[35:03] Braham preached the letter part brother
[35:06] Brown says I preach what Paul preach I
[35:09] ask some people go in the Bible where
[35:13] did Paul says if commit adultery in
[35:16] English
[35:17] word you cannot find it like that and
[35:22] yet the prophet said it he preached what
[35:26] Paul preached by Revelation amen that
[35:30] time it was the unwritten part of the
[35:34] word that the prophet was speaking it
[35:38] was written but it was hidden but God
[35:42] allowed him to bring it play and now the
[35:46] Bride As we have come we have to step in
[35:52] into the mind of God things that are
[35:55] hidden Hallelujah so that God will come
[35:59] and speak it and the same people that
[36:03] are saying they believe in brother
[36:06] Braham when you tell them if you believe
[36:09] in brother Braham you supposed to
[36:12] believe
[36:13] this there you see the
[36:16] war there you see the fight because why

[38:47] it right in front of that person you
[38:51] will see sometime they become
[38:54] dummy in front of you
[38:57] I have seen him many times because
[39:03] otherwise Who Am
[39:06] I who are
[39:08] you because God hide himself in what
[39:13] Simplicity and reveal himself the same
[39:18] way so fear
[39:21] not let it

[39:53] maturity the seed in you
[39:57] will make
[39:58] manifest the seed in you will bring

[40:04] kind because every seed must bring forth
[40:08] after his kind and no matter what you do
[40:13] I do we are going to bring forth our
[40:17] kind and if you are a true seed of
[40:21] God let me tell
[40:23] you when Jesus was here
[40:26] he said something says I know my
[40:30] sheep he know all of his children from
[40:34] AEL to
[40:36] tribulation all those that going to come
[40:39] they are all in they are all his
[40:42] children what about those ones that
[40:44] won't
[40:46] come that are not his
[40:49] sheep that means those ones are what
[40:51] woman being by their serpent
[40:54] children they cannot
[40:57] come they will not come
[41:00] in Jesus said I
[41:03] know my sheep my sheep know my voice so
[41:07] the seed in you if it is of
[41:11] god you think he going to be
[41:15] lost you think he going to be somebody
[41:18] can twist it no man can twist that seed
[41:24] because God has spoken
[41:27] and God will perform it because you are
[41:30] a
[41:31] prophecy already before you get here do
[41:35] you know
[41:37] that you sitting here you are a prophecy
[41:41] I am a prophecy before I was born to
[41:45] this world Amen so that
[41:49] prophecy have to be fulfilled no matter
[41:53] what I think no matter what I do
[41:57] no matter what you do or think you will

[42:32] not saying you're not going to get H
[42:34] sometime short of money or things won't
[42:37] happen
[42:38] natural it will come but you don't even
[42:43] worry about it one bit because you know
[42:48] what all things work together to them
[42:53] that love what God and and because the
[42:57] seed in you is part of God you love God
[43:02] hallu the seed in you is Christ in you
[43:06] is your hope of what
[43:09] Glory so it can

[43:38] seed no you put it there no your mother
[43:42] not your father not the church not a
[43:45] priest not a pope not a
[43:47] king but the Creator himself did
[43:52] it and once he has done
[43:55] it is for
[43:58] eternity is for what
[44:02] eternity do you know you are Eternal as
[44:06] God is
[44:07] eternal the seed in you I'm not speaking
[44:10] to the flesh those that are not Eternal
[44:14] they can come around the
[44:16] message do whatever they want but they
[44:20] not going to be
[44:22] inside but when it's revealed to you
[44:27] boldness
[44:29] Authority power
[44:32] strength energy oh my you begin to see
[44:38] you have conquered
[44:40] de you begin to see absent from this
[44:44] body present with the Lord you begin to

[46:06] think I know
[46:08] now I am not
[46:11] scared
[46:13] nothing nothing I'm scared of
[46:18] because Jesus when he was here he told
[46:22] them destroy this temple in three days
[46:26] I'll raise it up that sickness can
[46:29] destroy this
[46:31] Temple the seed in me part that is the
[46:35] word of God it will raise it up

[47:27] preaching and they put you let's say
[47:29] they put you in jail if they're going to
[47:31] even do anything with this flesh you
[47:34] don't even care because you know that
[47:39] you
[47:40] know you know God become real to you you
[47:44] become so
[47:46] certain because your eye is so single to
[47:50] the word of God it is you and
[47:54] Christ Christ and you the hope of
[47:59] glory brother
[48:02] Abraham while he was
[48:04] preaching he came to a
[48:07] point even all the gifts he came to a
[48:11] point he said this Bible has become a
[48:15] new Bible for me why because that time
[48:20] he has entered into his office he
[48:24] recognized who he is what God brought
[48:28] him here on Earth what he must do that
[48:34] he was a gentle Prophet for the seven
[48:38] Church age
[48:42] messenger the prophet came to that
[48:45] point that he wasn't sent here just for
[48:48] the miracle
[48:49] alone the miracle was just like eating
[48:52] bread giving them bread to eat and so is
[48:56] it with so many people they come to
[49:01] church they want to use the church for
[49:04] fish and
[49:06] bread this age and they will dress up
[49:10] right they will wear scare right the men
[49:13] will put tie right the men will dress
[49:16] right but the pastor can tell them to do
[49:20] anything in the church to help they TI
[49:24] they won't pay they are offering they
[49:25] won't pay to clean the church they won't
[49:28] do H to support anything in the church
[49:32] they won't do right fish and bread
[49:35] Christianity people no sir during the
[49:39] time of
[49:41] Joshua Joshua was a man with no
[49:46] nonsense Joshua was a man who straighten
[49:51] things up look to the people Li we going
[49:55] to Cross River Jordan we going this is
[49:59] not something we come here to play it's
[50:04] reality support it brother Brown says if
[50:08] this gospel is TR support it with all
[50:11] your heart all your mind all your soul
[50:16] everything you got for it and let's go
[50:20] forward
[50:21] [Music]
[50:23] am oh my my my my my yes support
[50:29] it because you know what you don't come
[50:33] here to joke you come here to seek God
[50:37] you you want to go to heaven you see is
[50:42] right because they were playing they
[50:44] were
[50:45] sleeping ishma doesn't sleep you know
[50:49] what ish type all of us know who is
[50:54] ishma once you

[50:59] working and if you are blind you sleep
[51:02] the enemy doesn't
[51:05] sleep you joke the devil will struck you
[51:09] with all kinds of things but when you
[51:12] wake up the devil is always cared about
[51:15] you the devil knows you know who you are
[51:20] what you are raised up for now look when
[51:23] Israel wake up you see what the
[51:26] Palestinians are saying they running for
[51:29] cover and what their leaders are saying
[51:32] we're going to root heras
[51:36] out type of what
[51:38] Joshua we're going to go into the
[51:41] Promise Land and possess the
[51:45] land we're going to possess it we are
[51:49] not going to
[51:50] sleep because God has given us the land
[51:55] God is saying I will have my bride and I
[52:00] they will come to me I'll meet them in
[52:03] the drinking of an eye in the air so God
[52:07] says so we don't understand it we
[52:10] believe it amen that's settl it and let
[52:14] us move
[52:16] up because plain Church won't do it
[52:20] playing tricks will not
[52:23] do playing jokes will not
[52:27] do have fear have the
[52:31] word taking half of the
[52:34] word and fear mixed together won't do
[52:39] it
[52:41] right that means you become what
[52:44] lukewarm lukewarm Christianity won't do
[52:47] it but Hot
[52:52] Potato Hot Potato do the job
[52:56] then the devil is always scared of
[52:59] you the devil is always scared of a True
[53:04] Believer a True Believer who know who he
[53:08] is whether it's a brother or a sister
[53:11] the devil don't like
[53:13] you he'll try to take your
[53:17] life he always want to shorten your life
[53:21] he give you
[53:23] heart but you know what the more you do
[53:26] that the more you
[53:28] rejoice the more you lift up your heart
[53:32] and give the Lord Praise because you
[53:35] know and you recognize God is up to
[53:39] something big and you are part of
[53:46] it you are part of it because you know
[53:50] why you don't give him chance you are
[53:54] not just a chicken
[53:55] you are eager and eager eat hard
[54:01] meat hard hard
[54:04] meat anything that you do for the Lord
[54:07] do it with all of your
[54:11] heart oh otherwise don't do it you
[54:16] become a
[54:18] hypocrite because God don't want
[54:22] halfhearted halfhearted people that are
[54:26] like this
[54:28] no he want a
[54:31] solid what we woman we call Humble what
[54:36] is humble humble is you
[54:40] walking like this oh brother God bless
[54:43] you Sister God bless you it's nice but
[54:47] sometime do you know the devil hide
[54:48] behind
[54:51] that the devil hide behind that
[54:56] right like Jacob and Esau
[54:59] came that was the trick of
[55:02] Esau he was trying to use that to
[55:05] deceive his father but God says I Sease
[55:08] him I know I can see behind I I I can
[55:13] read I am God I can I know what's behind
[55:17] all
[55:18] that I know
[55:21] it do it from your heart
[55:26] if you going to be angry
[55:29] angry because Jacob he want the best
[55:34] right he would do anything to get it you
[55:37] think it was
[55:38] easy he look sometime in his brothers
[55:41] and sisters eye
[55:46] rough I think even the reason why Esau
[55:49] was able trying to deceive his father
[55:53] because Esau look
[55:55] holy in his father
[55:58] eye and Jacob look
[56:00] rough because Jacob you do
[56:04] something he not going to let it go he
[56:08] makes sure everything you try to hide he
[56:12] sees it no way get that thing out of me
[56:17] not until it's
[56:20] right that person I see it not until
[56:24] that is Spirit kind of spirit go
[56:28] out his father oh this my son too
[56:32] rough
[56:34] but what he didn't
[56:37] realize God has already revealed to
[56:42] Rebeca
[56:43] Jacob have I
[56:45] love Esau have I hate let's go to
[56:51] David David with his F father
[56:56] Jesse and the
[56:58] children the way Jake David look even
[57:03] his own father don't didn't like
[57:06] him he loved the big
[57:09] guys says this guy will be good for
[57:11] nothing let him put him to look for the
[57:14] Sheep just be in the bush he won't be
[57:17] good for nothing this one will be a good
[57:20] for Soldier for world this that but God
[57:25] has looked into Jacob High said this is
[57:29] the man after my own
[57:31] heart
[57:33] right a man after my own
[57:38] heart and when his time
[57:41] came for Samuel to
[57:44] anoint Jesse one of his son even the
[57:48] prophet
[57:49] Samuel wanted to
[57:52] anoint those brothers that are like
[57:55] giants God says no I didn't choose them
[57:59] no matter what they do I didn't choose
[58:02] them I have one reserve one his father
[58:06] has
[58:07] reject nobody knows about him even his
[58:11] father don't like him he push him in the
[58:16] bush he's like a rascal to
[58:20] him God says David you are that man he
[58:26] has already revealed to David what David
[58:29] was going to
[58:30] do so David God has let him kill a bear
[58:36] he has let him kill a
[58:39] lion already God has already who do you
[58:42] think did that you think it was David
[58:45] was God let me tell you a True
[58:48] [Music]
[58:50] Believer if you going to be a
[58:53] priest a pastor God will reveal to
[58:58] you before the before you become a
[59:03] pastor Pastor Salon knows
[59:07] that God will tell you before it become
[59:14] plain it's not just you going to say I'm
[59:18] going to be a pastor
[59:20] no that's why for me my life no matter
[59:24] what you do I'll never be a
[59:29] pastor
[59:32] no I will never
[59:35] ever something is not my
[59:38] position I am not going to step into it
[59:41] until God told
[59:43] me not until that not on my dead
[59:50] bones
[59:51] because when God revealed to you
[59:55] God will back you up he will vindicate
[59:59] you up
[1:00:02] because he will let a pill of fire come
[1:00:05] around
[1:00:07] you the church will see it that people
[1:00:11] will see
[1:00:13] it and know that this brother this man
[1:00:19] was not ordained by men he was ordained
[1:00:25] by the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:29] himself the Mighty God cuz God never
[1:00:34] lie we human beings lie so when
[1:00:39] Samuel chose wrong person God says no
[1:00:45] this is my
[1:00:46] anointing pour the oil on him for I have
[1:00:51] chosen to be the king of Israel
[1:00:56] and
[1:00:57] see no matter what Saul was doing or
[1:01:00] Israel was
[1:01:02] doing when David became a
[1:01:05] king see what he
[1:01:08] did what God instruction that he gave it
[1:01:12] to him he was able to accomplish it not
[1:01:17] because he have too much sense like the
[1:01:19] way we
[1:01:20] think all too much education I don't
[1:01:24] know back then whether they have highly
[1:01:26] education like today
[1:01:29] anyway but because God
[1:01:34] chose God won't
[1:01:36] fail
[1:01:38] him because he have already seen the
[1:01:42] person and design him his way of
[1:01:47] talking the way he move the way he would
[1:01:51] do
[1:01:52] things God all all his flaw is in Christ
[1:01:57] so God has know
[1:02:01] everything before he plac him the person
[1:02:05] to the
[1:02:07] people that's
[1:02:09] why the Rapture has taken so long
[1:02:13] because so many churches mess
[1:02:18] churches so many of them they are not
[1:02:21] choose by God I'm saying that
[1:02:25] few but let us fear not those ones that
[1:02:30] God has chosen in the message he going
[1:02:34] to make it plain at the day of Pentecost
[1:02:38] he made it what
[1:02:41] play right Judas wasn't part of
[1:02:46] it the root of David was not in Judas
[1:02:50] portion of the root of David for that
[1:02:52] day wasn't in Judas but those that have
[1:02:56] the portion of David which is
[1:03:00] representation of the pill of fire came
[1:03:03] and sat on their head and pro the 120
[1:03:09] that they were the chosen one you and I
[1:03:13] we shouldn't have no
[1:03:14] fear no fear where we are
[1:03:17] walking no fear where we go because the
[1:03:21] holy
[1:03:22] spirit is within our heart he will make
[1:03:27] it plain he will identify himself that's
[1:03:31] why he says when you reach a place think
[1:03:34] not when they begin to question you ask
[1:03:37] you this that that think not what you
[1:03:39] shall say that moment your heavenly
[1:03:42] father who dwell in you will
[1:03:46] speak he will speak and make things
[1:03:50] plain
[1:03:52] hallu listen
[1:03:55] I
[1:03:56] know what God can
[1:03:59] do I was sitting here in the church one

[1:10:27] heart this gospel I have got here is
[1:10:31] taking me right
[1:10:33] home if I close even my head tonight I
[1:10:37] know where I'm
[1:10:39] going I am so
[1:10:43] certain that's why when you reach that
[1:10:46] point staying
[1:10:51] Hess you don't want yes unless something
[1:10:55] serious has happened
[1:10:58] right otherwise 24 hours you'll love to
[1:11:03] be in the church and hear the word of
[1:11:06] God hallelujah you don't take it
[1:11:09] lightly you are
[1:11:12] absolute you want to hear the
[1:11:15] word you are
[1:11:18] solid you are you are not black and
[1:11:21] white or yellow or green
[1:11:24] or this or that
[1:11:26] no if the church is going down something
[1:11:30] is going down you going down with it if
[1:11:34] the church is going up you going up with
[1:11:36] this because why you want God God has
[1:11:39] show you this is what I the Lord brought
[1:11:43] you for why do you want a change no God
[1:11:47] listen God knows me God knows me better
[1:11:50] than
[1:11:51] anybody so Brothers and sisters let us
[1:11:56] charge fear
[1:11:58] not God has brought you here fear
[1:12:03] not because not every
[1:12:06] place there are so many message churches
[1:12:09] and I'm saying that not every one of
[1:12:13] them is the
[1:12:17] true message which have the life
[1:12:21] inside it's all about the
[1:12:25] life it's all about the life and the
[1:12:30] life is passing through the
[1:12:32] message so catch that life that has
[1:12:36] passed through the message and go forth
[1:12:40] with that and God will bless
[1:12:43] you from that time you will know where
[1:12:47] you are
[1:12:48] standing you will know
[1:12:51] where the food
[1:12:54] that you are
[1:12:55] eating when Pastor preach solid when Dan

[1:13:03] Christopher preached solid when Philip
[1:13:05] preached solid when desmon preached
[1:13:08] solid when I preach they listen the
[1:13:11] kingdom of God because the way God give
[1:13:14] me my
[1:13:16] style that's the way I can bring it
[1:13:18] because I'm the
[1:13:19] least in the kingdom of
[1:13:22] God
[1:13:23] so I'm going to bring it like that to

[1:13:32] you
[1:13:33] but if you eat it let me tell you be
[1:13:37] like a

[1:16:04] for his glory that's the way we
[1:16:08] are he used him for his honor and for
[1:16:12] his glory so that the people even took
[1:16:17] knowledge that Peter was ignorant but
[1:16:20] they took knowledge that Peter and
[1:16:24] has been with
[1:16:26] Jesus cuz Peter couldn't do the things
[1:16:29] he
[1:16:31] did Even though Paul was a scholar
