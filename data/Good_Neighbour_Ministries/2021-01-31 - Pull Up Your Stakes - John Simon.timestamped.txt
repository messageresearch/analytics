[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] good sunday morning
[0:16] friends indeed we are a blessed people
[0:22] to be able to come into the presence of
[0:24] god
[0:25] with thanksgiving and praise and
[0:29] honor to his glorious and wonderful
[0:33] wonderful name i'm thinking
[0:37] today of a beautiful
[0:40] uh song that tells us
[0:44] how that the move is on the move is on
[0:48] my lord the move is on the move is on
[0:53] my lord the move is on
[0:56] i can hear the rustling in the mulberry
[1:00] trees
[1:01] and i know i know i know the move is
[1:05] on god's spirit
[1:09] is certainly moving in our midst and
[1:14] in the world today i want to thank god
[1:17] that we
[1:18] serve a living god we do not serve a
[1:22] static
[1:23] god a god that remains
[1:27] at one place and in one time
[1:31] at any season of time
[1:34] but our god as the great song says
[1:38] our god is marching on
[1:44] oh this is something that too many
[1:47] have not really realized they
[1:50] sing the song but have no
[1:54] reality or revelation
[1:57] to themselves to recognize
[2:00] that indeed our god
[2:04] is marching on let us read our scripture
[2:08] for today
[2:09] and uh just speak on the word of god
[2:13] as we look into john
[2:17] the gospel of john chapter 3
[2:21] and we would like to read it verses 7
[2:25] and 8. of course this
[2:28] is the the pictorial
[2:32] of nicodemus coming to jesus
[2:35] by night this great
[2:38] dignified ruler
[2:42] not wanting to be seen that he needed
[2:46] christ he needed salvation he needed a
[2:49] change
[2:50] a transformation in his
[2:53] entire life whether it was his business
[2:56] life
[2:57] family life his social life
[3:01] he needed something to happen
[3:05] in his life something that
[3:08] no sadducee pharisee psychologist
[3:11] biologists or
[3:13] any of the other learned
[3:16] wise men of that day could solve his
[3:20] problem
[3:22] but somehow without
[3:25] reading it in a book
[3:29] without having any written proof
[3:35] by his knowledge of jesus
[3:40] he just had the feeling in his heart
[3:44] that if he came to jesus
[3:47] jesus could fix it jesus could solve the
[3:51] problem
[3:53] and so he came to jesus by night
[3:58] and this is a part of what jesus said to
[4:01] him
[4:03] as we read out of john chapter 3.
[4:08] marvel not that i
[4:11] said unto thee you
[4:14] must be born again
[4:18] the wind blew it where it listed
[4:23] and thou here is the sound thereof
[4:27] but canst not tell whence it cometh
[4:33] and whether it goes
[4:36] so is everyone
[4:39] that is born of the spirit
[4:42] later of course we read where
[4:46] paul says sons of god
[4:49] children of god are led by the spirit of
[4:53] god
[4:55] let us pray our gracious heavenly father
[5:00] lord god of heaven and earth creator of
[5:04] all things
[5:06] lover of our soul redeemer of our beings
[5:11] o lamb of god we ask your grace and
[5:15] mercy today we pray you will bless
[5:19] us as we speak
[5:22] on your word give us
[5:26] divine utterance give us
[5:30] divine inspiration
[5:33] lord let the holy spirit draw near
[5:38] and speak to us a while that we may
[5:42] feed upon the living word of
[5:45] god the bread of life for we ask it in
[5:48] the name
[5:50] of our love beloved lord jesus christ
[5:53] whom beloved all our hearts amen
[5:57] and amen praise be to god
[6:00] hallelujah my brothers and sisters
[6:05] we live in a great day
[6:08] where we have heard so much
[6:11] about revivals
[6:14] and the moving of the holy spirit
[6:19] now i would like to speak on the subject
[6:22] of
[6:23] pull up your stakes
[6:26] pull up your stakes as
[6:29] intent stakes pull them up and let's get
[6:34] moving
[6:35] for our god is marching on
[6:40] now in our day and time that we live in
[6:46] we are hearing a lot of revivals
[6:50] revivals breaking that out in the south
[6:53] or
[6:54] a revival in a church over in our major
[6:57] cities
[6:59] a revival in the west or in the
[7:02] east somewhere but friends
[7:07] we are not supposed to have
[7:09] denominational revivals
[7:12] we are here to have genuine
[7:16] heaven sent god
[7:19] given revivals coming directly
[7:24] from the great holy spirit
[7:28] now to cope the great
[7:31] 20th century prophet
[7:34] we haven't had a real stirring
[7:38] no no no no sir
[7:42] don't think we have got revivals
[7:45] we haven't oh yes they've gotten
[7:49] millions and millions and millions of
[7:52] church members
[7:54] but not a genuine revival
[7:57] nowhere at all
[8:01] no the bride hasn't had
[8:05] a revival yet
[8:08] there has been no revival there
[8:12] no manifestation
[8:15] of god to stir the bride yet
[8:21] oh we are looking for
[8:24] it now it will
[8:27] take those seven unknown
[8:31] thunders back there to wake her
[8:34] up again praise god there was a time in
[8:39] the
[8:40] dim past in the mind of god
[8:44] when she was fully awake fully aware she
[8:47] knew what was happening
[8:49] what was going on and
[8:52] then with adamic sin the entire human
[8:55] race
[8:56] fell into the the sleep of sin or the
[8:59] sleep of spiritual
[9:01] death but the bible is telling us
[9:06] that it will take these seven unknown
[9:10] thunders
[9:11] to wake her up again
[9:14] of course in a simple manner of putting
[9:17] it the seven
[9:18] thunders of course is the voice of god
[9:22] seven number of perfection the perfect
[9:25] word of god the seven thunders
[9:29] the word first of course
[9:32] god's voice genesis 1
[9:36] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[9:39] face of the waters
[9:42] and god said
[9:45] spoken word but before that
[9:49] was spoken word it was a
[9:52] thought in the mind of god it was the
[9:56] unwritten word then
[9:59] it came to being or manifestation
[10:04] and a spoken word of god
[10:07] so we understand that the the first
[10:11] word was god god's unwritten word
[10:16] the unwritten word which
[10:19] is that the bible was literally
[10:23] written in the skies and there it was
[10:27] now think of it by faith
[10:30] hebrews 11. it tells us
[10:33] abel offered a better sacrifice
[10:37] by faith abraham
[10:41] left his country and went
[10:44] into a land where god had called him
[10:48] now you must understanding by faith
[10:51] faith is a revelation
[10:54] so by something that was revealed
[10:58] or something that was made known to them
[11:02] that was not yet written it was
[11:06] known to them what to do
[11:09] how did a bell know that it was a lamb
[11:13] that would be
[11:14] the perfect and acceptable
[11:17] sacrifice in the eyes and mind of god
[11:21] it was revealed to him that it was not a
[11:24] horse or a sheep or
[11:25] or a fish or flowers or fruits
[11:28] but a lamb that was to be slain
[11:33] how did he know it by revelation
[11:37] god made it known to him
[11:40] praise god hallelujah oh
[11:43] praise his name likewise with
[11:47] abraham it was by
[11:50] revelation that he would have heard the
[11:54] voice saying
[11:55] get up get out of your old country
[11:59] oh and go into the place where i
[12:03] have called you glory to god god's
[12:06] wonderful name
[12:07] amen and so god's
[12:10] bible for there was no written bible yet
[12:15] they couldn't go and open the bible and
[12:18] read the scripture and say oh the spirit
[12:20] is leading me to this scripture
[12:22] and telling me to do this this or that
[12:25] no
[12:26] it was the unwritten word
[12:30] not written yet but still leading
[12:33] his sons and his daughters as jesus said
[12:38] sons and daughters of god children of
[12:40] god
[12:41] are led by the spirit of god
[12:45] and the wind blew it where it listed
[12:48] no man no devil knows where it's going
[12:53] doesn't know where it goes or where it
[12:55] comes from
[12:57] but it moves god moves
[13:00] his spirit moves his children
[13:04] move under his divine inspiration
[13:08] and power of the great holy spirit
[13:11] amen so god's first bible
[13:14] was written in the skies
[13:17] they could look up into the skies
[13:20] written in the stars
[13:23] and they could see from
[13:26] what we call today the signs of the
[13:29] zodiac
[13:30] they could read the bible virgo
[13:33] the virgin birth of christ they could
[13:36] speak see of it clearly
[13:38] the twins are brought in there
[13:41] crab cancer sin evil
[13:45] the man with the water pop jesus pouring
[13:48] out the word of god
[13:50] on the entire human race and so on
[13:53] it was given to them to understand
[13:56] which of course the wise men in the days
[13:59] of jesus had some understanding of that
[14:02] so they were able to follow the star
[14:06] and now we find that
[14:10] abel and abraham had
[14:13] by revelation not my written word
[14:18] that was to come later but the
[14:21] real original way
[14:25] of following god's plan
[14:29] god god's will god's purpose
[14:33] but is by his supernatural
[14:38] event of grace
[14:41] choosing to whom he would reveal himself
[14:46] to
[14:47] listen there may be millions of people
[14:49] in this world
[14:51] but god chose you to reveal himself to
[14:55] he chose you as simple as you may be
[14:59] or as educated as you may be you are
[15:02] chosen of god hallelujah blessed
[15:06] is the man whom thou chooses
[15:10] and causes to draw nigh unto thyself
[15:14] so god in his divine choosing
[15:17] the same god said my
[15:20] sheep know my voice and a stranger they
[15:24] will not follow
[15:26] hallelujah oh how are they going to know
[15:29] his voice if they never heard it before
[15:32] but somewhere deep in their soul
[15:36] there is planted an elected seed of god
[15:41] a germ of the living god planted in them
[15:45] that was way back before the foundation
[15:49] of the world remember friends
[15:52] we who are true elected believers
[15:57] not church members true elected
[16:00] believers
[16:02] oh we are not people
[16:05] of time we are not creatures
[16:09] of time only our body
[16:13] was born into time
[16:16] but you me
[16:19] others that are true elected seed
[16:24] the being the person on the inside
[16:27] your soul hallelujah
[16:30] that came from god almighty
[16:34] before the foundation of the world
[16:38] that is the reason why he says those
[16:40] that will really have a revelation
[16:44] are those whose names are written
[16:47] in the lamb's book of life before the
[16:50] foundation
[16:51] of the world our god did not have to
[16:55] wait until you accepted him
[16:57] to know that you were gonna be one of
[16:59] his
[17:00] he knew you what he said to
[17:03] jeremiah i knew you before you were in
[17:07] your mother's
[17:08] belly and i called you raise you up and
[17:12] ordained you hallelujah
[17:14] to be a preacher to carry the word of
[17:17] god
[17:18] hallelujah oh may the great holy spirit
[17:21] expand these things to you that you
[17:24] might see what god
[17:26] is saying here in his word no
[17:29] but the word i'm trying to establish the
[17:32] fact
[17:34] the church world
[17:37] has established the fact that we are to
[17:40] believe
[17:41] the written word which we are supposed
[17:46] to
[17:48] but the written word is only a
[17:51] representation
[17:53] of the unwritten word or
[17:56] the thought that is in god's mind
[18:00] for me to speak i have a thought
[18:03] in my mind and then i speak it
[18:06] but before it was a spoken word
[18:09] it was a thought that is what i'm
[18:12] telling you
[18:14] god is taking his real elected seed
[18:17] and identifying that they are his
[18:21] by allowing them to be able to
[18:24] tap into his divine thoughts
[18:29] as he reveals them unto you
[18:32] now if you say oh god has revealed this
[18:34] to me and it
[18:36] does not line up or agree
[18:39] with the written word then you've got
[18:41] the wrong revelation
[18:43] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[18:46] tells you that clearly
[18:48] go back to the word and check
[18:51] what you are thinking or saying or the
[18:54] revelation you have received
[18:56] and then check it with the word
[19:00] to see whether it comes from the living
[19:03] god
[19:04] the word first written or shown
[19:07] as a sign in the stars
[19:11] so the patriarchs have no
[19:14] written bible
[19:17] from the time of abel
[19:20] to the time of moses there was no
[19:24] written bible
[19:26] not one syllable was written down
[19:29] it's moses that wrote the pentateuch
[19:33] the first five books of the bible
[19:37] god inspired him to write it
[19:40] so he wrote it how by revelation
[19:45] how could he know
[19:48] in the beginning god the spirit
[19:52] of god moved on the face of the waters
[19:55] and god said and he wrote down what god
[19:59] said
[19:59] and then he was told exactly what
[20:02] happened
[20:03] when it happened and he was able to
[20:06] write it down was that the knowledge of
[20:08] a man
[20:09] was that the mind of a man no he
[20:12] did that by the revelation
[20:16] of the holy spirit of which i'm speaking
[20:19] of now
[20:20] calling out to the true bride of christ
[20:24] the true elected seed of god to come
[20:28] back to that place where they go
[20:31] beyond the veil go beyond the veil of
[20:34] the written word
[20:36] into the unwritten word where
[20:40] god is making himself known
[20:43] in this hour blessed be his holy
[20:47] and his precious names no
[20:50] there it was no written word
[20:53] moses comes on the scene then they
[20:57] receive the writing of the word
[21:00] not right then but shortly after of
[21:03] course
[21:05] now we understand here that
[21:09] moses the christ the written
[21:12] and spoken word by moses and
[21:16] the various prophets
[21:19] then that word with moses
[21:24] not only was it uh
[21:27] unwritten but it met him in a burning
[21:31] bush
[21:32] spoke to him and allowed
[21:35] itself to be seen and when it could be
[21:39] perceived or when it could
[21:43] impinge on the human
[21:46] sight he was able to see
[21:50] him in the form
[21:53] of a pillar of fire and
[21:56] later when israel moved
[22:00] out of egypt and had to go into the
[22:03] wilderness
[22:04] the bible tells us that god
[22:08] was leading them by the pillar of
[22:12] fire which was the same
[22:15] unwritten word now in the form
[22:18] of a pillar of fire now they were led
[22:22] by that same great pillar of fire
[22:27] and god led them through the wilderness
[22:30] later on
[22:31] we recognize that that
[22:34] pillar of fire became flesh
[22:38] john 1 1 and the word
[22:42] was with god amen
[22:45] and the word was made flesh
[22:49] and dwelt among us the same word
[22:53] which was a thought that was back there
[22:57] became fresh and walked among us
[23:01] and his name is jesus christ
[23:05] and so that word become jesus christ
[23:09] and it was the lord jesus christ himself
[23:14] who turned to peter
[23:17] and said peter flesh and
[23:20] blood who do you say that i am
[23:24] and peter said thou art the christ
[23:27] the son of the living god jesus answered
[23:30] said
[23:31] flesh and blood listen to the emphasis
[23:35] has not revealed this unto you
[23:39] but my father in heaven has revealed
[23:43] this unto you and upon
[23:47] this rock what rock the rock of
[23:51] revelation of who he is
[23:55] god almighty amen but it was by the
[23:59] instrumentality of
[24:02] revelation he said upon this
[24:06] rock i'll build my church on this
[24:09] principle this true foundation
[24:13] of genuine revelation
[24:17] of god speaking directly
[24:21] to his children in this day
[24:24] and in this hour praise god hallelujah
[24:28] and opening up their understanding to
[24:32] his word
[24:33] by taking away their spiritual
[24:37] amnesia upon this rock
[24:40] so then the church is built on what
[24:44] revelation let me say it another way
[24:47] the church is really or the true
[24:51] church's true foundation
[24:54] is the unwritten word
[24:58] the church is built
[25:02] on that part of the word
[25:05] that is not written
[25:08] oh praise god it can only be received
[25:14] given by revelation
[25:18] through the grace of god not by human
[25:21] study of man
[25:23] not by intellectual achievements of man
[25:26] but by the grace of almighty god
[25:29] blessed be the name of the living god
[25:32] hallelujah
[25:33] so that church of god the true church
[25:37] is birthed from the
[25:40] unwritten word or
[25:43] as we would say they revealed
[25:47] word of god for the hour
[25:51] now when we go back and look into the
[25:55] old days realize
[25:58] god moved in genesis 1.
[26:02] when we come to moses and
[26:05] israel the bible says god
[26:08] moved again moving israel out of egypt
[26:13] they got in the wilderness the pillar of
[26:16] fire began to lead them
[26:18] and the great holy spirit was
[26:21] moving again oh thank god
[26:24] for the moving of the holy spirit listen
[26:28] in the old days back there they
[26:32] put up their tents and
[26:35] there was a pillar of fair
[26:38] that led them praise god i'll
[26:41] i'm going to slide into my topic
[26:46] they put up their tents israel
[26:50] lived in tents they moved in tents
[26:55] in the wilderness now many of us or many
[26:58] of you
[26:59] who know about tents and of tempting in
[27:02] the wilderness
[27:04] tenting on the mountainsides hillsides
[27:06] lakesides
[27:08] wherever you may go it's a
[27:11] wonderful and beautiful uh uh
[27:14] operation something that we should love
[27:17] to do
[27:18] myself and some of the brothers in my
[27:20] earlier days
[27:22] would go up into the northern part of
[27:25] canada
[27:26] and northern ontario and there we
[27:30] would find a big beautiful lake set up
[27:34] our tent
[27:35] we'll go fishing beautiful just
[27:38] watch the moonlight coming
[27:41] over the lake watch the sun rise in the
[27:44] morning
[27:45] how beautiful that would be all glory to
[27:48] god
[27:49] hallelujah and there we would set up our
[27:52] tents
[27:53] and you know with the setting up of a
[27:54] tent it
[27:56] is necessary one of the most important
[27:59] things in setting up a tent
[28:01] is making sure you put down
[28:04] your tent stakes
[28:08] they must not be too shallow or too
[28:11] deep if they're too shallow the wind
[28:14] will pull them out if they're too deep
[28:16] then you'll have a hard time extracting
[28:19] them
[28:20] from the ground amen
[28:23] but israel lived in tents
[28:26] and every time the purifier moved they
[28:29] had to move
[28:30] or they had to pull up their stakes
[28:33] and that's what i'm talking about pull
[28:35] up your stakes
[28:36] and let's move on with god and that god
[28:40] has this wonderful way
[28:41] within your heart and within your life
[28:44] so they followed the great
[28:46] pillar of fire amen moses
[28:49] followed it israel followed the pillar
[28:52] of fire
[28:53] the word of god set on fire the
[28:55] revelation of the word of god to you
[28:58] when it is made known it sets your soul
[29:01] of fire
[29:02] it makes you want to know him more and
[29:05] love him in every possible way amen
[29:09] praise god now my friends that principle
[29:12] is lost today
[29:15] church of israel followed a pillar of
[29:17] fire back there
[29:18] moved on when it moved on but today's
[29:21] church
[29:23] doesn't want to move when god moves
[29:27] amen we come to a man by the name of
[29:30] martin luther
[29:34] and after the 1500 years i believe of
[29:37] the dark ages
[29:39] martin luther caught the revelation
[29:43] that the just shall live by
[29:46] revelation by faith amen
[29:50] oh my and he
[29:54] was a roman catholic priest and he came
[29:57] out
[29:58] of the roman catholic church and
[30:02] followed the purifier with tens of
[30:05] thousands of others with him
[30:09] oh my think about it brother sister
[30:13] oh praise god and so
[30:16] we know that he got out of the catholic
[30:20] church
[30:22] and he moved with god and after a while
[30:26] he got organized soon as he got
[30:29] organized
[30:31] he put down church stakes
[30:34] called lutronism
[30:37] and that's where he pitched his tent
[30:41] and laid his stakes down
[30:44] after him came john wesley
[30:48] and wesley saw god move with luther
[30:52] but you realize there was a further
[30:54] revelation
[30:56] not only must you be saved but you must
[30:59] live
[30:59] holy and so uh wesley did not just stay
[31:05] under that because under lutheranism
[31:08] because of what they were teaching which
[31:10] was the truth
[31:12] but the time had come for him to move on
[31:15] so he moved on with sanctification
[31:20] as god was revealing it to him
[31:24] amen praise god my friends
[31:27] let me say this there is no
[31:30] evidence in this bible of god
[31:34] having any organized religion
[31:38] whatsoever no organized church
[31:41] was ever formed by the true and the
[31:44] living god
[31:45] of course the catholic church says she's
[31:47] the mother church
[31:49] of course she says she is the first
[31:52] church
[31:53] and i want to say to you they are the
[31:57] mother church
[32:00] they are the first church
[32:04] yes in the sense that they are the
[32:07] mother
[32:08] of all organization religious
[32:11] organizations revelation chapter 17
[32:15] you may read it there for yourselves
[32:17] when it speaks of her
[32:19] and her various protestant daughters
[32:23] various daughters that came out
[32:26] from her just go read revelation
[32:29] chapter 17. amen
[32:33] but wesley many nations were in
[32:36] moral decay and falling
[32:41] wesley saw it caught the revelation of
[32:44] god
[32:45] follow the pillar of fire himself
[32:47] francis ashbury
[32:49] many others anointed by the holy spirit
[32:53] god used them in a mighty
[32:56] way and as such my brothers
[32:59] after a while he also
[33:03] put his stakes in the ground and
[33:06] called himself a methodist
[33:10] all church methods begin to
[33:14] come into the church as he
[33:17] put his stakes into methodism
[33:21] the first thing you know once he
[33:23] organized
[33:25] once he put down those stakes the
[33:28] purifier just
[33:29] raised up and moved on again
[33:34] and when it moved the pentek
[33:38] of that day saw the move of god
[33:42] and followed the great purifier
[33:46] out of those denominations of that
[33:50] particular time and they moved on
[33:54] but what happened they have also
[33:57] organized
[33:59] as their movement began to crystallize
[34:04] they began to organize and they
[34:08] took their stake and nailed it down
[34:12] we believe speaking in tongues is the
[34:16] only initial or initial evidence
[34:20] of the holy spirit and nailed their
[34:23] stakes down
[34:25] now many years later that's proven of
[34:28] course
[34:28] not to be true it's false
[34:32] it's not the word of god it is an
[34:35] evidence but it's not the only
[34:38] initial evidence of the holy spirit
[34:42] my god let's go back to the word
[34:45] but can you tell them that to do that
[34:48] you are coming against their very
[34:51] foundational
[34:53] doctrine or their stake and you're
[34:56] trying to pull it out
[34:57] and they would stand for it because
[35:00] their entire denomination
[35:02] is built not on revelation but
[35:06] built upon their words
[35:09] built upon this stake that they
[35:12] place within the ground and now
[35:16] we see many churches built on the stakes
[35:19] they put in the ground the stakes of
[35:22] money
[35:25] the stakes of political
[35:29] organization the stakes
[35:33] as i've said of terms
[35:36] amen being the evidence and they use
[35:39] these stakes
[35:41] to differentiate themselves upon
[35:45] the face of the earth oh my
[35:49] think of it there they are their
[35:52] israel was intense
[35:55] with stakes driven in the ground in our
[35:58] modern times
[36:00] we see the various organizations
[36:05] take their stand or place their stake in
[36:08] the ground
[36:10] and say toms is the evidence here i
[36:13] stand so help me god
[36:15] justification sanctification that is the
[36:18] evidence
[36:18] and once they do that history proves it
[36:22] the bible proves it
[36:24] god's spirit affair moves on
[36:28] the spirit of god keeps moving on
[36:32] as the word of god unfolds
[36:35] for god is not a dead god our god is a
[36:38] living god and our god is
[36:42] marching on glory to god hallelujah
[36:45] amen so here is israel with their tents
[36:49] stakes driven in the ground here are
[36:52] these denominations here
[36:54] are the modern churches sticks driven
[36:57] in the ground and the pillar of fire
[37:00] right there
[37:02] hanging over them available for everyone
[37:07] to see or to recognize amen
[37:11] the first thing would happen the pair of
[37:14] fire would
[37:14] come and speak to moses and say moses
[37:18] i want them traveling over there
[37:21] or i want them going in this direction
[37:25] amen and every day
[37:28] he would have god's directive and they
[37:32] had
[37:32] no uh specific place
[37:36] where they can uh stop and say
[37:40] this is where we are no
[37:44] god's spirit was moving and they had no
[37:48] certain place well i see
[37:51] like today some may say well i i like
[37:54] this valley
[37:55] i think i'm going to stop over here no
[37:59] you may stop in that valley but the pair
[38:02] of fire
[38:03] our god is marching on
[38:06] oh oh there's a beautiful piece of land
[38:09] over there
[38:10] i'm going to build over there i'm going
[38:12] to pitch my tent
[38:13] over there that's what happened to lot
[38:17] the bible said lot pitched his
[38:20] tent near sodom he put down his stakes
[38:25] abraham was on the mountain he put his
[38:28] tanks
[38:29] near sodom later on he became mayor of
[38:32] sodom
[38:33] and that's what happens when you go on
[38:36] pitch your tent
[38:37] near the world yes sir next thing you
[38:40] know
[38:40] you're like them oh praise god
[38:43] hallelujah
[38:45] the pillar of fire keeps moving on
[38:48] amen god wouldn't let his people
[38:52] get settled down jesus himself said
[38:56] amen the wind blew it where it that
[38:59] no man not from whence it comes and
[39:02] where it's going
[39:04] but only he or her
[39:08] that is born of the holy spirit
[39:11] will receive that revelation that
[39:14] super knowledge given by god alone
[39:19] by his divine grace oh friend that is
[39:22] clearly a type here in the word of god
[39:25] amen there's a lot of people get so
[39:28] settled down in the world
[39:32] they get settled down in this present
[39:35] world
[39:36] which causes them to become worldly
[39:39] minded
[39:40] they get satisfied with their
[39:43] surroundings
[39:45] oh their surroundings may be
[39:47] consumptious
[39:49] and beautiful and marvelous
[39:52] comfortable and they get settled down
[39:56] and self-satisfied with themselves
[40:00] and maybe friends are while i'm speaking
[40:03] you may be thinking that you need to
[40:07] really settle down amen
[40:10] and settle your mind and and start to
[40:13] get
[40:14] real cozy with whatever it is
[40:18] that you are doing amen
[40:22] and you begin your planning of this
[40:25] your planning of that your
[40:28] planning of the other not that we are
[40:31] not to have our minor plans
[40:33] but the great planner the great leader a
[40:36] great
[40:36] guide is the blessed holy spirit
[40:40] to lead us and to guide us into all
[40:43] truth
[40:44] and show us things to come amen
[40:48] praise god the funny thing about it
[40:52] is that when we are planning planning
[40:54] planning not realizing that way
[40:57] back you're dying dying dying and dying
[41:00] in christ
[41:01] you're dying to your faith you're dying
[41:04] to your
[41:04] beliefs you're dying to the things you
[41:07] hold dear
[41:08] or once hold there you're starting dying
[41:11] to that
[41:12] amen oh turn your eyes upon
[41:16] jesus look full in this wonderful face
[41:19] and the things of this earth will grow
[41:22] strangely
[41:23] dim in the light of his glory and
[41:27] his grace amen praise god
[41:30] hallelujah now
[41:34] while israel was in the wilderness
[41:37] no doubt some of them drove their
[41:40] stakes into the ground
[41:45] too far too deep
[41:48] i believe the same thing is happening
[41:50] today with a lot of believers
[41:54] you're putting your hopes your faith
[41:58] your trust and everything
[42:01] in the world and in the things of the
[42:03] world
[42:04] and placing your confidence and placing
[42:07] your
[42:08] hopes putting down those stakes
[42:13] deep in to the world
[42:16] back there oh my
[42:19] yes sir and when the purifier began to
[42:22] move
[42:24] what happened term israel got the orders
[42:27] to move on
[42:30] i wanted to see this picture moses
[42:33] caused the uh men to blow the trumpet
[42:36] gather the tribes
[42:37] and they began to move out on their
[42:40] journey
[42:42] when they were moving out and moving
[42:45] on amen to what
[42:48] god was the revelation of what god was
[42:51] leading them to
[42:53] for it took revelation revelation
[42:56] revelation to take them into the
[42:59] promised land
[43:01] and today it will it takes us the same
[43:04] thing
[43:05] word on top of word on top of word on
[43:07] top of word
[43:08] revelation by revelation by revelation
[43:11] he does
[43:12] not give you all of it at one time
[43:15] but he reveals himself to you by his
[43:18] blessed holy spirit
[43:20] amen praise god
[43:24] but there were many of those jews
[43:27] many of those israelites they could not
[43:30] pull out the stakes
[43:32] out of the ground in time they could not
[43:35] pull them out
[43:36] while the rest of the tribe was moving
[43:39] on
[43:40] and moving out they could not get their
[43:42] stakes out in time
[43:45] oh my friends what a sad sight
[43:49] they got them out maybe but now they
[43:52] were alone
[43:54] there were targets as you know it's
[43:57] written in the scriptures
[43:59] your father's at manor in the wilderness
[44:03] and now they are dead
[44:06] dead because they would not
[44:10] pull up their stakes because they put
[44:12] their stakes too
[44:14] deep in the ground couldn't get them out
[44:17] in time or couldn't get them out and
[44:20] their
[44:20] bones with their families bleach within
[44:24] the wilderness you see
[44:28] you can't beat these types
[44:31] because many times
[44:34] being driven by our own human desire
[44:39] of what we can accomplish in this world
[44:42] or what we can accumulate
[44:44] in this world our ambitions that we can
[44:47] achieve
[44:48] within this world we don't realize how
[44:52] deeply sometimes we get ourselves
[44:55] attached to that
[44:56] and nailing down our stakes in these
[45:00] places and
[45:01] things that god when he calls you
[45:04] you are not ready and willing to pull
[45:08] up your stakes and move on
[45:11] with the true and living god may god
[45:14] open the eyes of your heart today
[45:16] for you to recognize that god spirit
[45:20] calling you and speaking to you to pull
[45:23] out
[45:24] pull up your stakes praise god
[45:26] hallelujah
[45:28] amen amen amen oh praise god
[45:31] how beautiful to know we are
[45:35] led by the holy spirit for the children
[45:38] of god
[45:39] are led by the spirit of god bible tells
[45:42] us in psalm 107
[45:44] matter of fact during this coming week
[45:47] take the time to read
[45:48] psalm 106
[45:52] psalms 107 chapters i'm speaking about
[45:55] chapter 106
[45:57] chapter 107 and you'll find god speaking
[46:00] about israel there
[46:02] how they wandered in the wilderness in a
[46:06] lonely and solitary way
[46:09] but how god led them by the pillar of
[46:11] fire and guided them
[46:14] amen how wonderful his works how
[46:18] wonderful his name gave them water from
[46:21] the rock manor
[46:22] from on high you read it there in psalm
[46:26] 106
[46:27] and some 107 and i believe you'll enjoy
[46:30] it
[46:31] as much as i did enjoy it
[46:34] also so these ones
[46:39] who could not get their stakes
[46:42] up no leader
[46:48] no pillar of fire to guide them
[46:52] none to take them out
[46:56] they bleached their bones bleached
[46:59] and they died in the wilderness amen
[47:03] my friends if the holy
[47:06] spirit while i'm speaking here
[47:10] were to reveal to you today
[47:13] what maybe you said or done
[47:17] yesterday and reveal to you
[47:21] that that was wrong
[47:24] you've got to be willing to pull up that
[47:27] stake
[47:29] that idea that belief
[47:33] that so-called teaching that maybe
[47:35] you've had for years
[47:37] you've got to be willing to pull up your
[47:40] stake and obey the great holy spirit
[47:43] oh oh i'm a catholic oh i'm a methodist
[47:46] i'm a
[47:47] i'm a baptist i'm i'm a presbyterian oh
[47:50] i belong to this or i belong
[47:52] pull up your stakes and move with the
[47:55] holy spirit
[47:57] let the holy ghost guide you and bring
[48:00] you into all truth
[48:02] as the word of god said that he
[48:05] certainly will if we surrender ourselves
[48:09] to him amen hallelujah
[48:12] now tomorrow god may reveal to you
[48:16] uh another revelation or further
[48:20] revelation will come and show to you
[48:23] that
[48:24] what you received yesterday was only
[48:28] partial revelation
[48:31] you've got to be willing obedient
[48:35] humble to swallow all your
[48:38] foolish human pride
[48:41] all your self-importance whatever it is
[48:45] that you attach yourself to
[48:49] and move on with the great holy spirit
[48:52] of the living god let him lead you and
[48:56] guide you
[48:57] into all truth and move you into the
[49:00] fullness
[49:02] of the word my friends i'm not willing
[49:05] to settle down here
[49:07] not even where i am spiritually
[49:11] with my understanding with the
[49:14] revelation given to me by the holy
[49:16] spirit
[49:16] i am not willing to settle down here i
[49:19] want to pull up my stakes
[49:21] i want to move on with god i'm bound for
[49:24] the promised land
[49:25] i'm bound my friends for a rapture
[49:28] i am bound for the great gathering
[49:32] the great meeting in the presence of our
[49:34] heavenly father
[49:36] once again for his glory amen praise the
[49:39] name of the lord
[49:40] oh praise god you know it's written in
[49:43] the scriptures i think it's first
[49:44] corinthians 10.
[49:46] you'll find it again there where god
[49:49] speaks about leading our fathers through
[49:51] the wilderness eating from the
[49:53] eating from the manna that fell from
[49:57] above
[49:58] drinking from the smitten rock yet their
[50:02] bones bleached the very wilderness
[50:06] because why they should have never
[50:09] settled down
[50:10] they should never droven stakes
[50:13] but they should have followed the great
[50:16] holy spirit
[50:17] amen hallelujah these things are written
[50:20] in the word of god
[50:22] for our admonition for our guidance
[50:25] there are scriptural examples given to
[50:28] us that we may know how to behave
[50:32] ourselves
[50:33] and how to understand the
[50:36] moving of the holy spirit
[50:40] and to watch how god is moving
[50:43] and to follow his leading like david did
[50:47] when i see the moving of the wind
[50:51] in the mulberry trees
[50:55] the leaves of the trees i know i
[50:58] know i know the move of god is on
[51:02] that is how the true believer must be
[51:06] praise be the god hallelujah amen
[51:09] praise god they should not have settled
[51:12] down
[51:13] and because they start driving in stakes
[51:16] getting self-satisfied full of ourselves
[51:21] full of yourself i know the word i know
[51:24] the message
[51:26] i i'm learning in the message i study it
[51:28] for hours i
[51:30] read the bible day and night i fast i
[51:33] pray i do this i do that
[51:35] not knowing that's not by works of
[51:38] righteousness which we have done
[51:40] but by his grace and his mercy that he
[51:44] has called us
[51:45] or that he reveals or make makes known
[51:49] himself to us so god
[51:53] my friends became displeased with them
[51:58] and it's written in the scriptures
[52:02] some 101 106
[52:06] verses 24 to 27
[52:10] tells us that and the lord
[52:13] overthrew them in the wilderness
[52:18] they were overthrown in the wilderness
[52:21] in other words something took them over
[52:24] they were taken over whether it's by a
[52:26] thought
[52:27] by this by that whatever but they were
[52:30] overthrown
[52:31] if i might mention some were overthrown
[52:33] by the golden calf
[52:35] uh which would be symbol symbolic of
[52:38] money
[52:39] others were overthrown by their
[52:41] complaining
[52:43] others were overthrown by their gang
[52:45] saying
[52:46] others were overthrown by their
[52:48] murmuring
[52:49] various things that they were overthrown
[52:53] in the middle of the wilderness
[52:56] now you've got to see this clearly my
[52:59] brothers
[53:00] my sisters hallelujah
[53:03] something overthrew them something took
[53:06] them over
[53:07] they were tired they were
[53:11] kind of giving up with this message
[53:16] with this word we're trying
[53:19] getting loose or we say loosey-goosey
[53:22] and relaxing the discipline
[53:26] and the guidelines of the holy spirit
[53:29] oh we can't stay in this place
[53:32] we can't stay under the influence of
[53:35] this
[53:36] message we can't do that we got to be
[53:40] different or whatever that was their
[53:43] thought at that particular time
[53:46] but you see god had a purpose with
[53:49] moving them like that
[53:51] what was god doing he said i took you in
[53:54] the wilderness
[53:55] it's to try you and to prove
[53:59] you amen amen
[54:03] and so he uses satan to try to improve
[54:06] you
[54:07] he you satan to attempt you uses satan
[54:10] to bring trials
[54:12] brings all kind of tribulations brings
[54:14] to you even sins
[54:15] trespasses satan brings to you and god
[54:19] allows it because he's trying you
[54:21] and proving you by all kinds of
[54:24] temptations
[54:24] strife and uh all kinds of comparisons
[54:28] and competitions and everything else
[54:31] you praise god you can carry that
[54:33] thought on
[54:34] but satan god allows him to test you
[54:38] try us and prove us that we are
[54:43] his own hallelujah many times when the
[54:46] holy spirit wants to lead us to a
[54:48] consecrated life
[54:50] we grieve the holy spirit we resist the
[54:52] holy spirit
[54:53] we fight against the holy spirit we will
[54:56] not
[54:56] listen to what he has to say to us
[54:59] and so many were overthrown
[55:02] in the wilderness they lost their
[55:06] desire for this word for god
[55:09] for this message they lost their
[55:13] fire they lost their enthusiasm
[55:17] they lost their first love amen
[55:21] that revival that the seventh thunders
[55:24] is supposed to bring in their
[55:25] soul cooling off
[55:29] cooling off somewhere they lost it
[55:33] because satan was allowed to overthrow
[55:37] them
[55:38] in this present world in which
[55:41] we're living now the bible tells us that
[55:46] more
[55:46] the nation of moab which were like
[55:50] uh brothers to israel
[55:53] they were a good nation
[55:56] they were a great nation and a brother
[56:00] to israel but you see
[56:05] even though there were religious
[56:08] as like israel and had the sacrifices
[56:12] just like israel and could
[56:16] make the offerings just like israel
[56:19] that was wonderful but it was
[56:23] israel by election
[56:26] was the one that god was leading
[56:30] by his holy spirit amen
[56:33] and that's the problem in the world
[56:35] today
[56:37] the true believer may be
[56:40] criticized maybe called all manner of
[56:45] names
[56:46] in front of their faces behind their
[56:47] backs wherever let me
[56:49] do that not realizing
[56:54] they're falling into that more bite
[56:56] spirit
[56:58] not realizing as religious as moab was
[57:03] they failed to get the revelation
[57:07] that israel was
[57:11] holding on or was held
[57:14] by god's election that was the thai post
[57:19] that held them to the fullness of the
[57:22] word
[57:23] amen oh praise god and sometimes we as
[57:27] true believers
[57:28] we staggering around we look like we're
[57:32] making mistakes
[57:33] we looks like we're struggling in our
[57:35] walk sometimes
[57:37] but let me tell you it's god himself
[57:40] that's
[57:40] leading you that's god himself that's
[57:44] guiding you amen praise god
[57:47] but on the outside they think you are
[57:49] just wiggling around and
[57:50] moving around like that my friends but
[57:53] it's the holy spirit
[57:55] himself that is leading you amen
[57:58] thank god you are walking and moving
[58:02] with the smitten
[58:03] rock right beside you the open
[58:06] word with revelation gushing out to
[58:09] quench your
[58:10] thirst and quench you that you may never
[58:14] thirst again
[58:15] your soul will feel so refreshed
[58:19] in the presence of the lord no
[58:22] revelation fail to recognize
[58:29] the spoken word the smitten word
[58:34] the rock christ smitten on calvary
[58:39] open up and revealing himself to you
[58:42] that you might know him in the power of
[58:44] his resurrection
[58:46] and in the fellowship of his suffering
[58:49] amen
[58:50] the life came out of that word that was
[58:53] smitten
[58:54] there in the wilderness water came out
[58:57] type of the word
[58:58] they smote him on calvary
[59:02] amen isaiah 53
[59:05] oh he was wounded for our transgressions
[59:08] and out of him came what came out the
[59:12] life of the word the revelation
[59:16] of the word to lead us and to guide us
[59:20] into this day and moab could not see
[59:23] the revelation of the word but they
[59:27] allow themselves to be led by ideas
[59:31] and the thoughts of men rather
[59:34] than to be led by the revelation of the
[59:37] holy spirit
[59:38] i'm going to wind this up now i'm going
[59:41] to wind this
[59:42] up my friends praise
[59:45] god amen remember friends
