[0:00] we washed our robes in the Crimson
[0:02] Fountain and we are the sons of God we
[0:06] are the sons of God we are the sons of
[0:10] God we wash our Rob in the
[0:14] Crimson we are son we are the children
[0:18] of God
[0:20] hallelujah amen a Son of God a daughter
[0:24] of God you know what that is it's a
[0:26] lesser the same thing that the prophet
[0:29] was
[0:30] as a wave sheep that the god serve came
[0:33] in him and spoke through him is that
[0:36] right we are a lesser manifestation of
[0:40] that Messiah
[0:42] yet the God who serve one place that
[0:45] think he said that one day they realize
[0:48] the god they seek is within them God in
[0:52] you you are a walking son and daughter
[0:55] of God you're a you're you're you're
[0:58] predestinated predestinated
[1:00] you a body that was
[1:02] predestinated a body has not prepared me
[1:06] what body the bride he prepared for him
[1:09] from the four the foundations of the
[1:11] world and you were a part of that so we
[1:14] are the prepared people that was set
[1:16] here uh and and we we we all make
[1:19] different because like Paul said he said
[1:22] in a house there's vessels for all uses
[1:25] and everything else like that all the
[1:27] vessels are there but they're for
[1:28] different uses so here we are are
[1:30] vessels of God to contain God so God
[1:32] could come in us when he chooses and
[1:34] operate that's why he says take not what
[1:36] you going to say what you going to do
[1:38] and about this and about that but in
[1:40] that hour the heavenly father is going
[1:43] to speak through you he's going to act
[1:46] through you for the glory of God Amen
[1:48] you believe that believe that kind of
[1:51] Holy Spirit still
[1:53] operates right not from the public right
[1:56] down to the P right down to the very
[1:59] least right to the
[2:02] children that the same Holy Spirit
[2:04] praise the Lord operates like that and
[2:07] moves within the hearts of God's people
[2:10] praise the Lord hallelujah amen now we
[2:14] know what the True Believer it's the
[2:17] revelation of God being revealed in the
[2:20] age we are living in that's what it is
[2:23] the revelation of the word of God
[2:26] revealed in the age that we are living
[2:29] in Hallelujah so you you you got to let
[2:32] your life light up by that word for your
[2:37] day and for your you can gather a lot of
[2:39] truth from Luther Wesley all these men
[2:41] read their writings read their it's
[2:43] wonderful reading them but because you
[2:46] now have uh the people out there in the
[2:49] world they have a world view they view
[2:52] things through the lens of the world and
[2:55] the system of the world develop their
[2:57] world view right these are the people
[3:00] are viewing it through the Lutheran lens
[3:03] this lens that lens that lens But Here
[3:06] we are now we are viewing it through the
[3:09] telescopic uh eyes of Prophecy right a
[3:15] prophet came and we are looking at it
[3:17] with a totally different view they're
[3:19] looking at the same word and they're
[3:21] seeing something totally different you
[3:23] looking at the same word and the think
[3:25] is
[3:26] magnified because you're looking at it
[3:28] from the re ration brought to you by a
[3:32] prophet Hallelujah so when you look when
[3:35] you look what do you
[3:38] see that brother R asked when you look
[3:41] what do you see then he preach another
[3:44] message I'm seeing
[3:46] God he seeing God are you seeing God I
[3:50] see him every
[3:51] day I see him all the day praise the
[3:54] name of the Lord I see him when I was uh
[3:57] in the days when I worked in
[3:58] construction and I dropped a 2 in chisel
[4:01] which is a white one like that 2 and 1/2
[4:03] in and it went straight
[4:06] down and that thing went bang and
[4:10] dropped right near my
[4:12] toes and said oh praise God hallelujah
[4:16] amen my toes would have kept walking and
[4:19] I still standing
[4:21] there it's right amen but it's God's
[4:25] grace
[4:27] Hallelujah many little things like that
[4:29] it's God that's keeping us so we have to
[4:33] understand we operate under the
[4:35] inspiration of living God and but the
[4:38] revealed word for the hour now let me
[4:40] wind this up right now now listen to
[4:42] what he says here now God
[4:46] misunderstood God misin
[4:49] misinterpreted amen think about it all
[4:52] them prophets prophesied against their
[4:56] Nation prophesied put curses upon them
[4:59] and they were
[5:03] misunderstood why were they
[5:05] misunderstood because they were true
[5:08] servants they were doing the will of God
[5:11] for that hour they were doing the
[5:14] service of God therefore they themselves
[5:18] were Miss on the stone you understand
[5:21] that if they called me this and call me
[5:25] that in the uh Green Tree when the tree
[5:28] get dry I mean what are they going to
[5:31] call you if I'm the Lord and Master they
[5:33] call me me what are they going to call
[5:36] you they persecute me they're going to
[5:37] persecute you they misunderstood him
[5:40] they'll misunderstand you misinterpret
[5:43] the word you are part of the word
[5:44] they'll misinterpret even some of the
[5:46] things you're trying to tell them praise
[5:48] the name of the Lord hallelujah yes sir
[5:50] they were God's servant doing the will
[5:52] of God doing the service of God
[5:54] therefore they were misunderstood and
[5:57] anybody that follows God is
[5:58] misunderstood and their actions
[6:01] misinterpreted he was misunderstood the
[6:03] wise men were misunderstood but yet they
[6:07] were following a genuine Supernatural
[6:10] sign to find the king and yet they were
[6:14] misunderstood even though the very
[6:16] scripture said there was going to be a
[6:18] star rising out of Jacob according to
[6:21] the Prophecies of Daniel and the King uh
[6:24] the king and those wild wise men should
[6:26] have known it but they misinterpreted
[6:29] the word for their hour amen he was
[6:34] misunderstood and see and then he goes
[6:36] on saying
[6:39] Noah on whenever people get under
[6:42] inspiration he said people like Noah he
[6:45] was misunderstood in this day building
[6:47] an ark where no rain falling yet they
[6:50] don't even know what rain is and he went
[6:52] through a bunch of people Daniel
[6:54] misunderstood in his age every Elijah
[6:57] telling them the rain is going to fall
[7:00] whatever I hear B rain the next you
[7:03] better take a chariot and rush back to
[7:05] the pal because you're going to have
[7:07] problems see always misunderstood a
[7:10] virgin will conceive and bear a son
[7:13] misunderstood see misinterpreting the
[7:16] word forly out because they're not you
[7:19] do ER not knowing the scriptures are the
[7:22] power of God if they were looking and
[7:24] understanding the prophecies that were
[7:26] given their thousands of years before
[7:28] not one but several
[7:30] they would have been able to interpret
[7:31] that word right but what Jesus saying
[7:34] you had so many opportunities to to
[7:37] interpret the word and still you
[7:40] misinterpret it you are not of God cuz
[7:44] if you were of God you would have known
[7:46] me the word you would have known me the
[7:49] word they so they didn't know the word
[7:53] and God didn't God gave them enough time
[7:56] God doesn't BR a man to judgment without
[7:57] first Waring that's right Prophet after
[8:00] prophets and prophesying prophesy
[8:02] prophesy and all those prophecies they
[8:04] didn't have the anointing to be able to
[8:07] weave the word together and have the
[8:11] Revelation come out of it and therefore
[8:13] they were walking in
[8:15] darkness they were walking in darkness
[8:19] contrary to the word of God hallelujah
[8:22] they misinterpreted even Jesus in the
[8:24] form of a man oh my think of it they
[8:28] misinterpreted he himself the word of
[8:32] God hallelujah praise God forever more
[8:35] so brothers and sisters amen you
[8:38] misinterpreted the people shouting
[8:40] screaming holling hosana blessed coming
[8:43] the Lord call you crazy you know he's
[8:45] going into all of this here they start
[8:47] to call you crazy because more and more
[8:50] your life is going to go out of sink
[8:52] with what's going on out there in the
[8:53] world do you know
[8:55] that just normally continue living this
[8:58] message and watch you going to start
[9:00] looking more like a square peg trying to
[9:02] fit in a rung hole you don't have to try
[9:05] to make yourself funny or like brother
[9:08] BR said walk with a 10 pound Bible on
[9:10] your arm with your head up in the air
[9:12] trying so spiritual you don't have to do
[9:14] that you even trying to
[9:16] hide but after a while you can't hide
[9:19] because a city s on the hill can't be
[9:21] here and caught the word and if the word
[9:24] is in you the light is going to shine in
[9:27] you bright and bright musicians is
[9:29] praise the Lord let's just have a a
[9:31] closing himym and a closing prayer and
[9:33] we can leave go to our home you can
[9:35] think on these things and see the both
[9:38] sides the positive and the negative
[9:40] negatively we should not misinterpret
[9:42] the word because misinterpretation of
[9:45] the word identifies that you are not in
[9:47] the AE you are not of the age in which
[9:49] you're living is that right and the word
[9:53] being misinterpreted to
[9:55] you actually strengthens you and defies
[10:00] you because you are kept by the anchor
[10:03] that God placed within you for in Daniel
[10:07] 7 we he says for the foundation stone
[10:10] was laid in you before the foundations
[10:13] of the world Hallelujah so you are
