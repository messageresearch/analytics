TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] praise god here we are again in the presence of the lord hallelujah we've got we have one more river to cross and we thank god for the honor and privilege of serving him before we cross that great divide may the great holy spirit of almighty god guide us in our hearts and in our thoughts here tonight our topic will be from the church age series the law of reproduction adoption the law of reproduction our text or scripture is found in genesis chapter 1 verse 11 and may god take this teaching and send it to whoever he will may it wing its way to wherever the great dove of peace the great holy spirit of almighty god will take it to who needs it to find a nesting place within their hearts may god bless you at this particular time gracious father as we come tonight we pray that this great holy spirit will send the fires of god and the anointing oil of the great holy spirit that father you will take this verse of genesis 1 11 to give us spiritual understanding as you gave to the prophet of this 20th century so let the spirit of god flow and let the word go forth to quench our spiritual thirst for we ask it in the name of jesus christ as we walk through this wilderness of this weary land in jesus name we ask journey's mercy amen hallelujah genesis chapter 1 verse 11 and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so praise god hallelujah now this is a message for the church of god for as god's servant was in his presence one night the holy spirit spoken said pick up your pen and write and so he wrote these words by which we have received inspiration and direction by the great holy spirit this of course is a message to the last day church of the living god the church that is to be the bride of jesus christ because this message has to do with the word and with the bride as our scripture tells us and makes clear to us the principle of genesis 1 11. and if i might just bring my personal thought in here at this point in time this scripture is a blessing particularly to me because it was this scripture that the holy spirit used to open up my mind and heart and soul to the fullness of the revelation of god in this time and in this hour i was on a greyhound bus and being bored with the length of the trip i started to fall half asleep between sleep and wake and there i heard a voice every seed shall bring forth after its kind genesis 1 11 whose seed are you going to be mine or someone else's and i answered yours lord and i could feel the presence accepting that and began to die away and then i came to my senses realize i'm i'm talking to somebody that that is not here physically here but then i realized that was god directing me that you have to look directly to me and i will reveal to you the word and i will speak to you from time to time and praise god the bible began to open up the message began to open up and one thing led to another anyway i just wanted to say this scripture is of direct importance and vital importance to the true elected of god those that are of the members of this bride body of jesus christ for the law of reproduction as written in the bible is that every specie will remain towards the end of time as the same specie but in the course of natural and human events it will reproduce after its kind the species will not jump over to another species the pig will not become a lamb or the lamb become a pig or the lion or the tiger become something else they will remain whatever species there were from the beginning when god spoke them into existence god now from the word is bringing this principle and law of reproduction to our thoughts that according to genesis 1 11 that is the way it will remain from eternity to eternity every seed will bring forth after its kind and it goes on in the scripture to say whose seed is in itself or thank god for that marvelous thought that if we are elected if we are called if we are the bride of christ then we come with the seed of god already in itself in us we already are imbued we are ready in filled we are ready uh having in the center of our being the very life seed or the seed of life of the living god within us glory to his name and therefore as you know in the natural whatever seed that plant has originated from germinated from whatever seed that seed will produce a plant after its kind then as the plant moves into its maturity on their day sunshine whether it's s-u-n shine or s-o-n shine that plant begins to mature in its spiritual and natural growth then the plant will then from the springtime of life the summer of growth it will come to the fruitfulness of harvest and the fall and so seed life plant life and then fruitfulness so here we are going through the cycle of life of the seed of god in us the plant growing the plant life of that seed growing and beginning to bear the fruit so we know that that law applies to the true church of the living god for today that applies and so we can take this principle and apply it to god's original church now the first church god planted book of acts chapter 1 2 you know the entire book of acts god planted an original church and that church bore all manner of spiritual fruits read the book of acts my friends study the book of acts be inspired by the book of acts uh may the things in the book of acts inspire you to act upon the word to live the word of god to reproduce the word of god for when we myself and my good friend uh brother michael patterson were just boys we read in the book of acts and believed it to be exactly true that it was right it was god's promise for this day and for this hour and therefore we took it for granted i'm not just saying oh we just trusted god we took it for granted that that's the way it's supposed to be and as we acted upon the word the word began to be be on fire the word began to explode the dunamis begins to strike the devil in all of his hideouts tidy halls foxholes it begins to blast him out from wherever he was hiding and we discovered a new life a new supernatural walk with god we began to discern and detect the devil behind the scenery apparent scenery of things that there is another realm there there are other dimensions and in these those dimensions in that other realm oh the angels dwell the demons dwell they oh the supernatural moves within that realm oh my friends and then god moved and revivals began to break out wherever we would go and the life and the ministries of many churches and of many ministers and individuals around the world have been impacted by this move and power of the holy spirit this principle of god that every seed shall not me might every seed shall bring forth after its kind then if the early church in its planting time of acts chapter 2 began to produce men and women filled with the holy ghost anointed by the spirit of the living god like peter who stood up on the day of pentecost and said this is that spoken by the prophet joel can't you stand today and say this is that spoken by the prophet of malachi 4. we may not be accepted by all as that but that's what we see in the word of god and what god's spirit has produced not one time wrong not one time fail but the word always being fulfilled you may not understand it and you think it's failed or you think it's wrong but the holy spirit is used that man to reproduce the life of christ and the manifestation of the word of god for this day and now that church that seed church that was planted in the book of acts through the ages has grown through seven church ages producing the the stock the leaves coming up right my friends to the time of fruitfulness and harvest and i believe my friends this is the harvest time i believe we're in the harvest time oh the lord is calling the savior's calling glory to god hallelujah amen i feel the pull i heard a voice the inspiration of the holy spirit strikes your soul and calls you to walk a little closer than you then you work walking before walk a little deeper praise god and not to get used to this uh the darkness the lukewarmness the coldness the cheapening of the message the masking of the message my friends the counterfeiting of the word of god the imitation of it and not the reality of the life of christ we don't want just an imitation of christ but we want the pure life of christ flowing out of us like rivers of living waters amen praise god forevermore i believe that's why our leaves shall not wither the the leaves the what we produce our praise our worship or the fruitfulness will not wither because we got our roots planted amen in the ever-present water all in the rock amen the underground streams of god streams in the desert amen you're planted in the presence of god healing is there salvation is there joy is there peace is there amen hallelujah my friends god's spirit you're you're planted your strength your anointing your joy your peace all your needs are met because you are drawing from this unseen source you're drawing from the presence of almighty god hallelujah that same church what else can it produce we look out in our day and in our time and we are told oh this is the church oh or that is the church or i have a different brand it is the it is this church and it has a different name and that one has another name and different name and each one let me tell you my friends the genuine church of the living god will always approximate with the original church we must live by the blueprint for god has given us the blueprint in the book of acts and i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it why if that my friend seed continues listen do you know the first the oak trees we have today all originated from the original oak tree that came from the original seed that grew up in the garden of eden even so with the true church of the living god it should come from that original seed and be a pattern be a blueprint from that blueprint it should be the same kind of a church amen with the presence of god with the power of god with the very persons god had in it with the ministries fivefold that are there to fan out the word of god that is in his hand to thoroughly purge the floor for his glory and honor this is what god is showing us today from his word amen that same seed that study the church will come forth once again and be like that original seed church because it is from the same seed it is of the same seed hallelujah praise god and that's why i believe that this last day bright church will be so near to the headstone praise god hallelujah amen course you know the headstone is the capstone the hamstone is the keystone the headstone is the cornerstone that holds up the building and gives the entire uh things uh strength and structure amen so here it is my friends that that this bright church will be a super church let me use the word a supernatural church glory to god hallelujah amen and physically she's natural but spiritually she's super so she's a supernatural church a super race of people and new creation born by the seed of the holy spirit for the spoken word of god is god's seed it's god's original seed not a man's seed that would produce a natural child but the seed word of the living god will produce a true genuine spirit-born child of the living god by his supernatural birth oh we thank god for this super church this super race hallelujah praise god that will walk as close as they can with him until they begin to look like him they begin to act like him near to the headstone that same stone others reject she embraces that stone oh glory to god she embraces him as her lord praise god amen yes sir this she does in order that she might be united with him and recognize that she is one with him praise god and if he when he was here he was is the seed of god and he was the manifestation of the father he was the manifestation of god here on earth in a natural body in a natural form so will the sons and daughters of god be in this last day as they accept the word and as they the word of god takes them over and begins to have his governorship his preeminence as they submit and surrender in obedience to his lordship or praise god forevermore led by the holy spirit anointed by the holy spirit used of the holy spirit then we see another display of jesus christ the same yesterday today and forevermore manifestations of the living god a denomination cannot produce that for the air of a different seed a perverted seed is what forms a denomination the same kind of uh seed that produce cane where eve hybridized mongrelized the plan and purpose of god as i believe and teach by an illegitimate affair with the serpent who was not a snake for the bible tells us from today on your belly you will go amen praise god and many other scriptures we will not get into that but she committed adultery and produced an illegitimate mongrelized son he was a hybrid to the word of god and the promise of the hour and so has the church wandered away from adam the second adam the word and now by spiritual affair with the devil instead of producing 100 the pure word of god for every seed must bring forth after its kind what has she produced the word of god mixed with fundamental statements dogmas creeds all kinds of various encyclicals and so on she has produced something mixed with the word using their the word of god to give their sayings and their manmade creeds credibility using the word of god to give their own thoughts authority and believability oh may god help us they produce these creeds and dogmas and statements and standards mixed in with the word of god and this mongrelizing of the word this fornicating the word oh my has produced nothing but a hybrid product or products amen think of it the god's first son adam on the earth who was of god's spoken seed word god gave him a wife or bride and the purpose of that life or bride was for him one he was alone to have fellowship and then he was to have that fellowship which was god showing that he himself was alone and he needed to have fellowship that is why he was going to have a church as adam's wife came from his side his wife will come from his side and so those scriptures would all be fulfilled anyway but here it is praise god hallelujah that this wife the purpose of a wife the purpose of that bride the reason for her existence was that she and him would together have fellowship as they walked life's road together all praise his marvelous name the king and i walked life road together oh that he would love me a poor beggar that he would love me praise god no wonder he took me from the marrick play and put my feet in a rock to stay or to think that the king and i can walk life's road together and promise i will never never leave you to walk home alone oh praise god amen what a story of redemption what a love story in this bible this entire book is a book of redemption is the book of god's love for us is this good book of god's protection god's provision god's guidance hallelujah for his children and especially for his wife his wife walking down the road with her so isaiah 4 said the wife this bride was given to the first adam for fellowship for companionship amen and she was also given to him for the purpose of reproduction so that he could reproduce himself for to fulfill scripture for every seed shall bring forth after its kind oh praises marvelous name but adam's wife eve fell by sin by hybridization the sin of producing a hybrid product which was not of him it was not of the original seed amen and we know that cain was not of adam's seed it plainly tells you in 1st john cain who was of that wicked one amen and jesus said he was a murderer and a liar from the beginning amen praise god we won't go through all these scriptures where john even knows about it and says your generation of vipers and jesus said you you're nothing but your like your father the devil he was a liar from the beginning amen and cain was a liar from the beginning where's your brother abel i don't know and he very well knew that he had already killed him so he was a liar from the beginning and the murderer amen so a wife given for fellowship companionship and for the purpose of reproduction hallelujah amen but you see what has happened just like it was with the first adam before the lord jesus could marry the church the devil gets to her before him with all manner of roman creeds and all manner of dogmas and all manner of things in her mind and heart and teaching and so she fell she failed the test she was tested eve in the garden by the serpent quoting or preaching to her the word of god has not god said so and he quoted the word of god did not god say and he quoted the word of god satan knew the word of god and he knows it better than most theologians if not all of them you are going to put your puny human mind against a being that's been around over 6 000 years and more and try to compete with that except god help you god's spirit anoint you god's spirit inspire you god's spirit opens the word of god to you you are walking in ladies and darkness and you know not of what you speak so as adam's bride was tested by the serpent using the word of god so must this church so-called this people of this last day of whom you call out the people for his name or for his wife to take on his name and to be named after him amen praise god brother sister so has that church failed and took satan's lie way back out of nicaea right on down through the ages and god raised up various men who caught glimmers of truth stronger and stronger until this last day where one man was use of god to declare to us the accumulation of that truth that was building back through the ages to fulfill the word god spoke of that i will restore saith the lord the years the conquer pommelworm and caterpillar have eaten god promised it that he would restore back the word of god hallelujah amen eve had the choice to believe god's word and live or to doubt it and to doubt it is not saying oh i don't believe god just by accepting what the devil gave to her she had already renounced and she had ready disbelieved the word of god and today just to reject god's word and accept the serpent seed serpent speaking through the voice of some denomination then you have just disbelieved the word of god back to the bible back to the original word go back to it and let the holy spirit teach you and live so that you might walk in the footsteps of our savior and the footsteps of the apostle remember my origin my thought the original church is one seed and that seed must keep rip you know reproducing itself and it will bring forth after its kind doesn't matter how many ages aeons or centuries past the oak trees of today came from the seeds of the oak tree from the garden of eden the same sun that's shining today in the heavens it's the same sun that shannon adam is shining upon on us and therefore we must realize and recognize the same word of god that shone upon the prophets the apostles every one of them it's the same sun trying to shine upon you take down your your or your umbrellas get rid of all those shades and come into the sunlight oh praise god hallelujah heavenly sunshine heavenly sunshine flooding my soul with the glory divine oh praise god this is the sunshine of god that shines upon the word and lights up the pages and you begin to see them as you have never seen them before thank god that little group of the tree true seed word of god is in every age from elijah right on to christ from christ right back to eternity twelve disciples one he at one the height of his ministry had five to eight hundred disciples following him then when he began to say i and my father are one then he when he began to say eat my flesh and freak my blood or you have no part in me you see they did not recognize what he was saying and they were too quick to say he's wrong or he's false or he's off or he's trying to make himself god no let the holy spirit lead guide and unveil the word of god amen so here it is friends that little group of the true seed of the word of god will absolutely present herself to the lord jesus christ as his beloved bride because she has kept herself a virgin to the word of god kept away from the teachings of man the seeds of man kept away she was not manhandled man used uh or anything of that nature but she stayed with the original pure word of god despite the repudiation the rejections oh my the calling of names the persecution the reproaches that she had to bear amen but thank god mary knew that she was carrying the christ which was a product of the spoken word seed of the living god and she did not care what price she had to pay what names they called her she knew that after a while the seed life that was in her will proves it prove itself by reproducing itself by manifesting the word hallelujah or praise god and declare the name of the father declare the mission declare the works and the word of the father hallelujah glory to god amen yes sir all praise god and true so we know that through the members of this bride body of god in this last day that the word of god will again be fulfilled as it was fulfilled through mary glory to god for the promised word of the hour came to mary hallelujah as i've said before to you the promised word or the pre-predestinated the word of god always comes to the prophesied or predestinated vessel of the hour and so the word had to pass her way the word had to come to mary and the word came to mary and when it came to mary what did it do it reproduced god himself that by the christ of god in her amen and when it was made manifest or came to a birth what did it do my friends it was the manifestation of the promise or the prophecy it was the manifestation of the word for that hour and for that day oh praise god hallelujah blessed be his holy name now listen friends while i'm speaking don't just pick up ears you know analyzing this and analyzing that just look at the at the stream of truth and follow what it is i'm trying to say don't get hung up on how i said it or how i expressed it but look at the truth is it the truth or is it not the truth turned upon the promise and word of god for the hour let the crown you might gain amen hallelujah it was an angel that brought the word of god to mary it was an angel i said that brought the word to mary then that virgin accepted the word spoken by the angel and what she brought forth was the word of god made manifest the living word of god now in this day the seventh angel of revelation chapter 10 verse 7 who heard the voice of the mighty angel and declared the promises of god finishing of the mystery of god to us hallelujah and spoke the word to us to the truth those who will listen those who will recognize that he was god's servant for this hour never really had a gentile prophet but god gave us a gentile prophet in this 20th century and i believe his name is william marion branham god sending the seventh angel he unveiled or broke the seven seals the breaking of those seven seals especially of the seventh the opening up of the word of god making the secrets of god manifested we believe that word and by believing that word in our heart impregnated your soul with the seed word of the living god hallelujah because we accepted god's word amen hallelujah to manifest so that we could manifest luke 17 30. jesus said as it was in the days of noah the days of not so shall it be in that day when the son of man is being revealed not a son of man but the son of man not in the headship not in the one man jesus but now in a many-membered body of a bright church here he is once again in human form god living in his people god above us god with us now god in us the holy spirit working out his plan of redemption amen thank god so praise god here we are brothers if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again but the word of god is in the bride of jesus christ as it was in mary and the bride has the mind of christ for he she knows what he wants to do with the word hallelujah just as mary knew the purpose of why she had to bear jesus and what he was going to do saving his people from their sins she could bear the shame because she knew what she was carrying the message the word that she was carrying was going to fulfill scripture amen to save the people from their unbelief amen praise god hallelujah so we have the mind of christ we have caught the thoughts of god and we know what he wants done with the word praise god hallelujah or praise god everyone has the bible and that's okay to have the bible but it's the bible comes to life only when the holy spirit the spirit quickens the word of god to your heart and your life and your experience oh praise god when the spirit quickens the word then and only then does the word come to pass then and only then will the word make itself manifest thank god the bride will not sway she will not swerve she will not bend she will not break she will not divert away from this word of god but shall take her stand upon the rock revelation of the fullness of the word of god the winds may blow the storms may come she may lean this way rock that way but she's still standing on the rock of the word of god she's not coming off of it we're gonna have chests we will have trials but we are not moving we have blessed assurance and we have anchored up ourselves upon the word of the living god hallelujah amen praise god we know what when jesus was here upon earth he did not complete all of his work that he was supposed to do amen praise god and all you caught to me when he said oh it is finished that work of redemption was finished but all of his work was not finished amen praise god hallelujah amen because he was what that was just the beginning of the creation of god hallelujah but now here we are in the end times when we are now at the stage of finishing the mystery of god oh praise god the mystery of god made manifest in this hour amen in a bright body and here we see the fulfillment of god's word taking place and he will now fulfill through his bride church the work he will finish his work through her that was specified for him to do for this specific time praise god hallelujah i'm thankful to god in the midst of this madness we can have power and we can have poise and that will come from the quiet authority the quiet peace that comes from this settled mind and heart that is certain of god and has settled and uses the word of god as its foundation praise god hallelujah amen we rest upon his word we rest we find spiritual rest upon the revelation of his word for this hour and from this we draw power and poise in the midst of peril in the midst my friends of all life's puzzles we draw this power and poise for true anointing true anointing true power is to allow the holy spirit to use his anointing through you with an inner peace and calm that only god's spirit can give may god bless you my brother my sister rejoice rejoice and again i say rejoice god bless you i'll see you next week uh next sunday actually where
