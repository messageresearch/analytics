us we're no longer um uh who we used to be amen we're not exactly what we want to be but for sure we are not who we used to be amen praise God and so we thank God for that welcome everybody into this

welcome all the representation from all of the different churches God bless you um you know we we certainly appreciate you being here supporting these M uh these meetings this weekend because we want to see God move we want to see the Lord move and do great things in our midst amen um in in the scripture here in 2 Timothy 2: 20- 22 it says but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of Earth and some to honor and some to dishonor if a man therefore Purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified and meat for the Master's use and prepared unto every good work now listen here there's the inspiration flee also youthful lusts but follow righteousness Faith charity peace and with them and this is the theme for this weekend call on the Lord out of a pure heart I believe that there can be great change in your hearts and in your lives this weekend and it's going to start here tonight but God is saying you need to call out of a pure heart amen you know uh Samuel one day was called of the Lord and said Samuel we need to anoint a new king over Israel because because Saul you know Saul did not have a heart for the Lord Saul had a disobedient heart he would not listen to the Lord and so the Lord said we need to call somebody to lead Israel we need to place into position somebody that is going to feed and edify and bless this body my body amen and so he went to Jesse's house and he said Jesse bring out all your sons because the Lord wants to anoint a new king Jesse thought with his mind Jesse thought because of the way they looked on the outside listen God is not looking at the outside of you he's looking for a pure heart tonight he's looking for a pure heart this weekend and if you approach him in that way he will anoint you amen David had a heart for the Lord David was a man after God's Own Heart what was it inside of David it was that call that deep call within his heart to have the Lord do the great things that he had been doing in his life and and I believe you can have a freshh start tonight but you need to call on him out of a pure heart tonight we want to welcome a brother that I've just met

bit I maybe just take a seat for a few minutes amen and then we'll get into the word I just keeping you but um we we we you know just saw you understand and you know me a little bit but I was born in Ghana originally and uh as B the age of 10 years old moved to Italy and so I am an Italian that's why he said don't try to figure me out I am an Italian even though I don't look like one but I am an Italian and it was incredible to me for Dan to find out that he's an Italian and he speaks Italian and and I love to chat with him sometime in Italian and so so I do my siblings we all speak Italian and so we we we are Italians but then we moved to Ireland and uh that's where we picked up the accent and uh I guess you figured out a so yeah and so we moved to Ireland and stayed there for a while and then about six years ago the Lord brought us to Edmonton and it's been a blessing to be there and and the Lord is sure um blessed us over there and we love the the Saints there the ministry there and and and we thank the Lord amen for for what he's been doing amen we have lots of things written then here we know I haven't said them all but we want to say God bless you and I want to say we love you with all our hearts and we appreciate the invitation and we're looking forward to what the Lord will do amen don't look at me it's not about me amen I just happen to be the vessel standing here but the one we expecting in these meance is the Lord Jesus he's the one we're look to amen so so look Beyond me look beyond my mannerism look beyond my way and let's look onto the Lord amen let's let's listen and hear what he's got to say to us amen I am just the microphone and he's the one doing to speaking amen and so if he's speaking to your hearts don't think that it's me I don't know any of you over here so don't you think that it is me it's the Lord doing it amen so let's lay the Lord to do it amen how many say Amen to that amen well let's stand on the feet this evening amen and we'll take the Bibles amen we open the Book of Mark this even and amen just want to go to Mark Mark chapter 5 Mark chapter 5 amen Mark chter 5 we read from verse 35 to verse 41 or 43 sorry verse 35 to 43 Mark chapter 5 amen said while he yet spake there came from the rulers of the synagogue say certain which said the daughter is dead why troubl as th the master any for as soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue Be not Afraid only believe and he suffered no man to follow him sath Peter and James and John the brother of James and he come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and see the tumult and them that wept and wailed greatly and when he was come in he saith unto them why make ye this adore and Weep the damel is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed them to scorn but when he had put them all at he talk it to the father and the mother and the damel and them that were with him and entered in where the damel was lying and he took the damsel boy the hand and said unto her tell it to call me which is being interpreted damsel I say unto thee arise and straight away the damsel arose and walked for she was of the age of 12 years and they were astonished with a great astonishment and he charged them straightly that no man should know it and commanded that something should be given her to it amen may the Lord add his Blessing to the readon of the word you may have you seat amen amen I want to say to you to list the saving and live want to take title this evening the Lord will permit amen we want to speak on when Jesus walks in the story when Jesus walks in the story amen now the stle came told me as we were we were praying for these meetings and seeking the face of the Lord and which direction to go special in the first service you know many times they said that's the O breaking service so we're seeking the face of the Lord which way would go the direction we would go and and I received a a a poem from from a sister in cral area and and and I began to read the poem and as I was reading the poem The Lord start to lay on my heart to to God this direction for the first service and so just before we start was all right I like to read the poem amen and and the poem goes and it says this when Jesus walks in the story is different the child that's ding the brother that's gone the heart that's hungered disease the wors on the room that is filled with a whale of Despair the life that is broken beyond all repair when Jesus walks in the story is different stand still and see what seems like the end rearranges to become the prayers and then life more abundant in his word boy his Touch where you had nothing God creates much when Jesus walks in the story is different don't be in a hurry to pen the last page don't lay down your weapon don't question your fed you've called on the Lord name be still and know he's not long coming somewhere else to go if you just wait a moment see Jesus walked in that's why we taking this title when Jesus walks in the story I wonder to sa and a man if we could just begin and and and and begin to have create a little scene the sav and am man and you get to notice that like drama to turns a little more and and so as we go on in these meetings but if we just open the scene this evening Amen in the book of Genesis amen Genesis chapter 1 if we just take the first four verses the scripture says that in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was God and God voided the light from the darkness and God called the light there and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning was the first day and as we read the scripture you know we can see how God began to unfold himself in this great drama but brand will tell us there was this drama that was being played and and God began to unfold himself in this great drama and the purpose of this great drama was for him to reveal himself amen reveal the attributes amen that were the inside that was on the inside of him he wanted to express the attribute as a savior amen he wanted to express the attribute as a redeemer amen he wanted to express the attribute as a redeemer as as a Healer as a deliverer amen and the scripture says that as God will begin to to unfold this drama amen he needed a place to unfold the drama amen and the place that God chose the unfold the drama was the heavens and the Earth amen he chose that place to unfold the drama amen but now the scripture says that the place that God was going to unfold this drama was a place that was with form amen it was a place that was void and dark Ness covered the fs of the deep of this place amen so so that we could see there was a chaos there was a Darkness amen but then something began to happen amen are you with me this evening then something be to happen amen what was happening what do we see all of a sudden the curtain amen of this great drama began to be pulled away amen this curtain began to be pulled away and and we all maybe look with carefulness to see what is B to happen and what was happening in the moment was that God was walking in the the story of his creation amen as he begin to pull back this curtain amen of of the darkness you know God was stepping in he was walking in in the story of his creation and you know how God walked in he walked in by the movement of the spirit amen that's how he walked into his creation to begin to change the scenario that we were looking at of the Clare darkness and Chaos amen he began to walk in by the movement of the spirit and I believe that this evening we are here for one purpose purp Amen to see the moving of the spirit amen listen we not here to see the moving of a man we not here to see the Moving On Emotion amen we're not here to see the movement of an intellectual Faith but we here to see the movement of the spirit of God Amen because whenever the spirit of God move something happens amen whenever he moves I tell you Church something happens things don't stay the same because we know in the scriptures that when he moved on the face of the deep in the darkness something happened amen you with me to Sav him when he moves something happen amen so if we are expecting the moving of the Lord of in this meeting then be ready because something is fixing to happen in your life because whenever he walks in the story something changes about the story amen are you would me this evening something changes toey the story whenever he walks into the story amen oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah now we know very well amen that the movement of the spirit is always is accompanied by the spoken word amen the movement of the spirit is always accompanied by the spoken word in other words whenever God walks in the story he walks in the story with the spoken word he walks in the story with dust sayeth the Lord amen he doesn't walk in the story with a maybe he doesn't walk with in the story with a Wandering mind but he walks in the story with aurity Amen to say this is going to be he has th say of the Lord when he walks in the story amen are you with me this evening when he walks in he walks in with th say the Lord right from the beginning when he began to move the scripture tell us that he said let there be Lo and there was Lord amen what was God teaching us right there he was teaching us that whenever he speaks whatever he says it must come to pass amen it doesn't matter how long it takes but when he speaks whatever he says it must come to pass amen that was what God was teaching us right there from the beginning that is thus say the Lord will come to pass every time he speaks amen that was what he was teaching us amen and so he speaks in this darkness and as he begin to speak and the Darkness begin to break away you know we see that that something was happening that the L walked in the darkness amen now the ly brother Brandon will say was the manifestation of that spoken word amen he said let there be Loy and the ly appeared so the L was was the manifestation of the spoken word and when the ly walked into the darkness the darkness had to pull away amen when the ly walked into the darkness the chaos had to begin to turn into an order amen when the when the ly walked into the darkness amen see right there at the beginning amen do you know why God said let there Bel light it was because he had some predestinated seed that he had planted are you with me he had some predestinated seed that he had planted right at the beginning but in the darkness those predestinated seed couldn't do anything amen but it had to take the spoken word to bring forth the Lo that will Quicken those spoken those seeds to manifest what was in them now brother Brandon was say it is in it is the rising of the Sun brother brandom would say well there was a time when the world was lying in order to Darkness it was with eight form and was void and was all covered with water and was lying there in the dark disma gloomy atmosphere and it said and the spirit of God moved upon the water and said let there below it God had a reason to do that for down beneath the water there were seeds that he had planted and it had to have the sun Loy to make it live and the first Loyd was ever given in the Earth was God spoken word the first light that ever struck the a was God's spoken word he said let there be light and there was light that turned Darkness into light in order to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the Earth then the spirit of God as it moved with love and compassion at the great day the first day of the dawn of the creation upon the Earth the Sun Rose and swept across it raised and drw it up the waters from the earth and made an atmosphere above and for its first time it was to bring joy and life to the Earth but he seed that was a great hour amen and I believe that this evening I am speaking to some predestinated seeds amen I believe that this evening I'm not just speaking to a group of people I'm speaking to predestinated seed chosen people of God Amen those are the people I believe I'm speaking to this evening and maybe there some of you here amen and I believe that most of us or everyone here has been quickened by that word that has come forth and amen most of us have been quickened by the word that has come forth amen but you see the might be parts of our Lives amen the might be parts of our life that are still lying in darkness amen there might be some parts of our lives that are still lying in a gloomy place that a ling in a dismal Place amen there might be some parts of our life that's a Lon that has hasn't been fully quickened by that spoken word to bring forth what is the seed that is on the inside of you amen but we living in a season amen we're living in a season where God has walked in this age amen God has walked in this age with a spoken word amen and the spoken word that he walked in this age with was to bring forth light that will Quicken the seed that is on the inside of you amen are you with me this evening amen he has walked in this age with a spoken word the message of the hour amen and that message has come Amen to bring forth the light that will Quicken the seed that is on the inside of you amen because you see when that spoken word quickens the seed that is on the inside of the believer it changes it begin to change the story of the believer amen listen the story of that believer might be that that he was on his way into sin he was on his way you know there's a song that say he was on a highway to hell but when God walks in the story amen when he walks in the story the story of that believer begins to turn around why because in that believer is a seed amen now you are the one I'm talking to this evening amen you are the one that has got the seed amen and there is a message that has come to bring a light that will Quicken the seed that is on the inside of you let me say this to you young people this message is not just for preachers are you with me this message is not just for deacons and your mom and your dad this is your message Satan has pulled a curtain in your face trying to tell you that this message is is not yours that this message is too complicated but let me say this to you this message is one of the most simple term that you will ever learn in your entire life this message is more simple than chemistry this message is more simple than biology this message is more simple than algebra why because it's a revelation of God in your life and we're talking about the God of Simplicity don't you allow Satan Amen to P something on your face to let you believe that this message is not for you to let you believe that you're not going to be able to live that's a lawy of the enemy you are a predestinated seed of God no matter what age you are listen the predestinated seed of God has no age if you were predestinated you were born predestinated amen you were born predestinated amen it is not that you come to T years old and all of a sudden God feels like you a good person so he gives you the predestinated seed it doesn't work that way you were born a predestinated seed to produce the word of God hallelujah that is what you are born to be amen God has planted you in this age for a purpose he has planted you in this age so that he can manifest the attribute that is placed on the inside of you that's what he's placed you here for Amen to manifest the attribute that is placed on the inside of you righten because he cares and he loves you and you know when he walks in the story he also always walks in with a transforming power amen he always walks in with a transforming power listen young people God has not come to these meetings just to step in your story you know he's not just come to step in your story and then leave and let you go back in the same things that you've been wanting to man for years that's not God's purpose he has not just come to step in your story for these meetings and then on Monday he walks out of your story but he's come to walk in your story to stay with you in your story he's come to finish the story of your life listen he put the seed in there and it's his desire and his purpose to Quicken that seed he hasn't come to start a work that he won't finish but he's come to start a work that he's detered to finish amen he walks in your story to bring a transformation he walks in your story to break the chains he walks in your story to answer the questions he walks in your story to solve the dilemmas are you with me to saving them he walks in the story to finish the story amen and the only thing that is going to hinder God or the only thing that is going to move God or cause him to step out of the story is unbelief amen that's the only thing that is going to pull God out of the story because you can go all the way back in the Book of Genesis amen listen Adam and Eve were under a perfect word amen God had walked in this story and they were only a perfect word but the moment that Eve disbelieved the word of God Amen the moment she disbel the word of God and believe the lawy of the enemy it caused God not to walk out of the story but to step out of the story amen he stepped out of the story and a CM was created between man and God Amen there was a Chasm created and and now the fellowship that they had was not there anymore amen something had happened sin unbelief has caused God to step out to the story but you see God was not willing for the story to end that way are you with me he was wasn't willing for the story to end that way amen and so God in his great love and mercies amen he put down his Royal clothes amen he took off his Royal clothes and he stepped down on Earth amen just as he did in the beginning amen when he stepped down by the moving of the spirit but this time he didn't step down by the moving of the spirit but he put on flesh amen he put on flesh and he walked back in the story again to redeem a man back to himself amen because the story that he began wasn't a story of defeat the story that he began Satan was not even in the picture amen but now Satan had come in the picture but God said Satan is not going to have the victory so I'm going to walk back and redeem my people and by doing that I'm going to show my attribute as a Healer I'm going to show my attribute as a savior I'm going to show my attribute as a red redemer amen and so he walks in and he takes on flesh amen he takes on flesh as the Son of God and he goes to the cross and he pays the price and I'm just keeping but after he pays the price he ascends to heaven when he ascends to Heaven his his beloved disciples began to think that he is walk out of the story are you with me are you following me this evening his disciples the people he had walked with and they've seen and they know that this is the Messiah now they were doubting and saying he's walk out of the story he's walk out of the story we thought that he was the Messiah we thought that he was the one to to set us free from this Roman captivity but he's walking of the story he's dead and some of them said you know what I'm going to go back fishing I'm going to go back to my old ways because it looks like he's just walked outad on my story it looks like he's just walked outad he came and he proved himself it looked like great and you know sometimes that's the way we get amen you have an experience with God and and it feels like God is in the it's in your story and and he's walking with you and you overcome and and you come to church and and every service feels like a Revival and and God is just blessing you moving in your life but all of a sudden a a trial hits and it feels like God has walk out of your story feels like he's walk out of your story and he's gone and here's the disciples I'm going back and fishing and Peter said you know I I'm done I I even denying him under trial here sometimes the young people we feel like we're denying them when the trial H we fail them when the trial h we didn't hold on the way we were supposed to hold on when the trial is and it feels like God has walk to the story but I tell you church he hasn't walked a to the story he hasn't walked a to the story because he told his disciple lesson you go open that room in Jerusalem and wait for me there because the story is not over the story is just about to begin because listen before it was only me on the scene but now it's not just going to be me Alone come on young people listen can you hear me this evening he said now it's not just going to be me doing the work but now I'm going to anoint you brother Brenham said what did he was he doing he was anointing some Messi Hallelujah he was saying de is not only going to be in heaven anymore but de is now going to step in a human flesh deity is now going to stop in a bunch of young people and let the here oh Hallelujah and he said go up the upper room amen and wait there and you know what happened over there you know the the pillow of fire came in there and it devoided itself before it was just one Pillar of Fire that led them all the way in the Old Testament but now that Pillar of Fire had devoided itself and set upon 120 people oh Hallelujah set upon 120 people saying now you have been anointed you have been anointed Amen to continue the work that looked like was finished amen it felt like he's walk out of your story but I'm saying to you he's anointed you to finish the story amen listen you are the finishers you are the last ones that are running this race are you with me young people you are the last ones that been called to finish this race there is no other age of coming this is the last age and you are the ones that have been called to finish the story not you finishing the story but the power of God the Holy Ghost the anointing and you to finish the work to defeat every enemy to break every chain that's what you've been called to do amen you are the ones that have been called to finish the story and in this last age amen listen D Through the Ages over and over again he was walking the story of that age and you know what he'll do he'll anoint a messenger amen with a message and what's the message is the ly so the messenger had a spoken word and he will speak that ly and it will Quicken the predestinated seeds of that age are you with me amen because brother Bram said at the end all those that were elected in the age are going to rise up amen so so it he'll come a Messenger will come with a message the ly and it'll Quicken amen are you with me it will Quicken the predestinated seed in that age amen and in this last age that same God has walked in this age you see listen we we we we can look at it from Revelation chapter 5 how he walked in then and and he took the book that was a close book but I'm not going to go there this evening because of time but I want to go to another place I want to go to the place where he walks into the story of this age let's go to Revelation chapter 10 let's go to Revelation chapter 10 Revelation chapter 10 1 to3 now this is our age every age the messenger had walk in with Lord now in this age he has to walk in again amen now what is God doing in all this he's restoring amen he's restoring man back to what he was in the original place in the Garden of Eden amen where he was in full control by the same spoken word amen so Revelation 10 it said and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as the pillar of fire brother Brandon who say who was that it was Jesus amen it was Jesus amen and it said and he had in his hand a little book open listen in Revelation chapter 5 when he walked in that story of redemption when he came he took the book it was closed but in this age he walks in the story of this age with an open book are you with me oh Hallelujah Glory with an open book and it said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the air what is he declaring full Authority amen he's declaring full Authority amen and it said and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roed and when he had cried seven tunders ordered their voices so what was it what was happening the same Jesus amen the same Jesus that came Amen in the form of Flesh amen and doed on the cross and came in the form of the Holy Ghost Amen in the Son of God Ministry brother Brandon will say amen and walk through it Through the Ages that same that same Jesus walks in this age to finish the story and you are the ones that are called to finish the story the mighty Angel Jesus Christ himself brother brandom said that son of mine comes back again the son of mine Ministry what is that is not anything to complicated it is the same work of Jesus when he was walking here as a m that is all is a b the son of Mind Ministry is Christ in you doing his work amen you know sometimes we take we hear these words and sounds like just great it's not you just have to get into the message young people it's not but he walks in the story in this age amen and just as the beginning the spirit of God begin to move amen the spirit of God began to move you remember the beginning as we read the spirit of God moved amen and when it moved he spoke is that and when he spoke the Lord it was made manifest so just as it was in the beginning in this last age the spirit of God began to move upon the seventh angel messenger I just want you to catch a picture of the message that you believe in amen because that that is where your victories at that's the reason why the enemy is trying all he can to keep the young people from these messages to keep young people from digging into the message because he's making it so complicated making you think that you can't get it and he's making church services to be so boring for young people because we sit there and feels like it's all a bunch of mystery that we don't understand but I want you to understand what this message has come to do it's come to anoint you but you are only going to receive the anointing if you get under the message in other words if you begin to feed on that word that is the only way you're going to receive the strength to overcome amen because it is Jesus that is Walking In Your Story with the message of this age to cause you to finish your race in Victory amen but Satan is trying to get you to think that this message is not for you but but I'm here to say to you this message is for you whether you a 13 year old whether you a 20 year old whatever age you are this message is for you and if you get into it amen and ask God for Revelation he will give you Revelation he will give you Revelation and he'll make the message so real to you that you can't stop feeding on it amen because when you get to that place where you can't stop feeding on the message that is when the devil don't know what to do with you you see what the enemy been trying to do he's keeping you from your very weapon that you need to defeat him but the word is here this evening to expose the enemy to encourage some young people to say listen I have come to walk in your story listen before you came your story was already written your story was already written amen but now you couldn't fulfill that story in your own self so God himself comes in you to finish your story and the way he steps in you to finish the story is boy the message of Mali 4 because that's the end message amen so in this last age just as the spirit of God moved at the beginning amen and as it moved the word went forth so had the spirit of God moved in the sage upon that seven Angel messenger and that seven Angel messenger what did he do he spoke thus sayth the Lord amen and when he spoke th sayth the Lord as we said at the beginning and what was it it was a Lo that came to Quicken The predestinated Siege that were lying in Le theia and you are those predestinated seed they are Laing here in Le the and the message came as the Loy to Quicken that seed in you it's the light that has come to make you alive Amen to make you live again amen because God knew that there are some predestinated seed heing L this year that are under the bondage of the enemy they under the bondage and the oppression of the enemy that has been lying to them by condemnation amen telling them that they've gone too far telling them that they've sent away the grace and he's condemning them day after day every mistake that they made the enemy is upon them telling them that they're not going to make it to the Rapture because of the mistake that they made yesterday but the message of God came in Hebrews and he said it is impossible it is impossible for the predestinated seed to be lost are you with me this evening that is what the message has come to do it has come to Quicken the seed on the inside of you to disbelieve the LA of the enemy amen he knew that there was some predestinated see lawy in here that has been bounded with depression that has been bounded in anxiety that has been bounded with lost that has been bound with many different afflictions and tens of Le to and so he sent the Lord forth to do what to break the bondage of the enemy to break the cycle of the enemy amen Satan has placed you in a circle over and over again you keep falling for the same T you over and over again you will sit in a church service and it feels like the word is just going over your head it feels that you're not receiving any tonight of the service what is it it is sa and distracting you over and over again but God has come in this Mee and to say I am here to to break that cycle or am here to get a hold of you or am here to put in you a desire amen or am here to put in you a hungering and a thirsting like you've never had before for this word of God but as you had at the beginning you're going to have to approach him with a pure heart you're going to have to approach him with an open heart to say Lord here I am come and fail me amen because he knows that the rapid Destiny knows the works of the enemy amen man he knows the works of the enemy that he's going to try to chain you he's going to try to bind you as a young person he's going to try to bring young people to a place but the feel that you're worthless and Satan will come you know the best solution is for you to take your life do you know how many young people sat is trying to to destroy the life with idal spirits but a message of K to break the spirit of the enemy the same Angel is come to say listen brother Brandon will say about that soldja boy and he say listen soldier boy he said listen soldja boy that's the lawy of the enemy he said don't you believe that he's going to drive you insane if you listen to that lawy of the enemy listen young people don't listen to that lawy of the enemy that is trying to tell you that you are worthless don't listen to that lawy of the enemy that is trying to tell you that this message is not for you don't listen to the Loy of the enemy amen because there's a greater force that has walk in the story amen there a greater force let us walk in the story amen he's walking the sky of the darkness the scy of the groom amen listen young person you don't have to sit and sin anymore are you with me you don't have to s in bondage anymore you don't have to sit in a cold formal formal Christian life anymore you don't have to be that anymore if you are Desiring it you don't have to be the young person that come to church just to fill in a seat in the church you don't have to be just a spectator anymore you can become a participator amen you can become a participator amen that's the reason he's walking in the story listen we are living in a season where the atmosphere is changing or in other words the atmosphere has already changed amen the atmosphere has already changed these seeds that have been lying there they have received the Lo amen listen when he came down in that seven days he came with an open book you hear me young people he came with an open book not many times you like I was an open book listen it wasn't a literal book that it came that was open Revelation is a book of symbols that book that he was talking about was you the book was you one time you were a closed book amen you are a closed book and some might be sitting here still being closed books because you haven't come to the full revelation of what God has called you to be be and you might be sitting here as a closed book but let me say this the spirit of God is moving amen just as he moved in the beginning what is he moving to do he's moving to let you come to realization that your book has been open amen that your book has been open amen the Mysteries that God had placed on the inside of you the seed that he had placed on the inside of you it has come to the season of maturity the Lord is already out shining upon that seed amen and all he's asking you to do is just open your heart amen move away the fear move away the doubt and allow God to command and you begin to see the supernatural begin to move in your life listen one time I was a closed book listen I was a closed book listen I was born in a message home my dad was a preacher before our before my elder brother was born he's been preaching a message for a long time when Dad is 7 to3 years old or 7 to4 years old and he's has been preaching a message for a very long time when I was born and raised in a message home but I was a close book amen I went to the world Amen I I joined in with rock and roll I played rock and roll and amen I did all sort of things in the world Amen but you see there came a moment amen you see I was writing my story amen and my story that I was writing I was going to be a rock star and and I I was going to play for the biggest band that ever was and that was my story that I was writing amen and I was convinced that that was a good story but it was a story of Darkness amen but one day listen young people but one day amen one day in a service listen it didn't take some incredible prayer loin but all it took was one song are you with me all it took was one song and God began to knock on the doors of my heart saying listen Max I am willing to come and rewrite your story amen listen young people there is a God here that is ready and willing to rewrite your story listen you have been writing your story you've been writing the story where the enemy has had you bound the enemy how you in a cycle but God is here to say I am here to rewrite that story to set you free to walk in your story to give you the victory oh Hallelujah when he walked in MO story he took a rock star and made him a preacher and you wouldn't this evening that is when God walks in your story he does the miraculous he brings the transforming power when he walks in your story that's what he's come to do in these meetings to walk in your story to transform your life amen listen you have been wrting and there are many parts of your life that have been marred with scares scares scares of T that you've seen scares of places that you weren't supposed to be and they haunting you amen scares of things you've done that you weren't supposed to do and you've repented of them but the enemy keep haunting you and haunting you and God is saying listen I am more unable to walk in that story and erase those cares are you with me this evening erase those cars listen one time it was a meeting in Louisiana amen some of you have seen the Louisiana Camp before there was a testimony amen there was a girl amen that came to those meens now she's been battling she so of spirits and you know she had gotten to a place where she begun to cour cut the pieces of her hands amen because she wanted to commit suicide you know and she came to the meens and God has set her free and you know during the moment of worship you know she wanted to Worship the Lord but but she was ashamed to raise her hand because if she Rose her hands people were going to see the scars that were on her hands and she was sced of people were going to judge her you know because you know she's been trying to commit suicide but you see the spirit of God was so moving on her heart amen that she said you know what I don't care what the people say I don't care what the people would do I'm going to raise up my hands in a way and when she rose up her hands but the time she brought her hands back down every car that was on their hands were removed listen that's what the power of God will do if God is more than able to remove the cars of suid naturally what is he able to do on the spiritual end when he walks in your story he's more than able to remove any scares rewrite it when mercy walks in it walks in to rewrite your story and mercy is walking in this evening to rewrite your story whatever your story has been all along he's here to rewrite your story again to say listen you may feel like your story was coming to an end but as you had in that poem don't be in a hurry to put to pend down the last page of your story because when you were thinking that you're Penning down the last page of your story that is when God is ready to pick up the pen again and begin to write listen one time they brought a woman to Jesus they brought a woman to Jesus and this woman was caught in adultery and these people people had stones in their hands and they were ready to Stone this woman because according to the law of Moses she had committed adultery and she deserved to die amen listen that was her story the people were ready to kill her but Jesus knil down and he she began to write he what was he doing he

feel like dead that has been your story for a long time service after service you sat in felt like dead you walk out with a smile on your face but in your heart it's a pain in your heart there a longing in your heart oh I wish it could be real to me like he is real to the pastor I wish he could be real to me like he is to the brother that sitting next to me but you walk out with a smile on your face you go out and joy with the young people but deep in your heart there a cry there a hungering there a thirsting or wonder realities of God I want to know the God of this message you you crying out like a laah said where is the god of Elijah where is he in my life I've had testimony of God transforming other people's life I've had testimony of God deliver people when is he going to walk in MO story when is he going to walk in my story and I've been going around and this every service just dead just that that's how jus felt that's how gyus felt but you know gyus deep in his heart he knew that there was a God that was more than able and no matter what how many cycles you've been going through no matter how many condemnation no matter the bondage that has been deep in your heart because of that seed in there you know that God is more than able you know that God is more more than able to fill you with that baptism of the Holy Ghost to where you can sit in the service and absorb it and walk out of the service and live exactly what was preached you know that God is real you know that he's a Healer you know that is a deliverer deep in your heart you know it but just like gyus you know he was bang he was stuck in a synagogue he was stuck with his reputation are you with me young people he was stuck with his reputation you know sometimes young people we Stu with a reputation we Stu with a reputation what is my reputation going to be if I go to school and I'm not kind of acting the way they are acting that was where gyrus was he was stuck with the synagogue that he was in how am I going to live the synagogue if we live the synagogue they're going to throw me out of the church and they're going to do all these sort of things to me and sometimes that's how we young people feel if I make a stand they're going to laugh at me and sometimes even among message Believers among message groups we can build our own reputation to where we even ashamed to raise our hands in service because if raise your hand the you the sister is going to think that I'm getting too religious if we sing too late it's going to feel like oh what's happening she's becoming like one of those and we begin to build this then even in the message among young people where we can't worship freely because of reputation we can't raise your hands and Worship the Lord because of reputation because we are as shame ashamed of what the people would think ashamed that they would think that I am too I am too religious I'm getting this message is becoming too real to me listen Church the world is not ashame to live in sin why do we have to be ashamed to live in the truth but Satan will put you in that cyle where you're ashamed with gyus but deep in his heart he knew that God is more than able he knew that that God is more than able to do to bring a change to do the miraculous in his life amen he knew that amen he knew that it was real to him and God knew the heart of jarus and you know God knows your heart you with me this evening God knows the desire in your heart of wanting to be a genuine True Believer amen he knows it amen but you've been trapped you've been trapped by reputation by synagogue by by different things you sit in the service and the enemy is condemning you so you can't raise your hand that's a trap but you know deep in your heart there is a hungering there was something pushing that was jarus and you know what God began to do God began to allow a certain situation to come into Gus's life certain situation to come into Gus's life where jarus was going to be backed up in a corner and he couldn't know what to do and you know sometimes you know what God would do you want to go ahead and watch things you don't want to you don't you're not supposed to watch you let you go until you backed up in the corner and you don't know what to do anymore he allow you to go ahead with those worldly Fashions until you backed up in the corner and you know that now I'm going too far now I'm about to step the boundaries he allowed it in jy's life but you know why he allowed it he allowed you to create an opportunity to walk in Gus's story and he might feel like you pressed in the corner this evening but listen he has allowed to create an opportunity so that he can walk in your story amen you may have gone so far in sin and you feel like there's no way of me coming back you may have sat in services and you feel like this is going to be what it's going to be for the rest of my life I'll be sitting in Services over and over again and I won't be getting anything out of the service and you backed up in your corner but deep in your heart you crying out to say God I need you God I want you I want you to be real in my life he's allowed him to create an opportunity to walk in your story this evening walk in your story this evening amen walk in your story this evening oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah listen it might look ugly it might look horrible but the darkness was just the opportunity for the light to show his power listen no matter what the darkness you're sitting in this evening is the opportunity for God to show his power

some group of young people have to come to a place where you make a clear quote decision to say I don't care anymore I am ready to go and make my way to Jesus amen because I have been in this bondage and I have been in a cycle for so long and it has done me no good and I've come to the point where I am ready jro said I am ready I don't care what they say about me my daughter is dying listen and you sitting on the church peill and you are dying you are dying and you know you are dying the world is getting a grip of you addiction is getting a grip of you and you know you were dying it's time to make a clear cut decision say I want to get to Jesus I want to get to Jesus amen I want to get to Jesus that's what jarus begin to say I don't care what they say I'm going to get to Jesus amen I'm going to get to Jesus and you know what God always works on both ANS of the line the while jyrus was going through his situation while he was backed up in the corner Jesus was away in another city but you know Jesus said I you do nothing except the Lord tells me so the god begin to move on on Jesus and say you need to go to the certain city you see God was working on both ends of the line listen God has been working on both ends of the line it wasn't you coming here it is God that brought you here youen you've come here because there's something that you desire more of God there is definitely something in your life that you are Desiring but God also has been working on the other end of the story amen and he's coming to meet with you now brother brandham will say when two omnipotents come together the supernatural takes place listen young person you have come here Desiring the supernatural God is here to perform the supernatural he is here to perform the supernatural hallelujah hallelujah and he began to walk in there there a young person Jarry said I'm not going to going to wait anymore I'm not going to wait I'm going right now listen young person don't you wait don't you wait don't wait for another service amen don't wait for another special meetings amen this is the opportunity this is your opportunity this is your time this is your season amen listen if you have a never been baptizm this is your turn to get baptizm as as as as Paul will say I beseech you by the mercies of God get baptized if God has toen on your heart and you haven't been baptized give your heart to the Lord amen give your heart to the Lord make a step towards him and he will run to you one time there was a prodigal son that just made a step he said I'm just going to return to my father's house to be a servant but as the father saw him coming the father began to R the father began to run listen he is running to you he is running to you this evening and he's not running to you to make you a servant he's running to you to put you back in your position as a Son of God put you back in your position as a daughter of God put you in your position as an overcome as a Victorious person listen to this quote brother B said the time is at hand there's no more time for waiting he says let's get to Jesus right quick they say well no brother brandom you don't you you don't have any education is that I may is that I might not have any un education but I know what I'm talking about I may not know the book too well but I know the writer the author real well I know the time is at hand we can't wait any longer let them that's filthy be filthy still and them that's holy be holy still the hour of your decision is now this may be the last noint that you'll ever have the opportunity you don't know men is God just take their chest out L jarus did said I don't care if you expel me if you excommunicate me oh he got some holy boldness in him that's what every put the need Stand For Your Right stand for your right as a young person the ball is in our court now what are we going to do amen what are we going to do are we going to just let Jesus go by listen I don't know you but I want to get to Jesus I want to get to Jesus I am glad for where he's brought me but I still want to get to Jesus because I believe that there is more for me I believe this is not the end of my story listen you might be walking Victorious you might be walking as an overcomer but this is not the end of your story amen this is not the end of your story you don't need to put a period there just put a comma because there is more coming amen there is more coming amen but listen as Jesus got into Gus's story Jesus got there and jarus has got there and they walk into this home and listen you sitting in the service and the word is ministering to you but listen as gyus as they were walking there something happened so Messengers brother br will call them The Messengers of Sorrow they run to gyus and said to gyus hey don't bother the master anymore don't bother the master anymore because your daughter is dead listen you said in the service the enemy come tell you listen you've been in a meeting before you've heard this kind of preaching before and you've gone back and fell in the same then you with me we preaching some people this evening you've gone back and you made the same mistakes and done the same things again what is it it's a messenger of Sorrow telling you don't don't you let listen ju ju just forget about you know what is going to happen and you're going to crush and Satan is going to come back and he's going to condemn you and you're gonna feel worse again so don't you even try that's what he came to tell gyus listen gyus forget be your daughter is dead and Jesus is you know the en will be here telling you listen you're too far gone but let me say this to you if you were too far gone you wouldn't be even sitting here the fact that you sitting here means that it's not over yet it means that the story is not over yet because if the story was over you'll be out of there p and doing whatever you want to do but because you're sitting here the story is not over yet so if that devil is coming to you telling you you've crossed the line and you've done this and you've done the order just tell them listen my story is just about to begin if I were you devil I will start backing out of that door because some f is coming on the inside of me I'm coming to a place where I'm coming to the realization of who I really am that the Lord is moving in the Ming to come to Quicken the seed that is on the inside of me I am here not to walk the same way that I've walked before but I'm here to walk a different walk listen one time it was Jacob that came in contact with God and wrestle with God and the scripture says that he didn't walk the same way anymore listen that same God is here this evening that same God is here this evening to change your walk you've been walking a s way you've been thinking a certain way but he's here to change your walk he's here to walk in your story amen and you know what Jesus said jarus listen I've come all the way I've come all the way just for this moment amen listen the Lord has been waiting he has been waiting just for this moment he knew that you will be here he knew the clothes that you'll be wearing he knew where you were sitting listen and before you walked in here he was already here 20 minutes before waiting for you just as the way when elaser was going to find a bride for Isaac brother brandham said that the angel of the Lord was there to to men prayor amen he has been here waiting for you he's been here expecting you amen he's been waiting for you to walk in your story Amen to walk in your story amen and say list and jarus don't be afraid but only believe only believe and you know what he said to jarus they got over to that home listen they got over to that home and the people were crying and the people were weeping and the people were just in sorrow Oh man listen in those days the the morning and the is pretty it's pretty bad you know these people literally come there and dressed in black and

B the situation you loing bad anoint You Weep it when is it going to be my turn when is it going to be my my my season when is these things going to change in my life and maybe you the one that has been doing the Weeping but you know when Jesus walked in there and he said told them listen the child is not dead listen your situation your circumstance it's not dead you are looking at the picture the wrong way listen that was the time that the cloud show up and everyone was looking at the wrong way but Jesus walked in the story and told the prophet T it right and the picture was different listen you've been looking at the picture the wrong way and that same Jesus is walking the story of the evening and say it turn it right turn it right for a long time you've been weeping but he's come and you know what he did when he walked in there he cast them o late all the unbelief listen it's time to push everything aside this evening whatever has been has been you can't change it whatever you've done is done we can't go back in the past and he said everyone get out it's time to lay down the doubt it's time to lay down the past amen young people it's time to lay down all the condemnation that has been haunting you it's time to lay everything down because Jesus has walked in the story and he said get everyone e and you know what he walked in with he walked in with Peter James and John and brother brand would say what was it fed what's next and that's what he's walking in this evening into your life he's walking well with fith he's walking in with hope and he's
