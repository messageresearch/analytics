TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] Oh [Music] and I'm so amazed how God is such a great blessing [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] mrs. believers there so that I sent to the brown yesterday I believe everything that we are [Music] and there is a specific [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so we are working in this light so I just thought to share with you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in Reverse if the spirit of Jesus from the dead in Christ [Music] [Music] that is leading our hearts and that we can walk by the food to our DBS power the spiritualism that are quickly enough that we can the won't come in the flesh but in the spirit may you break the bread this 21st hunger and make yourself visible for our spiritual eyes [Music] [Music] [Music] there are some beach house there are somebody that also broke my home row by inheritance my chuckles ropes my relationship with God and this rubber is [Music] actually actually it was just a regular rubber it was a regular Road he always go against the wall and that was the law so he used Falco [Music] and this robbery is very smart and he loves thousand years [Music] and he's been studying very hard trying to understand there was one thing that they must go back with and that was the law of the spirit of this and the law of sin didn't have any power so Jesus heroes by that the law the law of the spirit of life well through the years I've been reading those verses yes when you can take something from the Bible [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and that's the law of the spirit of life in Christ I think it was somewhat radical Brenham he explained what happened when Jesus [Music] [Music] he said and he was to the door I'm sure I have when I true Daniel into the mines there we have a job I told I have well when you you're right you have to tear and she's over the people I come down I am the words worn top of the smart [Music] [Music] yes I take our [Music] granted by tonight and truly valid participatory reach over and grab the keys and said even few people get back in very long I'm the boss now my blood has been shed up there across for the remission of sins and for sickness and you can't keep them there any longer even there will be people who will believe me you can find them up with sickness you can find up with fear they will believe [Music] [Music] well and from the revenue speaks of this and how goes away from the and that's what [Music] all we see how people are crazy we see how interacting see all things going on and we know that this is manifestation [Music] [Music] [Music] we also they're all things that are spiritually must be manifested so that's the reason you know we are you today we are because we were a factor also [Music] [Music] so but you see God Oh camel trail they go God's more cannot fail and there was a team placed there in unity and the seagulls later and all emphasis on change because God has a long and that's the goal of the spirit of life in Jesus mark so you see one day you was a sinner but you didn't know that you were cleaning your natural life by your own eyes and it was well so I think this is such a wonderful thing when spring is coming when the ice is melting away and were so amazed [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it's like a suit [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and when you see that the holder is locking up for the manifestation of and we are living right in that moment where things are taking place up so this is a wonderful time references its regards [Music] and he speaks about how bright and how this pride was destroyed and speaks about this new horn came around and took up the fruits and it says the first thing the first fruits he took was and he says that's one of the things that keeps the church practice and then he speaks about all the other things my cloud lot suffering illness pinkness faith patience and the light spiritual spiritual gifts so when the first thing that was destroyed we have faith that we can let this happen and this is a supernatural thing this is nothing we can do by our own efforts [Music] and he will restore it back you see we are actually they are being transformed through justification sanctification baptism in the Holy Ghost and then we have the place and all those things have to take place [Music] we are so actually we feel that the law is against the law and is working to serve and though I said always goal for this purpose Oh actually and spiritually and they are working according to the random self that God said all these walls into mush that must work according to his over and they all told right in life and all the dogs work in handy because and the local life that's in us would also bring us to address it's impossible for it regardless of how they are how how how how sick we are how we are spirit is work [Music] and there is a law that forces and in second coordinates we do if this earth be dissolved he says see we have to come straight from the afternoon we are [Music] [Music] [Music] well [Music] and labor control and when people are controlled by things and that way we can see all those positions [Music] you have this already [Music] [Music] [Music] and if you remember when those hundred and twenty believers they made was they made assignment before God and they were actually they were sacrificing themselves and putting aside everything [Music] everything in every opinion every thought every every claim they just want come into one spirit [Music] [Music] [Music] and they were [Music] and you know every instrument is for us
