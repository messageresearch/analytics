TRANSCRIPT
========================================
thank you Father we pray for those who may be um on their way that we pray you'll protect them Lord Jesus and overshadow the entire church with the grace of God bless us tonight father as we gather together in your name and bring us to the shape you'd like the church to be in we ask it in Jesus name amen praise the Lord God bless you real good the same scripture ABAC 220 and I know it by heart the Lord is in his holy Temple let all the Earth keep silent before him praise the lord it's right over the door as you're coming in right did you notice that it's right over the door and you're coming in and that's not to new only to this church even in the old church we had that sign there uh like that that we should come in the house of God with great re the Lord bless you please bece it we have uh been talking on this subject how to behave in the house of the Lord or our behavior in the house of God which would seem uh Elementary um to those of us who have been in a message for some time but uh like I mentioned in child training or even God training his church uh you'll find it in Deuteronomy numbers Exodus he keeps telling Moses and all the prophets he says repeat them in the ears of your children and your children's children right and you know the scripture we read out in the Book of Psalms in your rising up in your sitting down in your walking remember amen so this is what we are supposed to do so that we will be able to internalize uh what God wants to establish within our hearts until the word becomes an anchor amen right the word becomes an anchor I've gone past talking about just becoming a habit G right it's anchored in your soul becomes a part of you and that's when you really start to live Christianity because you don't have to think about it amen right in the early stages of of Christianity or even coming into the message you have to always remember this rule that rule remember the prophet said this remember over there remember that you always had to do that I had to do that but uh when the message gets a hold of you and the life of Christ begins to project because of your love for God God has already proven his love for us but then we prove our love to him as our love for him becomes really strong and we we begin to walk with him in the word obey BR our husband the word then what happens The Life of Christ begins to project amen IT projects and IT projects without you having to think about it you don't have to walk around with a thought that's that's the realm of dramatic Christianity where it's all of drama uh because you heard the prophet said this because you read over here and said that or the prophet did this or the prophet did that and uh when we were children you you a your parents you copy off of them you do all of that Paul puts it this way when we were a child we we we SP like a child we act like a child we do everything like a child but when we become a man it means mature when we become when we become mature we put away childish things that's right right because you know every teenager uh uh goes into a state of identity crisis right and and and during that period of time you know they have a lot of struggles um and in that period of time they they tend sometimes to be emotionally unbalanced why they're trying to find themselves they're trying to find their personality and their path and while they're doing that they're unsure it's like like if I give you a picture it's like a h if you seen a horse or an animal give birth and a cult stands up and when he stands up or she stands up at first they're kind of shaky you know like that uh and and they try to walk and they're Shakey about it why because they're unsure what life holds they're unsure what they should do and everything else but because there the nature of a horse the nature of that particular animal it walks right into the nature it doesn't have to go practice right it it just walks into it it's the same thing if the life of Christ is in you then it will begin to act like Christ that's right see if a lot of your self is in there or a mixture of yourself Christ will project and then a a little bit of yourself will come out right praise God and it's still does in every one of us and me too because you know you say something you're like wait a minute I didn't mean that I didn't want to be that way it just came out and and you realize that you we all have that brother that sticky thing is going to be with you till you go going Rapture yes but the thing God requires of us is that we keep pressing on to Perfection not that you don't have it in here but for perfect manifestation of that life that came into you right we want to have such a perfect manifestation until they say my goodness she is just like Christ he is just like Christ why because you are now identified with Christ and Christ is identifying himself that yes I'm living in this house amen he's in the house and he's living there and so therefore he makes himself manifested so we're talking about how our how we physically I just mentioned about spiritually behaving in the house of God how how is your soul your spirit manifesting through this body this house that God gave you whether you like it or you don't like it this is the house God Gave You amen praise God and your soul has got to manifest through this house God gave you and and and then uh it has to have a certain Behavior right we got to behave right through this body and not misuse it and not destroy it and everything else you you can run that through your mind and I'm then I'm bringing it back now to the house of God Amen just like when in the Bible uh he was in the house and the Bible said when he was in the house and they knew he was in the house the people gathered onto him they gathered to him onto the house until he was in space praise God and you know the story of the breaking up the roof to let the man in but there we we get we have a little picture of what I'm really talking about of how we should behave in the house of God coming to the house of God is not just a uh that's what makes us different it's not just another church we're walking in here with a revelation that's right we're walking in here knowing that there is a is the great all powerful being of Jehovah God in this place waiting on us so that when we come in here praise God that's why brother Ben said don't worry let it's 2 3 4 10 10 god with one man sincere enough is a majority one person Hallelujah set this place of fire why because it's God hallelujah and so when we come together like this in Humble meetings like this you know the greatest things can happen sometimes I've seen them in the simplest meetings and you have great meetings great preaches great this great that uh uh I'm just thinking of uh back in the old country there praying looking seeking God believing God trusting the Lord and uh great Minister came in to have a miracle through saying and uh he's going to pray for the sick and the cripples and and and everything else are going to walk and the blind are going to see and the death are going to hear and everything else and they Place advertisements and then uh as young people what we did when Minister was coming in we would get the b f sprinted up and then we would go down all the streets around that town and hand them out and verbally invite the people uh if they wer home we leave it you know things have changed we know that they call that Ling now right and uh they might even want to have by laws in in the city I Believe In This Very City they have bylaws against you just walking around and sharing stuff stuff like that but back then we could but here's a great Minister coming in and we would be sharing out these flyers and we say oh you should come to the meeting tonight well you know I can't I can't come because uh my leg is all um crippled up and I've been sitting here for the past couple of years and so I'm sorry you know I won't be there he said well well all of you should come and and he said well uh sister why don't you allow us to pray for you said okay go ahead and pray and we would pray for the person I can remember one case clearly the woman couldn't move her arm it was all cred up like that and she could not pick up a cup or do anything so he said all right we prayed for her and he says raise up your hand and that hand that she couldn't raise for many many years she raised it up like that to the end of it she was was able to pick up uh we had this great big um steel pots heavy um forg pots and she picked one up in her arm and they started shouting and screaming and then we turned around in our gopel innocence and saying that's what we're talking to you you talking about come to the meeting and you're going to see things like this going on and we are not even thinking that it's already happening while we are sharing the track you see and the main thing about it is that of course you know it's wonderful we went to the meeting but we didn't see we were disappointed because we didn't see those kinds of things happening in the meeting with this great International evangelist so we were kind of disappointed but the fact is brother and sister when we come together we should realize that in this God always hides in Simplicity amen and sometimes I found that some of the the greatest messages are preached when um it's just a simple service and there's just a few people they don't expect anything particular and then all of a sudden God comes on the scene all of a sudden something happens praise the Lord so now let's not walk by sight let's walk by faith is that right God didn't ask the prophet says it this way he said he didn't ask you did you feel it he asked you did you believe it that's right pray God but you know some people come to church they got to feel something I service they got to feel something I can feel anything you know but it's not if you felt something it's if you believe something amen that's right when I say believe did you get a revelation of something even if it's one thing praise God to be blessed even if it's one thing because the whole Church of God is built by what he said it's by uh precept upon precept precept it's like word on top of word on top of word just like your body is built up by cells word on top of word like you told Joshua I'm not going to deliver you all in one day or one year I could do it but I won't do it unless you think you did it all by yourself but little by little you out and it's the same way God deals with us is little by little he's opening our eyes and is strengthening us so when we first come to Christianity we are like those children spoken up and and uh we're trying to walk we can't find our way then after a while if you watch that little cold the next day you come back 2 days later and the thing is running it's running as normal as ever and caring on why because it's it's starting to find its way the nature that's in it to go and that's the kind of Christianity I always uh believe in and and and talk about not the one that you have to literally practice the one that you have to you know but this is one where you're growing into this life you're growing into this life inak over praise the Lord inight you he leads you he he takes you where you're supposed to be amen and and and every day that's the way I believe and that's the where I live that I meet who I am supposed to meet amen is that right I meet who I'm supposed to meet it's not even who I think I should meet maybe I have a I have an appointment and he doesn't want me to make it I don't make it right praise the Lord I don't mean I deliberately don't go or or decide I'm not going but if he doesn't want me to go he'll not let me go and until you get to the place where you understand that God is sovereing over our lives not only over the world but over our lives amen even over your thinking that's right amen praise the Lord you can be wanting to think this in your mind drift off and God thinking something else because God wants something else out of you and until we get to the point where we can surrender to the Holy Spirit and let him have his way and and lead us in his divine order in his divine order in the house of God praise the Lord so um so here we are we touched on the fact that God has given us this wonderful uh building and we've consecrated it and dedicated it to his glory but uh the prophet is expressing God's desire he he doesn't want just a tabernacle like the Jews had in the wilderness but he wanted like Jesus said or in the spirit of Prophecy Samuel said in the Book of Proverbs I think it is but a body has now prepared me right uh what house I'm going to dwell in dwell in the physical building no it's not the physical building even though that the pillar of fire came there he said the glory the glory of the locker house will be greater than that of the former amen cuz that one was wood and gold and and skins but it's us it's human beings we at the last the house that God is living in praise God and so he has prepared us for this hour for this season and for this time amen and we must understand our uniqueness right that we are not here by chance we are not even here by uh our own will alone that's right because your will have to coincide with his will like a man wanted to marry a woman but she has to agree to marry him amen it's the same way our our taking Jesus as our savior is just accepting the choice that he had already made is that right praise the Lord that's all it is so here it is that we are walking in an invisible Union with him praise God hallelujah just about there he's talking about the marriage of a young woman and the young man standing in my office it's like the type of bride getting ready for the ceremony of that day but I carried out here as a loyal minister to Christ as a loyal minister to Christ amen he is bringing getting the bright ready praise God and that's what I'm trying to do by uh bringing this uh kinds of messages to you you say but what is that it's just like when the bride is still uh waiting to come out and she has a maid of honor what does the man of Honor do or let's use the word supposed to do she's supposed to pay attention to every fine detail right not say oh she's dressed already oh she's a Christian oh oh she's already got on the Revelation she's got the wedding dress no that made hna have to watch an even more Finly each detail check that her hair is in place check that her her dress doesn't have any SMUD on it it it doesn't have a rip a tear or or in the front a tread or something is sticking out or whatever doesn't matter to you it is insignificant to you it might be infinite decimal but the fact is that that's the details that uh that made has to come down to and that's the way the preacher has to come down because we're coming to the end of the road hallelujah it's Rapture time it's harest time it's going God is coming Jesus is coming Hallelujah the king the prophet the priest is coming the all and all is coming the person everything is coming a great and Solomon is here praise God hallelujah so that's the reason why that my attention was drawn to touching on our behavior in the Church of the Living God hallelujah knowing how to walk down the aisle knowing what position to take how to be in the right right spot in the right time all that type of thing and so we touch first of all on our our behavior in the auditorium which means the sanctuary here uh praise God brother Bram talked to us told us about it not buying not selling coming in as a consecrated place not a place for murmuring and talking but a place where we worship God Amen dedicate yourselves he talks about entering the sanctuary and keep still is that right keep still when you come into the sanctuary he said when you enter them doors you keep quiet for the sanctuary is dedicated to washer stand outside talk anything you want and as long as you want but when you enter these doors keep quiet listen to him and wait on him praise the Lord you believe that praise God hallelujah amen and now he also spoke about the role of the ushers whether those ushers are made up of deacons trustees or any other brothers that have been appointed to do that he spoke about their role is to you know stand there and see that the children and the people in the congregation go go talking and and interrupting others as he says would want to pray silently in the house of the Lord then he begins to give us a a kind of a template of the order of wash how that the uh atmosphere in the sanctuary ought to be quiet how that like 15 minutes to half an hour before the actual worship starts the uh tape guys or tape uh girls or taping team or media team should be playing soft music soft devotional music music has power to calm the troubled breast so says Shakespeare and the Bible tells us also that uh music according to the Bible can even control Devils that's right amen music Control even our emotions take away depression you know when Saul was depressed and suicidal David played on the heart amen when uh Elijah wanted to get in the spirit he told the young man play on the heart play some music and once he went right into the spirit so music has a powerful effect amen and the use of it in the house of God has a powerful effect that's right that is the reason why in war we find that the tribe of Judah went before you would think they would send the armed men with the sword the pastor will come first with the sword no they sent the mus musicians out first and even in every Army you hear the music coming first and then comes the troops coming behind why because when they hear that music it gives the it that martial music puts that martial attitude into that I don't know if you ever heard it but as a boy I wanted to be a soldier when you heard that music oh my God you want to run behind them and you know follow them and you want to March like them and you want to become a soldier because you hear that drum going [Music] my goodness your chest go your chest if you think you're a general yourself but that's the fact oh Onward Christian Soldiers Maring us to walk to God hallelujah but there it is music has a very important place when the music soft it sets a certain mood and then there's the need of the loud music amen at another time there's a need sometimes for slow music that you will literally disrupt the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit if you were to go play uh fast music and there you can't be taught that you have to be able to sense the Holy Spirit and what it is that he wants at any one particular time there's no course on that that somebody can give you a course on being a worship leader to teach you how to s the Holy Ghost which way the wind is blowing and you follow the wind of God while it is blowing and that is why some people get misunder understand the prophet when he says don't play that bogie bie music in church don't don't you do that they think that you you must not have any music that have any kind of a beat with it you know that's not what he meant he means don't bring rock and roll right don't bring all that kind of music that's out in the world and bring it in the church don't do the talk cuz I know for a fact you I think it's in one of the books but I think it's in the prophet V South Africa brother Brandon was there uh in his Jeep they were going H going to hunt or no they were going to visit some um type of um Nature Reserve preserve and on their way with brother Jackson uh they were passing by and and the prophet said stop stop listen why there was a group of uh natives just in a circle and they had a fire going and they had the drums going and they had you know they have a instrument made out of a hollow tree trunk and they hit it with a size wood like this and it gives off a a a a beautiful sound uh like a drum the s coming out to the two ends of this hollow Uh Wood and uh they were dancing dancing around that that fire and dancing around that fire and brother got out and said why do you want to go there you know he says oh I feel lad and he just went there next thing you know he was dancing with them here was this white man in the middle of nowhere dancing among these natives just like he was a native himself amen praise God and he had himself a good time and when he came back can you imagine just visualiz brother B jumping because those guys don't just stand up and sway like this when you go to Africa you got to move I mean let me tell you the the Presbyterian Church brother coffe you right the Presbyterian Church there behaves even more than some of these so-call Pentecostal churches here true amen I'm not kidding they are full of the life and they just they come serious to have church they're not playing around they come to have church in the house of God so brother have to be jumping pretty high and making some boov that he never made before because he was on the inspiration the holy spirit that if some of us saw him we would think that he's beside himself is that right but the fact is when he came back even the brothers wanted to criticize him and said brother BR why did you go there why were you acting like that he says oh no he said the Holy Spirit Led me there you see they're going to help lions and some of them don't know if they're going to die so are the Lions going to get them and therefore they were praying to their God and their God they're praying to is the same one God this God Mo they call him the wind but it's the same God but they don't know his name yet right somebody has to go and tell them their name his name let them know that that God talking about is Jesus Christ amen but got in the spirit but that is a power of music and worship praise the Lord so one time it can be soft next time it's loud one time it's slow next time it's fast and praise God it takes all of it amen praise God just read the book of Psalms you're going to hear David talking about singing and singing devotionally with the sons of Esa and then you go another place he said Shout with L boys with the Timber on the har and so on like that oh my praise the Lord Shout to the Lord for the Lord high is mighty amen he break the seed in Lebanon Glory God hallelujah so some of the Brethren that only love to have nice soft music only that's good but that's not the whole thing I I don't but I tell you you they're going to have a lot of problems to even being Heaven Heavens is going to be a noisy Place CU I think the Bible tells us that that all everybody in heaven and on earth going to be shouting and hallelujah praise God and their voice is going to be heavier than NRA brother brother uh uh daddy uh were you having a problem sleeping that first night uh with hearing the sound of the falls all night amen praise God you know that's just being in a new place but I'm telling you some of them going to have a hard time when they hear everybody in heaven Earth screaming hosana hosana Hallelujah unto him that SED upon the throne hallelujah praise God forever more amen but then there'll be another time when you come in the service and you're waiting on the Lord and uh you think oh praise the Lord if uh oh my God if the brothers really play the music God is going to speak to us and nothing happens until you get like Elijah where he got a spirit a real Spirit of worship and sacredness in the presence of God and then in that silence it's when he heard a still Small Voice sometimes even in the prayer meeting sometimes we need to get so quiet until you can hear him using the voice of your consecrated Spirit which is better known as using your conscience on the inside that's the rooster that God used to cow to Peter it's not the one that was outside of him it's the one that was inside him and sometime God needs to speak to us from the inside with a still Small Voice praise the Lord yeah and so um he talks about that and how the music should be played and then after that the song leader should come up then the pastor comes on the scene and um then the behavior of mothers with their children and how they should be able to take care of them he mentions about the behavior of young people teenagers passing notes going outside in the dark parking lot sitting in the car and caring on while they should be in the house of the Lord he talks about that in that way praise the Lord amen so we are fully aware that then he goes on to talk about when the service ends talks about when it begins the kind of music should play Atmosphere we should create uh the song leader the pastor comes up brings the word the service comes to an end and when it end the children should not be permitted to run all over the sanctuary and the adults just standing there Hing at their kids across the room screaming back and forth and things like that praise God then he goes on to talk about it that if you do these things spiritual gifts will Begin to Fall among you amen and when they begin to come among you you then there's going to be have to have order even with those gifts praise the Lord that that's another topic uh for another time praise the Lord hallelujah he talks about the place the part of the pastor and the deacons amen and stuff then he can Ends by saying love is always corrective genuine love is corrected see the world has a twisted sense that genuine love are they love is only comforting and love is always compassionate and it's true but that's not all love does it's it's the same personality that Jesus has is both uh tender but then he was tough when he had to Flat a rope and dve those phes out right he he's comforting but he's also corrective that's right he's a he can cool like a dove into his soul and the next moment he roar like a lion or descend on you like a screaming eagle because that's the way his personality is one moment he's the Prince of Peace but then when you break his word he becomes the judge right with the white be yes praise the Lord so love is corrective not only comforting but corrective praise the Lord and that's why of people that trying to raise their kids only by psychology where they tell them all you have to do is just talk to the kid and just make sure you don't raise your voice to a certain extent because you're going to damage them psychologically if you say sit down oh they going to get Spear and they going to you know go off and this and that whatever see but God didn't say that in his word praise God he taught us different love is always corrective praise God you kids you ought to know different adults you need to know different that's the way it is Jesus loved but yet when they were buying and selling he planted ropes and ran them people right out of the auditorium praise God hallelujah kind of a Preacher is that running people out the church my God what kind of a heart is that amen but you see you got a A preacher a real genuine let me not say preacher that's a general term a a genuine Shepherd has to guard his Sheep amen I have to protect you spiritually speaking is that right and if I saw uh somebody walked in here or another sheep walking here um having uh foot and mouth disease right tend to want to run all over the place and then tend to left the chatter talk and stuff like that and and want to put down a a virus of some kind then I have to stop it amen praise the Lord I have to stop it praise the Lord glory to God so that's where it is and sometimes you would not know if the pastor speaks sharp to somebody and you hear it you say oh my God that man don't have love but you don't know what the real back is praise the Lord you see that's why you got to have confidence you have to have confidence just like many years ago when a certain preacher came up not to this platform here but in one of the other the places we were worshiping him stepped on the platform and um I just invited him in because Breen said that he was a good brother and they knew him I didn't know him and uh you know they you know I said okay I'll go along with it let him come along but while he's talking talking all of a sudden I know he's a homosexual right he didn't have the outward Behavior if you think it's by sight it wasn't by sight cuz you didn't have no outward Behavior this was a preacher in this message and so later on I had to you know um deal with it and so um some of them were saying oh brother you can't tell that man this you can't say that but where's your proof I don't need any proof I don't need physical proof I know and if you have confidence you are to have enough confidence even if you had a thought brother br not sure you just shut up don't say nothing let the thing play out then you're going to know whether it was God or it's not God so so when I spoke to JY and he he say well how dare you say this and that other I said well if you if what I'm saying is not true you have the opportunity to embarrass me right now yeah you have to embar to expose me right now that what I'm saying is false why don't you do it no you wouldn't do it definitely would do it because he knows different and praise the Lord and and later on of course the police C him and he was in jail and stuff like that but the fact is you got to have confidence listen and I'm going to wind this down now brother Brandon conord Doctrine in respect to the order of the church we have tried to go according to what we understand the orders given at the dedication of the church praise the Lord and by doing so some of the people have gotten mad at us and even left the church and others still in the church will not listen to anything we say and especially about their children we have talked to the parents about their children and they W take care of them now brother BR have we misunderstood you are we going about it in a wrong way thank you now brothering Hallelujah in respect to the order of the church we have tried according to the way we understand that is correct you are doing what is right this is supposed to be done by the deacons I suppose for that's the Deacon's job amen now you say people have often gotten mad at us Brothers they get mad at me [Music] too I'm sure they were mad at him with some of those messages he used to preach now we take it ordinary and simple but you you can imagine in those days when he was preaching those messages my goodness they said sometimes he'd walk into a church and by the time he stepped to the pulpit half the congregation run out the back door but on they when they hear the neighb of the preacher random and they know some of the doctrines he preach out the door they run right like that so you can imagine so now here it is a person that does that there is something wrong with that person that's right that person is not right with God for the spirit of Christ is subject to the teaching of Christ or Christ teaching in Christ's house and by Christ's order and any man or woman or any persons or children that would get angry with a Godly Deacon or any parent that would get angry with a deacon really we want everybody in this church that we can get but if that person would only cause trouble somewhere else there's a thorn or a rabbit in the wood pile and that person isn't right that's right amen and if they leave there's only one thing to do let them leave let them go and pray for them praise the Lord what he's talking about here after the deacons and the pastor with every possible effort and that person still will not obey the dictates of the Bible and the church then the prophet said let them go praise the Lord amen you don't want anybody to go but if somebody's going to come in here and start to create any problem then we have to settle it sorry um another preacher visited the church one time and visiting the church and praise the Lord and you know how I sometimes step out there and I'm shaking hands and while I'm shaking hands all of a sudden I just felt myself pulled and there's a preacher talking to a Believer and that believer is still in the church not here tonight but still in the church still a member of the church and um I just felt to walk over so I walked over and I said to the to the believer of this church I said um so what are you all talking about and the preacher just said well I'll be just talking about the Lord I said I'm not speaking to you sorry brother but I'm not speaking to you I'm speaking to this sheep of mine and said well brother you know uh he was just telling me that there's a need for a lot of Bibles in this country certain country and that there $20 of peace and you know if I could make a donation for 200 of those Bibles 200 Bibles 20,000 piece and yet when I walked up he said it's not we just talking about the Lord so I just turned around and said you're a liar and here you are you know trying to do this with this innocent person and you have them under pressure and I just walked out without knowing anything but the Holy Spirit made me walk out here to take this person out of this the clutches right so then I just call the deacons and said this pre is not to come back here if you see him tell him to leave don't even let him on the property he's not even honest enough and not even sorry enough to repent right there and there trying to hold out so I'm saying that sometimes you might even misunderstand me right um it's gotten to um another time where in the middle of preaching we have to ask the preacher to step down some some people got annoyed they didn't understand but it's because I have to deal not just with looking at faces but I'm dealing with spirits and there spiritual warfare going on all the time not you're just used to the regular thing that's one thing but it's another thing when somebody uh tries to or at least operates a little bit with the Holy Spirit on them it's a different matter Al together so you got to have some confidence so that these things can work in the church they can't work in the church unless U you have confidence like the angel said to brother if you can get the people to believe you amen amen praise the Lord a man gets into the word and then you start having confidence that there's something operating around there it's not the man but you sense there's something working there and whatever that is I believe it's God then you want to tap into that and allow the Holy Spirit the liberty and the freedom to move and to operate praise the Lord so any person that will get mad praise the Lord hallelujah oh my glory to God get angry then if they leave there's only one thing to do let them leave let them go and continue to pray for them praise the Lord you don't just let them go but you continue to pray for them that somewhere along the line God will change their thoughts God will reveal to them and turn their hearts back from their backslid condition amen praise the Lord and some of you deacons after a while may even want to go to their house sometime and find out why really they left and ask them what was wrong because you know sometimes somebody argue with the Deacon over some little frous thing but that that might not be the real problem it may be just the front for an excuse to leave because they are burdened with some other problem inside of the church that they didn't want to talk about and so sometimes it's necessary for the deacons to go and meet the person in the privacy of their own home and there maybe they want they'll open up and say you know this brother this and that the other I I don't go there anymore because of this sister didn't me that or this one say that or whatever uh and then real problem comes to the surface why sometimes they were acting up mad at the Deacon really we want everybody in this church that we can get amen find out why they left see if we can reconcile and then if they can't then go back taking two or three Witnesses with you uh that they might be understood then if they can't be understood and stole before the church after then they are not a member here of the church anymore praise the Lord see you take two or three Witnesses because as spiritual as you might be as literate as you might be listening to that person as one man even a deacon listening to them it's possibly you can miss something possibly you can miss a sign you miss a discernment missp picking up on the person's Spirit or they cry for help or something else and so bringing a witness or another witness the second time they may be able to pick up on something that you miss because when two walk together it's stronger than one right and that way they are able to see things from a different perspective we are human beings and sometimes we locked in uh um on a certain person and we see them in one light and then it's hard sometimes for you to change that image right hard to change that image and sometimes it takes another person completely unaware and unconnected to step in and look with a clear innocent imp partial View and then say Oh what about this what about that oh my goodness I I didn't see that I didn't think about that praise God so God has a system set up where it will go from one to two or three Witnesses and then if they continue uh then you bring it to the church and make it um uh make it public in other words you're shielding and protecting them so that they can reconcile rather than spreading it through the whole church and making the person ashamed or embarrassed to come back to church M right so that's what we have to do in every possible way praise the Lord h
