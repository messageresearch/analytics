TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the house of the Lord that we're going to read this morning from The Book of Psalms chapter 8. it says O Lord our Lord how excellent is thy name in all the Earth who has set thy Glory above the heavens out of the mouth of babes and sucklings has thou ordained be because of thine enemies that thou might is still the enemy and the Avenger when I consider thy Heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou has ordained what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visiteth him for thou has made him a little lower than the angels and has crowned him with Glory and Honor Thou made us hymn to have dominion over the works of thine hands thou has put all things under his feet all sheep and oxen yea and the beasts of the field the fowl of the air the

praise God welcome to everyone here today and once again we've come into the presence of God and trusting that the Lord will bless you uh in every possible way amen pray for me while I'm here standing and ministering and may the Holy Spirit also bless you praise the Lord God bless every one of you uh let's look to the word of God and we'll look to Matthew chapter one I believe versus Verse 18 reading from Verse 18 Matthew chapter 1 reading from Verse 18 to 21. just before me read let us pray our gracious father before us lays the open book we ask that the great holy spirit will come and minister to us from the word of God feeding us the bread of life bless us Quicken us wake us up stir our hearts Grant o God will experience the pull and may you receive all the glory and the praise what a supernatural Time Lord what a great day we are living in May you father come on the scene take and interpret your own word that we might go and be what you want us to be in our rightful position for the age till you be the glory the honor and the praise in Jesus name amen and amen praise God Matthew 1 18. now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband just man and not willing to make to make her a public example was minded to put her away privily or privately but while he talked on those things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost that is what we are taking for a subject conceived by the Holy Ghost and may the Holy Spirit bless us all together please be seated amen now of course uh conceived by the Holy Ghost one would think that um you know that's when Jesus really began but Jesus Christ didn't begin there you see the body whom we call our no as Jesus the lamb he began right there in the terms of being conceived but we will go into this as we talk about it and to do that I must go back on what some of what I have previously taught on last year and some of it will come back to you while I'm continuing to speak here today by the grace of God now we understand therefore that um the body was just a human body that God created and used Mary to bring it on the scene but the the person of God himself was the one that indwelt that Temple for God was in Christ the Bible tells us that the Bible tells us the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and other scriptures but it's showing you there that he was both human but at the same time he was all God a theologian would say he was very God and that's you know all that sort of talk but he was all God completely God and completely man amen now praise God now in the Bible Genesis 1 the Bible tells us that God created Adam and when he created him he breathed the bread of life in him and he became a living soul now we know that when God said he became a living soul that did not mean that when God breathed in him at that time that it was eternal life that God breeded into him at that time right see because Adam was really already eternal but now this shape or form that was made you see um that shape or form that had to have natural life so when God breeded that was not uh eternal life because Adam was already eternal so this was just natural Life coming to him now if you can think ahead of me you will see when Jesus breathed on them Iran said receiving the Holy Ghost that's not when they actually received the Holy Ghost they received the promise there they got it under their Pentecost but we are not talking about that right now right so we find out as we've spoken before uh Genesis 1 God created one man in his own image and in his likeness is that right okay so God's image God being a spirit and he made it making that man in His image it was a spirit man that God made in his own image right okay so here's the spirit man but then later on he says and there was no man to till the soil there was no man to keep the garden there was nobody to take care of anything and then Genesis 2 I think it's verse 7 where he says and then God formed man of the Dust of the Earth and when he formed this man of the Dust of the Earth then the spirit man now had a house or there was now a body that the spirit man could inhabit now that body body had Natural Life but the spirit man could now manifest through that body and he could Now kill the soil and do whatever purpose or plan God had for him amen praise God so that Natural Body formed and having in it Natural Life see in there and there it was we saw there was Adam the spirit man Adam a natural man that was formed but it wasn't let's say two different atoms it was just him right it was just him but we'll go right into this later and we'll see here let's go to the word of God Amen Now power to transform God's power to transform now he created by his word for he sent his word see and by that bless all them seeds he had placed upon the Earth amen now we're talking about you see natural type spiritual so when we're talking about all the seeds it's not just all those natural seeds you you before we used to think that God just planted the garden and those seeds he's talking also about the spiritual seed right that uh they came forth by the word and when they came forth by the word so all the seeds he placed upon the Earth thank God I'm glad God blessed all the seeds on the earth here and in this stage I thank God for his seed that he has placed in this particular age praise God hallelujah now go back to Adam the spirit man was not visible the spirit man could not be seen he could not be touched he could not be felt but when he got into the natural man then he could be touched seeing felt and heard right and then here he is uh still a spirit man but now he's come under the limitations of a human body and he's got to live under those restrictions of that human body that he was living in praise God thought the Bible says this natural man God breathed on him and he become a living soul that is to say like when the Titanic went down they said so 300 or a thousand or well many Souls were lost a plane goes down they say so many Souls it does not mean that um he the soul was dead and it come alive or or something like that he's just telling you that he became a living person Adam now can be considered a living person right now all the seeds that he had placed upon the Earth he formed the seeds by his word for there was nothing else to make the seed out of you seeing there now there was nothing for him to make these seeds out of therefore those seeds are a part of himself the seeds that he sent down here are a part of him because there was nothing else because he was Elohim praise the Lord I'm a kind of teaching today not preaching like last week but you see being God Elohim the self-existent one nothing else is there so out of himself these seeds came forth praise God hallelujah amen look so we see therefore this Mighty God hallelujah is doing this so you must recognize the difference between the seed and the ground and the seed in your heart but there's not much difference because one is in the natural ground and the other one is in the human flesh which is nothing but the dust of the earth and also ground too so when he talks about the sore went forth to sow and and so on you can understand how he planted those those seeds that's what he was talking about how spiritually he planted those seeds upon the earth now when he did that there was nothing else to make them seeds out of amen nothing else you see just himself was there praise God so you hear us over and over saying you are a part of God you're a part of him but you're only now revealed on this Earth you only now come to manifestation for this is the age of your manifestation or let me say it this way uh this is the edge for you to know what you need to know and in the time when you need to know it so the word itself coming to life being activated by the Holy Spirit praise the name of the Lord so there was nothing else to make that seed out of the seed out of and he placed them amen and they were hit like beneath the waters amen and when the time came he just began to speak and say Let There be let there be I kind of believe our time has come when the same holy spirit is saying let there be let there be let there be in other words come forth come fork and the spirit begins to call amen and them seeds started to come to life amen praise God hallelujah now we find out many times it looks like the Bible is just repeating itself I see and like it's even uh saying something that it that doesn't seem to say in other words we understand it a different way like how we read about the first Adam and we read about Adam is like you Adam created twice uh you see but that's not what it is if God has to reveal that to you amen for instance in the Genesis 1 if we find God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them amen and then he goes on to talk about the other things he created then we come to find out Genesis 2 there was no man to tell the soil he's just showing you how people can misunderstand the scriptures and the Bible repeats itself and it looks like it's contradicting but it's not contradicting it's talking about a spiritual man or a spirit man and a not true man amen praise God for there was no man to kill the soil then God created The Man Out of the Dust of the Earth you see now praise God so he says now that's what God did he created the spirit man first then the natural man now uh my if you can apply this yourself you will understand that part of the gene that was in you was always there all the time but the age in which you were to be born and to come and then he has to come about and bring about a union of that life praise God so that it could come forth in the age when it's supposed to come forth and to live and to perform his will not by putting on religious just being yourself and let the Holy Spirit work his will through you amen you don't have to get super spiritual you don't have to know anything you don't have to know all as we claim the message you don't have to be aware of every court you don't have to know this not that you need to just know him and you need to recognize Who You Are you need to recognize your purpose here to express God to be available for him to use in this age vessels set apart by the holy spirit that he can use it for his glory and for his honor amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen so we understand he's formed that uh first one by the spirit which was the first man and the second man he formed from the dust praise the Lord Genesis 2 7 amen praise God so man formed from himself and man the other man formed from the dust of the Earth praise God now we see coming from the dust of the Earth let me pause here you remember when God gave Abraham a promise and said I'm gonna take your seeds or your seed that they're going to be without number and I'll take them from the dust to the Stars right I can use the word back to the stars because that's what he was talking about I formed them or I put them into flesh I put them into bodies but after their purpose is done I'm gonna take them out and take them back where they come from praise God take them back where they come from praise the Lord now he breathed they Spirit of life Breath of Life I'm quoting brother Brandon here what he how he said it into him see not not eternal life natural life life to your flesh or to your body praise God because the other man is already Eternal praise God so he breathed in the spirit of life into him and he became a living soul a living person as I explained uh before Hallelujah for God John 4 says God is a spirit and there that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth praise the Lord now see the first man then that he created we must understand he was a spirit man in the image of God right there it was in the image and in the likeness of God right then he took that man and put that man in the flesh form that he created amen praise God hallelujah so you understand we we come Eternal but in each age so many he has gonna come forth and he formed you praise the Lord praise God I don't want to run ahead of myself praise the Lord amen so we see then he became a living Soul continuing God's power to transform now because the great Creator had just sent forth his word and saw the word seed was now there praise God hallelujah praise the Lord amen now this is just letting you know what's there before the natural seed was formed the word seed was already there waiting praise the Lord just the same with us before your body was formed praise God not by God himself back there forming Adam but because of sin God ought to use a woman to do the farming amen and before that was formed their Eternal part the gene the charm the seed word of God was already there waiting for that body to be formed hallelujah praise be to God Amen oh my see let me repeat this quote because the great Creator had sent forth his word and the word seed was there Hallelujah therefore we know that before the real sea the natural seed was ever formed the word seed was there waiting amen the word seed was already there waiting for the other part of it to be formed because every seed as he explained later on has a germ of life that you can't see in it that natural seed has a pulp around it but it's not the pulp it's the life that's in there that gives all of that something that it can live and move by amen praise the Lord see now praise God so we understand that God is like that amen praise God now when God speaks the word that's when the Holy Ghost comes down and he comes down to do what to Quicken the world he comes down to Quicken the word praise the Lord or breathe the Breath of Life on the word praise God so that that word could come to life amen praise God the same without us here today as I'm preaching the word the Holy Spirit comes on the scene and he begins to breathe the Breath of Life over the entire congregation to bring to life any seed of God that is not yet woke up the spirit of God just begins to breathe the Breath of Life the scripture just came to me like a hand that's just over her chickens waiting for them to come forth praise God offer them eggs waiting for for them to be born praise God and to come to life for the glory of God hallelujah amen so we find out that God formed a natural seed around this Supernatural word seed he just formed a natural seed around that amen and so the germ of Life lay in that natural seed and it has to lay there and wait until God says let there be life or let every seed now come forth and let it begin to bring forth after its kind is that right so we see therefore in you even while you are a sinner there was The Germ of life in US waiting on the correct season waiting on the time when God plans for it to comfort listen it's got nothing to do with the day when you recognize each one recognizes in their time by God's perfect will God can have you sitting for 40 years under the influence of the message and you'll never recognized but when the hour comes the Holy Spirit speaks the word breeds the breath of life and that seed comes to life by his grace and by his will amen that's why we don't push pull tug try to convince or anything like that that is not our business that's God's work that is a supernatural work that God himself is doing in this day and in this hour praise the name of the Lord O glory to God Amen yes we sit here now look when he put that seed there in the earth hallelujah amen natural and spiritual amen see he put it there and it can only come forth with the power of life within it that will begin to transform it from a seed into the kind of plant he wants it to be is that right praise God or whatever it was but it was God had to put that seed in there but it was there with potentials already in it waiting praise God hallelujah oh my I didn't even know what potentials were in me uh you don't know what potentials were in you but when the spirit of God comes and Strikes that then it begins the potentials begins to come forth amen oh my and then it would come forth and be whatever he said it should be oh my it would be that as long as it stands in Its Right category in other words it stays in its place recognize and stays in its place right in this category praise God now that thought wasn't expressed here but in other words as long as it doesn't go on hybrid itself but it stays in this category and begins to move right there it would be just exactly what God said it would be it has to be that way he had made it that way and this is now making a channel amen praise God because when he wakes that seed up that seed becomes a channel for him to manifest or to express himself because he has an outlet then he has a channel through you and through me praise the Lord to manifest praise the Lord now and anything that stays in his channel in his line of his word it will have to bring forth exactly his word amen praise God hallelujah amen praise God so God speaks the word but then the word has life in itself to reproduce itself you can find that in the church ages Amen to reproduce itself praise the Lord hallelujah amen so God through a seed of his word and there's only one thing that can Quicken that word and that is the holy spirit amen the holy spirit is the only one can activate the life that may be head in a seed in a human being it's hidden the human being so by the preaching of the word the holy spirit is able to send the reign of his presence upon the hearts of the individual and if there's a seed hidden under the Earth the spirit of God wakes it up activates it and brings it into life so it can begin to manifest what God wants it to be to manifest for the hour amen see the spirit is the only one for it is the life Giver to the world and when the life in the world meets with the life of the spirit that it produce whatever whatsoever the seed is are supposed to be amen it will produce that the seed doesn't have to do anything of itself the spirit of God is doing that by watering you with constant revelation by water in your understanding what the holy spirit is opening of his word by watering us and then we begin to like any plant expand expand unfold that flower begins to expand and unfold then grow for the glory and praise of the Living God hallelujah amen oh my John 1 1. in the beginning was the word Hallelujah and the Word was with God but now with understanding we understand in the beginning was all the word and all the word was in Christ hallelujah amen amen and the word became what oh you think it's him only up there oh my that word become flesh but for him he came flesh because his job was right there to do what the father sent him to do the others came in various ages right down to this age of the end time but it's still the same word of God being made flesh by the Holy Spirit oh praise God forevermore yes sir amen we see that said so that word of God was already there that germ all the germs went into Christ all the genes went into Christ Hallelujah and so the word was formed the word was formed and it was formed using Mary the word was conceived by the Holy Ghost right and therefore it came forth as Jesus Christ but before it was he was Jesus Christ first it began to end morphe as Melchizedek amen it's all them seeds that make up you see that milk has that coming forth but all of them together make up one person Jesus Christ Hallelujah for all that God was was in Christ amen oh thanks be to God Amen all Brothers O Brother preachers here you see why we are of the order of Melchizedek oh my glory to God we are of the order of Melchizedek because we are a part of that we're a part in him praise the name of the Lord amen praise God you see we find out that that we were there as part of the word as germs in him already praise the Lord and then we know that Melchizedek became Jesus Christ through God using the womb of Mary amen Melchizedek become a teeny weeny bit of germ the great God Amen to come down from his glory and became a teeny little germ and come from The Unseen to the scene right he humbled himself came down what condition bringing us Redemption that in the middle of a ledician age in the dead of night when we had not one faint hope inside God humbled himself and came down amen praise the Lord hallelujah now let me begin to speak something here because there's a lot of people go around talking about the Immaculate Concept conception you ever heard of it and the emphasis by them is that the body of Jesus was created in the womb of Mary and therefore Mary is this uh she's blessed but this great holy person almost like a god herself and almost like a redeemer herself and a mediate tricks and whatever else uh they proponged her to be as such so talking about Immaculate Conception and here we go proving this word we find out now we find he caused this to happen when this little seed amen without the man came into that egg in the field see amen you see now you gotta understand came in that egg God sent his word which we would want to say that's like the sperm or germ of God and then here is the egg now if he had left that egg to be produced by Mary then that would have been sinful flesh and he couldn't inhabit sinful flesh therefore he had to bring both sperm and egg so that when it comes together the life produced by that is the perfect life that we know as Jesus Christ amen now you see why I use the term the Immaculate Conception comes into view because that's the real Immaculate Conception that's the real Immaculate Conception amen God creating both and I as I've often said before that um he did not come from Mary he only passed through Mary God used her and blessed be her name because God used her praise God glory to God and we see that that's what he did now what I'm saying I'm going to give you the quote continues here amen now when the seed without a man came into that little egg in that the field that he had created you understand so it's not me saying it I just said it ahead but there's a quote saying it into that egg in that field that he had created right oh my see then that little seed that little germ right crawls into that egg and it starts developing cell after cell after cell and when it does that it's living off of the mother's life of her body and there she begins to feed our child or feed it through her bloodstream praise the Lord every mother in here doesn't know that that's what she has to do but that's what she's doing before the child evil is born she's beating that child but she's feeding that child through her blood right she's feeding the child through her blood praise God I want you to listen close here because let me alert you he's trying to show you she had nothing to do with one Speck of blood in him but he fed us a germ he fed on the blood of his mother because he had to eat and the natural body has to live so it used the blood of the mother to feed upon but the the life that was in him that she had nothing to do with whatsoever I'll read the rest of it that's just a praise see by me now see she feeds it not its blood but her blood right oh my see for she feeds it through her bloodstream see oh my no it has not one Speck of that Mother's blood but it feeds it from the vitamins from the mother but remember not her blood see not living by her blood to keep it now he does that to keep it from shock and things like that through that blood and that water right oh my I'm going to jump over some things here you can go yourself and read that and proving his word now we find that God came into his little self and began to develop cells there through that right from his mother's vitamins and things then when he became old enough in there he began to eat himself and what as he grew he began to eat it's the dust of the earth which came up in other words his body begins to grow his body begin to form that's the dust of the earth deforming amen right which come up plant life animal life he began to eat fish as you know and bread and so forth and began to develop cells then when he become fully matured at the age of 30 he was baptized in obedience to to God in the water went out and he went on his ministry right now this process that he's talking about if you're thinking Every Single Seed literally passes through the same process right amen now and what happened when he come to that age of maturity the dove which was God descending from heaven with a voice saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell amen praise God he says in other words what he was talking about is how Jesus was begotten in the womb of Mary that is why he's called us the only begotten son right he was begotten in the womb of Mary praise the Lord hallelujah we're not talking about the spirit of course I'm talking about the body uh being formed like that praise the Lord hallelujah amen praise God now Jesus of course was not created a repeat he wasn't created he was formed in the womb of Mary from the dust of the earth just like Adam was formed by God back in Genesis now it's a new creation coming and now he is formed Again by God but the dust of the earth is using is not ground the dust of the earth is a human being and he uses that to have the body that would be called his son to be formed at that particular time through the body the body feeding of his mother praise God hallelujah amen now token message amen we know that when Jesus came to the Earth he came to represent the Lamb of God so that he could take away our sins so that he could redeem us that he could buy us back and bring us back to God and be our substitute and so on all those various things amen praise the Lord so only when the Dove came upon him that he was fully empowered and quickened to go forth and to um performance Ministry and that is similar like when rain comes down on the seed only then is the seed activated and quickened that it can come forth and begin to express what it's supposed to be amen no matter how long you or I were in Christianity we could never manifest what we are supposed to be until the right reign of the Holy Spirit Came Upon Us amen and to bring out of you what was hid in you that you yourself didn't know what was hid up in you until God begins to manifest through you amen hallelujah and so God sends the true baptism of the Holy Spirit upon you when the dove the Holy Spirit conceives the word by the spirit coming upon that son or daughter that's formed or in a human body amen and he falls upon it praise God nobody else nothing else could Quicken that but when he comes he quickens it to life amen amen praise God Amen and that seed begins to produce what is supposed to produce for the glory of God Amen oh my praise God now we find out rapture the Rapture book then how do we get into his body amen First Corinthians 12 by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body amen no more uh you know human beings in other words when you break back to that realm recognize you are one of his you're the spirit man or Spirit man if you want to put it that way all together amen it's you they all baptize into one body because they all make up part of him amen so they baptize the one body by the Holy Spirit baptism amen by one Spirit we are all baptized and that the spirit is the Life of Christ amen and the life of any seed which he is the word seed praise God do you believe that and from him come many seeds he said look what he says he says do you know look how simply says it that uh the first tree any oak tree the first oak tree he says you know all these other oak trees come from that first tree well this is the same thought coming forth here he was the and is the Original Seed and every other seed that ever comes forth to Till the World Ends comes forth from him if it's going to comfort nothing else can produce it we don't want to go into all this talk about Theology and this and that nothing else can produce it no emotion no intellect no nothing only he can produce it himself only he can reproduce himself praise the name of the Lord for he is the seed and if that life if that seed see is there laying there then this baptism of the holy spirit will come upon it and then it's bound to bring forth this life that is in that seed amen praise God when the Holy Spirit comes upon it so if you're going to teach them about the Holy Spirit you understand is not what the denominations taught us for so long that Holy Spirit is now going to come on you and you're not going to get the Holy Spirit no you find out that spirit with Spirit are going to meet the prophet puts it so he says watch what happens when two omnipotenses meet and come together amen praise God because this is part of God Amen them and God themselves come and makes contact with him calling it back to himself praise God calling it back to his position praise God hallelujah amen yes sir I tell you your spirit alone quickness the word amen praise the name of the Lord now we want to go now to come the communion book I'm saying it so it goes on tape maybe you can use that too and we want to talk about this because right here you can see the two books the book of natural life and the germ or the gene the Lamb's Book of Life is that right so now you you take that thought and expand it and you understand that uh we are almost like two books walking around right because you got a natural life and and then you got the germ or the gene now if a person doesn't have the gene they really only have one one book and when that book is read and done uh you know they stand before the judgment and all that not to go into that but you just take that thought and you can run with it praise God so there's a connection there uh between the the spirit and the word seed the Lamb's Book of Life and just the natural book of life that we have now quoting from the communion book the First Book of Life coming up that comes up when you are born the first book of natural life amen then way back down in there there is a little grain of life amen now he's talking about you you're born the natural book of life but done in there amen he says is the Lamb's Book of Life a grain of life I was explaining this to some of the young sisters that there's a little grain of Life laying in there and you would wonder where did that come from where did that come from amen and I said to them take myself you see uh William Branham well 40 years ago William Branham the same one you see here tonight that somebody back there would say I knew William Branham 40 years ago he was nothing but a rank rascal see because I was born of Charles and Ella Branham I was nothing but a rank sinner I was born in their nature and therefore I was a sinner and I came to the world a liar and having all the habits of the world already laying in me because I was born in other words by natural birth through Charles and Ella Branham but see down in there right another nature was present predestinated in there by God Hallelujah takes me to God Amen see oh my that was in there well I only cater to one see I good and good and grew up and when I grew up I started to become a liar I become everything else because that's a sinner because I was raised up that way and in that nature of human life amen doesn't matter who you are nobody is born holy is that right I said nobody's born holy and you're born where are you going to Manifest this Natural Life right just like that now we find out I become a liar and everything else because I was raised up that way but let me repeat back down in there was a little speck of Life all the time not a speck of God's life what's right there laying in there all the time praise God oh my praise God I thank God for that friends that we can recognize that there's a spirit man living in this man is that right in you there's a spirit woman living in this woman that can be seen they can't see that person but that person lives in this person amen and they are manifesting God through this person hallelujah amen praise God now the Bible tells us we were dead in sins and in trespasses is that right Ephesians believe you Ephesians 2 right anyway the Bible says you were dead in sins and in trespasses wow what is he talking about it is the natural man that was born from mother father amen since the Garden of Eden that man was dead in sins and in trespasses doesn't matter how long he lives his end is going to be death doesn't matter what how many years how good how charitable how religious how educated his end is death and after death the Judgment that is his end as it really is oh my because that man is dead in sins but down in that mind if that person is an elected seed there is a speck of God's life living in there amen because back of God's life praise God and when it is the right time what is the right Edge for that to come to life then God will cause his word to go forth by a preacher preaching or some other means he'll let his word go forth and wake up that Speck of his life thus was hiding in there all the time amen praise God o my praise God continue on now remember there there was another William Branham in there this William Branham a Lyra cheated this and that you know everything else but he says remember there was another William Branham living in there that one a little spot of eternal life down there you would go home take the book and you read it yourself and you can slow down and think about it amen you see that little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God amen the word of God that was placed in there he called it the dream he called it The Germ he called it a spot of eternal life and you can go over what was being said here what he calls it that it was just laying there but it was laying there just waiting waiting for the time when it caught it's its name is called right let there be comfort Glenn come forth Gabriel come forth It's just waiting on his time it doesn't matter what persuasive preacher what powerful preacher comes that person could be in the church and they never understanding they never receiving the fullness of the word amen she teaches us with patience it teaches us to have Grace broadly kindness because humanly we look and see I can't see how she can understand this I can't see you cannot see how he can't understand this but it is in God's time for everything there is a time and a season and a purpose and God knows that Hallelujah but we human beings we always want to push this way and push that way and pull the other way amen praise the name of the Lord oh my so the word of God was placed in there amen but you understand brother sister God already seen your name and I'm saying that because your name if you are part of the Eternal genes of God is already in the book the Lamb's Book of Life is that right it's already in the lamps look alive so he knows your name over there never mind what they call you over here in the Book of Life is he knows your name in the Lamb's Book of Life and he knows what word to cause the minister to minister or to preach the prophet said you see it's not calling your name like James G in other words your natural human name they give you when he was born give him the name Jesus you come down here give him the name Harold give him the name this give him but he says but he knows your name and then he calls your name how by the word the opening of the word and if you are a part of the word and the preacher is preaching the word and you happen to be that exact part of the word it'll shake up your soul and wake you up and you'll recognize who you are amen because your call your name is being called right out of the word now I don't know any name you don't know any name but you're gonna know it you're gonna know it amen when the spirit calls your name amen praise be to God hallelujah amen praise God so that we understand here from all I'm saying is that God's thoughts or genes or attributes or germs amen are a part of God housed in a human body we were housed in a human body housed in a barn for a little while amen praise God and God then amen formed from the dust of the Earth they house that you were going to live in when a male female black white brown yellow whatever God knows that and he knows the reason why he put you there is that right you believe it I believe it so you see the stupidity of people when they look at uh race when they look at culture when they look at backgrounds God's genes are ageless and timeless and they are not limited to any race color creed or nothing the book of Acts says for they are the children of the my Almighty born by the blood of God and of the almighty amen praise God these are just houses we are allowed to live in so we can be down here and perform whatever we are supposed to perform for the glory of God we don't have to be aware of what we are supposed to do or you're supposed to know this you're supposed to know your purpose you suppose and then people are confused and that people are in chaos they don't know what they're doing all you are supposed to do is to live a Christian Life just live eat like he at walk like he walk and be a normal person don't be a stuck up in other words don't try to the denominational view of a Christian is somebody that looks so holy and Pious and righteous that they look different a natural difference it's not the natural difference it's a supernatural life that's flowing out of you that shows the difference without you saying anything not that you're gonna you're not gonna talk about him or about his word but it's what's coming out to you when you're not even thinking your unconscious godliness begins to flow somebody says something to you and and you don't even think about it you say ah don't worry about that the normal person that person you might have blow up knock their head off or wrestle them to the ground and they don't understand oh some will deliberately come and try to stir you up as Bob will say to hurry up and he will come and try to Stir It Up but when he comes you just smile because you know that's the devil just using one of his agents to do that and you're not even worrying about it but that's what God is doing in this time what a season we are living in amen when we begin to understand these things I want to say God bless mothers brothers let's give a hand for mothers [Applause] and I'm doing that not because we read in the Bible about Mary but what the truth that the prophet is bringing forth here that is not only Mary Mary that was formed in her by the direct spoken word but the the physical body was formed by God's spoken word amen but now he allows us to be formed Amen in the womb of a woman a wife a mother and come forth amen and that's why I'm saying and that's why I believe that's the way it takes me to now anyway why he said honor your father and your mother that your days may be long upon the land that the Lord thy God givethly it's the only commandment given with a promise attached to it because he used uh women uh who should be honored to bring forth that which is his own to feed it amen and to take care of it before it even come forth they're feeding it that's the prophet said here from their bloodstream they're feeding it that's why some of you will wanted to know all of a sudden oh my my wife asked me to go and buy some green mangoes I don't know how she wanted to suck on a lemon but they asked for strange things at strange times but brother Branham taught us that he says because something is calling for that like the boy that at the the the the bicycle tire off he says he needed the the chemicals or the the vitamins that was in that and that's why he was eating it and that's why they eat some of these strange things they want a ice cream and lemon at the same time right some kind of thing like that but it's because that child is calling for that it needs that some element in there it needs and God used them to form that house that that child or that germ or Gene is going to live in praise the Lord hallelujah so God bless you mothers God honor and bless you just as much as the honor Mary every real mother in here is blessed by God and honored by us and praise be to God for you God bless you all you see a little spot of eternal life done there from the very genes of God you see why I talk a lot about the seed and the Gene and The Germ because that's what it is you see it's the word of God that was pla the word of God was placed in there praise the Lord oh my then I looked up to the trees and I began to think leave I seen you fall off last year and here you are this year you're back again where did you come from what brought you here you see it was that eternal life working in the body in other words he's saying the eternal life in him was waking up it was coming awake but it started as it went on its way it started to think about things right oh my but then one day as I walked on I heard that voice oh my what a beautiful sermon right there one day as we were walking on our natural life and enjoying life and living and everything else I heard that voice amen and when I heard that voice what did it do it attracted your attention caused you to turn aside amen oh my oh see oh my and what did the voice amen praise God begin to say to me don't ever smoke don't drink and so forth see it spoke talking to me and saying that now it may not talk to you in an audible voice but somewhere he says in your life he says some of you can think of this it spoke to you amen it might not have said it like he said it but somehow you're not supposed to do this you're not supposed to be here like when brother Peter was here you know told me how he went into a bar and he's talking and thinking that he's a he's just a everybody with all the other guys and and he's talking the then those guys turn around and says man you're different you're supposed to be here and he recognized that that was the voice of God speaking to him amen and every one of us like he said here we will have something of like that somehow you know you are different because something revealed to you you're not just an ordinary person living a book of life and when the book comes to an end you close the book and that's the end of it no sir Oh my Jesus already done that for us in the old Temple there in Capernaum Bible says he read from the book called out the names and then he closed the book this Natural Body my the book may be close Hallelujah but out of that came a voice this is my beloved Son hear ye him praise Peter God Amen and that's the hour that we are living in here right now brother sister amen praise God oh my praise the Lord God forevermore I give him praise amen that voice is a voice like no other voice you ever heard like that Pastor that was passing by he was already a Pentecostal Minister he was the administrator of a major hospital and he was going by from work with his briefcase he just heard the voice of brother Branham we had received the first couple of tapes first time I'm going to hear Brother Brandon's voice weekend and we were just glued to that old Woolen Sac recorder and at the same time the tape coming forth and we were glued listening to it and we heard Bang Bang Bang on the door uh minded disturbing us went to the door opened it and he rushed me said what's that you're listening to he said I heard that voice I said he said I I don't know who that person is but that voice is coming from Heaven oh right now I believe anything that man says he never heard of brother Branham he nothing about it all he did was hear a voice have you heard that voice has it made a difference in your life if you have not been baptized get baptized if you haven't repented repent turn to God surrender your life whether you're here or you're out there in in the digital land up there hear the voice of God for your day and for your hour repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the Holy Ghost and he shall come upon you and bring to you to life to glorify your father which is in heaven amen all at once you see I looked up and when I looked up I said now I know I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Branham it means that he's not just he's not like putting away his mother and father but he's saying in natural life is really I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Branham that's just the flesh part right oh my see there is something out there that's now calling out to me amen all friends go listen my little Eagle story recognize you're not a chicken amen could anybody here recognize that I'm not a chicken I'm an eagle by the grace of God hallelujah I'm here I eat chickens praise God hallelujah I'm not a chicken I'm a eagle by the grace of when chickens see me they're scattered because Oh Glory of God because they know that you're ready to come after them for the glory of God amen glory to God hallelujah amen there I'm not a chicken there's something up yonder there somewhere out there calling me oh great over wherever you are whoever you are open up for me amen shouldn't every one of us begin to pray like that oh God open up the word open up your understanding open up the whole thing to me let me see the vistas of your promises and of your grace Lord let me see it clear praise God forevermore amen yes sir oh my open it up for me because Jehovah I want to come home you can't go and go home unless it's opened up to you there's no way you can do it and then that's when that happened he said then I was born again what brother Branham a minister in the Baptist Church preaching for many years 40 years old preaching and then he gets this strange feeling heard that voice and his life started to change and then when he comes to a full recognition because remember you heard the voice since he was a boy passing onto that tree carrying the water but it's only later on he understood because and he says when that angel came to him and said your Strange Life and so on was because I'm beginning to he said the moment I heard that voice I recognized it was the same voice that he heard when he was just a child amen and the same thing with us what spoke to you as you would say oh something said to me in my mind but now when you hear it comfort in the form of the word you recognizes the same voice praise God hallelujah says then I was born again that little life was laying there amen that life water was poured upon it and then it began to grow the Waters of Life the word of God was poured upon it and it began to grow praise God oh my in other words that began to manifest itself now that old life that's the one that was forgiven and put in the sea of God's forgetfulness never to be remembered against me no more see that life when those things were done or even done we are still alive in this body that is what God puts in the sea of his forgetfulness because he knows you and you he knows you're a part of him and he lost the seed of God really can't sin Satan is just doing that so that he he thinks he can get God so angry that he take one of his child and throw them in the fire like he did with all those uh religions with idolatry where they thrown their children in the fire or to feed them to crocodiles but God is not like that God knows his own he says I'm not going to lose one there's my neck coming right back to me praise the name of the Lord Jesus amen you see when you see when we understand this is remember now we stand Here We Stand Justified Hallelujah we stand here Justified when you understand what what was just said and what he just said you understand the gene in you is absolutely sinless because it can't sin it's a part of God James said it for the seed of God cannot sin it can't do it amen praise God hallelujah oh my praise God forevermore let's jump over uh to the Future home praise the Lord amen okay I still have 10 minutes to you let me use it up I'm not going to hold you beyond that but I want to get some of this stuff out future home of the Heavenly Pride and the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride amen praise the name of the Lord praise God now we know we understand here that we're talking about us having a holy convocation and the convocation is as them seas are brought back to recognition of the word they are coming together collecting and they all start worshiping God together again and praising him with understanding like Paul said not just praising him because you read it in the Bible but you praise in him now with Revelation or understanding and giving God all the praise the honor and the glory and you come into a state of holy convocation praise the name of the Lord amen praise God hallelujah because the spirit falling on the word seed the gene or The Germ amen the dove are coming on that uh Lamb of God Jesus back there the spirit coming in our day upon us amen for this hour praise God in other words one of God's little lambs the Holy Spirit coming again and anointing his children because uh quote the prophet again he says only those two natures one and the other coming together could ever fit it can't fit a fox or can't fit some other animal only those Natures can fit together amen hallelujah praise the Lord but you see that's why we stress and we preach that it's not just coming to church because you can cast a net in the sea like Jesus said like I preach the word of God and the word of God brought in a lot of people into the church but that doesn't mean because you have a church full of people that they all are Christians or in our terms all our message Believers are all our bride or all going in the presence of God that is as much as saying you throw the net and you caught some catfish and when you pull them in by God those catfish turn into rainbow trout it doesn't happen that way they are whatever they are by whatever life is in them right praise the Lord praise God or brother Glenn might be smarter than me and he might pull one of those things where you catch a pig and put him in a sheep pen and by tomorrow morning why God is no more a a pig he's a sheep it's not being in the church it's not the pen that you're in that change I'm sorry I'm talking like this but it's not the pen that you're in that changes your life oh I go to this big church over here my Minister and so and so my shepherd is educated over there that has nothing to do with it it's the very nature of the thing praise the name of the Lord that's the nature of it praise God hallelujah amen the spirit of God manifests whatever it is now I'm going to end this here praise the Lord Hallelujah I thank God we are in the kingdom of God not by our own will but by predestination praise the Lord I was about to say and I'm going to show you what he said about this but it's right here in front of me in the quote here now we know when you're into the kingdom of God with eternal life with the predestinated life that never did ever start amen it never started on any day so therefore you wasn't saved on any day oh my oh for you were always saved these are not my words this is the Prophets The Words of Malachi 4 5. Jesus just come to redeem that is that right that is all he come here to redeem but whosoever will May Come but he only come to redeem that predestinated that came from him but you see you were saved from the beginning because you had eternal life in you to begin with you come down here with eternal life is that right amen you didn't go get saved as they would think like that at the altar that is just an Awakening that is like a spiritual resurrection of a seed when the word of God makes it aware of who it is amen praise the Lord amen oh Hallelujah no matter look what it is talking about the high priest and that prostitute that was back there the woman at the well you see outwardly this man was pious righteous walking around with a prayer book make sure that it's painted with gold so you can recognize what book it is he was just pious amen but he wasn't a son of God see he wasn't the Son of God outwardly he was pious but inwardly he was not a son of God but what about that little prostitute see at the well she was really the daughter of God the same thing with Jacob and Esau right the same thing that you're seeing here right there no matter how a scholar we must color that priest was no matter anything like that he still didn't have predestination the representation of that predestination in him he had no representation whatsoever praise the Lord hallelujah how wonderful to know that we are here but you have representation there in the presence of the Living God because if you got eternal life you have that and that means you had to be a part of God all the time because he is the only Eternal there is and with those words I'm going to close here amen praise God God is the only Eternal and if you claim you have eternal life then you are claiming you are a son you are his daughter you're a chip off the old block amen you are a part of him now reveal upon the Earth you're a part of that host when Daniel said I looked and saw shrones and crowns being cast down to the Earth amen praise God the Bible tells us we are Kings and Priests to God come from the prince of God to be priests to this wicked age or whatever age you're in we are here in your own way doesn't mean you got to be like they say a priest just by yours saying a good word to somebody you don't know somebody was going to kill themselves or read somewhere and passing another person on the street and the person oh good morning how are you how's your and start talking to person the person changed their mind person changed their mind and you don't know if that even ever happened to you now because God don't always tell you what he's doing that's why he says the prophet said just go and live and just be a Christian and let your order of your life like a be away side flower talks about the Wayside flower he said they're just spilling their Breeze spilling out the the perfume of the of the lily of the valley and any passerby if they smell it in there and like it and enjoy it praise God wonderful and that's all we have to do isn't it wonderful we have entered into the Believers rest musicians are coming now praise the Lord if entered into the Believers rest and we can trust God live in peace live in harmony with our friends with our families praise the Lord hallelujah I know there's a little separation there live in harmony with your friends and your family and not always right because it depends on what is back there amen but thanks be to God I'm happy friends not just happy for you as I was telling some of the brothers yesterday how I'm so thankful when I uh look and see and hear Brothers preaching testifying singing living I feel so blessed of the Living God I feel so much blessed because I realized starting preaching what I was feeling in my spirit but couldn't Express and then it through the years clearer clearer clearer until now he's got distilled right and it's now coming 100 Proof it's up to you if you want to drink it but praise God and so I I just look and I said thank God because when I look at these brothers oh my when I hear these brothers uh praise God he's got it I hear some of the sisters talking oh my goodness she's got it this one's got it praise the Lord you realize the Holy Spirit has gone forth into your lives I'm producing something Beyond me you can say oh oh you're teaching you're no no no no no no no that was just use the wave over you for you to wake up that's all that was God used it to wave it over you so you can wake up and now you woke up those of you who have woke up recognize who you are and walk in the light of your day for the glory and praise of God God bless these few words to your hearts and lies you can come brother foreign [Music] born not of the will of man not of the blood of man but by the Holy Ghost praise God that's just the portion of scripture that just came to me as I turn to go you are born conceived of the Holy Ghost not that the will of man not of the blood of man but you're born by the word of God God bless you amen I'm Justified I'm Justified [Music] I can't deny the times I've made mistakes [Applause] Justified Justified [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause]

the purpose first our purpose is it is to bring us people to Jesus and to earn maturity and okay our purpose is to bring people to Jesus and for membership in a family in into maturity and if fulfill with the first perfect purpose of glorifying God to change [Applause] amen praise God forevermore
