[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] praise the lord it's
[0:16] good to be here again giving all the
[0:19] glory
[0:20] honor and praise unto the lord
[0:24] welcome friends happy to have you
[0:26] brothers and sisters
[0:28] in the presence of the lord may the lord
[0:32] bless you real good as
[0:35] we continue in our studies
[0:38] in the seven church ages particularly
[0:42] in the age of smyrna
[0:46] we ended our last talk by
[0:49] uh speaking of the hybriding
[0:53] that is in the world today and how
[0:56] it all started with
[1:00] eve in the garden of
[1:03] eden from whence we have
[1:07] this great uh process
[1:10] of high breeding man
[1:13] the humanity or the human race
[1:17] with animals producing
[1:21] a hybrid and it continues today
[1:26] human beings with a beast
[1:30] producing a hybrid cane
[1:34] with a nature contrary to god
[1:39] and god's word let us
[1:42] read out of the book of genesis chapter
[1:47] 4 verse 1.
[1:51] and adam knew eve
[1:54] his wife and she
[1:57] conceived and bear cain
[2:03] and said i have gotten
[2:06] a man from the lord
[2:10] verse 2 says and she again
[2:15] bare his brother abel
[2:19] and abel was a keeper
[2:22] of sheep but
[2:26] cain was a tiller of the ground
[2:31] just to clarify this
[2:35] knew eve his wife once
[2:40] and then she bore twins
[2:44] cain and then
[2:48] abel now
[2:51] not to go over the doctrine
[2:54] and teaching of the serpent's seed
[2:59] how that the serpent seduced eve
[3:05] and produced by her
[3:08] a hybrid son
[3:13] a bastard born to the word of god
[3:17] contrary to the will and
[3:20] plan of god and
[3:24] abel was the son of adam
[3:28] but cain was a son of the devil
[3:32] as spoken off in the book of first john
[3:39] now if we will look at the statement
[3:41] that eve makes here
[3:44] i have gotten a man
[3:47] from the lord eve had a lot more
[3:51] revelation
[3:52] and understanding than most people
[3:56] realize
[3:59] she did not publicly
[4:03] uh attribute the son to satan
[4:08] because that way how he came in
[4:12] um satan would have been able to
[4:16] spend another life that he was a creator
[4:21] like god
[4:23] she said i've gotten a man from the lord
[4:27] now in this sense that anything that
[4:31] happens god allows
[4:36] god allows so
[4:39] she's saying i've gotten a man
[4:42] because god permitted it
[4:46] god allowed me to have it
[4:50] but not that god was the father of that
[4:53] son
[4:55] so here we find my brothers and sisters
[5:00] that satan lost his opportunity right
[5:03] there
[5:04] of being able to say he's a creator for
[5:06] he was
[5:07] not he is a creation of god
[5:11] and a perverter of the will and the word
[5:15] of god
[5:16] and this is what we're talking about
[5:20] satan can create nothing of himself
[5:24] but what he does is watches whatever
[5:28] god does and then he copies it
[5:33] and perverts it adds
[5:37] a little bit here or a little bit there
[5:40] and then claims ownership of
[5:43] it that he invented
[5:46] or created it
[5:50] now we realize
[5:54] that god produced adam and eve by
[5:58] his spoken word creation
[6:02] as a matter of fact god's entire
[6:05] creation
[6:07] its foundation its origin
[6:11] was from his spoken word
[6:15] just read genesis 1 1 and it begins
[6:18] and god said and god said and it was so
[6:21] and god said and it was so and god
[6:24] said and it was so and that's the way it
[6:28] was
[6:30] according to hebrews chapter 11
[6:34] verses uh verse
[6:38] 1 verse 3 it says
[6:42] by faith we
[6:46] understand that the worlds
[6:50] were framed by the word of god
[6:56] god's spoken word was the origin
[7:00] of this entire creation of our
[7:03] entire universe made up of
[7:06] many worlds of which earth
[7:10] is just one and we are domiciled or
[7:15] live on this planet earth
[7:19] here we are on planet earth
[7:22] and it was framed or formed
[7:26] by the spoken word of god oh there's
[7:29] power in the spoken word there's
[7:32] creation
[7:33] in the spoken word out of the spoken
[7:37] word from the mouth of god it
[7:40] is so when god speaks it for god's
[7:44] word must come to pass amen
[7:47] praise god hallelujah now listen
[7:52] only god god was the only one
[7:55] that had the power to create for now
[7:58] when we come to the birth of christ
[8:02] we understand by by this
[8:05] god was illustrating
[8:08] and demonstrating what adam
[8:12] should have done
[8:16] at the beginning of the world
[8:21] adam should have spoken his word
[8:26] to his wife eve
[8:30] which would cause her to conceive
[8:33] by the planting of a word seed
[8:38] and she would have produced a word
[8:41] child or a child from him
[8:44] that was by god's ordained
[8:47] and god's provided way
[8:51] but instead she allowed
[8:55] satan to seduce her
[8:59] and by that seduction
[9:02] he injected or introduced
[9:07] into the creation and into
[9:10] our world the process
[9:13] and program called pro-creation
[9:19] now creation by the spoken word
[9:23] procreation by human instrumentality
[9:29] so close but yet a million miles apart
[9:34] now in the birth of christ
[9:37] our lord was illustrating
[9:41] how what adam should have done
[9:45] for the bible tells us in the book of
[9:48] matthew
[9:50] that from the presence of god came the
[9:53] angel
[9:53] gabriel and
[9:57] an angel stood before that virgin
[10:02] and spoke the word of god
[10:06] god's spoken word came
[10:09] through the mouth of an angel
[10:14] thou shalt bear a son
[10:17] amen and his name
[10:21] shall be called jesus
[10:24] and he shall save his people
[10:28] from their sins by
[10:31] that spoken word through the mouth
[10:35] of an angel
[10:38] creation of an egg
[10:43] in the womb of mary
[10:47] that came together and agreed
[10:50] with the word of god
[10:54] producing jesus
[10:57] christ the same yesterday today and
[11:00] forever
[11:04] now in our day takes me to god
[11:08] in these last days we are blessed by god
[11:13] that once his church
[11:17] drifted away from him
[11:21] drifted into worldliness churchianity
[11:24] creeds
[11:24] dogmas doctrines litanies various
[11:28] theologies covenants different things
[11:31] they've gone away into religious
[11:34] sciences
[11:35] religious teachings programs and so on
[11:38] what god in the middle of that seeing
[11:41] that his
[11:42] church has been deceived
[11:46] and that she has been drawn away
[11:50] by enticing spirits
[11:54] and seducing spirits with doctrines of
[11:58] devils
[12:00] god in our day has sent his
[12:03] angel his angel the seventh church angel
[12:08] to the seventh church age with
[12:11] a message for his people
[12:15] and sent him to bring this
[12:18] the word of god to god's people
[12:22] for the spoken word is the original seed
[12:27] it's the original seed that created
[12:30] everything and god
[12:33] allowed him to speak
[12:37] the message of the hour this spoken word
[12:43] that we as believers may open
[12:46] our hearts and receive the word of god
[12:51] receive the message of the owl
[12:55] and it would do what it will
[12:58] produce a genuine spoken
[13:02] word seed new birth
[13:06] and that brings about the reverse
[13:10] of satan's curse and
[13:13] place within us this
[13:16] confidence this certainty of god
[13:20] that we have the original life
[13:24] we have the original seed and we are
[13:28] walking in the light of the day
[13:32] now we realize
[13:36] that eve brought forth the serpent seed
[13:41] they were brought in the garden bought
[13:45] cain and abel there were in
[13:49] the original church if you want to put
[13:52] it that way
[13:53] both cain and abel
[13:57] that being in the church
[14:02] did not make them original seed
[14:05] sons seed children
[14:08] of the living god
[14:12] more than a pig
[14:15] being in a sheepfold
[14:18] it does not change that that peaks
[14:22] nature
[14:23] the nature of the pig remains the same
[14:28] even if he was raised
[14:31] every day of his life in a sheepfold
[14:36] his essential nature remains the same
[14:41] and he will never be transformed
[14:45] or changed into a lamb
[14:49] no prayers no burning of candles
[14:54] no particular doctrines of man
[14:58] not theologies nor persuasions of man
[15:02] nothing could change him transform him
[15:07] and move him and turn him from
[15:10] a big into a
[15:13] sheep or a lamb
[15:17] it cannot do it for every
[15:20] seed will bring forth after its kind
[15:25] amen even though bought seeds
[15:29] went through the similar process
[15:34] the children were different
[15:37] different because they were from
[15:40] different seeds
[15:43] different origins
[15:46] and lived different lives
[15:50] one la la the life of abel
[15:54] spoke of the truth of god
[15:57] the life of cain
[16:00] was just a a constant speaking
[16:04] of the satan's big lie
[16:08] amen he was a witness
[16:12] a testimony a billboard
[16:15] for satan's lie while the life
[16:18] of the other was a testimony
[16:22] and a flashing billboard
[16:25] of the truth of the very word
[16:28] of god amen
[16:32] oh my imagine
[16:36] she's saying cain
[16:40] was from god
[16:43] and accepting the devil's life
[16:46] [Music]
[16:48] instead of god's truth
[16:51] and that is exactly what our churches
[16:55] have done
[16:57] they have set themselves up as fountains
[17:00] of truth
[17:02] as depositories and repositories
[17:06] of the truth of the word of god but the
[17:09] truth is
[17:10] not in them the truth is not in them
[17:14] and yet their begotten children
[17:19] swear by them and would even kill for
[17:22] those
[17:23] churches their their loyalty and their
[17:27] faithfulness is not in the word of god
[17:31] not in the proclamations from the
[17:34] gospel of jesus christ but it's
[17:38] founded in their church doctrines
[17:41] teachings
[17:42] whatever it is that was laid in them
[17:46] from there the time of their natural
[17:49] birth and this is not an
[17:52] exaggeration this is not my
[17:55] personal sentiment but
[17:58] it is the proclamation of the word of
[18:02] god
[18:03] as found in ii timothy chapter 3.
[18:09] i charge thee
[18:15] therefore before god
[18:18] and the lord jesus christ uh timothy
[18:22] 4 who shall
[18:26] judge the queen and the dead at his
[18:28] appearing
[18:30] and his kingdom preach
[18:33] the word not church doctrine
[18:37] not litanies not the things of man
[18:41] not the geologies of man that have been
[18:44] distilled
[18:45] in their distillery of human science
[18:48] religious sciences no sir but
[18:51] preach the word preach the word
[18:56] preach it be instant in season
[19:00] hallelujah thank god it must be in its
[19:04] season
[19:05] and then it must be instant in season
[19:09] and out of season reprove
[19:13] rebuke exhort
[19:17] with all long-suffering
[19:21] long-suffering because you must
[19:24] stoop be humble and understand
[19:27] others who do not see or catch
[19:30] the revelation of your day and your of
[19:33] your
[19:33] hour preach
[19:37] and endure let them
[19:40] endure sound doctrine
[19:43] amen preach sound doctrine
[19:47] for the time will come when
[19:52] they will not endure
[19:55] sound doctrine that's our day that we're
[19:58] living in
[20:01] people want to be fed on fantasies and
[20:03] fables
[20:05] people want to be fed a diet religious
[20:08] myths and lines instead of sound
[20:11] doctrine the sound doctrine to them
[20:15] sounds caustic it sounds
[20:18] cutting it sounds crude
[20:21] and rough it sounds out of
[20:24] date it sounds that it is not in line
[20:29] with the flow of society
[20:33] not realizing that is not what we should
[20:36] stay in
[20:36] rhythm with we should be in rhythm
[20:40] with the word of god and the sound of
[20:43] the music
[20:45] that's leading a bride right into the
[20:47] skies
[20:49] trust him and believe him
[20:52] only believe for all things are
[20:56] possible to them that will
[20:59] believe the word of truth
[21:03] they will not endure some doctrine
[21:08] but after their own lust
[21:11] shall they heep to themselves teachers
[21:16] oh my what a day everywhere teachers
[21:21] preachers self-proclaimed prophets
[21:26] self-proclaimed apostles self-proclaimed
[21:31] great men oh god have mercy
[21:35] we are surrounded by multitudes of
[21:39] voices all claiming
[21:42] to be true but the bible says they
[21:47] shall keep up to themselves
[21:51] teachers having itching ears
[21:56] my god having itching ears
[21:59] you're itching to hear something new
[22:04] they're hip itching to hear something
[22:07] fresh
[22:08] they're itching to hear something
[22:10] different
[22:12] listen but the word of god does not
[22:14] change
[22:16] it's the old time holy spirit
[22:19] and the devil would go near it it's the
[22:22] old-time gospel
[22:24] that remains the same the word of god
[22:28] does not change it remains the same from
[22:32] the beginning
[22:33] unto the very end
[22:36] and by my friends
[22:39] having itching ears after a while
[22:43] such people itching to hear this
[22:47] itching to hear that they slowly
[22:50] begin to turn away
[22:53] from the truth satan begins to slowly
[22:58] inch them away from the original
[23:02] word of god which begins to seem
[23:06] like i said crude and rough to them
[23:11] while satan's meal sounds
[23:14] smooth and ordered and orderly
[23:19] yes and easily absorbed
[23:23] and taken in while the word of god takes
[23:27] you
[23:29] to have heirs that will hear
[23:33] of revelation oh my
[23:37] hearts to believe the truth
[23:40] of the word of god listen to the voice
[23:44] of god
[23:45] but watch watch now in
[23:48] all things
[23:52] endure afflictions
[23:56] do the work of an evangelist
[24:01] make full proof of your ministry
[24:07] hallelujah my friends
[24:11] the moment adam and eve
[24:14] left the word of god moved away
[24:18] from their original thai post
[24:22] death spiritual death and natural death
[24:28] set in upon them
[24:31] and there was no more strength
[24:36] in eve there was no more strength
[24:41] and so with the church their children
[24:45] were not born by the spoken word of god
[24:51] the children was born from a different
[24:54] source
[24:56] religious but from a different source
[25:01] and yet they claim their son
[25:05] their sons and daughters their
[25:07] membership
[25:09] that they are children of god
[25:13] and god rejects them for they are not
[25:15] his own
[25:17] god rejected cain and cain's offering
[25:20] cain's worship cain's altar
[25:23] it was all rejected and
[25:26] god testified of a bell
[25:30] though crude and rough with a rock
[25:33] cutting the neck of a lame and blood
[25:36] spraying everywhere
[25:38] yet he was the son of god
[25:41] he was filled with god's spirit god's
[25:44] leadership and god's anointing
[25:48] and god's revelation was upon him
[25:51] god testifying of his gift
[25:56] no strength
[25:59] and so what happened
[26:02] she became a monstrosity
[26:06] the original church
[26:09] of acts started to become a monstrosity
[26:15] from this age of smyrna
[26:18] bitterness had set in
[26:22] affliction had set in
[26:25] false doctrines had set in
[26:29] teachings of the nicolaitans
[26:32] had set in disobedience
[26:35] blindness to the word of god
[26:38] had set in and was swarming and taking
[26:42] over
[26:43] the entire work of god and the church
[26:47] of the living god the church
[26:52] that church of smyrna
[26:56] began to move away and move into
[26:59] forms and move into nickelodeon's
[27:04] ceremonies
[27:06] and began to organize
[27:10] a nickelodeon styled priesthood
[27:14] organized
[27:18] not ordained by god not called by the
[27:21] holy spirit
[27:23] not led by the holy spirit
[27:26] not led by the original shepherd
[27:30] of the sheepfold jesus christ
[27:33] yes but they are led
[27:36] by their organization and the
[27:39] head or leader of their organization
[27:43] instead of being led by the word of god
[27:48] and so they began to organize a
[27:52] priesthood
[27:55] into a group and they
[27:58] decided who the leadership
[28:02] of that priesthood would be
[28:05] instead of the holy spirit
[28:08] being the leader of it they claim
[28:12] the holy spirit gave them the wisdom to
[28:15] choose
[28:16] who will be the person that will lead
[28:19] that priesthood
[28:20] but that is contrary to the word of god
[28:24] it's not in god's bible
[28:28] and that moment death entered
[28:31] into the true church of the living god
[28:36] and discerned the lord's body and you
[28:39] will find
[28:40] that the the church of jesus christ
[28:44] so-called is one of the sickest bodies
[28:48] that we know
[28:52] change from a church filled with the
[28:54] power to glory
[28:55] the glow and the anointing of the holy
[28:57] spirit
[28:59] into a powerless group
[29:03] that loves to stress death and
[29:06] suffering and poverty
[29:09] oh my may god help us in this hour
[29:13] as we look and compare with the word
[29:17] of the living god yes sir
[29:20] i as i've said she moved from form
[29:23] move into forms and into ceremonies
[29:27] and into an organized priesthood
[29:31] and became a powerless church
[29:35] she has natural power but no spiritual
[29:38] power
[29:40] and her only weapon
[29:43] of friends has become what
[29:47] argumentation and debate
[29:51] by religious knowledge using
[29:54] that instead of the
[29:57] weapon of the revelation
[30:02] of the word of god
[30:05] and so as eve
[30:09] as the age of smyrna
[30:13] the church of this hour also modern
[30:16] church
[30:17] has built her hopes
[30:21] and our dreams built up on programs
[30:26] and not built
[30:29] upon faith in the
[30:32] word of god my friends
[30:35] and because they sold
[30:39] or planted programs in the hearts of
[30:42] their people
[30:44] they will reap and are reaping programs
[30:49] sought perversion perverted word
[30:53] into the minds and hearts of their
[30:56] people
[30:56] and so they are reaping
[31:00] perversion and perverted children
[31:05] they've tampered with god
[31:09] and when you tamper with god and the
[31:11] things of god
[31:12] you are going to reap exactly what you
[31:16] injected
[31:17] into it what you saw into it
[31:20] oh my god have mercy let's learn from
[31:24] nature
[31:24] my friends look at nature let's learn
[31:27] from nature watch how the human
[31:32] race has polluted nature
[31:35] tampered with nature and
[31:39] cross bred and high breeded
[31:42] nature how
[31:46] great men of science
[31:50] men of natural knowledge have injected
[31:54] their own ideas
[31:55] into nature and
[31:59] even to the rearrangement of molecules
[32:04] and by doing this we are now the human
[32:08] race
[32:09] is paying the price we are reaping
[32:13] the whirlwind by all manner of
[32:16] plagues and sickness and obesity and
[32:20] and old friends all manner of change in
[32:23] our bodies and our minds in our approach
[32:26] to things
[32:27] it's being changed because you become
[32:30] what you eat
[32:33] we see the bread and chickens
[32:38] and they are so highly bred they have
[32:41] become
[32:42] literal laying egg laying machines
[32:47] you don't need a machine you just need a
[32:50] properly bred
[32:51] chicken by the hype breeding to be an
[32:54] egg egg-laying machine
[32:59] not good lay a lot of eggs but they're
[33:03] not good for food
[33:05] they'll produce a lot of chicken some of
[33:07] them but they're
[33:09] not good for food they become soft
[33:13] not a rough rugged believing
[33:16] christian but they become soft
[33:19] and are poor for eating
[33:23] as far as that goes all manner of
[33:26] substances being injected into those
[33:29] poor
[33:29] animals and changed their
[33:32] molecular uh makeup
[33:36] and their turn from just a beautiful
[33:40] bird into a monstrosity of man
[33:44] oh friend look where we're at now
[33:47] and we see the same thing has happened
[33:51] the human race they place the substances
[33:55] in the chickens in the meat in the
[33:58] whatever
[33:58] else they they're giving us and then we
[34:02] eat it and we take in the very same
[34:05] substances
[34:06] that were in the chicken in the fish in
[34:09] in the whatever whatever other animals
[34:12] in the cows we take it all in
[34:16] and it changes our entire
[34:19] molecular structure and as a result of
[34:22] it
[34:24] women are getting wider in the shoulders
[34:26] narrower in the hips
[34:29] and the opposite is happening with men
[34:32] narrower in the shoulder and wider in
[34:34] the hips
[34:35] oh god have mercy and the human body is
[34:39] changing dramatically in the
[34:42] hour that we are living in because we
[34:46] have
[34:46] tempered with the natural
[34:50] food praise my god and if you tamper
[34:54] with the natural food you begin to
[34:57] produce a lot of natural human
[35:00] monstrosities
[35:01] and spiritually you trim temper with the
[35:04] food
[35:05] of the word of god and you begin to
[35:07] produce
[35:08] nothing but spiritual my friends
[35:11] uh spiritual monstrosities
[35:14] uh you begin to produce that here and
[35:18] what do you have
[35:19] my god the only answer to a perverted
[35:23] godless antichrist system my friends
[35:28] the only answer is god will have to cast
[35:31] the entire thing
[35:32] into the lake of fire like he did in the
[35:36] day of
[35:36] noah when he said i'm gonna wash the
[35:39] entire thing out i'm gonna have a new
[35:43] world
[35:44] i'm gonna wash this out he did it by
[35:47] water
[35:48] but now it's fire next time so
[35:51] fire upon the earth that will burn out
[35:54] and consume the things of this world and
[35:58] of
[35:58] satan the germs the evil that has been
[36:02] placed upon it
[36:03] here my friends here we are oh my
[36:08] bro the product
[36:11] of a church monster
[36:14] we have nothing but a denominational
[36:18] patchwork off of a frankenstein
[36:22] claiming that it is a son of god it's a
[36:25] child of god
[36:26] and it's nothing but a patchwork of
[36:29] denominational
[36:31] names patching themselves together
[36:34] in a union of churches so-called
[36:37] and my friends nothing but the
[36:40] beast again nothing but a monstrosity
[36:44] nothing but a frankenstein that's making
[36:48] a a claim that is baseless
[36:52] a bottomless pit building
[36:55] castles in the air
[36:59] castles built on the foundations of lies
[37:03] oh god have mercy for the hour
[37:06] that we are living in this dying age of
[37:10] smyrna
[37:11] when it died it never came back and no
[37:14] revival
[37:15] ever comes back from wherever it was
[37:18] it cannot because
[37:22] they have taken substitutes
[37:26] and rejected the word of god
[37:29] the only thing that can bring it back is
[37:32] fire from above
[37:33] regeneration from above the holy spirit
[37:37] coming from above can change the entire
[37:40] thing
[37:40] other than that my friends
[37:44] we look and see the last age
[37:47] started in 1906.
[37:50] with the great pentecostal revival
[37:54] but what they organized themselves right
[37:56] back
[37:58] instead of them taking the word of god
[38:04] they took the manual
[38:07] they took my friends the roberts rules
[38:09] of order
[38:11] they took all manner of organizational
[38:13] tools
[38:15] and begin to teach them and apply them
[38:18] with authority and with certainty
[38:22] as if there were the word of god
[38:25] and they were believed by millions and
[38:28] masses
[38:29] of people in the world my friends
[38:33] and here we find when they substituted
[38:36] their own ideas
[38:39] and begin to persecute
[38:43] each other and blame
[38:46] one another in every way
[38:49] they love their organization above
[38:52] everything else
[38:54] and what we have now is nothing but a
[38:57] second
[38:58] third fourth fifth sixth seventh
[39:00] generation
[39:02] of so-called pentecostals
[39:05] but i want you to know it's been said
[39:07] before i'll
[39:08] say it again god has no grandchildren
[39:13] you must be born again
[39:16] not your mother not your father not the
[39:19] pastor not the deacon
[39:22] not the priest not the supervisor not
[39:24] the superintendent
[39:26] you must be born again you
[39:29] must see him for yourself you must
[39:32] recognize your day
[39:34] and your hour in which we are living
[39:37] in amen praise god hallelujah
[39:40] oh praise god amen think about it
[39:45] churches not known for the power of the
[39:49] revelation of god's word
[39:52] but they are now known
[39:55] by their form of their worship
[39:59] by the ceremonies that they
[40:02] carry out they're distinguished
[40:05] by the difference of how they worship
[40:09] rather than by the word
[40:12] of the living god oh praise this
[40:16] wonderful name
[40:18] they can talk about what used to be
[40:21] and how it happened back then and back
[40:23] there
[40:25] and they've got my friends a whole lot
[40:28] of lightning
[40:30] but they lost the thunder all the
[40:33] thunders are gone from them
[40:35] but they've got a lot of lightning oh
[40:39] cracks and kraken sounds but
[40:42] no none of the
[40:46] real voice of god making itself
[40:49] manifest in their very myths
[40:53] what their boss about the glory of their
[40:57] founding of their movement little do
[41:01] they
[41:01] recognize ichabod ichabod
[41:05] the glory is departed the presence of
[41:08] god has left them
[41:10] the spirit of god has left the house and
[41:13] we are left with the works of
[41:14] man working up emotion and
[41:18] all kinds of generations things
[41:20] generated by
[41:22] man con contrary to the word of god
[41:26] oh praise god hallelujah oh my god
[41:30] the real pentecost started spontaneously
[41:34] and they should have left it spontaneous
[41:37] revelation is spontaneous it is not
[41:40] contained it's not educated into you
[41:43] it's not
[41:43] formed into a book of sciences that can
[41:46] be taught
[41:47] but it's something revealed flesh and
[41:50] blood has not revealed this unto you
[41:53] but my father in heaven has revealed
[41:56] this
[41:56] unto you and upon this
[41:59] rock of revelation upon this rock will i
[42:03] build my church and the gates of hell
[42:06] shall not prevail against it oh friends
[42:09] what is baptist methodist nazarenes
[42:12] uh presbyterians brethren church of
[42:16] god uh you know church of god in christ
[42:19] whatever the
[42:19] name might be is irrelevant but
[42:22] all these brethren wonderful
[42:26] people as they may be
[42:30] brought up by different doctrines
[42:33] controlled and brought up under
[42:36] the tutelage of different
[42:39] bylaws church manuals
[42:44] and standards but when a genuine
[42:48] pentecost came
[42:50] 1906 and when it comes
[42:53] god sweeps aside all the manuals
[42:57] methods plans programs
[43:00] of man and and brings himself
[43:04] right in destroying every dispensational
[43:08] tear
[43:09] theory and restore
[43:12] the gifts of the spirit and now
[43:15] he is restored and is restoring
[43:18] his word in the midst of his people
[43:22] proving that he is the same yesterday
[43:25] today and forever
[43:27] the mighty god in christ hallelujah
[43:31] but did these people and do these people
[43:34] learn their lesson that god is a god of
[43:38] spontaneity
[43:40] and moves upon the people in this day
[43:43] and hour no sir they don't do it
[43:47] and because of that and because of
[43:49] having no faith they try to preserve
[43:51] that revival
[43:54] in other words as men try to preserve
[43:56] food by putting it in cans
[43:58] and that way they'll be able to preserve
[44:00] it and use it a long time from now
[44:03] they tried to preserve god
[44:06] or can god can him
[44:09] make him put him in a can and preserve
[44:12] his teaching his doctrine his word
[44:15] meanwhile it's dead meat
[44:19] everything is dead when they can it
[44:22] it's not alive anymore they did not
[44:26] learn their lessons and now they're
[44:29] written up their own textbooks
[44:31] they all their own theological books
[44:35] which are taught in their seminaries
[44:37] their teach the books of their laws
[44:40] wrought their own church manuals
[44:43] fellowship books standards of doctrine
[44:48] orders of fellowship with one mind
[44:51] to prove that they now have all the
[44:54] truth
[44:55] and they have all the answers and
[44:58] as such they become the very elite of
[45:01] god
[45:02] who know the way and can they're the
[45:05] only ones that can
[45:06] show the way because they have got it
[45:11] but i want to say to you they have not
[45:13] got it
[45:15] as long as i'm closing now they have not
[45:18] got it
[45:18] because they have hybridized themselves
[45:22] they are and by that they have produced
[45:26] a hybrid religion a religion that is
[45:30] half god and half man half beast
[45:34] half word half
[45:37] man's teaching man's mind man's
[45:39] reasoning man's argumentation
[45:42] placed in there and it's not glorifying
[45:45] god glorified man glorify god
[45:48] and a mixture of boat and produce
[45:50] nothing but a
[45:51] hybrid religion in the iron which we're
[45:54] living in
[45:55] oh praise my god my friends
[45:59] but they are is that if you want to be
[46:01] in the bride
[46:02] or if they want to be in that wonderful
[46:06] glorious number called the bride of
[46:09] christ
[46:10] they're going to have to come the very
[46:13] way their forefathers came
[46:16] they're going to have to come by the way
[46:20] of the
[46:21] revelation of the word of god
[46:23] spontaneous
[46:24] revelation of the word of god
[46:28] if you want to be in the bride
[46:31] you'll have to follow revelation
[46:35] chapter 18 verse
[46:38] 3 which reads
[46:44] for all nations
[46:47] have drunk of the wine of the wrath of
[46:51] her fornication
[46:53] and the kings of the earth have
[46:54] committed fornication
[46:56] with her and the merchants of the earth
[46:58] are wax
[46:59] rich through the abundance of our
[47:02] delicacies
[47:03] and i heard a voice from the heavens
[47:06] saying
[47:07] come out from her my people
[47:12] and ye be not partakers of our sins
[47:17] that you receive not her plagues
[47:21] for her sins have reached up into heaven
[47:25] and god has remembered our iniquities
[47:29] oh my my friends hear the call
[47:33] hear the cry come out of that
[47:36] denomination
[47:37] come out of that con spiritual condition
[47:40] and come to the fullness of the word of
[47:44] god
[47:44] and may god bless you for in the midst
[47:48] of
[47:49] smyrna in the midst of the eater
[47:54] in the midst of the bitterness of smyrna
[47:57] god can give you meat and god
[48:01] can give you sweetness come and receive
[48:04] it
[48:05] in the name of our lord jesus christ may
[48:08] the
[48:09] lord bless you and keep you
[48:12] in the midst of our chaotic age
[48:15] you can come to christ and receive him
[48:19] into your heart
[48:20] say lord forgive me
[48:23] cleanse me of my unbelief wash me from
[48:27] my sin
[48:29] and i commit myself to you
[48:32] as a child of the king may god bless you
[48:37] until we meet again
