[37:44] that may be
[37:45] uh out uh on their vacations wherever
[37:48] that may be in this stressful and
[37:51] chaotic
[37:53] system and society in which we live
[37:56] we do need some time to let off the
[37:59] physical pressures
[38:01] and the mental pressures of life praise
[38:05] god the inward man he doesn't take any
[38:08] pressure because that just rolls off of
[38:10] him like
[38:12] water from a duck's back
[38:14] because he has his blessed assurance
[38:17] already he has his anchor already he has
[38:20] already entered into the rest and so he
[38:24] is rested in god hallelujah knowing that
[38:27] whatever happens on the outside
[38:30] god is working things out
[38:34] you may not see it right away but god is
[38:36] working things out
[38:39] everything is going to work out to his
[38:41] will
[38:44] as long as we let go and surrender and
[38:47] let him have his way
[38:48] the days of fighting fussing and
[38:50] threatening is over
[38:52] it's now to rest in the face of our
[38:55] living god may the lord richly bless you
[38:58] thank you all so much praise god unless
[39:00] you feel led somebody with a a solo or
[39:03] something or you know whether it's music
[39:06] musician solo or something i don't know
[39:08] praise the lord amen god bless you i
[39:12] don't mean to put you all on a spot but
[39:14] i wanted to highlight you that we
[39:16] appreciate very much everything that
[39:18] they're doing
[39:20] we thank god
[39:21] uh i thank god
[39:25] before i saw this before i saw the signs
[39:29] in the worship leader
[39:31] i was
[39:33] praying in there and just thinking
[39:35] how i can see the spiritual growth in
[39:38] the brothers life
[39:40] and then then the holy spirit showed
[39:42] some manifestation of it not just
[39:44] because of the emotion
[39:46] but he's seeing something clearer amen
[39:49] he's seeing something brighter and
[39:51] because of that he's experiencing the
[39:54] growth of the holy spirit moving in his
[39:57] heart praise the lord amen may god bless
[40:00] every one of you as you come up in the
[40:03] grace of almighty god because
[40:06] it's a great
[40:08] thing happening praise god
[40:11] i don't think even
[40:13] you
[40:14] fully grasp the whiteness of it i don't
[40:18] grasp all the whiteness of it even
[40:20] though i may have a wider
[40:22] insight or understanding
[40:24] but what uh the holy spirit is not
[40:28] trying to do what he is doing
[40:30] uh right now
[40:32] is trying to change our minds and our
[40:35] hearts
[40:36] from the years and years of system
[40:42] systems
[40:44] and and what they have placed in us
[40:46] to come out of that
[40:48] and walk in the liberty of jesus christ
[40:52] without being fearful
[40:54] or wondering because we come to rest on
[40:57] systems
[40:58] right
[41:00] and even in churches messes groups
[41:03] everybody there
[41:04] they got to have everything apparently
[41:07] to the eyes and mind in place and
[41:10] everything has to be
[41:12] like that now you've got to have that to
[41:14] survive in the world in which we live
[41:18] well when we come to god's the sons and
[41:21] daughters of god
[41:22] are led by the spirit of god
[41:25] and uh the spirit
[41:27] blows like the wind wherever it wants to
[41:30] go
[41:32] that's when it's out of your hand
[41:34] but he has a system and he knows no
[41:37] matter how it looks to you and how he's
[41:39] blowing you around or moving you don't
[41:41] worry about that
[41:43] he knows exactly where this part of the
[41:46] jigsaw plus is going to fit where that's
[41:48] going to fit where that's going to fit
[41:50] this might look like an odd piece but
[41:53] it's going to fit
[41:54] and when it all comes out to the end is
[41:58] christ being revealed in his own word
[42:02] so rest in him have confidence in him
[42:06] walk in faith praise god we have moved
[42:10] away from the uh from the
[42:13] lamb and we're moving into the anointing
[42:15] of the great lion of the tribe of judah
[42:19] judgment is coming praise god first it
[42:22] was salvation redemption and that sort
[42:25] of thing but it's moving away right into
[42:29] the of the judgments of god and and the
[42:32] anointing of the great lion of the tribe
[42:34] of judah praise god so we are resting on
[42:38] that and trusting god that he will
[42:40] fulfill his word through us for this
[42:43] hour as we
[42:46] live to fulfill the rest of all
[42:48] righteousness all the word uh to be
[42:51] fulfilled praise god forevermore may the
[42:54] lord bless you as we wanna uh by god's
[42:58] grace talk on a simple topic apparently
[43:01] simple topic that says
[43:03] the life
[43:05] that pleases god
[43:08] the life that pleases god
[43:10] and our scripture
[43:13] uh let me see here where we place that
[43:17] praise the lord is right in the bible
[43:18] here anyway
[43:21] it's uh hebrews 11
[43:25] reading from verses 5
[43:29] to
[43:32] 6.
[43:42] shall we read together yours is up you
[43:45] can read it everyone can see it praise
[43:48] the lord
[43:49] hallelujah
[43:52] by faith enoch
[43:56] was translated
[43:58] he was changed
[44:01] a translation is not an
[44:04] instant thing but
[44:06] he was being changed as he walked with
[44:09] god
[44:10] that he should not see death
[44:13] praise the lord
[44:15] and was not found
[44:18] because god
[44:21] had translated him
[44:24] for before his translation
[44:28] he had this testimony
[44:31] that he pleased god
[44:35] but without faith
[44:38] it is impossible to please him
[44:41] for he that cometh to god must believe
[44:44] that he is
[44:45] and that he is a rewarder of them
[44:48] that diligently
[44:50] seek him praise the lord god bless us as
[44:54] we meditate on these things father we
[44:56] just read from your word out of hebrews
[44:59] 11. and we just want to ask you if you
[45:02] will just
[45:04] grant us grace
[45:06] that both speaker and hearer will come
[45:09] into oneness
[45:10] and that the precious words of god
[45:13] will just begin to flow
[45:16] the great ever-present waters from the
[45:19] rock will begin to flow out upon us
[45:23] oh god and keep us refresh us as we live
[45:28] by the uh oh god the rivers of living
[45:31] waters and to you be all praise honor
[45:34] and glory in the name of jesus christ
[45:36] amen and amen the life that pleases god
[45:40] plea please be seated
[45:42] now even if you hear things that you've
[45:44] heard before
[45:46] god has this way of doing things and
[45:48] every teacher knows that in doing things
[45:51] that a repetition even if you read the
[45:54] scriptures you will find
[45:56] even the story like of
[45:58] solomon or david or this one it repeats
[46:01] in the bible uh what he tells them in
[46:04] exodus you hear the new
[46:06] numbers and you hear it in deuteronomy
[46:08] and you know
[46:10] it does he's doing that because he
[46:12] always says don't let these things
[46:16] you know go from your ears don't let it
[46:18] go away from your generations don't let
[46:21] it see what he's trying to do is that he
[46:24] will have the word not past but but but
[46:27] that the word will abide in you
[46:30] right it won't leave you and it will be
[46:32] there
[46:33] and pass from your conscience to your
[46:35] subconscious
[46:37] and then you're moving into another
[46:39] dimension where it's effortless no more
[46:43] fighting working or
[46:45] having to wonder how things are going to
[46:48] be praise the lord so i'm going to
[46:51] go to wisdom versus space
[46:54] and we're going to
[46:56] take our i'm going to try to take my
[46:58] time
[47:02] in the beginning
[47:04] was the word
[47:07] and the word
[47:09] was with god
[47:12] and the word
[47:14] that was with god was god
[47:19] i'm quoting all of this that i just said
[47:22] is quoting that's not the bible i'm
[47:24] reading out of but that's just a quote
[47:28] continuing
[47:29] the that word
[47:32] was in god
[47:35] and
[47:36] it was god
[47:40] it was his thoughts
[47:43] that was in him
[47:45] and they were there always
[47:49] god's thoughts then is as eternal as he
[47:54] is eternal
[47:57] oh my he says that ain't no skim milk
[48:02] that ain't no soup made with the shadow
[48:04] of a skinny chicken
[48:06] [Laughter]
[48:08] oh my
[48:10] now he says here it comes now
[48:12] listen
[48:14] are you ready for this
[48:16] now remember
[48:18] them thoughts god's thoughts
[48:21] was his word
[48:25] now
[48:26] it says in the beginning
[48:30] now
[48:31] when i say in the beginning
[48:35] in eternity now
[48:38] how could that
[48:39] come together
[48:41] in the beginning then he says yes in
[48:44] eternity now
[48:47] wow now think about it
[48:50] see
[48:51] he says
[48:52] when the beginning first started
[48:56] now what he's talking about here again
[48:58] now i'm speaking by the holy spirit that
[49:03] eternity
[49:04] he's talking about in the beginning when
[49:06] time started
[49:09] that's what he's called in the beginning
[49:11] there
[49:12] when time started because there had to
[49:14] be a
[49:15] time of time
[49:16] or place where time begins to count
[49:21] and it started right so time started
[49:25] back in eternity it's not eternal but it
[49:28] started there in eternity in the
[49:32] beginning
[49:34] when it first started
[49:37] then he says time
[49:40] then he goes back to so you see in the
[49:43] beginning
[49:44] and if i might put this
[49:46] when time started
[49:48] amen
[49:50] was the word
[49:52] the thoughts already become words from
[49:55] right then back there right now god's
[49:59] thoughts
[50:00] this is what he says right after
[50:02] and the word was with god do you have
[50:05] the quote that you can put it up
[50:08] uh praise god i know you love what
[50:10] you're hearing but let's be awake and
[50:14] recognize so that
[50:15] they can follow this
[50:17] clearly amen
[50:20] see
[50:21] and the word was with god and that word
[50:24] was god
[50:27] his thoughts
[50:29] he wants to make sure that everybody
[50:31] those people at that time recognize of
[50:34] course we know most of them didn't
[50:35] recognize
[50:37] but he says them thoughts
[50:39] was god for his thoughts is what he was
[50:44] praise the lord
[50:47] and
[50:49] this is it you are them thoughts
[50:53] praise the lord
[50:55] he says it's right here wisdom versus
[50:57] faith and you are them thoughts
[51:01] that was in god
[51:03] before the beginning
[51:05] that was in him
[51:07] and with him
[51:08] and
[51:09] the lord was with god and the word was
[51:14] god
[51:15] hallelujah of course we know all the
[51:19] word was in one man at one time named
[51:22] jesus christ hallelujah but now god true
[51:25] ages have brought it down taken away
[51:29] from the rib part of the word itself and
[51:32] out of that part of the
[51:35] has created a world bride through seven
[51:39] ages until she has now come to the
[51:42] fullness of her stature
[51:43] and she's taking her stand upon the word
[51:47] of god
[51:48] and recognizing that the ward is her
[51:51] headship
[51:53] her husband
[51:55] or the one who has leadership and
[51:58] preeminence
[51:59] over her life oh thank god for you thank
[52:03] god for me
[52:04] thank god for a people anywhere and
[52:07] everywhere that not just says these
[52:10] things but has a clear inward revelation
[52:14] of what has happened what is happening
[52:18] praise god and can receive it with a
[52:20] thankful and gracious heart unto god
[52:25] amen
[52:26] she
[52:28] and
[52:29] them thoughts is what he was
[52:33] and
[52:34] you are them thoughts
[52:37] that's you too
[52:40] see
[52:41] and god's thoughts rem and your peace
[52:44] says repeat and god's thoughts
[52:48] was his word
[52:50] and that word was with him
[52:54] and
[52:55] that word was in him
[52:58] and it was all god
[53:02] praise god hallelujah no matter how the
[53:05] word and more fed itself down to one man
[53:09] and then to a many member body all
[53:11] through the whole process from god to
[53:14] one man through melchizedek coming down
[53:17] there starting to end more faith from
[53:20] melchizedek and the divine condescension
[53:22] down to jesus christ emmanuel and then
[53:26] down to a bride amen hallelujah
[53:30] in other words he's saying no
[53:32] way along this process did god stop or
[53:37] cease to be god
[53:39] but it was god and is god all the way
[53:43] through
[53:45] that's why he kept saying you don't
[53:47] really recognize who you really are you
[53:50] don't realize what's really happening
[53:53] why why do you feel so ordinary about it
[53:56] because you are that
[53:58] right it's like me telling you do you
[53:59] know that you are you
[54:01] you understand which is what i'm telling
[54:03] you now that's why it seems just
[54:05] ordinary i'm telling danny that he's
[54:07] danny
[54:08] so so what about that i'm telling you
[54:11] that you were in god but you see
[54:14] when you recognize the enormity of it
[54:16] when you get in the quietness and you
[54:18] begin to think of it and what god
[54:21] has done and what he is doing and why
[54:24] you are in this world available
[54:26] to him
[54:28] for him to fulfill his divine purpose
[54:32] and use whenever he wants to there are
[54:35] some prophets in the bible the name
[54:37] isn't mentioned
[54:38] a certain man of god went here certain
[54:41] man of god went there and you never hear
[54:43] of them again even if it's one time in
[54:45] your entire life god wants to use you
[54:47] for one one thing and after that nothing
[54:51] that's his purpose fulfilled and you
[54:53] need to just walk with confidence
[54:55] praising god giving glory because you've
[54:57] done what you're supposed to do
[54:59] another one might god might put him in a
[55:02] place like isaiah or jeremiah make them
[55:04] prominent make them recognizable and
[55:06] stuff like that in their name coming up
[55:08] often and often praise god that's
[55:11] because that's what he's got
[55:13] predestinated on purpose for that
[55:15] that individual that word amen praise
[55:19] god so don't worry about it because
[55:21] god's all god's words are one
[55:25] as i've always said whether he wants to
[55:28] use this word in the morning this one
[55:29] midday and one in the evening light
[55:32] praise god it's the same salvation
[55:36] the apostle paul doesn't have a bigger
[55:38] salvation than you have
[55:41] nobody in the bible will have a larger
[55:44] salvation and you have larger eternal
[55:47] life because we all get the same pay
[55:52] regardless how much work we do we all
[55:55] get the same pay
[55:57] so what i'm getting away from you is any
[55:59] complex don't let the devil knock you
[56:01] with any complex oh you don't know the
[56:03] bible oh you don't know all of the
[56:05] message oh i didn't know that quote i
[56:08] look so bad i didn't know this god
[56:11] didn't ask you what you know he asked
[56:13] you who you believe amen that's what he
[56:16] wants to know who do you believe the
[56:18] word of god regardless of who you are
[56:21] where you come from if you are one of
[56:24] them raise your hands praise the lord
[56:27] give glory and praise and honor let us
[56:30] adore him
[56:31] let us adore him christ the lord amen
[56:35] lord of god amen oh my yes sir
[56:40] oh my praise god now then
[56:45] god
[56:47] can come down here
[56:50] and find eternal life
[56:54] by hearing
[56:55] his own word
[56:58] praise god
[56:59] understand
[57:01] god can come down here
[57:04] and recognize himself
[57:06] in you
[57:08] when you hear
[57:09] his own word
[57:11] it's not wonderful
[57:14] god hearing his own word
[57:17] praise the lord beautiful how beautiful
[57:20] to the true believer that you would not
[57:24] have i mean you had heard words words
[57:26] words
[57:27] read all kinds of books and everything
[57:30] as well i love to read so
[57:32] and my father was a great reader and
[57:34] encouraged us to do a lot of reading
[57:36] from bhagavad gitas to sanskrit to this
[57:40] to that too
[57:42] all kinds of different things but you
[57:44] know
[57:45] not till
[57:46] the words of this prophet
[57:49] amen and
[57:51] we now know we're not talking about the
[57:53] words of the man william branham but
[57:56] we're talking about the words of the
[57:57] spirit that spoke through the prophet
[58:00] and that struck our souls that struck my
[58:04] soul
[58:05] and something in me could recognize
[58:08] that's not just a word of a man
[58:10] that them them revelations and truths
[58:13] that that man is speaking are so close
[58:14] close close one after the other quick
[58:16] quick quick there right there no human
[58:18] mind could orchestrate that or put that
[58:21] together that's got to be a higher mind
[58:24] that's going to be a greater mind and
[58:26] the only one that's greater is god
[58:28] himself hallelujah and i recognize right
[58:31] then
[58:32] that that's the voice of god speaking in
[58:35] this last day amen praise god and not
[58:39] knowing about all this stuff about
[58:41] profit and this and that right away
[58:44] inside i say my goodness i gotta let
[58:47] everything drop all bible college
[58:50] education drop
[58:52] not that you lose it and you don't
[58:54] remember it but that is not your
[58:56] priority and premier preminence anymore
[59:00] your priority and your preeminence is on
[59:02] the lord to obey the war to live by the
[59:06] lord hallelujah amen look education and
[59:09] wisdom and knowledge is important
[59:12] i don't want to like oh messages a lot
[59:14] of message preachers that kill
[59:17] incentive for education killing center
[59:20] for wisdom and knowledge and the prophet
[59:22] wasn't doing that either he was trying
[59:25] to tell you them things are good but but
[59:28] you've got to be like paul you got to be
[59:30] able to know when to just drop leave the
[59:33] other side and listen to the word
[59:36] because sometimes
[59:37] not sometimes most of the times the word
[59:40] will go beyond your intelligence because
[59:43] it's not speaking from this position is
[59:46] speaking from the position of him who
[59:48] sits high
[59:50] and looks down low one whose mind and
[59:53] thoughts are above our thoughts
[59:56] praise god so now and again he gives you
[59:58] a little idea he gives you a little
[1:00:00] revelation you know gives you a
[1:00:02] something there oh my i got something
[1:00:04] big yeah but it's something tiny to him
[1:00:06] it's it's nothing to him your thoughts
[1:00:09] are below my thoughts all your princes
[1:00:12] and your wifes man you put them in a
[1:00:13] bucket said they're just like a drop of
[1:00:15] water in a bucket
[1:00:17] see so that's the way it is just relax
[1:00:20] rely on him because he says don't think
[1:00:24] let me do the thinking for you praise
[1:00:26] the lord i don't mean you're going to
[1:00:28] walk around like a zombie i don't mean
[1:00:30] you're going to walk around like an
[1:00:32] empty-headed person but i'm just saying
[1:00:36] you've got to be able to come to a place
[1:00:39] when you're put in a corner by satan
[1:00:42] rejoice
[1:00:43] because now i i don't have to even think
[1:00:46] or
[1:00:46] you're going to start out by thinking
[1:00:48] and figuring and then you're going to
[1:00:49] find you can't go further and then you
[1:00:51] just relax and you let go and let god
[1:00:54] have his way and then something
[1:00:56] supernatural the father that dwelleth in
[1:00:58] me he'll do the talking he'll do the
[1:01:01] speaking he'll do work everything out
[1:01:04] for his glory and honor because it's not
[1:01:06] of me or from me it's just going through
[1:01:09] me praise god and i'm resting on that by
[1:01:12] the grace of god
[1:01:13] hallelujah i don't know about you but
[1:01:15] something got a hold of me
[1:01:19] amen
[1:01:20] oh my praise god hallelujah
[1:01:24] so
[1:01:25] now we understand why we can see clearly
[1:01:27] now
[1:01:29] amen because it's god in us
[1:01:33] hearing his own word
[1:01:36] and that takes us out the
[1:01:38] spiritual amnesia
[1:01:40] is that right
[1:01:42] because he is hearing his own word which
[1:01:44] already was heard from before the
[1:01:47] foundation of the world
[1:01:49] and this is why wednesday night i
[1:01:51] mentioned about our last sunday that is
[1:01:54] why abraham could recognize
[1:01:57] because
[1:01:58] he hadn't seen the person but he heard
[1:02:00] the voice they called him and said come
[1:02:02] out and go to this so when the voice now
[1:02:05] changed to a melchizedek position in a
[1:02:07] human inner body wasn't yet a
[1:02:10] human but it was theophonic body and uh
[1:02:14] he spoke to him spoke to abraham and the
[1:02:16] moment he heard the voice coming out
[1:02:19] there not melchizedek how he looked on
[1:02:21] his form and shape but he recognized the
[1:02:24] voice
[1:02:25] that the same one that called him is the
[1:02:27] same one that's speaking to him
[1:02:30] amen and he was able to surrender right
[1:02:33] away though the bible will show you he
[1:02:34] said my lord that means he recognized he
[1:02:37] recognized who that was right away amen
[1:02:40] that was that was the king of kings
[1:02:42] king of salem king of peace king of
[1:02:44] righteousness king god he knew it all
[1:02:47] and he recognized who melchizedek was
[1:02:51] amen praise god now in the beginning
[1:02:55] was the word he's going all back over
[1:02:58] this thing again
[1:02:59] it was the word and the word don't let
[1:03:03] don't forget he doesn't want us to
[1:03:05] forget that or not recognize it and
[1:03:08] remember the word was god
[1:03:12] hallelujah
[1:03:14] and that word was made flesh
[1:03:18] i i'm going to take a pause here
[1:03:21] there was a man that was very weird to a
[1:03:24] lot of people
[1:03:26] uh
[1:03:28] he used to be called they used to call
[1:03:30] him father divine
[1:03:34] and he used to be saying a strange thing
[1:03:38] that god is in me and i am god
[1:03:42] but you see a lot of people didn't
[1:03:44] recognize fully what he was saying when
[1:03:45] they start flocking around him and
[1:03:48] trying to worship him
[1:03:50] but that man
[1:03:53] signs wonders miracles all kinds of
[1:03:56] things they even locked him up in a jail
[1:03:58] for saying that
[1:04:00] and when they go into the security
[1:04:03] prison all locked up
[1:04:05] he had a grand piano and he was playing
[1:04:07] his music
[1:04:09] and there was a big table with all kind
[1:04:11] of feasts on it and he was eaten from it
[1:04:14] and it was real food because they go in
[1:04:16] they want to know how he get all this
[1:04:18] stuff in there
[1:04:19] see they couldn't believe but brother
[1:04:22] brother mentioned his name too not that
[1:04:24] he want to go and uh
[1:04:27] highlight this guy but he mentioned his
[1:04:30] name one time
[1:04:32] right
[1:04:33] uh how god with this man at that
[1:04:35] particular time because that's what he
[1:04:38] believed even if you have it in a
[1:04:40] twisted up messed up way but he was on
[1:04:43] the right road and those things were
[1:04:46] beginning to happen with him but i want
[1:04:49] you to say
[1:04:51] i want you to recognize there is a
[1:04:53] reality to this this is not some
[1:04:55] mythical thing we're talking about
[1:04:59] we are not talking about some mythical
[1:05:01] thing we're talking about the
[1:05:04] unfailing reality
[1:05:07] of the living god
[1:05:09] satan tries to get you to believe
[1:05:11] because you don't see god it could be a
[1:05:13] myth it could be a dream you maybe you
[1:05:15] had a dream or a vision or maybe you had
[1:05:18] a good thought last night or uh you know
[1:05:21] the preacher is just suggesting some
[1:05:23] some imagination imaginary thing to you
[1:05:26] but the prophet made it clear no
[1:05:29] when you recognize this rest on it it's
[1:05:32] the unfailing reality of the living god
[1:05:35] moving in your midst praise god
[1:05:38] forevermore hallelujah
[1:05:40] amen
[1:05:41] see that word was god
[1:05:44] and you see that same word
[1:05:47] was made flesh do you believe that
[1:05:52] that same word was made flesh if you
[1:05:56] want to run it in your mind it was made
[1:05:58] flesh in jesus christ and now
[1:06:02] hallelujah and now

[1:08:06] you are in god
[1:08:09] hallelujah
[1:08:10] and by god himself also being in you
[1:08:15] you are in him
[1:08:17] and he is in you
[1:08:18] and that's jesus talked about that in
[1:08:20] that day you're gonna know i'm in the
[1:08:22] father the father in me i and you and
[1:08:24] you and me praise god see you will begin
[1:08:26] to recognize that hallelujah that you're
[1:08:29] not just believing in a god that's
[1:08:31] outside of you
[1:08:33] but god is in you
[1:08:36] and greater is he that is in you than he
[1:08:40] that is in the world
[1:08:42] hallelujah there you are
[1:08:45] oh my praise god yes sir you see
[1:08:50] you are now god's expressed thoughts
[1:08:56] praise the lord
[1:08:58] he says
[1:09:01] my
[1:09:04] and then thoughts don't listen to any
[1:09:06] reasonings
[1:09:08] oh my my my
[1:09:11] oh my god why would they listen to the
[1:09:13] reasonings they are the word
[1:09:16] you can say in other words let's go back
[1:09:18] and show you what i'm talking about when
[1:09:21] jesus was up on a mountain in the
[1:09:23] mountain temptation
[1:09:24] and satan come to him and tell him
[1:09:28] commit suicide
[1:09:30] cast yourself off this mountain
[1:09:32] and because it's written in the
[1:09:33] scriptures you know
[1:09:35] and you'll bear you up if you let the
[1:09:36] dash yourself against the the stone
[1:09:40] that's that is just as much as if saying
[1:09:42] the bible says if you drink any deadly
[1:09:44] thing you shall not hurt you so drink
[1:09:45] this bottle of of poison here and god
[1:09:48] promised that you're going to be healed
[1:09:51] you see that's a lot of mis things among
[1:09:54] so-called believers they they're it's
[1:09:56] yes that's the written word you're
[1:09:58] reading it there but it's not the
[1:10:00] revealed word
[1:10:02] you don't understand what god is telling
[1:10:04] you amen so here it is we find friends
[1:10:08] that this god
[1:10:10] uh who has expressed thoughts and they
[1:10:14] don't have to listen to no reason
[1:10:16] because they are the very word
[1:10:18] themselves revealed
[1:10:21] or manifested or expressed so why would
[1:10:24] they listen to the reasonings of man and
[1:10:26] even if they do it's because of patience
[1:10:29] and temperance
[1:10:31] they listen
[1:10:32] and then when they're done they'll speak
[1:10:35] one word or two words or speak whatever
[1:10:37] father puts in their mouth
[1:10:39] and it settles it all
[1:10:41] is that right
[1:10:42] amen
[1:10:44] praise god they don't take in reasonings
[1:10:47] of man
[1:10:48] amen
[1:10:49] and that's because they know they're a
[1:10:51] part of god
[1:10:53] hallelujah and reasonings can't prevail
[1:10:56] against the holy spirit
[1:10:58] re he's already overcome reasonings can
[1:11:01] prevail against the living word that's
[1:11:04] in the true believer praise the name of
[1:11:07] the lord hallelujah amen hallelujah so
[1:11:11] my god i'm so thankful that i am a part
[1:11:13] of the word amen and that i was in him
[1:11:17] before the beginning
[1:11:19] at the beginning and after the beginning
[1:11:21] i was with him all the time you were
[1:11:25] with him and in him all the time praise
[1:11:28] be to god hallelujah amen and so
[1:11:32] we are as uh we say i am going through
[1:11:35] i'm going through doesn't matter what
[1:11:38] others do i am going through
[1:11:40] praise the lord oh my there are many
[1:11:43] start in the race hallelujah but with
[1:11:46] all the pressures all the problems
[1:11:48] refuse to keep peace amen others accept
[1:11:52] it when this message appeared to be like
[1:11:55] no
[1:11:56] here's something new something
[1:11:58] attractive it's fresh you know it's a
[1:12:00] fresh blood or flower come out and the
[1:12:02] butterflies are flying around but after
[1:12:04] a while the days start to get hot
[1:12:07] it get ordinary the message feels like
[1:12:10] uh the dry bread that was in the
[1:12:12] wilderness well we've been eating this
[1:12:14] dry bread that was supernatural bread
[1:12:16] you know coming down every night but
[1:12:18] it's start to get ordinary
[1:12:20] we want this dry bread anymore we we
[1:12:23] want to get them them kind of uh things
[1:12:26] we used to have in pentecost we want to
[1:12:29] have onions and we want to have a leek
[1:12:32] and garlic and all these spicy things
[1:12:35] that will spice up the service and spice
[1:12:38] up the song service and spice up
[1:12:41] everything and oh my so they don't
[1:12:44] realize they want to satisfy the flesh
[1:12:48] and you know not that your flesh
[1:12:50] shouldn't get enjoyment in the house of
[1:12:52] god but we're not here to satisfy the
[1:12:54] flesh we are here to crucify the flesh
[1:12:56] and let the spirit of god live within us
[1:12:59] we we're here to sacrifice that and let
[1:13:01] the spirit of god live within us and he
[1:13:04] receives all the praise and the honor
[1:13:07] and the glory praise god hallelujah amen
[1:13:12] hallelujah how thankful we are that by
[1:13:15] hearing
[1:13:16] these
[1:13:17] things these revelations
[1:13:20] we are enabled to express god's life
[1:13:24] you see because formally
[1:13:26] or
[1:13:27] formerly
[1:13:29] the
[1:13:30] germ life or the gene of god
[1:13:33] that was in us
[1:13:35] could not
[1:13:37] express itself
[1:13:40] uh it could not express itself at all
[1:13:42] and in some cases it couldn't express
[1:13:44] itself fully uh because
[1:13:48] we are allowing
[1:13:49] the flesh
[1:13:51] was preeminent
[1:13:53] over it
[1:13:54] and the preempt the desires of the flesh
[1:13:57] in other words our desires was not so
[1:13:59] much for the word as for the things that
[1:14:02] were out there amen it was there because
[1:14:05] that's what society put for us you got
[1:14:07] to achieve this your ambition for that
[1:14:09] you got to have this you got to climb to
[1:14:11] this height you got to do that you got
[1:14:12] to do this you got to do that and then
[1:14:14] the focus is lost amen it's not
[1:14:17] intentional it's not wickedness but it's
[1:14:19] just off of the plan of god has for us
[1:14:22] amen and so the gene was suppressed or
[1:14:26] oppressed or let's put it this way the
[1:14:28] the the gene was imprisoned
[1:14:32] in these prison
[1:14:33] of flesh and bars of bone and and and
[1:14:37] bound in there amen
[1:14:39] like that praise god hallelujah amen but
[1:14:43] by
[1:14:44] the new work that we have received
[1:14:46] hallelujah amen
[1:14:48] by the revelation of the lord
[1:14:53] the revelation of the word opened the
[1:14:55] prison bars
[1:14:57] amen and set us free
[1:15:00] the same bright light that appeared in
[1:15:02] the prison where tall walls and prison
[1:15:06] doors open one night it's that same
[1:15:09] light that has come back to open up the
[1:15:11] prison doors of the mind and heart
[1:15:14] hallelujah and set you free amen that
[1:15:17] you can have boneless expression
[1:15:19] boneless freedom in the grace of god
[1:15:22] hallelujah
[1:15:24] now you'll come even more creative than
[1:15:26] you think you were before even naturally
[1:15:29] you become more creative because this is
[1:15:32] secondary but you're going at such a
[1:15:34] height that these other things are
[1:15:36] simply going to just happen around you
[1:15:38] amen and you don't even know why they're
[1:15:40] happening but it's all happening praise
[1:15:42] god you become more because we are after
[1:15:45] his kind right
[1:15:46] and he's a creator he is the creator so
[1:15:49] you can't help being creative you can
[1:15:52] help by having understanding of certain
[1:15:55] matters and things like that it's not by
[1:15:57] uh
[1:15:58] my brain's trust what is my my trust in
[1:16:01] him that we are able to do these things
[1:16:04] by his grace praise the name of the lord
[1:16:07] god hallelujah amen praise god thank god
[1:16:11] that god's attributes are now free
[1:16:15] i say thank god i am free
[1:16:19] say it
[1:16:20] i want you to say it verbalize it
[1:16:23] vocalize it thank god i am free
[1:16:28] say thank god i am free
[1:16:32] amen praise god hallelujah
[1:16:37] [Applause]
[1:16:42] now we step over to the future home of
[1:16:44] the heavenly bride
[1:16:45] and ortly bride praise god
[1:16:49] now
[1:16:50] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:16:52] was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:16:55] see
[1:16:56] that's three stages
[1:16:59] of the same word
[1:17:01] amen three stages right you know we
[1:17:04] talked a little bit that would come down
[1:17:06] from god to jesus and then
[1:17:09] warfare right on down to jesus and now
[1:17:11] it comes down into the bright three
[1:17:13] stages of the same word
[1:17:15] amen praise god
[1:17:17] see
[1:17:18] oh my just think of it
[1:17:20] there he was god
[1:17:23] but that word it was an attribute first
[1:17:28] hallelujah
[1:17:29] in him was and was god
[1:17:33] it was god
[1:17:35] and when he talked of himself
[1:17:40] he thought of himself becoming human
[1:17:44] so the stages of it there you go god
[1:17:48] attribute down flesh come down to be
[1:17:52] human here on the face of the earth you
[1:17:57] understand now why i didn't want to
[1:17:58] speed up i don't want to really like
[1:18:01] preach preach preach but just so that
[1:18:03] you
[1:18:04] get it amen praise the lord hallelujah
[1:18:08] now at one time we know all them
[1:18:10] thoughts
[1:18:12] came down here and was gathered up in
[1:18:15] one human being
[1:18:17] whose name was jesus christ
[1:18:20] and that is why the bible tells us
[1:18:23] that in him was all of the god head
[1:18:29] bodily
[1:18:31] right
[1:18:32] all
[1:18:33] all them thoughts all them words all of
[1:18:36] that
[1:18:37] was in him
[1:18:39] bodily
[1:18:40] praise the lord just like all my
[1:18:43] father's generations or it was all in
[1:18:46] him
[1:18:47] bodily
[1:18:49] until the time came for them to be
[1:18:50] expressed
[1:18:52] it's upright praise the name of the lord
[1:18:54] hallelujah amen
[1:18:56] so then
[1:18:58] we find out what we have now is god
[1:19:00] expressing himself
[1:19:02] in human flesh praise the lord amen
[1:19:06] and so jesus was chosen
[1:19:09] uh to be the body because you know jesus
[1:19:13] jesus not jesus christ
[1:19:16] but jesus the man
[1:19:20] he
[1:19:21] was not eternal
[1:19:24] see
[1:19:25] he was a man like you and me
[1:19:29] but he was a god man
[1:19:32] because god in him
[1:19:34] is eternal
[1:19:36] and that god that was in him said even
[1:19:38] if you kill this body i raise it up in
[1:19:40] three days
[1:19:41] praise god raise it up in three days
[1:19:43] praise god your body is not eternal
[1:19:47] but you still have a resurrection
[1:19:50] you still have the holy spirit and you
[1:19:52] doing the same thing the first seed did
[1:19:54] but for god's glory amen praise the name
[1:19:57] of the lord hallelujah amen so uh he
[1:20:01] planted himself in the ground not to go
[1:20:03] for all of that he said i'm the seed and
[1:20:05] the seed goes in the ground they come
[1:20:06] another thousand fold and and so on like
[1:20:09] that so and when it comes back up a
[1:20:11] thousand fold a lot of people are still
[1:20:14] looking at the original seed back there
[1:20:16] and that's what they're doing
[1:20:18] they're looking at jesus back there
[1:20:21] with without form without comeliness
[1:20:24] and they're missing him
[1:20:26] same yesterday today and forever
[1:20:29] appearing amongst human beings again
[1:20:32] because the sun is up
[1:20:34] the seeds are being dermatized
[1:20:37] and they are up now they're growing and
[1:20:40] it's him again expressing himself true
[1:20:43] human beings but not in one body
[1:20:47] in a
[1:20:48] many-membered body called the bride
[1:20:52] and she and him
[1:20:54] are the same material
[1:20:57] for god did not take another piece of
[1:20:59] ground but god took a part of him
[1:21:04] to make her
[1:21:06] illustrating that that's what he did in
[1:21:08] heaven he didn't find some other
[1:21:10] material somewhere else but he took a
[1:21:13] part of himself
[1:21:15] and put that in us
[1:21:18] that you would have a portion a part of
[1:21:21] god hallelujah you have a an ingredient
[1:21:24] in you that you can't even explain what
[1:21:27] it is you don't even you just know that
[1:21:29] god is in me praise god
[1:21:32] hallelujah amen god and me
[1:21:36] i love him and he loves me he talks to
[1:21:39] me i'm
[1:21:40] i talk to him and he talks to me the two
[1:21:42] of us
[1:21:43] my god in me oh thank god i'm so happy
[1:21:47] for god in me greater is he that is in
[1:21:50] me than he that is in the world

[1:38:26] the
[1:38:29] and the blood
[1:38:30] is in the blood
[1:38:31] and the devil in other words the dead
[1:38:33] angel sees the life of christ projecting
[1:38:36] through the believer
[1:38:38] and when i see the blood i'll pass over
[1:38:41] you
[1:38:43] but i see that life over in you if i
[1:38:46] pass right over you amen that life is
[1:38:49] blameless that life is perfect that life
[1:38:51] is without spot without wrinkle i'm

[1:38:56] praise god the blood is on the doorpost
[1:38:59] the life is in there amen and he'll pass
[1:39:02] right over you that's the reason why you
[1:39:04] are not uh he delivered and believeth on

[1:39:08] flesh yet he lives

[1:39:14] because i'm eternal you eternal
[1:39:17] amen praise god hallelujah how wonderful
[1:39:21] to know praise god hallelujah that that
[1:39:25] wonderful word has woke us up
[1:39:29] by revelation out of our spiritual
[1:39:33] amnesia
[1:39:35] and we have started
[1:39:37] to remember
[1:39:39] who we really are
[1:39:41] where we come from
[1:39:43] who your real father is
[1:39:46] natural father natural mother god use
[1:39:48] them to bring a physical body here but
[1:39:50] you
[1:39:52] the person that's there you back there
[1:39:54] who is your real father oh
[1:39:57] the prophet said oh uh when the great
[1:40:00] revelation struck him he says now i
[1:40:03] realize oh i am not just the child of
[1:40:07] charles and elibranum oh great jehovah i
[1:40:11] come to thee amen praise god then the
[1:40:14] bible became a new bible
[1:40:17] praise god because now he looked from
[1:40:20] the eyes of a man where he's got to do
[1:40:22] this that that but now he's looking at
[1:40:24] it from the eyes of god
[1:40:27] god in him
[1:40:29] looking back at the written word
[1:40:32] god in him hearing his own word and he
[1:40:35] knows which whether is his word or is
[1:40:37] not his word that he's hearing you know
[1:40:40] if it's mixed up if it's hybrid or
[1:40:41] whatever he'll know it that's why he
[1:40:42] said just a minute or two minutes like
[1:40:45] that the true believer when they
[1:40:47] recognize
[1:40:48] he says no more you cannot deceive them
[1:40:52] the elect will never and can't be
[1:40:54] deceived
[1:40:56] right because they are that word and
[1:40:59] they recognize the word the deep will
[1:41:01] always call back to the deep and the
[1:41:03] deep will have to respond
[1:41:05] praise god forevermore blessed be his
[1:41:08] name amen oh praise god
[1:41:11] that that uh
[1:41:13] wonderful effects of revelation puts you
[1:41:16] into the realm of perfect realization
[1:41:20] puts you in the realm of perfect love
[1:41:23] amen gives you all the perfections of
[1:41:27] jesus christ and of course you are there
[1:41:30] with perfect faith glory to god
[1:41:33] hallelujah amen but
[1:41:36] we have moved on to the realms
[1:41:38] where oh you let down your dress
[1:41:42] you start wearing a more regular pants
[1:41:44] rather than tight skinny pants that is
[1:41:48] you know
[1:41:49] they last the scene just pull everything
[1:41:51] close together and then you're walking
[1:41:54] around driving around the place like
[1:41:56] that no
[1:41:58] something in you already speaking to you
[1:42:00] and telling you
[1:42:02] that's not right
[1:42:04] that's not appropriate
[1:42:06] you shouldn't do that that's more
[1:42:07] powerful than the pastor coming on
[1:42:09] preaching a hellfire sermon off the
[1:42:11] pulpit
[1:42:12] is that right now scorch your hide and
[1:42:15] blast you to bits and you drop you
[1:42:19] you know there's a time for that
[1:42:22] because then the man got a blast rocks
[1:42:24] and everything from around you before
[1:42:26] you can get to the real diamonds
[1:42:29] you see but we are not there now praise
[1:42:32] the lord
[1:42:33] we're not there anymore brother danny
[1:42:36] praise the lord we god give god grace
[1:42:39] and praise for that
[1:42:40] hallelujah uh and we are not just doing
[1:42:43] things because brother branham said it
[1:42:47] oh brother branham said that brother
[1:42:48] brandon said that that's fine
[1:42:52] that's okay
[1:42:54] and that serves its purpose
[1:42:57] my father said this my father said that
[1:42:59] my father told me this but even in
[1:43:01] natural life that while the child gets
[1:43:03] to a place now or praise god where
[1:43:07] everything kicks in
[1:43:09] and they begin to see things and get
[1:43:11] their own experiences praise god and so
[1:43:14] the maturity of the world begins to move
[1:43:17] hallelujah and the believers begin to
[1:43:20] see themselves in the mirror and
[1:43:21] recognize what god is telling them
[1:43:24] hallelujah amen it becomes just standard
[1:43:27] you you just it's just part of your
[1:43:29] whole makeup you don't have to be told
[1:43:31] this and told that that adult child
[1:43:34] knows what they got to do you have to
[1:43:36] tell them order them this that because
[1:43:38] the holy spirit now has taken control
[1:43:43] joshua has taken preeminence
[1:43:46] jesus has taken headship
[1:43:49] hallelujah
[1:43:51] and now the bride walks in submission to
[1:43:54] him
[1:43:55] the word
[1:43:57] written and living
[1:43:59] working with the word praise god
[1:44:02] hallelujah and so we know
[1:44:05] that jesus
[1:44:07] christ
[1:44:08] has produced
[1:44:11] the only person
[1:44:12] who has produced
[1:44:15] i shouldn't say that but i'll come back
[1:44:16] to that afterwards but the only person
[1:44:19] that produce that perfect life
[1:44:24] perfect life
[1:44:25] that pleases god
[1:44:27] for we know god said it over and over
[1:44:30] this is my beloved son in whom i'm well
[1:44:34] pleased
[1:44:36] pleased with the life that was operating
[1:44:38] and manifesting through him
[1:44:41] praise god so the life of jesus christ
[1:44:45] pleased god and pleases god and will
[1:44:48] continue to please god
[1:44:50] hallelujah and the devil knew that
[1:44:54] and that is why he tried to copy that
[1:44:57] life
[1:44:58] try to impersonate that life
[1:45:01] try to do it in all these different
[1:45:03] denominations
[1:45:05] amen
[1:45:06] different denominations
[1:45:08] just take that
[1:45:10] leave that praise god oh my he tried to
[1:45:13] take it on every level and to infiltrate
[1:45:17] a claim he is producing the life of
[1:45:20] christ
[1:45:22] man may think
[1:45:24] it's okay
[1:45:26] but god knows his own life
[1:45:29] and god knows what life it is that
[1:45:32] pleases him
[1:45:34] and god will not be deceived by any
[1:45:37] devil
[1:45:38] he didn't do it in heaven and he will
[1:45:41] not do it here on earth for the elect
[1:45:43] shall not be deceived
[1:45:46] hallelujah he's going to make all kind
[1:45:49] of trouble and everything else but he
[1:45:51] can't deal with it because that's why
[1:45:54] all hell is against this teaching
[1:45:58] amen because it can't penetrate the the
[1:46:01] seals on revelation
[1:46:04] he can't break into that
[1:46:07] because that's god communicating
[1:46:10] within himself
[1:46:12] is that right
[1:46:14] if i sit here and i communicate him
[1:46:15] within myself are you gonna know what
[1:46:18] what i'm thinking is that right and if i
[1:46:20] am part of him and he's communicating
[1:46:23] with me by the medium of revelation
[1:46:27] he is not using the power of the prince
[1:46:30] of the air he's not using radio he's not
[1:46:33] using television he's not using any of
[1:46:36] these arts digital arts that that's
[1:46:39] they're just breaking in and using the
[1:46:41] prince of the power of the air that's
[1:46:43] what they're doing but we are not
[1:46:45] dealing with that we are dealing with
[1:46:47] the power of the world
[1:46:49] where god can communicate with his
[1:46:51] children by the
[1:46:52] essence of revelation
[1:46:56] and god speaks he's speaking actually to
[1:46:59] himself see because we often go up when
[1:47:01] we talk like that we think like we're
[1:47:03] talking about two people
[1:47:04] we're talking about a billion people and
[1:47:06] god is communicating no he's doing it
[1:47:09] with himself
[1:47:11] so it's god talking to himself praise
[1:47:13] the lord oh so much right there you can
[1:47:16] think about it jesus on the cross this
[1:47:18] one that one i heard a voice here and
[1:47:21] then i see one in the water i want to
[1:47:22] know how many gods and all this is god
[1:47:25] talking to himself
[1:47:27] amen is this one part of himself
[1:47:29] expressed over there another one over
[1:47:31] there and he's talking to himself amen
[1:47:34] amen all are one in christ amen
[1:47:36] hallelujah amen so jesus already has
[1:47:40] produced a perfect life the perfect life
[1:47:45] and we all are witnesses to these things
[1:47:47] we've seen it
[1:47:49] we recognize it by the grace of god
[1:47:52] hallelujah amen and we know from that
[1:47:55] perfect light that he already has
[1:47:57] overcome
[1:47:59] praise the lord no matter what the devil
[1:48:01] did
[1:48:02] what you're coming in trying to tempt me
[1:48:04] everything you're trying to tell me
[1:48:06] about it belongs to me and ready
[1:48:08] so you're giving to me something i
[1:48:10] already got
[1:48:11] is that right
[1:48:13] it's the same with you and i if you
[1:48:15] really understand that
[1:48:17] they're never going to give you what you
[1:48:18] already have
[1:48:20] no you you refuse his entreaties and
[1:48:23] refuse his suggestions on your mind
[1:48:27] refuse them evil thoughts is going to
[1:48:29] throw at you amen that's what he's going
[1:48:32] to do but you got to reject them and
[1:48:34] receive the word
[1:48:36] up of the living god hallelujah so stay
[1:48:40] in that dimension of the word now let's
[1:48:42] go to enoch amen now that is how enoch
[1:48:45] caught the revelation
[1:48:48] because i repeat again as with abel as
[1:48:51] with abraham as with all of them there
[1:48:53] was no written bible
[1:48:57] so revelation is not something new that
[1:49:00] we now make up
[1:49:02] or something we're trying to introduce
[1:49:05] no
[1:49:07] it's the same thing abel had that made
[1:49:10] him know what was the perfect sacrifice
[1:49:13] to offer
[1:49:14] it's the same thing abraham knew when
[1:49:18] the voice spoke to him
[1:49:20] there was no written bible for him to
[1:49:22] compare that people can go back let me
[1:49:25] see what you're saying whether that is
[1:49:27] the thing here let me go back here and
[1:49:28] uh there was nothing for them to compare
[1:49:31] with they had to have it by faith
[1:49:34] well james put it this way he says now
[1:49:36] we gotta believe because we
[1:49:38] in every one of us if we are
[1:49:41] elected true believers you have a
[1:49:43] witness
[1:49:45] within you
[1:49:46] and that witness in you
[1:49:48] is the word as the holy ghost he will
[1:49:50] witness to the lord
[1:49:53] oh praise god hallelujah amen
[1:49:56] praise god when you're tired of this let
[1:49:58] me know but i'm going to try to finish
[1:50:00] this it's only 20 to 1 you know
[1:50:04] amen
[1:50:05] it's only 21.
[1:50:07] is that okay
[1:50:09] if you want to stretch stretch if you
[1:50:10] need to go to the washroom don't
[1:50:12] hesitate you know some people in church
[1:50:14] they hesitate to go to the washroom
[1:50:15] because oh it's embarrassing people are
[1:50:17] going to see me nobody's looking at you
[1:50:19] they're looking at the world
[1:50:23] they're looking at this word he may hear
[1:50:25] praise the lord so feel free praise god
[1:50:28] and if you want to stretch stretch hey
[1:50:30] man bro you're going to foyer and do the
[1:50:32] stretching though because it's going to
[1:50:33] kind of look funny if you come in here
[1:50:35] and
[1:50:38] praise god you know i saw some people
[1:50:41] running past my house with wits in their
[1:50:43] hand and running with the weights in to
[1:50:46] try to get off their bodies and shape
[1:50:49] and stuff young men going by the walk
[1:50:52] they place their with their all their
[1:50:55] big weights and things to show their
[1:50:57] muscles and everything else well i'm not
[1:51:00] talking about like that you come to
[1:51:01] church with all your culture meant to to
[1:51:04] do those things but just to keep
[1:51:06] yourself alive and alert because while
[1:51:08] i'm preaching a word to your spirit
[1:51:10] you hear the g in the germ the devil is
[1:51:14] going to work on this man outside to
[1:51:15] make it sleep
[1:51:17] he's going to make it feel tired he
[1:51:19] wasn't tired all the time but all of a
[1:51:21] sudden you're gonna start feeling tired
[1:51:22] yes i feel bored oh i was bored but the
[1:51:25] devil is doing all of that with the man
[1:51:28] outside here right because it is just
[1:51:31] about now they should start getting this
[1:51:33] way and start working on that part and
[1:51:34] i'm fighting him here while i'm talking
[1:51:36] that's why i'm talking praise god
[1:51:38] because of the spirit in there that this
[1:51:41] lord has come to amen
[1:51:44] that's why the prophet would constantly
[1:51:46] say oh he said oh shake yourselves wake
[1:51:50] up walk you see that's what he was doing
[1:51:52] praise god friend come to yourself
[1:51:55] praise the lord amen praise god
[1:51:57] forevermore so we know
[1:52:01] that uh this one we know
[1:52:05] as enoch
[1:52:07] was caught up
[1:52:08] by the revelation of the word of god
[1:52:12] and once he was caught up into a certain
[1:52:14] dimension by the word of god the next
[1:52:17] step
[1:52:18] is to take him out into glory because
[1:52:20] once he breaks in there starts things
[1:52:22] start being unveiled to him and revealed
[1:52:25] he started literally by revelation
[1:52:29] to live the life
[1:52:31] that was pleasing to god
[1:52:34] amen enoch type of what the bride
[1:52:38] brother branham says so the same thing
[1:52:40] we are going through now the revelation
[1:52:44] making the word clearer on the standard
[1:52:47] distilled to us and as we walk in it
[1:52:50] praise god we begin to
[1:52:53] live a life all unconscious all
[1:52:56] automatic all by the holy spirit not my
[1:52:59] works not my struggle not by strength
[1:53:02] but by the grace of god hallelujah we're
[1:53:05] living a life
[1:53:06] the life that is pleasing to god which
[1:53:10] is the life of jesus christ in us that
[1:53:14] portion of god that was put in there to
[1:53:18] assure
[1:53:19] assure our return
[1:53:22] amen to put a guarantee that his lord
[1:53:26] will not return to him void that
[1:53:28] everyone will have a blessed assurance
[1:53:31] let me everyone have our anchor holes
[1:53:36] our anchor
[1:53:38] holds it's on the rock of ages
[1:53:42] amen oh praise god and i thank god today
[1:53:46] we can have that come blessed assurance
[1:53:50] i spoke with sister june this morning or
[1:53:53] praise god but you speak with a
[1:53:57] old lady a widow
[1:54:00] everything else a sister in the grace of
[1:54:02] god and the spirit of god falls on her
[1:54:05] while you're talking and the revelation
[1:54:08] flowing out of her and coming back to
[1:54:10] you and going back and forth before you
[1:54:13] know it she wants to scream that she
[1:54:15] wants to jumping or shouting screaming
[1:54:18] of course she's in her house praising
[1:54:20] god hallelujah doesn't matter how young
[1:54:22] you are how old you are the word within
[1:54:24] your heart the word within your life
[1:54:27] amen real quick in your being amen
[1:54:30] make you a new creature amen hallelujah
[1:54:34] amen oh my yes sir oh praise god this
[1:54:39] flesh on the outside is going to fail
[1:54:40] you
[1:54:43] and it fails me many times
[1:54:46] oh my oh i don't want to do that i don't
[1:54:50] want to do but that's what paul was
[1:54:52] talking about he said i don't want to do
[1:54:54] this the things i don't want to do
[1:54:56] sometimes i end up doing you know what
[1:54:59] uh you know but thank god who give us
[1:55:02] the victory to jesus christ because the
[1:55:05] life that i now live
[1:55:08] is not that life of human life just of
[1:55:12] of the flesh but the life i now live i
[1:55:15] live by the
[1:55:17] the life of christ in me that's living
[1:55:19] through me bringing glory to god and is
[1:55:22] well pleasing to god
[1:55:24] [Applause]
[1:55:25] that is the life that pleases god
[1:55:28] not something that i put on work or
[1:55:31] culture rate or
[1:55:32] get myself through a good religious
[1:55:35] system that details the guidelines and
[1:55:37] guideposts by which i should operate and
[1:55:40] control my life my urges my desires my
[1:55:44] wants my will no not my will be done but
[1:55:48] thy will to the glory of god hallelujah
[1:55:51] amen amen amen thank god god was
[1:55:56] satisfied with the life that enoch was
[1:55:59] producing now just to throw this in so
[1:56:02] that somebody would say oh before jesus
[1:56:04] came he was living that life no he
[1:56:07] didn't have it like jesus had it but he
[1:56:10] had enough of it that it was pleasing to
[1:56:13] god
[1:56:14] uh god doesn't expect you or i
[1:56:18] to be exactly like jesus christ he was
[1:56:21] the fullness of it all
[1:56:24] but you what you will be what you are
[1:56:27] producing in you that little portion
[1:56:29] you're producing that is what is
[1:56:31] pleasing to god
[1:56:33] that's why brother branham says you're
[1:56:35] not going to come the ful
[1:56:38] the fullness of perfection and all that
[1:56:40] before you leave here you're going to
[1:56:41] have the sticky nature dealing with you
[1:56:42] all the way through until you get out of
[1:56:44] this
[1:56:46] all the way until you get out to this
[1:56:48] it's going to be you're going to be
[1:56:49] dealing with it but the fact is god sees
[1:56:53] the life in you fighting this flesh and
[1:56:55] pushing it off to do his will and to
[1:56:58] please him and that pleases him that
[1:57:01] makes him love you praise god hallelujah
[1:57:04] amen so we live here projecting the
[1:57:06] overcoming life we live here of
[1:57:10] projecting the perfect life we live here
[1:57:13] projecting
[1:57:15] a life of perfect love and grace
[1:57:18] amen oh this person did you that this
[1:57:21] person you got to get back at them no
[1:57:24] you're foolish
[1:57:26] why didn't you do that why didn't you do
[1:57:28] this because that's how the devil will
[1:57:30] want to irk you up you know get you all
[1:57:32] stirred up by saying ah you're so
[1:57:33] foolish everybody else is doing this
[1:57:35] everybody else is doing that and you're
[1:57:37] gonna let that guy or that woman tell
[1:57:39] you this to tell you that when you can
[1:57:40] easily answer you see that's how he
[1:57:42] works behind the scenes trying to play
[1:57:45] on your mind and store you up and work
[1:57:46] you up but the man inside there
[1:57:49] you know is just
[1:57:51] it's just there and whenever god wants
[1:57:53] to speak before you know it something is
[1:57:55] said and when you say something when god
[1:57:58] says something sometimes one sentence
[1:58:01] one word
[1:58:03] and everything is done it's over
[1:58:05] you don't have to say anything else god
[1:58:07] gets the glory
[1:58:08] god gets the praise hallelujah amen oh
[1:58:12] my praise god hallelujah oh my so
[1:58:17] enoch broke into that realm of
[1:58:19] revelation of the unwritten word that
[1:58:21] wasn't yet written down yet parts of it
[1:58:24] not written down yet
[1:58:26] and with what he had he lived by that
[1:58:29] and started to produce
[1:58:32] a life
[1:58:35] heading in the direction that was
[1:58:37] pleasing to god
[1:58:39] it wasn't yet jesus christ
[1:58:41] but the life was on its way down
[1:58:44] the pipeline if you want to put it that
[1:58:46] way that's why he's there as an example
[1:58:49] praise the name of the lord hallelujah
[1:58:51] amen
[1:58:52] so
[1:58:53] we find we don't have to force ourselves
[1:58:56] but we wait on god
[1:58:59] amen to speak to us
[1:59:02] what to do
[1:59:03] and what is next praise the lord
[1:59:06] because we only hear for one purpose i
[1:59:08] repeat and that purpose
[1:59:11] is to express god
[1:59:14] by letting him the word have preeminence
[1:59:18] over us
[1:59:19] word of flesh fleshly mind fleshly
[1:59:22] desires and stuff like that praise the
[1:59:25] name of the lord amen we we hear it we
[1:59:28] believe it we obey it
[1:59:31] we act on it and we let god's grace
[1:59:34] uh you know take us through praise god
[1:59:38] look you know what i'm going to stop
[1:59:39] here i think you've had you've had
[1:59:41] enough for the day
[1:59:43] and we want to give god the praise and
[1:59:46] the honor and the glory musicians are
[1:59:48] you coming um you can sing while you're
[1:59:50] coming praise god
[1:59:52] you can hum while you're coming praise
[1:59:54] god come clap your hands while you're
[1:59:55] coming
[1:59:56] amen thank god forevermore hallelujah
[2:00:03] that's the life that pleases god
[2:00:06] of course that's not everything that can
[2:00:07] be said about that there may be others
[2:00:09] that may be saying things like this or
[2:00:11] even more but i just give you an
[2:00:14] incarnation
[2:00:15] not because like i said i don't want to
[2:00:19] spoon feed you
[2:00:21] by saying oh that is found in this quote
[2:00:24] page zones over here that's found over
[2:00:26] there and then i give you all the
[2:00:28] portions of meat
[2:00:30] and you got no desire to go and search
[2:00:33] no desire to go read no desire to listen
[2:00:36] because now i know the message no
[2:00:39] i want you to as brother brahm said he
[2:00:42] says you go in your room
[2:00:44] turn on that tape
[2:00:46] amen get quiet in the presence of god
[2:00:49] and just listen
[2:00:51] not to strive or do nothing all of a
[2:00:53] sudden things are going to pop things
[2:00:54] are going to start popping out and
[2:00:56] speaking to you you might have heard
