Thank you, Lord. If you can turn to John chapter 15 and verse 7, very familiar scripture. Hallelujah. I said, "God's word is spirit and it's life." And if you really want, if you want to get life, Amen. you go to God's word, receive it. Amen. And if praise God, and if you abide in me and my words abide in you, you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you. Amen. And in St. John's 14:12, Amen. reads like this. Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall ye do also, and greater works than these shall he do, because I go to my father. Amen. Praise God. You all may be seated tonight. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Now I want you to just answer just a simple little question for me tonight. And if anyone knows it or give me just a quick shower. When you hear the word deposit, what's the first thing that comes to your mind? Amen. Glory to God. See, there you go. Amen. That's what that's when you hear that word deposit. Amen. Hallelujah. Because you're all familiar with that, right? Thank you, Lord. And we want to speak about tonight the the deposit. Amen. The word deposit is to place for safekeeping. And God has a deposit safe. And his word is safekeeping. Amen. Hallelujah. Or in a trust. When you have a deposit, you put it in maybe in a trust or in a bank account. Amen. So you got money in the bank. No, it's safe, right? The think the ticket safe. One strike of a pen, you can just one little express it can just disappear. Or to give a security or impart payment. So when you make a deposit on an item, amen, you make a down payment and it pay part of it so later you can get it and pay the rest or you know, praise God. Like you make a down payment on a house. Amen. Later, you know, can get a mortgage and then you can acquire the house and you pay. Amen. Hallelujah. Or it's to deliver and leave an item. Deposit an item, leave it there. To put in place or set down especially carefully. Amen. So the first thing when you hear about deposit, you think about money. Amen. Or money in the bank. Now, in order for you to make an withdrawal, you got to put something there first. You can't go to the bank and you say go to withdrawal and you got nothing there. Amen. We're going to be practical tonight. Amen. Hallelujah. First, you got to make a deposit or somebody got to put something there for you for you to withdraw. Amen. Hallelujah. We hear of a gold or diamond or oil deposit. Amen. And when you think about an oil deposit, you think about fortune. You got you're rich. You find an oil deposit or a diamond or gold deposit rich. And in the early American history, right, those who know about American history, you must have heard about the California gold rush where over 300,000 people rush to California because they found gold. they're going to seek and find fortune. And even before that, right, the Europeans, they were promised that in this North American country and a land where there is gold cities, gold everywhere. And people just took off and they left, right? They took their family and they gave up everything they had and they just, you know, went to seek their fortune. But to their surprise when they came here, right? There was really nothing. So they were misled. Amen. And you know in the gold rush, the California gold rush, Amen. when they discovered gold there, right? Even when they discovered oil in Texas, right? People became million, multi-millionaires overnight. Amen. Praise God. And that caused so much disruption and and and killing because people be became greedy. They kill the natives by the thousands. They poison them. They shot them. They massacred them to drive them out from their own land. Amen. Just to get this what they think is so valuable. Amen. But you know that is the greatest deposit that was ever made and few finding this deposit. Few death people finding it. And this deposit was made way before the foundations of the world. And another deposit that God had placed or made is a deposit or part of him in you. A part of God himself, a part of the job of God's life or a part of the G that God has placed in you and I way before the foundations of the world. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. And that deposit is without price. Money can't buy that. And it's only by his grace alone and by his mercy that you receive that. You didn't do anything to deserve that. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Now, you may receive a letter in the mail, and it's just a piece of paper stating that you have a check for a million dollars. Right? And you might say, "How do you know you got a million dollars? It's just a piece of ordinary piece of paper, right? Stating that it's for a million dollar. Just states a million dollars. Pay to the owner or pay it to so and so name, right? A million dollars, right? Well, this check it came from the government, right? And it is if it is from the government, Amen. You're going to have to have what you're calling the controller of accounts signature or the governor or some person that owns the government financial institution with his signature and with a stamp on it. Or when you get this this check, you start to rejoice because you believe that you got money in your hand. You ain't seeing it, but you know it's written there. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. And you go about hollering and shouting and everything, but it's just a piece of paper. Amen. Hallelujah. But before that paper could have been printed, someone had to make a deposit. To back up that piece of paper. Amen. And if it's truly an official piece of paper, real. Amen. The money is already there in the bank. Amen. This is just a representation of what's there. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. So God has placed a deposit in you, a representation of the greater things, of himself, of the full blessings of God. Amen. Hallelujah. in you. Treasures buried in earthn vessels. Hidden. Hallelujah. Ordinary looks so ordinary. Looks so simple. Just like a piece of paper could be brushed aside, pushed aside, trampled over. Amen. The greatest treasure. Amen. In anyone's life. Hallelujah. I don't care what you've done or what accusation Satan puts against [Music] you. You may have cancer. You may be sick in your body or some kind of demon is oppressing you. I don't care what you have. But I've got a message for you here tonight. There is pardon. Amen. There is grace. That's right. There is healing. There is forgiveness. Yes, there is love. Amen. There is peace and there is joy for you. Money can buy peace. That's right. Because you see it all over the world. Yes, Jesus. Billionaire, multi-millionaires seeking just peace in their mind. They take a gun and they just blow their brains out. They go drugs. They do everything else trying to find joy and peace. Amen. But only the prince of peace can give you real peace. Amen. That's right. Amen. Hallelujah. Yes, Jesus. You say why I'm so excited about this. Amen. For it is written, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow. Amen. Come, let us reason together, says the Lord. There's forgiveness. There is nothing you can do that God can't forgive you. That's right. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Now, if you take a look right at this deposit for your healing, it was put in God's medicine cabinet. [Music] Amen. So, if you want healing tonight, go to God's medicine cabinet. There is a deposit that has been made there on your behalf. That's right. Amen. Amen. That was made on the day of Calvary. Amen. He was wounded for our transgressions. And with his stripes we were he past work. So go and claim what is rightfully yours tonight. Amen. Hallelujah. There may be struggle with something or some little thing in your body. Amen. It might be minor, it might be major. No matter what it is, pain in the back, pain in the legs, whatever heart pain, what kind of pain it is. Amen. It's already been paid for. Settle. Hallelujah. These things we need to be reminded over time and time again. Amen. Cuz when the pain come, you know, we just lie and we just, you know, like a wounded soldier in a corner just, you know, sulking and, you know, but we need to be reminded tonight what things God have the deposits that God has been placed in his bank. Amen. On your in your account that you can draw. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, Lord. You got a bank account. Amen. And where is this? Chase. CIBC. No. Where your bank account is. The thieves go break in there. They go hold it up and take any day. They could just that could disappear where M and rot can enter in. Yes. And it's yours tonight. Amen. Hallelujah. The deposit. God's deposit that's made for you. Receive it. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. And your healing has been bought and paid for and it's all yours. All you have to do is just reach out and get it. And that seems to be the hardest thing for people to do. Reach out and claim what is right for you. Because you know Satan will put every obstacle in your way to prevent you. Amen. He will block your mind to tell you it's not yours. That's right. Amen. It's not for you. Yeah. Look what you done. You didn't deserve that. You don't deserve healing. Look what you done. But you know he's a liar. Tell him he's a liar tonight. God's word is truth. And when you hear the truth, it's going to set you free. So whatever chain Satan is trying to bind you with tonight, tell him you get the hints. You're loose. You're free. Amen. Loose your mind. Yes, Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Now, in order that people would see and know, God promised that he would send gifts. Is that right? Amen. And we spoke a little recently on our prayer night. Amen. The nine spiritual gifts that God has sent for us. It's all for us. It is for the believer. God's gifts are only for the believer. It's for those who can believe. It's not for the unbeliever. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. The Holy Ghost is not for those who do not believe in it. Amen. It's for those who believe in it. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Well, you say when you read the Bible, what makes you carry on? So when you say he was wounded for our transgressions and with his stripes you were healed. When you say well whatsoever things you desire when you pray, believe that you have received it and you shall have it. Amen. Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Well, we should start rejoicing. Amen. Amen. Because if you believe that, you will start rejoicing. Hallelujah. How would you feel that someone wrote you a check and you went to the bank and you said NF? You know what that means? Sufficient funds. The back problem. Amen. How will you feel in your hand? Amen. If you work hard and the boss pay you and when you go to cash check not y nothing. Amen. But with God's back who could bank up God's back. That's right. It's in inexhaustible resources. Amen. Inexhaustible. How much you can believe God for tonight. Amen. That's right.
