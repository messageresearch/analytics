[1:31] and it came to pass after these things
[1:34] that
[1:35] nebot the jezreelite had a Vineyard
[1:39] which was in jezrael hard by the Palace
[1:43] of Ahab king of Samaria and Ahab spake
[1:46] unto nebot saying give me thy vard that
[1:50] I may have it for a garden of Earth
[1:52] because it is me unto my house and I
[1:56] will give thee for it it a better
[1:58] Vineyard than
[2:00] or it or if it seems good to thee I will
[2:04] give Thee the word of it in money and
[2:07] neot said unto Ahab the Lord forbid me
[2:11] that I should give the inheritance of my
[2:13] fathers unto thee and Ahab came into his
[2:17] house heavy and displeased because of
[2:19] the word which nebot the jite had spoken
[2:22] to him for if for he had said I will not
[2:27] give Thee the inheritance of my fathers
[2:31] and he laid him down upon his bed and
[2:34] turned away his face and would eat no
[2:37] bread and Jezebel his wife came to him
[2:42] and said unto him why is thy spirit so
[2:44] sad that thou eatest no bread and he
[2:47] said unto her because I spake unto neot
[2:50] the jite and said unto him give me thy
[2:54] Vineyard for money or else if it please
[2:57] Thee I will give thee another Vineyard
[2:59] for for and he answered I will not give
[3:02] thee my Vineyard and Jezebel his wife
[3:05] said unto him thust thou now govern the
[3:08] Kingdom of Israel arise and eat bread
[3:11] and let thine heart be mared I will give
[3:14] Thee the vineyard of lior the jite amen
[3:18] amen praise the Lord thank you
[3:21] brother praise the Lord God bless the
[3:24] reading of his word and now I'd like to
[3:27] read another scripture a short one uh
[3:31] out of the Book of Proverbs
[3:34] 23 verse 22
[3:37] 23 paren unto thy father that beg thee
[3:42] and despise not thy mother when she is
[3:47] old find the
[3:50] truth and S it
[3:53] not
[3:55] amen hallelujah also wisdom and
[4:01] instruction and understanding thanks be
[4:04] to God may God bless the reading of his
[4:08] word please be
[4:12] seated uh what a wonderful
[4:15] story and within the stories that are in
[4:20] the Bible and in the Old
[4:23] Testament uh they are not just stories
[4:27] to be told but there are are truths
[4:30] embedded in these
[4:33] stories there are lessons to be learned
[4:37] embedded in these
[4:39] stories there are guidelines for
[4:43] living uh principles that gives our
[4:46] life's purpose all wrapped up within
[4:50] God's
[4:52] word so when we read the story of uh
[4:58] Ahab and
[5:00] neor we find out that he was a Believer
[5:04] he was a Jew a genuine believer and
[5:08] Jew and his house means he was well off
[5:12] his house was very close to uh ahab's
[5:16] Palace and no doubt Ahab would look out
[5:20] of his window and see neighbors's
[5:23] Vineyard and realized he's got beautiful
[5:27] Vines planted and maybe you know wines
[5:32] being a wine seller and some of the best
[5:35] wines in Israel coming up and everything
[5:39] else and uh let me use the word he
[5:43] committed
[5:44] it because it wasn't his
[5:47] own uh and he committed it it's not just
[5:50] a matter that he wanted to buy it the
[5:53] desire for it was so embedded within
[5:55] them within him he had to have it
[6:00] and so he broke one of the Ten
[6:02] Commandments uh already by committing
[6:06] and neighbor
[6:08] vard he approached NE and what a
[6:12] privilege I mean most people would be
[6:15] all struck by the king or or or or the
[6:18] president or prime minister come into
[6:21] their house so all struck some people
[6:24] get so off struck by personality they
[6:26] lose their voice they lose their
[6:28] reasoning yeah some of them will just
[6:32] give up and do give anything or do
[6:35] whatever that celebrity says because
[6:38] they're hypnotized by celebrity and big
[6:42] names and lights and and everything
[6:46] else but uh NE respected Ahab but he
[6:52] wasn't so uh you know struck by him or
[6:57] impressed by him that he's going to give
[7:00] him whatever he
[7:01] wants so here it is that the desire for
[7:05] he says give me thy
[7:07] Vineyard that I may have it for a garden
[7:11] of
[7:12] Earth wow think about it he's going to
[7:15] turn this man's Vineyard into a garden
[7:18] of
[7:19] birds then
[7:21] further because it's near my house
[7:24] you're going to turn a Vineyard into a
[7:27] kitchen Garden you understand
[7:30] he's going to turn a Vineyard into a
[7:33] kitchen Garden to show how great he is
[7:36] that uh NE but's Vineyard that's so
[7:39] famous for all the wines the best wines
[7:42] in Israel is going to be nothing but my
[7:46] Vineyard I've heard arrogant rich people
[7:50] talking and uh somebody's going to say
[7:54] oh well my house is uh you know 5,000
[7:58] square ft and the person turns literally
[8:01] here it turn to the other one and say
[8:02] what are you talking about half of that
[8:04] is the size of the
[8:08] kitchen yeah and I've been there where
[8:10] the huge uh six or 8ot whatever TVs on
[8:15] the wall on a brick wall so far away
[8:19] that it has to be that size for them to
[8:21] see and kitchen is on this one hand my
[8:25] God something else so the arance got a
[8:27] hold of him and he is literally saying
[8:30] here that he is so great that that
[8:32] Vineyard is just going to be nothing but
[8:34] a kitchen Garden for
[8:35] him so you understand that all right um
[8:40] I will give to thee a better vard than
[8:43] this why don't you buy that
[8:46] one if if there's better ones than this
[8:49] why don't you buy that but no he had an
[8:51] habous eye to get this Vineyard if it
[8:55] seeth good to thee I will give Thee the
[8:58] work of it in
[9:00] money and there's a key here nebot said
[9:03] to Ahab the Lord forbid to me that I
[9:07] would give the inheritance of my fathers
[9:11] to
[9:13] thee amen that's what we're going to put
[9:16] most most of the emphasis on I will not
[9:20] give Thee the inheritance of my fathers
[9:23] and it got Ahab so depressed that he
[9:28] went to his home turn turn his head to
[9:29] the wall face to the wall means I don't
[9:31] want to talk to nobody and refuse to eat
[9:36] and everything else but of course
[9:37] Jezebel comes in with the picture and
[9:39] say you call yourself king of
[9:41] Israel you call yourself a
[9:44] man and stir them up and say you you
[9:48] going to have one of your subjects uh
[9:50] tell you they're not going to sell you
[9:53] lay down on your bed have a good sleep
[9:55] get up have something to eat and start
[9:59] to Rejoice because I'm going down there
[10:01] to see
[10:02] him by the time I come back you're going
[10:05] to have your
[10:08] Feld amen we'll talk about Jezebel
[10:11] another time her character and that
[10:13] spirit that can travel down through the
[10:15] centuries and come into our day and in
[10:18] our age and rest on people especially
[10:22] women
[10:24] amen I will give you the vineyard well
[10:28] the fact is we read the other scripture
[10:31] that says bind the
[10:34] truth and S it not by wisdom instruction
[10:39] and understanding and sell it not so you
[10:43] see what I'm thinking I'm looking at at
[10:47] ne's Vineyard as the revelation of the
[10:50] word of God that has been handed down to
[10:52] us
[10:53] amen that is our inheritance for this
[10:56] day this Jesus it's come through all the
[11:01] Patriarchs prophets through the seven
[11:03] Church H messenger from generation to
[11:06] Generation The Generation until it comes
[11:09] to our generation amen is that right
[11:13] yeah and here we are uh in the promised
[11:17] land picking the grapes yes enjoying the
[11:21] wine that God gives amen and rejoicing
[11:25] in the Lord under inspiration of the
[11:28] Holy Spirit amen I'm giving God all the
[11:32] glory and the praise for what he has
[11:35] done in our lives right and uh Satan
[11:39] comes
[11:40] along and he would like you to sell out
[11:44] on your faith sell out your
[11:48] confidence sell out your foundations
[11:51] right sell out your all the fundamentals
[11:54] of the word of God right he would love
[11:57] for you to sell it all out to him sell
[12:01] your birth right right in other words
[12:04] like Esau we wouldn't discuss him but
[12:07] it's the same thing here so his birth
[12:11] right for a message amen and sometimes
[12:15] friends that is what's happening now why
[12:17] am I speaking on this because we're
[12:19] living in an age where uh most of the
[12:23] people want to live act and speak like
[12:26] politicians they have no Foundation
[12:29] right and even in their thoughts they
[12:32] can't hold a sexual thought and carry it
[12:34] for any length of time it seems like the
[12:37] whole uh world is suffering from
[12:41] Ab and they have a short attention span
[12:44] because of Technology right and
[12:47] everything shifting and moving all the
[12:50] time and people can't uh hold to a form
[12:55] Faith or a form belief
[12:59] and stick to it amen and say here I
[13:02] stand so help me go amen come on
[13:06] brother everything else than this
[13:09] message of this
[13:10] hour is sinking
[13:13] sound the truth and our hope is built on
[13:17] nothing less than Jesus Christ and
[13:20] righteousness we can not trust the
[13:23] sweetest R but holy leave on Jesus name
[13:27] for he is the rock of of our salvation
[13:31] and the foundation of the entire church
[13:34] is Jesus Christ the revelation of who
[13:37] here right amen and we this is what I am
[13:42] encouraging you and trying to stimulate
[13:45] you to take a hold and have firm faith

[14:43] you are going to Tumble down you're
[14:45] going to fall you're going to make

[15:12] condation oh praise God forever more so
[15:17] the generation said the prophet will
[15:19] become weaker but
[15:21] wiser amen and that is why because
[15:25] people have not been as PA Ed the word
[15:28] that f b Ministries to establish the
[15:32] people in the
[15:34] faith Amen in other words you you you
[15:37] create a masterpiece and then after you
[15:40] created it you take it and you get a
[15:43] slab of marble granite polished and you
[15:48] set it on that to let the beauty of the
[15:51] thing show amen but you have to set it
[15:54] on the foundation for it to really look
[15:56] well and God wants to said every one of
[16:00] us not just the church but every one of
[16:02] us our lives should be set upon the
[16:05] foundation of the rock revelation of who
[16:07] Jesus Christ
[16:09] is individually am we are to be founded
[16:14] upon the word of God Amen Hallelujah and
[16:18] don't come here because of your mother
[16:20] no are you here because your father
[16:23] comes in or because your wife comes in
[16:27] or because your husband come comes here
[16:30] the song All spiritual says not my
[16:32] mother not my father but it's me oh Lord
[16:35] standing in the need of prayer not my
[16:39] father not my mother but it's me oh Lord
[16:42] standing in the of prayer it's me it's

[17:00] faith can't rest in the P or the of the
[17:04] word of God As Long As I follow
[17:06] him oh that beon is faithful and true
[17:10] and a good man has a good paner oh you
[17:13] know I'm going to go to that church
[17:15] because that's a good Deacon no doesn't
[17:18] work that way if you want to be a
[17:20] genuine Christian you've got to have
[17:23] your own
[17:26] individ upon the word of God
[17:29] amen hallelujah praise God my God if
[17:34] your mother is gone tomorrow then your
[17:36] fith God if that pass is G tomorrow you
[17:39] f God whatever so but if you have an
[17:43] individual faith based upon the word of
[17:46] God the devil cannot shake
[17:49] you and there is a there is a fam for
[17:53] people that have individual faith based
[17:56] upon their Rock revelation
[17:59] the word of God and that is the reason
[18:02] why you got belever shifting from church
[18:05] to church not because they don't believe
[18:08] but they haven't been firmly
[18:11] established is that right firmly
[18:14] established how would you like to build
[18:16] a building rather than and tomorrow when
[18:18] you come back building shift right
[18:21] instead of being on the slab Foundation
[18:23] that you put there or whatever
[18:24] Foundation it's fin off to the side
[18:27] right because you know I always got to
[18:30] have a back door because if that things
[18:31] don't work out in that church I just
[18:33] slep out the back quick and and and and
[18:35] you know I'm somewhere else I I wasn't
[18:37] ready with them you know I just used to
[18:39] go there and you know sit in the back so
[18:42] that at least I go to church no you come
[18:46] to church you are the church and you
[18:48] come to meet with Jesus Christ amen tell
[18:50] the truth all right that's what this is
[18:52] all about that's the reason why we are
[18:54] here in the house of the Living God
[18:56] praise the Lord hallelujah he wouldn't
[18:59] sell him because first of all the
[19:02] property that was given to him was of
[19:05] sentimental value to
[19:08] him whenever he walk those fields he can
[19:11] realize that his great great grandfather
[19:14] was walking through this field and
[19:16] looking at some of these Vines because
[19:18] you know Vines you know Great Vines can
[19:21] live for 100 years 150 years they can be
[19:24] there forever longer long so he's
[19:28] looking at the same word the same v he's
[19:31] looking at the same Holy Spirit he's
[19:34] looking at the same word the
[19:36] same and walking up and down that field
[19:39] in the morning early and thinking about
[19:42] his great great grandfather and the
[19:45] value of that amen is more than anybody
[19:49] can
[19:50] buy and therefore he said I want s it
[19:54] praise God praise the Lord amen the
[19:57] Jesus said by the P if you get the P of
[20:00] bre price don't sell it why because it's
[20:03] Priceless amen there is no price you can
[20:06] put upon the revelation of God's
[20:09] word said you I cannot stress the
[20:13] importance of genuine Revelation to the
[20:17] True
[20:18] Believer see because you can't buy it in
[20:20] the store he says who can uh dream
[20:23] himself a dream or decid he's going to
[20:26] reveal to himself a revelation
[20:29] or is God deserve it no he says God by
[20:33] his grace gives it and because it's my
[20:36] gra there is no price on it Hallelujah
[20:41] no price whatsoever glory to God you
[20:44] can't buy it in the store but it's by
[20:47] faith in God no earthly value in other
[20:51] words he realize that even if he was
[20:54] going to give his kingdom to
[20:57] neighbor just to got that vard NE was
[21:00] not going to sell it and the devil will
[21:03] try that with you he want to give you
[21:06] the whole world is that right if you
[21:10] give a man the whole
[21:13] world to lose his soul s out my God you
[21:18] want a job you want this you want that
[21:21] money all you got to do is lower the
[21:23] standard Lord just drop this out and
[21:25] come on stop talking like that when you
[21:27] on the job don't bother with this
[21:29] witnessing stuff you it's going to be
[21:31] bad for your career and and and you're
[21:33] not going to be able to get along in
[21:35] life I mean let's Live and Let Live
[21:38] right and uh you know you stroke my back
[21:41] down and I'll stroke yours and and and
[21:44] you don't make trouble in My Kingdom the
[21:46] devil tells you and I'm not going to
[21:47] make trouble for you and we going to get
[21:50] along the only thing is you can't get
[21:52] along the sink
[21:55] am is that right right I who talk to us
[21:58] Solomon talks about the snake you're
[22:00] going to put in your bosom right like
[22:02] the story is told of a farmer that found
[22:04] a snake on a wintery day and the snake
[22:06] was cold shivering nearly dying takes it
[22:09] and brings it into his Farmhouse put it
[22:11] near the fire and when the snake revived
[22:13] and everything else he decided he's
[22:15] going to feed the snake a bit of milk
[22:17] because snakes love milk that's why they
[22:20] even in the Primitive countries they
[22:22] know when a mother's pregnant and she
[22:23] starts to produce milk they got to look
[22:25] for snakes because the snake kind of
[22:27] Senses it smells it and they like to be
[22:29] around there where the milk for the
[22:31] child would come out so here it is now
[22:34] he put some milk there and for the snake
[22:38] and as soon as he puts the milk the the
[22:40] snake drinks the milk and bit him on the
[22:42] hand and he my God I took you out of
[22:47] this cold and brought you in put you by
[22:49] the fire warmed you up now I'm feing you
[22:52] milk to B me what kind of a he says well
[22:55] I'm a
[22:56] snake he says when picked me up you knew
[22:59] I was a
[23:00] snake but that's expect me to do I got
[23:03] to act in other words I got to act by my
[23:09] man praise God so you don't make a deal
[23:13] with the devil because the devil break
[23:16] that deal he's a liar from the beginning
[23:19] and he'll always be the father of liar
[23:22] so when he tells you I'll leave you
[23:24] alone and you leave me alone don't rock
[23:27] the boat and all this stuff and don't
[23:29] testify about Jesus and all this stuff
[23:31] don't you listening to him because he's
[23:34] not somebody you can make a deal with
[23:36] you got to stand to the
[23:38] word and the song that's been ringing in
[23:40] my head when I thought about this hold
[23:43] to God changing hand
[23:47] amen God changing
[23:50] [Music]
[23:54] hand ET
[23:56] [Music]
[24:01] God everything around us is Shifting and
[24:05] moving but the only anger that we have
[24:08] to hold us is Jesus Christ the said
[24:11] yesterday today and forever
[24:16] I thank you Lord thank you hallelujah
[24:20] praise God my God my mother left an old
[24:25] Bible that she wept over cried over
[24:28] marked on and everything else do you
[24:31] think I will go sell that to an auction
[24:33] house you think any of my siblings would
[24:36] take that Bible and and just sell it
[24:39] like that no there is no value on
[24:42] something like that amen because it goes
[24:46] right back through your your Generations
[24:50] listen to Paul Jude one of course one
[24:53] one chapter uh three to four beloved
[24:57] when I all diligence to Rite unto you of

[25:05] me to write onto you and encourage you
[25:09] which is what I'm trying to do and exal
[25:11] you that you should

[25:22] given up the Fed so easy you know let go
[25:25] their rights giving up their inheritance
[25:28] walking away from the what was in God's
[25:33] predestinated will for
[25:36] them they turned away from God's fre
[25:39] will and when the devil challenges the
[25:42] will they decide they're going to back
[25:44] away and back
[25:46] off oh but no this what we have received
[25:50] is not from the mind of
[25:53] will this what we have received has come
[25:56] down through the centuries of the angel
[25:59] through the Patriarchs through the
[26:01] prophets through Jesus Christ through
[26:03] Paul through all the apostles right
[26:08] [Applause]

[29:04] generation to generation Paul said in
[29:07] this generation and nowen I'm leaving
[29:11] and now I pass to you the torch of
[29:14] Life he's thinking of a relay race and
[29:18] at this stage I'm passing to you the
[29:20] torch of life back then they actually
[29:22] ran with a torch like it symbolized
[29:24] right now with the O whenever they're
[29:26] going to start the Olympics they do it
[29:28] with a runner running with the torch and
[29:30] that's the way it used to be in the
[29:31] Olympics and then pass the torch to the
[29:33] next one and the torch of course
[29:35] represents the word of God and Pa said
[29:38] hand to you the word of the word of life
[29:41] he The Word of Life praise God forever
[29:45] more and that
[29:47] torch has been passed down from
[29:50] generation to
[29:52] generation in other words it's not a mod
[29:54] church it's the original Church
[29:58] from hand to hand the anting going from
[30:01] man to man man to man until it comes to
[30:04] the people of this
[30:06] generation the same holy spirit that
[30:09] broke himself up on the de cross and
[30:12] Anointed The People by coming upon their
[30:15] heads in the lick of fire which was just
[30:17] a symbol that he has gone into their
[30:19] lives and the fire of God is now within
[30:22] them that same holy spirit is available
[30:25] to us today I feel
[30:28] his pres
[30:30] today it's not not the Holy Spirit the
[30:34] Holy Spirit has to become water no it's
[30:36] the same all time Holy Spirit and that's
[30:40] the reason the devil don't want to go
[30:42] there but it's
[30:49] [Applause]
[30:51] good word praise God hallelujah amen
[30:55] glory to God you know the story is told
[30:58] in the Bible of Solomon when he was
[30:59] alive that his soldiers his kingdom was
[31:02] so rich that his the soldiers his
[31:05] personal guards their shields were made
[31:08] of pure
[31:10] gold pure gold and uh when he died then
[31:15] one of his son after there was some kind
[31:17] of a financial strain on Israel he he
[31:20] got those guards to melt their Shields
[31:24] and sell out the gold and made them go
[31:26] with silver Shields
[31:28] and then when things got more
[31:30] financially worse that's a Believer
[31:32] selling out slow slow in increment you
[31:34] know right
[31:37] there the silver got of value and so he
[31:42] down the silver until the story ended
[31:45] that they end up with shields of brass
[31:47] and you know grass is a symbol of
[31:49] judgment right so he sold out uh but he
[31:53] didn't just sell out like that he he
[31:55] wanted to appear like you still have
[31:57] faith in God and he's still believing
[31:59] and following the message meanwhile
[32:01] slowly behind the scenes he's
[32:04] decaying spiritually going into a Decay
[32:07] by selling out one little thing to
[32:09] another and the little foxes start
[32:12] spoiling out the b right amen am I
[32:15] talking about you you know
[32:17] yourself search your own
[32:20] heart you're here not in my presence but
[32:22] in the presence of the Lord you got to
[32:24] search your own heart and see exactly
[32:27] where you are and that's the reason why
[32:30] brother gr said this is the problem
[32:32] going to be presented in our age because
[32:35] the devil will be so strong in the world
[32:38] Amen that Believers if their names are
[32:41] not written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[32:43] he says every single one of the others
[32:45] will be deceived right only those whose
[32:48] names are written in the book right and
[32:51] then another place he says if you make a
[32:53] claim that you are a Christian you're
[32:54] child of God the devil is sure to come
[32:56] and test that
[32:58] right is that right anything you claim

[33:03] claim to see if you really mean it I'm

[33:18] come and check your out to see if you're
[33:19] solidly founded so that's what I'm
[33:22] trying to tell you if you have want to
[33:24] have faith that's unshakable amen
[33:28] let the devil come let the white wind go
[33:31] there here I stand upon the Water of God
[33:34] Eternal amen glory to his wonderful name

[35:48] may change the
[35:50] method of how we are carrying the
[35:55] gospel but we can never change the
[35:57] message
[35:59] the message can remain the same and
[36:01] brother said it and the way he said it
[36:04] was well you know we had the bicycle age
[36:07] you know we had the cart the age of the
[36:09] cart where they found out you could make
[36:10] a rum wheel and get a cart to carry more
[36:13] wi and then they get something else they
[36:15] got a bicycle and then you know they got
[36:17] the horse and carriage and finally we
[36:20] got cars and now we got all kinds of
[36:22] other things he's just showing the
[36:25] progression of how people are
[36:27] transported goods are transported and he
[36:29] actually was trying to give us that
[36:31] truth that uh the method of how you
[36:35] carry the gospel may change and it has
[36:38] to change but the basic gospel and this
[36:41] message that don't change is that right
[36:45] that's what we have to understand and
[36:47] some people will will will will be hum
[36:50] up on how you are carrying it rather
[36:53] than seeing that you carrying the same P
[36:56] message that was was delivered unto the
[36:59] saintes and that's what we got to fight
[37:01] for that's what we got to uh contend for
[37:04] and that's what we will never sell out
[37:07] but hold of God's unchanging
[37:10] hand Romans 8:35 to39 who shall separate
[37:15] us from the love of God shall
[37:18] tribulation no Triumph no or

[40:34] of the Old Testament is Jesus of
[40:43] the yes you must firmly Embrace that
[40:47] truth and not in a shallow light way

[41:09] to embrace the
[41:12] truth that
[41:14] baptism is in the name of the Lord Jesus
[41:17] Christ for in no other name given on the
[41:21] heaven whereby we must be saved by the
[41:24] name of Jesus Christ Our Lord Embrace
[41:28] that truth amen and don't go switching
[41:30] back and forth in your mind or in your
[41:32] heart where somebody just comes uh to

[41:36] do some Bible study with you and the
[41:38] next thing you know they start to tell

[41:43] he wasn't the almighty God and uh you
[41:46] know he was a prophet and everything
[41:48] else like that but he really wasn't the
[41:51] god of the prophets and you know uh like
[41:54] that and and and then your mind start to
[41:56] get a little fuzzy and you wondering you

[42:12] one or two sentences they're ready to
[42:14] pick up their books and
[42:17] [Applause]

[42:23] chickens chasing an eagle to eat
[42:26] him but the moment go chicken see an
[42:28] legle Circle above the barard they're

[42:40] bird Hallelujah the word of God is in
[42:43] them and it's quick and sharper than a
[42:44] ding sword glory to God hallelujah so we
[42:48] believe in immersion in

[43:00] sprinkling where I dip my hands in a
[43:03] with a lace and cief in some holy water
[43:06] soal and sprinkle it to the east to the
[43:09] west north south up down and sprinkle

[43:33] sticking up the entire church you got to
[43:35] be baptized in water and in the name of
[43:38] Jesus Christ where you completely
[43:40] immersed amen the Bible tells us that
[43:42] John Jesus and Jesus went down into the
[43:46] water John baptized him and the Bible
[43:48] says and he comeing up out of the water
[43:51] means he was in and he was down in the
[43:54] water and he came up then the spirit of
[43:56] God desend upon him like a oh my praise
[44:00] God we believe that amen we need to

[44:09] of the Holy Ghost do you believe the of
[44:12] the Holy Ghost amen amen praise the name

[44:24] forment and when it forment it becomes
[44:28] explosive you can't sit still you it it

[44:33] hour it makes you want to tell somebody
[44:36] you can't shut your mouth and keep it to
[44:38] yourself you you sell out your own pride
[44:41] and your own fear and your own doubts
[44:43] and everything else and you share the
[44:45] word of God we don't know what the
[44:47] effects will be because we are the
[44:49] generation that are preaching to souls

[45:00] him then he go down into hell then he
