[2:36] Jesus Christ amen and amen the Lord
[2:39] richly bless you every one of you who
[2:41] are here tonight listen to the two
[2:44] verses out of Matthew chapter two
[2:48] now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of
[2:52] Judea in the days of Herod the king
[2:56] behold there came wise men from the East
[3:01] to Jerusalem saying where is he that is
[3:04] born King of the Jews for we have seen
[3:07] his star in the east and I come to
[3:11] worship him praise God hallelujah God
[3:14] bless you please be seated amen praise
[3:18] the Lord as you know we're having
[3:20] service tonight in Li of upcoming uh
[3:25] Christmas day is going to be on Sunday
[3:27] itself and we know family is going to be
[3:30] families are going to be here and there
[3:31] and everywhere and occupied at that at
[3:35] that particular time and uh so we
[3:38] thought we'll have this service tonight
[3:42] amen and uh just Worship the Lord that
[3:45] way so that we can all do whatever we
[3:47] have to do praise the
[3:49] Lord amen uh let me make this comment
[3:53] too uh because I I was talking with
[3:56] somebody and they say oh no we um I'm
[3:59] I'm want to make sure that no matter
[4:01] what uh people have to come on Sunday
[4:03] and this and that I said well uh brother
[4:06] that's not the way I really uh see it uh
[4:10] I know that we even though Sunday is
[4:13] very important it's the resurrection of
[4:15] Lord and so on and so on yet um we
[4:20] understand that we're not under
[4:22] traditions and laws Paul said let no man
[4:25] judge you as the days and holy days and
[4:29] new wounds and and all these kinds of
[4:31] things uh if we just uh were going to
[4:35] just like uh you know upcon just like
[4:38] that then that's was a different matter
[4:41] but uh just so that you understand that
[4:44] we are doing this because it would be
[4:47] better uh for the church at this
[4:49] particular time even BR said you should
[4:51] be in church on Sunday but if you really
[4:54] have something to do you know some
[4:56] people have to do this or that if you're
[4:58] making an excuse you're going to
[5:00] but if you have to do this then you have
[5:02] to do it what else you going to do to
[5:04] build your house do whatever you have to
[5:06] do praise the Lord all right I just
[5:08] thought I'd make those comments because
[5:11] I I in case you meet some of those kinds
[5:13] of people that want to make those kinds
[5:14] of comments you'll know how to talk to
[5:17] them praise the Lord amen well we just
[5:22] read the scripture and simply told us
[5:25] that Jesus was born in Bethlehem of
[5:28] Judea and we we have touched on that
[5:31] telling you what Bethlehem was all about
[5:34] now uh uh I'm quoting brother BR then if
[5:38] he was born in
[5:41] Bethlehem and he is our
[5:44] Bethlehem then all true believing
[5:47] children of God are born in Bethlehem
[5:51] with him amen is that right praise the
[5:55] lord we are born in Bethlehem with him
[5:58] see then every one of the True Believers
[6:01] in Christ is born in Christ and they are
[6:05] born in God's Bethlehem I was born in
[6:09] Bethlehem you are born in Bethlehem
[6:12] right that's the way it is and anyone
[6:15] else can be born in God's
[6:18] Bethlehem God's true House of Bread of
[6:22] eternal life where you can sit and eat
[6:26] and live forever amen praise the Lord
[6:30] well wonderful that we can be born in
[6:33] Bethlehem but uh it's not so much
[6:36] talking only about Bethlehem back there
[6:39] because that's where Jesus was born when
[6:42] he came the first time and when he came
[6:46] the first time in flesh he was born in
[6:49] Bethlehem but he promised the son of man
[6:52] would be revealed again amen right again
[6:56] according to Luke he will be revealed
[6:58] again now
[7:00] understand that that doesn't mean that
[7:02] Jesus personally is going to come back
[7:06] with the flesh physical body that he had
[7:10] Back in the New Testament but he's
[7:13] coming back in the form of his bride
[7:17] amen and as he was the head of the body
[7:23] and just like how God first formed Adam
[7:26] and then afterwards he formed Eve
[7:30] he did the same thing in the new
[7:32] creation first the head came which is
[7:35] Jesus Christ amen which is the second
[7:38] Adam and then comes the church made out
[7:43] of the same material that Adam was made
[7:48] amen Amen brother said that in Christ is
[7:52] revealed in his own word also in Christ
[7:55] is the mystery of God revealed if he is
[7:57] the word then she to be the word amen
[8:01] because it's the same material that
[8:04] makes him he took a part of that to make
[8:08] heren praise God and so we are a part we
[8:12] are him she is actually him now being
[8:17] revealed amen the uning of the Mighty
[8:21] God is now taking
[8:23] place we sing the song God in flesh
[8:28] appearing oh come let but are you
[8:31] thinking what you're really singing It's
[8:34] not him appearing back there it's here
[8:38] he's appearing now in Simplicity in
[8:42] Bethlehem again in in a
[8:45] Manger who's the manger you're the
[8:47] manger I said he said a rotten stinking
[8:50] manger of
[8:51] sin but he is
[8:54] Born Again amen is that right he is born
[8:59] again
[9:00] in you and I born in Bethlehem once
[9:05] again so we want to praise God that at
[9:09] least my heart your heart could provide
[9:12] a resting place for the savior of this
[9:15] house amen and that we could be chosen
[9:19] elected and and placed positionally in
[9:23] the age as I as I was reading today
[9:25] brother Bron the word is alloted to
[9:28] every age
[9:30] a part of the word is alloted to every
[9:34] age a part of the enti church is made up
[9:38] of people called out of every one of
[9:41] these Church ages and each one of those
[9:45] ages had a promise a word is alloted to
[9:49] that age and you and I are a part of the
[9:53] word for the age in which we are called
[9:56] out of Amen because your name is a part
[9:59] of that word that's why you could be
[10:01] called out amen and so you are a part of
[10:05] that word that was alloted or
[10:10] predestinated to come up or appear or be
[10:15] made manifest in this age amen you could
[10:19] not come up in another age because this
[10:22] was the age where you were supposed to
[10:25] be a part of what God is doing amen
[10:29] because because he was now going to
[10:31] unveil the entire body because Through
[10:34] the Ages he was building the body
[10:37] starting coming up come back to Luther
[10:40] the whole thing was destroyed and then
[10:42] back in Luther he started with defeat
[10:44] come right up to to Wesley where he
[10:47] preach Holiness which is to get rid of
[10:49] the waste from the body and that's right
[10:52] there and we call this W too so and it
[10:55] goes right up until it came to the the
[10:58] age of Li amen where we have the
[11:02] Pentecostal but then he promised during
[11:05] the age of the Pentecostal he would send
[11:08] a
[11:09] prophet with the coming of the Prophet
[11:12] we enter the seeing age because he was a
[11:17] seer right a Seer is a seer of the word
[11:24] like Noah was a knower of the world you
[11:30] understand what I'm saying yes so he
[11:32] sees the word and recogniz it and so he
[11:38] he was uh there during the seeing age
[11:42] but the hour would come when God use him
[11:45] to do what restore the word restore the
[11:49] word of God bring back the word so what
[11:53] now that it could be blessed in the
[11:56] bride so all the word of God is in
[11:59] Christ amen and Christ is in the church
[12:02] amen and now the bride has the word and
[12:05] she knows what to do with the word
[12:09] because what the word is in the bride
[12:12] even as he said glory to God so the word
[12:15] in the bride makes her a word Bride for
[12:19] this hour to unveil God and to be a part
[12:24] of the anointed word glory to God you
[12:27] not just a denominational word amen out
[12:30] there but you are a part for the
[12:32] revealed word they got the Bible but you
[12:34] are the revealed word they got the
[12:36] written word but you are the revealed
[12:38] word they got the dead letter but you
[12:40] are the Living Word the word lives in
[12:42] you that's how we say oh I serve a
[12:45] living God Amen why because God is now
[12:48] in flesh that's what makes him a living
[12:50] God he lives in you and me praise the
[12:52] Lord because I live you shall live
[12:56] also so we don't serve on ID but serve a
[12:59] living God hallelujah and he lives in
[13:03] you and I he was born in
[13:06] Bethlehem oh praise God and to be born
[13:09] in Bethlehem is to be born into the
[13:13] world Amen born in the world praise God
[13:18] now um I've been to Israel many times
[13:21] and brother Bill here several in the
[13:23] congregation and when we get there
[13:25] sometimes uh uh we're taken on a trip to
[13:28] the West bank and in the West Bank is
[13:31] Bethlehem right and we will go to
[13:34] Bethlehem and they would show us
[13:36] supposedly in a great Cathedral there
[13:39] the spot and the it's the very spot they
[13:43] claim on which Jesus was born and they
[13:45] just leave a small opening where people
[13:48] can just go and fear down because it's
[13:51] more really was a cave right and uh and
[13:54] they put a star on the spot to Mark the
[13:56] spot where Jesus laid but we don't know
[13:58] if that's the exact spot where he
[14:00] laid but the fact is this time of year
[14:04] where we are with Christmas traditions
[14:06] that they have out there thousands of
[14:09] tourists millions of them pour into
[14:12] Israel and they are
[14:15] everywhere and and and to be honest it's
[14:17] not different than the than going over
[14:21] there and turn yourself into a
[14:24] right now you know what that is
[14:26] that's when a Muslim visits uh
[14:29] um Mecca then he's titled a hat right
[14:33] that's what he comes and this honored
[14:36] position and honored name to to know
[14:39] that you visit Mecca but the Christians
[14:41] are doing the same
[14:42] [Music]
[14:43] thing they're literally going on the
[14:45] pilgrimage that Bethlehem and think
[14:48] that's going to make them
[14:49] Hol I walked on the very spot where
[14:53] Jesus
[14:55] walked I was at the very tomb where
[14:58] Jesus Jesus was and they have to put a
[15:01] steel barrier because some of them want
[15:03] to rush in the Tomb and lay on the the
[15:06] on the place there where the body was
[15:09] right they have to put up a steel
[15:10] barrier like a gate and everything else
[15:13] to block them out because they have this
[15:15] idea it's going to make them whole here
[15:18] it's just as much
[15:19] as um well let me pass that but the fact
[15:23] is they're going on pilgrimages and
[15:25] preparing to go to pilgrimages right
[15:28] straight to Bethlehem but they failed to
[15:32] recognize Bethlehem of today little
[15:35] Bethlehem of today is not a
[15:38] city it's not a city but it's your
[15:42] soul Liv Bethlehem is your soul where
[15:45] God has now come as sinful as we are
[15:49] messed up as some of us are you know uh
[15:52] you know God has come and found a
[15:55] resting place within our hearts amen
[15:59] hallelujah oh praise God what is it what
[16:02] did David say he says my soul my soul
[16:06] has found a resting place upon thy
[16:08] altars oh God Amen praise God even the
[16:11] sparrow found the resting place upon thy
[16:15] altars oh God and he has found the
[16:17] resting place in our hearts amen and
[16:20] this is little Bethlehem that we have
[16:22] here today by the grace of God and we
[16:26] have again you and I and we visited by
[16:30] our savior amen I have a visitation from
[16:34] God Amen why do you think you see the
[16:37] word because the Lord himself has come
[16:39] to you and visited you that's right amen
[16:43] Christ the word is born in you again
[16:48] recognize the song we normally sing
[16:50] sometimes let the word be BN with my
[16:56] heart amen praise the Lord we sing the
[16:59] song about the word being born again
[17:02] within our hearts and that is exactly
[17:05] what's happening the time when he came
[17:08] to be born he had to use a Virgin by the
[17:12] name of Mary to be able to get the flesh
[17:16] into which him the great spirit could go
[17:20] into and live so that people can see him
[17:23] on the earth is that right amen and that
[17:28] flesh to come through a virgin amen so
[17:32] he was virgin
[17:34] born but when he comes this time because
[17:37] the woman being in the scripture called
[17:39] the weak of vessel we as
[17:44] Sinners we did not control
[17:47] virgin but he had to come and redeem us
[17:51] first amen that's right so that when you
[17:54] are redeemed Justified Sanctified the
[17:57] Holy Spirit can and come into redeem the
[18:02] Flesh in other words it's not flesh that
[18:04] the priest tells that him it's okay for
[18:07] you to come now but he has redeemed you
[18:10] himself is that right he has washed us
[18:13] what in his Precious Blood himself so he
[18:17] knows when you are washed When you clean
[18:19] never mind what anybody else says no
[18:22] matter why you little stumbled and there
[18:25] if he has washed you he says then you're
[18:28] all right
[18:29] amen praise the Lord and now he comes in
[18:32] and he fills you with himself and he is
[18:35] the word praise the Lord I'm filled with
[18:38] the word you are filled with the word
[18:41] and the word Quicken is the Holy Spirit
[18:46] Wine I mean gra juice
[18:52] quick it it it it has it becomes Spirits
[18:55] right it becomes liquor and it has a
[18:59] kick to it it it has something that will
[19:02] make you move is that right glory to God
[19:06] but the thing about him he didn't even
[19:08] need gra
[19:09] juice he turned the water into wine is
[19:13] that right and that he was just showing
[19:15] that he's going to take the water of the
[19:18] word and pour it into you and I cuz
[19:23] that's typ the symbol of the man with
[19:25] the water Po in the Zodiac that's what
[19:28] it was it was that age where you pour
[19:30] the water of the word right into every
[19:32] one of us praise God and pour him and
[19:36] then turn that water into wine when you
[19:39] c a revelation the word that you've been
[19:41] reading and hearing even for years even
[19:43] the message that you've been following
[19:45] for years all of a sudden something
[19:46] clicks SP and there you go the water
[19:49] that was in you turn into wine and you
[19:52] feel an Impulse within your heart you
[19:55] feel aescent something pushing a a a
[19:59] pull a movement going on inside of
[20:01] Praise the Lord hallelujah oh praise God
[20:05] forever more God himself Anointed The
[20:09] Most Holy
[20:10] place that he might come and dwell in
[20:13] there like when he came down when
[20:15] Solomon prayed the purifying smoke came
[20:19] down because what God himself anointed
[20:22] that Holy place in which he was going to
[20:24] come and he offered a tabernacle glory
[20:27] to God and that's why you here anointed
[20:30] by the Holy Spirit anointed by the word
[20:33] of God Amen to receive him the savior of
[20:37] the world within the heart this is

[21:13] thing and it's great out there but they
[21:17] have to drink liquor to get in the state
[21:19] that we in amen is that right praise the
[21:22] lord we voluntarily coming here and we
[21:25] say oh come let us adore him
[21:29] or we sing oh little town of Bethlehem

[22:30] neighbor again and he repeats that cycle
[22:34] wait till the next Christmas again and
[22:36] then he goes back in the same state
[22:38] where he loves everybody because the
[22:40] influence of the drinks are upon him we
[22:42] don't have to wait for that we have the
[22:44] Holy Spirit that taught us to love our
[22:47] brothers our sisters our mother our
[22:49] father we we have the Holy Spirit that
[22:52] stimulates us every day praise the Lord
[22:55] if you stimulated I am amen amen glory
[22:59] to God hallelujah oh yes God's bread was
[23:05] born there in Bethlehem now being born
[23:09] in Christ we are then born of God in
[23:13] Bethlehem in Christ Jesus now sitting
[23:17] together in Heavenly places eating of he
[23:22] himself amen eating of him and who is he
[23:27] that we are eating we are eating the
[23:30] word that is the reason why he said
[23:33] except the man eat my flesh and drink my
[23:35] blood but they didn't understand it said
[23:37] this man is making us a but he was
[23:40] talking about them getting to understand
[23:42] or catch a revelation of the word that
[23:44] he was teaching them and they ought to
[23:46] Feast on that word and receive the Holy
[23:49] Spirit the quitting power within their
[23:51] hearts and life but they walked away
[23:53] from him because they didn't understand
[23:55] they thought he was telling them to
[23:56] drink literal blood and and to and to
[23:59] begin gwing on his bones and eat his
[24:02] flesh like that as Cannibal and the
[24:04] Bible says that uh around 580 of them
[24:08] because he had a lot of disciples other
[24:10] the first and second P walked away from
[24:13] him amen they walked right away from him
[24:16] you know that 580 of them left them left
[24:19] him because only 120 were in the Upp
[24:22] room amen and you'll find in the gospel
[24:25] it actually mentions the number that he
[24:27] had about 500 disciples at one time
[24:30] praise the Lord so here it is brothers
[24:33] that we are talking about little Bly
[24:36] hand you can only sit with one objective
[24:40] here the word of God and we are here to
[24:44] feed upon the word of God in God's
[24:49] spiritual Bethlehem eating God's
[24:51] spiritual bread that he gave us amen
[24:55] amen and we are enjoying this heaven
[24:59] angel food praise God this is Christmas
[25:03] you're eating Angel's food Hallelujah
[25:06] you know why can I say that because even
[25:08] Paul said that we are receiving things
[25:12] which even the angels were not permitted
[25:14] to look
[25:15] into can you imagine that the Angels
[25:18] were not permitted to look into this and
[25:21] God is breaking the seals to human
[25:23] beings God is opening your understanding
[25:26] to the word of God and you recognizing
[25:29] him why because it's between husband and
[25:31] wife amen and he is revealing to her
[25:35] it's for her it's not for the angels for
[25:37] her amen and revealed to her praise
[25:40] Goden a preach mess that many years ago
[25:44] how could you reveal it to them because
[25:45] they were never lost so they don't know
[25:47] what it is to be Sav amen they don't
[25:50] know what it is to be saved praise the
[25:52] Lord and they are servants we are Sons
[25:55] and Daughters amen they don't want to be
[25:58] a and a daughter they just know what it
[25:59] is to be a messenger in a servant so so
[26:02] those things could be revealed to them
[26:04] it had to be revealed to us amen because
[26:07] we are his children we are his wife
[26:10] praise the Lord and reveals the word of
[26:13] God to us amen how many of you brother
[26:17] bras in this hour in this season that
[26:20] we're living in are willing to forget
[26:23] your Traditions how many is willing to
[26:25] forget all them creeds amen that
[26:29] disagrees with the word all the all the
[26:31] people are worshiping under the way they
[26:34] are celebrating Christmas Xmas whatever
[26:36] they want to call it it's under the
[26:39] influence of
[26:41] creams it's under the influence of
[26:44] tradition I mean you know by now that
[26:48] these things are um where you have
[26:52] Listen to In the
[26:54] bible where you hear old
[26:59] ten you Wasing the tree and they got you
[27:02] was in the tree and you don't know ten
[27:04] bar means Christmas tree
[27:07] Christmas sing the tree right and you
[27:11] don't know what you're singing so that's
[27:12] why talk to you la too because you don't
[27:15] understand whatever they say you take it
[27:18] and you oh it's deep go but then the
[27:21] devil could be cursing you in Latin and
[27:23] you wouldn't even know could be swearing
[27:25] that you in Latin you wouldn't even know
[27:27] anything because you don't know
[27:28] so he got you singing old Tenon
[27:32] Canon and you singing about that washing
[27:35] in the tree which Jeremiah prophesied
[27:39] that the day will come when they're
[27:41] going to cut a tree from the forest and
[27:43] they going to put two pieces of wood
[27:45] Crossways nail the tree and the wood so
[27:48] that the the tree can stand up straight
[27:50] then he said they deck it with
[27:53] lights properly speaking from way back
[27:56] there and put all
[27:58] excuse me said all kinds of shiny things
[28:02] he saw on the street and they they
[28:05] worshiping the tree and behold that is
[28:08] the case what's going on right now glory
[28:11] to God a nothing wrong with you having a
[28:14] Christmas tree as long as you know it's
[28:15] just a tree amen it's nothing it don't
[28:18] mean nothing but if you even have the
[28:20] tree and you are ignorant of what it
[28:22] really represents it's just like me
[28:25] going to Africa and going go down and
[28:27] just buy one of those mask and go to
[28:30] India and buy one of The Masks of one of
[28:32] those gods or or China where they have
[28:35] those dragon mask buy one and put it in
[28:37] your house and you don't even know that
[28:39] some the witch doctors use those masks
[28:42] so they could call down the devil amen
[28:44] because they saw that demon in their
[28:46] vision and then they carve The Mask
[28:49] according to what they see so that they
[28:50] can ATT trct the devil to come on them
[28:52] and then speak through them and manifest
[28:55] himself through them and that's what
[28:57] they do so so these people I'm saying
[29:00] that these people without Revelation
[29:02] don't know how dangerous they're going
[29:04] and they're doing these things and
[29:06] calling down those kinds of spirits on
[29:09] them not recognizing what they're doing
[29:11] because the devil bring them into a
[29:13] religious atmosphere amen so they think
[29:16] it's all right because they're in a
[29:18] religious atmosphere the devil is
[29:20] religious
[29:21] himself fact he believes God more than
[29:24] many people do because Bible says the
[29:26] devil believes enough to tr
[29:29] some of them have enough Faith to even
[29:31] fear God with the stuff they're saying
[29:33] and how they're doubting you can't tell
[29:36] there is no God he will tell you to say
[29:38] there is no God but he will not tell you
[29:41] that there is no God because he knows
[29:43] there is a God and have to answer to
[29:45] that God when he comes to the End Amen
[29:48] that's why he always every time Jesus
[29:51] comes come to Tor me before the time so
[29:54] he know there's a Time Com when going be
[29:56] tormented and Fire is that right so so
[29:59] we know that so here we are looking at
[30:02] the word now forget the Traditions
[30:06] forget them treats and darkness why why
[30:10] haven't we got a
[30:14] Revival why haven't we got all them
[30:17] things of God going
[30:19] on what's the matter with
[30:22] Pentecost it's because they have
[30:25] organized
[30:26] themselves amen see you can't organize
[30:31] the true Pentecost amen you cannot make
[30:35] an organization of the true
[30:38] Pentecost because Pentecost is a
[30:42] blessing you believe
[30:44] that he said Pentecost is the power of
[30:48] God and if it is the genuine genuine
[30:52] pente it will never ever bypass the word
[30:57] for agreed amen praise the Lord so right
[31:02] away if you say oh I'm Pentecostal but
[31:05] you believe in Trinity then you're not
[31:09] genuine absolutely why there come a lot
[31:12] of false prophets all you think is a one
[31:15] man when the one man comes and just
[31:17] prophesy that's said the Lord that's the
[31:18] false prophet or or let's say I'm not
[31:21] calling him that but let's say benan or
[31:23] somebody like that you might say oh
[31:25] that's a false prophet no it's any body
[31:28] that goes contrary to the word amen is
[31:31] that right cuz a prophet is one who
[31:34] speaks from God testifies for God and
[31:37] when you testify wrong and on one hand
[31:40] you're getting miracles signs wonders
[31:44] healings and people falling on the
[31:46] ground claiming they have the Holy
[31:47] Spirit and then you turn around and
[31:50] you're talking about the Blessed
[31:52] Trinity and you're talking about three
[31:54] persons in one God then in Act fact
[31:58] you're a false prophet amen performing
[32:02] lying wonders amen you're a false
[32:05] prophet because you're speaking the word
[32:09] but the word of God you're speaking is
[32:11] false
[32:13] Doctrine and secondly the Wonders shall
[32:16] perform when a sign or a wonder is
[32:19] performed like brother said it's
[32:22] supposed to point to Christ amen you not
[32:26] to believe signs only is not not just
[32:28] the sign you to follow after but the
[32:31] sign should be pointing to Christ any
[32:33] sign board Point somewhere you don't sit
[32:36] on the sign post and think you have
[32:38] arrived because it says the way to
[32:40] London and and and points that way you
[32:42] sit at the sign post and say oh I right
[32:44] in l no you're not in L you got to
[32:47] follow go where the sign points to and
[32:50] if the sign is pointing in a wrong
[32:53] direction because some devil
[32:55] moved then uh if it's a lying
[33:00] sign see so if they on one hand they're
[33:04] getting healings wonders
[33:07] Mir but at the same time they're getting
[33:11] these signs but the same time they're
[33:13] telling you uh the Blessed Trinity and
[33:16] baptism is in the ti of Father Son and
[33:18] Holy Ghost you know that's a light one
[33:21] because it's pointing in the wrong
[33:23] direction when it should be pointing to
[33:25] Christ that Israel the Lord thy God is
[33:29] one Lord amen praise the Lord hallelujah
[33:33] oh yes sir a genuine
[33:36] Pentecost will but will never ever
[33:40] bypass the word and take a Creed it will
[33:44] always take the word amen amen so we are
[33:50] we are in Bethlehem candidates for the
[33:52] kingdom of God and we are feasting on
[33:55] the word and grow GR in eternal life
[34:00] amen praise the Lord eternal life is in
[34:02] you but you're growing into it you're
[34:04] getting used to it now you're getting
[34:06] climatized you get pressurized as you
[34:09] mooved right into this eternal life that
[34:13] God has given you amen see Bethlehem is
[34:17] the center of God's bread amen but it

[36:42] Hallelujah to have give us lifegiving
[36:46] Journey for our lifegiving journey
[36:49] praise the Lord from Earth to glory for
[36:51] our lifegiving journey think about it
[36:55] that the seals are open is not that
[36:58] simple but uh I'm not going to hold you
[37:00] uh too long tonight but Genesis 26 if
[37:03] you want to write it read uh write it
[37:05] down and read it at home Genesis 26
[37:09] from: 12- 25 it outlines the story of
[37:14] Isaac and how Isaac went back to wear
[37:18] Abraham
[37:20] was and when he was there the Bible says
[37:24] in Genesis
[37:26] 26 that he found Abraham had dug some
[37:30] wells now not all the types we know that
[37:33] you got them Church ages up there but uh
[37:36] Abraham had dug a bunch of wells and
[37:39] those Wells uh made him wealthy and was
[37:42] crushing with water water was always
[37:45] there but when uh Isaac got back there
[37:49] he found that the Philistines were so
[37:52] envious of him being Abraham's
[37:56] son that
[37:58] they stopped up the the
[38:01] wells they threw garbage they threw all
[38:04] kinds of rubbish and everything else
[38:06] inside of those wells until the wells
[38:09] were contaminated and stopped up and for
[38:13] years those Wells were like that because
[38:16] they wanted to block Isaac from getting
[38:18] to fresh water they blocked you I from
[38:22] getting to fresh water is that right but
[38:25] the Bible tells us that Isaac
[38:28] took his servants and he unstuck the
[38:30] wells amen hallelujah unplugged
[38:34] everything else and open them up so that
[38:36] the waters could flow again that is what
[38:39] the Lord Jesus Christ did for us for the
[38:41] opening of The Seven
[38:43] Seals he unsto every one of the wells so
[38:47] that the truth of the revealed word
[38:49] could flow down to us and a fountain is
[38:52] once again open in the House of David
[38:56] glory to God hallelujah
[38:58] oh my can you remember David how David
[39:02] was a fugitive one time and actually we
[39:06] were taken to that cave where David uh
[39:09] could have killed Saul and at the same
[39:12] time the guy was telling us he says from
[39:14] where where David was here you see uh
[39:18] right over the mountains and he showed
[39:21] us you have to climb over a high
[39:23] mountain not these Hills that we call
[39:26] mountains a real mountain he said it's
[39:28] about 18 miles to the other side to
[39:31] Bethlehem if if you wanted to really
[39:34] walk there you talking about ruged
[39:35] country brother there's no highways or
[39:38] nothing like that it's ruged country and
[39:41] hot sun and you know David being a
[39:44] fugitive from his own people a type of
[39:47] Christ he's a fugitive got to run from
[39:50] these churches because they will attack
[39:51] him at any time you bring them the word
[39:54] they attack the word you tell them the
[39:56] truth they attack the truth
[39:58] you try to open the word to show them
[40:00] something as long as they see him they
[40:02] want attack him so he's a fugitive from
[40:05] his own came to his own they received
[40:08] him not but as many as received them to
[40:10] them gave he the power to become the
[40:12] sons of God glory to God so David The
[40:17] Fugitive Christ The Fugitive knocking on
[40:19] the doors of his own church to get in to
[40:23] his own church and they won't let him in
[40:26] and he's a f fugitive going everywhere
[40:29] searching for a welcome heart that would
[40:32] receive him that he could place his word
[40:35] in there praise God but there was
[40:38] David and brother BR said David as a
[40:41] fugitive running he says hot hungry
[40:44] thirsty and he said David must have
[40:47] stopped and started to think of when he
[40:50] was young and uh would bring his
[40:53] father's sheep to the Wells of Bethlehem
[40:57] and how he would just rush to that uh
[41:00] well and drink the fresh clear clean
[41:04] cool
[41:06] water he said all the very s of it made
[41:10] David desired to have a drink of water
[41:14] from
[41:15] Bethlehem and uh in passing you know he
[41:18] just briefly said oh I wish I could get
[41:23] some of that cool fresh water from
[41:26] Bethlehem now
[41:28] brother Bram said but he didn't
[41:31] realize to his men that were with him
[41:34] brave men men of renown one of them
[41:38] jumped into a pit on a snowy day where a
[41:42] lion was trapped and went to there and
[41:44] fought the line and killed it man like
[41:47] that that were Brave he said when David
[41:50] spoke he just said oh you know I wish I
[41:52] could get a drink of water from that
[41:55] from Bethlehem again he said but he
[41:58] didn't realize his wish was their
[42:01] command amen and the Lord's wish is our
[42:05] Command is that right Hallelujah he
[42:08] didn't notice it but some of those men
[42:11] slipped away and when they slipped away
[42:15] they climbed over those mountains but
[42:17] brother Bron said it wasn't just walking
[42:18] up rugged mountains he said the
[42:21] Philistines were there and they fought
[42:24] their way 14 to 18 miles through the
[42:27] enemy back to back so the enemy can't
[42:30] get at them go down got the water put it
[42:34] in the you know the car it in skins if
[42:36] they T it on their back or their waist I
[42:38] don't know he says and he said the first
[42:41] time they might surprise them but the
[42:43] second time the Philistines know they're
[42:45] coming
[42:46] back and they're waiting for them praise
[42:50] the Lord and we are that group now
[42:52] because they had the first manic lost
[42:54] and that kind of shocked them but now
[42:57] know about us we coming the last Church
[43:00] AG now and the devil knows about us and
[43:02] destroying everything
[43:04] at amen some of you see K you back go
[43:08] your
[43:09] head he destroy everything he can at you
[43:13] because he knows now the church is
[43:16] coming back the bride is coming back oh
[43:18] glory to God and the Bible tells us
[43:21] despite the Philistines knowing that
[43:24] those men Drew their sword time for the
[43:26] reveal word and and CH their way through
[43:29] 18 miles of
[43:31] Philistines why because what brother
[43:34] brother Don rean preach a great message
[43:37] if you ever could get it off the site uh
[43:39] a drink for the
[43:41] king they brought back just one drink
[43:44] for the king glory to God hallelujah
[43:47] just so the king can have a drink glory
[43:49] to God God is Ling to see a lot of
[43:52] church rise up am a lot of people rise
[43:56] up amen in the power of the Holy Spirit
[43:59] yes Lord that can recognize their day
[44:01] and their hour and make the word
[44:05] manifested so that the public can know
[44:08] that we serve a living God that he's not
[44:11] dead but is alive forever
[44:14] more and it's not just some Spirit
[44:16] floing around but if he gets a body that
[44:19] can use that somebody that can surrender
[44:22] and let go and have his way that God
[44:24] will flow through them and work through
[44:25] them for his glory
[44:27] in other words we have to bring to them
[44:29] the reality that God lives that the Lord
[44:33] Jesus Christ lives and if he lives in
[44:36] nobody else he lives in me he lives in
[44:39] you and you must let the world know that
[44:42] that he lives in me praise be to God
[44:45] hallelujah how wonderful think about it
[44:48] we need man today like that see man that
[44:53] have an experience with god oh oh man
[44:58] who who's got experience not just

[45:11] devil they never they never had
[45:13] Supernatural experiences they can talk

[45:21] Supernatural experiences of their own to
[45:23] know God Amen praise the name of the
[45:26] Lord and that is what that devil was
[45:28] telling them sons of yeah Paul we know

[46:47] Christ here is represented both in David
[46:51] and in those men I've never seen this he
[46:54] said he is represented here as both King
[46:57] and
[46:59] Warrior because he cut his way through
[47:02] and broke through the Enemy Lines of
[47:05] death to bring us the Waters of eternal
[47:09] life for today is all right glory to God
[47:13] he bust through the enemies praise God
[47:16] to bring us the Waters of eternal life
[47:20] for today that we could drink glory to
[47:22] God hallelujah think about it now we
[47:27] didn't conquer
[47:29] anything he already conquered
