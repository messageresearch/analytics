[4:15] the spirit of living God moving in us
[4:17] and until our lives uh manifest his life
[4:21] and be a witness for his glory amen you
[4:24] know so many times I'm wiping this up
[4:27] now we may be so interested in Revival
[4:31] and we may believe in Revival we may
[4:33] believe in the movement of God's holy
[4:36] spirit across our lives we may even come
[4:39] together like this and be praying for it
[4:42] but are we really
[4:44] ready have a real book of God that's
[4:47] right that will consume your life your
[4:50] time your interest praise the Lord until
[4:54] you can't rest at night
[4:57] sometimes we call we ask for God to move
[5:00] but are we ready for any of that well
[5:03] you talk to God and tell him if you're
[5:06] ready for something like that
[5:10] amen are we saying Lord we want Revival
[5:13] but not like that uh we wanted our own
[5:18] way amen praise the the Lord praise God
[5:22] how would you feel the Holy Spirit would
[5:24] to break
[5:26] out manifest himself within the
[5:28] congregation so much
[5:31] until you're praying in the church and
[5:33] you hardly feel like leaving to go
[5:36] home and they have to be calling the
[5:38] police to find out where you are
[5:40] meanwhile you caught up in the spirit in
[5:42] the house of God in prayer and when they
[5:44] come to the front there and they hear
[5:45] noise and praying going on and so they
[5:48] want to know what's going on when they
[5:49] come in and see people staggering around
[5:52] think there a bunch of drunks they have
[5:53] to arrest amen and even the women drunk
[5:56] to you know normally they come and
[5:58] arrest the men but all the the women and
[5:59] the men all Trump cry but it was not
[6:02] trumpet wine the Holy Spirit the Living
[6:05] God hallelujah amen praise God glory to
[6:08] God I believe now as in closing that God
[6:10] is meeting with Christians
[6:12] today and filling us with the spirit of
[6:16] those Apostolic times now praise the
[6:20] Lord uh so what does the future hold for
[6:23] us Brothers we know that the future
[6:25] holds the
[6:26] Rapture that's for certain the future
[6:29] holds the Rapture and holds the ending
[6:33] of the ages amen all the ending of the
[6:37] ages right through the Millennium we
[6:39] know the rest of it we're not going to
[6:41] be in that but God has given us uh uh
[6:44] knowledge of the future things right
[6:47] that we might know praise the Lord
[6:49] hallelujah so uh let us prepare Hearts
[6:52] but like we said I think of touched on
[6:54] this before if you prepare for move move
[6:57] of God prepare for persecution also
[6:59] that's right if you prepare for the
[7:01] power of God prepare to get some
[7:02] persecution also because the two always
[7:06] go together the apostles preach in the
[7:08] streets the power of God come down and
[7:09] the Pharisees are always there to try to
[7:12] arrest them or stop them the devil is
[7:14] going to work through his Messengers
[7:16] while God is working through his
[7:18] Messengers so let's be prayerful Let's
[7:20] Be watchful and let's unite your hearts
[7:24] in prayer whether you're in the house of
[7:25] God or you're in your home seeking him
[7:28] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[7:31] amen they believed in the Holy Spirit
[7:35] but most of the people
[7:37] today are afraid of the real Holy
[7:40] Spirit that's the
[7:43] truth and I can understand to a certain
[7:46] degree because I've been in a
[7:49] room
[7:51] praying praying all
[7:54] day and towards the evening
[7:57] time and I have witness that was there
[8:02] and while we were praying there all of a
[8:05] sudden the room started to fill up with
[8:07] a supernatural
[8:09] presence with our eyes
[8:11] closed we both open our eyes because we
[8:14] felt the same
[8:17] thing
[8:19] something was about to happen in that
[8:23] room and the next thing that we
[8:26] know the door that we have locked
[8:29] so that we W be disturbed at prayer that
[8:33] door
[8:34] opened started moving like this but by
[8:38] that time God helped you or I don't know
[8:42] if my hair was standing straight like
[8:44] wire on my head I had L here those were
[8:47] the
[8:48] after you know you don't know if your
[8:51] hair was standing like wire in your head
[8:53] brother Danny people said oh I got the
[8:56] Goosebumps that was way Beyond
[8:58] Goosebumps
[9:02] neither one of us could even talk to one
[9:04] another we were just transfixed and just
[9:06] BRAC and holding on like this with with
[9:09] your eyes all staring like that because
[9:12] we know something is going to happen but
[9:14] you know what it's just like if that
[9:16] person or presence knew they're not able
[9:18] to take this now and you feel it start
[9:21] to ease off until it came right back to
[9:25] normal and then we start looking at one
[9:28] mother and later on
[9:29] we were out of there area praise the
[9:32] name of the Lord I don't know if we went
[9:34] back there to pray
[9:38] again so what I'm saying is one thing
[9:41] when we start to ask for a move of God
[9:44] we even in your house and I'm telling
[9:47] you you get in your house in your
[9:50] bedroom even lock the door and you start
[9:53] to
[9:55] pray as I have felt somebody come sit on
[9:58] the
[9:59] man like they're just sitting there to
[10:02] listen to what I'm praying praise the
[10:05] Lord hallelujah what would you do
[10:10] then but I'm just telling you these
[10:12] things so that even if something similar
[10:16] like that
[10:17] happen I can't say don't be afraid it's
[10:20] human brother Brown said that your flesh
[10:23] coming in contact with the Supernatural
[10:25] is what does that that's why he got used
[10:27] to get weak but he will get that way
[10:30] above us he would just get so weak he
[10:34] just couldn't handle Daniel col 21 days
[10:37] he was
[10:38] sick praise God so brothers let's
[10:42] prepare for the wave of the holy spirit
[10:45] amen amen and um let's ask ourselves is
[10:50] my life making an impact is it touching
[10:53] the Liv of others for the glory of God
[10:57] am I a channel that God God is able to
[11:00] work true in this last
[11:02] day let me surrender my all and offer
[11:05] myself to him that he will take me and
[11:08] use me for his glory the musici Come As
[11:11] we sing every one or two verses from an
[11:14] old hymn that brother Brandon himself
[11:20] loved praise the
[11:25] Lord
[11:27] amen
[11:29] it's when the PO of fire touch the
[11:39] prophet
