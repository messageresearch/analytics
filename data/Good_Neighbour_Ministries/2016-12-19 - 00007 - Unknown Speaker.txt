TRANSCRIPT
========================================
When the one that's rejecting this message today will ask to give a reason. What then? What do you want to say then? What then? [Music] What then? When the great book is open. What then? And the ones that's rejecting this message today will be ask to give a reason. [Music] Our gracious God and heavenly father, I've done my part. I minister the word of God to your people. all these that are under the voice of God or the influence of the sound of the gospel. Father, may your great spirit go forth to this congregation and speak into the heart of someone that has been thinking about it and knows that they need to turn their life around. They know that they need to be baptized the right way. Not in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. One God, one name, one baptism, one faith, one fellowship. Father, young people that have been struggling with temptation, trouble, trial, tested by their friends. Oh God, speak to them today. Call them by this message. Just before I hand over to the worship lady, Father, I want to pray for them and with them. Lord Jesus, give them the strength to resist the devil who is going to try to block and stop them and tell them you don't have to do that. Father, give them the opportunity, Lord, to overcome the law of gravity and raise even one hand so that I can have an idea that I need to pray for them in this congregation. Now, those of you who are here today and somehow God's spirit has spoken to you that you need a closer walk with God or you need to know him in a in a relationship with him. Would you slip your hand up right now while I say a word of prayer? I see hands up everywhere. Amen. Praise God. I'm glad we're not ashamed of him. I'll never be ashamed of him. Father God, I thank you this today, this this day for these hands of the rough raised a dozen or more. Father, it's not the raising of our hands, but it's the obedience to your word and the acknowledgment that there is something that this soul needs today. And I ask that your great Holy Spirit will minister to them right now whatever that need is and speak to that need. Father, help that young person. Deliver them. Father, break any habit. [Music] Heal every one of us. Whether the deed is natural, spiritual, supernatural, Satan, come out from amongst the people. Amen. Lose their lives and stop trying to shackle them so that they can't hardly even repent. They can't hardly give their life to God because you you're trying to stop their fountain, stop their their their inclination when they know they need to change their lives. Father, I call upon you today in the name of Jesus Christ. This may be your last chance. This could be your last autumn call. We had somebody in here just a few weeks ago sitting right in the back. God blessed her heart. She was a believer. We all rejoiced together. We talked. I went out. I had supper with them. Left and came back not knowing that was the last time I was ever going to see them or see that person. Let me tell you, God has no respector for a person. You see your wife young. Uh let me tell you, grace come in all sizes. And when you hear God speaking to you and you don't obey the voice of God, God will set your field on fire. God will bring affliction. God will bring signs. He'll bring things in your life to let you know that you are resisting his will and not responding to the Holy Spirit of Almighty God. And I'm here as a servant to warn you. Amen. And those of you who are here backst from the word back to the word. Hallelujah. Your place is in church. Your place is in the house of God. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. And those who should have been here this morning and they're not here. When we're here discussing, you recognize God is speaking to you and calling out to you. Back to the word, back to your position. Yes, Lord. You want to be baptized in water, not just to believe, but say, "Lord, I now want to belong. I want to know truly that this is my home church. I want to support it with my presence. I want to support it in every other way. Whether it's be with my faith, prayer, finances, whatever, I want to support it." Then acknowledge it. Don't be ashamed. Acknowledge it. And if you feel God is speaking to you and you want to be baptized in water, say, "Lord, I want to be changed and I want to be baptized in water." And seal myself in to say, "I have one of them." Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Then see one of the deacons or trustees and say, "Brother, I have made this decision. I want to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." Amen. And God knows your heart. I'm not a pre Catholic priest that you have to come and confess to me. But there's a great high priest here. His name is the Lord Jesus Christ. And you can speak to him from in the closet of your heart and he will hear you and he will answer your prayers and give you the desire of your heart. You know, praise the Lord. I'm waiting. You know why I'm waiting? until the Holy Spirit tell you to stop because he's pleading here for somebody that's in this congregation here today. And I hope you will obey the voice of God in this hour. Amen. Praise be to God. Once in the stillness of a late midnight hour, I felt the sweet presence [Music] of the Lord's saving power. I fell on my knees and I cried to him there. Oh merciful Savior, [Music] hear a lost sinner's prayer. Well, every hour [Music] and every day, in every moment, in every way, I'm leaning on Jesus. He is the rock of my soul. I'm singing his praisees. Wherever once in the stillness of a late midnight hour might be a midnight hour for you friends. I don't know. But we we serve a God that can bring you leftour deliverance and take you out of your situation just before the devil tries to swallow you alive. come while there is yet time to come and surrender your heart to him now. Father, I pray for these that should obey your word and may still be resisting. For those who raise their hands and obey the spirit's call, I pray that you will honor their faith. For those others that are in between, may the great Holy Spirit continue to deal with them and convict and haunt them long after they've left this place. May they hear the voice of God speaking in their ears. You know that you should have obeyed that call. You know that you should have repented. You know that you should have changed your life. to walk the right way and separate yourself from the things of the past. Oh God, may your spirit continue to speak and deal with them long after I've left this pulpit and they've gone away from this place and trying to forget it. Oh God, seal it away in their soul. Father, let them know the power of apostolic faith and power. Not by might nor by power, but by your spirit, say the Lord. Thank you, Father. Take all the praise and the honor and the glory from this service here today in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. God richly bless every one of you. I want to know that my heart and my hands are clean. Because the Bible says, son of man, if you warn them and they don't heal, then their blood was on their own head. But if you don't warn them, their blood is going to be on your hands. I warned you, young and old, high and low, rich and poor. are warned you according to the word that God seems like he was giving at last the call to somebody here today. He warning and obey the call. Amen. God bless you. God bless you. [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Oh, [Music] heat, heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
