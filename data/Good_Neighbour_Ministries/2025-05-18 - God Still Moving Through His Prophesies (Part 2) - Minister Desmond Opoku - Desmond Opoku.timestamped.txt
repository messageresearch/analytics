[34:32] forgiveness of sins, who is the image of
[34:36] the invisible
[34:38] God, the first born of every
[34:42] creature. For by him were all things
[34:46] created that are in heaven and that are
[34:51] in earth, visible and invisible. Whether
[34:56] they be thrones or dominions or
[35:00] principities or
[35:02] powers, all things were created by him
[35:06] and for
[35:07] him. That is the God that we

[35:57] blood of the cross. by him to reconcile
[36:01] all things unto himself. By him I say,
[36:05] whether be the anything,
[36:08] whether they be things in earth or
[36:11] things in heaven, and you that were
[36:15] sometimes
[36:17] alienated and enemies in
[36:20] all enemies in your mind by wicked
[36:23] works, yet now had he reconciled.
[36:29] Amen. In the body of his flesh through
[36:32] death to represent you holy and
[36:38] unraable and unprovable in his sight. If
[36:43] you continue in the faith
[36:47] grounded and settled and by and be not
[36:51] moved away from the hope of the gospel
[36:55] which ye have heard and which were
[36:58] preached to every creature which is
[37:00] under
[37:01] heaven. Wherefore I Paul I am a
[37:05] minister who now rejoice in my suffering
[37:09] for you. Paul rejoiced in his suffering
[37:12] for who? Me and you. He didn't suffer
[37:16] for himself by through the word of God.
[37:20] Hallelujah.
[37:22] So don't think you're going to get it
[37:26] easy. When you are serving God, it's not
[37:29] easy. Hallelujah. That's why he's
[37:31] telling us. Amen.
[37:36] Who now rejoice in my suffering for you
[37:40] and fill up that which is behind of the
[37:43] affliction of Christ in my flesh for his
[37:47] body's sake which is the church.
[37:50] Wherefore I am made a minister according
[37:52] to the dispensation of God which is
[37:55] given to me for you to fulfill the word
[37:58] of God. Hallelujah. Even the mystery
[38:02] which had been held which has been hid
[38:05] from ages and from generations. But you
[38:07] but now is made manifest to the saints
[38:11] to his saints to whom God would make
[38:14] known what is the riches of the glory of
[38:18] his mystery among the Gentiles which is
[38:22] in Christ in you and hope of glory. who
[38:26] ye preach warning every man and teaching
[38:30] every man in all wisdom that we may
[38:34] present every man perfect in Christ
[38:36] Jesus. Where unto I also labor striving
[38:41] according to his working which is
[38:44] workketh in me mighty. May the Lord add
[38:48] his blessing to the reading of his word.
[38:50] You may be seated. Hallelujah.
[38:56] Um, we know about Paul, I I'm going to,
[39:00] this is the part two of my message. God
[39:05] is still moving through his
[39:09] prophecies. God is still moving through
[39:13] his prophecies. So, we're going to go
[39:15] and see what kind of prophecy are we
[39:19] fulfilling? Are we moving right now?
[39:22] Hallelujah. I just I'm not I'm not a a a
[39:27] big preacher. I'm just a your brother, a
[39:30] deacon in the church. I'm just God by
[39:33] the grace of God I standing here to
[39:36] share the word of God with you. So
[39:38] everybody have patience. I'm not a
[39:41] educated person where I can go through
[39:44] computer with my hand and search and
[39:46] bring it out and give it to you. I just
[39:49] tells you what God has placed in my
[39:52] heart. And God I'm just telling you God
[39:55] is real.
[39:58] Hallelujah. Right now I'm standing here.
[40:00] I know what I went through before I
[40:03] stood
[40:04] here because Satan did not like us. Let
[40:09] me tell you, Satan did not like us to
[40:13] hear the word of God. you sometime you
[40:17] have to go through
[40:18] pain exactly what Paul was saying
[40:22] exactly what I'm I'm going
[40:25] through what Paul said he's suffering
[40:29] for you for the word of God that's
[40:32] exactly as I'm standing here that's what
[40:35] I'm going through but nothing can stop
[40:38] the word of God not even no death
[40:42] hallelujah because he hold the
[40:45] earth. He holds all the power and the
[40:48] power is within us. He gave us all the
[40:52] power. That's why we sing the song. I
[40:54] was very glad. There is power in the
[40:57] blood. There's power in the saints.
[41:00] Hallelujah. You have a power to generate
[41:03] anything that you can do right now.
[41:05] Hallelujah. I feel good in the presence
[41:07] of God. Amen.
[41:10] You know, when we talk about
[41:13] Paul, Paul was a as I just recap a
[41:16] little thing that I said about last
[41:21] Wednesday. Paul wasn't his name was Saul
[41:26] before and after God called him, he
[41:29] changed his name.
[41:31] Paul Paul wasn't a
[41:34] Christian but he has something inside of
[41:38] him that he love God. There's a seed
[41:42] inside of
[41:43] Paul. So Paul was zerous about God and
[41:47] all what he learned about God is what
[41:51] from the Sanhedrin the rabbi that's why
[41:54] he was protecting.
[41:57] He wasn't doing that thing from his
[42:01] heart. You know, Paul master was
[42:06] Griia and Griia was a
[42:10] Sanhedrin and he was a
[42:12] rabbi and that man was
[42:15] so so learned at the same time he was a
[42:20] lawyer.
[42:22] So he
[42:24] missed
[42:26] tradition of their religion. How Moses
[42:29] brought them from Egypt to
[42:33] Israel. He mixed
[42:36] that with the law and the tradition and
[42:40] he taught Paul. So they were always
[42:43] defending
[42:45] God by their traditions and their law,
[42:49] their natural wisdom. But who can defend
[42:53] God? Nobody can defend God. God is God.
[42:58] Amen. When he speak, he speak.
[43:01] Hallelujah. And I always said God speak
[43:04] once. What God said from the beginning
[43:07] is still right here, right now. Amen.
[43:11] Amen. He never change.
[43:15] So that's why he said you cannot add you
[43:20] cannot take what I said is what I said.
[43:25] So if you listen to the
[43:29] message you are responsible to check by
[43:34] the word of God. Yes, very very
[43:37] important because man can make mistake
[43:42] but God does not make mistake.
[43:45] And if your heart even Abraham said if
[43:49] the congregate if the pastor himself is
[43:53] of the word and the congregation
[43:58] heart their heart is pure, God will turn
[44:02] and change the pastor heart and bring
[44:05] the real word of God because you have
[44:10] power in you that you can change so many
[44:13] things. Hallelujah.
[44:16] Let me tell you, you have to be happy.
[44:18] Even in pain, in suffering, God knows
[44:23] everything about you. God will never
[44:27] leave you. He said it. I will never
[44:29] leave you nor forsake you. I will be
[44:32] with you even till the end of this
[44:35] world. Hallelujah. So there's no ways
[44:39] can God ever depart from you. Amen. When
[44:42] you are sleeping, when you are at work,
[44:45] when you are driving, hallelujah, he's
[44:48] always around you. Amen. Just call him
[44:52] and he will draw nigh unto thee. You
[44:54] remember he did to the the brethren when
[44:56] they were walking through the emas.
[44:59] While they were talking, the Bible said
[45:02] he draw
[45:04] n and went home with them. Not that he
[45:08] just be with them. He draw n and went
[45:11] home with them and even sat down and eat
[45:16] bread with
[45:18] them. He did for them. What about
[45:22] you? There's nothing that God can ever
[45:26] hinder
[45:27] you. Just let your heart be
[45:30] pure and believe in
[45:33] him. Praise the Lord. So this this this
[45:39] Paul Sanhedrin man the the rabbi what he
[45:44] taught him he bring a persecution
[45:47] through
[45:48] Paul cuz Paul because you know why the
[45:53] Jews fail to look to the Bible because
[45:57] Bible is a book of
[45:59] prophecies and always God is working God
[46:04] never stop. So if you stop while we are
[46:08] worshiping God and and if you stop and
[46:10] you not coming to church, don't think
[46:12] God will stop for you. He's keep on
[46:15] going.
[46:16] He's keep on going with those who are
[46:19] remain behind and working with them.
[46:23] Hallelujah. So nobody can stop God work.
[46:27] Hallelujah. It's your responsibility to
[46:31] know the God that you serve. Amen. The
[46:34] trials can never let you let you let you
[46:38] uh to depart from God. No, sometime a
[46:42] test come you have to prove you have
[46:45] passed through a test before you can get
[46:47] a testimony.
[46:49] Amen. Without a test you cannot get
[46:52] testimony.
[46:53] Oh
[46:55] hallelujah. I believe even right now
[46:58] brother Kofi has a testimony. Amen. what
[47:01] he went through. Nobody knows. Only him
[47:04] knows.
[47:06] By the power of almighty Jehovah.
[47:09] Hallelujah. We have a God that we serve.
[47:13] I am so blessed and I'm so happy to be a
[47:16] Christian. Let me tell you, Christianity
[47:19] is one of the best Yes, sir. that God
[47:23] can ever give it to you. It doesn't
[47:25] matter what anybody said. Look, if they
[47:28] cutting your head, just close your eye
[47:31] as the dam of inquisition. They know
[47:34] that God is God. They
[47:37] stood and they beheaded. Paul was
[47:41] beheaded and Paul was the one who wrote
[47:43] this Bible. Glory to God. My brother, my
[47:47] my brethren, if God has opened your eye
[47:50] to see the glory of God, especially in
[47:54] this message, you are the blessed people
[47:57] in the face of the earth. Hallelujah.
[48:00] Not everybody can take.
[48:04] Hallelujah. You know, you know they have
[48:07] a they have a a like a a magnet.
[48:13] See magnet take
[48:16] steel. See magnet this is
[48:19] magnet. Any steel that magnet
[48:24] attract attract it will draw that steel
[48:29] to that magnet. I'm going to read
[48:31] something for you about brother Abraham
[48:33] talk about
[48:34] magnet. Hallelujah. Just bear with me
[48:38] this morning. I am happy to be here.
[48:41] Amen.
[48:42] Thank you Jesus. But have patient with
[48:45] me. I'm not I told you I'm not a a a a a
[48:49] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[48:50] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[48:50] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[48:50] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[48:50] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[48:50] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a big
[48:50] preacher. I'm just a brother. So I'm
[48:53] just a I'm just minister what God has
[48:55] placed in my heart. So if I make
[48:57] mistake, forgive me. Praise the Lord.
[49:00] Let's see this the Easter Seal will
[49:07] mar5. Hallelujah. Paragraph 76.
[49:11] Let's talk about how we talk about
[49:13] magnet. You see, you see these things
[49:16] here. You see this is this was drawn by
[49:20] brother Simon, pastor Simon, our former
[49:23] pastor, you see the son of man. And if
[49:26] you see Paul, the the up there have a
[49:29] light. You see that light around it? The
[49:32] same light is in the bottom
[49:35] too. I think is this was drawn by
[49:37] inspiration.
[49:39] See when the light throw down all the
[49:42] way down
[49:43] there. See inside all of the the light
[49:46] is coming through to the bottom. The
[49:50] bottom is the Gentiles where God started
[49:52] his ministry for the Gentiles. We are
[49:55] the Gentiles.
[49:56] Hallelujah. God started the ministry in
[50:02] Israel and after he
[50:05] stopped for a while so that he has to do
[50:09] with the Gentiles then after he go back
[50:12] to him them and finish the job over
[50:15] there. So God put that light over there.
[50:19] So you know where you put a light while
[50:21] the light is going it started
[50:23] spreading and this light here is
[50:26] reflecting the whole world for the
[50:30] Gentiles. So
[50:33] God that light is like a
[50:37] magnet right now. The Holy Ghost is that
[50:41] light. The Holy Ghost is the magnet
[50:44] throwing that magnet to the whole world.
[50:47] So every child of God that is in the in
[50:51] in this word here for the Gentiles, not
[50:55] the
[50:56] Jews, is throwing like
[50:59] that. So anybody who has the seed of God
[51:03] in him, when that life goes like that,
[51:08] it pick them up. Amen. And when that
[51:11] magnet picked that that thing out,
[51:14] nothing can take that magnet. Nothing
[51:16] can take that steel that stuck to the
[51:19] magnet out. Nobody. The only way it can
[51:23] get out is when the magnet is mixed with
[51:27] any rubber or
[51:29] anything. It cannot stick. You're going
[51:31] to fall down. So no child of God will
[51:35] fall down from that holy spirit that
[51:39] magna that's coming down through the
[51:40] por. So right now you see the all the
[51:44] ages arius Martin and Luther Columbbo
[51:49] Columbbo Luther and Wesley and William
[51:51] Abraham that that magnet every age that
[51:56] Holy Ghost a pickup
[51:59] and meanwhile God is moving God never
[52:03] stop that's why he started there he's
[52:05] moving he's taking them to him so now we
[52:10] see that we are getting very short. So
[52:12] we see where Abraham is now. We are no
[52:15] more where is we are in the the blue one
[52:17] the Holy Spirit there right there.
[52:20] That's where we are
[52:22] now. It's getting smaller. That means we
[52:24] are we are almost home. Almost home. He
[52:29] pick up every every seed that from from
[52:33] Paul to uh from to he pick up every one
[52:37] of them. So we are all stuck together
[52:39] inside that magnet there. Let me tell
[52:42] you about let me read here the way back
[52:45] in the way the way back in the
[52:49] back. He touched a little button and
[52:53] there came a big magnet through and he
[52:57] picked up every bit of that iron that
[53:00] was shave off of those pieces now and
[53:06] went out. It it
[53:11] uh demagnet demagnetized it demagnetized
[53:15] it and dropped into a cup capola and was
[53:20] melted over for another piece of of
[53:25] goods and same same thing the same thing
[53:30] axles or whatever they were building and
[53:35] I stood there and look at back till I I
[53:39] I till I I I just lost myself and I said
[53:44] I am wondering something. He said what
[53:47] is it
[53:49] sir? And I I said I noticed that some of
[53:55] that didn't go up. He said it's
[53:58] aluminum.
[54:00] Aluminum cannot get
[54:04] magnet and the magnet is not magnetized
[54:08] to the
[54:10] aluminum. I said I see and he said then
[54:14] I said where you notice there is a piece
[54:18] of iron laying across but you
[54:22] see sir it was bolted
[54:26] down. I said, "I
[54:29] see." And when he took it out, I said,
[54:33] "Now what
[54:35] happens that out
[54:38] there?" Say, says it goes right back
[54:41] into the mail. Pour out through the capa
[54:46] and come right back and make another
[54:49] wheel. I said, "Praise the Lord." That's
[54:52] it. I see. That's it.
[54:55] See, there is a great magnet setting in
[54:58] the sky that God one day will touch his
[55:03] finger to. No man knows the time he's
[55:07] coming. Not even the angels of heaven.
[55:10] Doesn't know. Doesn't know. God alone
[55:14] knows. But there was there has been some
[55:18] time trimmings that come come off of the
[55:24] Bible Bible Christians believers for the
[55:28] for this hour. One of them might have
[55:31] been an axle back and another
[55:35] day this might be some other part is
[55:40] going on on to make is going on to make
[55:44] the big regime of God but it all be
[55:49] molded into the port of God great capola
[55:53] and poured out again into the image of
[55:57] God and Just those when uh and just
[56:02] those who are
[56:04] magnetized to it will be taken up. You
[56:08] hear that?
[56:11] Hallelujah. Those who are magnet
[56:13] magnetized to it, those who are stuck
[56:17] with the Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost is a
[56:20] magnet. Hallelujah. That's a spirit of
[56:25] God. Thank you, Lord.
[56:30] those who are magnized to it to be taken
[56:33] up. Oh, how to what a privilege it is to
[56:37] know that there is something in the
[56:41] resurrection that's pertaining to us.
[56:45] Now
[56:46] notice recognize the call of God words
[56:50] which is part
[56:52] of who is part of and it is an eagle to
[56:57] an eagle. Now if the if that mother
[57:03] would have screamed like a a
[57:06] buzzard he would have never known it. He
[57:10] being just as well off of Byard, but it
[57:16] was the scream of an
[57:21] eagle. There was nothing inside that
[57:25] little fellow that he knowed he was not
[57:29] an eagle. He was an he was an eagle.
[57:32] Knows that he was an sorry. And the same
[57:35] thing is with every true believer. When
[57:39] the preaching of God's word comes forth
[57:42] and is vindicated and proved that go
[57:45] prove God's word for this hour, then
[57:49] there is something within the believer.
[57:52] Hallelujah. I don't care how loyal his
[57:55] father was to the church or how loyal
[57:59] his mother was or his grandparents. And
[58:02] if that which church is teaching
[58:05] contrary contrary to this hour of the
[58:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost message, there
[58:11] is something in him that screams out he
[58:15] will leave the
[58:17] boneyard. Hallelujah. He got to do it.
[58:21] The chicken must have been all right one
[58:24] day, but this is eagle hour. See it is
[58:29] the it is
[58:31] different. There is something that there
[58:35] is something that he must leave the old
[58:38] coupe and fly away into the blue. Then
[58:43] this earthly body is quickened and
[58:45] brought by the quickened spirit and the
[58:48] obedience to the word of God.
[58:51] Hallelujah. Now when this holy spirit
[58:54] represent as the eagle flying over the
[58:57] land the fields of the believer. Now no
[59:02] man can make to no man can come to me.
[59:06] No man can come to me but no man can
[59:10] come to me by himself. It is it isn't
[59:14] your own thinking your own drawing. It
[59:18] is God drawing. See all the father has
[59:21] given me will come to me. Amen.
[59:26] So all the father every steel that is on
[59:32] the ground if that magnet hit on the
[59:36] ground every
[59:38] steel every steel will draw near into
[59:42] that magnet. It doesn't matter what kind
[59:46] of even if the steel is rusted, it will
[59:49] still attract to the magnet. So far as
[59:52] is still. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[59:58] Amen.
[1:00:01] So that's exactly what happened. You see
[1:00:04] the the Jews they fail to to see to look
[1:00:09] to the prophecies. So when one day
[1:00:12] because God knows poor heart and Paul
[1:00:16] was Paul has a seed in
[1:00:19] him. God he
[1:00:22] attracted that magnet where he was going
[1:00:26] to persecute the brethren and the God
[1:00:29] said it's enough or your time is over.
[1:00:33] Why they taught you from your mind the
[1:00:35] greatest mind the learning everything
[1:00:38] even more even some days even kinria
[1:00:41] says s Paul you are you are learning is
[1:00:43] driving you crazy but he thought he
[1:00:47] didn't know that po God has taken all
[1:00:49] those kind of learning law and
[1:00:52] everything persecution away from him now
[1:00:54] Paul became a new
[1:00:56] person as you sitting here before you
[1:00:59] were not like that as I said last unit
[1:01:02] before. Hey, I have a bushy hair. That's
[1:01:06] where the world want. So, I have to be
[1:01:09] like the world and
[1:01:12] handsome. I attract everything
[1:01:15] everything in the
[1:01:16] world. But when God call me, all these
[1:01:19] things drop like Paul. So, do you you
[1:01:24] were not the same when you came to the
[1:01:27] the message. You were not the
[1:01:30] same. There's a big change in your life.
[1:01:34] That's why I sing that song. Great
[1:01:38] change since I was born. Great change
[1:01:43] since I was born. Great change since I
[1:01:49] was born. Been a great change since I
[1:01:52] was born. The things I used to do, I
[1:01:56] can't no more. Things I used to do, I do
[1:02:00] them no more. Things that the prison
[1:02:03] used to go, I go there no more. Been a
[1:02:07] great change since I was
[1:02:10] Yes, I was no good. But thank God, he
[1:02:16] changed my life. Who am
[1:02:19] I? I was no good. But God rich in
[1:02:24] mercy, he called me. And when I came I
[1:02:28] somebody told me brought me here but it
[1:02:30] wasn't the time I went back. When God
[1:02:34] called me back there he call me through
[1:02:38] his
[1:02:39] word. He didn't call me by the time the
[1:02:42] first time he called me he called me. He
[1:02:44] spoke to my
[1:02:45] heart and when he spoke to my heart I
[1:02:48] came I couldn't go back no more. When
[1:02:51] God call you you cannot return back. But
[1:02:55] if somebody take your hand and brought
[1:02:57] and bring you here, you can go
[1:03:00] back. But if God call you, you cannot go
[1:03:05] back. You cannot go back. You have
[1:03:08] nowhere to go. You have nowhere to go.
[1:03:11] I'm telling you this morning, even if
[1:03:14] your heart you want to get out, you
[1:03:16] cannot go because you are attracted to
[1:03:19] the that magnet and that magnet will
[1:03:22] never leave you.
[1:03:23] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. The
[1:03:27] word of God is true. Paul never quit
[1:03:31] back. I can see some preachers preach so
[1:03:34] many years and they said they're
[1:03:36] quitting from the word that God has
[1:03:38] given to them. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:03:42] Jesus.
[1:03:44] Nobody can quit from God. If God calls
[1:03:47] you, he calls you. He calls you once and
[1:03:49] for all. God speak once and when he
[1:03:51] speak once it's for all all the time.
[1:03:54] Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. Blessed be
[1:03:57] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Be
[1:04:00] happy. Enjoy your salvation that God has
[1:04:03] given to you. Enjoy that salvation God
[1:04:06] has given to you. He gave it to you by
[1:04:09] himself. No man gave you that salvation.
[1:04:13] Hallelujah. If I if I give it to you, I
[1:04:16] can take from because I'm a man. If you
[1:04:18] do something against me and I get mad, I
[1:04:20] can take from you. But God give it to
[1:04:23] you. Nobody can take it away from you.
[1:04:26] Every healing is yours.
[1:04:29] Hallelujah. Everything that you desire
[1:04:31] in your heart is yours. Nobody can take
[1:04:33] it away from you because God has given
[1:04:36] to you.
[1:04:38] Hallelujah. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. I am
[1:04:42] happy this morning to stand here and
[1:04:45] minister the word of God this morning.
[1:04:48] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:04:52] Hallelujah. Amen. I'm sorry about my
[1:04:55] ashes, but I have no control of myself.
[1:04:58] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Amen.
[1:05:02] Glory to God.
[1:05:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:05:09] I was working one day and this
[1:05:13] woman in my my my my neighbor, brother
[1:05:16] Gabriel knows
[1:05:18] them. And I saw him standing outside
[1:05:20] smoking. And I went to him, I said, "If
[1:05:25] you don't stop smoking, you will never
[1:05:28] see to leave your children to see you
[1:05:32] will never live to see your children,
[1:05:35] the children that you love.
[1:05:38] And I
[1:05:39] left about three months. Three months
[1:05:43] later, he went he went and the doctor
[1:05:47] said, "You have breast cancer."
[1:05:50] Hallelujah. Now he's craving for life.
[1:05:54] Hallelujah. Barbary, what God has given
[1:05:56] to you, please don't take it granted.
[1:06:01] It's real. It's real. God can use any
[1:06:05] one of us. Hallelujah. Just trust in
[1:06:09] him. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Our
[1:06:13] God is good. Hallelujah. I don't know if
[1:06:17] I can finish the message that I'm about
[1:06:20] to bring. I don't know where I am now. I
[1:06:23] just speak what God has bring me here
[1:06:26] now. I just speaking. Hallelujah. Thank
[1:06:29] you. What God want to speak, I want to
[1:06:32] speak to you this morning. He want to
[1:06:34] speak to you as his children.
[1:06:36] Hallelujah. Whom we have ordained, oh
[1:06:39] God, before the foundation of this
[1:06:41] world, and is about to take you home
[1:06:44] with him. Hallelujah. So he's speaking
[1:06:47] to you as children, his his own
[1:06:51] children, not even the children, in the
[1:06:54] spiritual form, his wife. Hallelujah. as
[1:06:58] a church. Hallelujah. That's why you
[1:07:01] speak it this morning. If you open your
[1:07:04] heart and your mind, I believe God will
[1:07:07] give you something to go this morning.
[1:07:10] Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of God.
[1:07:14] Thank you,
[1:07:16] Jesus. At
[1:07:19] 3, this lady has a breast cancer. I was
[1:07:24] work.
[1:07:26] He came to my
[1:07:27] work with his
[1:07:29] mother for me to pray for them.
[1:07:34] Meanwhile, that that
[1:07:36] lady
[1:07:38] his her her husband father was sick one
[1:07:42] day and God told me to go down and pray
[1:07:47] for him. He was bleeding for the whole
[1:07:50] night. He couldn't stop. They were
[1:07:53] discussing who going to take him to the
[1:07:57] hospital and I went there. God told me
[1:08:00] from my shop and I went to their
[1:08:02] shop and I found out why God sent me
[1:08:05] there and I asked
[1:08:07] him why everything all
[1:08:11] right? And they said brother Gabriel
[1:08:14] knows about this here. They
[1:08:17] said he was bleeding all night when he
[1:08:21] go to washroom. He was peeling all
[1:08:24] blood. So I said if you want you don't
[1:08:27] want if you want can I pray for your
[1:08:29] father? He said yes. The man said yes. I
[1:08:32] lay my hand upon that
[1:08:34] man. And from that day he went to the
[1:08:37] washroom. There was no blood. He never
[1:08:39] go to the hospital. God healing him
[1:08:41] instantly.
[1:08:43] So this lady knows about God.
[1:08:47] Hallelujah. And when I I told him
[1:08:51] that he came back with his mother with
[1:08:54] her mother to my office at our
[1:08:57] shop. I have an oil and oil. I lay my
[1:09:01] hand upon them and I told them and I
[1:09:05] asked him I asked her about the
[1:09:07] cigarette. He said I stopped that that
[1:09:10] time when he told me I stopped the
[1:09:13] cigarette so he doesn't smoke more. So
[1:09:16] they went and just recently the doctor
[1:09:20] declared he's cancer
[1:09:22] free. You
[1:09:24] understand the
[1:09:26] gospel that we preach the same gospel
[1:09:31] that Paul preached. I'm just telling you
[1:09:35] Paul was in the
[1:09:37] prison. Paul was not all the time Paul
[1:09:40] stand in the pulpit preaching. He just
[1:09:43] take the all the some of the the the the
[1:09:47] Bible like Catius and all those fimon
[1:09:50] and everything he's in prison. He just
[1:09:53] wrote the service and give it to
[1:09:56] them. Every word that you speak there's
[1:09:59] a power behind that. Hallelujah. the God
[1:10:03] that we
[1:10:04] speak. Excuse
[1:10:13] me. I'm sorry. I can't help it. I just I
[1:10:18] just be of
[1:10:20] myself. The God that we preach is the
[1:10:24] same God that Paul
[1:10:25] preach. It's no different God.
[1:10:29] And our
[1:10:30] days,
[1:10:33] God, the Jews recognize they couldn't
[1:10:36] check. They So I'm I'm just going back
[1:10:38] and forth. The the
[1:10:41] Jews, they forget to look the prophecies
[1:10:44] in the
[1:10:46] Bible.
[1:10:47] So Paul couldn't get that. And when the
[1:10:51] Lord Jesus Christ met him, he took him
[1:10:54] from the that place and sent to the
[1:10:57] island and take all the worldly wisdom
[1:10:59] away from him. And Paul became a man of
[1:11:03] God and he started preaching the
[1:11:06] gospel. Okay. So when the Paul preach as
[1:11:09] I
[1:11:10] said while the God is moving he's
[1:11:14] adding faith. That's was Paul time. The
[1:11:18] next one virtue. Virtue is power. God is
[1:11:23] building his people.
[1:11:26] So the next one is
[1:11:29] knowledge, wisdom. The next one is
[1:11:32] temperance. You have you have to you
[1:11:35] have to have you don't have to have
[1:11:38] temper. Be patient with God. Be patient
[1:11:42] with people as God has patient with when
[1:11:44] we were. Don't don't get mad. Every
[1:11:48] little thing you get mad. You show
[1:11:49] yourself as a Christian. Hallelujah.
[1:11:52] Have patience with
[1:11:53] people. Patient and godliness Wesley and
[1:11:58] brother kindness. See God is building
[1:12:01] all this church. All this this is in
[1:12:04] you. God has placed everything that is
[1:12:08] there is in you
[1:12:10] cuz it's building. It's building. It's
[1:12:13] like when
[1:12:14] the when when the the orange
[1:12:18] tree you grow the orange tree it started
[1:12:22] coming the fruit start coming small and
[1:12:26] when you taking is sour sour sour sour
[1:12:30] sour sour you're going to reach a
[1:12:32] certain point oh it's sweet but it
[1:12:36] hasn't yet finished and then it getting
[1:12:39] sweeter and sweeter and sweeter so we
[1:12:42] are the sweetest
[1:12:45] part. That's why the gospel is so sweet.
[1:12:49] You cannot help it. Why sometime you
[1:12:52] just singing and some kind of happiness
[1:12:55] spring in your your heart and you start
[1:12:58] laughing. You don't know where you you
[1:13:01] don't know why you laughing but some joy
[1:13:05] comes in your soul that sometime you
[1:13:08] thinking about God. You think about
[1:13:10] something and you start getting sweeter
[1:13:12] and sweeter and sweeter and somebody Why
[1:13:14] are you
[1:13:15] laughing? I am happy. Why are you happy?
[1:13:20] God makes me happy. Amen. You cannot
[1:13:23] happy by any you know the worldly happy
[1:13:26] is just a just a list like you you
[1:13:29] there's no percentage to
[1:13:31] that. You understand? There's no
[1:13:33] percentage to God happiness the worldly
[1:13:36] happiness. Hallelujah.
[1:13:41] So you getting
[1:13:43] sher. So
[1:13:45] now they were what prophecy are we in?
[1:13:49] You see, let's read something here about
[1:13:53] what Paul
[1:13:55] was Paul messaging was prophetic message
[1:14:00] messages all kind of things
[1:14:03] inside he prophesy inside at the end
[1:14:07] what is going to be at the end can we
[1:14:10] can we read a little bit I'm going to
[1:14:12] read a little bit about about Paul uh
[1:14:14] thing for you
[1:14:17] this hallelujah
[1:14:19] Yeah.
[1:14:21] First
[1:14:29] Thessalonians that
[1:14:56] I'm sorry. I just I'm just confused
[1:14:59] here.
[1:15:14] First chapter
[1:15:23] 4 verse 13.
[1:15:27] But I will not have you to be ignorant,
[1:15:30] brethren, concerning them which are
[1:15:32] asleep, that you sorrow not, even the
[1:15:36] others which have no hope. He said you
[1:15:39] sorrow not. Okay? For if we believe that
[1:15:43] Jesus died on the and rose again, even
[1:15:46] so them also which sleep in Jesus will
[1:15:51] not bring him bring with him. For this
[1:15:54] we say unto you by the word of the Lord,
[1:15:58] that we which are alive and remain unto
[1:16:01] the coming of the Lord shall not
[1:16:04] prevent them which are asleep. For the
[1:16:08] Lord himself shall descend from heaven,
[1:16:11] with a shout, with a voice of ark angel,
[1:16:15] and with a trump of God, and the dead in
[1:16:19] Christ shall rise first.
[1:16:22] Then we who are alive and remain shall
[1:16:25] be changed and caught up together with
[1:16:28] them in the crowd and meet the Lord in
[1:16:30] the air and also
[1:16:32] shall shall we ever be with the Lord.
[1:16:37] Hallelujah. I say wherefore comfort one
[1:16:40] another with these
[1:16:42] words. That's a prophecy in our day that
[1:16:46] we are waiting. We are inside now.
[1:16:54] Hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:16:56] Jesus. Amen. Glory to
[1:16:59] God. I have I have a lot of scriptures
[1:17:02] to
[1:17:06] read. Thank you,
[1:17:08] Jesus. Now, we all
[1:17:13] know
[1:17:15] Gentiles, Gentiles. I'm going to read.
[1:17:18] Let me read Isaiah 49 for you to see
[1:17:20] something. Today we talk about
[1:17:25] it. Isaiah 49:6.
[1:17:31] And he said it is light thing that thou
[1:17:36] should be my servant to rise up the
[1:17:40] tribe of Judah and to the
[1:17:44] restore restore the perverst of Israel.
[1:17:48] I will also give thee a light to the
[1:17:52] Gentiles that thou might be my that I
[1:17:57] might be my salvation unto the end of
[1:17:59] the earth. As I said, we are the
[1:18:04] Gentiles.
[1:18:05] God is giving us salvation right
[1:18:10] now. The way same way that he
[1:18:13] call those the our brethren the
[1:18:16] Israelites the same way he's going to
[1:18:18] call
[1:18:19] us. So he has to give us the prophets to
[1:18:24] reveal the word of God to us.
[1:18:32] So he
[1:18:34] brought as we know our our our our
[1:18:39] prophet William Mariam Braham to the
[1:18:43] gentile to reveal the
[1:18:45] gentile
[1:18:47] bride at this time and we know he
[1:18:52] came and the whole world know
[1:18:59] him. But they couldn't take that word.
[1:19:02] Why they couldn't
[1:19:03] take? Because the same way they rejected
[1:19:07] the Lord Jesus Christ and Paul message
[1:19:10] over
[1:19:13] there. The Sanhedrin and the Pharisees,
[1:19:17] they work together. They were not
[1:19:20] looking for the the prophecies that was
[1:19:23] prophesying. So they couldn't see they
[1:19:25] miss
[1:19:26] it. The same
[1:19:28] way the churches you know these churches
[1:19:32] here when God take his bride and they
[1:19:35] left over they organize and form a
[1:19:39] church. Those are the leftovers. The
[1:19:41] bride that in that age they are not left
[1:19:44] over. They already gone. They already
[1:19:46] stuck in the magnet. So those who
[1:19:49] doesn't
[1:19:51] have those who doesn't have that spirit
[1:19:54] they left over and they know about you
[1:19:58] know in in Africa when we cut a snake we
[1:20:01] have a snake called p father when you
[1:20:03] cut the head you when you sleep you cut
[1:20:06] the head and wake up you going to
[1:20:08] jumping jumping jumping jumping jumping
[1:20:11] meanwhile the head is cut off no matter
[1:20:13] what you do you will die that's exactly
[1:20:16] that happened to the denomination
[1:20:19] So the power that left because they are
[1:20:22] God people and God is the spirit once
[1:20:25] you have the spirit in you you can do
[1:20:27] anything you understand. So but God in
[1:20:30] that ages God magnet all of them stop in
[1:20:34] the magnet. God is the magnet up there.
[1:20:37] So God is taking is moving. He's moving.
[1:20:40] He took them out already. So first dis
[1:20:43] dispensation second dispensation all of
[1:20:45] them is already taken up. So the
[1:20:48] leftover they form organized with and
[1:20:50] they use instead of them to use the
[1:20:53] power of God they use knowledge wisdom
[1:20:57] and
[1:20:57] education because that's what Satan is
[1:21:01] he beguile them with wisdom
[1:21:03] education instead of them to look
[1:21:06] through the prophecy that go that is is
[1:21:08] that prophecy that is taking us with God
[1:21:11] if you miss that prophecy you cannot
[1:21:15] see you understand because the Jew lose
[1:21:17] faith to look through the prophecy that
[1:21:20] Isaiah 9 says a child a a a son will be
[1:21:24] born but when the son was born they
[1:21:27] forget that prophecy that a son that son
[1:21:29] a son is a
[1:21:31] man they forget and they thinking he is
[1:21:35] one of them but he wasn't one of them he
[1:21:38] was god
[1:21:40] himself
[1:21:45] amen that is what is happening. So God
[1:21:50] is taking up that magnet. God is taking
[1:21:54] up his people through those o they all
[1:21:57] stuck inside there. So
[1:22:01] now a prophet
[1:22:04] came he introduced us to John John he
[1:22:09] introduced us to
[1:22:11] God that is Christ. You remember John
[1:22:15] the Baptist when John the Baptist came
[1:22:18] because Malaka 4:5 was a scripture that
[1:22:21] brother Abraham came to fulfill and uh
[1:22:24] and and then John the
[1:22:26] Baptist was the one who introduced the
[1:22:30] Lord Jesus Christ and when the John the
[1:22:32] Baptist introduced the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:35] he stepped
[1:22:36] outside and then the ministry of the
[1:22:39] Lord Jesus Christ went
[1:22:41] up. Okay. So right now is our
[1:22:46] day. Now Maka 4:5 has come. He has
[1:22:52] introduced us to the Lord Jesus
[1:22:55] Christ. That time we were
[1:23:00] bride. So
[1:23:02] when when we were bride and the Bible
[1:23:05] said the church is the
[1:23:09] wife. When a woman is not married, he's
[1:23:12] what? a bride, right?
[1:23:15] So, Brother Abraham came, he introduced
[1:23:19] the bride to the
[1:23:21] groom. So, Abraham said outside. So, the
[1:23:25] groom, what he has to do, he take the
[1:23:30] wife, he take the wife and put the
[1:23:33] arms on the and the and the shoulder
[1:23:36] like that and and and and they moving.
[1:23:40] Hallelujah. I remember when I married my
[1:23:43] wife, that's what I did.
[1:23:45] Hallelujah. Thank you. That time is
[1:23:49] between the groom and the wife. Yes.
[1:23:53] Some time ago, our former
[1:23:58] pastor,
[1:24:00] Pastor John Simon, he preached a message
[1:24:03] here. The whole world, they do not
[1:24:06] understand
[1:24:09] that internal church. age.
[1:24:12] If the bride have
[1:24:15] introduced to the groom, he is no more a
[1:24:19] bride. He's a wife.
[1:24:22] So when the wife go with the groom, what
[1:24:26] environment? Because the groom is the
[1:24:29] eternal. He's God himself. He is God is
[1:24:33] eternal. So the wife live with him with
[1:24:36] eternal. What environment are they
[1:24:38] living in? eternal age because there's
[1:24:42] no more age that they are going to
[1:24:44] because now it's
[1:24:45] finished. So they living eternal age
[1:24:49] right now where we are what we are
[1:24:52] living right now is eternal age. There
[1:24:56] is no a more age to come. The Leisian
[1:24:59] church age is gone. We are married to
[1:25:04] the uh uh what do you call eternal God.
[1:25:09] If you marry with eternal God, what
[1:25:12] environment are you living? And the wife
[1:25:16] and the groom are
[1:25:19] one. So if your h your husband is
[1:25:22] eternal, what are you right
[1:25:25] now? You are living in
[1:25:28] tenner eternal age. There's no more age
[1:25:32] because now all what we are waiting is
[1:25:36] the
[1:25:37] rapture.
[1:25:39] Hallelujah. We are living in the
[1:25:41] rapturing age. Let me tell
[1:25:44] you when the Lord Jesus Christ died on
[1:25:48] the cross and you went down the tomb
[1:25:51] over there and took the key from Satan
[1:25:54] and opened that door.
[1:25:57] He lose all the saint that were kept in
[1:26:01] those time. Even all the prophet and
[1:26:04] Abrahamic all of them were there. You
[1:26:06] lose all of them. They were c they were
[1:26:09] they were there
[1:26:12] because the life of Christ was not given
[1:26:15] yet. He is the one who come and open the
[1:26:17] gate and lose them. Hallelujah. What did
[1:26:21] he do when he lost when he lose them?
[1:26:24] The Bible says even some of them saw the
[1:26:28] saints walking on the street of
[1:26:30] Jerusalem. My brother and my sister,
[1:26:32] this is not a joke. This is real. That's
[1:26:36] why I say you have to rejoice that you
[1:26:38] are
[1:26:40] in. Hallelujah. Never mind you die
[1:26:43] today, you die tomorrow. You already
[1:26:45] stuck with the magnet. Hallelujah.
[1:26:48] Nothing can pull you down. Aren't you
[1:26:51] happy? Hallelujah. Rejoice.
[1:26:56] I'm sorry to screaming because it's it's
[1:26:58] so sweet, sweeter than honey.
[1:27:02] That's why why do you think some
[1:27:03] brothers and sisters when their wife
[1:27:07] some his wife cannot understand the the
[1:27:11] the husband cannot understand they try
[1:27:14] to give them but they cannot give that's
[1:27:18] why sometime you are hard you sometime
[1:27:21] when I witness to people I said if I can
[1:27:25] do
[1:27:26] surgery I can open and put inside there
[1:27:31] But I
[1:27:32] can. You understand? It's so
[1:27:35] real. If you see the reality and the
[1:27:39] power of God that you have, my brother
[1:27:42] and my sister, there is nothing can
[1:27:44] stand before
[1:27:45] you. All what you have to do, surrender
[1:27:49] your life to
[1:27:50] him. That's all what you have to do. God
[1:27:53] is not requiring nothing from you. Live
[1:27:56] the life.
[1:27:59] just normal life. You don't have to be
[1:28:02] anything. This when I went the sister I
[1:28:05] said if you don't stop smoking you will
[1:28:08] never leave to see your children that
[1:28:09] you
[1:28:10] love. You think it's easy to go tell
[1:28:13] somebody like
[1:28:15] that. It takes God. It takes your belief
[1:28:20] whom you believe and who you worship to
[1:28:24] do that because you know what you said
[1:28:26] is that said the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:28:30] Because your mouth is God is going to
[1:28:32] use to speak to somebody. Amen. If you
[1:28:35] take action, ashen will bring ashen.
[1:28:39] Hallelujah. Exercise the gift that God
[1:28:42] has given to you. You have some gift
[1:28:45] that nobody has it. Release it. That's
[1:28:49] the perfume of Christianity. Hallelujah.
[1:28:53] If the flower didn't give perfume or you
[1:28:55] didn't shake the flower, how you going
[1:28:57] to smell the the
[1:28:59] perfume, lily flour.
[1:29:04] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Sometime
[1:29:07] our own children, we think we can give
[1:29:09] it to them, but we can. It's God. Just
[1:29:12] leave the life. Let them see even they
[1:29:15] will rebel against you in the house.
[1:29:18] Deep in their mind they go outside say
[1:29:21] my father and my mother who the best
[1:29:25] Christians they they they know the world
[1:29:31] know that what we have is the best but
[1:29:36] they cannot get. Why do you think they
[1:29:38] jealous of you and they harm you? They
[1:29:39] don't because they cannot get what you
[1:29:41] have.
[1:29:43] You have to have that kind of steel
[1:29:45] talk. Steel to get to attract you that
[1:29:48] magnet. The Holy Ghost is your ste the
[1:29:52] steel magnet that you attract. You don't
[1:29:55] attract to the pastor that is standing
[1:29:57] here. The word that is bringing forth.
[1:30:00] Hallelujah. That you are attracted to.
[1:30:03] Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:30:08] So live godly life and
[1:30:13] enjoy enjoy your salvation. Don't let
[1:30:17] the devil put you down. Don't let no man
[1:30:20] put you down. God is real. I know how
[1:30:25] people go through the stuff that people
[1:30:27] go. It's not easy. It's not easy when
[1:30:30] you going through some
[1:30:32] pain. Only you feel the pain. It's a a
[1:30:36] woman having a a child. Your husband
[1:30:38] standing, oh honey, we rubbing the honey
[1:30:41] poo. They say poo poo poo. You know how
[1:30:44] he's going through. Only him know. Only
[1:30:47] her know the pain that he's going
[1:30:49] through. You don't feel it.
[1:30:53] You understand? But the power of God
[1:30:55] give them strength to bring that baby
[1:30:57] out. If themsel alone, they cannot do
[1:31:00] it. But the power that's within them,
[1:31:03] the promise of God that's within them
[1:31:05] that give them extra power through the
[1:31:09] pain to bring forth the child. So if
[1:31:12] you're a Christian, when you go through
[1:31:15] something, you don't don't think about
[1:31:17] pain, pain, and agony and sad. And
[1:31:20] there's no sadness in
[1:31:22] Christianity. Christianity is joy. You
[1:31:25] know, Paul, he went through affliction.
[1:31:28] They tried to cut his throat. They try
[1:31:30] to do all kind of things. God raised
[1:31:32] Paul for me and
[1:31:34] you. And that's why you you read that
[1:31:36] scripture. He was telling the affliction
[1:31:38] that he went through through the
[1:31:40] prophecies that was in the word the word
[1:31:42] of God. He has to fulfill the promises
[1:31:45] about the Gentiles as we
[1:31:48] read. The Gentiles has to receive
[1:31:51] salvation. Who is going to pass through
[1:31:52] to receive the salvation? God passed
[1:31:54] through Paul to bring salvation to the
[1:31:57] Gentiles.
[1:31:59] So Paul Paul message was not an easy
[1:32:01] thing but he went through and he passed
[1:32:05] through. Nobody couldn't take him. They
[1:32:07] cut his head off but the message is
[1:32:09] still
[1:32:10] here. Paul words is still here. Let me
[1:32:13] tell you brother Abraham word that he
[1:32:15] brought every word that brother Brown
[1:32:18] brought is inspired.
[1:32:21] Every book everything message is
[1:32:24] inspired.
[1:32:27] This man was true prophet.
[1:32:33] The only person that would deny the bra
[1:32:37] message and say something about is the
[1:32:41] devil. Anoint
[1:32:44] people. You understand? This man sat
[1:32:47] down and somebody is talking about him
[1:32:51] at the house and God talked to him. They
[1:32:54] saying this and this and that and that.
[1:32:56] Wasn't the same thing when Miriam was
[1:32:58] talking about Moses and God called Moses
[1:33:01] and said they say they say they say
[1:33:02] this. Is it not the
[1:33:05] same? Because they don't see the
[1:33:08] prophecies in the
[1:33:10] Bible. God promises
[1:33:13] promises. Revelation
[1:33:15] 10:7 Malachi 4:5. Now our scripture is
[1:33:19] where where we are
[1:33:22] now? Revelation
[1:33:26] 19.
[1:33:28] Okay. Our scripture Revelation 19. Let
[1:33:33] me read for
[1:33:38] you. You are no more bright. Hallelujah.
[1:34:00] Revolution.
[1:34:13] Yeah. He said, "Let us be glad and
[1:34:17] rejoice." Revelation 19:7, "Let us be
[1:34:20] glad and rejoice and give honor to him,
[1:34:24] for the marriage of the Lamb is come."
[1:34:27] and his wife had made herself ready.
[1:34:33] Are we ready?
[1:34:35] Yes. Because we have been
[1:34:37] introduced by the prophet.
[1:34:42] Hallelujah. Do you
[1:34:45] understand? We have been
[1:34:48] introduced already.
[1:34:51] Let's let's read a a a little message
[1:34:54] here
[1:34:55] about brother
[1:35:01] Abraham. This is
[1:35:07] a recognize your day and it message.
[1:35:13] Recognizing your day and its message by
[1:35:17] William
[1:35:18] Manraham
[1:35:22] 1964. Just the similar as the Jews that
[1:35:26] they were in as the Gentiles with theirs
[1:35:31] as Gentiles with
[1:35:33] theirs because it is prophesied the same
[1:35:37] thing. same thing claiming they were
[1:35:40] looking for him. But the denominations
[1:35:43] now in the gentile lician age is just as
[1:35:47] blind as they were because why? It is
[1:35:51] prophesied they would be. It must come
[1:35:54] to
[1:35:56] pass. If Israel only could have
[1:35:59] recognized their
[1:36:01] sign, they would have known the time of
[1:36:04] the Messiah's appearing.
[1:36:08] better appearing was at hand if they had
[1:36:13] recognized. You know the the disciples
[1:36:16] said that to Jesus. Why does the scribe
[1:36:20] say that Elas might first come and Jesus
[1:36:24] said Elas has come has already come and
[1:36:29] they didn't know him. He's already been
[1:36:32] here and they have already killed him.
[1:36:35] They done just
[1:36:37] exactly what the
[1:36:40] scripture they done. They done just
[1:36:45] exactly what the scripture has the
[1:36:48] scripture said they will
[1:36:51] do. If they would have only recognized
[1:36:55] that that the fant fan fanatic that
[1:36:59] condemn every double
[1:37:04] things that they
[1:37:07] done that condemn every that condemned
[1:37:12] everything that they were doing. He
[1:37:14] said, "You hypocrites, don't begin
[1:37:18] to snakes, snakes and the glass. Snakes
[1:37:22] in the glass. You generation of vipers
[1:37:25] who has warned you to flee from the
[1:37:27] wrath that's to come." Don't begin to
[1:37:30] think within yourself, we have Abraham
[1:37:34] to our father. We have this that or
[1:37:37] other. For I tell you, God is able to
[1:37:41] God is able of the to God is able of
[1:37:44] these stones to be re
[1:37:47] rising children to
[1:37:50] Abraham. Don't begin to think that you
[1:37:53] have got the word council of at hand.
[1:37:57] You got the best dressed members of of
[1:38:01] that. God is able of ar rats out here to
[1:38:06] raise our children to fulfill his
[1:38:14] word. Prostitute, street workers,
[1:38:17] drunkards, gamblers is able to do it. He
[1:38:21] is still God.
[1:38:24] blinded denominations like blinded
[1:38:26] Israel both prophesied prophesy to be
[1:38:30] that way. I am showing you
[1:38:33] paras till you till I get this spot that
[1:38:38] I wanted to I wanted to now blinded as
[1:38:43] the the denomination of the gentiles of
[1:38:46] the Lucian
[1:38:49] age are blinded today like they were
[1:38:52] then. The Lisa age is supposed to
[1:38:55] receive me
[1:38:57] message 4 said they would back. What are
[1:39:02] they looking for? Our denomination will
[1:39:05] produce it. If it doesn't come through
[1:39:07] us, the Baptist, the Presbyterian, and
[1:39:11] the assembles, the awareness,
[1:39:15] there's if we don't produce it, it isn't
[1:39:19] true. Same thing. They did in that day
[1:39:23] and it came and went and they didn't
[1:39:27] know it. They didn't recognize it.
[1:39:31] Though it fulfilled every word Jesus
[1:39:34] said they have they they have did as it
[1:39:38] was listed that they would do. So will
[1:39:42] they do the son of man he would be
[1:39:46] rejected. No. Now notice same now in the
[1:39:51] gentile gentile days according to the
[1:39:54] promised scripture of Maka 4 which Jesus
[1:39:57] said all scriptures is
[1:40:00] inspired all scriptures is inspired and
[1:40:04] not one bit of it can keep from being
[1:40:08] fulfilled. There's no way to keep the
[1:40:10] scripture from being fulfilled. All must
[1:40:13] be
[1:40:14] fulfilled. When Jesus said it would
[1:40:17] happen and there we see it happen. We
[1:40:20] see it. Restore that it is the last
[1:40:23] days. You you denominational
[1:40:26] brethren listen. Restore the Pentecost.
[1:40:31] Listen. Restore the Pentecostal original
[1:40:33] feast like it was at the beginning. So
[1:40:36] will it be restored before Israel.
[1:40:39] Trumpet fish shall sound. Has to be
[1:40:42] restored. There has to be something to
[1:40:46] do it. Mara 4 said it will restore back
[1:40:50] the faith of the fathers and the
[1:40:52] children. What would what would take
[1:40:57] place?
[1:40:59] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:41:04] So as Abraham said, the same thing that
[1:41:08] the Jewish did, they forget the
[1:41:11] scripture that they were supposed to
[1:41:13] know. But right now, the
[1:41:16] denomination when we talk about
[1:41:18] theation, we are not talking about the
[1:41:21] people. You're talking about the system
[1:41:23] that they think, as I said, if you chop
[1:41:26] the head of snake, you're going to jump
[1:41:29] jump thinking there's power. But there's
[1:41:32] no more power. The power is within the
[1:41:36] bride. The power, God power is within
[1:41:39] the
[1:41:40] bride. They cannot challenge
[1:41:43] you. They can do all what they
[1:41:46] want. They can heal the sick. They can
[1:41:48] do everything. But already the magnet
[1:41:52] has taken what God what God need out
[1:41:56] already.
[1:41:58] Hallelujah. They have no power. The
[1:42:01] power is
[1:42:02] within. You see when you when the group
[1:42:06] is going
[1:42:07] somewhere and all together and if you
[1:42:11] pass through here they will not wait for
[1:42:14] you. We are going to Hamilton we start
[1:42:17] from here. Oh say no I'm going
[1:42:21] to
[1:42:24] haga and pick up something. By the time
[1:42:26] you come you already gone. Nobody wait
[1:42:29] for you because it's set up. You cannot
[1:42:32] change. God set up is already set
[1:42:36] up. He already
[1:42:38] called what he need from the time of
[1:42:42] Paul up to our age. Right now is no more
[1:42:46] the church. Right now is the wife. Amen.
[1:42:50] The wife has made herself ready.
[1:42:56] You'll be
[1:42:57] introduced to the groom. When you
[1:43:01] introduce to the groom and they said,
[1:43:03] "We going to the the the the the supper.
[1:43:08] We going to the the the the party. We
[1:43:11] going to the party. We will all come
[1:43:13] back
[1:43:14] again. We all set up going to the party.
[1:43:18] The groom has already took his wife and
[1:43:22] his arm, honey."
[1:43:24] So now God you you are working with God
[1:43:27] like this.
[1:43:30] Hallelujah. God arm is like
[1:43:33] this. And the church, the bride, the
[1:43:36] wife, no more bride, but now the
[1:43:40] wife, the garment is walking and the
[1:43:44] groom shining light and the sh that
[1:43:48] light
[1:43:49] through
[1:43:52] around the
[1:43:54] wife. So that power that God has is
[1:43:58] right shining on you. Who can be against
[1:44:01] you?
[1:44:03] Hallelujah. That's the greatest the
[1:44:07] greatest. It's not a story. It's
[1:44:11] reality. God arms is like this. And your
[1:44:15] arm, your
[1:44:16] arms, you know the ladies, you know the
[1:44:19] ladies, how you put your arm here. I
[1:44:20] don't know cuz I haven't be a lady
[1:44:22] before cuz you know how you put your
[1:44:25] arms around your husband, right,
[1:44:27] honey?
[1:44:29] Hallelujah. You understand? So now God
[1:44:32] is working like this and you are is
[1:44:35] working with you. Hallelujah.
[1:44:38] Anybody that does does anything to you,
[1:44:42] God doesn't have to speak. He just go
[1:44:43] like
[1:44:45] this. He just have a product because
[1:44:48] it's the power. He has all the power.
[1:44:51] God can look at you and you met you will
[1:44:54] not exist because he created you. He can
[1:44:58] make you b the same way that you were
[1:45:01] like he did he did to Satan. Satan was a
[1:45:04] bluff and he said today I'm going to
[1:45:05] tell you to be a snake and rather he
[1:45:07] tell him to be a snake. That's not
[1:45:09] that's not a lie. That's
[1:45:12] real. So when God said I hate you, he
[1:45:15] hate you. He doesn't he just because
[1:45:17] when God
[1:45:20] speak so he just look he don't bother
[1:45:25] God to speak. He just look and that's
[1:45:28] why Satan scared of you. The only way
[1:45:31] Satan can bomb you unless you give your
[1:45:35] power to
[1:45:37] him. If you give your power to Satan,
[1:45:40] then is your own self. But if you
[1:45:44] maintain what God has given to you, you
[1:45:47] are invisible.
[1:45:49] Invisible wife. Aren't you happy to be a
[1:45:53] wife of God?
[1:45:54] Every lady want to have a powerful mind
[1:45:57] to get married so that he can protect
[1:45:59] him. He can protect her. Right? You
[1:46:02] ladies, am I right or not? Every lady
[1:46:05] want
[1:46:06] protection. Hallelujah. So if he marry a
[1:46:10] lady don't want a a a a husband that
[1:46:14] somebody's coming to ber and and he just
[1:46:17] look he want the lady defend the man
[1:46:20] too. It doesn't work.
[1:46:23] Every lady want a man who can get down
[1:46:26] from my wife. What do you want? You want
[1:46:28] to face face me and he will stand beside
[1:46:31] you. Then after you finish Kofi, you did
[1:46:34] a great job.
[1:46:37] Hallelujah. I thought you scared
[1:46:39] too. Hallelujah. I am a
[1:46:44] man. A man. God is man. God created man
[1:46:51] and man to take care for the wife. So
[1:46:54] God knew that he going to take care for
[1:46:58] his wife. So God is taking care for you
[1:47:00] right now. Not tomorrow. Right now he's
[1:47:04] taking care of you. Okay? So be patient
[1:47:08] with God. He hasn't finished with you
[1:47:10] yet. God bless you. I'm sorry with this
[1:47:12] mambbo words. I'm sorry for my ashing
[1:47:15] from the beginning. Uh, I know I'm not a
[1:47:19] a good preacher, but I did what God
[1:47:23] placed in my heart for you.
[1:47:26] [Applause]
[1:47:28] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:47:34] I know the
[1:47:36] Lord will make a
[1:47:39] way for me.
[1:47:44] I know the
[1:47:46] Lord will make a
[1:47:49] way for
[1:47:55] [Music]
[1:47:57] me a holy
[1:48:00] light. Shine
[1:48:02] around and do the right. I know the
[1:48:08] Lord will make a
[1:48:11] way for me. Let's sing one more time.
[1:48:18] I know the
[1:48:19] Lord will make a
[1:48:23] way for me.
[1:48:29] I know that the
[1:48:31] Lord will make a
[1:48:34] way for
[1:48:39] me. Yeah.
[1:48:41] I the only
[1:48:44] light shine
[1:48:47] around and do
[1:48:49] that. I know the
[1:48:52] Lord will make your
[1:48:55] way for me.
[1:49:00] Hallelujah. You hear the word of God.
[1:49:02] This mumble words. It's a broken words.
