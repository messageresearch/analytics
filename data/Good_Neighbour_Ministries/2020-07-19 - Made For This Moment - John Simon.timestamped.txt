[4:19] ready to be revealed in
[4:23] the last time thanks be the god friends
[4:27] we live in tremendous and momentous
[4:31] times as we will all be conscious of
[4:35] that
[4:36] great earth-shaking events
[4:39] are unfolding even as we speak
[4:45] great uh cataclysmic
[4:49] events are now in progress
[4:53] events with prophetic
[4:57] outlook on out are now
[5:00] in progress the very earth
[5:04] and all the world systems
[5:08] and all the nations are experiencing
[5:13] the the burp pains of a
[5:16] new a brand new millennium
[5:20] is just about to dawn
[5:24] as one ends another one
[5:28] is about to be born now these tumultuous
[5:31] times in which we live are significant
[5:35] as coming events are casting their
[5:38] shadows
[5:39] upon the curtains of time
[5:42] these events
[5:45] these supernatural signs
[5:49] that are upon the earth lights
[5:53] mysterious lights appearing
[5:56] mysterious happenings upon the face of
[5:58] the earth
[6:00] earthquakes tidal waves typhoons
[6:04] hurricanes pestilences
[6:08] uh all manner of strange events
[6:13] in nature earth and sky
[6:17] are taking place
[6:20] and so friends these things
[6:24] are here and these
[6:27] are all emerging changes
[6:31] in the flow of human history
[6:35] now we know we are living in the
[6:38] sixth millennium
[6:42] i believe of course that our lord jesus
[6:44] christ
[6:45] returns towards the ending towards the
[6:49] ending
[6:50] of the sixth millennium which we are in
[6:54] at this time now
[6:57] we realize that the that that the word
[7:00] six
[7:01] the the word the number six
[7:04] is the number of men
[7:07] so we know we're living in man's day
[7:09] this is
[7:10] not the lord's day as yet but it's man's
[7:14] day
[7:14] where it's man's ideas man's inventions
[7:18] man's science man's wisdom
[7:21] even man's uh church that he has shaped
[7:25] through the figment of his imagination
[7:28] and his interpretation
[7:30] from the word of god into a system of
[7:33] what
[7:34] he think god
[7:37] loves or god will want just like cain
[7:40] making an altar a beautiful and
[7:44] a beautiful system but he thinks that
[7:46] because of the beauty of it
[7:48] that's what will make god love it but
[7:51] here was abel with a raw rugged
[7:55] uh significant gospel
[7:58] the slaying of a lamb the blood spraying
[8:02] everywhere
[8:03] oh my god how could that be a sign
[8:07] of the messiah to come but it was a
[8:10] prophetic
[8:12] symbol and sign of the coming lamb of
[8:15] god
[8:16] that will be taking away the sins of the
[8:19] world
[8:20] and god abel god made
[8:24] about by revelation to
[8:27] recognize what the plan of god
[8:31] was that since by sin
[8:34] came man it had to be god coming in the
[8:38] form of a man
[8:40] to deliver the entire human race
[8:43] and so we come back to the fact that
[8:46] this number 6
[8:48] and 666 everyone knows that
[8:52] and the number six relates to man
[8:56] for it is the number of men and we live
[9:00] in the man's day and man's
[9:04] time now we realize friends
[9:07] that uh millennium when we use the word
[9:10] millennium
[9:11] comes from the latin word mille which
[9:14] means one
[9:15] thousand one thousand so we set the
[9:18] sixth millennium
[9:20] six thousand years as far as we know
[9:23] of the world the earth's existence
[9:27] is what we're talking about that we are
[9:29] living in that
[9:30] sixth millennium praise god hallelujah
[9:34] and so the fifth millennium has passed
[9:38] already
[9:39] and we are now in the sixth one
[9:43] every two thousand years a classmate
[9:46] event takes place something terrible
[9:51] happens and now living in the
[9:54] sixth millennium
[9:58] two two thousand year periods have
[10:01] already passed
[10:03] millennium fourth millennium now we're
[10:05] in the sixth millennium
[10:07] at the end of each something tremendous
[10:10] happened
[10:11] now we're almost to the ending
[10:14] of the sixth millennium something
[10:17] is fixing to take place
[10:20] my friends with this awareness as human
[10:24] beings
[10:24] have we lost any sense
[10:27] of god have we lost the sense
[10:31] of the supernatural have we any
[10:34] spiritual intelligence to recognize
[10:38] that there is something eventful
[10:42] fixing to their place even when there is
[10:45] an earthquake
[10:46] or some terrible a storm coming
[10:50] the animals the nature knows it
[10:54] long before human beings are even
[10:57] aware of it as god said the stark knows
[11:01] the time of my coming the swallow knows
[11:03] the time of my coming
[11:04] but my people knows not the judgments
[11:08] of the lord may god help us to regain
[11:12] the supernatural intelligence
[11:14] that we lost from the garden of eden
[11:17] when
[11:18] man sinned against god and
[11:21] fell into this state of ruin
[11:25] and in despair so here we are
[11:29] in the sixth millennium
[11:32] and the signs on the earth are pointing
[11:37] to it at this particular time
[11:40] in the first millennium the first
[11:42] thousand years
[11:44] it was a time of change when a
[11:46] millennium
[11:47] comes to its end a time of tremendous
[11:50] change and we understand at that time
[11:54] the world was flooded out
[11:57] the world was flooded out oh my
[12:01] and there was we're noah
[12:04] which jesus said that time of noah
[12:08] will repeat again back there
[12:11] they were trying to build a a castle
[12:14] a building that will go right up into
[12:17] the heavens
[12:18] uh and they uh it was really a form of
[12:22] rebellion of satan
[12:23] that he is going to find a way even
[12:25] though he was
[12:26] cast out he will now find an artificial
[12:30] way
[12:30] to climb up back into the presence
[12:34] of almighty god but it was not possible
[12:38] for god broke the entire thing down
[12:41] and later as we know there was great
[12:44] a flooding that took place upon we
[12:48] understand
[12:48] flooding that took place upon the face
[12:51] of the earth
[12:52] now recognize men there actually trying
[12:54] to do the same things
[12:56] doing it by rocket ships doing it by
[12:58] satellites
[12:59] but god already spoke in the book of
[13:02] isaiah
[13:02] though you go up and try to make your
[13:05] nest
[13:06] your home among the stars lo
[13:09] i shall bring thee down oh may god have
[13:13] mercy upon us
[13:14] to recognize now speaking on this first
[13:17] uh millennium the world was flooded
[13:21] and no was the man that was
[13:24] used for that moment
[13:28] now my emphasis today is to let you
[13:31] know whoever you are brother sister no
[13:34] matter how
[13:36] insignificant you think you are
[13:39] god has you here on time
[13:42] in this age on the earth in this place
[13:45] and position
[13:46] for his divine purpose to fulfill
[13:50] the manifestation of his word
[13:53] and so you and i we together
[13:57] are the people for this moment
[14:00] you are the person that god has placed
[14:03] here
[14:04] for this moment along with your other
[14:07] brothers and sisters we were
[14:10] predestinated by the hand of god
[14:12] to be here upon the earth for this hour
[14:16] and to meet every challenge of the enemy
[14:18] every doubt every fear
[14:20] and to overcome them by the
[14:23] manifestation
[14:24] of the word of god through our lives
[14:27] thank
[14:28] god for noah who was a
[14:31] ignore of the word he was
[14:34] open to the revelation of the holy
[14:38] spirit of the living god at that time
[14:42] as in our time the imagination of men's
[14:46] hearts were evil
[14:50] man's heart the bible says were evil
[14:53] continually figuring out
[14:56] all vain imaginations of schemes and
[14:59] tricks
[15:00] whatever it was the bible said violence
[15:04] covered the land
[15:06] what uh what a culture we are living in
[15:08] now
[15:09] guns murder mass murder
[15:12] death on every hand bloodshed
[15:17] blood flowing in our streets death and
[15:20] violence everywhere all the works
[15:24] of man's hand yes sir
[15:27] and then noah
[15:30] being on the scene he had a destiny
[15:35] and being armed with the revealed word
[15:38] of god for his day
[15:40] he withstood all the armies of
[15:43] satan and stood unashamed as
[15:46] one man in the door of that ark
[15:50] and before he even built the ark he
[15:53] announced god told him to build an
[15:55] ark he was made a mocking stock a
[15:58] laughingstock
[15:59] how are you going to escape how are you
[16:01] going to get out of here
[16:02] and more than that noah are you building
[16:06] an ark on top of a mountain
[16:08] you you would want to build it in the
[16:09] valley but no
[16:11] he knew what god had said
[16:14] and god's thoughts are far above our
[16:17] thoughts
[16:18] so he was obeying the word of the living
[16:20] god
[16:21] so noah preached the gospel for 120
[16:25] years
[16:26] noah built the ark as a way of escape
[16:30] and we are here today as the persons of
[16:33] this moment
[16:34] to declare the word of the lord a way of
[16:38] escape for you
[16:39] a way of escape for anyone and there
[16:43] is still room at the cross for you
[16:46] if you come to him now and find your
[16:49] place
[16:50] and position in the kingdom of god
[16:53] if you are already a believer ask
[16:56] god to reveal to you his prime purpose
[17:00] for your
[17:00] life your activity that you may with
[17:04] certainty go about the purposes of god
[17:08] and then god will bless you and anoint
[17:11] you
[17:11] to perform his divine will
[17:15] the second millennial came it was also a
[17:18] time of change
[17:20] the world was lost in darkness
[17:24] it was lost in the blindness of idolatry
[17:29] but there only on the plains of shinar
[17:34] their god ordained predestinated chose
[17:40] one man through which he could reflect
[17:43] himself
[17:44] and declare his divine word
[17:48] and that man of course was
[17:51] abraham for the world
[17:54] had drifted from the original
[17:58] knowledge of god that god
[18:01] was one god and had drifted
[18:04] into the paganism
[18:08] of idolatry carvings of stone
[18:12] bowing down to them and worshipping them
[18:16] which later in exodus god was to
[18:19] give us the commandments saying that
[18:22] anything carved by man any
[18:25] idols of wood stone or brass thou
[18:28] shall not bow down to
[18:32] them nor serve them declare who
[18:35] regardless who tells you it's okay for
[18:38] i the lord thy god is a jealous
[18:42] god and god will not stand for it
[18:45] it is paganism it is absolutely
[18:49] paganism under the disguise of
[18:52] christianity but at that time darkness
[18:56] covered the land idolatry was
[18:59] everywhere and abraham was no different
[19:02] than anybody else his father
[19:04] will no doubt was an idol maker
[19:07] sculptor carver and now that he was
[19:10] working along with his father
[19:14] but god had put him on the earth for a
[19:17] purpose
[19:18] and in the fullness of god's time
[19:21] when god was ready to use him or to
[19:25] awaken
[19:26] the seeds of life the potentials
[19:29] that were hidden in him that he knew
[19:31] nothing about
[19:33] god was ready to reveal that to him
[19:36] then the holy spirit god visited him
[19:40] amen visited him because he was
[19:45] predestinated
[19:46] to hear the voice of god the word the
[19:50] revealed word of god
[19:51] for his day for his time and for his
[19:54] hour
[19:55] god woken up by his voice
[19:59] and here it was god placed in his heart
[20:04] to restore back to the world at that
[20:07] time
[20:08] the revelation of one god
[20:12] amen and father abraham
[20:15] as we know founded the great
[20:18] nation of israel
[20:22] based on that revelation
[20:25] of one god to whom his descendants to
[20:28] this day
[20:29] believe in only one god the great
[20:33] jehovah
[20:34] elohim the one only and true god
[20:38] as christians what has been revealed to
[20:42] us from the word
[20:44] is that jehovah elohim in order to
[20:48] save mankind created a
[20:51] body for himself to indwell
[20:55] came down and dwelt in that body
[20:58] in the form of the man christ jesus
[21:03] having a body so the body could die on
[21:06] the cross
[21:07] to pay the redemptive purchase
[21:10] price of redemption for his sons and
[21:13] daughters
[21:14] but then though he gives up the ghost
[21:18] and the god the spirit of god can go
[21:21] back
[21:21] into glory where it was in the first
[21:24] place
[21:25] now recognize that god used abraham
[21:30] abraham was an idolater like everyone
[21:34] else abraham was not better
[21:37] than anybody else but through the grace
[21:41] of god
[21:42] he was chosen by god oh we are not
[21:45] abraham
[21:47] but we are of the faith seed of abraham
[21:52] we are abraham's fake children
[21:55] because remember god gave abraham
[21:58] promises and one of the promises
[22:01] he says abraham look up to the stars
[22:05] for even more than these stars or even
[22:08] if you could count the
[22:09] dust of the earth oh my your
[22:12] descendants are going to be number less
[22:15] than the signs of the seashore
[22:17] number less than the stars within the
[22:20] heavens
[22:21] of course we realize that that
[22:24] did not speak only of israel
[22:27] for the nation of israel is actually
[22:30] a very small nation
[22:34] but in that compound statement
[22:37] god had included abraham's
[22:42] seed faith abraham's children of faith
[22:46] amen abraham's faith seed so we are
[22:50] happy to be
[22:51] also children of abraham
[22:54] not by flesh but by faith
[22:57] but by revelation having the same
[23:00] attitude to god and the very approach to
[23:04] god
[23:05] that he had god has chosen
[23:08] us in this millennium in this
[23:12] generation to be the man
[23:15] and women for the moment that he could
[23:18] use for his glory in the midst of
[23:21] idolatry
[23:22] in the midst of darkness in the midst of
[23:25] drifting away
[23:26] from the things of god that we can stand
[23:30] up on his word
[23:31] and receive his blessing which he also
[23:34] promised
[23:35] abraham in yours in thy seed
[23:38] shall all the nations of the earth
[23:41] be blessed not only in the nation of
[23:44] israel
[23:45] certainly but also abraham's children
[23:49] true
[23:50] faith through them the gospel
[23:53] will enrich the entire world
[23:56] for this message this gospel shall be
[24:00] preached into
[24:01] all the world and then shall the end
[24:04] come oh thanks be to god for his
[24:07] blessing
[24:08] upon us in these last days i'm speaking
[24:11] about
[24:13] men for the moment
[24:16] men and women people chosen by god
[24:20] for this day this time this moment
[24:24] god has raised us up for his glory
[24:27] and for his honor now the third
[24:30] uh millennium came along
[24:34] the nation of israel was again found in
[24:37] confusion
[24:39] under constant attack by her enemies
[24:44] oh my think about it and just about that
[24:48] time
[24:49] after saul had disobeyed god
[24:53] disobeyed the word of the prophet samuel
[24:57] god anointed david
[25:01] and raised him up and placed him
[25:06] upon the throne thank god god sets up
[25:09] kings and he takes down kings
[25:12] oh praise god when saul was taken down
[25:16] then a david came upon the throne
[25:20] at that time and god used him
[25:24] oh to defeat all of
[25:27] israel's enemies so that they could have
[25:31] peace they could have security they
[25:34] could have
[25:35] hope in this present world
[25:38] and praise god from david's lineage
[25:42] the promise was given that the messiah
[25:46] will come from the loins or the lineage
[25:50] of david that he would be a son
[25:53] or of the lineage of david
[25:57] praise god a savior of all
[26:00] mankind thank god for that third
[26:03] millennium oh praise god then
[26:07] comes the fourth millennium once again
[26:11] the world was lost in sin hopelessness
[26:15] injustice under invasion
[26:20] and under the thraldom of
[26:23] roman tradition roman
[26:26] idolatry paganism
[26:30] at that time spiritual
[26:33] darkness covered the land and evil
[26:37] reign everywhere just about that time
[26:42] the millennium chains was fixing to
[26:45] change
[26:46] from the third to the fourth amen
[26:51] and there came one born on the scene
[26:54] whose the angel said to his mother mary
[26:58] thou shalt call his name jesus
[27:01] for he shall save his people from
[27:05] their sins and the world
[27:08] changed the darkness fled away
[27:11] for the son the s-u-n the s-o-n
[27:16] of god shined upon the scene
[27:19] and the people that sat in darkness saw
[27:22] a great
[27:23] light in the person and life of jesus
[27:26] christ
[27:26] the word of god made flesh
[27:29] and so the sunrise of hope dull dawned
[27:33] upon the hearts
[27:34] of the people supernatural lights were
[27:38] turned
[27:38] on in the world and the darkness
[27:41] fled away for he was the true light
[27:45] that shines shining into the heart of
[27:48] men
[27:48] he was my friends the the
[27:52] center of all history which you know
[27:55] to this day is divided between
[28:00] before christ bc
[28:03] and an autonomy after christ
[28:07] here we are praise god but his life
[28:12] came in the very center of history
[28:16] well did ezekiel say he is the wheel in
[28:19] the middle of the wheel
[28:21] she is the center of our attention
[28:24] and the center of everything oh praise
[28:28] god
[28:29] aren't you happy for the lord jesus
[28:31] christ amen
[28:32] then came the fifth
[28:35] millennium another change
[28:38] came in the world and again
[28:42] the world lay in satan's
[28:45] grip of error corruption
[28:49] ignorance spiritual bondage
[28:52] and at that time the bible was a closed
[28:56] book it was a mysterious book
[29:00] and it was used by certain
[29:03] religious authorities to engender
[29:07] fear and superstition in the hearts
[29:11] and in the minds of men for the bible
[29:14] remained the closed book and was closely
[29:17] guarded by the so-called
[29:21] church that claimed that it was the
[29:24] defender
[29:25] of the faith as if god needs someone to
[29:27] defend
[29:28] his faith now here it is friends we
[29:31] understand that that was used
[29:35] by the roman pagans at that time
[29:38] the skies under the robes and guys
[29:42] of christianity and guarding
[29:46] my friends the bible unlocking up the
[29:50] bible and imprisoning the very
[29:53] word of god and ruling on the religious
[29:56] fear superstition and thy force at
[29:59] paganism
[30:01] and idolatry
[30:05] brought from from pagan rome
[30:08] invading into christianity
[30:12] changing from a military power into a
[30:16] religious power upon the face
[30:19] of the very earth here we find my
[30:22] friends
[30:24] the light trying to shine within a
[30:27] so-called
[30:28] church saturated
[30:32] and steeped in religious tradition
[30:36] dogmas false doctrine
[30:40] all of this i repeat under
[30:44] the disguise and under the sheepskins
[30:49] christianity the word of god was chained
[30:53] to the
[30:54] rostrums the pulpits
[30:58] the walls of these cathedrals
[31:03] magnificent cathedrals
[31:06] in whose shadows lay the poor helpless
[31:09] homeless blind
[31:11] and those that walked and lived in fear
[31:14] and darkness
[31:15] at that particular time and the word of
[31:19] god
[31:19] even when a little portions of it was
[31:22] read out
[31:23] it was used by satan
[31:26] to mask it by using a language
[31:30] the people did not understand
[31:34] whether they were hearing a blessing or
[31:36] a curse
[31:37] they did not know but they were given
[31:39] the impression
[31:40] it was a holy thing to have the word of
[31:44] god
[31:44] hidden and massed away from them instead
[31:47] of the
[31:48] clear word of god so that they can
[31:51] judge for themselves oh my by the holy
[31:55] spirit
[31:55] and recognize what god is saying
[31:59] to them oh praise god brother sister
[32:03] what a time of day uh
[32:06] a day of darkness now we know this is
[32:09] just about
[32:10] 700 years after the times
[32:13] of the apostles and the people were
[32:16] living
[32:16] under that kind of religious domination
[32:20] trouble and fear under the
[32:24] spirit of feudalism and
[32:27] the roman inquisition
[32:30] uh i'm astonished that uh
[32:33] they would claim they were the ones that
[32:36] were being persecuted
[32:38] and the inquisition was against them but
[32:40] we
[32:41] know from from even natural history
[32:44] that it was rome that were the
[32:47] prime inquisitors and the ones
[32:51] that empowered the inquisition
[32:55] to be able to convert a
[32:58] protestants back into catholicism
[33:02] and there deal with them in the harshest
[33:05] tortures and and using all manner of
[33:09] racks and all manner of terrible
[33:12] horrible satanic
[33:14] inventions and cruel inventions
[33:17] that will strain the limits of humanity
[33:21] and turning men upon men
[33:24] into beasts squalor was everywhere
[33:28] hunger was everywhere
[33:31] superstition my friends
[33:35] but the millennium was ready to change
[33:40] time for a change time
[33:45] people were mad for that moment
[33:49] people that were there in that hour were
[33:51] designed for
[33:52] destiny praise god
[33:56] and it seemed in the darkness as if god
[33:58] had forgotten his own
[34:02] but never never ever get the devil to
[34:04] believe that you to believe that
[34:07] that god forgets his own for god never
[34:11] forgets his own
[34:12] he himself said in the word i will never
[34:16] leave you not forsake you
[34:17] but i'll be with you to the very end of
[34:20] the age
[34:22] well do we know that god stands in the
[34:25] shadows
[34:26] watching over his own i i'm just
[34:30] thinking of an old song that says
[34:32] standing somewhere in the shadows you'll
[34:35] find
[34:35] jesus he's the lord who cares and
[34:39] understands yes friends he may be
[34:43] standing
[34:44] watching and he is there watching over
[34:47] his own
[34:48] as a mother watches over their own
[34:52] all the time praise god god never
[34:54] forgets his
[34:55] own and he never leaves them without
[34:59] a witness glory to god hallelujah
[35:03] now friends thank god
[35:06] shortly after that this new millennium
[35:12] being born or praise god
[35:16] five we see it here the number of grace
[35:23] then the church of god
[35:27] acts chapter two came on the scene
[35:31] those disciples those apostles were the
[35:34] men and women for that moment as i
[35:37] believe
[35:38] we are those men and women for this
[35:42] moment
[35:42] to carry the word of the lord we may
[35:46] feel insufficient in ourselves but let
[35:49] me
[35:49] tell you by god's help we can
[35:53] by god's power we can by god's spirit we
[35:56] can
[35:57] and god never forgets his own but he
[36:00] will keep his promises
[36:02] as he blesses and anoints his children
[36:05] glory to god hallelujah
[36:06] now friends this is not a complicated
[36:09] deep
[36:10] dark doctrinal message of any kind but
[36:13] this is
[36:14] something to point you into the right
[36:16] direction
[36:17] this is something to inspire you
[36:20] something to encourage you
[36:22] and something that will set your heart
[36:25] of fire
[36:26] and give you purpose in the age in which
[36:29] we live and when suddenly the bible says
[36:33] suddenly when the day of pentecost was
[36:37] fully come
[36:38] and you know the rest of the story
[36:42] how that the holy spirit descended upon
[36:45] them
[36:46] and gave and the disciples and apostles
[36:49] gave great witness of the word of god
[36:53] and thousands were saved and baptized
[36:56] even on the first day without any
[36:59] marketing
[37:00] any kind of business administration
[37:03] public relations of any of the
[37:05] scientific thing
[37:07] we know that that has its place but
[37:10] certainly friends the real
[37:13] movement of god the real organism of god
[37:18] needs god to be on their side and
[37:21] anointing them and using them for his
[37:23] glory and honor
[37:24] and he'll take care of the rest of it
[37:28] and i'm resting
[37:29] upon that now when the when the church
[37:32] was born
[37:33] there hallelujah my brothers and sisters
[37:37] the church ages began the seven church
[37:40] changes found in the book of revelation
[37:42] chapter one
[37:44] which the bible speaks about those
[37:46] church agents
[37:47] coming those seven ages begun
[37:51] right there in the time of
[37:54] the apostles and we find out brothers
[37:59] that after the death of the apostle john
[38:04] then came others like saint martin
[38:09] irenaeus polycarp
[38:12] who was a direct disciple of john
[38:16] and others later came
[38:20] like looter and so friends
[38:25] god was going to restore back
[38:28] the original teaching of one god
[38:32] lost in the garden of eden satan tried
[38:36] to bury it with idolatry
[38:38] and a multiplicity of gods god brought
[38:42] abraham restored it back
[38:44] one god again satan
[38:47] with his never-ending attempts trying to
[38:50] break it up and destroy it through
[38:53] israel
[38:54] into uh egyptian idolatry
[38:57] god brought them out by a mighty hand
[38:59] and
[39:00] follow that story through the bible
[39:03] the fight between god versus
[39:06] satan one god versus many gods
[39:10] because if you don't believe in one god
[39:13] you start to believe
[39:14] in two then he can get you to believe in
[39:16] three
[39:17] and once he can get you to believe in
[39:19] three you can believe in 10
[39:21] 20 a million gods and you're not
[39:24] different than any other pagan
[39:27] religion that believes in many gods
[39:31] once you veer off of the revelation
[39:34] of hero israel the lord thy
[39:38] god is one lord amen hallelujah
[39:42] only one god and so friends
[39:47] the infant church after the time of the
[39:51] apostles
[39:52] began wandering in the wilderness of
[39:56] darkness and false doctrine
[40:00] and then they were weak
[40:03] hidden hunted persecuted
[40:08] and hunted down
[40:11] by the religious
[40:14] legions of rome
[40:20] moving with their pagan
[40:26] operations anointed
[40:30] by the same spirits that anointed
[40:34] pharaoh that the minded
[40:38] uh nebuchadnezzar that anointed herod
[40:43] always to destroy and to kill
[40:47] out the royal seed but the royal
[40:51] seed of god are the people for the
[40:54] moment they are
[40:54] here to stay for they are not just
[40:57] physical
[40:58] seed of abraham but they are the
[41:00] spiritual
[41:02] faith seed children of abraham by the
[41:05] grace of god
[41:06] that cannot die but in them god placed a
[41:10] portion
[41:11] of his eternal life for the gift of god
[41:15] is eternal life through jesus christ oh
[41:18] lord
[41:18] amen so here on the disguise of
[41:21] christianity
[41:23] satan operating under that guise
[41:27] the true church being hunted
[41:30] and persecuted but the church
[41:33] resisted and persisted by god's grace
[41:37] and endured slowly slowly
[41:42] and ever so slowly god
[41:45] began to bring forth men that would
[41:48] this declare the truth of the
[41:51] word of god not revelation one
[41:55] tells you not only the seven church ages
[41:58] began
[42:00] but god lays out from revelation 1 to 3
[42:04] how he would use seven messengers
[42:07] each one relegated
[42:10] to take care of a church age
[42:13] and to be the angel or messenger
[42:17] to that church age also to be the voice
[42:20] of god
[42:21] to that church age not that the man is
[42:25] god
[42:25] but the spirit of god will be the voice
[42:29] speaking through the man and pointing
[42:32] the people
[42:32] back to the word and the people of that
[42:36] day
[42:36] not understanding that god didn't need
[42:39] anyone
[42:40] need their education their wisdom for it
[42:43] was
[42:43] god himself that would be speaking
[42:45] through that man
[42:46] and so even though they may try to
[42:48] destroy the man destroy his repetition
[42:52] the word of god will stand and live
[42:54] forever
[42:55] for it was not a man's word it was the
[42:58] word of god and here's the word of god
[43:00] for it stands and live forever and
[43:03] forever glory to god and so god sent
[43:07] looter on the scene we know there were
[43:10] others before
[43:12] amen praise god but then god sent
[43:15] looter at this after that time upon the
[43:19] scene
[43:20] with the the revelation that the just
[43:23] shall
[43:23] live by faith not by works
[43:27] not by by the pain of money
[43:31] it's not by buying yourself out of
[43:33] purgatary or hell
[43:35] it's not by any righteousness of your
[43:38] own
[43:39] it's not that you can move the hand of
[43:42] god
[43:43] by by the size of the candles that you
[43:46] burn
[43:46] or by the multitude of them oh my
[43:50] friend but by faith in his word that
[43:53] just shall live by faith praise god
[43:57] hallelujah amen but then it took another
[44:00] 500 years from luther wesley down to
[44:05] pentecost
[44:06] to bring the church back to the place of
[44:10] a revelation of one god
[44:12] baptism in the name of the lord jesus
[44:15] christ
[44:17] and the baptism
[44:20] of the holy ghost then came this time
[44:25] when malachi 4 5
[44:28] should be fulfilled
[44:31] in the church that is still
[44:34] bound by traditions denomination
[44:38] and walking around in confusion
[44:41] and then god brought his servant prophet
[44:44] on the scene
[44:45] who right now many deny many
[44:49] refuse and will not receive but i tell
[44:52] you in the name of jesus christ
[44:54] one of these days your the world will
[44:58] recognize that he was
[45:01] a true prophet speaking in the name of
[45:04] the lord
[45:05] and around that time it was too late for
[45:08] some
[45:08] right now they do not understand fully
[45:11] what god
[45:12] is accomplishing and doing through him
[45:15] but that they will come
[45:16] when they recognize that god was using
[45:19] him
[45:20] to restore the fate of our fathers
[45:23] restore us back to the faith of our
[45:26] fathers
[45:27] hallelujah for god used him to reveal to
[45:31] us out of the word of god
[45:33] how clearly that eve did not eat an
[45:36] apple but it was adultery which was
[45:39] with the serpent who was not a snake at
[45:42] that time
[45:43] but later had to be put on his belly but
[45:46] was the missing link
[45:47] between uh man and the rest
[45:51] of the beast he was used of god
[45:54] to show us friends the trail of the
[45:57] serpent's seed
[45:59] oh my hallelujah
[46:02] satan's children operating true
[46:05] cain oh my friends the
[46:09] the false and true vine that began in
[46:12] the garden of eden
[46:14] twins that came forth from eve
[46:18] one of god and one of the devil oh
[46:21] my lord may god have mercy upon us
[46:25] yes sir and they are present in the
[46:28] church even today
[46:30] two different spirits in
[46:33] operation in the midst of god's
[46:36] last name church and god also
[46:39] used that's his servant prophet
[46:43] with the opening of the seventh seal
[46:46] mystery book to our generation
[46:51] for the glory of god and god used him
[46:54] also
[46:55] to lay out the word of god in such a way
[46:59] that the eyes of god's chosen ones
[47:03] as our text said
[47:07] that reserve for the latter times
[47:12] to be revealed in the last day i believe
[47:15] we are that group i believe you may be
[47:19] in that group
[47:21] predestinated for this hour and to be
[47:24] revealed in this last day
[47:26] for god will keep his bride hidden
[47:29] and as it was spoken will we unveil her
[47:33] or lift the veil that she may be
[47:36] revealed
[47:37] in the last day and then the rapture
[47:39] goes up
[47:40] it'll be too late then after that quick
[47:43] short mighty work and after this evil
[47:47] of satan and his dark legions of doom
[47:50] within the operating under the very
[47:54] framework
[47:55] of the church of the living god is
[47:58] exposed
[47:59] in the midst of what is called
[48:02] the church today that is steeped in the
[48:05] nationalism
[48:06] i want you to know friends that the true
[48:10] believing church of god did not just
[48:14] tumble upon the scene but we are the
[48:16] apple of his
[48:17] eye we are the fullness
[48:21] of this eternal purpose here
[48:24] we were made for this moment you were
[48:28] designed with this
[48:29] destiny and mind you was shaped to serve
[48:33] him
[48:34] to praise him to give him glory and to
[48:38] carry the word of god to bear
[48:41] reproach for his name in this last hour
[48:44] oh thank god i would encourage you
[48:48] never be ashamed of him but stand
[48:51] upon the word of god and here we are
[48:54] standing on the brink of the another
[48:57] millennium
[48:58] change from the sixth to the seventh
[49:02] oh glory to god hallelujah another
[49:05] millennium
[49:06] is just about to be born
[49:09] and the world is undergoing the throes
[49:13] and the birth pains of change
[49:16] thank god the mighty angel
[49:19] praise god has come down according to
[49:22] revelation
[49:24] amen 10 1-7
[49:27] and by the instrumentality of the sound
[49:30] angel
[49:32] has brought forth his mighty word and
[49:36] said the church ages
[49:38] are now over time
[49:41] shall be no more it doesn't mean
[49:44] earthly time shall be no more but the
[49:48] time for the ages are now over
[49:52] the people who are of gods gods elected
[49:56] are ready to move back into the first
[49:58] day the new day
[50:00] amen praise the lord we'll expand on
[50:03] that in
[50:03] other preachings and teachings but right
[50:05] now friends
[50:06] we are in the midst of the changing of
[50:09] an age
[50:10] as i have been emphasizing uh
[50:13] there in the word of god hallelujah and
[50:16] we are not here to
[50:17] present to you canned bible studies of
[50:20] man that is so beautifully laid
[50:24] out and so psychologically
[50:27] uh place there for you and just
[50:31] available for you you don't have to be
[50:34] any more an eagle anymore
[50:37] think about it the changing of the age
[50:41] jet from gentile to jews back again
[50:44] the light going from the west back to
[50:47] the east again
[50:48] lord of god yes sir oh praise god
[50:52] gentile the gentile day is over praise
[50:56] god
[50:57] as the songwriter said nations are
[51:00] breaking
[51:01] and israel's awakening the signs that
[51:04] the prophets
[51:05] foretold gentiled as
[51:09] numbered with horrors and cumbered
[51:12] return all dispersed to your own
[51:16] for the day of redemption
[51:20] is so near very near
[51:23] man's hearts are failing for fear
[51:27] be filled with god's spirit your lamb
[51:31] streamed and clear
[51:33] look up your redemption
[51:36] is there yes
[51:39] you were made for this moment you were
[51:43] made for this season and time
[51:46] you were designed with a destiny to
[51:50] fulfill the word of god for this hour
[51:54] to be unveiled to be revealed
[51:57] in this last day not just the unveiling
[52:01] of the mighty god
[52:02] back there 1900 years ago
[52:06] not the unveiling of the mighty god all
[52:09] just uh in the ministry
[52:13] of brother william marion branham
[52:15] unveiling
[52:16] the mighty god who is the word
[52:20] but the unveiling of the mighty god in
[52:22] the bright form
[52:24] it's taking place even now god
[52:28] revealing and unveiling his own
[52:31] taking his adopted sons and daughters
[52:34] and placing them before the public
[52:36] so the public would recognize that these
[52:39] are the sons of god
[52:41] these are the children of the most high
[52:44] oh praise
[52:45] god forevermore here we are friends
[52:48] to real to go on and to carry
[52:51] the word of god nothing could completely
[52:54] destroy the church
[52:57] the conquer worm the palmer worm
[53:00] the caterpillar and even the locusts
[53:03] eating away
[53:05] at the true church of god and up
[53:08] down it right down to a stump
[53:11] where the devil thought the church was
[53:14] dead but god promised
[53:15] he would restore and that's the reason
[53:18] why
[53:19] he sent the prophet william aaron
[53:22] branham
[53:22] to come on the scene the messenger
[53:26] the last church age messenger to come
[53:29] upon the scene
[53:30] and to restore back the truth of the
[53:33] word of god
[53:35] that hero israel people of god there's
[53:37] only one god
[53:39] water baptism is in the name of jesus
[53:41] christ
[53:42] there is no other name given under
[53:44] heaven whereby we must be saved these
[53:47] are simple
[53:48] apparently simple themes but god

[54:52] amen so praise god in every home
[54:57] as i'm beginning to wind up now in every

[55:01] there are vessels that we don't use just
[55:04] for every meal
[55:06] but they are set apart they place
[55:09] somewhere and then at some
[55:12] other time when we have special guests
[55:14] they are taken
[55:15] out they are vessels of honor and when
[55:18] those
[55:19] vessels of honor that are taken out from
[55:22] hiding
[55:23] they're taken out from where they were
[55:25] reserved and preserved
[55:27] and covered up then god begins to unveil
[55:31] them
[55:31] to the world for his glory and for his
[55:35] honor praise
[55:36] god hallelujah amen now we know those
[55:40] vessels when they are brought out they
[55:42] are not for the use of eating weakness
[55:45] and beans and burgers and biscuits
[55:49] but it's there to use for the best takes
[55:54] the best seven course meal that you can
[55:56] think about
[55:57] is being used on those vessels
[56:01] and buy those vessels for his glory
[56:04] hallelujah
[56:05] amen and amen special

[56:56] of the living god hallelujah and the
[56:58] unveiling
[56:59] of the mighty god within his bride
[57:03] not in jesus back there but the mighty
[57:06] god that was unveiled in christ is now
[57:09] being unveiled
[57:11] in his beloved ones for this hour who
[57:14] were
[57:14] made and predestinated for this moment
[57:19] praise god hallelujah so god's true
[57:22] church is not designed by man it's not
[57:25] designed by
[57:26] man's system man's organization
[57:30] and administration but god set
[57:33] in the church his supernatural spiritual
[57:37] administration and no matter what anyone
[57:40] says the
[57:41] book of acts is the blueprint for the
[57:43] church of the living god
[57:44] and anyone any organization any church
[57:48] that sways away from the blueprint and
[57:51] changes the dynamics the measurements
[57:54] the balance the plumb line
[57:56] of the great architect who created
[57:58] earth's shield sky
[58:00] my friends you will be in deep trouble
[58:03] for the great architect
[58:04] knows exactly what he is doing praise
[58:08] god hallelujah
[58:09] i want to thank god that we want to
[58:13] design
[58:15] for the israel was not designed
[58:18] to fit in to egyptian culture
[58:22] and the true believer is not fit in to
[58:25] be conformed to this world
[58:27] but to be transformed by the power of
[58:29] god
[58:30] the true believer israel
[58:34] was not designed to be slaves
[58:37] and to stay in a state of slavery
[58:41] israel was designed to be a free
[58:44] people and so is the true believer
[58:48] designed not to be a slave to the habits
[58:50] of sin
[58:51] and the works of this world but to go
[58:55] and enjoy the freedom of jesus christ
[58:59] israel was not designed to be a
[59:02] wandering people
[59:04] but to be a people in their own land
[59:07] given to them
[59:08] by the true and living god the most high
[59:12] they were not designed to be a people
[59:14] that will ever be in captivity
[59:16] and the true believer was not designed
[59:19] to
[59:19] remain in captivity oh for we are god's
[59:23] eagles for this hour the most pitiful
[59:26] sight
[59:27] is to see an eagle caged inside of a zoo
[59:30] with his british feathers drooping
[59:33] that's those sharp talons that were
[59:36] created by
[59:37] god to hunt to receive fresh
[59:40] killed meat oh my that was
[59:44] designed by god to eat fresh killed
[59:47] bloody bleeding
[59:48] lamb word that the eagle
[59:52] finds itself in a denominational zoo
[59:55] losing
[59:55] those talons losing the sharpness of its
[59:58] curved beak
[1:00:00] amen to be able to hook on and grab and
[1:00:02] hold to
[1:00:03] god's unchanging hand of his divine word
[1:00:07] all praise his holy and precious name
[1:00:10] and and so the evil is a pitiful sight
[1:00:13] when
[1:00:14] the the eagle falls to the ground
[1:00:18] and becomes denominationally diseased
[1:00:21] with all kinds of man-made designs
[1:00:24] not meant to scrape and claw
[1:00:27] and dig for worms and dig for things up
[1:00:31] on this earth
[1:00:33] but my god the eagle was meant to soar
[1:00:36] in the heavenly places
[1:00:39] to rise up into the presence of glory of
[1:00:42] god
[1:00:43] may god help you if you've lost your
[1:00:45] wings
[1:00:46] if you've lost your your talents you
[1:00:48] lost your beak
[1:00:49] come back to your foundations come back
[1:00:53] to the word of god
[1:00:54] go back to god's original intention for
[1:00:57] you
[1:00:57] and then god will bless you and raise
[1:01:00] you up in the heavenlies
[1:01:02] where you back where you belong amen
[1:01:05] we are not designed israel was never
[1:01:08] designed for
[1:01:09] bigotry and hatred and discrimination
[1:01:12] it was not there in them oh
[1:01:15] my many call themselves jews
[1:01:18] and they are not but the bible says
[1:01:22] no they are false amen may god help us
[1:01:26] brothers to realize that a true
[1:01:28] christian do
[1:01:29] not have these qualities within their
[1:01:31] heart it's not even
[1:01:33] in them because god's love consumes them
[1:01:37] and takes them over
[1:01:38] and there is nothing else there but the
[1:01:41] love and grace of god
[1:01:42] and lastly as true believers made for
[1:01:46] the moment
[1:01:48] we were not designed for any form of
[1:01:51] defeat
[1:01:52] for first john 4 says greater is he that
[1:01:56] is in you
[1:01:58] than he that is in the world praise god
[1:02:02] and also jesus said
[1:02:06] be of good courage for i have overcome
[1:02:09] the world
[1:02:10] the overcomer is in you so there is
[1:02:13] nothing that you cannot overcome
[1:02:16] for he overcomes everything for you the
[1:02:19] battle
[1:02:20] is not yours but the battle is the
[1:02:23] lord's
[1:02:24] and he is more than a conqueror who
[1:02:27] lives within you
[1:02:28] and that is the reason why we can say
[1:02:30] that also
[1:02:32] we are more than conquerors for he
[1:02:34] conquered
[1:02:35] satan sin death hell
[1:02:38] and the grave and he lives in you and me
[1:02:42] today
[1:02:42] for he said in that day you will know
[1:02:44] i'm in the father the father in me
[1:02:46] and i in you so it doesn't matter my
[1:02:49] friend
[1:02:50] what is happening in your life at this
[1:02:53] very
[1:02:53] moment believe me in the name of the
[1:02:56] lord
[1:02:57] that no matter what is happening in your
[1:03:00] life
[1:03:00] no matter how dark it is believer no
[1:03:03] matter how it is whether you are not to
[1:03:06] believe another church goal
[1:03:08] but you in your heart still a child
[1:03:11] of the most high god you were made for
[1:03:15] this moment
[1:03:16] and by god to serve him and the
[1:03:19] glory
[1:03:20] glorify his name for matthew 16 18 he
[1:03:23] says
[1:03:23] i will build my church and the gates of
[1:03:27] hell shall not prevail against it
[1:03:30] you were made for this moment you were
[1:03:33] designed for
[1:03:34] this day glory to god hallelujah
[1:03:37] and you don't my friends need to conform
[1:03:40] to the world
[1:03:41] but you need to believe god and that you
[1:03:44] can still
[1:03:45] live the way god wants you to live and
[1:03:48] to
[1:03:48] overcome and live a spirit-filled
[1:03:52] holy ghost anointed life of god
[1:03:55] and believe in one god and deny
[1:03:59] these denominational teachings of three
[1:04:01] gods and three and one
[1:04:03] and all such unbelievable nonsense
[1:04:07] and come back to the original faith hero
[1:04:10] israel there is the lord thy god
[1:04:14] is one lord and no one can show me
[1:04:17] where god ever change his mind
[1:04:20] about his word being won and suddenly
[1:04:23] becoming three god is one god
[1:04:27] and we believe in only one god and the
[1:04:30] name of that god is jesus christ
[1:04:34] and that is why we baptize in his name
[1:04:37] and we pray and do all we do
[1:04:40] in the name of jesus christ your
[1:04:43] unchanging god hallelujah
[1:04:45] amen we are still holding to god's
[1:04:48] unchanging hand
[1:04:50] for he's an unchanging god his word is
[1:04:53] unchanging
[1:04:54] and we hold to it amen we hate sin
[1:04:59] but we love the sinner as god loves the
[1:05:02] sinner
[1:05:03] but hates his sin and god designs us
[1:05:07] and we have what the world needs and
[1:05:10] this is our day
[1:05:12] we're kept for this hour
[1:05:15] and to receive this revelation and to
[1:05:18] prepare
[1:05:19] for the rapture before it goes into the
[1:05:23] tribulation
[1:05:25] after which armageddon after which
[1:05:28] we will go into the great time of the
[1:05:31] great
[1:05:32] millennium which is the seventh
[1:05:36] millennium back to eden again
[1:05:39] the complete cycle of the work and the
[1:05:42] plan of god
[1:05:44] being fulfilled in our day and in our
[1:05:46] time
[1:05:47] do you recognize your position in christ
[1:05:50] and in his word
[1:05:52] that you were really designed and made
[1:05:55] for this moment designed for this day
[1:05:59] and that's the reason why you have
[1:06:01] always been different you couldn't
[1:06:04] recognize what it was
[1:06:06] you didn't know what was speaking to you
[1:06:09] what was leaving you what was guiding
[1:06:11] you
[1:06:11] what was making you act the way you were
[1:06:14] acting
[1:06:15] but you were like an eagle trying to
[1:06:17] live in a chicken
[1:06:19] pen a barn house of something not a
[1:06:22] national
[1:06:23] build so-called teaching canned
[1:06:26] worms or living off of something like
[1:06:29] that but you've come to recognize
[1:06:31] your day your time
[1:06:34] your moment and that you were made
[1:06:38] for this moment the lord bless you
[1:06:41] and keep you and cause his face to shine
[1:06:44] upon you and
[1:06:46] grant you peace now and forevermore
