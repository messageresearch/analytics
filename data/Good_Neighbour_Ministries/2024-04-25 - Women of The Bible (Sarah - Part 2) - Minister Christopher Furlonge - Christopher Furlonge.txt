we ever go to war you want me as a soldier with you okay H if I if we got to go to war you want me as a soldier you want some of these brothers that are in here that are standing on the word of God

amen praise God Joshua knew exactly what he was facing when he had to go and face the enemy and when he had a need he just spoke the word of God and God met the need amen praise God tonight we've got our precious brother Christopher who I know is going to bless us immensely if you have come with expectation in your heart and you believe that God can speak simple needs just be listening just be listening how many enjoyed the service on Sunday amen praise God what a blessing you just had to be listening because the holy spirit is speaking lip to ear to the children of God to the attributes of God giving them the faith that they need in this day and in this hour and it's not going to going to be the way that you might think it's going to come but it's going to come by a supernatural Revelation just like the Rapture it's going to happen in the twinkling of an eye father we so appreciate this opportunity tonight Lord we're under great expectation Lord because we know that every time we assemble into your presence you're right there in the midst won't you speak to the hearts tonight Lord and oh God just fill every heart discern every need Lord and let us leave tonight rejoicing knowing that once again we've been in the presence of the King Grant it we pray in Jesus name God bless you brother [Music] Christopher praise the Lord hallelujah it's good to be here in the house of the Lord tonight amen GA around his word tonight is Bible study amen good to see each and every one of you here tonight amen praise the Lord just want to greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen hallelujah Glory so we want to continue on our little study that we started couple of weeks ago amen and we're doing the woman in the Bible and we started out on Sarah and and we just want to continue on her she's one of the most significant wom in the Bible to me amen because she types you amen hallelujah and we just heard our pastor say said there that we expecting a change a body change and and God portrayed that change literally in Sarah amen so we know what God can do for you and I hallelujah praise the Lord praise God so we see I just want to recap a little bit just be seated for a little bit amen just want to recap briefly Amen to just jog your memory a little bit you know as we say repetition is the mother of learning amen you repeat certain things amen hallelujah it's like a record when you keep playing it playing it or you keep singing a song or uh repeating a scripture or it's get embedded in your soul amen hallelujah and that's uh a real teacher does that I can't say I'm a real teacher but a real teacher does that amen and God is our teacher amen amen and he led by example amen hallelujah so we saw through the last time amen God gave Abraham a promise amen an unconditional promise nothing attached it just God so chose Abraham amen by Grace by Grace amen and by Grace you are saved you are here by grace tonight so many billion people are in the world but God saved you and called you out in this same time thank you Lord amen just think of it of all maybe in Abraham's time so many right you think Abraham was a a religious person in the sense a Believer anyway like that no he wasn't amen but by Grace God chose Abraham and when God God chose a man amen he also as he he he he spoke to Abraham to leave his country and and depart he he also chose his wife with him amen hallelujah praise God and we see through faith as the scripture read here Sarah herself received strength to receive seed and was delivered of a child child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who made the promise amen hallelujah now you see L the god called Abraham to leave his country to separate himself from all unbelief amen from his family all the things that would hinder him amen what is hindering you tonight and God is calling for a total separation from unbelief from the things that will prevent you from fulfilling his promise in this end time amen amen hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus and we saw that how Abraham took his wife and lot his son's brother and all their substance and left his country and journeyed amen into a far country right but God said to Abraham I going to show you where I going to lead you man we have never been on this partway before this journey before but God is leading us and showing us and taking us to that promise that he has for us in this end time Amen brother amen abolutely what Pro what did God promise you in the same time amen hallelujah think about it praise God and you see when God called Abraham as we said he called for total separation separate yourself from your Kinsmen separate yourself from your father's house separate from all your Associates and inate yourself from all those things things that would keep you back and walk with me do you want to walk with the Lord today man do you want to follow friends do you want to follow the world because broad is the way that leads to destruction and many on that road many it's like a a a a a a a dead fish flowing down the stream but it takes a living fish to go Upstream to go against all the opposition and the tithes of this world that has been offering and coming against us think about the week you had all the challenges that you had thank God he made a way for you to be here tonight hallelujah amen you could have stayed home man so I going to listen on there but yes we we have to work we have to do things amen we're not a legalists amen hallelujah But as God would allow you to be here in his presence these Bible studies are just to encourage you to build up your faith you say okay again Bible study again our next service no it's for your own benefit there is something great that is happening Hallelujah when Abraham was walking through he was in a Wilderness he went to you know that's right man he went in a Wilderness Journey wasn't not a whole set of people around him and and everything like that to distract him amen hallelujah thank you Lord and this journey is a Wilderness Journey For Us amen hallelujah sometimes you feel that you're all alone but you're not alone God has promised that he will not leave you nor forsake you amen and when you're really down and out that is the time he comes on the scene when you think all hope is gone no end man the problems the situation that you're are facing it's all over no God is there to deliver you because he share his glory with no man he wants to receive the glory he wants to receive the praise what did he do for you this week hallelujah amen you see the god that we are serving is Alive and Well amen and you can trust him all the way not part of the way all the way all the way hallelujah praise God thank you Lord amen you see as they kept on moving God God reminded Abraham and Sarah of the promise that he made to them amen in Genesis 127 it says and the Lord appeared unto Abraham and said unto thy seed will I give this land just think of it so he's telling Abraham you're going to have children you're reminded him of the promise amen hallelujah and you see as they kept on moving as we said the last time a change already started to happen in their lives it was both physically amen and spiritually too because Abraham never staggered at the faith that God gave him amen hallelujah he never staggered he believe and trusted God that the promise that he made to him he's going to fulfill it hallelujah praise God thank you Lord hallelujah now we see that change actually literally happened because when they were went down to Egypt amen hallelujah a 60y old granny or or 75 year old I 60 or 75 years she was granny they saw this woman as a beautiful young lady Amen in as so much the king wanted to take her as wife amen hallelujah just imagine that all the wrinkles started to disappear amen hallelujah the in the the chain started inside and it was expressing on the outside so when I st change start it in you in the inside it's got to be revealed or expressed on the outside that's right amen hallelujah the places that you used to go you're not you don't go them no more the things you used to say the songs you used to sing it's a new song you're singing now hallelujah praise God thank you Lord Jesus so we see the Egyptians said oh behold the woman that she was very fear she started to become beautiful and young again Amen in has so much amen the king wanted her as wife but you know God never promised amen someone else to have a child with Sarah he promised Abraham that's right amen hallelujah the promise is unto you men this change is for you make it personal tonight hallelujah thank you Lord you see God promised Abraham that Sarah would be a mother of Nations and that she would conceive and bear a son but you know as time passed by you know as most of us human beings you know we start to falter a little bit we start to get a little bit weak our faith start to diminish amen and you know something she said to Abraham amen you know I'm old God really didn't promise you know that I going to have a child maybe I going to help God you think you're going to help out God man she tried to intervene and help God bring the promise to pass as so many of us will want to do Hallelujah my you see now Sarah Abraham wives bear him no children children and she had a handmade an Egyptian whose name was hagga so he said why don't you take hagga as your wife you know I can have a old old I'm dried up I passed the age of childbearing maybe through your handmade you know this going to come to pass but you don't try to work out God's way perfect wayen and this was God's permissive will and it ended up even to all the problems we have in the world today with all these countries coming against the promised Nation of Israel amen hallelujah thank you Lord praise God so Sarah Abraham's wife took hagga her handmade the Egyptian after Abraham had dwelt 10 years in the land of Canaan and gave her to her husband to be his wife and there is as we said a lot of conflict and trouble trouble started even on to this day amen hallelujah so we let's continue our study and we going to read our scripture taking from Genesis 18 verse 1 where we will see how God appeared unto Abraham amen Genesis say 181 amen and before and as the time Drew near just want to read yeah before we read the scripture a man comes up it wasn't a man it was an angel that angel was none other than almighty God manifested in flesh am so I was thinking amen when God created the heavens and this word and everything here what material did he use he just spoke things into existence amen so when he appeared he could have just called some elements man and form a body and just step right into it could he do that to you today man remember just be reminded God when he when the Lord was here on Earth he took something already that was created amen and multiplied it amen but in this day what did he take when he spoke squirrel into existence he took the spoken word amen hallelujah and that same spoken word is in you and I today yes sir so you can create things with the spoken word what are you lacking today what do you have need of today speak it into existence hallelujah praise God so our scripture reading let's go to our scripture reading here praise Lord amen Genesis 18 vers one reading down and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamory and he sat in the 10th Door In the Heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself towards the ground and said my lords listen he saw three men but what did he re recognize Lord the Lord amen hallelujah man he wasn't um having some kind of Mirage or something amen because he was in the desert amen he recognized the almighty God himself that spoke to him before he recognized that voice yes sir amen hallelujah if now I have f favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant let a little water I pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourself under the tree and I will fetch a morcel of bread and comfort ye your hearts after that he shall pass on for therefore I ye come to your servant and they said so do as thou Hast said and Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine wheat meal need it make cakes upon the herd and Abraham ran unto the herd and fetched the calf tender and good and gave it unto a young man and he hasted to dress it and he took butter milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat now this is the most significant part of Sarah amen hallelujah and said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said beh hold in the sent amen and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life amen hallelujah and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son not me she shall yes sir positive she shall shall have a son man and Sarah heard it in the T door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of woman so you are mature people you can understand what is been saying here she could not have any children amen amen because a time for daring children was over man her womb was dried up therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also amen so in her heart amen she kind of a little doubting amen hallelujah praise God Amen and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of short be a child which I'm old and here it is is anything too hard for the Lord ask ourselves tonight is anything you can ask the Lord tonight it's too hard for him to do my your wife your children your husband job a house salvation healing for the body on healing for the soul is anything too hard for the Lord tonight no sir what would you ask him tonight oh Goden what is your request for him tonight Hallelujah man if there be anyone sick who is listening here in tonight amen on the air or here tonight amen may his hand of mercy and Grace and healing be upon you even right now thank you grant it Lord father receive amen hallelujah amen praise God Amen then Sarah denied saying I laugh not but she was afraid and he said nay but thou this laugh let's bow our hearts gracious God and Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for the reading of your word tonight Lord to some this might be just be a a a story or just something like that out there a nice reading or nice thing like that but but to us dear God this is a promise for us Lord father that there is nothing that is too hard for you to do Lord father and whatever that you have promised Lord father oh God you shall Grant it unto all those that could believe and who could receive it tonight Lord bless us tonight Lord as we just study a little part your word tonight and just let it open up the the hearts of the people Lord that they may receive something Lord that may give them strength for this journey Lord father bless us this night as we commit all into your hand hands in Jesus name we pray amen anden you may be seated tonight Hallelujah you see now when God told Abraham when he met him in that body he had to wash the dust of his feet so it actually was a literal physical body that Abraham wasn't no Spirit or some ghost that Abraham met or some Mirage that Abraham met met in that in in the plains of mmory it was a literal person right amen hallelujah a person that he could have sat down with eat with and fellowship with amen amen hallelujah amen praise God and you know something this personen this one man was God himself in a human form as mzc hallelujah praise God and he could have discern the spirit and the thoughts of Sarah yes sir did God do that in this end time and God even right now can discern your thoughts and your spirit right now while you're sitting Canen this God that we serve amen he knows your need tonight and you're going to speak directly to that need thank you amen hallelujah it's a supernatural God that we sering amen I don't know your need tonight you might not know my need tonight but he knows your need tonight hallelujah amen thank you Lord Jesus amen so what are you thinking tonight amen hallelujah praise God thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord and Sarah yeah watch this now Sarah in the tent laughed in inside even when God back was turned to her amen could you turn like like our Prophet demonstrated to us he turned his back toward the audience and just called people out it was the same God that visited Abraham there was here in our midst amen visiting this land in this time man showing you is the same yesterday today and forever and you can do it the same tonight amen hallelujah praise God you see he said according to the time of life I'm going to visit you Sarah nearly a 90 year old woman I'm going to visit you according to the time of life I'm going to visit you I'm going to confirm my Covenant and that promise that I made to you am Hallelujah I am going to bring the promise to pass amen hallelujah don't we have uh so many precious promises for each and every one of us today amen God says he's going to bless you above all things above all amen things what things that you concerned about above all that you know we concerned about things physical things things yes yeah but God said he's going to bless you above all that what a promise for us and above all that amen what about the best promise that you could receive that Sarah received amen about the change yes sir amen hallelujah that is for each and every one of us here tonight Hallelujah and as you walk in your Christian Journey your change already started at the day that you commit your life to the Lord your change already started amen hallelujah amen hallelujah and it's going to show on the way Hallelujah you see Sarah got scared man she got scared so she was kind of a little bit you know the prophet said that she got scared that's why she kind of laughed kind of you know giggled inside little bit of Doubt kind of trying to enter in could God do something like this to me so old a woman yes he can man and I know even within the ministry that a some of these brothers went out and pray for women who were Barren and now the children are of age some of them are married and everything test testimonies upon testimonies upon testimonies coming I have two or three personal ones amen that people who could not have children amen they were prayed for amen N9 months after here comes the child amen hallelujah amen hallelujah anything too hard for God my my my you got the spoken word in you start exercising the gift that God has placed in your heart amen people who come across your part is not by chance or by Guess Oren not by chance or guest people who come across your pathway and God wants you to be a witness to them to show through you his power amen hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah you see God knew her heart and with with assurity he knew her thoughts you could fool God God knows your intentions amen he knows what you're thinking of Amen your desires and everything amen hallelujah and he he's here amen he say he's going to grant you your heart's desires amen hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus blessed be his wonderful name just excuse me bit here please thank you don't know if I going to finish this little study here tonight but it's quite a bit Sarah amen as they say a good a good teacher takes his time a little bite at a time amen you know when we were studying in school we we call it cramming last day for exam you want to study everything when you go in the exam room you forget everything because you're trying to pull out everything coming out one time have you experienced that amen so as time goes a little at a time a little at a time amen a little by here a little there a little am amen that's how we build fit praise God hallelujah so we want to take a look a little bit here that's Sarah's faith in God's promise right you see Sarah had been unable to have children for many years she decided to give her handmade hagga to her husband in order to obtain children by her this was not how God intended to give Abraham and Sarah and a but was a mistake which they had learned to more if they had learned to trust God more would have just you know abandoned that idea amen leave it up to God to do it because it's God who is going to make the promise come to pass amen hallelujah and as we see cause a whole set of trouble after that you see years past ishma grew up and had a relationship with his father and still Sarah remained childless amen finally when she was 90 years old as we have read God again promised her reminded her of the promise that he did right you see and at first she laughed amen now notice in verse 12 and in verse vers 13 therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I have grown old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also and the Lord said to Abraham why did Sarah laugh saying surely I surely shall I surely be a child since I am old and as we have read is there anything too hard for the Lord to do if you go with one thing tonight go with just that one statement is anytime you come across any situation any challenge in your life ask yourself is there anything to hard the Lord to do man remind yourself over and anytime you come in keep thaten and you see how your Christian walk is going to Blossom amen hallelujah you see God is Not hindered by physical limitations right at the appointed time I will return to you amen amen you see he already said at the appointed time so God has appointments with you and I man it might not be the time that you thinking of man but he has there time yes he does Amen a specific time I going to be there at that time men an appointment with you and I but we are humans we kind of little bit impatient we are the the the super uh um instant kind of religion you want it right where right now instantaneous I ask for this I want it right now in the name of Jesus I want it now doesn't work so no ask for God's perfect will for yourself what is your perfect will Lord let thy perfect will be done amen hallelujah hallelujah praise God sometimes God is testing us to see if you got patience amen you say wait say wait I say wait upon the Lord hallelujah amen hallelujah amen and as we have read you see by faith Sarah herself also receives strength to conceive who gave her that strength almighty God himself where is your help come from where does your strength come from amen we need to be reminded of that it's not in ourself we could accomplish anything but it's by his grace by his strength by the knowledge by the wisdom by everything that he gives that we can acquire and get things done and accomplish in our lives hallelujah amen praise God thank you Lord Jesus now as we said last time Sarah amen is the only woman in the Bible whose name was changed by God Amen from Sarai to Sarah we have we have Jacob Amen to Israel we have um what's his name again um Saul to Paul and all those other ones right if you a good uh Bible student you remember all the the other ones amen hallelujah but she was the only woman that God changed her name from Sarai to Sarah amen and the meaning of Sarah means princess she was not only to be Abraham's princess but the princess of a large race of people amen sah was blessed by God to become a royal princess she would be a the mother of a Nation to come and she would also be a mother of kings of people but that's not the final one she was the royal lineage amen that David would come through Amen to produce this savior of the world yes sir amen hallelujah so just think of iten we had a great nation that came out of ishmail because God promised that he going to bless Abraham's seed and he couldn't hold withhold his promise is ishmael's seed blessed think of it amen when God makes a promise he makes it that's it amen so when God through Isaac amen God made that promise to him too amen he had to bless him hallelujah praise the Lord her ancestry and family life Abraham's Sarah was Abraham's half sister same father but different mother amen so when Abraham went down to Egypt and he told the people down in Egypt that's you know that's my sister it was a half liar amen but there nothing like a half lie a Lie Is A Lie man it a no black and white cow or black and white bird it's either it's black or it's either it's white man you know he was speaking 50% truth but it's still alive Hallelujah yeah amen praise God you see where did she live according to the scriptures she lived with Abraham in ear of the childes and that was an idolatry Nation they worship idols and God took Abraham out of that situation imagine an idol worshipper and placed his promise on that man amen won't we all Idol worshippers think of it anything that you placed in the front of the true and living God is your idol car house wife husband children Job movie stars this that to the money amen anything that you place before the almighty God that becomes your God and you become an idol worshiper to that amen hallelujah praise God now i' like to just do deal with a uh um a few little things here to bring it to your attention what was Sarah's weakness amen as we see in Genesis 162 amen she locked feet amen Sarah said unto Abraham behold now the Lord hath restrained me from bearing I pray thee go into unto my maid it may be that I may obtain children by her and Abraham hearkened to the voice of Sarah amen men so there we see her faith begins to waveren also she was a good schema or trickster she could have talked in Abraham into amen or persuaded Abraham into have a child by hagga amen hallelujah amen now we want to look a little bit of the strength of Sarah right as we see and we spoke a little bit before if someone your husband comes and tells you just take up everything that we have saved you know leave everything property lands family everything and just we're going to move out from here and I'm going to take you into a place that an angel came and told me or you might say God came and told me right into a place but he didn't tell me exactly where now but I believe and we going what would you do it it it so looks so unsure right not certain right you're just like walking blindly and you're believing on something amen that deep down your heart is going to come to pass and you take your wife your children your all your possession and you just left and go amen but you know something Sarah amen trusted a husband and she was submissive to him and obeyed him amen think about yourself husbands wives men children amen submissive Amen to the ones that are in Authority Amen to the pastor to the deacons to your your mother your father even to your boss even to the rulers of the land the script tells you amen obey them Hallelujah and in First Peter 3:5 says for this is the way the holy woman of the past who put their hope in God used to Adorn themselves they submitted man Hallelujah themselves to their own husbands like Sarah who obeyed Abraham and called him Lord amen not anything man hey you calling them by some some kind of name you know abusive name or some kind of thing men that too much of that out there she called him Lord do mean real submission amen hallelujah hallelujah amen thank you Lord praise be to his wonderful name she Praises God Amen when she received the promise are you thankful that b God does something for you that you give him thanks and not just thanks within she Express Thanks outwardly amen where we say Thanksgiving you come into the house of the Lord you raise your hands and thank the Lord for your healing thank the Lord for making a way for youen thank the Lord for salvation thank the Lord for every single thing the bread life that he gives you for waking you up in the morning men Hallelujah man she was very thankful and so too does every Christian God to be thankful to the Lord for what he is doing what he is has done and what he's going to do be under expectation for the things that you have need of thank him amen hallelujah praise Goden and she was a jolly person because here in in in Genesis 21:7 it says and she said who have said unto Abraham that Sarah should have given children sock for I have borne him a son in all age amen so she was very very happy in her self man a person that is Barren couldn't have any children come now and have a child ain't she going to be real happy and joyful and thankful amen you going to sing look and see what the Lord have done hallelujah amen hallelujah amen hallelujah when Miriam and them were crossed the Red Sea and they were delivered from the hands of pharaoh did they just sit down and just you know man they begin to

lessons we want to learn from her life when God called Abraham to leave the country and family to go a Strange Land there was no question in Sarah's heart that she would would not follow her husband she followed him amen if God calls a man he calls his also men Hallelujah the two are one Hallelujah in chapter 12 in Genesis we see Hallelujah now I don't want to go over that let me just skip that a little bit there man okay no I'm going Abraham gives lot the choice of land amen lot chose the best land but ultimately Abraham prospered because of his generosity while lot suffered for his selfishness amen lot went for the glitter and glamour of the world Amen Hallelujah and the world has lot of glitter and glamour to attract you and pull you inen don't fall for this the the the schemes of the the enemy amen the tricks Hallelujah sometimes our husbands make decisions that don't make sense to us and that we don't and things that we don't like listen but we need to trust God to lead to to be led through our husband and to follow with good attitude are we listening tonight are we here sometimes the end result will bring Prosperity or sometimes it will bring poverty it all depends on

wicked one want to bring disconnection confusion everything else amen hallelujah amen recognize where your attacks are coming from hallelujah amen in Genesis 17 1217 it says we see Abraham tries to protect his own skin by a lie Amen Hallelujah by saying that Sarah is his sister amen but in this verse it tells us because of Sarah God send plagues to pharaoh to protect that seed amen so you see the love of God being expressed amen through Sarah amen that God put a whole nation in in confusion to protect his seed what is going to do for you and I my my my Hallelujah just think of this little little things you know just hidden there for our example man and I like just God just just allowing it to be to to bring forth for you and I to encourage us that's right amen many are all few are chosen his love for you for God so loved this whole world that he gave his only begotten son to save you and I his children men hallelujah what what love such wondrous love that God as we could say could save a sinner such as I as I man we no good no no good good person here know it's only by his grace only by his grace amen he saved us and called us out amen hallelujah thank you Lord praise God in Genesis 161 says Sarah followed the customs of her culture because remember she came out from the ear of the childes right Pagan worshippers Idol worshippers amen and you know when we leave the world we still come across with some of the habits cultural habits amen and try to follow it and implement it into our Christian walk amen and here is an example that was Sarah trying to do to take her handmaiden amen and to have an immoral affair with her Amen to bring forth a child amen imagine that simple little things like that we try to cross bring it over but when God says separate separate everything hallelujah amen so that was part of their culture amen as the Romans and all the Pagan Customs back then amen just free go for everybody amen like that amen another life lesson that this verse is given to us is God had promised she was impatient and unbelieving of God's promise so she took matters into her own hands to make things happen amen and when we do thaten we make trouble for our own selves for our own selves amen hallelujah when you try to help out God amen you make trouble for your own self and the result is a big mess and then you have to run to the pastor run to the Deacon run to this one run to bail me out you went ahead Rush ahead making decisions and choices with first without praying man and when you pray You Must Believe amen because without faith it is impossible to please God so when you pray you pray with faith that God what he has promised to you will bring it to pass hallelujah thank you Lord in Genesis 165 it says Sarah blame shifted Abraham's interaction with hagga amen this is some of our weaknesses amen put in blame amen right she makes the suggestion now she's made putting blame on the husband and a lot of time we cause things to happen we we we trigger things amen and then we putting the blame on somebody else instead of taking it on our own amen so God is telling us if you do something just ask for forgiveness and move on say you're sorry man make things right man don't don't they be blame shifting amen just like in the Garden of Eden is my husband who make my do it is the Satan who make me do it is this one make me do it no it's your choice own up to it when man you make a make a mistake own up to your your mistake say Lord and ask for forgiveness go to the one who you make mistake who you offended make it right with them and move on and God is more than willing to forgive amen hallelujah and bless you hallelujah thank you Lord before we make suggestions to our husbands we need to think through thoroughly or clearly realizing the influence we have on them come the cost of ahead of time and make only suggestions that will encourage our husband to glorify God in our lives amen so we don't want to might say

perfect will be done in that situation amen hallelujah hallelujah praise God thank you Lord Jesus oh my my my my my my my oh got a lot life lessons here praise God let me get this back up here hallelujah just want to skip off a few things here amen hallelujah we want to see Sarah in the Bible is symbol of the New Covenant think about it and I'm going to just go a little bit into it amen the Apostle Paul refers to Sarah as the free woman and we all came out of bondage amen hallelujah we see haga as the bonds woman in bondage but under the New Covenant God has given us free moral agency we're free amen through salvation man we're free we're not under law we're not under legalism we free Hallelujah in Galatians 4:20 and 28:31 now we Brethren as Isaac was a children of promise but as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him who was born according to the spirit so what Spirit are you born under by you have been born by the spirit of the almighty God Hallelujah on that one Spirit we are all baptized hallelujah we're free not free to run around and do everything we want toen but within the bongs of the Holy Spirit and his leadership and guidance according to his

by some priest calling you but by his holy spirit that call you out to this work amen hallelujah we are the children of Promise as Isaac was and Sarah and Abraham are now counted as our ancestors in the faith they will be counted as parents of many believing Nations and if you are Christ there you are Abraham's seed and as according to the promise amen amen that's in Galatians 3:29 amen hallelujah I'm not going to finish this and by God's grace we're going to continue maybe some other time amen hallelujah praise God and I got quite a little bit more that I want to express to you all that the Lord has shown me and laid upon my heart amen if the musicians would come up I just don't want to just stop ABR but I got to because I going to go into another area amen summarizing the whole
