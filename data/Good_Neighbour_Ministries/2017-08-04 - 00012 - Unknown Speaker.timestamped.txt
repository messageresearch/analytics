[2:25] you do amen church this is not going to
[2:27] be a a group h a group Affair of God
[2:31] dealing with us is an individual Affair
[2:35] that's right yeah I know they have you
[2:36] in groups and we're all part of as a
[2:38] group we're all looking for this great
[2:40] big
[2:41] package we waiting on it we're like hey
[2:44] I need you on my team but I'm saying
[2:46] tonight I need you on my team but I need
[2:49] you issue free
[2:52] amise the Lord hallelujah yes Lord you
[2:55] know we look at the standards of the
[2:57] gospel and people have SI young people
[3:00] have sit in church for
[3:02] years for years playing Church you say
[3:07] brother what do you mean by playing
[3:08] Church never taking the extra mile some
[3:11] of you are in the same place you were in
[3:13] last year when you came to the
[3:15] camp and some of you have gone a step
[3:18] further but where should we be we should
[3:21] be seeing Christ in our
[3:23] lives so we need to deal with the issues
[3:26] and the open doors you know hallah the
[3:29] reason why R sa because God told God
[3:33] anointed David and the Bible says the
[3:36] spirit of God Came Upon David and an
[3:39] evil spirit from the Lord Came Upon
[3:42] Saul and the problem of God say you're
[3:45] either going to be led by the spirit of
[3:47] the Lord or the spirit of the enemy
[3:50] you're either going to be led by good or
[3:52] led by evil and if you haven't been
[3:55] paying attention this world is to a
[3:57] place where God is ready to destroy it
[4:00] again that's right and I wouldn't want
[4:02] to be a lukor believer a message
[4:04] believer who's been in church all their
[4:06] life with no
[4:08] desire with no Holy Ghost Church you
[4:12] need the Holy Ghost because if you don't
[4:14] your house can be swept God is clean but
[4:17] the devil's looking for a door to get
[4:19] back in there and if the strong man
[4:22] which is the holy spirit is not in the
[4:24] front of your house the devil will find
[4:26] a way back in that's right
[4:30] that's the
[4:32] Bible he says he goes into dry
[4:36] places H he's looking for dry places dry
[4:39] places in your life areas where you're
[4:41] not happy mind battles or insecurities
[4:45] all these things that we carry as young
[4:48] people why cuz we have
[4:52] issues what it says the spirit of the
[4:54] Lord leaves and an evil spirit from God
[4:58] comes why because Saul was disobedient
[5:02] it was something he was supposed to do
[5:04] and he didn't do it a lot of times we
[5:07] find ourselves in a certain condition
[5:09] because it was something we did or
[5:12] something we didn't
[5:14] do
[5:16] amen and you know from there God told
[5:19] him God told Saul I want you to go down
[5:22] to the Amit and Destroy Everything kill
[5:26] everybody kill man kill woman baby
[5:30] suckling ox and Beast ass kill Le and sa
[5:33] said praise the Lord hey that's very
[5:36] easy and then you know what his problem
[5:38] was he had issues he couldn't listen so
[5:42] you know what because he was anointed he
[5:44] thought hey I can just do whatever and
[5:46] God will accept it God needs more than
[5:48] just your singing God needs more than
[5:50] just your your instruments God needs
[5:52] more than just your attendance God wants
[5:54] your
[5:56] life God wants all of you amen amen not
[6:00] some of you God will never to anything
[6:03] not Facebook not Instagram none of it
[6:06] God wants the
[6:09] preeminence Hallelujah and you know
[6:11] Church Saul goes down and this is how we
[6:15] do Saul goes down and he begins to wipe
[6:18] out everything that was
[6:21] ugly that's easy for us to do we'll Wipe
[6:24] Out the things we know we're not
[6:26] supposed to do we'll Wipe Out the things
[6:28] that may embarrass us but our little
[6:30] secrets we'll hold on to it the things
[6:34] we think nobody else knows about we'll
[6:35] hold on to it those little relationships
[6:38] that are very ungodly we hold on to it
[6:40] because we think nobody else knows you
[6:42] know what that is that's an Open
[6:46] Door that's an open door for the devil
[6:49] and sa he goes down there he begins to
[6:51] wreck up the he he took this he
[6:54] destroyed this he destroyed that but in
[6:56] the midst of him destroying things he
[6:58] saw some music
[7:00] he saw some nice o some fat cats and he
[7:04] said you know what I'll saved us for God
[7:07] that wasn't the
[7:08] Commandment God told him destroy
[7:11] everything and that's what's hard for us
[7:13] the things we like we hold on
[7:17] to and that's no more than an open door
[7:20] for the
[7:22] devil you have to close those doors
[7:25] whether you like it or
[7:28] not that's what makes is hard there are
[7:31] some things that you still desire there
[7:34] are some things that you don't want to
[7:35] give up yet and you know what that is
[7:37] that's a tool for the
[7:39] enemy because if God has put it there H
[7:43] God has put it on your heart God is s
[7:45] for the word for you to destroy destroy
[7:49] it amen but he holds on to it you know
[7:54] he he he shav some oxin some sheep and
[7:57] different things and he even Spar the
[7:59] king
[8:01] a go back and read it 1 Samuel
[8:05] 15 and he didn't destroy everything and
[8:08] now God calls Samuel he says Saul has
[8:12] disobeyed and I'm rejecting you
[8:16] this I'm no longer using him anymore my
[8:18] spirit is going to leave why because
[8:20] there was something he didn't do now you
[8:23] think about it in your Christian Journey
[8:25] how many times has God tried to get
[8:27] something out of you and you didn't do
[8:29] it
[8:31] because of your
[8:33] issues because of the perception of your
[8:36] PE or the perception of how other people
[8:38] may look at you who cares God is the one
[8:41] calling you to do
[8:43] it so he doesn't do it and then God
[8:46] rejects him and and and you know the
[8:49] worst thing you can do is fool yourself
[8:52] like you're okay right come on now
[8:55] that's right the problem God say the
[8:56] worst kind of Christian that is is a
[8:58] person who got just enough religion to
[9:00] make themselves sick right amen and you
[9:04] know there's people in church who really
[9:06] don't want to be in church there's
[9:08] people hallah going with the floow and
[9:10] doing things spiritually that really
[9:13] don't want to do it their heart is not
[9:15] in
[9:15] it that's the worst kind of person to be
[9:19] somebody who's just in a popularity
[9:25] contest but Saul opened the door for an
[9:29] evil spirit when he didn't do what God
[9:32] told him to do and from there Saul watch
[9:37] the anointing of God leave him and fall
[9:40] on
[9:40] David and from there he opened the door
[9:44] of
[9:45] jealousy and you look in the Bible how
[9:47] Saul for no reason he just wanted to
[9:48] kill David for no reason David hallah
[9:52] destroyed Goliath and all these things
[9:54] and jealousy Rises up in Saul why
[9:56] because Saul opened the door of
[9:58] disobedience that's right and once he
[10:01] open that door he begin to have an issue
[10:04] with those who were doing
[10:06] good and we find out that happens among
[10:09] us all the time Hallelujah jealousy
[10:11] comes in because someone one of your
[10:14] peers they really love God and because
[10:16] you have issues jealousy arises right
[10:20] and we begin to look at one another
[10:23] different which
[10:25] causes major issues in the church that's
[10:28] right
[10:30] the prophet says that's going to be up
[10:32] to you so you confess your sins before
[10:35] you come to the platform and say Lord
[10:38] everything everything in in your life
[10:41] you you you straighten it up now before
[10:43] you come
[10:45] for be it assured to you that the thing
[10:49] will hang right over you as long as you
[10:52] got unconfessed
[10:54] sins hallu let me tell you something if
[10:57] you got things in your life you think
[10:59] you going to take to your grave I'll
[11:01] tell you know you at right that's true
[11:05] it will come out sooner or later H
[11:09] because you can't hide anything from God
[11:11] and let me say this in God's presence
[11:14] there will not be any
[11:16] sin so your sins will be exposed that's
[11:20] right so God will deal with it sin will
[11:23] not lay his presence as they covering
[11:25] God always deals with the sins of the
[11:27] sinner amen so anything you think is
[11:30] unconfessed and you going to take it to
[11:32] your grave no you
[11:35] won't remember the woman who committed
[11:37] adultery on her husband and she was
[11:39] thinking hey I'm going to keep this my
[11:41] husband's in the military then she
[11:42] started dying and she didn't know why
[11:44] she was
[11:45] dying she goes to the prophet and she
[11:48] she she she she oh brother I'm dying I
[11:51] went to the psychiatrist and all these
[11:52] things I don't know what's going on she
[11:54] had unconfessed sins in her
[11:57] life and I wonder how many of you got
[12:00] things in your life that's buried that
[12:02] Mama don't know about that Daddy don't
[12:04] know about that the pastor don't know
[12:06] about but God
[12:09] knows nobody's getting away nobody
[12:12] escape the Judgment of God God can be
[12:15] Hallelujah the best sa in the world or
[12:17] he can be the most terrible judge that's
[12:20] right on no I'm not trying to scare you
[12:22] I'm trying to close these
[12:26] doors that we may deal with our issues
[12:29] and we wonder why church sometimes feel
[12:31] so
[12:32] stagnated because of your
[12:35] issues you know before I I I really got
[12:38] sealed in church it had to when I come
[12:40] to church it had to be
[12:43] fast it had to be all my flesh
[12:52] [Music]
[12:59] something that would stimulate My Flesh
[13:01] because there was no real purpose inside
[13:05] you know it was all about the flesh but
[13:07] when I got converted really converted
[13:09] then my life became a
[13:12] worship Hallelujah I can be in church
[13:15] and hear certain songs about the blood
[13:17] of Jesus and it'll make me lift my hands
[13:19] why because there's a change inside all
[13:22] my issues have been given over to him
[13:25] and I'm no longer in control we love
[13:28] control that's
[13:30] good that's
[13:32] right we've gotten to a place to where
[13:34] the
[13:35] preachers have preached the fire of God
[13:38] right out the
[13:40] church tell you young people don't get
[13:42] caught in Emotion you heard
[13:46] that don't get CAU in Emotion you know H
[13:49] emotion is this and emotion is that and
[13:51] the prophet said without emotion you
[13:53] what dead oh you know
[13:57] that no emotion means that your religion
[14:01] is dead he said if you if you out of
[14:04] church or service that know emotion he
[14:07] said you need to bury it because it's
[14:09] dead amen and we'll try to have a
[14:11] service or a life with God that's
[14:14] motionless that's sness that has no kind
[14:17] of activity in it at
[14:19] all that's not our God right those are
[14:23] our
[14:27] issues listen
[14:30] he he says unconfessed sins your
[14:33] unconfessed sins come he said oh maybe
[14:35] things in your life that you should have
[14:38] done that you did not do maybe something
[14:41] you did Hallelujah something that you
[14:44] ought to do and have not done but even
[14:48] those things confessing Hallelujah make
[14:51] it right now don't get it twisted
[14:54] tonight I'm not saying bring all your
[14:57] sins to me no bring it to to
[15:00] God Amen I'm not here to say tell me
[15:03] your business no tell it to God Amen I'm
[15:07] not your savior I'm just an agent
[15:10] Hallelujah hallah I'm your agent I'm
[15:13] here to put the devil on
[15:16] blast because he's been in our churches
[15:19] and he's been hiding too long Satan
[15:22] loves to hide you know most you know I
[15:25] was in South Africa amen I was preaching
[15:27] not this time a couple years ago I was
[15:29] preaching I was preaching on the the The
[15:31] Great I Am and you know before I got
[15:33] there in the service uh the choir came
[15:36] up to sing and it was it was a very
[15:38] anointed this young lady came to deep
[15:40] the chir it was just so powerful and
[15:42] everything and everybody was worshiping
[15:44] and all this and that then the word
[15:46] started comeing home and that young lady
[15:49] that just LED s that was so anointed
[15:51] went into a demonic
[15:57] manifestation being used
[15:59] and then being
[16:03] used because she had open doors in her
[16:07] life that the singing couldn't show but
[16:11] the spirit of God could bring it out
[16:14] don't let Satan embarrass you because
[16:17] you're holding on to things that you
[16:19] know are not right because it will
[16:22] that's his whole job he wants to
[16:24] embarrass you that's right amen he wants

[19:02] what's moate that
[19:05] c and issu that's right an open door you
[19:09] don't realize that there scen in your
[19:11] life doors that you open that allows the
[19:14] devil to step right in y that's right
[19:17] and once he get in he's wild he's not
[19:21] going to play nice when he gets in he
[19:23] wants to tear up the house he wants you
[19:26] to remember that you let him in that's
[19:29] right he wants you to carry him for a
[19:32] long time even when he gets kicked out
[19:34] of the house that's right that's
[19:40] right
[19:43] listen Saul disobeys God God rejects him
[19:47] and he tries to cover it up he says what
[19:49] I did I I did what you told me to do he
[19:52] saved everything that was nice and
[19:53] beautiful and then he tried to blame it
[19:55] on the people it was the people the
[19:57] people did we good at we're good at
[19:59] blaming everybody
[20:00] else you look at your mom young girl

[20:44] Ghost right
[20:48] Hallelujah let's dig into it a little
[20:51] bit
[20:52] Church listen the prophet of God
[20:57] says he says now we
[21:00] realize that it was reason common
[21:03] reasonings that started the ball of sin
[21:06] rolling at the first place it was
[21:09] reasoning what reasoning against the
[21:11] word of God and a lot of times that's
[21:14] how doors open because we reason against
[21:18] the word of God what is reasoning
[21:20] reasoning basically says to God I have a
[21:24] better
[21:26] way that's the reason he does reason he
[21:29] tries to find another way around to get
[21:31] to a certain place there's no way around
[21:34] the word of
[21:35] God and let me challenge you some of you
[21:39] gave so much out there you've got in
[21:41] here and you're tired right come
[21:47] on you did it
[21:52] all you did it all you gave you gave
[21:55] your
[21:56] best you probably would have jumped in
[21:58] the water every time if you good you
[22:00] gave everything and now you get here and
[22:03] the devil's trying to put you to
[22:06] sleep Devil's trying to make it this

[25:10] doors how does doors get open I'm going
[25:13] read you a story of a young lady but
[25:15] before I get there you see
[25:18] this the Bible says G not the Holy
[25:23] Spirit it says it's your sealed to the
[25:26] day of the Redemption amenes
[25:29] 4:3 a seal you know what a seal is this
[25:33] a
[25:36] Seal Seal right can I get amen has the
[25:40] top one seal with this seal I can turn
[25:44] this upside down and nothing comes out
[25:46] why the seal is keeping it I can stra it
[25:50] around nothing comes out the seal is
[25:52] keeping it I can take it and toss it on
[25:54] the floor nothing comes out why because
[25:57] of the
[25:58] seal it's the seal that's keeping it
[26:01] church and once the Holy Ghost becomes
[26:04] the seal in your life it will keep you
[26:07] even if you're turned upside down even
[26:09] if you're tossed about even you're
[26:11] slapped upside down by the seal will
[26:13] keep
[26:15] you
[26:19] Hall

[26:54] it's built to last
[27:00] when God seals you the devil becomes
[27:05] powerless amen cuz nothing comes out and
[27:09] nothing comes in because of the seal and
[27:13] the only way call anything can come out
[27:16] and anything can go in and if the seal
[27:18] is broken that's right and there's not a
[27:20] demon in Hell strong enough to break the
[27:22] SE
[27:30] he can't the Holy
[27:32] Ghost Church the problem of God say for
[27:35] the enemy to get past the seal that

[29:21] easy because
[29:23] then all of my
[29:25] weight became God's weight M all my
[29:29] struggle became God's struggle you know
[29:32] I'm telling many that when I had cancer
[29:34] in my
[29:35] brain that when I talked to the doctors
[29:39] and they were like you be aess you take
[29:42] chemotherapy and all stuff whatever the
[29:44] word of God
[29:46] came Isaiah 53 God's
[29:49] p and the greatest thing my mom ever did
[29:52] for me she said I'm not going to make
[29:54] the decision whether you take the keyo
[29:55] radiation to
[29:57] me she said because I'm not going to
[29:59] have to live with it you are she said so
[30:01] you take it I got you back you don't
[30:04] take it I got you back but you going to
[30:06] have to make a decision and what was
[30:07] happening there she allowed God to open
[30:10] the door of faith for me
[30:13] amen because it was going to be my words
[30:17] H that God was going to act on not her
[30:19] words not her prayer my words and that's
[30:22] where you have to go you have to go from
[30:24] Mama and Daddy's conviction to your own
[30:26] conviction
[30:29] mhm yeah it's fine it's fine you know
[30:32] pleasing mom pleasing dad but when they
[30:35] around when you go to worship like Cain
[30:37] and Abel what's going to come out that's
[30:41] right it was all fine as long as they
[30:43] were going with with with with Adam and
[30:45] Eve but this particular day they went by
[30:48] themselves and now the true revelation
[30:51] of what they had inside had to come out
[30:54] hallah and that day Hallelujah Abel
[30:56] Hallelujah was in inspired by God and
[30:59] that day came was inspired by his father
[31:03] nobody knew who he was until that
[31:06] day because he was in he was under the
[31:09] umbrella of the household of God but
[31:12] this particular time when his true
[31:15] Revelation came out that door swung wide
[31:17] open everything came out which was a
[31:20] devil
[31:23] right listen the prophet tells a story
[31:26] about a young lady who grew GRE up in
[31:28] church and it starts like this he says
[31:30] he says you know as a little boy or girl
[31:33] a child one thing has happened that we
[31:36] can point back and say from that time
[31:39] such and such a thing we did such and
[31:41] such a thing taking place and from that
[31:43] time it was thus and thus or maybe the
[31:46] immoral woman could could say something
[31:49] like this or or I was virtuous woman I
[31:52] was raised in a strict Christian Home by
[31:54] a Godly father and mother and I was just
[31:56] as p as a l until one night I took a
[31:59] ride with a certain boy and we drove up
[32:03] to a dance hall and from that time you
[32:05] always relate back to something
[32:08] something sometime something happen see
[32:12] so what he's saying there's always a
[32:14] time in your life when you can realize
[32:17] when a door
[32:19] open and then from there he goes to tell
[32:22] a story about a young lady he's talking
[32:23] to a young lady he says and she said
[32:26] when I was a young girl brother
[32:28] I was raised in a real Christian home
[32:30] can I get amen most of you raised in
[32:33] what a real Christian
[32:36] home you afraid to say
[32:39] Amen yes we're raised in in in homes
[32:42] where people believe that God is real
[32:45] amen she acknowledging to the prophet
[32:48] that I was raised in a real Christian
[32:51] home and listen it says and I started
[32:55] going with a boy that smoked first first
[32:59] issue first issue she was raised in a
[33:03] real Christian home but she never became
[33:05] a
[33:08] Christian because if she was a Christian
[33:10] she would have never started going with
[33:12] a boy that
[33:14] smoke first Open
[33:18] Door issue the first issue was she never
[33:22] became a Christian she was in a
[33:24] Christian Home raised by Christian
[33:26] parents but she never became a Christian
[33:29] so because she never became a Christian
[33:32] her decisions were never
[33:34] sound so she chose a boy that smoke open
[33:43] door I started going with a boy that
[33:45] smoke and said first thing you know I
[33:48] was
[33:50] smoking she opened the
[33:53] door evil Communications corrupt good
[33:56] matters she says and one night he spiked
[34:00] a coke with
[34:03] whiskey all because she grew up in a
[34:05] Christian home but she never became a
[34:07] Christian so she chose a boy that smoked
[34:10] and this boy got her to smoking then he
[34:13] SP her drink with whiskey and now
[34:15] another door is open now she's drinking
[34:18] alcohol she went from a Christian home
[34:21] to smoking H and now she's
[34:25] drinking and all of this was something
[34:28] that she didn't have
[34:30] plann but it was simply because she
[34:33] never became a Christian although she
[34:35] grew up in a Christian
[34:39] home she had
[34:41] issues listen he said and that she said
[34:45] and that started me drinking she said I
[34:47] started from that to prostitution
[34:50] another open
[34:54] door I got your attention
[34:57] all started with a young girl who per se
[35:01] grew up in the
[35:03] message but the message never grew up in
[35:07] her and then she chose a young
[35:10] boy smoke then she began smoking and
[35:13] then he spiked the drink then she began
[35:15] drinking and then the drinking turned
[35:17] into prostitution door after door after
[35:25] door she said and I said said I
[35:29] live I live in the very guts of all the
[35:33] blackest of hell all that started
[35:36] because she never got the
[35:40] SE even though she was in the
[35:45] message she was in the message I'm not
[35:48] saying you're not in a good

[39:41] amen she says I me it but as soon as I
[39:46] got out with the crowd again it was all
[39:50] over why cuz that Spirit was still
[39:53] there that's what we're dealing with
[39:55] church we're not dealing with relig
[39:58] we're dealing with the two Spirits
[40:00] Christ or Satan and one of those will
[40:04] dominate your
[40:05] life one of those will dominate your
[40:07] habits your being everything about you

[40:45] the kingdom of
[40:46] God what good are you if God can't use
[40:51] you
[40:53] and and I know this is a little to you
[40:56] maybe a little
[41:00] intense hey but sometimes we need
[41:02] intense
[41:03] Services you know we need to stop
[41:05] playing with the devil yeah come on we
[41:08] need to stop playing with our salvation
[41:10] and we need to say see you guys are old
[41:12] enough for me to preach about you I
[41:13] don't have to talk about Power Rangers
[41:15] and all that
[41:19] stuff look we can be straight up and
[41:22] [Music]
[41:23] honest
[41:25] Hallelujah cuz cuz I'll be the first
[41:27] want to admit after God healed me from
[41:29] cancer I still didn't have the
[41:32] seal so it took me probably another 5
[41:35] years to really get converted but all
[41:38] that time I was in church with no
[41:43] desire and you know I you know I can e
[41:46] the devil down I say you know I you know
[41:50] when I get Sav I really want to be saved
[41:51] I don't I don't want to be in the world
[41:53] and in church and in the world you know
[41:55] and all these things I really want to be
[41:57] sa you ever have that conversation with
[41:58] yourself that's right I really want to
[42:01] be saved I I don't want to be in the
[42:03] world and in church anywhere in church
[42:06] Lord I really want to give you my all am
[42:08] you ever had that conversation yes sir
[42:11] it's not too late amen but let's say
[42:15] like this you can't make deals with
[42:18] God right you can't negotiate your
[42:21] salvation with
[42:22] God either you give up or you don't
[42:27] [Music]
[42:29] listen she said I me that as soon as I
[42:32] got with the crowd Hallelujah she said
[42:34] it was all Lord she said then two years
[42:37] she said I did two years in the women's
[42:39] State
[42:42] Penitentiary all that started because
[42:44] she grew up in a Christian home but
[42:47] never became a
[42:54] Christian when you start to down SP sat
[42:58] wants you to hit the bottom
[43:00] hard
[43:02] hard you know and and some of us we've
[43:05] put our relationships before God you
[43:08] know as long as as long as I have him in
[43:10] my life I can serve God because you're
[43:16] my
[43:19] f will mess up that
[43:22] relationship because he wants you amen
[43:26] he will let it go you find yourself
[43:28] arguing and fighting and all these
[43:29] things why because God wants to be
[43:33] first she went from a Christian home to
[43:36] smok it to drinking to prostitution to
[43:41] the GS of Hell to the Catholic Good
[43:45] Shepherd's home and after the good
[43:47] Shepherd's home she ended up in
[43:49] [Music]
[43:51] jail that's a bad
[43:55] place what was going on with her
[43:58] she had issues and open no in her life
[44:02] but all that could resol if she would
[44:05] just became what her home was her home
[44:10] was a Christian environment and she
[44:11] should have became a
[44:14] Christian listen we're going
[44:18] somewhere she said and there I thought
[44:20] truly I was reformed and I come here and
[44:23] join another church and I told the
[44:25] pastor we went down to the alt and talk
[44:27] it over but she said I just can't keep
[44:30] from it she said I started Hallelujah
[44:33] she said it started one night she went
[44:36] to church maybe maybe we've seen people
[44:40] do this leave your church go to another
[44:42] church but they still the same
[44:45] Spirits cuz you're fighting demon
[44:48] powers we don't wrestle against one
[44:50] another it's demon powers people run
[44:53] from this church to that church take
[44:54] their young from this church to that
[44:56] church know your fighting demon powers
[44:59] amen when she gets out of jail she goes
[45:02] to another church her and the pastor go
[45:03] to an altar even though she went to the
[45:05] altar she felt pretty good she said one
[45:08] night it started all over
[45:10] again why because she never got
[45:15] converted she was just being
[45:20] churching boy I can't wait to see some
[45:22] of y'all skits
[45:30] listen and the prophet say I said lady
[45:33] don't you want to be a real lady have a
[45:35] hubby and babies like a real woman was
[45:39] she said oh with all my heart see in her
[45:42] heart she really wanted to be a
[45:47] Christian and no doubt most of all of us
[45:50] in here feel like
[45:52] that we really want to serve God what's
[45:57] stopping us issues in open doors that's
[46:00] right on see one thing I want you to
[46:03] understand Satan doesn't know what's in
[46:06] your heart am
[46:09] right he doesn't know your desire the
[46:13] only one knows that is God right so what
[46:15] Satan does he studies you he watches
[46:19] what you do on the
[46:20] internet he watches the kind of clothes
[46:22] that gets you excited when you're
