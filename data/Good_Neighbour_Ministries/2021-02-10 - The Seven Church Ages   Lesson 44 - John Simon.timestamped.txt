[0:00] [Music]
[0:16] good evening friends
[0:18] it's a pleasure to be here with you
[0:20] again
[0:22] here we are praising god together
[0:27] giving him honor and glory in these
[0:31] dark and trying days
[0:34] but in the midst of the darkness
[0:38] there shines a bright and shining light
[0:42] jesus christ risen from the dead
[0:47] and alive forevermore we are happy that
[0:51] we can be
[0:51] with god's people in his house
[0:55] may the lord jesus christ bless you
[0:58] in a marvelous and wonderful way
[1:02] now our study will be
[1:05] in the seven church ages
[1:08] our subject today is
[1:12] recognized sonship
[1:16] recognized sonship
[1:19] our text is found in galatians
[1:24] chapter 4 reading from verses
[1:27] 4 to 7.
[1:31] but when the fullness of time
[1:35] was come god
[1:39] sent forth his son
[1:42] made of a woman made
[1:45] under the law
[1:48] to redeem them that were
[1:51] under the law that we
[1:54] might receive the adoption
[1:58] of sons
[2:01] and because you are sons
[2:05] god has sent forth the spirit of his son
[2:09] into your hearts crying abba father
[2:14] wherefore thou art no more
[2:18] a servant but a son
[2:23] and if a son then
[2:26] an heir of god through jesus christ
[2:31] amen praise be to his wonderful
[2:34] marvelous name
[2:36] gracious heavenly father we have just
[2:39] read out of your written word
[2:43] and we pray father you will take
[2:45] blessing honor and glory
[2:48] grant to us wisdom understanding
[2:51] inspiration
[2:53] for the giver the speaker and for the
[2:56] hearers
[2:57] may your word go forth in jesus name
[3:04] now our scripture tells us
[3:07] that when the fullness of time was come
[3:12] the fullness of time god sent forth his
[3:16] son
[3:17] made of a woman under the law
[3:21] praise god to redeem them
[3:25] that were under the law
[3:29] now of course friends we see here
[3:32] that his purpose of coming was for the
[3:36] purpose of
[3:37] redemption as i've said before
[3:41] my subject is recognize sonship
[3:46] now in the world in which we live
[3:49] as it was prophesied as in the days of
[3:52] noah
[3:52] marrying giving in marriage so we find
[3:56] that
[3:56] prevalent in our world today where
[4:00] uh children are being produced
[4:04] there might be no mother around or no
[4:07] father around
[4:09] or they don't know who their father is
[4:12] they don't know who their mother is
[4:15] or there may be a father somewhere
[4:20] but that father does not
[4:24] acknowledge or recognize
[4:28] that child that it is his child
[4:32] and therefore the child is unrecognized
[4:37] unacknowledged and this is what we
[4:40] are basically talking about here
[4:44] how that many today go around saying oh
[4:47] i'm a christian
[4:48] uh i'm a i'm a christian i i'm of this
[4:51] church i'm of the other church i belong
[4:54] to
[4:54] so-and-so churching but you see
[4:58] god hasn't recognized that
[5:02] god hasn't acknowledged that
[5:05] as his sonship for the bible says that
[5:08] god acknowledges
[5:10] for god had set forth the spirit of his
[5:14] son
[5:15] into their hearts now they are under a
[5:19] deception a delusion
[5:21] in which they're saying oh we receive
[5:23] the holy spirit
[5:24] they're trying to say they're claiming
[5:26] sonship
[5:27] but that's you claiming god as your
[5:30] father
[5:31] that's you claiming mr so and so that
[5:34] that
[5:34] is my father because i look like him
[5:39] you you you cultivated yourself to
[5:42] dress like a christian act like a
[5:44] christian walk like a christian
[5:46] talk like a christian uh that doesn't
[5:50] make you a christian
[5:52] and in the same way you don't just come
[5:55] up and say
[5:56] oh that god is my father
[6:00] i claim him because he is powerful
[6:03] because he is he's wealthy because he is
[6:07] so good and he blesses me and he's so
[6:09] loving and he's okay that's wonderful
[6:12] those are his qualities
[6:13] regardless but many are making
[6:17] false claims upon him
[6:21] when it is the opposite way around
[6:24] you have not chosen me but i
[6:27] have chosen you and no man
[6:31] comes to the father except by me
[6:35] and no man's comes to me except the
[6:38] father
[6:39] draws him so you see it is god
[6:43] who has to acknowledge you
[6:46] that you are his child praise
[6:50] god and then you have a valid
[6:53] birth certificate that you can
[6:56] hold on to knowing that you have that
[7:00] token you can hold to it praise
[7:03] god knowing who you are
[7:06] certain of who he is praise god
[7:10] and you can lift up your holy hands
[7:12] without wrath
[7:14] and doubting giving glory to your
[7:17] father's name praise god hallelujah
[7:21] but remember we were all in sin
[7:25] we were all misinformed misdirected
[7:30] going off in different directions some
[7:33] into churchianity
[7:35] some into sin pleasures all manner of
[7:38] different
[7:39] uh distractions that the devil will put
[7:44] but in the middle of it all we needed
[7:48] jesus christ to come on the scene
[7:51] with the power of redemption to redeem
[7:55] us and bring us
[7:56] back to god now the word
[7:59] redeem means to buy back
[8:04] in other words it is as if
[8:07] you were in a pawn shop and we were all
[8:11] in the devil's pawn shop oh and he was
[8:15] making good use of us and
[8:18] uh everything else use of us
[8:22] we were in the pawn shop but thank god
[8:26] our real honor jesus christ
[8:31] came and paid the price hallelujah
[8:34] paid the price for us for the bible says
[8:39] we were redeemed not with silver and
[8:42] gold
[8:43] amen but by the precious blood
[8:47] hallelujah of jesus christ amen
[8:51] so we've been redeemed by the blood of
[8:55] the lamb
[8:56] as the son said i've been redeemed how
[8:59] happy i
[8:59] am oh praise god i'm happy and delirious
[9:04] with the joy of god amen for yes
[9:08] we have been bought back we have been
[9:12] redeemed the price
[9:15] for our redemption was paid
[9:20] if the if the devil wanted to
[9:23] put you in jail god has paid your bond
[9:28] god has paid off
[9:31] any debts and you are set free
[9:35] amen and then when he
[9:38] brought you back then he
[9:42] acknowledges you or owns you
[9:46] or starts to make it known to the public
[9:52] there is my son just
[9:55] as it was with jesus when he
[9:58] was baptized in water the voice from
[10:02] heaven said
[10:03] this is my beloved son
[10:06] in whom i'm pleased to dwell in
[10:10] praise god may god say and do the same
[10:14] for you
[10:16] this is my beloved child
[10:19] this is my beloved daughter here is my
[10:23] beloved son
[10:24] in whom i am pleased
[10:28] to dwell in glory be to his name
[10:32] now the coming of the holy
[10:36] spirit to you and to i
[10:40] was not to make us sons and daughters
[10:44] was not to change us from
[10:48] wolves or pigs into sheep
[10:52] but the bible already told us
[10:55] every seed shall bring
[10:59] forth after its kind sheep will bring
[11:02] forth sheep
[11:04] wolves will bring forth wolves pigs will
[11:07] bring forth
[11:08] pigs and so if we
[11:11] our sons and daughters are children of
[11:14] god
[11:15] then we have to come forth from god
[11:19] not from a church a womb
[11:23] the womb of a church oh
[11:26] praise god we come from the very
[11:29] mind of god from before the foundation
[11:33] of the world
[11:34] and we had his life in us
[11:38] you see we already had to be his
[11:41] children
[11:43] i've explained this before you say oh i
[11:46] got saved and
[11:48] now i have eternal life no the word
[11:51] eternal means
[11:52] without the beginning and without
[11:56] an ending and god himself
[12:01] is the only eternal
[12:04] therefore for you or
[12:07] i or anyone to be recognized
[12:11] or acknowledged as a son
[12:15] a daughter of god they had to be
[12:19] eternal in him like you were in your
[12:22] natural father before you even knew
[12:25] and became born we were in god
[12:28] hallelujah before the foundation of the
[12:32] world
[12:35] and here we are now made manifested
[12:40] by god spoken word which is
[12:43] his original seed
[12:47] that he has used to bring you to a worth
[12:52] to bring you on the scene
[12:55] you and i are only now recognizing
[13:00] our eternal quality that was
[13:04] in us all the time
[13:07] but is now being made known to us so
[13:10] that the seed can germinate
[13:12] and we can come into life walk into his
[13:16] life
[13:16] walk into his power walk into him
[13:20] walking and being with us for he said
[13:22] i'll
[13:23] never leave you i'll be with you before
[13:27] i'll be with you to the very end of the
[13:29] age
[13:30] we also know in the scriptures
[13:34] gifts and callings of god are without
[13:37] repentance
[13:39] in other words before you even
[13:43] repented of your sins before you
[13:47] even started to become conscious of god
[13:50] and wanting to know him
[13:54] god was always there with you
[13:58] through your entire life from your
[14:01] birth right true and many of you can
[14:04] look
[14:05] back on your own life and know
[14:08] that except for the hand of god you
[14:11] might not have been here today
[14:14] it's you're here by the grace
[14:17] of almighty god god is the one
[14:21] that brought you all the way like he
[14:23] told jeremiah
[14:25] before you were even in your mother's
[14:27] belly
[14:28] i knew you i called you
[14:32] that's why you're here and that's why
[14:34] many of you are here
[14:36] it's because of the calling of almighty
[14:39] god
[14:39] and the recognition of god
[14:43] to you as his
[14:46] child he acknowledges you as his child
[14:50] by sending forth the spirit
[14:53] of jesus christ to live within your
[14:56] heart amen
[14:58] glory to his name he did
[15:02] not make us sons
[15:05] you we had to be already sons
[15:08] and daughters but now he is placing you
[15:12] positioning you acknowledging you and
[15:15] recognizing you for who you really
[15:18] are not a creature
[15:22] of time but you come from eternity
[15:28] and you're going back to eternity
[15:31] we're just passing through time
[15:36] eternal beings from the very
[15:40] side of god like adam's bride came
[15:44] from his side jesus bride came from his
[15:47] side when the blood flowed out in
[15:49] calvary
[15:50] and now we are showing god's showing
[15:53] that we were actually a part of him
[15:57] but we are now being revealed upon the
[16:00] earth
[16:01] by the holy spirit empowering
[16:05] us placing us positionally
[16:08] of and making known to the world who we
[16:12] are by acts
[16:15] by acts actions
[16:18] of the holy spirit through our lives
[16:22] the world begins to recognize
[16:26] that you are a child of god beloved
[16:31] now are we the sons and daughters of god
[16:34] hallelujah we were not aware of this
[16:38] peop other folk might have told you you
[16:40] were
[16:42] you might have thought you were you
[16:45] might
[16:45] you might have even been saying that you
[16:47] were
[16:48] but now your heavenly father comes
[16:52] places his hands on your head or upon
[16:55] your
[16:55] shoulder and says son daughter
[16:59] you are a child of mine oh i
[17:03] claim you in the name of jesus christ
[17:06] i claim you by the power of the holy
[17:10] spirit and that is what god is doing
[17:13] here today
[17:14] he is marking his own as paul said i am
[17:17] mark i am
[17:18] mark wherever i go wherever you go
[17:21] you're a mock woman
[17:23] wherever you go you're a mock man
[17:25] wherever you go you're a
[17:27] mock young person because the holy
[17:29] spirit
[17:30] is putting his mark or has put his mark
[17:34] upon you and acknowledging you
[17:38] that you are a christian
[17:42] now i'm a simon and i come in my
[17:46] father's name
[17:48] so you know even if my generation goes
[17:51] way back
[17:52] that my great great this name was simon
[17:56] hallelujah and now you come a christian
[18:00] glory to god you can go as far back as
[18:03] you like
[18:04] right back to eternity and you go as
[18:06] being a son
[18:07] or a part of the great jehovah
[18:11] hallelujah i was in my father in a seed
[18:14] form
[18:16] my father is in his father in a seed
[18:18] form
[18:19] in his father in the grandfather great
[18:21] great great
[18:22] way back and you god allowed
[18:26] you to travel through time until you
[18:30] come to
[18:30] this fullness of time when it is needful
[18:34] for you to be expressed and to be made
[18:37] manifested
[18:39] and and born into the world
[18:43] as a natural child is born into the
[18:45] world but now
[18:46] it's yes a spiritual child of god
[18:50] being born into the world and now
[18:54] recognizing who
[18:58] they are glory to his name
[19:02] as long as we were in the world
[19:06] in the flesh we could not be recognized
[19:09] while you were out there in the world
[19:12] while you were jumping around with all
[19:15] manner of behavior
[19:17] not recognizing not having any idea
[19:20] of who you were just knowing something
[19:23] was strange and different about you
[19:25] but you didn't know what it was maybe
[19:28] even some people
[19:29] hinted towards towards you that you
[19:32] strange you're different
[19:33] you're odd you you you know you're an
[19:36] odd person
[19:38] whatever but something told you
[19:41] that there's something in you that made
[19:44] you different
[19:45] but you could not express it
[19:49] but in the fullness of time god by his
[19:53] spirit
[19:54] send forth the word of god to open your
[19:58] eyes of your understanding
[20:00] that you might recognize him that you
[20:03] might recognize
[20:04] where you come from recognize who
[20:06] yourself
[20:07] and that you might lift up your hand and
[20:09] say abba father or
[20:11] my father my father my father glory to
[20:14] god hallelujah
[20:16] amen for this natural being you have a
[20:19] natural father
[20:20] but for the being on the inside of you
[20:23] you got a spiritual father and that's
[20:26] the one i'm talking about
[20:28] when you lift your holy hands and hearts
[20:31] to god
[20:32] and say my father my father i'm
[20:36] coming home to thee oh i'm coming home
[20:39] coming home never more to rome
[20:42] open wide than arms of love
[20:45] i'm coming home praise god may many of
[20:49] you come home to him
[20:51] tonight may the great holy spirit of
[20:55] almighty god by the word of god
[20:58] speak to your heart to your soul and to
[21:01] your spiritual
[21:02] recognition to know who you are
[21:06] and what you were raised up for
[21:09] amen praise the lord that in you
[21:13] is the original life
[21:16] the life of god now being mad manifest
[21:21] in time or in a time being
[21:24] or in a child of god in a
[21:27] body of time that will pass away
[21:30] but the being on the inside is eternal
[21:34] and will live forever he that liveth and
[21:38] believeth in me
[21:40] though he were dead though he would
[21:42] appear that he died
[21:44] yet shall he also live hallelujah
[21:47] lord of god amen real
[21:50] true believers never die
[21:55] their flesh may die
[21:58] but the seed of god the germ
[22:01] the gene of god the god gene
[22:05] in you never dies
[22:08] it be there forever and ever and ever
[22:12] for all eternity amen
[22:16] we were held captive by the devil
[22:19] in all the habits in all the behaviors
[22:24] in all the captivity of sin amen
[22:28] there are two myriad for me to mention
[22:31] if you dimension them catalog them and
[22:34] write a book about sins of lying and
[22:37] stealing
[22:37] and smoking and drinking and womanizing
[22:40] and
[22:41] can't you'll have a great big black book
[22:44] but we are not here to categorize sins
[22:47] we know
[22:47] our own mistakes as individuals
[22:51] we know our own selves and the holy
[22:54] spirit
[22:55] it's between you and the holy spirit to
[22:58] speak to you
[22:59] and to recognize who you are
[23:02] but we are children of god
[23:06] listen because
[23:10] you are sons you see while we were in
[23:13] sin we couldn't even recognize our own
[23:16] selves
[23:17] that we were children of god
[23:20] hallelujah or the world could not hardly
[23:25] recognize that we were children of god
[23:29] because we were giving a false
[23:32] representation
[23:33] of god our father of who he is
[23:38] hallelujah upon whom did the spirit of
[23:41] god fall
[23:43] unto their pentecost sons they were
[23:46] already
[23:46] called by jesus christ they were already
[23:50] sons and then the spirit of god came
[23:54] upon those sons
[23:55] praise god hallelujah a current
[23:59] upon whom did the spirit of god fall
[24:02] they were already sons
[24:05] children of god and then the spirit of
[24:08] god
[24:08] came upon those children the position
[24:12] place to recognize them
[24:16] to the world of who they really
[24:19] are the bible said
[24:24] the spirit came upon all them
[24:27] that heard the word amen
[24:31] heart doesn't mean hearing with your
[24:33] ears
[24:34] because anyone can hear
[24:38] or praise god but he that hat
[24:41] an ear to hear let him hear in other
[24:44] words
[24:45] he that has been given
[24:48] an heir to hear let him hear
[24:51] the disciples came to jesus they said
[24:54] master
[24:55] how is it we understand
[24:58] clearly what you are saying but the
[25:02] pharisees
[25:03] don't seem to understand
[25:06] he says to them for unto you
[25:10] it is given to know or to understand the
[25:14] mysteries of the kingdom of god
[25:18] but unto them it is not given
[25:21] o praise god blessed is the man the
[25:25] woman the
[25:26] young person to whom god gives an ear
[25:30] the air of the heart praise
[25:34] god blind
[25:37] god gives us the sight insight
[25:40] inside sight of the heart to see
[25:45] to understand and recognize his word
[25:48] god gives us the air not the outer ear
[25:52] but the inner ear praise god that we
[25:55] might hear
[25:56] blessed is he that hear it my
[25:59] words that's what he means he that
[26:01] understands my word
[26:03] he that i permit to understand my word
[26:07] for people may read the bible for 100
[26:10] years go to church for 40 years
[26:13] and they don't know anything about what
[26:16] they're hearing
[26:18] they can repeat the words they can
[26:20] memorize the words they can tell you
[26:22] what it says they
[26:23] they can make you look silly by by
[26:26] quoting so many scriptures
[26:27] to you uh you know and you can even
[26:31] um quote the name of jehovah and still
[26:34] be in wickedness
[26:35] right i and claim you're some kind of a
[26:37] witness
[26:38] but really your jehovah's wickedness but
[26:41] you can even know the bible back forth
[26:43] like that but that's not the knowing
[26:46] that he is talking about
[26:49] that just makes you a theologian is
[26:52] talking about the
[26:53] inner knowing the inner
[26:57] understanding and revelation
[27:00] from this word of god that is god his
[27:04] own interpreter and he
[27:07] will make it plain praise god hallelujah
[27:11] who is better someone to explain
[27:15] a book that i wrote to you
[27:18] or would you prefer for me to take my
[27:21] own book
[27:22] and then begin to explain to you what i
[27:25] wrote in my book
[27:27] that is what i'm talking about men have
[27:30] raised themselves up with professions
[27:33] and clerical this and clergy that and
[27:36] all men are named calling themselves
[27:39] cannons so and so when
[27:40] they're not a cannon they're a water
[27:42] pistol oh my
[27:44] lord have mercy think about it
[27:48] and here it is they're they're trying to
[27:50] explain to you
[27:52] what god is telling you in his word and
[27:55] god is saying no
[27:56] i will come and anoint my own people
[28:00] and i will let them know who i am
[28:03] for god is his own interpreter he will
[28:07] make it plain you've got to spend time
[28:09] with the author
[28:10] of the book the writer of the book for
[28:13] the book itself to reveal to you
[28:15] that you might know that you are his own
[28:18] amen what is the real baptism of the
[28:22] holy spirit speaking in towns
[28:24] absolutely not i've spoken in tongues
[28:28] but that's not the
[28:30] evidence of the holy spirit
[28:34] because i've seen people speak in
[28:35] tongues
[28:38] jump in the air run the floor scream
[28:40] holler
[28:41] so-called prophesy and everything else
[28:44] and when i discerned by the spirit of
[28:46] god it's
[28:47] nothing but a devil back there you say
[28:50] oh
[28:51] brother simon you're just no i'm not
[28:53] just talking
[28:54] i rebuked them in the name of jesus
[28:57] christ
[28:58] and had those devils speak back to me
[29:00] and answer
[29:01] and said oh you found me out you know
[29:04] who i
[29:04] am oh yes brother oh you
[29:07] yes there is genuine speaking in towns
[29:11] genuine interpretations genuine
[29:14] anointings of god
[29:16] but brother sister that's not the
[29:19] evidence
[29:20] of the holy spirit those are evidences
[29:23] of his presence
[29:25] but not the evidence of the holy ghost
[29:28] amen the evidence of the holy spirit
[29:32] praise
[29:32] god hallelujah my friends is the spirit
[29:36] of god
[29:37] coming and filling you after you have
[29:40] repented after you have heard the word
[29:43] recognize who you are being baptized in
[29:46] water
[29:47] amen in a real uh
[29:51] and having a real conscience
[29:54] towards god your conscience is no more
[29:57] hardened your conscience is no more
[30:00] rough
[30:01] against god but your heart becomes
[30:04] tender towards him and you want to
[30:08] love him and to serve him and to
[30:11] walk in his way with sincerity with
[30:14] genuineness
[30:15] amen that the holy spirit might use you
[30:19] as his child amen
[30:22] friends i want you to understand
[30:28] one thing about the mystery of god
[30:33] the mystery of one god
[30:36] for we believe in one god
[30:39] that god is not three
[30:44] god is not a trinity
[30:48] he is not three persons
[30:52] god has three offices
[30:58] but he is not three gods let me explain
[31:01] to you
[31:02] god the great holy spirit great spirit
[31:05] was there before the foundation of the
[31:07] world
[31:08] he knew of course man was going to sin
[31:10] genesis 3
[31:12] he tells them he was going to send one
[31:14] who would bruise
[31:15] the serpent's head a promises of
[31:18] redemption
[31:19] are right through the bible
[31:23] then god had to then come in flesh for
[31:25] he was a spirit
[31:27] and his spirit and could not come and
[31:30] die as a spirit for his eternal
[31:34] so he had to take a human body that
[31:37] could die
[31:39] and the world could see that and
[31:41] recognize that
[31:43] and once god created a body
[31:46] in the womb of mary by the spoken word
[31:50] through a messenger or through an angel
[31:54] amen hallelujah then
[31:57] the word was made flesh
[32:01] and the word was god
[32:04] god himself was made flesh
[32:07] and dwelt among us they call this name
[32:10] what
[32:11] emmanuel god
[32:14] with us so emmanuel was here among
[32:17] us and that was god with us
[32:21] now god creating a body for him
[32:25] the great spirit to come and dwell in
[32:28] did not make him two
[32:31] for god the father who had created this
[32:34] body
[32:35] was now living in his son
[32:39] that is why jesus said
[32:42] the father that dwelleth in me he do it
[32:46] the works
[32:48] my father that dwell it in me
[32:52] then he turns around i and my father
[32:57] he never said r2 i and my father are one
[33:03] oh somebody says oh brother simon
[33:07] when you say that he also said when you
[33:10] when you you know he says i my father
[33:13] won that's one in agreement
[33:16] no it was that's not what he was saying
[33:20] when you see me you see the father
[33:24] philip don't you know me don't you
[33:27] recognize who i
[33:28] am because philip didn't understand what
[33:31] i'm telling you now
[33:32] and said lord show us the father
[33:36] and we will worship he says philip i
[33:39] i have been so long with you
[33:42] does thou not know me i
[33:45] and my father are one read your bible
[33:48] again
[33:49] read those scriptures again understand
[33:53] the word of god by
[33:54] revelation and let god speak to your
[33:57] heart
[33:58] and soul to know who he really is
[34:01] for god is not three persons
[34:05] god is one jesus dying on the cross
[34:11] bible says he gave up the ghost why
[34:14] because the spirit in him god's spirit
[34:16] in him
[34:17] was the holy spirit god is a spirit god
[34:21] is the holy spirit
[34:24] no wonder he said john 14. i will not
[34:28] leave your comfort less
[34:30] says i'll be with you to the very end of
[34:32] the age
[34:34] he said i'll send you another comforter
[34:37] doesn't mean another person but he's
[34:39] coming in another form
[34:42] amen and he will teach you and show you
[34:46] things to come hallelujah read that
[34:49] chapter and you'll see he begins saying
[34:52] i
[34:53] i he tells you that he himself
[34:56] is that comfortable praise the lord now
[34:59] i won't go into
[35:00] everything about that right now but i
[35:04] want you to understand
[35:06] that we serve one god not
[35:09] three no trinitarian doctrine
[35:13] which only came into being around
[35:17] 325 a.d
[35:19] and was introduced from paganism
[35:24] of romanism into christianity
[35:28] and adopted by the rest of protestants
[35:33] and then it was proliferated throughout
[35:36] the world
[35:38] but there was never any such a thing
[35:42] in christianity from the time of jesus
[35:47] and paul
[35:48] or way back before that apostles and
[35:52] patriots
[35:53] one god hallelujah so here we are
[35:56] brother sister
[35:58] in this season and time because we are
[36:02] not born by the spirit and then get
[36:04] baptized by the spirit
[36:06] it's one coming of the holy spirit
[36:09] to the you're born and filled you're
[36:12] filled you're born by the holy spirit
[36:15] amen it's one action of the presence of
[36:18] the holy spirit
[36:20] within your heart and life
[36:24] jesus made it clear he and he alone is
[36:28] lord god almighty amen
[36:31] coming into the believer john 14
[36:34] 16 the father will send another
[36:38] comforter

[36:46] verse 18 i will come in you
[36:50] and be with you verse 23
[36:54] we the father and son will come into him
[36:58] hallelujah what is that we he's not
[37:02] talking about two people
[37:03] he's talking about in his office as
[37:06] father as his office as son
[37:10] as office as holy spirit father son and
[37:14] holy ghost
[37:15] has come into you in one person jesus

[37:59] we are not teaching and we do not
[38:02] believe
[38:04] in reincarnation or
[38:08] transmigration of souls
[38:13] because it is not you
[38:17] the person that comes predestinated from
[38:21] god
[38:23] but the germ or
[38:26] seed of god like
[38:30] my father's seed i am a manifestation
[38:34] of his seed
[38:37] god's spoken word is his original
[38:40] seed we are the manifestation
[38:46] of god's spoken word which is his seed
[38:52] and we have come to life by the
[38:54] preaching of that spoken word

[39:00] dramatized by the power of the holy
[39:03] spirit

[39:07] to recognize who you are
[39:09] and who your father is and that's why we
[39:12] are here tonight

[39:16] way back before your mind could even
[39:20] grasp this
[39:21] this thought we were way
[39:24] back into the eternal god
[39:28] who had eternal thoughts
[39:31] and now those thoughts have become
[39:34] tangible
[39:35] and those thoughts have become you
[39:38] and me now manifest on the earth
[39:42] to carry out the divine will of our
[39:44] father
[39:45] glory be to his blessed name hallelujah

[39:53] one of them i'm a thought of god
[39:56] now expressed in time
[40:00] amen glory to god
[40:03] what a wonderful thing to know
[40:07] that if we are the true seed of the
[40:10] living god

[40:15] amen and the spirit of god
[40:19] will baptize you into the waters of the
[40:23] word of
[40:23] god the word of god will flood your mind

[40:34] spirit of god by the word of god
[40:36] hallelujah
[40:38] amen it will fill your empire you
[40:41] and you will receive
[40:44] the word for your day
[40:48] not the word for some other day uh i'll
[40:51] just
[40:52] pass over this quickly the word for
[40:54] luther's day
[40:56] is dead it's like the man of the churn
[40:58] of israel had in the wilderness
[41:00] yesterday's manner is not good today
[41:03] wesley met to this manner
[41:05] was good yesterday and it's true but
[41:08] it's not good for
[41:09] today amen pentecostal mana
[41:12] was good it was good yesterday you used
[41:15] that you eat that yesterday
[41:17] but you see you're in a new day now and
[41:20] it's
[41:20] new angel food from the presence of god
[41:24] it's gold it's manna from the pot after
[41:27] the
[41:28] altar the golden altar the altar
[41:31] of covenant praise god the altar of it
[41:34] is comes fought from the presence of god
[41:37] hallelujah
[41:38] so here we are you're empowered
[41:41] to receive the word for your day
[41:45] and for your age
[41:49] oh how clear the evidence of the holy
[41:51] spirit is
[41:53] the word of god
[41:56] being revealed to you in your day
[42:00] and then you have a correct
[42:03] interpretation
[42:04] and understanding of the word of god
[42:06] only
[42:07] then you can be a real christian to go
[42:11] out and live it because you are
[42:14] beginning to
[42:14] live what you can see from your heart
[42:19] understand with your heart and then you
[42:23] can go out
[42:24] and live it other than that you are just
[42:27] impersonating
[42:29] you are just presuming and you are
[42:32] acting blindly
[42:35] without really having a clear
[42:37] understanding
[42:39] which can only be given to you by god
[42:42] himself
[42:44] giving to you a clear understanding of
[42:46] who
[42:47] he is who you are
[42:50] and what you were raised up for
[42:53] may the lord richly bless you my
[42:55] brothers and sisters
[42:57] of course i can speak more and more and
[43:00] more
[43:00] but this is just enough for now
[43:03] take the word of god listen to it again
[43:07] go into your bible search the scriptures
[43:11] and
[43:12] them you think you have eternal life
[43:16] ask god as james said if a person lacks
[43:20] wisdom
[43:21] let them ask of god who will give
[43:25] it to them liberally as he wills
[43:29] may god bless you as we introduce this
[43:33] this wonderful subject to you
[43:36] the recognition of sons
[43:40] and daughters of god has god recognize
[43:44] you
[43:44] oh you may recognize him and say oh
[43:48] i claim jesus as my savior oh but
[43:51] he needs to recognize you
[43:54] you see many times it's not just who you
[43:57] know
[43:58] it's who chooses to recognize you
[44:02] you may walk into a government office
[44:04] and say oh
[44:05] i know i know the supervised supervisor
[44:09] i know the manager
[44:10] i know the minister but the minister may
[44:12] pass you and not even look at you
[44:14] because
[44:15] he doesn't want to recognize you or he
[44:17] doesn't recognize you
[44:19] but if he wants to recognize you then
[44:21] god
[44:22] will turn his face to you your minister
[44:24] will turn
[44:25] to you and he will turn to you and said
[44:27] oh
[44:28] uh james john uh janet
[44:31] darcus esta uh pam uh
[44:35] claudia how are you
[44:38] how are you there herman how are you and
[44:41] then he'll call your name
[44:43] and everybody else in the building will
[44:46] turn around and see
[44:47] who's he calling oh it's that guy you
[44:50] see right away
[44:51] you're recognized you're positioned
[44:54] you're placed
[44:55] he's raised you up in the eyes of the
[44:57] public that's what god is doing right
[45:00] now
[45:01] by the opening of the word of god may
[45:04] god richly bless you
[45:06] and may the word of god be applied to
[45:08] your heart
[45:09] and to your life until we meet again
