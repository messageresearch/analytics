TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good Sunday morning grins brothers sisters welcome to the house of the moor welcome to this broadcast let us enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto Him and bless His Holy Name let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for this privilege of Prayer and we pray today that the Blessed Holy Spirit will speak to our hearts and Lord Jesus lifter lift us up to a higher plane and make us stronger in the grace of God for we ask it in Jesus name today we want to celebrate motherhood and we want to thank our mothers for their selfless service undying love and their tender care I'd like to share with you a wonderful plan with this time by Ruth Underhill you'll always find her busy as she flits from room to room and hardly can I picture her without a mop or broom she keeps the floors so shiny you could almost see your face and each and every trinket was dusted in its place though constantly kept toiling by the work of each new day she still had time to read to us when we dressed from our play she still had time to tuck us in and to hear or childish prayers the golden memories of mother still hovers everywhere what a beautiful poem by Ruth H Underhill my mother I would also share with you the tribute by Patrick H Adams she was as good as goodness is her axe and all her words were kind and high above all memories I hold the beauty of her mind President Abraham Lincoln said these memorable words all that I am or hope to be I owe to my angel mother George Washington I attribute my success in life so the moral intellectual and physical education which I received from my mother how marvelous and wonderful to hear great men who have made their mark on this in this world's history saying such wonderful things paying such great and remarkable tributes to their darling mother now let us pause and read from the scripture out of the book of exodus chapter 2 verse 9 and Pharaoh's daughter said unto her take this child away and nurse it for me and I will give thee wages and the woman took the child and she nursed it now of course friends that's the story of Moses his mother the story is there in Exodus 2 how pharaoh's daughter went down sister went down to the river and there she saw this baby in the basket rescued it had it rescued then needed to have a wet nurse it just so happened by the providence and grace of God that the very nurse that she hired to take care of the child was Jacob was Moses's own mother chuckle Beth what a wonderful marvelous story and of course she said take care of the child and I will give you wages I believe God was speaking through her at that time to all real mothers everywhere and that's what I'd like to talk about real motherhood real motherhood so here we see this marvelous situation and here we are today celebrating Mother's Day happy Mother's Day to one and all but we know that real motherhood is just not having the ability to have a child because that is not motherhood that only proves a person's womanhood motherhood absolutely is a natural god-given instinct and ability that God placed in a woman and and is enhanced and empowered by the presence of the Holy Spirit in her life to bring up all the attributes that are necessary to express real genuine motherhood well we know in fact God is our mother God is our Father so a real real motherhood expresses a part of the personality of God God looks upon a mother a real mother that's moving in the spirit of real motherhood say take care of this child and when you come to the end of the way I will give you wages now we know real motherhood is not about your body it's not about your beauty nor isn't about your brains it's more about your belief system it's more about your foundational faith and God said take care of this child I've given this child to you take care of it and I will give you wages when I come o blessed be the name of our precious Lord Jesus who will reward real mother's real against those that are false real against those that are untrue to their responsibilities this is what we want to talk about this is what we're talking about here today no we know of course that the spirit and nature of motherhood will even cause a woman who has does not have the ability to conceive or to be child but that nature that real spirit of motherhood and the nature of motherhood will cause that woman to want to adopt a child to be able to project her love and to share her feelings with that child so she looked up the child who's possibly its own blood-related mother does not love that child as much as the one who adopted it so what is motherhood not just the ability to bear a child but it's the spirit of motherhood it's the nature that isn't a person it's the qualities that are within that individual that comes out to bless her immediate family and to bless the world for such a mother even though she has never born her own child can be a better mother many times than the one who actually born the child No thank God I want to take God that he gave me a real mother a mother that was self sacrificial a mother that was forgiving God gave me a mother that was very protective she was providing she was a hardworking person she was a thinking woman a wise woman she was loving and she was kind to this very day her reputation still echoes and resumes in the hearts of many who called me from time to time and everywhere she was called mother Simon and that was because she mothered every and any person that she met she had the spirit of motherhood that blessed many many around the world and her reputation was mother Simon now she's gone to be with the Lord and she I believe is in the presence of God and in heaven at this time but I have faith and trust in God we'll meet again in heaven some sweet day and until then may god rest her gallant and wonderful soul and a great example that she left for her children what a legacy for a woman to leave to be a real mother not to just prove that you're a woman but to carry out the rights responsibilities the wrong the example of motherhood that you can leave an enduring lasting legacy upon your generations to come no oh yes may God bless our darling mothers everywhere real mothers I believe are like thee another gospel there another gospel Matthew Mark Luke and John and mother because she is a living expression of the love of God when you see a real mother that loves her child and expresses the graces the dignity and the love that that that shows motherhood oh you see the love of God who said I will not leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you to the very end of the age oh I thank God for that kind of love that is expressed in real motherhood which is only partial expressing the love of God for the love of God is boundless full and free it's beyond our imagination of what we can even think or what we can imagine within our hearts the love of God that he has sent down to man now the first real mother of course then I would want to speak about is Moses his mother we find that Moses mother was a woman of God she was in an Israelite a believer in one God and from what we can see of Moses his life in the Bible she was his first teacher and she taught him everything she knew about Jehovah about the scriptures that she knew all that she knew he learned it at her knees he was taunted laying upon her bosom he was taunted looking up into her kindly motherly eyes this was not the eyes of a wet nurse or of a servant but the eyes of a mother looking upon her son oh praise be to God may you see and understand what this picture is telling us first of all our mothers are our first teachers before we can talk before we can walk before we can do anything our mothers are our very first teachers after that then maybe your father will teachers and then after that our will be handed to over to the principal or school master and after that we'll gravitate towards our pastor or minister who will teach us of the ways of God and eternity eternal verities of the things of this wonderful book but our mothers are our first teachers and I'm thinking that she must have told her son Moses talked him everything and said Moses we us israelites had a promise given to our father Abraham that after 400 years how he would bring our people out of Egypt and I believe in my heart Moses you are not deliverer or you may be that deliverer my boy I want you to grow up believing that God can use you to be that deliverer oh if any of you know of the song the album called Prince of Egypt there's a song on there that says or ask the question can you be the one are you the one and I believe that's exactly what this is she was placing it in his heart then he was not a loser he was not a slave he was not just a day laborer he was not anything to be in the mud or to be a mud dauber for the rest of his life but for him to recognize that he came from from a people that were anointed of God and she as his mother would believe that he would be that deliverer so I believe that in zaptor under that kind of belief system this woman must have told her son son live according to the Torah live according to the scriptures live holy live keep yourself away from all the the unsavory things of the world and keep yourself clean because I believe son you're the one I believe that you are the one and God will use you what a thing for a mother to say and so there he was my brothers and sisters you do you see the picture of a real mother how she will speak to her children who shall encourage them not to discourage not to destroy not to tear them up mentally call them all kinds of names call them losers call them dumb call them fools call them and constantly berating that child what a real mother will lift up their child inspire them to high Heights greater things and be able to give them the courage and the confidence that they are able to achieve the highest Heights and they're able to do things beyond their own selves and to be a blessing to the entire world she taught him the precepts of the Word of God she told him how to live holy men more men mother's teach their children how to live and that they should live holy O God bless every mother here today that's listening to my voice and may the Holy Spirit place these words within them yes sir she taught him and told him how he must live and what God will do for him if he walked right top-ranked and lived right oh I think any good true and loyal mother that will take the time to pick up her babies or child and talk to it and and and tell them about the good life on the things of God the God life and the things of God certainly my brothers and sisters that is a wonderful picture for us to behold and not to be like some of those mothers who seek their real mothers but they're not real mothers because no real mothers will just take her child and plunk it in front of a TV screen for the entire day to having their impressionable minds to take everything that they're going to be singing in and after a while they will not be able to separate reality from fantasy but a real mother will take their child teach them talk to them and placement em even in them the seeds of hope gives them the strength and the courage to carry on in this dirt and this sinful world now we see so friends that a real mother will love her children with an undying love and try to help them regardless of the conditions they're going through we're living in a tough cold heartless world and they have to face it on in the schools in the streets everywhere they go and so they need our support they need our love they need to know after they have been berated and beaten down mentally spiritually and sometimes even physically that they can come home to the warmth of the love of a darling sweet mother that will accept them that will talk to them regardless of what they have been through over the day or months weeks or months and we'll try to help them in every way and not to give up on your child continue pre pre pre until you bring God's blessing down upon them pray my sister pray and be a real mother that will go into the presence of God and ask for his love his mercy and His grace to protection to rest upon your child on your children in these dark and dismal days in which we are living when your children get deceived by the world but the things that are in this world a real mother would throw them away or as we will say throw them to the dogs just because they have made multiple mistakes but whether that child whether that child of theirs is 5 years old or 50 years old a real mother will want to get with her child sit top with the child maybe put their arms around that child and saying well mother walk I am with you I'll support you I'll do everything I can to help you of course there are situations where the child reject help the child doesn't want it they choose their own path and especially when they come of age or come to a certain time in their life they choose their life's path and there is nothing much you can do about that but you can at least continue to pray for them but let them know that you will not support evil habits you will not support evil actions and evil ways but you love them and love them fully with all your hearts in every way and will never stop loving them yes that's very important to know that a real mother regardless of whether they're right or whether they're wrong she'll try to help them anyhow and pray to God that God's hand of love and mercy will be with them she'll stay with them as long as you can and then my brothers and sisters our prayers annoying to them or going to them will rise up before God into the heavens as a sweet-smelling incense and God I believe our God that we serve will hear and answer prayer now let me talk about another mother real quick and this mother's name is Herodias who was the wife of King Herod back in my two days now she had a daughter and her daughter's name which is a popular and famous name salomi but instead of raising her daughter or her child in the ways of God and teaching her about Jehovah she started teaching her how to dance and dance Neelu dances of the world and of course with her teaching salami rose to be one of the most seductive charming dancers of birthday and her time until King Herod invited her to dance before him and there I believe she danced the dance of the Seven Veils and the dance of this Seven Veils this was just an ancient way of what we will call a modern day striptease and so salami dance before the king and found favor in his lewd and lustful eyes and there he said US ask for whatever you want and I'll give it to you and just to show you how this child was taught because right to the last moment or mother already told her if you can ask you what do you want tell him you want the head of John the Baptist's in other words telling you what the head of that preacher that preacher that's preaching against all manner of sin and iniquity and evil and wrongdoing and preaching against her life's time for she was living in adultery she was living up fast and loose life and she hated their preacher for telling the truth of God it wasn't his truth it was God's truth and he was saying what God said in God's Word and it's so enraged her that she literally please that that hatred that enragement into the heart of her child caused her to dance for this King and then ask for the head of the preacher of that day I don't doubt that even today while I mentioned the word there may be some that may want to ask for my head oh my eye I asked God to help me and to protect me and watch over me but not my literal head but spiritually I'm talking about so here it is friends that we see them that she danced like that and she finally got John the Baptist's head but history records we serve a God that always watches over his servants touch not my anointed do my prophets no harm and the history tells us that over seventy of her generations live the life of prostitutes and Dinah's prostitutes and another set of them live Harr believes that their end came on the gallows there were hum what a legacy to give to your child one mother talked her child the things of this world the other mother talked her child the things of God one became a great deliverer for his people and a conqueror under leader until his name resounds and is immortal to all men and throughout the pages of human history and so the other one what legacy did she leave for influence went out also for influence of lust and seduction went out her hatred for preachers went out from the way she spoke about preachers in front of her children and in his let's nap and we find out we find out let no doubt hard life influence tens of thousands who may be at this time in the pits of hell far from the presence of Almighty God listen the wisdom of God's Word bring up a child in the way that it should go all friends when the child gets older the child will not want to depart from that way bring up your child I know some mothers that were you can't say they were looked upon as the best of mothers but they would at least want to bring their child to church send a child to a sunday-school and then after a while they want to see and hear what the child was doing and maybe adhere to later they find themselves in Church because some problem came up and God was able to solve their problem oh praise be to God I certainly sympathize with all mothers everywhere and the things they go through and I want us to honor our mothers today I want us to honor our grandmothers today many of us may want to honor in an aunt today that might have raised us or helped us or was a bridge for us well make may we honor some older relative of ours let us touch their lives impressed us and showed us the way of life for us to be able to advance and may have even materially helped us in some way or D or the other think of it honor a mother that might have adopted you and your siblings and raised you in the fear of God or at least raised you to be a good person a good citizen somebody that will live a good honest life which can only be crowned by receiving God's Holy Spirit for you must be born again and be baptized in water in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of your sins oh praise God many of us today may have to honor a mother and grandmother a relative's some other person that has already crossed and gone beyond the mail and they're now in the presence of the Living God but fear not he didn't live it and believe it in me though he were dead yet shall he also lived and if you live and believe in him you also will meet them again in the presence of Almighty God so let's them live for God so that you will meet them again in the presence of the Living God oh praise God Oh while you're watching this broadcast I pray within your heart you in your heart you will be gonna say tell mother I'll be there tell my darling mother I'll be there I'll be there in answer to prayer Oh tell my darling mama that I will be there oh praise God let's honor her by living for God living a right life living a change life changed by the power and the presence of God now I want to ask you to bring up your children in the right way and when you do that God's Word says in the book of Proverbs that your children will raise up and call you blessing that you're a blessed woman you're a precious woman you're a darling mother and they will express their love admiration and appreciation for all the wonderful things that you have done and long after you've gone on your name will pass on to your grandchildren and your great great grandchildren of what claim of a mother who you were and what kind of motherhood you represented oh yes that's the real spirit of motherhood the real spirit of motherhood is not to love your mother on this one day and to give her just flowers or a cake or some gift of appreciation and then forget her for the rest of the year or tuck her away in a nursing home and and then you hardly will here again but you should love your mother and honor her and respect her 365 days a year let your love go out to her and visit with her as often as you can share your love for her one time she led you by the hand and walked you across the street or across the hall now it's your turn to lead her by the hand leave her in there with that walker in that walker this is your chance now for you to receive a blessing as the Scriptures have said honour thy father and thy mother that my days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee yes sir all we see men and these merchant Prince's have turned this mother's day in the day of marketing merchandising and money they've turned it into something that is commercialized and a plastic a fake kind of love that lasts for a day and and then it withers and dies is gone with all the flowers but we're talking about a children loving their mothers with that bitter love that will last and mothers loving their children with an undying and unending love annoying that if they both live for God they'll meet again in the eternities made a great holy spirit speak to your heart today and help you to make a turn they could change or the same Lord I want to do better Lord I I want to be that kind of mother I want to express this genuine real god-given motherhood that only you can teach me O Lord so here we are in this of modern-day commercial whipped up frenzy yes sir and the whole thing I've friends let me tell you this whole thing it is a basket case that's headed straight to hell because that's not the genuine thing they'd taken God out of it taken him out of the of the schools take them out of the courts take him up they did Jessie raise them from everywhere make him a joke on the television so that you know children are laughing and the things of God to talk about the Word of God it becomes so boring to them but back to the Bible back to the original faith back to the faith of your fathers and your mothers your grandmother and your grandfather there will be ashamed of some of us they will weep or as we say turning the grave if they see the way you're walking and living today Oh friends come to the Lord God while there is yet time to come yes you can make a turn yes you can make a change you say brother Simon I'm already living a good life wonderful life but except a man be born again he shall in no wise enter the kingdom of heaven I call you to repentance I called you to a place where you will bow your heart in your head and privately personally ask God dear God forgive help me Lord amen my friends this whole thing is headed to destruction and now is your day of escape turn to God while there is yet time to turn to Him come to him now now we know the nations of this world have spurned God's love mercy and His grace and we find out that many mothers allow their children to hang out on the streets at night running the streets hanging out in various corners going and drinking in bars or in hotels and even if they're not of that age they will get someone to get it for them and they're behind some bushes or or they'll find someplace under a bridge of somewhere else and I'm not here to advertise but that's the way that we see it being done and they'll have Bush parties and everything else where every perverted evil thing goes on and they there they are but that's that's not only something I want to speak about that's going on in the world it's going on even a mouse church people mothers who claim their Christian Mother's Christian father's Christian parents and that sort of thing is allowed to go on my friends I want to tell you we are living in the closing days of time oh we are living in this day of desperation and perversion that is here in the world today and we find a lot of mothers don't even know where their children are I believe years ago there was an ad and it ended always ended with these words and now it is midnight do you know where your children are I want to ask that question do you know where your children are do you know what they're doing what what they're doing with their lives would even you know with where they are where is the motherhood where's the love we just bring them into the world and allow them to just run around as they please and wildly and some some some mothers are more fearful of their children than their children having respect for them oh it's shocking it's really shocking the Bliss where we have a pandemic of juvenile delinquency but if juvenile delinquency is brought on first of all by parental delinquency it is the parental delinquency that caused the juvenile delinquency may God help us today that we may be able to pull ourselves out of that by the grace of God and for you to do that mother you will need to take those beer cans or the cans of beer that you have in your refrigerator when your mother or your father you're listening to me you need to pull out those beer cans out of that refrigerator and not pass on that type of example to your child now I'm a preacher so I've got to tell you the truth I've got to tell you the Word of God what you choose to do is entirely up to you but I must speak what the Word of God is saying that we must live clean holy lines before the presence of the Living God be ye holy as I am holy saith the Lord yes sir that's the truth what I'm talking about we need to get all the cards off of the table we need to get all of the dice and the casino light atmosphere out of the house we need to get rid of all this bingo spirit real motherhood goes beyond such things my friends it's time you begin to call your children at the end of the day before you tuck them into bed shailen prayer before they leave in the morning to go to school pray for their safety pray for their protection pray for their wisdom pray that God will open up their understanding if they appear to be a little lag your slaw it's not to berate them but to prey on us God to help your child that is the love of a darling mother that will reach out to help her offspring and be a blessing wherever I believe that is exactly what we need here today many so-called mothers and fathers let their daughter stay out all night long stay out with some cigarette smoking rascal whiskey drinking Brasco up there oh yeah he may be slick well-dressed well maybe even have some money still a rascal and allowed their daughter to be up there all night and come home in the morning half dress Harvard or not and then you as a mother or a father call yourself a Christian oh god help us Lord think about it mothers do you know where your children are parents do you know where your children are I want to thank God for real motherhood I want to thank God for real housewives I want to thank God for real women in whatever capacity position or position that they are in I'm thanking God for both young mothers and older mothers take God than a vestige or a small part a sliver of real motherhood still exists in this world to me and it gives us hope to continue preaching the Word of God declaring the promise of God in this dark name that many may hear and contoured knowledge of Jesus Christ thank God for motherhood in our society today and I want to wish all real mothers happy Mother's Day to all of you may the blessing of God rest upon you richly and now their friends we have come to the end of this broadcast again I say happy Mother's Day I'd like to remind you that on Wednesday at 7:30 I will continue in the series of the seven church ages the next lesson will be called this salutation where we will extract lessons given to us by God from this teaching on the seventh church ages pray for me I'll pray for you then next Sunday we have a a message that we would like to bring to you that I believe will be a real blessing and I'd like to entitle it and I'm looking forward to it it should be called the Living Dead what you'll be here to listen to that broadcast on the Living Dead next Sunday at 11:00 a.m. and while you're doing that
