[12:53] Hallelujah. Let us bow our hearts before
[12:55] the Lord this
[12:57] morning. Father, we are so grateful this
[13:00] morning that we can be
[13:02] here. You have called us here this
[13:05] morning.
[13:07] Lord, we are not here by chance.
[13:10] Father, we are here because the hand of
[13:13] God orchestrated us to be here this
[13:17] morning. Lord, I believe that with all
[13:19] my heart,
[13:20] Father, that nothing to a son and
[13:23] daughter of God is by chance, oh God.
[13:26] Everything happens for a purpose and
[13:28] everything happens for a reason, Father.
[13:31] And we know that all things work
[13:32] together for good to them that love you,
[13:34] Father.
[13:36] And truly, Lord, you woke us up this
[13:37] morning, Father, with a purpose in your
[13:40] heart, Father, to accomplish something
[13:43] within our lives today, Father. Whether
[13:46] we are aware of it or we're not aware of
[13:48] it, Father. That's why we trust in you,
[13:50] Father, this morning. And we come into
[13:52] your house this morning, Lord. Not in
[13:54] just a building, but into your presence,
[13:56] oh God, desiring to hear the voice of
[14:01] God speak to us this morning, Lord.
[14:03] Father, we are on a journey of perfect
[14:06] faith. Father, you're determined in this
[14:08] hour is to bring a bride to
[14:10] manifestation. Father, to all the
[14:13] prophecies that were spoken over her in
[14:16] these last days through a prophet,
[14:17] Father, to bring that word into
[14:20] manifestation. For you said, "My word
[14:22] won't return to me void, but it will
[14:24] accomplish, Lord." And that's why we're
[14:26] gathered here this morning, Lord. My
[14:28] heart is seeking, Father, for that word
[14:30] to open up to me, Lord, for for a
[14:32] greater faith to come in my life,
[14:34] Father. Lord, and we know by hearing the
[14:37] word of God, hearing the spirit of God
[14:39] speak this morning, Lord, my faith will
[14:42] increase this morning, Lord. I will
[14:44] leave out of this building, Father, a
[14:46] different person than I came in. Father,
[14:48] I will leave I will leave changed and
[14:51] transformed, Father, because I believe
[14:53] that's what has been spoken in this
[14:55] hour, Lord. And I believe that you're
[14:56] the same yesterday, today, and forever,
[14:59] oh God. And you cannot change, Lord.
[15:02] This is a gospel that is real to me,
[15:04] Lord. This is a living word of God. And
[15:07] I believe this morning, Lord, there are
[15:09] living epistles read of all men here,
[15:11] Lord God. And we come together. We unite
[15:14] together, Father, to strengthen our
[15:16] faith together, Lord. Lord, there's a
[15:19] there's a gathering this morning of
[15:20] pillars of fire here, Lord. And Lord
[15:23] Jesus, I know the devils, they gather
[15:25] and they streak together and they they
[15:27] strengthen each other, Lord. But
[15:29] tonight, today, Father, we have gathered
[15:31] the pillars of fire to strengthen faith
[15:34] this morning, Lord, that the house might
[15:36] be full of faith, oh God, full of
[15:38] deliverance, Lord, full of healing, full
[15:41] of transformation this morning, oh God.
[15:43] Lord, humble our hearts this morning. If
[15:46] there be any sin, oh God, let it be
[15:49] repented this morning. Lord, let us, we
[15:51] must always, Father, come before your
[15:54] throne with a repented heart, Lord
[15:56] Jesus. Wash and cleanse every sin. Break
[16:00] every chain. Lord, bind every power of
[16:03] Satan, every power of unbelief here this
[16:05] morning. We are in a great battle this
[16:08] morning. Don't think we come to church
[16:10] and Satan is not here that disturb to
[16:13] hinder and distract us even as we are
[16:16] sitting right in the pew from the word
[16:18] of God. Father, there's a great battle
[16:20] going on. But we take faith this
[16:22] morning. Each and every one of us that
[16:24] believe this morning, we join our faith
[16:26] together, Lord, in the name of Jesus
[16:29] Christ. And we bind every power of
[16:31] Satan. We bind the atmospheres of
[16:33] unbelief so that the sons and daughters
[16:36] of God may have the liberty this
[16:38] morning, oh God. You shall tread on
[16:41] serpents. You shall speak to this
[16:43] mountain. Father, in the name of Jesus
[16:46] Christ, let your word come forth this
[16:48] morning. Lord, you place a a message,
[16:52] you place a thought on your servant's
[16:53] heart, Lord. Father, let him have the
[16:56] liberty this morning, oh God, to bring
[16:58] that word of God. Let it land right into
[17:01] the hearts of your people this morning,
[17:03] Lord. May it cause change and
[17:06] transformation. Loose him this morning.
[17:08] Give him utterance, Lord, to speak what
[17:10] you have given into his heart. Lord, let
[17:14] let there not be any hindrance, Lord
[17:16] God. Put a wall of fire and a hedge
[17:18] around him from the fiery darts of the
[17:20] enemy. I know darts will be coming at
[17:22] him, Lord, that try to stop the word of
[17:25] God that you placed in his heart. But
[17:26] Lord God, we pray and we fortify him by
[17:29] the blood of Jesus Christ this morning
[17:31] in the name of Jesus. And we bind every
[17:34] power of Satan so that that word can
[17:36] come to me this morning. I want my
[17:38] portion this morning, Lord. I want my
[17:41] word this morning, oh God. Hallelujah.
[17:44] That's what I live for. That's why I
[17:46] exist for that's why I breathe today,
[17:49] Father, is for to worship you and
[17:52] receive what you have for me today.
[17:54] Lord, bless the songs of Zion. Lord, as
[17:57] they create the atmosphere and the
[17:59] liberty for the word, the most important
[18:02] part to come forth today, Lord, bless
[18:04] and touch each and everyone. Healing is
[18:07] our bread. Deliverance is our bread this
[18:10] morning. Believe it this morning.
[18:12] Without believing and having faith in
[18:14] the spoken word, you cannot have nothing
[18:17] but believe this morning that God is
[18:21] more than able to do what exceedingly
[18:24] abundant what we can even ask for this
[18:26] morning. Is anything too hard for the
[18:29] Lord? No. There will be a bride. There
[18:32] will be a rapture. There will be a
[18:34] translation in this hour. Lord, bless
[18:37] our pastor, his precious wife. continue
[18:40] to strengthen them and and lift them up.
[18:42] Father, we fortify them under the blood
[18:45] of Jesus Christ this morning. Lord, we
[18:47] lift their hands up as Joshua and Caleb
[18:49] lift Moses's hands up and we speak
[18:52] strength, power, refreshing anointing.
[18:55] Lord, that you place the gift to lead
[18:58] and guide your people. Grant these
[19:00] things, Father, in Jesus name we ask.

[37:01] Um yesterday, brother Paul had a
[37:04] wonderful wedding. They did a
[37:07] traditional one and then they did a the
[37:09] one in the church. I think the building
[37:11] is like um story building. It was all
[37:16] over a lot of people. So he was so happy
[37:21] and they thank the church for their
[37:24] prayers. and former pastor Simon also
[37:27] spoke through right there this morning
[37:29] and he sent his his greetings to
[37:31] everyone of you that you have a
[37:33] wonderful time over there. So we waiting
[37:36] we're looking forward for God to bring
[37:38] them back safely. Um without wasting
[37:42] much time and let's pray.
[37:46] Oh our gracious eternal
[37:50] God, you are the great physician, the
[37:54] sympathizing
[37:55] Jesus. Kindly heavenly
[37:58] father, you never lose a
[38:01] battle. You are always on a winning side
[38:06] and you promise you never leave us nor
[38:08] forsake us. Father, your word is eternal
[38:13] and that word cannot fail because you
[38:16] cannot fail and your word will never
[38:18] fail. And you promise that your word do
[38:21] not come out void unless accomplish what
[38:24] it was sent for. So today, may your word
[38:27] come forth and accomplish a purpose for
[38:30] your children's life. Come and speak to
[38:33] us. Forgive me of anything I've done
[38:35] wrong. Take me aside. Help me, Lord. I
[38:38] can be a blessing to your children. It's
[38:40] all about your bride here, Lord. Not
[38:42] about me or anyone. It's about you,
[38:44] Lord. Please come and take full control,
[38:47] binding it on like bless everyone here
[38:50] in Jesus name. Amen. Okay, we have um
[38:54] couple of scriptures, three scriptures,
[38:56] but very short short one of them. You
[38:59] know, I don't speak for so long, so
[39:00] you're going to be home early. Don't
[39:01] worry, I always have a short sermon. Um
[39:06] first s scripture is job 19 verse 25- 26
[39:12] first John 1:2 Jeremiah 29:11
[39:17] um in Job
[39:20] 19:25 for I know that my redeemer liveth
[39:24] and that he shall stand at the latter
[39:26] day upon the
[39:28] earth then shall ye oh I need Job 19
[39:34] verse Job 19 verse
[39:36] 25-2. Job Yeah. 19 verse 25- 26. For I
[39:43] know that my redeemer liveth and that he
[39:46] shall stand at the latter day upon the
[39:48] earth. Verse 20. And though after my
[39:50] skin worms destroyed this body, yet in
[39:54] my flesh shall I see God. And then
[39:57] Jeremiah 29:11.
[40:01] And for I know the thoughts that I think
[40:05] towards you, says the
[40:08] Lord, thoughts of
[40:11] peace, not of evil, to give you an
[40:14] expected end. Proverbs
[40:18] 12-13. Then shall ye call upon me, and
[40:22] you shall go and pray unto me, and I
[40:25] will hearken unto
[40:26] you, and you shall seek me and find me
[40:30] when you shall search for me with all
[40:33] your heart. And then first John, third
[40:37] John, I think third John 1 verse two.
[40:42] Third John 1 vers2 beloved I wish above
[40:45] all things that thou mayest prosper and
[40:49] be in health even as thy soul prosper.
[40:53] Heavenly father bless the reading of
[40:55] your word in Jesus name. Amen. Please be
[40:58] seated.
[41:01] Amen. Amen. So if I'll title this I'll
[41:06] title redemption in three parts like
[41:09] complete total
[41:10] redemption. Redemption is in three
[41:14] parts. It's not only one part. Some
[41:16] people just got want to be satisfied
[41:19] with only one part of redemption.
[41:22] So that one part is not enough. We need
[41:25] all the total redemption. And Jesus
[41:28] Christ died on Calvary. And we are
[41:31] entitled to all that. But some people
[41:34] just settle for one part of it. But we
[41:39] need all three is given to us. And
[41:42] redeem is to be what? Bought back. It's
[41:46] something that you have already or you
[41:48] lost and then you buy back. Amen. Our
[41:51] pastor gave someone former pastor gave
[41:53] an example of a little guy that lost his
[41:56] bicycle or something and later he found
[41:59] in a pong in a pong shop and then he
[42:02] found it. has to work twice and get it
[42:05] and said I I got it twice and because we
[42:08] were in the mind of Christ before the
[42:10] foundations of the world we came here we
[42:13] were just lost because of the amnesia
[42:15] and then he died and shed his blood and
[42:18] bought us back to himself. Amen. So um
[42:22] I'll read this one here in the king's
[42:24] man
[42:26] redeemer. He said paragraph
[42:29] 185 and uh 191 it says a man has done
[42:34] something wrong so he or his master sold
[42:37] him into
[42:39] slavery actually unto
[42:43] death. Paragraph 185, Kingsman Redeemer.
[42:47] And he's in the market. He's a slave.
[42:50] But a man comes along, a wealthy man
[42:54] that's able to do it and finds this man
[42:57] and finds grace in his
[42:59] sight. He redeems him that takes him
[43:02] from the slave
[43:04] market and takes him out to himself.
[43:08] notice. And that slave once redeemed can
[43:12] never be sold in the market again. Yes.
[43:16] Amen. Can never be sold again. He's
[43:19] marked. Hallelujah. And if he was taught
[43:22] enough of one time to be
[43:24] redeemed, no one can never sell him
[43:28] again for a slave. Paragraph one. It
[43:31] says, "Oh, thanks be to God." Amen. that
[43:33] when a man has once come to Christ and
[43:37] been redeemed by the precious blood of
[43:40] Jesus
[43:42] Christ, but the devil can never make you
[43:45] a slave again.
[43:48] You will chose to be a slave, but he
[43:50] cannot make you a slave again because
[43:53] you have been redeemed. Amen. Where am I
[43:56] now? You are secured in the blood of
[43:59] Jesus Christ until the day of your
[44:01] redemption. Amen. You have that eternal
[44:04] security. A slave, look it up in Exodus
[44:08] and find out if that are in the
[44:10] Levitical laws. I mean, if that are in
[44:13] the law, a slave once redeemed can never
[44:16] be sold again for a slave. That's right.
[44:20] Amen. So when you were bought by the
[44:23] blood of Christ, you became a Christian.
[44:27] You can never be a slave again. and live
[44:31] to sin again. It's all your choice.
[44:34] Everything has done already and is
[44:37] finished.
[44:39] Everything like if the Lord Jesus Christ
[44:41] was even to be here right now and he
[44:44] said, "Oh, I'm sick." He cannot even
[44:46] heal you because it's done already on
[44:50] Calvary. It depends on your acceptance.
[44:54] So this morning any situation that you
[44:57] are going through whatever you are
[44:59] facing it's up to you to accept total
[45:03] deliverance or reject it because your
[45:06] depends on your acceptance. No one can
[45:09] help you. My title is redemption in
[45:12] three parts. Amen. So it's up to the
[45:16] individual to accept your salvation,
[45:19] accept your healing, accept whatever you
[45:22] have of this morning because no one can
[45:25] do anything to help you. It's all based
[45:28] on your faith. Amen.
[45:31] And if I'll go
[45:34] back about
[45:37] redemption because of the sin that
[45:41] happened the garden of
[45:44] Eden it cut off because we were in the
[45:47] mind of Christ before the foundations of
[45:49] the world and then we came on this earth
[45:52] through our father Adam and then because
[45:55] of Eve being deceived by the devil that
[45:59] sin was so much that it cut off from the
[46:02] presence of God. And the scripture said
[46:05] the day you partake of that day you die
[46:09] and that deceived the enemy. So when
[46:12] that thing happened no one has been able
[46:14] to live up to thousand years and one day
[46:17] in the sight of God is a thousand years
[46:19] and thousand years like one day. So
[46:21] after that sin nobody was able to live
[46:24] up to thousand years. So they died right
[46:27] there and
[46:29] then the man tried to make put a fake
[46:34] leaf to cover his shame. Which is a
[46:37] religion and religion is covering. We
[46:40] are not religious. We are Christian. The
[46:42] religion out there they are covering
[46:44] themselves religion. And I was saying
[46:46] last Sunday that they have made
[46:48] Christianity so cheap that when you say
[46:50] you are Christian, people don't even
[46:52] recognize the type of Christian that you
[46:54] are. Unless they get closer to you, then
[46:57] they know what you are made up of. Amen.
[47:00] So they try to make that fig leaf
[47:04] religion and God did not accept it. So
[47:07] he killed a blood a lamp and give them
[47:10] the blood to cover their nakedness.
[47:13] Amen. Because the blood was shed before
[47:16] the foundations of the world. And the
[47:19] bra says somewhere that everyone will be
[47:22] a mimic of Christianity. If their name
[47:25] is on the lamb's book of life before the
[47:27] foundations of the world and you your
[47:30] name is the lamb books of life before
[47:32] the foundation of the world that's why
[47:34] you could receive the word for your day
[47:37] and live it if your name was not there
[47:38] you wouldn't have the ability to receive
[47:41] the word for your day amen and in non
[47:44] seed there's nothing to what to quicken
[47:47] amen because you are quickened you are
[47:50] have the seed of god in that's why
[47:52] you've been quickened by the word of god
[47:54] Amen. But there's none seed. There's
[47:56] nothing in them to quicken. And we are
[47:59] we are born and purchased by the blood
[48:02] of Christ Jesus. So when that thing
[48:05] happened, God asked the two children to
[48:09] make a
[48:10] sacrifice. Amen. And
[48:13] uh I came thought that it was an apple
[48:18] fig leaf religion beautiful to present
[48:21] something beautiful that God will
[48:23] accept. But God is not in beauty. God is
[48:27] in character. Amen. He was expecting
[48:31] them to come by the way of redemption.
[48:34] And Abel by
[48:35] revelation
[48:37] was
[48:39] sacrificed an animal, kill a lamb and
[48:42] God accepted the sacrifice and Bible
[48:45] said that ex sacrifice was excellent in
[48:48] the eyes of God. So without revelation
[48:51] you cannot please God and revelation is
[48:54] the basics of our Christianity. as I
[48:57] spoke last week that you may have all
[49:00] the knowledge about the word of God how
[49:03] much you can have but if it's not fully
[49:06] revealed to you you cannot manifest that
[49:09] word of God that's why last week I was
[49:12] talking about David and his brothers and
[49:15] Saul they were all children of God and
[49:20] they have knowledge that God was more
[49:23] than able to deliver them from the hands
[49:26] of moniad. They know God can do it, but
[49:29] because it was not revealed to them,
[49:31] they could not make any step. They go
[49:34] there every day and just watch that
[49:36] golad making um making fun of the sons
[49:42] of God. And because they only have the
[49:45] knowledge part and that knowledge has
[49:48] not been able to put into practice to be
[49:50] manifested. They couldn't confront that
[49:54] uncircumcised Philistine. But one day he
[49:58] did it in the presence of wrong person.
[50:01] David was just a little bitty boy maybe
[50:04] 16. I don't know his age before that.
[50:08] But because
[50:10] Joseph David has been on the back side
[50:13] of the desert with God, being alone with
[50:17] God, having fellowship and having
[50:20] experience with the bear and
[50:24] the and the
[50:27] lion, he was it was revealed to him
[50:32] that this uncircumcised Philistine
[50:35] cannot defeat the army of the living
[50:36] God. Amen. So you are so angry said why
[50:39] will you allow this uncircumcised
[50:41] Philistine to defile the army of the
[50:43] living God. So this morning don't allow
[50:47] any uncircumcised Philistine any devil
[50:49] to take hold of your blessings. You got
[50:52] to go to the enemy's camp and take
[50:53] whatever he stole from you. You have
[50:56] that right. You've been redeemed by the
[50:58] blood of Christ. Been purchased by the
[51:00] blood of Christ. You have power in the
[51:03] name of Jesus to claim everything. You
[51:06] don't have to allow the devil to to
[51:10] block you anymore. He is a block. He has
[51:14] nothing. All that the enemy has is what
[51:16] you gave him. Amen. So this morning, you
[51:20] got to say to yourself, Satan, I'm
[51:22] refusing anything that you taking from
[51:24] me. I'm taking it back. I'm taking my
[51:27] health back. I'm taking my children
[51:29] back. I'm taking everything that God has
[51:31] given back. You have no right. You are
[51:34] circumcised Philistine. I'm a son of the
[51:37] living God. Take your fitting hands from
[51:40] my property. Take your fitting hands
[51:42] from whatever belongs to me. I am a son
[51:44] of the living God. I'm a daughter of the
[51:46] living God. You are filthy hands from my
[51:49] property. Take your hands from my
[51:52] children. Take your hands from my
[51:54] business. That business is of God. And I
[51:58] have what? a partnership with the Lord
[52:00] Jesus Christ by paying my tithe and
[52:03] offering. I'm afraid some Christians are
[52:06] even afraid to pay their tithe because
[52:08] they think they're going to be starved.
[52:10] Amen. But a true Christian, you have to
[52:13] pay your tithe and offering and God will
[52:16] do the rest. Amen. So if anything that
[52:18] you do, you put God first. God is more
[52:22] than able to give you the desires of
[52:24] your life because he's the same
[52:26] yesterday, today, and forever. His word
[52:29] cannot change. He said, "I'm God and I
[52:32] change not." He never change. He's the
[52:35] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[52:37] Whatever he did in the past, he will do
[52:39] it again and again and again and again,
[52:43] provided that you be believed because
[52:45] he's unchangeable God. Amen. And that
[52:48] unchangeable God is your God. And his
[52:51] name is the Lord Jesus Christ. He never
[52:53] lost a battle. He's the same yesterday,
[52:56] today, and forever. Amen. Our God is
[52:59] good. Hallelujah. He will never leave
[53:02] you nor forsake you.
[53:04] Amen. So let's our confidence be in the
[53:07] word of God. 24 hours regardless of what
[53:11] we're going
[53:15] through. So back to the redemption that
[53:18] I'm talking about. I'm only talking
[53:21] about the one with the soul because you
[53:22] are soul, body, and spirit. And then I'm
[53:25] going to bring it back and add it with a
[53:28] total redemption by the end of my
[53:31] my end that what I'm done.
[53:35] So because we were always in the mind of
[53:38] Christ and they were lost and when Abel
[53:42] made that
[53:43] sacrifice, God accepted that blood
[53:46] sacrifice. That was a sacrifice in the
[53:48] Old Testament until Jesus Christ was
[53:50] born. And because that um human blood is
[53:56] higher than animal blood, so those old
[54:00] saints when they go and sacrifice the
[54:04] blood, it doesn't take that desire away
[54:07] from them. The desire was always there
[54:09] to go back and do the same thing over
[54:11] and over and over again. But and uh they
[54:17] were
[54:18] trapped. But the saints like Patriarch,
[54:21] Abraham and Job and the rest, they
[54:24] realized that
[54:26] no, this is not the end of man. They
[54:29] realize that here is not their home.
[54:32] They look for a city to come. They
[54:36] realize that something is missing.
[54:39] So Job one time, I'm going to just read
[54:42] this to make it more simple. Job
[54:45] recognized that it was
[54:48] God. Job recognized
[54:51] that. Job was thinking about this and
[54:56] worried and it came to him so long, so
[55:00] much that if a man
[55:02] dies, can he live again?
[55:05] I see a tree die and he lives again. I
[55:10] see flower dies and he lives
[55:13] again. That was his
[55:16] question. But man lay down. He gave up
[55:19] the ghost. He wasted
[55:22] away. His sons come to mourn. He give up
[55:26] the ghost. He wasted away. His sons come
[55:29] to mourn and he perceive it
[55:32] not. Behold, that thou would hide me in
[55:36] the grave until thy wrath be passed. He
[55:39] couldn't understand why a flower will
[55:42] die and live again. How a leaf will go
[55:46] off a tree down and lay on the ground
[55:49] and come come back again in the spring.
[55:53] He said, "Mine lay down. Where does he
[55:57] go?" I believe God, but what happens to
[56:00] a man? He was wondering. But one
[56:04] day the lightning began to flash.
[56:07] Hallelujah. The thunders began to roll.
[56:11] The spirit come upon the prophet and he
[56:14] saw the coming of a man who could put
[56:16] his hand upon a sinful man and holy God
[56:20] and the bridge away. Then he screamed,
[56:23] "Amen. I know my redeemer liveth. Though
[56:27] the skin worms destroy this body, yet in
[56:30] my flesh I will see God. He recognized
[56:34] what the resurrection was. Amen.
[56:37] Hallelujah. Job recognized that because
[56:40] he saw it in a vision and his life was
[56:43] never became the same because remember
[56:46] before he got into that vision he was
[56:49] being accused by his friends that he was
[56:51] a secret sinner. Yes. You have done
[56:54] something wrong. Right? They push him
[56:57] down. But he know in his heart that he
[57:00] wasn't a a secret sinner. And some of us
[57:04] sometimes people may put false
[57:05] accusation on this. They will laugh at
[57:08] you. They will put scorn on you. They'll
[57:09] put so much on you against you. But once
[57:13] in your heart, you know that you haven't
[57:16] done anything wrong. Let them say what
[57:18] they want to say. God himself will
[57:20] vindicate you. And God vindicated Job by
[57:23] this. And when this thing became so
[57:26] clear and revealed to him, his life was
[57:28] never be the same. So is a true son and
[57:31] daughter of God. When something become
[57:33] so clear and revealed to you, that's it.
[57:36] It's finished. You have overcoming
[57:39] power. That thing is done. Caputo, it
[57:42] has no power over you again. Amen. So
[57:45] death has no power on a true Christian
[57:47] again. The Lord Jesus Christ came and
[57:49] demonstrate to us. Amen. So what am I
[57:54] saying? On
[57:56] Calvary, the Lord Jesus Christ came.
[57:59] Yes. And shed his blood and he defeat
[58:04] hell, grave and death.
[58:08] And when that thing happened, it
[58:11] happened. Devil has no power, control
[58:14] over any one of you. Remember before
[58:18] that event took place a crowd went out
[58:23] that who is worthy to look the book or
[58:26] to open up the book and no one was
[58:29] worthy not even Joseph who we read his
[58:33] life story like talk about perfection
[58:35] close to Jesus Christ none of them no
[58:39] one was worthy even our current prophet
[58:42] seventh angel messenger none of them
[58:45] could open that book. Amen. And Satan
[58:49] was a nearer kings man. But because his
[58:52] hands was dirty, he couldn't touch that
[58:55] book because he know that if he died,
[58:59] he's kaput.
[59:01] He can't come back again. That's his
[59:04] head. So he ran away from he couldn't
[59:07] touch it. Amen. But the Lord himself,
[59:11] God who created heaven and earth, he
[59:14] came down and died and purchased your
[59:17] and gave his blood and purchase your
[59:20] salvation. It's done once and for all.
[59:23] That blood was shed once and for all. We
[59:26] don't have to share it over and over
[59:27] like they were doing in the Old
[59:29] Testament. It was shed once and once and
[59:32] for all. Brian Tony. Amen. Once and for
[59:35] all. That blood was shed. And when that
[59:37] happened was the greatest thing that
[59:40] could ever happen in the man life of a
[59:42] mankind because in the old testament it
[59:46] take only the high priest to go in the
[59:49] presence of the inner of inas once a
[59:51] year and even that one was a death.
[59:54] Amen. But he shed his blood once once
[59:58] for you and me. He's the high priest.
[1:00:00] Amen. He purchased your blood. Oh man.
[1:00:04] So what that the old testament says that
[1:00:07] Abraham all those who do not get into is
[1:00:09] happening to you now you can live in his
[1:00:12] presence every day his presence with
[1:00:16] you David said that I put the all the
[1:00:19] lord always before me in his presence
[1:00:24] that god is always before him amen we
[1:00:26] are living in the pres this thing that
[1:00:29] the old testament said those that we
[1:00:31] look up to
[1:00:33] they couldn't
[1:00:34] But you and
[1:00:36] me, God said it once.
[1:00:40] So he redeemed you. You have been
[1:00:43] purchased by the blood of Christ. And
[1:00:46] whom the son of man has set free is free
[1:00:50] indeed. Amen. You are free.
[1:00:54] Amen. Hallelujah. So don't let the devil
[1:00:57] play with your mind. Hallelujah. Don't
[1:00:59] let a devil tell you any negative news.
[1:01:02] I have good news for you this morning.
[1:01:04] Amen. That your sins are be forgiven.
[1:01:08] Amen. Said that bless the man whom I
[1:01:12] will not impute sins. Amen. Whose
[1:01:14] iniquity is unforgiving? Amen. So it
[1:01:18] doesn't matter what you have done. You
[1:01:20] didn't do it in the first place. Said a
[1:01:23] child of God cannot sin because a seed
[1:01:25] of God dwells in him. How can you sin?
[1:01:29] That seat is a perfect seat. Amen. You
[1:01:32] are sinless bride. Amen. But because you
[1:01:36] are in this flesh and you do all little
[1:01:38] mistakes, the devil just come and just
[1:01:41] oh accuse you and do all kind of things.
[1:01:44] But don't listen to him. He's a is a
[1:01:47] liar from pit of hell. Amen. You have to
[1:01:50] send it back to hell where it came from.
[1:01:53] Our God is good.
[1:01:55] Hallelujah. Praise our wonderful God.
[1:01:59] Amen.
[1:02:05] So when this thing happened someone like
[1:02:09] Peter before this event take place he
[1:02:13] has the knowledge and what the knowledge
[1:02:16] did to him he caught somebody's ear
[1:02:19] because he has been with Jesus for three
[1:02:22] and a half years and he was seeing all
[1:02:24] the miracles and he know he's God and he
[1:02:28] didn't want somebody to what rough
[1:02:31] um his master up like the way we are on
[1:02:34] our pastor's back. You wouldn't allow
[1:02:37] the deans to know we have to be there as
[1:02:39] a policeman to protect the pastor. So
[1:02:42] Peter was doing the same thing. But
[1:02:44] Peter has the knowledge of everything
[1:02:46] and he have seen that. So when the thing
[1:02:49] came said that he has even experience
[1:02:52] than those those man because he's better
[1:02:55] in the sword than them. cut your master
[1:02:57] head off like that and the Lord put it
[1:03:02] back. What am I saying? He has that
[1:03:06] knowledge at that time and uh like some
[1:03:10] people even the message they have seen
[1:03:13] what the prophet has done. They have
[1:03:15] seen what the word has to do and they
[1:03:19] have all the knowledge. But when it
[1:03:21] comes to manifesting it, it become hard
[1:03:25] because you and I cannot manifest it.
[1:03:27] But if there's spirit of Christ in you
[1:03:29] and you are part of him, you
[1:03:32] unconsciously manifest that life of
[1:03:34] Christ because it's not you doing Christ
[1:03:37] in you manifesting it. So it's not by
[1:03:40] power or by might or by anything but by
[1:03:43] my spirit says the lord. You can study
[1:03:45] the word 24 hours 7 to2 24 hours 35
[1:03:51] uh years 35 days a year and have all the
[1:03:54] knowledge that you want. But if that
[1:03:56] seed is not in you to manifest that word
[1:03:59] of god you will just be um I don't know
[1:04:03] what to say. You're going to be just
[1:04:05] have the knowledge and you'll be l
[1:04:07] lacking behind. And I believe is happen
[1:04:09] around the message. Those who are not
[1:04:12] really the true seed of God, they can
[1:04:16] see what the word has to do but they
[1:04:18] cannot live it. They cannot manifest it.
[1:04:21] Some people can can can um cleanly with
[1:04:25] the coat but you look behind the life
[1:04:29] it's like shallow. There's nothing
[1:04:31] there. So that happened to Peter.
[1:04:35] But after the Lord shed his blood and he
[1:04:41] gave up the ghost and the true journey
[1:04:45] Holy Ghost came at the day of Pentecost.
[1:04:48] Peter who ced the person's ear who
[1:04:52] denied the Lord three times
[1:04:55] like when he
[1:04:58] recognized what was happening his life
[1:05:02] was never the same. He wasn't afraid of
[1:05:05] anyone again. That Holy Ghost was so
[1:05:08] much in him that he could go back and
[1:05:10] said this is that which was spoken of
[1:05:14] by in Joel that this this is happening
[1:05:17] is a manifestation of what that prophecy
[1:05:21] was and he manifests that prophecy the
[1:05:24] dot. Amen. And a true Christian, a true
[1:05:28] son or daughter of God will have that
[1:05:31] ability to recognize what God is doing
[1:05:35] in present tense of his ministry. What
[1:05:39] is happening now and he going to live it
[1:05:43] and manifest it unconsciously because
[1:05:46] it's not him doing it. the Christ that
[1:05:49] lives. So because I live, you shall also
[1:05:51] live. And his name is the Lord and
[1:05:54] Savior Jesus Christ. So he will manifest
[1:05:57] that word through you and through me
[1:06:00] because we are part of that word of God.
[1:06:03] Amen. So he was able to what? Manifest
[1:06:06] it. And his life was not the same. Amen.
[1:06:09] And in Acts
[1:06:11] 4:12, they said that they recognized
[1:06:15] that him and John were ignorant on
[1:06:19] learned, but they recognize that they
[1:06:21] have been with what? The Lord Jesus
[1:06:23] Christ. So is you and me. Amen. People
[1:06:28] have to see that you have been with
[1:06:30] Jesus. Your life has to manifest Christ.
[1:06:34] If you are at part of his attribute,
[1:06:36] it's
[1:06:37] unconsciously unconscious godliness. A
[1:06:40] sheep is a sheep because he bears wool.
[1:06:43] Wool. You
[1:06:45] cannot put a wool on a pig and turn him
[1:06:48] from a pig to become a wool. It all
[1:06:51] based on a seed. If you are part of him,
[1:06:54] you are part of him.
[1:06:56] Simple. You can't fight it. And
[1:06:58] salvations of the Lord. Nobody can put
[1:07:01] anybody's name in. Nobody can take
[1:07:03] anybody's name out. He alone controls
[1:07:06] that. He didn't let in the hands of any
[1:07:09] man. He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:07:12] forever. And when that becomes so clear
[1:07:14] to you, it puts you into rest. Thank
[1:07:18] you, Jesus. You are resting on him. And
[1:07:23] what do you do? You just become a tool
[1:07:26] in the hands of God. Amen. So that
[1:07:28] whenever God wants to use you and he
[1:07:31] needs to use you, he can use you. Amen.
[1:07:34] This is not a race, you just make
[1:07:37] yourself available. And even if you
[1:07:39] chose not to use you and only use one
[1:07:41] time in your entire life, praise be to
[1:07:43] the Lord. Amen. Because our former
[1:07:46] pastor Samuel let us know that some
[1:07:48] people all you read the Bible all their
[1:07:51] life, one thing that they did in the
[1:07:53] Bible and God counts as righteousness.
[1:07:56] Amen. So this is not a race. This is not
[1:07:59] trying to be anything. Just be yourself.
[1:08:03] Be simple and God will bless you. That's
[1:08:06] all God requires. So let's just be
[1:08:08] simple the best simple that we can and
[1:08:11] God will bless us and he going to one
[1:08:14] thing is you have to make yourself
[1:08:18] available.
[1:08:19] So when he needs to use you, he can use
[1:08:22] you. Because if you do not make yourself
[1:08:24] available, then he said somewhere that
[1:08:28] God is able to raise souls to please me.
[1:08:32] So we need God more than he need us. Is
[1:08:35] that right? So we have to make ourself
[1:08:38] available so that when the time come
[1:08:40] that he need that, he can use us. But if
[1:08:43] you become so
[1:08:45] busy for our children for this for that
[1:08:49] you are not you're not fit for the
[1:08:50] kingdom. One time somebody said that
[1:08:52] Lord I'm going to bury my dad and come
[1:08:54] back. He said let the dead bury the
[1:08:56] dead. Amen. So this thing has come to a
[1:09:00] place that it is life and death. Even me
[1:09:04] standing here is life and death. You are
[1:09:07] standing here is between liberty and
[1:09:09] bondage. Amen. Is between uh life and
[1:09:12] death. It's liberty and we have your
[1:09:14] liberty. Everything is in a thin line.
[1:09:18] Yes. It's no time to joke. The truth. We
[1:09:22] got to take this serious.
[1:09:25] That's why he said if God be God
[1:09:27] serving. If Ba be by God save Ba. God
[1:09:31] doesn't want any in between anymore.
[1:09:34] Halfway thing. Those days are gone. He
[1:09:36] said Joshua commission. Amen. Joshua is
[1:09:40] on the land now. Amen. That's the Holy
[1:09:44] Ghost. Now the Joshua Moses, your
[1:09:46] servant Moses is gone. He's dead. He's
[1:09:49] finished his job. Now it's Joshua the
[1:09:51] Holy Ghost. No nonsense.
[1:09:55] When Achan is it Achan in I they stole
[1:10:00] and bring reproach to the gospel, they
[1:10:03] destroy all his family. And sometime you
[1:10:06] may say, "Oh, I'm just a regular church
[1:10:09] member. Nobody needs me." Your life is
[1:10:13] very important.
[1:10:15] Because affect us.
[1:10:17] We are one another's keeper. We are all
[1:10:21] part of one another. So whatever you
[1:10:24] do affect the whole body. So when you
[1:10:28] become a Christian, it's not an
[1:10:31] easy flurry bed of easy.
[1:10:35] There are so many intricates
[1:10:37] involved. So you got to think that what
[1:10:42] am I doing? Is it pleasing
[1:10:44] God? Is it affecting the body? And put
[1:10:48] always the Lord always before you. As
[1:10:51] David said, when you do that, it changes
[1:10:55] situation.
[1:10:57] Amen.
[1:10:58] Hallelujah. Praise God. Thank you,
[1:11:01] Jesus. Amen. Our God is good. Amen.
[1:11:04] Amen. And he hasn't changed. He's the
[1:11:08] same yesterday, today, and forever. So
[1:11:13] what good is a historical good to me, if
[1:11:16] you cannot do what he did in the back
[1:11:18] then, you can look at the life of Peter
[1:11:20] and the rest, and if the same spirit
[1:11:24] that raised up Christ is in you, that
[1:11:27] was in them, is in you, it will do the
[1:11:29] same thing. So you're going to be the
[1:11:31] manifestation of the book of acts again.
[1:11:34] Our life has to be the manifestation
[1:11:37] another book of acts because he's the
[1:11:40] same god. He said I am God and I changed
[1:11:44] not. He never changes.
[1:11:47] Whatever he did in the past, Jack, he's
[1:11:50] doing it in the present. The same
[1:11:52] yesterday, today, and forever. And he's
[1:11:56] on time God. And he will do it again and
[1:11:59] again and again and again because he do
[1:12:02] it for you for the first time. He going
[1:12:03] to do it again for the second time. He's
[1:12:05] not an Indian giver. God will not give
[1:12:07] you something and take it away from you.
[1:12:10] Your salvation is secured. Your eternal
[1:12:12] security once and for all. Don't let
[1:12:15] anybody tells you you are lost. You are
[1:12:18] don't let devil play with your mind. You
[1:12:20] are son or daughter of the living God.
[1:12:23] God will not save you yesterday, 20
[1:12:25] years ago, 30 years ago, 40 years ago,
[1:12:28] and lose you today. No, my God don't do
[1:12:32] such a thing. He's a living God. Amen.
[1:12:36] What he did for you in the past, he do
[1:12:38] it again and over and over again. You
[1:12:40] just can't believe. All things are
[1:12:43] possible to them that believe right now.
[1:12:47] Amen. And what the the devil does, I
[1:12:50] read about one rich man. He was saying
[1:12:55] that if um I know if I can put the words
[1:13:00] correctly, the most successful people,
[1:13:03] they live in the moment. They don't
[1:13:05] always dwell in the past. They don't
[1:13:07] always also dwell in the future. They
[1:13:10] make sure that the moment everything is
[1:13:11] working and also to end up to the
[1:13:13] future. And what the enemy does is that
[1:13:17] he puts some people back. What God did
[1:13:21] in the Luther, they get stuck with it.
[1:13:24] But even Abraham said that if the
[1:13:28] Lutherans and the Pentecost could
[1:13:31] believe what they have that time and
[1:13:34] also accept what God what God was going
[1:13:36] to do in the future in the present tense
[1:13:39] and continue to do, they would have been
[1:13:41] in a better place. Yeah. So even you
[1:13:44] here sitting here to this afternoon,
[1:13:47] what I'm trying to tell you that don't
[1:13:49] let your mind go back on what you're
[1:13:51] going to do from here after church or
[1:13:54] what you going to do tomorrow. Just
[1:13:55] focus because the enemy enemy like to
[1:13:58] what
[1:13:59] distract you are here right now. Oh, I'm
[1:14:02] going to do this tomorrow. I'm going to
[1:14:04] do this. I'm going to do that. Then he's
[1:14:06] what? Like nicking like that and taking
[1:14:08] away from what maybe you have to what
[1:14:11] received. So we have to be in a moment
[1:14:14] and expecting God to take me as I cannot
[1:14:18] do nothing. It's by your faith that will
[1:14:21] draw God to say something to bless and
[1:14:23] help you. So at the moment you have to
[1:14:25] pray and ask God to let God's let me
[1:14:28] speak some that will help you and forget
[1:14:30] about this tomorrow. Tomorrow will take
[1:14:32] care of himself. God will take care of
[1:14:35] you. Don't worry. Just be focused so
[1:14:38] that God can live and flow through you.
[1:14:41] He's a God of the moment. Let's focus on
[1:14:44] the moment. Forget about the past.
[1:14:47] Forget about all the mistakes,
[1:14:49] everything in the past. Past is past.
[1:14:51] You can't bring it back. Let it rest and
[1:14:54] move on.
[1:14:56] Lay all those things aside. Let's move
[1:14:58] on to perfection. The doctrine all put
[1:15:01] everything
[1:15:03] aside and let's move on to the
[1:15:05] perfection because God is unchanging
[1:15:07] God. He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:15:10] forever. So, let's live in a moment
[1:15:13] because remember the children of Israel
[1:15:15] that mana, they couldn't keep it for the
[1:15:18] next day. You got to eat it now. Now,
[1:15:22] it's a present tense. Let's live in a
[1:15:25] moment. You keep that butter for
[1:15:27] tomorrow, is going to perish. Amen. An
[1:15:29] eagle wants a fresh food. They want a
[1:15:33] fresh kale. Fresh kale. That's what an
[1:15:36] eagle eats. Amen. Eagle work needs a
[1:15:38] fresh skill, not a not a contaminated
[1:15:42] one. So we need that fresh skill and to
[1:15:45] get that fresh skill. Bra said that you
[1:15:47] have to if a man could get his
[1:15:48] conscious, subconscious, everything and
[1:15:50] place the word of God there. Nothing can
[1:15:53] come in. Amen. Let that word of God flow
[1:15:57] through you and believe it and accept
[1:15:58] it. You cannot even sin unless you let
[1:16:01] God word down. that listen God is an
[1:16:05] infinite God. He knew from today from
[1:16:09] tomorrow that we're going to be here
[1:16:11] this afternoon. Amen. He knew every
[1:16:13] thought that will pass through our mind.
[1:16:16] We are finite. You don't have the
[1:16:17] ability.
[1:16:19] But him being
[1:16:22] infinite, he put his thing in the word
[1:16:26] in the Bible
[1:16:28] and his word will never fail. No. Your
[1:16:32] word will fail. You make changes. You
[1:16:36] can make decision today, tomorrow you
[1:16:38] change it for a better one. But God
[1:16:40] doesn't change his word. He doesn't
[1:16:42] change his mind about his word. That
[1:16:44] word is truth.
[1:16:47] And it's absolute.
[1:16:50] So our confidence, our everything have
[1:16:53] to be dwell on this word of God because
[1:16:56] this can never fail.
[1:16:59] It will never fail you. To always come
[1:17:01] to pass if you have a right mental
[1:17:06] attitude. It will bring the word of God
[1:17:08] to pass in your time. He's the
[1:17:11] unchanging God. Ah God is wonderful.
[1:17:15] He's a good God. He loves you. He care
[1:17:18] for you. He care for me. Why are you
[1:17:21] worry?
[1:17:22] Don't worry about tomorrow.
[1:17:25] Just leave everything in God's hands.
[1:17:28] when we commit it to
[1:17:30] him said commit all your ways unto God
[1:17:34] and what he will acknowledge him. Is
[1:17:37] that right? So let's commit everything
[1:17:40] to this wise God and he going to bless
[1:17:43] us and help us. He's on time God.
[1:17:48] Hallelujah.
[1:17:50] Praise God. Hallelujah. God is good.
[1:17:54] He never leave us nor forsake us. Amen.
[1:17:58] So what am I saying this afternoon?
[1:18:01] Let's try him. Hallelujah.
[1:18:05] Amen. Thank you Lord. Our God is good.
[1:18:09] Is on time God. Amen. You know whilst
[1:18:13] I'm talking about the word of God. The
[1:18:16] only way you can defeat the enemy is by
[1:18:18] the word of God. And when I read this
[1:18:20] the greatest battle ever fought in
[1:18:22] paragraph 375. He said yes when on Jesus
[1:18:26] Christ on the uh
[1:18:29] um temptation of Jesus Christ he said
[1:18:32] yeah it is written again thou shalt not
[1:18:35] tempt what the Lord thy God. See what he
[1:18:39] call himself the Lord thy God. Thou
[1:18:43] shall not tempt the Lord thy God. It is
[1:18:45] written again like that. What did he do?
[1:18:48] He defeated
[1:18:49] him with the word of God. The title of
[1:18:55] the devil is to get you to what?
[1:18:58] Disbelieve God's word. And the chief
[1:19:00] captain here, he said, "Take God's word
[1:19:03] and do it. In my name, you shall cast
[1:19:07] out devils."
[1:19:09] Amen. We lay your hands on the sick,
[1:19:11] they shall recover.
[1:19:14] That's what the word of God said. Yes.
[1:19:16] If the devil could only get you
[1:19:18] disbelieve one word, he got you. Amen.
[1:19:21] But what am I saying this
[1:19:24] afternoon? Just take away that disbelief
[1:19:28] out and focus on what God can do. Focus
[1:19:33] on his word. What that word can do. Just
[1:19:37] one word. Just focus on it. Don't focus
[1:19:40] on the negative part. Somewhere they
[1:19:43] said it takes more faith even to believe
[1:19:45] than to believe.
[1:19:47] So why are you focusing on the negative
[1:19:50] and the all those things? Focus on the
[1:19:53] right right word and you will dis you
[1:19:57] will what defeat the enemy at any time
[1:20:00] at any point because anything that is
[1:20:04] contrary to the word of God that is your
[1:20:06] enemy.
[1:20:09] So you have to accept that word of God
[1:20:13] no matter how maybe your five senses
[1:20:17] cannot um hold on to it. Don't look at
[1:20:20] your five senses. Some somewhere he said
[1:20:23] that I'm doubting my doubt now I'm
[1:20:26] believing God's word. Let's believe
[1:20:28] God's word. Because the devil t it ties
[1:20:32] is to let you disbelieve God's word. God
[1:20:35] starts for you to believe his word and
[1:20:38] put that word into practice and it will
[1:20:42] come to pass. He's the same yesterday,
[1:20:46] today and forever. Our God never fails.
[1:20:51] Amen. And if he defeated the devil by it
[1:20:54] is written when the enemy comes to you,
[1:20:57] give it back to him. It is written. It
[1:21:00] is written that by his stripes I am
[1:21:01] healed. It is written that above all
[1:21:04] things in which I may prosper and be in
[1:21:07] health even as my soul prosper. It is
[1:21:10] written that by his stripes I am healed.
[1:21:13] Amen. Take the word and kick him out.
[1:21:16] Resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:21:18] you. Amen. Because he's a bully. He's a
[1:21:22] roaring lion. The big liar. They have no
[1:21:25] teeth. But he can just put a fear onto
[1:21:28] you then he can get you. Yeah. But if
[1:21:30] you say, "I'm doubting your doubt,
[1:21:32] Satan." Go somewhere and talk some
[1:21:34] Jehovah witness somewhere. I am a son of
[1:21:36] the living God. Amen. I'm one of God's
[1:21:40] children. I know who I'm believing.
[1:21:42] Amen. I'm one in a million. Amen. I'm
[1:21:46] one in a million. Go get some Jehovah
[1:21:49] Witness somewhere and then put that in
[1:21:52] his thought. Not me. I'm a son of a
[1:21:54] living God. Amen. Amen. God lives in my
[1:21:57] heart. He lives in me. Amen. He will
[1:22:01] never leave you nor forsake you. Amen.
[1:22:05] Praise that wonderful God. Amen. Praise
[1:22:10] God. Um I think I'll
[1:22:13] be wrapping up very soon. Okay. And one
[1:22:18] other thing
[1:22:19] though that I'm going to just stress on
[1:22:23] it a little bit and then
[1:22:26] um one other thing too
[1:22:29] is Job never recognized that it was God.
[1:22:35] As long as the devil can make you
[1:22:37] believe that sometime the little trials
[1:22:40] you go through is God may punishing you.
[1:22:46] It was God trying to show him something.
[1:22:49] Job never recognized it till he saw a
[1:22:52] vision. Like Moses, when he saw the
[1:22:55] vision, the pillar of fire in the bush,
[1:22:57] it was vindicated. So sometimes we go
[1:23:00] through trials and God allow us to go
[1:23:04] through those trials. But as I always
[1:23:06] said that any trials that you go through
[1:23:09] in life first you have to find out if
[1:23:13] it's something that you have done wrong
[1:23:16] then you have to make things
[1:23:18] right and if is the devil trying to push
[1:23:23] you around then you can kick him out.
[1:23:26] And the third one if it's God trying you
[1:23:31] to see your
[1:23:33] reaction. So not everything that comes
[1:23:36] to you that you have done something
[1:23:37] wrong. You may not have done something
[1:23:40] wrong like in Job's case. Yes. But he
[1:23:42] was living so perfect the eyes of God
[1:23:44] that God was showing how good Job is.
[1:23:49] But
[1:23:50] until he catch that vision about my
[1:23:53] redeemer live, he was still doubting and
[1:23:56] thinking that maybe he has done
[1:23:58] something wrong. So unless it is
[1:24:00] revealed to you, you might misinterpret
[1:24:03] it.
[1:24:05] But if you know deep in your heart, you
[1:24:08] haven't done anything wrong and you
[1:24:10] check everything, then stay. God will
[1:24:14] bring you through. Amen. He will bring
[1:24:16] you true. Amen. He's not going to leave
[1:24:18] you there for light. He's going to bring
[1:24:20] you through. He's the same yesterday,
[1:24:23] today, and forever. Amen. Our God is
[1:24:26] awesome God.
[1:24:28] Amen. He hasn't changed. Praise God. Um
[1:24:34] hallelujah. So
[1:24:36] um what I started about the redemption
[1:24:40] in three
[1:24:41] parts.
[1:24:44] God save us. He redeem us. When he
[1:24:48] redeem us, he died on Calvary.
[1:24:50] Everything was in that thing. Amen.
[1:24:53] Everything that we have of is inside us.
[1:24:57] But the devil has played in the mind of
[1:24:59] some people just to take only the
[1:25:04] salvation part and then they're going to
[1:25:06] live poor. They're going to live um
[1:25:10] sick. They're going to do that. But I'm
[1:25:12] here to announce to you this afternoon
[1:25:15] that the scripture said that above all
[1:25:18] things I wish thou may prosper and be in
[1:25:24] health even as your soul prosper. It's
[1:25:28] all three parts.
[1:25:31] All of them. Don't take settle for only
[1:25:35] half one part of redemption. It's three.
[1:25:38] Claim all of them. Yeah. Every promise
[1:25:41] in the book is yours. Every chapter,
[1:25:45] every verse, every line. And you are not
[1:25:50] as you are not doing anything wrong by
[1:25:52] asking God for more because Peter asked
[1:25:55] we have left mother, father, siblings,
[1:26:00] everything and follow you. What are we
[1:26:02] going to get on this earth? Amen. And
[1:26:05] and he said that there's no one that has
[1:26:08] left all those things and followed me
[1:26:11] that will not be blessed in this world.
[1:26:14] He makes it clear the present tense and
[1:26:17] what the world to come. So it's a
[1:26:20] threepart is for you abundance of hell
[1:26:24] somewhere. Abraham said that how can a
[1:26:26] little fish think that oh I'll drink all
[1:26:29] the water and exhaust that water in the
[1:26:32] ocean. You cannot exhaust God's
[1:26:34] goodness.
[1:26:36] His goodness and mercy shall follow you
[1:26:38] all the days of your life. And I'll
[1:26:41] dwell in the presence of God forever.
[1:26:45] Amen. He has made that provision for
[1:26:48] you. Live in his presence and he will
[1:26:51] lead you and he will guide you because
[1:26:53] there's no one who is living in his
[1:26:57] presence that God will not lead you to
[1:26:59] his perfect will for your life. The main
[1:27:02] thing is get him in your life. Seek the
[1:27:05] seek. Oh, seek ye the kingdom of God and
[1:27:09] his righteousness. All other things
[1:27:13] shall be added unto you. Once you
[1:27:15] walking in light with the word of God,
[1:27:17] he will provide everything that you have
[1:27:20] need of. After all, you are here today,
[1:27:22] you gone tomorrow.
[1:27:24] Amen. We don't have much. I came here
[1:27:27] very young and now all my hair is gray
[1:27:29] and everything. What's happening? You're
[1:27:32] dying.
[1:27:34] Yes. Every day that you you breathe in,
[1:27:36] you are dead. You are dead, man. I could
[1:27:38] just go back and remember everything
[1:27:41] happened in the high school and all my
[1:27:43] friends things that we were doing and
[1:27:45] check right now almost 30 years gone
[1:27:46] just like that. 30. What's that? Life is
[1:27:49] short.
[1:27:51] So let's serve God. Amen. Once we have
[1:27:54] our life, once we have an opportunity,
[1:27:58] because none of us know what's going to
[1:28:00] happen even right after we left from
[1:28:02] here. Amen. So if we don't know that and
[1:28:05] then we have to make our hearts right
[1:28:07] and behave like this even our last
[1:28:11] sermon that we're going to hear. Amen.
[1:28:13] Approach God with sincerity.
[1:28:18] And I read Jeremiah
[1:28:21] 29:11
[1:28:32] again.
[1:28:35] Sorry. Yeah. Okay, I got it. Jeremiah
[1:28:40] 29:11. I want to read it
[1:28:44] again. Okay.
[1:28:47] Um, for I
[1:28:50] know the thoughts that I think towards
[1:28:53] you,
[1:28:54] said the
[1:28:56] Lord. Thoughts of what? Peace and not of
[1:29:00] evil. To give you what? An expected end.
[1:29:04] That is what? To give you future. To
[1:29:06] bless you. So God's thought for you is
[1:29:11] not an evil one. It's a peaceful
[1:29:15] thought. Amen.
[1:29:17] And somewhere in Philippians he said
[1:29:19] that whatsoever things that are of good
[1:29:22] report whatsoever things that edify if
[1:29:26] there are any virtues think on this.
[1:29:29] Those are the thoughts of God. Amen. And
[1:29:34] he said that I'll do exceedingly and
[1:29:36] abundantly more than what you can even
[1:29:39] think or ask. Hallelujah. Because so God
[1:29:42] loves you. God cares for you. He wants
[1:29:46] to bless you. He wants to make you
[1:29:49] happy. He wants to give you everything.
[1:29:51] It's yours. It is in you already. You
[1:29:55] have to activate it.
[1:29:58] Everything you have need of is in you
[1:30:00] already.
[1:30:02] It's you have to activate it.
[1:30:04] Hallelujah.
[1:30:06] He promised he will give you what? The
[1:30:08] desires of your heart. Amen.
[1:30:13] So why are you worried this
[1:30:16] afternoon? He's on time. God,
[1:30:20] he may not come when you want him to be,
[1:30:23] but he'll be there right on time. Right
[1:30:27] on time. Amen. But sometimes to God
[1:30:31] wants us to be
[1:30:33] desperate. Um verse 12 he said that then
[1:30:38] shall ye call upon me and ye shall go
[1:30:41] and pray unto me and I will hearken unto
[1:30:45] you and then and ye shall seek me and
[1:30:48] find me when you shall search for me
[1:30:51] with all all your heart.
[1:30:55] That's it. So you have to be desperate
[1:30:58] and let God know that we need a thing,
[1:31:01] right? Hannah was desperate when she
[1:31:05] needed a son. In those times, it was
[1:31:09] what a curse not to have a ch children.
[1:31:14] But now is the the table is
[1:31:16] even most don't even have children
[1:31:19] anymore.
[1:31:20] So it was a curse at that time on her
[1:31:24] and she was desperate and God heard a
[1:31:29] desperate cry.
[1:31:31] And God did not only give him a stand,
[1:31:34] he gave him a prophet. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:31:37] So he did exceedingly abundantly more
[1:31:40] than what she has even asked for. He's a
[1:31:43] God of abundance. Amen. Remember Solomon
[1:31:47] asked for wisdom to rule his country.
[1:31:50] Amen. So you have to ask for more
[1:31:52] revelation and God said you have asked
[1:31:54] for the right thing. Amen. So if you
[1:31:56] seeking for more revelation, you ask him
[1:31:59] for the right thing. Ask for wisdom. And
[1:32:01] God not only gave him wisdom, he gave
[1:32:04] him riches. Made him the richest man in
[1:32:07] the whole world. The richest king. Amen.
[1:32:10] So seek for revelation. Seek for him.
[1:32:12] Yes. with all your heart and you shall
[1:32:15] what? Find him. He will give you
[1:32:17] exceedingly abundantly more than what
[1:32:19] you can even think of. Amen. He only
[1:32:22] asks for wisdom.
[1:32:25] But God gave him all the riches.
[1:32:28] And the present tense, ask for more
[1:32:31] revelation if you don't have it. And if
[1:32:33] you have it, ask for more of that. And
[1:32:35] after you are seeking more of him,
[1:32:37] getting more
[1:32:39] revelation, everything will fall in
[1:32:42] place. Amen. Because he is the one
[1:32:45] created heaven and earth. Oh man, I like
[1:32:47] this song. He said that um my redeemer
[1:32:51] liveth. Let me check this verse. Who
[1:32:54] taught the sun where to stand in the
[1:32:56] morning? And who taught the ocean you
[1:32:59] can only come this far? And who show the
[1:33:03] moon where to hide till evening till
[1:33:05] evening? Whose west alone can catch a
[1:33:09] fallen star? I know my redeemer lives.
[1:33:13] And know all creation testify that this
[1:33:16] life within me Christ. I know my
[1:33:18] redeemer living. The very same God that
[1:33:23] spins things in orbit
[1:33:27] runs to the
[1:33:28] weary. And the same and the one and the
[1:33:32] weak, the same gentle hands that hold me
[1:33:35] when I'm broken, they conquer death to
[1:33:38] bring me victory. I know my redeemer
[1:33:41] liveth. He lives to take away my shame.
[1:33:46] Oh my. Do you have any shame? That's
[1:33:48] what the Lord does. He lives forever. I
[1:33:51] will proclaim. Yes. That the payment for
[1:33:55] my sin. Oh man, he bought your your sin
[1:33:59] already. Hallelujah. Was a precious life
[1:34:02] he gave, but now he's alive. And there's
[1:34:06] not an empty grave.
[1:34:09] That tomb is empty. All religion is
[1:34:12] false except through Christianity. You
[1:34:15] find Muhammad all their graves. But this
[1:34:18] road is empty. The grave is empty. Amen.
[1:34:23] Hallelujah. I know my redeemer lives. Oh
[1:34:28] man, I know that he live. Because he
[1:34:30] lives, I can face tomorrow. Oh, he
[1:34:33] lives. I know he lives. I spoke with him
[1:34:36] this morning. He lives. He lives. The
[1:34:39] empty the tomb is empty. He lives. I'm
[1:34:42] going to tell everybody that my God
[1:34:44] lives. Amen. Just like the woman of the
[1:34:46] world, when she heard the word of God,
[1:34:49] when God revealed himself to her, he
[1:34:52] couldn't sit down but to share that word
[1:34:54] of God. Amen. There's no one that has
[1:34:56] been the presence of God that will keep
[1:34:58] the word of God to himself. Isaiah one
[1:35:01] time he was so much dependent on the
[1:35:03] king and some of us have some
[1:35:07] idols even in the message here in this
[1:35:09] message.
[1:35:11] And what God does, he takes all those
[1:35:14] idols from you.
[1:35:16] And sometimes he allows some people that
[1:35:21] you have so much confidence in them to
[1:35:24] do certain things that will let you lose
[1:35:28] hope in a man so that your eyes will be
[1:35:31] single on him.
[1:35:34] Jealous God. Say jealous God. He even
[1:35:38] wants to put so much confidence in the
[1:35:40] prophet that he sent. He get to a place
[1:35:42] the prophet said I must decrease so that
[1:35:45] he must what? Increase. That's the God
[1:35:48] that you are serving. So when Isaiah
[1:35:52] eyes was so much on the king, God has to
[1:35:55] take the king away. Oh man. And when he
[1:35:57] got into that presence of that shana
[1:36:00] glory, he realized that I'm a man of
[1:36:03] unclean lips. I live on among uncle when
[1:36:06] the coal of fire touched that prophet
[1:36:08] took away everything. Then he said that
[1:36:11] what he what I was shared the word of
[1:36:13] God. Amen. So to this afternoon if God
[1:36:17] has revealed himself to you can't sit
[1:36:20] down everywhere you go your life will
[1:36:24] leave a testimony more than your words.
[1:36:27] Amen. Because you representing the Lord
[1:36:29] Jesus Christ. You don't need to talk too
[1:36:32] much. Let your life live that testimony
[1:36:35] because the life behind the name of the
[1:36:37] demons fear and tremble. Amen. Then
[1:36:40] share the word too. Amen. Because it's
[1:36:43] dying people. People are dying left and
[1:36:48] right
[1:36:49] spiritually and spiritual death is more
[1:36:52] than the natural death.
[1:36:55] Spiritual
[1:36:57] blindness is more than the natural one.
[1:37:00] That's why the Bible somewhere the Lord
[1:37:02] Jesus Christ said that I would rather go
[1:37:04] to heaven with one eye than to lose have
[1:37:08] all my eyes and lose it. I rather go
[1:37:12] with only one leg than to have all my
[1:37:15] being and lose it. So it's a spiritual
[1:37:18] blindness the most worst thing. Amen.
[1:37:22] We are privileged by the grace of God to
[1:37:26] have revelation.
[1:37:28] And the God that lives in
[1:37:31] you is
[1:37:34] also relying on you to bring others in.
[1:37:39] It's just
[1:37:40] like Ruth and Boas. It was was glean in
[1:37:46] time. Amen. It's a glean in time. We all
[1:37:49] know that. It's not like before when we
[1:37:51] came the message you can get people left
[1:37:54] and right like that. It's gleaning. But
[1:37:56] let's glean for the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:37:59] Amen. Because when Ruth was gleaning, it
[1:38:02] was a reproach at that time. But she
[1:38:06] didn't
[1:38:07] care. She was obedient to whatever Naomi
[1:38:10] tells her. So is you and me. Let us be
[1:38:14] what? Obedient to every word of God.
[1:38:18] Because the total obedience to the
[1:38:20] entire word of God entitles you to the
[1:38:23] token. You must have the token. You must
[1:38:27] be born again. You must have the Holy
[1:38:30] Ghost. There is no what do you call it?
[1:38:35] There is no h corner cut or in between.
[1:38:39] You must have the mind of Christ. Amen.
[1:38:42] It's is something that is so vital.
[1:38:47] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:38:50] So what am I saying? That less labor for
[1:38:56] the master because um the harvest is the
[1:39:00] the harvest is plenty but the labor is
[1:39:05] few. So let's work till the master what
[1:39:09] cometh. He's the same yesterday, today
[1:39:13] and forever. So that's what I have for
[1:39:15] this afternoon and I'll call the
[1:39:17] musicians to come.
[1:39:19] [Applause]
[1:39:52] Amen. Praise God. How many enjoyed that
[1:39:55] service? I
[1:39:56] did. Glory to God. What a wonderful time
[1:40:00] for the sons and daughters of God in
[1:40:02] this day and in this hour to be
[1:40:04] receiving present truth. See, we're not
[1:40:08] feeding on quotes and just reading
[1:40:11] scriptures. We are feeding on the living
[1:40:14] God. And this is the hour where God must
[1:40:17] become a reality to each and every
[1:40:21] individual. Amen. Where you realize that
[1:40:24] you're actually in partnership with the
[1:40:27] Lord himself. That you are his feet. You
[1:40:30] are his lips. You are his hands. You are
[1:40:33] his mercy. You are his voice. Amen.
[1:40:37] Praise God. So, um it's good to be in
[1:40:40] the house of the Lord today. I uh I was
[1:40:43] saying all week I said I'm going to get
[1:40:45] into the house of the Lord this Sunday
[1:40:47] some way somehow. Um it certainly has
[1:40:50] been a different uh season. Um for us
[1:40:54] this year, it's a little bit delayed as
[1:40:57] you can well see from the weather that
[1:41:00] we've been having. It's been cold. It's
[1:41:02] been rainy. And so it's kind of delayed
[1:41:05] things a little bit, but
[1:41:08] um all good. Praise God. We're just
[1:41:11] moving forward. And we're uh uh we're
[1:41:14] we're here doing we're here about the
[1:41:16] father's business. That is our first
[1:41:19] priority. Amen. Being about the father's
[1:41:22] business. So um next Sunday, I was going
[1:41:26] to be back, but um I will not be back
[1:41:28] next Sunday. You may see me in the house
[1:41:30] of the Lord. Okay? I don't know. But um
[1:41:34] next Sunday, we're going to have brother
[1:41:35] Tim who will be ministering the word of
[1:41:37] God. Uh this Wednesday, I believe
[1:41:40] Brother Desmond will be ministering the
[1:41:42] word of God. Amen. And so I'll be back a
[1:41:46] week Sunday. Keep uh you know, keep me
[1:41:48] in prayer. It's been it's been a very
[1:41:51] busy season, okay, for me. It always is
[1:41:55] regardless of uh you know whatever the
[1:41:58] conditions, the weather and everything
[1:41:59] else because of my um you know my
[1:42:02] position in the in the uh in the
[1:42:04] company. So I I really uh appreciate
[1:42:07] your prayers and I covet them um to get
[1:42:09] us through these next couple of weeks.
[1:42:12] We were able sister Jennifer and I were
[1:42:14] able to visit with brother Kofi and
[1:42:16] Sister Mary um at the hospital this
[1:42:19] week. We had a wonderful time of
[1:42:21] fellowship. I can tell you that he is
[1:42:24] definitely on the road to recovery. He's
[1:42:28] in physiootherapy now. Um, you know,
[1:42:31] having gone through what he did, you
[1:42:33] know, he he basically died
[1:42:36] twice at home and then when he was in
[1:42:39] the hospital. And so they had to revive
[1:42:42] him, bring him back. So all of his
[1:42:44] organs and everything, you know, things
[1:42:47] take time to restart. you know, God's
[1:42:51] God's way of uh you know, showing
[1:42:54] himself and vindicating his will and his
[1:42:56] purpose in each and every one of our
[1:42:58] lives. We don't understand, but God
[1:43:01] knows and we know nobody leaves without
[1:43:05] his final approval.
[1:43:08] Even when the doctors are looking and
[1:43:10] saying there's no pulse, it's only when
[1:43:13] God gives his final approval. Amen. And
[1:43:16] so he's on the road to recovery. He
[1:43:19] says, "Thank you everybody." He says, "I
[1:43:22] love you all. I appreciate I know that
[1:43:25] you've all been praying for me." He's uh
[1:43:27] very grateful that um he's got such a a
[1:43:31] supportive family in the ministry here,
[1:43:34] knowing that um you know when when
[1:43:37] something when one of us is down, the
[1:43:39] rest of us are there in prayer. Uh when
[1:43:42] when we rejoice, we rejoice together.
[1:43:44] Amen. when we weep, we weep together.
[1:43:48] And so, God bless you all for uh being
[1:43:51] there and supporting him and his family
[1:43:54] in prayer. I know he would have loved to
[1:43:56] have been in Africa there at Paul's
[1:43:59] wedding yesterday and and Florence, I
[1:44:01] believe her name is. Yes. Um who who
[1:44:04] were married
[1:44:05] yesterday. So, um you all received the
[1:44:09] link. I did watch I haven't watched at
[1:44:11] all but um I did catch uh some good
[1:44:14] parts. I saw a lot of nice pictures. So
[1:44:17] we wish them the best. May the Lord
[1:44:19] richly bless them and prosper them and
[1:44:22] give them uh faith for a life together
[1:44:25] in the word of God. Amen. Praise God.
