TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] praise the lord praise the lord i'm so happy to be here again praising and glorifying his mighty and wonderful name welcome there's a welcome here for one and all welcome to this time of worship of teaching and of feasting upon the word of god may the lord bless you as you open up your hearts and as you open up your appetite for the word of god for this hour may the great holy spirit rest upon you bless you expand your thinking expand your believing and grow you in the faith in which you are planted may god to god be the glory as we read our scriptures for today and begin upon this part of our teaching our scripture is found in the book of revelation chapter 2 and verse 9 i know thy works and tribulation and poverty but the word rich and i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are of the synagogue of satan this is our topic for today synagogues of satan let us pray our gracious god our most righteous heavenly father rained down upon us the blessings of the great holy spirit send to us angels food manna from on high break the shoe bread before us lord and show us the word reveal to us the things we need to know the strategies of satan his activities lord that we may be able to avoid or protect ourselves in these perilous and dangerous times to thee be all the glory and the praise as you infuse us with your spirit that we may speak as man of god anointed for your glory and honor we ask it in the name of jesus christ our lord amen and amen well as you know my dear friends brothers and sisters in christ last week we spoke on this fact that in this scripture god says i know and last week we showed that no matter what trouble trial tribulation or problems the believers in the smyrna church age were going through it was a comforting word of god to them that no matter what you may suffer from my name for my word for my testimony i know oh how precious that is to a believer to know that our lord knows that he is saying he cares and he is showing that he watches over his own but not only does our god know about our trial our tribulation our tests and our faithfulness which he will reward but he is also acutely aware of the blasphemy the unbelief of those who say they are jews and are not now we realize that irenaeus was the messenger to this mernian church age himself and the believers that were in this age were confronted by a great problem and that problem was the subversion of the pure faith of god by counterfeit christians a counterfeit church and counterfeit or false preachers with the word of god i'm i believe and i'm aware and i want you to be aware that we are confronted with the same problem in our day and my aim is to help you to distinguish or differentiate between the counterfeit and the real or true now here we find god saying i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are of the synagogue of satan now the word synagogue means place of meeting or meeting place the greek means place of assembly or assemblage now praise god hallelujah now let's engage in this study in god's word to find this answer how we might be able to by the word of god distinguish or differentiate between these two classes good and evil counterfeit and real true and false or praise be to god so many so-called christians everywhere so many that say today that they're christians and they are not but instead they are possessed by satan or synagogues of satan know you not that your body you are the temple of the holy ghost who dwells in you or praise god on the other side it's the opposite by by by taking in unbelief by taking in false doctrine by feeding on vulture food people become synagogues of satan knowingly or unknowingly they become possessed by him led by him controlled by him manipulated by him to do and carry out his evil works and his satanic will may god help us today once we look into the word of god to show this differentiation god said i know your works you're not hidden from me you're hidden from maybe the people on the earth that can't see behind the scenes but i know i know what you're doing i know all your activities that you're carrying out and the blasphemy of that activity of you for you are going around telling a lie saying you are a jew or you're a christian when you are not but you are a tool of satan a part of that synagogue of satan that meeting place that uniting of those uh satanic influences you are part of that great movement of that system in other words you're a hypocrite in other words you are a uh a book that has on the wrong cover the cover says christian but when your the book is opened up and a discerning reader looks at it and begins to read from it he realizes that outwardly it has the sign or title of christian but inwardly it's foul it's evil it's satanic and so my friends they recognize what is hidden underneath that cover and satan does use the term i'm a christian in many people who claim to be christians millions who claim to be christians he uses that as a cover to hide and camouflage his activities his strategies his attacks against the true believer that rest their faith upon this word of the living god now to begin with the word jew does not describe the religion of the jewish people it really only refers to the people of that were of judah of the tribe of judah oh my think about it friends they were making a claim that they were jews because they were born in let's say israel you know they say oh i'm a jew i was born in israel being born in israel or being in israel doesn't make you a jew being in the jewish homeland does not automatically make you a jew even if you were born there it doesn't make you into a jew oh my i tell you friends hallelujah not even joining the jewish religion doesn't really make you a jew you had to be jewish from your genes amen and then you go on to display it by your faith but here it is my friends you find that being born in china doesn't make you chinese you can be a caucasian or an african that was born in china it does not make you chinese to your core you maybe call yourself chinese by nationality but by race you are not chinese you are caucasian you're african or whatever else you are oh my god it's the same as if a pig was born in a manger he may try to act like a lamb talk like a lamb move like a lamb but it doesn't turn him or transform him or make him into a lamb he'll still want to eat his slop and filth and evil but go but while going ahead and claiming that he is a lamb yet he has the nature of a pig feeding on the foul and evil things of this world and of the pig pen of which he is really from and made for oh my think about it hallelujah amen praise god hallelujah or thank god our parentages from above our parentage or our parent is not of this earth remember we were not born on this earth this that or the other in uh this church that church i'm of this army that or the other but we are born from above born by the blood of christ our dna our genealogy is of jesus christ our lord who died for us hallelujah and we were in his the loins of his mind from before the foundations of the world and now made manifest in this age and in this hour that we may display his great uh characteristics display his personality make known his testimony and re let them come back to a remembrance of his great name that you are christ's son you are christ's child you are christ's daughter you have the resemblance you have the characteristics you have the nature you act like him you talk like him you walk like him he is in you and flowing through you and those who are outside recognize you are of that family because you have the family uh uh characteristics and traits and you can't help it it's what you are oh my you are not of those who just say they are christians but are not oh but you are though you are of that group who were made christians who were made the children of god from before the foundation of the world the seed of god was laid the foundation stone was laid in you before the foundation of the world and the seed of god was in you from before the foundation hallelujah praise god hallelujah here you were before the foundation now you are here after the foundation still a son still a daughter still a child of the king we came from him and we're going back to him by the grace of god oh hallelujah praise god forevermore i'm glad that i can say and believe in my heart i am one of them aren't you one do you believe you're one praise god give him the glory give him the honor and thank god that he included you and that he placed you in that group which he says my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow hallelujah amen think of it satan trying to deceive true believers by using people who claimed to be a part of the true church to try to deceive them but thank god for the pro our lord's promised that every name not written in that book of life that will be deceived except the elected will not be deceived and even they would be elected amen would be deceived if not for the fact that they were elected by god before the foundation and cannot be deceived for the seed of god dwells in them and the seed of god does not commit sin does not commit unbelief and not be deceived oh my god i don't say momentarily they may not be thrown off this way or that way but in the or in the in this true sense of the word and the final analysis they cannot will not be deceived hey thanks be the god hallelujah amen praise god these ones that were deceived blinded and taken away by carried away by satan into mystery babylon my friends they are really and truly of the false mind they're carried away they're not the true church but they are of the false church for god says you are of this synagogue of satan oh my god help us now we know synagogue is not the same word as church for synagogue means the meeting place or a meeting place but the word church means called out once the word church means the ones that were summoned the ones that were invited oh praise god only those whom the father has invited can come only those who were brought in by his voice into the mystery into the revelation of himself only those can come the others may make claims they may make wonderful claims but those claims are without foundations they are bottomless and unrecognized in the presence of god but the true seed of god are the invited ones that were invited to receive the the revelation the message the the revelation of the message of this day and of this hour or whatever age or hour or time that they were placed in in the book of psalms we read blessed is the man thou choosest whom thou chooses he chooses and causes to approach unto thee so god does the choosing then god makes the way for the approach into his presence listen that they may dwell in thy courts hallelujah glory to god so the man the woman the person whom god has chosen and then decides who in which age he will call them bring them out separate them and then cause them to draw nigh or to approach unto himself oh blessed be the name of the lord i believe in this age there are called out people in this age there are people chosen by god and blessed by him through his boundless and endless grace to approach unto him to worship glorify and magnify him with clear understanding knowing who their worship and worshiping with revelation fellowshipping with understanding singing with the understanding praying with the understanding doing all with the understanding by given to them by the holy spirit the blessed teacher of john 14 whom the lord himself spoke about when he has come he will guide you into all truth and show you the things to come thank god he is showing it in this hour thank god he is opening the book not just the pages of the book but revealing and making known the unwritten word of god hallelujah the unspoken word of god it's in the book yet it's not written but it must be revealed and understood by the holy spirit oh blessed be the name of the lord thank god hallelujah amen oh glory to god hallelujah yes sir the word synagogue of course means assembly or gathering or meeting place so we gather in the fellowship or the revelation of this fellowship of the mystery of god being made clear and plain as it was prophesied in the word of god it will come in a day when shall not be day or night but at evening time it shall be light oh glory to god light again oh praise god so we fellowship together synagogue means that they gather together they assemble together but their assembly is not of god their assembly is not to his glory and to his honor because assembling could be good or bad the word synagogue doesn't it has nothing to do with bad for a synagogue or a gathering can be either good or bad a tree of good or of evil or of it or a tree of good and evil so here we are friends as they are assembling assembling not of god but they're assembling under their own wisdom and knowledge assembling of themselves isaiah the prophet spoke behold thou shalt surely gather together but not by me gathering together but not drawn together by the holy spirit brought together by some common uh teaching that they received but not brought together by the blessed holy spirit let me illustrate what i mean peter was taught by the lord jesus christ himself peter caught the revelation on the day of pentecost and it so excited and anointed him and the rest of the believers it made them speak with towns and give glory to god the emphasis not on the speaking of towns but that there received the revelation of who jesus was that is what caused them hallelujah so it's the receiving of the revelation of who jesus is that gives one the holy spirit speaking in tongues is just an offshoot it's just uh uh something that that may come oh praise god i'm glad that some of us have caught the revelation for this day and for this hour oh praise god hallelujah yes sir now we find out that we are gathered like peter was he was drawn by the holy spirit now paul called out chosen to be an apostle by the blessed holy spirit after an experience with the great pillar of fire same one that was with israel in the wilderness now met him on the road to damascus knocked him off of his high horse of humans wisdom and knowledge and pride and arrogance brought him down to bite the dust of shame and humility and to be able to look up and say my lord who art the lord and the voice answered i am jesus and it still will answer you the same who are you lord who are you god and the voice will still answer i am jesus whom thou persecuted paul went into the wilderness and spent five years in the presence of almighty god being taught by the lord himself for you know in first corinthians chapter 11 he said as was delivered to me by the lord himself that on the night he was betrayed and he began to tell what happened in that room where they were eating but he said it was revealed or given to him by the lord himself he had a visitation from above he had a personal private uh you know conference with god visitation of the holy spirit came out to the wilderness began to preach and teach the word of god and when it was found later on peter said paul the things you are teaching my god hallelujah they are so deep that even i have a time with them but what the point i'm trying to make is that peter had not yet met paul but when they did come together peter was teaching the fullness of the truth of the word of god and paul who had never met him was also teaching and preaching the fullness of the word of god and even more than what peter had at the time and it happened not by them going to a theological school not by paul going to a rabbinical school in jerusalem not by going to some monastery that they had set up somewhere but by s being in the presence of god and got him being his own interpreter revealing his word to paul so that when they came together under the fellowship of the revelation of that mystery they were both saying the same thing they were both preaching one god baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ all that you do do it in the name of jesus christ they were both preaching the same doctrines and glorifying the same god jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever glory to his wonderful name hallelujah amen praise god hallelujah yes sir gathering together but not by him one drawn together by the opening and revealing of the word of god and others gathering together drawn by the dead works and the dead teachings of man think of it back then there were already an invasion perpetrated by satan a subversion of the kingdom of god of multitudes of people entering into the framework of the church of the living god calling themselves jews and there were not you see the reason is because there were liars and when one is a liar a liar can make any claim that they wish for a lie has no foundation it has no truth no button to it they say whatever they wish amen they state their lie as if it's a fact then they repeat it over and over and over again and disseminated everywhere and until it begins to be received and repeated and rumored and spread as a fact but even if the multitudes begin to accept it as a fact it does not change its origin that it all began with a original lie and we know that lying is a bottomless pit as i've said there's no foundations to a lie nothing of the sort and shall we read from the book of revelation chapter 21 verse 8 listen to the voice of god listen to the word of god in this hour not my word but god's word liars no foundations they have no they don't have to have a proper reason or proof or evidence of whatever they're saying but once you start to lie you've opened a doorway to the pits of hell you have opened the doorway to the bottomless pit and you are liable to say anything without evidence without proof amen without any proper reason or reasoning and as the word of god says here listen but they're fearful and unbelievable the abominable and murderers and hormones and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burn it with fire and brimstone which is the second death may god have mercy on that lying rotten dirty lying filthy bunch which god says he'll place into the lake of fire because what they state what they claim what they expound or teach has no bottom to it it is a bottom left spit into which you will keep falling and falling on falling and falling and falling endlessly my friends into something that you cannot find any place to stop your falling for their entire foundations is based upon a lie now with this thought in mind this is what caused groups to gather together the pharisees were drawn together in the like manner based on a lie based on lies a profusion of lies baskets and bucketfuls of lies nothing to these liars lying liars here it is and satan is the father of liars jesus said so when he spoke to the pharisees you are of your father the devil for he's a liar from the beginning and the pharisees were drawn together by these by lies the sadducees were drawn together by lies the herodians were drawn together by such lying lies the epicureans the stoics and the libertines all blinded and gathered together attracted to one another by this propensity to lie and to tell lies and if you tell one lie you'll tell too if you tell one lie you open the doorway to the pits of hell think of it the end the early church was almost entirely composed of and made up of jews they were like the original members of the body the twelve apostles themselves were jews the later apostles were either of jews or of proselytes that came to jewish faith thus we find that for people to swear with pride that there were jews would help to give them a claim of prominence and of originality for remember the original apostles were jews so now to say i i'm jew i'm a jew when there were not was blasphemy but there satan was now covering his tracks in intertwining himself as a vine into the framework of the true church by claiming originality and telling this lie and telling it over and over again until that lie begins to stick oh my he doesn't care about the facts he doesn't care about the real fact of history a liar ignores facts a liar ignores history a liar ignores reality and just lies lies lies lies lies a bottomless pit of lies that originates from their father who is the devil and the father of lies in other words they are operating and moving on the satanic influence power and inspiration rather than the holy spirit the pure clean holy spirit of the living god oh may god help every one of us here today my friends oh my oh what a day we're living in we find out this is the same power that was used by the communists to espouse to preach teach propagate some teaching or some evil saying and repeat it over and over again until they got all their people to start believing in communism and so it was it hitler did the same thing lies lies lies lies until he got all the people to believe his lie as truth and many other despots authoritarians and people of that nature to entrench their positions have lied and lied and lied and lied over and over again lying against the purpose plan and will of god oh my do you see something here my friends isn't that the same spirit in the church here today when they lie like that it gives them that originality like i said the original uh believers in the church were all jews they came after them they were not jews but by being in the church they start to make a claim that they were jews and that gave them a sense of arrogance and of originality amen and exclusivity and then that begin to foster religious hatred religious envy religious jealousy just like it did between cain and abel think of it my friends this is the power of satan operating within the framework of the body of the church whoa that same spirit is here in the form of organization in the midst of the church of god and where the same group is claiming the same thing vultures called together by what by their smell are their need they're drawn together by dead meat they're drawn together by dead teachings dead doctrines around some dead animal all these are they who gather around a religious lie who emphasizes death instead of life emphasizing suffering and dying rather than emphasizing resurrection rapture and the day when our lordship shall return to earth again oh my lord god help us amen think of it claiming originality in the true church and claiming that salvation is only found in them because they are the original false original according to the word of god for the intertwine and sinuously in between into the framework and body of the church and began to make that claim which was a lie and still is a foul and evil lie being perpetrated thousands of years later and is still here among us that spirit that kind of a church with that personality is still here with us and it was a lie then and it is a religious lie now according to the word of god they claim they have the keys of the kingdom which they received from peter they even claimed that peter was the first pope they further claim that peter lived and resided in rome when it is a historical fact that peter never did their most educated intelligent annoying followers and adherents believe these lies oh my friends it's astonishing but we can see it they are a synagogue of satan and if satan be our father if she be the descendant of satan who is her father and he is the father of lies then she is the mother of religious lie spouting lies spewing lies out of her mouth according to the book of revelation and spreading the stream of foul sewage of lies everywhere spraying it and covering it all over the peoples of the earth so it is not strange that we have with us today a synagogue of satan or people indwelt by satan the church itself a synagogue of satan its adherence its people synagogues of satan indwelt inspired and and moved by him with his hatred and jealousy of the true church of god amen think of it god said that's blasphemy amen and in this case they were not blaspheming god but they were bearing false witness of the true church or blaspheming the true church so that the world would expect the true church and it gave a false impression of who the true church is and what she would be like so they were blaspheming against the true church amen hallelujah jesus and justice kane persecuted and killed abel because he came john 1st john i believe it's chapter 3 he came was the son of that wicked one not of adam but the son of the wicked one and of the false vine and he tried to destroy his brother abel that same spirit is in this false church who tries to uh destroy by inquisitions by by all manner of torture uh whether physically or spiritually or as assassination of character murder spiritually and naturally taking out or taking away the true believer the true church trying to destroy it so that the people will not have a frame of reference to recognize the true from the false whatsoever destroying the christians in the first few years of that first age and now this same false vine group is still here today and even more strongly attempting to destroy the true believer in this second age and in all the other ages to come even to this day and i'm going to close by saying this the antichrist spirit is still here with us and it is growing and growing every day until one day he will put in his personal appearance but until then my friends let us serve the lord true and faithful serving him every day giving glory and honor to his to his perfect will way and word amen until we come to receive our reward when we come to the last mile of the way may the lord jesus bless you real good and cover you under his precious blood and protect you from the assaults of the mind and of the soul from this evil synagogue of satan god bless you we'll meet again around the word of god amen and amen [Music] you
