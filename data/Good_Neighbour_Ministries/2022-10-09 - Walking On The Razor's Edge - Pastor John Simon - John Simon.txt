the house of the Lord and to be able to worship and see your beautiful faces amen now the Lord has given me a new song and so before I sing I would love the opportunity to share a testimony of how the phone came to be and you may recall that last fall we had the 40 days of prayer theories that we ministered on and then through that we had started these small groups and had you know the Bible study through that and our small group that we had a group of sisters together seven of us and if you've been with such a blessing at the end of the fury we decided that we wouldn't end our small group that we would continue because it was just such a refreshment for us to come each week and be able to share in the word and move the fellowship together even share what's in our hearts you know our burden that the scripture tells us you know bear one another burdens right so even today by God's grace it's been more than a year later our Sisters still meet weekly and it's just been such a wonderful blessing and you know there was one it's a Thursday night that we meet so one particular first day after our fellowship you're not just so excited with the love of God that we shared in our prayer and everything that we did and the melody for this chorus just poured from my heart I just started singing it I was actually in the kitchen doing dishes and the song just came to me I wonder you know some of my sisters how many of you have wonderful fellowship with the Lord right there in the kitchen it often happens for me personally so I just started singing the chorus and then I was like wow you know maybe I should do do something with that so by the grace of God you know from there the Lord placed a song in my heart and so I just like to take this opportunity to publicly thank my dear sisters in our fellowship they're taking sister Carol Sister Patsy sister Johnson sister Gita our precious sister Amanda right here and myself of course by God's grace and they've just all been such a blessing you know all of us just can encouraging each other we can just see how much the Lord has encouraged us and enriched our growth our growth together in him and so I feel like this song is also you know a testimony to them because the Overflow of the love that they shared with me and the expression of their love when they pray and they pray with their whole heart and that overflowed into the song so that's why I want to just give thanks for their lives and that the Lord will continue to bless them and that the Lord will continue to bless each of you and you of you all for his glory amen may we all walk in God's love of a thing in unity amen pray for the Lord foreign [Music] of the High Bridge and then he entered into the holy the holy of holy serve the king how good how blessed How

on two David is his son is coming against him with an army Absalom and he's writing three he's fleeing and then but first four he said something that just struck me in in midst of all of what he's going through he says thou has put gladness in my heart more than in the time that it was corn and wine increase he says I will lay me down in peace and sleep for thou O Lord has make his me to dwell in safety in the midst of everything that's happening he was dwelling in safety Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] you're the glory and the lifter of my hands [Music] are a shield for me

you God bless you all we're happy to be here today in the house of the Lord God bless you thank you so much welcome brother Tim Sister Laura Lee happy to have you here in the house of the Lord I have to see brother the brother Leon's family here and all of you gathered in the house of the Lord it's Thanksgiving time praise the Lord however our Thanksgiving is not according to tradition our tradition our Thanksgiving is according to the word amen we thank God for the pumpkins and the eggs and the and the rabbits God bless them uh they're there for us to eat and enjoy praise God so we give him thanks for all those things but that is not what our Thanksgiving is about amen we have the light of the world in us so we don't need the candles we don't need those things even though they're there but we are here to rejoice in the light of the God's word the day and the hour in which we are living in and I thank God that this is not a fantasy you're not in a Christianity where your mind is just going back and seeing lovely pictures of Jesus walking on the blue Galilee and that's nice but we're not going by that we are going by something that's being made known and revealed to us now and I can't give that to you no nobody can give it to you no man can educate you into it by Christian Bible studies and teaching none can bring you to that place God just breaks it on individually and as Judas was born to be the son of perdition this other group was born as Sons and Daughters of God it's nothing that they're going to do to become that uh nothing that they can do to change that they are who they are by the grace of God praise the Lord I have you standing while I'm already talking but Lord bless you real good for being here and we thank God that we are all on the journey traveling home praise God God bless you let's let's go to the word of God Amen you know the word is the most essential thing of course I enjoy the worship the singing and every Revival inspires songs brother Branham said that people get inspired so they write songs they sing songs and every Revival brings its own hymns and people get inspired by the word of God may God bless every one of us here today as we look into the word of God Hebrews 4 verse 12 and 13. we're just going to use that and speak for a while I want you to recognize that even though you might real say well brother Simon seems to be repeating himself that's true and the reason why some messages that I might have even preached before I I'm given new a light on some of those things and so I have to say it again in another and different way to bring out that facet of light that may be coming out of God's prism of Truth so we give him all the glory amen uh the new and the old mixed together God's word ancient word with light for today God bless you our father we thank you as we are about to read the word and speak the word give a voice to the word we pray that the holy spirit will bless us together and raise us up in Heavenly places in Jesus Christ For Your Glory for your honor and for your praise in Jesus name amen and amen praise the Lord hallelujah thank you Lord draw near and give glory to your name hallelujah praise God hallelujah Hebrews 4 verses 12 and 13. for the word of God is quick and Powerful and sharper than any to edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do amen praise the Lord the Lord bless you we want to take a thought here of Walking On The Razor's Edge a gracious father once again I praise and thank you and I just just anoint my lips and the ears of these ears as we give you glory amen the Lord bless you please be seated amen now uh last Sunday uh on I spoke on the subject of this deceiving hour this deceiving hour in which we live and uh just to mention this to you as soon as I was finished ministering the word here talking about this deceiving hour of the of the deception coming and being so close that a human senses can't just discern it you may discern it from time to time but in reality at the height of it the human senses will not be able to discern it and as soon as I was finished preaching and left the pulpit walked down as soon as I hit the door to enter the office I thought so that turn look at YouTube on your phone well I don't usually do that every time I come off the pulpit like that but the thought comes uh turn on YouTube so I did that and as soon as I turned it on there came up on the screen brother Harold Beckett of South Africa preaching on the twins the two Vines this deception of the two Vines and the twins and I just said praise God hallelujah I thank God for a wonderful confirmation and I believe I was also saying to you remember when these things are being revealed to us it doesn't mean that uh I I the days are gone when men start oh I'm the one that got this God revealed this and I'm the one no God is reaching out to his elected few wherever they are that truth is going out and it's radiating to his elected few whoever and wherever they are amen and we thank God for that and that's not the whole message they've been emoting those things but we don't know that that's the truth amen until God reveals it Hallelujah but now while speaking on that subject we began to tell you how that Satan has actually mastered all the manifestations that were given to each age he has mastered those manifestations he has gone through mastered production Americans is mastered tongues he can speak tongues of men and of angels he can speak those fluently his mastered miracles so much so that in the Book of Revelation the Bible tells us he is actually going to produce lying wonders is that right lying wonders there will be wonders there will be miraculous but they will not be pointing back to the word it will not point to the word but away from the word it may point to a great man it may point to a holy man but it will point you back to Jesus Christ who died for our sins raised again for justification coming again for a Rapture and we give God the glory and the praise for that amen hallelujah and he has mastered them all true to the last age that we're in he's mastered all the Pentecostal manifestations and he has now come up through all those seven Church ages growing stronger and stronger in his delusions until now he the seven churches are over and he has also tried to climb to the top of the pyramid now we know when he gets to the top of the pyramid then he finds out that he has a problem because he has impersonated and copied all the things that were done in the other ages see but now he has come face to face as in the mountain of Matthew 4 verse 4 he has come to the top of the mountain to him the Mount of Temptation and trial but he's come face to face with Jesus Christ and now he is challenging Jesus Christ amen the word incarnate for this hour Jesus Christ the coming of the son of man Christ coming again but in the bright fall are in the form of a bride right and now but it's still him in her as she came from his side now he lives in her and she is now manifesting the word that had come to her heart and we as Believers are to live and manifest and make real the word of God that has come into our heart amen and so he has that problem amen that now he is not facing him Jesus 2 000 years ago but he is facing the same Jesus in the True Church of Jesus Christ the true bride of Christ he is still facing him in her praise God but not him it's now her hallelujah it's not uh him back there but him here today in this form of a bride and he has to face her and she has to face him also face to face in that challenge she lost but in this challenge the bride wins the battle amen hallelujah praise the Lord because now we see he has an impossible task and the task is not to impersonate gifts like wonders tongues all these wonderful things of God but now he has to impersonate the very word itself he has to try to impersonate Jesus Christ himself now he's standing back and watching now because for him to do that he's got to have the Life of Christ in him and if it if it were possible he would be converted but for him to be converted you see but that's the problem he's faced with now that how is he going to impersonate the word itself now the word itself not some fake word he knows the fake from the real he made them up himself so you can't fool him with that he knows when he's facing the real thing right uh years ago uh again I was just a young man and um I think it was my father uh trying to cast a devil out of a woman that we knew we all knew her there and uh the devil told him says Mr Simon you're a good man at that time he didn't come to the message yet uh but you're a good man you live a holy life but you are not able to do this and then he so he set for another preacher a preacher that he knew and the preacher run and came while the preacher was like the distance of the back door of the church there the devil started laughing ah he says why are you coming what are you coming to do you just like me in other words what's in you is one of us so so what you're going to tell me right so there you go that devil on that preacher was deceiving so many people and they did not know the difference but uh the other devil knew that that was just like him praise God so he has an impossible task upon his hand now to come and try to impersonate the word of God hallelujah and we know that only the Holy Spirit can discern the difference I want to share with you this a wonderful uh saying or quote from trying to do God a service without it being God's will Now watch how close we get to that Razor's Edge now what the razor's Edge the difference between right and wrong and remember when you get there it will fall on one or the other side uh you can't be on both sides you're going to fall one side or the other side it's either with the elect fuel which will be a minority people don't want to face that fact they are believing the devil's lie that the church or the Church of Jesus Christ has to be a big beautiful church with hundreds of thousands of people well they might it must be true it must be right because how many of them are in there and it's the total opposite because Jesus himself says fear not little flock it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom everywhere he referred to the church he said it will be a minority it will be a faith just for you praise God of course we know a few in comparison to the billions in the world doesn't mean really two but it means a small minority and I don't mean this church or any other little church but I mean the true bride of Christ Within These groups or wherever they are like uh I I told you where it was said he said and the bride will be here there out there anywhere praise God she's scattered out there praise the Lord and we not to assume uh because we are living an obviously visible Christian Life that uh like Elijah we are the only ones no no no no no no no that's not the way it works God says I have some out there they are still in those denominations they're still eating Jezebel's food at her table they're still taking those things but I have them there for a purpose I have them there amen praise God so don't think that you're alone you're not alone I've got witnesses out there praise God hallelujah amen let me continue here he says no it'll fall on one or the other side till it comes down sometime like a horned razor between the difference between right and wrong it's it's got to be every word not just almost every word but every word and it's got down to that today amen remember let me repeat not to the lutherans not to the methodists not to the Pentecostals see not to them now the Pentecostals he was the messenger of the Pentecostal age he was uh the angel of the seventh Church of Revelation amen and yet he says it's not to that Pentecostal age amen it's coming to the old outage the honed out age the age that comes with the word that brings it right to the razor's Edge it's coming to that in this age and that age where the Antichrist anointing will be so perfected right it'll be so perfectly perfected it would that it would deceive be very elected if it were possible you oh my some will fall on the wrong side and if they don't watch you see because now it's become like a wedge amen hallelujah a later we'll talk about that how a wedge is a separator but watch amen be careful we are not remember I'm telling you we are not living anywhere in the Pentecostal age anymore now amen praise God brothers and sisters we we are passed out of that church age and a lot of people are saying that now when I was saying it years ago many were chuckling laughing saying what are you talking about what now they're saying the same thing and they're speaking it with confidence now they're recognizing it but back then it sounded like if it was just Folly oh my amen see they've Fallen the wrong sign now be careful we I want you to know we are now past that age amen we've passed that age in the same way that we have already passed the Lutheran age and them ages hallelujah praise God now you can check that your self praise the Lord so Satan got this problem on his hands he got to impersonate something but how are you going in person need something if the real is not the same you got to have the real before you can have a copy if you don't have the real then you can't have a copy so he has a problem here now for him to impersonate the real true word of the hour and as I mentioned now the seven Thunders have sounded the seventh Sundays of Revelation which you know is the voice of that Great Mighty angel of Revelation chapter 10 who stood there one foot on the land one on the sea had a little book in his hand with the book now open raised up to heaven and shouted with a loud voice time shall be no more and the Bible says and when he spoke his voice was like seven Summers rolling amen seven Thunders ruling Hallelujah and that would happen in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the seventh will unlock the seals but on Earth there would be revealed to a man Anointed with the power of the Holy Spirit of the Living God and we thank God that that has come to pass Hallelujah we praise God for all that but we are now in this deceiving hour Hallelujah and it's so dark in this hour that we are living in but we have to praise God that in the darkness we have a man here that can turn on the lights no matter how dark the room is there's the switch turn on the light and there's a man here who can turn on the light for he said I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but he shall have the light of life amen so the deception is getting worse darker as dark as the darkness that was in Egypt that could be felt since that the darkness is around us but in the middle of that all hallelujah thank God that God's children are promised that they will have Supernatural light amen that will show them the way out of this dark and sinful and Troublesome trial of this Trials of this world Amen Hallelujah now God has gotten it down so fine-tuned that he is now showing and revealing to us the true believers all of Satan's deceiving activities that he has been doing Through the Ages and now to this time what he is doing now in this ages and that now those efforts are concentrated especially within what we call the message this is where he is bringing his real impersonation so what I'm saying to you Satan hiding place is now in the message he is hiding within the ranks of the message of the Living God hallelujah and God is making sure we get this understanding this revelation of his word so plain that Satan doesn't have a rock to hide under when he has to confess the face with a true son or daughter of the Living God living by the word true on us to their word hallelujah amen when he comes face to face with that he doesn't have a rock to hide under amen praise God I want to make another thought here that at the same time when Israel was in all the darkness of Egypt amen it was so hard for them but you remember it was also a sign to them you ought to be getting ready to leave amen eat the lamb eat the bitter herbs kick in take the trials take the tribulations you're getting ready to leave the programs will come but you're getting ready to leave it's home time let's Rapture time back there they were headed to the Wilderness but now we are headed home to glory amen praise God out of the darkness into the light out of mortal into immortality out of all of these things on the earth we go into the Heavenly places in Jesus Christ by the opening of the word of the Living God amen hallelujah amen so we are now where are we walking on the razor's Edge amen right between right and wrong be enabled by the Holy Spirit to begin to discern between true and false amen praise the Lord Discerning between the counterfeit and the real and it's all in the message or what we call the message and say oh I'm in a message I'm your Capstone yeah I'm in the Capstone that sounds good but let's look to the word of the Living God Amen and we know only a little small tiny minority that will be able to catch that and not because again let me repeat not by human learning wisdom intellectuals no that is good amen but that is just for you to uh do whatever you have to do in this Mortal realm of life to be successful in this Mortal life to be uh you know Premiere exceptional and whatever you do natural life but when it comes to the things of God the mind of a man he says doesn't understand the things of God and God's mind is so deep it's far beyond your thoughts my thoughts so he actually has to invite you and bring you into his thoughts he has to bring you into his word he has to give you his understanding of his word in other words God has to become his own interpreter of his own word not you trying to interpret God's word using your finite human mortal mind that only has a few years on the earth you're here like grass and tomorrow the Bible says you're withered up your you've gone with the evening Breeze like smoke not pass it away with the blowing of the wind but we are here with the mind and life of God within us praise the Lord straightened and empowered to meet the challenge of this hour amen oh praise God we know Satan with his Sevenfold combination of all his powers wrapped up together coming against a bride Hallelujah but this is not the one he met in the garden this one is empowered by Jesus Christ within her amen hallelujah oh praise God Amen oh my goodness and I'm telling you we're in the time now when brothers and sisters I tell you uh the true church is literally going to be pushed out of the uh the systems of man the religious systems the religious order you'll be able to marry you won't be able to preach like I'm preaching be able to buy you won't be able to sell everything like that uh oh my brother I tell you what an hour uh the other day was speaking with uh somebody just about two days ago and they got some mixed up with their with their ideas and things like that do you know they could not do a thing they could only look at their book and see that they have so much money but they can't draw it out they can only look over there and see I should be able to do this but they can't get it because the system is set up in such a way that unless you are registered and you have an ID with them you cannot do it and the world is asleep not knowing that the Beast is already setting up a system and that when and if you are not a part of that system the Bible says in the Book of Revelation they will not be able to buy or sell or do anything amen without the the that registration or identification or acknowledgment of the Beast system that is already here it's not coming it's here and it's already it's working and using the children of disobedience right here on the face of the Earth praise the Lord hallelujah amen so God's Little minority which the Bible calls his speckled bird oh praise God how many of you know that little song uh let's sing maybe a verse of that do you have that there what a beautiful thought I am thinking help me now concerning a Great Speckled Bird it's in God's word it's recorded in God's word it's recorded come on you don't let me sing it holy word oh praise God I'm caught up in what I'm doing I'm not even looking up there I praise God for his wonderful word God's speckled bird speckled with what speckled with the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah it's not the red chemical or chemistry of the blood of Jesus that was shed on golgotha's Hill but she speckled with the life that was in that blood and the life that was in that blood is the word quickened or revealed which is the Holy Spirit thought she is mocked by the Holy Spirit on her life working manifesting through her praise the Lord aren't you glad you're speckled by the blood are you glad for the great Holy Spirit uh working and moving upon your life praise the Lord hallelujah I thank God for that amen amen but that little minority still holding on to the truth of God's word amen and when she hold on to that truth because millions billions are not believing that they're gonna say that she is off of the word uh she don't really believe the word because they're not seeing what you're seeing is that right yes they're gonna they won't even gonna say uh she's out of step with the word but she's not the one out of Step as we know in that great vision she is in stack with the word she just happens to be the minority you can have a great big army over there marching to maybe they're in Step but what they're in step is not to what she's in step with because uh as the old song says do You Hear What I Hear oh my I'm hearing a different beat I'm hearing a different sound I'm hearing a different Symphony going forth Hallelujah and I'm marching according to that word hallelujah amen yes sir o praise God so in the eyes of many and I'm telling you now she will look like she is the one that is of the word because everybody else saying this this is everybody's saying that that how come just you you all are just a few of you you expect us to believe you you know you could ask all the prophets the same thing Elijah you're the only one in Israel saying he's saying we expect us to believe you but that was the word of God my career look I got 400 and something profits here and they're all telling King Ahab go up to the battle you're gonna win and Micaiah one little old scrubbly looking man gets up there and says well uh you know you can say that but I he doesn't want to tell the king to his face he's gonna die I see Israel scattered like sheep having no Shepherd [Music] mad because he was also a a Jew he was also one that believed in the great Jehovah and he understood well what that meant he says give him bread and water and lock him in a prison till I come back the prophet was about to walk away turn around he says if you come back God has not spoken to me amen God hasn't spoken to him but he was in the minority all of them all the 400 preached more unfortunate preachers or whatever were all saying the same thing and saying totally different to what he was saying but yet he was right amen that great big majority doesn't mean anything God reserves the right his word can overrun and overrule everything else hallelujah praise God hallelujah amen but now Satan is now starting to create an atmosphere here amen where the good looks evil and the evil start to look like they're good and that's the atmosphere he's creating again in the end time another seed of discrepancy where people are in doubt oh what is good what is evil what is true what is false until they are so their mind is so caught up they just don't know what to believe the only ones that will make it through that uh that confusion will be God's elected few whom he the steps of a righteous man or woman are ordered or ordained by the Lord himself blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah amen praise God of course we can see not typed in Esau and Jacob uh one looked good and the other one looked evil and then it turns out that the one that looked Eagle was really God's God's son and the other one that looked like a real gentleman and everything else with the Mortal eyes human eyes that was the one that was rejecting and against the word of God hallelujah amen but thank God God is showing us overall the things you've been hearing all this time coming down to now he's was training us and showing us how to get to the point where you are literally able to discern Satan regardless of what Veil he tries to hide behind what rock he tries to hide under you are able to discern him by the razor's Edge by the word Hallelujah remember what this raises Edge is amen as you read it in Hebrews 4 12 for the word of God Amen is quick and powerful and sharper than any to edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents or intentions of the heart amen praise the Lord nothing is hidden in the sight and that's where it's come down to because it tries to impersonate it now it's come to the racist Edge the edge of the sword of the king has come to walking on that edge amen of the king's sword left or right right wrong true false either side but the ones that will walk that edge Walk the Line and obey the real world and Promises of God for this age hallelujah amen and just as King when he realized that he had come to the height of all he could do and all he could present was flowers and fruits the fruits of his hands and his labor and his brother with no effort didn't look all he did was walk behind a bunch of sheep all day doing nothing it seems because he's just walking behind sheep he's not actually working up his he's not he's just walking behind sheep hey man oh my so I did all that for God I sacrificed I fasted I prayed for 10 days 20 days I've been in the Bible and the message for for for so many years you know I gave to this hospital and it profited you nothing and I did this and I did that and he says except you get the revelation of the word of God the grace the charity God's love shown towards you by giving you this Revelation you profited you nothing amen my brother's sister what an hour hallelujah amen but God wants us to see this until we are so strong in the power of His might Satan cannot shake you he cannot move you and none of the deceptions will work amen so Justice came when he sees it growing more and more yeah you know for people to listen to him he's got to kill his brother right because if his brothers it's just like when Jesus and the Pharisees and the Sadducees were here the people were listening to what Jesus have to say is that right and say oh my if we don't shut this guy up then then they're gonna follow him and they're not going to follow us anymore so for them to come back to the synagogue for them to come back to the rabbinical priesthood for them to come back to these Traditions that we have and so on we've got to get rid of him crucify him that will now come against the Bride of Jesus Christ in the same way but not on a mountain not with a sword not with a spear but with rumors with lies with accusations look before I go to a foreign country to preach the word of God I'm not I'm there just maybe for an hour and and somebody is saying something and when they're speaking right out they're speaking and right away can discern that people have gone ahead of me and caused me much pain oh my I I just have to keep quiet and watch and listen and do whatever I have to do I go to another foreign country out in the Pacific somewhere there and then you find uh things run ahead and people trying to do dessert I discern this brother and I discern that brother you're telling me you deserve that and I'm looking at you and I'm seeing everything that you're doing and you're telling me that you're Discerning when I know that that's nothing but the Acuity of human perception the person that really has that kind of thing they don't even know how they know you can't teach that you can't learn that it's not something that you can discern when you feel like discerning or or something no it's God an individual when he Wills amen it can't even be explained praise the name of the Lord praise God hallelujah amen glory to God so he murdered his brother and there again the bride will come to the place where she is going to be literally crucified or murdered because they're going to murder your character is that right they murder your character and kill it because what they're getting at is killing the ministry it's trying to get at the word that is in you that they don't come out that it doesn't get a chance to express itself and even if it expresses itself they put a shadow a dark cloud on it oh my oh he's got a lot of words so so you start listening to his words rather than your spirit Discerning the meaning and seeing what God has back of all that amen you you're thrown off he does everything like that in every way that he possibly can amen hallelujah and uh as the Bible says they begin to pour coals of Fire on the bride's head think about it calls a fire on her to persecute her in every way but just as God's first Masterpiece was smitten on Calvary so will this bride which is the Masterpiece of God for this hour She is again going to be smitten amen she will be struck by the day by the evil that is in this day that we are living in amen praise God hallelujah I'm so glad that we are living in this day aren't you happy amen praise God smitten bruise rejected of men all that rejected of men are not just natural men ordinary men but also the religious system shall be rejected of that amen remember anointed ones at the end time thus said the Lord First Timothy second Timothy 3 18 in the last days this Journeys and jambres will again be on the Earth he's not talking about them physically coming back but he's saying the spirit of those men will be back here on the Earth and notice see their impersonation is for you to see what is right and what is wrong they'll do the same miracles impersonating even the true word amen see Hallelujah because they remember the true word has already been quickened by the Holy Ghost and revealed to the True Believer amen so all they can do that is now try to copy it copy after that that's there now I know God will not let me tell you all about this at this time amen and to tell you what is really the truth are you listening but one day you are going to find out amen and at that day you will see that this was to make their folly manifested that wasn't right at the beginning in other words God allowed me to do that but it wasn't right at the beginning I'll tell you that one day but only if the Lord permits amen and they do the same Miracles but they did not and cannot do them until the original ones go forth that the same way he did in the garden amen that's the way he has to do it all the time amen o praise God I want you to recognize us brothers and sisters hallelujah amen that God is trying us now look I'm gonna wind this down it's it's Thanksgiving I know you have to go I'm not just catering to that but I just want you to to bring this in because I I need to move to a this very subject but in another way um the next time we come together is that okay praise the lord we want to take it to a Next Level and show you what walking on the razor's Edge is of course we know Enoch did that he walked on that raises Edge also in the day in which he was until he walked right in to the presence of the Living God hallelujah amen no matter what Satan is doing now he can't destroy the spirit that is within you and therefore his task is impossible and therefore what he's doing is a waste of time for he can't destroy the spirit that is within you he cannot destroy the gene that is within you Hallelujah and I thank God for that that the more that he does like that it's the more that the bride grows in the wisdom Revelation and understanding of the great Holy Spirit and I praise God and give him glory and praise for that amen hallelujah may God bless every one of you here today and give you a very Happy Thanksgiving now that I've finished preaching what I believe to be the truth you can now go and eat your turkey well I'm just take you come down from the spiritual and now you can go and take your natural and while you are taking in the natural you can talk about the truth of the spiritual that you received is that right praise God hallelujah I've just left you not with bones but with some meat that you can chew on praise the Lord God bless every one of you praise God in a wonderful marvelous way I'm so happy you know especially when you're in a race and you're coming down to the end of the race and there are fewer and fewer people in the race nothing is wrong with the race but it's the endurance of the people that's in that race and as you go down to the end of the race then you appreciate those who have the endurance who have the perseverance and who have the desperation Hallelujah and like the a great runner in the in the Olympics you know uh everybody had crossed the finish line and he was still running and the crowd wanted why is this guy still running everybody else crossed the finish line and they're running and the the crowd everything else like that and he kept running and running until he too was able to cross the finish line but when he crossed the Finish Line he had the biggest cheer of of the entire Stadium stood up and they shouted and they they just shouted the yell because he had crossed the finish line and then when they interviewed him they said um how come you just kept running when everybody else is already crossed you didn't even win the race you came in last and you you know this and that you know he says you don't understand my country didn't send me here necessarily to win the race amen but they sent me to finish the race is that right that's why the Bible tells us and be ye faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life that faded not away thanks be to God hallelujah amen you may not appear to be the best Christian you may not be appear to be the most Victorious the most successful but God is looking and calling upon you to finish the race for his glory be thou faithful unto death yeah God bless you Hallelujah brother amen God bless all of you happy Thanksgiving Happy Thanksgiving is here Elijah God is with us today he says [Music] [Applause] she was she talks and names [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] have to reveal the son of man today please [Music] [Applause] [Music]
