know why the Lord chose me first to minister first but I have a thought that the lord gave it to me and I really thank the Lord as a our beloved old Pastor what the Lord did through him but brothers and sisters he has done a great job finish he's gone let us to look to the new we don't have to be flogged looking backwards we have to look into forward because God don't like those that wanted to move backwards God loved those those that wanted to move forward with his word now we have our new pastor my precious brother my precious Pastor which is Pastor Dany maeri and his precious wife I love them with all my heart let us support them in our prayers in everything even though our old Pastor is gone but let us remember him and his family in prayer and pray for one one another let us be like a sheep if somebody is coming to fight us we put our head together and fight that person either he will go out or he will come in and join is that not what brother Braham teaches because he was the prophet for 20th century so please uh my scripture I'm going to take as you stand brother philli you're going to read for me Jer H Joshua 6 1 uh chapter 6:1 to 20 but I'm reading first Joshua today I'm going to speak about Joshua that's what was on my heart that's why brother Cory I didn't want you to even go that close there yet cuz I you you going to you were as soon as you mention Joshua you were making me so I have to shut your mouth because God was dealing with me on Joshua so I read Joshua 1-2 then you come and read Jericho 6ter 1-2 for me uh let us bow our heart and pray gracious Eternal Father Lord Jesus the author and the finisher of of our faith Lord Jesus without you we are nothing without you we cannot do anything concerning your word Lord if you don't come I will be useless I'll be miserable I will be confused and speaking things that are contrary to your word to your children father I take myself away you know my heart anything that is contrary to your word I repent so do my brothers and sisters so father Jesus I invite you in as we read your word may your spirit draw near and come and take control in Jesus name amen and amen Joshua 1 chapter 1 now after the death of Moses the the Ser now after the death of Moses the servant of the the Lord it come to pass that the Lord speak unto Joshua the son of none Moses my servant my sorry Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people into the land which I do give unto them even to the children of Israel so now you come you read Jericho sorry H Joshua chapter 6 I always say Jericho 6 1-24 me if you have the mic 1 to 26 1 to 20 now Jericho was straightly shattered because of the children of Israel Nan went out and none came in and the Lord said unto Joshua see I have given into thine hand Jericho and the King thereof and the Mighty Men of Val and ye shall Compass the city all ye Men of War and go round about the city once thou shall thou do six days and seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams horns and the seventh day you shall Compass the city seven times amen and the priest shall blow with the trumpets M and it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with the Ram's Horn and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall Shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall Ascend up every mind straet before him and Joshua the son of Nan called the priest and said unto them take up the Ark of the Covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of horns before the Ark of the Lord and he said unto the people pass on and the and the compass Encompass the city and let him that is armed passed on before the Ark of the Lord and it came to pass when Joshua has spoken unto the people that the seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams horns pass on before the Lord and blew with the trumpets and the Ark of the Covenant of of the Lord follow them and the arm men went before the priest and that blew with the trumpets and the rain reward came after the ark the priest going on and blowing with the trumpets and Joshua had commanded the people saying ye shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I B you shout then shall ye shout so the Ark of the Lord compassed the city going about it once and they came into the camp and lodged in the camp and Joshua Rose early in the morning and the priest took up the Ark of the Lord and the Seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams HS before the Ark of the Lord went on continually and blew with the trumpets and and the arm men went before them but the re reward came after the act of the Lord the priest going on and blowing with the trumpets and the second day they Compass the city once and they returned into the camp so they did six days and it came to pass on the seventh day that he rose early about the dawning of the day and Compass the city after the same manner seven times only on that day they Compass the City seven times and it came to pass at the seventh time when the priest blew with a trumpets Joshua said unto the people shout for the Lord had given you the city and the city shall be Aur even it and all that are therein to the harot to the Lord only Rahab the har shall live she and all that are with her in the house because she had The Messengers that went because she hatte The Messengers that we we sent and ye in any way keep yourselves from the a thing lest ye make yourself Aur when you take of the ating and make the camp of Israel Aur and troubles but all the silver and gold and vessels of the brass and iron are consecrated unto the Lord and they shall come unto the treasury of the Lord that's so the people shouted when the priest blew with a trumpet and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the city amen everybody say amen Amen brother B brought a trumpet then we get on [Music] sh [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] brother it's all right brother may the Lord had his blessing may everyone be seated we all have seen the scripture that we read back then it was referring to Israel scripture have compound meaning today the scripture is referring to you and I because God is speaking to us when we read this scripture this scripture is speaking to we the wife of Christ because when we check we are in number of what four right four is the bride number we are in 2004 four is the number of what the bride which is the wife of Christ we have turned a corner we are in the last hour the last of the last hour Hallelujah we are no more going to be bapes in the word of God because God has babed us for too long so the hour is late that's why I don't know even this scripture where brother FIP read I can read it but I can't read it reg continue seriously so I have to let the brother help me to read it but I don't know it's burning on my heart and I says Lord okay if that's the way you want me to bring it when I come here I'll let one of my brother read it for me the Lord is saying to us the seven seal was open in 19663 most of us wasn't born right we were not born yet most of us in the message I know some of our pastor age they were born young men and they came in they cut hold of the message and God has used them we thank God for that for their age but the age has moved on changes has come whether you like it or not as the Lord is saying to us now as I was with Moses Moes my servant Moses is dead brother Abraham is gone he's not coming back we're going to meet him over there am so now the Baton is who pass on the young man through Pastor Simon age that came their age they are now passing on the what the message to us now the Baton has become us to take it so the Lord is saying to us as I was with Moses so would I be unto you 1.2 is saying my servant Moses is dead now Joshua arise so count yourself as Joshua generation hallu because Joshua generation you are going to go into the land which the Lord God swear unto our forefathers all the prophecy that he prophesy in the Bible concerning the bride we are the one that are going to fulfill it so you don't have to be a babe Joshua is not going to babe you there's no time for for big children and let me tell you we live in the hour all those that are false preachers calling themselves five four Ministry that have hold RAB into the message age into the mess age this is the hour let me tell you Joshua is hereu I said Joshua is here to lose Rahab from all the mess age and bring her into the life that she will know her hour her time her season because we live in a season whereby if we could look Israel right now as I'm speaking right one time Samson took a Jawbone and slew thousands Philistines in Gaza right today it's not a Jawbone it's gun but it's still the same thing they are slowing and slaughtering the Philistines whether you like it or not it's the same thing they are doing right what hour they are living in because before they were sleeping they were slacks during the time of Moses people still remember why he was taking them through the Wilderness they remember the Egyptian gar they love the Egyptian Gar so they won't line up they won't worship God they won't obey God but during the time of Joshua when Joshua is taking over let me tell you are you with us or are you against us this is the hour God is saying are you with me or are you against me because I'm doing new thing that you don't know because William Braham is dead I'm going to do new things in you I've given you the land go and possess it Hallelujah every demon that is holding you have to break because this is the fourth number of what four the bride the wife of Christ time every de demon or tradition or culture or anything that is bandag on you have to be break religious spirit have to broke because God is fixing to move if you are not going to move you're going to be left behind because God is serious about his work to fulfill it and if you are part line up we are not here for joke we are not here to play church we are not here to play lovey lovey or or religious fantasy or to look one another oh this brother is good or this brother is not good or whatever all we are here for is to fulfill the word of God with th say the Lord Jesus when Joshua is here Joshua t Christ I know that and Joshua also you can type yourself into what Joshua is saying Jericho won't give up easy the king Jericho King type Satan he would love to bind you chain you chain you with the things of the world sometime chain you with bu work business uh your wife your children your your your your husband but you got to shake it out anything that would be taking you away from the word of God for this hour is of the devil we got to call it as it is come out and take the Cross of Christ so that Christ will get the glory are you with us or are you against us because Joshua there is no time for nothing because brother William Braham if you check the way he used to preach in his time he didn't have a good name amongst the people even his own people that were around him didn't like him most of them didn't like him and if you going to stand for Christ you're not going to get a good name you're going to be persecuted you're going to be hated you going to be called all kinds of name that's where it's you alone and Christ you alone and Christ but if you stand by Christ Christ will stand by you Joshua never fail it is so read Joshua get the people together and said follow me everything I say don't question do it you don't need to understand you don't need to reason you don't need to question those question days are over because it's the Holy Spirit which is the Lord Jesus Christ going to leaders and why he's leading there's no argument there's no by biting there's no hypocrisy because God when he's leading like that all the people when they surrender everything God want for them he will accomplishing brothers and sisters we so many of us has been in the message for so long we have seen so much things we have seen hypocrisy we have seen good thing we have seen the power of God we have all kinds of things we have seen what was that God was training us God was molding us but the time has come the season has come God is saying the babysitter Days Are Over Joshua is here from the pastor to the Pew when I'm talking I'm not talking to the congregation alone I I like our brothers or our pastor will say I point four finger to myself and one point you so there's no going to be look one you have to love God with all your heart with all your mind with all your soul with everything that you have in you surrendering to God so that the word will be fulfilled there's no time for playing Church playing Church won't do it playing church will not do it reasons won't do it a lot of people can read brother Brown message they can tell us from from one of his message to 1,200 of his message but where is the power of God where is the power of God I'm speaking to the congregation but also is going out so I have to let them see most of them have preached preach preach preach preach preach there's not even one Vindication of their preaching and they call themselves five4 Ministry no God is not like that listen as I preach if I don't see God proven to me I have to step down and let the one that can do do because we are in the time of Joshua days and Joshua days is not going to be joke it's not going to be uh lukewarm and playing Church even let me tell you one man with God is majority if you look at Israel now they are telling lebano if you don't shut up you see what we have did to Gaza we are going to do the same thing to you and we the bride have to tell the devil if he doesn't get away from us we are going to kick him out because we have God in us God already live in you if you are the wife of Christ Christ already live in you everything you need to do the job is already in you amen so you have to tell him the power is given to you the gun to shoot the enemy is on your side you are holding the gun the enemy don't have a gun and you going to be scared of the enemy right no we're not going to be grasshoppers we have to take the land as God commanded Joshua as brother Abraham delivered the message that God gave it to him onto us one thing I saw it was make my heart sad some Pastor the place we went in Ghana the God is changed like here and the pastor sent the new one sent me two people baptizing in brother Abraham name I have it in mind I think brother deson have it said brother see what is going on is that what the prophet left us no devils are already impersonating the message making that's why they call us Braham might this might D might this that that all kinds of names but let me tell you because the message is true if it is true give all your life support it with all your life and let God possess you God is ready as brother Brown says but the people are not ready is the hour God is saying I am ready are you ready are you are you going to be obedient to him are you going to let him do what he want to do with you let me tell you the God we serve is not a dead God we don't want a God on the W no sir we don't want you to tell me about what brother brah did no say it's good I love it but all those things are wonderful but let me tell you if it doesn't produce the power of God then it's painted fire on the War I don't need that I need God in a skin God in reality because the Lord says my word will never return unto me void it will accomplish what I have spoken during the time of the Apostles when they speak they speak there were man with few words but there were men also some of them were are literate like even I'm better than them but when they speak they speak with boldness they speak with authority because Jesus has been with them Hallelujah and they have Jesus inside them but I'm sorry to say in the message we have a lot of preachers claiming to be preachers they don't have Jesus in them they have the cause of brother Braham message in them but this is the hour the time of Joshua this is the hour whether you like it or not it's upon you it's upon me as I preach it's upon me also we have to take the gospel seriously let me tell you and possess the gates of the enemy and let this word of God guide us lead us and prove to us that God live that brother Braham God that people has tried to mess his name is a real God it's not a dead God he a god of the pill of fire who does not change he a consuming fire the same way he was with Israelites the same way he has come to as Gentiles amen brothers and S sister this is the hour number of four and number of four is your number right five type what Grace four type what the bride I am not a big educated person but the little that I know I know that number four is my number right so if you don't know that four is your number if we are in the year 2004 and I go to Ghana I see the guard changing the pastor that was there is old filing away and another coming has coming our pastor going out another has come coming I believe the true five4 Ministry the old preachers like Pastor Simon age most of them are going to give way for the youngs to come in the true ones but you know those that are not true they're going to hold on with still Egyptian gar gun to shoot but that one won do nothing but let me tell you thank God for a true Pastor thank God for our Pastor John Simon he has passed the touch the touch has been passed and it has fall on our brother let us not leave him alone so that you alone will be carrying the ark and me alone carrying the ark nobody is there we have to be faithful coming to service faithful testifying faithful with ning faithful cleaning our life so that the Holy Spirit can move and do the job that it will be easy for the brother while he step here the holy spirit will take over him and we the brothers that God has chose from me the leas to brother Tim de brother Christopher brother Desmond brother Philip and who God ever will choose wherever they step here the holy spirit will just come in and do the job then we won't see the brother we will see God moving when God is in action it's a different story right the trumpet the last trumpet has sounded whether we like it or not it has sounded God is saying to us the message the seven seal was open 1963 William Bram died 1965 so he babysitters babysitter he did babysit but now there's no more babysitter no more if you see a brother that coming wouldn't take the message talking against it tell him brother either you take it or go either you take it or go there's no time to joke ex sister the same way one thing I have learned in my life before you meet people you share the message you talk talk talk talk you think you can do the job you cannot do anything it's God that does the job is the holy spirit that does the job and when the Holy Spirit is doing the job is not hard one word you see the hard turn things change the person will be ready to follow what you said Eugene is sitting here when I met him it wasn't difficult that night we just spoke and why I was about to finish brother phlip came spoke one or two words the next day he was in church and since that day the brother has been coming to today baptized and gave his life to Christ and coming to today that's what it's not mean that day is God he used me he used brother Peter that day he gone for his reward so brothers and sisters what am I saying once the torch has been passed don't let us be slack oh Pastor Simon is gone so now the Holy Spirit can't move no more so we go into our tomb because we woman being we love the old we don't love the new even when I was moving my own children AB girl is sitting here to Welling they have they for them to move from willing to H sorry Toronto to willing Emmanuel want to stay in Toronto every girl want to stay in Toronto they give all kinds of excuse my wife put his phone to them he says husband whether they are coming or they are not coming we moving we are moving right sometime human beings we need that kind of change put your food whether they crying they groaning your children groaning your even yourself your heart whether pain or no pain you going God is looking for that not people that oh today I have headache so I have to stay home a little bit snow on the road I'm not coming to church that means you get some Demon hiding somewhere is it truth or not truth I'm talking

meeting you ask them to play they hide themselves like Nicodemus coming by night right you coming by Night listen if you are ashamed of God God will be ashamed of you if you deny him he will deny you if you want listen if you want to worship God you're going to be like a mad person to the people even in the church sometime you are like Mad person you come and the Holy Spirit is moving and speaking

with you but your hour has come Hallelujah whether you like it or not your hour has come it doesn't matter two or three the Lord will do the job amen thank you Lord hallelujah it doesn't matter who will not scam or who will try to be hypocrite the Lord will chop that person off and let his word go forth because is Joshua it's not me or him or him or you or anybody but it's the Lord Glory and Honor be unto who the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ him and him alone if we are willing to honor him and giving him the praise there's nothing the Lord can do let me tell you we want to see dead R we want to see criple walk we want to see blind ey open I am not saying that is the absolute but it's part of the word it's part of the word amen and God will perform it yes for us to see the holy spirit will perform it but if we are not giving him the praise if we are not willing to surrender our heart if the word is coming and we're going to sit down like a graveyard how would the Lord do it for us to see we have to praise him as the word come forth we have to lift the brother who is preaching who who stand here it doesn't matter it's me it's the pastor is brother Christopher or brother Daniel or brother desm brother philli or even if the Lord choose a little child to come one day to stand here it doesn't matter him we should look away to Jesus when we look away to Jesus all things are what possible possible we woman being we want to see before we believe this generation that has come want to see the signs and wonders before they believe but they don't want to believe before before they see they don't want to worship before they see they don't want to come to service before they see because holywood has given us holywood religion we can stay home watch the preaching if you have gone to work you are old you are sick or something has happened that's all right that's all is all about and if you are not living here far away that's all right but if you are living where you can come to the service do everything to get into the service and if you come you support it with all your heart when the preaching is coming don't sleep don't let your mouth devil put zip on it don't you know that is a Satan doing that when he put a zip on your mouth you cannot shout you cannot praise God you cannot even singing is going on you cannot sing when you want to lift your hand oh the brother say Lift Your Hand go hallelujah hallelujah what kind of Praises is that what kind of Praises is that Praise Him Hallelujah do you know what the Lord has done for you one in a million million people were standing there and the Lord chose youl like you need to go to her but the Lord says no oh to you he chose you and brought you out and put his Spirit on you so once the spirit is on you don't feel shame to give him praise be like have you ever seen a person where the devil he has gone crazy in here they put them out but in Africa you see that those crazy people you see them or drunk man he go like this go like that and singing and shouting and pray right the man is drun when Jesus has got hold of you his Spirit has got hold of you he have to let you shout he have to let you praise Him have to let you when singing is going on sometime you raise up and give lift up your hands and give him thanks and shake the devil let him you become like a hot potato as our Pastor said former Pastor said for the devil you see the devil running for a cover and you say yes devil I'm coming after you I'm coming after you because the Lord has done great thing for me if he hasn't done for you for me kentry the Lord has done for me without this gospel I always said I love to be in the grave because grave there none that goes to the Grave praise the Lord if you don't praise him here what time are you going to praise him if you don't give him all your Praises when you go up there you going to praise him the things start here right now right now Hallelujah so let tonight the first day of 2004 be
