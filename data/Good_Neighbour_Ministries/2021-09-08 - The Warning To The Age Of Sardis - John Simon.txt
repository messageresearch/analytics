TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] welcome friends praise be to our god indeed jesus is coming soon morning or night and or noon oh praise god it may be at the midnight hour but jesus can come at any time so may our hearts be ready may we be prepared praise god hallelujah as you know when we come together like this on wednesday evening it is a time of feeding on the word of god amen now when these studies are brought i am not here trying to bring an in-depth study on any individual subject i am just covering the seven church ages of the book of revelation one two three now remember there are various doctrines that will be touched on doctrine of the serpent seed doctrine of the godhead doctrine of the nickelodeons doctrine of balaam and balaamism book of life you know judgment hell different doctrines but i am not going into any in-depth teaching on those individual doctrines i am teaching enough to spark your interest and to draw you to a place of inspiration where you can do an in-depth study on whatever particular subject that the spirit of god will lead you to i've been blessed by hearing one of brother uh telling me that he was inspired of god and led to do a particular study on a particular subject and i rejoice at that and i thank god for that because that is exactly what we want to accomplish not to just uh give you uh a table just filled with all the good things of god but just enough to whet your appetite to stir up your hunger and your thirst and desire after god that it will drive you back to the sermons the scriptures and that you will search them for in them you think you have eternal life may the spirit of god take his word and identify to you that you are one of his own i'm going to continue teaching on the seven church ages and tonight in particular the warning to the age of sardis warning to the age of sardis this is found in revelation chapter 3 verse 2. let us read the word of god be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for i have not found thy works perfect before god gracious heavenly father thy word has been read now let the bread be broken as we commit our hearts and lies to thee for this brief moment of time take praise honor and glory with the opening of thy word in jesus name amen the warning to sardis now of course you're aware that the age of sardis is the age of reformation it speaks of the time of reformation and of course the age of reformation is just the start or the beginning of the full restoration that god promised to his church saying i will restore saith the lord that is a promise from god and to begin that restoration god started it with a reformation so reformation which will later lead to the fullness of restoration thanks be to god strengthen that which remains that is ready to die so immediately there's something missing god is saying there is some uh important quality or element some spiritual deficiency was in this age uh that was causing the age to die just as anyone can suffer from a vitamin or vitamin uh deficiency of some important vitamin that you should have in your constitution in your body this age was suffering from deficiency this age my friends as we will show with this deficiency was an age brought to reformation by the revelation through the messenger martin luther however the age was unfulfilled and the age was deficient in that it did not go on to sanctification and later on to the baptism of the holy spirit now that in itself shows the deficiency in that particular age also in this age of sardis they had the word the written word was restored back to them remember we uh teaching on how the word was locked away from the people pat locked in the pulpits behind the doors of uh seminaries and and monasteries and and god after wild opened up the door and then the printing uh presses began to roll and the bibles began to be printed and the word began to spread and as such the the people now had access to the written word they had access to the written word but they my friends they did not have a full revelation of the word of god which was yet to come neither they were deficient in the works of christ amen for remember that the church is the temple of the living god and when a church is filled with the holy ghost then it produces the works of christ for christ in you is your hope of glory christ in the church and the kingdom is being restored back to its original works amen when the jesus christ in the form of the holy spirit was in the early church the spirit of god fell the anointing of god was with them in them working through them hallelujah amen back in that church at pentecost hallelujah we saw the works of god the crippled walk the blind saw the dumps spake the word was preached in power and an anointing jail houses rocked and shook with the testimonies of the grace of almighty god but this age did not have those work works of god it was deficient in the inspiration of going beyond the just shall live by faith that was a wake-up call for the church that was just the beginning as i've said a reformation leading later on to the fullness of restoration oh praise god hallelujah yes sir god wanting to restore his people back from those dark ages of the depth of the blackness darkness ignorance and cruelty of the depths of satan god wanted to bring them back to the light of christ the light of the word back to the depths of god by the revealing of the word of god and to bring them back to what the apostles had on the day of pentecost and thereafter with the presence of their messenger paul the mighty apostle of the lord jesus christ now in this second verse we read for i have not found thy works perfect before god amen not perfect in other words unfulfilled not perfect meaning that the age is unfulfilled hallelujah it was just the start it did not fulfill all god had in his thoughts but it started the restoration with a move of reformation amen hallelujah it started out with the doctrine that they just shall live by faith hallelujah the doctrine of justification which in actual fact was it was and is the teaching that salvation is all of god salvation by grace through faith not by the works of man not by the will of man not by the figments of the imagination or the proliferation of the production of man's intellectual capacity to produce such things but salvation is by the grace of god alone hallelujah there's nothing we as humans can add to the salvation for jesus did a perfect work glory to god hallelujah and no works of man can be added to that martin luther by that also taught the sovereignty of god hallelujah he also believed in thought and taught election hallelujah god by election brings you into his kingdom praise god and because he knew that all we have now is all by grace it's all by god's grace the richness of his grace and mercy is what has drawn us and brought us back into his marvelous kingdom hallelujah martin luther also on the inspiration of this very doctrine by god's word the discerner was able to separate ecclesiastical hierarchy from ruling over the people of god amen and he was so as we will say in our parlance our way our day he was so fired up and ready to go that he tore down the idols he tore them down smashed them broke them wherever he could find them and got rid of the idols he also preached against confessions being given to priests sinful men like yourself confessing to them and offering up yourself as a prisoner for blackmail a prisoner for persecution a prisoner for many other things that one can expand upon from that point of view and also crowning to it he denounced the pope he denounced the pope of that day and that time hallelujah it was wonderfully good it was a marvelous start but that's what it was this reformation was good but it was only the beginning of the great promise of restoration that was to come hallelujah in other words it was as if god was saying luther i am going to let you start things but you're not going to see everything i have in my mind fulfilled in your age but you are going to be the first one for these days carrying the baton which you will have to pass on to john wesley god isn't actually telling that but i am just uh vocalizing in a way for you to understand what it is god was saying your age is unfulfilled those that are coming after you will carry on the work but at the end of the way you will see the fullness of the word for when we come to the fullness of church ages the time amen when the angel would put one foot on the land and one on the sea cry and swear by him that liveth forever and ever that time shall be no more meaning that the church ages have come to their fullness and to their end at that time of course we see the fullness of restoration we see god's people brought back to their original position hallelujah amen oh praise god god was telling luther in a nice way martin i'm leaving the rest of it for later hallelujah i tell you friends our god reigns i said our god reigns hallelujah amen and god knows the end from the beginning luther was the messenger to th this age of sardis and many times a messenger doesn't look like a messenger or appear to be a messenger like that you see we when you look at looter and you search the histories and biographies of this man and uh records about him he had his own personal flaws but despite his flaws that is the one man surrendered enough that god saw fit that he could use him in that age to fulfill his will and to bring about his purpose and so despite his flaws god used martin luther hallelujah and that my friends is a principle we must always look at because many look on men of god and search through what they are saying search through their lives search through their background search through everything thinking that they're gonna find no flaws but god hides in simplicity and reveals himself in simplicity god the perfect one manifest through the imperfect so that you could recognize that it's not just that man it's god working through an imperfect vessel to bring about his glory in the bible we are told that there was the prophet jonah and how jonah had flaws in his life for when god told him in the bible amen to go and do this he runs the opposite way and finds himself in the belly of a whale and many people are finding themselves in untenable circumstances and situations and uh as if to say in the belly of the whale you look up there's nothing to see you look behind there's nothing you look forward there is a dark tunnel you look behind it's dark you look beside it's dark seaweed's all around you you're in the belly of a great fish my friends many find themselves that way but god is still working with our imperfections and flaws he is still working on a building or praise god for he is building his building on a shore foundation the foundation is the perfection glory to god hallelujah amen god knows them that are his hallelujah and god knows what he wants to do with his own praise god you know how abraham lied moses got angry david with his flaws when you go over and see various ones through the bible but never mind their flaws god worked through them for his glory amen oh my glory to god my actual fact god sometimes used the flaws that you will look at criticize oh my and hide behind that even when jesus came the bible says there was nothing to be desired of him and god was hiding in the simplicity of that appearance that was not humanly attractive but only to those who had elected seed life of god within them praise god and god will work with that principle until the consummation of all ages working true flawed messengers of whom he'd said touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm amen god watches over his own and he knows them and he will judge them when they come to the end of the way i repeat this was an unfulfilled age or an age with spiritual deficiencies it was an age of reformation and that is the way god wanted it reformation praise god you remember if you don't remember then we can tell you about it when a corn of wheat is planted the first the the entire plant does not just push up through the ground and come up and and in one night the next day you have ripened fruit no it starts with a reformation from the seed life you see the blade as jesus said and then the air and then later on the full corn surrounded by the shock around that uh original seed that is in there praise god so everything forms beginning from the seed forming itself for another stage forming itself for another stage and forming itself for another stage and that's the way god unfolded his plane and his kingdom amen hallelujah because all my friends there were when we see a 1906 pentecost came during this laodicean age that was only the husk or the chaff to surround and protect the seed until it came to its fullness or maturity of growth its ripeness under the revelation of malachi 4 5 the hot shining gospel son of the message of this 20th century praise god hallelujah that a mighty angel came down and used an earthly messenger speaking through him for a period of time that we can get used to the fact that god still speaks through man and then he took the man out of the way and continued to work with his word now through a many membered bride body watching to see whether you will recognize him that he is the same one the son of man now being revealed in a bright form through his people but watch his nature watch his word watch his expressions watch his manifestation watch his works watch his revelation do you recognize him it's just the same when the lord jesus was on the earth the word made flesh or the word logos in flesh then he said must needs that i go away hallelujah so he left the scene visibly and came back down in the form of the holy ghost and now the holy ghost was not acting in one man but now the corn of wheat had come up now a thousand fold and more and now the holy ghost was manifesting through myriads of believers now can you recognize that is the same jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever by his nature by the opening of his word the way he acts that you will recognize that you will see that he is the same one using different veils but he remains the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah the turn of this 20th century we had great talk about how the holy ghost was falling and moving around the people and very soon people were speaking in tongues interpreting and claiming to be baptized with the holy ghost with the evidence of speaking in towns my friends that was really not the fullness of it all for in the restoration of the bride tree justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the holy spirit but now the baptism of the holy spirit makes way and must make way for the holy ghost himself glory to god the mighty covenant word angel of god himself making himself known in this day and in this hour thanks be to god hallelujah amen and that's where pentecost failed because pentecost 1906's through the street it failed because the organized the moment they organized they went back to their old mother instead of going back to the fullness of the world yes sir they failed and then their god just used them as a cover or as a sha a chaff to surround a shock to surround the genuine seed of god elected of god that was in their myths amen that was a dangerous period of deception because it deceived the people that there were that seed but the devil used remember this was an original manifestation of god but the devil knows how to pervert how to how to use that for his benefit so the genuine work of god he twists it and causes the people to believe that was the original uh seed and shirt bride church of god when it had not come to its fullness but yet was unfulfilled and unfulfilling it is fullness of what god's intents were within his heart so this chaff stage this stage called the the stage of the seed and the shock is a dangerous time it's a deceiving hour the devil uses it but thank god the promise was made in the by the prophet zechariah of the holy spirit at evening time when it begins to get dark and deceiving it shall be light again thank god the light has shone upon us thank god we are people that sat in denominational darkness we have seen a great light and a great light as of revelation has sprung up in the natural world in the form of a prophet and the form of the pillar of fire and in the spirit world in the form of the logos the opening of our hearts eyes that we might see the fullness of the word this pentecostal age some of the worst deceivers and deceptions that the world has ever seen because it's the closest to the genuine article of god and it becomes deceiving in the minds of the people it was just a carrier and a cover to bring that life over into this new precious age in which we are in so that a weak bride could be made manifested by the power of the spoken word glory to god where god speaks of it in ezekiel 47 2-5 how the holy spirit the rivers of waters of the opening of the world will so cover his people and he'll become so deep and so blessed until as the scripture says again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters that i could not pass over for the waters were risen waters to swim in in a river it was a river that could not be passed over yes my friends we will not understand it all down here even though we are receiving revelation for as paul said while we are in the flesh we see through a glass directly but then when we have cross over at the crossing then shall we know amen we will have the fullness of knowledge by the holy spirit dwelling within us glory be to god amen oh my hallelujah well the lutherans did have the holy ghost potentially amen like the oak tree is within the acorn potentially so the the lutherans had the holy ghost potentially the methodists who followed wesley they had the holy ghost potentially amen and that was under sanctification hallelujah and the pentecostals have the holy ghost also potentially they think they have the fullness but it was not the fullness it brought back the restoration of all things praise god so that god could restore his people and his church back to the original the word of pentecost 2-4 and further back right back to the word that was in the mind of god before the foundation of the world hallelujah or we run a journey praise god we're passing through time this world is not our home we're just passing through oh but i want to thank god that we did not come in this world just by chance where we come sealed to the day of our redemption he sealed you by your election knowing that the holy spirit will shepherd you to the day of when you become fully conscious of your redemption by him taking you out of here by his rapture in grace amen listen to the scriptures be watchful and straighten the things which remain that are ready to die hallelujah well you know to be truly watchful you can't be half asleep uh you have got to be awake you have got to be alert you have got to be aware of what is going on around you all the time hallelujah praise god when god says strengthen the things which remain everything around you is so shaky everything around you is so unsure everything around you is uncertain god is saying i want you to straighten your faith straighten all the the things that are in the church the truths the word that you are uncertain of straighten the things that remain i want you to give them a permanency i want you them to become solidified amen within your hearts and within your minds oh praise god hallelujah amen yes sir now listen here's an illustration you know that sardis means the escaped ones that is what sardis means the escaped ones hallelujah that you it's as if you were pursued by pursuers and everything you are gained was lost because the pursuers were so near they're about to catch you and god is saying listen hold on to what you have and run for your life and straighten that which remains now this god is referring to that back in sardis many times bandits would come off of the mountains that was around or near sardis and they were charged down upon the people and rob them of everything that they had and so god is using that thought to remind them what i have given you the riches of grace the riches of mercy the riches of the tresses of christ i want you to run with it so that you are not retaken you're not recaptured you're not spoiled the things that you have are not taken away from you whatsoever but that you could escape clean away and hold on to your freedoms and your liberties hallelujah but god is saying listen you i can see you are almost near back into captivity but see that you don't go back to that old captivity that you are in but keep going on and be alert and be awake and aware and watchful concerning the things uh surrounding your captivity are you going to lose it all and you're going to end up going backwards oh praise god a hallelujah amen but you know the age did not heed the voice of the spirit of god and god literally had to raise up another messenger whom we will touch upon him in the later age god had to raise up martin luther and bypass that lutheran denomination which is nothing but a watered-down delusion of catholicism and now my friends he went on to a new age to bring further truth that he might build towards the day a full restoration revelation 3 3 remember therefore how the west what that was received and heard and hold fast and repent therefore thou shalt not watch i will come unto thee as a thief and thou shalt not know the hour i will come unto thee amen hallelujah how wonderful to know that god had given them already the basic truths of the whole gospel the just shall live by faith and that salvation 100 is of the lord amen they had heard the truth of the bible out of the word of god which cast down all the doctrines of rome and proved them false and pagan and contrary to the word of god it set at not all papal authority they knew the truth the church does not save they understood that as it was revealed to them through the holy by the holy spirit through their messenger that the church does not and cannot and will never be able to save any individual or group of people wherever whoever they may be amen they understood also the lord's supper amen they understood that it was not any such a lie as transubstantiation that the bread becomes the literal flesh of jesus and the wine becomes back to the literal blood they knew that was not the truth they had the revelation of the true lord's supper that the bread only represented his body as the bread of life and the wine represented his blood as the quickening power of the holy spirit amen they had the light up given to them and go up by god on water baptism that it was not to be in these titles given there to them by rome of father son and holy ghost and beautiful wonderful motions movements and signs i baptize you in the name of the father son and holy goat and so on that will impress the people one name in the the name of the one who is the father is the son and is the holy ghost and peter said in acts 2 and his name is none other but the lord jesus christ amen they had this light and that's why they put out images out of their churches out of their lives and you will too if you see the fullness of the word you believe the church or you believe the word you believe the pope or you believe the prophet or believe the bible believe the truth of god's word let every man's word be a lie and let's god's word be the truth now and forevermore hallelujah praise god there were many men of that age who had the light of that day of that hour oh praise god they had enough light that they could have overhauled the entire system of that day kind of retrofit the entire whole thing over if they would let god lead them line by line precept upon precept here a little there a little amen they received the truth they wanted the truth that they had heard but how did they hear it amen it's how you hear the truth it's your attitude even now while you're listening to me it is your attitude with which you are using the motive with which were listening you see they were listening with the attitude that they could theorize they could debate they could discuss they could carry on and analyze the word of god amen they approach the word of god in a theological format of academically an academic approach to the word of god my friends hallelujah rather than the practical outworking of the holy spirit making known himself in and through you for his glory and honor now in the old days the guards of the temples if they were found sleeping on the job then they were beaten and their garments burnt and they were thrown out and god is saying you don't you if you don't hold to the word of god for your day and for your hour you'll be beaten with many stripes and cast out into all the darkness they'll be whipping and wailing and gnashing of teeth amen hallelujah and lastly i will come onto thee as a thief remember i told you about these bandits the bandits did not blow a trumpet telling you when they were coming but they just swooped down from the hillsides upon the people amen and they understood full well what the spirit of god was saying that there could be a sudden secret sweep coming of the lord upon the scene at any time oh my what a message for that for the false vine to know they can be caught in the act by the coming of the lord just as it was in the days of noah amen only eight were saved out of that generation my friends jesus himself said oh fear not little flock it is your father's good pleasure to give you the contact to to give you the kingdom amen and the world of the ungodly war swept away and it will be swept away again amen for every day there is daily contact with god's original seed who are constantly speaking the word of god and the people refuse to hear the word of god but you'll be judged by your reaction to the very word that you are hearing god doesn't ask you do you respect the man do you respect that woman that child that person that's speaking what he is looking at do you respect and believe his word that is flowing through his servant amen praise the god turn aside turn around my friends before it is too late turn around and face the truth carnal people selfish people arrogant people of the age turn around amen god is calling you from away from being just a nominal christian to being an active believer that holds firmly to the word of god and to the truth and for those of you who claim you believe the word you have heard from the messenger of this day strengthen the things which remain amen get out of your shaky weak uncertain condition are you in the whale's belly are you in those darkened conditions once again may the great holy spirit shine the light upon you that you will receive light in the evening time and be ready for his glorious and wonderful appearing may the lord jesus bless us all together as we think on these things and meditate on the rest that is to come may god bless us everyone in the name of our lord jesus christ amen [Music] you
