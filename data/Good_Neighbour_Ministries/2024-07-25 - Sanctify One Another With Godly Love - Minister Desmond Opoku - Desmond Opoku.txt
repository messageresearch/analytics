be your might in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen we're going to read Ephesians okay let get message Ephesians 5 21-33 Ephesians 5 21 to 33 submitting yourself one to another in the fear of God wives submit yourself unto your own husband as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church as he is the savior of the body therefore as the church subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husband in everything husband love your wife even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself and glorious church not having sport or wrinkle or any such thing but it should be holy holy and without brish so so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hate his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church as even as the Lord the church for we are members of the body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one fresh this is the great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless let everyone of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated Hallelujah my message is a is a is a a little straight my my subject is sanctify one another with Godly love sanctify one another with Godly love [Music] Hallelujah you know as we human being sometime is very difficult for us very difficult for us but we cannot bypass what is written in his word very difficult for us to sub submit ourself to one another or the husband Hallelujah it takes God to do that Hallelujah without submitting submitting or grow or giving up your will to the Lord you cannot be a Christian a good Christian you have to give all if you surrender you want to be a good Christian you have to give all you cannot re reserve some for yourself if you submit everything that means you cannot control yourself you cannot help yourself God is the one who is going to lead you but if you if you hold something back is tough Hallelujah so is it husband and wife Hallelujah even if was to if Eve Eve was given to Adam as his wife if you read Genesis chapter 2 21 I'm going to read a little bit for you tonight we going to talk about natural and spiritual because we have to live here once we are Christian there's a principles that God has given to us to live by you cannot go around it because we are representing Christ right now am if you want to see Christ who are you going to see you and me through the life that we live as Christians Hallelujah Genesis going to read Genesis 2 21 Genesis 2:21 to 24 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his raped and cross up and close up the flesh instead thereof and the rape which the Lord God has taken from him from man made he a woman and brought forth unto the man and Adam said this is now born of my bones and fresh of My Flesh He Shall be Called woman Adam name woman Hallelujah because she was taken out of a man he was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one fresh and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed why they were they were they didn't see because they were Veil they were Veil uh they will veil with with uh with the word of God they didn't know nothing they were veil with the word of God that time the fall wasn't set in hallelujah thank you Lord Lord just bear with me I'm laying the foundation we going to go going to go with it Hallelujah and when God make them they were coequal they were all one one fresh if you read Genesis 5 five today I'm going to read a little scriptures here because everything that we talk based on scriptures Hallelujah the scriptures is the word of God this is our pattern without the word of God we cannot move nowhere Hallelujah this is our life Hallelujah you take this from every Christian he's no more a Christian thank you Lord Genesis Genesis uh 5 1 and 2 this is the book of the generation of Adam in the day in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him male and female Ted he them and blessed them and called their name Adam so both of them were Co equal because Adam Eve was in Adam Hallelujah so they were all Co equal no more this and that hallelujah praise the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord how did Adam get into trouble I think everybody know how Adam get into trouble by who Adam get into trouble by who woman without woman we cannot live but at the same time there are fresh they are one praise the Lord how how did the church got into trouble by who woman the church because woman type the church Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord why why they get in trouble because God put this word that the day that you eat that tree of good and knowledge and Evil you shall surely die so the church right now they took what knowledge theolog uh what what do you call it intellectual and knowledge the same time is good at the same time it's evil and the church took that so God has to come down and separate the same way that he did he separate he separate the Eve from Adam hallelujah thank you Jesus if a woman refuse to submit herself to the husband is what trouble trouble in the house trouble in the home it doesn't mean that the man should doesn't mean that she should lay on the floor for the man to walk on her he is part of your body they have because Adam there's nowhere in the Bible where you heard that Adam hat his wife or he say something to her that hurt her they were in love Harmony so you have to love your wife no matter what circum sometimes comes your way you have to love your wife you know why excuse me because maybe the Lord want to drink a littleit water [Music] hallelujah thank you Lord no matter what happen you have to love your wife the wife has to love the husband because remember we are God's Property and God has given your wife as his property to take care of her the same time the woman God has given your husband to take care of him whatever you do unto one another one day you go into anything that okay this world here if I give my property to take care of you for me and I will come back I will come back and check it out how you how you treated the the property how how how how how it is whether it's good or bad we are going to account for one another you have to remember we are God property your wife is God property your husband is God property and you put on your hands so one day when we cross over you and your wife are going to meet the Lord himself and you are going to come account for one another how you treated her and how you treated him Hallelujah when we read the Bible he said what he said is born of your bone fresh of your fresh you know sometime the way we live our life at home affect our children as husband and wife you cannot just always curse here and bring good things here it cannot work for my understanding as a Christian you have to say good things to your children you have to say good things to your wife you have to say good things to your husband you know marriage is not something that you pick up it's something that you pick up God gave it to you it's two different characters are going to meet together no matter what the circumstance you're going to get ation somewhere somehow that's where God comes in because when you were married he said in love in death you would be with her Hallelujah my when a man is going to marry a woman they said the family the tradition they said If a woman get riches he bringing home if he get Adept he's going to the husband that's what they said you stick together no matter what circumstance comes your way you're going to leave back home when I was growing up the men they used to treat men differently when the woman doesn't listen they use their hand that's totally Rong but the woman will pack her bag and everything and run out go to the mother and father's home where their parents live the mommy and the father will ask them say no you has to go back to your husband when you B together marriage is not something that you're going to run away from it work it out you have to work it out Hallelujah no matter what situation comes you have to work it out how you are your appearance to your children or your grandchildren is very very important how you solve problem in front of your children is very import very very important why nowadays some of the children don't want to marry no more because some of them what they saw at home how they live together they get scared so they don't want to approach it but we Christian God has given us something special so we have to hold it tight and work it out because God Is Watching Over Us the same time he's watching his church Hallelujah you know when the church went chaos he sent the prophet to come and take the bride out from there Hallelujah so right now we are the bride you know back home when they not back home even here when the woman doing something they get something called s they just take take they put there they mix they blend something and they put in the water everything and the see and all the the the remaining stick inside there and they take the good part the water clean part that's what God has done for us he came down he he see all the the the church and now we are the good part there he put us here so we are the one who is going to stay with examples but example start from where home not only church Hallelujah the church is our Gathering Place hallelujah thank you Lord as I said you will never read anywhere Adam struck his wife or Eve struck his the husband but let me tell you in this morning age here where we are living now when people people can come in the church and sit down here clean clean clothes God bless you my brother God bless you my sister when they get home and let it count my brother and my sister you wish you can even get your ear to hear one thing we have to learn in the marriage is you don't compare somebody to your wife or to your husband he is good as he is she is good as she is that's why God joins you together it doesn't matter what a poor or Rich handsome whatever is you you belongs to one another stay close stay TI Satan always tried to set a trap for us not for out there for out there he know he got them we are the one Satan is trying to set trap every little thing that he going to get it so what I tell you is stay close to one another don't say bad things anything that is not good to one another and then you come you know why sometimes so many people so many Brethren their prayers they can't get answer for their prayers it's what they talk it's what they bring out there is a different story when they come to the meeting or in the church it's a different story you say you say another word over here and you said another word over here it's you don't know which one you talking about you curse here and you breast here it cannot work that's why I said today my message is strange we talking I'm talking to one another we are talking to one another because the the church start from home and we have to leave here and the life that we live is going to reflect what we claim to believe it's very very very important our children sometime why our children cannot stay here we Cur them you going to be this you going to be this and tomorrow you're going to turn around and say something good about it they say they see each and everyone is guilty I am guilty everybody's guilty Hallelujah because sometimes Satan come and struck us heart and we forgot we forget who we are and get overboard and these children when they growing up oh cuz as a child always when your daddy and your mommy say something sometime is stick in your mind and Satan love to bring that memory back all the time Hallelujah so it's very very important we we are getting old you see my belly my body was not like that was flat now it's clean but now I'm going you young people stay with the word of God you haven't got married yet you're going to get married and all these things has to be taught so that you can take lesson from what we went to you will never see since I've been in this message you will never see brother Simon will ever even Fellowship will talk about his children he always say good things about them how they they pressing did this did this let us say the same thing to our children stop saying negative things about our children children say good things to one another as a church so that we can grow one another as a church so that we can pray together with a cleansing heart so that God will come in and what and manifest himself Among Us each and everyone want to see God manifest himself Among Us right if you live right and nothing hinder there because what what Satan that every time you made a mistake even when you praying in the middle of prayer that thing comes down and it's hitting you he still confusing you if we live together in love we sanctify one another with love it doesn't matter who your children home your brother your sister Hallelujah remember when Moses make just one mistake and struck The Rock in the wilderness and God never forgave him God never forget God never forget everything that you do he never forget he know what he's doing he forgive if you go back and repent and carry on when you do something to one another whether your wife or your your your husband don't stay there say oh it's my husband or it's my wife so I'm not going to apologize or I'm not going to say sorry honey I'm sorry I made a mistake I did this and this there's nothing that's why I say is very hard for human being to submit thems to one another you know one time somebody told me he was sleeping in the middle of the night he wake up when he wake up his wife was curing him I do this I do do I was this I I wash your clothes I make and all kind of stuff so he pretend that he didn't hear nothing so in the morning or in the daytime in the evening the hus the wife Nice D she cooked for him the man came home he didn't talk he didn't want to eat the food the wife didn't know that when you was curing him you cursing your husband the same husband that you you beh him the the same husband that take care of you take care for your children in the middle of the night you cursing him it can happen to anybody by what anger unforgiving spirit and he cing him and the husband said last night I heard every word what you thought I was I don't know how I get up how you were curing me now cook a food for me to eat so how that thing going to work we take a lesson Satan can do anything if you if you give way Satan can do anything to destroy us because that's his motive he want to destroy us but thank God greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world this world here is real God give you a wife marvelous Fantastic live the life let the young man and young man see the sweetness in the marriage so that they can cve for it Hallelujah but nowadays they don't want it why they see enough fighting I believe people still fighting at homes they don't don't have patience the woman don't want to submit herself and the man think he is the head of the church head of home and really he is the head but little humble patient God will set things settle things down don't go overboard don't go stream let hey I love my marriage I love that I love I thank God that God gave me your wife she is my backone I have to take care of her sometime when I go out and I see a nice thing I buy for her but sometime the woman they don't like it when you instead of you to buy for her they don't they don't they don't like it you give her the money to buy whatever she want so go sometime I I see a nice sow shoe this this snow shoe going to fit my wife and nice for the snow you come back the snow shoe stay there stay there but I why is the snow shoe oh I Chang it oh I see you need the money to buy what you want we we men have to learn not one time we have to learn to give money to our wife for them to have their shopping Hallelujah let put a little sweetness honey let the honey be honey you call a honey but you don't know how to mix it the Honey with a bee Hallelujah mix them up let them be happy if the woman is happy at home you be happy no trouble glory to God they are wife the same thing at the church we have to stay together and worship the king we are his wife let us live Holiness and excitement for the gospel and the Salvation he has given unto us this is worth more than anything Hallelujah there's nothing that can compare what we are doing here right now you sitting in the peill and by the grace of God I standing here to share this little exultation with you is it not a blessing we could be somewhere hallelujah thank you Lord ah thank you Lord we have to find a way to live a life that can be Seer Seer that will show our children our grandchildren that this is the way God made made us God took that E from the man's side so that we can be one and what during the fall after the fall Eve you know Adam could could could could have leave God to kill the woman but she is the part of him so he took him he took all the blame say he's my wife I will never let her go and God admitt that said take it but there's conditions because he fail to listen the same apply to Sarah when Sarah lied before God God could have go God could have killed Sarah but he is part of Abraham to fulfill what God has planned so we cannot separate the woman from man we are one Hallelujah but there's a position that a woman should not go in the Bible praise God let me read a little bit in here uh first Timothy 2 first Timothy 2 11 to 15 let the let the woman Le in Silence with all subjection but I suffer not a woman to teach nor to user authority over man but to be in silence for Adam was first form than Eve and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in transgression not withstanding he shall be saved in childbearing if continue in faith and charity and Holiness with sobriety you know is very very hard from some some some wom some sisters sometime you tell them something because this is the church the church the woman would do something the sister will do something and you tell her she does not understand she still arguing you know church God Pastor deacons and trustees deacons are helping the pastor so that the load can be lighter so that he can work he can study better for to feed us but when they get overboard and you tell them they start arguing instead of them to submit to the word of God you know God has set the church God has set the church ah a regulation principles that the the congregation can use to be a blessing to them but some of them don't want to use it something happen the deacons will call you and then for the welfare for all the congregation you start to talk with them they get mad and sometime they go and they tell their husband then they they get mad they don't want to go to the church anymore he's not here but I'm just speaking Hallelujah submitting is very very very tough mostly for the sister because the woman they are high temper High temper it cannot Temperance is good but if the temperance is like a high the the blood is good but if it goes higher too high you have to take medicine to bring it down right high blood pressure you need a medicine to bring it down don't let the blood go so high before you take a medicine and then you you you lower it down we are working together because as a as a human when this hand get hurt the whole body get hurt so one affect the whole body affect and sometime you know you know sometime you you have to know who you listen sometime cuz sometime people leave go outside from the church and they listenting to other messages somewhere and then they get confused and they try to they try to bring it around the congregation and the pastor will look that and say no you cannot do this here he has to hold tight because if that effectivess of that disease comes to the church what he going to do the whole church get cont terminated then the pastor job going to be had to clean so the Deacon when the Deacon see something that is not right we have a right to protect the flocks in the church it doesn't matter who you are we're going to call you and let you know that we mean God business we will not stand and for something to happen first before it cause trouble no we have reached here now it's time to go home Joshua time there's no no no no if you don't go out we are going forward are we going forward yes we going forward we will protect the church the deacons the trustees the Elders of the church we will put our food down and protect the church hallelujah thank you Lord we thank God God has given us wonderful church we don't have nothing here but we are speaking we are speaking you don't know God knows what is going on Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah blessed be the name Lord if you disobey if you disobey God you going to pay for it don't think that anything you know people think before when God holding time when you do something God struck them dead and sa God struck him dead instantly people think God change God hases no change You Hinder your prayer you pray pray pray pray nothing that listening he will listen outside somebody the Buddhist or something there he will listen to them cuz sometime I pray for those people are Buddhist and all those and God hear their prayer one time a lady I I went to hospital to visit her and I pray for her and God heal her the following day and when she went home one night her daughter got her son got sick so bad he couldn't sleep he she he cry cry cry cry the girl doesn't know what to do they don't know then he get up he scream why is this one God when I was in the hospital she came and prayed for me and I slept like there's no tomorrow why is the this one godone desperation why he's screaming and going around and coming you didn't hear no no no more he turned around the boy sleeping desperation Buddhist this man this lady is a Buddhist desperation why he saw something real something real the gospel God has given to us something real it's not just talk we can talk but why is the ashing the same thing like when brother Braham was went to pray for somebody and the place was Darkness he said don't worry screaming screaming oh it's too dark that God he said God is here God said I want God in he said I want God in he say something like thatuh yeah he want God in King so we can we have to demonstrate the power that God has given to us and the times our own ashs home here here here block our prayers how many of you want God to use you how many each and everyone we want God to use us we' been staying here for long we want God In Action I want God In Action you want God In Action if you put our heart together something happen prayer meeting all night prayer meeting when we go to a prayer meeting on the line every day there's a testimony why God is moving you want to be part of that let's move hallelujah thank you Lord God has principles in the church and we are everything is for us if we humble ourself together I just read another another here Corinthians Corian 14 34 14 34 4 let your woman keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience as also said the Lord and if they will learn anything let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for a woman to be speak in the church what come and come no what came the word of God out from you from you or came it unto you only or came it unto you only if any man think himself to be a prophet or a spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandment of the Lord but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant wherefore Brethren convert to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues let all things be done decently and in order praise the Lord so all these things here is for ex example I'm not saying anything about anybody here I'm just speaking the word of God if you hear the word of God we the word the preaching is always repeating we have to talk about it talk about it so that it can sink inside of us so that we can live in harmony all these things here leading towards where to the rapture because we are preparing preparing ourself Hallelujah if we can't prepare here when are we going to prepare we be here too long so we have to prepare ourselves we've been here too long how many want to want to go home praise God hallelujah we could see look at the United States I believe there's a prophecy is about to fulfill BR prophecy is about to come to pass we are here right here right here we going we going so we have to prepare ourself sisters brothers Hallelujah love your wife sisters love your husband don't give them a little food and sometime you give them a little food and little food no because I want you to get I want you to
