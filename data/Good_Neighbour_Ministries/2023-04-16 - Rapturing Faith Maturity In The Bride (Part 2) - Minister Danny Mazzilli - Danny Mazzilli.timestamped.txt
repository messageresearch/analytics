[38:15] because he knows me because he's
[38:18] interested in fulfilling his purpose and
[38:21] his plan in each and every one of our
[38:22] lives do you believe that this morning
[38:25] if you believe that this morning then
[38:28] you can leave with something in you that
[38:30] will give you strength to overcome the
[38:33] challenges that you will face
[38:36] as a Son of God as a daughter of God As
[38:40] a Christian in this world and in this
[38:42] life right now amen praise God but the
[38:46] Lord is more than able
[38:48] he had prepared it all from before the
[38:51] foundations of the world
[38:52] and he's got a plan for us to get out
[38:55] and to make it out
[38:57] and there is no way
[39:00] that it ain't gonna happen amen it's
[39:03] going to happen
[39:04] amen praise God so just uh before you um
[39:10] sit down just a couple of quick
[39:11] announcements and then we'll go right to
[39:13] the word
[39:14] um
[39:15] first of all this week you know I got a
[39:18] call an individual was passing through
[39:21] by the name of Tony he didn't know us he
[39:24] doesn't know any of us he just had
[39:26] bought in a bunch of Bibles and decided
[39:28] that he wanted to give them away and he
[39:31] says uh you know I want to just give him
[39:33] to a church so he went online and he put
[39:35] Church in Burlington and guess what
[39:38] Good Neighbor Ministries came up and I
[39:40] said wow that's fantastic and and I said
[39:43] that is wonderful I said we'd love to uh
[39:46] you know receive those Bibles
[39:49] um
[39:50] what's going on and and he says well he
[39:53] says uh you know I just feel that I want
[39:56] to give he says what kind of a church
[39:57] are you I said well we're a Full Gospel
[40:00] Church we're similar to a continuation
[40:03] of the book of Acts if you look into the
[40:05] book of Acts you see what the church was
[40:07] back then then you can get an idea of
[40:10] who we are right now
[40:12] and so he says oh that's good he says
[40:14] because I'm coming out of the nomination
[40:16] I said oh well I said that's good
[40:20] I said you're certainly welcome to come
[40:22] and join us anytime he lives out in in
[40:26] Etobicoke I said you're welcome to come
[40:28] anytime and uh
[40:30] if if not you can tune in online and he
[40:34] says he'll do that so if Tony you've
[40:36] tuned in online on behalf of good
[40:38] neighbor Ministries we want to say thank
[40:40] you for the beautiful Bibles they're
[40:42] really nice Bibles they're going to go
[40:44] to people that need them
[40:46] so thank the Lord you know but God is
[40:49] doing something amen
[40:51] and that's what that's what I get out of

[40:55] and moving on hearts and lives and
[40:57] somehow supernaturally we're a part of
[41:00] his plan amen amen praise God and so the

[43:04] quotes we can bring
[43:06] words and intellectual man's
[43:09] interpretations and meanings but Lord

[43:52] will never fail but to give you all the
[43:54] praise the glory and the honor in Jesus
[43:58] name amen
[44:00] praise God let's put up the first slide
[44:05] we're continuing along
[44:08] with what we started here the last time
[44:10] we were here looking at rapturing Faith
[44:14] and maturity in specific in mature the
[44:18] maturity that's in the bride maturity in
[44:20] the bride a time in a season that the
[44:22] Bride Comes to understand her placing
[44:25] her position in the word of God what is
[44:28] expected of her and when I say her the
[44:31] bride I'm talking about Christians that
[44:33] are in the body of Christ the church the
[44:36] called out ones we need to understand
[44:38] that amen and so the first scripture
[44:42] that we read
[44:43] um
[44:45] from The Book of Romans chapter 1 verses
[44:47] 16 and 17 it says for I am not ashamed
[44:50] of the gospel of Christ for it is the
[44:53] power of God unto salvation to everyone
[44:56] that believeth to the Jew first and also
[45:00] to the Greek in other words the Jew the
[45:02] Gentile it's to anyone that can receive
[45:05] the word of God Amen
[45:07] for therein is the righteousness of God
[45:10] revealed from Faith to Faith as it is
[45:14] written the just shall live by faith the
[45:19] Amplified version says I am not ashamed
[45:21] of the gospel for it is the power of God
[45:23] for salvation for his wrath and
[45:26] Punishment to everyone who believes in
[45:29] Christ as Savior to the Jew first and
[45:33] also to the Greek for in the gospel the
[45:36] righteousness of God is revealed both
[45:39] springing from faith and leading to
[45:43] Faith disclosed in a way that awakens
[45:46] more faith
[45:49] as it is written and forever remains
[45:52] written the just and upright shall live
[45:56] by faith you may be seated
[45:59] praise God
[46:00] we're talking about rapturing faith you
[46:03] know and just to you know kind of recap
[46:06] from the last time that we were here
[46:08] rapturing faith is a is a a specific
[46:11] kind of faith and we've read here in the
[46:13] scripture that that God is adding to our
[46:17] faith God has always been adding to
[46:20] Faith when he started right from you
[46:23] know from uh you can go right back to
[46:26] Genesis okay where God revealed himself
[46:30] and came and revealed himself through
[46:32] Adam and then expressed Eve through Adam
[46:34] and and then expressed by Revelation to
[46:37] Abel what the you know what the
[46:39] acceptable sacrifice it was always God
[46:42] revealing his mind his purpose and his
[46:46] will for each and every dispensation
[46:50] revealing unto each of them what they
[46:53] were going to require in order to
[46:55] fulfill their time their season their
[46:59] part in the word of God
[47:00] and so
[47:02] coming down now we we've come to realize
[47:05] that there's a special kind of Faith
[47:07] that's being you know revealed to us
[47:10] right that and and that faith is called
[47:12] rapturing faith
[47:14] because in this hour it's going to
[47:16] require a supernatural Faith to change
[47:19] these bodies
[47:21] to translate us to fulfill the portion
[47:24] of the word that we have been given to
[47:27] fulfill and that is the rapture
[47:30] our departure is the next major event
[47:34] that is going to take place on this
[47:36] Earth
[47:37] we're not talking stories here we're not
[47:40] talking uh fables you know when we talk
[47:43] about the Rapture and when we talk about
[47:45] what God is going to do in this hour and
[47:47] how he's going to change this Mortal so
[47:51] that it can put on immortal
[47:53] okay this is what the scripture says
[47:56] about you and me
[47:59] we're going to be changed and we're
[48:01] going to be changed in a moment in the
[48:02] twinkling of an eye
[48:04] okay so there's been a a supernatural
[48:08] rapturing Faith that's been released in
[48:11] this day that is for a specific people
[48:15] all the other churches out there all the
[48:17] denominational churches and you know
[48:19] there's a lot of wonderful people in
[48:21] those churches we're not putting down
[48:23] the people but they've come under a
[48:26] system and any time that you come under
[48:28] a system you gotta realize that that
[48:31] system has been infiltrated by the enemy
[48:34] we're going to look at a scripture even
[48:36] now the next scripture we're going to
[48:38] look at that and we're going to see what
[48:40] it is that's been taking place and how
[48:43] the whole world is in a level of
[48:45] deception right now when it comes to the
[48:48] religious realms amen and that that that
[48:52] level of deception is something that
[48:55] that every single person will get caught
[48:58] under that
[49:00] accept those
[49:02] who have been predestinated
[49:05] whose names were in the Lamb's Book of
[49:08] Life
[49:09] from before the foundations of the world
[49:13] they cannot be deceived
[49:16] and the reason why they cannot be
[49:19] deceived is because they're receiving
[49:21] rapturing faith
[49:24] without rapturing faith you fall into
[49:28] the deception
[49:30] so let's look at now and let's go to the
[49:33] next scripture and we're going to
[49:34] continue this thought
[49:36] on maturity in the bride
[49:39] Matthew 13 verses 24 to 30 another
[49:43] Parable put he forth Jesus speaking unto
[49:46] them same the Kingdom of Heaven is
[49:49] likened unto a man which soweth good
[49:51] seed in his field
[49:53] but while men slept his enemy came and
[49:57] sold tares among the wheat and went his
[50:00] way
[50:01] now remember
[50:03] Christ Elohim the self-existent one had
[50:07] a plan from before the foundations of
[50:09] the world that he was going to bring
[50:11] forth his sons and daughters and redeem
[50:15] them
[50:15] it all started in the Garden of Eden and
[50:18] right here we can see right here we see
[50:22] that God set up a garden he put a man
[50:25] there
[50:26] and and and the enemy came to Eve came
[50:29] right to that garden and what did he do
[50:32] he started to sow seeds of discrepancy
[50:35] he started to put things into their
[50:38] minds and started to take and that's why
[50:40] denomination is not of God because
[50:43] they've got their own interpretations
[50:46] being infiltrated by the enemy that
[50:50] comes in and souls the tares puts in the
[50:53] lies tells the people that God is three
[50:57] and that he's three in one and that
[51:00] there's a trinity and there's no such
[51:03] scripture for that
[51:04] God is one the Lord God hear ye o Israel
[51:09] the Lord thy God is one one not two not
[51:13] three Jesus of the New Testament is
[51:16] Jehovah of the Old Testament
[51:19] Jesus means Jehovah savior all God did
[51:23] was create for himself a body so that he
[51:27] could dwell in that body so that he
[51:29] could be the ultimate sacrifice go to
[51:32] Calvary take our place for our sin as
[51:35] humans
[51:37] and bring us back to our position as
[51:40] attributes of God because this will not
[51:44] inherit the kingdom of God Amen that's
[51:47] why your mistakes and all your all your
[51:50] failures and you know I've got rapturing
[51:53] faith good news this morning this kind
[51:56] of faith that goes beyond your mistakes
[51:58] it goes beyond all your weaknesses it
[52:01] goes beyond your history it goes beyond
[52:03] your genealogy it goes beyond all the
[52:06] things that you thought that had a hold
[52:08] on your life you've been liberated by
[52:11] this rapturing Faith you've been placed
[52:13] into a realm where all things are
[52:15] possible now for your life
[52:18] those who I have called I have Justified
[52:21] you look up the word justification it
[52:24] means you never did it in the first
[52:26] place
[52:29] [Applause]
[52:31] but while men slept his enemy came and
[52:35] sold tares among the wheat
[52:37] and went his way but when the blade was
[52:40] sprung up and brought forth fruit then
[52:43] appeared the tears also
[52:46] so the Servants of the householder came
[52:48] and said unto him sir this not thou sow
[52:52] good seed in thy field
[52:54] from whence then hath it tears
[52:57] he said unto them an enemy hath done
[53:00] this
[53:01] we know
[53:03] what has deceived the people
[53:06] they're good people
[53:08] they're honest sincere people they read
[53:10] the same Bible that we read but these
[53:12] scriptures are here to bring out the
[53:15] understanding and the Lord himself was
[53:18] bringing Clarity and he says
[53:21] sir did not thou so good seed and I feel
[53:25] from Once then had deters he said unto
[53:27] them an enemy have done this the servant
[53:29] said unto him will thou then that we go
[53:32] and gather them up
[53:34] that's not our job
[53:38] but he said nay lest while ye gather up
[53:42] the tares ye root up also the wheat
[53:46] with them
[53:48] let now watch this is important let both
[53:51] grow together until the Harvest
[53:55] and in the time of harvest I will say to
[53:59] the Reapers who's going to say
[54:03] the Lord is going to say Gather ye
[54:05] together first the tares and bind them
[54:08] in bundles to burn them but gather the
[54:10] wheat into my barn
[54:14] now we know
[54:15] by understanding the message of this
[54:17] hour that God has sent a prophet in the
[54:21] 20th century it's hard to swallow for a
[54:23] lot of people
[54:26] but I challenge you to search the
[54:29] scriptures
[54:30] and see if in them it doesn't bring
[54:33] clearly
[54:35] what God required and what was necessary
[54:39] in order to bring us to this rapturing
[54:41] faith that we're preaching on this
[54:43] morning
[54:46] there were many he says I will send out
[54:48] the Reapers
[54:50] and there and you know God has sent out
[54:53] all the ministers
[54:55] all the ministers that are out there
[54:57] that are that are ministering the word
[54:59] of God they all come under
[55:01] the the call of God going Jesus says go
[55:04] ye into all the world and preach the
[55:06] gospel and so many are doing it and
[55:09] they're believing that they're doing it
[55:11] under the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[55:13] and they believe that that that you know
[55:16] that they have a message that is
[55:18] salvation and they do have a message of
[55:20] salvation
[55:21] but the message of Salvation that we're
[55:24] speaking on here this morning and the
[55:27] one that we've been called to just by
[55:29] the grace of God Saints you were not
[55:32] deserving of this kind of a calling
[55:34] there's nothing that you did in your in
[55:37] your human existence that you were so
[55:39] good that you deserve this kind of a
[55:41] calling because all of us can start to
[55:44] talk about our past and and bring up how
[55:46] God just by the grace of God I'm here
[55:49] today
[55:50] it's by the grace of God that we're all
[55:52] here today what it was a call of God
[55:55] because he saw his attributes his
[55:58] thoughts he had them he knew
[56:00] but he also saw that there was going to
[56:03] be a harvest and this Harvest that we're
[56:05] talking about is the Harvest of the
[56:08] Bride go to the next slide
[56:11] so we're looking at rapturing Faith
[56:14] we're looking at maturity listen here
[56:17] modern events made clear by prophecy now
[56:20] notice
[56:23] when we're talking about the seed now I
[56:25] want you to recognize and identify the
[56:29] seed as the attribute of God
[56:32] seed
[56:33] word
[56:35] attribute
[56:36] mind of God the word expressed
[56:41] when God saw you in his mind he
[56:44] expressed You by attribute
[56:47] into this Dimension at this time
[56:50] he's calling his seed attribute back to
[56:55] himself
[56:56] and it's going to happen in a harvest
[56:59] there's been many harvests but this is
[57:02] the Great Harvest at the end of the
[57:04] world
[57:06] notice he likened it to a grain of wheat
[57:09] the bride
[57:11] the reason that God had to let that go
[57:14] like that that fine real genuine church
[57:18] that was established on the day of
[57:20] Pentecost had grown and groaned since
[57:23] the day of Pentecost into a great church
[57:26] it had to fall into the Earth in that
[57:29] Dark Age and he buried like all seed
[57:33] does
[57:35] you got to see in here we are we're
[57:38] looking at the Reformation how God has
[57:41] brought us to the day that we're in
[57:43] right now and it all started right back
[57:45] there on the day of Pentecost when all
[57:49] those that had received the Holy Ghost
[57:50] started to go out and Minister the word
[57:53] of God and and because they were actual
[57:56] seeds of God that were that were
[57:58] anointed by the holy spirit amen it had
[58:02] to die so but but then it had to go
[58:03] through a stage and a process and this
[58:06] process you know we're just going to
[58:08] cover it here to lay in the foundation
[58:10] it's important for us to understand that
[58:12] there was a process that's bringing us
[58:14] to this level of maturity that we need
[58:17] to enter into as the seed attribute of
[58:20] God we are moving into a level of
[58:23] maturity that will produce a body change
[58:27] it had to die so it could come forth in
[58:30] the Reformation again
[58:32] so the word went down into the Dark Ages
[58:35] you can go back and read the history of
[58:37] what happened after Pentecost we went
[58:39] through the Dark Ages and all those that
[58:42] were that were seeds and attributes of
[58:44] God in that time in that season because
[58:47] there was harvests in each and every age
[58:50] they all had to fulfill their portion of
[58:54] the word those that were in the Dark
[58:56] Ages they had to produce death they had
[58:59] to go and be sacrificed but God gave
[59:01] them an anointing in order to produce
[59:04] that part of the word so they were they
[59:07] were they were ordained for that amen I
[59:11] want you to see what's what this is
[59:13] leading up to they were ordained For
[59:15] That season in that time they had to be
[59:18] buried they had to go down and from
[59:21] there just like a stalk of wheat coming
[59:23] up the first thing comes up is two
[59:26] little blades then it keeps adding more
[59:29] blades up come Martin Luther than
[59:32] swingly and on down Calvin and they
[59:36] moved on and go to the next slide
[59:39] finally it goes into a tassel now that
[59:42] was John Wesley okay we need to see
[59:45] Luther Wesley justification was Luther
[59:48] Wesley sanctification God is God is
[59:52] preparing the church God is bringing the
[59:55] church into its fullness God is ripening
[59:58] the church because there's going to be a
[1:00:00] great harvest and each one of them had
[1:00:03] to produce their part and then Wesley's
[1:00:05] age and it had a pollen drop back from
[1:00:08] there come the Pentecostal age
[1:00:10] Pentecostal age was so close just like
[1:00:13] the real grain of wheat
[1:00:15] the spirit of God was moving on the
[1:00:18] people
[1:00:18] they were speaking in tongues they were
[1:00:21] rejoicing around the word of God they
[1:00:24] believed that that was it that it was
[1:00:26] that that now was the coming of the Lord
[1:00:29] and that and that his second coming was
[1:00:31] right then right there everyone thought
[1:00:33] you know this is it the manifestation of
[1:00:36] the gifts but that's not it
[1:00:39] that's still not it this got to come to
[1:00:41] the fullness of the word
[1:00:43] Christ himself once again
[1:00:46] amen grain of wheat okay then uh but
[1:00:52] it's set there for a purpose
[1:00:55] to shelter the sorry from there come the
[1:00:58] Pentecostal age so close just like a
[1:01:00] real grain of wheat if you look at the
[1:01:03] stock but if you'll take that wheat and
[1:01:06] move it back there's not one grain in it
[1:01:09] at all it's only a shock
[1:01:12] and in the shape of a grain
[1:01:15] and that's kind of where we're you know
[1:01:18] we're at right now
[1:01:20] at the time in the season we're going to
[1:01:22] see it a little closer as we go on but
[1:01:25] it sat there for a purpose to shelter
[1:01:27] the grain
[1:01:29] to protect the elected of God
[1:01:34] to keep them in the hour of great
[1:01:37] deception because that's really
[1:01:40] deceiving you know like you can see you
[1:01:42] can look into a field and you can see
[1:01:44] the wheat and the stock and everything
[1:01:46] looking you know all the leaves are out
[1:01:48] and even the leaves are starting to die
[1:01:49] around it and everything else and you
[1:01:51] would think it's grain time it's time
[1:01:53] for to harvest the grain but it wasn't
[1:01:56] yet that was the Pentecostal age
[1:01:59] but now we've entered into the sea time
[1:02:02] the grain time the time where he takes
[1:02:05] his grain into the Garner where he's
[1:02:07] going to take his elect those that have
[1:02:10] those that he has seen from before the
[1:02:12] foundations of the world that have come
[1:02:14] into their position that have come into
[1:02:16] their placing that have recognized their
[1:02:19] calling amen this is not play Church
[1:02:22] saints this is not just join a church
[1:02:25] there's a lot of churches out there that
[1:02:27] you can go to this Sunday you can go to
[1:02:29] another one next Sunday you'll get
[1:02:31] different varieties of preachers you'll
[1:02:33] get all kinds of teachings of man you'll
[1:02:36] hear things that can be put together
[1:02:37] even better than I can put them together
[1:02:39] or even Pastor Simon or any other other
[1:02:42] ministers can put it together because
[1:02:44] they're doctors of divinity they know
[1:02:46] the Bible inside out they know the the
[1:02:48] the
[1:02:49] humanetics and hermeneutics and and all
[1:02:52] the the interpretations and the Greek
[1:02:54] and everything else my God you could
[1:02:56] spend years there's books that are like
[1:02:58] like a library full of interpretations
[1:03:01] of of the word of God but let me tell
[1:03:03] you there's one interpreter and that's
[1:03:06] the Holy Ghost and when the Holy Ghost
[1:03:08] comes in you it doesn't matter what you
[1:03:11] read it's the spirit of God interpreting
[1:03:14] that word right back to you all right
[1:03:17] don't tell me that it was some man that
[1:03:20] called you into this
[1:03:23] come on are you kidding me that you
[1:03:26] would that that you can still stand
[1:03:28] after so many years to still stand on
[1:03:31] this word no matter what comes your way
[1:03:33] no matter how hard it gets no matter
[1:03:35] what comes you listen you might get
[1:03:38] knocked down and many of us get knocked
[1:03:40] down and there's nothing wrong with
[1:03:41] getting knocked down by the way nothing
[1:03:44] wrong with it
[1:03:46] but I'm telling you there's something in
[1:03:48] you
[1:03:49] that raises you back up
[1:03:55] there is no way that you can stay down
[1:03:58] as a son or a daughter of God
[1:04:01] temporarily you might get put away you
[1:04:03] might get set aside you might need a
[1:04:06] rest God knows what you have need of
[1:04:08] but if there's an attribute of God in
[1:04:10] there and that's what we're talking
[1:04:12] about today we're not talking about
[1:04:13] churchianity we're not talking about oh
[1:04:16] you know Salvation and Jesus is your
[1:04:19] savior yeah that's all the truth
[1:04:20] everybody's claiming that you can go
[1:04:22] right downtown Hamilton right now and
[1:04:24] you'll see some guy that's you know
[1:04:26] probably high from the night before and
[1:04:28] preaching Jesus with a sign saying God
[1:04:31] bless you God bless you why God bless
[1:04:34] you so you can bless me
[1:04:37] and there's nothing wrong with blessing
[1:04:39] them don't get me wrong it's good the
[1:04:41] poor will be with us always
[1:04:45] that's just the dimension that we're
[1:04:47] living in that's part of the existence
[1:04:49] here it's the Paradox Saints
[1:04:52] you listen
[1:04:53] we we must experience it as Sons and
[1:04:56] Daughters of God that have been
[1:04:57] enlightened to the word you drive down
[1:04:59] the street you see things you see people
[1:05:02] begging you see hungry you see the sick
[1:05:05] you see The Afflicted you see the
[1:05:08] mentally oppressed it's a reality it's
[1:05:11] taking place but it's a paradox because
[1:05:13] you're seeing it all because you're
[1:05:16] awake
[1:05:17] you're awake
[1:05:19] God God just awoken you by the grace of
[1:05:23] God
[1:05:24] you didn't deserve to be awakened but
[1:05:26] you were ordained to be awakened and you
[1:05:29] can't help us say Amen to this word amen
[1:05:32] then all the life leaves the shock as it
[1:05:36] left the stock left the pollen leaves
[1:05:38] the shock and goes into the wheat and
[1:05:41] forms again just like it was down in the
[1:05:44] ground God is showing the process that
[1:05:47] the word that he sent forth from the
[1:05:50] beginning
[1:05:51] shall not return unto him void
[1:05:55] that which he has sent it forth to
[1:05:57] accomplish it will accomplish whatever
[1:06:01] is in your life that needs to be dealt
[1:06:04] with that needs to be uh
[1:06:08] put to death
[1:06:10] we die daily the Bible says
[1:06:13] we're going to be looking at some things
[1:06:16] whatever is needed God is going to do it
[1:06:19] you know Jesus here
[1:06:23] gives the interpretation of the parable
[1:06:26] and I want you to notice he says here
[1:06:29] in verse 37 he says and he answered and
[1:06:32] said unto them he that soweth the good
[1:06:34] seed is the son of man
[1:06:37] now I want you to recognize here
[1:06:40] why it's so important
[1:06:43] for God to sow his seed
[1:06:47] in
[1:06:48] his season
[1:06:51] there's a portion of seed
[1:06:53] that God needed to
[1:06:56] sow
[1:06:58] in
[1:07:00] this dispensation that we're under
[1:07:03] this 20 21st 20th and 21st
[1:07:07] Century dispensation
[1:07:09] there was a portion of seed that needed
[1:07:12] to be sown
[1:07:13] he says the good seed is the son of man
[1:07:16] and we know that it's always been Jesus
[1:07:18] Christ
[1:07:19] Jesus Christ is the son of man
[1:07:22] he was Elohim in the beginning
[1:07:26] it was Jesus the self-existent one Jesus
[1:07:30] is a name that he gave to himself while
[1:07:32] he was here on Earth but before he was
[1:07:35] called Jesus he was the self-existent
[1:07:37] one he was Elohim he was God he was the
[1:07:41] one that the Bible says by the word of
[1:07:44] God was the worlds framed by the word of
[1:07:48] God was everything created everything
[1:07:51] exists and consists by the word of God
[1:07:55] that's why when you're talking to people
[1:07:57] out there and they're saying oh the
[1:07:59] universe we don't believe in Jesus
[1:08:01] but we believe in the universe
[1:08:04] we believe in the in the in in the in
[1:08:07] the
[1:08:08] the life of of
[1:08:11] the universe and that we are part of
[1:08:13] that universe and that we are one with
[1:08:17] that universe and that we can be and and
[1:08:21] do anything that we want because we can
[1:08:24] call by speaking and visualizing
[1:08:27] everything now they've they're they're
[1:08:30] touching on Truth there
[1:08:32] they're actually touching on a lot of
[1:08:34] Truth
[1:08:35] but within there there's there's the
[1:08:37] perversion
[1:08:38] of leaving out the absolute
[1:08:41] which is Christ the self-existent one
[1:08:44] the the creator of Heaven and Earth
[1:08:49] and everything that was ever created
[1:08:51] and they'll just go and say no but we
[1:08:54] can be that
[1:08:56] we can do I've I've heard people say we
[1:08:58] can do whatever we want I said so what
[1:09:00] it's okay to steal cheat lie yes this
[1:09:04] they said if you're doing it and not
[1:09:07] harming anybody and you know it's
[1:09:10] and I thought wow really
[1:09:13] I said that's interesting
[1:09:15] you see they don't understand the law of
[1:09:19] God's word
[1:09:20] that it has a law behind it which is
[1:09:23] sowing and reaping
[1:09:25] and that's why God had to sow his word
[1:09:30] the son of man
[1:09:32] coming through a son of man in our 20th
[1:09:36] century to bring forth and sow a word
[1:09:40] that was going to fit you and call you
[1:09:44] and position you and bring you into
[1:09:49] maturity
[1:09:51] for one purpose the rapture
[1:09:55] so here now when we look
[1:09:57] he says here the field is the world
[1:10:00] the good seed are the children of the
[1:10:03] Kingdom
[1:10:05] but the tares are the children of the
[1:10:07] wicked one who was the Wicked one it was
[1:10:10] the darkness it was
[1:10:13] the evil one it was Satan the Fallen
[1:10:16] Angel all part of God's Plan of
[1:10:19] Redemption remember he was actually
[1:10:21] created for that purpose
[1:10:25] you know that's the Paradox Saints
[1:10:28] you know you can talk to people and I've
[1:10:29] said this before you can talk to people
[1:10:31] about the Earth's 200 million 500
[1:10:33] million a billion years old
[1:10:35] it's so irrelevant
[1:10:38] because the Bible says in the beginning
[1:10:40] Elohim in the beginning God the
[1:10:44] self-existent one
[1:10:46] that beginning to God has no
[1:10:49] significance
[1:10:51] it only becomes significant to the human
[1:10:53] mind because we think in time
[1:10:56] we think in time so it's one of the
[1:10:59] weaknesses of Being Human
[1:11:02] you've got to see the Paradox here
[1:11:04] God could have been a trillion years on
[1:11:07] this Earth and there could have been
[1:11:08] other worlds before this world
[1:11:12] the Bible says the world's plural were
[1:11:16] framed by the word of God
[1:11:18] but what has it got to do with your
[1:11:20] world you see this is where you got to
[1:11:22] tune into your world your plan your
[1:11:26] purpose why you're here on Earth
[1:11:30] Hallelujah he says here the enemy that
[1:11:33] sowed them is the devil he sold the
[1:11:36] tariffs the Harvest is the end of the
[1:11:39] world and the reapers are the Angels
[1:11:42] so God is is using
[1:11:45] this aspect of preaching the word using
[1:11:49] the process that Faith cometh by hearing
[1:11:53] and by hearing the word of God because
[1:11:56] we're in a world of human existence
[1:12:00] and yet we are attributes of God because
[1:12:03] you're made up of soul body
[1:12:07] attribute
[1:12:08] okay you've got a body you've got a
[1:12:10] spirit but then in there is the
[1:12:12] attribute it's like it's like the stock
[1:12:14] right you know the stock is the body
[1:12:17] and then the shuck is like the spirit
[1:12:20] and then the grain the seed that's what
[1:12:23] we're talking about here it's the
[1:12:24] attribute of God
[1:12:26] so you are an attribute in
[1:12:30] an eternal attribute
[1:12:32] having No Beginning No End that's the
[1:12:35] Paradox of being a Son of God but yet
[1:12:38] you're in a human realm so we need to
[1:12:40] come back to earth
[1:12:42] and deal with the plan as God has laid
[1:12:47] it out for us
[1:12:49] so here now
[1:12:51] we need to understand Harvest look at
[1:12:54] Harvest harvest the season when crops
[1:12:57] are gathered
[1:12:58] the Gathering of a crop a ripe crop
[1:13:02] as of a grain or fruit the quantity of a
[1:13:06] crop gathered in a single season
[1:13:09] so there's a harvest in every age
[1:13:12] God has a harvest at the end of the
[1:13:15] world and that Harvest is that we're
[1:13:18] talking about and that we're that we're
[1:13:20] looking to is our Harvest
[1:13:22] our time of maturity you can't listen
[1:13:25] Harvest you can't Harvest without
[1:13:28] something being mature they go and they
[1:13:30] pick the peaches and the cherries
[1:13:32] because they're ready for Harvest
[1:13:34] they've come into a level of maturity
[1:13:36] they've come into a place where they can
[1:13:39] be picked where they can be gathered and
[1:13:41] brought into the see God used all these
[1:13:44] parables in order to you know to to show
[1:13:48] us his process and and God hides himself
[1:13:51] in simplicity
[1:13:53] and that's why he made it so simple for
[1:13:55] the children of God this is simple what
[1:13:57] we're talking about here God is
[1:13:59] harvesting a mature bride a mature
[1:14:03] Church
[1:14:04] so now how will we know that the Harvest
[1:14:07] is at hand
[1:14:08] by recognizing that individuals are
[1:14:11] recognizing who they are
[1:14:14] according to the word for this season
[1:14:18] we start to see
[1:14:20] first of all we need to recognize that
[1:14:22] brother Branham
[1:14:25] was a son of man revealing the son of
[1:14:29] man
[1:14:30] he had come into His maturity
[1:14:33] he had come to his place where God had
[1:14:37] taken him through his whole Ministry to
[1:14:39] the very point of his Epiphany which was
[1:14:42] the opening of The Seven Seals where he
[1:14:45] would would uh
[1:14:48] cross a new dispensation where he would
[1:14:51] go off the scene so that Christ could
[1:14:52] come on the scene remember it's always
[1:14:55] going to be Christ it's always going to
[1:14:58] be the son of man the son is what ripens
[1:15:02] the the grain it's Christ in you it's
[1:15:06] Christ speaking to you it's Christ
[1:15:08] revealing to you making his word known
[1:15:11] to you telling you who you are where you
[1:15:14] came from and where you're going that is
[1:15:17] the Awakening and the maturing of the
[1:15:20] seed
[1:15:21] as you're saying Amen to that as you're
[1:15:24] recognizing that you're not just a
[1:15:26] Christian so-called quote-unquote that
[1:15:29] belongs to a church but you're actually
[1:15:31] the green you're the you're the
[1:15:33] attribute you're the bride you're the
[1:15:35] seed of God you're the one that's going
[1:15:37] to be changed in this last day
[1:15:40] but the next uh slide says fruit cannot
[1:15:44] ripen unless the sun ripens it
[1:15:47] you are going to have to
[1:15:50] identify yourself with Jesus Christ
[1:15:54] he's the only one that can ripen
[1:15:57] and bring into manifestation what's in
[1:16:01] the seed
[1:16:03] because remember their seeds
[1:16:06] of God and then there's weed seeds
[1:16:09] brother Branham called them seeds of
[1:16:11] discrepancy
[1:16:13] they're coming forth they're manifesting
[1:16:17] they're showing themselves like their
[1:16:20] bride like they're the Church the true
[1:16:22] church
[1:16:23] but yet when the pure word of God comes
[1:16:26] to them
[1:16:27] and and identifies them in the word of
[1:16:31] God
[1:16:32] it's either identifying them as an
[1:16:34] attribute of God or they reject the word
[1:16:37] and identifies them as a terror
[1:16:41] it's just as simple as that
[1:16:43] so when you're you know like you could
[1:16:45] talk to a lot of people and oh I'm a
[1:16:47] Christian I'd go to church I go to
[1:16:49] church every day people have Catholics
[1:16:51] you know they go to church every day
[1:16:53] but then when the Holy Spirit
[1:16:56] shines his light remember it takes the
[1:16:59] the the sun to ripen and to bring into
[1:17:02] manifestation what's really there when
[1:17:05] the light starts to shine upon that seed
[1:17:07] it either says Amen to the word of God
[1:17:10] or rejects it
[1:17:12] if it rejects the word if it questions
[1:17:15] the word if it starts now I'm not
[1:17:18] talking questioning in a way I'm talking
[1:17:20] you know that sarcastic questioning
[1:17:22] you know where they they have their they
[1:17:24] have their their own agenda in the back
[1:17:26] of their mind and they're questioning
[1:17:28] you and questioning the word and oh but
[1:17:30] you know what about this did you
[1:17:32] consider that and you know they they
[1:17:35] don't you know they don't want to just
[1:17:37] keep it simple and allow the word to be
[1:17:41] the interpretation
[1:17:43] because remember if the spirit of Christ
[1:17:46] Jesus said I'll send you the comforter
[1:17:49] which is the Holy Ghost
[1:17:51] and he will guide you into all truth
[1:17:55] so you cannot deny this word no matter
[1:17:59] how much you preach whatever you do it
[1:18:02] cannot be ripened it cannot be
[1:18:04] manifested it cannot be Vindicated only
[1:18:07] by him who said I am the light of the
[1:18:10] world
[1:18:11] and he is the word
[1:18:13] and when the word is a flashed over you
[1:18:18] as a son or a daughter of God and
[1:18:20] there's an attribute in there it's has
[1:18:23] to respond
[1:18:25] you can't help it you you you're you're
[1:18:27] gonna hear this message you're going to
[1:18:29] recognize what God has done you're going
[1:18:31] to see that God sent the prophet you're
[1:18:34] going to recognize that he was a wave
[1:18:35] chief that he was one that came into
[1:18:38] full maturity that that identified Jesus
[1:18:41] Christ not the man but identified the
[1:18:44] Fulfillment of the word in the man he
[1:18:47] fulfilled Malachi 4 5. he fulfilled
[1:18:50] Revelations 10 7. he fulfilled being the
[1:18:54] angel that was on the earth that was
[1:18:56] gonna that was gonna be the voice of God
[1:18:59] not God the voice of God he was going to
[1:19:04] speak and and be rep and and it would be
[1:19:07] representing the voice of God it would
[1:19:09] be the actual literal voice of God and
[1:19:13] that's what's happening even now
[1:19:15] this rapturing faith that that I'm
[1:19:18] feeding on and that you're feeding on
[1:19:20] it's it's it's the Deep call to the Deep
[1:19:23] it's it's it's right now communicating
[1:19:25] with you it's it's moving through the
[1:19:27] aisles it's going into your hearts and
[1:19:30] into your lives it's it's Discerning
[1:19:32] your heart it's it's showing you certain
[1:19:34] aspects of your life where God was real
[1:19:37] where he supernaturally did certain
[1:19:39] things for you and you couldn't deny it
[1:19:42] you knew that it was a supernatural
[1:19:44] experience it wasn't just some altar
[1:19:47] call
[1:19:50] so there has to come forth a power the
[1:19:53] Holy Spirit himself to ripen or to
[1:19:57] vindicate or to prove or to make
[1:19:59] manifested that what he's predicted
[1:20:03] would happen in this day
[1:20:07] the evening light produces that
[1:20:11] Hallelujah glory to God this is our time
[1:20:15] this is the end time this is the Harvest
[1:20:18] Time
[1:20:19] this is the time where we come into
[1:20:21] maturity amen rapturing faith is being
[1:20:24] released through the word right now as
[1:20:27] we're ministering the word of God
[1:20:29] there's a supernatural Faith that's
[1:20:31] seeking out attributes of God wherever
[1:20:34] they are I don't have to put an
[1:20:37] interpretation on it God is his own
[1:20:39] interpreter when you listen to the word
[1:20:41] of God you're gonna you're gonna hear an
[1:20:44] uncertain sound you're going to hear the
[1:20:46] unwritten part of the word of God it's
[1:20:48] like a wife and a husband when the
[1:20:50] husband sends his wife a love letter and
[1:20:52] he writes about certain times certain
[1:20:54] places certain experience she knows
[1:20:57] exactly what he's saying
[1:21:00] she's been there she's experienced and
[1:21:03] you were in Christ before you came to
[1:21:05] this world to Manifest this human
[1:21:09] this human
[1:21:11] body of mistakes
[1:21:15] that's what we are
[1:21:18] there's no perfection in in this
[1:21:24] it's the attribute of God that's what
[1:21:26] makes us different that's what
[1:21:28] identifies us with the word with the
[1:21:31] pure word of God Amen praise God
[1:21:33] everything that the Lord did in brother
[1:21:36] branham's Ministry
[1:21:38] I want you to know that he's going to
[1:21:40] repeat it in your ministry
[1:21:42] he's going to bring you into a level of
[1:21:44] maturity just like he brought him to
[1:21:46] that place where he could stand and know
[1:21:49] who he was
[1:21:50] until you come to a place where you can
[1:21:53] stand and know that you are a part of
[1:21:57] this church I'm not talking about Good
[1:21:59] Neighbor Ministries I'm talking about
[1:22:01] the mystical body of Jesus Christ
[1:22:04] you're identified with Christ you're
[1:22:07] identified with the word you've
[1:22:09] recognized what God is doing in this
[1:22:11] hour you realize that it's not going to
[1:22:14] be by your own intellect that you're
[1:22:16] going to overcome you've come to an
[1:22:18] understanding that greater is he that is
[1:22:20] in you than he that is in the world
[1:22:23] you're not going to stay in a defeated
[1:22:25] condition bride you need to wake up this
[1:22:28] morning the rain is falling on us this
[1:22:31] morning it's bringing Harvest rain so
[1:22:34] that you can come out of your shell you
[1:22:36] can come out of your weakness come out
[1:22:39] of your unbelief and and and the things
[1:22:42] that that sold so many times want to hit
[1:22:44] you over the head sickness wants to hit
[1:22:47] you over the head financial problems
[1:22:49] they want to hit you over the head
[1:22:51] relationship issues want to hit you over
[1:22:53] the head but I want you to know that
[1:22:56] there's something greater in you this
[1:22:58] morning that has already overcome
[1:23:01] that has already provided
[1:23:06] has already made a way everything that
[1:23:08] the Lord did in in that's why when you
[1:23:11] go back you know listen Saints I was
[1:23:14] listening to the Prophet this morning
[1:23:16] and he was talking about
[1:23:20] a woman
[1:23:21] that
[1:23:23] came into the prayer line and he was
[1:23:25] just talking like the woman and he's
[1:23:26] saying you know like maybe she's you can
[1:23:28] go listen to it in the seat of of of
[1:23:30] discrepancy and and brother branham's
[1:23:33] talking and he says well maybe I don't
[1:23:35] know this woman I don't know who she is
[1:23:36] maybe she's you know like the one like
[1:23:38] Jesus had to go to Samaria one day and
[1:23:40] he had to go and see a woman and maybe
[1:23:42] she's like that or maybe not but you
[1:23:44] know he was just talking and talking in
[1:23:46] all of a sudden I'm going through my
[1:23:48] whole experience with the Lord and he
[1:23:51] just kept going and I'm I'm just I'm
[1:23:53] just like feeding I'm driving and I'm
[1:23:55] feeding and I'm feeding this is early in
[1:23:57] the morning and that's when I can just
[1:23:58] absorb and I cut I got caught up into
[1:24:02] this world where where my whole world I
[1:24:05] was experiencing the reality of what he
[1:24:07] was speaking and then he starts to go
[1:24:09] and he says and there's another woman
[1:24:11] here and she's in the prayer line she
[1:24:13] was given a card and I don't know her
[1:24:15] man do I know you ma'am no I don't know
[1:24:17] you now he's talking to her and he's
[1:24:20] he's waiting on the Lord because the
[1:24:22] Lord is going to do something for that
[1:24:24] woman
[1:24:25] so I don't know why you've come here and
[1:24:27] I don't know what it is that you have
[1:24:28] need of but here he keeps talking and
[1:24:30] then he says and all of a sudden he says
[1:24:31] to her he says you want to have a child
[1:24:36] you've been and you're you know you're
[1:24:37] you're just around 40 and and you know
[1:24:40] there's been others in this ministry you
[1:24:42] know that that this just the other day
[1:24:44] he's talking he says I picked up a
[1:24:46] little girl and you know she was you
[1:24:48] know her mother came into the prayer
[1:24:49] line and she was seeking the Lord to
[1:24:51] have a baby and God you know graciously
[1:24:54] granted her and I picked up that
[1:24:56] beautiful little girl she's a spoken
[1:24:58] word child
[1:25:00] and I'm going through this whole thing
[1:25:02] and I'm I'm right in the midst of this
[1:25:04] whole thing and I'm saying Lord
[1:25:07] I had that experience
[1:25:09] you're the same God you're the same one
[1:25:11] it was it was it was 23 years 24 years
[1:25:14] or 28 years because my wife and I we
[1:25:17] wanted to have another child after our
[1:25:20] second child I had gotten a vasectomy I
[1:25:22] decided that I would you know at the
[1:25:24] time I didn't know the Lord I said you
[1:25:26] know though no more children we had a
[1:25:28] lot of trouble you know with with
[1:25:29] Michael he was colic and you know I made
[1:25:32] it tough on my wife and you know when
[1:25:33] you don't know the Lord everything's
[1:25:36] tough
[1:25:37] everything's hard nothing's easy amen oh
[1:25:42] my goodness but you know what when the
[1:25:44] Lord came into our lives all of a sudden
[1:25:45] there was a desire there was life
[1:25:48] because God is a giver of life and all
[1:25:51] of a sudden the desire came on my wife
[1:25:52] came on me we wanted to have another
[1:25:54] child we prayed we believed we wept and
[1:25:57] we cried I went and got a reverse all of
[1:25:59] the vasectomy done I went two weeks of
[1:26:01] Hell amen and then the doctor tells me
[1:26:05] sorry it didn't work
[1:26:07] he says if you want us to redo it again
[1:26:09] for you week I said no no no no no
[1:26:11] and I stood and I looked I said Dr
[1:26:13] Sheldon I said
[1:26:15] I'm going to tell you a story and this
[1:26:16] is what I said to him I said there was a
[1:26:18] man in the Bible by the name of Abraham
[1:26:21] I said God gave him a child
[1:26:24] because God ordained to give him a child
[1:26:27] and there was nothing that could stop
[1:26:29] and I said and if God wants to give me a
[1:26:31] child
[1:26:33] it's easy for God your part is done I'm
[1:26:37] done see you later
[1:26:41] it wasn't until
[1:26:44] four years later
[1:26:48] In God's Time
[1:26:52] and the Holy Spirit spoke through our
[1:26:54] pastor in a prayer line because my wife
[1:26:57] had a desire
[1:26:59] not now four years later but four years
[1:27:02] before while we're going through that
[1:27:04] turmoil and Pastor Simon ministered and
[1:27:07] preached and and and prayed over my wife
[1:27:10] and prayed over us for that desire and
[1:27:13] God had a time and a season and then we
[1:27:16] had moved and we'd gone to a house and
[1:27:18] we just moved into a house on Applebee
[1:27:19] line we're just gonna move into it and I
[1:27:22] brought Pastor Simon to go and see that
[1:27:24] home
[1:27:27] he walked into the house
[1:27:29] and he's looking now we didn't have the
[1:27:32] child yet
[1:27:33] she wasn't even conceived yet
[1:27:36] he walks into the house and he starts
[1:27:37] walking around he says
[1:27:39] where's the baby's bedroom
[1:27:43] and my wife and I looked at him and we
[1:27:45] said
[1:27:46] which baby
[1:27:51] well guess who came a year later
[1:27:55] you see when God wants to do something
[1:27:58] he'll do it
[1:28:00] there is nothing too difficult for the
[1:28:03] Lord
[1:28:07] what's my point here there's two points
[1:28:10] here
[1:28:11] God was vindicating that he was sending
[1:28:14] a wave chief that was going to speak a
[1:28:17] son of man that was going to reveal the
[1:28:20] son of man and speak the word that there
[1:28:23] was going to be a church that was going
[1:28:25] to be harvested in the end time
[1:28:29] and when God came and Vindicated it
[1:28:31] through that Prophet it came to pass and
[1:28:35] here we are today
[1:28:37] and the other point was that God is a
[1:28:39] supernatural God and this call on your
[1:28:42] life is not some just ordinary
[1:28:45] invitation to come to church and be a
[1:28:48] part of a church
[1:28:50] if you're not an attribute of God I'm
[1:28:52] just sorry to say it
[1:28:54] you're not going to be able to stay
[1:28:57] the full course
[1:28:59] and take that flight into Glory
[1:29:02] that's not by my choice that's not by
[1:29:05] your choice that's all because of the
[1:29:07] plan of God and what he established from
[1:29:10] before the foundations of the world
[1:29:14] Hallelujah glory to God Amen
[1:29:18] so what is it now it's laying in the
[1:29:21] presence of the Sun and that will ripen
[1:29:23] us to the level of maturity required to
[1:29:26] take the Rapture which is the Harvest in
[1:29:29] this time remember Saints this is his
[1:29:32] Harvest
[1:29:33] of his attributes in his time
[1:29:38] it's got nothing to do with our timing
[1:29:40] our uh decision you know people say oh I
[1:29:44] made a decision I came to the Altar and
[1:29:46] I gave my life to the Lord
[1:29:48] no I give him the real interpretation
[1:29:52] God called you
[1:29:55] and it was your time to come to the
[1:29:57] altar to be awakened to who you've
[1:30:01] always been
[1:30:03] because you are a son of God or a
[1:30:07] daughter of God the Bible says whose
[1:30:10] names were written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:30:12] Life before the foundations of the world
[1:30:15] you don't just become a son or a
[1:30:18] daughter of God by making a confession
[1:30:19] like the like a lot of people say
[1:30:21] they'll just tell you listen just
[1:30:23] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord that's
[1:30:25] it
[1:30:26] just confess it
[1:30:27] okay I confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[1:30:31] you got a light
[1:30:34] you want to go smoke a doobie
[1:30:39] no I'm not making fun here
[1:30:42] but I'm talking about the reality
[1:30:44] because the
[1:30:46] spirit of God is a Holy Spirit
[1:30:51] now I'm not also saying holier than thou
[1:30:54] you can't be holy
[1:30:56] don't try to put on any holiness
[1:31:00] you know it looks it looks funny when
[1:31:03] people try to put on holiness
[1:31:05] okay
[1:31:07] it's when Christ is in you and Christ
[1:31:10] does things that are like simple
[1:31:13] almost
[1:31:14] unnoticeable
[1:31:16] but yet it's the Holy Ghost doing it
[1:31:19] because it's vindicating his own word
[1:31:22] it's it's bringing his own word into
[1:31:24] manifestation bringing it to life in
[1:31:27] your life
[1:31:28] Hallelujah we don't put on
[1:31:31] holiness
[1:31:33] and this is not a choosing but this is
[1:31:37] not your choosing this is God's
[1:31:41] foreknowledge God could see you know a
[1:31:43] lot of people say oh so what God decide
[1:31:45] to choose him not choose her choose him
[1:31:48] no God could see down through time
[1:31:52] because remember God is eternal he could
[1:31:55] see that when the word was going to come
[1:31:57] to you when he was going to speak to you
[1:32:00] that you were just like the woman at the
[1:32:02] well something was going to cut your
[1:32:05] attention something was going to make
[1:32:07] you say wait a minute
[1:32:08] something something what did you say
[1:32:12] what did you say you just did you just
[1:32:15] say that I got five husbands yeah and
[1:32:17] the one you're with right now isn't even
[1:32:19] yours Hallelujah this is the Messiah
[1:32:22] this is the reality this is the this is
[1:32:25] the experience that we're talking about
[1:32:27] the reality of God coming into your life
[1:32:30] you never chose God God chose you
[1:32:34] God saw you
[1:32:36] God God's going to use you
[1:32:40] you know I was talking to brother Corey
[1:32:42] the other day and I was saying brother
[1:32:43] Corey
[1:32:45] it's a miracle
[1:32:47] I said when did you come to the Lord he
[1:32:48] said 1995 I said praise God I said I
[1:32:51] came 1994 because I remember you were
[1:32:53] just a kid you'd come into the youth
[1:32:55] meetings you know just a kid and and I
[1:32:58] said you're still standing after 28
[1:33:00] years
[1:33:01] I said I don't care what you've gone
[1:33:03] through
[1:33:04] I don't care what the devil is trying to
[1:33:06] put on you
[1:33:07] the devil's put a lot of things on a lot
[1:33:09] of us
[1:33:10] tries to Mur us and scur us and make us
[1:33:13] tell us that we're this tell us that
[1:33:15] we're that I don't believe I tell that
[1:33:16] demon go right back to hell where you
[1:33:18] came from
[1:33:21] I said but guess what sometimes I get a
[1:33:24] headache and I'll take a Tylenol
[1:33:27] I'm not afraid of taking medicine when I
[1:33:30] need it
[1:33:31] I don't need it all the time
[1:33:33] but when I need it I'll take it
[1:33:35] okay because it's dealing with this it's
[1:33:37] got nothing to do with that attribute I
[1:33:39] said you're still standing
[1:33:41] after 28 years by the grace of God I
[1:33:44] said a young man are you kidding me
[1:33:47] being tempted by the lust of the flesh
[1:33:49] by the by the things of this world you
[1:33:52] know as a young man I look back and say
[1:33:54] Lord Jesus thank you Lord that I didn't
[1:33:57] have to have that portion
[1:34:00] what a fight that would have been
[1:34:02] we don't understand but God knows what
[1:34:05] that attribute has to produce
[1:34:08] God knows what it's gonna what the
[1:34:10] purpose behind it is God knows how it's
[1:34:12] going to get used and how it's going to
[1:34:14] bring glory to God In The End
[1:34:17] Hallelujah there's been a lot of others
[1:34:20] that have been put through certain
[1:34:22] trials not even close to those kind of
[1:34:24] Trials and yet they walk away
[1:34:26] but there's something in there
[1:34:29] that is standing from before the
[1:34:32] foundations of the world
[1:34:34] Hallelujah glory to God when that when
[1:34:37] that blind Bartimaeus was blind as about
[1:34:40] sitting on the side of the road born
[1:34:42] blind new blind Nothing But Blind and
[1:34:45] the spirit of God looked at him and said
[1:34:47] what do you have need of
[1:34:49] and he said that I might see
[1:34:52] and right there his eyes were opened you
[1:34:55] try to tell blind biter mass that he
[1:34:57] didn't meet the Living God
[1:34:59] you try to tell him he left with a
[1:35:02] testimony the woman at the well left
[1:35:04] with a testimony you can claim that
[1:35:06] you've left with a testimony you know
[1:35:09] what God has done in your life you know
[1:35:10] what God is doing in your life
[1:35:14] this has got nothing to do with you
[1:35:16] trying to put on or you I can go to
[1:35:18] church more than anybody else I can do
[1:35:20] this I can do that you gotta die out to
[1:35:23] I you all of you you remember the seed
[1:35:27] it's surrounded by all kinds of leaves
[1:35:30] and Shucks and everything else but it's
[1:35:32] all Gotta Die
[1:35:34] it's got a completely all die everything
[1:35:37] around your life everything that's human
[1:35:39] everything that's that that that's
[1:35:41] that's contrary reasoning trying to put
[1:35:44] reasoning on this reasoning on that it's
[1:35:46] got to die
[1:35:48] this is the time of maturity
[1:35:51] this is where she comes into the
[1:35:53] fullness of knowing who she is
[1:35:55] and who she stands with and who it is
[1:35:59] that's in her
[1:36:03] Hallelujah
[1:36:05] but you know God has to send manna
[1:36:09] God needs to send us
[1:36:11] something every now and then listen to
[1:36:13] Listen to brother Branham here in the
[1:36:15] message kinsman redeemer now you know
[1:36:16] the story of Ruth
[1:36:18] he says then he went to the young man
[1:36:20] the others he said now she's gleaning
[1:36:23] for life
[1:36:25] oh boy
[1:36:29] listen we all go through those times
[1:36:33] where we're searching
[1:36:35] we're searching for something
[1:36:37] we're searching for that next Revelation
[1:36:40] we're waiting on God what is it it's
[1:36:43] gleaning it's searching the scriptures
[1:36:45] listening to the messages coming into
[1:36:47] the house of the Lord coming under that
[1:36:49] anointing but brother Brahm says here he
[1:36:52] says now she's bleeding for life now I
[1:36:54] want you Reapers you angels in other
[1:36:56] words
[1:36:57] that's what they are said I want you
[1:37:00] Angels you Reapers once in a while to
[1:37:02] drop a handful
[1:37:04] of Revelation
[1:37:08] purpose he calls it
[1:37:10] the Bible said it was
[1:37:13] well sometimes you get down sometimes
[1:37:16] you get weak sometimes you get so
[1:37:18] discouraged
[1:37:19] but God is going to send you some
[1:37:21] purpose
[1:37:22] to your life
[1:37:23] he's going to send you some Revelation
[1:37:25] that's going to bring you back that's
[1:37:27] going to restore your walk with the Lord
[1:37:29] renew your your your walk with God
[1:37:31] restore unto you the joy of your
[1:37:34] salvation because we all go through
[1:37:36] those dry times amen but God sends some
[1:37:40] purpose oh don't let it all be so
[1:37:42] tiresome for her but every once in a
[1:37:45] while let her hear a good message let a
[1:37:47] good power of the Holy Spirit cover her
[1:37:50] over once in a while to let her know
[1:37:52] that I'm still there do some kind of a
[1:37:55] healing among her do some kind of a sign
[1:37:59] or a wonder that she'll know that I'm in
[1:38:01] her midst that it's that don't don't you
[1:38:04] like to find them handfuls he says
[1:38:07] he says the Congress the congregation
[1:38:09] says amen I hope we find some this
[1:38:12] morning I hope you found some this
[1:38:14] morning
[1:38:14] I hope that there's there's a refreshing
[1:38:17] of some purpose coming into your walks
[1:38:19] this morning to serve God and to
[1:38:22] recognize that you've got a great
[1:38:24] purpose in the plan of God a handful of
[1:38:26] fresh barley the Lord is doing something
[1:38:29] that he that he that he used to do
[1:38:32] something that we know he does you see
[1:38:35] that's what that's what happened to me
[1:38:36] this morning I'm driving along and I'm
[1:38:39] just listening to the message and all of
[1:38:40] a sudden I realize that that he's
[1:38:43] dropping inspiration and Revelation and
[1:38:46] he's vindicating that that he's in my
[1:38:48] life that he he's concerned that he
[1:38:50] wants to do more that he did those
[1:38:52] things because he had a purpose he wants
[1:38:55] to fulfill his plan you're coming into
[1:38:57] that maturity you're growing by the
[1:38:59] grace of God he drops some purpose amen
[1:39:02] glory to God I hope we find some this
[1:39:05] morning he says he does the he's lord of
[1:39:09] the Harvest
[1:39:10] he's the only one can drop the handful I
[1:39:12] want you to know that Danny or Pastor
[1:39:14] Simon or Tim or Chris or Philip we can't
[1:39:18] drop purpose but he can come and he can
[1:39:21] drop his anointing and he can let the
[1:39:23] word be be filled with the spirit so
[1:39:26] that when it when it strikes you when it
[1:39:28] strikes your heart that's called the
[1:39:30] Revelation the stimulation that comes
[1:39:33] from the Revelation and you don't you
[1:39:35] you can't explain that it's just
[1:39:37] Supernatural
[1:39:38] when you're in Fellowship you'll know
[1:39:41] you'll know when you're in fellowship
[1:39:43] with a brother or sister you know like
[1:39:45] my wife tells me all the time you know I
[1:39:46] was in the fellowship there with the
[1:39:48] sisters and boy there was a beautiful
[1:39:49] sweet anointing that came around what is
[1:39:51] that it's the stimulation because God is
[1:39:55] dropping handfuls of purpose
[1:39:58] Revelation to give you existence to give
[1:40:01] you uh confidence to keep pressing on
[1:40:04] and to keep encouraging one another we
[1:40:07] should be encouraging one another this
[1:40:09] is the time to encourage one another
[1:40:11] this is the time to lift Christ up in
[1:40:15] the midst of our fellowship not raise
[1:40:17] ourselves up I can do this and I can do
[1:40:20] that and you know I did this and I did
[1:40:22] that and oh yeah yeah it's all no this
[1:40:25] is God's time
[1:40:27] this is Christ in you the bride
[1:40:30] manifesting himself in the world showing
[1:40:33] himself that he can live in a people
[1:40:36] that he's still alive that he's not
[1:40:38] somebody that's just in the word in the
[1:40:41] Bible that people talk about as a
[1:40:43] history but he's alive
[1:40:45] he's alive brother Desmond he's real
[1:40:48] so many testimonies brother Desmond goes
[1:40:50] and prays for the sick and and and and
[1:40:52] people getting healed why because he
[1:40:55] knows he's alive
[1:40:57] he knows he's alive and you need to know
[1:40:59] he's alive you can't be afraid to lay
[1:41:02] your hands on the sick when they're sick
[1:41:03] pray over them let the Holy Spirit
[1:41:07] interpret it you're not going to need to
[1:41:09] interpret anything
[1:41:11] Hallelujah
[1:41:14] Angels go down he says I command the
[1:41:17] angels to go down to that meaning that
[1:41:19] meeting this morning I want them to do a
[1:41:22] certain certain thing I've commanded
[1:41:24] them and they'll do it oh my praise God
[1:41:27] forevermore what is it it's God
[1:41:31] coming down in the midst
[1:41:34] next slide
[1:41:36] it's like hatching an egg
[1:41:41] the seed is not air with the shuck
[1:41:45] brother Branham saying here an egg
[1:41:47] cannot hatch
[1:41:50] it rots right in the nest if it hasn't
[1:41:52] been
[1:41:54] with the male bird
[1:41:56] and that's why we need to realize
[1:41:59] recognize and know
[1:42:02] that this is all about him
[1:42:05] this is not about you this is about him
[1:42:09] manifesting his Spirit into your home
[1:42:12] into your family into your business into
[1:42:16] your health
[1:42:18] inviting him into every aspect of your
[1:42:21] life because that's what brings forth
[1:42:24] The Life just like members of a church
[1:42:27] you can baby them and call them make
[1:42:30] them deacons and everything else but you
[1:42:33] have a nest full of rotten eggs unless
[1:42:35] they've mated with the meat oh glory to
[1:42:39] God Amen God is God is looking for
[1:42:42] elected attributes of God in this day
[1:42:44] and in this hour
[1:42:46] that's what he's hunting for that's what
[1:42:48] he's harvesting now amen the shuck has
[1:42:52] to leave the seed to get the seed in the
[1:42:55] presence of the Sun so it can be ripened
[1:42:58] and so so that's why sometimes they'll
[1:43:01] go out from us because they were not
[1:43:02] they were not of us that's why there's
[1:43:05] going to be a separating sometimes
[1:43:07] that's why there's going to be
[1:43:08] situations that are going to happen
[1:43:10] people in your own lives that you
[1:43:12] thought you know they were your friends
[1:43:14] they were you love them that you thought
[1:43:16] they loved you and then all of a sudden
[1:43:17] you know you talk too much about the
[1:43:19] Lord
[1:43:20] and it kind of scares them and then all
[1:43:22] of a sudden they're not calling you
[1:43:23] anymore they're not hanging out with you
[1:43:25] anymore because they think you're some
[1:43:27] sort of a religious fanatic
[1:43:28] that's what they thought about Jesus
[1:43:32] because he was God on Earth and and he
[1:43:35] says I'll be with you even in you
[1:43:38] and if you believe that then you know
[1:43:40] that the spirit of God is around your
[1:43:42] life you can't help it he chose to Abode
[1:43:46] in you and so he's going to manifest
[1:43:48] himself in you and things are going to
[1:43:51] start to leave your life
[1:43:53] things are going to fall away
[1:43:56] you know little by little the Lord is
[1:43:58] going to deliver you
[1:44:00] when I first came to the Lord
[1:44:02] and he opened my understanding
[1:44:05] everywhere I looked it was like unbelief
[1:44:07] all around me and I I said pastor Simon
[1:44:09] I'm going to sell everything I'm going
[1:44:11] to get rid of everything I'm just going
[1:44:12] to come I'm just going to come to church
[1:44:13] I I don't want nothing to do with this
[1:44:15] anymore this is my God it's a wife you
[1:44:18] see
[1:44:19] you your eyes are open
[1:44:22] and without some wisdom and some some
[1:44:25] direction and some balance
[1:44:28] and maturity
[1:44:29] you start to do things that are out of
[1:44:32] character
[1:44:33] and that's why it's so important to
[1:44:36] realize
[1:44:37] that this is a work
[1:44:39] it's a it's a work God is gradually
[1:44:42] little by little will I deliver my
[1:44:45] people
[1:44:47] next slide
[1:44:49] invisible Union of the Bride
[1:44:52] he says here
[1:44:55] you take that wheat and open it up and
[1:44:58] you pull it off the stock you look at it
[1:45:01] you say we got a grain of wheat but
[1:45:03] careful it's just exactly like the grain
[1:45:06] but there's not a bit of grain in there
[1:45:09] it's the shuck the shuck can look just
[1:45:12] exactly like the wheat seed but the
[1:45:15] moment that you really open it up and
[1:45:18] you start to expose what's really there
[1:45:20] you find out there's nothing there
[1:45:22] and there's a lot of that going on right
[1:45:24] now Matthew 24 24 said it would be so
[1:45:27] deceiving in the last days that it would
[1:45:29] deceive even the very elect if it were
[1:45:31] possible there's a lot of people that
[1:45:33] are claiming this message but yet
[1:45:35] they're claiming things and saying
[1:45:37] things that don't line up with the seed
[1:45:39] word of God
[1:45:41] it's not it there they don't realize
[1:45:43] that they're actually pushing aside
[1:45:46] Jesus Christ in the present stage of his
[1:45:49] ministry he's the lord of the Harvest
[1:45:51] right now he came down in 1963 brother
[1:45:55] Branham had to go off the scene in 1965
[1:45:58] so that the mighty Angel himself the
[1:46:01] lord of the Harvest could step down and
[1:46:04] begin to ripen and call and bring into
[1:46:07] maturity the seed that he's calling into
[1:46:10] the rapture
[1:46:13] so there's a lot of things going on
[1:46:15] right now around us even within the
[1:46:18] ranks and the Realms of the message that
[1:46:21] if that but but you see you can't be
[1:46:23] deceived because the minute you remember
[1:46:25] that that that that that Supernatural
[1:46:27] element that's called Revelation and
[1:46:29] stimulation never never uh
[1:46:33] make that anything you know really like
[1:46:36] simple it is simple but don't don't put
[1:46:39] put it aside because when the spirit of
[1:46:42] God stimulates you
[1:46:44] when you hear something when somebody
[1:46:46] says something and and there isn't a
[1:46:49] stimulation and there isn't a revelation
[1:46:51] behind it it's either because it's not
[1:46:54] time for you to receive it you don't
[1:46:56] need to say anything
[1:46:57] it's maybe not the time for you to
[1:46:59] receive it or it's just not revelation
[1:47:04] it's man
[1:47:06] it's man's thinking
[1:47:08] but you've been given this Supernatural
[1:47:11] element which is the ability to receive
[1:47:14] rapturing faith
[1:47:17] that element cannot be under emphasized
[1:47:22] you will know when something is not
[1:47:25] truth
[1:47:26] you will the spirit of Truth in you will
[1:47:29] will identify with you need to wake up
[1:47:31] to this if you're not aware of it now
[1:47:33] then I'm asking you to be more sensitive
[1:47:37] to your inner senses too many times how
[1:47:40] many times have you done certain things
[1:47:42] and you knew that you received an
[1:47:45] inspiration not to go there and you
[1:47:48] ended up going
[1:47:49] and it was like
[1:47:52] I knew that I felt something about that
[1:47:56] I shouldn't have even gone there you
[1:47:58] know I shouldn't have said that you know
[1:48:00] that's why it's so important to think
[1:48:01] before you speak
[1:48:03] it's important you've got to understand
[1:48:05] that your words they have an effect on
[1:48:08] people when you write something it has
[1:48:11] an effect on people when you don't write
[1:48:13] something it has an effect on people
[1:48:15] it's there's all kinds of hidden
[1:48:18] messages that can be uh you know
[1:48:21] discerned in in our lives and we need to
[1:48:25] become more sensitive to those things
[1:48:26] and how do you do that you just get more
[1:48:29] quiet with the Lord you surrender more
[1:48:31] to the Lord these are practical things
[1:48:33] that before you do something take it to
[1:48:36] prayer
[1:48:37] and sit quietly and wait and if you
[1:48:41] sometimes you gotta wait there for an
[1:48:43] hour but all of a sudden you will
[1:48:46] receive an inspiration
[1:48:48] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:48:50] forever
[1:48:51] I will speak to my people he speaks
[1:48:55] you need to come into that time of
[1:48:56] maturity in your life where you where
[1:48:58] you can actually get quiet and Silent
[1:49:02] with the Lord and you can hear his voice
[1:49:04] amen hallelujah
[1:49:06] and see here he says we got a grain of
[1:49:09] wheat be careful it's just exactly like
[1:49:11] the grain but there's not a bit of grain
[1:49:12] in there it's a shuck there's the
[1:49:14] Pentecostals now brother Branham was
[1:49:16] back then talking and saying there's the
[1:49:19] Pentecostals today I say there's the
[1:49:21] message believers
[1:49:23] there's a lot of them
[1:49:25] so much as Matthew 20 24 said it
[1:49:29] deceived the very elect in the last days
[1:49:31] if it were possible
[1:49:36] continue on next slide and then the life
[1:49:39] comes out of that denomination goes into
[1:49:42] the grain then what happens when the
[1:49:45] grain begins to grow and it gets bigger
[1:49:48] so it can cover over something the
[1:49:51] denomination pulls away from it
[1:49:54] and you see that's what's happening
[1:49:56] right now
[1:49:58] there's a there's a season that we are
[1:50:00] now going through that there's that
[1:50:02] there's message Believers pulling away
[1:50:05] from message believers
[1:50:08] there's a time where the grain where God
[1:50:11] now is ripening that grain so much that
[1:50:15] everything else the the life because
[1:50:16] it's a denominational Spirit remember
[1:50:18] the same that white horse rider we can't
[1:50:21] get into go back and read the Seven
[1:50:23] Seals but that white horse rider that
[1:50:26] continued to ride and now is that Pale
[1:50:29] Horse he's riding right within the ranks
[1:50:32] of this message and the only way that
[1:50:34] he's deceived the people is the same way
[1:50:37] that he's always deceived the people he
[1:50:40] injects his own interpretation into the
[1:50:43] word of God and gets people listening to
[1:50:46] man instead of listening to the voice of
[1:50:49] God
[1:50:50] and still allow and instead of allowing
[1:50:53] the five-fold ministry which is the
[1:50:56] supernatural Christ himself operating
[1:50:59] through the five-fold through preachers
[1:51:02] in this hour right now right here
[1:51:04] speaking to individuals and giving them
[1:51:07] inspiration and teaching them what
[1:51:10] they're who they are why they've been
[1:51:12] called what their position in the word
[1:51:14] is and how you're coming into the
[1:51:16] maturity now for the rapture
[1:51:19] that denominational Spirit it starts to
[1:51:22] pull away
[1:51:24] not because
[1:51:25] it's pulling away it's because you're
[1:51:28] pulling away
[1:51:29] it's drying up it dies
[1:51:32] it dies remember without the Holy Spirit
[1:51:35] you've got no message
[1:51:37] I don't care how much you quote brother
[1:51:39] Branham I don't care how much you know
[1:51:41] every single message that he preached in
[1:51:44] every single quote if the spirit of God
[1:51:47] is an anointing you to give you the
[1:51:50] revelation of what he was meaning when
[1:51:52] he was speaking those quotes and it was
[1:51:55] the spirit of God by Revelation speaking
[1:51:58] the understanding into the Sons and
[1:52:00] Daughters of God if you're not catching
[1:52:02] that spirit all you are is an
[1:52:04] intellectual Theologian of this message
[1:52:09] that's it
[1:52:11] it takes the spirit of God
[1:52:14] to give you understanding on what it is
[1:52:17] that's being revealed through the
[1:52:19] five-fold ministry and you cannot be
[1:52:21] deceived you cannot be deceived if
[1:52:24] you're a seed attribute of God you are
[1:52:27] ordained to receive this
[1:52:29] they never will it's the grain it can't
[1:52:32] go no further we're at the end time
[1:52:35] Hallelujah
[1:52:37] what does it have to do now lay in the
[1:52:40] presence of the sun to be ripened
[1:52:42] that's exactly the word to be ripened
[1:52:45] into your heart to bring forth and live
[1:52:48] what we're talking about right here
[1:52:51] right now
[1:52:54] I'm going to start to wind this down
[1:52:58] next
[1:53:03] Ephesians parallels Joshua
[1:53:06] and remember
[1:53:09] they had to eat manna
[1:53:12] Angel's food out of Heaven until they
[1:53:14] crossed over into the land
[1:53:17] God was giving them
[1:53:19] spiritual food God was giving them what
[1:53:23] they had need of while they were in the
[1:53:25] wilderness God was supernaturally out of
[1:53:27] nowhere
[1:53:28] nothing that they had to do nothing that
[1:53:31] they had to put on they didn't have to
[1:53:34] do nothing God just fed them
[1:53:36] and when they crossed over into the land
[1:53:39] the Manna ceased to fall
[1:53:42] see now it was a different dispensation
[1:53:44] now they had to come into their own walk
[1:53:47] with God
[1:53:48] now it was no longer just oh Lord give
[1:53:50] me this give me that oh I'm going to get
[1:53:52] my food the Lord's already dropped it I
[1:53:54] can go pick it up no now there's
[1:53:56] something that you need to do
[1:53:58] now there's a life that you need to live
[1:54:00] now there's a portion of the word that
[1:54:03] you need to fulfill remember this bride
[1:54:05] she she comes into maturity for a
[1:54:08] purpose
[1:54:09] you're not being matured to just get
[1:54:12] lazier
[1:54:13] you know like you know like you like you
[1:54:15] know like the boss of a company
[1:54:17] as the company grows and gets stronger
[1:54:19] and builds up and all the money's
[1:54:21] pouring in and the bank accounts are all
[1:54:23] full you start to notice the big belly
[1:54:25] start to come out he's relaxing more
[1:54:27] he's not doing much anything he's not
[1:54:29] doing anything anymore that's not what
[1:54:30] we're talking about here
[1:54:32] that's not the way it is with the bride
[1:54:34] this is the time where you come into
[1:54:37] your Joshua commission it's the
[1:54:39] Ephesians commission it's the time where
[1:54:41] you got to take the land God's given you
[1:54:44] everything you need God's Justified you
[1:54:46] Sanctified you given you everything that
[1:54:50] you have need of put a sword right on
[1:54:52] your side but if you don't use that
[1:54:53] sword
[1:54:54] you're going to get your head taken off
[1:54:58] you see you've got to know that you are
[1:55:01] maturing for a purpose when they crossed
[1:55:04] it ceased to fall they were fully
[1:55:06] matured then and they eat the old corn
[1:55:09] of the land now now you're not babies
[1:55:12] anymore
[1:55:13] now that you're not Desiring the sincere
[1:55:16] milk of the Gospel that you don't have
[1:55:19] to be babied and patted and persuaded to
[1:55:22] come to church
[1:55:23] now that you're really fully matured
[1:55:26] Christians you're ready to eat strong
[1:55:28] meat now you're ready to come into
[1:55:30] something he said you're ready to to
[1:55:33] understand something that's deep
[1:55:36] and Rich
[1:55:38] this is what we're feasting on right now
[1:55:41] it's not easy to swallow that Christ is
[1:55:44] in you
[1:55:45] it's not easy to swallow that that the
[1:55:49] mighty Angel has come down right now
[1:55:51] moving in the five-fold ministry
[1:55:53] speaking the word of God speaking life
[1:55:55] into your walks calling you into the
[1:55:58] resurrection calling you and placing You
[1:56:01] positionally by adoption into the word
[1:56:03] of gods because you have a purpose you
[1:56:06] have a plan you have a destiny you can't
[1:56:09] this is not the time to give up this is
[1:56:12] the time that you've got to keep
[1:56:13] Crossing amen next slide he says but you
[1:56:16] have noticed that this has been sweeping
[1:56:20] for 20 years now brother Brown said that
[1:56:22] back in 1965 when he preached the
[1:56:25] Rapture he says you'll never denominate
[1:56:27] this he was talking about that that this
[1:56:30] is not something this is the
[1:56:31] supernatural this is the strong meat
[1:56:33] that we're talking about now this is the
[1:56:35] element where you take your position
[1:56:37] where you recognize that you are the
[1:56:39] word you are the word made flesh in this
[1:56:43] vein in this hour you are the
[1:56:45] interpretation of the word of God in
[1:56:48] this vein in this hour God is going to
[1:56:50] interpret his own word around your life
[1:56:53] God is going to do Supernatural things
[1:56:55] around your life as you become aware and
[1:56:58] mature and recognize that you are no
[1:57:01] longer just just a church but you are
[1:57:04] the bride you are the wife this is not a
[1:57:07] church age anymore this is the bride's
[1:57:10] age
[1:57:11] Hallelujah but have you noticed this has
[1:57:14] been sweeping now for 20 years now
[1:57:16] there's no organization and they'll
[1:57:18] never be this is the end the Wheats come
[1:57:21] back to the wheat again and I say to you
[1:57:25] church this morning
[1:57:27] that the wheat is coming into full
[1:57:30] maturity that it might be gathered into
[1:57:33] the Garner that there's a people that
[1:57:35] God is maturing in this Dane in this
[1:57:37] hour to place into their positions in
[1:57:41] Authority listen we go in a Rapture but
[1:57:44] remember we're being trained and we are
[1:57:46] being given character for a purpose
[1:57:48] because after three and a half year uh
[1:57:52] honeymoon the time that we go and we go
[1:57:54] in the Rapture for three and a half
[1:57:56] years this whole world goes into chaos
[1:57:58] for three and a half years but guess
[1:58:00] what you're coming back
[1:58:03] if you're an attribute of God you're
[1:58:05] coming back and you're coming back to
[1:58:07] rule for another Thousand Years there's
[1:58:09] just so much that's going on Saints but
[1:58:12] we need to realize God wants to mature
[1:58:15] us and get us ready
[1:58:18] and be mentally under the right
[1:58:21] expectation
[1:58:23] the Wheats come back to its grain the
[1:58:27] shuck has pulled away from it and the
[1:58:30] wheat must lay in the presence of the
[1:58:33] sun let the musicians come
[1:58:35] to be ripened
[1:58:42] next slide
[1:58:46] Jesus counts character
[1:58:50] he counts character not members
[1:58:58] sure we want to see people
[1:59:01] being saved sure we want to see people
[1:59:03] receiving the word
[1:59:06] and that's our purpose and that you
[1:59:07] should be out there and all you need to
[1:59:09] do is just
[1:59:11] give him your testimony
[1:59:13] let them know what the Lord's done in
[1:59:15] your life that's all you need to do you
[1:59:17] don't need to tell them what they need
[1:59:19] to believe and that they they need to
[1:59:21] believe this or they need to believe
[1:59:22] that just give them your testimony
[1:59:25] let them know what God did for you and
[1:59:28] something inside there if the Lord is
[1:59:30] speaking to their heart there's
[1:59:31] something there they will awaken
[1:59:34] they will recognize just like when you
[1:59:38] received it he's the same yesterday
[1:59:39] today and forever
[1:59:41] he says Jesus counts character not
[1:59:44] members you know that he counts
[1:59:46] characters
[1:59:47] not all that say Lord Lord but the one
[1:59:50] that doeth the will of my father
[1:59:54] not he that starts
[1:59:57] it's he that finishes
[2:00:00] Hallelujah let's bow our heads
[2:00:04] father
[2:00:06] thank you for your word
[2:00:09] thank you for the inspiration Lord
[2:00:12] thank you for doing
[2:00:14] something in each and every heart here
[2:00:17] this morning Lord I know that
[2:00:20] you're so mindful and you you desire
[2:00:23] Lord for your children to come into that
[2:00:25] place of maturity
