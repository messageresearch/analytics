place hallelujah praise our God Amen we know the Lord is in this place God bless you Sister Brother Daniel sister Michelle thank you brother Anthony praise God God bless you Saints Welcome to our w Wednesday night bible study praise God it's time to uh get excited about what the Lord's going to reveal to us tonight amen am praise God I'm excited I know that he's a reality that um you know these Bible studies on Wednesday nights are real a real blessing amen the brothers come and they they get inspired of the Lord and they bring some wonderful thoughts and things that we need in order to uh grow and to overcome the situations that we're facing on a daily basis amen praise God and so tonight we're going to be looking um we're going to be continuing along the um the thought of seeing my part in the word of God we want to we want to know we want to see we want to recognize what God is doing in this day and in this hour and it's one thing you know like when Jesus was on Earth he was causing a disturbance and a lot of people had recognized that um something was happening that there was a a disturbance they they couldn't quite understand what it was but those that became a part of the revelation of Jesus Christ in that day recognized that they were actually in fulfillment of Prophecy and it brings a a tremendous amount of Faith to the individual when they can see that they're actually a part of it right from the one that was you know on the side of the road crying out son of David have mercy mercy on me when he cried out from the side of the road he didn't realize that that he was going to actually fulfill the word of God in his day that he was going to identify himself as part of the word of God that that Jesus Christ the Messiah was going to be right there speaking to him and raising him from his blindness amen and he fulfilled prophecy he fulfilled the prophecy that God was a Healer that he was the Messiah that he was you know when Lazarus was raised from the dead he was showing that he was the resurrection amen praise God and so tonight we're going to be looking at part two you can put up the uh the slide of seeing our part in the word of God identification of the word made flesh that's what we're looking at the identification of the word made flesh how we identify it how we not only identify it but recognize that we are it right amen praise God Amen that's that's where it gets exciting amen praise the Lord Jesus let's pray father we're we're uh excited tonight Lord to know that your presence is in this place lord it's not so much that you come and dwell in this place because of the building that we have and how nice it is no that's not what it is Lord is because we've gathered together and according to your word you said that where two or three would Gather in your presence under the expectation of uh hearing from Glory from from the mighty angel from you from God the Mighty God would speak to our hearts and our lives so that we could leave different than when we entered in Lord that is why you come Lord you have a purpose and a desire for each and everyone that's present here tonight bless them each and everyone for their sacrifice coming through the cold and Lord they could have stayed in a nice warm room room at home but Lord they they they they press through and God may you just so bless each and every one of them and Lord remember those that are at home those that are uh now listening in father they may be at a distance or uh whatever it might be Lord raise them up if they're sick heal them through the word of God that's spoken here tonight do a mighty work in in their lives and bless and prosper each and everyone Lord we give you thanks and we give you the praise now take control control in Jesus name amen praise God let's read our first scripture tonight amen in Colossians 1: 12-9 it says giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light wow what a wonderful listen as we're reading the word of God I don't know but this word is just it just keeps breaking open with with with with bursts of Revelation amen so be under expectation because I believe we're going to get something tonight who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins just in that first paragraph the whole Plan of Redemption the whole thing about you being a part of it the whole aspect that that not only are you a part of it but you're you're you're washed you're forgiven you're cleansed by the word of God the blood of Jesus Christ amen who is the invisible who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature Jesus Christ was God the word made flesh the invisible became visible in Jesus Christ amen praise God and he's visible tonight if you've received that spirit in you which is his Spirit the holy spirit amen for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him Amen period amen hallelujah there's no other God there's only one God and it's right there it is clear and and and precise all principalities all dominions listen there's no other God you know they said oh there's God the Father in Heaven Christ the son on earth and the Holy Spirit the power of God it's all him amen praise God we need to we need to see this clear a praise God Amen there's no other Throne there's no other Dominion everything was created all things were created by him and for him all things you me we were created for him listen here and he before all things and by him all things consist so everything operates by his Spirit that's what we're going to be looking at tonight we're looking at the word made flesh identification of the word amen praise God and he is the head of the the body the church now he's talking about you and me amen who is the beginning the first born from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all a l l fullness dwell praise God you may be seated Hallelujah wow what a what a tremendous scripture you know know brother brandham read this scripture and a lot of the quotes that we're going to be looking at in the in this whole study you know a lot of it if you get a chance go back and listen to Christ the mystery of God revealed go back read it you know just it's all there's a lot that's being drawn from that amen because um in there is a whole you know brother Braham said if there's one message that he preached that was so inspired it was that message there because he says it basically encompasses the whole whole plan of God and everything that that that God had in his mind from before the foundations of the world he was going to manifest through this Christ being the mystery of God revealed it's always been Christ everything was Christ from the very beginning right back from the Garden of Eden right back when the word said in the beginning the word amen in the beginning God in the beginning the self-existent one Elohim the the alpha the Omega everything was surrounding him he's the beginning he's the end he's in all through all and he's fulfilling all for his purpose for his glory and for his honor that's the thing that the modern world out there and the teachings that they have and all the interpretations that they're trying to place on their purpose their existence the Creator uh the universe can't they can't come to a full understanding because until they come to the to the humility of recognizing that there is an almighty God a self-existent one yes we are a part of that you know we were fellowshipping on that um yesterday or this morning my wife and I we were talking about how this generation there's so much teaching and and people are looking to identify them themselves and trying to find their identity they want to know why they're in these bodies they they they realize that there's something Beyond this Dimension but they can't figure it out because what they're trying to do is they're trying to to identify and and uh figure it out by their own understanding by their own scientific knowledge or or uh by their own intelligence they think that they can figure out God how can the creation figure out the Creator but how we've been so blessed is that we've been we've been uh given the ability to recognize that we are actually in God Amen and that element and that Revelation is what brings our identity our purpose God's plan everything that he had in his mind and everything that he wanted to to to express in the purpose of the whole creation all the earth and the wars and the and and the and the pestilence and the sickness everybody's trying to figure all these things out but unless the spirit of God goes in you and allows you to contact his mind and come into Unity of his spirit and allow his Revelation his mind to be expressed to you there's no way you can possibly figure it out I don't care how many theories you come up with how many different yeah the word says there's that the worlds were framed by the word of God worlds so there could have been many other civilizations before us but like we've said before that's got nothing to do with us amen other than the same pattern or potentially recognizing what God did in in the past you know in in his in his um revelation of himself and what he reveals to us we can only know what he reveals to us we we become more in tune with God as we surrender our human Pride our human you know desire to be like God remember that was the cause of the Fall people wanted to be like God but they didn't want to come under submission to God Amen be being able to come under submission fully to God shows that you are a part of God because you cannot sin in other words you cannot disbelieve God an attribute of God cannot rebel against God Amen because God God is Not divided that's why a kingdom that's divided it's going to it's going to beat itself up it's going to fight it's going to argue that that's why you know man finds themselves in war war and because of their pride no I know more I know more I I have a higher understanding than you so that makes me greater than you no no I know what God has allowed me to know what and and and the more that I surrender to the Lord the more that I give myself over to the spirit and the anointing of the Holy Spirit the more that I become one the more that I can that I can be like him I can recognize what the word says about me because I'm in the word because now I'm identifying with the word it is my supreme authority it's my absolute I'm not making myself my my own absolute and that's what the that's what this new age thinking and and teaching is trying to do like hey you are everything you can become like God that's what Satan tried to sell Eve in the Garden of Eden and that's what caused the fall it's because he went to her and says no no no no have God said that you can't eat of this tree you can't you you can't partake of the knowledge that I have he knew exactly what God had said the serpent but he went and he deceived Eve in the Garden of Eden but what we're going to see through this study as we continue through it we're going to recognize that this Eve which is the bride for this hour which is the you know when when we talk about the church remember the church is the bride of Christ the true church is the bride of Christ but this church in this age in the final stages of the end time will not be deceived this eve will allow him to have the full preeminence amen praise God God hallelujah so um let's go to the next Slide the next slide and this is where we're going to be we're going to be looking at things here this is where we left off last time and I said okay this is where it starts to get really good and I was excited because I realized okay here's where it starts to really you know um pour out and the Holy Spirit was just pouring out you know when as I was reading these quotes and reading this these Scriptures it says in Romans chap 8:1 but if this if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you now we need to we need to look at this scripture and we need to see it exactly the way it says but if if the spirit dwell in you you see that's the difference it's not in everybody and that's why people will read this scripture and they'll automatically you know assume that the spirit of Christ is in them but remember the spirit of Jesus Christ which is himself can never go against his own word amen it'll never deny his own word the minute that that that you speak to somebody and they turn around and you say to them well praise God brother you know and they they say to you I'm a Christian she says to you I'm a Christian praise the Lord and you know you you just like Paul in Acts 19 Paul came across a bunch of disciples and they were the disciples of Christ because they were preaching the word they were excited about Jesus Christ they were talking about John the Baptist they were excited about you know they had recognized that that God had sent a a a forerunner God had sent a prophet amen praise God you could talk to people in this message and they'll tell you Amen brother God sent us William Mary and brandom praise God hallelujah he sent us the prophet and then you talk to some of them and you know and then and then Paul goes to them so so how are you baptized they said well we were baptized by John the Baptist just like some people today you know that there's people that are that are baptizing in the name of William Branham oh yes there's a movement of people that are baptizing in the name of William brandham not in the name of Jesus Christ okay but Paul told those disciples no no no you need to be re-baptized amen you need to be baptized in the name of the bridegroom Jesus Christ The Mighty God the one who came the Messiah and his name was Jesus Christ you need to be baptized and and you read the scripture they all had to be re-baptized they were all re-baptized and the Bible said the spirit of God Came Upon them why because they recognized the word they were willing to submit to the word and they expressed and manifested the word that's what we're talking about so how do we know that that that somebody is a true Christian not to say oh because they were baptized that saves them no there is a revelation in them and the spirit of God comes upon their lives and it begins to manifest supernaturally to where they recognize all the word and they start saying Amen to all the word not just a portion of the word amen praise God listen these are simple things and I know that you know you've heard them many times praise God but I'm not here you know the Lord has shown me that we're not to be here preaching all the high Mysteries of the word and getting into the Book of Revelations and the seventh seal and yeah we're going to cover all those things but Jesus said feed my sheep he also said feed my Lambs there are people that need to come under the the the Simplicity of this word those that are listening in and those that are visiting and those that are young amongst us that they've been found the message for many many years but yet they need to come into a supernatural personal revelation because some people will have heard these doctrines of that God is one and that you know that that that there's no other God and this and that but one day all of a sudden Boom the lights come on and they get the Revelation like they've never seen it before it lights up inside of them and it immediately takes them into a different walk where this Bible becomes a whole new Bible they can't wait to feed on it and every time they're feeding on it they're getting oh my gosh look at that I never saw that oh praise God I didn't see that oh Hallelujah that's me you know all of a sudden the word becomes alive amen praise God that's that's the that's what we're looking here at that if the same spirit that if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you it'll Quicken you it'll Quicken your body it'll Quicken your thoughts it'll Quicken your ability to recognize the word amen praise God Amen so um you know sometimes people will will will look at this scripture and they're not realizing um that the real Spirit here we're not talking about just a a Christian Spirit you know like denominational you know oh yes praise the Lord hallelujah you know they'll they'll say it like that no the real spirit this is God this is God himself coming into the individual changing their lives transforming their lives the moment that this becomes a reality to them they can never be the same you have a real experience with God Amen praise God and so it it's we don't have some watered down version here when we read the scripture we have the real original it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's the holy spirit it's the quickening power it's resurrection power in US praise God hallelujah First Corinthians chapter 12 it says but all these worketh that one and the same self self Same Spirit dividing to every man severly as he will that's that's God working in the body of Christ it's the same spirit amen it's always the Holy Ghost it's the Supernatural anointing that's positionally placing everyone into their positions and they are fulfilling the word of God by Revelation by an understanding of who they are they don't just play the piano there and you know the keys are just Keys there's an anointing that's going through their lives because of the anointing because of the Revelation that they have on the word of God and it flows through the keys it flows through the guitar it flows through the drums it flows through the singers through the trumpets that's the supernatural sound that we're looking for that's what pleases God not just your your natural ability God's looking at the consecration behind your ability is it his Spirit that's operating in you and through you when you play the guitar is it his Spirit that's operating through you when you sing are you are you singing because you want to be heard or are you singing because you want to give glory to God because when you do it to give him glory it blesses the whole body it sends an anointing through the whole church into anybody that hears that song see it's the selfsame spirit hallelujah we're just laid in a foundation here Genesis 1 the spirit of God moved on the face of the waters and this is listen this was the spirit of creation that whatever he said obeyed him that's the spirit that you receive when you receive the Holy Ghost you're not just receiving some you know people go into the water and they think oh I got baptized Hallelujah I went in I got buried in the water I came out of the water and now I got the Holy Ghost no no when when when it happens listen I remember the day that I got baptized when I came out of that water I knew knew that something Supernatural had taken place in my life I could not explain it but I knew that that that I that I was just purged there was no more desire for that for that for that addiction of the drug I I can't explain to you but you know the only example that I can give to you of how to explain it is like going to somebody that's never smoked a cigarette in their life and putting a cigarette to their mouth and saying here smoke it they're going to go what get away from me I don't want this I don't even know what it is I got no desire for it because when God does something when he removes the desire when he removes the heartache when he removes the sickness when he removes the oppression the depression you are never the same you are made whole listen you look back when Jesus Christ was on the earth when when blind barus was blind as a bat and he went up before Jesus and his eyes were open all the Pharisees and the priests and everything were questioning him asking him what what's this how did this happen he says listen I don't know how it happened but all I know is everything that you've taught me and everything that you've showed me about the Messiah it never brought this kind of a result in my life amen and all I know is that that man Jesus Christ is not just a normal man that is God hallelujah because only God could do what he did in my life and when you have that kind of an experience you're never going to be the same am you're going to be a living walking testimony of Jesus Christ you're life is going to be alive and well and and and different you you're never going to be able to fit into the world anymore like you used to I'm just telling you that's just the way it is you're never going to fit like you used to with your friends with your family yes you still have to have friends you still need to love your friends you still need to love your family you still need to be in this we're in this world but we're not of it we've come to a realization that hey I'm just passing through here I came into this Dimension I went into some spiritual Amnesia being born you know the son or the daughter of Mr and Mrs so and so but then I had an Awakening then I had somebody that turned on the lights amen praise God you hear about people saying I've had an experience uh you know I I've seen the light amen no it's not that you've seen the light it's God placed his light on you and awoke you out of your Darkness like we we've read in the scripture we were all in darkness and everybody out there I don't care who they are unless they come to the revelation of who God actually is they're living in light naturally but they're in spiritual Darkness until God opens the understanding Jesus said I open no man can shut I shut no man can open that's all part of the Paradox second Peter you know so now we see in Genesis we've got creative power that lives within us the holy spirit is is is the is the spirit of creation amen praise God hallelujah no other power no greater power second Peter 1:20 2 Timothy 3:16 And1 17 we have we have in these two verses the statement that the entire word of God was given by inspiration of the spirit of God so every inspiration every teaching every Revelation and understanding of who we are who God is comes by the spirit it doesn't come by your own intellect amen it doesn't come by your own sacrifice oh I'm going to go to school I'm going to get my PhD lldd GGG Doctorate of this and Doctorate of divinity I don't care how many letters are after your name there are many people like that in this world and they are so spiritually blind that they actually say there is no God you can't get any more blind than that to where you are an atheist when somebody says I'm an atheist I said wow they don't even believe that there's anything else there they all they believe is they're living they're going to go six feet underground and the party's over so I'm going to party as much as I can well you know what that's as good as it gets for them so they might as well party and enjoy their life like the scripture says if there's no salvation and there's nothing Beyond this then praise God they ain't going to say praise God they're just going to say praise the devil I'm going to live for him and I'm going to do everything that I possibly can because I'm going six feet under and that's the end of me and that's that's possible because not every soul is going back to God some have a beginning they will have an end yeah just like animals they have they live by the spirit of God everything lives by the spirit of God he is life but some have an eternal uh uh identity because they come directly from God but some are just spoken and created for a purpose and for a time and for a season and they'll bring forth after their own kind every seed will bring of its own kind fishes rabbits whatever animal life it is it'll bring forth of its own kind but God's Own Kind when God said let us make man in our image he was talking about himself with his attributes the Sons and Daughters of God he said now we're going to create our own image and we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna put it into human bodies for a season until they come out of their spiritual Amnesia and recognize who they really are and then they'll recognize that they are actually Gods Not not capital g o that we're that we are that we are God but that we are attributes of God humans bring forth other humans God Express expresses God's expresses aspects of himself of himself that's what we're looking at here amen and so everything's by inspiration we need the spirit of God working in our lives if we're to receive any kind of revelation of who we really are and who he really is so it's through that Supernatural spirit that raised Christ from the dead amen H Allelujah glory to God 1 Corinthians chapter 4 Corinthians 12:7 to 11 the demonstrations and manifestations of the spirit that rested on Paul Peter Phillip John listen all those you know when when when when Paul said you know I don't come to you with enticing words but I come to you in the power of the Holy Spirit he realized that it was not his own Revelation it was God revealing himself through Paul it was it was God manifesting through Paul when we look at the book of Acts we see that it is not the Acts of the Apostles like some people want to think it's actually the acts of the spirit through the apostles the book of Acts is the manifestation of God being made flesh through the apostles and the disciples now acts goes to chapter 28 a lot of lot of people ask me and say well Danny you know what is your church what is it that you believe I tell them listen we don't have um you know some sort of Homebase you know foundation and uh doctrinal uh encyclopedia or anything we don't have any catechisms we don't have anything that our catechism is the word of God our Bible our our absolute is the word of God yeah but what is it that your you know what does your church teach we teach the word of God if the book of Acts I say listen read the book of Acts I tell people read the book of Acts it's not the acts of the people that you're actually witnessing when you read that it's the spirit of God in those people well the book of Acts if there was a chapter 29 we'd be in that chapter because the word is progressing the the word is moving on and the word is is the same yesterday today and forever and so if you want to know what our church is like read the book of Acts exactly what you see there you're going to see here amen because he's the same Jesus Christ yesterday today right now and forever he doesn't change that's why we can trust him all the other denominations and all the other churches and stuff like that and I'm not saying all of them but I'm saying the ones that have taken their own doctrines their own catechisms their own teachings and they'll tell you that no no no no you don't have to listen to the word you got to listen to me you man's teachings the moment that man's teachings supersede God's teachings they make the word of God of none effect to the people and it cannot have the effect in the individual life because Jesus Christ himself said he that worships me must Worship in spirit and in truth so it's got to be by the spirit that leads you to the truth and when you've got both of them together and you worship God then you're actually you're it's the Deep call to the Deep it's the mind of Christ in you now and it pleases God like the scripture says without faith that word faith is revelation without Revelation you can't pleas God because you're you're you're you're you're giving God your own interpretation that's what I was saying earlier people want to figure out the universe why they exist and how they can manipulate their own lives in a way that they can feel like they're in control meanwhile it's God that gives you overcoming power it's God that gives you uh peace it's God that heals your body not you trying to will your healing or trying to figure out scientific ific Al how to take the best people spend hours and hours trying to figure out oh this this is the best this is what I got to take I got to take this vitamin that you go into some people's houses and you open their their cabinets they've got the whole Pharmacy in there they don't know which vitamin to take anymore my gosh because you know but that's normal that like that's just human nature right I do it all the time too I'm looking for something that's because we do need to be aware that there are herbs and and and vitamins that we need to place in our body and it's good and I do take them and they do have an effect and they've been helping me for years so I'm not I'm not saying that we don't need them but we need to put our faith in the right place Hallelujah he's still the Lord God that heals our bodies amen praise God Amen so so if you want to know what church what we represent then you need to re recognize and read the book of Acts we are a continuation of the book of Acts and it's the spirit of God that's moving and dwelling in us hallelujah so because of that Spirit we have authority amen praise God the spirit working in our lives like Paul said in Galatians 1 I certify you Brethren the gospel I preach was not after man but by the revelation of Jesus Christ and so our Authority does not hang on a wall I'm a doctor PhD lld doctor of divinity and that's why I can be the preacher and I can be a pastor listen I got none of those degrees none I didn't go to theology school the only school that I know is neology I get on my knees and I humble myself before God and I say Lord I can't I can't preach I need your anointing I I need your spirit I need you to come and feed the people and and and feed your lambs and feed your sheep but I believe in your spirit and I receive your spirit and I give you this vessel so that you can use this vessel to feed your people and that is what look at the disciples look at all the apostles they were unlearned men they were not people that had El listen Paul was a theologian of theologians okay but even Paul God had to knock him off his high horse because he thought he knew too much to the point where he didn't even know God and he was killing the spirit of God in individuals because that's why when Jesus knocked him off his horse on his road to aass Paul said who art thou Lord he knew it was God because only God could do that supernaturally knock him off his horse and and and and blind him like that he says who art thou Lord because the the spirit said why are you persecuting me Paul he says what do you mean who are you he says it is me Jesus and he had to throw out everything that he thought that he believed God had to take him for three and a half years into the Wilderness and take out all the theological teaching and all his his own interpretation he he says I count it all as dung hallelujah praise God you can be a theologian of theologians but until God knocks you off your high horse and allows his anointing and his Spirit to come upon you to recognize the word of God you are you you you will have nothing to give to the people you can give a nice sermon you can preach a nice sermon you can tie the the scriptures and all the types together but it is the letter that kth but it is the spirit that gives it life and that's what we're talking about tonight you need the Holy Spirit you need the spirit of God to interpret the word to preach the word and to make the word of any effect on anybody including yourself amen hallelujah Isaiah 59 it says in verse 19 that the Lord will raise a standard by his spirit so if you want to see things change in your life when you see the enemy attacking when you see the enemy coming in like a flood you know sometimes we find ourselves in circumstances and situations bombarded in our minds oppressed by the by by by the age and by all the things that we need to do sometimes uh listen Saints we're all human sometimes we get overwhelmed by the things of This World by the things of this life by bills that we got to pay by people that we got to take care of you know by seeing people you know sometimes you see people on the side of the road and and they're and they're and they and and they're freezing and and you know you want to do something and and you feel their pain you can't help it it's torment sometimes you see these situations and and you just wonder but it's all you know like it's just the grace of God but then God will come in and he will raise a standard how by his spirit so how can you deny his spirit and expect to have overcoming power in your life how you going to be of any good to anybody if you're not willing to accept humbly and let your pride just fall to the ground and receive the spirit of God in the way that he wants to give it not the way that you think it has to be people get so like like like we said on Sunday you know cognitive dissonance powerful Saints when I saw that I said oh my gosh people become so entrenched into what they believe and what they've been taught to the point that when the truth is actually brought right into their face clear written right there in the word of God clear as a bell they will they will do everything to deny it because it it because it threatens them they feel threatened that they were wrong what's wrong with being wrong that's why the Bible said repent why do we need to repent because we're wrong there's only listen you need to repent because there's something wrong otherwise why would you need to repent and then be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in other words receive God's spirit listen a husband when when when a husband takes a wife the wife she comes under her husband she she becomes one with her husband she realizes that he's the stronger vessel that he's her protector he can provide for her this is the natural process you know and there's a lot of women out there that are that are that are speaking out now and saying you know women's Liberation and and and you've taken it too far you've taken it to the point now where we that we we got to fend for ourselves for everything we can't even bring up our children and nurture them the way that we want to and spend the proper time with them because there's been so much pressure you know for for to to to to make enough and to to to work and not you know all these pressures that have come down on women but God wants to be your husband God wants to be your provider God wants to be your your your lover he wants to meet your needs and and give you what you have need of but you need to allow him to come you need to allow his Spirit to take control amen that's how he raises a standard amen Isaiah 10:27 says he breaks the Yoke by his Spirit not only breaks it the the scripture says he destroys it so any chain of circumstance that may have been on your life any circumstance drug addiction any kind of addiction any pornography all these things that that that take a hold of the people's minds these days God can destroy that yoke but it can only be done by his Spirit not by your own I'm going to go to rehab I'm going to quit this I'm going to quit that no you need to quit trying to quit you need to come to the Lord you need to submit yourself to a higher power that that that can raise a standard and can break the yolks in your life and destroy the enemy in your life hallelujah praise God people think that they they they feel like oh I I can't humble myself no I I don't want to be telling people you know that that that that Jesus saved me that Jesus healed me people people are ashamed to even speak the name Jesus meanwhile he's the only name whereby man must be saved there's no other name that man listen in everything that you do in word or deed you must do it in the name of Jesus Christ otherwise there is no salvation hallelujah praise God Amen thank you Jesus Hallelujah 1 Corinthians 3:16 the spirit of God dwells in your temple we are temples of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah praise God let's go to the next slide now now notice brother brandom's speaking here now he says now notice Romans 8:11 now if the spirit of him God that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you now listen what he says he says oh my the predestinated one of course like the seed laid upon the Earth the one that had life in them that's why if the spirit dwell in you this is where this this really came out when I read this quote I said wow praise God the predestinated seed the one that was prepared not everybody can receive God's word not everybody's going to be able to receive it because everybody that's on Earth not everyone has an attribute of God that can actually be quickened that's that's why Jesus spoke about The Parables some seed fell on thorny ground some seed fell on all the different aspects and he says some fell on good ground amen praise God this is the ground some some fell on on on ground and and and it was it had the ability to be quickened by the spirit of God I know that's tough to handle for some people they oh you know so you're just saying that you guys only have it and we we can't have it no I'm not saying that I'm telling you what the word says if the word is your absolute then you need to find yourself in the word and if you can see yourself in the word under that predestinated seat of God okay the one that that had life in them many of them were dead they were just rotten seed the waters and things burnt them out but you know there was a seed laying there ready for life God knowed it was laying there now the predestinated ones are the first to be quickened by the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit comes to claim its own that's why Jesus said all that the father hath given me all that in other words all that I had in my mind before the foundations of the world that's the father my mind okay they're going to come not one of them will be lost that's the other beautiful aspect of being a Christian and having a rest to know that all the Sons and Daughters of God that are out there are going to come you don't have to try and force anybody to come oh you got to come to my church that's the only church where you're going to find Salvation no you could have people come right in here and if they don't have any seat in them and they have no no election in them from before the foundations of the world that's not listen that's just scripture I'm telling you that's not something that I'm I'm I'm you know that's something we teach because this is what our church teaches no remember everything we teach is from the word of God everything that that that I'm speaking here you can you can ask me and I can show you in the word where it is then it's up to the spirit of God to show you and make it real to you amen praise God so everything's by the spirit of God and he says and he comes to claim its own now this is deep now you see it's it's kind of deep But be sure to catch this good now as the sun was sent across the Earth not to bring rocks which was dirt also to life it was not to bring all the dirt to life but was to bring the part of the dirt which was enclosed around A Life That's why seeds they have dirt around them and when the Sun hits that seed warms up that warms up that dirt the atmosphere for that seed starts to germinate and when the light of God's word comes onto your human your Humanity you're you're you're living in this human flesh you were you were born into this body you were born under a certain mother and father and everything else you come through the world speaking lies you were born in sin shaped in iniquity speaking lies but then when the spirit of God and not when we're not just talking any Spirit we're we're talking about the Holy Spirit remember Jesus was the Holy Spirit in his day walking on the earth and when he looked to Matthew and said Matthew come follow me when he spoke to Matthew that was not just words coming from a man that was actually the spirit of God speaking to the seed that was in Matthew to say come because this doesn't inherit the kingdom of God the ible says Flesh and Blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God this body needs to be quickened it's going to be changed remember the scripture says this Mortal shall put on immortality praise God so understanding that now we know that it's not the flesh that God is calling he's calling that seed amen that election that was there from before the foundations of the world praise God so this is important for us to understand next slide Not all men will receive Christ I'm continuing this is this is all from um uh the message I believe it's Christ The Mystery of God revealed uh yeah okay sorry okay just let me go back here okay now he goes on to say here not all men will receive Christ oh but those which God foreordained life God foreordained to have life it's not everyone is housed around some of the dirt of the earth that's the one he comes to Quicken they're the ones that now that dirt would lay there in the Sun and say oh this old sun is so hot that rock say this old sun is so hot but that little seed said that's what I'm looking for you see when when this message came to you you know a lot of people they they go to church and they listen they go to Catholic Church they go to baptist they go to Presbyterian they go to Jehovah Witness they're sitting there they're sitting in the pews they're looking at the clock because they can't wait to get out because they're something they're hearing it they might even get excited if the preacher is a good preacher but until something speaks to their heart and brings an Awakening into their lives to say wait a minute here this is not the this is different because when God wants to reveal something it's a spirit of God it changes absolutely everything he says this this uh he says um that's what I'm looking for and it begin to Spring forth to life it quickens that part of the dirt because the sun was sent not to Quicken The Rock not to Quicken the dirt but to Quicken the life of the seed now the Holy Spirit comes now of course it wasn't sent why wouldn't all the people receive it it wasn't sent to them the listen when Jesus came to the Earth he didn't come for everybody go back and read the gospels he says I didn't come for the for the righteous he says I came for those that that that that that needed healing I came for those that were sick I came for those I came for my own he said he said said all that the father hath given me will come not one of them will be lost what a wonderful promise in the word of God Amen Hallelujah praise God Amen thank you Lord Jesus and so here now go to the next slide we're winding down here we're going to finish in another five six minutes and then we're going to continue in the rising of the sun he says when God made his first bridegroom he made the bridegroom first and he was both man and woman in spirit okay remember when God expressed and said let us make man in our image okay he expressed Adam only it was one man okay one man and he and that was the that was the first bridegroom that's what brother Bram calls him okay now he said he made the first bridegroom first and he was both man and woman in spirit formed him in the dust of the earth to make him material so that he takes the dust of the earth and creates himself a body that he can put the spirit of of himself the spirit let us make man in our own image God expressing himself into a human body because there was a there was an earth that he had created for all of this Plan of Redemption to be fulfilled on and so now here he is and he's male and female in this one he forms him in the dust of the earth to make him material now notice when he made Eve it was from Adam he took not another piece of clay he took from the same piece of clay the same word for Adam was a spoken word when God said let us make man in our image God's word materialized that's his creative Spirit that's the power to create amen and he took from that same piece of clay the same word for Adam was the spoken word see he took from him and then taken he had masculine and feminine spirit and he took the feminist spirit away from Adam and placed in Eve created another body took because he was male and female god like a lot of people you know you know people are are are are wondering you know they have gender identity issues but but and and there's truth in the fact that in in the original creation which was Adam there was male and female but God separated them called one Adam and one Eve gave one the male one the female Spirit but they two are one amen and this is the whole thing why the church okay why we're talking about if the same spirit that raised up Christ and we read from the first scripture in the in Colossians he's talking about the church because the whole aspect of the church in the last days and the true Christian Church in this hour she goes back to her her original position back to her original Authority as being one with Christ Adam and Eve remember the first Eve was deceived but the scripture says that the bride in this day in the last days the the the the the eve the church for today will not be deceived she cannot be deceived why can she not be deceived because it's him in her Hallelujah then it's it was Adam's Spirit the dynamic um that Quicken the mechanics of his body so the bride must also be flesh of his flesh bone of his bone then how is this mortal flesh going to become his flesh we'll get to that in a minute see how it's done how what is this great [Music] transformation next time let the musicians come we're going to be looking at scripture and we're going to be quoting how it is that God is restoring us back to that fullness and being the literal body of Jesus Christ here on the Earth where Christ is now come to Quicken our bodies for the Rapture we're going to be looking at this process how it is that we simple people people that go to church week in and week out how it is that the spirit of God is is moving in our lives changing us drawing us listen the Bible says one will be taken another one left in the bed one will be in the bed the other one left in the bed one taken from the field the other one left in the field how is this that's it's happening now God is already calling that that Supernatural Church which is the supernatural body of Jesus Christ and she's coming under the leadership of the word she's not joining herself to a church she's joining herself back to her bridegroom Adam the first Adam Came Death the second Adam the Bible says is the quickening spirit that brings us back to life hallelujah praise God forever more so the next time we come together we're going to go a little deeper and we're going to we're going to search the scriptures we're going to see how it is that God is supernaturally bringing us delivering US changing us from line upon line precept upon precept here a little there a little through the fivefold ministry we are being perfected praise God hallelujah thank you Jesus let's continue to pray for these uh Bible studies praise God pray for your friends and you know invite your friends and your family to to join us to listen into these Services because there's nuggets in there that the holy spirit is giving us that can Quicken we're
