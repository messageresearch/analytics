[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] hello friends brothers in christ
[0:17] once again
[0:19] it's marvelous
[0:21] to have the privilege
[0:24] of being here with you in the presence
[0:26] of the lord
[0:28] may the lord bless us all together
[0:32] as we look into the perfect
[0:35] law of liberty
[0:37] and freedom
[0:38] and deliverance
[0:40] most of all
[0:42] of eternal life
[0:45] god bless us all
[0:47] as we
[0:49] meditate
[0:51] and look into his
[0:53] perfect word given to us
[0:56] in this day and in this hour
[0:59] god bless you
[1:01] our
[1:02] topic for today
[1:06] will be
[1:07] the book of life
[1:09] and the white throne judgment
[1:13] now of course
[1:15] both are
[1:16] very huge large subjects
[1:19] but we want to at least
[1:22] begin to
[1:23] touch and teach on it the best we know
[1:27] how
[1:28] coming to you once again
[1:30] from god's storehouse
[1:33] the seven church age
[1:35] series
[1:37] in which
[1:38] we speak on this subject
[1:41] the background the wisdom
[1:44] the knowledge
[1:46] the inspiration
[1:48] uh that flowed through
[1:51] the 20th century prophet
[1:55] william marion branham
[1:58] god used him
[2:00] as the voice
[2:02] to this age
[2:04] that's what his purpose and role was
[2:08] to be the messenger to the seventh
[2:12] church age
[2:13] and the voice of god for this hour
[2:17] may the great holy spirit
[2:20] take the word of god
[2:22] grant it to us
[2:24] with understanding and with wisdom that
[2:28] we may take the word and apply it to
[2:31] this day
[2:34] apply it to the modern church
[2:37] and apply it to ourselves
[2:40] that we may recognize
[2:43] our position and place and time that we
[2:47] are in
[2:49] in the word of god
[2:52] in the book of revelations
[2:54] chapter 20
[2:57] reading from verse
[2:59] 11.
[3:04] john speaking
[3:07] and i saw
[3:08] a great white throne
[3:12] and him
[3:14] not them
[3:15] and him
[3:16] that sat on it
[3:19] from the from whose face
[3:22] the earth and the heaven
[3:25] fled away
[3:27] and there was no place
[3:29] found
[3:30] for them
[3:33] and i saw
[3:35] the dead
[3:38] small and great
[3:41] stand before god
[3:45] and the books were opened
[3:48] and another book was opened
[3:52] which is the book of life
[3:56] and the dead were judged out of those
[3:59] things which were written in the books
[4:03] according to their works
[4:08] and the sea gave up the dead which were
[4:10] in it and death and hell delivered up
[4:13] the dead which were in
[4:16] them
[4:17] and they were judged
[4:20] every man
[4:22] according
[4:24] to their works
[4:27] and death and hell
[4:29] were cast into the lake of fire
[4:32] this is the second death
[4:35] and whosoever was not found
[4:38] written in the book of life
[4:41] was cast
[4:43] into
[4:44] the lake
[4:45] of fire
[4:49] of course
[4:51] reading from this scripture
[4:55] you will notice carefully it says
[4:58] and the books
[5:00] were opened
[5:02] and another book
[5:04] was opened which is the book of life
[5:08] the books and the book of life
[5:12] now these books
[5:15] of course
[5:16] we should see them
[5:18] as the book of our lives
[5:22] our
[5:24] activities
[5:26] our
[5:27] works
[5:29] that we have done here on the earth you
[5:32] will read it in this very scripture
[5:34] itself you will be judged that which was
[5:37] written in the books according to their
[5:40] works
[5:41] so the books hold
[5:44] the evidence
[5:46] it holds
[5:47] of your activity
[5:50] of all of that you have done
[5:55] while up on the earth all your doings
[5:58] public and secret
[6:00] uh whatever it was
[6:03] the book of your life will be opened
[6:06] at the white throne judgment
[6:09] open for all to see
[6:12] for all are standing before the great
[6:14] white throne
[6:16] and there you stand alone
[6:20] and the book of your life
[6:24] is opened up
[6:26] for the seals are off of them
[6:30] nothing is hid anymore
[6:33] the great judge with
[6:35] fiery eyes
[6:38] the word of god which is a discerner of
[6:40] the thoughts
[6:42] and the intents
[6:44] of the mind
[6:46] looks and can see and know
[6:51] everything past present future whatever
[6:55] is going on
[6:58] and there you stand before him
[7:01] one to whom you cannot lie you cannot uh
[7:05] you cannot evade
[7:07] no lies no
[7:09] equivocation no machinations
[7:12] none whatsoever no slipperiness no
[7:16] clever
[7:18] whatever you can not for you are before
[7:21] the
[7:22] eyes of the living god
[7:25] who stares into your soul
[7:28] and sees your entire being
[7:31] amen the one who knows you before you
[7:34] were born
[7:35] the one who knows your entire path of
[7:38] life
[7:39] and the one who knows who you are
[7:42] standing before him every thought every
[7:45] word every activity and every doing
[7:48] private public whatever that one knows
[7:52] it
[7:53] and the books of our lives
[7:56] will be opened up before him
[8:01] nothing can be evaded
[8:03] it is the white tron judgment
[8:08] it is given unto men wants to die
[8:12] and after this
[8:14] the judgment
[8:17] yes my friends
[8:20] we must look clearly at the word of god
[8:23] may god help us to see whether we are in
[8:27] the first
[8:28] resurrection and rapture
[8:32] or in the second resurrection
[8:35] of the white throne judgment
[8:38] so the books were opened
[8:41] and another book was opened
[8:45] which is the book of life
[8:48] and the dead were judged
[8:51] according to that which was written
[8:54] in that book of course in this study
[8:58] i cannot uh tell you everything about
[9:02] the book of life
[9:03] or about the white throne judgment
[9:06] i am giving you an overall
[9:09] picture
[9:10] as seen from the storehouse revelation
[9:16] given to the prophet
[9:19] william branham
[9:21] who fulfilled malachi 4 5 revelation
[9:27] 10
[9:28] 7
[9:30] and made known to us the word of god for
[9:32] this day
[9:34] and for this hour
[9:36] whosoever was not found written in the
[9:39] book of life
[9:42] was cast into the lake of fire
[9:45] so we see
[9:47] the judgment is set
[9:49] the judge is there before us
[9:52] and before him
[9:56] the entire world
[9:59] but this
[10:01] is made up of the righteous
[10:04] and the unrighteous
[10:07] the believing
[10:09] and
[10:11] the unbelieving
[10:14] when i say the righteous will be in the
[10:17] judgment
[10:18] we are not speaking about the bride
[10:22] because the bride has already gone into
[10:25] the presence of god
[10:28] with the rapture
[10:31] and first resurrection
[10:34] she is caught up
[10:35] to the throne of god
[10:38] and is in the presence of god
[10:40] with our bridegroom
[10:43] jesus christ
[10:45] and the bible tells us more
[10:48] first corinthians 6 2-3
[10:51] do you not know
[10:53] that the saints shall judge the world
[10:56] and if the world will be judged by you
[10:59] are you unworthy to judge the smallest
[11:03] matters
[11:05] nor he not
[11:07] we shall judge angels
[11:10] how much more
[11:12] the things that pertain
[11:16] to life
[11:18] yes my friends
[11:21] daniel 7 9-10
[11:24] i beheld
[11:26] till the thrones were cast down
[11:30] and the ancient of days did sit
[11:35] whose garment was white as snow
[11:39] his hair of his head
[11:41] white
[11:42] as wool
[11:44] the throne was like the fiery flame
[11:48] and his wheels as burning fire
[11:52] and a stream issued
[11:55] and came forth from before him
[11:58] and thousands
[12:00] thousand thousands ministered unto him
[12:05] and tens of thousand times ten thousands
[12:09] stood before
[12:10] him
[12:12] the judgment was set
[12:15] and the books
[12:17] were opened
[12:20] amen
[12:21] for this is the opening of the books
[12:24] of the lives
[12:27] of all who stood before
[12:30] the great judge
[12:32] but let us notice carefully
[12:35] thousands upon thousands are ministering
[12:39] unto him
[12:40] this speaks of the bride
[12:44] ministering unto him being with him
[12:49] in the midst of the judgment
[12:52] judging the world
[12:54] according to the word of god first
[12:56] corinthians 6 2-3
[12:59] that the saints shall judge the earth
[13:03] so
[13:03] with him
[13:06] she is seated with him ministering to
[13:09] him and judging the world together with
[13:14] him
[13:16] the question comes up who are these
[13:18] righteous ones
[13:20] that you're speaking of
[13:23] that will be in the judgment
[13:25] there's no other place these righteous
[13:27] can come up
[13:28] for the bride is already gone
[13:31] she's seated before them so who are
[13:34] these righteous
[13:36] where do they come from
[13:38] and where else could they come up
[13:40] there's these two resurrections the
[13:42] first one was gone
[13:44] and now it's the second left here amen
[13:48] they could not qualify
[13:50] for the first resurrection and rapture
[13:54] and so they find themselves left behind
[13:57] and left in the second
[14:00] resurrection which is a resurrection
[14:03] unto judgment
[14:06] the ones who qualify
[14:08] of course for the first resurrection and
[14:11] rapture which is the bride the bible
[14:13] clearly tells us
[14:16] they shall not come into judgment but
[14:20] have already passed from death unto life
[14:23] all blessed be his holy name i thank god
[14:27] for evermore for his grace john chapter
[14:30] 5
[14:31] verse 24 tells us verily verily i say
[14:34] unto you he that heareth my word amen
[14:39] and believe it on him that sent me amen
[14:44] hot everlasting life
[14:47] hath
[14:48] amen he has everlasting life
[14:52] praise god the believer of course is the
[14:56] one who has that eternal life and shall
[15:00] not come into condemnation
[15:03] hallelujah shall not come into any
[15:06] judgment
[15:08] but have passed which is to say they're
[15:11] permanently passed from death
[15:15] into life
[15:17] but not just carefully
[15:19] jesus must have yet another group in
[15:22] mind
[15:23] who at
[15:25] the judgment
[15:27] will receive
[15:29] eternal life
[15:32] amen
[15:34] not previously having received it
[15:38] as members of the bride yet they will
[15:40] have eternal life
[15:42] and not be in the bride
[15:45] but be servants or be
[15:48] ones that will be assistance
[15:51] with her john 5 28-29
[15:54] marvel not at this
[15:57] for the hour is coming
[16:00] in the which all
[16:03] that are in the graves
[16:06] shall hear his voice
[16:10] and shall come forth
[16:13] and they that have done evil
[16:16] unto the resurrection of
[16:20] damnation
[16:22] now we know in 4th john in john
[16:26] 5 28 and 29
[16:28] that that
[16:30] is not the rapture this is the second
[16:33] resurrection which is one to judgment
[16:37] and damnation
[16:39] and it clearly tells us here
[16:41] because not only the dead in christ
[16:45] will rise from the grave
[16:47] at the time
[16:49] you know praise god we know that when
[16:52] you had the first resurrection
[16:54] the dead in christ
[16:56] rose up
[16:58] along with the living saints
[17:02] because in the rapture and the first
[17:04] resurrection
[17:06] some
[17:08] are already dead having died
[17:11] down through the seven church ages
[17:16] they are the ones that will be raised
[17:20] amen
[17:21] and the saints
[17:23] that are
[17:26] alive at the time the rapture takes
[17:29] place
[17:30] on the earth will be caught up with
[17:34] those ones
[17:36] that were already dead and buried and
[17:40] then raised up together as one group
[17:43] living and dead raised up caught up to
[17:48] meet the lord
[17:50] in the air
[17:51] oh praise god or what a meeting in the
[17:55] air what a meeting that will be my
[17:58] friends when we get together with god's
[18:02] great family praise god hallelujah amen
[18:07] now
[18:08] the bible tells us
[18:10] according to revelation 2011
[18:13] 15.
[18:15] how that the dead were brought before
[18:17] the lord
[18:19] and judged
[18:21] according to their works
[18:24] the first set do not go into a judgment
[18:27] they go into a rapture
[18:30] hallelujah
[18:31] this set
[18:34] of
[18:34] righteous
[18:36] and unbelievers
[18:38] they go into the white tron judgment
[18:43] before
[18:45] the great judge
[18:47] hallelujah
[18:49] now
[18:51] we face the question
[18:53] about these who would be given
[18:56] eternal life
[18:58] at the judgment
[19:01] since the epistles of paul
[19:04] clearly seems to
[19:06] point out
[19:09] amen
[19:11] that there are some found in the book of
[19:13] life
[19:15] who will
[19:17] either receive eternal life
[19:20] before the resurrection
[19:23] or after the resurrection
[19:26] and paul does not evade this truth
[19:30] but he speaks in the word philippians 3
[19:34] 11.
[19:35] if by any means
[19:37] i might attain
[19:40] to the resurrection
[19:42] of the dead
[19:44] hallelujah
[19:45] well we know that we're if we are
[19:48] believers we are all going in a
[19:52] resurrection whether we want to be in
[19:55] the resurrection or not we're going in a
[19:58] resurrection all
[20:00] will be
[20:01] resurrected amen
[20:04] so when paul says
[20:06] oh that i might attain to the
[20:08] resurrection of the dead
[20:10] obviously he's not speaking of the
[20:13] second
[20:14] resurrection
[20:16] no one has to attain to that because all
[20:20] will be raised up at that time to be
[20:23] judged according to their works
[20:26] activities doings
[20:28] but the
[20:29] first
[20:30] resurrection that is what he's speaking
[20:33] of that he wanted to be he was just
[20:35] saying i want to be in the first
[20:37] resurrection i want to be raised up in
[20:40] the first resurrection i don't want to
[20:43] miss it lord friends that should be our
[20:46] prayer also i don't want to miss it lord
[20:49] i want to be in the rapture i want to be
[20:52] in the first resurrection in the
[20:54] presence of the living god hallelujah
[20:58] amen praise god
[21:02] listen
[21:04] blessed and holy is he
[21:06] who had part in the first resurrection
[21:10] on such the second death
[21:12] has no power
[21:14] but there shall be priests of god
[21:18] and of christ
[21:20] and shall reign with him
[21:23] a thousand years hallelujah so the first
[21:27] resurrection
[21:29] the rapture
[21:30] and first resurrection has nothing
[21:33] whatsoever to do
[21:35] with the second death
[21:37] hallelujah for they already have eternal
[21:40] life they have no death in their future
[21:43] no hell in their future no
[21:46] fiery furnace in their future they don't
[21:49] have my friends
[21:51] any such thing in their future their
[21:55] future is clear
[21:57] all that stands before them is to
[22:00] continue to worship and to serve their
[22:04] lord with love with graciousness and to
[22:08] worship his holiness
[22:10] magnify him in his might giving glory to
[22:14] his marvelous and wonderful name praise
[22:17] god praise god hallelujah amen
[22:21] amen
[22:23] this second resurrection
[22:26] comes at the end
[22:29] of the thousand years
[22:33] of the bride and christ
[22:37] honeymoon
[22:39] after the marriage
[22:43] after the wedding is over
[22:46] after they've had a thousand years of
[22:49] millennia
[22:50] amen
[22:52] then
[22:53] is
[22:54] the second resurrection
[22:58] you can see why paul prayed and paul was
[23:01] saying oh i want to attend to the first
[23:04] i i don't want to be in the second
[23:06] because the force already has passed
[23:09] from death to life
[23:11] the second group that comes up with that
[23:14] second resurrection
[23:16] after the one thousand years of
[23:19] millennium
[23:21] will have to stand before the judge with
[23:25] fiery eyes
[23:27] at the
[23:28] white throne
[23:30] judgment
[23:32] now
[23:34] in that day
[23:37] there will be those who come up
[23:40] and come forth to eternal life
[23:44] and there will be the others that are
[23:47] caught
[23:48] in the stranglehold
[23:50] of the
[23:51] second death
[23:55] now we don't need to guess who these
[23:57] people are
[23:59] of these ones who are given
[24:01] eternal life in the presence of god
[24:07] because we are told
[24:08] that they are given them
[24:11] on the grounds
[24:13] that they have been kind
[24:16] and good to the brethren
[24:20] those who are raised and cast into the
[24:23] lake of fire
[24:25] will be treated
[24:27] be so because of their
[24:29] mistreatment
[24:32] of the brethren
[24:34] since this is the word of god we should
[24:38] simply accept what the word of god says
[24:42] for there is no argument
[24:44] here
[24:46] whatsoever
[24:47] as far as god's word is concerned amen
[24:53] hallelujah
[24:54] now think of
[24:56] matthew 25
[24:58] if you will turn in your bibles or take
[25:00] a note matthew 25 31 to 46
[25:07] in it it does not say that a shepherd is
[25:10] literally separating sheep from goats
[25:15] but in it
[25:17] as as a shepherd dividing sheep from
[25:20] goats there are no sheep
[25:23] in this
[25:25] particular
[25:27] time there are no sheep
[25:30] anymore in this particular area of time
[25:34] at the whitetron judgment
[25:36] the sheep are already in the shepherd's
[25:39] fold
[25:40] the sheep have already gone in the
[25:43] rapture
[25:44] this sheep have heeded their shepherd's
[25:47] call
[25:48] they have answered the voice of their
[25:50] shepherd
[25:52] and they've come in to hear is welcome
[25:55] come thou good and faithful servants
[25:59] enter into the joys of your lord so the
[26:03] sheep are already in the storehouse and
[26:06] now we come to the white throne judgment
[26:10] these do not have eternal life
[26:16] the first set
[26:18] who heeded the shepherd's call
[26:22] they have already gone into the fall
[26:25] with eternal life
[26:28] this other group is outside of the fold
[26:32] without eternal life
[26:35] they are in the judgment
[26:38] they are allowed to go but some are
[26:41] allowed
[26:43] to go in
[26:45] to eternal life
[26:47] but upon what grounds
[26:50] do these specific number
[26:53] go in to eternal life
[26:56] certainly not upon the fact
[26:59] that they already have
[27:02] his life in them
[27:04] certainly not
[27:07] they don't have it like the bride had it
[27:10] but they will receive it
[27:13] because they were kind to his brethren
[27:18] amen
[27:19] they are not his brethren
[27:22] but they were kind to his brethren oh
[27:25] thank god
[27:26] they are not his heirs
[27:29] of life whatsoever
[27:33] they do not share
[27:35] his throne
[27:36] with him like the bride
[27:40] but their names
[27:42] must have been on the book of life
[27:45] but not removed
[27:48] their names must have been on the book
[27:51] of life but not
[27:53] removed
[27:54] because of their love
[27:57] for the people of god
[27:59] how they recognize the people of god
[28:04] how they recognize
[28:06] they're truly
[28:07] genuinely born again
[28:11] no doubt
[28:12] they served
[28:14] some of those people of god
[28:18] helped
[28:19] and assisted
[28:22] some
[28:22] of those children of god
[28:26] and perhaps
[28:28] like nicodemus
[28:31] and gamaliel
[28:33] they stood
[28:35] for the children of god
[28:38] in the time of darkness and of trouble
[28:42] god rest their blessed souls
[28:45] i can think of of some
[28:48] of my own life
[28:51] that assisted that help
[28:54] that served that were a blessing
[28:57] that were kind
[28:58] of
[28:59] understanding
[29:01] there was some that be that did not
[29:04] ascribe
[29:05] or to the way
[29:08] of my teaching or preaching
[29:11] but they still
[29:13] loved god his word
[29:16] and recognized
[29:18] the sincerity the truthfulness the
[29:21] honesty
[29:22] the something they couldn't explain that
[29:25] was in the individual
[29:27] and somehow
[29:28] god placed it in their hearts to be kind
[29:32] loving
[29:33] to someone's
[29:35] like that
[29:38] my friends the names of many of those
[29:42] were not blotted out
[29:46] the names of many of those were not
[29:48] destroyed
[29:50] thanks be to god
[29:52] we serve a god rich in mercy
[29:56] we cannot tell him who to give mercy to
[30:00] and whom not to give it to
[30:02] but he will show mercy to whom he will
[30:05] show mercy
[30:07] for he is god the almighty god
[30:11] none before him none beside him and none
[30:14] after him the one true living god
[30:18] jehovah of the old testament jesus
[30:22] christ of the new testament the spirit
[30:25] of god made flesh in christ and reveal
[30:29] himself to the entire world
[30:32] emmanuel
[30:33] god with us blessed be his holy name
[30:37] amen so my friends
[30:40] we thank god
[30:42] for these
[30:44] that uh well that they
[30:47] they were many whose names were blotted
[30:50] out
[30:51] but these people
[30:54] their names were not blotted out
[30:57] or removed amen
[31:00] praise god because they
[31:02] recognized
[31:05] god's people
[31:07] as the living
[31:08] manifested word for their day and for
[31:12] their hour
[31:13] the manifestations of the word
[31:17] oh praise god they were witnesses to the
[31:20] glorious liberty
[31:23] of the manifestation
[31:25] of the children of god
[31:27] hallelujah glory to god
[31:30] now we know at this white tron judgment
[31:33] contrary to the teachings of many
[31:38] nations are not judged
[31:40] before
[31:41] here
[31:43] amen
[31:46] nations are not going into any
[31:49] millennium
[31:50] because they help the jews
[31:52] the millennium is already
[31:54] past
[31:55] and the bride is seated in judgment
[31:58] along with jesus meeting out judgment to
[32:02] the entire world
[32:05] this is very clear
[32:07] because the bible tells us and these
[32:10] wicked
[32:11] shall go away into everlasting
[32:14] punishment the lake of fire
[32:17] but the righteous
[32:19] into
[32:20] everlasting life
[32:23] hallelujah
[32:25] there is no record
[32:27] of two white throne judgments
[32:30] or two judgments
[32:32] no such a thing in the bible anywhere
[32:35] there is one judgment
[32:37] amen that will take place
[32:40] amen and in this judgment my friends
[32:46] we find out
[32:48] that they
[32:49] beast
[32:51] the false prophet
[32:53] being judged
[32:55] but my praise god one judgment
[32:59] and all the wicked will be judged in
[33:02] that judgment for this is the white
[33:04] throne judgment
[33:06] and they're judged
[33:08] according to their activities and deeds
[33:11] of what is written
[33:13] in the books
[33:16] amen
[33:18] we'll clarify this a little later
[33:20] for you'll find that the books is in the
[33:23] book amen are a part of the book
[33:27] now notice
[33:28] this is the second
[33:30] resurrection
[33:33] hallelujah
[33:34] souls under the
[33:37] they altar
[33:37] set forth in the fifth seal of
[33:40] revelation chapter 6 verses 9 to 11
[33:45] and are given
[33:46] white robes
[33:49] and of course
[33:50] eternal life
[33:52] the bible says they're given
[33:55] white robes
[33:56] and
[33:57] eternal
[33:59] life praise god hallelujah now notice
[34:03] carefully
[34:05] none of these under the altar
[34:09] were killed for the testimony of jesus
[34:14] they were not like
[34:16] antipas
[34:17] god's faithful martyr who died for the
[34:21] word and holding fast to his crown and
[34:25] the name of jesus christ
[34:28] these are not born-again ones
[34:32] with eternal life as their inheritance
[34:36] and possessions
[34:38] they come up in the resurrection
[34:42] and they are given or receive eternal
[34:45] life from god
[34:48] because
[34:49] my friends of their works
[34:54] and their faith
[34:57] and their stand
[34:59] upon the word of god
[35:02] they might not have understood all of
[35:04] the word
[35:06] but what they understood of the word
[35:09] they took their stand upon that part of
[35:12] the word and held to god's unchanging
[35:16] hand
[35:17] amen
[35:18] these of course cannot breed a bride for
[35:21] their crying out for vengeance from
[35:23] under the altar
[35:25] amen
[35:26] yes sir but the bride is of the spirit
[35:29] of christ
[35:31] who said father forgive them
[35:34] for they know not
[35:35] what they do
[35:37] so they are not of bright material
[35:40] they are not a bright class or quality
[35:44] amen
[35:45] but they show that spirit
[35:48] of vengeance
[35:49] amen
[35:51] these are jews
[35:54] amen for their fifth seal
[35:57] the bride is already gone in the rapture
[36:01] at that time
[36:03] and these jews are not born
[36:06] of his
[36:07] spirit
[36:08] they don't even believe
[36:11] that jesus
[36:12] is their
[36:14] messiah
[36:15] but
[36:17] as they were blinded by god himself let
[36:20] me repeat
[36:22] as they were blinded
[36:25] by god
[36:27] himself
[36:30] blinded for the gentile sake
[36:33] so that the gentile bride
[36:36] might come in
[36:38] as a grafted branch
[36:41] to bear fruit for his coming glory
[36:45] amen
[36:47] because they were truly faithful to the
[36:51] word that they knew praise god
[36:55] and died for it multitudes of them died
[36:59] for it
[37:00] died for the
[37:02] word of god that they knew he did not
[37:04] allow them to see any more he did not
[37:07] allow them to see the church ages he did
[37:09] not allow them to see
[37:11] the the coming of christ he did not
[37:14] allow them to see jesus coming dying
[37:17] raised up on calvary raised up for our
[37:20] justification that he did not allow them
[37:23] to see and understand the coming of the
[37:26] holy spirit minister the apostles first
[37:29] church age paul right on down to our day
[37:34] even our brother branham
[37:37] wanted to go to israel
[37:39] and to let the gifts of god and the
[37:42] spirit of the voice of god in the in him
[37:46] speak
[37:47] yet the spirit of god says no you are
[37:50] not allowed to go
[37:52] elijah
[37:54] right when he comes again he will be the
[37:57] one that will speak to them
[38:00] amen oh praise god but god bless them
[38:06] for them hell to the word that portion
[38:10] of the word they knew faithfully
[38:13] many died on the hit law tied on the
[38:16] stalin and so on and other places in the
[38:20] world that might not be
[38:23] made
[38:24] large but many millions of them perish
[38:27] and
[38:28] listen to the listen to god's prophet of
[38:32] this 20th century and i want to quote
[38:35] this
[38:36] directly
[38:39] they were truly faithful
[38:42] to all of the word that they knew
[38:47] and they died for it
[38:51] multitudes
[38:52] died
[38:54] that's the holocaust
[38:56] under hitler
[38:59] stalin
[39:02] and
[39:04] will
[39:05] yet
[39:06] die
[39:08] that ending is prophecy
[39:13] that millions will yet die
[39:17] millions of the jews
[39:20] who are holding to
[39:22] that part of the world that they know
[39:25] the rabbis know their wise men no
[39:30] oh they hold to god jehovah's word amen
[39:35] and they'll die for jehovah's word
[39:39] but yet
[39:40] the we are being told
[39:43] millions
[39:45] multitudes of them are yet to die
[39:49] amen
[39:50] now we're talking about the second
[39:52] resurrection
[39:55] not only
[39:57] the
[39:58] righteous dead
[40:01] made up of these
[40:03] foolish virgins
[40:05] made up of
[40:07] the
[40:08] souls under the altar
[40:12] these foolish virgins of course
[40:16] missed
[40:17] the rapture
[40:20] but as the scripture tells us there were
[40:22] virgins to begin with
[40:26] they did not have the holy spirit and
[40:29] missed
[40:30] being in
[40:31] the bride
[40:35] five were
[40:36] wise they had the oil
[40:39] of the holy spirit
[40:41] the light of revelation
[40:44] lamp of god within their lives
[40:48] amen
[40:50] but because these people
[40:53] were a god-loving god-fearing separated
[40:57] clean
[40:58] living people trying to abide into the
[41:02] word of god according to what they knew
[41:05] of it and being a help to god's people
[41:09] and to the work of god
[41:12] that will come up at the end
[41:15] of time
[41:16] and they will miss the millennium
[41:20] but here in this second
[41:22] resurrection
[41:25] some of these
[41:27] will be given
[41:29] eternal life
[41:33] now all these people
[41:35] had their names
[41:37] in the book of life
[41:41] and their names remained in the book of
[41:43] life
[41:47] but whose names were those that did not
[41:50] remain in the book
[41:52] whose names were those
[41:54] that were removed from the book
[41:57] one
[41:59] the world system churches who fought the
[42:02] bride
[42:04] i will be those whose names
[42:07] are removed from the book of life
[42:11] and will be cast
[42:13] into the lake of fire oh what a terrible
[42:17] horrible future for such when we
[42:20] speak against
[42:22] denominationalism when we speak
[42:25] of
[42:26] marrying or aligning yourself with the
[42:30] false prophet false teaching false
[42:34] doctrine of course we know
[42:36] that uh maybe we sound like noah in the
[42:41] art door maybe we sound like alarmness
[42:44] but my friend may god open your eyes
[42:47] that you may heed the warning
[42:50] this may be god's last alter call to
[42:53] your soul
[42:54] amen the devil made sure he sends sent
[42:58] out myriads of men claiming to be
[43:01] ministers of light
[43:03] and said so many things until i i know
[43:06] how it sounds though to some listening
[43:09] but if you're a true genuine
[43:12] child of god there's something that'll
[43:15] strike your soul and you'll recognize
[43:18] that that's the truth that's the word of
[43:21] god give heed to the warning flee to
[43:24] christ while yet there is time to flee
[43:27] that you might come in their first
[43:30] resurrection
[43:31] oh glory to god hallelujah think of it
[43:36] names removed from the cuff life
[43:42] those who are of the world system
[43:45] churches
[43:46] with all manner of doctrines
[43:50] myriads of doctrines under
[43:53] many names
[43:55] of blasphemy against god
[43:59] their names will be blotted out and
[44:01] removed from out of the book of life
[44:06] borderline
[44:08] message believers
[44:10] message christians i should say
[44:13] amen in the message
[44:16] following this prophet's message
[44:19] not catching the fullness
[44:22] of the revelation
[44:24] just going by
[44:26] uh being able to say his words and
[44:30] and and say it all they don't worry
[44:32] about having a revelation of his intent
[44:35] meaning and
[44:36] inferences what inspiration what the
[44:39] holy spirit is trying to say by those
[44:41] words
[44:43] names will be blotted out
