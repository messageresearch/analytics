[42:18] me one second here I'm going to go to
[42:20] the scripture and then we're going to
[42:21] I'm going to make some comments on
[42:23] current events amen praise God um but uh
[42:27] in Romans chapter 9 verses 6 to9 it says
[42:31] not as though the word of God hath taken
[42:33] none effect for they are not all Israel
[42:37] which are of Israel neither because they
[42:40] are the Seed of Abraham are they all
[42:44] children but in Isaac shall thy seed be
[42:48] called that is now pay attention they
[42:52] which are the children of the flesh
[42:55] these are not the children of
[42:59] God pay attention Okay but the children
[43:03] of the promise are counted for the seed
[43:07] Not seeds the seed prophesying speaking
[43:11] about the coming of the Lord amen for
[43:14] This Is The Word of Promise at this time
[43:17] will I come and Sarah shall have a son
[43:21] you may be seated we are going to
[43:23] continue um where we left off uh last
[43:27] time that we ministered back in early
[43:30] February um but before that I just want
[43:32] to make a few comments go uh how many
[43:35] recognized and and know that um on
[43:38] Friday uh it was February the 28th
[43:42] 2025 and that um you can put up that
[43:46] that
[43:47] slide um that you know it was it was a a
[43:52] a planetary alignment that was taking
[43:56] place and now I'm not going to get into
[43:58] you know I'm just these are just opening
[44:00] comments on observations because we've
[44:02] been given the spirit of of God the Holy
[44:06] Ghost which will show you things to come
[44:09] amen and so we've been given the ability
[44:12] to recognize signs and wonders the signs
[44:16] that God places in the heavens these are
[44:18] not things that that that we need to
[44:21] convince us to believe the word of God
[44:24] we've already been enlightened by the
[44:26] holy Spirit we already know that back in
[44:30] 1963 we had a visitation amen of of a
[44:35] supernatural uh uh constellation of
[44:38] angels that that came down to meet with
[44:42] William Mariam Branham who was
[44:44] fulfilling scripture and this took place
[44:46] on February the 28th
[44:49] 1963 here we have a planetary alignment
[44:53] 62 years
[44:55] later amen men 62 years later here now
[45:00] we have this this planetary alignment
[45:03] now what does it say to me and what
[45:05] should it be saying to you is that God
[45:10] always has a purpose in everything that
[45:13] he does and we know that the first Bible
[45:16] that was ever written was written in the
[45:17] heavens and he declares it first in the
[45:20] heavens and then he brings it to pass
[45:21] upon the earth now I'm not going to get
[45:24] into all these seven planets that all
[45:27] lined up from ver from the Virgin all
[45:29] the way to Leo the Lion we could get
[45:31] into all of those types and shadows
[45:33] because it's all there there's a
[45:36] complete study and teaching on all of
[45:38] the of the astronomy and and God's first
[45:41] Bible that was written in the heavens
[45:43] right from Genesis to revelation God is
[45:46] is Elohim he's the self-existent one he
[45:48] can declare himself in any way that he
[45:50] wants amen but I want you to notice
[45:53] these are some observations that I that
[45:55] I noticed
[45:57] and in Revelations I want you to notice
[46:00] here 62 years later so I noticed because
[46:03] God's numerology is perfect too so I
[46:06] took six and two and I add them together
[46:08] and it's eight and I said well the
[46:10] thought came to me Revelations chapter 8
[46:13] Revelations 8 verse1 and when he had
[46:16] opened the seventh seal there was
[46:18] silence in heaven about the space of a
[46:20] half hour and we know that when he came
[46:24] in 1963 I'm talking about the coming
[46:26] coming of the Lord that was the second
[46:29] hello the second coming of the lord
[46:32] they're all waiting on the coming of the
[46:34] Lord they haven't recognized that he's
[46:37] already come he's already here amen and
[46:41] he came to open the mysteries of those
[46:44] Seven Seals and when we see a seven
[46:47] planetary alignment it just reminds us
[46:50] of God's perfect numbers and what he did
[46:53] back in 1963 on the same day February
[46:56] the 2 8 he opened the mysteries of his
[46:59] word it was the coming of the Lord to
[47:03] come and unveil themselves so signs to
[47:05] the church that is uh you know that
[47:08] that's already awake it it it's it's
[47:12] it's it's nothing to us we're already
[47:15] aware we already know what God has done
[47:18] that's what produced this message that's
[47:21] what we're we're preaching on is the
[47:23] revelation of the opening of those Seven
[47:25] Seals right because it made the Bible a
[47:28] new book it unveiled Christ in the
[47:32] present stage of his ministry it brought
[47:34] him to the Earth and they're looking for
[47:36] him to come in the clouds and he already
[47:38] came there's the cloud right there he
[47:41] already came he showed himself and he
[47:43] declared the word he opened all the
[47:46] mysteries of the Bible for what purpose
[47:49] to show the mystery of his coming that
[47:52] it would be a mystery one would be taken
[47:55] one would be left
[47:57] one would be in the field one would be
[47:59] taken one in the bed the other one taken
[48:02] is because he's already called out he's
[48:06] already brought together his church I'm
[48:09] looking at it right here this is not the
[48:12] whole church he he's got a body
[48:14] worldwide that have come to recognize
[48:17] this event and if you go back and
[48:19] actually look into it people online that
[48:21] are listening in and you're not sure go
[48:23] back and prayerfully search and and read
[48:28] about William bram's Ministry it was a
[48:30] progression of the restoration of the
[48:34] churches Martin Luther broke away from
[48:36] the Catholic Church to bring
[48:39] justification John Wesley broke away it
[48:42] started all of the Presbyterian churches
[48:44] and all the the the the Methodist
[48:47] churches and then Pentecost came to the
[48:49] Earth to introduce the gifts of the holy
[48:52] spirit himself but then Christ himself
[48:56] through William branam H an Elijah uh uh
[49:01] Elijah come to introduce the second
[49:04] coming of the Lord Jesus just like the
[49:06] first Elijah John the Baptist introduced
[49:09] the first coming amen praise God you
[49:12] need to go back you need to study amen
[49:14] so we don't need the signs but we
[49:18] recognize the signs we identify with the
[49:21] signs and we need to let the people know
[49:23] of the message of the hour praise God
[49:26] that God has sent a prophet to restore
[49:29] the word and Christ now has come on the
[49:32] scene amen this is what we're going to
[49:34] be continuing to look at here so praise
[49:37] God but uh uh we are we are the sign
[49:42] now because we're the carrier of the
[49:45] word amen we're the ones that that that
[49:47] have recognized what God has done and
[49:50] now we're like the apostles that walked
[49:52] with
[49:53] Jesus they they had recognized the the
[49:56] the the coming of of the Messiah yes
[49:59] only a dozen had actually recognized
[50:01] it's always been that way that's why you
[50:03] try to tell people listen if you've been
[50:07] caught by like the Pharisees were back
[50:09] then they were all under the to all
[50:12] under their own Traditions they by their
[50:15] own Traditions have made the word of God
[50:17] of none effect to the people and that's
[50:20] why all the churches they've taken all
[50:21] their own doctrines and teachings we're
[50:23] going to look at all of that so we
[50:27] we recognize that we've got the Holy
[50:30] Spirit to see Vindicated prophecy just
[50:34] like we see what's going on
[50:36] politically
[50:38] listen we need to
[50:40] recognize that Donald
[50:43] Trump is a
[50:45] political figure that can be typed in
[50:48] the Bible I'm not making Donald
[50:53] Trump some spiritual individual he's a
[50:57] million miles from that he'd have to be
[50:58] born again declaring the message of the
[51:01] hour before I'd even even
[51:06] potentially say okay now we need to get
[51:09] into some fellowship with this guy and
[51:12] see if he's really broken into the
[51:13] revelation of Christ in this hour it
[51:16] would have to go that far but I want you
[51:18] to recognize God raises up Kings and God
[51:22] brings them down and all of the
[51:24] political uh uh field and all the
[51:27] nations and everything that's going on
[51:28] around us open your eyes don't be
[51:32] blinded to to uh uh to the emotional
[51:36] aspects like the like the people in the
[51:38] world listen I don't vote I'm telling
[51:40] you right now I voted for Jesus I don't
[51:43] go to vote for for conservative I don't
[51:46] go to V vote for Liberal they're both in
[51:48] the same pot right they just have two
[51:51] different views of
[51:54] unbelief because they do not recognize
[51:58] Jesus Christ in the present stage of his
[52:00] ministry if they did they'd come out of
[52:03] that political system and they'd want to
[52:06] join into the government that that is
[52:08] going to be upon his shoulders amen
[52:10] praise God but Trump is is you know he
[52:14] can be um typed like like like King
[52:17] Cyrus back in in the Old Testament in
[52:20] that you know God uh laid upon King
[52:22] Cyrus the decree to to to restore the
[52:26] house of the Lord Lord back to to to
[52:28] Israel and he did this and it was after
[52:30] 70 years it was the prophecy of Jeremiah
[52:34] that he said that after 70 years God
[52:36] would restore and God used Osiris who
[52:39] was a
[52:40] pagan he was not he was Gentile he was
[52:43] not uh of Israel he was a pagan just
[52:47] like Trump is a
[52:49] pagan he can he can declare to be a
[52:52] Christian but like 98 99% of the
[52:55] Christian out there
[52:56] if they're not willing to accept the
[52:58] word of God in in Simplicity in the
[53:02] simplest way of saying how are you have
[53:05] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[53:07] believed and they said well what do what
[53:09] do you mean you need to repent be
[53:11] baptized in water knowing what you are
[53:14] doing repenting from the sin that you
[53:16] know that you're a
[53:18] sinner not by being baptized as a baby
[53:21] and this and that and to reject that
[53:23] just goes to show the very essence that
[53:26] they don't don't believe or come under
[53:29] submission to the word of God but listen
[53:33] Trump for
[53:35] example he he he like if if you go back
[53:38] and just just a few things that I picked
[53:40] up okay we were told to watch Israel and
[53:44] we know that Israel came back into her
[53:46] Homeland in 1948 she was declared a
[53:49] nation in 1947 by 48 she had uh uh taken
[53:53] back her Homeland and then she had to
[53:56] fight some some more Wars and in
[53:58] 1967 they had to fight to to to keep
[54:01] their their existence again because they
[54:03] were surrounded and we know the Six Day
[54:05] War God intervened again well 50 years
[54:10] later which in the in the scriptures is
[54:12] a jubilee according to Israel and
[54:15] according to the scriptures in Leviticus
[54:18] they were to they uh president Trump was
[54:21] elected in
[54:23] 2016 to become the 45th president
[54:26] president of the United States of
[54:28] America and it was in 2017 exactly 50
[54:32] years later that Trump was anointed to
[54:36] to declare Jerusalem as the capital of
[54:40] Israel and this was done and you think
[54:45] okay so here now I want you to pay
[54:47] attention here Trump you think that that
[54:50] he was uh looking back into the
[54:53] scriptures into the book of Ezra and
[54:54] saying hey you know what I need to get
[54:57] into my position and I need to become
[54:59] president in 2016 so that in 2017 I can
[55:03] be sworn in as the president and so that
[55:06] at the end of 2017 because it was on
[55:08] December I believe December the 6th that
[55:11] President Trump uh declared Israel the
[55:16] capital and even Netanyahu himself
[55:20] declared and said that we do not forget
[55:23] the decree of King Cyrus in that he he
[55:26] would restore and give back Israel their
[55:30] their their their
[55:32] promise and and even even himself said
[55:35] this man is like a king Cyrus and do you
[55:38] know that Trump was exactly 70 years old
[55:43] when he was sworn into office 70 years
[55:45] was the
[55:47] prophecy and here this man at 70 years
[55:50] old is there in Israel swearing in the
[55:54] Pro uh swearing in and making the decree
[55:56] that that Jerusalem is after so many
[55:58] thousands of
[56:00] years Saints I'm not saying
[56:04] Trump is anything special he is an actor
[56:08] in The Prophecy of the kings of this
[56:12] Earth and even Cyrus if you go back and
[56:15] read it in Cyrus in Ezra chapter 1 he
[56:18] said the Lord hath given me all the
[56:20] kingdoms of the
[56:22] earth it's like Trump he feels like he
[56:26] King of the Earth right now he can
[56:28] declare and say whatever it is that he
[56:30] wants it's going to be this listen like
[56:33] you heard I don't know if you watched
[56:34] what you know that that that that that
[56:36] thing that took place in the Oval Office
[56:38] with uh with the the the the the
[56:41] president of uh
[56:43] Ukraine and and the way that you're not
[56:46] he you could see he was he was like you
[56:48] could see you know you're not you don't
[56:50] have you don't hold the cards my friend
[56:52] I hold the cards you're not in a
[56:54] position to say anything you know
[56:56] declaring himself like a like a king
[56:59] amen so there's an anointing and God is
[57:02] going to need these Kings God is going
[57:04] to need these individuals to be placed
[57:07] into these PL
[57:08] positions he he was Trump was born in
[57:12] 1946 and you would wonder like well you
[57:15] mean God God knows the day you were born
[57:20] and God knows the day you're going to
[57:21] leave this
[57:23] earth he uses what he wants to use
[57:26] just like he rose up uh Nebuchadnezzar
[57:29] Amen to to bring the children of Israel
[57:32] into bondage because of their unbelief
[57:34] God can use who he
[57:36] wants scripturally to do what he wants
[57:40] when he wants amen amen you believe that
[57:43] amen so don't have your have your your
[57:46] your spiritual eyes and your prophetic
[57:50] haton to recognize the events that are
[57:53] taking place around us and realize that
[57:56] we are in the midst of Prophecy being
[57:58] fulfilled right before our very eyes and
[58:01] blessed are your eyes for unto you it
[58:04] has been given to know these Mysteries
[58:07] that are unveiling themselves right
[58:09] before us amen praise God glory to God
[58:15] Amen so let's uh now uh continue i w to
[58:20] I want to do a very quick review of
[58:22] where I left off back on on uh February
[58:26] II it's been almost it's been exactly
[58:29] one month and so we we were looking at
[58:32] the Word of Promise and we saw here from
[58:35] the scripture that we read um that you
[58:38] know that it that that it's the Word of
[58:40] Promise that's what we've recognized
[58:43] amen and so let's let's move along here
[58:45] we read the scripture I want to read a
[58:47] quote here now the first quote if you
[58:49] want to bring it up it's the seed shall
[58:52] not be air with the Shu a lot of what
[58:54] I'm bringing here if you get a chance go
[58:56] back and listen to this message it's it
[58:58] it really if you go back after listening
[59:01] to you know to the ministry you're
[59:03] you're going to be able to see things
[59:05] that you may have not seen before amen
[59:07] for those of you that have well praise
[59:09] God it'll just the Lord will just add a
[59:12] little more to it because the minute you
[59:14] think you've seen it and you've seen it
[59:17] all guess what God does something
[59:20] new he does it over and over again he
[59:24] says now he says now that's what the
[59:26] church is doing today for Jesus is the
[59:29] word and he is the bridegroom and the
[59:33] Bride is a part of the groom therefore
[59:35] the word that is to be fulfilled this
[59:38] day is the same part of the word that
[59:40] was fulfilled in his day now remember
[59:44] the promise uh that that uh Sarah shall
[59:49] bring forth a son it wasn't actually the
[59:53] son
[59:54] Isaac that was that was the
[59:57] natural fulfillment of the promise of
[1:00:00] the word but the seed that he was
[1:00:03] talking about the one that was going to
[1:00:06] to to uh to fulfill the Plan of
[1:00:10] Redemption because remember God had that
[1:00:13] in the back part of his mind and it's
[1:00:15] always been reflected in every type in
[1:00:18] Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the
[1:00:22] way down through the types are
[1:00:24] constantly there Joseph everything
[1:00:26] showing a type of Jesus Christ and him
[1:00:30] coming into his fulfillment into
[1:00:33] fulfilling the Plan of Redemption and so
[1:00:35] for when God separated Adam he was both
[1:00:40] we find out Adam was Spirit to begin
[1:00:42] with he made man in his own image
[1:00:44] created he male and female and then
[1:00:47] Genesis 2 and on he created man Out of
[1:00:50] the Dust of the earth Man was created in
[1:00:52] God's image God is a spirit so he's a
[1:00:56] Spirit man then when he became flesh man
[1:01:00] animal Flesh on the earth he is showing
[1:01:03] portraying here the bride the whole
[1:01:07] purpose of the coming of the Lord to
[1:01:10] coming to the Earth was for the purpose
[1:01:13] of bringing the fullness of himself back
[1:01:17] again remember in the beginning Adam and
[1:01:20] Eve it was just Adam he called their
[1:01:24] name Adam so So Adam and Eve was in the
[1:01:28] spirit man which was God which was
[1:01:31] Elohim the fullness of God and that's
[1:01:34] what he is restoring in this hour then
[1:01:37] when he became flesh man and he is
[1:01:39] showing portraying here the bride he
[1:01:41] never taken and made another being but
[1:01:44] he took part of
[1:01:46] Adam so if you are the church in this
[1:01:50] day you are the second Adam you are
[1:01:54] Christ in Bride form you're the woman
[1:01:58] that he came to restore amen praise God
[1:02:02] Adam's already been restored when Christ
[1:02:04] came now he's restoring Eve back to her
[1:02:08] original position a church withouts spot
[1:02:12] a
[1:02:13] wrinkle that's why this that's why it's
[1:02:15] all you know you hear about people
[1:02:17] thousands of people are going to church
[1:02:19] declaring that they are the bride of
[1:02:21] Christ but God is going to interpret and
[1:02:24] declare himself who bride is just like
[1:02:27] when Jesus Christ came to the Earth all
[1:02:29] the churches of that day they were they
[1:02:32] were putting their own interpretation to
[1:02:34] the point where they when Christ the
[1:02:36] Messiah himself came the word was made
[1:02:38] flesh they called him a
[1:02:41] devil they're doing the same thing
[1:02:44] today amen and he is showing here the
[1:02:47] bride so he never taken and made another
[1:02:50] being but he took part of Adam the
[1:02:51] original creation took from him a rib
[1:02:54] from his side and took the feminist
[1:02:56] Spirit out of Adam to produce
[1:03:00] Eve amen praise
[1:03:03] God therefore part of his Spirit part of
[1:03:06] his body flesh of his flesh bone of his
[1:03:08] bone word of his word life of his life
[1:03:11] and that's the
[1:03:13] bride and and that's the way the bride
[1:03:17] is to Christ we are bone of his bone FES
[1:03:20] you walking on this
[1:03:22] Earth under the anointing of the Holy
[1:03:25] Spirit that you've received the Holy
[1:03:27] Ghost you know that you know that you've
[1:03:30] received it according to the word you
[1:03:32] know that you've your your experience
[1:03:35] identifies with the word of God when
[1:03:37] somebody says to you have you received
[1:03:39] the Holy Ghost since you believe you say
[1:03:40] yes praise God I've received the Holy
[1:03:43] Ghost I was baptized in the name of the
[1:03:46] Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit In
[1:03:48] Me has led me to the message of the
[1:03:51] hour Jesus said when the Holy Ghost has
[1:03:54] come upon you it will guide guide you
[1:03:56] into all truth it'll bring you to the
[1:03:58] truth not to a lie it's not going to
[1:04:01] bring you to a church that's going to
[1:04:02] tell you oh be baptized in the name of
[1:04:05] the father and of the son and they'll
[1:04:06] sprinkle some water on
[1:04:09] you no he's going to bring you exactly
[1:04:13] according to his word because he is the
[1:04:15] word and if the word is in you it's only
[1:04:18] going to identify back to the word it'll
[1:04:21] never go contrary that's what he's
[1:04:24] looking for in this hour We're we're
[1:04:25] going to continue in Galatians 4
[1:04:29] chapter uh 4 verse uh 28 to
[1:04:34] 31 we read here now we Brethren as Isaac
[1:04:39] was are the children of promise okay now
[1:04:43] this is Paul speaking he's talking about
[1:04:46] the children of Promise he's not talking
[1:04:48] about the children of the natural seed
[1:04:53] there's going to be a natural and the
[1:04:55] natural seed is is at emnity with the
[1:04:58] spiritual seed this is what you're going
[1:05:00] to find out but as then he that was born
[1:05:04] after the flesh persecuted him that was
[1:05:07] born after the spirits even so is it now
[1:05:11] you see what Paul is saying here there's
[1:05:14] going to be a struggle when it comes
[1:05:16] right down to it right at the very end
[1:05:19] we heard our pastor talking about it
[1:05:21] last week our former Pastor John Simon
[1:05:23] if you haven't heard that message go
[1:05:25] back
[1:05:27] listen to it it's it's it just lines
[1:05:30] perfectly up with everything that the
[1:05:31] holy spirit is doing there's a
[1:05:34] separation that's taking
[1:05:36] place and and the spirit in the natural
[1:05:39] will never see eye to eye that's why
[1:05:43] you'll struggle in your
[1:05:45] flesh
[1:05:47] nevertheless it said here born after the
[1:05:49] persecuted him that was born after the
[1:05:51] spirit even so is it now nevertheless
[1:05:54] what sayith the scripture cast cast out
[1:05:56] the Bond woman and her son for the son
[1:05:59] of the Bond woman shall not be air with
[1:06:01] the son of the free woman so then
[1:06:04] brethren we are not children of the Bond
[1:06:07] woman but of The
[1:06:09] Free We Are The Promised word We Are The
[1:06:13] Word of Promise that was going to bring
[1:06:16] forth A church not by natural man's
[1:06:19] teachings and and and and doctrines and
[1:06:22] and and denomination it would come come
[1:06:25] forth by a
[1:06:27] supernatural spoken word that would come
[1:06:30] just like that day when I went into
[1:06:32] Gabriel's uh furniture place there I had
[1:06:35] no idea that when he would say are you a
[1:06:37] Christian he didn't realize what was
[1:06:40] writing those words at that moment the
[1:06:43] spirit of God was speaking a a different
[1:06:47] language and it and it quickened
[1:06:49] something within my soul like you when
[1:06:52] you first heard the word of God that
[1:06:54] that that made perfect sense to you and
[1:06:56] you said wait a minute here why why am I
[1:06:58] seeing this why why am I seeing
[1:07:01] different here why all of a sudden has
[1:07:03] the scripture opened up to an
[1:07:06] understanding is because you were not
[1:07:09] natural Church you're the supernatural
[1:07:13] Church you're the one that's going to be
[1:07:15] called according to a to a supernatural
[1:07:18] spoken word it's going to awaken an
[1:07:21] attribute that was in you from before
[1:07:23] you come to this earth you weren't
[1:07:26] called back I wasn't called 30 years ago
[1:07:29] when I came to this message I was called
[1:07:31] before the foundations of the world I
[1:07:33] just needed to come in contact with the
[1:07:36] word with the with the with the uh the
[1:07:38] the the the male Christ he had to come
[1:07:41] and speak seed in and awaken that seed
[1:07:45] which was the female aspect of
[1:07:47] himself to come back to life to come
[1:07:50] back to an awareness of who we really
[1:07:53] are amen praise God
[1:07:56] and
[1:07:57] so uh let's let's move along
[1:08:00] here
[1:08:02] now from all of this I'm just going to
[1:08:04] read the notes that I had from last this
[1:08:06] type is being fulfilled in the church
[1:08:09] today this type of the Bond woman and
[1:08:11] the free woman you're going to struggle
[1:08:14] with this flesh you're going to struggle
[1:08:17] with those that don't have the
[1:08:19] Revelation you're going to struggle with
[1:08:21] your own families that are caught under
[1:08:24] traditions of of Church teachings and
[1:08:27] and and doctrines of man and and uh
[1:08:29] denominational teaching and Buddhism and
[1:08:32] New Age movement you're going to
[1:08:34] struggle with that because that's all
[1:08:37] natural that's all the natural they've
[1:08:40] all their teachings and all their their
[1:08:42] their Revelation comes by reading by by
[1:08:45] intellect by
[1:08:47] learning but God for the Sons and
[1:08:50] Daughters of God it's not learning it's
[1:08:53] revealing amen it's it's God revealing
[1:08:56] himself to you you can't know God no man
[1:09:00] comes Jesus himself says no man comes to
[1:09:03] the father but by me what was he saying
[1:09:06] there you're not going back to
[1:09:08] Elohim the self-existent one but by me
[1:09:13] who is the word for your day you need to
[1:09:17] recognize that I am he just like when he
[1:09:20] went to the woman at the well and he was
[1:09:22] telling her all about her life and then
[1:09:25] she says but wait a minute h a messiah
[1:09:27] would would do these things and he
[1:09:29] looked at her and he says I am he and at
[1:09:33] that moment that attribute that was in
[1:09:35] her awakened to herself who she actually
[1:09:39] was and her testimony just like your
[1:09:42] testimony has converted others to the
[1:09:45] word not converting them by convincing
[1:09:48] them no by by you being a channel to
[1:09:52] speak God's word into their soul and
[1:09:54] awake taken them to who they really are
[1:09:58] amen you don't become a Son of God you
[1:10:00] don't become a daughter of God you
[1:10:02] always were a son or a daughter of God
[1:10:06] but you awaken to your true identity
[1:10:08] amen and that means that that God's seed
[1:10:11] or word must be in Us in order for us to
[1:10:15] be awakened and then we don't live by
[1:10:17] knowledge we live by
[1:10:19] faith we feed on
[1:10:22] Revelation that's why we come to church
[1:10:24] brother Desmond I'm not here to listen
[1:10:26] to man put together quotes and read
[1:10:29] scriptures I I'm interested in what the
[1:10:31] holy spirit is saying through the word
[1:10:34] through the scripture through the quotes
[1:10:37] a revelation of what the prophet said
[1:10:40] not just speaking as a parrot and and
[1:10:44] saying what the prophet said to justify
[1:10:47] no there's a revelation behind every
[1:10:50] quote that we choose to read amen praise
[1:10:54] God and so
[1:10:55] uh it it becomes very clear here that
[1:10:58] the Lord was very clear in the scripture
[1:11:00] when he said the promised word would be
[1:11:03] the promised seed which was Christ he
[1:11:05] was talking about Christ the coming of
[1:11:08] the Lord that would be the Redemption
[1:11:11] the plan amen the promise of
[1:11:14] Salvation and that can never come by the
[1:11:18] law
[1:11:19] because Ishmael came as a result of
[1:11:24] unbelief let's Move Along
[1:11:27] here let's go now because of the
[1:11:30] original sin back in the Garden of Eden
[1:11:34] I want you to see that this unbelief and
[1:11:38] this sin continued all the way down
[1:11:42] right to this day that original sin back
[1:11:45] in the Garden of Eden where the Beast
[1:11:48] where where the serpent went and
[1:11:50] injected his his own word his own
[1:11:53] thoughts his own idea into Eve and
[1:11:56] brought forth Cain it brought forth a
[1:11:59] wild man it didn't bring forth of the
[1:12:03] seed of God Amen it was serpent seed
[1:12:06] that was the original sin and what did
[1:12:08] it do it placed a beastly nature upon
[1:12:12] every man and woman that would ever be
[1:12:15] born by
[1:12:17] sex and every individual that would ever
[1:12:20] come forth would come under this beastly
[1:12:24] nature
[1:12:25] and that beastly Nature has continued
[1:12:28] and moved down all the way down through
[1:12:31] right from Genesis all the way down into
[1:12:34] Leviticus all the way down into uh
[1:12:36] Exodus and and all the way like all
[1:12:39] through the scripture you will see these
[1:12:41] two lineages that have been operating
[1:12:44] constantly fighting one against the
[1:12:46] other amen one look Cain represented
[1:12:51] law Abel represented faith
[1:12:55] had a revelation of what God required
[1:12:57] and he brought the lamb and God accepted
[1:13:00] it because of
[1:13:01] Revelation Hagar she was a bonds woman
[1:13:05] representing the law brought forth all
[1:13:08] kinds of children because look at the
[1:13:10] children of the bondswoman are much more
[1:13:12] than the children of the free that's why
[1:13:15] Israel a small little Nation surrounded
[1:13:18] by 200 million
[1:13:20] Muslims which are the lineage of Ishmael
[1:13:26] am actually the lineage of Cain
[1:13:30] amen if you want to go right back to the
[1:13:32] beginning amen if you want to go even
[1:13:34] further back the lineage of Satan
[1:13:37] amen okay because it's it's a nature
[1:13:41] it's a nature why why why did Cain have
[1:13:43] the nature to go and kill his own
[1:13:45] brother what is that that same wild
[1:13:48] nature operates today I'm not saying
[1:13:51] that every Muslim is has a desire to
[1:13:55] kill and no I'm not saying that but if
[1:13:58] you go back and find the the the the
[1:14:02] seed The Original Seed and we know that
[1:14:06] that you know we're not going to get
[1:14:07] into all of it here but but Abraham was
[1:14:12] ishmael's father so the Muslim people
[1:14:14] they have a claim that Abraham is their
[1:14:16] father and they're right and God blessed
[1:14:19] Ishmael made him many Nation he says
[1:14:22] you're that it'll be a a great nation
[1:14:25] many people actually more than those of
[1:14:28] the free woman Sarah's Isaac's
[1:14:32] lineage but this is what it produced and
[1:14:36] so Sarah she represented the faith to
[1:14:40] believe God's word okay even though
[1:14:43] there was doubt originally she received
[1:14:46] Faith the Bible says in Hebrews 11 she
[1:14:48] received faith for
[1:14:50] strength to bring forth the promised
[1:14:54] word but she actually doubted in the
[1:14:57] beginning and that's why the natural
[1:15:00] seed is not the seed that's
[1:15:04] counted that that that God is the
[1:15:07] natural seed represents natural Israel
[1:15:10] out of natural Israel there will be
[1:15:12] 144,000 that will be brought forth will
[1:15:15] be born and and come forth out of out
[1:15:18] of the natural Israel their time is
[1:15:22] coming but first our time first the
[1:15:25] Gentile church first the Rapture then
[1:15:28] the tribulation then this then then then
[1:15:31] the 144,000 then the tribulation and
[1:15:33] everything else that goes on which leads
[1:15:35] us to the millennial Reign where we come
[1:15:38] back to rule for a thousand years of
[1:15:40] Peace but anyways Israel Jacob
[1:15:42] represented Faith Israel represented the
[1:15:45] law you'll see it all the way through
[1:15:47] Israel law Gentile free amen
[1:15:51] denomination denomination they don't
[1:15:53] realize it they've come under the law of
[1:15:56] doctrines of man's teachings their own
[1:15:59] ideas of teaching the word of God but
[1:16:02] faith is is the message of the hour that
[1:16:05] God sends a a prophet in the last days
[1:16:09] to restore the faith of the children
[1:16:11] back to the original faith of the word
[1:16:13] of God Amen praise God and so we've got
[1:16:16] this struggle that's constantly going on
[1:16:19] so let's let's continue now from where
[1:16:21] we left off and we're going to read the
[1:16:23] next scripture in Genesis 16 16 4-6 I
[1:16:26] want you to see certain things this is
[1:16:27] just laying it all in that's going to
[1:16:29] lead up to you know how we're going to
[1:16:31] finish this message today and he went in
[1:16:34] unto Hagar Genesis 16 and she conceived
[1:16:37] and when she saw that she had conceived
[1:16:40] her mistress was despised in her eyes
[1:16:42] notice that when like Sarah goes and
[1:16:45] tells Abraham listen take my my
[1:16:49] bondswoman that was her unbelief she
[1:16:52] didn't believe the word of God that's
[1:16:54] why a lot of people today they still
[1:16:55] don't believe they want to they want to
[1:16:57] do things naturally they haven't entered
[1:17:00] and received the promise of the word
[1:17:03] which does everything
[1:17:05] supernaturally but notice that when
[1:17:07] Hagar had conceived all of a sudden
[1:17:11] Hagar because of the UN you know that
[1:17:13] Hagar was an
[1:17:14] Egyptian the Bible says she was an
[1:17:16] Egyptian she was she was a
[1:17:19] pagan but she was she was slave to Sarah
[1:17:23] and if Sarah said you go and be with my
[1:17:26] husband she had to obey but the moment
[1:17:28] she got pregnated by Abraham right away
[1:17:31] she started to despise Sarah and Sarah
[1:17:34] saw it see Sarah's unbelief brought
[1:17:37] brought forth trouble yeah amen and if
[1:17:40] you try to do anything naturally you try
[1:17:43] to circum circumvent God's plan for your
[1:17:46] life without coming God's provided way
[1:17:49] in the church allowing the Holy Spirit
[1:17:52] to operate through the proper offices
[1:17:54] the deacons the trustees and and the way
[1:17:57] of God providing your needs you want to
[1:17:58] go and do things on your own way you

[1:18:03] the word of God you're it's going to
[1:18:04] lead to trouble it's going to bring
[1:18:07] forth some wild situations in your life
[1:18:10] amen praise God and here now listen my
[1:18:13] wrong she realized I I I messed up here
[1:18:16] and she goes to her husband she says my
[1:18:18] wrong have I have given my maid unto thy
[1:18:20] bosom and when she saw that she had
[1:18:22] conceived I was despised in she's
[1:18:25] telling Abraham this and the Lord judged
[1:18:28] between me and thee she was coming to
[1:18:30] confess I've messed
[1:18:32] up of but look at what Abraham says he
[1:18:35] says but Abraham said un Behold thy maid
[1:18:38] is in thy hand you do with her as you
[1:18:41] please you got yourself into this
[1:18:44] situation now you try to figure yourself
[1:18:47] a way to get out of this situation and
[1:18:50] this is what we will find ourselves in
[1:18:52] if we're not uh you know coming God
[1:18:54] God's provided way and allowing the Holy
[1:18:57] Spirit to just be still just be still
[1:18:59] and wait on God on the situations in
[1:19:02] your life I don't know what you're going
[1:19:04] through but just be patient wait on the
[1:19:07] Lord amen the Egyptians listen Sarah uh
[1:19:12] uh Hagar she was an Egyptian it was it
[1:19:16] it was the lineage of the midianites and
[1:19:18] they were constantly a thorn in the
[1:19:21] flesh of Israel they would constantly be
[1:19:24] causing trouble trouble they're a type
[1:19:26] of what we'll have to deal with as we
[1:19:28] walk with the Lord in dealing with all
[1:19:31] the unbelief of of of those that have
[1:19:34] accepted man's word instead of accepting
[1:19:37] God's word amen look even Moses was
[1:19:41] under the bondage of of a bondswoman
[1:19:44] when he was under the Egyptian rulership
[1:19:46] of his of of uh of of uh pontier or no
[1:19:51] not pontier um uh Pharaoh's uh sister
[1:19:56] amen and so we we see that uh you know
[1:20:00] but but but notice when Revelation came
[1:20:03] to Moses because in Hebrews 11: 24 it
[1:20:07] says by faith Moses when he come to
[1:20:10] years refused to be called the son of
[1:20:12] Pharaoh's daughter he came into a
[1:20:14] revelation just like you when you
[1:20:16] receive the word of God you come to
[1:20:19] realize wait a minute I'm not the son of
[1:20:21] of Dominic and Ida missil I'm not the
[1:20:24] son of so and so the daughter of so and
[1:20:26] so I'm a Son of God yes this flesh came
[1:20:30] through the procreative ability that was
[1:20:34] given to my parents to bring forth just
[1:20:36] like creation God said let every seed
[1:20:39] bring forth of its own kind and it
[1:20:41] brought forth this body but the person
[1:20:44] the attribute of God that's been
[1:20:46] awakened to recognize who he or she
[1:20:49] really is realizes that they are Sons
[1:20:52] and Daughters of God and they come under
[1:20:55] now the leadership of the word now look
[1:20:57] what Moses he said when he come to the
[1:20:59] years refused to call this to be called
[1:21:01] the son of pharaoh choosing rather to
[1:21:04] suffer
[1:21:05] Affliction with the people of God than
[1:21:07] to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[1:21:09] season look it says esteeming the
[1:21:12] reproach of Christ greater riches than
[1:21:16] the treasure in Egypt in other words he
[1:21:19] was saying for he had respect under the
[1:21:21] recompense of the reward by faith he
[1:21:24] forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of
[1:21:28] the kings in other words Moses would
[1:21:29] rather get the reward from the Lord amen
[1:21:33] then the riches of Egypt he was born
[1:21:36] into Rich he he was brought up wealthy
[1:21:39] he he he was smart he was taught by the
[1:21:42] by the smartest teachers and everything
[1:21:44] else but when the attribute of God
[1:21:47] awakened within him he came to realize
[1:21:50] that he was no longer he he was not an
[1:21:53] Egyptian as a matter of fact he saw the
[1:21:56] the the things that they were doing and
[1:21:58] he went and took the life of an Egyptian
[1:22:01] he stood for what he believed he was not
[1:22:03] willing to submit himself to the to the
[1:22:06] riches of the
[1:22:07] world or the or the acceptance of the
[1:22:11] world over the reward that God has for
[1:22:14] each and every one of us if we stand for
[1:22:17] this word amen praise God hallelujah so
[1:22:22] Satan is is going to con constantly try
[1:22:25] to bring you under the under the control
[1:22:28] of the bondswoman constantly try to
[1:22:31] bring you under
[1:22:32] law try to make you believe this message
[1:22:37] of the hour by law it'll never work God
[1:22:41] is separating his people from under that
[1:22:44] kind of the children of the law will
[1:22:47] will will persecute Children of the
[1:22:51] spirit Children of the faith will always
[1:22:54] be persecuted you're going to be looked
[1:22:55] at well wait a minute what do you mean
[1:22:57] you you you you you don't you don't uh
[1:23:00] you don't fully submit to the prophet of
[1:23:02] William Mary and brandham are you
[1:23:03] kidding of course we do we recognize
[1:23:06] exactly what he did and who he is or who
[1:23:10] he was and who he represented in the
[1:23:13] word of God and what he did to introduce
[1:23:17] Christ to his church and then us back to
[1:23:21] the word back to Christ we need to rec
[1:23:24] recognize that we don't serve this
[1:23:27] message by law there's a lot of people
[1:23:30] that are under the law of this
[1:23:33] message and they're under constant
[1:23:35] condemnation thinking that oh if I don't
[1:23:38] do this right if I don't do that right
[1:23:39] they've made the law of the message how
[1:23:42] you dress they've made the law of the
[1:23:45] message the Cod book if you don't if you
[1:23:48] don't go exactly by what the prophet
[1:23:50] said in the Cod book and what he said
[1:23:52] about this and how he said it and
[1:23:54] everything else then then you're off the
[1:23:56] word they're making the absolute the
[1:24:00] prophet instead of making the word the
[1:24:04] absolute amen how do message Believers
[1:24:08] come into bondage by taking what the
[1:24:10] prophet said without Revelation that's
[1:24:13] true and making it a Doctrine or a
[1:24:20] tradition that's what's going on Saints
[1:24:23] we want to bring this home don't we we
[1:24:25] want to we want to be free we want to be
[1:24:27] completely aware of what this what
[1:24:30] Christ is trying to do in this hour amen
[1:24:32] and how he's doing it all of a sudden
[1:24:34] the Cod book becomes the
[1:24:36] catechism and the rule
[1:24:39] book
[1:24:41] beware you need a revelation of what the
[1:24:44] prophet said amen making the word
[1:24:48] personal you've got to make it personal
[1:24:50] when when you hear the word when you
[1:24:52] read the word when you hear the messages
[1:24:55] you are identifying by
[1:24:57] Revelation understanding what he meant
[1:25:00] in what he was
[1:25:03] saying but when we come to this message
[1:25:06] we come under the school master and it's
[1:25:09] rightfully so that when you first come
[1:25:11] in you know the the the the message
[1:25:14] there's a lot of laws that you know how
[1:25:16] to dress properly how a woman should
[1:25:17] dress and how a man should dress and and
[1:25:20] and you know how we act and and what we
[1:25:23] believe and how we stay pure to the word
[1:25:26] of God and how we honor the word in in
[1:25:29] every aspect amen and and we and we get
[1:25:33] like you know where we get a little bit
[1:25:35] you know under that law you can become a
[1:25:37] little bit starchy and you know but but
[1:25:39] this is not the hour for that this is
[1:25:42] where you could you get completely set
[1:25:44] free from the law the law has to be that
[1:25:47] bonds woman has to be completely kicked
[1:25:49] out the scripture said kick out the
[1:25:52] bonds woman there's Absolut absolutely
[1:25:54] no inheritance between the
[1:25:58] two none none whatsoever amen this is
[1:26:02] the school Master burning out all your
[1:26:05] paganism because a lot of you and we we
[1:26:08] came into this message we were full of
[1:26:10] pagan beliefs and teachings and
[1:26:13] understandings some of us were carrying
[1:26:14] a a a St Christopher over here every
[1:26:17] time we went for a
[1:26:19] [Laughter]
[1:26:21] drive you know all kinds of tradition s
[1:26:24] of of man you know having to do the
[1:26:26] rosary figuring you know if I can do
[1:26:28] this so many times a week I'm going to
[1:26:31] boy oh boy I'm going to be so much more
[1:26:37] blessed making the word of God by the
[1:26:40] traditions of man of absolutely none
[1:26:43] effect to the people to where they're
[1:26:46] putting their trust in their Works
[1:26:49] instead of putting it into the law of
[1:26:52] faith faith is the law law and in the
[1:26:55] law of Faith there is no law because he
[1:26:58] took the law of sin and he nailed it to
[1:27:00] the cross the scripture
[1:27:02] said he took it and nailed the law
[1:27:05] listen the law was only brought in
[1:27:07] because of the beastly nature that was
[1:27:09] on man as a result of the original
[1:27:12] sin and and because of that nature we
[1:27:15] were all like tribes we were all like
[1:27:17] like like wild beasts on the earth we
[1:27:21] would kill if if somebody would take
[1:27:23] something was all like tribal like
[1:27:25] animals you know animals they they they
[1:27:27] you know birds of a feather they flock
[1:27:30] together and animals will stay you know
[1:27:32] like a lion's den you never want to go
[1:27:34] into a lion's den the Lion's you know
[1:27:36] the the the the hunter go the huntress
[1:27:38] goes out brings back the the prey
[1:27:40] Everybody Eats anybody tries to come in
[1:27:43] some of those uh you know those Jackal
[1:27:45] and those wolves will try to come in
[1:27:47] they'll fight them off they'll kill
[1:27:49] them because it's a beastly nature and
[1:27:52] man was worse than the Beast
[1:27:55] and God had to bring some order into
[1:27:57] them and that's why the law had to come
[1:27:59] in but the law is not what God wants us
[1:28:02] to serve him
[1:28:03] by he wants us to be set free so that we
[1:28:06] can serve him because we love him
[1:28:09] because of grace and the love of God and
[1:28:12] what he has done for us amen praise God
[1:28:15] so we come under the bonds Woman by
[1:28:17] making the prophet the absolute instead
[1:28:20] of making the word the absolute and the
[1:28:23] message that that brought and and the
[1:28:25] message that he brought which message
[1:28:28] always pointed to
[1:28:31] Christ not to
[1:28:34] himself listen to The Prophet here in
[1:28:36] birth
[1:28:37] pains he says oh word Believers give in
[1:28:41] to my
[1:28:42] message hear me not not my message but
[1:28:47] his
[1:28:49] message do you hear that amen he says
[1:28:52] Hear Me Not my message Mage but his
[1:28:55] message that he firmly declares to be
[1:28:57] the truth you've got to choose from
[1:29:00] somewhere in other words you've got to
[1:29:02] recognize where truth is coming from
[1:29:06] you've got to choose how you're going to
[1:29:09] H how how the spirit of God is going to
[1:29:11] lead you into all truth how is it it's
[1:29:14] going to lead you to the message of
[1:29:16] Christ look what he says here you can
[1:29:19] sit still after this you've got to make
[1:29:22] your choice don't pay any attention to
[1:29:24] the
[1:29:25] messenger he's talking about himself
[1:29:28] here he says look at the message it is
[1:29:32] pay attention to what I'm saying the the
[1:29:35] word that's being spoken he says it
[1:29:37] isn't that don't notice this look he
[1:29:39] says little baldheaded you know person
[1:29:43] cuz it's just it's just a human being
[1:29:46] all and we're just all the same you see
[1:29:50] what he's saying here I'm not belittling
[1:29:53] the prophet by bringing you this
[1:29:56] quote I'm quoting the prophet I want you
[1:29:59] to understand that he had a
[1:30:01] revelation of who he was he knew listen
[1:30:05] you don't think he knew that he was
[1:30:06] Malachi 4 that he came to a place where
[1:30:10] he recognized that he was the the the
[1:30:12] angel that was to be on the earth to
[1:30:14] fulfill Revelations 10 1-7 when he said
[1:30:17] that that angel would be on the earth at
[1:30:20] that time when the second coming of the
[1:30:22] Lord would come and he was the Elijah
[1:30:25] that Jesus spoke about when he said
[1:30:27] Elias shall surely come and then notice
[1:30:31] what he said and Elias has already come
[1:30:34] it's because there's five comings of
[1:30:36] Elijah all the way to the very end he's
[1:30:39] going to come again when he comes with
[1:30:42] Moses to the children of Israel to the
[1:30:45] 144,000 to do what to preach this
[1:30:48] message Amen to preach that Jesus Christ
[1:30:52] the Messiah has already come and you
[1:30:55] missed him and then he's going to come
[1:30:57] and reveal himself to the 144,000 but
[1:31:00] you and I we're going to be gone for
[1:31:02] three and a half
[1:31:04] years for that meeting in the
[1:31:07] air and that's what this message today
[1:31:11] and what we feed on is producing in our
[1:31:13] lives faith for the Rapture Faith to to
[1:31:18] be taken out of here for these bodies to
[1:31:21] these mortal bodies to to to put on
[1:31:23] immortality it amen and he says so but
[1:31:26] but watch what's happening that's what
[1:31:28] declares it I was taken now I know
[1:31:31] people say all kinds of things and we
[1:31:34] know that a lot of it's not right he's
[1:31:37] talking about what the people were
[1:31:38] saying about him making him
[1:31:40] God making him more than what he was he
[1:31:44] wanted the people to to not take their
[1:31:47] eyes off of
[1:31:49] Christ the word that's what he was
[1:31:52] introducing when when those seals were
[1:31:55] being opened in 1963 he was introducing
[1:31:58] the coming of the Lord so that the
[1:32:00] attention of the people would now go to
[1:32:03] recognize that he was here now and why
[1:32:07] did William brandham have to go off the
[1:32:09] scene same reason that John the Baptist
[1:32:11] had to go off the scene people say oh
[1:32:14] why did God allow William Brenham to to
[1:32:16] be in a head-on collision that would end
[1:32:18] up taking his life well why did God
[1:32:21] allow Herod
[1:32:24] his wife to have John the Baptist head
[1:32:27] seared off and put on a platter and
[1:32:31] delivered at a
[1:32:33] feast we don't question how God does
[1:32:36] things you see those things people will
[1:32:39] take those things and they will
[1:32:42] immediately uh I can't believe a God
[1:32:44] that would allow something like that I I
[1:32:46] can't believe a God that would do this I
[1:32:48] can't you need to settle down and read
[1:32:53] the scriptures
[1:32:54] and understand the Plan of Redemption
[1:32:57] why is salvation
[1:32:59] needed you tell me is the world out
[1:33:03] there looking like it's getting
[1:33:06] better you got Wars you got thousands
[1:33:09] millions of people being killed in
[1:33:11] Wars what's going on in in Gaza what's
[1:33:14] taking place over the last year and a
[1:33:16] half all these War what's going on in
[1:33:19] Ukraine what's bubbling in the Middle
[1:33:22] East all these things you tell so so
[1:33:27] what is there not a
[1:33:29] God there's a Satan it's quite obvious
[1:33:34] because he's destroying the world and
[1:33:36] and every he's turning as many people
[1:33:38] against as many as he possibly
[1:33:41] can so if you recognize the darkness of
[1:33:44] this world you need to recognize that
[1:33:47] there's a God that's going to save
[1:33:49] people from that
[1:33:51] darkness and from that great tribul
[1:33:53] ation and the wickedness that's coming
[1:33:56] upon the
[1:33:58] Earth that's what the message of
[1:34:00] Salvation is all about so he says I know
[1:34:03] what people say all kinds of things and
[1:34:05] we know that it's a lot it's not right I
[1:34:07] can't answer for what others or any man
[1:34:10] says I got to answer for what I say amen
[1:34:14] I can only say what's whether it's truth
[1:34:16] or not and I'm the one he has to be
[1:34:20] responsible for it not what somebody
[1:34:23] else said says I can't judge no one I
[1:34:26] wasn't sent to judge but to preach the
[1:34:30] message Hallelujah aren't you glad that
[1:34:32] God gave our Prophet a revelation of who
[1:34:35] he was and that he would not have to now
[1:34:38] uh uh you know come under uh this you
[1:34:41] know because he came to realize he
[1:34:44] realized that the people were starting
[1:34:45] to call him they were saying my God
[1:34:47] don't no man could do the G the the the
[1:34:49] the the supernatural healings and and
[1:34:52] and miracles that were he was Raising
[1:34:55] Dead documented go back and look into it
[1:34:59] there's affidavits that are signed by
[1:35:01] doctors showing that this man William
[1:35:04] brandham not him it was God just like
[1:35:08] the signs and the stars in the heavens
[1:35:10] God sends signs and wonders so that they
[1:35:13] can be drawn to the attention of the
[1:35:15] word you got to go back to see why God
[1:35:18] was doing these Miracles through this
[1:35:20] man's Ministry and then listen to the
[1:35:22] messages that he preached while he was
[1:35:24] doing having those prayer lines and God
[1:35:27] was doing all of those Miracles through
[1:35:29] the man you need to go and search that
[1:35:32] and see why did he do all of this
[1:35:36] there's so much you know God woke me up
[1:35:38] in the middle of the night last night I
[1:35:39] was laying in bed from 3: until about
[1:35:42] 4:30 and I couldn't stop my mind he was
[1:35:46] taking me from before the foundations of
[1:35:49] the world Genesis all the way down
[1:35:51] through all the scriptures I can't even
[1:35:54] bring back to you what was flowing
[1:35:56] through my mind but everything all the
[1:35:59] how William bram's Ministry Branham b r
[1:36:03] a n h a m seven letters Abraham the
[1:36:08] faith of Abraham abbr seven letters how
[1:36:11] there was two Messengers that went into
[1:36:14] all these things were flowing through my
[1:36:15] mind and I'm saying oh my God Lord let
[1:36:17] me go to sleep please and all these
[1:36:19] things constantly flowing showing
[1:36:22] vindicating all of this that that that
[1:36:25] that the Earth has not woken up to see
[1:36:28] what's going on right now and to
[1:36:31] recognize God Vindicated William brandom
[1:36:34] in so many ways that that it's just
[1:36:37] mindboggling two Messengers went into
[1:36:40] Sodom Sodom and Gomorrah was sodomy is
[1:36:45] is homosexualism lesbianism it was at
[1:36:49] the heights when when God appeared to
[1:36:52] Abraham and went supernaturally appeared
[1:36:55] to Abraham sent those two angels into
[1:36:57] Sodom and Gomorrah to to Blind the
[1:37:00] people because God was going to destroy
[1:37:02] the sin all of a sudden I saw a i DS
[1:37:08] AIDS as in days Sodom what was AIDS it
[1:37:14] was a curse it was a disease that that
[1:37:17] came out of
[1:37:19] homosexualism out of sodomy out of the
[1:37:21] lesbianism all these things were just
[1:37:23] flowing through my mind and I was saying
[1:37:25] what is all of this Lord and it was just
[1:37:28] showing how the whole world has fallen
[1:37:31] into
[1:37:32] complete where we are now again as in
[1:37:35] the days of Sodom where sodomy they've
[1:37:38] taken it and they've they've perverted
[1:37:40] the word of God I can show you
[1:37:43] scriptures that absolutely condemns it
[1:37:46] right in the Book of Revelation God said
[1:37:48] if you see a man with another man burn
[1:37:51] them
[1:37:53] destroy that that unbelief amen he
[1:37:56] didn't permit it it was because it was
[1:37:59] Adam and Eve and one thing that I can
[1:38:02] say that Trump did which was really good
[1:38:06] and that's the anointing of the holy
[1:38:08] spirit because it's the age where the
[1:38:10] bride comes back to her rightful
[1:38:12] position as a woman in the church he
[1:38:16] said there's two
[1:38:17] genders male and female Adam and Eve the
[1:38:22] word is being restored amen and the Eve
[1:38:26] is being fully restored to recognize who
[1:38:28] she is praise God never mind all these
[1:38:31] alternate genders that's all unbelief
[1:38:36] it's all man's interpretation it's all
[1:38:39] men burning it's it's it's it's just
[1:38:42] total uh uh
[1:38:45] Abomination you got to call Sin what it
[1:38:47] is amen praise God because this is the
[1:38:50] hour where God's going to have a church
[1:38:52] that's going to stand on the word
[1:38:55] regardless regardless who you got to
[1:38:57] tell you might have listen I don't
[1:38:59] condemn those people absolutely not
[1:39:03] because it's not the people it's the
[1:39:06] spirits that are operating from the
[1:39:08] river Euphrates millions of spirits have
[1:39:10] come out and they're possessing the
[1:39:12] people possessing their minds possessing
[1:39:15] their hearts taking control because they
[1:39:17] don't want to submit to the word of
[1:39:19] God but if you make the word you're
[1:39:21] absolute that h ual spirit will leave
[1:39:25] you because you got to go back to your
[1:39:27] original of what you were before you you
[1:39:30] came into this world Amen praise God
[1:39:32] hallelujah glory to God Amen let's let's
[1:39:35] move on here because we're going to wind
[1:39:37] this down now he says here in the next
[1:39:40] quote the seed shall not be here with
[1:39:42] the Shu he says now the stock the tassel
[1:39:45] the Shu notice Hagar here represented
[1:39:47] the stock which was the first life that
[1:39:50] started in the promise remember God goes
[1:39:53] to Abraham says you're going to have a
[1:39:56] son 25 years
[1:39:58] later everything starts coming about but
[1:40:02] the first son that comes forth out of
[1:40:05] Abraham comes by unbelief she
[1:40:07] represented the stock Sarah represents
[1:40:10] the tassel or the pollen comes in the
[1:40:12] tassel but now pay attention Mary the
[1:40:15] Virgin represented and produce the true
[1:40:18] spiritual seed to bring forth the real
[1:40:21] true stock Hagar Sarah both by sex and
[1:40:27] that's why there has to be a church that
[1:40:32] will that will be produced like the
[1:40:35] original church back in the
[1:40:37] beginning without
[1:40:40] sex Satan perverted it when the when the
[1:40:43] serpent went and injected his seed
[1:40:46] through sex into the into the womb of
[1:40:49] Eve to bring forth a a son who would be
[1:40:53] a wild son who would end up being a
[1:40:55] murderer who was a murderer from the
[1:40:57] beginning because his seed came from
[1:40:59] Satan it was serpent seed it wasn't
[1:41:02] Adam's
[1:41:03] seed it was because of God's law of
[1:41:06] procreation and Satan took advantage of
[1:41:09] that law let every seed bring forth so
[1:41:12] he said oh wait a minute here I can
[1:41:14] bring forth my own seed and I can be
[1:41:17] worshiped like God is being worshiped I
[1:41:20] can create a people that'll worship me
[1:41:21] just like God is creating a people that
[1:41:23] will worship
[1:41:24] Him Glory to God Amen Sarah so Mary the
[1:41:28] Virgin represented and produced the true
[1:41:31] spiritual seed to bring forth the real
[1:41:33] true stock Hagar Sarah both was by sex
[1:41:38] but Mary the Virgin was by the power of
[1:41:42] God's promised word by virgin
[1:41:49] birth he's doing it again thank you
[1:41:52] glory to God he's doing it again Saints
[1:41:55] Hallelujah she brought forth the genuine
[1:41:59] seed that was the seed that God was
[1:42:03] talking about that that that would be
[1:42:05] the promised
[1:42:07] word remember Sarah brought forth the
[1:42:10] lineage of Isaac Jacob and so forth
[1:42:13] natural Church natural but the
[1:42:15] supernatural Church the spiritual church
[1:42:18] the one that's going to have to go in
[1:42:19] the Rapture by a supernatural body
[1:42:22] change she is not going to do it
[1:42:24] naturally they're trying to go to Mars
[1:42:26] they're trying to go to these planets
[1:42:28] they're trying to build spaceships they
[1:42:30] want to create molecular uh you know
[1:42:33] these things that they're that they're
[1:42:34] trying to uh create like a Rapture uh
[1:42:37] process and they're man trying to
[1:42:40] produce eternal life trying to break in
[1:42:43] to the other dimensions and all of these
[1:42:44] things they're never going to do it it's
[1:42:48] never going to produce anything you've
[1:42:51] got to come back to the word of God God
[1:42:53] God's Plan of
[1:42:55] Redemption that's what's important in
[1:42:57] this hour amen praise God and so the
[1:43:00] stock Hagar the second wife was by doubt
[1:43:03] of the promise working through a doubt
[1:43:06] slightly I just hope may God help us
[1:43:09] listen to what he's saying here may God
[1:43:11] help us to see here that it's not a
[1:43:13] natural birth it's not by joining a
[1:43:16] church it's not by your works it's not
[1:43:19] by how good of a Christian you might
[1:43:21] think you want to make yourself
[1:43:23] this comes by a supernatural Revelation
[1:43:27] that God reveals himself to
[1:43:29] you you've got to you've got to make
[1:43:32] yourself open to the Revelation that all
[1:43:34] things are possible Lord have your way
[1:43:37] like Mary said be it unto me according
[1:43:40] to Thy word let your word take
[1:43:42] preeminence amen I just hope may God
[1:43:45] help us I don't I want you to see this
[1:43:47] so bad you cannot slightly doubt any of
[1:43:51] it the minute that you say oh I don't
[1:43:54] need to be baptized in water in the name
[1:43:57] of the Lord Jesus you've just doubted
[1:43:59] the word you've just identified where
[1:44:02] you fit in the whole
[1:44:05] plan and unfortunately if you're not
[1:44:07] identified by the holy ghost in the word
[1:44:10] of God and coming under obedience to the
[1:44:13] word of God you're going to identify
[1:44:15] with the traditions of man and all of
[1:44:18] that all of that is being bundled for a
[1:44:21] purpose all the the because those are
[1:44:24] not wheat that's not the wheat remember
[1:44:27] the Original Seed is the word of God and
[1:44:30] that that seed that's being gathered
[1:44:32] into the barn for Christ there's another
[1:44:37] terar group because the tears are those
[1:44:40] that are that that that that claim to be
[1:44:42] Christians but they are actually the
[1:44:45] tears they don't believe the they've
[1:44:46] made the word of God of none
[1:44:48] effect they don't they deny the power of
[1:44:51] God what what is the power of God the
[1:44:54] Holy Ghost I will send to you power from
[1:44:59] on high what is the power the power is
[1:45:02] the Holy Ghost and to reject the word of
[1:45:05] God and say I don't need to be baptized
[1:45:07] I don't need to submit to the word I
[1:45:09] don't need to believe God's Messengers
[1:45:11] do you know that if they didn't follow
[1:45:14] Joshua into the promised land they
[1:45:18] perished in the wilderness true they all
[1:45:21] perished because of what
[1:45:24] unbelief they were not they they saw the
[1:45:26] pillar of fire they witnessed all the
[1:45:28] Miracles they saw everything that God
[1:45:31] was doing in their midst but yet when
[1:45:33] Joshua which is who is now on the scene
[1:45:36] this is the Joshua Commission because
[1:45:38] after Moses which William brandham was a
[1:45:40] type of Moses calling the people out of
[1:45:43] denominational
[1:45:44] bondage it was the Joshua commission
[1:45:47] that placed the children of God into the
[1:45:49] promised land amen and they recognized
[1:45:52] that they were were under the the
[1:45:53] leadership of Joshua and when they saw
[1:45:55] the Giants that they had to face they
[1:45:58] said we're more than able why because
[1:46:01] they were under the leadership of Joshua
[1:46:04] they knew that God was with Joshua
[1:46:06] because God said as I was with Moses so
[1:46:10] shall I be with thee he says just be
[1:46:13] strong and of good courage and go forth
[1:46:16] and take whatever God has shown you as
[1:46:19] yours amen praise God H glory to to God
[1:46:23] Amen let's we got to move on here amen
[1:46:26] praise God let's go to the next slide
[1:46:29] now Hagar by one little slight
[1:46:32] difference through woman not through
[1:46:34] Abraham now Abraham didn't want to do it
[1:46:38] but God let him do it because he same
[1:46:41] thing he let balum go on you can go
[1:46:44] God's permissive will if you want you
[1:46:46] can deny you can say oh don't listen to
[1:46:48] Danny don't listen to this don't listen
[1:46:50] to Tim don't listen to Mike don't listen
[1:46:52] to and you know they're they're talking
[1:46:54] about a message don't don't pay
[1:46:56] attention on Facebook to those messages
[1:46:58] about this cloud and this and that no
[1:47:00] you need to pay attention you need to
[1:47:03] recognize amen glory to God Abraham
[1:47:05] didn't want to do it but God let him do
[1:47:08] it because same thing he let balum go on
[1:47:11] now notice by slightly differing with it
[1:47:13] she brought forth Ishmael which was a
[1:47:16] wild man never conquered he lived by his
[1:47:19] bow he was a wild man he is yet today
[1:47:23] and I can say he is yet today that
[1:47:25] spirit is a wild Spirit now Sarah the
[1:47:28] tassel or the pollen Sarah the true wife
[1:47:31] of the promise brings forth a gentle man
[1:47:34] in return brought forth a promised
[1:47:37] Nation the nation of Israel now but
[1:47:41] Mary I'm talking to Mary's group here
[1:47:44] today Mary no sex no injection of man's
[1:47:48] doctrines not coming under I'm a
[1:47:51] Catholic I'm a Baptist I didn't ask you
[1:47:54] I said are you a Christian no no I I'm a
[1:47:57] presbyterian I'm a Jehovah Witness I'm a
[1:48:00] Buddhist no I'm not asking you that are
[1:48:04] you a
[1:48:05] Christian do you believe God's word amen
[1:48:08] praise God hallelujah Sarah a true wife
[1:48:12] of the promise brings forth a gentleman
[1:48:15] in return brought forth a promise Nation
[1:48:17] now but Mary no sex but through a
[1:48:21] promise just like Abraham got the
[1:48:23] promise from God and the word of God but
[1:48:25] believed the promise behold the handmade
[1:48:29] of the Lord see she she came to realize
[1:48:33] she was just she she had Faith to bring
[1:48:36] forth Jesus Christ didn't realized that
[1:48:39] that it was actually in her that that
[1:48:41] that she could actually believe it amen
[1:48:44] but it was in her and God is is saying
[1:48:47] is it in
[1:48:48] you are you able to stand in the day
[1:48:52] where where the the Holy Spirit now
[1:48:53] comes directly personal to you thank you
[1:48:56] Lord can you say be it unto me according
[1:48:59] to to to Thy word behold the handmade
[1:49:01] see brought forth not a stock but the
[1:49:04] original seed for he was the word that
[1:49:07] Abraham believed and that Mary believed
[1:49:11] glory to God see she had a revelation
[1:49:15] and here now go to the next slide we're
[1:49:16] going to we're going to I got to finish
[1:49:18] this he that this great mystery of God
[1:49:21] made known understands
[1:49:23] now he that that understands the hour
[1:49:25] that we're living in the message that
[1:49:28] we've received the prophet of Malachi 4
[1:49:31] the opening of The Seven Seals the
[1:49:33] understanding of the seven Church ages
[1:49:35] The Messengers to all those ages you
[1:49:37] need to go back there's way too much
[1:49:39] here that I could possibly bring sorry I
[1:49:42] left off those two Messengers that went
[1:49:44] into Sodom that was Billy gram and Oral
[1:49:48] Roberts just so you can know you know I
[1:49:51] I got sidetracked back there but the
[1:49:53] Lord brought me back to that cuz he
[1:49:54] wants you to know that that they were
[1:49:57] they would go Graham was g r a h a m
[1:50:02] six six letters Roberts r o b e r
[1:50:08] TS
[1:50:10] six you got to see that it was man that
[1:50:13] was denominational teaching Billy Graham
[1:50:17] had a tremendous Ministry but it didn't
[1:50:20] bring the people back to the word it was
[1:50:23] just a Protestant teaching that
[1:50:25] everybody can be a Christian just like
[1:50:27] Billy Graham's son went and prayed right
[1:50:30] before right there at the presidential
[1:50:34] inauguration it's it's it's they they're
[1:50:37] they're they're claiming the word of God
[1:50:39] but they're so far from the absolute
[1:50:42] pure and adulterated word of
[1:50:44] God Amen why because they were sent in
[1:50:47] to Blind the people amen but who was
[1:50:51] with Abraham
[1:50:53] the angel himself Christ talking with
[1:50:56] Abraham and Abraham saying but what if
[1:50:58] there's hundred in there will you not
[1:51:00] destroy he says what if there's 10 what
[1:51:02] if there's he brought them all he says I
[1:51:03] want this because there was
[1:51:05] none all that brought out was lot and
[1:51:08] his family and even Sarah and and Lot's
[1:51:11] wife looked back when she was coming out
[1:51:14] of the world and she was turned into a
[1:51:15] pillar of
[1:51:17] salt lot just a type of those that are
[1:51:20] going to have to go through the
[1:51:21] tribulation
[1:51:23] but not the
[1:51:24] Abraham messenger who stood there and
[1:51:28] and said that this Abraham faith is
[1:51:31] going to bring forth a seed that's going
[1:51:33] to bring forth a bride that's going to
[1:51:35] go in the Rapture that is not going to
[1:51:36] go through when Sodom and Gomorrah is
[1:51:40] destroyed amen praise God hallelujah so
[1:51:43] he that this great mystery of God made
[1:51:45] known understands how that God was in
[1:51:47] Christ reconciling himself to the world
[1:51:50] how that he and the father were one how
[1:51:53] that the great mysteries of fulfilling
[1:51:55] of God taking and bringing himself
[1:51:58] manifested in the age of human beings
[1:52:01] God manifesting now in in our age in
[1:52:05] human beings amen and in the strain of
[1:52:09] human being and in the company of human
[1:52:11] beings to make his word manifested in
[1:52:14] the day in the Eastern rising of the Sun
[1:52:18] and to do the same things as the sun
[1:52:20] sets in the west to make make himself
[1:52:23] manifested in a bride Church in a church
[1:52:28] for this
[1:52:29] hour the word made manifest see it will
[1:52:33] be too he that understandeth that is
[1:52:38] known that's being revealed to him
[1:52:40] remember I said this is not something
[1:52:42] you learn I'm not here as a teacher to
[1:52:46] teach you about the word of God I'm here
[1:52:50] to show you in the scripture ures so
[1:52:54] that God by the by the preaching of the
[1:52:56] word by the foolishness of preaching the
[1:52:59] spirit of God will ride the word into
[1:53:01] your heart and open the understanding
[1:53:03] reveal
[1:53:04] himself to you personal amen amen him
[1:53:08] that sent me has everlasting life and
[1:53:10] will not come into the Judgment but is
[1:53:12] passed from Death unto life amen praise
[1:53:17] God glory to God Amen let's go to the
[1:53:19] next one here we're just gonna read
[1:53:21] these quotes and we're gonna
[1:53:23] we're going to finish off here the true
[1:53:25] seed come forth from
[1:53:29] Mary I want you to pay attention here as
[1:53:31] we we
[1:53:33] close it came from Mary but it was not
[1:53:36] her seed you need to understand Mary
[1:53:39] they want to call Mary the Mother of God
[1:53:41] God can't have a mother God doesn't have
[1:53:43] a
[1:53:45] father it was the Holy Spirit it was the
[1:53:48] it was the Holy Ghost that overshadowed
[1:53:51] her and placed in Mary both male and
[1:53:55] female the fullness of the seed of Jesus
[1:54:01] Christ she was only a
[1:54:04] carrier but she had it was the promise
[1:54:07] of God that she said behold the
[1:54:11] handmaiden of the Lord and God's got a
[1:54:14] people on Earth
[1:54:15] today that have recognized that it's
[1:54:18] going to be Christ by a Rapture by a
[1:54:21] supernatural revelation of rapturing
[1:54:24] faith that is going to transform your
[1:54:27] life it's going to bring you out of the
[1:54:29] bondage that you're in many are still in
[1:54:32] the bondage of of of of this bondswoman
[1:54:36] of believing that because I belong to a
[1:54:38] message and I and I've just and I've
[1:54:40] heard that a prophet came that's good
[1:54:42] enough no you need to come into contact
[1:54:45] with the the the the the male you've got
[1:54:48] Jesus said listen many are going to come
[1:54:50] to him on that day and say Lord Lord
[1:54:53] have I not prophesied in your name have
[1:54:55] I not you know he's going to say I never
[1:54:58] knew you he's going to say I never
[1:55:01] injected you with my seed I never my
[1:55:03] word was not in you you took the word of
[1:55:07] man you took the word of teachings of
[1:55:09] doctrines of man you were not a pure uh
[1:55:13] unadulterated seed word of God that
[1:55:15] would take the pure word of God Amen
[1:55:17] behold the handmaiden of the Lord the
[1:55:20] carrier of life was the woman and now
[1:55:22] Mary the seed so much closer Hagar had
[1:55:25] to receive it in a perverted way Sarah
[1:55:29] doubting thing brought it just a natural
[1:55:32] seed through sexual desire but Mary
[1:55:35] without any sex at all believed the word
[1:55:38] and the Word was made
[1:55:41] flesh and that's how it's coming forth
[1:55:43] in our lives it has to be by that it has
[1:55:47] to be but notice Mary being so close she
[1:55:50] held the seed in her womb
[1:55:52] and it looked like it would be her seed
[1:55:55] and so has the Pentecostals and and here
[1:55:58] we are in the message of the hour and it
[1:56:00] looks so close that everybody people
[1:56:03] claiming I'm in the message I'm in the
[1:56:05] message and they're going off and and
[1:56:07] and some are saying oh if you don't
[1:56:09] listen only the tapes you're lost if you
[1:56:12] don't if you don't say exactly what the
[1:56:13] prophet said you're lost they're they're
[1:56:16] not recognizing that the that Christ
[1:56:19] himself is in the midst of the people
[1:56:23] and she that that true church will not
[1:56:26] be deceived because she operates by
[1:56:28] Revelation she doesn't operate by the
[1:56:31] teachings of man and so notice Mary
[1:56:34] being so close she held the seed in her
[1:56:36] womb and it looked like it would be her
[1:56:38] seed and so has the Pentecostals I'm
[1:56:41] going to come home but remember Jesus
[1:56:43] said in Matthew 24 chapter he said in
[1:56:47] the last days the two Spirits not in the
[1:56:50] early days but now in the latter times
[1:56:53] the two Spirits would be so close
[1:56:56] together until it would deceive the very
[1:56:58] elected if it were possible Pentecostal
[1:57:01] Spirit just exactly like the real thing
[1:57:05] so perfect that it would deceive the
[1:57:06] very elect if it were
[1:57:09] possible but the
[1:57:11] true
[1:57:13] bride that's received
[1:57:16] Christ in this day and in this hour will
[1:57:19] not be deceived she will not not follow
[1:57:24] let the musicians
[1:57:28] come I got all this right from that
[1:57:31] message the seed shall not be a with the
[1:57:33] shock now it's got to come right
[1:57:35] straight back to that original
[1:57:38] Ministry he says here go to the next
[1:57:41] slide it's got to come right back to
[1:57:44] that original Ministry that he had here
[1:57:46] on Earth because it's the
[1:57:49] bride they are one now he promised in
[1:57:52] the last days how these things would
[1:57:53] happen and we see them happening like
[1:57:56] all the promises Malachi 4 go back check
[1:57:59] the scriptures Luke
[1:58:01] 17:30 in the day when the son of man is
[1:58:04] being revealed and how many more
[1:58:06] scriptures it' be endless he says here
[1:58:09] he says but go on he says but
[1:58:12] watch in the in the invisible Union but
[1:58:14] watch when the spiritual bride when a
[1:58:18] people come to realize when she begins
[1:58:21] to have a Revival
[1:58:22] and I believe that there's only one
[1:58:24] Revival that's happening right now and
[1:58:27] it's the bride's
[1:58:28] Revival it's the true church Revival
[1:58:31] it's the one that's separating that's
[1:58:34] being being uh uh that's leaving the
[1:58:37] rest
[1:58:38] behind not because she's trying to be
[1:58:41] something not because she's trying to
[1:58:43] make herself something she realizes that
[1:58:47] she can only be led by the spirit amen
[1:58:50] she can only be
[1:58:52] anointed by the word of God her
[1:58:55] understanding is open to see the
[1:58:57] prophecy that's happening around her
[1:59:00] she's going to recognize those that are
[1:59:01] in the message that are it's all law
[1:59:04] they're operating by law they haven't
[1:59:06] entered into that place where they've
[1:59:08] waken up they they've they've woken up
[1:59:11] to the true understanding he says watch
[1:59:13] he says when she begins to come back and
[1:59:15] line herself up with the word of God
[1:59:18] just like the vision that brother
[1:59:20] brandham saw he saw them that they were
[1:59:22] that they were walking in step with the
[1:59:24] word and some of them were were were
[1:59:26] were stepping out of line and they were
[1:59:28] pondering here and pondering there they
[1:59:30] were being distracted but he said get
[1:59:32] right back in line he said stay in line
[1:59:34] just stay with the word don't be
[1:59:37] distracted don't try to make yourself
[1:59:39] anything listen I I I I I don't know
[1:59:44] anything but what God reveals to me I
[1:59:47] I'm in this position in this office as a
[1:59:49] pastor some days I I still I still shake
[1:59:53] my head I don't understand I I you know
[1:59:55] it scares me it still scares me I'm
[1:59:58] telling you the truth okay but I know
[2:00:01] that I didn't do it I didn't start it
[2:00:03] God started this work 30 years ago God's
[2:00:06] going to finish this work I can only see
[2:00:08] what he allows me to see in the
[2:00:10] scripture I I can only see what I'm
[2:00:12] seeing I can only hear what I'm hearing
[2:00:14] and God revealing and making himself
[2:00:17] known he says watch then again you see
[2:00:19] how that the scriptures at that time
[2:00:21] there will be a message that'll sweep
[2:00:23] out to catch that bride to catch that
[2:00:25] elected woman and if there's anything
[2:00:29] that's got a hold of me it's not it's
[2:00:31] not that God sent a prophet it's not
[2:00:34] that oh you got to live this way you got
[2:00:35] to live that way it's that Jesus Christ
[2:00:38] has become a reality the word of God has
[2:00:41] become a reality to me I can see what's
[2:00:43] going on in the world I can see that
[2:00:45] they've rejected him I can see that
[2:00:48] they've taken sodomite condition I can
[2:00:50] see that they will not the word of God
[2:00:53] that they want to make themselves great
[2:00:55] they want to they want to profess they
[2:00:58] want to they want to act Godly but then
[2:01:01] they deny the power of the word of
