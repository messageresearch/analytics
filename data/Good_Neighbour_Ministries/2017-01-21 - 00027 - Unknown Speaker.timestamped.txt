[0:00] I was about to answer him when I was
[0:03] about to answer him both of us were
[0:05] struck when we heard like a stick tap
[0:09] tap tap and for some reason we stopped
[0:12] talking when we look it was his
[0:14] grandfather and the grandfather was
[0:17] trying to come up the stairs and uh I'm
[0:21] speaking P he said me Mayar you in other
[0:25] words I heard what you were saying right
[0:29] he says God been a
[0:34] dark I said listen that's your
[0:37] grandfather I'm not answering the
[0:38] question God just answering question to
[0:41] your grandfather see God can use even a
[0:44] sa let me go to the bible let you think
[0:47] I'm making this up you remember jedro
[0:49] was
[0:50] what was a vagan priest a
[0:53] magician the man was a pagan but he was
[0:58] Moses's father-in-law and he was a pagan
[1:02] priest when he came to Moses and said
[1:04] Moses man you're turning out yourself
[1:06] and you you're a servant of God why
[1:09] don't you ask your God to take some of
[1:11] your spirit and put it look at the
[1:13] wisdom that man had put it on S the
[1:17] other men or some other men so that they
[1:18] can assist you with the work you suppose
[1:21] Moses stood with his rod and said how
[1:23] dare you speak to me don't you know I'm
[1:25] the prophet of the
[1:28] hour don't you know that I all the staff
[1:31] that I raised over the rent seed how
[1:33] dare you you know but that's the point
[1:35] you see if you're a true child of God
[1:38] with that Spirit of humility on you you
[1:40] are listening all the time yeah you're
[1:43] listening even if you hear a child speak
[1:46] you're listening you're listening I mean
[1:48] listening not in the sense that you
[1:50] because we got your ears listening but
[1:52] your spirit is tuned to God so you're
[1:55] picking up things around you without
[1:58] having to think about it I'm tell you
[2:00] brothers and sisters it sounds simple
[2:02] but listen for the voice of God in this
[2:04] coming year and allow God to speak to
[2:07] you and use anybody to speak to you
[2:11] because his voice can come from anywhere
[2:14] praise the Lord hallelujah God can use
[2:17] of course we want God's voice to come
[2:18] from inside of a pillar of
[2:21] fire then we going to believe now I know
[2:24] God spoke to me because when I prayed I
[2:27] saw a fire and I of the fire came a
[2:30] voice that's when you're going to
[2:31] believe or we want the voice of God come
[2:34] with an angel appears and then we're
[2:37] going to believe amen that's what we
[2:40] think H and we want it in that kind of a
[2:43] way but in 2 Kings 319 9 to4 you don't
[2:47] have to find it you remember
[2:50] Elijah and when Elijah was in the cave
[2:53] and in the great wind fast and but it
[2:56] says the voice of God was not in it and
[2:59] then you have had the Thunder and the
[3:00] lightning and everything in it but then
[3:03] there came a still Small Voice and
[3:08] sometimes God likes to speak to us in a
[3:11] still Small Voice and some people don't
[3:15] want to get still because that voice can
[3:17] be very
[3:19] Bome can trouble your
[3:22] conscience you shouldn't have done
[3:24] that you know you was wrong when you
[3:26] spoke like
[3:28] that maybe the person doesn't know but
[3:31] just what was coming up to you wasn't
[3:34] right person doesn't know anything and
[3:36] you bothered because the holy spirit is
[3:38] grunting you now you're a child you're a
[3:40] son a real Son of God and so you need to
[3:43] deal with it but we need to listen for
[3:46] the voice of the holy spirit in this
[3:50] coming year because I believe God is
[3:52] going to lead us guide us and direct us
[3:56] we're going to move into a another realm
[3:59] uh where he's moving in a wonderful way
[4:01] for me I'm asking God for a personal
[4:05] Revival I'm asking for my strength to be
[4:08] renewed I'm asking for a personal
[4:11] Pentecost amen I'm asking for a fresh
[4:14] anointing I'm asking for the Holy Spirit
[4:17] to come down upon me and use me for his
[4:20] glory and for his honor and one thing I
[4:24] want to say uh as I I move from that
[4:27] into uh what I want to talk talk about
[4:30] here uh by wishing you a happy new year
[4:34] is that now you're going to enter into
[4:35] this New Year remember what Isaiah is
[4:38] said here God is telling Israel with all
[4:42] the things that happened to them all the
[4:45] attacks they got from their enemies
[4:48] Everything That Came Upon them he says
[4:51] remember not the former things neither
[4:55] consider the things of all behold I will
[4:59] do new thing now it shall spring forth
[5:03] you shall know it I will even make a way
[5:06] to Wilderness and rivers in the desert

[5:15] hospital bed the doctors gave me 3
[5:18] minutes to live my heart beat 17 times

[8:00] get that spark hits that gas that gas
[8:04] only has the potential of

[36:44] upon the ministry with me in this church

[36:51] name of Jesus Christ upon all of you

[36:56] of you that are taking a position and
[36:59] doing something in the kingdom of God I

[37:24] of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[37:27] praise prise God hallelujah as we face
[37:30] this New Year let us as I have read
[37:33] Darkness and Light we see David speaking
[37:37] here saying trust in the Lord put your
[37:40] confidence in
[37:41] him Isaiah said Gross darkness is coming
[37:45] upon the
[37:47] people but for the
[37:49] church rise Shine for the glory of your
[37:53] life is come Hallelujah is that right
[37:58] yeah the world is being covered with
[38:00] Darkness out there you can see it
[38:02] everywhere for then it's getting darker
[38:05] but for us it's getting brighter because
[38:08] Jesus is coming closer the Revelation is
[38:11] coming clearer and the path of the Jud
[38:13] of a righteous man is as a shining light
[38:16] that grows brighter and brighter until
[38:19] he steps into the perfect thing the
[38:22] Revelation gets clearer and clearer
[38:24] until you step into the perfect day so
[38:28] we face this year just like we do all
[38:31] other
[38:32] years we face it with regrets for the
[38:36] mistakes in the past how many regret
[38:39] their
[38:40] mistakes and let you repent publicly Now
[38:44] by just raising your hands you repented
[38:46] publicly you're not confessing to me but
[38:48] you confess to God I regret the mistakes
[38:52] of my past that we have
[38:54] made but we must expect that because it
[38:58] goes along like that pro and con humans
[39:01] living with the law of averages that we
[39:04] live by while we are here in this life
[39:07] in other words you're not going to be
[39:09] perfect you're not going to always
[39:11] strike it right every time like that but
[39:13] thank God we have a
[39:17] mediator who sets at the right hand of
[39:20] God when we are willing to admit our
[39:22] mistakes that we done wrong that's when
[39:24] he forgives us is that right amen praise
[39:28] the Lord he is full of grace and mercy
[39:31] to forgive us for all those mistakes
[39:35] praise the Lord brothers and sisters we
[39:39] got to First repent of our mistakes and
[39:43] when we do that that's when God forgets
[39:46] it you know that Hallelujah remember
[39:50] what God says that he'll take your sins
[39:53] and throw them in the sea of
[39:54] forgetfulness and I will
[39:58] so he
[39:59] remembered as long as you haven't
[40:01] repented of it as long as you haven't
[40:04] let the thing go as long as you hav't
[40:07] overcome it he remembers it when he
[40:11] remembers it you going to pay for it but
[40:15] when you repent of it he said okay I
[40:18] remember it no more you know somebody
[40:21] says oh I did that it was so long ago in
[40:24] the past yeah it's in the past it's in
[40:26] the past but you got to repent of it
[40:31] sincerely and when you do that not only
[40:35] do you let it go sometimes you can't let
[40:37] it go but when you repent of it he
[40:40] remembers it no more and he lets it Go
[40:43] and set you free completely for his
[40:46] glory and for his honor praise the Lord
[40:50] may the Lord bless these few words to
[40:53] your hearts tonight with all the
[40:55] sincerity in my heart that brought here
[40:58] to you that that's the way to have a
[41:01] Happy New Year to enter it not with with
[41:05] a lame lukewarm Spirit but to enter it
[41:09] with confidence with joy with
[41:12] expectation and believing God to have a
