[26:28] god bless you good morning everyone
[26:32] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[26:35] today on this great and wonderful day
[26:40] before we get to the Word of God we want
[26:45] to thank God for all the policemen
[26:51] firemen people working in the health
[26:55] care nurses doctors all the various
[27:01] people that are the backbone of our
[27:04] system we want to firefighters you know
[27:08] people of that nature that are facing
[27:13] the storm they're on the front lines and
[27:16] we want to give them a hand here today
[27:19] right now praise God amen the prime
[27:27] minister and the other ministers of the
[27:31] government with it in opposition or not
[27:33] they're all together working to take
[27:35] care of us
[27:36] and we ought to thank God for those who
[27:39] he has given us to be above us is that
[27:42] right so we do appreciate it and we pray
[27:44] that God will bless them and we'll do
[27:47] our best to adhere to whatever
[27:50] directives are they will put out which
[27:53] is what we're doing here today that's
[27:55] why you're so spaced
[27:57] space you know and that is the reason
[28:00] why we don't have all our membership
[28:04] here for that purpose so that we can
[28:06] either rotate so that some will be able
[28:10] to be in the house of the Lord where we
[28:13] can actually have the human contact
[28:15] because I don't mean touching but
[28:18] contact in the sense that human beings
[28:21] were not made to live in isolation
[28:24] but human beings are social beings God
[28:27] himself said it is not good for a man to
[28:30] be alone right so human beings need
[28:34] fellowship somebody says well brother
[28:37] Simon you can have it on the Internet
[28:40] only but the fact is the Internet is a
[28:45] cold and sterile in it's in the way that
[28:49] it is right now it's a difference when
[28:52] human beings are somewhere together
[28:55] that's the real communion so we're happy
[28:58] that we still have this opportunity of
[29:00] getting together like this and we pray
[29:04] that God will keep every single one of
[29:07] us and that we can be a testimony for
[29:10] the glory of God before I read out of
[29:14] the Holy Word of God you know taking my
[29:18] scripture from Luke 21 verses 25 to 28
[29:23] it will be up on the screen in a moment
[29:26] but before that we are going to pray our
[29:35] gracious Heavenly Father we come today
[29:39] in the name of Jesus Christ and we pray
[29:43] that the great Holy Spirit will anoint
[29:46] the word of God
[29:47] and made a word of god go forth to touch
[29:52] hearts and change lives heal the sick
[29:56] touch those that are discouraged raised
[30:00] up those to the weak father and send
[30:04] forth the light and truth of thy word
[30:07] today we rest ourselves upon your
[30:12] unfailing promises and we give you all
[30:15] the glory all the honor in the name of
[30:19] Jesus Christ amen and amen
[30:22] before we read that scripture I want to
[30:25] say to all ours the saints of God
[30:27] everywhere not only from this our
[30:30] assembly wherever they are at home at
[30:34] this time you can at
[30:36] least open your Bible and read out of
[30:39] God's Word and follow the truths in
[30:43] God's Bible and listen to the message of
[30:46] the hour this is just a temporary
[30:50] disturbance it too will pass
[30:54] the Bible says everything comes to pass
[30:57] you read it verse by verse it came to
[31:01] pass it came to pass and it came to pass
[31:03] it all comes to pass
[31:06] so let's adapt to what is happening
[31:10] right now so that we may be able to
[31:14] better serve our community and the
[31:19] entire human race
[31:21] we understand that with all these
[31:24] offices we mentioned the Bible teaches
[31:28] us really in actual fact not maybe here
[31:31] on the earth but in the realms of God a
[31:34] minister anointed by the gospel is the
[31:37] highest authority the highest authority
[31:43] and if these other officers are serving
[31:46] natural ones are serving there their
[31:51] offices and their standing in their
[31:54] position as ministers we ought to stand
[31:58] in our position in the name of Jesus
[32:01] Christ amen praise the Lord
[32:04] I want to encourage the Saints of their
[32:06] at home those that are shut in I'm
[32:08] thinking of all or folks wherever they
[32:11] are and Saints everywhere because this
[32:13] has disrupted the entire world so our
[32:16] prayers and our faith moves out to you
[32:19] wherever you are God bless you real good
[32:22] and our scripture reading is as such and
[32:26] there shall be signs in the Sun and in
[32:32] the moon and in the Stars and upon the
[32:37] earth distress of Nations with
[32:40] perplexity and the sea and the waves
[32:45] roaring men's hearts failing them
[32:50] for fear and for looking after those
[32:54] things which are coming on the earth for
[32:58] the powers of heaven shall be shaken
[33:02] then shall they see the Son of man
[33:06] coming in a cloud and great glory when
[33:11] these things begin to come to pass then

[39:30] principalities and powers and spiritual
[39:34] wickedness upon the face of the earth oh
[39:38] they were made of a butt of jokes but

[40:01] able to come on the edge of it and

[41:37] coming clearly the beginning of Sorrows
[41:40] the coming in of the man of sin amen
[41:45] the atmosphere is being created for this
[41:49] man of sin all kinds of problems are
[41:53] coming upon the face of the earth to
[41:56] create this condition to cause the
[41:59] nation's to begin to desire for a man or
[42:03] a person that can answer all their
[42:06] problems and answer their questions and
[42:10] provide the world with leadership and
[42:14] that Superman welcome - he will come in
[42:19] amen and try to deliver them but you see
[42:24] they want such a man oh my at the same
[42:28] time and Jesus Christ was coming they
[42:31] were asking for a deliverer to take them
[42:34] out of the Roman hands and again we are
[42:38] fast
[42:39] the world is faced with just situation
[42:42] where they're looking for somebody that
[42:45] has the answer and we know the answer
[42:49] for us is simple Jesus is the answer
[42:53] Christ is the answer to all our longings
[42:56] Christ is the answer to all our fears
[42:59] Christ is the answer to all our prayers
[43:02] let us put our trust in him
[43:05] and believe him to the very end amen yes
[43:08] sir they're going to want to have that
[43:11] man and they will have their Superman
[43:14] and that Superman will be none other
[43:18] than the Antichrist absolutely that's
[43:23] the Word of God hallelujah but while
[43:27] their hearts are feeling for fear on the
[43:29] inside let's keep looking up let's look
[43:33] up for jesus said when you see these
[43:36] things and it looks dark out there he
[43:40] says look up because it's light for you
[43:42] in heaven is that right
[43:45] hallelujah even David from way back says
[43:48] I look unto the Lord from whence cometh
[43:52] my help my help cometh from the Lord the
[43:56] creator of the heavens above the earth
[43:59] that's where our help comes from praise
[44:02] the Lord now I want to quote here
[44:08] brother Branham we know you are a
[44:10] messenger sent from God to this church
[44:13] age and the very same signs that follow
[44:17] Jesus were following you and we
[44:21] understand why some who know you best
[44:24] think you are the Messiah would you
[44:29] explain the difference in your
[44:31] relationship to God on of Christ now
[44:36] listen what he says in paragraph 3 84
[44:40] listen brethren I assure you before
[44:43] Christ that you knew all this part of
[44:48] your piece in other words don't talk
[44:51] nothing like that don't say anything
[44:53] like that right hold your peace but if
[44:57] you were spiritual you would understand
[45:00] praise God
[45:02] don't you know what the very first thing
[45:06] he said down there on the river don't
[45:09] you remember what he said as john the
[45:13] baptist was sent to forerun the first
[45:16] coming of cry
[45:18] your message it's the message that will
[45:24] forerun the second coming of Christ
[45:28] that's what the angel of the Lord said
[45:32] amen praise God so the point is a lot of
[45:38] people have been making fun of the fact
[45:41] that we teach that there is as a 20th
[45:45] century prophet and his name is William
[45:49] Marion Brandon and others have twisted
[45:54] and perverted the message as if to say
[45:58] that we are worshipping or following a
[46:01] man not realizing the very man has
[46:06] denounced a kind of a thing
[46:09] Dino stop kind of a teaching and as
[46:13] clearly said I adjure you before Christ
[46:18] that you hold your peace amen
[46:22] if you are spiritual you to understand
[46:25] amen the first coming of Christ your
[46:28] message it's the message that will
[46:32] forerun the second coming of Christ so
[46:37] what is it not demand but keep your eyes
[46:41] on the message let me repeat not the man
[46:46] but keep your eyes on the message of the
[46:50] hour amen for it was the Spirit of God
[46:54] speaking through that prophet it was not
[46:58] just william branham saying what he
[47:00] likes or whatever he wants to say but it
[47:03] was the Spirit of Almighty God speaking
[47:07] through that prophet and saying what
[47:10] would come to pass in the hearts of the
[47:14] believers and in the latter times amen
[47:19] now another code see as John the Baptist
[47:24] was sent forth to forerun the first
[47:26] coming of Christ you are sent with this
[47:29] message you will forerun the second
[47:32] coming of Christ amen
[47:34] see this message will forerun the second
[47:37] coming of Christ now the message i wanna
[47:42] drill that point on it's the message
[47:45] that four runs and brother branham is
[47:48] dead and gone but the messenger still
[47:52] here and a message is for running the
[47:55] second coming of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[47:59] but not just that listen closely here I
[48:03] want to go to proving his word what is
[48:08] it a testimony that long years ago when
[48:14] that pillar of fare was standing there
[48:17] in the bush like a whirlwind speaking
[48:19] said don't you never smoke or drink
[48:23] there's a work for you to do when you
[48:26] get older people said that boys gone out
[48:29] of his mind mother wanted to call a
[48:31] doctor I was nervous but what was it
[48:34] it's settled right down there at the
[48:37] bottom of that River at the Ohio River
[48:39] and said as John the Baptist was sent to
[48:43] get a people ready for the word to be
[48:48] made manifest so will your message so
[48:54] what's the purpose of this message being
[48:57] here the message being here is said to
[49:01] come to a people to make the Word of God
[49:05] manifested we are here for the word of
[49:09] God to live in us to manifest himself in
[49:14] and through us to fulfill that Jesus
[49:18] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[49:21] forever amen praise God hallelujah now
[49:30] go ahead now a brother is asking brother
[49:33] Branham a question here in question and
[49:37] answers when Christ came along then
[49:40] following John they come to him and they
[49:43] said we've been taught to believe that
[49:45] he Liza would come before the Messiah
[49:48] and he said Jesus himself said if you
[49:53] can receive it this was him that's right
[49:57] and John kept saying I am nothing I am
[50:00] nothing
[50:01] amen see I'm not worthy to lose his shoe
[50:05] what about when Jesus said about him who
[50:08] would you go out to see did you go to
[50:10] see a reed shaken with the wind or what
[50:13] did you go to see some man in fine
[50:15] raiment and luxury things there in
[50:18] King's palaces amen but did you see a
[50:22] prophet he was more than a prophet he
[50:28] was more than a prophet he was a
[50:31] messenger of the covenant the Covenant
[50:36] amen that's what he was he was more than
[50:41] a prophet he was a messenger of the
[50:43] Covenant he was the one that introduced
[50:46] and said this is him he identified the
[50:51] Word of God for the hour as we believe
[50:54] the prophet of God William Aaron Branham
[50:57] identified the word of God for this name
[51:00] and a message for this hour this is him
[51:04] amen praise God you see that's the Word
[51:08] of God so we find out when G John
[51:12] introduced Jesus Jesus was the Word made
[51:16] flesh now in our day brother Branham
[51:22] doesn't reduce the word made flesh but
[51:26] he introduces the revealed word
[51:28] hallelujah that is becoming flesh amen
[51:34] the word was in flesh there but the word
[51:37] is becoming flesh hallelujah that word
[51:42] became flesh that freshman go back to
[51:46] becoming the word and that's why we hear
[51:49] today receiving the word and becoming
[51:52] what we
[51:53] you become whatsoever you feed upon what
[51:57] you eat and we are feeding on that word
[52:01] so that we can become that part of the
[52:04] word that we are hallelujah brother
[52:07] branham for his day introduced him Jesus
[52:12] Christ the word amen his message and
[52:17] that message or that word like Jesus in
[52:21] when he came the first time was to call
[52:23] out as he did the disciples and to claim
[52:27] his own and finally to redeem them by
[52:32] his precious blood this message is here
[52:36] to do the very same thing the prophets
[52:40] message to call out amen and to claim
[52:44] and to redeem us by their word it's the
[52:50] word that you are hearing that redeems
[52:53] you when you recognize who he is that
[52:58] redeems your soul praise be to God
[53:02] hallelujah amen so we find John was a
[53:07] messenger of the Covenant and now we
[53:11] find out brother Branham also is a
[53:15] messenger of the Covenant notice I say a
[53:19] messenger of the Covenant not the
[53:22] messenger of the Covenant for the
[53:25] messenger of the Covenant is Christ the
[53:28] Lord
[53:29] but down through the ages messengers of
[53:33] the Covenant amen the Covenant that word
[53:38] that God sent to his bride for this hour
[53:42] amen
[53:43] we find out you say well what covenant
[53:46] directly won the Abrahamic covenant and
[53:51] to the brides covenant well you say well
[53:57] brother Simon what are you talking about
[53:59] do you mean there's a covenant for us in
[54:02] this day a
[54:04] well of course because we are Abraham's
[54:07] fed seed hallelujah and the covenant was
[54:12] made to Abraham and his seed forever and
[54:17] we are a part of that by faith in the
[54:21] word of the Living God for we believe
[54:25] the promise of the hour this Bible we
[54:28] stand on every promise in the Word of
[54:31] God and our faith rest there completely
[54:35] Amen yes sir praise God
[54:38] now we understand that a covenant means
[54:41] an accord a covenant means an agreement
[54:46] a covenant means a pledge made between
[54:52] two people or persons a covenant is a
[54:56] promise
[54:58] Amen now according to the dictionary it
[55:02] says our binding promise with
[55:05] far-reaching importance amen so when I
[55:10] say we have a covenant we have a we have
[55:14] my friends of a promise from God with
[55:18] far-reaching importance in our
[55:23] definition or my definition simply to
[55:27] make it simply promises made by God to
[55:31] man that is just simply our covenant
[55:34] god's promises made to man for this age
[55:39] that is our covenant hallelujah so we
[55:42] find out God back in the Bible made a
[55:46] covenant with Eve Genesis 3:18 how many
[55:52] knows that that God made a covenant with
[55:54] Eve in Genesis 3:18
[55:57] when he said that she will send a
[56:00] redeemer will bruise the Serpent's head
[56:02] the seed of the woman will bruise the
[56:05] serpent head God made a covenant also
[56:09] with Abraham right
[56:12] and we find out that in the end God has
[56:15] made a promise with us his endtime bride
[56:19] how many believes that in here yes sir
[56:23] amen what'd you say what promise he made
[56:26] us a promise no matter where you are how
[56:31] lost you are how blinded you were that
[56:35] he would turn the hearts of the children
[56:38] back to the Apostolic fathers in other
[56:42] words God would take the believers the
[56:45] true believers those who would receive
[56:49] his last their message to a god anointed
[56:52] prophet he will turn their hearts back
[56:56] to the original doctrines and teachings
[56:59] of their apostolate father's not the
[57:04] man-made teachings that's been mixed
[57:07] together with denominational traditions
[57:11] and that man's theses theologies but the
[57:16] pure Word of God from the mouth of God's
[57:20] apostles and prophets that is our
[57:24] promise that he will turn our hearts
[57:27] back and I believe my heart has been
[57:31] turned back and that is why I'm here
[57:34] today to stand and identify with a
[57:37] prophet of God and with the word of God
[57:39] for this hour amen I am one of them
[57:43] I'm saying it again I am one of them and
[57:46] I stand with the word of God forevermore
[57:50] hallelujah yes sir
[57:52] praise God for evermore I tell you
[57:55] friends God gave us another promise as
[57:58] it was in the days of Sodom so shall it
[58:01] be in the day when the son of man is
[58:05] going to be revealed amen again amen as
[58:09] it was in the days of lot so shall it be
[58:13] that is our promise
[58:15] also amen we have another covenant when
[58:19] he said I'm not going to leave you
[58:22] comfortless
[58:23] but I go to prepare a place for you
[58:26] a place for you not only heaven that's
[58:30] not only speaking of heaven but prepare
[58:33] for you a body
[58:34] amen amen that you might have a heavenly
[58:38] body you might go back to being one of
[58:40] those heavenly bodies one of those stars
[58:43] of God in other words God he said I
[58:47] gotta prepare a place for you that where
[58:49] I am you may be also praise God
[58:53] hallelujah he's gone to prepare a place
[58:57] for us and that is our promise out of
[58:59] the Word of God that you are going to go
[59:02] to heaven and be in the rapture amen and
[59:05] now he's here to claim and to call his
[59:09] own praise God amen
[59:12] now we find out the entire world is
[59:15] dying now they're in desperate straits
[59:19] now desperate conditions but remember we
[59:23] are in the desert along with them
[59:26] naturally speaking we are in the desert
[59:28] spiritually we're in promised land but
[59:31] we are in the same desert and we have to
[59:34] go through the same trials we gotta pass
[59:37] through the same pestilences and pass
[59:39] through this very same things but we are
[59:42] doing it with a covenant we are doing it
[59:46] with a promise that if the skin the
[59:49] blood under the Blood I will pass I will
[59:52] pass over you promise that he will pass
[59:56] over us if we stayed with his word amen
[1:00:01] praise God hallelujah
[1:00:03] now a lot of people misunderstood the
[1:00:06] miracles of God that he has come done in
[1:00:09] this desert to this world
[1:00:12] through the ministry of William Marion
[1:00:14] Brennan they understood not his miracles
[1:00:19] in the desert amen
[1:00:21] now we see clearly of course God made a
[1:00:25] covenant with Adam and Eve Genesis there
[1:00:29] I believe is 315 where he gave them a
[1:00:33] conditional covenant where he spoke to
[1:00:36] them and said if you will do this this
[1:00:38] this and this then I will
[1:00:40] do that I will do that in other words
[1:00:43] it's a covenant with a condition or
[1:00:46] conditions upon it you first have to do
[1:00:49] this list this you're not to eat you're
[1:00:52] not to touch whatever and I will do this
[1:00:55] I will do this I will do this then we
[1:00:59] find out there broke that covenant then
[1:01:03] God made a covenant my friends with
[1:01:07] Abraham and that is called an
[1:01:10] unconditional covenant in other words in
[1:01:14] that covenant God is saying Abraham you
[1:01:18] don't have to do anything
[1:01:21] speaking to Abraham and his seed which
[1:01:24] includes you if you're a believer are
[1:01:26] you a believers here today other believe
[1:01:28] was here today amen then this is unto
[1:01:32] you amen
[1:01:33] and unto your children that will believe
[1:01:35] the Word of God God made an
[1:01:38] unconditional covenant with Abraham not
[1:01:41] Abraham if you will if you will do this
[1:01:44] and do this and do these works and and
[1:01:46] do these kinds of works then then I I
[1:01:50] will accept you know God said look this
[1:01:54] is now unconditional Abraham you don't
[1:01:58] have to do anything whatsoever you are
[1:02:03] not required to do anything for I have
[1:02:06] already paid the price
[1:02:08] amen I've already paid the price I've
[1:02:11] done the work already amen all you got
[1:02:13] to do is believe it and rest upon it
[1:02:17] hallelujah I paid the price praise God
[1:02:20] for us he's already paid the price he's
[1:02:23] already gone to Calvary he's already
[1:02:26] taken our place he is a substitute amen
[1:02:32] he's the one that took our place praise
[1:02:35] God for evermore yes sir
[1:02:37] says Abraham I've already done it all
[1:02:42] amen Jesus is saying I already died I
[1:02:45] already paid the price for you all you
[1:02:49] have to do all I'm asking you is to love
[1:02:52] me
[1:02:53] and serve me believe my word that's all
[1:02:56] he's asking you to love him and to serve
[1:02:59] them and to believe his word that is all
[1:03:03] he's asking you today hallelujah may God
[1:03:07] help every one of us to love him from
[1:03:09] the butler hearts to serve him with all
[1:03:12] our hearts amen
[1:03:14] oh my and to believe every word of God
[1:03:19] for men shall not live by bread alone
[1:03:22] but by every word that cometh out of the
[1:03:27] mouth of the Lord God hallelujah amen
[1:03:31] oh how wonderful it is amen yes sir how
[1:03:36] it was unconditional covenant amen now
[1:03:41] remember it wasn't Abraham that was in
[1:03:45] Babylon or down there
[1:03:47] in all of the child counties and said to
[1:03:51] himself oh you know today I'm going to I
[1:03:55] believe I'm going to seek God I'm going
[1:03:57] to search for God and when I find him
[1:04:00] then I'm going to repent of all the bad
[1:04:04] things I've done and ask him to forgive
[1:04:07] me then he will save me and cleanse me
[1:04:10] from all my sins no that was not the
[1:04:15] case this was not a case of man seeking
[1:04:19] and searching for God this was a case of
[1:04:23] when God wanted to approach Abraham and
[1:04:27] his seed that was already in him God
[1:04:31] approach ever ham ever ham did not
[1:04:34] approach God and God told him I have
[1:04:38] chosen you I told you amen but then you
[1:04:44] were taking in your mind that now I'm

[1:05:41] Jehovah in his word form body him and
[1:05:46] which was later going to become flesh it
[1:05:48] wasn't flesh as yet but it was still in
[1:05:51] the word form a men approached Abraham
[1:05:55] and spoke to Abraham and gave Abraham
[1:05:59] that covenant promise and when he
[1:06:03] approached Abraham the moment abraham
[1:06:06] believed the promise he United with
[1:06:08] Abraham God United with that man in now
[1:06:15] we find out jesus said that promise that
[1:06:20] happened with Abraham back there or that
[1:06:23] scene or that whatever you want to call
[1:06:28] it that took place with Abraham back
[1:06:30] there is supposed to repeat again in the
[1:06:35] day when the son of man is going to be
[1:06:38] revealed when the world is under Noack

[1:13:45] way back before the foundations of the
[1:13:48] world
[1:13:49] that you are in him and now he has come
[1:13:53] to seek and to save them that were lost
[1:13:56] from his hands them that were already
[1:14:00] with him and then he lost them he came
[1:14:04] to seek and to save them that were lost
[1:14:08] amen oh my how wonderful brother sister
[1:14:12] that this was a covenant God made with
[1:14:15] his endtime bride that he would send a
[1:14:19] redeemer praise God
[1:14:21] he would send a Redeemer amen we find
[1:14:25] here in in a sermon of the seals third
[1:14:29] seal amen
[1:14:31] he talked about the Hebrew bride how she
[1:14:34] was wrapped up in her tradition
[1:14:38] substitutes and refused to accept Jesus
[1:14:41] Christ Oh word the word in flesh form
[1:14:45] amen they rejected him as their Redeemer
[1:14:50] not realizing it wasn't just the man
[1:14:52] that were rejecting there were rejecting
[1:14:56] the Word of God made flesh they were
[1:15:00] rejecting the Word of God made flesh now
[1:15:03] I'm going to now give you this quotation
[1:15:05] out of the third seal she that's the
[1:15:09] bride was promised Eve to be a redeemer
[1:15:20] in other words the word was promised to
[1:15:23] be a redeemer her edema would be what
[1:15:27] let's hear that louder her redeemer
[1:15:31] would be what the word so our Redeemer
[1:15:35] is the word of God back then it was the
[1:15:40] Word made flesh but here it's the
[1:15:42] revealed word under the anointing of the
[1:15:46] Holy Spirit that is your Redeemer that's
[1:15:51] what will save you when God gives you a
[1:15:54] revelation of it praise the Lord
[1:15:58] amen I believe there's an old song that
[1:16:02] passing through my heart No Christ our
[1:16:04] Redeemer died on the cross died for the
[1:16:09] sinner paid all his due sprinkle your
[1:16:13] soul with the blood of the Lamb and I
[1:16:17] will pass I will pass over you when I
[1:16:23] see the blood when I see the blood when
[1:16:30] I see the Blood I will pass I will pass
[1:16:37] over you amen praise God hallelujah
[1:16:41] listen when the word came made flesh she
[1:16:48] rejected it she was given substitutes
[1:16:52] amen
[1:16:54] now all that substitute given
[1:16:57] substitutes to go on until the Redeemer
[1:17:00] come in other words Israel was given
[1:17:04] lambs and goats and given washings and
[1:17:08] given various things which were types
[1:17:11] and shadows but when de redeemer word
[1:17:16] came on the scene there were supposed to
[1:17:19] let go of those types and shadows and
[1:17:24] enter into the reality of the Word of
[1:17:28] God amen
[1:17:30] but what happened instead of that
[1:17:33] because they were in it for thousands of
[1:17:36] years they they felt safe under the
[1:17:40] types and shadows to this very day and
[1:17:43] they're holding on to the types on the
[1:17:46] shadows instead of enter into the
[1:17:50] unfailing realities of the Living God
[1:17:53] to move from shadow into substance is
[1:17:58] that right to move from that which was
[1:18:02] given to them as a as a as a substitute
[1:18:06] and walk right into the entire truth
[1:18:10] reveal out of the Word of God
[1:18:13] but they felt safe enough to hang on to
[1:18:17] all their substitutes amen and when the
[1:18:21] redeemer come she wanted to continue
[1:18:26] with her substitute and rejected the
[1:18:30] true word see that was the Hebrew bride
[1:18:35] now amen God has promised paragraph 151
[1:18:41] has promised her as he did Eve he told
[1:18:45] Eve there would come a time that the
[1:18:48] word would come to her again
[1:18:51] well of course he's not talking about
[1:18:52] Eve back in the Bible he's talking about
[1:18:55] this Eve at this end time the word would
[1:18:58] come to her again in other words the son
[1:19:02] of man God Elohim in Word form would be
[1:19:05] revealed again the word would come to
[1:19:10] her again in this time see now you
[1:19:14] remember what she lost from it would be
[1:19:19] restored hallelujah where we understand
[1:19:22] now how that ties in with Malachi 4:5
[1:19:24] how he will restore the hearts of the
[1:19:27] turrent back to the father's back to the
[1:19:30] original word back to the original
[1:19:31] doctrines back to the original truth
[1:19:34] that was lost down through the ages
[1:19:36] right through history from the time of
[1:19:38] Paul write down it up by the
[1:19:41] caterpillars and Palma worms and right
[1:19:44] through the dark ages Nicene council
[1:19:47] that destroyed perverted the entire Word
[1:19:50] of God but that word was promised to be
[1:19:53] restored and the word could only be
[1:19:57] restored by a genuine prophet the Jews
[1:20:01] have had prophets through the Angels but
[1:20:04] thanks be to God he promised that he
[1:20:07] would send a Gentile profit and that
[1:20:10] profit would come to a people Amen
[1:20:13] people that he called out for his name
[1:20:17] glory to God people that were not a
[1:20:20] people but he called them out for his
[1:20:24] name amen
[1:20:25] now what
[1:20:27] loss would be restored there's only one
[1:20:30] think and restored and that's their word
[1:20:34] only the word can restore you back again
[1:20:38] hallelujah amen
[1:20:40] praise God and again brothers and
[1:20:43] sisters when we look we see the last day
[1:20:47] bride accepted man's teachings not bride
[1:20:52] the last day Eve a man who's the mother
[1:20:56] of all nations right she she accepted
[1:21:00] the teachings of men and rejected for
[1:21:04] day of redemption by rejecting the Word
[1:21:07] of God true a vindicated prophet of God
[1:21:10] see that's how she she missed the day of
[1:21:14] her visitation she missed the her
[1:21:18] Redeemer she didn't recognize her
[1:21:22] Redeemer because he was without form not
[1:21:24] coming us that doctor that what he was
[1:21:28] teaching or what the word was teaching
[1:21:30] didn't come home from a seminary or a
[1:21:33] synagogue or from someone the chameleons
[1:21:36] places it came right out of God's note
[1:21:40] it was inspired Word of God it was the
[1:21:44] father speaking through his son amen
[1:21:48] praise God hallelujah amen yes sir
[1:21:51] so they rejected the revelation of the
[1:21:54] word of God for their hour
[1:21:56] amen except that except brother sister
[1:22:00] for a small handful just a little flock
[1:22:03] who accepted a word for their day and
[1:22:06] they are redeemed hallelujah they
[1:22:10] redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:22:12] how you redeemed by the blood a man
[1:22:15] thanks be to God have you accepted a
[1:22:17] word for your day have you accepted your
[1:22:20] Redeemer for your day
[1:22:22] who is your Redeemer the Word of God for
[1:22:26] the hour amen or when the opening of the
[1:22:29] seals calls him to walk the bloody
[1:22:31] bleeding word when that word opens up it
[1:22:36] bleeds your receiver
[1:22:37] halation coming out to that word of god
[1:22:40] and the blood drops on you and
[1:22:42] identifies you that you are one of his
[1:22:45] own the Holy Spirit comes upon your life
[1:22:48] and opens up you're under the eyes of
[1:22:50] your understanding to recognize your day
[1:22:53] and the message for your day the Word of
[1:22:56] God for the hour amen yes sir
[1:22:59] you're a deemed by the bloody bleeding
[1:23:02] Word of God hallelujah
[1:23:04] thanks be to God I'm sure glad friends
[1:23:08] that the blood dropped on me aren't you
[1:23:10] aren't you glad the blood dropped on you
[1:23:16] hallelujah
[1:23:18] sounds like a simple statement but you
[1:23:20] remember in the Old Testament when the
[1:23:22] priest had to bring the two turtledoves
[1:23:25] before him and he will kill the male and
[1:23:28] the male would be fluttering on the
[1:23:30] altar and the blood spraying and the
[1:23:32] blood will sprinkle on the female and
[1:23:34] then he would set her free with the
[1:23:37] blood of the male sprinkle her that's
[1:23:40] why the psalm says sprinkle your soul
[1:23:43] with the blood of the Lamb and I will
[1:23:46] pass I will pass over you Jesus took her
[1:23:50] place at Calvary and his blood now makes
[1:23:53] us all redeemed and free from sin by the
[1:23:57] grace of Almighty God hallelujah
[1:24:01] I'm so glad let me say it again now with
[1:24:03] understanding I'm so glad that the blood
[1:24:07] has dropped on me has it dropped on you
[1:24:10] if you are not aware what it's dropped
[1:24:13] on you go to him in prayer now and said
[1:24:16] Lord when you're passing remember me
[1:24:19] when you're passing by remember me and
[1:24:23] if you're a true seed of the Living God
[1:24:25] you are one of his lost ones that lost
[1:24:29] from before the foundations of the world
[1:24:31] let me tell you then today while I'm
[1:24:34] speaking the word he has to pass your
[1:24:36] way a man because he's seeking you a man
[1:24:42] he's searching for you for this hour
[1:24:45] Lord of God hallelujah I'm so glad some
[1:24:48] of the revelation has bled out of that
[1:24:50] word
[1:24:51] amen oh my and has redeemed me by his
[1:24:55] precious blood amen
[1:24:57] if you see it accept Jesus Christ amen
[1:25:00] accept this message and this word of
[1:25:04] this hour today for the glory of God
[1:25:07] hallelujah friends as it was with Moses
[1:25:12] and I'm going to begin to wind this up
[1:25:14] now as it was with Moses and with Israel
[1:25:18] there also I must talk about this was a
[1:25:21] mixed multitude in the whole bunch that
[1:25:26] followed Moses message there's a whole
[1:25:29] mixed multitude that came out in the
[1:25:32] same message in other words it was that
[1:25:35] more the people following Moses was a
[1:25:38] mixture of believers make believers and
[1:25:43] unbelievers there's a vague scripture
[1:25:46] that even gives us a hint that a few
[1:25:48] Egyptians that believed what they heard
[1:25:52] Moses saying also came out with them but
[1:25:54] you don't hear much of that mentioned
[1:25:56] but a few of them came out they came out
[1:25:59] because they they could see that Moses
[1:26:02] was a genuine prophet and so they came
[1:26:05] out some of them came out also because
[1:26:08] they respected Moses because of his
[1:26:10] natural learning on all that stuff and
[1:26:12] through influence they came out but
[1:26:14] nevertheless they came out so it was a
[1:26:15] big mixed multitude of everything
[1:26:18] together Jesus puts it this way in his
[1:26:22] day when he preached the word he said
[1:26:24] look this is like a man throwing a net
[1:26:27] in the sea and when the net comes in he
[1:26:31] says now that man has to go up and
[1:26:33] separate you know you got to separate
[1:26:36] the fish from whatever that's inside of
[1:26:39] the net and that's the same way with the
[1:26:41] message of this prophet of this last day
[1:26:44] it went out everywhere all kinds of
[1:26:47] people came into it but brother we are
[1:26:50] living in a sifting time
[1:26:53] we are living in a time when the one of
[1:26:56] God is separating the fish they
[1:26:58] wonderful day
[1:27:00] spiders and the frogs and the snakes and
[1:27:04] all of the vultures all of the crows
[1:27:09] he is separating it by the opening of
[1:27:12] the Word of God a man is going on right
[1:27:17] now while we're speaking because that
[1:27:19] same once that followed Moses there them
[1:27:22] same spirits come back in this age and
[1:27:24] they're following along in this message
[1:27:28] hallelujah amen and that bunch is the
[1:27:31] bunch
[1:27:32] that always murmuring and complaining
[1:27:34] always finding fault always got
[1:27:39] something negative to say my god there
[1:27:43] were running down Moses that were
[1:27:45] running them all the things that he said
[1:27:49] running down the Word of God and
[1:27:51] everything else why are you doing this
[1:27:53] way why you do it that way Moses yeah
[1:27:56] yeah well I wonder if you break that up
[1:27:58] yourself or you maybe you carved out
[1:28:00] that Ten Commandments by yourself on the
[1:28:03] mountain and trying to make yourself a
[1:28:05] king or something else whatever it's not
[1:28:07] all kind of wild thoughts begin to go
[1:28:10] through their mind amen and there were
[1:28:13] following too but you know they were all
[1:28:17] in the same conditions they were all in
[1:28:20] the desert like I said we are all in
[1:28:22] this world here together we are all in
[1:28:24] the midst of the coronavirus is I write
[1:28:27] believers unbelievers make believers
[1:28:29] everything else true believers everybody
[1:28:32] is in the same mix but it's your
[1:28:34] attitude to the Word of God in the
[1:28:36] middle of the desert
[1:28:37] look the scripture says God said why do
[1:28:40] you think I took you in the desert that
[1:28:41] took you there to try you I took you
[1:28:44] there to prove you
[1:28:46] I took you in there to try you on the
[1:28:48] prove you
[1:28:50] amen my god to see what really is in you
[1:28:54] if you're one of my own hallelujah what
[1:28:57] happened only Josh one caleb was the
[1:29:00] only two that didn't murmur and and the
[1:29:07] younger generation that was to come keep
[1:29:12] your eyes on that because that's what's
[1:29:14] happening right now
[1:29:15] it's moving to the younger generation
[1:29:18] that is to come
[1:29:20] hallelujah oh my but all those older
[1:29:23] ones what happened to start to murmur
[1:29:25] they start to complain they start with
[1:29:28] everything else like that but the Bible
[1:29:30] says only Josh 1 Caleb amen Moses on his
[1:29:35] faithful few Jesus when he got enough
[1:29:39] eat my flesh drink my blood while you
[1:29:42] have no part with me which in that two
[1:29:45] spiritual people he was speaking he
[1:29:47] meant to eat his word the flesh and
[1:29:51] drink his blood not his natural blood
[1:29:53] but of the Holy Spirit right they didn't
[1:29:56] understand that at that time and the
[1:29:58] Bible says they walked with him no more
[1:30:01] that's taking place again today amen yes

[1:30:10] with his his disciples 120 of them met
[1:30:15] on the day of Pentecost before that
[1:30:17] history tells us he had about 500
[1:30:20] disciples so the majority of them just
[1:30:23] left him and only a hundred 20 of them
[1:30:25] could meet in that upper chamber so the
[1:30:27] same thing he had his faithful few and
[1:30:30] we find out the this this messenger came
[1:30:33] and he delivered the words amen now we
[1:30:35] are following not the man but the
