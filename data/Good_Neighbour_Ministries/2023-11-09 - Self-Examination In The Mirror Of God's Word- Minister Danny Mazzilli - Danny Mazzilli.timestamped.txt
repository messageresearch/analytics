[40:22] name amen praise
[40:25] God
[40:27] tonight we're going to look at
[40:29] examining ourselves self-examination in
[40:32] the mirror of God's word amen we've been
[40:34] looking at uh you may be seated we've
[40:37] been looking at um you know seeing
[40:39] yourself in the word of God and how
[40:42] important it is to recognize that God
[40:45] has uh placed you in the word that you
[40:49] have a position and a placing in the
[40:51] word of God there's a reason why you've
[40:53] been called uh to this day and to this
[40:56] this hour thank you brother there's a
[40:59] reason and a purpose in um you
[41:02] recognizing the word for your day the
[41:05] identity um the the the very fact that
[41:09] you've recognized your identity in the
[41:11] word of God shows that you've recognized
[41:14] the re the word of God for your day amen
[41:18] that's the that's the evidence of the
[41:20] Holy Ghost remember people are looking
[41:22] for the evidence of the Holy Ghost in so
[41:24] many different ways sence and wonders
[41:27] and and and miracles but the evidence of
[41:30] the holy spirit is when you can
[41:33] recognize what God is doing in your
[41:37] day apply that word in your life and
[41:41] live it you become the living
[41:45] manifestation of the word of God for
[41:47] your day and you become the word made
[41:50] flesh in this day and in this hourl
[41:54] praise God it's it you know uh when we
[41:57] talk about Christianity and we we look
[42:00] back at all of our
[42:01] experiences um growing up you know in
[42:04] our religious Realms you know some of us
[42:06] brought up Catholic Presbyterian Baptist
[42:09] Pentecostal whatever all of our
[42:12] experiences and all of our um ways of
[42:15] looking at the word and looking at God
[42:17] was based on what we were taught the
[42:20] Traditions that we were um exposed to uh
[42:25] you know going to church and certain um
[42:28] uh you know if you were brought up in a
[42:29] Catholic Church well then you were
[42:31] taught that you had to go through
[42:33] certain sacraments and you know your
[42:35] first communion first of all you're
[42:37] baptized as a baby which is not
[42:39] scriptural then your your first
[42:41] communion which is not scriptural if
[42:44] there is a First Communion it's the
[42:46] first time that the Holy Spirit reveals
[42:48] himself to you amen and you come into a
[42:50] literal Supernatural communion with God
[42:54] personally amen that's that's a true
[42:57] communion but you see we get taught all
[42:59] these different sacraments and different
[43:02] teachings and and and we we we look at
[43:05] the word and the whole you know the
[43:08] whole world um of religion around us is
[43:12] is what influences us and gives us
[43:15] certain interpretations on the word of
[43:17] God and we come to realize that when you
[43:21] do receive the new birth and you are
[43:24] awakened to the word of God it was not
[43:27] even close to what you thought or what
[43:29] you were
[43:31] taught that's the incredible aspect of
[43:35] being awakened in this day and in this
[43:37] hour to recognize who you are amen and
[43:41] so tonight we just want to look at
[43:44] self-examination looking into the mirror
[43:46] you know a lot of times you look into
[43:48] the mirror and you might see some flaws
[43:50] you know you're looking there and you
[43:52] you see you know especially if you're a
[43:53] woman you're constantly looking in the
[43:55] mirror to make sure that your hair is
[43:57] perfect that your you know that that
[44:00] your your your eyebrows are perfectly
[44:04] done and you know like all the things
[44:06] that you know you you you realize that
[44:08] you know that you're relying so much on
[44:12] you on on your own Beauty but when you
[44:15] look into God's word God's looking at
[44:18] the beauty in
[44:20] you in your character he's looking to
[44:23] see how your your your um attitude is um
[44:28] when you look into the mirror of God's
[44:30] word he's looking to see uh what your
[44:33] attitude towards his word and what his
[44:37] word requires for you in this day and in
[44:39] this hour amen and so many of us you
[44:43] know we go for yearly checkups you know
[44:46] we'll go to the dermatologist to know
[44:48] the importance of you know what this
[44:51] scar is over here or what this Mark is
[44:53] over here it's self-examination
[44:56] and the doctor may see a spot and tell
[44:58] you to keep an eye on it he may tell you
[45:01] that it that it's Chang that if it
[45:03] changes color it becomes more irregular
[45:06] then that could be a problem you see and
[45:09] everything that we look at in
[45:13] perspective of the doctor's report it's
[45:15] all carnal it's all physical it's all
[45:20] you know the outward God looks at you
[45:23] and says examine yourself to to see if
[45:26] you're in the faith to see if you're
[45:30] walking right to see if you've caught
[45:33] what God wants to do in your life and
[45:36] what he's requiring of you and what he's
[45:39] looking for you to do in in in
[45:41] positioning yourself in the word of God
[45:44] so self-examination is important when
[45:47] it's when it's in in the service of the
[45:49] Lord a lot of times we get our own ideas
[45:52] and our own interpretations on things
[45:55] and you know we want to do things our
[45:57] way we have like you know a way of of um
[46:01] doing things because you know that's
[46:03] just the way I am and this is the way I
[46:05] do it and so this is the way I want to
[46:07] do it but yet when God tells you to
[46:10] examine yourself he's saying examine
[46:13] yourself according to the
[46:15] word don't let your interpretation of
[46:19] how you are supposed to live lead you
[46:22] and guide you but let the word of God
[46:24] lead you and guide you in the way that
[46:26] you should live amen praise God and so
[46:31] self-examination can be a life or death
[46:34] experience you know we go to the doctor
[46:36] for a physical every year and we want to
[46:38] know you know that uh there's no growth
[46:41] you know on our bodies there's nothing
[46:43] wrong in our in our bloodstream we got
[46:46] to get our blood tests and we we we get
[46:48] all those things checked because we're
[46:50] worried that you know that we could get
[46:53] something and die well God's telling you
[46:56] to examine your faith examine yourself
[47:00] because you could be walking in such a
[47:02] way that it's not going to produce life
[47:04] but it's going to produce death we need
[47:07] to examine our thoughts we need to
[47:09] examine the way we think about
[47:12] everything around us amen praise God
[47:16] Scripture repeatedly calls us to examine
[47:19] ourselves and we see that in our text in
[47:22] verse 5 when the Apostle writes examine
[47:24] yourselves to see whether you are in the
[47:28] faith test yourself amen or do or or or
[47:34] uh do you not realize this about
[47:36] yourself that Jesus Christ is in you
[47:40] this is the greatest revelation of this
[47:44] day to know that Jesus Christ is in you
[47:48] that he's the one that wants to fulfill
[47:51] his word in
[47:53] you this is not your work
[47:56] this is the hour where you recognize the
[47:58] word and you come under obedience to the
[48:00] word and the word takes control in your
[48:03] life it starts to examine all of your
[48:07] your your previous understandings your
[48:09] upbringings your environments and it
[48:12] starts to purge and clean it's the
[48:14] attribute coming into its fullness it's
[48:18] it's Christ coming into his fullness
[48:20] Christ wants to live and manifest
[48:23] through your life so that he can take
[48:24] out all the things that you don't need
[48:27] anymore you know one of the things about
[48:30] the Rapture is that there's there's
[48:32] there's there's a lot of things you're
[48:34] not going to take with you amen amen
[48:37] praise God there's nothing here that's
[48:39] going to go in the Rapture other than
[48:41] you and your character you and your
[48:44] ability to recognize the word of God and
[48:47] to live the word of God and to manifest
[48:50] the word of God before the people amen
[48:53] praise God this is the hour where the
[48:56] body of Jesus Christ is coming together
[48:59] in the unity of the faith like we were
[49:01] talking about on Sunday it's all about
[49:04] you recognizing that you are a part of
[49:07] the body and that you are important to
[49:10] the body Christ wants you to recognize
[49:13] that he's in you in love he's in you
[49:18] that's why you know you you read the
[49:20] scripture and it talks about um until we
[49:22] all come into the fullness of Christ the
[49:25] fullness of Jesus Christ and when you
[49:28] look at that word fullness it's actually
[49:32] the Perfection and the
[49:34] maturity Perfection is maturity is to
[49:38] become mature in Christ and to recognize
[49:42] that you are a part of the body that
[49:44] that God needs to use God wants to make
[49:48] sure that you know that he wants you to
[49:51] examine yourself to know that it
[49:53] requires that you come into into contact
[49:56] with your higher self the the the the
[49:59] the one who you really are in Christ the
[50:02] attribute of God Amen praise God that
[50:06] attribute is what God has called in this
[50:09] hour he hasn't called your
[50:12] flesh every time we come into the house
[50:15] of the Lord and we assemble ourselves
[50:17] and we feed on the word of God that's
[50:20] where we come to we we we come to
[50:22] realize more Who We Are God's telling us
[50:26] and lifting the spiritual Amnesia on our
[50:29] lives that's why the most important part
[50:32] of coming into the house of the Lord is
[50:35] getting into the service and receiving
[50:38] the
[50:39] word you can't you you don't come to
[50:42] church listen we we have offices we have
[50:45] positions we have things that we have to
[50:47] do that are important around the house
[50:50] of the Lord but yet there's one purpose
[50:53] that we come into the house of the Lord
[50:56] every Sunday and Wednesday and that is
[50:59] to feed on the word by the supernatural
[51:03] element of the preaching of the word of
[51:05] God Amen when we come with that
[51:09] expectation and we come into the house
[51:11] of God for that reason then we are in
[51:14] the house of the Lord we're in the
[51:16] service the moment that the service
[51:18] starts we're in the sanctuary feeding on
[51:22] the word participating because we we are
[51:25] a very important part in the word
[51:30] household of
[51:32] God you're an important
[51:35] part and when you are in here and you're
[51:38] saying amen praise God hallelujah that's
[51:43] the amen the Deep calling to the deep
[51:46] and the Deep responding it's it's Christ
[51:50] perfecting and molding and shaping and
[51:54] and edifying
[51:55] each and every part that's in the word
[51:58] of God it's where listen judgment starts
[52:03] in the house of the Lord so it's where
[52:06] we examine ourselves where we we we
[52:08] check our attitudes we check our motives
[52:11] we check our desires amen praise God God
[52:16] wants us to examine ourselves we are an
[52:19] important part of the word of God and he
[52:21] wants us to come into the unity of the
[52:24] faith self-examination it's not an easy
[52:28] process in the process of
[52:31] self-examination we find many
[52:36] hindrances everybody's got
[52:39] hindrances everybody's got the you know
[52:41] their
[52:42] own ways of seeing things and sometimes
[52:47] the way we see things is a hindrance
[52:50] because we're not looking through the
[52:52] word we're looking through our own
[52:55] own ideas we're looking at things
[52:59] through our own eyes we're seeing things
[53:03] too naturally and we're not seeing
[53:06] enough
[53:07] spiritually Hallelujah often when we
[53:11] examine ourselves we come up with
[53:13] questions and in the self-examination
[53:15] process we sometimes begin to wonder
[53:18] whether we are even truly
[53:21] saved everybody experiences that every
[53:25] everybody goes through those those
[53:26] moments in their lives where they get
[53:28] you know where where where you know you
[53:31] start to look at everything in your life
[53:33] you start to all of a sudden you look at
[53:35] this situation and you see that it's
[53:37] completely not going the way that you
[53:39] want it to go you see this child and you
[53:42] think my God I raised this child in the
[53:44] way of the Lord and it's going
[53:46] completely in the other direction then
[53:49] you look at this job and you know you
[53:52] thought that it was going to be your
[53:53] career and you can't stand going to
[53:58] work it's all kinds of of things that
[54:02] that that that we find ourselves being
[54:04] hindered by because of
[54:07] our
[54:09] attitude and our
[54:12] priorities the priority is the word for
[54:17] your
[54:19] day your priority is not to be watching
[54:23] CNN 2 47 to see what's going on in
[54:27] Israel and get all caught up in all of
[54:29] that even though it is a terrible thing
[54:33] that's going on there the lives that are
[54:35] being taken the circumstances around it
[54:37] all it's terrible Saints it's
[54:41] absolutely um heartbreaking to see the
[54:44] the scenes of of families that are being
[54:46] destroyed children that are being killed
[54:49] families that are being broken and
[54:50] destroyed it's a terrible thing but we
[54:53] also need to recognize ize that this is
[54:56] also prophecy that's being fulfilled and
[55:01] if we look back into the scriptures we
[55:03] can read and look back into history and
[55:06] look at the wars that took place and
[55:08] everything that happened here on the
[55:10] earth if we look back at all those
[55:12] things we will see that there was a lot
[55:14] of Heartache a lot of Destruction it's
[55:17] all part of the prophecy that stands
[55:21] behind
[55:22] salvation and that's why sometimes times
[55:25] if we get caught up into those things
[55:28] and we get so down and and and
[55:32] discouraged we start to you know wonder
[55:35] why am I feeling so bad why am I you
[55:39] know have I really been saved because if
[55:42] I've been saved I'm supposed to have the
[55:43] joy of the Lord why is it that you know
[55:47] it's because you're allowing the
[55:49] hindrances of your carnal mind and your
[55:53] attitude toward 's situations and
[55:57] circumstances to get in the way of who
[56:00] you really are as an attribute of God
[56:03] you should be the happiest people on
[56:08] Earth because you know who you are
[56:12] according to the word of God and
[56:15] Christianity is all based on
[56:19] salvation what do you mean salvation
[56:23] Salvation from what is going on in the
[56:26] world everything that's happening all
[56:28] the the the conditions of the world the
[56:31] the weather circumstances the tsunamis
[56:34] that are hitting other places the the
[56:36] the the moral corruption in in in look
[56:40] at in politics you know there the the
[56:43] Democrats in the US are are winning in
[56:46] certain ways because they're pushing
[56:50] abortion they they want people to be
[56:52] able to you know have abortions they you
[56:55] know you should if you have a child you
[56:57] you shouldn't you should be able to
[56:59] decide whether you want to have a child
[57:01] or not if they were anywhere near the
[57:05] word of God in Christianity they would
[57:08] know that marriage is is something
[57:11] that's sacred and something that should
[57:14] be instituted before you enter into
[57:18] sexual activity where you start to
[57:20] produce
[57:22] children you see if if you put things in
[57:25] their proper perspective and we realize
[57:28] that we've come into a world now where
[57:30] sexual um conduct it's becoming like
[57:34] like it's it's normal for the young
[57:36] people now you know like before they you
[57:39] know you talk to some young people and
[57:41] you you read about certain things and
[57:43] and it's like are you kidding I would
[57:45] never get married to that person if I
[57:47] didn't know how they were
[57:49] sexually that's what it's come to it's
[57:53] come to where if the you know if the if
[57:55] the if if the sexuality isn't right then
[57:59] the mate is probably not right and what
[58:03] happens is they start going through one
[58:06] Experience One relationship after the
[58:09] other and they get used and abused and
[58:13] before you know it they don't even know
[58:15] what true love and affection and
[58:19] bringing children into the world and the
[58:22] purpose of it and that it's all part of
[58:24] a God's blessing when he gives you
[58:27] children when you do things in the right
[58:31] way but the world has gone into such
[58:36] immorality and the laws around it are
[58:43] supporting this ridiculous conduct that
[58:47] we find our young people caught into he
[58:50] she they they can be you know uh all
[58:54] kinds of different different identities
[58:56] not knowing that is a form of insanity
[59:01] yes when you don't know who you
[59:04] are and you can't recognize whether you
[59:07] are male or female there's something
[59:10] that has taken place in the mind that
[59:12] they need to be healed they need they
[59:16] need real Supernatural healing to be
[59:19] brought back to their to the foundations
[59:22] of who they actually are but what the
[59:25] word of God does is it tells you who you
[59:27] are it tells you that you are not of
[59:30] this world you are temporarily in this
[59:33] world you're in a in a in a human body
[59:37] but that's not who you really are who
[59:40] you really are as a son or a daughter of
[59:43] God is a spirit Soul attribute of God
[59:47] that came from God and is going back to
[59:50] God this Dimension that we're living in
[59:54] is a Time
[59:56] Dimension it's only for a period of time
[1:00:02] people get so caught up they think that
[1:00:05] all there is because they don't have a
[1:00:07] revelation of God they don't know that
[1:00:09] there is true salvation true salvation
[1:00:13] is to know that you are going to
[1:00:17] something a billion times better than
[1:00:20] this and it'll have no end to
[1:00:22] it because you are Eternal having no
[1:00:26] beginning and no
[1:00:27] end and so when you've got that
[1:00:30] revelation of Salvation your life and
[1:00:33] your perspective on life and the way
[1:00:35] that you see life should be a lot
[1:00:39] different than the way this world wants
[1:00:41] to mold and shape you and what it wants
[1:00:44] to turn you
[1:00:46] into aren't you glad that you've been
[1:00:49] awakened to know who you really
[1:00:51] are and that this life is only only
[1:00:57] temporary praise God forever more
[1:01:00] Hallelujah I thank God for that I thank
[1:01:04] God of the Revelation on salvation it's
[1:01:06] something that that just never you know
[1:01:09] stops amazing me because when you get
[1:01:12] caught into those days where you're not
[1:01:13] feeling good and you're feeling a little
[1:01:15] frustrated and you know things are just
[1:01:17] not going right and you know and it's
[1:01:20] not something that that because we have
[1:01:22] like you know um because we have mental
[1:01:25] health issues that we can't handle life
[1:01:28] everybody has mental health issues
[1:01:31] everybody has issues that they're trying
[1:01:33] to deal with circumstances that they're
[1:01:36] trying to overcome it's all a part of
[1:01:39] overcoming this life that's why we're to
[1:01:41] put on the mind of Christ amen that's
[1:01:44] why we're to think on on the right
[1:01:46] things we're to read the word of God
[1:01:48] feed on the word of God every single day
[1:01:51] get into the house of the Lord and let
[1:01:53] the word of God
[1:01:54] pour into you through the supernatural
[1:01:57] element of preaching faith comes by
[1:02:00] hearing the word of God a lot of people
[1:02:03] you know they don't realize that that
[1:02:05] that correction starts in the house of
[1:02:08] the Lord how does it start in the house
[1:02:10] of the Lord because the word comes and
[1:02:13] corrects the word comes and and and
[1:02:16] speaks to your situation and when it
[1:02:19] speaks to your situation it's because
[1:02:21] it's delivering you from that situation
[1:02:25] when you come in here and you've been
[1:02:27] dealing with a certain you know maybe a
[1:02:29] relationship issue and then the the
[1:02:32] minister gets up there and he starts
[1:02:34] speaking on and he starts to you know uh
[1:02:37] you know discern the whole situation
[1:02:39] you're wondering man how does he know
[1:02:40] all of that he doesn't know all that
[1:02:43] it's God that knows all about it it's
[1:02:45] God that wants to set you free and when
[1:02:48] God speaks to you when you come into the
[1:02:50] house of the Lord and he starts speaking
[1:02:52] directly to that circumstance or that
[1:02:54] situation it's because he wants to
[1:02:57] deliver you from it you that's why when
[1:03:00] when when you should you should be like
[1:03:03] like rejoicing when God discerns that
[1:03:06] situation in your life and it could be
[1:03:09] something that you know is is sin it's
[1:03:12] total unbelief you know you shouldn't be
[1:03:14] doing it it's iniquity and you realize
[1:03:17] that it is but then the Holy Spirit
[1:03:19] starts to speak to you you know that's
[1:03:21] God's mercy to you you know that's God
[1:03:24] not speaking to your situation and
[1:03:26] saying you don't need to remain that way
[1:03:28] anymore I release you from that
[1:03:31] situation right now but then sometimes
[1:03:35] when the minister starts to speak and
[1:03:37] starts to discern the situations and you
[1:03:39] don't have the right attitude and the
[1:03:41] right Spirit you start to Rebel you
[1:03:44] think oh he knows about my situation and
[1:03:46] he's just using the pulpit to deal with
[1:03:49] my situation God help any Minister
[1:03:52] that'll do that amen praise God the
[1:03:56] minister does not look into personal
[1:03:59] situations and lives he is led by the
[1:04:02] spirit and when the Holy Spirit brings
[1:04:04] that to his mind and starts to minister
[1:04:07] to those situations and starts to zoom
[1:04:10] in and and and and hone in on your
[1:04:13] situation if you say Amen praise God
[1:04:16] Lord help me I receive it you will be
[1:04:19] delivered but if you say no I'm not
[1:04:23] accepting that
[1:04:26] and you get an attitude towards it guess
[1:04:29] what things get
[1:04:31] worse because the enemy says I can stay
[1:04:36] because they want me to stay they're
[1:04:38] holding on to a rebellious spirit that
[1:04:41] rebellious spirit is
[1:04:44] me that's what listen anything that is
[1:04:48] against God anything that is
[1:04:50] Antichrist anti- word is anti- spirit
[1:04:54] it's Satan in some form it's a demon in
[1:04:58] some form it's as simple as that if you
[1:05:02] got a smoking Spirit on your life that's
[1:05:05] a
[1:05:06] demon and God wants that
[1:05:09] demon to loose your life but when God
[1:05:13] comes and exposes it and you turn around
[1:05:16] and you go right back out there and you
[1:05:18] continue to
[1:05:19] smoke guess what you're going to get
[1:05:23] worse
[1:05:24] because you're allowing that Spirit to
[1:05:27] have his way and stay you see these are
[1:05:31] simple things you know sometimes we
[1:05:33] don't realize now I'm using those
[1:05:35] examples of smoking but you could have a
[1:05:39] rebellious Spirit on
[1:05:43] you and a rebellious spirit is something
[1:05:46] that just disagrees when it gets
[1:05:51] corrected just
[1:05:53] disagrees instead of you know just
[1:05:56] sitting back and allowing the Holy
[1:05:57] Spirit based now correction must come in
[1:06:01] the right form and in the right way God
[1:06:04] has his offices his positions he's got
[1:06:08] deacons he's got trustees he's got all
[1:06:10] the offices that's what we were talking
[1:06:12] about God gave to the church all these
[1:06:16] offices and positions for the
[1:06:18] edification of the church for the
[1:06:21] uniting of the church for the equipping
[1:06:24] of the church and so these offices are
[1:06:28] anointed of God to do certain things to
[1:06:32] correct certain spirits to to set free
[1:06:35] certain individuals that's why we always
[1:06:38] tell you if there's a situation that
[1:06:40] you're dealing with that you are finding
[1:06:42] yourself frustrated in any way shape or
[1:06:45] form see your Deacon talk to your Deacon
[1:06:49] because that
[1:06:51] Deacon he may not have the answers
[1:06:55] but the holy spirit will honor your
[1:06:59] obedience to the word of God and somehow
[1:07:03] someway God will anoint that Deacon to
[1:07:07] either get together with other deacons
[1:07:10] get together with the pastor and talk
[1:07:12] about the situation and allow the wisdom
[1:07:15] of the Holy Spirit to come in so that it
[1:07:18] can be dealt with exactly the way God
[1:07:21] wants to deal with it am and when God
[1:07:24] deals with it he does it in such a way
[1:07:29] that it
[1:07:32] unites it doesn't
[1:07:35] separate it will unite because remember
[1:07:38] this is the mystical body of Jesus
[1:07:41] Christ this Ephesians
[1:07:44] church and the Ephesians church and what
[1:07:47] God has given to the Ephesians church is
[1:07:49] for the perfecting the equipping the
[1:07:53] edifying
[1:07:54] the uniting the bringing into the
[1:07:57] fullness of maturity into the one full
[1:08:01] body of Jesus Christ in female form this
[1:08:05] is where Jesus Christ this hour it's
[1:08:10] Christ again on the earth a lot of
[1:08:12] people are are failing to recognize that
[1:08:15] remember he's already come a lot of them
[1:08:17] are going to be looking for him in the
[1:08:18] cloud he already came in the cloud he
[1:08:21] came in 1963 in the cloud but the world
[1:08:24] missed it but not everybody missed it
[1:08:27] not those whose names were written in
[1:08:29] the Lamb's Book of Life they recognized
[1:08:31] the word but he came for a purpose he
[1:08:34] came the head that's why the cloud when
[1:08:37] you turn it it it was the shape of the
[1:08:39] head of Christ it was coming to the body
[1:08:42] it was coming to unite with Eve with the
[1:08:46] female attribute with the with the
[1:08:49] female aspect of Jesus Christ remember
[1:08:53] Adam and eve were both they were
[1:08:57] one they were one Eve was just as much
[1:09:02] Jesus Christ as Adam was it's just that
[1:09:06] Eve had to fulfill a certain aspect of
[1:09:10] the Plan of Redemption something had to
[1:09:13] fall in order for something to be
[1:09:16] redeemed and so Eve is Jesus Christ in
[1:09:20] the female aspect and Eve is now being
[1:09:25] restored back to her fullness again the
[1:09:29] church the body of Christ amen she and
[1:09:33] he are the same person in the beginning
[1:09:36] was the word the word was with God and
[1:09:40] the Word was God and if you are the word
[1:09:44] made flesh in your day then you are God
[1:09:49] manifesting the female aspect of Jesus
[1:09:52] Christ which is always been known as the
[1:09:55] bride and the bride in the church is
[1:09:58] known as a woman and the woman is known
[1:10:01] as the church and so all of the
[1:10:05] ingredients that are required every
[1:10:09] single attribute of God is coming into
[1:10:12] its place and its position in the body
[1:10:16] of
[1:10:17] Christ and God is going to perfect you
[1:10:21] God is going to mold you and shape you
[1:10:23] so that you fit just perfectly fine into
[1:10:27] the word of God Amen praise God
[1:10:31] hallelujah so so we come to a place
[1:10:34] where we recognize that you know
[1:10:37] hindrances hindrances hinder us
[1:10:40] constantly and you know we we need to uh
[1:10:43] allow ourselves to be examined
[1:10:45] constantly by the word of God by coming
[1:10:48] into the house of the Lord you know
[1:10:50] Satan constantly attacks our thoughts he
[1:10:53] attacks every single one of us and as
[1:10:56] that Temptation repeatedly comes into
[1:10:58] our thoughts reoccurring time because
[1:11:01] that's that's how he gets you Satan will
[1:11:03] come and continually put that negative
[1:11:07] thought into your mind constantly
[1:11:10] constantly bombard you with with with
[1:11:13] thoughts against your boss or or or
[1:11:16] thoughts uh you know about immorality
[1:11:21] you know as young men and young women
[1:11:24] there's a constant bombardment in the
[1:11:27] mind
[1:11:29] constantly about immoral acts because
[1:11:32] they're constantly taking place around
[1:11:35] us to the point where it's becoming
[1:11:38] commonplace and we are constantly being
[1:11:40] bombarded and if we don't block our
[1:11:43] thoughts and replace them with the word
[1:11:45] of God we find ourselves becoming
[1:11:48] creatures of habit before you know it
[1:11:51] you know because you're constantly
[1:11:52] seeing you know you young men you know
[1:11:55] you're you're constantly looking at
[1:11:57] Billboards and the women are constantly
[1:12:00] half-dressed and before you know it
[1:12:02] you're looking you're looking you're
[1:12:04] looking then all of a sudden you're
[1:12:05] browsing the internet and then all of a
[1:12:07] sudden boom you know especially if
[1:12:09] you're if you're you got to watch those
[1:12:12] those Instagrams and and all those
[1:12:14] different
[1:12:16] um apps that that that they're
[1:12:18] constantly I see them flipping all the
[1:12:20] time because once in a while there's
[1:12:23] there's there's there's
[1:12:25] pornography boom just right hits you
[1:12:27] right in the face and if you're not
[1:12:29] careful you're going to get caught by
[1:12:31] that and you're going to take that
[1:12:32] second look and then you're going to
[1:12:34] look for more because the enemy uses
[1:12:36] your mind he's bombarding your mind to
[1:12:39] try and get you to you know to to leave
[1:12:43] the word of God to to uh you know
[1:12:46] disbelieve God's word amen but when we
[1:12:49] replace those things with the word of
[1:12:52] God instead of going and flipping
[1:12:54] through Instagram and all those things
[1:12:56] day all day long flip through the word
[1:12:58] of God Amen and read about the things
[1:13:02] that are pure and the things that are
[1:13:03] true and the things that are just and
[1:13:05] the things that are going to strengthen
[1:13:07] you and and perfect you so that you can
[1:13:09] take your position in the word of God
[1:13:12] and be a strong soldier in Christ it's
[1:13:15] not easy especially in this hour to
[1:13:19] overcome that power of social media that
[1:13:23] is constantly bombarding our minds but
[1:13:27] I'm telling you that if your heart and
[1:13:29] your desires are for the word of God God
[1:13:33] will raise a standard around you you
[1:13:36] come into the house of the Lord for the
[1:13:38] purpose that you want you want to be
[1:13:40] strengthened by the word of
[1:13:42] God the word will strengthen you you
[1:13:45] will find yourself stronger you'll go
[1:13:47] out you ever notice I'll tell you I
[1:13:50] challenge you read the word every single
[1:13:52] day get something out of the
[1:13:55] word and you will find yourself wanting
[1:13:58] to read
[1:13:59] more listen to the tapes you listen to
[1:14:03] them and you know and you do it in a way
[1:14:05] where you steady your mind you sit long
[1:14:08] enough it's like I said on Sunday you
[1:14:10] know like the Holy Spirit was saying
[1:14:11] that people will not sit long enough to
[1:14:14] listen to the word and and actually uh
[1:14:18] you know search the scriptures to see if
[1:14:21] they are actually
[1:14:23] mirroring the word of God when it comes
[1:14:25] to Salvation you can look into the book
[1:14:28] of Acts and you can see baptism in the
[1:14:31] name of Jesus Christ it's very clear
[1:14:34] right there in the scripture in Acts 238
[1:14:37] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:14:40] the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall
[1:14:43] receive the gift of the Holy Spirit and
[1:14:46] it's right there it's clear you don't
[1:14:49] have to read the whole Bible that's
[1:14:52] where you know you could start right
[1:14:54] there because it's clearly says that you
[1:14:58] need to repent and you need to be
[1:15:00] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:15:02] Christ you shall receive the gift of the
[1:15:04] Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is the
[1:15:07] attribute is the word of God in you
[1:15:10] awakened to recognize truth and if you
[1:15:13] stay there long enough and you do those
[1:15:16] simple things you will find
[1:15:18] yourself motivated you'll find yourself
[1:15:22] strengthened you'll find yourself
[1:15:24] wanting to get to the to the baptismal
[1:15:27] tank but when somebody tells you and you
[1:15:29] just don't want to search and you don't
[1:15:31] want to take the time to stay there and
[1:15:34] allow the word to permeate you and and
[1:15:37] fill you and give you the strength that
[1:15:39] you need in order to get to that
[1:15:42] tank you're going to get pulled right
[1:15:44] back into the
[1:15:46] world that's where you must overcome the
[1:15:49] Bible says to them that
[1:15:51] overcome some people think I don't have
[1:15:54] to do
[1:15:55] nothing everything is taken care of
[1:16:00] Jesus said he's the author and the
[1:16:01] finisher of my faith so I don't need to
[1:16:04] do nothing I can just go and do what I
[1:16:06] want every single day that's not the way
[1:16:09] it
[1:16:10] works no sir you need to
[1:16:14] overcome the devil is there the enemy is
[1:16:17] right there when you get up in the
[1:16:18] morning you put your foot on the floor
[1:16:21] he's already at the punch clock
[1:16:24] and he's clocking
[1:16:26] in and he says all right let's deal with
[1:16:30] this one today let's see how much they
[1:16:32] can overcome and by the end of the day
[1:16:35] if you haven't got the
[1:16:37] devil frustrated and upset and and to
[1:16:41] the point where he just leaves because
[1:16:43] the scripture says resist him and he
[1:16:47] will
[1:16:47] flee resist him and he will flee so when
[1:16:51] the enemy comes to you and says say to
[1:16:53] you hey Daniel you know we're going to a
[1:16:55] bar tonight you know you want to come
[1:16:57] and check out you know the the the band
[1:17:01] you know they got a live band there it's
[1:17:03] supposed to be really good you don't
[1:17:05] have to turn around and say that's Satan
[1:17:07] no way I ain't going there no he just
[1:17:09] say no
[1:17:10] thanks I'm
[1:17:13] good that's
[1:17:16] it that's resisting the devil it's as
[1:17:19] simple as that no thank you
[1:17:24] you go have a good time I'm going home
[1:17:27] actually I got church tonight it's
[1:17:30] Wednesday I get a lot of people that
[1:17:32] call me and say Danny you want to come
[1:17:34] here you want to do that you said on a
[1:17:36] Wednesday night you know we got a
[1:17:37] meeting this that I said no that's
[1:17:38] Wednesday night and now they don't even
[1:17:40] call me anymore they know Wednesday
[1:17:43] Danny's going to church Sunday Danny's
[1:17:46] going a church it's as simple as that
[1:17:50] because I know I get strength here I
[1:17:54] know this is where I get fed I know this
[1:17:58] is where I I I I fellowship with my
[1:18:01] brothers and sisters in the spirit in
[1:18:04] Heavenly places when we are in here and
[1:18:07] the word is coming and speaking to our
[1:18:09] situations and speaking to our needs and
[1:18:12] we're together and we're and we're
[1:18:13] saying Amen brother amen sister
[1:18:16] hallelujah praise God and you hear that
[1:18:18] sister saying amen glory to God and you
[1:18:21] know you've been praying for that sister
[1:18:23] amen the brother says and you know
[1:18:25] you've been praying for that brother and
[1:18:27] the Holy Spirit now comes and speaks
[1:18:29] directly to that situation because you
[1:18:31] know that you you you you were you were
[1:18:34] standing in the gap for them you were
[1:18:36] believing that God would give them what
[1:18:38] they had need of and you and you were
[1:18:41] trusting that the Holy Spirit would know
[1:18:43] about it and that he would take the
[1:18:44] minister and use the minister to speak
[1:18:46] to that situation so that that
[1:18:48] individual could be set free and then
[1:18:51] you witness it you see it don't you see
[1:18:53] how you get edified how you get
[1:18:55] strengthened because you know you were
[1:18:57] praying and then you see that person and
[1:18:59] then you see them get delivered you see
[1:19:01] this is how the body of Christ operates
[1:19:04] one you know sometimes you don't see
[1:19:07] certain
[1:19:08] individuals but they're praying here and
[1:19:11] they're coming into the house of the
[1:19:13] Lord on certain nights of the week when
[1:19:15] you don't know about it I know about it
[1:19:19] I happen to be in a position where I
[1:19:20] know when anybody comes into this church
[1:19:23] because I'm the head Deacon and I and I
[1:19:25] keep an eye on the premises anybody
[1:19:28] opens that door enters a code I know
[1:19:31] about it within 30
[1:19:34] seconds and so God has it that way
[1:19:38] because this is our house and we and we
[1:19:41] need to protect it and God has his
[1:19:44] proper positions and offices in their
[1:19:46] places to protect and those individuals
[1:19:50] when they're coming into the house of
[1:19:51] the Lord and they're getting on their
[1:19:52] knees for an hour praying for the
[1:19:54] services on Wednesdays on Sundays or
[1:19:56] coming early into the house of the Lord
[1:19:58] on Wednesday nights to pray those hidden
[1:20:01] parts are very important parts that we
[1:20:05] need to recognize and be thankful for
[1:20:08] because it it's what makes these
[1:20:10] Services effective and Powerful for each
[1:20:13] and every one of
[1:20:16] us it's not the only element but it's an
[1:20:19] important element one is fasting the
[1:20:22] other one is praying sometimes you feel
[1:20:25] led sometimes to just
[1:20:27] fast well it's because maybe God has
[1:20:29] another person in the body that's
[1:20:32] praying and praying and praying and
[1:20:35] you're fasting and they're praying and
[1:20:37] it's and it's edifying and it's
[1:20:39] strengthening and it's adding the the
[1:20:42] the the the energy that we need within
[1:20:44] the
[1:20:45] church in order for the church to
[1:20:47] function and be effective and Powerful
[1:20:52] and have you become effective and
[1:20:55] Powerful in your own daily lives you are
[1:20:59] walking with Christ Christ is walking in
[1:21:04] you he says I'll be with you even in You
[1:21:07] Until the End of the Age praise God Amen
[1:21:14] Hallelujah
[1:21:16] so the evil one is always looking for an
[1:21:19] opportune time to tempt you he's looking
[1:21:23] for temptation to place Temptation in
[1:21:26] front of you over and over and over
[1:21:28] again for what purpose to distract you
[1:21:30] from the word of God to distract you
[1:21:33] from your true position as a son or a
[1:21:35] daughter of God you're needed in this
[1:21:39] local assembly I want you to know that
[1:21:41] each and every one of you you are an
[1:21:43] important part and you are needed in the
[1:21:46] body of Jesus Christ and God wants to
[1:21:50] mold you and shape you and and and deep
[1:21:52] deal with the with the natural
[1:21:55] hindrances in your life but in order for
[1:21:57] us to truly overcome we need to examine
[1:22:01] ourselves we need to take a look and
[1:22:04] examine where we're putting all of our
[1:22:07] time you know there's times of rest
[1:22:10] there's times of vacation there's times
[1:22:13] to work there's there's a time for
[1:22:15] everything the Bible says a time for all
[1:22:17] things and God makes everything
[1:22:20] beautiful in its time
[1:22:23] and so we need to recognize that God
[1:22:25] requires us to search our time examine
[1:22:29] our time and examine where we're putting
[1:22:32] most of our
[1:22:34] efforts amen praise God
[1:22:36] [Music]
[1:22:40] hallelujah
[1:22:43] amen in
[1:22:46] Psalms
[1:22:47] 19 David prayerfully asked who can
[1:22:51] discern his errors
[1:22:53] declare me innocent from hidden
[1:22:56] faults keep back your servant also from
[1:22:59] presumptuous sins let them not have
[1:23:03] dominion over me then I shall be
[1:23:06] blameless and innocent of great
[1:23:09] transgression Psalms 19: 12 and
[1:23:13] 13 you know David had a revelation that
[1:23:18] he needed God on a daily basis to help
[1:23:22] him to overcome the circumstances that
[1:23:25] he had to deal with in his life because
[1:23:28] the Paradox like we were saying on
[1:23:29] Sunday is that you're a
[1:23:32] human you're weak you get tired you get
[1:23:37] angry you get
[1:23:39] miserable you get
[1:23:41] frustrated and yet you are a son of
[1:23:44] God and before God you you can't even
[1:23:49] sin you're an attribute of God the Bible
[1:23:52] says a Son of God cannot even sin which
[1:23:55] means disbelieve the word and that's the
[1:23:59] battle that we constantly fight between
[1:24:02] those two Realms of natural man and
[1:24:05] human man and and the elements of of you
[1:24:08] know and that's why it's important to
[1:24:10] get your rest it's important to get
[1:24:13] proper rest people don't realize that as
[1:24:16] a human being we need rest we need to be
[1:24:20] able to take our rest and and and and
[1:24:24] feed our bodies in the proper way so
[1:24:27] that we can be effective and be you know
[1:24:30] in in the right mood when we come into
[1:24:32] the house of the Lord a lot of the
[1:24:34] people that don't get into the house of
[1:24:36] God is because they're not properly
[1:24:39] timing their their their days and their
[1:24:42] weeks to prepare to get into the house
[1:24:44] of the
[1:24:45] Lord you know that you need to prepare
[1:24:48] if on Wednesdays you know that you know
[1:24:50] Wednesday you you're you're you you want
[1:24:52] to be in the house of God and I believe
[1:24:54] that every single one of us should try
[1:24:56] to be in the house of the Lord every
[1:24:58] time there's a
[1:24:59] service I believe that with all of my
[1:25:02] heart I believe that from the very
[1:25:04] beginning there are times when we can't
[1:25:07] be here because of work because of
[1:25:08] shifts that's completely understandable
[1:25:12] but other than that we should be timing
[1:25:15] and and and using our time properly if
[1:25:18] you need to get a rest on Wednesday
[1:25:21] during the you know maybe you know as
[1:25:23] soon as you get home you don't eat as
[1:25:25] much maybe A light meal and lay down for
[1:25:27] half an hour 20 minutes to half an hour
[1:25:29] do you know that a 20 minute nap can
[1:25:31] recharge you for the whole
[1:25:33] night I had a 20 minute
[1:25:36] nap before I came to to the service
[1:25:40] tonight and it helps it refreshes you
[1:25:43] and you just you just you know and and
[1:25:45] when you do it with the intention that
[1:25:48] you want to be a aware and awake and you
[1:25:51] want to receive everything that God has
[1:25:53] for you God anoints you to be awake God
[1:25:57] anoints you to receive what you
[1:26:01] need you come to church on Wednesday
[1:26:04] nights and on Sundays because you want
[1:26:07] something from the Lord I hope you I I
[1:26:10] hope you're you're you're you know if if
[1:26:11] you're not having that kind of attitude
[1:26:13] that's why preaching Faith cometh by
[1:26:16] hearing and by hearing of the word of
[1:26:18] God and sometimes we need to be reminded
[1:26:20] of these things of why we come into the
[1:26:23] house of the Lord we don't come here to
[1:26:26] do all the other duties and all the
[1:26:29] other positions that we have to do
[1:26:31] unless you're coming early to do it like
[1:26:33] we have Sunday school the Sunday School
[1:26:35] teachers come early they do their thing
[1:26:38] then they then there's some that come to
[1:26:39] the to the platform because they're part
[1:26:41] of the worship team they do their thing
[1:26:44] they realize that you know that they've
[1:26:46] got other duties after the services they
[1:26:49] do those things but the prime the the
[1:26:52] the the primary goal is to get into the
[1:26:55] worship so that you can receive and get
[1:26:59] into Heavenly places where Christ is
[1:27:01] going to speak to you and speak to your
[1:27:04] needs and speak to your circumstances so
[1:27:06] that you leave here better than when you
[1:27:09] came
[1:27:10] in you leave here strengthened by the
[1:27:13] word of God you've got another line upon
[1:27:15] line another precept upon precept
[1:27:18] something that's going to give you the
[1:27:19] strength to get to work on Monday
[1:27:22] morning and and do more and be more and
[1:27:25] be a testimony for Jesus
[1:27:29] Christ this is the hour where listen it
[1:27:33] you know we're Leo deia is blending okay
[1:27:37] we that have recognized the word for our
[1:27:40] day we realize that we've we've we've
[1:27:42] we've actually transitioned out of Le
[1:27:45] oysa but the effects of Leo deia are on
[1:27:48] here and they're lazy they're their lazy
[1:27:52] Spirits constantly wanting to be
[1:27:55] stimulated by TV and constantly wanting
[1:27:58] to be stimulated by the things of the
[1:28:01] world instead of getting stimulation
[1:28:04] from the revelation of God's
[1:28:06] word amen but nothing is more powerful
[1:28:10] nothing is is going to give you more
[1:28:12] strength than when you feed on the word
[1:28:15] of God and you receive what it is that
[1:28:18] you have need of Amen Let The Musicians
[1:28:21] come
[1:28:22] praise
[1:28:25] God
[1:28:32] hallelujah you know when we think
[1:28:37] about presumptuous sin you
[1:28:46] know David just got
[1:28:50] trapped made mistakes
[1:28:53] and we all make
[1:28:55] mistakes every single one of us as long
[1:28:58] as you're still in this human realm here
[1:29:01] you are going to make mistakes know that
[1:29:04] but the blood of Jesus Christ that you
[1:29:08] accepted when you received the power of
[1:29:11] the spirit of God when you repented and
[1:29:13] when you were baptized in the name of
[1:29:15] the Lord Jesus you received his Spirit
[1:29:19] he gave you that spirit so that he could
[1:29:21] keep you
[1:29:23] his Spirit not only speaks to you feeds
[1:29:26] you it keeps
[1:29:28] you it's there you know there's there's
[1:29:31] so much that we could look at and we're
[1:29:33] going to be looking at a lot more about
[1:29:36] what God is going to do and how he's
[1:29:39] going to do it in our lives and how he's
[1:29:40] using each and every one of us Amen to
[1:29:44] fulfill our part in the word of God but
[1:29:46] just know this if you make a mistake get
[1:29:50] up
[1:29:53] repent and move
[1:29:55] on God will not remember it if you have
[1:30:00] truly
[1:30:02] repented he places it under the
[1:30:06] blood in the sea of his
[1:30:08] forgetfulness and only you only you can
[1:30:13] bring it up and allow the devil to use
[1:30:17] it against you because the devil uses
[1:30:20] your memory oh you did it don't tell me
[1:30:23] you didn't do it yeah you might have
[1:30:25] repented and you might have I seen some
[1:30:27] tears coming out of your eyes but you
[1:30:29] still did it and if you're not if you're
[1:30:33] not feeding on the word and reading the
[1:30:36] word where God is telling you that I
[1:30:39] don't remember your sins no more when
[1:30:42] you read about David and David cries out
[1:30:44] and says the mercy of the Lord endureth
[1:30:46] forever Mercy is when when mercy comes
[1:30:49] into your life it's because you deserve
[1:30:52] to be punished you deserved to get
[1:30:55] whipped you deserved to to uh to lose
[1:30:58] certain things you make mistakes on
[1:31:00] investments and and you did it because
[1:31:02] you you you you were just doing it out
[1:31:04] of the wrong motives and you you were
[1:31:06] doing it in the form of gambling instead
[1:31:09] of actually doing it as an investment
[1:31:11] and doing your proper research and
[1:31:13] looking into it and then you lost your
[1:31:15] money and then you and then you know you
[1:31:17] get all
[1:31:19] upset you got to
[1:31:22] realize
[1:31:23] that those things will happen but when
[1:31:27] you truly
[1:31:29] repent and God shows you and you come
[1:31:32] back to God's provided
[1:31:35] way it never happened in the first place
[1:31:38] and you can start fresh and have a brand
[1:31:41] new day amen praise God God bless you
