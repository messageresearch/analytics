midst if you more than get together Lord this is a preaching of your word in the house of the Lord father we thank you we B you welcome right now for the glory of God bless you the reading of your word in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ of Nazareth we pray amen amen and amen now nonon captain of the host of the king of Syria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him the Lord has given Deliverance unto Israel he was also a mighty man of Valor but he was a leper and the syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away captive out of the hand of Israel a little mid and he waited on neon's wife and she said unto her mistress would God my Lord where with there Prophet that is in Samaria for he would recover him of his leprosy and now and one went in and told his Lord saying th and th said the M that is of the land of Israel and the king of Syria said go to go to go and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel and he departed and took with him 10 Talent of silver and said and 6,000 pieces of gold and 10 changes of RA rment and he brought the letter to the king of Syria saying now when this letter is come unto thee behold I have there with send send name and my servant to him that thou might recover him for his leprosy may the Lord add his Blessing for the reading of his word hallelujah my message today the topic is God honor himself by his word go God honor himself by his will there's no other way God will honor himself only by his word God God word is period when God speak is done and it's real and never change and remain the same day hour the minute the second that he spoke that word it will remain forever Hallelujah so when God said I called you he called you it doesn't matter who you are whether a child a servant a slave a woman a man when God calls you you calls you when said when God said you are my son you are his son forever he never change so as we are sitting here who are who are we we are the sons of God the children of God God has purposely made us and called us his son a son always abide in the home a servant comes and go but God Sons is always there so when God say you saved you're Sav period it doesn't matter what you are thank you Lord we going to see something here about neon neon the Bible says he was a man look here because of him the Lord has given Deliverance onto Syria that man that man was something special about him he was good man he was not Israel he was Syrian why God he this man Hallelujah we have to look the meaning of nman nman means present delightful he was a he was a delightful man Livy happiness anytime somebody come he feel welcome Hallelujah if somebody said delightful somebody's delightful you feel he's welcoming man he doesn't have no G in him have no G nothing but meanwhile he was a military man he's a man of Val Syrian they always fighting with the the land of Israel but why God has to bring this man name in the Bible and all the same time heal him that means there was something about this man God want to glorify himself it doesn't matter if God want to glorify himself he can bring anything purposely that's why when something happened to anybody you cannot just sit down and talk about that person I said believe you don't know what God has brought that to that man how he's going to use that man for His Glory Hallelujah we are brethren we are God people God people is love God doesn't laugh to somebody who is in in need or who who is sick or who is who who has a brish because we know every sickness any deformed person come from Satan and if you are a Believer or God's son when you see that you know the enemy has struck that person so what we have to do is oh Lord have mercy upon this man what can I do to help this man is there anything Lord you want me to do as a Believer what you have to do whisper a little prayer in your heart oh God because we as we are sitting here we don't just come here the mercy and the grace of God has brought us here we didn't come here by ourself Hallelujah there's a purpose why God has brought us here each and everyone has has a purpose each and everyone has a position to be fulfilled if God can bring somebody that is this man and and and brought him to his presentence to glorify himself what about you right now where is God as we are sitting here why is God God is in you if you sitting here if you are walking around and you talking about God and where is God God is here amen because he said I'll be in you even I'll will be with you even in you till the end of this world so where is God God is in you you can do anything with God hallelujah if you believe the message that God have called you into Hallelujah as I always said we are powerful than what we think you can create your own atmosphere Hallelujah when Satan see you is scree because of your presence look here in the time when the Lord Jesus Christ was here or when let's say after he left and Peter and he came back and dwell among the people of the the the disciples what the Bible said when they were walking on the street people intentionally bring the lame people and sick people and lay them on the street for the shadow of these brothers to touch them and the Bible said when they bring them the faith that they brought them and the faith that they believe that God is in them that Faith healed those sickness so we are special people do not underestimate yourself Hallelujah and this man in his time there was a man okay and I I I ask you the meaning of a prophet a prophet is a person who God speak who speak sorry a person who who speaks for God that's the mean of a prophet that is a minister right now a prophet is God a man who God speak through so when a brother or a minister standing here when you speak the word of God I'm talking about a real call ministers because the Bible tells us that we have false prophet false ministers so when God when a true Minister that call from God standing the pulpit and he ministering anything can happen if you believe Hallelujah because that man is Anointed it doesn't matter how shape or form that person is if that person is being called by God himself and is standing in the Pulpit bringing forth the word of God you have to know that even if you're sick or whatever is happening if you believe in your heart and you believe that man something will take place in your life Hallelujah let me tell you to stand here to minister is not just like somebody standing on the pulpit and go and went to school and bringing to be his Perfection this is not a Perfection this is a calling from God hallelujah brother Braham didn't have no education okay he didn't have no education he didn't call by Ed brother Abraham when he was passing under the tree and God spoke to him he was a a a young man he was a young man he scared he ran to his father and murder God call him from the day that he was born so this gift God calls you said gift and calling I will die repentance amen Hal Hallelujah before I didn't know I never knew that I'm going to stand here to preach to stand anywhere to talk about God because I didn't know him but he know me he knows you amen one time I was 9 years old I was sitting outside playing and God spoke to me I didn't know what is that all of a sudden it just came to me just like that get up go here I went I scared but I didn't know where I'm going I went and the thing that God want to show me he show me amen and I came and brought the people and the thing was right there to manifest because was Act of sin that they know supposed to how do you know nothing about that how do you know every person that's sitting here God knew you before you here today there's a purpose in our life so if we leave to see that purpose you will see Hallelujah this man name man was a Syrian a great man a man of Honor Mighty Man of Valor sometime things happen to people they don't understand it your physical mind that's why every everything you everything you cannot put your mouth or your talk about it you don't know what God is doing just just just pray because you know whatever you speaking your Chambers God know about it before that talk comes to your mind God know about it you cannot fool God you can sit here that you are believer or you are God knows your heart the pastor did not know the pastor word the pastor job is to bring forth the word of God and you have to grasp it for for you to grow and maturity in the word of God so that when the time comes you have something to speak about God and God can take that word and manifest through to honor himself so if you sit in the presence of God you don't take nothing there's nothing for you to speak about when God speak to you he only speak to the people through his word no other than that not my word not anybody's word it doesn't matter whether your philosopher your philosophy your pro your your what what you call uh those people in the in the in the college you are the professor God doesn't care about your professing he doesn't care about your books that you learn in your mind he care about what he put inside that chamber your heart there where he dwells that's where the where he going to speak you through and that thing there when he speak he go there and bring to your mind and when you speak something will take place Hallelujah this is this words this every time I Minister I want to let the people know that God that we serve is real it's not just we talk about the the Bible that is written here we want to bring the reality that the god that we serve is real it's not that we come to church to sit down to see one another but my my desire in my heart to present him real real to you that the god that we serve is real what is written here is these things that the Bible that we read every time is the people the same like you and me that happen and that they they they put in the book that this is what God did when Bible said he took the Israelites from there to Canaan it's not just a word it's not just letter it's reality and when he spoke to the prophet he put a mouth in the prophet all them from Moses to the Elijah to them those men was the same men like me and you that God chose them to speak through to bring to honor that word that he put inside there and those word that he spoke through them did this word here is still inspired every word in this BBL is inspired it can bring if you put that if you speak that word and you bring it to reality as God put it that inspiration will come and manifest exactly what is in the Bible amen hallelujah amen this is reality so when I come here my my desire is for the people to know the reality and the power of God that he has given to us that is not different than the those people that were there the the the the the the the the the disciples and the Israelites how God spoke to them this man here when that thing happened you know this man was a warrior and they went to Israel and capture a little a little Maid that to me that maid was a Believer up to now I would say he she was a Believer and they took her over there and that believer know and believe her God is God her God can heal sickness she said that man if he goes to that prophet you understand he will get his healing so that woman spoke that word reality and what that word that he spoke was inspired inspiration from God so that's why I'm saying when you hear the word in the PO the word comes to your heart and you believe that word can bring exactly manifestation as God wants us to bring it amen you think that lady he didn't hear Elijah she saw manifestation of the Israelites he knew that they have God do we have God the god of Abraham is the same God that is here today tonight she never changed that God never change hallelujah what he did through the prophet right now anything that God wants to do you will can do it here right now if the is sitting on the whe chair right here and God want to hear him the same time where how he did Brother she that criple will stand up and walk Hallelujah because the word that Prophet spoke was not the words of the Prophet himself it was the word of God in him coming out from that from that vessel that God has he has yielded himself to to manifest through Hallelujah so when we comes to church and the minister standing here the pastor standing here or any Minister standing here preaching is not just the word that he's bringing it's reality it can change anything any time any moment hallelujah thank you because I see I spoke the word this and that and I saw the manifestation of the word so when I'm preaching the gospel I am very very serious and I I'm I believe the word that I'm bringing forth I know that word doesn't come it come from the word of God I because I know my own word cannot do nothing to you but if that word come by the word of God by inspiration yes he can accomplish anything in your life Hallelujah so let us take this words because we are in the last days this word that we hear is the one that is going to take us home no other words praise God if you want to go to the Rapture I don't speak Mysteries I speak what God has given to me I speak my language everybody speak his own language brother Pastor speak his own language I speak my own language everybody every Minister has his own language that he speak because we are not the same no man is the same no every man is different and God uses different Hallelujah if God can can tell me to to speak somebody to get up and walk not don't think everybody every Minister has any gift that is in God in God every gift that God is is in that Minister but he has his own time to use that Minister whenever you want Hallelujah and all come by why faith your faith going to break the manifestation of God hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah so this lady this this mid spoke that word to the wife of this NE man that man there he was you know the sickness that he has leprosy leprosy type sin Hallelujah so when she spoke that word to this woman the wife of neon the wife spoke to that word too the husband and the husband spoke that word to the king you see when you speak the word and that is liary it goes like a fire he going like a fire praise God let me tell you how how this this Bible here is life at the same time is deadly it's not a joke it's life and it's deadly if you don't handled well you can kill somebody with it you know why Elijah I think either Elijah or I think I think was Elisha when he get the word of God and she was going he was going and the children was running after him you bore her like like brother Des here you bore her and old man who stinky and he turned around and he said the beer will come and devour you 30 of them he came and WIP a beer came and wiped of them and another one came he wiped all of them just like that don't play with the word of God is real and it's Liv at the same time is deadly Hallelujah the word in your mouth is deadly is dead to your children dead to your neighbor and it's Li to your neighbor it's Li to your children is liy to anybody and the same time is deadly to anybody Hallelujah this world is good at the same time it's life at the same time is dead what how God is going to devour this un circumstan philistin and all those right now by his word his word the spoken word god did everything by Spoken Word now where the spoken word will come from you do you think the Lord Jesus Christ will come and stand here and speak that word again no he has chosen his children to speak that word I don't care whether you a woman your child your boy or your a father your mother or whatever you are if the word of God comes to your mouth speak it why you why you scared why you standing why you crying why you muring your husband sick you can pray for him your wife sick you can't pray for him your daughter sick you can't pray for him your grandchildren sick you can't pray for him you always want to pick up a a phone call brother or sister to pray for my son or my this my dad that's good but that is not enough the word of God is in you act on the word of God and see the fa the Salvation that God has given to you and see if you going to be the same way you will never see the you never be the same way why why I'm screaming because I see the power of God when he manifest right into my eye so I have I have confidence in the word of God so when I come here I want everybody to have confidence the word that comes through the pet here it's not just the brother have study and bring that that word for you no it's real it's life Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord so this girl when he spoke to that man there the man pick up gold he didn't just go he picked up gold silver everything and the King sent him to go see what what whatever where what if what they get is really is true if our God today is a God is the same God like yesterday today and forever he the same thing when something comes to you stand up have faith in God for every word that we hear from the poet here we are buil on the basis upon the word of God in this church here amen hallelujah this church is not just a normal church that is out there this is the Church of God the church the Lord Jesus Christ himself the message of the hour we stand upon the word of God hallelujah it's not by own listen here it doesn't matter how much education the person has he has nothing to do with that he has what God has placed in that person Hallelujah and then sometime we going to see here and when this man went he brought the letter to the king of Israel saying now when this letter comes to thee behold I have therewi with sent name and my servant to thee that thou might recover of his leprosy and see the answer of the king every word that God everything that God had made has he has to go to a perfect place before the manifestation comes and it came to pass when the king of Israel heard and read the letter and he ran his clothes and said am am am I God to kill and to make a life that this man do send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy consider I pray you and see how sick Sith to C against me the the King when he hear this man the letter he he was rough rent his Grove say he's not God how can he somebody that has a Ley and all those things he can cuz no these people they try to trick me they want to fight with me instead of Israelite he's supposed to know that every spiritual thing goes to who the prophet he he he he he he didn't recognize that's why I'm saying you have to recognize your position and who you are you understand in this church here we have a pastor that's Pastor Danny and we have ministers and Israelites every time they have a prophet they have prophets prophets God prophets too inside but God has chosen one that he has to work for the whole nation he the mouth PE of the whole nation see when God set up the church the pastor is he that God has chosen to stand for the flocks we ministers around him we are helpers yes so when God want to do anything he comes to the minister that word has to go to the pastor you can't take charge for what you because you a minister you have that same quality but God has chosen one man that's the pastor that that word has go through so he has to deal with the situation when he goes through then maybe he said he will God will speak through him send this one do this one do this one maybe you will send one of the ministers God will speak to him and and he would go will tell him what to do we are around him cannot tell him what to do because God knew him that all these flocks here God plac under his hands we are not responsible for the flocks of the church he is responsible for the flock of he is going to answer everything that he do for you and me amen so you never byass the pastor and speak through the you can you can you can speak because there's a there's a he has anointed us and put it in position that he can come through us when he comes through us we have to subject to him then he will do what God tells him to do you understand you don't take we don't take things our own hands so this man the case reach Elijah let me read here and it and it was so when elishah the man of God had heard that the king of Israel has ran his clothes that he sent to the king saying wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes close let him come now to me and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel that King was not a prophet and the girl told him there's a prophet so the king supposed to know there's a prophet in Israel whom God speak through you understand so when anything happen God has chosen the man of God in this church the pastor that he does the spiritual things so anything that comes he has to go to him first before anything unless maybe we are outside and God want to use you and then God will tells you what to do and then you bring the message to the pastor what God has done through you and then the testimony come and what it honor God it glorify God so we don't take things our hands we have to put in the place where it belongs to a deacon the Tres they all has their position where the word of God has to be Hallelujah do you hear hear what I'm saying this is not my word this is the word of God hallelujah so so what happened there let's see so neon came with his horses and with his Chariot and stood at the door of the House of Elisha and Elisha sent a messenger unto him saying go and wash in Jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shall be clean see how simple the word of God come in Simplicity it didn't come and say oh go bring $1,000 and put in the handkerchief and just tied it up I'm going to pray tonight and this and that or maybe go bring the folder water so I can sprinkle it and go to see God and speak to God tonight no he spoke the word of God God has spoken to him go wash thyself seven times and you shall be clean C you come to the pastor you have a trouble you have a situation you go to your pastor oh Pastor I have this and then he tell you very simple thing go and say sorry to the brother or the sister that you offended your sickness shall be clean come on when I went I thought the pastor has anointed oil in the corner you going to pour in my head thou shall be healed go thy way thou shall be healed in the name of Jesus because he didn't do that he just go and apologize tell your brother or your sister you're sorry and thou shall behold it's so simple the people doesn't want that they want the Deep things and you going to take he he got to you want the pastor to tell you go fast seven days and come back come back 7 days and after 7 days you come I anoint you with the oil and this and that because he tell you simple thing go and do this things just a simple thing tell your sister or brother I'm sorry and thou shall behold go and restore the the the the the trouble that you have done and God you bring back your things there right there he said oh so simple go wash thyself seven times the man get rough man I thought this man going to come and meet me I am a mighty man of Valor I'm this I'm that I'm that he get really mad he send back sometime the pastor tells you do this do this straight to your life and this you get Mar at Pastor why are you a son are you a sheep or your goat what you want to be one day I was I was solving the I was solving a problem and you know what the person said he is a man that cancel me how can you tell your pastor like that your pastor is a man just a man that can see you you don't respect that man that is standing for you praying all night for his flock protecting you and you saying this to is just a man what kind of dis disrespectful talk like that brother let us live right and watch our mouth the things that we say it bring condemnation to our and then we get the problem you come back Pastor pray for me how can the pastor pray you don't respect him how you going to get your your your answer you can't do that I'm sorry to speak in speaking like this but this is what God has given to me you understand you disrespect him God will not honor you God honor You by his own word the word that he has pred in him that's where you going to bless without without respecting him you will never bless I don't care how much degree you have I don't care how much knowledge you have for the word of God if you disrespect your pastor you will not be honored by God no respect him and be serious that he's a man of God and believe in him you don't believe in him there's nothing that he can do for you you have to have faith in God that Faith you have to have faith in your pastor that when you pray for you you will get what you need amen you don't have faith in him you will not get nothing I'm not speaking to only this church all the churches God churches we are this the children are taking our own blessing out from ourself God has blessed us so much and when the blessings come we just go like this and he goes and it's so simple you understand and so when this man left he went home and you know what little girl said oh so if this man tells you go here and take this city go here and Conquer here go here and do this won't you go this man this this man tell you just a simple thing go dig yourself seven times in the River Jordan and you shall be clean you are the one who sick not the prophet or the pastor sck you are the one who has the problem so if you got M who are you getting M to yourself you are going to die you those is in the in in the prophet in the man of God so he gave you the medicine you have to take the medicine it doesn't matter how bitter it not every time you're going to drink sweet things sometime you have to drink bitter you don't know fever medicine we call quinine it's very yellow little little and sometime liquid that que is very bitter but when you had a fever African fever they give it to you they have to cross hold your here and go here and they put inside because it's so bitter and when you when you drink them cine all the fever will go away sometime the pastor has to be hard on you he has to give you a bitter medicine and if you able to take that bitter medicine the following day all your sickness sh it's gone all your problem is gone respect obedient to the word of God don't think it's a man that's standing here any Minister that's standing here don't think he just a man God has ordained last time I give my testimony I was not
