[1:27] [Music]
[1:53] I don't have any other
[4:57] [Laughter]
[5:19] First, that microphone is
[5:23] God bless
[5:38] you. Don't run.
[7:29] Sure. Are they good?
[8:20] Good evening and welcome to the first
[8:23] ever BAO awards and graduation ceremony
[8:28] live. Amen.
[8:31] I'm just excited to be here and I want
[8:34] to thank everybody for for coming,
[8:37] taking the long some of them long
[8:39] journeys and I'm just going to take my
[8:41] give myself I wish we could sing a song
[8:42] or something like that to kind of get my
[8:44] my own nerves down a little bit but uh I
[8:48] just want to greet everybody and welcome
[8:50] you here. I know many have come from
[8:52] some long distances. We have many
[8:55] different ones that have pastors,
[8:57] ministers that have even are coming and
[8:58] then heading back to to preach on
[9:00] Sunday. And I I'm personally just so
[9:02] humbled that you'd make the effort and
[9:05] to to come these this long way and take
[9:08] even your time, your funds to to be part
[9:10] of this. And it's it's super I'm just so
[9:12] I'm so thrilled. It's very special. And
[9:15] uh it's to me a little bit of an
[9:18] incredible moment to be standing in this
[9:19] way. I I definitely did not anticipate
[9:22] this 5 years ago to have to be uh in
[9:25] this position but uh you
[9:29] know it's a very very special thing to
[9:32] have a school that's
[9:35] wordfounded message believing and uh
[9:38] that's available to the to the bride
[9:41] around the world and I I'm just happy to
[9:43] be a small part of that and I I I didn't
[9:46] want to even go too far before I just
[9:48] said to Brother Donnie and the
[9:51] congregation. Uh we just want to thank
[9:52] you from the depths of our hearts for
[9:54] giving us the ability to have this this
[9:56] moment here.
[9:57] We just wouldn't have been able to do it
[9:59] without without
[10:03] that. All the believers that have helped
[10:06] even prepare and I I I couldn't name the
[10:09] different ones and brother Scott, Sister
[10:11] Carrie, Brother Mike, Sister Sarah,
[10:13] Sister Kaylor, and so many that that I
[10:15] haven't been able to personally meet
[10:17] yet, but it just means so much to us.
[10:19] And from the depths of our heart, thank
[10:21] you. My my mind goes back to the
[10:25] earliest. But I'm just going to give you
[10:26] a little bit of history and and for some
[10:28] of you who don't even maybe even know
[10:29] who I am, I'm brother Michael Ray. I I
[10:32] hail from North Country up in Vancouver
[10:34] area. But uh back in 2012, Brother
[10:38] Biscll uh mentioned the desire to have a
[10:41] distance school for believers and we of
[10:44] course had a brickandmortar school,
[10:46] Bible Academy. and he just saw the need
[10:50] to maybe extend that to others that
[10:52] wouldn't have the ability to maybe have
[10:54] a school that we had there and he
[10:56] desired to to make something available
[10:58] in that way. And I I think of the
[11:00] scripture where the scripture says in
[11:02] Proverbs, where there's no vision, the
[11:04] people perish. And brother Bis had a had
[11:06] a had a vision and it was desiring and
[11:09] and to to present this some way. And it
[11:11] it uh it was a journey and the journey
[11:13] began and it took a lot of just we
[11:16] adjusted and altered and tested
[11:18] different things.
[11:19] And Ecclesiastes says to everything
[11:22] there's a time and a season. And so we
[11:25] carry the we had maybe the the vision
[11:27] but maybe it wasn't the right time or
[11:28] the right season. But I also love the
[11:31] scripture that says for the vision is
[11:33] yet for an appointed time but at the end
[11:35] it shall speak and not lie. And though
[11:37] it tar wait for it because it will
[11:39] surely come it will not tear. And that's
[11:42] why for me I feel like it's such an
[11:44] incredible moment is because we're
[11:45] actually standing in the manifestation
[11:48] of a of the vision. And uh and that's to
[11:51] me just so precious because seven years
[11:53] later to the very month uh Sister Jenny,
[11:57] myself and brother Barry and Sister
[11:59] Becky met I believe in November of of uh
[12:02] 2019. And uh Sister Becky and brother
[12:05] Barry have also had a real burden and
[12:07] desire for for a school like this. And
[12:10] we met in their house in in uh in West
[12:14] in Virginia. In Virginia better get that
[12:18] right. Yeah. We wouldn't want to mistake
[12:20] some of those
[12:21] details. And uh even in the midst of it,
[12:24] you know, for something to come to
[12:26] manifestation, you sometimes have to go
[12:27] through some difficulty. And we we had
[12:29] to let Miss Leonard go or she had to go
[12:31] and see her help her family and her
[12:34] grandparents and she left the BCA. But
[12:37] I've said it multiple times, without
[12:38] Miss Leonard doing that, we wouldn't be
[12:40] standing here today. We wouldn't even be
[12:42] having this because Miss Leonard is is
[12:44] the heart and soul of this school. And
[12:48] Yeah, but there's a so God had an
[12:50] appointed time for this to come to to
[12:53] manifestation and there from that
[12:55] November 19 2019 meeting something
[12:58] blossomed and a school was born and it
[13:01] was built on a burden to protect and
[13:03] preserve the principles of this message
[13:05] and to offer an atmosphere where the
[13:08] students could be taught not just
[13:09] academics but truth by god-fearing Holy
[13:13] Ghostfilled teachers and it was never
[13:16] just for one just a little region here
[13:18] there was just a desire to be for the
[13:19] whole world and and I can truly say
[13:21] that's what it is because we have ones
[13:22] from all over and even teachers from
[13:24] South Africa and so it's a special a
[13:27] special thing the Lord has allowed us to
[13:28] have and so this isn't just an awards or
[13:30] graduation or anything ordinary it's a
[13:32] great milestone and it's the first time
[13:34] many of us has even have have even met
[13:36] face to face interesting after uh you
[13:39] know virtual classrooms and screens and
[13:41] all of that and you can finally go oh
[13:42] there's the 3D version of you well you
[13:44] look so different all I ever saw was 2D
[13:47] but Uh it it's special to be able to see
[13:49] each one, make the connections and and
[13:51] just uh you know embrace each other, the
[13:53] different ones after they've never you
[13:55] know first time seeing each other and
[13:56] it's I'm just so grateful to be part of
[13:58] that. And so to our parents that are
[14:01] here and the family and supporters, you
[14:04] know, you're unseen heroes. Uh you've
[14:06] prayed and you've trusted and stood by
[14:08] the the vision. And I thought of those
[14:10] that were I know there's some and maybe
[14:12] some remarks will be made that have been
[14:14] here from the very beginning and some
[14:17] you know willing to take really that
[14:18] step into the unknown because it was a
[14:21] lot unknown. We didn't really know what
[14:22] we were about to uh adventure on but
[14:25] your faith made it possible for this to
[14:28] to manifest. And to our teachers, I I
[14:31] wanted just to say as we start out, and
[14:32] I know not everyone is here, and so
[14:34] hopefully they hear me, and each one
[14:36] that's here on the stage, your sacrifice
[14:38] has not gone unnoticed. Sister Becky,
[14:41] you've been a real anchor throughout the
[14:43] whole five years we've been here and
[14:44] before in the planning and different
[14:46] ones, Sister Abigail, Sister Kaylor,
[14:48] Sister Carol, each one of you have, you
[14:50] know, been supporters right from the
[14:51] beginnings. And we just so thankful for
[14:53] what you put into the school, allowing
[14:55] us to be here this way. Thank you from
[14:57] my heart. Appreciate you.
[15:02] What I was thinking is that you're able
[15:03] to see the through the imperfections of
[15:05] all our little uh hurdles and mistakes
[15:07] and all of that. And and I just I'm so
[15:10] thankful that you're able to contribute
[15:12] to this great tapestry. And I want to I
[15:15] do want to say some special words, Miss
[15:16] Leonard, as we start this evening. I was
[15:18] trying to put some words together and I
[15:20] thought, well, is there anything
[15:22] adequate that I could say? And then I
[15:24] just really kind of went dot dot dot. I
[15:26] said, "No, there's not really adequate
[15:28] words and uh but you've poured more into
[15:31] this school than probably all of us
[15:33] indeed. And
[15:35] uh tireless devotion and burden." And I
[15:38] was thinking of all the the children and
[15:40] young people. It's really like their own
[15:42] they're your own. You've nurtured them.
[15:45] You've encouraged them. You've guided
[15:46] and corrected and even championed them.
[15:49] And through you, Christ, I thought
[15:51] Christ has actually been expressed
[15:52] through you to all these young people
[15:54] here. And that's something so so
[15:57] precious. And they'll take what you've
[15:59] expressed to them really. Christ lived
[16:01] out before them. And thank you so
[16:11] much. So as we start this wonderful
[16:14] evening and I pray you all enjoy it to
[16:16] the to the maximum. I want to just
[16:18] express my most deepest gratitude to our
[16:21] gratitude to my Lord Jesus because it's
[16:24] really without him none of this would
[16:25] have ever transpired. And so I want to
[16:27] give all praise and thanksgiving to him
[16:29] for the wisdom and understanding that
[16:31] he's given us for our courage and
[16:33] perseverance really to press through
[16:34] maybe some difficult moments and times.
[16:37] But every bit of good that we have have
[16:39] seen through these last five years is
[16:40] all because of him. And so we just give
[16:43] him all the praise tonight as we
[16:44] celebrate five years of growth. and if
[16:46] he would give us more years. Uh we pray
[16:50] if time would go forward, we'd maybe
[16:51] reach a 10-y year anniversary, but let's
[16:55] not forget the one who authored it all.
[16:57] And so this evening, I I just bask in
[17:00] really what God has done and allowed us
[17:02] to to be part of and I thank you for
[17:04] coming and may you
[17:06] enjoy well experience it was kind of the
[17:08] term live here BCA's fifth awards
[17:12] ceremony and graduation. God bless you.
[17:14] Why don't we stand and we'll have a word
[17:16] of prayer as we open the
[17:23] evening. Heavenly
[17:28] Father, I am just so thankful to be part
[17:32] of the family of God. Lord, that we can
[17:35] have this opportunity not just to have a
[17:38] an evening of a ceremony of such, but
[17:40] Lord, if we can realize we've had a very
[17:44] rare moment that we can connect with
[17:47] your people, your bride from different
[17:49] nations and from around the country and
[17:52] around the world. And Lord, get a little
[17:54] taste of what it might just be when we
[17:56] cross over into eternity. and we'll sit
[17:59] at a table, Lord, and there'll be faces
[18:00] that we've never seen before. But
[18:02] there's something inside of our soul
[18:04] that unites us, Lord, because it's your
[18:06] life. It's your word, and that's what is
[18:08] the bond of this little school that
[18:10] you've given us. So tonight, Lord, I
[18:13] give you all the thanksgiving and the
[18:14] praise. and pray Lord Jesus that you
[18:17] would come and be so present tonight as
[18:19] we Lord honor students and their Lord
[18:23] what they've done the labors through the
[18:24] year and the graduates Lord as they've
[18:26] now come to this milestone moment in
[18:27] their life as they transition Lord Lord
[18:31] we do pray that you would just blanket
[18:33] us Lord with your presence and we
[18:36] dedicate the evening and commit every
[18:37] aspect to you and your care in Jesus
[18:40] Christ's name.
[18:41] Amen. Amen. You may have your seats.
[18:46] All right. God bless you. Here's Miss
[18:47] Leonard.
[18:50] Welcome everyone. This is definitely an
[18:53] exciting, very monumentous occasion and
[18:56] I'm so thrilled to have you all in one
[18:58] place. Um, I saw the kids up here
[19:01] singing last night and I just thought it
[19:04] kind of overwhelmed me and I thought,
[19:06] "Don't start crying." And then I looked
[19:08] at brother Aaron and his eyes were all
[19:11] welled up and I was like, Aaron, don't
[19:14] start. It was too late. Um, but just to
[19:17] see all of you in the same place
[19:20] together getting to fellowship with each
[19:22] other. It's wonderful. So, I'm so glad
[19:25] that you were all able to come. I know a
[19:28] lot of families made sacrifices to be
[19:30] here and uh we appreciate you. We thank
[19:34] you for coming. I also know we're
[19:36] connected on Zoom to a lot of your
[19:38] classmates who couldn't be here. So to
[19:40] those of you on Zoom, um, welcome. And,
[19:44] uh, I hope you get a little piece of the
[19:46] enjoyment that we've had this
[19:48] weekend. And I want to also say thank
[19:51] you, if I haven't already, to Brother
[19:52] Michael for all the kind words. And um,
[19:56] we want to start by making sure every
[19:59] single student gets up on the stage this
[20:02] evening. And so we're going to hand out
[20:05] report cards first. Now, I would
[20:08] recommend students, don't open your
[20:10] report cards until you leave. Your
[20:13] evening may or your weekend may be more
[20:15] enjoyable if you leave that seal closed.
[20:18] So, let's not open them and strew report
[20:20] cards and leave them lying on the chairs
[20:22] and things. Just leave the folder
[20:23] closed. But when I call your name, um,
[20:26] I'd like for you to come up to the
[20:27] stage. You're going to receive your, uh,
[20:31] report card from Mrs. coffee and then
[20:33] we're going to have all of you line up
[20:35] here. Mrs. Carol will tell you where to
[20:36] stand and um we're going to take a group
[20:40] photo. Okay? So, when I call your name,
[20:43] come up and get your report card, but
[20:45] don't leave. Stay here so we can take
[20:46] your picture. These are all the students
[20:49] who are here this weekend. So, when you
[20:53] hear your name called, come on up.
[20:55] Alicia

[20:59] Arazola, Rachel
[21:01] Arazola, Josiah
[21:04] Ber, Samuel

[21:26] Sarah
[21:27] Morton, Ethan
[21:30] Peele, Bethany
[21:33] Sanger. I have to stop on this student.
[21:36] And if you come to BAOO devotions,
[21:38] you'll know why. Autumn Slacka, today is
[21:41] National Mushroom Hunting
[21:45] Day. I think Autumn comes to devotions
[21:47] just to hear the holiday
[21:49] [Laughter]
[21:52] sometimes. Continuing
[21:55] on, Bell
[21:58] Slacka, Christian
[22:01] Slacka, Elelliana
[22:04] Selacta, Justice
[22:06] Selacta. We have a lot of selectas. They
[22:09] are not all from one family.
[22:12] Gracie
[22:14] Vest, Isaac
[22:18] Walbert, Abby
[22:21] Wilson, and Cara Yesi. And it looks like
[22:24] I have created quite
[22:27] the traffic jam here in the front. Uh so
[22:31] while they're getting this group
[22:33] together, I do have a couple of
[22:35] housekeeping items that I can share with
[22:37] you this evening. Um, and that is if you
[22:43] have not paid for dinner, the anything
[22:48] from the BAO merch table or the
[22:52] activities today. Um, you can take care
[22:55] of that this evening. If you have your
[22:59] if you have cash for dinner, you can
[23:00] actually give that to Mrs. Willis. um
[23:03] and try to take care of that before we
[23:06] leave today because I know some people
[23:07] are leaving town and different things.
[23:09] Uh the other thing I wanted to mention
[23:12] is I have next year's registration
[23:14] gifts. So if you are already registered
[23:17] for next year, I would give you a round
[23:20] of applause and say kudos to you. Thank
[23:22] you so much. I have your registration
[23:24] gifts here to give to you. Um come and
[23:28] see me for those. I know a lot of you
[23:31] have said to me, "Oh, I haven't
[23:33] registered yet." If you're planning on
[23:34] registering as soon as you go home, I
[23:37] can go ahead and give you that
[23:38] registration gift to take with you. So,
[23:40] I would love to send those home with
[23:42] you, especially if you're not in the US.
[23:45] Um, just
[23:47] because, well, maybe it's just me.
[23:49] Brother Michael never pushes too hard,
[23:50] but we're on a budget, so we we're going
[23:52] to try to save on postage and send those
[23:54] with you today.
[23:56] So, well, this is uh shaping up to look
[23:59] like a great
[24:05] group. Matt Fisher, he left. I
[24:11] forgot. Pardon? Oh, maybe we should.
[24:15] Yeah. Can I hand you this?
[25:55] Let's give these guys, yes, a round of
[25:57] applause. And you guys can all head off
[25:59] that way and go back to your
[26:00] [Applause]
[26:04] seats. They are the reason that we're
[26:06] here. So, we give them the biggest
[26:08] applause of all this evening.
[26:11] I wanted to uh start our award giving
[26:14] with um our annual Bible trivia
[26:16] tournament. So this year the theme was
[26:18] the book of Esther and we had three
[26:20] levels that included uh students of all
[26:23] ages at the school. Some of them were
[26:26] easy questions like uh what was Morai's
[26:28] relationship to Esther? But there were
[26:30] hard ones like who is King Xerxes father
[26:33] which I didn't know the answer to until
[26:36] I researched it myself. Um, but the kids
[26:38] made a great showing and there were
[26:41] several
[26:42] winners and I have them on my slide
[26:48] here. For level one,
[26:51] um, we
[26:53] had in first place, Joseph
[26:56] Lacawani. Um, second place was Bethany.
[27:00] They're not here today, but Aaliyah is
[27:01] here. So, Aaliyah, you come on up. We
[27:03] only have two of the students here, so
[27:05] I'm kind of going to fly through these a
[27:06] little bit quickly. Uh, and Mrs. uh,
[27:09] Mrs. Coffee will give you your award and
[27:12] you can get your picture. And level two,
[27:16] Sabrina Lacuani was our first place
[27:18] winner. Eliza Coffee was second place
[27:22] and Bethany Martin was third place. Now,
[27:24] you may notice some of these kids keep
[27:26] cropping up, uh, which was pretty
[27:28] amazing. They
[27:30] studied. Come on up, Aaliyah. you can
[27:32] come
[27:33] on. Uh the that one. Yeah. And the the
[27:37] ribbon that's uh third. For level three,
[27:41] we had Brianna Wanie first place. One of
[27:45] our graduates, Joy Walbert, was second
[27:47] place. So Joy, come on up. And in third
[27:49] place, Bethany. Now, I have to point out
[27:53] the first place winners for each
[27:54] category are all from the same family.
[27:57] And so when I texted their mother, I was
[27:59] like, "They didn't get help, did they?"
[28:01] She said, "Praise God. We've been
[28:04] studying."
[28:05] So, they they represented well. Uh, and
[28:09] you may have noticed Bethany, uh, I
[28:11] figure they're on the Zoom this evening.
[28:13] She placed in every single category. So,
[28:16] she's a fifth grader. Miss McNelte,
[28:18] sixth grader. And so, she placed in
[28:21] every category, beating out some of our
[28:23] 11th and 12th graders. So, let's give
[28:25] those girls a hand. Congratulations,
[28:27] girls.
[28:33] Okay, we'll continue on with our
[28:34] attendance awards. Um, Mrs. Coffee will
[28:37] be presenting those as well, and we'll
[28:40] just do a group photo on those instead
[28:42] of and not individuals. I'm going to
[28:44] announce the students whether they're
[28:46] here or not. But if you are here and you
[28:48] hear your name, come on
[28:50] up. For attendance, um, we'll start with
[28:54] faithful attendance. Faithful attendance
[28:57] is awarded to students
[29:02] who have over 95% attendance. So it it's
[29:07] an it's a top-notch group over 90%
[29:10] attendance. Uh when we calculate this,
[29:13] we also count tardies. Three tardies is
[29:15] an absence. And um we we try to
[29:19] encourage everybody to of course, you
[29:21] know, be in attendance at the live
[29:22] session since we only get to see you
[29:24] once a week and we feel like it's really
[29:26] important for them to be there and get
[29:30] the content and I know that it's a
[29:32] family effort. So, thank you to the
[29:34] entire family for making it a priority.
[29:37] We appreciate you. Again, when you hear
[29:40] your name, go ahead and come up. If the
[29:42] student's not here, you'll see their
[29:43] picture here. For faithful attendance,
[29:46] we have
[29:47] Ariana,
[29:49] Elellaner,
[29:52] Elias,
[29:55] Zach,
[29:57] Luke,
[30:00] Abigail,
[30:02] Nathan,
[30:05] Sabrina,
[30:07] Bethany, No,
[30:10] Emmy,
[30:12] Joseph, and Elliot.
[30:16] Sarah
[30:18] Morton, Ethan
[30:21] Peele, Belle
[30:25] Slacka, Christian
[30:27] Slacka, Brianna Wanie, and Cara Yesi.
[30:32] So, if you got faithful attendance, come
[30:34] on up and get your award and get a group
[30:36] photo. Let's give those kids a round of
[30:38] applause.
[31:04] our next category, thank you all, is
[31:06] perfect attendance. Now, um, perfect
[31:09] attendance is a much smaller group
[31:11] because for perfect attendance, that
[31:13] means they have no recorded absences or
[31:15] tardies for the entire duration of the
[31:18] school year. Now, it's a very small
[31:20] percentage and difficult to earn. And it
[31:23] becomes more difficult the more classes
[31:25] that you take. So, a full-time student
[31:27] that's taking four or five or six
[31:29] classes, it's actually really impressive
[31:31] to not be late or miss one class the
[31:34] entire year. So, um again, we appreciate
[31:38] the families, the commitment that you
[31:40] make to be there and uh to make it a
[31:42] priority. So, thank you so much. For
[31:45] perfect attendance, we'll start with
[31:48] Elena
[31:50] Ber, Algra
[31:52] Coleman, Henley
[31:56] Coleman, Abigail
[32:00] Garvin, Autumn
[32:02] Slacka, Autumn. I also want you to know
[32:04] today is National Cherry Cobbler
[32:08] Day. and Analise
[32:12] Lamb as well as Justice
[32:17] Slacka, Isaac
[32:21] Walbert, Joey
[32:23] Walbert, and Abby
[32:26] Wilson. Let's give those children a
[32:28] round of applause.
[32:38] [Applause]
[32:51] Now, if you're on the Zoom call, you
[32:54] will be getting your certificate in the
[32:57] mail with your report card as soon as
[32:59] Miss Leonard gets home and untangles
[33:01] things. Uh, I'll be sending certificates
[33:03] and uh, report cards to those who
[33:05] couldn't attend this weekend. For those
[33:08] who could attend, we've got some special
[33:10] prizes to go along with their
[33:11] certificates, like the attendance
[33:13] ribbons. So, enjoy. Thank you,
[33:16] ladies. All right, our next award is the
[33:20] diligence award. And for the diligence
[33:23] award is awarded to one student in each
[33:27] grade that has demonstrated outstanding
[33:31] hard work and perseverance. Now, I love
[33:34] this award
[33:37] because I was never the top of my class,
[33:40] but I worked so hard. And sometimes at
[33:44] school, because it's an academic place
[33:46] to be, uh, you get a lot of awards for
[33:49] grades and different things, but
[33:51] sometimes we leave some of those, you
[33:53] know, other ones out. So, this award is
[33:55] not dependent on academics. It's just
[33:57] hard work and the effort that they put
[34:01] in. Um, and for these awards, because
[34:04] we're here, we have all of our teachers
[34:07] here. We're going to give them a chance
[34:08] to come up and tell just a little bit
[34:11] about the student that they're giving it
[34:13] to in each grade, and they will be
[34:16] presenting that student with the award.
[34:18] Now, again, if the student's not here,
[34:20] you'll see their uh picture on the
[34:22] projector. Um, if you if you do hear
[34:25] your name and you are here, please come
[34:26] up and get your uh your medal and your
[34:29] trophy and see what your teacher has to
[34:32] say about you. All right, so I'm going
[34:34] to go ahead and hand this over to Miss
[34:35] McNelte. Uh, Miss McNelte teaches fifth
[34:38] grade, so we're going to start with
[34:39] fifth and then we're going to go right
[34:41] up through the seniors. Miss
[34:44] McNelte, hello. The diligence award for
[34:47] fifth grade was not just based off of
[34:49] grades, but also your effort, your
[34:52] availability of coming to office hour if
[34:54] you had questions, your open
[34:56] communication if you couldn't make it to
[34:58] office hour and scheduled ones. So this
[35:00] year, our diligence award for fifth
[35:02] grade goes to Elelliana
[35:08] [Music]
[35:10] Slacka.
[35:19] Congratulations. You can put that on the
[35:24] picture. For sixth grade, I also used
[35:26] the same metric. I didn't just go based
[35:28] off of grades, even though they
[35:29] typically have good grades. For sixth
[35:31] grade, I also went based off of
[35:33] communication of if you came to office
[35:36] hour, also class participation, if you
[35:38] were, you know, talking, if you were
[35:39] showing your effort, asking questions.
[35:41] This year goes to Bethany
[35:47] [Music]
[35:51] Martin. I'm back for seventh grade. I
[35:54] teach all the seventh graders. Um, this
[35:56] year
[35:58] I I had a a relatively small seventh
[36:02] grade class, but there was definitely
[36:04] one student who Shawn in the diligence
[36:06] area. Um, always had her work turned in,
[36:10] always on time. She was always in class,
[36:13] super eager to be there, participated
[36:15] actively, and I really appreciated what
[36:18] she brought to our live class. And in
[36:20] seventh grade, that is Miss Elena Ber.
[36:24] [Applause]
[36:32] Hi. So, I will be presenting the eighth
[36:34] grade award for diligence. Uh, this
[36:37] student, I had her for eighth grade
[36:39] social studies. And just talking with
[36:41] all the teachers, she's amazing all the
[36:44] way around. And that student is No
[36:46] Martin.
[36:47] [Applause]
[36:54] surprise. I'm also here for ninth grade.
[36:56] Uh, ninth grade will be Cara Yesi. Her
[36:59] teachers love her and love how willing
[37:02] she is to work hard and always have a
[37:05] good positive attitude. So, thank you,
[37:11] Cara. Are we supposed to take a picture?
[37:21] Okay. As a high school teacher, um I
[37:24] teach a number of students, 9th, 10th,
[37:26] 11th, 12th. Um so this was this
[37:29] particular student was nominated by more
[37:31] than just myself. Uh this young man is
[37:35] steadfast. He's dependable. He's
[37:37] punctual to class. And I'm saying from
[37:39] my perspective, and I'm sure they all
[37:41] agree, he is reliable to turn in
[37:43] assignments promptly. And I might add
[37:47] from my perspective for the Spanish one
[37:50] class, I always look forward to his
[37:52] enthusiastic responses in his
[37:54] recordings. I could depend on his
[37:57] enthusiasm. Zachary Browning, please
[38:00] come forward.
[38:04] [Applause]
[38:24] So I teach high school um US history,
[38:28] American government and uh also world
[38:30] geography and then I also teach music
[38:33] for middle school. So I am going to
[38:35] present the 11th grade award for
[38:38] diligence and this goes to um Angel
[38:41] Collier. She is not here today but she
[38:45] uh is earning this award because she was
[38:47] very very careful in all of her work.
[38:50] She was very thorough. um she had some
[38:53] issues during the year with that she had
[38:56] to work to catch up and and she did a
[38:58] wonderful job and um I felt like she
[39:01] deserved this award and the teachers um
[39:03] agreed and so the 11th grade diligence
[39:05] award goes to Angel
[39:13] Collier. And for our 12th grade award,
[39:16] we had a young lady who was so
[39:19] perseverant throughout the year. And
[39:23] she diligence is the word that I would
[39:25] use to describe her because throughout
[39:28] the year she just was very steady, very
[39:31] careful. Um she did some traveling and
[39:34] was always very careful to check to make
[39:36] sure she had her assignments ready
[39:37] before she left. and she just worked
[39:40] very hard and very steadily and very
[39:43] diligently to um stay on top of her
[39:46] grades all year. And she is a senior and
[39:48] she's here this year and her name is
[39:50] Mary
[39:51] Arazola. Congratulations,
[40:00] Mary. Thank you.
[40:17] Now, if you won those medals, you should
[40:19] put them on and display them proudly.
[40:22] Absolutely. Our next award is for
[40:24] academic excellence. And again, we're
[40:26] gonna have the teachers come up and just
[40:28] say a short something about the student.
[40:30] where the last award that we gave was
[40:32] for hard work and determination. The
[40:35] academic excellence award is for the
[40:38] student who scored the highest GPA in
[40:40] the class all year. So there was no
[40:42] deliberating or thinking about it. It
[40:44] was just the one with the highest
[40:45] grades, the highest grade point average.
[40:47] And again, I'm going to um ask that if
[40:51] the student is here, we have two of
[40:53] them. Go ahead and come up, get your
[40:55] award and picture taken. and um if not
[40:58] we'll put their pictures on the screen
[41:01] and we'll start with fifth grade again
[41:02] with Miss
[41:06] McNelte. This also didn't take much
[41:08] thinking for this one. I did have a
[41:11] little bit of debating. Our award this
[41:13] year was not for someone who was with us
[41:14] the entire school year, but based off
[41:16] all of their opportunity to have the
[41:18] highest grade, Nathan had the highest
[41:20] grade in fifth grade. So
[41:22] congratulations, Nathan.
[41:29] And for sixth grade, I think this is a
[41:31] great example of where your diligence
[41:33] does pay off. When you work really hard,
[41:36] even if it takes that extra time, that
[41:38] extra office hour, you do see the
[41:40] improvement in your grades. So, our
[41:42] sixth grade academic excellence award
[41:44] goes to Miss Bethany
[41:51] Martin back for seventh grade. And like
[41:54] Miss McNelte says, that diligence does
[41:56] pay off because our seventh grade
[41:58] academic excellence winner is Miss Elena
[42:00] Ber. So congratulations to
[42:07] Elena. I also teach eth grade English.
[42:12] And after averaging out all of the
[42:14] grades for the eighth graders, it turns
[42:16] out that the academic excellence winner
[42:18] for eighth grade is Mr. Samuel Laroo.
[42:21] Congratulations to Samuel.
[42:24] [Applause]
[42:29] I'm here for ninth grade world history.
[42:31] Uh, this student was always really well
[42:35] written, I guess you could say. I know
[42:36] that sounds kind of weird to say, but
[42:38] she had the most thoughtful written
[42:39] responses, always able to engage in
[42:42] discussion, which is something that's
[42:43] very helpful in history or teaching
[42:45] online in general. I always tell people
[42:47] it's really hard to talk to a computer
[42:49] screen for an hour straight when the
[42:51] kids just stare at you. So, the student
[42:54] for this is Sabrina
[42:57] [Applause]
[43:03] Lakawani. I represent the students for
[43:06] 10th grade. It is my honor
[43:08] um to um say that I have taught this
[43:12] student this year. Uh I've followed him
[43:15] through the years. I've noticed I was
[43:16] like, "Oh, I can't wait for him to be my
[43:18] student." He is certainly worthy of this
[43:20] award. Um, he exceeds the teacher's
[43:24] expectations with his assignments. He
[43:26] answers questions thoroughly and
[43:28] thoughtfully. He goes beyond and beyond
[43:30] the call of duty. And, um, I might add
[43:34] to that he is,
[43:38] um, well, I'm going to hold that
[43:40] thought. Elijah Lomas
[43:44] [Applause]
[43:51] Okay, I apologize. I am running on fumes
[43:55] here, so bear with me. Okay, those who
[43:58] know the next young man is very worthy
[44:01] of this award as well. This is the 11th
[44:03] grade student. He comes from a fine
[44:05] family. Um, I can speak from personal
[44:09] experience that whenever we would turn
[44:10] on the Zoom, when I would turn on the
[44:12] Zoom, he was waiting in the wings. He
[44:13] was the first one there. Or maybe Isaac
[44:15] and Joy. They they tied. Um he's
[44:19] attentive in class.
[44:22] Um listen carefully, ask questions. U
[44:26] turned in work faithfully. Um again, he
[44:29] is worthy of the academic excellence
[44:31] award. And that is Josiah Ber.
[44:34] [Applause]
[44:35] [Music]
[44:42] See, he's even helping out here,
[44:52] too. Congratulations, Josiah.
[45:11] So, I'm representing 12th grade and I
[45:13] did have an extra class that was not
[45:15] history added onto
[45:17] my class load this year and I really
[45:21] really enjoyed it. It was college level
[45:23] writing and um so this I had this
[45:26] student in that class this year and um I
[45:29] think she is very much deserving of this
[45:32] excellence award. Um, I think this one
[45:35] could have been pretty close as well
[45:38] between a couple of students. Um, but I
[45:40] would like to present the academic
[45:42] excellence award for 12th grade to
[45:44] Esther
[45:46] [Applause]
[45:48] [Music]
[45:50] [Applause]
[45:55] Milan. I'm sorry, Abigail.
[46:07] Congratulations to all of the academic
[46:09] award
[46:10] winners. Next, we have our subject
[46:13] awards. And our subject awards are given
[46:16] to students that show unusual ability or
[46:19] performance in a particular subject. We
[46:21] don't give it in every subject every
[46:23] year. um they're awarded for exceptional
[46:26] students in a particular discipline and
[46:28] only again like I said when applicable.
[46:31] Uh these are going to be presented by
[46:33] the teachers and I would like to get an
[46:36] individual photo with the with the
[46:38] teacher as you give the awards. So we're
[46:40] going to start off with an English award
[46:43] and that is being given by Mrs. Coffee.
[46:50] So these are very special awards. Um as
[46:53] Miss Leonard said, we don't give these
[46:55] out in every subject and we don't give
[46:56] them out every year. Um but this year I
[46:59] felt that uh we had one student who
[47:02] excelled in writing. And I wish I could
[47:05] show you everything that all of the
[47:06] students wrote this year, especially
[47:08] their research papers. They were
[47:09] amazing. Um and their argumentation
[47:12] essays, they're very good at proving
[47:14] their point. So, um, that was that was a
[47:17] lot of fun to teach. But there was one
[47:19] student who who wrote
[47:23] consistently. I hardly had to correct
[47:25] any grammar or spelling or punctuation
[47:28] at all in any of the writing the entire
[47:31] year. And so, I really felt like that
[47:34] this student deserved um the award for
[47:37] English. And that is Miss Esther Mullen.
[48:01] Good. Next we will have the math award.
[48:05] Now this award was given by Miss Donald
[48:08] who is in South Africa and she wanted to
[48:11] be here so badly but um just it wasn't
[48:15] able to become a reality for her this
[48:17] time but we have asked Miss McNelte to
[48:19] give that award for uh Miss
[48:25] Donald. I have not had the pleasure of
[48:28] having this winner, the student in my
[48:30] class. But Miss Donald did say she is
[48:32] excellent at understanding the math
[48:34] points that she has. She's able to show
[48:36] her work really well. She doesn't just
[48:38] give the answer and expect that that's
[48:39] correct. She's able to prove her point.
[48:41] She's able to show how she got there and
[48:43] ask those deep questions when it comes
[48:44] to those math concepts. So, it is my
[48:47] pleasure to announce that our award
[48:49] winner for the
[48:50] math subject award is Sabrina Lakuwani.
[48:54] So, congratulations, Sabrina, on being
[48:55] recognized for
[49:00] math. Next, we have Mrs. Coffee coming
[49:03] back to give a social studies
[49:08] award. This award is another one that I
[49:10] wish you could see projects that we did
[49:12] this year. We had a lot of fun in
[49:13] history. I try my best to make history
[49:15] fun and interesting and not a boring,
[49:17] dry subject as it was when I was in
[49:20] school. But I love history and so I like
[49:22] to make it as hands-on as we can in an
[49:25] online classroom. So we do some projects
[49:29] throughout the year. Uh we collaborate
[49:31] with projects throughout the year, but
[49:33] some of the students like to make little
[49:34] movie clips. Um and those are always so
[49:38] much fun to watch. So we had one student
[49:40] this year who made history fun to teach.
[49:43] and any any subject that I gave, whether
[49:47] it was the American Revolution, the
[49:49] Civil War, World War I, World War II, it
[49:51] didn't matter. When we had a project, it
[49:54] was just so well done and I even would
[49:57] take it and share it with my husband
[49:58] because I really enjoyed watching the
[50:00] little movie clips and all of the
[50:02] information that this student would come
[50:03] up with about the subject. So, I would
[50:06] love to present uh the social studies
[50:08] award to Mr. Zach Browning.
[50:12] [Applause]
[50:33] congratulations,
[50:41] Zach. We have one more subject award,
[50:44] which is the Spanish award. So, I'll
[50:46] give that to Mrs. Carol.
[50:49] Gracias.
[50:52] Okay. Um, I'm a little sad. Quite a bit
[50:54] sad because my student is not here. He
[50:56] lives far far away, but hopefully in two
[50:59] years
[51:01] maybe. You're under pressure now. He's a
[51:04] sophomore. Um, I've already mentioned
[51:06] his name. He's he's wonderful. He's um,
[51:10] again, his um, assignments were lovely.
[51:14] I enjoyed reading everything he had to
[51:15] say. And unlike some other students who
[51:18] might wanted to get by with just a
[51:20] little bit, um, he would write
[51:22] paragraphs, uh, answering questions and
[51:25] many times would try his best to write
[51:26] everything in Spanish. And I especially
[51:29] enjoyed his videos. Now, they were not
[51:32] required to have videos, but uh, what
[51:35] they had two recordings a week, okay?
[51:37] One recording was to read um, from the
[51:40] Bible. I had a passage of scripture for
[51:42] the first semester, Psalms 23. Um there
[51:45] were some lovely lovely uh speaking
[51:48] voices. I I've already mentioned
[51:49] Zachary. I just loved his enthusiasm.
[51:52] Jesus, you know, just so positive, so
[51:55] buoyant. Um but this young man was
[51:58] equally exuberant to the point that he
[52:01] created charades, videos of himself. Uh
[52:04] not so much with the scripture, but with
[52:06] some but with words, pronouncing words.
[52:09] Um he just would role play whatever it
[52:12] was. sometimes get out his guitar, just
[52:14] act it out. So, those were entertaining,
[52:16] but yet I also know that took a lot of
[52:18] time and creativity on his part. He
[52:20] wasn't just brushing the assignment off.
[52:22] Uh, so I really appreciated that
[52:24] enthusiasm uh on his part and just the
[52:28] strive for excellence. Um, so I think
[52:31] you may now know I'm talking about
[52:33] Elijah again. So, Elijah,
[52:35] congratulations. We wish you were here.
[52:37] God willing time should two years.
[52:40] [Applause]
[52:46] I've already had students asking me,
[52:47] "Miss Leonard, when are we going to do
[52:49] this again?" I had one family that said,
[52:50] "We can't make it this year. We'll come
[52:52] next year." And I said, "You may be
[52:55] alone." Our next award or our next
[52:59] awards are academic awards, honor, role,
[53:02] and accommodation list. Um, now for this
[53:05] I'm going to hand it over to brother
[53:06] Michael and he is going to tell you a
[53:09] little bit about the the award and read
[53:11] the names and I will be um giving the
[53:14] students their um their certificates and
[53:18] we will get a group photo with them.
[53:20] Okay,
[53:25] Michael.
[53:26] He's here.
[53:30] All
[53:31] right. The honor roll list. As a school,
[53:36] academics are of course very important.
[53:38] The teachers would concur. And the next
[53:41] awards are given to students who have
[53:42] earned them based on grades alone using
[53:45] a grade point average. The honor role is
[53:47] earned by students who are full-time at
[53:49] BAO and a grade point average of above
[53:51] 3.75 and above. So these students
[53:54] represent a small and elite percent of
[53:57] our student body. They are the highest
[53:58] academic achievers and the winner should
[54:01] come forward to get their award and get
[54:03] a photo. So if the student is not here,
[54:05] please
[54:07] uh you will have their picture on the
[54:09] screen. But if you are here, please come
[54:10] on up and Miss Leonard is going to
[54:11] present your award. So we have Mary
[54:15] Aquasola. You are Aquasola. Josiah
[54:19] Boore, Elena
[54:23] Ber, Harlon
[54:25] Harris, Luke
[54:27] Helms, Sabrina Lacuani, Elijah Lass,
[54:32] Esther
[54:33] Malan, Bethany Martin, Sarah
[54:37] Morton, Ethan Peele, Gracie Vest. That
[54:41] is our well, as they wrote here, the
[54:44] small and elite percent of high
[54:46] achievers. Congratulations.
[54:48] [Applause]
[56:11] [Applause]
[56:19] All right, we're going to go with the
[56:21] commenation list. And if you can, would
[56:23] you please come up from this stairs and
[56:25] come this way? and in order that your
[56:28] name has been called. We have actually
[56:30] quite a uh a lengthy list here which is
[56:33] extremely uh wonderful because that
[56:36] means we have a lot of high achievers
[56:37] and uh diligent students here in the
[56:39] school. So the commenation list is
[56:41] earned by students who are full-time at
[56:43] BAO and with a GPA of 3.0 to 3.75 or
[56:47] students taking less than four courses
[56:49] and have a GPA of above 3.0. So these
[56:53] students are also very high achievers
[56:55] and deserve recognition. And like I
[56:57] said, I got a lengthy list here. So
[56:59] that's uh I'm so proud of you. So I'm
[57:01] going to I'm going to read your name.
[57:02] Please come up from this side and in the
[57:05] order I call you. Elias

[57:52] It's National Hamburger
[57:55] Month, just in case you're
[57:57] wondering. Elelliana Slacka and
[58:00] Christian
[58:01] Slacka, congratulations. Come on
[58:04] up and we'll get a nice group picture.
[58:27] Yes, it is the whole school. Isabelle
[58:30] Slacka, Justice Slacka, Isaac Walbert,
[58:33] Joy Walbert, Brianna Wanie, Abigail
[58:36] Wilson, and Miles Weathers.
[58:38] Congratulations.
[58:39] [Laughter]
[58:44] Thank you.
[58:45] You need like a little arrow.
[59:00] Oh, congratulations. Thank you. Picture
[59:45] I'm sure you'll forgive us for all the
[59:47] photos, but we have to document this
[59:48] occasion, okay? So, bear with
[59:51] us. Alrighty. Can I Do you like the
[59:55] power of that clicker?
[59:58] Okay, we have some special recognitions
[1:00:01] that I'd like to give out today.
[1:00:03] Um, and uh, I'm going to just say his
[1:00:07] name first because I want to he's a long
[1:00:08] way away. Josiah, start moving this
[1:00:10] direction. Um, I I want to call Josiah
[1:00:14] up since we're here all together. And I
[1:00:17] want to take the opportunity to just
[1:00:18] acknowledge Josiah and his faithfulness
[1:00:20] and his willingness to use his God-given
[1:00:22] gifts. Uh Josiah has been our devotional
[1:00:26] musician for the past few years and um
[1:00:30] he comes to every devotions and he plays
[1:00:32] the piano, he leads songs, he puts the
[1:00:35] words up on the computer and I know that
[1:00:37] doesn't just happen. I know it takes
[1:00:39] effort and it takes commitment and he's
[1:00:42] so consistent. It's all the time and
[1:00:46] um it's I think those qualities of you
[1:00:50] come on over. I won't bite either. Uh I
[1:00:52] think those qualities of commitment and
[1:00:55] um just giving effort it's it's it's
[1:00:58] rare today. And so I just wanted to
[1:01:00] acknowledge uh what Josiah has done and
[1:01:03] and say Josiah that we appreciate you so
[1:01:05] much. And I don't think the students
[1:01:07] know how much they should appreciate
[1:01:09] Josiah because if he wasn't there, they
[1:01:11] would probably have to listen to me
[1:01:12] sing. And so uh I I think we should all
[1:01:16] give Josiah a round of applause and and
[1:01:18] just say thank you for all you've done,
[1:01:20] Josiah. Just hold that thought for a
[1:01:23] [Applause]
[1:01:28] moment. We've gotten him a special gift
[1:01:31] to say thank you. And um if you get a
[1:01:34] chance, ask him to see what it is later
[1:01:35] because I think you'll like it. God
[1:01:37] bless you, Josiah.
[1:01:40] Um we have a couple of other special
[1:01:42] people here today. And so I feel like in
[1:01:45] an event like this, it would be I'd be
[1:01:47] very amused not to take an opportunity
[1:01:49] to highlight some of the amazing people
[1:01:52] here that make BAO possible. Um, Brother
[1:01:57] Michael does a lot of work. I do a lot
[1:01:59] of work. There's many people who do a
[1:02:02] lot of work. But we couldn't have
[1:02:04] classes every day if it wasn't for the
[1:02:06] people behind me. Mrs. Carol, Mrs.
[1:02:10] Coffee, Mr. Coffee, Mr. Crook, Miss
[1:02:14] Donald, Miss Garvin, myself, Miss
[1:02:19] McNelte, Mrs. Seabor, Mrs. Tushner, and
[1:02:23] Mrs. Willis were our teachers this year.
[1:02:26] In addition to our teachers of the of
[1:02:28] the past, previous teachers like Mrs.
[1:02:31] Arowwood, Mr.
[1:02:33] Kaufman, Mr.
[1:02:35] Girtson, Mrs. Potter, and Mrs. Raber.
[1:02:38] and they have all dedicated themselves
[1:02:40] to helping you educate your children in
[1:02:44] an atmosphere where they
[1:02:46] can grow in Christ while they receive
[1:02:49] their education at home. And although I
[1:02:53] don't have any myself, um I I think that
[1:02:57] the opportunity that we're able to
[1:02:59] provide is it's amazing and I'm so
[1:03:02] pleased that we can do that. Um, these
[1:03:05] teachers are passionate, committed,
[1:03:07] qualified, a million other things that I
[1:03:10] could say, but I just want to say that
[1:03:11] I'm proud to work with all of them and
[1:03:14] to work together at Bible Way Academy
[1:03:17] Online.
[1:03:19] Now, at the end of the school year, we
[1:03:22] had several students that wrote little
[1:03:25] thank you notes or wrote essays. And so,
[1:03:28] it's not just me that appreciates these
[1:03:30] people. I want to read you just some
[1:03:32] snippets of some of the student writing
[1:03:35] what they've said about their classes
[1:03:36] and their
[1:03:38] teachers. This student said, "I want to
[1:03:41] sincerely thank you for the effort that
[1:03:43] you've put into all of us. I've grown up
[1:03:46] so much in this class. I've learned so
[1:03:48] much about art and my horizons have
[1:03:50] broadened. You've been a blessing to me
[1:03:53] through the whole year and your smile
[1:03:55] and joyful face has always inspired me
[1:03:57] and made my day every time I see it.
[1:04:00] Even though you went through loss this
[1:04:02] year yourself, you held your smile,
[1:04:04] which was a testament of of unwavering
[1:04:07] courage and faith. I thank God that he
[1:04:09] led. I told the graduates I would cry.
[1:04:13] This seems to be my moment. I'll try to
[1:04:14] pull it
[1:04:15] together. I thank God that he brought
[1:04:18] you into my life. For the short time
[1:04:20] that I have known you, you have blessed
[1:04:21] me abundantly. And there are no words
[1:04:23] that I can fully express my gratitude.
[1:04:26] But I know I speak for the whole class
[1:04:27] when I say, "You are an unwavering
[1:04:29] blessing." And that was to one of our
[1:04:32] teachers from an eighth
[1:04:33] grader. And just reading those words is
[1:04:36] such a blessing for us. But I love
[1:04:39] reading them when the teacher shared
[1:04:41] them with me because it's a testament of
[1:04:43] the effect that the school is having on
[1:04:46] these kids'
[1:04:47] lives. This student said, "In my
[1:04:50] previous school, God was rarely
[1:04:53] incorporated into my work. or if he was,
[1:04:55] it was a tradition or some different
[1:04:58] Bible version. It's so nice to have
[1:05:00] teachers who are filled with the Holy
[1:05:02] Ghost and love God. They want to include
[1:05:04] him in our
[1:05:05] assignments. I did not know God was
[1:05:07] mentioned so many times in the Bible,
[1:05:09] and Mrs. Coffey's scriptures that she
[1:05:11] included in class have inspired me to
[1:05:13] write and journal about God more than I
[1:05:16] ever have.
[1:05:18] this essay begins, I want to cry right
[1:05:22] now, but that's probably not an
[1:05:23] effective opening for an
[1:05:25] essay. It's it is a kind of sentence you
[1:05:29] would use when you find yourself
[1:05:31] standing at the end of a journey that's
[1:05:32] changed your life forever and
[1:05:35] perhaps marked the best five years of
[1:05:38] your life. And that was from one of our
[1:05:41] graduates. This student says, "I wanted
[1:05:44] to thank you for being such a great
[1:05:46] English teacher. Your classes challenged
[1:05:48] me in the best way and helped me grow
[1:05:51] not only in writing and reading, but in
[1:05:54] confidence. I appreciate how you take
[1:05:57] time to explain things clearly and you
[1:06:00] encourage me to push beyond my
[1:06:02] boundaries. I am definitely going to
[1:06:04] miss your
[1:06:07] class. One specific thing I enjoyed
[1:06:09] about Bible way was that it wasn't a
[1:06:12] random program, but a believer-based
[1:06:14] homeschool.
[1:06:16] You don't have to worry about outside
[1:06:17] influences or biased teachers. It makes
[1:06:21] you feel comfortable and safe in your
[1:06:23] environment. Having students that walk
[1:06:25] beside you on the same path you are,
[1:06:28] going through the same things you're
[1:06:30] going through. A comforting thought to
[1:06:33] have godly teachers to look up to for
[1:06:35] encouragement and know that you're not
[1:06:37] alone.
[1:06:40] This being my senior year and fifth year
[1:06:42] at Bible Way Academy, it's hard not to
[1:06:44] look back and realize how far I've
[1:06:47] come. When I started at BAO, I was just
[1:06:50] a middle schooler trying to figure
[1:06:52] things out. And now, as I prepare to
[1:06:54] close this chapter of my life into what
[1:06:56] God wants next, I see through every
[1:06:58] lesson, assignment, and live class that
[1:07:01] this school has helped shape me in ways
[1:07:02] I didn't expect. It's taught me more
[1:07:05] than academics. It's helped me shape my
[1:07:07] character, my faith, and my
[1:07:11] voice. I just have two
[1:07:16] more.
[1:07:18] Sorry. There comes a point when you have
[1:07:22] to. Looking back on this school year, I
[1:07:26] find it filled with memorable moments,
[1:07:28] creative insights, and important lessons
[1:07:30] in and out of the classroom. Through it
[1:07:33] all, I learned to be more confident in
[1:07:34] myself.
[1:07:36] Most importantly, this school year has
[1:07:38] taught me to apply prayer to all the
[1:07:39] work that I do and has influenced me to
[1:07:42] apply Christ into my life outside of
[1:07:44] school as
[1:07:47] well. And
[1:07:49] lastly, thank you for being such a
[1:07:51] patient and dedicated math teacher. Your
[1:07:54] explanations and constant encouragement
[1:07:55] have made a big difference in how I
[1:07:57] approach math, a subject that for me is
[1:08:00] very overwhelming. You helped me build
[1:08:02] confidence by showing me that it's not
[1:08:04] that hard and you were the first teacher
[1:08:06] to explain things patiently when I
[1:08:09] didn't understand. When Tuesdays came
[1:08:11] around, I was excited for math class.
[1:08:15] And that's what these people do every
[1:08:18] day. And I am very proud to work with
[1:08:21] them. Um, all of them. But in
[1:08:24] particular, I want to take a moment to
[1:08:27] acknowledge some teachers that have been
[1:08:29] with us since the very beginning. And as
[1:08:33] those of you who've been here since the
[1:08:34] beginning know, it was a bit rocky the
[1:08:37] first year. We had some growing to do,
[1:08:40] but they stuck with it. And we could
[1:08:44] never give them all that they deserve.
[1:08:47] But I have a little token of our
[1:08:49] appreciation by way of a gift and a
[1:08:52] commemorative five-year anniversary pin
[1:08:54] that we'd like to present them with. Um,
[1:08:57] one of our five-year teachers is Miss
[1:08:59] Donald who couldn't be here. So, to Miss
[1:09:01] Donald, when you watch the recording, we
[1:09:03] love you. We thank you for your
[1:09:04] dedication and your service, and we
[1:09:07] appreciate
[1:09:08] you. I'm going to ask Mrs. Carol to come
[1:09:10] up and stand beside me while I talk
[1:09:14] about her.
[1:09:15] [Laughter]
[1:09:17] Mrs. Carol has been at BIO for five
[1:09:20] years. She's been an English teacher, a
[1:09:22] Spanish teacher, and she's been my
[1:09:25] editor
[1:09:27] extraordinaire. She gets excited about
[1:09:29] every student and every subject she
[1:09:32] teaches. If I had one word to describe
[1:09:34] Mrs. Carol, it would be passionate. You
[1:09:37] saw that on the volleyball court
[1:09:39] yesterday. Mrs. Carol reminds me, I
[1:09:42] don't know if you've seen it, but
[1:09:43] there's a meme that has kind of a crazy
[1:09:46] stick figure going all the things. Mrs.
[1:09:49] Carol is the epitome of that meme. She
[1:09:52] wants to teach all the things. She wants
[1:09:55] to make all the things. She wants to
[1:09:57] serve all the things. Um the the
[1:10:00] challenge with her is is getting her
[1:10:02] just reigned back a little bit because
[1:10:04] she's so enthusiastic, which I love. And
[1:10:07] so, Mrs. Carol, I want to say thank you
[1:10:10] for your ideas, your passion, and for
[1:10:13] the love that you put into everything
[1:10:14] you do. And we have a student that's
[1:10:17] going to come and present you with a
[1:10:18] gift. And we'd like to get a a picture
[1:10:21] of you there in the middle of the stage
[1:10:22] if you want to step over.
[1:10:26] [Applause]
[1:10:36] I don't know where our our picture
[1:10:38] people are, but did we did we get
[1:10:42] one? Brother Joe, do you mind to take
[1:10:44] this one real quick so we
[1:10:46] can Mrs. Coffee? I'm going to call you
[1:10:49] up
[1:10:50] next. Uh, Mrs. Coffee has taught at BAO
[1:10:54] for 5 years, but she also brings an
[1:10:57] experience and a wisdom that's far
[1:10:59] beyond just teaching. Since Mr. Andrew
[1:11:03] Coffee, who's also a teacher, was in
[1:11:05] kindergarten, Mrs. Coffee has been
[1:11:07] teaching. Um, what you may not know or
[1:11:10] you may have gotten a hint of from
[1:11:12] Brother Michael is that uh much of what
[1:11:15] BAO is today was hatched in her living
[1:11:17] room. We sat around for a weekend and we
[1:11:20] brainstormed, tossed around ideas and
[1:11:23] went back and forth until we finally had
[1:11:25] a plan. Um, it's something that Mrs.
[1:11:28] Coffee had dreamed of for years and like
[1:11:30] brother Michael said, the timing kind of
[1:11:32] happened right and and everything came
[1:11:34] together. Mrs. Coffee brings enthusiasm
[1:11:37] to her social studies and English
[1:11:39] classrooms and I've noticed that Mrs.
[1:11:42] Coffee just has such a strong desire for
[1:11:44] all of her students to succeed. uh I
[1:11:47] appreciate what she brings to the school
[1:11:50] as part of the administrative team and
[1:11:52] the wisdom that she brings there. And
[1:11:55] so, Mrs. Coffee, I want to thank you for
[1:11:56] your input, your support, and your
[1:11:59] dedication to everything you do. God
[1:12:01] bless you.
[1:12:02] [Applause]
[1:12:12] quickly. Next, I'm going to ask Miss
[1:12:14] McNelte to come
[1:12:21] up. Miss McNelte came to us five years
[1:12:25] ago as a new college graduate. She came
[1:12:28] with energy and a heart for her students
[1:12:30] that was unrivaled. Uh she's also one of
[1:12:33] the best brainstorming partners that I
[1:12:35] could ever wish for. I appreciate that.
[1:12:38] Um her helpful nature has extended to
[1:12:41] the classroom where uh she's taught just
[1:12:44] one student in a class to help them get
[1:12:46] ahead. Um right now she's teaching more
[1:12:49] classes than any of the other teachers.
[1:12:51] She teaches the most. She's the closest
[1:12:53] to a full-time teacher that we have. Uh
[1:12:55] she's teaching fifth grade, sixth grade,
[1:12:57] speech, intro to business, and a couple
[1:13:00] of others. We appreciate Miss McNeltey's
[1:13:03] drive and the care that she puts into
[1:13:06] every one of her students. Thank you,
[1:13:07] Miss McNelte. God bless
[1:13:10] [Applause]
[1:13:24] you. Next, we have Mrs.
[1:13:27] Willis. Come on up, Mrs. Willis. Mrs.
[1:13:30] Mrs. Willis has also been with us for 5
[1:13:32] years and has been an absolute joy to
[1:13:34] work with. Uh she first came on board as
[1:13:38] a teacher who had left education when
[1:13:40] she had her little ones, but she told me
[1:13:42] that she would often dream of teaching
[1:13:45] at night because she missed it. And so
[1:13:48] when I called her and she told me that,
[1:13:49] I was like, "That's the one we want. We
[1:13:51] want that one."
[1:13:53] um BAOO. I mean, it's a perfect
[1:13:56] situation to allow her to to teach a
[1:13:59] couple classes and then also stay at
[1:14:01] home and be a mommy. And Mrs. Willis
[1:14:04] does a wonderful job. In the dictionary
[1:14:06] beside flexible, there is a picture of
[1:14:09] this woman. Uh she's the one that I call
[1:14:12] in case of an emergency when I need to
[1:14:14] fill in. And she never questions. Her
[1:14:17] answer is always sure. Whatever you
[1:14:20] need, she's there. She's willingness
[1:14:22] itself. Mrs. Willis teaches world
[1:14:25] history, economics. Sadly, next year she
[1:14:29] will only be teaching preschool at home
[1:14:32] um because she's taking a year off to
[1:14:33] welcome another member of her family.
[1:14:35] But we wish her all the best and we look
[1:14:37] forward to having you back in the
[1:14:39] classroom as soon as possible. All
[1:14:42] right, go
[1:14:45] ahead. Thank you, Kayla. God bless
[1:14:48] you.
[1:14:54] Has Brother Barry gotten back? He's
[1:14:57] back. Okay. Um, I need to recognize two
[1:15:01] other members of our admin team. They've
[1:15:03] been along for this five-year adventure
[1:15:05] and they also deserve recognition and I
[1:15:08] want to ask Brother Barry Coffee to come
[1:15:10] up. Brother Barry has been a supporter
[1:15:13] of the school again since the days in
[1:15:16] his living room. Um, I don't know, but I
[1:15:19] think supporter of my wife's endeavors
[1:15:22] may have had some influence on that, but
[1:15:24] he's doing an excellent job. Come on up,
[1:15:26] brother Barry. Um, we're very thankful
[1:15:29] for his assistance on the admin team.
[1:15:32] He's filled many roles for us over the
[1:15:35] years from counselor uh to leading
[1:15:38] devotions to taking the lead in
[1:15:40] assemblies and his input has been
[1:15:43] invaluable when dealing with difficult
[1:15:44] situations and different students that
[1:15:47] have gone through different things over
[1:15:48] the years and we appreciate him his care
[1:15:52] and support for everybody at
[1:15:54] BAO. I personally appreciate his
[1:15:57] support. Um, you might not know, Brother
[1:16:00] Barry was my pastor when I was a young
[1:16:02] person. So, it's been and survived and
[1:16:07] it's been very special to work with him
[1:16:09] as an adult um in this role. So, Brother
[1:16:13] Barry, I just want to say thank you for
[1:16:14] everything you've done for us. And um we
[1:16:17] also have a gift for you. If you'll come
[1:16:20] come on up, let's give Brother Barry a
[1:16:22] hand. Thank you so much. God bless you.
[1:16:37] And um I'm sorry to do this, but I'm
[1:16:40] going to have to call up brother Michael
[1:16:42] and let's have our last you gohead on
[1:16:44] and come
[1:16:46] up. I want to recognize brother
[1:16:48] Michael's efforts and dedication.
[1:16:51] Brother Michael does the things you
[1:16:52] don't notice. He fills out the tax
[1:16:54] forms. He works with the accountants.
[1:16:57] Um, I think the thing we probably notice
[1:16:59] the most is he signs our paychecks,
[1:17:01] which we appreciate. Uh, he's the he's
[1:17:04] not just the tech guy, but he's like the
[1:17:06] tech guy's tech guy, and that's also
[1:17:08] important with an online school. Um, he
[1:17:11] does the budget and somehow manages to
[1:17:13] fit all of that in amongst all of his
[1:17:15] other full-time jobs and growing
[1:17:17] ministry. I worked with Brother Michael
[1:17:20] when I was at BCA in Canada and he was
[1:17:22] the board president. I've taught his
[1:17:24] children and I was given the job of
[1:17:27] helping run BAOO when I moved back to
[1:17:29] West Virginia. But I appreciate Brother
[1:17:31] Michael. I appreciate his balanced
[1:17:34] perspective, his openness. I feel like
[1:17:37] we discussed things pretty openly and uh
[1:17:40] honestly. And uh I'm very thankful for
[1:17:43] the trust that he's had in me over the
[1:17:46] years to um give me freedom to learn
[1:17:50] things and giving me space to learn
[1:17:52] things. Um, I've grown a lot over the
[1:17:55] last five years. Some things are harder
[1:17:57] than others. Um, sometimes I find people
[1:17:59] who are really good at doing things
[1:18:01] aren't necessarily good at teaching
[1:18:03] them. Um, so, you know, Brother Michael
[1:18:05] will give me a 20-minute overview of how
[1:18:07] to build a website and then be like,
[1:18:08] "Now you go ahead and finish it up." And
[1:18:11] so,
[1:18:13] um, yeah, so I've learned a lot and I I
[1:18:15] do appreciate that. Um, I appreciate his
[1:18:18] encouragement and support and I just
[1:18:20] think brother Michael has a heart for
[1:18:22] the youth and for the school and we
[1:18:24] appreciate all your hard work, your
[1:18:25] dedication and everything you've done
[1:18:27] for BAO. So, thank you so much. God
[1:18:29] bless
[1:18:29] [Applause]
[1:18:40] you. All right. Now, we recognize some
[1:18:44] five-year teachers. I just want a couple
[1:18:46] students to come to the stage. Josiah,
[1:18:49] start running. You'll get here at the
[1:18:52] same time as everyone else. Um, Esther
[1:18:54] Malan, who informed me yesterday I have
[1:18:57] been pronouncing her name wrong for the
[1:18:59] last four or five years. I've got it
[1:19:02] now. Uh, Bethany Sanger and Abigail
[1:19:06] Wilson. Come on up to the stage
[1:19:10] quickly. Can you give them the pins?
[1:19:13] Yeah.
[1:19:16] I kind of gave away but can you guess
[1:19:19] why these five are up here or four
[1:19:21] rather these
[1:19:23] four they have been with
[1:19:26] BAO from the very beginning. These are
[1:19:29] the four students that are here this
[1:19:30] weekend that have been there all five
[1:19:34] years
[1:19:36] and they they stuck with
[1:19:40] us. We've gotten to know them. We're
[1:19:43] super proud of them. I told you I gave
[1:19:45] our teachers a five-year commemorative
[1:19:46] pen and I thought, you know what, these
[1:19:48] guys deserve one, too. They've been with
[1:19:50] us through thick and thin and for five
[1:19:52] years and so I wanted to uh recognize
[1:19:55] them and the journey that they've had
[1:19:57] with Bible way academy online. We love
[1:19:59] you guys. Thank
[1:20:07] you. Now, I would be I would be remiss
[1:20:11] as well. We have some families that have
[1:20:13] been with us for five years, but it's
[1:20:15] just spanned various students. So, those
[1:20:19] families are the Yes family and the
[1:20:22] Garvin family. We've graduated some of
[1:20:24] their kids and now we're teaching new
[1:20:26] ones, but they've been with us since the
[1:20:28] beginning. So, Garins and Yesies, thank
[1:20:30] you so
[1:20:31] [Applause]
[1:20:36] much. Now, I have I have a couple of fun
[1:20:40] trophies for the weekend.
[1:20:43] The first trophy that I have here for
[1:20:45] this weekend was the first family to
[1:20:48] come yesterday afternoon. We're supposed
[1:20:50] to arrive at 2. I think this family got
[1:20:52] here at 1:00. They were here for a while
[1:20:54] before I even knew they were down in the
[1:20:55] pavilion waiting on me. And that's the
[1:20:57] Lions family. So Jeremiah, do you want
[1:21:00] to come up and get the prize of your
[1:21:01] family?
[1:21:09] We appreciate the Lions
[1:21:12] family. Don't run, Jeremiah. You may
[1:21:15] have a broken
[1:21:17] leg. There you go, buddy. Thanks so
[1:21:20] much. God bless
[1:21:23] you. Next award we have for this weekend
[1:21:26] is the family that traveled the
[1:21:30] furthest. And that goes to the Min
[1:21:32] family. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. goes to
[1:21:35] the Milan family from New Zealand.
[1:21:37] Esther, come and receive that for your
[1:21:41] family. I really am
[1:21:43] trying. I told her I called her Min for
[1:21:46] five years. It's going to take me a
[1:21:47] couple little a couple tries to get it
[1:21:49] right. Thank you for traveling the
[1:21:51] furthest, Esther. God bless you.
[1:21:56] Yeah, I think so. Uh, the next award
[1:22:00] goes to the most enthusiastic family.
[1:22:06] Oh, trade it with Esther. I'm so sorry.
[1:22:07] Here, Jeremiah. That Sorry, sorry,
[1:22:09] sorry. Yeah, give that one to Esther.
[1:22:11] Um, this is the most enthusiastic
[1:22:13] family. This is the family that the day
[1:22:16] I announced we were going to have a live
[1:22:18] get together. I I got a a message phone
[1:22:23] call from them and they were like, "What
[1:22:25] can we do to help?" And that's the Yes
[1:22:28] family. And I want Brother Aaron to come
[1:22:29] up and get this award.
[1:22:32] We love the
[1:22:33] [Applause]
[1:22:41] Yis. You may not know it, but Brother
[1:22:43] Aaron and I were young people at the
[1:22:44] same time. We went to church together
[1:22:46] there in Logan. And
[1:22:49] uh it's amazing that I'm now teaching
[1:22:51] his kids, but I love it. God bless you,
[1:22:53] Brother Aaron.
[1:23:01] Now I have one
[1:23:03] more and we were debating what this last
[1:23:06] award should be. We gave the award for
[1:23:08] the most enthusiastic family and I
[1:23:10] thought it would be fun to give out an
[1:23:12] award for the most enthusiastic teacher.
[1:23:14] She played volleyball. She played
[1:23:17] SWAT. She was in everything we did
[1:23:20] yesterday. Mrs. Carol, we love
[1:23:23] you.
[1:23:25] Here you go. It's a miracle I did not
[1:23:29] fall. Oh, but you did. Oh, I did. It's a
[1:23:34] miracle I did not get
[1:23:37] hurt. All right. We are um going to move
[1:23:43] into our last awards for the evening and
[1:23:45] that is our school awards. And these are
[1:23:48] our um I would say kind of special
[1:23:50] awards. It's a real honor to win these
[1:23:52] because it's across the entire student
[1:23:54] body. We have four of them and they're
[1:23:56] going to be presented by our teachers.
[1:23:59] And so I'm going to hand this over to
[1:24:01] Mrs. Willis. She's going to be
[1:24:02] presenting our school spirit
[1:24:06] award. There you
[1:24:09] go. All right. While we don't have a pep
[1:24:12] band or a mascot necessarily, the school
[1:24:15] spirit award is given to a student who
[1:24:17] best demonstrates a love for our school
[1:24:19] and its principles and leads others by
[1:24:21] example. This year, this award is being
[1:24:24] presented to a student whose natural
[1:24:25] exuberance and excitement for life
[1:24:27] extends to our school. Her school work,
[1:24:30] her meeting classmates at youth events
[1:24:32] and this experience it live weekend.
[1:24:34] This student leads others by cheerful
[1:24:36] example and hard work and also has a
[1:24:39] Christian testimony clearly on display.
[1:24:41] Our school spirit award winner for the
[1:24:43] 2025 school year is Cara Yki.
[1:24:48] [Applause]
[1:25:05] Congratulations to Cara on your school
[1:25:07] spirit award. I'm here today to talk
[1:25:09] about the outstanding leadership award.
[1:25:12] This is a new award at BAO this year
[1:25:14] because we had so many amazing students,
[1:25:16] it was very hard for us to decide and we
[1:25:18] had previously given a lot and it didn't
[1:25:19] seem to fit the bill for this particular
[1:25:21] student. The outstanding leadership
[1:25:23] award is given to a student who leads
[1:25:24] with enthusiasm and by example. This
[1:25:27] should be a student to encourage their
[1:25:29] classmates to excellence and fosters
[1:25:32] collaboration. We would like to present
[1:25:33] this award to Sarah Morton. Come on up,
[1:25:36] Sarah.
[1:25:39] Sarah Sarah is an outstanding leader in
[1:25:41] the classroom. She brings a contagious
[1:25:43] positivity and enthusiasm for learning,
[1:25:46] including trying to do a live skit on
[1:25:48] Zoom. Sarah is not only inclusive and
[1:25:51] friendly to everyone, but she leads with
[1:25:52] encouragement and Christ at the center.
[1:25:54] Congratulations, Sarah, for our
[1:25:56] astounding leadership award winner for
[1:25:59] [Applause]
[1:26:06] 2025 must be contagious.
[1:26:09] Sarah. Okay. I have the honor of
[1:26:13] presenting the Christian character
[1:26:15] award. This award is presented to a
[1:26:17] student who best demonstrates the
[1:26:20] characteristic of Christ. And I'm going
[1:26:21] to go off script here for just a moment.
[1:26:23] I will just say it is a joy to teach our
[1:26:26] students. We have the cream of the crop.
[1:26:28] I believe I've taught in public school.
[1:26:30] I've taught um students in our local
[1:26:33] area. Good people, but we have the cream
[1:26:36] of the
[1:26:37] crop. It's really hard to just narrow it
[1:26:39] down to one. In the past, this award has
[1:26:42] been won by several students who have
[1:26:43] seen you've seen here today, including
[1:26:45] Joey Walbert and Josiah Brewer. In a
[1:26:47] believer's school where a large
[1:26:49] percentage of our students have been
[1:26:50] born again and are believers, this
[1:26:53] winner stands out above the rest. She is
[1:26:55] a kind, thoughtful, hard-working
[1:26:57] student. She maintains an incredible
[1:27:00] testimony, and her walk with the Lord is
[1:27:02] clear by her actions, her words, and
[1:27:05] relationship with
[1:27:07] others. This student has made an impact
[1:27:10] on her school, and we're going to miss
[1:27:12] her. And again, I'm going to go off
[1:27:13] script. I know often teachers inspire
[1:27:15] students, but students can inspire
[1:27:18] teachers. And this particular student
[1:27:20] has inspired me. She's perhaps is the
[1:27:23] reason I joined the volleyball
[1:27:26] team. And the SWAT, no, just I'm so
[1:27:30] excited. I will say I was so excited in
[1:27:32] church Wednesday night and I hope it
[1:27:34] wasn't disrespectful, but when I saw
[1:27:36] that she and her parents were in the
[1:27:37] crowd, I had to go over and give them a
[1:27:40] hug. Um, I guess you know who you are.
[1:27:42] The winner this year is Esther Milan.
[1:27:44] Congratulations,
[1:27:46] [Applause]
[1:28:04] Esther.
[1:28:09] Congratulations, Esther. Our final award
[1:28:12] for the 2025 school year is the student
[1:28:15] of the year award. The student of the
[1:28:17] year is selected from amongst the school
[1:28:20] year's students of the month. In
[1:28:22] selecting this student, we're looking
[1:28:24] for the student who best represents our
[1:28:26] school in excellence, character, and
[1:28:29] example. This year the selected winner
[1:28:32] for this award is a student in whom we
[1:28:34] have seen consistent effort and hard
[1:28:36] work from this year academically. This
[1:28:39] is also a student who consistently
[1:28:41] contributes positively to our live
[1:28:44] classes. Treats the teachers and staff
[1:28:47] respectfully, maintains a positive and
[1:28:49] encouraging
[1:28:50] attitude. This year's student of the
[1:28:53] ward
[1:28:54] is Zachary
[1:28:57] Browning. Come up, Zack. Come on
[1:29:01] up. Congratulations,
[1:29:03] [Applause]
[1:29:10] Zachary. Okay, I'll be

[1:29:41] and just give you our heartfelt thanks
[1:29:44] for everything that you've been to our
[1:29:45] school. Yeah. Everything that we've seen
[1:29:48] here, you have touched and impacted and
[1:29:50] have your had your had your hand in
[1:29:52] every p bit of it. And uh it's been just
[1:29:55] a joy and an honor on my part to be able
[1:29:57] to just to help you and be a team with
[1:30:00] you. It's we've had a bit of a journey.
[1:30:02] Yeah. But God handcrafted you for this.

[1:30:08] this moment. And and so sister Sarah's

[1:30:11] going to do a little bit of little bit
[1:30:14] of payback. Payback time. Okay. Okay. Uh
[1:30:18] I think brother Michael said it so well.
[1:30:20] I can't really add anything to that
[1:30:22] other than um you're not only a
[1:30:26] colleague as we might say um but you
[1:30:28] have become a very dear friend. I always
[1:30:30] look forward to our conversations. Miss
[1:30:32] Leonard is always willing to teach me. I
[1:30:35] learn something from her every time we
[1:30:37] talk. Um because I'm I'm kind of old
[1:30:40] school. I'm still learning about
[1:30:42] computers. She helps me. Um, seems like
[1:30:46] the last five years I've had a personal
[1:30:48] challenge every single year. Last year I
[1:30:50] had a concussion. Did not expect that. I
[1:30:53] was not playing volleyball, but um,
[1:30:55] nonetheless, um, Miss Leonard has helped
[1:30:58] me, you know, crest the waves time and
[1:31:00] time again. So, on behalf of not just
[1:31:03] the teachers, but the families alike,

[1:33:51] super quick, but uh, it was so exciting
[1:33:54] to meet you, brother Michael. Um, he's
[1:33:57] the grandson of Brother Biscll, if you
[1:33:59] do not know. I first saw your
[1:34:01] grandfather when he was your age. That
[1:34:03] was many, many years ago. Um, we don't
[1:34:06] get to see you as often as we do see
[1:34:08] Miss Sister Becky or Miss Leonard, but
[1:34:11] we know you're there. You're steady.
[1:34:13] You're diligent. Um, he's all the
[1:34:16] things, right? But it is it is my honor
[1:34:19] to work for you if I may say. And if on
[1:34:21] a personal note, I remember in
[1:34:23] 1994 I heard about this Bible way
[1:34:26] Christian Academy. I was a newlywed and
[1:34:29] hoping to have children. I was like,
[1:34:31] "Wow, I wonder if Brother Biscll would
[1:34:34] hire me, but I'm like, I'm already 800
[1:34:37] miles away from my folks. I don't know
[1:34:39] that I could go that far." Plus, the
[1:34:41] Lord called us to be uh here under
[1:34:44] Brother Donny's ministry. Um, so I
[1:34:46] thought, my my. So then time passed.
[1:34:49] Sure enough, in 2020, I got a call from
[1:34:51] Miss Leonard based on sister Becky's re
[1:34:54] recommendation. And so I am indeed
[1:34:57] working for Bible way. It took a while
[1:35:00] to get here, but brother Michael, you
[1:35:02] just you're a blessing, and we thank you
[1:35:04] for all your behind-the-scenes work.
[1:35:05] Miss Leonard said it beautifully. So
[1:35:07] without further ado, we have just a
[1:35:08] little something for you. Uh, it's a
[1:35:11] handcrafted in our little storytelling
[1:35:14] town, Jonesboro. So, God bless you,
[1:35:15] brother. Thank you so much.
[1:35:19] Yes.
[1:35:24] Thank you so much. My goodness. Pardon
[1:35:27] our length a little bit, but it's been
[1:35:28] five years of a lot of uh work and many
[1:35:31] years before that of preparation. So, we
[1:35:33] just took a little extra time and uh
[1:35:35] we're just enjoying the moment. Thank
[1:35:36] you so much. It's been quite an evening.
[1:35:38] And I I just want to say students, you
[1:35:41] you really impacted me, Miss Leonard,
[1:35:42] reading those those statements there
[1:35:44] that um that's why we do this. That's
[1:35:47] what drives us forward. And I just I
[1:35:49] just was so special to be able to hear
[1:35:51] those. Thank you for writing them.
[1:35:52] That's uh God give us the strength and
[1:35:55] the courage to continue for another five
[1:35:56] if he gives us that time. And so
[1:35:59] congratulations to everyone that was uh
[1:36:01] here and congratulations for finishing
[1:36:03] the year. here and we're going to take a
[1:36:04] little pause and have a little dinner
[1:36:07] and we'll have a part two for our
[1:36:09] graduation. And I might maybe I might
[1:36:11] just ask the Browning if you'd able to
[1:36:13] come and just pray for the food and and
[1:36:15] just close this little part in prayer.
[1:36:17] Brother Browning is one of the pastors
[1:36:20] here and he's taken some devotions for
[1:36:22] us and we're just so thankful for each
[1:36:24] one that has been part it's been many
[1:36:27] contributors to the school and so we
[1:36:29] thank you.

[1:36:48] we're just so thankful, Lord, and just
[1:36:52] to see, Lord, your hand and upon, Lord,
[1:36:55] the vision. And we're thankful, Father,
[1:36:58] in this moment in time, Lord, that
[1:37:00] you've given us a place, Lord, and they
[1:37:04] can be gathered together, Lord, even
[1:37:06] though it would be online. And but we're
[1:37:09] thankful for that opportunity, Lord.
[1:37:11] We're thankful for the effect, Lord. And
[1:37:14] Lord Jesus, your influence, Lord, upon
[1:37:17] the lives of these young people. We want
[1:37:20] to say thank you, Lord. We pray, Father,
[1:37:23] that you'll just bless the food now,
[1:37:26] Lord. Bless the time, Lord, that we
[1:37:28] would have together. Bless the remaining
[1:37:29] part of the evening. And we pray that
[1:37:31] Lord, you'd just grant a real
[1:37:34] refreshing, Lord, to all that have
[1:37:36] poured into this, Lord, the teachers,
[1:37:38] the administrators, Lord. We thank you,
[1:37:40] Father, for the sacrifice that they've
[1:37:43] given, Lord. And we appreciate, Lord,
[1:37:46] ultimately, Lord, the sacrifice that
[1:37:48] you've made for us, Lord. We love you
