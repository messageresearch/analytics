TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and i heard a great voice revelation 16 1 out of the temple saying to the seven angels go your ways and pour out the vows of the wrath of god upon the earth and the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth and there fell annoys some and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast and upon them which worshipped his image i found this word overwhelming today worshiped to kiss like a dog licking his masters to kiss the hand towards one in token of reverence holy father but instead of you kissing that hand god has let you kiss the son you see he said kiss the son in the book of psalms kiss the son lest he be angry with thee were it not for the grace of god brother larry we would be bowing down kissing the hat but instead we'll be bound down kissing the feet oh jesus oh jesus jesus i love you i've always wanted to see your face can i take a minute take all the time you need tony i heard your voice when i was a little boy you've dealt with me my whole life oh i knew your eyes would be wonderful i didn't know they would be that powerful your hair your feet your fingers thank you thank you for loving me and jesus might say donny thank you for loving me oh my thank you for giving me your life thank you for letting me use you i was saying you ain't got nothing to thank me for i'm just an unworthy servant he said but you see you and i are partners together i needed somebody to preach my word and you were willing you were willing to forfeit whatever it took oh the lord look at me thank you i loved you donny before you loved me i had you in my mind there's a little seed and i took a picture of you when you was at your best and while we're just enjoying all this the people on the earth are screaming hollering they're broke out and sores because they took on the mark of the beast catholicism and protestantism you see every person that's baptized in the titles of father son holy ghost is baptized into the catholic church many of the protestants will never bow down to the pope's ring but they bowed down to the pope's doctrine i wish some of our protestant brothers would go back and just study a little bit historically and find out what some of these illegitimate popes have said down through the years about your bible they don't believe that a bible a bit more than you believe a funny book is the gospel then you'd take a cartoon book they do not believe god's word notice let me close so they pour out the vial upon the earth and their fell annoys them which is wicked and grievous sore and where did this come from the tabernacle the temple and the tabernacle and the testimony you mean that come out of the house of god stored up wrath and why didn't that have your name on it why because the container that come out of the house of god with your name on it salvation
