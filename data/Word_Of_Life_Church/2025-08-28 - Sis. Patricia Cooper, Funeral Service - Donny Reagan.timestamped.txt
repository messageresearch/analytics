[18:50] God, God bless each of you for coming
[18:52] out this evening to celebrate the life
[18:53] of our sister Patty, to support brother
[18:57] Don and the family during this time. And
[18:59] I know your presence here brings them
[19:01] comfort. And and brother Don, we offer
[19:04] our condolences to you and the family
[19:06] and the friends who mourn for sister
[19:08] Patty's passing.
[19:10] But you know, we weep not as those who
[19:13] have no hope. And though our hearts are
[19:16] sad at the passing of our sister, there
[19:19] is a joy in knowing that
[19:22] she has made it home.
[19:25] Let's bow our heads.
[19:31] Father, we come before you this evening
[19:32] with thanksgiving in our hearts.
[19:35] For the revelation that's given us in
[19:37] your word, for it's written, precious in
[19:39] the sight of the Lord is the death of
[19:41] his saints. It is also written unto our
[19:44] God belongs the issues of death. For we
[19:47] know that Christians don't die. They
[19:49] just change dwelling places.
[19:52] And may we find comfort in your word. We
[19:55] pray and we ask your blessings upon this
[19:57] service tonight. May all be done for
[20:01] your glory. We ask for your comfort that
[20:06] you comfort the hearts of the family and
[20:07] the friends and that you'd be with our
[20:09] precious brother Don and help him in the
[20:11] days ahead.
[20:13] Fill the emptiness that's left in his
[20:15] heart with your presence and your mercy
[20:18] and your grace.
[20:21] Thank you for the life our sister Patty
[20:24] lived, Lord. For she lived that life by
[20:27] the word and a life lived by the word as
[20:30] the word expressed.
[20:32] And we saw Christ in our sister's life.
[20:36] So Lord, we commit these things, this
[20:37] service, and all that's done. May it be
[20:39] done for your glory. For we ask it in
[20:42] Jesus name. Amen.
[20:49] Patricia Jean Garrettson Cooper, 76,
[20:54] Johnson City, passed away Friday, August
[20:57] the 22nd, 2025 at her residence,
[20:59] surrounded by her loving family.
[21:03] She was born September the 1st, 1948 in
[21:06] Emma Mariah, West Virginia to the late
[21:08] Denver and Pauline Cunningham
[21:11] Garrettson.
[21:12] Patty was a former payroll administrator
[21:15] for Ideal Corrugated Box Company from
[21:18] 1967 to 1973.
[21:22] On August the 25th, 1973,
[21:25] she married Brother Don Cooper and was
[21:28] then a full-time wife and a homemaker.
[21:32] She loved to garden and had some
[21:34] beautiful flowers.
[21:36] Patty has been a faithful Christian her
[21:38] whole life and loved attending here at
[21:40] Word of Life Church.
[21:42] Survivors include her loving husband of
[21:44] almost 52 years, Donald E. Cooper.
[21:48] Brothers and sister-in-laws Charles and
[21:49] Eveina Cooper of Holland, Michigan,
[21:52] Junior and Brenda Cooper of Olive,
[21:54] Kentucky, Forest and Phyllis Wren of
[21:56] Mansfield, Ohio, and Anne Cooper of
[21:59] Olive, Kentucky, and several nieces,
[22:01] nephews, and cousins
[22:04] and brothers and sisters here in the
[22:06] church who will sadly miss her.
[22:12] As I was looking over Sister Patty's
[22:13] obituary,
[22:15] I noticed it never said she ran for
[22:17] governor of West Virginia
[22:19] or mayor of Elizabeth. And it never said
[22:22] she was a successful songwriter or an
[22:24] actor.
[22:26] Never said that Hollywood was mourning
[22:28] her loss.
[22:30] It never said none of that.
[22:34] But what it did say was that she was a
[22:36] love a loving wife to brother Don, a
[22:40] homemaker who loved gardens and flowers.
[22:44] A devout Christian who served God her
[22:46] whole life.
[22:48] And that's my memories of her was in
[22:51] church sitting beside brother Don
[22:53] worshiping God and receiving his word
[22:56] and seeing that Christlike nature that
[22:59] was reflected in her life. Those are my
[23:02] memories of her.
[23:03] And though the governor of Tennessee may
[23:05] not know her name,
[23:08] I believe the God who created heavens
[23:11] and earth does.
[23:14] &gt;&gt; For he wrote her name in his book before
[23:16] the foundation of the world. And just a
[23:19] few days ago, when Sister Patty left
[23:21] this dimension, there was a great cloud
[23:23] of witnesses rejoicing as she stepped
[23:25] upon the shore. For Sister Patty made it
[23:28] home. And though Hollywood didn't know
[23:31] her, this group did. And with loving
[23:35] arms, they welcomed Sister Patty home.
[23:40] Goresis,
[23:42] till we meet you again. May God bless
[23:45] each of you. Be my prayer in Jesus name.
[24:01] [Music]
[24:17] Suddenly the pain is gone
[24:21] that I suffered for so long.
[24:25] Now I stand at an open door.
[24:31] [Music]
[24:33] As I take one step in time,
[24:37] I begin to realize
[24:42] what my soul's been longing for.
[24:47] [Music]
[24:49] Mortal words cannot describe
[24:53] what appears before my eyes.
[24:58] [Music]
[25:00] And I'm just inside the gate.
[25:06] [Applause]
[25:08] Just inside the gate where love.
[25:16] God's light shining from the throne
[25:19] fills heaven with a soul.
[25:26] Can't believe the change in me.
[25:30] I've never felt so free.
[25:35] [Music]
[25:37] And I'm just inside the gate.
[25:45] Now at last my mind is clear.
[25:49] Worldly thoughts have disappeared.
[25:53] Now every thought is just of him.
[26:01] No more worries, doubt, or fears.
[26:05] These new eyes can't shed a tear.
[26:10] It's peace and joy now that dwells
[26:13] within.
[26:18] Never felt so young and strong.
[26:22] This place, it is my home.
[26:29] And I'm just inside the gate.
[26:36] Just inside the gate where love ones.
[26:45] God's light shining from the throne
[26:48] fills heaven with the soul.
[26:55] I can't believe the change in me.
[26:59] I've never felt so free.
[27:06] And I'm just inside again.
[27:11] [Music]
[27:14] More than I have ever dreamed.
[27:18] You have heard or I have seen
[27:23] and I'm just inside
[27:30] just inside the gate where love.
[27:39] God's light shining from the throne
[27:42] fills heaven with the soul.
[27:49] I can't believe the change in me.
[27:53] I've never felt so free.
[27:58] Oh,
[28:00] and I'm just inside the game.
[28:08] And I'm just inside the game.
[28:14] [Music]
[28:24] to the family. God bless you.
[28:28] They say that
[28:30] one of the most sweetest sounds to the
[28:32] ear
[28:34] is when you hear your name called.
[28:37] A few weeks ago, I had a distinct
[28:41] pleasure of having breakfast with
[28:44] brother Don, sister Patty, and it was
[28:46] unplanned, unrehearsed. I was having
[28:49] some work done on my truck. It's
[28:52] backsliding.
[28:54] When you all think of it, pray for it.
[28:58] And usually if where I where I take it,
[29:01] uh there's a little restaurant I usually
[29:03] go to in the morning, eat breakfast or
[29:04] whatever. I took my backpack and was
[29:07] going to study and things of that sort,
[29:08] but it was closed. And so I um knew that
[29:13] the little Hardies was just right down
[29:14] the road and I didn't mind walking.
[29:18] Exercise did me some good, but I thought
[29:20] about when I'm going have to walk back
[29:23] and so I took the journey. Many times
[29:25] footsteps of the Lord or footsteps of
[29:28] the righteous order of the Lord. And
[29:30] many times when we have things that
[29:31] happen, we don't understand fully. And
[29:34] even after we have the encounter, we
[29:36] still don't understand fully. But when I
[29:39] stepped into the restaurant, I saw
[29:41] Brother Don, Sister Patty at the
[29:43] counter. And I uh snuck up behind them.
[29:46] And and I'll never forget this, Brother
[29:49] Don. And it still rings in my ear
[29:51] talking about hearing your your name
[29:53] called. I made my way up behind them to
[29:56] their left and
[29:58] Sister Patty looked up to my left. Joel.
[30:02] Just like that.
[30:04] And we sat down and you know we we we
[30:07] had our breakfast and I watched her as
[30:08] she uh never seen this before. I watched
[30:11] her as she had her biscuit and gravy and
[30:13] she brother Don helped her open up her
[30:15] pack of jelly. She put jelly in her
[30:18] biscuits and gravy. That's country stuff
[30:21] there.
[30:23] Simple stuff. But spending that time
[30:26] with them, learned a little about their
[30:29] love story and just the the joy that
[30:33] they had in life.
[30:36] But hearing the name called and just on
[30:40] Friday, just a few hours before she
[30:41] passed, I was there at the house.
[30:44] Brother Don, I just thank you for the
[30:46] call letting me know and I just wanted
[30:49] to come and just be what I could be
[30:52] during that time and just learned a
[30:55] little more about their story.
[30:57] And
[31:01] I was just wondering when brother Don
[31:03] asked me to say a few words this
[31:05] evening, what was I going to say? and
[31:07] just began to pray about it and just the
[31:10] inspiration came and I just want to
[31:13] share this with you, brother Don.
[31:15] And it it expresses some things that
[31:18] that you told me and things that you all
[31:21] shared.
[31:24] When it's time to say goodbye
[31:26] in memory of Patty.
[31:31] When it's time to say goodbye, but the
[31:33] words just won't form and the tongue
[31:37] tangles even with the thought because
[31:41] this time by isn't good.
[31:47] We exchanged this expression often as we
[31:50] journeyed together, but it was always
[31:52] with the thought and knowing it was only
[31:55] for a short time until we would unite
[31:58] again.
[32:00] Goodbye.
[32:01] I love you. I'll be back soon.
[32:05] But this time,
[32:08] this time it's different.
[32:11] The last words I heard you say bore my
[32:14] name as you called me from across the
[32:17] room.
[32:18] Hey, Don.
[32:20] The second it took me to be at your side
[32:23] was all that was needed for your words
[32:25] from then on to become faint,
[32:29] iniccernable, undicernable mumblings.
[32:33] I couldn't make out what you were saying
[32:35] after you said Don.
[32:39] And then
[32:42] your words
[32:45] were gone.
[32:47] Our conversation was over.
[32:51] I'll treasure that word, Don.
[32:54] Not because it's my name, but because
[32:58] you said it.
[33:01] God allowed the last thing I heard you
[33:03] to say here in time space to be my name.
[33:10] I will treasure that.
[33:12] I will carry it for the rest of my time
[33:15] here in time.
[33:18] It will be just as valuable and precious
[33:22] and real with substance and full of life
[33:25] as you were to me.
[33:30] As was my ritual upon waking, I reached
[33:34] across the bed to take your hand.
[33:38] But you weren't there.
[33:41] You were gone.
[33:44] Goodbye.
[33:47] Only this time, it's different.
[33:52] Just as it is when something needs to be
[33:54] said because saying that one thing, that
[33:57] one simple thing will somehow change
[34:00] things forever.
[34:02] I can't seem to get the words to loose
[34:05] from my tongue.
[34:08] So now it's time to say goodbye.
[34:14] Now that it's time to say goodbye, I am
[34:16] met with a new reality.
[34:19] A promise of stepping back into eternity
[34:23] together,
[34:24] hand in hand,
[34:28] you and me
[34:30] again.
[34:32] eternal
[34:34] and then then
[34:37] we can finish the conversation we began
[34:41] here.
[34:42] Hey, Don.
[34:44] Yeah, honey.
[34:46] God bless you.
[34:55] [Music]
[35:06] I can just see them walking on the
[35:11] shores
[35:12] of heaven,
[35:18] praising the Lord,
[35:21] watching the tides roll
[35:24] [Music]
[35:29] friends that have gone on. Oh, how I
[35:33] miss you so.
[35:36] [Music]
[35:41] Somehow I know if you could
[35:45] you let me know
[35:52] you're doing fine.
[35:55] It doesn't hurt anymore.
[36:00] [Music]
[36:04] Things couldn't be better.
[36:07] Heaven is worth waiting
[36:11] for.
[36:15] And you miss me, too. Until then, you'll
[36:20] be thinking of me.
[36:26] [Music]
[36:27] And I know if you could talk to me now,
[36:32] here's what you'd say to me.
[36:39] Wish you were here.
[36:42] It's such a beautiful
[36:45] place.
[36:51] Wish you were here.
[36:54] Nothing but clear sunny days.
[36:59] [Music]
[37:03] It never rains and no one complains.
[37:08] We haven't seen a tear.
[37:13] Oh,
[37:14] having a great time.
[37:19] Wish you were here.
[37:26] I can just see them walking on the
[37:30] shores
[37:32] together.
[37:35] [Music]
[37:37] They're talking of Jesus,
[37:40] safe and secure in his love.
[37:49] friends and loved ones walking in
[37:53] heavenly peace.
[38:00] And I know if they could talk to me now,
[38:05] here's what they'd say to me.
[38:12] Wish you were here.
[38:15] It's such a beautiful
[38:18] place.
[38:20] [Applause]
[38:24] Wish you were here.
[38:27] Nothing but clear sunny days.
[38:36] It never rains and no one complains.
[38:41] We haven't seen a tear.
[38:46] Oh, we're having a great time.
[38:50] [Music]
[38:51] Wish you were here.
[38:54] [Music]
[38:59] It never rains and no one complains.
[39:04] We haven't seen a tear.
[39:09] Oh, we're having a great time
[39:15] [Music]
[39:17] and we wish you were
[39:22] here.
[39:23] [Music]
[39:41] certainly wish to extend our condolences
[39:44] to
[39:45] family and friends of our departed
[39:48] sister.
[39:50] I'd like to read to you tonight from Job
[39:53] chapter 42.
[39:55] Who is he that hideth counsel without
[39:58] knowledge?
[40:00] Therefore have I uttered that I
[40:02] understood not, things too wonderful for
[40:06] me, which I knew not. Here I beseech
[40:11] thee, and I will speak. I will demand of
[40:14] thee, and declare thou unto me.
[40:19] I have heard of thee by the hearing of
[40:22] the ear, but now mine eye
[40:27] seeth thee.
[40:30] I'd like to speak to you for just a just
[40:32] for a few minutes about I've heard
[40:36] but now I see
[40:40] sister Patty
[40:42] certainly meant a lot to us yours church
[40:44] family and each of you that are your
[40:47] family members and friends and no doubt
[40:49] each of you would have something that
[40:52] you could say specifically about her
[40:55] that maybe no one else could today.
[40:59] We were certainly blessed to have her
[41:01] and brother Dawn here with us for all
[41:03] the years that they were here.
[41:06] And she's experienced things already
[41:09] just in the last few days that most of
[41:13] us have only heard about.
[41:16] When she was younger, she heard that she
[41:20] was a sinner and she heard that God
[41:24] provided a savior.
[41:28] Faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[41:30] the word. She heard about it and then
[41:33] something supernatural happened in her
[41:36] soul. And then she could say, "I have
[41:40] heard,
[41:42] but now I see."
[41:45] So maybe she had knew about Christians
[41:46] and heard about Christians, but she
[41:49] wasn't one until the work of
[41:52] Christianity happened in her own heart.
[41:55] You see, life itself is like that.
[41:57] There's lots of things that we hear
[42:00] about, and many of them we will never
[42:03] see.
[42:04] But as we go on in life, we realize the
[42:07] things that have the most value are
[42:09] those things which are of eternal value.
[42:13] No doubt Sister Patty had heard about
[42:15] the Holy Ghost. Might have seemed very
[42:17] strange to her for a while as it was in
[42:20] the book of Acts when Paul came to the
[42:22] upper coast of Ephesus and said, "How
[42:25] were you all baptized?" And began to
[42:26] inquire about their salvation and so on.
[42:29] And they said, "Have you received the
[42:31] Holy Ghost?" And they said, "We've not
[42:33] even heard that there was any Holy
[42:35] Ghost." So they said, "Well, how was you
[42:36] baptized?" So they begin to tell them,
[42:39] and it was the first they'd heard about
[42:41] it. So as he began to tell them about
[42:44] that, they had their own supernatural
[42:48] experience and they could say, "I have
[42:52] heard,
[42:53] but now
[42:55] &gt;&gt; I see."
[42:57] You see, Sister Patty had heard for
[42:59] years
[43:01] one of the most beloved psalms that
[43:03] there is, of course, in the cannon of
[43:05] scripture, and it was this one. Psalm
[43:08] 23:3.
[43:10] He restoreth my soul. He leadth me in
[43:13] the paths of righteousness for his
[43:16] name's sake. Yay, though I walk through
[43:19] the valley of the shadow of death, I
[43:23] will fear no evil. For thy rod and thy
[43:28] staff, they comfort me. Now, for every
[43:32] one of us here tonight, we realize if
[43:35] we're not alive when the Lord comes that
[43:38] we will go by the way of the grave.
[43:41] And there's an uncertainty about death.
[43:43] We can fear water. We can fear heights.
[43:47] We can fear cancer. We can fear all
[43:50] types of things. But ultimately, the
[43:53] greatest fear that man has is death
[43:56] itself. Is it really cancer that we fear
[43:58] so bad? Or is it we're afraid we will
[44:01] die or tuberculosis or whatever disease
[44:05] that it might be being up high. Some
[44:09] people terrified by heights. Why? The
[44:11] ultimate fear deaths. So when David
[44:15] began to write this, the Old Testament
[44:17] perspective was death was so different
[44:20] than what we have today. But still he
[44:22] had an understanding that death had this
[44:26] darkness. But he used these powerful
[44:28] words that yay though I walked through
[44:30] the valley of the shadow of deaths. And
[44:35] even with the Old Testament perspective,
[44:37] he knew that there had to be so much
[44:39] light in order to make a shadow.
[44:44] Maybe sister Patty heard this scripture
[44:46] for many, many years, read about it, may
[44:49] even had it underlined and marked in her
[44:51] Bible. Yay, though I walk through the
[44:54] valley of the shadow of death.
[44:57] But if she could answer us back tonight,
[45:01] she could say, "I saw that in Psalms.
[45:05] I heard that preached about, but now I
[45:09] see what that means."
[45:12] That it's not terrifying at all. That
[45:16] it's not even frightening.
[45:19] It's just like a journey that you're
[45:22] making and it's so rapid and so fast.
[45:25] Yay, though I walk through the valley of
[45:28] the shadow of death, I will fear no
[45:31] evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and
[45:34] thy staff, they comfort me.
[45:38] So our sister could say to us, I have
[45:41] heard, but now I see
[45:45] for this was fulfilled in me.
[45:49] St. John 14:1, the Lord Jesus, he is
[45:53] going to give us a perspective of death
[45:56] that man had never had before. And he
[45:59] said this, "Let not your heart be
[46:01] troubled. You believe in God, believe
[46:04] also in me. For in my father's house are
[46:09] many mansions. Now he's not talking
[46:12] about buildings made out of cinder block
[46:14] and two befores, but if you look at your
[46:17] Greek word there, it's way beyond just
[46:19] natural houses. But it's a body to live
[46:23] in. In my father's house are many
[46:25] mansions. If it were not so, I would
[46:28] have told you. I go to prepare a place
[46:32] for you. And if I go to prepare a place
[46:35] for you, I will come again and receive
[46:37] you unto myself that where I am, there
[46:41] you may be also. No doubt as a
[46:44] Christian, she read that in her Bible
[46:47] and maybe just sat there and cry and
[46:50] think, "Wow, I wonder what that's going
[46:52] to be like."
[46:54] And she heard about it for years. But
[46:57] tonight she could say, "I have heard,
[47:02] but now I see."
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Now I see. What is this body here?
[47:11] You walked around by, you paid your
[47:14] respects,
[47:16] you looked at that body. If you touched
[47:18] it, it was cold, lifeless.
[47:22] You see, death is the settler of scores.
[47:27] What is man? Soul and dust.
[47:32] Life and yet at the same time working in
[47:35] our mortal body. Death is also working
[47:38] as well. And what does death do? Deaths
[47:42] settles the score.
[47:44] Whether you're rich or barely make your
[47:47] bills from one paycheck to another.
[47:50] Death has a way of putting every human
[47:53] being on the exact same plane.
[47:57] Heaven has no ritzy neighborhoods where
[48:00] the upper class Christians live and then
[48:04] ghettos on the other side of the poor
[48:06] Christians. And you see death itself
[48:09] levels all of that before us. I preached
[48:12] many, many funerals. I have never seen
[48:15] one casket full of gold. I've never seen
[48:20] one with Cadillac keys, Rolls-Royce
[48:23] keys, BMW keys. I've never seen titles,
[48:28] deeds. I've never seen $100 bills
[48:31] stacked up in there. You know why? The
[48:35] person there can't take a one of those
[48:37] things.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; So, when we come to this earth, we come
[48:42] naked.
[48:44] Pretty good type really. We have
[48:47] nothing.
[48:49] But when we leave, now you see we're
[48:52] talking about a different story. We come
[48:55] naked. We couldn't walk. We couldn't
[48:58] talk for days. We couldn't see.
[49:02] We had no reasoning hardly any
[49:04] understanding. We knew our mother's
[49:06] voice because we heard it as she was
[49:08] carrying us in the womb. Everybody else
[49:10] we had to learn.
[49:13] But now we've been through this school
[49:15] called the school of life. And when we
[49:18] leave this school of life, we will not
[49:21] leave naked. We will take things with
[49:24] us, but it's not the things that we put
[49:27] the majority of our time on. I'm afraid
[49:30] it will be our character, our
[49:32] reputation,
[49:34] our honor.
[49:36] You see those who die pulpers and
[49:39] brother Louie has shared it with me
[49:41] before working there at the funeral home
[49:43] that there's many people that when they
[49:45] die and they get their bodies and they
[49:49] have to take care of them. And he's told
[49:51] me before time and time again there will
[49:54] be no one not one person even show up to
[49:59] look at that person's body. Brother Lou
[50:02] asked me not long ago, but don't you
[50:04] think it'd be all right if I just stood
[50:05] up and sometime just read a little
[50:09] scripture and just tried to say a little
[50:11] something. Now, you think how sad that
[50:15] is that there's no one to cry one tear.
[50:18] There's no one there to say we'll miss
[50:21] you so much as a lot of it that person's
[50:24] fault could be and it could be
[50:27] circumstances beyond their control. So
[50:30] you see when we leave this life we want
[50:33] to be able to say as our sister has said
[50:36] I have heard but now I see 2 Corinthians
[50:42] 5:1 I love this passage of scripture for
[50:45] notice this earthly house of this
[50:48] tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[50:51] building of God so here Paul is picking
[50:55] up St. John 14 and showing us that the
[50:59] place we're going to is not a building
[51:01] like this or the home that you live or
[51:02] the condo or the apartment that you
[51:04] rent, but it's actually a building of
[51:08] God. My mother and father gave me my
[51:11] body. 23 chromosomes from my mother, 23
[51:14] from my father. They come together and I
[51:17] started being formed in my mother's
[51:18] womb. I got so much of my daddy, so much
[51:22] of my mother. My hands look like my
[51:24] grandfather. The older I get, the more
[51:26] look I look like my daddy. But what
[51:30] about whenever we leave here? So when I
[51:33] go out of this body, do I have to wait
[51:35] for my mama and daddy to give me another
[51:38] body? No. You see, mama and daddy gave
[51:42] me a mortal realm that my soul could
[51:44] live in. For what purpose? So I could
[51:48] take with me the correct thing to go on
[51:52] the other side. If time would terry in a
[51:55] few generations, Sister Patty Cooper's
[51:58] name will be hardly any more than a
[52:01] memory. There will be people that'll
[52:03] walk in the cemetery where we'll take
[52:06] the body to tomorrow and they'll walk by
[52:08] there and maybe stop and look and say,
[52:10] "Patty Cooper, born on a certain day,
[52:14] died on a certain day. Wonder who she
[52:16] was. Wonder what she ever done." They
[52:20] might try to Google her and find maybe
[52:22] where we had this funeral service and
[52:24] they think she must not amounted to
[52:27] much. It depends on who you ask. You
[52:30] see, I think our brothers already said
[52:33] it very well. The flag was not flown at
[52:36] half mass today in Washington, nor in
[52:39] our capital in Nashville. But when our
[52:42] sister got ready to pass over, I
[52:45] guarantee you there was quite a crowd
[52:48] awaiting for her. She had no siblings in
[52:51] this life, no brothers and no sisters.
[52:55] But let me tell you, she is part of the
[52:58] biggest family that you can imagine in
[53:01] your life. It's the children of God whom
[53:05] he forneew before the foundation of the
[53:08] world. And when she was stepping out of
[53:11] that old ship of Zion, I can imagine,
[53:14] oh, it ain't been that long ago in the
[53:15] way that God would count time. But all
[53:18] of them brothers and sisters, true
[53:21] brothers and sisters of the family of
[53:23] God, were rushing down there to meet her
[53:26] that day. Paul goes on to say that this
[53:30] body is like a tabernacle. So it if it
[53:34] were dissolved, notice how he frames
[53:36] this now. This body that we love, this
[53:39] body that we feed and nurture and take
[53:42] care of, yet the ultimate end for us all
[53:46] is disillusion and breaking up and the
[53:51] body going back to the dust of the
[53:53] earth. We idolize it. We comb every
[53:56] hair. We want to look just as good as we
[54:00] can, but ultimately we're headed back
[54:04] for dust.
[54:06] But I'm so glad that's not our end.
[54:10] But we have a building of God, an house
[54:13] not made with hands, eternal
[54:17] in the heavens.
[54:19] So this mortal life is a pilgrimage and
[54:24] our body is a tent. Now remember Paul
[54:28] part of his occupation was he was a tent
[54:31] maker. So as he would sew those tents
[54:35] and take those skins and material and
[54:38] they would manufacture them, no doubt
[54:40] for people that were wealthy and they
[54:42] would want us a certain type of a tent
[54:44] with particular threads and particular
[54:47] sewings. And you would know a person was
[54:49] a wealthy individual by the color of
[54:50] their tent because they could only
[54:52] afford the poor people could not afford
[54:55] certain dyes such as blues and crimsons
[54:58] and reds and scarlets. So you saw
[55:00] somebody with a scarlet tent, you saw
[55:03] somebody with an indigo blue tent, you
[55:05] know they were very wealthy. They were
[55:08] identified by the color of their tent.
[55:11] So Paul, the revelation must have struck
[55:14] his heart. I I see it. So this body is
[55:19] like a tent. And what is a tent? A
[55:23] temporary dwelling. So Paul would make
[55:26] tents for people. They would come in,
[55:28] buy them, pay them for them. They would
[55:30] take them out. They would take them, set
[55:32] them up. What for? Just for a temporary
[55:35] season. They have no foundation, no
[55:36] footer. They're not put together with
[55:38] staples or with wood glue or nothing
[55:40] like that. Held up by the sides with
[55:42] poles. And they take them down and move
[55:45] them here and move them there. What is a
[55:47] tent? A temporary structure.
[55:51] And it struck him. So that's what this
[55:54] body is.
[55:56] It's just a tent.
[55:59] And then heavenly revelation struck his
[56:02] soul and he realized, but there is a
[56:07] house.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Notice he doesn't say that place there
[56:11] is a tent, but a house.
[56:15] A house. And he says it was eternal in
[56:20] the heavens. So our present bodies are
[56:23] only tabernacles of tents that house our
[56:27] soul.
[56:29] Friends, in verse two, he says, "For in
[56:32] this we groan earnestly, desiring to be
[56:37] clothed upon with our house which is
[56:40] from heaven." I know sister Patty has
[56:43] heard me preach on this scripture over
[56:46] and over and over again.
[56:49] But Sister Patty could tell you
[56:51] something tonight about this scripture
[56:53] &gt;&gt; that I can't tell you.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; I believe it because I've heard it for
[57:00] years. She could say, "I believed it cuz
[57:02] I heard it."
[57:04] &gt;&gt; But if she could take this microphone
[57:06] tonight, she could say, "Brother Donnie,
[57:09] I have heard
[57:10] &gt;&gt; but now I see."
[57:13] &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm waiting for,
[57:15] friends. I don't want to just hear about
[57:17] it. I want to see it. She has heard, but
[57:23] now she sees. Notice this. Paul says,
[57:25] "Therefore, we are always confident
[57:28] knowing that whilst we are at home in
[57:31] the body, we are absent from the Lord.
[57:35] For we walk by faith and not by sight.
[57:38] And we are confident, I say, and willing
[57:42] rather to be absent from the body and to
[57:46] be present with the Lord. No doubt she
[57:50] heard this scripture as well. For I am
[57:54] now ready to be offered and the time of
[57:57] my departure is at hand. A metaphor that
[58:01] Paul used of the ships being loosed from
[58:04] the mooring. Now remember didn't have
[58:06] buses and airplanes in that dream. Paul
[58:08] made a not a lot of trips on the
[58:10] commercial ships and he would step up on
[58:13] there and they could saw the moorings
[58:15] and they would have them big massive
[58:17] ropes and they had the ship tied there
[58:19] as they was lading it down with goods
[58:21] and all types of things. And Paul would
[58:23] walk up there and the believers would be
[58:26] on the shore and he'd be waving goodbye
[58:28] to them. We'll see you later Paul. God
[58:31] bless you. And Paul would stand there.
[58:33] God bless you. Saints of Ephesus, God
[58:37] bless you. Saints of Kepernam, God bless
[58:40] you. Saints of Thessalonica. If I don't
[58:43] see again, I'll see on the other side.
[58:46] And they'd loose the ship. And they'd
[58:49] still be waving, waving,
[58:52] waving, the voice getting fainter and
[58:57] fainter.
[59:00] And again, Paul thought that's what life
[59:03] is.
[59:05] So I know my the time is close. And
[59:08] remember, he's a Roman citizen. They
[59:11] kill you. For a Roman citizen, your
[59:13] deaths was one thing. They remove your
[59:16] head,
[59:18] decapitate you.
[59:21] But Paul looked at it this way.
[59:24] My time is at hand. I'm ready to be
[59:28] offered. Can you imagine a man using a
[59:32] word like a sacrifice? Now, it's not an
[59:35] offering for sin, but symbolism of a
[59:39] drink offering. So Paul said, "My life
[59:42] is going to be poured out."
[59:46] Oh, but I don't worry. You imagine he
[59:48] could lay his head right down in that
[59:51] cradle just like that and look at that
[59:55] man with that broad axe in his hands and
[59:58] say, "Go ahead, buddy. Take it off."
[1:00:03] Cuz it won't hit the ground or the
[1:00:06] basket until I'll be in a body that
[1:00:10] you'll never be able to touch. Amen.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Then Paul could say, "I wrote about
[1:00:16] those mansions. I wrote about those
[1:00:19] bodies. I was carried up there. I heard.
[1:00:24] But now
[1:00:26] I see."
[1:00:28] She heard, oh glory, that there was a
[1:00:32] land beyond the river. She heard me
[1:00:35] preach a bunch of funerals.
[1:00:37] She heard no doubt different songs about
[1:00:40] how beautiful heaven must be. She heard
[1:00:44] about beyond the curtain of time.
[1:00:49] Must have imagined in her mind what
[1:00:51] would it be like? But now she has seen.
[1:00:57] Oh hallelujah.
[1:01:01] Pardon me for a moment as I leave your
[1:01:04] audience.
[1:01:07] Sister Patty,
[1:01:11] I'd like to know tonight,
[1:01:15] how is it?
[1:01:17] Is it beyond what you thought?
[1:01:22] Oh, Brother Donnie,
[1:01:24] you've preached it since you were an
[1:01:26] 18-year-old boy.
[1:01:29] You've sung about it. You've talked
[1:01:32] about it.
[1:01:34] But I'm going to tell you, Brother
[1:01:35] Donnie, you can't even imagine
[1:01:39] how beautiful that it is.
[1:01:43] And I want to let you know, Brother
[1:01:45] Donnie,
[1:01:47] it wasn't too long after I crossed over,
[1:01:50] I saw this beautiful young girl,
[1:01:54] and her hair was hanging way down her
[1:01:56] back.
[1:01:58] And she kept running up to me and said,
[1:02:01] "Sister Patty,
[1:02:03] Sister Patty."
[1:02:06] And I might say, "Sister Patty, who was
[1:02:10] it?"
[1:02:12] Oh, Brother Donnie, it was Erica.
[1:02:16] I saw her. I've done seen Brother
[1:02:17] Calvin. I've seen Brother Daniel Nunley.
[1:02:21] I've seen this one. I've seen that one.
[1:02:23] I've seen loved ones. I've seen friends.
[1:02:27] Sister Pat, if you would have something
[1:02:30] you'd want me to tell your family
[1:02:31] tonight, what would it be?
[1:02:34] Tell them to press on, brother D.
[1:02:38] Tell them. Don't just say that they can
[1:02:42] have heard about it, but tell them they
[1:02:46] want to be able to see it so they can
[1:02:49] say what I said when I stepped out of
[1:02:53] that ship and I run my fingers through
[1:02:56] that blueg grass as it was blowing
[1:02:58] across.
[1:03:00] I've always loved flowers,
[1:03:02] but I saw yellows like I've never seen
[1:03:05] before. And it seemed like the blue, the
[1:03:09] azure blue of the sky was bluer than
[1:03:12] anything I've ever seen. The greens had
[1:03:16] such depth it seemed as if though they
[1:03:19] were dimensional looking at them that
[1:03:22] they would get deeper and deeper. And
[1:03:24] the blues and the violets and the
[1:03:27] purples,
[1:03:29] it was unbelievable.
[1:03:33] Sister Patty, are you tired? Are you
[1:03:36] kidding? I've not even stopped running
[1:03:39] yet. I'm shaking hands and hugging one
[1:03:43] another's necks. And
[1:03:46] there's no place to go and nobody has a
[1:03:48] clock. And nobody has a watch.
[1:03:52] I have heard. But now I see.
[1:03:57] Until dawn,
[1:03:59] I'll be waiting for him.
[1:04:19] Tell him
[1:04:23] I'll be waiting.
[1:04:27] It won't be but just a few more settings
[1:04:29] of the sun
[1:04:33] that he'll be able to say the same
[1:04:34] thing.
[1:04:37] I have heard
[1:04:41] but now I see
[1:04:46] it's barriets.
[1:04:55] Oh Jesus,
[1:05:01] we long to see that place. Lord,
[1:05:06] we know the very best this life can
[1:05:09] offer.
[1:05:11] It would be like
[1:05:14] a landfill or a dump.
[1:05:19] The birds are in the garbage going
[1:05:22] through scraps looking for a bite.
[1:05:26] Rats,
[1:05:28] cockroaches,
[1:05:31] it smells.
[1:05:34] That's the best that this life can
[1:05:36] offer.
[1:05:39] than if someone reached down and picked
[1:05:42] us up
[1:05:45] and brought us to a land where there's
[1:05:47] no more death, no more sighing, no more
[1:05:50] sorrow,
[1:05:54] and we were young again and never get
[1:05:57] old
[1:05:59] and there's no pain, no little children
[1:06:02] born blind.
[1:06:06] Lord, we could not by no means but have
[1:06:09] no desire to call our sister back.
[1:06:13] Just by what little bit she's seen
[1:06:15] already,
[1:06:17] she wouldn't want to come back.
[1:06:20] And yet we know your word says precious
[1:06:23] in the sight of the Lord is the death of
[1:06:25] his saints.
[1:06:27] But Father, we also know
[1:06:30] it makes such an empty spot in our
[1:06:33] hearts.
[1:06:35] So we pray
[1:06:38] you'd be mindful of us tonight. We pray
[1:06:40] for our precious brother Don,
[1:06:43] family members and friends.
[1:06:46] Dear God, would you just wrap your arms
[1:06:48] around each one that's grieving tonight,
[1:06:52] comfort them, Lord Jesus,
[1:06:55] as only you can do.
[1:06:58] May there not be a one of us missing at
[1:07:00] that day Lord that we will be able to
[1:07:04] stand and say one day too I have heard
[1:07:08] but now
[1:07:10] I see.
