[6:27] Lord if we would just know how to yield
[6:36] ourselves so many times father it it
[6:39] would be a lot simpler Lord to be able

[6:46] but sometimes we complicate things with
[6:48] our reasoning and Lord that makes things
[6:53] really complicated but tonight father I
[6:56] know you're just a prayer answering God

[7:22] come in simplicity and express God the
[7:25] simplicity God of this message God that

[30:34] outstanding just outstanding and the

[30:40] I believe it'd be a blessing blessing to
[30:42] you the other guy you know about in many
[30:45] ways Ephesians chapter 3 verse 10 also
[30:53] want to mention to you then I want to
[30:55] certainly continue to pray for brother
[30:57] Doug Baker in his church and all that
[31:00] God would just work all this out forms
[31:03] first the church burning and didn't
[31:06] destroy the church but still get heaven
[31:08] heard what they're going to do is
[31:09] they'll tear it down remodel it got
[31:13] water damage more smoke damage than
[31:15] anything but we all God God works these
[31:19] things out for us but you can imagine if
[31:22] it was us if our church would have
[31:25] burned or would we be having church that
[31:28] they're not having it tonight because
[31:31] they're not yet sure where they're gonna
[31:32] go or what they're gonna do so we don't
[31:35] want to just you know be so positive
[31:38] that we overlook reality I'm positive I
[31:42] believe in been positive but don't
[31:44] believe in being foolish so for
[31:46] circumstances advanced insurance all
[31:49] kinds of things that has to be dealt
[31:50] with so let's just not remember them
[31:54] while the special meetings are going on
[31:56] but it's just pray for them that God
[31:57] will just work it out I believe we'll be
[31:59] able to advance and look forward and you
[32:01] know look at it and then say wow what
[32:04] God did sometimes it's just from here to
[32:07] here and going through all of that that
[32:10] we need one another brother Doug the
[32:13] kind of man he is he apologized to
[32:14] brother my brother Darrell myself and
[32:17] say I'm so sorry this happened you
[32:19] brothers us that what we're glad to be
[32:22] here with you
[32:23] we're glad to be here with you during
[32:26] this time
[32:26] to help carry part of this burden and
[32:29] this load that's what we're for we're
[32:32] the family of God and that right
[32:35] Amen well let's talk about that a little
[32:38] bit tonight
[32:39] Ephesians chapter 3 verse 10 we want to
[32:43] look again tonight at the church to the
[32:48] intent that now unto the principalities
[32:51] and powers in heavenly places
[32:57] Matt be known by the church the manifold
[33:02] wisdom of God according to the eternal
[33:06] purpose which he purposed in Christ
[33:11] Jesus our Lord so if he purposed it in
[33:16] Christ Jesus
[33:17] an eternity that lets me know Jesus is
[33:21] not Jesus Christ is not a created time
[33:27] being he is nothing less than Almighty
[33:32] God verse 20 now unto him that is able
[33:38] to do exceeding abundantly above all
[33:42] that we ask or think according to the
[33:46] power that worketh in us unto Him be
[33:51] glory in the church by Christ Jesus
[33:56] throughout all ages world without end or
[34:02] ages in eternity I hope you understand
[34:06] that that in eternity there will still
[34:10] be these things that will be unfolding
[34:13] and it will be made manifest by the
[34:16] church through Jesus Christ
[34:18] I'd like to be remembered tonight in
[34:20] prayer amen let's bow our heads if you
[34:22] would Heavenly Father we love you so
[34:25] much tonight thank you Lord for bringing

[34:38] or there was really good services
[34:40] brother Wes and brother Joel we thank
[34:42] you for that father thank you for those
[34:44] that were ministered
[34:45] and now we come to another service we're
[34:49] asking you Lord for your help we know
[34:53] Lord Jesus any man that would be
[34:55] physically able would be able to read
[34:57] the word but it takes the presence of
[35:00] God to take the word and make it real to
[35:03] our hearts we believe that we're living
[35:06] in what your prophet turned to be the
[35:08] golden age great things are happening
[35:11] all around us and for that we are
[35:13] grateful Lord Jesus that we can see the
[35:16] light of the hour we pray that you speak
[35:18] to us tonight from your word minister to
[35:21] every heart the hands that were uplifted
[35:23] father be mindful of us tonight we pray
[35:26] in the name of the Lord Jesus amen god
[35:29] bless you Saints I'm sure all of you
[35:33] have heard today that Billy Graham has
[35:34] passed away ninety nine years of age we
[35:38] know that he had a place and in the
[35:41] gospel as far as ministering to a
[35:44] certain category of people probably not
[35:49] another man on the face of the earth
[35:51] that has ever lived in the Apostolic age
[35:54] or will ever live here after that
[35:57] addressed so many people as sparse
[36:00] speaking about Jesus Christ he was
[36:04] personal confidant of course to many
[36:06] u.s. presidents I'm sure most of you
[36:09] probably know even the Queen of England
[36:11] talked to him several times on different
[36:14] things and asks different types of
[36:16] opinions even though it was contrary to
[36:19] her church you know for a man to live
[36:22] the way that he did have the cop of
[36:24] recognition the type of publicity and
[36:27] all that and to be able to live a life
[36:29] that was not involved with women or
[36:31] involved with money involved with all
[36:34] kinds of things to me that's quite a
[36:36] life I said to me that's quite a life
[36:39] and we realized he did not see what we
[36:42] see but we know he was not called to
[36:46] that's right I'm convinced no doubt
[36:49] there would be many many people that
[36:50] will stand there that day and he will be
[36:53] be responsible for leading them as far
[36:56] as he did to me I thank God for a man
[36:59] that's lived that kind of a lie now
[37:02] because of that of course many people
[37:04] today and all have been asking oh my so
[37:07] what's going on he's he's gone does that
[37:10] mean we're in the Tribulation Period
[37:11] because those those two angels are gone
[37:14] hey you know what one of the best
[37:17] reasons you know that you're not in the
[37:19] tribulation period is because I'm still
[37:22] here and if you don't have that
[37:29] revelation for yourself I hope you get
[37:31] it before you leave tonight you're not
[37:33] basing it on me you're not basing it on
[37:35] your mama you're not basing on anybody
[37:37] else you're basing it because you know
[37:40] if there's a rapture I'd be part of that
[37:42] rapture that's right now remember when
[37:45] we're lead dealing with these two angels
[37:48] and all these types that's what they are
[37:49] we get in trouble when we try to take
[37:52] types and make everything excuse me
[37:56] about that time a reality when many
[37:59] times that's all it is is a type Oral
[38:04] Roberts was a type Billy Graham was a
[38:07] time Joseph in the Old Testament was a
[38:10] time Israel in the Old Testament was a
[38:13] time you can only run those types out so
[38:16] far when you try to make every point of
[38:19] a type answer to reality you're going to
[38:22] get into a mess of trouble
[38:24] so follow the types as far as they run
[38:26] and when the type stop stop and you'll
[38:29] be saved but if you go on with that then
[38:32] you get into error over the Donnie law
[38:35] what's all this mean look at all these
[38:37] nines look at all these fours look at
[38:39] all these sevens look trend I'm not a
[38:41] theologian I'm not a very great deep
[38:44] person I'm glad I'm not I'm just able to
[38:47] look at the simplicity of the word and
[38:49] not be tormented in
[38:51] mine because I don't have all the
[38:53] answers to a lot of ability a lot of
[38:55] this stuff that people try to make a
[38:58] bunch of junk out of it
[38:59] now brother branham was here no doubt he
[39:01] could tell us I see or know no profit in
[39:05] this age so therefore you're like me
[39:08] you're just a dummy and the sooner you
[39:11] recognize it the better off you'll be
[39:13] we know that the Word of God is being
[39:16] fulfilled and if we need to know
[39:18] anything about it well it'll already be
[39:20] written or it'll already be said so
[39:23] let's just go right on and live our
[39:25] lives and be ready for the rapture to
[39:28] come is that right now as the people of
[39:32] God we so thank God for all these great
[39:36] things and all the signs and all the
[39:39] symbols that God has given to us in his
[39:41] word but we realize that for the most of
[39:44] us it will not be that that we will mess
[39:47] up on for the most part it will probably
[39:49] not you misunderstanding something about
[39:52] or Roberts life or Billy Graham's life
[39:55] or maybe even a certain significance
[39:57] about brother branham's life that you
[40:00] specifically don't understand
[40:02] it will probably none of that that will
[40:04] get most of us in trouble
[40:06] it'll probably none of those things that
[40:09] will cause most of our greatest
[40:11] disobedience most of ours will be who
[40:14] ourself
[40:15] it will not be us misunderstand I
[40:17] understand something of that Billy
[40:19] Graham or all Roberts and what about
[40:21] this great man's position or that one in
[40:23] that mountain most of it ain't gonna be
[40:25] none of that it will be your own
[40:27] shortcoming in your day-to-day walk with
[40:30] God and to me that's where the
[40:32] significance should really lie do we not
[40:34] give hair in it hidden adherence rather
[40:37] to those things which are round a
[40:39] science and earthquakes and all those
[40:40] things that are happening absolutely but
[40:42] in all reality which one of those
[40:45] earthquakes has ever caused you to sin
[40:48] which one of the understandings or
[40:51] misunderstandings of the seven thunders
[40:53] has caused you to lust or to lie or to
[40:57] doubt
[40:59] hello am i speaking in a foreign
[41:02] language tonight now you know that that
[41:05] is the truth
[41:06] so which misunderstanding about the Son
[41:08] of Man or about sunset or Sabino Canyon
[41:11] or any of those things has ever caused
[41:14] you to fall short of the glory of God
[41:18] case you see why Satan wants us to
[41:21] emphasize that and not emphasize what we
[41:23] really need to emphasize praise the Lord
[41:28] now let's read this and God hiding
[41:31] himself in simplicity brother Andrew
[41:32] whoever sent me this quote about a week
[41:34] or so ago and I thought it was so good
[41:36] the church is Christ's body it's our
[41:40] individual amongst other individuals
[41:44] that is born in the kingdom of God that
[41:47] comes from the inside out and it's
[41:52] automatically lived a man the church is
[41:58] Christ's body it's an individual amongst
[42:01] other individuals that is born in the
[42:04] kingdom of God that comes from the
[42:06] inside out it's automatically live now
[42:10] as Israel in the Old Testament was the
[42:14] judgment are avenues by which God's
[42:17] judgment would be administered to other
[42:20] nations so is the church the New
[42:23] Testament church in the New Testament
[42:25] itself many of the tribes that are
[42:28] actually mentioned in the Old Testament
[42:30] many of the nationalities and many of
[42:33] the peoples of the Old Testament would
[42:36] only even be found and given a place in
[42:39] history by their relation to the chosen
[42:43] people of God either in a positive sense
[42:47] or a negative sense
[42:49] the only reason some people's name is
[42:52] even written in the Bible is because of
[42:55] something they did for or something they
[42:58] did against the chosen people of God now
[43:02] it's the same way in the New Testament
[43:04] that you find many people they would
[43:07] have no recognized
[43:08] sent by God himself because they're not
[43:11] recognizable attributes so the only way
[43:15] that they would actually their name even
[43:17] be found written in the Canon of
[43:18] Scripture is because they positively
[43:21] stood with the people of God or they
[43:23] negatively stood against the people of
[43:25] God may I belong to say a lot of those
[43:28] have been around this message and have
[43:30] left it and they have their limelight
[43:32] they have their time of Fame and
[43:35] popularity and publicity and the only
[43:38] way they would have ever even been known
[43:41] is because of their opposition to the
[43:44] message of the hour they would have
[43:47] never been known by nobody had it not
[43:50] been for this word so whether they want
[43:52] to acknowledge it or not their claim to
[43:54] fame is new right back again to the very
[43:57] message they hate how did Balaam get a
[44:01] place of notoriety because of standing
[44:05] against the people of God how did Noah
[44:07] how did a man how did many of those
[44:09] people in the Old Testament even find if
[44:13] it was one verse or several in the
[44:15] scripture it was because of their
[44:17] allegiance or their standing against the
[44:20] people of God then therefore God use the
[44:23] children of Israel as a measuring rod by
[44:26] which the judgment of God or the mercy
[44:29] of God would be meted out to these
[44:32] people look at Abimelech how do we find
[44:34] the Bimala finding his name written in
[44:36] the book of Genesis because of the way
[44:39] hallelujah because of the way that he
[44:43] treated Abraham or because of the way
[44:46] that his son treatise Isaac he would
[44:48] have not even been found hey in the Word
[44:51] of God I did not been for his
[44:53] association with the elect of God and
[44:57] because of that we understand this is
[44:59] why God places such emphasis on the body
[45:03] the mystical body which the New
[45:05] Testament terms is so much and calls it
[45:07] the church now notice this in first
[45:09] Timothy chapter 3 verse 14 these things
[45:12] write I unto thee hoping to come unto
[45:15] they shorten now watch this principle as
[45:17] we go into it how that God solidified
[45:20] the foundation of the church but what's
[45:22] the church itself is they columns of
[45:25] support of the truth not the other way
[45:28] around but if I tarry long that thou
[45:31] mayest know how thou oughtest to behave
[45:33] thyself in the house of God now at first
[45:37] looking at this one would think that
[45:39] Paul is giving them church order and how
[45:42] when they come into the church house how
[45:45] they ought to do now don't talk and
[45:47] don't run around and don't do this and
[45:49] that in the other that's not what Paul
[45:51] is addressing at all now notice this how
[45:53] it goes on and he says how thou oughtest
[45:55] to behave thyself in the house of God
[45:59] which is the Church of the Living God
[46:02] the pillar and ground of the truth now
[46:05] the house of God then is associated and
[46:09] identified as a building or as a
[46:12] tabernacle in a more permanent structure
[46:15] than the truth ever had in the Old
[46:18] Testament the truth of course was never
[46:20] actually embodied in the temple the
[46:23] truth was never actually fully embodied
[46:27] in the tabernacle it was only fully in
[46:30] came full embodiment when the Lord Jesus
[46:31] came upon the earth so you never find
[46:35] even though the Ten Commandments was
[46:36] laying on the Ark of the Covenant but
[46:38] yet the truth that was not all the truth
[46:40] and the truth never became embodied in
[46:43] the walls and the stone and the gold and
[46:45] the silver and the chapters and all
[46:47] those things it was never there because
[46:49] God never allocated his word to be made
[46:52] stone God wanted his word to be made
[46:55] flesh now what's Paul is going to give
[46:58] to us a very great perspective of the
[47:01] New Testament church and what a place
[47:03] said it helped a revelation of remember
[47:05] Paul himself identifies that he was one
[47:08] of the few in the New Testament about
[47:10] what's God had committed the mystery of
[47:13] the understanding of the body of Christ
[47:16] now it wasn't true the great mystery
[47:18] Peter struggle with it James struggle
[47:20] with it Peter even wrote about Paul and
[47:21] said he writes things it's really hard
[47:23] to be understood because God committed
[47:25] to Paul's understanding
[47:27] an understanding not only the Old
[47:29] Testament sacrifices the blood of the
[47:30] Lamb and all of that but a real
[47:32] perception of the New Testament bride
[47:34] how that that bride was to be the
[47:37] embodiment of the Godhead and that in
[47:39] that embodiment on the earth would be
[47:42] the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is
[47:44] deity then that church would become the
[47:47] very representation of God on the earth
[47:49] it would actually be the judgment seat
[47:52] of God how you would deal with that
[47:54] judgment seat would determine your
[47:56] eternal destination oh ma
[47:59] now what's this how that Paul brings us
[48:02] and alludes to something that the
[48:04] Hebrews of course would be able to
[48:06] identify with and that was paralleling
[48:08] it to the house of God or a temple by
[48:11] which they were going to to worship no
[48:14] he said if I Terry long that you may
[48:16] know how that thou oughtest to behave
[48:18] thyself in the house of God that is the
[48:21] church so it's it's an allusion to an
[48:24] edifice as it was called an edifice or a
[48:27] tabernacle or a place by which believers
[48:31] would come into and worship how thou may
[48:34] behaved ourselves on the house of God it
[48:37] is a spiritual house built up of lively
[48:40] stones now instead of the Old Testament
[48:41] courts that take Rock and they chisel it
[48:44] and chisel it and shills and bring it
[48:45] together but Paul is running a parallel
[48:47] to the Old Testament temple and how that
[48:50] God is now by the baptism of the Holy
[48:52] Ghost
[48:53] taking stones which is confessions and
[48:55] we confess that he is our Savior he is
[48:57] our Redeemer and that is a confession
[48:59] but the prophecy that is only confession
[49:02] that's as far as it goes what good does
[49:04] it do if you just pile up rocks so if we
[49:07] bring this he's my Savior well that's a
[49:09] rock he's my Savior that's another rock
[49:12] he's my Savior that's another rock but
[49:14] the Prophet said we don't just need to
[49:16] pile up a bunch of stones but we need
[49:18] stonemasons that'll take them stones and
[49:21] cut them and shape them and fit him into
[49:23] the house of God now look friends as
[49:26] much as you listen to the tapes and you
[49:28] ought to do it shame on you if you don't
[49:30] and is
[49:30] you read your Bible you still cannot
[49:33] shape yourself because you are not
[49:35] gifted and one of the fivefold gifts
[49:37] unless you're called to preach to be
[49:39] able to take that word and shape
[49:41] yourself into the body of God this is
[49:43] why God allocates and always has for
[49:46] 2,000 years under the apostolic
[49:48] dispensation gifts that would come and
[49:50] take the word and take the confession of
[49:52] men women boys and girls and be able to
[49:55] shape their lives by the gospel and able
[49:58] to positional help them find their place
[50:00] in the economy of God in that then it
[50:03] would be identified as a house of God
[50:06] being built up with lively stones under
[50:09] the Lord now we are built of course upon
[50:11] the foundation which is Jesus Christ
[50:13] himself and Jesus place many folds in
[50:16] this he is the foundation is also the
[50:18] door and is also the capstone to the
[50:20] entire building but yet the truths
[50:22] itself to what Paul is wanting to convey
[50:25] here to the believers is that they
[50:26] themselves are now the household or the
[50:29] economy of God that in them all together
[50:32] being baptized into the body of Christ
[50:34] they become the very mystical body of
[50:37] God and they're actually called the
[50:39] family I Amen the family of God and
[50:41] they're called by the name of Jesus
[50:43] Christ is that right now it's called the
[50:46] house of God it is called his house
[50:48] because it is him that is doing the
[50:50] building and as with any house when you
[50:53] live in that house that is temporary you
[50:56] know how it is in our house if we may
[50:58] try to beoh make them as you know as
[51:00] much maintenance-free as we can and we
[51:02] try to go with all brick and all
[51:04] paintable this and that in the other to
[51:06] minimize that work but if you live in it
[51:08] long enough and it's out on the elements
[51:10] or things you're gonna have to do you're
[51:11] got to paint every now and then and you
[51:13] know kind of giving it up lit it's the
[51:15] same way with the body of Christ how
[51:18] there because of out on the elements of
[51:20] Laodicea that our flesh and our spirit
[51:23] gets wore down and wore out and
[51:25] sometimes they have to be sanded off a
[51:27] little bit and we've got to have a new
[51:29] coat of paint not around your eyes now
[51:31] we got to be painted a little bit
[51:33] and then we've got to be kind of spiffed
[51:35] up a little our experience needs to be
[51:37] renewed and renovated why because this
[51:41] is a building of God and the Holy Ghost
[51:43] lives inside this Shimon temple so like
[51:47] on occasion the house needs to be
[51:49] repaired
[51:50] on occasion the house will need a
[51:52] restoration of experience of where you
[51:54] become renewed in the presence of God is
[51:57] there right now what's this how that
[51:59] Paul goes on to say that the house of
[52:02] God is the Church of the Living God so
[52:05] the house of God the edifice or the
[52:08] temple of God which is now being built
[52:09] upon the earth remember Timothy was this
[52:11] written around 62 or 63 ad something
[52:14] like that not just a couple of years
[52:15] before Paul is going to be killed so
[52:17] Paul is really opening up now part of
[52:19] the mystery of God and I want you to
[52:21] notice who is selling it to it's coming
[52:23] from a profit to a pasture so Paul is
[52:27] giving this writing to this other man of
[52:29] God and knowing that this man of God is
[52:32] gifted as well now other people will
[52:35] read this from Timothy of course in the
[52:37] hell for thousands of years but yet this
[52:39] man being gifted whenever he would hear
[52:41] it it would illuminate something to him
[52:44] about the body you imagine when Ibrahim
[52:46] is first time and he sat down and he
[52:49] began to read that all my the
[52:50] illumination that struck his heart I
[52:52] wonder how many times he read the same
[52:55] letter over and over again and yet God
[52:57] but make this more real to him and that
[52:59] more real to him that that he does us
[53:01] the same way don't know he says that the
[53:05] body that the house of God is actually
[53:08] the Church of the Living God now is
[53:10] actually contrasting in opposition to
[53:12] what was going on in the heathen Gentile
[53:14] world and that was that they would come
[53:17] to a temple they would come to a place
[53:19] in there they would worship and they
[53:21] would bring to these gods depending on
[53:23] which one it was many of them of course
[53:25] offered human sacrifice some of them
[53:27] would offer their children or virgin
[53:28] daughters they would offer go they would
[53:30] offer silver that offer all kinds of
[53:32] things and they would kneel down and
[53:34] they would pray this is of course
[53:35] Christianity versus idolatry 1961 and
[53:37] you'd find that get down and they bring
[53:39] a meat offering or something and they
[53:41] would get down there begin to pray and
[53:43] they
[53:43] like this image in front of them was not
[53:45] this god so much but an image about
[53:47] which this spirit would get inside of
[53:49] this God and as they would begin to pray
[53:52] and pray and they break into a trance
[53:54] and then lose the first consciousness
[53:56] and of course it was demons and those
[53:58] demons would come and get ahold to these
[54:00] people and they would actually some of
[54:01] them have out-of-body experiences they
[54:04] would convulse they would shake and jerk
[54:07] and have all kinds of emotional types of
[54:09] things
[54:09] and notice how Satan now impersonated
[54:12] the new verse by something that was so
[54:15] close oh my listen to the knell so Paul
[54:18] said no you don't have to do that you
[54:20] don't need to come and convulse and not
[54:22] saying that you don't get emotional now
[54:24] I think about what you want to become is
[54:26] you want to be the actual house of God
[54:29] itself now you're gonna have churches
[54:32] remember there was hardly any churches
[54:34] at all by the time this was written and
[54:36] what churches they were they were
[54:38] probably gathering in homes and in
[54:40] storefronts or whomever we looked at in
[54:41] the book of Acts with Nepal together
[54:43] there in the one place and the God let
[54:45] him come in as far as having a church
[54:47] like this a little bit almost unheard of
[54:49] have been one here and one down a
[54:51] brother bills and one dinette by the
[54:52] Richard Wilson's and one above the
[54:54] Thames and you know it was absolutely
[54:56] unheard of in this timeframe so they did
[55:00] not have in their mind when they read
[55:02] this about the church they did not have
[55:04] these four laws in their mind because
[55:07] they did not have a church but they was
[55:10] the church although they didn't have a
[55:13] church now we've got a church but are we
[55:16] the church if we're not careful we'll
[55:19] put more emphasis on the church than
[55:21] being the church oh ma it's important to
[55:26] come to the house of God behave yourself
[55:28] is it not why most of you brothers have
[55:31] never walk in that door back there with
[55:33] a head on your head if you did you'd
[55:35] feel so embarrassed and so ashamed and
[55:37] so humiliate you'd never think about
[55:40] stopping a Dairy Queen and bring it in
[55:42] on an ice cream or a sandwich and
[55:44] sending earring there's no way you'd do
[55:46] that there's no way as much as you love
[55:48] coffee or your drink whatever more that
[55:51] you'd ever think of bringing than your
[55:52] incentive
[55:53] and drinking a coffee while I'm
[55:55] preaching the Word of God you'd consider
[55:57] that to be so disrespectful and I agree
[56:00] with you a hundred percent but what
[56:02] about the same respect to the real house
[56:04] of God and the real house of God is just
[56:07] not your body but it may be that brother
[56:10] and sister that you don't get along with
[56:11] soil now God has brought to life the
[56:21] temple when Solomon completed this great
[56:25] building in the Old Testament God
[56:28] Himself come into this house with smoke
[56:32] and glory and Shekinah light but the
[56:36] building itself is just as dead after
[56:38] God come in as before God come in it did
[56:43] nothing to the building itself when God
[56:47] comes in your building
[56:49] he not only quickens your soul he
[56:52] quickens your mortal body into obedience
[56:54] to the word please be to God
[57:00] notice this now Paul says that you may
[57:02] know how that you ought to behave
[57:03] yourself in the house of God which is
[57:06] the Church of the Living God the pillar
[57:10] and ground of truth now what you listen
[57:13] now don't let this stumble you the truth
[57:17] is not the pillar and the ground the
[57:24] church is I figured I'd get that
[57:28] response we are built upon truth this
[57:38] Bible these tapes these books cannot
[57:43] promote their self
[57:49] reservoir it was not the Bible that kept
[57:53] the Bible alive it was people who did it
[57:59] because it was not even necessarily
[58:04] printing presses it was people with a
[58:07] burden when the Bible was outlawed who
[58:11] was it that was the pillar and ground
[58:13] out the truth
[58:14] it was not the Bible the Bible didn't
[58:19] print the Bible the Bible did not risk
[58:22] his life because the Bible does not have
[58:24] life listen now the Bible is the word
[58:29] that it takes the Holy Ghost to quicken
[58:32] that word and make it live in the days
[58:34] of Luther when they begin to print the
[58:36] Bible it was not the Bible with a hand
[58:39] on the side ever cranking out another
[58:41] copy of itself the Bible was not going
[58:44] into the printing press the Bible did
[58:46] not load donkeys down with itself and
[58:48] the Bible lead the donkey with the Bible
[58:51] and the bag and the Bible handed out the
[58:53] Bible who was it it was those that were
[58:58] a part of the Church of the Living God
[59:00] because the church the church is the
[59:05] Grands and the teller of truth the
[59:15] church is the support work of truth
[59:21] well I'm gonna preach it with or without
[59:23] you oh you say bless God these tapes are
[59:27] live without the bride that shows how
[59:29] wrong you are that shows your
[59:31] understanding is a normative Antichrist
[59:33] spirit now if you preach that the tapes
[59:36] live of their self the Bible lives that
[59:38] itself the tapes built himself the Bible
[59:40] promotes herself you're contrary to the
[59:42] Word of God it is the Church of the
[59:45] Living God that preaches the truth to
[59:48] her it is the Church of the Living God
[59:52] that preserves the truth it is the
[59:56] Church of the Living God hallelujah that
[59:59] has the ability of spiritual
[1:00:01] multiplication what is it that's kept
[1:00:04] the truth alive the church what is it
[1:00:07] that keeps the truths growing to this
[1:00:08] day that's Hertz would it be much easier
[1:00:16] and much safer we'll just by 300 seats
[1:00:21] the Africa then delecia
[1:00:25] to China to France we'll buy tickets and
[1:00:31] we'll ticket them under a Tate name
[1:00:34] we'll buy one seat we'll call 2/3 Exodus
[1:00:38] another seat we'll call it gives Jesus
[1:00:40] Christ
[1:00:41] that's the name we'll put on the ticket
[1:00:43] will fill the entire plane with tapes
[1:00:49] and then when we get the plane wherever
[1:00:53] it's going
[1:00:54] what will happen then unless somebody
[1:00:58] comes on that plane and gets them tapes
[1:01:02] and there's something lesson the plane
[1:01:05] and the tapes both will set right there
[1:01:07] and rot come on church why cause in
[1:01:12] tapes ain't got no feets them tights
[1:01:17] ain't got no hands all come on at you
[1:01:20] what I'm talking about sign with your
[1:01:22] buyer but if we
[1:01:23] Silvan airplane up with bibles and we
[1:01:26] send over to indonesia wherever more
[1:01:28] unless some more will come on that
[1:01:30] brother there and open that door one say
[1:01:32] give me one give me one give me one I'm
[1:01:34] gonna take it out why because the
[1:01:36] support of the Word of God instead
[1:01:39] Church of the Living God
[1:01:40] it is not tape players it is not the
[1:01:44] internet it is not a microphone it is
[1:01:47] not a mechanical station of man it is
[1:01:49] the body of Jesus Christ it is you and
[1:01:53] you and you young people and you and you
[1:01:56] [Applause]
[1:02:02] the church preaches it the church
[1:02:08] preserves it the challenge transmits it
[1:02:15] from generation to generation
[1:02:23] notice in first Kings chapter 7 verse 21
[1:02:28] Solomon is now in the building process
[1:02:30] of the house of God of the Old Testament
[1:02:33] the temple he set up the pillars in the
[1:02:37] porch of the temple and he set up the
[1:02:41] right pillar and called the name thereof
[1:02:45] yah him yah
[1:02:49] yo Keem je ya Yahweh yah him and he set
[1:02:57] up the left pillar and he called the
[1:03:00] name thereof
[1:03:01] Boaz so here are the structural supports
[1:03:07] of the house of God and they give them
[1:03:13] to men's names
[1:03:16] amen Boaz of course means sweetness or
[1:03:20] swiftly yo Keem is the twenty-first
[1:03:24] order of the Levitical priest under the
[1:03:29] reign of David also the 4th son of
[1:03:33] simeon so here he
[1:03:36] takes human names animal that is going
[1:03:41] to be the support of the entrance to the
[1:03:44] house of God why not call it Gabriel why
[1:03:48] not call it Michael one I'll color
[1:03:50] wormwood while I call it Mars or Jupiter
[1:03:52] these were great men in the building of
[1:03:56] the body of the Old Testament so they
[1:03:59] embody hallelujah the support and give
[1:04:03] them what not angelic names not divine
[1:04:06] names but names of men July can you're
[1:04:14] really gonna like this next on then
[1:04:16] Revelation chapter 3 verse 12 him that
[1:04:20] overcometh will i make a pillar and the
[1:04:25] temple of my god I'll make a pillar in
[1:04:34] the temple of my god don't you see what
[1:04:37] the overcomers are doing they are now
[1:04:39] pillars in the temple oh you are only
[1:04:43] reflecting in a minor way what you're
[1:04:46] going to after a while that's roots that
[1:04:49] you stand for who has it that will cause
[1:04:52] holiness to still be stood for in this
[1:04:54] hour the Church of the Living God who
[1:04:57] liveth in water baptism of the dáil in
[1:05:00] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:05:02] Church of the Living God who will defend
[1:05:05] marriage between one man and one woman
[1:05:07] the Church of the Living God will we
[1:05:10] convert everybody absolutely not it's
[1:05:13] not our place to convert innovati it's
[1:05:15] our place to stir
[1:05:18] and supply that's well brother don't
[1:05:30] you'll have less and less friends and
[1:05:32] people who like you'd lesson lesson
[1:05:33] it'll be more dangerous and all that I
[1:05:34] understand all of that but when he comes
[1:05:38] I'll still be like this people getting
[1:05:45] away from and they got nothing doing my
[1:05:47] position I'm a pillar let people do
[1:05:51] whatever they want to that has nothing
[1:05:52] to do with me him that overcometh will I
[1:06:01] make
[1:06:02] a pillar in the temple of my god
[1:06:07] in this amazing there is no temple in
[1:06:12] the new city you know the Bible says
[1:06:19] that John said I looked around and there
[1:06:21] was no temple but the Lord God and the
[1:06:25] lamb so here you are here you are
[1:06:34] identified you are the underlayment
[1:06:36] you're the one who bears the reproach
[1:06:38] and the weight all the weight of the
[1:06:41] word of being identified all we could
[1:06:43] have some out and not say this is don't
[1:06:45] preach on these things no more and
[1:06:47] nobody will know and we won't get in
[1:06:49] trouble that ain't what we'll call for
[1:06:50] he didn't call a piece of macaroni
[1:06:53] he calls sons and daughters of God to be
[1:06:56] pillars brother macaronis alright if
[1:06:59] you're making lasagna but if you're
[1:07:01] building a house of God you wanna rock
[1:07:03] you know piece of lasagna so you are
[1:07:11] actually part of the embodiment of the
[1:07:16] mystery of God in the eighth day I will
[1:07:22] make you part of who I am you held me up
[1:07:27] on the earth you was laughed at
[1:07:30] ridiculed I saw on the science of time
[1:07:33] or shifting I saw in things everywhere
[1:07:35] was going backwards you stood right
[1:07:37] there you never wavered you never
[1:07:40] stutter you never compromised you should
[1:07:45] come on come on I'll make you a pillar
[1:07:56] this thing just to preachers either this
[1:07:59] is to him and her that overcomes him
[1:08:06] that overcometh all i make a pillar of
[1:08:12] my god and he shall go no more out and i
[1:08:18] will write upon him the name of my god
[1:08:25] it won't be Hakeem or go as but a pillar
[1:08:31] has to be named over the God don't you
[1:08:37] say you get the name of the city the
[1:08:39] name of the king
[1:08:42] I will write upon him the name of my god
[1:08:49] and the name of the city of my god which
[1:08:52] is New Jerusalem
[1:08:54] what's cometh down out of heaven from my
[1:08:58] god and I will ride upon him my new name
[1:09:08] friends the church are here don't get
[1:09:12] this now think of how many churches in
[1:09:16] all and Asiya
[1:09:17] that are supporting the standard of
[1:09:20] holiness from the Bible even many of us
[1:09:24] had come from the Pentecostal background
[1:09:25] we go back to those that we world you
[1:09:27] with years ago which they lord have
[1:09:29] mercy how they compromise how they fall
[1:09:31] in a life of what a little bit of truths
[1:09:33] I have so they're no longer supporting
[1:09:36] or substantiating it oh well you know I
[1:09:39] maybe we're just too legalistic maybe
[1:09:41] you don't matter about the women cutting
[1:09:43] their hand wearing lipstick and all that
[1:09:44] maybe it made that birdie don't matter
[1:09:46] no more I draw the Bible don't say that
[1:09:47] lifts it I agree it doesn't I've never
[1:09:54] found a scripture in the Bible which
[1:09:55] says wrong for you to lay with your
[1:09:57] daughter any you knuckleheads try that
[1:10:03] you're gonna get a knuckle sandwich I
[1:10:06] know all kinds of things that the Bible
[1:10:08] does not directly say but the Bible
[1:10:11] speaks it may not call lipstick it may
[1:10:14] not call Winston cigarettes it may not
[1:10:16] call Jim Beam but there is a character
[1:10:19] and nature of God that prohibits us from
[1:10:22] going contrary to God's nature I
[1:10:25] personally don't need a scripture that
[1:10:27] says it's wrong to smoke cigarettes
[1:10:28] cause my Bible tells me God will destroy
[1:10:31] him that defiles a temple of God
[1:10:33] [Applause]
[1:10:36] well praise the Lord
[1:10:39] [Applause]
[1:10:40] so if the time goes on
[1:10:43] will the the stability of truce and
[1:10:46] water baptism will it matter anymore if
[1:10:49] it's in the name of the Lord Jesus let's
[1:10:51] just look around our message if we have
[1:10:53] another 10 years added to the lord have
[1:10:55] mercy what's it going to be even around
[1:10:56] our own ranks who's going to hold up the
[1:10:59] standard of holiness me for one am I
[1:11:03] gonna send with him
[1:11:04] what about tinsel in the name of the
[1:11:06] Lord Jesus new birth baptism of the Holy
[1:11:09] Ghost not just believing God sent a
[1:11:10] prophet who's gonna hold up
[1:11:17] predestination before the foundation of
[1:11:19] the world who's going to hold up there's
[1:11:22] a difference between the bride and the
[1:11:23] church we are so what are we doing we
[1:11:28] are the columns under these truths God
[1:11:32] sent His Prophet to bring the truths
[1:11:34] right we couldn't support him other down
[1:11:37] until God sent a prophet to bring it now
[1:11:39] they've been brought and the emphasis
[1:11:41] has changed Oh y'all trying to take by
[1:11:46] the rent price absolutely not nobody
[1:11:48] will ever take his place he was the one
[1:11:50] to bring them or the one to supportable
[1:11:55] to God notice the word pillar means a
[1:12:00] column such as by which a building is
[1:12:03] supported a firm prop or support and the
[1:12:09] prop under truths is the church
[1:12:15] but you said always thought that the
[1:12:18] truth held up the church you're
[1:12:21] partially right but you need to get out
[1:12:24] of the ground you see the truth is
[1:12:28] foundation and the column is said on top
[1:12:31] of foundation and then on top of the
[1:12:34] column comes a reveal word for the hour
[1:12:36] what is it logos men day of the day and
[1:12:40] then we have the Rendell side of the
[1:12:42] word which comes and quickens that which
[1:12:44] is needful for the time we're living
[1:12:46] there so our foundation is the
[1:12:48] revelation of Jesus Christ built upon
[1:12:51] the principles of His divine person then
[1:12:54] he establishes the column on top of the
[1:12:57] foundation then he reveals the message
[1:13:00] of the day and puts that on top of the
[1:13:04] column and then he says now tackle the
[1:13:07] devil it's built on me
[1:13:10] I built he'll know me and I set me on
[1:13:13] top of her you're in a good place your
[1:13:15] sandwich is right between the word a
[1:13:23] couple of years ago brother Fred Mullins
[1:13:26] and his son brother Fred jr. was here
[1:13:27] we're standing right outside my office
[1:13:29] out there and somebody took a picture of
[1:13:31] me and then where's all laughing y'all
[1:13:33] probably maybe seen the picture but it's
[1:13:35] me and Fred jr. and Fred senior what
[1:13:37] were laughing about is I called us an
[1:13:39] Oreo dark white and dark but we made one
[1:13:45] good sandwich now don't you understand
[1:13:48] here's a revelation of the Lord then God
[1:13:51] didn't write a tape God didn't even lay
[1:13:55] the Bible the God like columns support
[1:13:59] work on this rock I will build my
[1:14:11] that's why any ministry that tries to
[1:14:14] work away from and apart from the church
[1:14:19] is Antichrist in principle case you see
[1:14:24] why this is first in our generation
[1:14:25] radio preachers TV preachers internet
[1:14:28] preachers that don't need no church same
[1:14:32] things coming right inside the message -
[1:14:35] well hallelujah I'm sorry friend aw no
[1:14:40] sorry that that is not apostolic it's
[1:14:43] contrary to the foundation the original
[1:14:45] sure I don't need the church we're all
[1:14:47] men if you don't need the church or an O
[1:14:50] Christ these pillars and the days of
[1:15:06] Caligula these pillars and the days of
[1:15:11] Demetrius in the days of Nero when they
[1:15:17] didn't even have a written Bible many of
[1:15:21] that first century Christians in the
[1:15:22] first generation live their entire life
[1:15:25] as a child of God and never even saw one
[1:15:27] book of the New Testament
[1:15:32] then purchase preached for nearly 30
[1:15:35] years without a new Testament what did
[1:15:42] they preach the truth look friend it may
[1:15:50] come to a spot we have to remove our
[1:15:52] services from the internet the pressure
[1:15:55] make it so great on us before we leave
[1:15:57] here we may have to shut down a lot of
[1:15:59] avenues and outlets they may come in and
[1:16:03] take our books and tapes they may want
[1:16:06] our Bibles who knows exactly what it'll
[1:16:08] be but it won't stop us at all we'll go
[1:16:12] back to sending out CDs will meet in
[1:16:14] basements over here this Sunday we're
[1:16:15] making yours and next Sunday we'll meet
[1:16:17] over there next Sunday we'll meet and
[1:16:18] wrong Mountain Wednesday night we'll
[1:16:20] meet somewhere else they ain't stopping
[1:16:21] us from having Church why because we are
[1:16:25] the support of this word although and
[1:16:27] the difficult to guess brother Donny we
[1:16:29] should hide hide nothing if there was
[1:16:31] ever a time that we need to come out and
[1:16:33] let people know there is any truth in
[1:16:35] this land it is I I'm not talking about
[1:16:38] being foolish I'm not talking about
[1:16:39] looking to be martyrdom I'm talking
[1:16:41] about when the Holy Ghost gives you that
[1:16:43] unction stam brother what sustained it
[1:16:52] and the time the persecution when Nero
[1:16:56] so he did the Christians that he would
[1:16:57] wind them up and tar and rat calls
[1:16:59] around them and line his garden paths
[1:17:02] and set them on fire at nighttime so he
[1:17:06] could walk to his garden with their
[1:17:07] flesh burning off their bodies stench of
[1:17:12] human flesh rising through the streets
[1:17:14] of Rome what was it they kept it from
[1:17:17] falling wirless the columns was that a
[1:17:20] Bible was it a commentary was that a
[1:17:23] radio preacher was it a singing
[1:17:25] convention it was the true Church of the
[1:17:28] Living God
[1:17:29] you couldn't burn it out of him you
[1:17:31] can't drown that out of him
[1:17:33] you can't throw him in prison deep
[1:17:34] enough ha their city is calling out
[1:17:39] their destiny in time they are look
[1:17:42] friends if people on this earth are
[1:17:44] living like Hale there ought to be some
[1:17:46] people on the earth living life effort
[1:17:49] I'm talking about you just flying around
[1:17:52] through the clouds this is what I'm
[1:17:54] talking about if you are heavenly you
[1:17:56] will have a desire to support the truth
[1:17:58] now the truth except jesus knew how to
[1:18:20] build a church he didn't build it on
[1:18:28] purchase he didn't build it on paying
[1:18:32] ties he said on this rock revelation of
[1:18:35] who he is I will build my church and the
[1:18:37] gates of Hell will not prevail against
[1:18:40] it the salt said would have come against
[1:18:44] the Church of the Living God had it been
[1:18:46] any other foundation other than the true
[1:18:48] church it would have tumbled into ruin
[1:18:50] decades ago it would have troubled into
[1:18:53] decay and rottenness and the devil
[1:18:54] thought he had done it to the dark ages
[1:18:57] but God started in a Reformation what
[1:19:00] was it one man understood a revelation
[1:19:03] of the just shall live the face God
[1:19:05] started raising of your team started
[1:19:12] resurrecting again a principle a pillar
[1:19:15] of truth by which the ports or the house
[1:19:17] of God must be raised but you can't
[1:19:20] build no ports on one post you gotta
[1:19:22] have more than one justification made
[1:19:25] way for sanctification sanctification
[1:19:26] made way for the whole ego
[1:19:29] hallelujah the holy ghost made way for
[1:19:32] the holy ghosts himself a very token
[1:19:35] life of God now the full support of the
[1:19:39] entire building is share oh four corners
[1:19:45] just forget safe let's back to the Holy
[1:19:47] Ghost restriction against the token life
[1:19:49] the entire structure can be held up
[1:19:52] under the auspices of this world
[1:19:59] that's why we'll live through these
[1:20:01] storms
[1:20:02] I believe the sign or don't believe the
[1:20:04] signer hiccup the sign or throw up the
[1:20:06] sign do whatever you want to do about it
[1:20:07] the church moves our Oh will destroy
[1:20:10] them you and her house so if this
[1:20:21] message had been committed to tape and
[1:20:25] books where would it be as I said
[1:20:36] several years ago in Tanzania brother
[1:20:38] Daryl's been there took them little
[1:20:42] brothers ebooks at the time and I saw
[1:20:46] brothers who had lived in holes in the
[1:20:49] ground and didn't wear clothes until
[1:20:54] they come to the message
[1:20:57] you tell me the message right you'll put
[1:20:59] the right clothes on me giving them them
[1:21:05] little cheapy book smile remember not
[1:21:07] what they even cost you or the thought
[1:21:09] I'd give them a wedge of cold
[1:21:14] go out among the must sign go out among
[1:21:17] some of them tribesmen that are still
[1:21:19] cannibals and witness this trois at a
[1:21:25] player cannot speak but tape player has
[1:21:30] no legs no hands no eyes look friends
[1:21:34] don't sit around just wait for me to do
[1:21:36] it all all over done great missionary
[1:21:37] work if God lays it on your heart to
[1:21:39] tell somebody about Jesus Christ and
[1:21:41] this word do it or if I'll just give
[1:21:44] them a Bible I'll give them a tract
[1:21:45] sometimes that's a lazy man's way out
[1:21:47] sometimes they need a God with some skin
[1:21:50] on it oh praise be to God I'm not
[1:21:54] encouraging you to get it overhead we
[1:21:56] don't you're talking about but we're not
[1:21:58] careful they get to a place we don't say
[1:21:59] nothing no more mother done and what if
[1:22:02] they're not bribed if they're not bribed
[1:22:03] the Holy Ghost so leads you don't it a
[1:22:05] lot far not Abraham far you'll go a lot
[1:22:09] fine that's as far as you'll feel to go
[1:22:11] but you might win that soul to Christ
[1:22:13] and then come up to the Tribulation
[1:22:15] Period their name will be associated
[1:22:18] with you for eternity
[1:22:27] it is the church's responsibility to
[1:22:31] defend the trust maintain it and fight
[1:22:38] for it if need be
[1:22:43] now this is tough on us because blessed
[1:22:47] are the peacemakers how can you be a
[1:22:50] blessed peacemaker and a blessed war
[1:22:52] monger most people that don't know me
[1:22:59] they don't think I like peace they think
[1:23:02] I like trouble I hate trouble
[1:23:06] I hate being controversial I hate
[1:23:12] getting attention some health centers
[1:23:14] smile on me right now say you don't know
[1:23:15] me but if God has called me to be
[1:23:20] brother Darrell if I'm no more than just
[1:23:21] a little ring on the bottom of the
[1:23:24] pillar if I'm one of them fluted columns
[1:23:26] that began in in Corinth many many many
[1:23:29] many hundreds and hundreds of years ago
[1:23:31] I found no more than a band by the
[1:23:33] west's on the bottom wherever God's
[1:23:34] placed me in the part of this living all
[1:23:37] God hallelujah
[1:23:38] this living world in the end time I want
[1:23:40] to give my support and strength if I'm
[1:23:43] one of them that's got to be hated in
[1:23:45] the spy in order to bear no reproach
[1:23:47] maybe God chose different ones to bear
[1:23:49] more than others if so that is so then
[1:23:52] let me find my part and let me do my
[1:23:54] part how many say Amen with me tonight
[1:23:57] to be a ring in the house of God to be
[1:23:59] if you're no more than a decorative
[1:24:00] piece on the column whatever God wants
[1:24:03] you to be for us to get under that
[1:24:04] column insane right there
[1:24:06] we'll go as Solomon there will stand
[1:24:09] between Laodicea well stand between
[1:24:11] worldliness and we'll post in the
[1:24:13] collapse why because that house will
[1:24:15] come down but we will stand the her
[1:24:18] praise be to God as part of the body of
[1:24:21] the Living God we will stand for purity
[1:24:24] we will stand and say we still need to

[1:24:29] still need revival we still need to pray
[1:24:31] for the signal come on church we still

[1:25:03] here and if I die and go by the way of
[1:25:06] the grave I pray to God God give you
[1:25:08] somebody they'll take the same stand but

[1:29:37] ain't no bow as that ain't no yaki meeee
[1:29:40] no man a God's here to build his own
[1:29:42] kingdom on the earth he's here to give
[1:29:45] his support to the house of God the work
[1:29:48] of God the people of God the stability
[1:29:58] because the stability of the truth on
[1:30:04] the ass is totally the church living God
[1:30:18] it will be so secure from the foundation
[1:30:21] to the columns to the capstone that
[1:30:24] Jesus saw the whole building in visions
[1:30:26] when he said upon this rock I will build
[1:30:29] my church so he saw the columns he saw
[1:30:31] the capstone by the way he saw the whole
[1:30:33] thing and he said the gate said he'll
[1:30:36] not let me tell one thing friends if you
[1:30:40] got a low line building it's you know
[1:30:42] just a real low line thing that ain't
[1:30:44] too much danger of any much shaking
[1:30:46] going on but Jesus has got a great big
[1:30:48] old tall building with Credle big tall
[1:30:51] columns and a great big old tall hit
[1:30:54] office and the bigger it gets the more
[1:30:56] risky it gets but he ain't afraid he
[1:30:59] ain't one bit nervous Jesus don't even
[1:31:02] carry insurance on this building because
[1:31:04] he ain't gonna need it
[1:31:05] hey man we ain't got insurance we gotta
[1:31:08] surance and that assurances on this rock
[1:31:12] I'll build my church it's better than
[1:31:14] state fine it's better than Blue Cross
[1:31:17] and Blue Shield
[1:31:18] it was a Red Cross and a world seal upon
[1:31:24] this rock I'll build my church
[1:31:26] and I commit my truce to these fellers
[1:31:34] [Applause]
[1:31:41] when the storms blow and the earthquake
[1:31:46] shake
[1:31:49] she'll never move now you know right off
[1:31:55] I'm gonna tell Matt her flesh
[1:31:57] I'm telling Matt the god part you see
[1:32:00] this entire thing is built out of God
[1:32:02] parts the foundation god parts the
[1:32:07] pillars God parts the capstone God parts
[1:32:11] but stay preserved on earth unshaken why
[1:32:19] because the columns are preserved
[1:32:23] you see if God don't have a plan to
[1:32:26] preserve the columns than his committal
[1:32:28] of truths to weigh on those columns can
[1:32:33] break him down but he's so convinced
[1:32:41] because in his mind he remembers you
[1:32:47] you see when he wrote the Lamb's Book of
[1:32:50] Life and he put the Lambs name in there
[1:32:54] he spoke and wrote to your name at the
[1:32:59] same time when God slayed the lamb
[1:33:03] before the foundation of the world glory
[1:33:07] to God your sins were forgiven youth in
[1:33:12] all you had to do so right now here in
[1:33:14] time he said till the Holy Spirit would
[1:33:16] call you praise be to God
[1:33:19] but brother Darnell I feel so weak and I
[1:33:22] feel so shaky yeah sure that's the human
[1:33:24] part of you that's not the column Peter
[1:33:28] was not the column not Peter the man
[1:33:32] Peter the see it's not Donny the man
[1:33:38] don't put the Donny you're so strong you
[1:33:46] see me where's my sword God
[1:33:49] you ought to see me at terms you ought
[1:33:53] to see me at times when it's sheathed
[1:33:56] you ought to see me a few weeks ago when
[1:34:00] I was stealing or something couldn't eat
[1:34:03] lost several pounds of weight a lot of
[1:34:08] stuff going on I didn't lose my face no
[1:34:13] no but I felt humanly I hate feeling
[1:34:20] humanly
[1:34:22] as you felt divinely once human but just
[1:34:25] don't cut it no more I knew he would
[1:34:31] move I just knew you would but it didn't
[1:34:35] know how and he was silent I begged him
[1:34:41] for a word I begged him for one word
[1:34:46] just I'd hear a little something in a
[1:34:51] solemn and then I don't my scripture and
[1:34:54] care what's in the care I opened up my
[1:34:56] Bible this morning to look how I was
[1:34:57] going to read and look at what a soul
[1:34:59] praise the Lord praise the Lord but
[1:35:01] that's one more oh I guess I'm no no
[1:35:05] one's ever been that I'm sorry
[1:35:07] [Music]
[1:35:11] praise be to God o you see me goes
[1:35:15] through fights you see me goes through
[1:35:17] such things what a man I love peace I've
[1:35:36] always hated fightin I'm the oldest
[1:35:40] among seven by nature by that position
[1:35:44] I've always been a peacemaker you think
[1:35:48] God I got a sense to you but when I feel
[1:35:55] my Lords truths being challenged
[1:36:03] that's what you say I'm gonna put it
[1:36:09] back in
[1:36:10] I'll walk in there about 15 minutes
[1:36:14] after then don't leave me
[1:36:18] what does Satan I hope it wasn't nothing
[1:36:20] bad but I mean why would you share those
[1:36:29] things of this so you could realize you
[1:36:30] ain't got a God for a pastor you got a
[1:36:32] man so you can realize preachers deacons
[1:36:37] trustee we're human beings and God ain't
[1:36:41] building his church on the flash of
[1:36:43] Donny Reagan of the flesh and or the
[1:36:44] patron they go on and say god never
[1:36:46] built his church on the flesh of william
[1:36:48] branham he built it upon the revelation
[1:36:54] of himself with such confidence that
[1:36:59] they'd say the gates of imagine brother
[1:37:06] Darrell's he looked down through time
[1:37:08] he's selling here oh he's so Caligula he
[1:37:10] saw all that was an empress and so what
[1:37:12] they do he saw the here I stand he saw
[1:37:14] the days of Luther saw it all knew it
[1:37:16] knowing exactly what it I said yeah
[1:37:18] it'll be fine y'all Kim well children
[1:37:44] that angel didn't come of the songbook
[1:37:49] we didn't come with some kind of love
[1:37:51] letter out of Hollywood becoming a book
[1:37:55] in his hand
[1:37:55] and it wasn't the big book of life it
[1:37:58] was the little lamb's book of Thoth
[1:38:01] what's he calling pillars pillars praise
[1:38:06] God praise don't you love it aren't you
[1:38:12] glad you're part of the church the
[1:38:17] Church of the Living God let's bow our
[1:38:22] heads together thank you Lord Jesus Oh
[1:38:30] father it's almost more than our minds
[1:38:35] can comprehend you building such a
[1:38:40] spiritual edifice such a great majestic
[1:38:45] building such a thing that the angels of
[1:38:50] God desire to look into that the Angels
[1:38:54] stooped down and look was bewilderment
[1:38:58] and they wonder oh it wouldn't have been
[1:39:04] no great thing if you had a built or
[1:39:05] Church on Gabriel wormwood Michael
[1:39:09] they've never had a fault never even had
[1:39:11] a bad thought in their minds
[1:39:15] praise God but you chose to take men
[1:39:20] that were converted truly gonna hurt
[1:39:25] women that maybe was so full of the
[1:39:27] devil but Mary Magdalene men that used
[1:39:32] to be so sorry and rotten they'd spend
[1:39:35] their babies milk money to buy moonshine
[1:39:37] or whiskey or shoot up a dope but you
[1:39:41] saved them and filled them with the holy
[1:39:42] ghost and you gave them a portion of
[1:39:46] that truth and it's burning in their
[1:39:47] heart they can't preach they may not be
[1:39:51] able to already handle the word as far
[1:39:52] as doctrinally but they gotta tell
[1:39:54] somebody how the fire got lit they have
[1:39:57] a little deposit
[1:39:59] of truths on their shoulders Oh Lord
[1:40:04] Jesus help us I pray at our church we
[1:40:07] will never compromise I realize Lord God
[1:40:12] it's a scary thing when us as mortals
[1:40:15] come under opposition in our minds we
[1:40:19] wonder and we think what will happen
[1:40:21] which way will it call Lord Jesus it's
[1:40:26] not built upon our flesh and for that we
[1:40:29] are so thankful if it had been built on
[1:40:32] the flesh of the Apostles hitter never
[1:40:34] made it to Pentecost but it was built
[1:40:37] upon your promise
[1:40:39] praise God it looked like it was totally
[1:40:43] lost in Catholicism for the hundreds of
[1:40:47] years of dark ages but you didn't send
[1:40:51] out a new translation of the Bible you
[1:40:54] didn't send out a commentary but you got
[1:40:58] a hold of a man praise God all they had
[1:41:03] fanaticism how they went off and they
[1:41:05] had to have a counter-revolution to
[1:41:07] balance up what they started same in the
[1:41:09] days of Wesley but yet the full truths
[1:41:12] had not been restored yet then Lord God
[1:41:16] you got a hold of a little Kentuckian
[1:41:18] for his to be to God when you started
[1:41:22] restoring these truths that have been
[1:41:24] lost down through the ages once you took
[1:41:28] him from the earth then men around him
[1:41:30] start saying I'm the man I'm Elijah I'm
[1:41:33] Joshua
[1:41:34] I'm the 8-day messenger I'm Malachi four
[1:41:37] and a half and Samantha I'm Malachi four
[1:41:38] and five eighths and I'm Malachi four
[1:41:40] and three quarters problem that is we
[1:41:44] don't see no such things that in the
[1:41:45] Word of God all those men run to the end
[1:41:50] and many more will go the same way but
[1:41:52] there are men who are born of the Holy
[1:41:54] Ghost they are born of the new kingdom
[1:41:58] this is why they don't want to build a
[1:42:00] kingdom they want to support one praise
[1:42:04] God
[1:42:06] they've got enough sense to know it in
[1:42:08] all about them and how gifted they are
[1:42:10] how wonderful and they are and may
[1:42:12] dreams they have and how many songs they
[1:42:14] can sing and how great they can play the

[1:48:04] of Jesus father may you minister to UM
[1:48:07] Lord may you help them father they may
[1:48:10] feel that during our land out there in
[1:48:12] New Brunswick or wherever they are Lord

[1:48:16] and in Ottawa
[1:48:17] Oh God they may not have a

[1:48:27] shine their light Lord and realize they
[1:48:30] may feel as if though they are of no

[1:48:34] baptized into the pillars of God they
[1:48:37] are a great support and strength we I'm
[1:48:39] sure we'll never ever see the full
[1:48:42] effect of what we are until we get to
[1:48:43] the other side but father we're not
[1:48:46] doing it for reward anyhow we're not
[1:48:48] doing it so we can have worldly
[1:48:50] accolades of praise but Oh Lamb of God
[1:48:52] we're doing it for you if there was no
[1:48:55] reward I would still want to do it God

[1:49:01] hours on end and preaching and traveling
[1:49:04] to your war house and sleepless nights

[1:49:09] up there and walk in beside the Sheep
[1:49:11] who do not preach and who do not labor
[1:49:14] in the word it would be worth it to
[1:49:16] enter into life eternal Lord God because
[1:49:20] unworthy we are but Heavenly Father you
[1:49:23] have called us to be a support work of
[1:49:26] the greatest kingdom that has ever been
[1:49:28] known hallelujah Lord Jesus I pray for
[1:49:31] every man woman boy and girl help us to

[1:49:38] tonight that have lost a husband or a
[1:49:40] wife and they feel like their purpose is
[1:49:42] gone but Lord Jesus may you renew their
[1:49:45] vision and their purpose and help them
[1:49:47] to see they still have a higher call in
[1:49:50] Christ Jesus may these young people of
[1:49:53] Happy Valley not wait for 10 years down
