but talk comes so easy when life's at its best but it's down in The Valleys of Trials and Temptations oh that's where faith is really put to the test oh but the God all the mountain is still God in

to be here once again one more time where my amen is at let me hear you amen amen let me hear hear it again now I know you can I know you can do it so if something is said that fits the way you feel I expect to hear an amen amen it's like I said it is truly good to be here and and um to bring the word just something that the lord has laid upon my heart and um yes I'm nervous my if you would set your heart on God set your heart on a purpose have an expectation God will be here to meet it and I often say when I go and Minister I read the quote refer to the quote in in uh the message hear ye hymn way back in the 50s I believe it was he said we must be inspired by the word of God that will bring God to his word and make it act and do like it did before so you have a job to do this word will be dormant will be lifeless and you are inspired by it is that true amen praise the Lord amen my it's just a lot to bring this morning a lot to say and and I don't even know how to say it but I'll just say it the way that I'm able and you all receive it the way that you receive it and then if it catches in you you'll be resoundingly saying amen amen praise the Lord I believe God's going to do something special today for some someone maybe it's you maybe it's me but I'm under expectation amen while you're standing if you will turn with me to 2 Samuel and I'm always forgetting something when I go out and and and Minister I forgot my reading glasses uh once again so uh but I believe I believe I'll be able to see sufficient enough but um you would think I'd be able to see already I have two pair of contacts in so that should be magnification enough but sometimes the devil likes to work in ways that caus us to pack on a little more amen 2 Samuel 23 and 13 beginning at 13 and while I'm here and thinking about it I'll just go and get this out the way I'll look at my watch for those of you who think I'm worried about it okay I'll just go ah and say this in closing it's done all right I'm I'm closing right now so so you won't be worried about it 2 Samuel 23:13 and three of the 30 Chief went down and came to David in the Harvest Time unto the cave of adulam and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of reim verse 14 and David was then in an hold and the Garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem verse 15 and David loded longed and said oh that one would give me drink of the water of The Well of Beth Bethlehem which is by the gate verse 16 and the three Mighty Men break through the host of the Philistines and Drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David nevertheless he would not drink thereof but poured it up out unto the Lord let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you dear God for your many wonderful blessings and we thank you for your word we thank you for the anointing that rests within us we thank you for the anointing that rests upon your word and father as I was just referring to the quote father we thank you for inspiration because sometimes we come to the house of God Church the Tabernacle where Living Waters are flowing and we've got so much going on and we've we we've got so much traveling through our brains that it's hard to be inspired but father God I pray that you take each and every individual that's in this place today those that are listening in by way of the internet father those that will pick it up later father maybe they're down maybe they're low maybe they're they're burdened down with a besetting sin or something that's in their life that's troubling them in such a way that they take more identification in what they've done and what people have said about them than what your very word tells them that they really who they really are so Lord they can't break through through into that inspiration but father I pray that you would just anoint us oh God to receive that inspiration from on high to receive something in this word that will cause us to be inspired to go out and live this word in such a way that we would illuminate a path of someone that has no idea that they have a genan seed of God within them God we love you and we thank you for this opportunity we thank you for our space in the building and father we've created a place now may you come and fill it with your presence and it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen you may have your seats it's quiet in here we got to stir something up amen amen do you love him amen do you love his word are you going with him has he done something for you amen I want to to take our thoughts if we can just for a moment while we're here and God has called you to be my audience today and it's up to me to be earnestly sincere got a quote for that it's not me being bold or anything so therefore and with that being so it's up to you to be earnestly sincere to receive this word many times people want to place all the obligation and responsibility in this spot right here but actually it's more so the responsibility out there because you all are the ones that operate the gift it's the man's job to just simply get out the way sir but if we can just take a little bit of time as we were reading this this scripture just as a point of reference as a as a as a as a point of inspiration Anointed with the king's desire now we hear a lot about these these three Mighty Men and and and what they did these Warriors that that stood there with David and and and quite frankly they were three of 30 that that were Mighty but they just happened to be there on that day and you just happen to be here this day on this this day to receive this word to hear what God has for for this day because you are one of those Mighty Warriors ready to hear what's on the heart of the king you ready to hear what is the desire of God himself and have the opportunity to respond or sit like that bump on the pickle that our brother talks about so much so it's up to you what you're going to do with this service today it's up to you what you're going to [Music] receive but Anointed with the king's desire now as this unfolds we find out that David begins to make this utterance and he he begins to speak about something that that he's familiar with something that that that that's attached to him that that he knew about from his his years when he was younger and it it was a whale and it was a source of course a whale is a source of water but it wasn't just any well it had to be the well by the gate the water can't come from just anywhere it has to come by the well that's by there at the gate because time and time again no doubt David had drank from this well and he knew how it would satisfy that thirst and there was something specific that David wanted it was from a specific place and maybe you've come here today with something in your going on in your life and you need something specific for God and you already cried out and you said God you know exactly what I need and from where I need it amen Anointed with the king's desire so here we we find this man he was hiding in a cave he was down he was low and it was hot because it was the time of the Harvest and here he was he he was in a weakened condition and he was so weary because he was being pursued the devil's after you so David STS watch what he does in his low time in his weary time when the enemy is pursuing him and the desire of the enemy is to take his life watch what David does he begins his thoughts begin turn turning toward home you get down you get weary and you don't even pray you won't even call anybody that that that's got some strength that's got some ability to strengthen and to Hold Your Hand during this time think on things toward home don't allow the devil to trap you so so much that you stay in that cave Anointed with the king's desire David's thoughts began to turn to Ward home and he wasn't so consumed in self that he isolated himself and withdrew hear me so isolated that he withdrew withdrew away from Mama with Daddy from from Dad from friends from those that love them from those that care for them begin to isolate yourself because of the weariness and where you are trapped in that condition we're talking about being Anointed with the king's desire not with the devil's desire he knew how as I was saying time and time again the water from that well had quenched his thirst so many so if you would just pause for a moment weary Pilgrim where you are today and just think about the times that you used to sit and you would read your word you would come to the house of God and how you would just begin to get livened up the weariness would somehow just begin to just Fade All Away H the times that you used to read your Bible the times that you used to come to the house of God now you're trapped in a cave and the enemy is trying to destroy you but we have to be anointed by the desire of the king we have to turn our thoughts toward home and not stay stuck down where we are begin to isolate ourselves and pull ourselves away well I'll just stay in my room I I'll just stay at the house I won't I wanton no no no come out your room maybe your Daddy needs to take the hinges off the door young man what are you doing you're supposed to be Anointed with the king's desire not the desire of the devil young lady what are you doing where are you going Anointed with the king's desire but he began to speak words that were for familiar to him and he refused listen he refused to allow where he was and what was going on around him to cause him to forget about home he refused to allow his condition to cause him to forget about the good things of God even though maybe he was so low he couldn't pray maybe you've gotten so down maybe right now you're in that condition where I I'm just so weary I don't even know how to pray anymore don't allow yourself to get so low that you can't think about the good things of God that you can't turn your heart toward home and begin to think about that well that's there by the gate the times that you had in God the times that you would be out dancing under the spirit of God where is your dance now where is your joy get back under the anointing and the desire of the king God's calling you back home those words of home they begin to stir something within these Warriors simply because of what a man was saying his desire affected someone else and they knew that David himself could not come out from where he was so they went and did something for him that would give him the ability to have some strength to rise up on his own feet and to face that devil square in the eye cuz sometimes you don't need daddy to fight for you you don't need Mama to fight you need to fight yourself under the desire of the king being affected by the desire the words of a king the the the the words of someone that's speaking about home there's something about the word of God that even when we're down even when we're low it'll begin to stir something within us because that is our identification that is who we really are thinking of the old song the old Pentecostal song in the word of God I've got a hiding place I can hide in that word and the devil won't know what to do with me these words of Home begin to stir Within These old boys that picked up the message hello they picked up the inspiration of the message for their hour for their time where they were at that moment and they felt the tug of that attribute and it put them into action they could not sit still they could not stay where they were they could no longer hang out in that condition where they were because why they were under the anointing of the king they had received that inspiration and it put them into action 2 Samuel 23:16 amen second 2 Samuel 23:16 and the three Mighty Men watch what they did they break through the host of the Philistines H watch in verse 13 let's go back up 2 Samuel 23 and 13 and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of reim now that word reim the the definition is old race of giants so this is something that they had gone through before four they were very well aware of these Giants they were very well aware of what happened to Goliath but yet there was a circumstance standing at that moment in their life where they had to go back through that devil again but because they were Anointed with the desire of the king they didn't worry about because they knew God had and they knew God would Anointed with a desire the king's desire the message why little Bethlehem now his Warriors could not interpret his thinking watch this but brother they loved him with all that was in them they love their King they love this man and the least of his desires was a command to them so the least of what God desires for this bride for you for me today is a command to us and three of his Mighty Warriors pulled their swords they didn't stay at home they pulled their swords watch what the prophet says and they slipped off from the camp and they cut their way 25 miles they didn't have some little just little Clippers going through they they they slung that sword you say well I thought the sword was for the men of God for the no it's for you this this word of God is a sword take it in your hand and go cutting your way through that situation that condition that thing that's clouding your mind to where you can't even think right we're to be Anointed with the desire of the king because we're warriors and they slipped off from the camp and they cut their way 25 miles David in their going no doubt wondered where are they at what have they done where did they go did they know they're jeopardizing their life where are they they're right in the jaws of death through a 25 mile line laying in Ambush everywhere and the swords are flickering and the shields of blasting but their men their brother that they believed that would be king desired a drink all because the king desired they fell under the inspiration of that desire and they hazarded their very lives for that purpose God's wanting you to go witness to a family member God's wanting you to go witness to someone on your job you have to fight your way through that thing maybe it's the woman sitting beside you in your chair today your wife I don't know what y'all be into but maybe you got to cut your way through that thing H Anointed with the king's desire they cannot interpret his thinking but brother they loved him with all that was within them and the least of his desires was a command to them the least of his desires was a command do you think about something Mighty in that does just take a simple word that would be bring such inspiration to you maybe something here today that you will hear from the Throne of God that would be inspiration that will allow you to cut your way through a host of Philistines in your life because you are a mighty warrior whoever I'm talking to now some of you sitting here looking at me think I don't know what he's talking about I'm not talking to you I'm talking about these Warriors that can be stirred by the word of God I'm not here to tell you who you are you have to receive that for yourself but the moment you know who you are you can stand and you can be that Invincible Army you can take what the prophet has said and apply it to your life not just read it because it's in a book not just listen to it because it's on a tape but you can take that in your life and allow that word to live out of you because while we're Anointed with the king's desire what did they do they fought their way through until they got to that well they fought their way through this is not some flowery bed of ease we're not on a picnic this is a war this is a battle you got to fight for your children you've got to fight for that sick loved one you got to stand in your position and as the song says watch The Miraculous come into action watch the supernatural unfold in your life what does God do he takes his superness and takes your naturalness and blends them together and that's the supernatural it's not all God he takes our natur he takes these old frail frangible Dusty frames in which we live and he sends an anointing down on that frame then we begin to do things that we thought were impossible cuz after all this is the message of Malachi 4 is it not is it not and you've heard me say it before he identified me before he even identified the prophet of the age that's right he got my attention before he even says anything about Malachi before what does he say behold I send you so God is concerned about you receiving what he's doing in this age many people they they'll say that well that was John John fulfilled all that no John didn't do all of that scripture in Malachi 4 and5 there was a part that he played but then there was a second part to that right our hearts have been [Applause] turned what did they do they fought their way through until they got to that well they dipped the bucket of water out see even after they got there there was still something for them to do they couldn't just go to the well and come back to David and say well David I went we saw it it was there but what did they do they brought back the evidence they brought back proof of where they were there was something about their life that was changed when they came back before David and they weren't all clean and pristine they had some blood on them they had some wounds they had some bruises why because they were under the anointing of the king they were under the anointing of the desire of the king what does God want done with this word this bride stands up and says I know father I know what you want done now are you going to submit to that are you going to do that God's giving you inspiration God's putting a burden on your heart and while we're here thinking about just the burden brother Donnie mentioned many of you know about it and have asked me about it it's still in the workings I'm not one to get in a hurry to do about anything I wait I'm a very patient person well I'm a patient person I have to watch that very sometimes cuz these kids have a way of I blame it on the kids but falling under that inspiration don't worry about what people are thinking people are not going to understand what you're doing it's not for them to understand you just go and you just do it get on the phone pick up the phone call somebody the Lord's laid that person on your heart well I can't do that brother Joel they're going to think I'm up in their business well maybe their business needs to be got up in maybe that's what will awaken them to to where they realize somebody really does care that I haven't been to church in a while somebody really does care that I'm not seeing that I'm not around somebody really has a heart for me God I believe I'll go back to church why because we are under the anointing of the desire of the king they dipped the bucket of water out and here they come back they went through the the host the 25 miles going and so when they got the evidence they had to go back through those giants through those troubles through that weariness but at the end result was going to be fulfilling the desire of the king because they bore that anointing here they come back fighting they fight coming and going sometimes you think Lord what in the world is why do I have to do all this the the the the King has anointed you with a desire he's trying to get you to fulfill his purpose in your life that's why you have to fight that's why you have to struggle so much here they come back fighting cutting their way right to right to left and they're coming to the presence of David listen to that they're coming to the presence of David they're coming into the presence of the king I'm wounded I'm weary I've got some bruises I'm scarred but I'm coming into the presence of the king it doesn't matter what mama says what daddy says I'm under the anointing of the king you played around under the anointing of the devil long enough wake up Saints wake up young man wake up young girl get out from under that anointing of the devil and get under the anointing of the king and here they come back fighting cutting their way from right to left and they're coming to the presence of David said here you are my Lord father I lay it all down at your feet father I'm coming I give my life I give everything that I am I lay it all down I don't care what the people behind me are thinking the people behind me know what I've been through they probably know why I'm up here they know I've talked to some of them they know why I'm here it doesn't matter what the people are thinking you're in the presence of the king you're not under the anointing of Youth Camp you're under the anointing today God may not even spare your life for you to take one step upon on that bus here just recently I had a a a great niece of mine 22 years old died 22 it's it's real had no clue it's just a weird feeling an odd feeling to think that that somebody that once was a part of the family is no longer 22 here I saying today today would have been mom's 93rd birthday we don't know we don't know when will be our last time so fall under the anointing of the desire of the King today don't you dare leave this building without responding to that call amen here they come back David said here you are here you are my Lord they said oh my what a man that was disgraced a man that was hated by the church a man that was hated by the king a man that was hated by the Philistines a man that was hated everywhere nearly but a little group that followed him they knew that he was the coming King there's just something about the name Jesus Christ begin to speak that name don't be afraid to speak that name don't be afraid to allow that name to escape your mouth we sit around and we wowy wowy woo all the time so why can't we give God praise why can't we glorify God in those times you say brother Joel I'm hurting that may be true but praise the Lord God inhabits the Praises of his people we're we're we're taught we're instructed that being dead in Christ being dead in Christ we take on Abraham's seed making us Heirs of the promise in Genesis 22 this unfolds that as God spoke to Abraham then back then as he was speaking to Abraham he speaks to us now today why because we are that Royal seed of Abraham we are the Fulfillment we are the evidence of what God promised would take place because what did he tell Abraham he says thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy not Mama's enemy not daddy's enemy not little brother's enemy but his enemy your enemy you have the power I know this is all simple if you receive it it'll awaken something in your life but if we would receive the reality that we are a part of that promise that we can possess the Gate of our enemies Genesis 22 And1 and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here I am now you watch this son of God and roll back to the Garden where the Son of God was being called by God what did he do he ran hearing the word of God will either make you run and hide because of what you're doing or you'll say Lord I know what I'm doing but here I am anyway amen you just got have to take me as I am and do with me what you must but I don't want to run and hide when Papa comes into my garden When papa comes into where I am and he begins to call my name even though I may have to hang my head in shame I still want to say God here I am I don't want to be trapped up in the in what I became or what I allowed the devil to put on me some name that he put on you don't shake yourself from that thing the presence of God is here and he's calling your name your identification is in that voice God your very identity is in the voice of God and it's ringing out calling you and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham that word simply means to test I thought Abraham had already been tested waited 25 years for this child to come on the scene and here God's bringing another test absolutely absolutely God's putting you through where you are right now don't question it receive it and say God whatever this is for here I am here I am to test and the test came after he believed God for the original promise after he believed God after he received the word After the Promise was even fulfilled God still brought a test to Abraham you've been living for the Lord 30 years 40 years 10 years 50 years you're still going through tests in verse two he tells them take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest thine only that solitary thing that one thing that unique thing that one thing that's unique to you God wants it what is that one thing that you're not giving up surrendering completely to God maybe it's your temper maybe it's hatred Envy maybe it's Disobedience and you're hanging on to that thing God says I want it okay am so the best thing for you to do today is surrender it just give it over to him because why you're under the anointing of the desire of the G that's what God desires is for you to give it to him that one unique thing the angel of the Lord tells him in verse 16 because you have done this one thing this one thing you take you took this one thing that I gave you and you're giving that one thing back because you did this one thing the one single solitary thing sometimes God doesn't ask you to do a lot he's just wanting you to do one thing one I know your schedule's tight I know you're busy I know the kids all this running and going but God wants you to do one thing today what is that one thing that you're not willing to give up fall under the anointing of the king his desire and surrender that one thing because the the angel of the Lord tells him because you have done this one thing you will receive multiplied blessings right not just a blessing here and there but blessings that will be multiplied time and time and time and time and time again because and in that multiplication in that blessing in the Fulfillment of This Promise the the the gates will be possessed by a gate possessing seed now again I'm not here to tell you that you're one of those you will have to find that out on your own but I'm here to say it that God's children who receive his word and surrender that one thing they become gate possessing seed the very Gates that the that the enemy tries to set up and says you can't come in and you definitely not getting out once I've got you here trapped you're not getting out but the Bible tells us that as Abraham did so shall we we can possess that gate and it's not going to be an easy thing where to fight coming and going so take out your sword when you're at home in your room by yourself take out this sword don't tuck yourself away in in your room on your device looking at some movie that you shouldn't be looking at my I'm not here to medal but I'm here to stir you up to remind you you are no match for the devil I'm no match for the devil fall under the anointing of the king get his desire right huh it's easy to follow the devil because the devil makes this thing right here feel good every time you will find a good feeling when the devil moves in on you well I better go with it cuz it felt great what you're supposed to be dead in Christ dead things don't feel anything when you're dead in him you're not going to feel these pulsations from the pits of hell I've touched the many dead corpse they don't move back they don't open their eyes and look at me who touched me they're dead my some of those Old Testament folk will get me for that you ain't supposed to touch dead people y'all have at it do what you want to with it but the the gate possesses seed Saints that's you a gate possessing seed tabernacling deity in you that's that's you you that's that's the evidence of what Abraham said amen to and here we are in 2024 receiving some same words and just as Abraham said amen Here I Am the the the requirement for us today is to say amen and say Yes Lord here I am that's you that's me that's a body of upon the Earth today a body Anointed with the king's desire H at Thy word 1948 after you prayed for watch this tomorrow talking about possessing the the the gates of the enemy and these things and and we come up for prayer and we think well maybe I didn't get my healing but after you're prayed for tomorrow the next day is going to come the test maybe prayer for salvation maybe prayer for healing in your body or or Deliverance or whatever besetting sin all of these things the test is going to come don't you worry the prophet encourages us he says everybody in here that ever received the Holy Ghost a few days afterwards come the test I can say Amen to that I can say brother Brown a few years afterwards there was still tests coming is that right he says now watch what he how he works with this when you're healed that demon in there the body of begins to die out the body the body now what is a body doing in this body H you are no match for the devil when you're healed that demon in there the body of it begins to die out the test is coming Satan's going to try to return back when the unclean spirit's gone out of a man he walketh in dry places he returns back and brings seven other Devils worse than he was is that right notice Let the house be garnished and swept and ready at that hour so the prophet words it he and he says it this way that body begins to die out that body so a being takes resonance in your body but I thought we were supposed to be the Tabernacle of the most high and living God a demon takes residence in your mind a demon a body you take it up with the prophet that body begins to die out and that being takes resonance in in your body begins to attaching itself to you in order to make you its host it's feeding do you not realize it's feeding off of you that's why the Devil Wants You isolated that's why the Devil Wants You by himself because he knows that when he that if you're around someone and they see you going down they see that you're not just right they're going to call you back to life the devil's objective is to take you out of here because that being that that being has attached itself to you and you become its host you are the a a sustenance for the devil giving the devil life giving the devil ability to do what he came to do your body gives strength and nourishment to the devil the prophet says that body begins to die out a tabernacle of the devil's desire but he says begins to die so here we become host for this body and it's beginning to die and we continue to do those things that's giving it life what are we doing we are becoming demonic life supporters giving that thing life it's supposed to be dead we're supposed to kill these things why because we have the sword in our hands and it cuts coming and going and we got to fight don't give up don't get weary in your wello don't be a demonic life supporter we the the this church is a hospital it's not a Hospice place we bring Hospice in when someone's about to die and we make them what comfortable until they die I don't want the devil to be comfortable I don't want to give him life support I don't want to pump him with something that's going to keep him going just a little longer oh we want to keep him here just a little longer oh mama mama daddy oh my no when my mama said oh wow she was ready to [Applause] go H she was seeing something Beyond this Dimension she wasn't afraid of that that she was seeing so that gave me hope that gave me confidence that gave me Zeal that gave me determination to know that if she saw it I can see it too if she can go then so can I we look in Daniel chapter 3 we're not going to read it but but just as a point of reference we we find out uh Daniel and the three Hebrew boys in the finary furnace taking uh talk on the word 1953 they fed him this stuff for 10 days we know the story I won't go back into it little old pot of peas orever what it was nothing in it at all to make you fat some of the sister would say I need some of that ain't going to make you fat I'll eat it I know some of the brothers too eating all these Pudge points first thing you know they brought Daniel up and the rest of them and they looked all the boys over the devil's looking you over they looking you up and down huh they're scoping you out when they brought old brother Daniel up his cheeks was Rosy he was just as round and fat as he could be Hallelujah said say I believe every time they set that little p of peas down before Daniel that God just reached over and got the vitamin bottle and poured the whole thing into them so what's happening today in this service for you God is taking his little spiritual vitamin bottle and he's pouring the whole thing into you today just one person maybe two maybe three maybe 10 maybe 20 whoever it is God wants you to be pumped so full of vitamins that here in this whole crazy age in which we live we can still be plumped fat and Rosy cheek and ready to take on the devil and not bow down to anything that this old strange King decrees I'm not falling under the inspiration of the devil I'm under the anointing of the king amen I know my redeemer liveth it was the purpose of God to show that he had power over the wild beasts of the field and they put some lions in a cave one time they had starved them until they were so hungry that they could have tore a person to Pieces Just at one great grab and the talking about Daniel seal and the devil thought surely I'll be able to destroy this Prophet Daniel but Daniel had purpose in his heart to do the purpose of God so Daniel had a purpose because God had a purpose and Daniel picked up the anointing Daniel picked up the inspiration of the purpose of God and he said I refuse to defile myself Angel of the Lord come and speak to the prophet of God he said don't smoke Don't drink don't defile your body now that's in the message young men let me tell you something don't smoke Don't drink don't defile your body because as you walk on through life and you keep that sanctification you keep that position in Christ God's got a little Queen for you to walk by your side you may be a little knucklehead now but God's doing something in your life to take all of that [Applause] out don't smoke Don't drink don't defile your body why are we not hearing this preach around around the message of the hour today people are afraid because they think well I don't want to say anything to be inappropriate let me tell you something these kids these older people they're doing things that are inappropriate so it's time for the word to call out all this inappropriateness you'll find yourself strung out on drugs and you'll find yourself following some little Floy that she ain't worth two cents she has no identification of the word in her young man get away from her young lady you stand up in the character that God has called you and said I will not defile myself I have a purpose from God and I've fallen under the anointing of The King and I want to do the desire of the king you keep your yourself pure you keep yourself chased you keep yourself whole hear me young people don't try why my goodness don't go off in that boy's room where are my a maners y'all supposed to be helping me out mama daddy you got some kids doing this you better be saying amen because the test is coming [Music] my my he say well that's just you brother Joel that's fine it might just be me but it's going to awaken you it's going to be something to get your attention you don't think a man of God as he's standing up here maybe he knows so I think about the pastor so much our pastor not excluded from this certainly not but the things that he knows in the counsel and the things he's standing here bringing the word and God's dropping these things into his heart and he's beginning to speak and it says I can't say that because I know such and such is done all these things having to go through all of this but the word of God is here to cut out all of these things because chances are you didn't listen back there in the office and God is trying to bring it to your attention again and the devil thought surely I'll be able to destroy this Prophet Daniel but Daniel had purpose in his heart to do the purpose of God and God had placed that in his heart so where did this purpose come from God had put it there you don't think the devil's trying to put so many things into that heart too but what did he do when it came he just slowly knocked it off to the side cutting coming and going in the midst of his test before Daniel could have had this desire there had to be something to create that desire before he could have that faith that Faith Daniel had that Faith there had to be something to tell him that there was a God that could deliver you sitting here looking at me today and you're thinking well maybe God wants me to come back maybe God wants me to surrender no that's not a maybe that's so God's desire God's anointing is for you to submit your life to him and to be filled with the anointing of God to be filled with that precious spirit of God to become a new creature to take on another identity I know my redeemer Liv is contining thought I know how that coincides this morning with the faith The Living Faith of the Living God in his church there's something in our heart that speaks that there is a land beyond the river I cannot put my finger on it neither can any man but there's something within us there's something within us that tells us that the grave is not its goal even there that day as my mom was leaving this Dimension she was talking and sharing her testimony talking about how when God began to move on her heart and she surrendered her life to him and her words were I just had no more desire I didn't want to live that way anymore and here she was 90 years old still identifying with that original work and that thing that struck her over 50 60 years ago whatever it was was still real was still holding her to the point when death came with its obedient knock she was there saying oh wow come on in I'm ready to [Applause] go because why there was something on the inside of her it's there's another life there's another world greater than this one H don't get trapped here a fire that's a burning a light that's been lit by God and no breezes can blow it out there's no cold spells in the church there's no indifference amongst the people there is not one thing young people listen there's not one thing that one of those little knucklehead young people that's in the young people's group that can say to you that should discourage you because while you have God you have the anointing of God in you oh well adults be quiet a minute young people let me hear you say amen amen let me hear it again okay it's in you too stand up in your position in your calling in what God has called you to do God's purpose that his torch light of Freedom will burn until the coming of the Lord and no powers can blow it out they will only make it burn brighter as they blow we know how it is when we were trying to start a fire some the Zion and and Jonas was trying to start a fire last night and and and Roman and they were they were just blowing they blowing too hard it wouldn't ignite it wouldn't catch I was trying to study I was I a got time to do this smelling like smoke but sometimes we blow too hard that's what that's my point that's what I'm trying to get at sometimes you just got to you you you the Devil comes in just that's the Breath of God you need to blow and huff and huff and get all laded and and the devil still standing there laughing at you in your face but stand in the calling that God has given you and it's been proving Through the Ages that persecution strengthens the church and Daniel not knowing how God was going to do it and not knowing whether God was going to do it but knowing that he was able to do it and knowing that something down in him told him so the trial that you're in the circumstance that surrounded and has attached itself to your life you think maybe God won't do it but there's something on the inside of you that tells you no that's the devil's thinking God can do it because he's done it before if he done it for this one I know he can do it for me why because it's God Daniel was down in Babylon away from home and all that was familiar to him he had become a slave and no matter what they did to him he had purpose in his heart that he was not going to defile himself with the Babylonian way of life he was not going to defile himself with sin he was going to come out of that condition come out of that that that that place of isolation and he was going to be a better young man he was going to be a better young lady or she was going to be a better young woman transform the atmosphere I challenge you transform the atmosphere in your home cuz sometimes daddy acts like a knucklehead too Micah Josiah Zion don't you dare say Amen sometimes Mama acts up huh gets a spirit stirring in the house you be the one to change that atmosphere in the home don't wait for Daddy to do it huh is that okay does that deserve an amen amen because see sometimes I think the young people young young men especially when when there's Rules and Things that that that are given and sometimes the the young girls Buck against it too it's just the the the spirit that's on them but but rules covered with relationship gives way to love and obedience cuz sometimes you can bring the rule the the law the law you got to do I'm Alpha dad but you got to do it in love because when you do it when rules are covered with relationship that it's more likely for that listen dad's listen Mom it's more likely for that young man that young girl to to to to give into those rules because they're familiar with with the care they're familiar with the love they know that there's love there they know that there's Comfort they know that there's encouragement so sometimes you need to back up from your position and love that child through that season where they are because they're getting older they're not the little tot that they used to be that's just how I try to do mine do they listen no do we keep coming back to the mom and I keep coming back to the same thing yes H take out the garbage make your bed clean your room pick up all these things but it's consistency and you do it in love why am I talking about all these things because love has to be following those rules and regulations love your child through it don't dismiss your child don't discredit your child don't write your son off your daughter off love them through that season where they are Daniel was down in Babylon he become this slave and nothing can harm her the prophet tells us this in spoken words of the Original Seed nothing can harm her not even death there Daniel was staring death in the face for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again a seed is being planted today the water will raise it up again you stay in this word you water that seed that's been planted today and you water it with this word water with the anointing of God Amen the prophet goes on to say the water will raise it up again here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name maybe he's not acting right that young boy maybe she's not acting right that young lady whatever you instruct them to do you do it in the name of Jesus even go lay hands on that little rascal don't be afraid to take position in your own home that's a Spirit that's creeping in and sometimes I've watched it even in my own home it'll come right after my wife things will begin to stir up H y'all don't believe this I'll move on spoken word is the Original Seed but she knows what God wants done with the word why because she is falling under the anointing of the king and she has his desire faith is our Victory oh if we had more Gallant men like that that would purpose in their heart if I am a Christian I'm going to find out every divine blessing that belongs to me and claim it every divine blessing that belongs to me every divine blessing that belongs to you as an individual every divine blessing that belongs to you we've heard it Pastor say time and time again I don't want to fulfill everything that's in this word because everything in this word is not for me but everything that is for me I want to fulfill that and that's sometimes is where the interference comes in we're trying to be like brother Donnie we're trying to be like sister Carol I'm not Donnie Reagan hello he's from Kentucky I'm from Virginia better place edit that out I don't want him to hear that but you understand what I'm saying I can't be anything but what God has called me to be so if you come looking for something to be said in a familiar way you've come to the wrong service today wait till your pastor gets back then it'll be exactly where you want it but if you don't receive this word today because it's coming from the Throne of God if you don't receive it you're going to miss something and when it comes time for your test you'll continue in that condition oh well nobody cares about me ain't nobody called me in weeks I don't want to call you like that nobody wants to be around you we're supposed to be under the anointing of the king and claim it if the Bible teaches that I can receive the Holy Spirit I'm going to stay on my knees till God gives me the Holy Spirit and just not drift waiting for this Youth Camp after this Youth Camp there's spirits that travel around these youth camps come on H huh wow you better go with the purpose of getting something from God that's going to stabilize you I don't care how cute he is I don't care how fine she is if you don't have the Holy Ghost you better leave him alone if you don't have the Holy Ghost you better leave her alone because there's been many many many occasions where message boys have defiled message girls and message girls have messed up lives of message boys in the church now the cute folk don't believe that not my baby yes ma'am you do it oh Lord have mercy maybe I should have preached the message I digress but here this this this his faith stood good in the face of hungry lions with Daniel his faith stood good in the face of an intensely hot furnace the three Hebrew boys their faith their faith the faith of God stood firm stood good the purpose of his heart that thing that God had pulsated into that young boy the pul that pulsated into those three Hebrew boys and and countless others we could this the scriptures littered with people who fell under this anointing but that purpose that was in their heart that was their victory that that faith that rested within them that's how you can receive the victory that's how you can overcome is to get the faith of God not Mama's faith not daddy's Faith but the faith of God why because you're under the anointing of the king oh the depths of these attributes of God that are pulsating from eternity imagine God is pulsating pulsating attributes he's wanting to to receive it more than you even want to have it he's projecting just about one time but he's pulsating all of these things back toward his seed and God desires more than we will ever know to give them to us he wants you to have eternal life he wants you to have salvation he wants you to be an overcomer he wants you to set this beside by setting sin aside he wants you to you yourself to eradicate these things to kill these devils not give them life support unplug the machine take the vial of drugs out of his arm that's giving life that's giving him makinging him com I don't want the devil comfortable because he's just a host in my mind he's a host in my body we don't want these things unplug it all and raise up off that bed of Affliction raise up off that bed of discouragement that bed of of of of weariness and gloominess and suicide all of these things raise up off of that thing in the new life of Jesus Christ he's wanting us to give us these things Even in our frail existence you can't do it you are exactly right you cannot do it I can't do it but he can just get him on the inside way to have Fellowship but now God Is So longing to have Fellowship I got to hurry but to have fellowship with his children that he come all the way from glory and he died to have fellowship with us isn't that marvelous so wonderful to think he's waiting and longing for a time when you will surrender completely to him completely that one thing that you're holding on to Let It Go surrender it just give it to him he's going to do one of two things he's either going to destroy it or he's going to take it and make it he's going to polish it up and give it right back to you and that will be the very thing that will be the the the the the glowing thing in your [Music] life suren it to him if you keep it you'll lose it but if you give it away you'll get it back he's waiting lamb and the dev when you get down go to read the word watch this you say oh my I'm supposed to read a verse today my what what what I do I I get me the shortest verse there is come on in

you say oh my I'll just read half of it see we're trying to bargain with God you were the one that made the promise you were the one that said what you were going to do and now you're backing up on what you said and then you expect God to be obligated to that say Amen right there woo there you are but the lamb just loves to eat that sheep food just eat it and loves it just stays right with it and keeps his head in it through all the day long eating certainly he loves it and he's glad to be led by the Holy Spirit the Christian is he's led by the dove of God Amen surrender to him Saints invite him into your situation invite him in yeah it's nasty yeah it's dirty yeah it's polluted sure but you know what you invite him in he'll come I promise you he will come he said there in when when he found the the the children of Israel they were polluted in their own blood polluted and he came because why it was a season of Love the spirit of God has come into this place today because it's a season of love for somebody you polluted your mind with pornography you polluted your mind with deceit deception and doubt argumentation defiance polluted yourself with these things you think well I can't do that because yes you can he wants you to surrender all not treating your wife right not obeying your husband as you should but joy you shouldn't be meddling that stuff you tell me why it's in this word if it's keeping you from a relationship with God I would give heed to it me personally I don't care who it's coming from and yes there are some people that have problems with black folk hello I can say it cuz I know I experiened it in 2024 yes some of those new found folk want to talk about I'm going shut up I'm going shut up Lord have mercy but it's real if it's the word of God you better say Amen to it I don't care if it's got polka dots huh if it's that word you receive it with gladness invite him into your situation the two on the road to EMAs it wasn't until they invited him in that the true Revelation came they talked to him they'd walk with him they'd heard what he had to say Prophet says they constrain him oh Lord we don't know who you are sir but we love your preaching come in and stay with us through the night and Jesus went in walking with him and they didn't know him and when he once got in maybe a little Hut but there's nothing too humble for him you say well brother brandom I'm an old man I don't care how old you are I'm just a child that doesn't matter how young you are I'm too poor I've got on overalls oh if you had a grass sack wrapped around you it wouldn't make no difference to God just ask him you're great in the sight of God you may not be much in the front of man but you're great in the sight of God you're one of his subjects come on in and abide with us seal in the message evidence of the Resurrection come on in and abide with us oh I couldn't ask him to come in me I've been a drunkard I've been a gambler listen to what the prophet's dealing with this I don't care what you are I don't care what you are today invite him in ask him and you find out he will come on your invitation he he's a gentleman he's he will come at your invitation he's never never turned one down and he never will turn one down he's longing and trying to get into the heart he's never turned one down you say I've been a street Harlot I don't care what you've been and the thing is that street Harlot has had to have some business folk come in h maybe you've been that you frequented the street harlot devil I don't care if you don't like this but this is real there's somebody that needs to be loose from these things coming to church playing around thinking that you're not okay you need salvation you need Deliverance you need to fall under the anointing of the king the desire of what God wants for you in your life you may have been a street harer I don't care what you've been God is trying to work his way into your heart just say come in Lord and abide with me and notice all through the day listen he'd been bringing the word but no signs you sitting here and you're hearing the word but there's no evidence I don't feel any emotion I'm not worked up the people aren't shouting and dancing and all these things there's no signs but you've been hearing the word today and maybe you're sitting here thinking this very thing when he got them inside and shut the door and sat down oh brother that's when he revealed his resurrection and what is a resurrection is an opportunity for death to stand up on its feet in a new life in new Strength a new Vigor new Zeal a new way a new purpose A New Hope a new salvation a new pulsation huh he revealed his resurrection so if you want to receive the fullness of this word today that's coming from him you invite him in and fall under his desire no time for the morning when he met them until the going down of the sun did he do it he never did one thing that he did in life only just the word and you've come day after day week after week month after month year after year and you have not received the Holy Ghost you've heard word after word after word now watch what the prophet does what way he says it he never did one thing that he did in life only just the word but notice at the evening time at the evening time that's when he proved his resurrection in the evening time you receive word after word you've come time and time you've come with grandma you've come with Dad you've come with Mom you've you've come with your neighbor whatever it is and you've come and you've heard the word but today is the day of salvation today is the day of Deliverance today is the day of forgiveness today is the day of acceptance why because I've invited him in and he will come third John 2 beloved I wish above all things that thou mayest Pros prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospers talking about the desire of the king God desires that your soul prospers even even that you would be in health and that your soul would Prosper you the new you the new you bringing you to Healing to your healing you receive that word you receive it and say Amen to it and you take your sick body you take your troubl mind you take your spirit of depression and all of these things and you take that to the new you you take that to the healed body you take that to the delivered mind you take it don't rely so much on a preacher or somebody else you take you to the healed you cuz why the prophet tells us your body your body your body will obey your confession I'll pray with you until I turn blue in the face but that ain't going to do it you have to bring you to that new body to that delivered mind to that new walk you bring you to your encouragement you bring you to your Victory your body obeys your confession not the confession of the preacher I'll sit here and confess it with you if you want me to I'd love to do that but it's your confession that brings your deliverance it's your confession that brings your salvation there's nothing that can stand before a spirit born Spirit-filled man or woman who has taken this word and placed it upon their lips cuz after a while the benediction the amens will be set on this service and we'll go our own merry way but then there comes the test and you are going to have to take the words on your lips and you are going to have to speak to that storm and you are going to have to stand out on the bow of the boat of your life and you are going to have to be the one to say peace be still let that anointing rise up within you there when you get that when you get those those those bodies that that that unified body speaking the words of God that that is that Invincible Army you yourself become that Invincible Army an army of One trudging your way cutting coming and going through the Philistines through those old Giants those old problems those things that you pick back up you're gonna have to go back through that test but I guarantee you today when you get back before the presence of the king and you said here I am and here's the evidence God I fought through this thing for my last time I've come into your presence and I want to surrender all to you that's what it's about that's what it's about hell is real hell is hot but Heaven is even more real amen Luke 12:31 but rather seek ye talking about the the the desire of the king but seek ye rather the kingdom of God as the musicians come but seek ye rather the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you so you want peace seek the kingdom of God you want salvation seek the kingdom of God you want healing seek the kingdom of God you want Deliverance over that clouded mind that depression that that spirit of suicide seek the kingdom of God I don't know any clinician any psychologist that can do this they'll sit and they'll talk to you and they'll share with how you feeling today and they'll take what you say and they'll repeat it back to you and they'll begin to say well it was because of this and you know well well baby because of this they're just full of May and they have the little diagnosis and well this is you right here I'm diagnosing you with blah blah blah blah blah and then here we go Wy Wy I've got blah blah blah blah blah blah some big long word and we glorify these things I don't want a diagnosis I want a body change because I can guarantee you this whatever whatever thing has attached itself to you sickness in the mind whatever it's a devil it's a demon and you're in a good place to get rid of it today but brother seek ye the kingdom of God and all these things should be added un to you fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom so his desire is to give the kingdom to those who truly desire to have it how many desires to have the kingdom of God he wants to give that to you more than you realize he wants you to have this thing more than you will ever know so whatever is that one thing that one unique thing that you don't want to let go of it's stying your growth in the Lord It's hindering your walk with the Lord surrender it give it to him from the oldest to the youngest from the ugliest to the most beautiful to the skinniest to the fattest to the blackest to the whitest it's for us all there is room at the cross for [Music] you there is a room room at the cross for you though me Millions have come there's still room left or one is that one you there is room at the cross for you you may be high you may below some are rich some are poor but there's still room room at the cross for [Music] you how about it you who's been playing around with the Lord will you find room in your busy schedule to make room for him grief comes in sometimes so strong you think lord I can't go on another day surrender that to him not telling you not to grieve cuz sometimes grief comes in like waves you'll be fine and then there's mama there's a memory of dad maybe that little baby that you lost you you think God why the prophet talked about how in Africa they'd be down by the water's edge getting water or washing their clothes or whatever and a crocodile would come up and snatch the baby they grieve for a while then they go on life it still goes on but your life can be more abundant maybe I'm talking to you today and you don't know fully what God can do for you I you to come whoever you are man woman boy girl it's real today's your day to fall under the anointing of the king and to have his desire pulsating in your life and that that that very thing will give you purpose you're looking to to go off to school college and you think I don't know what what about this what about that get him he will tell you what to do don't get weary in your

I'm mixing up some songs singers get in trouble sometimes praise the Lord you love him let's just bow our heads in prayer father what an honor what a privilege what an opportunity we have [Music] to not only read about your presence to read about you but to have you to to come near to come close and to come to where we are in our situations and in our conditions and you want to call us out of those things grief depression sadness obstinance all of these things Lord that hinder our walk and our way with you we want to surrender them today and we thank you for for that opportunity thank you for the words today and this space that you've given to us to be able to receive your word to gather once again now Lord life is such that there may be those myself included that's here in this audience today that come Wednesday night or next Sunday we may not be back because it's our turn to have that old wow moment but oh God until then we want to glorify you we want to extol you we want to lift you high we thank you for all that you've done for us now bring deliverance and completion in the work that you've began in us as a church Lord we submit ourselves to you Lord we bring our pastor Lord before you praying that you keep him balance keep him humble Lord all of these spiritists permeating throughout the land today Lord even he's susceptible to these things so I pray that you put a shield and guard around and put a shield and guard around us as the Sheep of this fold oh God and may we stand as a beacon of light in this age we've been called under the the message of Malachi 4 to take your word and do with it what we know you want done so father may we be obedient to that very thing touch those who are sick maybe those who are weary those who are are grieving still yet oh God touch that Heart Lord when that brother's there at home by himself Lord he's missing her so much when she's there at home and everything's quiet and hear the ticking of the clock oh God may you just settle in on that room father wherever she may be Lord maybe that young man that young girl has barricaded himself in their room Lord and they're feeding on things that they ought not to feed on Lord I pray that even there you will make yourself known may you just begin to cause the pressure in the atmosphere in the room to change and Lord maybe it would be even an audible voice oh God or maybe it's there they reading their Bible or maybe them falling asleep and you make yourself known I'll never forget father there I was about 14 15 years old that light came into the room there where I was just that Amber glow that soft yellow light Lord to this day Lord I don't understand completely what that meant but Lord I'm longing for that to return cuz Lord I'll be more mindful I'll be in a better posture Lord to to be more obedient to to to to listen so father may you do things among us that's going to cause us to get in Step CU that's what this message that's how it ended up as that bride walk in that narrow way in the Prophet calling us to get back in Step so Lord forgive us where we haven't forgive us where we we don't write us father God put us back on that straight and narrow way we love you and we thank you and it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen isn't he wonderful amen amen God bless you thank you for your time your patience your love and I do ask you to continue to to pray for me in my Endeavor back home and it's it's just something again I'm just the burden's been there for years but um I don't want to get ahead of the Lord and I definitely don't want to lag too far behind but just um my preference I'll just go ahead and share this my preference is not to have it in a a church building proper but to just have another space somewhere because I don't want it to be such where someone may be indifferent to that church or Something's Happened Lord that maybe that they they don't want to you know maybe the people that go there but if it's a neutral space so just be praying with me about that I'm just um and just my time that I can float back into Gaya and and do some of the boot boots on the ground type of stuff and just the witnessing and and all all of these things just getting the feel for things and the these things take the leadership of the Lord and I'm I'll be counting on you all to pray for me and and I know you have been some some have and but I know others thought maybe I that my family and I were moving and and all that that's that's not it I'm not Desiring to start a church or anything like that I just my heart's desire is to find that one and sometimes that's birthed out of a burden you know and and to to just Captivate a soul and and ignite a fire within that one and they they take it and and go with it and that that'll be great with me but we have to be doing something for the Lord don't sit on your hands don't just wait for Wednesday night to come do something tomorrow do something this afternoon for God do something on Tuesday do something on Wednesday that'll be a testimony to share with the body of Christ on Wednesday evening but do something for the Lord stay busy in him God bless [Applause] you falling in
