of Prayer and we'll get into the word tonight a man this morning if you have an unspoken question for the knowledge to the Lord by an uplifted hand any man for he sees every need let's just pray Lord we lift our hands to you in faith Lord we defy the law of gravity more than we received the law of grace to know that it's not by our own choosing our own human ability but it's by the unmerited favor that you've given us Lord and and Lord we lay our knees at your feet today Lord and many there are many of different needs Lord some are playing for family Lord and and loved ones and different issues and jobs and financial situations but we know your all-seeing eye sees everything about us you know everything about us and Lord most of all today father we pray that we have the right attitude Lord for the prophet of God said that the right mental attitude will bring every divine promise to pass so Lord God let us be happy in what you're doing in our lives and let us never mumble or complain for we know you hate a murmur and complain our Lord so father God let us take the challenge of this gospel Lord with a willful heart Lord just being grateful and we treated you just continue to bless the pastor in his absence his family Lord his church family and all those who are connected to this ministry and and all God we pray today that the real preacher himself Jesus Christ will come in minister into his creation again and father we just love you and we just pray today that you take full control of our body soul and spirit in the name of Jesus Christ we pray the church say man let's say hallelujah amen those you have your Bibles let's turn to Exodus the twelfth chapter Thank You brethren Exodus 12 gotta keep pressing on Exodus 12 let's start reading it um let's start reading at verse 11 if you have a say man and thus shall you eat it with your loins girded and shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover and we know when brother branham talking about this particular verse he said look that's desperation he said um verse verse 12 for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and beast and against the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the Blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt Amen let's go to Hebrews 10 and we're gonna skip a little bit in Hebrews 10 to get where we need to be you know what y'all don't mind let's just read it Hebrews 10 and one for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect for then will they not for them would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshiper ones person have had no more conscious of sin but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sin every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats to take away sins wherefore when ye coming into the the world ye said sacrifice and offerings that would is not but a body has now prepared me in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou has has had no pleasure then said I know I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will O God above when he said sacrifice and offerings and burnt offerings and offerings for sin thou wood is not neither has pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he lo I come to do thy will O God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the blood of the body of Jesus Christ once for all in every priest and of daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sin but this man who is that man Jesus amen nobody else get the crack hallelujah nobody else get the credit for you being delivered from alcohol from lusts from line from denomination the only one gets the credit is this man Jesus Christ he did it what no it was no boy it wasn't a goat it wasn't a lamb it was the bloody lamb of the Cross Jesus Christ it was this man that we served today who you this man that died and rose again this man that week to sit on the right hand of the throne he know who I'm talking about but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sin forever sat down on the right hand of God from his fourth expecting to his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified Church by the offering of Jesus Christ you spend perfect this morning that makes me want to shout hallelujah he says where the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said therefore I mean before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put away I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more may the Lord are the blessing the reading of his word you can have your seats I think you can kind of tell where I'm going this morning you know I'm just a kind of preacher where you know I believe that we have to deal with seeing Amen we have to get you know singing things out of our lives a man because that's the only way God can put his hand on you he's not going to touch something that's filthy and unclean unless you confess Lord I don't want to be filthy and unclean but if you if you have things in your life and you continue to live that way with no open confession of deliverance you'll remain in that condition but once you confess how do that Jesus Christ is your Savior he is your Lord he is your deliverer that brings him on the scene huh to do what you can't do a man that makes him your advocate a man that makes him your deliverer that makes him your peace of mind the hallelujah that makes him a mighty God in your life amen so confession doesn't mean you're weak hallelujah but confession gives God the right to do something in your life and then before I get in my something I mean let's just deal with us a little bit you don't remember the woman that had committed adultery and and she was dying and she was a Sunday school teacher and she didn't know why she was dying it was because she had unconfessed sins in her life and the Bible says the wages of sin is death you know a lot of people think that they're getting away because they look at this one sitting and it looks like there are you don't know what they're going through before they close their eyes you don't know that they're people being tormented in their sleep they're taking sleeping pills and they're taking pills for depression and all these things because they have unconfessed sins in their life oh let me tell you something if you can't get a good night's sleep that's a demon the Bible said Jesus said come unto me and I will give you what rest so I challenge that spirit today oh that's affecting your street amen come on to me jesus said and I will give you rest let's get the unconfessed things out of the way so God can put his hands on you and you know she should come to the Providence she was saying she was dying and all these days and she didn't know why finally after several times meeting with the Prophet this one particular time he began to have a vision honey he says I see you in a car with a man of a certain color hair and you're riding down the road and you're almost hit by a train why was she screaming because her sins were being made known demons love to scream out when everybody to be cast out oh my I don't want to go into this today but this is just where I'm at hallelujah so obviously there's some spirits that need to be dealt with today man there's some unconfessed sins in the Church of have a valley that needs to be dealt with today cuz otherwise I wouldn't be preaching on it if it was covered by the brother so let's deal with your unconfessed chance let's deal with your depression let's see what your secrets let's deal with your lust let's deal with your lies so that God can put his hands on us and the only way God is gonna put his hands on us is if we invite him in because God is a lover he's not a brute hallelujah he don't just come in and force us he's giving us free more agency a right to choose and you have to choose the right thing today and you don't church hallelujah this woman she begin to cry but you can't hide your secrets from God [Applause] your sins will find you out and you know as she stood there and she's like please don't tell nobody long she's on the floor waddling and screaming in her sins it's just the media had to come in patter and she's telling brother Branham no you don't tell nobody this today he says well so sad indeed all I can do you need to go make that right he says I can't do nothing for you until you make that right also he saw the vision although he was a prophet although he had thus said the Lord because I do nothing as loogies are the best hints are there and let me tell you today God can't do nothing for you with unconfessed scenes in your life today hallelujah and you know what we think I don't need to infest do you want God in your life see Satan has rights and you know he has rights and this we have a right huh to walk in every open door of sin in your life and as long as those doors are open he has a right so I'm telling you today we have the ability in Jesus Christ to close those doors something you need to put your hand on the door and slam it in his face and say today I will confess today I will make it right today I will come under the blood hello yeah but you know when you start preaching like those people get nervous holy let me tell you something major judge hallelujah I'm just a messenger honey I'm just an agent a man and one thing I know that my policy is eternal it doesn't matter what church you go through the past the policy stays the same it doesn't matter how long you had this particular assurance it stays the same it doesn't matter who your agent is the policy remains the same oh yeah so you can run oh yeah but the Word of God will not change hallelujah and you know when we get into these areas and you say well brothers why you hitting us because remember it was a message the prophet of God was preaching he said the rapture should have been taking place and you look what we had today we're in such a place what we have we have a president who's so comical I just go to look to see what he's saying so I can give me a good laugh I know some of you you kind of touchy in all this stuff who cares who cares who the president is the Bible says by this man hallelujah we are saved Jesus Christ by this man we are delivered but this man we have joy I don't care who they let in office he's all working for my good they're gonna like the Chinese man it wouldn't bother me none cuz I got a promise a man oh yeah that I will see him when he comes cuz I will be like him so politics doesn't change who I am oh I'm a Jesus Christ supporter but you know can't you tell it's God's choosing to have a man in office that nobody can't control they can't control it you know why because he's a businessman and the country is like to him running a business he don't care who's under his staff if you don't run his business the way he wants you're fired it's just like a business and Congress can't control him you know the Democrats and whatever else cracks or whatever all they got came none of them control him and I want you to understand this God allowed him to get there because God has a plan God is up to something amen and it's time for us to stop worrying about what the world is doing and look at the prophecies that's being fulfilled oh yeah don't you understand that under a bush prophecy was fulfilled I know bomber prophecy was fulfilled and you thinking under this this new administration that prophecy is not gonna be fulfilled it's being fulfilled [Applause] let's get our feelings out the way and let's stand on that foundation you know what you know what I love about no matter who gets in office I know what you're gonna do before you do it because God sent me a prophet hallelujah but you don't judge when we start to get down these areas and that we're in a time we're in a time now where you have to make your calling and election sure you're not in the time where being a church member is good enough you're not in a time where just knowing the quotes and normal brother branham said it's good enough you're not at a time just hallelujah being under a good ministry is good enough no you got to get to a place where you know you're under the blood of Jesus Christ now let's get into the thought earlier today my subject is covenant people oh yeah and you know God is a God of covenant honey he loves to give us a covenant but I want you to understand the only one that's under conditions is God we're not under conditions our company this unconditional but for God to give us a covenant there's certain things he has to do oh yeah there's certain things he's obligated to and what is it his words oh yeah God is obligated to his word though the Covenant for us is unconditional for God he's hold it to his word to you by the church honey when it comes to God's Word we can tie his hands we can put God in handcuffs we didn't come to God at all no you said over here in your world so you have the power you have the ability to make God operate according to what he said holy when you and I can say something you and I can make mistakes and God will look past it because our covenant is unconditional but with him he's holding to it he can't say I didn't mean to say that oh yes you did you told me I was the head and not the tail so when I get in tight spots all I gotta do is believe that hallelujah according to what God say you said by spikes I'm healed I can't get into a fourth stage cancer and then God says oh that's too much for me oh no you said I was healed see God is obligated to his words you know in times where I feel a little down and out and I don't know which way I'm going and in the scripture calls the says let the weak say I'm strong and the devil will come and say well that's not for you and I say oh no God says that the weak say I'm strong and God said in my weakness did I am a spell see the key to the message of this hour is knowing your word and living your word it can't just be up here oh yeah let's get into it when we looked and we see the scripture that from the earth from its earlier at the times of Noah God gave a covenant you know he destroyed the earth and then he came and he floods the earth and then God put a rainbow in the sky and that rainbow color was a covenant that God says I never destroyed the world by water again cuz how often do you see a rainbow almost every time it rains so that means that covenant is still standing and as long as you recognize that covenant you are a covenant people hallelujah and we're living by what God said hey man but you know as it goes on and on and and then we backtrack a little bit more from there you know Adam and Eve hey man they say they broke the first covenant between them and God they meant that they should not touch the tree of knowledge of good and evil that was in the gods and they broke the covenant with God so Richard mercy he made a way for us to get back earlier he made a way for us to be a covenant people a man and his or covenant deals with a promise God keeps his promises [Applause] like we will say it last night if you're going through any trouble look the devil cannot sneak up on God gotcha no can't do that car you ever see those people play practical jokes and they jump out on somebody's life well let me give you a stretch to how that happens with God in the devil Satan loves to try to sneak up on guys he's it ah let me play games with God you're gonna play jokes with God because he's waiting to bless you any demon devil any situation the enemy cannot sneak up on God God is ready for him and I'll tell you nine times out of ten we tries to sneak up he's gonna get more than what he bargains for you know people that that have interesting I was just playing why are you so aggressive great God is like don't play with me like that don't you know that I'm up nipple tints I'm all power hallelujah and that God gives in you when Satan sneaks up you need to stop being afraid hallelujah he sneaks up on you say boo you need to say boo boo you devil I got God on my side I am a covenant people they may you know trust when we look at this covenant that God I don't want to be long I'm about to close y'all know I said because those words got power I'm about to close got power there'll be people like Bill Lewis saying pay attention and then you sing the same about the clothing [Applause] preacher preacher man preaching 45 minutes then you go and sleep I'm about to kill a man brother a man baby's been sleep the whole service soon as you sound by the cold is it they wake up so if you look this interested or if you look drifting today or you're just not quite where you're supposed to be let me help you out I'm about to close but you know Church distance covenant that God gains from the beginning I mean he wanted him to take an animal and and take the blood of that animal and offer a sacrifice earlier because he said when I see the blood I'll pass over you a man hug now in that covenant hallelujah that that blood Hurley was there to admit see in fact that particular time it didn't remit desire hallelujah that's why I'm so grateful we're not under that covenant anymore [Applause] now that covenant was under the law that does not mean we don't need at all because now we wanna church people who says I can do whatever I wanna do I'm under grace no he said I did not come to take away the law but I came to magnify the law so now under the law huh it's not just you taking a woman and sleeping with is she doing it through your eyes oh my are you doing it through your fault oh yeah see now the law is magnified hallelujah is not something that you can just keep with your own human ability but it has to be a part of who you are to keep this long see people looking for a third day they get upset and they get upset with the messages how people do it look at how you dress and they look at what you talk about look at your hand you're spitting in and out of stuff I'm just sick of being judged well if you're sick of being judged you sick of the judge because the only judge is the Word of God I ain't your judge but if I tell you what the word say you ain't mad at me you mad at the world hallelujah you know it's like me and one of my friends that denomination of good people real good people you have good people living under the law real good people and you know they go to denomination you know they wear pants at that church and all this stuff the issue of pants come up and you know and we got to talking by the mirror and my wife and her husband all we got talking about pants and all those things and and you know she was time up his pants the issue and so many other different things and she said brother we're under a new covenant we are the new covenant so that covenant does not give you the right to take away the law because you believe that you're under grace but the Bible says the law is a schoolmaster so the Holy Ghost comes public and you notice how God does things her lujah sanctification didn't take away justification oh yeah and the baptism of the Holy Ghost didn't take away hallelujah Saints vacation amen but it all made one whole look so my illustration to them was I said hey you can't just take the oh she said I bet you that's in the whole tesla's I know you ain't just old test me because he's you know how God says for a woman away plants is an abomination and you know she said I bet yesterday I bet that's an old-time say yeah but Paul said women when you dressed dressed as - apparel hallelujah oh boy y'all tightening up on me I feel like brother Donna we got to get them a man thing to a man tanks going up in here come on children but you know church hallelujah we begin to talk about that and sometimes you say well I bet that was under the law the Old Testament I said look here I said looking here if you take a loan for brand and you cut off the back part and I cut off the front part eating all of the bread she says yes I said but you think about it like this when that loaf of bread was bought it was all brand whether it was cut this way of cutting that way huh it was all bread so the Old Testament is brand the new test is bread and you put it together is bread I love it comes from the same place huh so you can't take this part of the bread and say it's not bread oh I don't need this limo if you get hungry enough you gonna eat that bread it doesn't matter when it hits the front part that all of us like the gold pants it's still bread but I guarantee you get hungry enough you take that front piece toasted put ball over to eat it just like the back piece why because it's right and you know church under that under that particular situation we were just saying that look you can't take this part of the world and say it's not words you can take this quote and say it's not words you can take that point and say it is worth all of it makes up Jesus Christ [Applause] you know how some people who want brother Branham saying I'm just trying to serve a God who Lia of yesterday but the garden yesterday is the god of today haruya in the garden tomorrow is the god of today and yesterday hallelujah so choice we have to look at the Word of God and think about it like this honey it never gets old it never gets stale it never gets bold on hallelujah it's always ready to fix for you but you know under that sacrifice of animal blood they was the priest was coming how do you you had to see this I think this sometimes what we miss out is that when you sin you had to get your own sacrifice the priest didn't find the sacrifice for you know you had to get your lamb or your gold or whatever you know you got in that time halu you had to get and you had to bring it to church oh wow cuz that was the Covenant you was under you didn't come to church without a sacrifice over your life oh yeah but you know they brought the sacrifice in had to be a sacrifice without blemish because have look imperfections in it couldn't have little happy silly you know I just can't stop watching this old TV you know I just like looking at the boys blow me away people watch that stuff do y'all realize they sing inwardly Souls no matter how good they voice is you ain't doing me no good cuz I ain't singing about Jesus but that's under the Old Covenant well you can come to church and still live out your own fleshly desires you still sit home and watch scandal still sit home and watch Housewives of Dallas or housewives on Johnson City whatever soul cuz you live by your desires your own worldly desires under that sacrifice under that covenant but you know what God allowed that but the Bible says hundred that those things were a shadow of what was to come this will be a sacrifice that cause that totally an idealised the human desire we get into something real good huh it might wake you up dance dance dance all night oh yeah cuz you know the Word of God and you know having said it to myself the Word of God does not separate families but the Word of God brings us together if we can receive it the reason why it tears up families is because somebody is not receiving it but you know today today today today the worshiper had to get that sacrifice Amen he had to come how do you raise the church and you know the sacrifice had to be a willing sacrifice honey see it wasn't some oh wow gold did you trying to play you say Oh help me I need livers I just take it over this pornography Allah help me I got the drag did the judge know it's a willful sacrifice [Applause] that's why he said he's the Lamb of God not the goal of God not the pool of God not the kaolian God but the Lamb of God because a lamb will willfully surrender his life y'all wonder why I'm walking over here cuz they pulled him between the in-between man you put a little bit hard I get over there too [Applause] huh the I under y'all know by now my Walker hallelujah and I want where the pool is hallelujah hey one of those pulpit preachers I mean I thought the feeling of knowing of the terms a little feel the pull of the church if you pull out wheat directly to you you know turn from there you know they see they didn't start it yeah [Applause] and you know from there they take that take that that sacrificing there bring it to the church you know he didn't have to have some she didn't have to have no gorilla grip on that sacrifice so it's so I couldn't get away we're gonna turn God know what none of that it was a willful sacrifice you'll bring it in tight say hello I'm gonna get deliveries today won't change the day cuz I got the sacrifice and I'm bringing it to the priest they're bringing his sacrifice and they're bringing it up hallelujah they bring it to the priest and the priest begins to examine but before he examine he looks at you the worshiper he says what you ain't no go go ahead on go this is about your sacrifice now [Applause] the worshiper hallelujah wasn't the one being examined it was the sacrifice oh yeah see touch your Covenant hallelujah i'm-a it's your sacrifice that's being examined under the Covenant we are under human and you don't charge oh yeah that that that that sacrifice that lamb or whatever they broke it would sit there and the priest would examine it the priest would make sure that everything about it was right and make sure that didn't have any hair loss well you know buddies I just you know we got hair about just just by nature we have to cut the speediest you know so it can be healthy liar you have to cut it so so it can continue to grow and liar we believe simple eyes ain't nothing deep about that ain't nothing mysterious about that that's just something simple simple lie the devil is told that's why the bottles do you read your Bible you understand why God said certain things he said if you gonna cut it shave it off ball why ball because that's the only way it's gonna grow back it grows back from the root not from the spleens [Applause] when you cut it off right here it don't go from right there it goes from right here Satan come with his old lies and told you when he sneak up on your son Jesus BAM boss them right in the face hallelujah there's too many of us letting the devil talking out here that's not scripture here you know belong in your face he belongs under your feet that's where satan belongs he's got no business talking to you [Applause] don't worry i'm about to close but touch you take that sacrifice and give it to the priest and he's examining a man and make sure is fit to go only out and once they got to the priests it had nothing else to do with the worship ah huh because you gave it to the priest and now it has to be offered unto God but your sacrifice wouldn't fit the priest will tell you hey you got to go get something mr. sing good enough and that's what's happening a lot of people are offering up other gods they offered up other sacrifices that's not fit for deliverance and that's why you find us abound with the same old things earlier bound with the same old demons yeah I just got to let y'all know hey man if you didn't haven't figured out by now but I'm a demon chaser hallelujah people are afraid of demons why if God ain't afraid of the devil why are we afraid of his imps he says I give you power over unclean spirits no as a man I am not able with the Holy Ghost inside that's what the demons recognize huh they recognize what's behind that veil that's why when Jesus went on the other side and there was a legion of demons there huh and they was used to tormenting people amen just family ran out they said whoa and then the Bible says they said we know thou thou are the Holy One of Israel and the church people called him Beelzebub but the Devils knew we was you can call me what you want but in another room they know who I am they know who you are I thought well you come in the break room people started looking at you funny it ain't them is them demons that love will you go to the family cookout of the family event everybody thought I can funny told you it ain't demons them demons they recognize when the light comes here brother Bible says that the light holy signs and darkness comprehended it not they can't understand why we happy serving God and we don't do this and we don't do that and we happy about you know why cuz the Bible says great is the mystery of godliness my joy is a mystery unless you want them and let's me you brothers hallelujah did you will understand why I'm happy honey any man we brothers how do we understand what gives each other joy but if you ain't living in my world I look like a crank I look like a fanatic hallelujah you know I've been caught I've been called a little bit of everything till a car stolen radical in what you owe count stuff you know what I say thank you cuz what I am I am by the grace of God [Applause] I'm here to make you happy I'm here as an evangelist to stand between you and the enemy God gave me that right hallelujah to standing between you and the enemy and I want you to know if I'm standing there in the middle that I'm on your side so it's two against one huh and the Bible says that one of us can chase a thousand two of us can chase ten thousand holier now I don't know about you but I got my thousand do you got yours yeah this is what the Word of God has come it's come to set us free it's time to remind us that we are sons and daughters of God we all get there amen I ain't you know I'm one of those preachers who I hope you ain't waiting on the punchline cuz I don't have any it's real simple you pulled I preached you quit I stopped you resist I sniff [Applause] but if you can't rejoice in the word that means there's something else there that something is stopping your dance stopping your praise stopping you're a mess I don't know about you but every time I hear the word I get excited hallelujah because church the Bible today just did you how to profit God say when you've heard from your theophany and we hear it all the time we just don't realize let me ask you a question what's making you say Amen this morning ain't necessarily the revelation now it's something greater than that it's your representation it's your word body in another dimension hey man say hey pterri pterri well I'm preaching huh it may be way back here by Sister Sister Tabitha but Dean hallelujah but the terrorists theophany starts to recognize that he's talking to them so as the world is being preached and he begins to get closer and closer to brother Terry and as the world is preaching he comes in brother Terry here he says save me hey that's what's happening to each and every one of us it's our representation from heaven making us say hey man to the world hallelujah and what does a man me hey man means Soviet are you bright Soviet are you blessed so be it are you a son or daughter Soviet that means whatever the word is saying to me in this moment if you say Amen you're saying I receive [Applause] but you look at that sacrifice no no I don't be in and out issue pool but you're looking at sacrificing out a precess that's sacrificing he's examining it and everything and then he offers it up once a year once a year but that person that worshipper he would give that sacrifice and if he gave it because he committed adultery he went away with the same desire that's the Covenant they won yeah this is were forgiven for that year but they went away with the same desire you know they were saying he going away if he committed adultery I thought oh boy I think God God he forgave me but did blaspheme Jesus because that desire still there yeah he offers a sacrifice but the sacrifice wasn't good enough to change his heart the sacrifice wasn't good enough to change his life although they were forgiven but it did not produce a change and let's look at a little deeper what if you all we all were under that sacrifice today and you brought your sacrifice to brother Donnie's brother Danny oh brother Danny I thought evil thoughts it oh please just offer this sacrifice for me and it did Church all of a sudden brother Donna gets an email he forgets about your sacrifice sacrifice to do their did he gets a text and he forgets about you even more do you get a call from you just forget all about your sacrifice what has happened to you you're still living in because you put your life in the hands of another man that's why I'm so glad hallelujah it doesn't matter what kind of life brother branham lives earlier that does not determine my eternal destination it doesn't matter to me whether he got a caribou or silver temple he got a blackberry with the India Africa none of that has to do with my eternal destination it doesn't matter to me whether they got witnesses of a breeze and they got witnesses of the witnesses of that that does not defeat my eternal destination it doesn't matter to me when they can prove he was there in Arizona whether he wasn't there that does not determine my eternal destination you know what because I'm not majoring on a minor did not something we can use our very own message to defend ourselves oh the cloud brother Brenda wasn't there is oh the Tilson over that and oh he didn't get the black bear and oh this you know what I don't care and I know some of you message realest you cut me out right now but you know what don't because if brother Brennan was my Elysa hallelujah all right you smile easy you had one purpose and one purpose only in my life and that wants to get me to Isaac so they can say huh he had on sauce they can say this say that they can say that didn't that the prophecy about this was well they say mr. black man I can say you did go to Ilya they can say you talk about you they can say all these things is too light it's too light Isaac [Applause] see water I've read Jesus face the feds and it's really too late because some of us Isaac has taken us into the tent and he's infected his scene we got life inside us now so they just say well they won't survive brother Brendan leave just in case you don't realize he's dead but I think he's still alive he's living in my heart I'm just so in love with him he's the apple of my eye he's the reason why I live he's the song I've seen I'm just so in love with Isaac Jesus Christ that is you're taking away from my profit no that was his whole job [Applause] his whole job was to grab me by then say come on cats right come on I won't take you to meet somebody better yet look look look look oh he can look at this goal he gave me all in all this I got this from his father hey just did you don't belong to me it belongs to him and you know what he told me how do you two find a bride for his son the message I got ain't even mine it came from him [Applause] brother Brendan's message this message table Jesus came from God the Father but you know Church they take that sacrifice I'm so glad we're not under that because under that sacrifice you can be controlled by your own nesting nature you come to church pay your tithes listen to the preacher smile laugh when you're supposed to and walk out with the same desires under that covenant but then the Bible says earlier he said Jesus was looking at us as his children he's looking at us in the 20th century and he said you know what before they're even born I'm gonna make a way that they don't have to go through this nonsense though the god he said I'm gonna make a way that they don't ever have to go through that that when they act 4 delivers it's gonna be right there in their mouth so he says you know what i'ma do I'm gonna take away the first to establish the second I'm gonna take away the first sacrifice hardly the first covenant name it and I'm gonna give him a new color and you know Church hallelujah by him giving us a new covenant he had to give up something he had to give up his role he had to give up all his prestige he had to give up all this power everything that he was why because there was something else he was trying to achieve there was something else that he'd rather to receive did not live with that that's why I blows me away Billa Harry you didn't want heaven without us so geez are you my scene was great your love was great tell me can't stand against me now [Applause] wonderful name you know wonderful means excellent think about that he's the god of the adjectives I don't just call him Lord I will just call him god I caught up with an additive infront I call him great God wonderful God awesome God powerful God loving God see we just can't talk about and we got to put something in front of it I I gotta come out to close I'm just having to understand such a good listen listen see that the blood of bulls and goats couldn't change our life it was there for a period of time it could change something for that movement but according to your eternal that snakes it couldn't help you you want you came away all the sacrifice for your sins you were covered by the blood but you went away with the same sinful nature you know what because just like the prophecies in the Bible says that the nature of that animal the blood of that animal couldn't connect I was in New Zealand last year and I made an atheist at some meetings he said he didn't believe my testimony [Laughter] Wow didn't believe my testimony you know I did when you told me that Brian I'm gonna tell you about it and you know what his sister came in and we were sitting down eating it you know I'm trying to close he was signaling we were eating and different things and she comes in and she says brother take some when you were here from cancer this and that this and that this Annette and so I started telling her this medicine and she look at me confused I said what's the problem she said well when this happen did that happen how does this happen I said what's the problem she said well I'm confused I said you know why because it's not your testimony it's mine you can't tell my story like I can so if you see somebody shouting and dancing in church don't you criticize you don't know what they going for you see somebody crying and lifting their hands and worshiping God don't you judge them you don't know what God doing in a life you can't gentle by the story like they came and sometimes in church I get like a wild stay and I start bucking cuz you know one thing about a wild stallion he's free here you got no beat in his mouth he got a little on the side he got no saddle on his back he's free and when you trying to hold him down with your dachshund he's home now I'm free in Jesus some of y'all need to buck you out way to freedom some of y'all got the opinions of man on your back don't you know you'll stay in your thoroughbred I'm so beyond what people think I get y'all tell of course I love people and I'm not here to try to offend nobody but you ain't gonna stop me from being with God honey can you imagine if I get up here trying to be brother Donny I will fail miserably if I try to be brother Terry brother Joey I will fail listen all I can do is beat brother thanks and if I be brother Diggs you get the gift that God gave me but you know anyway this young man because he says uh-uh so I go outside I begin to talk to sister you know I had a person to like the waste time there's an issue we need to deal with you got some people come in the prayer line and they know they need prayer they wait till you get two words ago because I ain't trying to find out or sneak into what kind of demon is oppressing you I won't you tell me so we can pray about it but God knows if you come up here we're gonna touch and agree and we're gonna get victory over the devil I say just still cuz I see demons do that all the time they try to hide they know it's gonna be cast out so they jump into the emotional room and they start crying and y'all the demons can cry behind and just I can't speak it because the devil don't want you to speak your deliverance if you don't come out so mal he still got a grip on you remember that when I walked away I'll lose she will confess those sins to her husband and he was a deacon in the church and she confessed her sins and she came back in and brother Brennan said now it's different I can control that demon power confession and you know Church hallelujah this young man comes out he says he says I said I sit down introduce myself and you know I just like to get I just like to get right into it y'all know me I'd like to get right into hangout time for games so we get right into this a so you'll believe my testimony like now you know they got they got kind of like a British accent stuff now I said so you don't believe in God no I said why don't you believe in God I just don't believe that there's just one being running everything and I said hey you miles well cause that's the truth first of all y'all should have seen how I went to him we can either say you don't believe my testimony we are not to be afraid to put our God on the scene because if he did it in your life he did it for a reason so you know Church hallelujah I'm sitting down talking with him he's like um I don't believe that there's a god and this and that and blah blah blah so you know what your problem is you've been hurting my church people I say some religious people you know some church people you know they hurt you so now you can form this up in you and he had a big head big old Charlie Brown head you know full up full up with knowledge full up with knowledge and I said your problem is you've been hurt by trust people or religious people so now you put up this wall that there is no God I said put the ears of God he's going on he said that's net and I said well how do we get here he said well it was a big bang I said oh my god you wanted him people he says a big bang I said big bang you really believed it was a big bang I said you had a big bang was let there be and it was so we talked a little bit more and you know I like to get right to us I said well what caused the Big Bang he says well five being year's wife's at home oh he says five billion years ago he says yes five B I said hold five billion years ago first he tells me he don't believe there's God cause everything has to be proven right one of those people don't believe in faith and he was talking to the roll first cuz that's my life you know he says everything has to be proven he said I said well what calls Big Bang he said well five billion years ago um no no I said where do we come from she says we come from monkeys I say you won't run that by Mickey he said we come from monkeys I said man you got to be crazy I said besides you ain't smart enough to know the look of black man in his face and tell him he come from a month are you crazy you know how hard we disproved that right you know how many years we had to fight the show that that ain't cute you gonna lose me in my face and tell me I come from you might come from a monkey but I don't got to beat things so the story goes on he says I said well what is the earth come from he says the Big Bang I said come on man I see you ain't got no more sense than a this is the Big Bang I said she'd I said well what caused the Big Bang he says well five being here's my hole five billion years ago yes five beam years ago I said was you there he said he says no I say I said well how you know it's true he said cuz scientists finding I said you said everything had to be proven was you there he says no I wasn't there I say I said well how you know it's true he says the scientists I said you wasn't there I say everything I'm telling you I was [Applause] he says I need the evidence of when you first had the cancer and and and then you know they took a piece out and then the cancer came back and then it disappeared he said I need the evidence I said look at young man I said you see this right here this is not me losing my hair this is where they put a shot inside of me to help my blood circulate I said you see the scar right here just has not me losing my hair either this is where I had 27 staplers in my head when they went in my brain and they took a piece of the cancer out I say you see this cut right here this is where they did the last biopsy to show how you know what we are the reason hallelujah that he rose from the dead come on somebody he says well you can believe what I'll say I know I am so I said what caused all this he says well you know five minutes they stopped with the five beating years ago stuff cuz you wasn't there I said I was in here when he was on the cross bearing the wit of the world I was in him when he went down in the hill huh and when he went down in hell Jesus was their own man the only person who that went down in hell with the same Authority he had on earth [Applause] he woke up with a garrisons of demons and they couldn't touch him hollow right in the midst of hail hallelujah diabetes was daddy told diabetes shut up and sit down Castle was daddy said shut up and sit down depression was there shut up and sit down honey [Applause] do I understand how he could give up the ghost from Earth and go down the hill and still have the same power no but it was true Sabrina's young man he's talking about this he said five beam years ago as I said I stopped with a five years ago stuff cuz you know people who are intellectually I could show you how big their brain is you got some people in this mess and I'll quote you to death make you feel like you're worthless make you feel like you don't know this message the message didn't come to shame us it came to lift us up it came to set us free a man it came to give us joy but turn this young man a man he began to tell me I say I said just tell me plainly what happened he says well I said what caused a big bass as well nitrogen oxygen the earth he says a planet and a star you see those three elements called the Big Bang you with me type of not just your oxygen planet in the star I'll say that cause Big Bang this is yes I said okay that's not plan it in a star this is yes that cost the Big Bang hmm and on the table was some a bottle water I said was your water he says yes so I take the top off I start pulling it out that means pulling out everybody by this time we got an audience people on my side and people in church on his side cuz you know you got people looking to find some error in this truth so they can walk away cuz then convert it so they waiting on I told you so three times I'm outta here they waiting on that so you know that the people on my side every time I do this they don't brother Dave [Applause] so I'm pulling the water out I'm looking Debbie a woman yes saying then happening he says what do you mean I said you told me three elements called the Big Bang he said yes I said well this this water is how did you the smartest person in the world but h2o how did you what that was one of these elements oh my god is so good I say dick who you hiding the oxygen this is yes the Sun was shining I said that's the greatest star ever created every other star comes from those two of these elements coexisting together he says also a planet we are on the planet Earth I said all three of your elements are coexisting again and ain't nothing happening so what you believe is a lie it's just a theory but what I believe I got proof I once was sick but now I'm healed I once was lost but now I'm saying I once was blind but now I see in the name of Jesus Christ you know why because I'm under the right sacrifice as I come down to coal is what the prophet god says he says no matter how good you are how much you say you're a believer God requires the token he requires in Egypt he requires it tonight he requires it tonight still the token is just as much required in this age as it was in that age I don't care if you was a Bible student oh yeah how well you can explain the scriptures Satan can do the same thing but remember that has nothing to do with it God requires one thing that's the token the token shows that you are identified with your sacrifice that's why it couldn't be animal blood so one day there was a baby born in the manger earlier they had nothing to do with Mary and Joseph it was all God brother branham saying even God created the egg that was in jaws that was in Mary he said because she had to have a desire for a man to create an egg so God made sure he got to it before Joseph dear God all this in your message now catch all day I love the message I ain't reading it on the paper but I'm reading off my heart huh so Jesus said you know what i'ma break this chain of them offering up sacrifices and remaining the same I'm gonna put them under the New Covenant hallelujah I will make them a covenant people of power I will make them uncover the people of deliverance I'm gonna make them accompany people of healing of joy a piece of business hallelujah I will give them a covenant that identifies Who I am so from now on when we say we're under the blood we're not talking about that blood that came out under Egypt we're not talking about that blood earlier this blood hunger is the blood of a life real with the blood of Jesus Christ it changed our lives hallelujah just coming in a man this covenant stops us from sealing a man just coming to change our nature a man just come to change our talk I won't it changed everything about us so are you under the blood today see the blood has to be more than just a chemistry remember the benefits of token he said has to be more than just a chemistry a marriage won't last with just a good chemistry it has to be a sacrifice in life huh that man has to give for that woman and that woman has to give for that man hey man it has to be equal a man it has to be her coverlet [Music] that's what God came he came and he changed the Covenant but this time the life about the clothes but I want you to kiss this far close because of what I want us to do when we walk out of here today I walk out here without here's aa confident you know what a man is confident in the black culture when a man is confident his won't change a man he's won't get a little bit more cool stuff [Applause] stop knows who he is you take a woman that's confident on her walk changes when she comes in the room she knows everybody's looking at especially if she got them curls in he she ain't got that thing all did up he's got them curls and I hear she walk in the church feeling good how are you she's confident I say she has oligos I said she's calm I say he had whole ago since I say he was confident are you confident you won't change that won't us holding those feel believers to be confident today won't you walk out of here in the name of Jesus nature change cuz you identify with the sacrifice can you imagine how the children of Israel felt when they saw David cut the lion's head off all the problems were over and everybody in that camp was identified with David but there was Nova because they went to another battle and I want you to realize David kept Goliath hand he's gonna come to the next battle remember I said punch Satan in his face now don't even waste your energy what I want you to do is show them your promise show them your victory maybe they go to the next battle they ready to fight now you got the best of the line well we gonna get to David David David tells army Yahweh Yahweh don't it don't say remember the battle is not yours is the Lord's you say bring me the bag bring me the bag they get David the bay David walks out there y'all so y'all won't do this are you sure you want to fight this army are you sure you wanna go down this road again do you see what we're capable of this is your champion and I'm holding his hand [Applause] like this is the Covenant we're under we got gone outside now are you sure you wanna fight this army against Satan and I can see everybody scatter brother branham saying Jesus defeated the enemy simply by knowing who he was and in my closing earlier under the sacrifice of the blood of Jesus it's not just a little blood Danny enough to go around but it's a life oh yeah not just the chemistry but a life when we say we're under the blower under the sacrifice we're under the life of Christ what did he give us he gave us his life that's the public we're under we have his life a man we identified with his life the probably God said oh that was in God he poured into Christ oh that was in Christ where is it now he poured into the church somebody say me somebody say I got [Applause] and you know if you oh boy here come like brother will say here it is don't miss it now charge when you're identified with the sacrifice you're identified with the life and all that was in that life is in you now all the power in you all the healing in you all the joy in you all the peace in you all the authority in you everything that's in that sacrifice is now come back upon the believer here in the church and when you identify with this sacrifice everything that was in that life is now in the believer what a powerful name it is so now nothing that song has a different meaning you have no rivals you have no equals cuz where's Jesus he's in us so you have no rivals you have no equals you know why because Pais lives in you see that's a little too heavy for some of you are you taking away from what he was dead no I ain't he came to show us that we are children come on musicians I'm closing and if you are the son of a king everything in that Kingdom also belongs to you and if you got his but you got his DNA you got his makeup can you imagine Superman having a child what would it be Superboy he grew up to be a what a Superman are you with me well let's make it real simple Apple's produce apples can I get a you me or just produce oranges he goes put those Eagles liars for those Lions in God I [Applause] don't think that one click so let's do it again dogs produce dogs pitbull have another pitbull same makeup same lock jaws everything even put those Eagles same power in the car everything line for those Lions king of the beasts it has the same makeup same nature everything because it comes from a lion a man who your horses produce horses a man same strength same power same ability to run all of that comes from the life of the seed a man or just produce oranges apples apples pulse plums bananas bananas avocados avocados and God see I don't think you quite catching it because when I say in God I'm talking about you he didn't just produce another cadre dekes he produced a son he didn't just produce another Donnie Reagan he produced a son is everything how can you say that because none of us are alike there never be another Jesus there's only one so he had to make a me an army of his hope and we are that army we are the covenant people so when you take on the blood of Jesus Christ you take on the life of Christ and all that he is it's in his church so you ought not to walk out of here today with a negative testimony hallelujah you are to walk out here saying I'm a son I'm a daughter I'm a covenant oh yeah I'm the covenant I'm the church you're the reason why he went to the cross you're the reason why his blood said because he could not live without you that's especially somebody need to say I'm special oh yeah so when we think about being under the blood it's not just for us to say oh I'm under the blood in the Death Angel pass no the blood we're under we can't die we don't have to fear a Death Angel because this life is eternal hallelujah when you receive this life this covenant amen all that Jesus Christ is has come back upon the believer and we got stripped apart let this mind that was in Christ also be in see he wants us to understand that we are we are his people and when you receive this life if you seek today you got power over it why because he had power and all that God is has come upon the believer today all that His Word says has come back upon the believer and all we need to do is walk in it walk in what God has said about us Church don't walk out of here with the same stuff in your life don't walk out here fighting the same battles because what I love about moments like this you know how the prophet of God say yeah we lay hands on the believer but our promise is to speak the word you want to see God happy how many like to make God happy one muscle situation in the Bible that made God happy there was a Centurion who had a sick servant he sits for Jesus and Jesus was was was coming and didn't click he says a lot don't even come to my house he said I'm not even worried they don't even come to my house he said but you know what now God is on the way coming he told not to come and then he says hey I'm a man like you are like Authority like fashion he called for him to come and he realized he was just like him and that's what we do we've called for him to come not realizing that we are just like him so now he's saying I'm a man of like authority when I say come they come when I say go they go when I say jump they say how high because I'm a man of like authority he says a lot don't even that Jesus is walking he told another cop he says but don't even come to my house just speak the word only but you notice the Bible Jesus didn't stop coming as he began to talk Jesus kept coming closer to got to the place where he said Speak the word only Jesus came up to me since my god he said I've never seen such faith and you better believe he was smiling there's a place in the script away says he turned him around to the people he says I've never seen this kind of faith not in all these real and the Bible says from that very moment serves meal that's what we are identified with we identify with that how many believe it today we're not under a company of bulls and goats but we're under a covenant of the life of Jesus Christ that's what the holy ghost does the holy ghost brings the life of Jesus Christ on the believer so we ought to walk out of here in the power of the Resurrection knowing that all sickness was defeated at the cross all my problems were defeated at the cross everything I ever told about me was defeated at the cross let's pray Lord Jesus father we love you today thank you for your word Lord and Lord just to say that this service is all about you Lord the Lord let us climb into that place following this word can be a reality in our lives today Norwell you can deal with us as sons and it's daughters are not as servants but deal with us as the reason why you gave your life Lord you gave it that our nature would change you gave it Lord that we would be able to see the reflection of you in us and Lord God why you're going we're supposed to be here in Christ days so no God we pray father that you would continuously have preeminence in each and every life in this building today northern though there be trials don't be unconfessed sins we have a God that can deal with all nothing Lord and Lord in this sober moment Lord no we just ask that your presence would take full control for we know that the enemy is defeated because of you Lord and we are liberated because of you so we give ourselves unto you today nor that the work of redemption will continue to be made manifest in the lives of the believers to you be all glory all honor and Jesus Christ name we pray enter say man let's jump into this
