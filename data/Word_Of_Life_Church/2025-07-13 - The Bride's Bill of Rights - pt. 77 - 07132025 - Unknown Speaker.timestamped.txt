[5:05] Who can calm the storms of life
[5:11] like my Lord?
[5:18] He gives rest
[5:20] to the weary.
[5:24] Brings you life to the hopeless.

[7:16] Praise the Lord. Let me read you a
[7:18] testimony right quick here. We'll sing
[7:21] some more of that just in a minute. But
[7:23] I want to share this with you this
[7:24] morning. You know, our our prayer line
[7:26] last Saturday night, uh I believe the
[7:30] Lord has done and will do great things
[7:34] because of that. Brother Daryl preached
[7:36] such a a tremendous message. You agree
[7:39] with that? He did. He really did. And
[7:41] all the ministers and the meeting itself
[7:43] was just a tremendous success. Brother
[7:46] Greg Parker sends this in as a
[7:48] testimony. I want to thank the Lord for
[7:51] the healing touch he gave me going
[7:53] through the prayer line. I had multiple
[7:55] tests in June of 24 that revealed
[7:59] cancer. In January, I had more tests
[8:02] that confirmed I had eight tumors. On
[8:05] Monday, I had one more indepth scan that
[8:08] only showed one small spot. The doctor
[8:12] said he could not understand why it
[8:13] changed. Well, we do, don't we? Amen.
[8:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[8:20] Hallelujah.
[8:24] He has backed off on me having radiation
[8:26] and surgery. I go back in three months.
[8:29] I'm believing that that small spot will
[8:32] be gone. Somebody say, "May it be so."
[8:36] May it be so. Give the Lord a good
[8:38] handicap of praise this morning. Let's
[8:41] sing some more of that, buddy. Yes, he's
[8:46] Oh, sing it to him, church. If you
[8:48] believe you with all your heart, there
[8:51] is no other one.
[8:57] Oh, who can calm
[9:01] the storms of life
[9:04] like my Lord?
[9:10] He gives rest.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, he gives rest to the weary. He
[9:16] brings new life. Thank you, Lord.
[9:19] &gt;&gt; To the hopeless. Oh, there's no doubt
[9:26] about it. He's
[9:30] my my Lord.
[9:34] Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Look at
[9:37] your neighbor and tell him you're glad
[9:38] to see him in the house of God this
[9:40] morning. Praise the Lord. What a
[9:42] privilege it is. We have visitors among
[9:44] us today. We want to welcome you. Glad
[9:46] to have you with us. all those that
[9:48] would be streaming the service locally
[9:50] and around the world. We want to say God
[9:52] bless those folks as they enter into
[9:54] this service with us today. Could we
[9:56] give all those folks a good hand this
[9:57] morning if you will?
[10:03] Praise the Lord. We're going to look at
[10:04] our prayer request. Brother Randy Walton
[10:07] uh turns this in for Tony Walton. COPD,
[10:09] having breathing problems, uh has
[10:12] cancer. Pray for his soul most of all.
[10:15] So, we want to remember that prayer
[10:17] request today. Brother Josh Jenkins
[10:20] sends this in uh asking for prayer for
[10:22] my brother-in-law Samuel Burns, who got
[10:25] into a motorcycle accident two days ago.
[10:27] Badly, broke his ankle and foot. Already
[10:30] had one surgery, has another tomorrow,
[10:33] needing the Lord's help with healing and
[10:35] financial grace through all this whole
[10:38] endeavor. So, we just want to commit
[10:40] that need unto the Lord this morning.
[10:42] Brother George Hamlin sends us in to
[10:43] please pray for a c-orker Christy
[10:46] Thomas. She is recovering from surgery
[10:48] and having a heart cath today. So, we
[10:50] want to remember that as we pray. Sister
[10:53] Ruth Louise Jax wants to thank everyone
[10:55] for their prayers and is asking that we
[10:57] continue to pray for her daughters.
[10:59] We'll commit that to the Lord. Sister
[11:01] Laura Wo says to please remember Nancy,
[11:04] a dear friend of ours in the hospital,
[11:07] really weak and trying to recover from
[11:09] different health issues and surgeries.
[11:11] Thank you and may God bless. So we pray
[11:13] for that need today. Peggy Ward is
[11:15] requesting prayer for her sister Nora
[11:17] Tibs. She had a stroke yesterday is
[11:20] currently in the hospital. Please pray
[11:23] that she will have a speedy and complete
[11:25] recovery without any complications. So
[11:27] we want to commit that unto the Lord.
[11:29] Danielle Nunley Draper sends this in. My
[11:32] coworker and friend uh Chassidy Sawyer
[11:36] needs her prayer. She's been
[11:37] experiencing double vision and headaches
[11:39] for a while. finally went to the
[11:41] hospital. She has an aneurysm wrapped
[11:43] around her cortoid uh
[11:47] corateed artery. They transferred her to
[11:50] the UT hospital last night. No doctors
[11:52] here would take her case. So, we
[11:54] certainly want to remember that need
[11:56] today as we pray. Once again, thank the
[11:58] Lord for brother Greg Parker's
[12:00] testimony. All the unspoken prayer
[12:02] request. I know there's tremendous needs
[12:04] among us today. We just want to commit
[12:06] all these things unto the Lord. We know
[12:07] he's more than able to meet all of our
[12:09] needs. We believe that, don't we?
[12:11] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that in this age of your
[12:14] stage in your journey, in this age of
[12:16] time, that you have got a tremendous
[12:19] hope in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[12:22] &gt;&gt; You think about where you would be this
[12:24] morning without him.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; Man, I don't even want to think about
[12:26] it. Do you? Thank God for grace.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; Thank God for revelation. Thank God for
[12:32] the message. Thank God for the
[12:34] messenger. Thank God I'm not ashamed to
[12:37] be identified with any of it. How about
[12:39] you? Give him a good hand clap of praise
[12:41] this morning.
[12:44] Yes, he's my Lord.
[12:48] Sing it to him.

[14:12] All about it is
[14:16] my word.
[14:19] [Music]
[14:21] Amen. Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[14:24] Brother Skip, would you come today? Take
[14:25] us to the Lord. On behalf of all these
[14:27] prayer requests, we just want to commit
[14:29] it unto the Lord. We know God's more
[14:31] than able.
[14:33] Appreciate Brother Skip, don't we?
[14:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, buddy.
[14:42] Let's all just bow our heads. Dear Lord,
[14:46] there's no place we'd rather be. God, we
[14:48] love you. We we these are times that are
[14:51] struggling times for some of us, Lord,
[14:53] but we realize that you've gi us. We
[14:57] have to fight through these things.
[14:59] They're not going to be easy for us
[15:00] sometimes. But God, there are so many
[15:02] requests and we thank you that we have a
[15:05] place to bring them. There's a there's a
[15:06] bomb in Gilead. If we can just believe
[15:09] and have no sin in our life, Lord, that
[15:11] you promised it. It's like it's like the
[15:14] children of Israel, Lord. They went
[15:15] through without a without a death until
[15:18] sin come in the camp. We don't want sin
[15:20] in our camp, Lord. Not in ourselves
[15:22] we're talking about. And if we can just
[15:24] be that way, God, we know you you'll
[15:26] hear our prayer. We know you'll walk
[15:28] with us. You'll help us. You'll save our
[15:30] children. You'll do whatever whatever
[15:32] that you promise, Lord, in the message.
[15:34] God, be with our pastor, the speaker
[15:36] this day. Anointing our knowing our ears
[15:39] we might hear and understand. Anoint
[15:40] him, God, in a mighty way. In Jesus
[15:42] name, we love you. Amen. Amen. Thank
[15:45] you, brother Skip. Praise the Lord.

[15:50] tithe and offering. Let's sing of this
[15:52] old song. We've sung it a lot around
[15:54] here, but it's more true today than it
[15:56] was yesterday. All my hope is in Jesus,
[15:59] right?

[20:02] I've been broken more than a time or
[20:05] two.

[20:11] &gt;&gt; And you showed me what it means to be a
[20:14] man.

[21:37] God bless you, buddy.
[21:40] [Music]
[21:53] As I look back on this road I have
[21:57] traveled,
[22:00] I see so many times how he's carried me
[22:04] through.
[22:07] And if there's one thing I've learned in
[22:11] my life,
[22:14] my redeemer
[22:17] is faithful and true.
[22:22] My redeemer is faithful and true.
[22:30] Everything he has said he will do.
[22:37] Every morning his mercies are new.
[22:44] My redeemer
[22:46] is faithful and true.
[22:50] [Music]
[22:56] My heart rejices when I read his
[23:01] promise.
[23:03] There is a place that I've prepared just
[23:07] for you.
[23:09] [Music]
[23:11] And I know I'll see my Lord face to
[23:15] face. My redeemer is faithful and true.

[24:13] [Music]
[24:18] Do you believe this?
[24:20] And in every situation,
[24:23] Lord, you have proved your love for me.
[24:27] When I lack the understanding,
[24:30] how you give your grace to me,
[24:38] my redeemer
[24:41] is faithful and true.
[24:46] Everything he has said he will do.
[24:53] Every morning his mercies are new.
[25:00] My redeemer
[25:02] is faithful and true.
[25:07] My redeemer
[25:09] is faithful and true.
[25:14] [Music]
[25:38] [Music]
[25:52] He walked into the room.
[25:56] No one noticed he was there.
[26:00] Just a simple man they knew from
[26:03] Galilee.
[26:05] [Music]
[26:08] Son of a carpenter who lived right down
[26:13] the road.
[26:15] They all thought they knew what he would
[26:18] be.
[26:20] [Music]
[26:22] He would work with wood and build a
[26:25] home, maybe raise a family.
[26:28] [Music]
[26:30] But surely there'd be no great destiny.
[26:36] [Music]
[26:37] But no one knew the secrets hidden in
[26:41] his mother's heart.
[26:45] Their parents gave no hint to what they
[26:49] see.
[26:51] When he spoke,
[26:55] all of heaven just stood still. And the
[26:59] earth began to tremble
[27:03] beneath his father's will. When he
[27:07] spoke,
[27:09] the hearts of men began to change.
[27:14] And heaven fell like rain when he spoke.
[27:20] [Music]
[27:28] He never wore a priestly robe or walked
[27:33] with royalty.
[27:35] His friends were common men like you and
[27:39] me.
[27:40] [Music]
[27:43] He spoke of a father with a kingom and a
[27:48] throne.
[27:49] [Music]
[27:50] One he said no earthly eyes could see.
[27:57] They were all amazed this carpenter
[28:01] could perform such mighty deeds. and
[28:05] still walk in such great humility.
[28:12] But no one knew the secret from his
[28:16] father up above.
[28:19] They could only understand his kind of
[28:23] love.
[28:26] When he spoke,
[28:29] all of heaven just stood still. And the
[28:33] earth began to tremble
[28:37] beneath his father's will. And when he
[28:40] spoke,
[28:43] the hearts of men began to change.
[28:48] And heaven felt like rain when he spoke.
[28:55] And heaven fell like rain
[29:01] when he spoke.
[29:07] [Music]
[29:13] [Applause]
[29:17] [Music]
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Psalms three, brother.
[29:24] How many knows he's still speaking?
[29:27] &gt;&gt; He still sends his word. I'm glad. And
[29:30] I'm glad we have ears to hear what the
[29:33] spirit's saying.
[29:36] And thou,
[29:38] oh Lord,

[30:26] Many are the demon spirits
[30:29] that rise against me.
[30:32] [Music]
[30:36] Many there be would say
[30:39] of my soul,
[30:45] there is no help for you and God.
[30:54] I cried unto the Lord with my voice.
[31:03] He heard me
[31:05] out of his holy hill.
[31:10] [Music]
[31:13] I laid me down and I slept.

[31:20] it was a precious, precious Holy Ghost
[31:25] sustain me.

[32:22] me.

[34:54] Thank Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[34:57] Heavenly Father, how grateful we are.
[35:01] Those words were pinned so many
[35:04] thousands of years ago
[35:07] of a man who had been in one straight
[35:10] after another. We know him as the
[35:13] psalmist David.
[35:16] He had been through hardships of enemies
[35:19] that were Philistines,
[35:21] Amorites, Hittites.
[35:25] He'd faced the challenges of his king,
[35:29] not an Amorite or a Hittite,
[35:32] but a Jew.
[35:34] His brothers had turned against him. his
[35:37] friends,
[35:40] the bulls of Bashan
[35:43] all around him, everywhere seemed to be
[35:46] enemies. But he was able to lift up his
[35:48] eyes towards you. We look around today,
[35:52] Father, and we realize that we're in a
[35:54] similar scenario.
[35:57] Defectors that have pulled away from
[35:59] this word and they hate us. They make
[36:03] videos against us. They spread lies on
[36:06] us. Even those of our own ranks who say
[36:10] they believe this word, yet they
[36:13] adulterate the word of God. We need you,
[36:17] Jesus.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Sickness, disease,
[36:21] political power, it's everywhere.
[36:24] Unrest, Father, we know there's only one
[36:28] hope, and that's the coming of the Lord
[36:32] Jesus. Amen.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; We pray that you'd be mindful of us
[36:35] today, Lord. No doubt the needs of your
[36:39] children today, not only in this visible
[36:41] assembly, but those around the world
[36:44] would be countless for us as mortals.
[36:47] But Father, we pray that you'd be
[36:49] mindful. Take this service and speak to
[36:52] us that which would be another building
[36:56] block, as it were, for our lives. For we
[36:59] know all creation is waiting on the
[37:02] finale, the grand finale of the church
[37:06] ages consummating
[37:08] and the image of Jesus Christ returning
[37:12] to the earth again. And it won't be in
[37:15] one man, won't be in one church, but
[37:18] it'll be around the world. Father, we
[37:21] pray may we by your grace be part of
[37:23] that great unfolding.
[37:26] You see our needs, our desires, our
[37:28] requests. Speak to us today, Father, by
[37:31] your word. Lord, you see this request I
[37:34] have my hand on. I ask you, dear God,
[37:35] that you'd move for our brethren. Many
[37:38] different ones, Lord, that's contacted
[37:40] in the last week or so from around the
[37:42] world with needs and requests and
[37:44] desires. I pray you'd be mindful, Lord,
[37:47] of your children today in the name of
[37:50] Jesus.
[37:52] Praise the Lord. How many's happy to be
[37:55] in the house of God?
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't it an honor for us?
[38:00] Privilege for us.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; And a great desire, too. It's not just a
[38:05] responsibility to come to the house of
[38:07] God. I love coming to the house of God,
[38:10] be with his children, to be in his
[38:12] presence. And I know you can't see them
[38:15] today, but angelic beings are all
[38:18] through this place.
[38:20] When brother Brandon was here, he would
[38:22] tell us that they would stand at the end
[38:24] of each row trying to anoint people's
[38:28] faith.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; And he would say, "There's also demons
[38:31] there." And he said, "There's a great
[38:33] battle going on." And he said, "The
[38:35] outcome of the battle will depend upon
[38:38] not the angels of God or the demons, but
[38:42] actually on you,
[38:43] &gt;&gt; which way your faith would go." So, we
[38:47] can believe that it'll just be a, you
[38:50] know, so regular old type of service and
[38:52] we just kind of endure the preaching and
[38:55] we'll um just be there for a little
[38:57] while and we'll go home or it can be one
[39:00] of such eternal consequence that our
[39:04] lives will be changed forever.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; It's kind of service I want myself.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let's read together
[39:12] today if you would our scripture that
[39:14] we've been looking at for quite some
[39:17] time.
[39:19] Second Peter chapter 1 verse two.
[39:22] One that has become so
[39:26] so precious and beloved to the hearts of
[39:28] the saints of God. I believe especially
[39:31] in this age knowing what God is desiring
[39:35] to build. Uh I want you to think of it
[39:38] that there could have never been another
[39:39] age even in the Ephesian age to where
[39:42] they would have desired the consummation
[39:45] of these scriptures to be fulfilled in
[39:47] their life in such a way. Peter and them
[39:50] couldn't have the fullness of what the
[39:52] cap was going to be in Leadyia because
[39:54] the time frame had not arrived yet.
[39:56] Neither could them pergamos thyus
[39:59] Philadelphia. But here we are. We are
[40:02] privileged by the grace of God. Not only
[40:05] facing all the demons, of course, it's
[40:07] accumulation of all those evil spirits,
[40:10] but also the mercy of God and the
[40:12] building of this great stature. Let's
[40:15] read it together. Second Peter 1:2.
[40:18] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[40:22] through the knowledge of God and of
[40:24] Jesus our Lord, according as his divine
[40:29] power. Thank you. hath given unto us all
[40:35] things that pertain unto life and
[40:39] godliness through the knowledge of him
[40:42] that has called us to glory and virtue,
[40:46] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[40:49] great and precious promises, that by
[40:54] these ye
[40:56] might be partakers of the divine nature.
[41:00] Nature, singular, only one divine
[41:04] nature.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Only one divine nature.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; That ye might be partakers of the divine
[41:12] nature, having escaped the corruption
[41:15] that is in the world through lust. And
[41:18] beside this, giving all diligence. Well,
[41:23] let me ask you as you're hearing this
[41:24] preached, are you giving all diligence
[41:29] &gt;&gt; or part or half? Or are you giving all
[41:33] diligence to be able to hear this and to
[41:36] be able to become it?
[41:38] Giving all diligence add to your faith
[41:41] virtue. And to virtue, knowledge, and to
[41:45] knowledge, temperance, and to
[41:48] temperance, patience, and to patience,
[41:52] godliness, which of course means to be
[41:55] like God.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; And to godliness, brotherly kindness.
[42:01] And to brotherly kindness,
[42:03] charity.
[42:05] Amen. May the Lord bless his word. You
[42:08] may be seated.
[42:13] Let us look at
[42:15] one of these awesome virtues today.
[42:19] Patience.
[42:21] More than likely, everybody here has all
[42:25] they need of patience.
[42:28] Except probably for me. Oh, Carol, I see
[42:33] Carol's hand. Sister Barbara with Key.
[42:36] I'm overwhelmed.
[42:39] Well, my goodness. And here I thought I
[42:41] was just studying this for me. I guess
[42:45] not, brother Ben.
[42:47] Patience.
[42:50] Patience.
[42:51] It's an awesome thing. Very needful
[42:54] thing. And in the worst of all ages, God
[42:59] is demanding an element of patience out
[43:03] of his people which can only be
[43:06] accomplished by the work of God in their
[43:08] lives. Now maybe some of you have an
[43:11] element of human patience and you would
[43:14] have more patience with people and with
[43:17] the world and things around you than
[43:20] some others. Others of us, you know, we
[43:22] may struggle with it. But no matter how
[43:25] great your human patience is, it still
[43:29] isn't enough to meet this requirement
[43:32] right here because this is godly
[43:37] patience. So my mama could not have
[43:41] attributed to me nor my daddy this type
[43:44] of patience. Now humanly I'm a pretty
[43:48] patient man. But that ain't enough. Now
[43:51] maybe some of you are more patient than
[43:53] I am. And you'd say, "Well, compared to
[43:56] brother Donnie, I'm very patient, but
[43:59] you're not comparing yourself to me
[44:02] &gt;&gt; and I'm not comparing myself to you."
[44:06] But to get the true measure of where we
[44:08] are and where we need to come up to, we
[44:12] need to measure oursel today by the
[44:15] stature of a perfect man, which as you
[44:19] know is not me and it's not you.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; Neither is it brother Brandham or Paul
[44:26] or Peter. But there was one man that was
[44:30] perfect and of course we all know who
[44:32] that was, right? So when Paul and Peter
[44:37] and James and Jesus and they begin to
[44:41] write about in the New Testament, James
[44:45] termed it, have you not heard of the
[44:48] patience of Job?
[44:51] Now, had James not wrote about that in
[44:54] that way, I wonder if we would have
[44:57] really brought into view Job's patience
[45:01] or would we have considered it Job's
[45:04] faith? Now, we give Job great credit
[45:08] because he was a man of great faith. But
[45:11] James did not focus on Job's faith, but
[45:15] he focused on Job's patience. faith can
[45:20] bring to pass great supernatural events
[45:23] in our life and we ain't got a nickels
[45:26] worth of patience.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; Now, this is the thing that's profound
[45:30] to me that a lot of people can come and
[45:33] be prayed for and they may have a
[45:35] miraculous type of faith. Uh there's
[45:38] people come through the prayer line that
[45:40] wasn't really even consecrated to God
[45:43] cuz I I know some of them and yet God
[45:46] moved for them in a supernatural way. I
[45:49] was reading of a testimony yesterday.
[45:50] Phenomenal what the Lord did. The person
[45:54] is really not even a a consecrated
[45:56] person in their life before God. Yet
[46:00] I've prayed for them different times.
[46:02] They don't really come to our church,
[46:03] but I prayed for them in different times
[46:06] and seeing God move for them because
[46:08] they have such faith that if men of God
[46:12] will pray for them that God will do
[46:14] something. And once again, the Lord did
[46:16] a great phenomenal thing right here last
[46:19] week for this particular individual. But
[46:22] yet, when it comes to faithfully being
[46:25] able to serve the Lord, it's like people
[46:29] cannot grasp a hold to that. I remember
[46:32] a man that I I've been around for years
[46:36] of my life. And every time that man
[46:39] would get sick, he would ask for a
[46:42] prayer cloth, one of my ties, one of my
[46:45] handkerchiefs, he would send me
[46:47] different garments for me to wear. So I
[46:51] would stick a tie in my pocket or, you
[46:53] know, whatever it was. And as soon as
[46:56] that man would get that prayer cross, no
[46:59] matter what was wrong with him and he
[47:01] was in the hospital multiple times, by
[47:04] the next day or at least the second day,
[47:07] he'd be checking out and going home
[47:09] well.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; But yet, the man could never come to a
[47:13] spot to where he was able to accept the
[47:17] Lord Jesus as his free partner of his
[47:20] sins and have a godly walk before God.
[47:24] So you think what did that kind of face
[47:28] what did it do for him? Well, it helped
[47:30] him along life's journey and it brought
[47:33] healing to him and help and maybe many
[47:35] of you know of people the same way. And
[47:38] there's people that we pray for and I
[47:40] always pray for them. You'll turn in
[47:42] prayer requests for your children.
[47:44] Remember my son, he's got this. Remember
[47:46] my daughter, she's got this. And I get
[47:48] every one of them. They're laid back on
[47:50] my desk. I take them home with me. I
[47:52] read them. I pray over them. And I know
[47:55] the child. I I know the daughter, the
[47:57] granddaughter, the son, whatever it is,
[47:59] the husband or the wife. And they're not
[48:01] really even professed believers yet. I
[48:05] pray for them with all of my heart
[48:08] because I know the Lord Jesus loves
[48:11] humanity. And what I pray for them in
[48:14] the sense is that God will not only
[48:16] bring healing to them, but may that be
[48:18] the avenue that they will see the grace
[48:22] of God brought them healing. And the
[48:24] same grace of God wants to bring
[48:26] complete deliverance to their soul and
[48:28] set them free from sin, which is really
[48:31] the greater salvation.
[48:34] But yet, if they can only experience
[48:36] healing in the body, I'm still going to
[48:39] pray for them. You say, "Why would you
[48:41] do that?" because that's the way my
[48:43] master did.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; You see, he didn't just bring healing to
[48:47] the saved people and to the people who
[48:49] had the Holy Ghost in the New Testament
[48:52] cuz there was only two people before it
[48:54] fell on the day of Pentecost that had
[48:56] had it and that was Jesus and John.
[48:59] Nobody else had the Holy Ghost yet. He
[49:01] prayed for them and he even used his
[49:04] power to heal them. Even though they
[49:07] never asked him for salvation, many of
[49:09] them didn't. But we we believe by the
[49:13] grace of God then that God wants our
[49:15] faith to be released in healing in
[49:18] miracles. Yes. And we're believing God
[49:21] for great supernatural. We have saints
[49:23] among us that need a move of God in
[49:25] their body. We do. But yet I also look
[49:28] at it in this aspect that God sometimes
[49:32] has to give people some people miracles
[49:35] because he knows their faith is not
[49:38] consistent and have a long endurance
[49:42] quality that will be able to wait maybe
[49:45] for years of their healing and they
[49:49] would give up absolutely give up if God
[49:53] does not do something for them quickly.
[49:56] But yet we look at that as being a
[49:58] greater measure of faith and many times
[50:01] we're looking at it wrong.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; We think that people with miraculous
[50:06] faith that they can touch God just like
[50:08] that and oh my, it is so phenomenal and
[50:11] it is wonderful. But yet what I admire
[50:14] is the faith of those people who believe
[50:17] God and they ask God and daily they're
[50:20] fighting. daily they're watering the
[50:22] promise of God and at the end result
[50:25] sometimes God will even say no to their
[50:28] request yet they still believe him with
[50:31] all of their heart.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Now the difference between those two
[50:36] type of people is this. One of them has
[50:40] faith with no patience. The other one
[50:43] has faith, but they also have the
[50:47] accompanied virtue of patience, which
[50:51] helps them to wait and faithfully
[50:54] endure. And they do not they do not give
[50:57] up on their faith even though they may
[50:59] not understand it, but they believe God
[51:02] with all their heart. So by that person
[51:04] God is displaying two great virtues at
[51:09] the same time both faith and patience.
[51:13] Now to the other we look at them which
[51:15] is mostly the ones that preachers like
[51:17] to give testimony about. You don't hear
[51:20] many preachers giving testimony about a
[51:22] person that had great patience and
[51:24] trusted God. But preachers want to use
[51:27] people that they laid their hands on and
[51:29] and and God did this and God did that
[51:32] and God did that for them. That's the
[51:34] one. You know what I'm talking about?
[51:35] Isn't that mostly the testimonies that
[51:37] we hear? How many testimonies do we hear
[51:40] though of people that are turned in that
[51:42] I was prayed for five years and I
[51:45] trusted God for five years and to this
[51:47] day God has never moved one speck of
[51:50] that thing out of my body. But I want to
[51:52] thank God today that I still believe him
[51:55] and I'm still trusting for his will to
[51:57] be done. Now, why don't we hear
[52:00] testimonies like that? Because somehow
[52:03] we don't think they are glorious. And
[52:07] I'll tell you what that is. It's still
[52:09] emerging of the carryover of Pentecost
[52:13] that's still in our message. Now, I know
[52:16] I've heard preachers around the message
[52:17] say, "Well, Pentecostals never give
[52:20] testimony." I find that to be amazing
[52:22] since the man who made that statement
[52:24] wasn't even in Pentecost and I was. I
[52:27] heard all the testimonies in Pentecost
[52:30] and I saw the magazines and I saw all
[52:33] the things they testified about and a
[52:35] lot of it was used to glorify preachers
[52:38] anyway. It wasn't really glorifying God.
[52:40] But I find it amazing then that people
[52:43] who can still keep right on believing,
[52:46] keep right on trusting and instead of
[52:48] getting better, sometimes they actually
[52:51] get worse. But it does not take away
[52:54] from their faith. Now in that type of an
[52:57] individual, God is actually bringing
[53:00] forth this other building block which is
[53:03] not apparent in just the person who has
[53:06] faith alone. Now let's look again at 2
[53:09] Peter chapter 1 6. And to knowledge
[53:13] temperance and to temperance patience.
[53:15] Now look at the meaning of this word. I
[53:18] know I use meanings a lot. And it's
[53:20] because I guess I'm a dummy and I just
[53:22] like to understand what the word means
[53:25] instead of just saying it for 135 years
[53:28] of my life and not understanding what it
[53:30] means. To me, it just gives me more
[53:32] understanding. Look at what the word
[53:34] patience means. enduring, patient
[53:38] continuence, patient waiting,
[53:42] steadfastness in the New Testament, the
[53:45] characteristic of a man who is not
[53:48] swerved from his deliberate purpose and
[53:52] his loyalty to faith and piety by even
[53:57] the greatest trials and suffering,
[54:00] patient and steadfast. Now I want you to
[54:03] notice what this virtue of patience will
[54:07] do. It couples itself with the other
[54:10] virtues that God is building. It's
[54:13] evident, friends, that many of our our
[54:15] believers around the message have fallen
[54:18] short of this great virtue of God
[54:22] because they get so discouraged when
[54:24] they're going through trials. Now, for
[54:26] some, their patience may be tried in a
[54:29] physical realm. But I wonder as I was
[54:32] thinking about this morning before I
[54:33] came to church if maybe some of our
[54:35] young people in our church and some of
[54:37] the ones around the message that their
[54:39] patience may not be tried so much in a
[54:42] physical healing. But could their
[54:45] patience be tried in waiting for the
[54:48] right mate that they pray for this boy,
[54:52] Prince Charming, to come in their life?
[54:54] And this and their brothers will wait
[54:56] for this beautiful daughter of God to
[54:59] come in that'll just sweep them off of
[55:01] their feet and whatever they think that
[55:03] she's supposed to do. And they may have
[55:05] to pray and wait and pray. And during
[55:08] that time that they are waiting, Satan
[55:11] will send them one after another after
[55:14] another, maybe a denominational boy or
[55:17] girl that they meet at their work, their
[55:19] employment, and they'll say, "Oh, that's
[55:21] such a nice person, and they are a
[55:24] Christian, but how are they baptized to
[55:26] believe the word of God in its
[55:28] fullness?" Come on, somebody.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; And will you wait patiently, my sister?
[55:34] Will you wait patiently, my brother, for
[55:37] God to put in your life that one that
[55:40] he's ordained for you to have? Or will
[55:43] you compromise and settle for something
[55:46] less than what the Lord wants you to
[55:48] have and then pay the rest of your life
[55:52] for marrying somebody that may never
[55:55] believe the same word that you believe?
[55:59] Now, if you don't believe me, you might
[56:01] ask around for some of the people in our
[56:03] church because I have to deal with it
[56:06] all the time of people who have not
[56:09] married a believer and they are still
[56:12] dealing with it to this day because of a
[56:15] choice they made years ago. And their
[56:18] companion don't come to church. Their
[56:20] companion haunts them and taunts them
[56:23] and argues and everything in the world.
[56:26] Why? because they did not wait patiently
[56:29] for the Lord to put the right one in
[56:31] their life. And listen, I I don't say
[56:33] this joyfully today. I say it was pain
[56:36] in my heart because I've had to deal
[56:39] with people for decades around the world
[56:42] that jumped ahead of the will of God and
[56:45] got the wrong one instead of waiting
[56:47] patiently. So my sisters, my brothers,
[56:50] it is well worth your weight to wait
[56:53] upon God and let God give to you the one
[56:57] that he wants you to have. And the
[57:00] church said,
[57:01] &gt;&gt; "Well, you see that this patience that
[57:03] we're referring to today is not my
[57:06] patience modified or your patience just
[57:10] kind of worked on a little bit." But
[57:12] what we want to look at is that this is
[57:14] actually the patience of Jesus Christ
[57:18] himself. This is his own divine nature
[57:23] that is divided up in this sevenfold
[57:27] manifestation that he will choose to
[57:30] build a bride of out of seven church
[57:32] ages. And in this last stage, of course,
[57:34] we get all seven. But it also means that
[57:38] we also have the sevenfold manifestation
[57:41] of the demonic power that's being
[57:43] released all around us. And the church
[57:46] should be able to say
[57:47] &gt;&gt; amen.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it it's it's unlike anything
[57:51] that's ever been on the earth before. So
[57:54] keep in mind we're talking about the
[57:55] faith of Jesus, the virtue of Jesus, the
[57:58] knowledge of Jesus. So the patience of
[58:01] Jesus Christ. So it's beyond mine. It's
[58:04] beyond yours. There's no way for us to
[58:06] even be able to compare to what he has.
[58:10] Now in this it is a person that God will
[58:14] move them up this building block. They
[58:17] will have faith which is the beginning
[58:20] foundation. Fourthly is this great
[58:23] virtue which will again separate the
[58:26] bride from the church. So the church can
[58:29] pray and they can wait for a little
[58:31] season and then they become warned and
[58:34] through the trials and the tests and
[58:36] they just simply give up. But to a real
[58:38] member of the body of Christ, they are
[58:41] building a stature. And they know
[58:43] they're not where they were. And they
[58:46] know they're not where they used to
[58:48] where they want to be, but they know
[58:50] they're somewhere in this sevenstep
[58:53] pyramid longing for the time when God
[58:56] will complete in them what they're
[58:58] asking for. I hope that's where we are
[59:00] this morning. Now, I want you to notice
[59:02] this in the statue of a perfect man that
[59:04] the prophet said, "Then add to that
[59:07] forthly we add patience to your faith."
[59:10] Now, if you've got faith, it workketh
[59:13] patience. The Bible said, see, so this
[59:16] is patience. Now, that's the next thing
[59:19] that's going to build this statue. You
[59:21] know, God's got real material in his
[59:26] building. See how short we are,
[59:28] brethren? see why where we're at. Yes,
[59:31] sir. We have glory,
[59:35] you have shouts and things because we've
[59:40] got faith.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; And if we're not careful, we're coming
[59:44] right back around again to where the
[59:47] church was in 1962.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Now, see, in 1962,
[59:53] this is where they were. They had glory
[59:57] because they had shouts and healing and
[1:00:01] miracles and signs.
[1:00:04] And yet the prophet did not say God was
[1:00:07] satisfied with where they were.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Well, if God wasn't satisfied in 62, how
[1:00:13] can he be satisfied in 2025?
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; If we stop there, thank God for the
[1:00:18] glory. Thank God for the shouts. Thank
[1:00:21] God for the healing. But the stature of
[1:00:23] a perfect man is built out of more than
[1:00:28] faith.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Bon said he saw prostitutes come
[1:00:32] through the prayer line and get healed.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Prostitutes.
[1:00:37] He would call one after another out by
[1:00:40] discernment and say, "You've got great
[1:00:42] faith to be a sinner."
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Well, you say, "Brother Donnie, how
[1:00:48] could that be? Look at every one of them
[1:00:49] in the New Testament. In the days of the
[1:00:52] Lord Jesus, when he talked about them
[1:00:54] having great faith, there wasn't a one
[1:00:56] of them that was even born again. The
[1:00:58] new birth had not come yet. So, a person
[1:01:01] could have great faith and still not be
[1:01:05] born again. Now, watch. He says, you
[1:01:08] see, we have glory. We have shouts and
[1:01:10] things because we got faith. But when we
[1:01:12] come down to this here, God can't build
[1:01:16] us into that stature. Faith alone will
[1:01:20] never do it. Virtue will never do it.
[1:01:23] See, he can't make us up to that kind of
[1:01:25] a place. We've got all these other
[1:01:27] things and we fall and slide off with
[1:01:30] it. He can't build his church. Oh my.
[1:01:35] Patience with what? What kind of
[1:01:38] patience? The first thing is have
[1:01:41] patience with God.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Patience with God. How many believes
[1:01:49] God?
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; How many has patience with God?
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Ah, not near as many hands. Why am I not
[1:01:58] surprised?
[1:02:00] So, we believe that faith alone will do
[1:02:04] it. No, you see, we're a different
[1:02:08] category than the church. We are in the
[1:02:12] making of bride material, which is the
[1:02:16] finished body of Jesus Christ himself.
[1:02:20] Anyone who knows the scripture, the
[1:02:22] prophet said, knows the body of Jesus is
[1:02:26] not yet complete.
[1:02:28] So he's working on it now on the earth
[1:02:32] for people that will believe by faith
[1:02:34] like he did and they will have virtue
[1:02:37] like he had and knowledge like he had
[1:02:40] and patience like he had. You see, Jesus
[1:02:44] himself as high priest needed patience
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; not only with Peter, James, and John,
[1:02:53] but with Donnie, Jackie,
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Keith, Freddy, Rob.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Anybody got enough boldness to raise
[1:03:02] your hand and say, "And with me."
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; And with me. He needs patience with all
[1:03:10] of us. So whenever we then by virtue of
[1:03:14] his nature start receiving these
[1:03:17] attributes, he's rebuilding himself in
[1:03:21] multiplied human forms on the earth. So
[1:03:25] it's more than casting out devils,
[1:03:26] healing the sick. You see, if these
[1:03:29] things are in you, they make you that
[1:03:32] you are perfect and will never fail.
[1:03:35] Faith alone won't do that. Matthew 24,
[1:03:39] Jesus tells us there will be those that
[1:03:41] will stand before him that day and say,
[1:03:43] "I cast out devils in your name." There
[1:03:45] will be people that sit there and said,
[1:03:47] "I raised the dead. I healed the sick.
[1:03:49] I've done this, that, and the other."
[1:03:50] How could they do it with faith? And
[1:03:53] come to find out there's running around
[1:03:54] with somebody else's wife or didn't
[1:03:57] preach the real full truth. Amen. Why?
[1:04:00] Because you can have part of it. I don't
[1:04:02] want just part. I want everything that
[1:04:06] God wants me to have. I want my image to
[1:04:10] reflect not only you. Now look friend,
[1:04:12] we don't want to be like Lot. Compare
[1:04:15] Lot to Sodom. He was a righteous man.
[1:04:18] Compare Lot to Abraham, it's like
[1:04:22] comparing a penny to a silver dollar.
[1:04:25] So if we are the Abraham group, we
[1:04:29] cannot take our penny attributes, our
[1:04:33] penny virtue, our penny temperance, our
[1:04:37] penny patience and compare it to Abraham
[1:04:41] and say we are the seed of Abraham.
[1:04:44] [Applause]
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; First thing is to have patience
[1:04:52] with God. If you've got real genuine
[1:04:55] faith, you'll have genuine patience
[1:04:58] because faith workketh patience. When
[1:05:01] God says anything, you believe it.
[1:05:04] That's all. You got patience. Say,
[1:05:06] "Well, I asked him last night to heal
[1:05:09] me, and I'm just as sick this morning."
[1:05:12] Oh my, what patience God told Abraham
[1:05:17] and 25 years later
[1:05:20] there wasn't even one sign.
[1:05:25] But you see, we attribute all of that to
[1:05:28] Abraham's faith.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; But that is wrong.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; It was not just Abraham's faith.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; It was Abraham's
[1:05:38] patience. His faith believed, but his
[1:05:44] patience kept him persistent in his
[1:05:47] believing. Can't you see what God wants
[1:05:50] us to be? So he adds and adds and adds
[1:05:53] and adds. And when those virtues are
[1:05:56] being burst inside of us, we will have
[1:05:59] absolutely everything in the completion.
[1:06:02] Remember, God is completed in number
[1:06:04] seven. So when God builds in us every
[1:06:08] one of these virtues himself, we will
[1:06:11] have absolutely everything we need for
[1:06:14] the changing of our bodies.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Notice James as I
[1:06:22] mentioned about Job. James 5:1. Behold,
[1:06:26] we count them happy which endure. Ye
[1:06:31] have heard of the patience of Job, the
[1:06:36] patience of Job, and have seen the end
[1:06:41] of the Lord, that the Lord is very
[1:06:45] pitiful and of tender mercy. So, Job had
[1:06:51] faith, and his faith put him to that
[1:06:54] spot where he could believe God. But it
[1:06:56] wasn't just Job's face that kept him
[1:06:59] through all the hardships and the trials
[1:07:01] that he went through. It was his face
[1:07:04] coupled with his patience.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; He did not understand. He could not
[1:07:11] comprehend. It made no sense. But yet
[1:07:14] his faith believed God. But his faith
[1:07:18] could only take him so far. Unless it
[1:07:21] was coupled with patience. Then go. Oh,
[1:07:25] you imagine Job with that great thing.
[1:07:28] What a what an outstanding thing. It
[1:07:30] must have been to James that James would
[1:07:32] write it this way that ye have heard of
[1:07:36] the patience of Job. Yeah. What's
[1:07:39] amazing is whenever you look at it,
[1:07:41] James was the first one to relate to it
[1:07:43] quite this way. So it was the patience
[1:07:46] of Job reflected through the 42
[1:07:49] chapters, whatever it was, but not by
[1:07:52] name. It was more so by action than it
[1:07:56] was by name.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Notice, oh my. The prophet said, "Look
[1:08:03] at Job." And he was fighting so hard.
[1:08:06] His wife, even his wife, his companion,
[1:08:10] even her breast has become strange.
[1:08:12] Amen. You talking about hard. I cannot
[1:08:16] imagine going through just what little
[1:08:18] bit that I went through as a Christian,
[1:08:20] as a minister, without my wife standing
[1:08:23] there with me, to help me, to pray for
[1:08:26] me, to encourage me, on and on and on.
[1:08:30] And can you brothers that have a godly
[1:08:32] wife like that, can you imagine having
[1:08:35] one like Job had? And whenever you're
[1:08:38] going through your greatest trial that
[1:08:41] she comes to you and says, "Curse God
[1:08:45] and die."
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; You're believing in vain, Job. Well,
[1:08:49] look, you've lived for God. You've
[1:08:51] served God. And look what God has done
[1:08:54] for her. The very woman that bore your
[1:08:57] children. Now no doubt she had developed
[1:09:00] some resentment because remember their
[1:09:03] children all of that was taken away. Job
[1:09:07] was a man of great notoriety in his day,
[1:09:10] of great fame, fortune, wealth. And no
[1:09:14] doubt this had affected not only Job,
[1:09:16] but it had affected her. And Job had
[1:09:20] entered into the state of what doctors,
[1:09:22] many of them today, diagnose as
[1:09:24] elephantitis,
[1:09:25] where that Job has swollen up. And they
[1:09:29] say that because a person's legs and
[1:09:31] their torso, their body and hands and
[1:09:33] arms and so on, they swell and swell and
[1:09:37] swell until they burst and will start
[1:09:40] running open and oozing out the pus and
[1:09:44] their skin becomes real wrinkled and
[1:09:47] looks similar to an elephant's skin and
[1:09:50] they they develop this terrible stench
[1:09:54] coming out of their body. You imagine
[1:09:56] every time she went to take him a little
[1:09:59] something to eat or to try to even check
[1:10:01] on him to see how he was, she'd have to
[1:10:04] hold her nose and say, "Job, I can't
[1:10:08] believe you. You've sinned. There's
[1:10:11] something wrong. His friends come." And
[1:10:14] whenever the Bible says they came, that
[1:10:16] they sat there and looked at him for
[1:10:18] several days and never uttered one word.
[1:10:23] They saw him a far off sitting out on
[1:10:26] the yard or maybe the porch and they
[1:10:29] didn't even recognize who the man was.
[1:10:32] And then when they did come up and start
[1:10:35] talking to him, they had not one word of
[1:10:37] encouragement. Not one thing, oh dear
[1:10:40] brother, we're so sorry that you're
[1:10:42] going through this. Not one person was
[1:10:46] sent there to encourage. We jump to the
[1:10:49] end of the book of Job. And when God
[1:10:51] turned the trial around and gave Job
[1:10:54] back children and gave him back his
[1:10:57] inheritance, then the Bible tells us
[1:11:00] that his family came back around.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; And each one of them brought him a piece
[1:11:06] of money.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, they did.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; I've had a few family members like that.
[1:11:13] Anybody else?
[1:11:15] Why didn't they bring it, brother Dave?
[1:11:17] When he needed it.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; But instead of them bringing the money
[1:11:22] when he needed it and had nothing, God
[1:11:26] allowed even his family to turn against
[1:11:30] him.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; And his wife turned against him. Not one
[1:11:35] human being on the earth. He said, "I I
[1:11:38] beckon my servants and they would not
[1:11:41] come. I asked for my companions. They
[1:11:45] would not come and God wouldn't come.
[1:11:50] Job cried and he prayed. He believed
[1:11:53] God. But it wasn't just his faith that
[1:11:57] got him through.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; It was his patience.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; So Job was trusting God even though he
[1:12:05] did not understand. I wonder if
[1:12:08] anybody's ever been there.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, sure you have.
[1:12:12] his wife come and said, "Oh, Job, you
[1:12:14] look miserable. Why don't you just curse
[1:12:17] God?
[1:12:19] Die the death." He said, "Woman, thou
[1:12:23] speakest like a foolish woman." Uhhuh.
[1:12:26] Oh my. What a hero.
[1:12:30] What a hero. I wonder sometimes.
[1:12:34] Heroes of faith. Will they all be
[1:12:37] miracle workers? Will they all be those
[1:12:41] that have great attributes and great
[1:12:44] testimonies? I prayed for this person
[1:12:46] and they got well. I prayed for this
[1:12:48] one. If you'll read Hebrews 11, you'll
[1:12:50] find out most of them heroes of faith,
[1:12:53] they struggled. They tried. They went
[1:12:56] through hard times in their life. They
[1:12:59] are not made attributes of the heroes of
[1:13:02] faith by the multitude of the prayers
[1:13:04] that God answered, but rather the ones
[1:13:08] that he didn't.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; But they believed him anyhow.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; I hope somebody's listening to me this
[1:13:16] morning.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Notice, oh my, even Jesus referred to
[1:13:23] him. Have you not heard of the patience
[1:13:27] of Job? Job went down in the harness.
[1:13:32] Abraham went down in the harness. Yes,
[1:13:34] sir. Isaac went down in the harness.
[1:13:37] Joseph went down in the harness. But we
[1:13:41] don't want the harness, do we? We all
[1:13:43] want to be Kentucky thoroughbredads
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; where we come up on the pness of course
[1:13:49] and we come up on derby day and we want
[1:13:52] the roses laid around us and we want
[1:13:55] accolades and craz praise of men. We
[1:13:58] don't want no harness.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; We want roses.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; speak Lord. I'll hear you.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Now, this man being a prophet, he
[1:14:12] had access to God's grace. But Job
[1:14:15] didn't have a Bible to read. The Bible
[1:14:17] wasn't wrote then, but he had access to
[1:14:20] God by revelation. Now, remember, he
[1:14:23] could not go into St. John 15:7 and
[1:14:27] place his finger on the scripture. If
[1:14:29] you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:14:31] you, ask what you will. He could not go
[1:14:34] to Psalm 37. Delight thyself also in the
[1:14:38] Lord, and he will give thee the desires
[1:14:40] of thine heart. 1 Peter 2:24, by his
[1:14:44] stripes we are healed. Isaiah 7, that he
[1:14:48] bore the chastisement of our peace. He
[1:14:51] had no Bible to be able to go to. His
[1:14:54] only communication to God was divine
[1:14:58] revelation.
[1:15:00] And God had shut it down.
[1:15:06] had no tapes to listen to. No pastor
[1:15:11] that would be listening to a tape. And
[1:15:14] when he heard this quote, this one, this
[1:15:16] one, this one, he would copy paste, copy
[1:15:18] paste, copy paste, and send it to fellow
[1:15:21] ministers or sheep in his church that
[1:15:24] were going through trials. He had no
[1:15:27] email where anybody could say, "Brother
[1:15:29] Joe, I've been hearing about what you're
[1:15:32] going through. God bless you, brother.
[1:15:35] He had no WhatsApp like I did this
[1:15:37] morning. From a brother in India where
[1:15:41] him and his entire church was praying
[1:15:44] for us because they love us because
[1:15:47] we've affected their lives. I wonder
[1:15:50] what Job would have give for that one
[1:15:52] WhatsApp.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:57] And even God shut down the flow of
[1:16:01] revelation.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; You have heard of the patience of Job.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; You have heard of the patience of Job.
[1:16:15] Now he says that was before the Bible
[1:16:17] was written. Now we find out, take some
[1:16:20] of his life when God blessed him, made
[1:16:22] him a great man. Why even everybody
[1:16:25] respected him even to his wisdom become
[1:16:27] so great his inspiration. Oh my. You
[1:16:30] talking about glory. My people would
[1:16:33] come up and he was up in some years of
[1:16:36] course. And he said whenever he'd go
[1:16:38] into the marketplace the people would
[1:16:41] just come in and said listen listen at
[1:16:43] him. Wow
[1:16:46] what words. And God would allow him to
[1:16:49] speak things and other great wise men
[1:16:51] would sat there said profound. Who ever
[1:16:54] heard of such things. It was so
[1:16:57] incredible. And they just listen and
[1:16:59] write it down and taking notes what Job
[1:17:01] was saying. They said, "Oh my, what a
[1:17:04] man. Boy, when I grow up, I hope I get
[1:17:06] to be a man like that."
[1:17:09] And then all of a sudden, one day, Job's
[1:17:12] kids died. A tragedy hit his home.
[1:17:16] Tragedy hit his family, lost his loved
[1:17:18] ones, lost his wealth, lost everything
[1:17:21] he had,
[1:17:23] and also lost respect, honor, and trust.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; So, what would you do if God had a job
[1:17:33] in this message that he wanted to try
[1:17:35] even in onetenth of the measure that he
[1:17:38] tried Job?
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Would you say he's a secret sinner?
[1:17:42] There's something going on in his life.
[1:17:45] Uh oh, we see it now. We've known it all
[1:17:49] along. Them backwards discerners, you
[1:17:52] know. Oh, I've always known there was
[1:17:55] something funny about him. You'll go to
[1:17:57] hell for lying.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Nobody,
[1:18:04] not even God.
[1:18:09] God did not come down by an angelic
[1:18:12] visitation and surround him when he was
[1:18:15] praying and taking a croc. Anybody know
[1:18:18] what it was? A piece of of broken
[1:18:21] pottery. And Job would take that piece
[1:18:24] of a croc and set down on the outside
[1:18:27] cuz he'd stink up the house so bad. and
[1:18:30] he'd take that piece of croc and scrape
[1:18:33] his boils and the pus and the dead skin
[1:18:36] because with elephant Titus the skin
[1:18:38] dies. Oh, it must have been sickening to
[1:18:42] smell him to be around him.
[1:18:46] And yet God from heaven's point of view
[1:18:49] said he's the greatest man on the earth.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Not one thing has changed. As a matter
[1:18:55] of fact, I'm giving him more favor now
[1:18:57] than he's ever had.
[1:18:59] Well, let me just be quite frank and
[1:19:01] honest with you. I don't like that kind
[1:19:04] of favor.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Only difference between me and you is
[1:19:08] I'm being honest and you're sitting
[1:19:09] there being pious and and not saying
[1:19:11] amen cuz you're lying between your
[1:19:13] teeth.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; They know one of you wants to be able to
[1:19:16] do this same thing that Job did. And
[1:19:18] boy, then likely we'll never have to.
[1:19:21] But all of us are going to be tried. Our
[1:19:25] patience will be tried. And sometimes
[1:19:28] God tries it so he can show us where we
[1:19:31] are. Look, son, you need to be here, but
[1:19:34] you're only here.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; And then Satan began to accuse that man.
[1:19:45] That's the way he does every inspired
[1:19:47] servant of God. Satan
[1:19:50] is always there to accuse him of
[1:19:52] everything that he does that's not
[1:19:54] right. Now we find out his life and his
[1:19:57] trials and his great faith. Even Jesus
[1:20:01] referred to the patience of Job. Faith
[1:20:04] waits. What a statement.
[1:20:07] Faith waits with
[1:20:11] patience.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Now this is not the miraculous outburst
[1:20:17] of faith that produces miracles.
[1:20:21] This is the slow grinding daytoday faith
[1:20:26] that can become monotonous to children
[1:20:29] of God.
[1:20:31] Oh my special meetings that have prayer
[1:20:34] line coming through. Boy, faith climbing
[1:20:36] high and riding through the raptures.
[1:20:39] Boy, people say, "Oh, glory to God. I
[1:20:41] wish I could live in a special meeting
[1:20:43] like that." They wouldn't be special to
[1:20:45] you very long. After a few weeks, they
[1:20:47] become as monotonous as the regular
[1:20:49] church services are. That's why we call
[1:20:51] them special cuz they are special. But
[1:20:54] it's not that type of faith that will
[1:20:57] give you that victory of overcoming
[1:21:00] every day of your life. It's not that
[1:21:03] faith of going to a young uh a youth
[1:21:05] camp young people and say, "Boy, if I
[1:21:07] could only live there." God don't want
[1:21:10] you to live there. God wants you to live
[1:21:13] down here where every day you've got to
[1:21:16] put one foot in front of the other and
[1:21:18] you don't feel the great anointing and
[1:21:21] yet you say, "Although he slay me, I'll
[1:21:24] trust him."
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; My, this ought to be something that you
[1:21:34] write down and keep near you. Faith
[1:21:37] waits for patience
[1:21:40] for the promised word to be fulfilled.
[1:21:44] Again, he says, "And I've heard, but now
[1:21:45] I see." Now, we notice here that Job, I
[1:21:48] just went through his trials. All of his
[1:21:51] afflictions had a lovely family. They
[1:21:54] were taken from him. Now, some of you
[1:21:57] have lost maybe one family member that
[1:21:59] was very close.
[1:22:02] Can you imagine all your sons and
[1:22:04] daughters being taken at one time?
[1:22:14] One morning you're this wealthy
[1:22:17] individual, the richest man in all the
[1:22:20] land of us, and the next morning you're
[1:22:23] flat broke.
[1:22:25] Not only that, but your body becomes
[1:22:28] afflicted. you're a man of great honor
[1:22:30] and prestige
[1:22:32] and then people hold their nose around
[1:22:35] you. Well, they may not hold their nose
[1:22:38] around us in the natural sense, but
[1:22:41] because we follow this message, they
[1:22:44] hold their nose spiritually. Oh, a cult.
[1:22:49] You all stink.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; You all are low down and rotten. Y'all
[1:22:53] are following a man. Everybody is
[1:22:55] following a man. It just depends on
[1:22:57] which one you're following.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. Everybody's following somebody.
[1:23:07] So, we today are bearing the stench.
[1:23:12] The stench and the smell
[1:23:16] of what the world wants to say. A cult.
[1:23:19] Crazy. They're a bunch of nuts.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Well, we'll find out shortly.
[1:23:25] Yes, sir.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; I said, "We going to find out shortly."
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Tim Plu sent me a video this
[1:23:34] morning.
[1:23:36] It was his daughter and her husband
[1:23:41] trying out a Tesla car.
[1:23:46] They typed in on the computer the
[1:23:48] address.
[1:23:50] His daughter is sitting on the driver's
[1:23:52] side. No hands on the wheel.
[1:23:56] The car comes up to a stop sign or a
[1:23:59] light and then it eased itself up a
[1:24:02] little bit more cuz it couldn't see the
[1:24:04] ride away and then it took off by
[1:24:07] itself. And you can hear her in the
[1:24:09] video saying, "Oh, it's getting close.
[1:24:11] That makes me nervous."
[1:24:14] Who would have ever thought we did?
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God showed a vindicated
[1:24:22] prophet decades and decades ago, a
[1:24:26] family going down the road sitting in a
[1:24:30] car that was driving itself.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Well, come on, somebody. You are living
[1:24:39] in an hour when God's word has come to
[1:24:43] pass.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This day, this vision is
[1:24:51] being fulfilled right before your eyes.
[1:24:57] I've mentioned to you before, Brother
[1:24:59] Rob Weber had one of them cars and
[1:25:01] somebody stood out there with him. He
[1:25:03] got his little whatever it was out
[1:25:05] remote or gadget or whatever and
[1:25:07] beckoned that car to drive out of the
[1:25:11] parking lot and come and pick him up.
[1:25:17] this day, this vision is fulfilled.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:23] Oh, when I see that pope rise up out of
[1:25:28] the United States, no matter how
[1:25:31] impossible, the historians of the
[1:25:34] Catholic Church said it will never
[1:25:37] happen this day. This word has come to
[1:25:42] pass.
[1:25:45] Oh, glory to God. So also will this word
[1:25:50] come to pass. You will be standing and
[1:25:53] all of a sudden a sweep will come over
[1:25:56] you and you will see your loved ones and
[1:26:00] you know it won't be long. You're going
[1:26:03] to be changed.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; How are we waiting for it? Faith
[1:26:18] coupled with patience.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:26:29] Notice again it says we notice here that
[1:26:31] Job after he went through the trials,
[1:26:34] all of his afflictions, lovely family
[1:26:37] taken from him, had good health taken
[1:26:41] from him.
[1:26:43] Everything that he'd owned in his life
[1:26:46] was taken.
[1:26:50] And he sat on a hash heap with a piece
[1:26:53] of croc
[1:26:55] scraping his boils.
[1:26:58] Even to his own wife spoke against him
[1:27:00] and said, "Why not curse God and die?"
[1:27:03] He said, "Thou speakest like a foolish
[1:27:05] virgin."
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "The Lord gave and the Lord
[1:27:15] taken away." Praise the Lord.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; For those of you that are still dealing
[1:27:24] with loss, praise will help you reach
[1:27:28] the finale.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; So the world may know,
[1:27:38] let them hear my voice.
[1:27:41] The Lord gave my wife and I
[1:27:46] our youngest daughter. The Lord gave her
[1:27:51] and the Lord took her away.
[1:27:55] And what is our response, Carol? Blessed
[1:27:58] be the name of the Lord. You want to
[1:28:03] know how I've made it through this
[1:28:04] trial? I praise my way through this
[1:28:07] trial. I've not had self-pity. I've not
[1:28:10] felt sorry for myself. Lord, how come
[1:28:13] this how come that that won't get you
[1:28:16] anywhere? But there is great power in
[1:28:20] being able to praise your way when you
[1:28:23] can't pay your bills. Praise your way
[1:28:25] through sickness. Praise your way
[1:28:28] through trial. Praise your way through
[1:28:30] mind battles. And say, "The Lord is
[1:28:33] here.
[1:28:44] You see, Job was unaware
[1:28:47] of this statement right here.
[1:28:51] Satan had come up before God cuz he
[1:28:53] could come up before him and accuse the
[1:28:56] Christians or the believers.
[1:28:58] So he accused Job of many things
[1:29:02] and said that Job the reason he served
[1:29:04] God was cuz everything was coming good
[1:29:07] for him.
[1:29:09] But he said if you'll just let me have
[1:29:11] him in my hands,
[1:29:13] I'll make him curse you to your face.
[1:29:19] I want you to notice the confidence
[1:29:22] that God
[1:29:25] had in a believer.
[1:29:27] Ain't it something that we have
[1:29:29] confidence in God? But God wants to have
[1:29:33] confidence in us.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of Christian I want to
[1:29:38] be, friends.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; How many wants to be that kind of a
[1:29:42] child of God that God can say, "I've got
[1:29:45] confidence in my daughter. I've got
[1:29:47] confidence in my son, Satan. I will take
[1:29:51] this from him and that from him, and I
[1:29:53] tell you before it happens, they will
[1:29:55] not turn away. They will love me. They
[1:29:57] will serve me. How can God say that?
[1:29:59] Because you are a spoken word from God.
[1:30:02] And God is simply referring back to his
[1:30:04] spoken word about your being. And he
[1:30:06] knows the poor old dumb devil ain't got
[1:30:08] enough sense to know. He's dealing with
[1:30:10] the preeminent one. He's dealing with
[1:30:12] the one that has omniscence and
[1:30:14] omnipresent. And he can look back to
[1:30:16] you, hallelujah, before the foundation
[1:30:18] of the world and say, "I don't care what
[1:30:20] you do. He is my son. She is my
[1:30:23] daughter. There's nothing you can do.
[1:30:26] There's nothing you can take away from
[1:30:28] them that'll make them turn away. I give
[1:30:30] them my word.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice the confidence that
[1:30:41] God has in a believer. In other words,
[1:30:44] God said to Satan like this,
[1:30:48] "You can't do it.
[1:30:50] You can't do it.
[1:30:52] He's a justified man. He's a good man.
[1:30:57] Now, that's something to me. Oh, I hear
[1:30:59] all kinds of people say, "Oh, this is a
[1:31:00] good person. That's a good person.
[1:31:02] That's a good person. That's a good
[1:31:03] person." It's easy for you to say. You
[1:31:04] might not even know him. But when God
[1:31:07] says he's a good man, that's a good man.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; I said, "That's a good man."
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. In other words, God
[1:31:18] said to Satan, you can't do it. He's a
[1:31:21] just man, justified. He's a good man.
[1:31:24] There's none like him in the whole
[1:31:25] earth. Oh, what a man
[1:31:30] that God himself would say to his enemy.
[1:31:34] Now, if Job fails, the whole reputation
[1:31:36] of God is ruined for the rest of time.
[1:31:45] Have you ever recommended somebody
[1:31:49] for a job or for this or that or the
[1:31:52] other and you wished you hadn't have?
[1:31:56] Some of you have, but you're just quiet.
[1:31:58] You're afraid to even bat an eye, ain't
[1:31:59] you? I can't help it if it was if it was
[1:32:02] your uncle Jim or Aunt Vinnie or whoever
[1:32:04] it was. It's truth. And you get to where
[1:32:07] a spot, you know, people to me, brother
[1:32:09] Donnie, you know this preacher, you
[1:32:10] heard this guy, you heard this guy. What
[1:32:12] about this guy? We're saying about
[1:32:13] moving, relocating over to this church.
[1:32:15] What do you know about him, Brother Don?
[1:32:16] What about I say, um um
[1:32:20] uh
[1:32:22] the last time I heard he was okay.
[1:32:28] That was two days ago.
[1:32:31] You get to where you don't know where to
[1:32:33] recommend anybody or not.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; But God didn't say to the devil,
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; "That's right.
[1:32:41] Can I get back with you on that?
[1:32:46] It bursted out of his being.
[1:32:50] Oh,
[1:32:55] hallelujah.
[1:32:58] I help.
[1:33:00] Why
[1:33:02] you've been fellowshipping with him?
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:33:13] God, give us more Jobes.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; We're going to have a job prayer line
[1:33:17] after this this morning.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. Even Carol want him
[1:33:22] getting that one. See, she's shaking her
[1:33:25] head. No.
[1:33:27] Oh my,
[1:33:29] my servant is so perfect. There's not
[1:33:31] another man on the earth like him. Oh,
[1:33:33] if we could only be that kind of a man
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; that God could bestow that confidence
[1:33:41] upon us
[1:33:45] that know that we'll not twist from his
[1:33:49] word or his being
[1:33:55] anyway.
[1:33:57] say exactly and he can put his trust
[1:34:02] in us.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:34:07] Help me Jesus.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Help me Jesus.
[1:34:16] when a man or a person has once really
[1:34:18] come in contact with God
[1:34:23] and that genuine faith that God is been
[1:34:26] revealed that God is there's nothing no
[1:34:30] time nowhere
[1:34:33] can ever separate that man
[1:34:36] from his God. That's right.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; I believe it was Paul that said,
[1:34:42] "There's no strife, no hunger, no
[1:34:44] perils, neither living creatures or
[1:34:46] death or anything that can separate us
[1:34:49] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:34:51] Jesus. You are securely anchored in him
[1:34:55] because you were ordained to that life."
[1:34:59] Job with his perfect revelation of God
[1:35:02] and who God was and how God loved him.
[1:35:05] He waited
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; no matter what the circumstances was. He
[1:35:10] waited for his faith
[1:35:14] to be confirmed.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Faith the long one do it. How did he
[1:35:19] wait, brother Jim? Patience.
[1:35:22] His patience coupled with his faith. And
[1:35:25] his faith, I believe it. I believe it. I
[1:35:27] believe it. and his patience said, "Keep
[1:35:29] believing. Keep believing." That's
[1:35:31] talking back and forth. That's
[1:35:32] communicating back and forth to each
[1:35:34] other. Faithful said, "God's real. God's
[1:35:36] true." And and his confidence and his
[1:35:38] patience in God. That's right. God's
[1:35:40] true. How long are you going to wait?
[1:35:42] I'm going to wait until it comes to
[1:35:43] pass. And if I'll tell you one thing, if
[1:35:46] he don't heal me, if I die, though the
[1:35:48] skin worms eat my body, yet in my flesh,
[1:35:51] I will see God.
[1:35:54] [Applause]
[1:35:55] Yes, sir.
[1:35:59] Let's look at the New Testament. Luke
[1:36:02] 8:14.
[1:36:05] That which fell among the thorns are
[1:36:07] they
[1:36:09] which when they have heard
[1:36:11] go forth and are choked with cares and
[1:36:17] riches
[1:36:18] and pleasures
[1:36:20] of this life
[1:36:23] and bring no fruit
[1:36:25] to perfection.
[1:36:28] Remember this is a parable of the seed.
[1:36:31] So a sower went forth to sew.
[1:36:34] Those that receive, oh my, glory to God,
[1:36:37] I believe it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:36:40] Amen. Glory to God. But they have no
[1:36:43] root, no depth within themsel.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; The seed word has no depth to anchor.
[1:36:53] There ain't enough dirt in there.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Verse 15. But that on the
[1:37:03] ah
[1:37:06] so here now God in the Old Testament
[1:37:08] said Job is a good man. God in the New
[1:37:10] Testament is saying that's good ground.
[1:37:14] I'll take his word for it.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Now this helps me identify who is and
[1:37:18] who ain't good ground.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; And if you ain't good ground, guess what
[1:37:24] you are? You're just ground.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. That's what the majority of
[1:37:28] humanity is right now. They're just
[1:37:30] ground. They're just dirt, dust.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; But that on the good ground are they?
[1:37:38] Which with an honest
[1:37:40] and
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; good
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; good heart. How was that even possible
[1:37:47] for a human being to have a good heart?
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Our heart is wicked.
[1:37:52] Our heart when we're born lost is
[1:37:55] wretched and evil.
[1:37:57] Yeah.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; How come we have a good heart?
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; We have to have a transplant.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Our heart must be changed.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Notice those with a good heart having
[1:38:10] heard the word keep it
[1:38:15] and bring forth fruit with
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; you. Even fruitbearing
[1:38:24] is tied with the virtue
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; of patience.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Not just faith, not just temperance or
[1:38:34] godliness,
[1:38:36] fruitbearing is tied with patience. So
[1:38:40] with great constancy
[1:38:43] suffering much through the trials and
[1:38:46] the difficulties of life, they keep
[1:38:50] pressing and pressing and pressing
[1:38:54] through the heat, through the dry
[1:38:56] spells, through the cool nights,
[1:38:59] whatever it is, they keep pushing and
[1:39:02] pushing with patience.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; And the more they suffer, the more
[1:39:07] fruitful they are. That's the kind of
[1:39:10] child of God I want to be. I do not want
[1:39:13] it said about me, my trials wiped me
[1:39:16] out.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; I want you to listen to this. Luke
[1:39:22] 21:19. We'll close here just in a few
[1:39:25] minutes. In your patience
[1:39:32] possess
[1:39:35] ye.
[1:39:38] So, you reckon patience is important?
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Well, I wonder what happens if we don't
[1:39:44] have patience.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Then who's possessing our soul
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; in your patience? And remember, this
[1:39:54] patience isn't just with God.
[1:39:58] Matter of fact, the prophet goes into
[1:39:59] it. We'll get into it maybe next time.
[1:40:02] But you don't just have patience with
[1:40:04] God, but you have patience with one
[1:40:07] another. Yes.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to tell you which Sunday
[1:40:11] I'm going to preach that in. So, all of
[1:40:12] you won't go to Dollywood that Sunday.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; How many needs help with patience with
[1:40:20] people?
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Well, God bless y'all for your honesty.
[1:40:24] Amen.
[1:40:25] In your patience
[1:40:28] possess ye your soul. But by patient
[1:40:31] bearing all afflictions,
[1:40:34] reproaches,
[1:40:36] the things that we go through because
[1:40:38] not for our faults, but because of being
[1:40:41] persecuted for the word's sake. We let
[1:40:44] nothing disturb us or distress us or
[1:40:49] deteriorate
[1:40:51] our patience in God's promise.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Now you understand what trials can do.
[1:40:57] They can deteriorate your patience and
[1:41:01] then make you where you're less patient
[1:41:03] than you were before the trial ever
[1:41:04] came.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Now, this is really hard on us in this
[1:41:10] microwave age.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; We got instant taters, instant coffee,
[1:41:15] instant this, instant that. We go
[1:41:17] through the drive-thru. Well, let's not
[1:41:19] go through that way this morning cuz I
[1:41:21] don't want to get in the wrong spirit.
[1:41:24] We go through the drive-thru and get
[1:41:25] instant food. It may not be exactly what
[1:41:28] you wanted. And I you've heard me say it
[1:41:30] before. Sometimes I just pull up and
[1:41:32] say, "Give me what you want to, cuz
[1:41:33] you're going to anyhow.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; I didn't order coffee and they give me
[1:41:37] coffee. I ain't never drunk coffee. I
[1:41:39] didn't order this and they give me
[1:41:40] that." So, you just go through it. So,
[1:41:42] you know, began this time of instant
[1:41:45] this and instant that. And God says,
[1:41:48] "Slow down, children.
[1:41:53] Any
[1:41:58] y'all ever feel like a child of God and
[1:42:00] your walk with God is like this?
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; And you think everybody around you is
[1:42:09] running 90 miles an hour. They're only
[1:42:11] acting like that.
[1:42:14] If we're all children of God, it's a
[1:42:16] slow walk.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. Oh my
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; our patience, our virtue, our trust.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; But in our patience, not our faith,
[1:42:27] we possess our souls.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; You can have a heart full of faith
[1:42:34] and be lost.
[1:42:40] You will not possess your soul by
[1:42:44] miraculous faith.
[1:42:47] You'll possess your soul
[1:42:50] by patience.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; God may say yes. God may say wait a
[1:42:56] while.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; What's even more painful is God may say
[1:43:00] no.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; But you do as Job. Blessed be the name
[1:43:05] of the Lord.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Can I have just a couple more minutes?
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Romans 5:3.
[1:43:16] Not only so,
[1:43:18] but we glory
[1:43:21] in tribulations.
[1:43:25] Now, from this verse on, we can, every
[1:43:27] one of us after each phrase say, "God
[1:43:29] help me."
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; We glory in tribulation. God help me.
[1:43:35] Knowing that tribulation workketh
[1:43:37] patience. God help me.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Endurance. This is what it means.
[1:43:45] Endurance under trials
[1:43:49] without sustaining loss
[1:43:52] or deterioration.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Endurance under trials without
[1:43:59] sustaining loss or deterioration. You
[1:44:02] see, it's not just coming out on the
[1:44:03] other side of that trial, but it's
[1:44:06] during the trial you had no loss
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; or no deterioration of your attitude.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, I've
[1:44:16] deteriorated some in some of the stuff
[1:44:17] I've been through.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Have you lost some of the stuff when
[1:44:21] you've went through it, but don't worry,
[1:44:23] he ain't going to give up on you. Oh,
[1:44:25] no. He's going to keep molding us. He's
[1:44:27] going to keep until he's able to birth
[1:44:30] this virtue in us. And then we will go
[1:44:33] through things and come out on the other
[1:44:35] side with no loss.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; With no loss. So, look at Job.
[1:44:43] He come out on the other side. Where was
[1:44:45] the loss?
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Children back, wealth back, friends
[1:44:49] back, family back. It wasn't a loss. He
[1:44:52] actually had more than what he had for
[1:44:54] the trial ever come. So he come through
[1:44:56] on the other side of that. It didn't say
[1:44:58] that he didn't lose through it. But the
[1:45:00] end result, look at preJ before the
[1:45:02] trial and look at post job after the
[1:45:05] trial and see what God you imagine.
[1:45:07] Every time the devil come up before the
[1:45:09] throne of God, Papa say, "Uh,
[1:45:13] I've been meaning to ask it." What do
[1:45:15] you think about Job now? I don't want to
[1:45:17] talk about it. I don't want to talk
[1:45:18] about Oh, yes, we are going to talk
[1:45:21] about it. Cuz this is my throne room and
[1:45:24] this is my throne. And I want to tell
[1:45:27] you to your face, you're a baldfaced
[1:45:30] liar.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Cuz you said Joe would turn against me.
[1:45:35] And I told you that he would. Well, I've
[1:45:37] got to go. No, you ain't. Stay right
[1:45:40] here.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:45:54] Let's close here.
[1:45:57] Verse four.
[1:45:59] Let's go back and read verse three. So
[1:46:01] it all ties together. Not only so, but
[1:46:02] we glory in tribulation.
[1:46:05] Also, knowing that tribulation workketh
[1:46:09] patience,
[1:46:11] and patience
[1:46:13] experience,
[1:46:16] and experience
[1:46:18] hope.
[1:46:20] But if we hope for that which we see
[1:46:23] not, then do we with patience
[1:46:26] wait for it? Romans chapter 8 25. Romans
[1:46:30] 15:4. Whatsoever things were a four time
[1:46:33] written were written for our learning,
[1:46:35] that we through patience
[1:46:39] and comfort of the scriptures
[1:46:43] might have
[1:46:45] hope.
[1:46:48] And the church said,
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; let's stand.
[1:46:57] Praise be to God.
[1:47:00] Colossians 1:10, that we might walk
[1:47:03] worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing,
[1:47:07] being fruitful in every good work.
[1:47:11] Amen. And increasing in the knowledge of
[1:47:14] God, strengthened was almight according
[1:47:18] to his glorious power unto all patience
[1:47:22] and longsuffering
[1:47:25] with.
[1:47:28] Listen how God accompanies things in his
[1:47:32] children's menu.
[1:47:34] This is not normal.
[1:47:37] This is not human, Harry. It don't make
[1:47:40] any sense that God would accompany some
[1:47:43] of this stuff. Long suffering with
[1:47:46] joyfulness.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; This is bride food.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; I said this is bride food.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Longsuffering.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians 1:33. Remembering
[1:48:03] without ceasing your work of faith and
[1:48:06] your labor of love and patience of hope
[1:48:11] and our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight
[1:48:13] of God and our father. Hebrews 6:11. And
[1:48:15] we desire that every one of you do show
[1:48:18] the same diligence to the full assurance
[1:48:19] of hope unto the end. Verse 12. that you
[1:48:22] be not slothful, but followers of them
[1:48:25] who through faith
[1:48:29] and
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; inherit
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; the promises.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; These qualities are absolutely essential
[1:48:42] to produce the divine steadfastness
[1:48:46] and the promise of God. So faith hears
[1:48:48] it said, "Yep, that's right. I believe
[1:48:50] God's word is true." Amen. Then faith
[1:48:53] from a heart that's full of faith but
[1:48:55] will have no patience in time. It become
[1:48:58] oh I I I I don't know when it's going to
[1:49:00] happen. I I I don't know. I heard
[1:49:04] brother Greg's testimony there this
[1:49:06] morning. Isn't that awesome?
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; But you know what? Faith alone didn't do
[1:49:11] that.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; But patience
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; patience can look at a scan and the
[1:49:17] doctor say it's here there and there.
[1:49:19] Faith will say, "I call that a lie." And
[1:49:22] patience couple will that faith will
[1:49:24] say, "However long it takes. However
[1:49:26] long it takes, it don't really matter.
[1:49:28] My God is a mighty God and the devil
[1:49:30] can't take me till God's done with me."
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Can't you see why we need such patience?
[1:49:35] It's the same thing dealing with one
[1:49:37] another. We can look at one say, "Oh
[1:49:39] yeah, I believe brother so and so is a
[1:49:40] good man." But I'll tell you one thing,
[1:49:42] I get so fed up with him. I get
[1:49:43] absolutely what? But he's a good man.
[1:49:45] I'll tell you one thing, brother Harry's
[1:49:47] a good brother. Bless his heart. And I
[1:49:48] love to hear him saying, "But boy,
[1:49:50] here's human makeup. I'm telling you one
[1:49:52] thing. Couple your faith and your
[1:49:54] confidence in him with patience." Lord,
[1:49:57] bring Brother Harry along.
[1:50:00] Lord, bring him along. Bless his heart.
[1:50:02] I mean, you know, bring Brother Larry
[1:50:04] along. Lord, Brother Skip, bring him
[1:50:05] along. Oh, you can tell the man loves
[1:50:07] the Lord. He got up there and prayed a
[1:50:09] while ago. You could tell he loves God,
[1:50:11] but Lord, he's just got so many flaws
[1:50:13] like you.
[1:50:19] patience.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Well, if the Lord lets me live, I'll be
[1:50:23] preaching on this again
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; sometime.
[1:50:28] Could be next Sunday. Could be.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him? Yes.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? Many of the heroes
[1:50:41] that we've called them giants of faith,
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; but we've left out a very important
[1:50:48] quality. They weren't just giants of
[1:50:51] faith. They were giants
[1:50:55] of patience.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says it himself about his
[1:51:01] ministry about patience with people.
[1:51:05] And he said, "Having patience with the
[1:51:07] people." He said, "I've been preaching
[1:51:08] here for 30 something years
[1:51:11] and still having to have patience with
[1:51:13] women that cut their hair, women that do
[1:51:16] this and men that do that."
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; So, a pastor's got to be a patient man.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; It's good if he's got faith to raise the
[1:51:26] dead because without patience, he'll
[1:51:28] definitely need it cuz he'll wind up
[1:51:29] killing a few.
[1:51:36] And if he don't do it physically, he'll
[1:51:38] do it with his tongue behind your back.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Sweet Jesus, I'm giving away trade
[1:51:43] secrets.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; I don't care who you are. We all need
[1:51:49] more patience.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; The man who brought you this today
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; needs more patience.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; But I don't like how I get it.
[1:52:02] So tribulation workketh patience,
[1:52:05] patience, experience, experience hope,
[1:52:08] hope maketh not ashamed. For the love of
[1:52:11] God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
[1:52:14] Holy Ghost which is given unto us.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; But in reality, when I get along with
[1:52:22] Jesus,
[1:52:24] even though I don't pray for
[1:52:25] tribulation,
[1:52:27] I do wind up telling him whatever it
[1:52:30] takes.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; You do that, brother Fred.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Whatever it takes, Lord. That ultimately
[1:52:39] is my desire.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together if you
[1:52:43] would.
[1:52:48] Hallelujah.
[1:52:52] Lord, we've been waiting
[1:52:54] and waiting.
[1:52:58] Dear God, I've heard it since I was a
[1:53:00] little boy. And many of these people
[1:53:01] here were raised in church and they
[1:53:02] heard it since they were children. Jesus
[1:53:05] is coming. He's coming back.
[1:53:09] How many people were alive and the
[1:53:10] prophet told those visions?
[1:53:13] They saw that family going down the road
[1:53:14] in that car. They probably thought,
[1:53:17] "Now, he he he's missed it big time on
[1:53:19] that."
[1:53:22] I even had a message preacher tell me a
[1:53:24] few years ago, Brother Donnie, it may
[1:53:26] not actually be that way. I said, "But
[1:53:29] brother, that's what the prophet saw."
[1:53:31] "Well, we may not live that long. It may
[1:53:33] not." I said, "He said it. I believe it.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; It will come to pass if it's God's
[1:53:39] word."
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yet, Lord,
[1:53:43] if we could be just as confident
[1:53:46] in your prophecies about us,
[1:53:51] many of these people here today would
[1:53:52] die for this message if it ever come
[1:53:54] right down to it, cuz they believe it's
[1:53:57] the truth.
[1:53:59] But Lord God, I don't want to just die
[1:54:01] for this message. I want to give my life
[1:54:04] and die daily for the promises with my
[1:54:08] name on them.
[1:54:11] Whenever we saw that pope out of the
[1:54:13] United States according to prophecy was
[1:54:15] placed in there, I didn't say, "Glory to
[1:54:18] God, I believe the message." Now,
[1:54:22] whenever we've seen these autonomous
[1:54:24] automobiles and all, we didn't say,
[1:54:25] "Well, praise God. I believe the
[1:54:27] message." We already believe the
[1:54:29] message.
[1:54:31] I don't believe one bit more today after
[1:54:34] seeing some of the events that have been
[1:54:36] brought to pass than what I believe
[1:54:39] before they ever come to pass
[1:54:41] because I'm a believer
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; and that's what we do.
[1:54:47] We wait patiently.
[1:54:50] Lord, if we could wait for a car and we
[1:54:54] could wait for a pope and we could wait
[1:54:57] for words like that to come to pass.
[1:55:00] What about these words in our lives,
[1:55:04] these virtues?
[1:55:06] Aren't they just as important?
[1:55:09] There's one word, Lord, well said this
[1:55:11] way. There's several words I have no
[1:55:13] desire to see come to pass. I have no
[1:55:16] desire to see that seventh vision of our
[1:55:18] nation being annihilated.
[1:55:21] No desire. I have no desire
[1:55:25] to see the west coast, one tenth of the
[1:55:28] earth, fixing to fall in a chunk of it,
[1:55:32] 3 to 400 miles wide, 1,500 miles long
[1:55:38] and fall 40 miles down and go plum down
[1:55:41] to the salt sea and the tidal waves. the
[1:55:46] ocean will weep its way into the desert
[1:55:51] in Tampa when he stands there in 1964
[1:55:53] and he says one day this place will fall
[1:55:56] into the ocean.
[1:55:59] Hallelujah.
[1:56:01] Oh, I love the sermon the choosing of
[1:56:03] the bride. But it's not so much those
[1:56:06] prophecies about Los Angeles that I
[1:56:08] hear,
[1:56:10] but it's the bride call that I hear out
[1:56:12] of that sermon.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:14] If we have confidence, Los Angeles will
[1:56:17] fall in the sea. And we see it more and
[1:56:19] more all the time. Seismologists, people
[1:56:23] who study it, these different faults
[1:56:25] they found in the last 30 to 40 years
[1:56:27] that they didn't even recognize was
[1:56:29] there. And I shared an article just some
[1:56:31] weeks ago with some of the different
[1:56:33] ministers in the message where
[1:56:34] scientists themselves are now saying a
[1:56:37] great chunk of the earth will fall off
[1:56:41] in the west coast.
[1:56:43] If time would go on long enough, they
[1:56:46] would start quoting the message, too.
[1:56:50] They're quoting it in their predictions.
[1:56:52] They call it predictions. We call it
[1:56:56] prophecies.
[1:56:59] But I also hear another word from the
[1:57:01] Lord saying,
[1:57:03] "There's been brides, brides, churches,
[1:57:05] churches, brides, brides, churches,
[1:57:08] churches.
[1:57:10] But there must come one who has both
[1:57:13] mechanics
[1:57:14] and dynamics.
[1:57:17] Hallelujah, Jesus.
[1:57:20] Oh, we worship you today, Father.
[1:57:23] We with patience wait for that word, our
[1:57:27] word.
[1:57:29] How lonely he must have felt.
[1:57:32] How apart and separated he must have
[1:57:35] felt. And how many days and nights the
[1:57:38] tears trickled out of his eyes and the
[1:57:41] bitterness of his difficulty
[1:57:44] as Joseph
[1:57:47] down in the land of Egypt.
[1:57:49] And the psalmist David caught that word
[1:57:52] and said,
[1:57:54] "Until his word came,
[1:57:59] the word of the Lord
[1:58:01] tried him."
[1:58:04] So the word of the Lord was trying him
[1:58:08] until his word came.
[1:58:12] Hallelujah.
[1:58:14] Cuz there was a specific word. He had
[1:58:17] that dream.
[1:58:19] Oh, glory to God. So is it today, Lord,
[1:58:22] the word of the Lord is trying your
[1:58:24] people
[1:58:26] until our word comes.
[1:58:32] We love you, Jesus.
[1:58:34] We pray today, Father, for Sister Rousan
[1:58:38] Carter and for the family of our brother
[1:58:41] Mack, for his church family. Lord,
[1:58:45] little did we know this week you had
[1:58:47] called another one home.
[1:58:50] By now he's already met friends and
[1:58:52] loved ones and moved beyond the curtain
[1:58:54] of time.
[1:58:56] By now, no doubt he's already met
[1:59:00] this man that people are making one
[1:59:02] YouTube video after another and calling
[1:59:04] him a liar and a deceiver and a false
[1:59:05] prophet.
[1:59:08] But brother Matt did not meet a false
[1:59:10] prophet, but he met an angel sent from
[1:59:13] God with a message.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, we don't see how it could be much
[1:59:18] longer, Jesus.
[1:59:21] And after all, maybe you're waiting on
[1:59:24] us to be developed and built into the
[1:59:27] image.
[1:59:29] Oh, granite Father,
[1:59:32] we worship you today, Lord.
[1:59:35] and we'd like to be remembered today
[1:59:37] before the Lord. Would you just raise
[1:59:39] your hands in the presence of God? How
[1:59:41] many needs more faith, more virtue, more
[1:59:43] knowledge, more patience, more
[1:59:46] temperance, more godliness, all these
[1:59:48] great things of the Lord Jesus? Grant it
[1:59:51] to us, Lord. Maybe there's some here
[1:59:54] today, Father, and they've had great
[1:59:55] trials in their life, and maybe they've
[1:59:56] never yet come to the spot with enough
[1:59:59] victory over it that they could say,
[2:00:01] "Thank you, Lord."
[2:00:03] It's very hard and I know it seems odd
[2:00:05] and peculiar and people may think it's
[2:00:07] very very strange but there is such
[2:00:09] victory and been able to accept the fact
[2:00:11] that you are a perfect God and you make
[2:00:15] no mistakes.
[2:00:17] We worship you Jesus.
[2:00:20] I know we say it all the time. Lord
[2:00:22] we'll understand it better by and by. I
[2:00:24] I know that was written with an earth
[2:00:26] earthly view, but sometimes I wonder if
[2:00:29] we'll need any explanation then cuz
[2:00:32] we'll be in a word form body and in that
[2:00:34] word form body we know all things
[2:00:37] anyhow. So on this side we're trying to
[2:00:40] figure it out and scratch our heads and
[2:00:41] try to understand it
[2:00:45] because we're looking at it through the
[2:00:46] veil of darkness.
[2:00:48] Lord Jesus, may we be faithful.
[2:00:51] May my patience endure. If I have to go
[2:00:55] by the way of the grave and they roll me
[2:00:56] up here in a box and the preachers
[2:00:58] preach over me,
[2:01:00] that'll not hinder me, Lord.
[2:01:03] But if I'm alive and remain, then Lord
[2:01:06] Jesus, as an old man, oh yeah, now I'm
[2:01:09] an old man, 69,
[2:01:12] having a birthday this last week, that
[2:01:14] meant I got one birthday closer to being
[2:01:18] 18 again. So, the way I'm looking at it,
[2:01:21] I'm looking at it back from the
[2:01:22] beginning. Not just that I'm getting
[2:01:25] older, but hopefully I'm getting wiser,
[2:01:27] getting closer. That's what we want
[2:01:30] today, Jesus.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; We worship you, Lord.
[2:01:34] Oh, can we raise our hands, saints, in
[2:01:36] the presence of the Lord? Maybe you're
[2:01:39] standing here today and you face a
[2:01:41] terrible thing in your life, and you've
[2:01:43] never yet been able to acknowledge his
[2:01:46] omnipotence in that situation.
[2:01:49] Lord, I prayed for this and that and the
[2:01:51] outcome was totally different. But
[2:01:53] today, I want to thank you that you are
[2:01:57] perfect. Your ways are perfect. I want
[2:02:00] to thank you for seeing me through that
[2:02:02] great heartbreak, Lord, that great
[2:02:05] trying time of my life. I still don't
[2:02:08] understand it any better, Lord, but I
[2:02:10] have come to this understand it. You are
[2:02:13] God
[2:02:14] and God alone.
[2:02:17] And we could search the mountains. We
[2:02:19] could search the valleys. We could
[2:02:21] search the churches. We could search all
[2:02:23] over. And we wouldn't find nobody.
[2:02:27] Nobody that would even rank close to who
[2:02:31] you are. When we're down in the valley
[2:02:34] and it's so dark and so deep and we
[2:02:36] wonder if we'll ever come out. When we
[2:02:39] go to the highest loftiest mountain of
[2:02:41] our experience, no matter where we
[2:02:44] search, we'll never find anybody that
[2:02:47] can outdo you, that can out love you,
[2:02:50] that can out save you, that can outheal
[2:02:53] you, that can outd deliver you. Oh,
[2:02:56] glory to God. We worship you here today,
[2:02:59] Jesus.
[2:03:01] We magnify your name, Lord God.
[2:03:06] Can we just worship him a little bit?
[2:03:07] Sing something for us here.
[2:03:10] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[2:03:13] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[2:03:17] We worship you, oh God. I'm going to
[2:03:21] keep pressing on.
[2:03:27] Oh, pressing on.

[2:11:59] Brother Bernie, where are you this
[2:12:00] morning? Back here in the back, our
[2:12:02] brother's still dealing with this kidney
[2:12:03] stone. Let's just pray for him today.
[2:12:07] Father, let this thing pass from him.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, I'm not sure when you
[2:12:12] were here as a human if you ever dealt
[2:12:14] with one of these or not, but you
[2:12:16] suffered stripes for everything we'd
[2:12:18] ever face.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Dear God, we agree together with our
[2:12:22] brother.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; Having suffered with these things, Lord,
[2:12:25] myself and others here in the church
[2:12:26] that have, we know the discomfort, the
[2:12:29] pain, and all that can be involved with
[2:12:31] it. In the name of Jesus, may this pass
[2:12:35] from our brother's body. May it leave
[2:12:37] him. Lord God, in Jesus name, we believe
[2:12:41] your word is true. Father, I've stood in
[2:12:44] the pulpit in the pain and the duress of
[2:12:46] kidney stones and after church passing
[2:12:49] before. May it be so with our brother
[2:12:52] today. I pray.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. Don't you love
[2:12:57] him?
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[2:13:08] Word of the Lord this morning.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; Is the Lord. Let's sing this before we
[2:13:12] leave this morning. You're awesome in
[2:13:14] this place, mighty God.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you get to come and hear
[2:13:18] such a word?
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you get to believe such
[2:13:21] a word?
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; For such a time as this, God has placed
[2:13:26] this message in our lives. I thank you
[2:13:28] for it. Why don't you give him one more
[2:13:30] good hand clap of praise? Amen.
