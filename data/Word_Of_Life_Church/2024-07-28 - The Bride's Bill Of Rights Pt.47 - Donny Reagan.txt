such chaos I realize that but there's Darkness everywhere I know that too churches are collapsing crumbling people losing their desire to serve the Lord I realize that too but I'm an astronaut so I take my own atmosphere with me okay and I'm in Walmart and I see people with green hair and pink hair and yellow hair and I mean Carol saw a guy yesterday and I mean he had all kinds of things stuck all over everywhere metal type deals I'm not sure what they call them and she looked at me and said what in the world well it's going to get worse and worse and worse is it not people decorating their bodies with tattoos I'm not sure exactly what that's supposed to mean and yet the world is is in a state that it's never been before and I ain't never been any closer to Jesus in my entire life and I'm ready myself and if you're not you can get that way today before you leave how many's ready amen God bless your heart that is the greatest thing you could ask for if you're flat broke today and you ain't got enough money to buy a hamburger after church but you're ready to meet God you're better off than a billionaire that's right cuz tell me you ever seen any Millionaire's caskets full of money gold stocks bonds BMWs Mercedes you ever seen any of that Lamborghinis me either a't that strange wonder who gets it their kids are fussing and fighting over it but all my how many have I walked in front of and led them in that last stage of their journey and I'm fixing to say them words drop them down in that ground they might not have had enough money to even bury theirself that people had to help bury them but you talking about a soul that was ready to meet God Amen that is what it's all about friends let's turn this morning if you would to Matthew chapter 8 verse4 how is in love of Jesus to today with all your heart and when Jesus was coming to Peter's house he saw his wife's mother laid and sick of a fever and he touched her hand and the fever left her what power so here somebody's sick they got a fever Jesus just walks in in he doesn't even pray he just touched her on the hand why the hand I don't know joury us as humans Where Do We Touch people that have a fever on their forehead right yeah so oh yeah yeah you you've got a fever you've got a fever Jesus touched her on the hand now watch the significance he touched her hand and the fever left her and she arose and ministered unto them so you reckon Peter's mother-in-law grabbed a Torah the Bible was with North the Old Testament and took a text and said now Jesus sit down I'm going to preach to you no but she ministered to them food and drink where did Jesus touch her the Avenue she's going to use amen and she Rose and ministered unto them 1 Corinthians chapter 16 verse 15 I beseech you Brethren you know the house of stepanus that it is the first fruits of aaya and these are the first converts that Paul was able to lead to the Lord in this city of aayat that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the Saints now here's the type of addict I want to be people are addicted to dope they're addicted to alcohol they're addicted to their cell phone they're addicted to Instagram and Tik Tok and all the rest of the things that are around but this right here is a holy addiction and if you're addicted to this I ain't going to pray that God will get you off I just pray that you'll get around other people and they'll become as addicted as you are amen now watch what an outstanding thing to say now they're not preachers and it didn't say the cast out Devils they walked on water to heal the sick but they found their Ministry and once they found it they become so much a part of it that Paul uses this word the only time it's used to describe people of God that have found what they're supposed to do and when they do it with all of their hearts I beseech you Brethren you know the house of stephanus that is the first fruits of aayah that they have addicted themselves now the Lord was in them but it was actually thems that got addicted it's like the more they did it the more they wanted to and the more they wanted to the more they did and the more they did the more they wanted to that is an addiction right so a person starts out on drugs or whatever it is they do and they take a little bit and then their brain gets used to it because drugs go to that part of your brain that gives you that high and it reproduces is it not in a natural way the way your body is made to releasing the endorphins in your body and then your body gets used to it so you have to have more then you take that dose your body gets used to it the endorphins don't excite you no more it's a feel-good part about your brain and then you have to have more and more and more what are you you're an addict look at what these Saints did and they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the Saints look at me with the meaning of this word deonia now this is the Greek word that we get the word Deacon from Deacon deacons in the Bible were not necessarily preachers they were not men who necessarily cast out Devils now they have to be apt to teach of course but they weren't actually in the ministry in the part of Peter James John Bartholomew Matthew all the rest of those brothers so whenever the needs come up up among the widows and the fatherless then the preachers is having to leave that and take care of them and they said you know what this is not good we need to seek out some brethren that are among us that are filled with the spirit of God and they will be able to minister to the needs of the people and this is the word they chose to use deonia so it is deacons also the same word used for this type of ministry and it means service ministering the service of those who prepare and present food you mean to tell me somebody that would fix a meal for a sister in the church that had surgery or brothers in the church and they can't be able to do what they need to do and somebody would help them with a meal that's a Ministry according to the Bible it is yeah but why is it we think every Minister has to minister from right here you understand as long as the devil can keep your ministry from you he'll make you feel like you are doing nothing amen and your life is in vain may the Lord bless his word let us pray together Lord Jesus thank you so much for the service thus far the singing and your presence that we've sensed here now Lord we come to the breaking of the word and the bread of life we just pray that you'd speak to us father you see our needs are many today and Lord God we believe that you're a God who knows every desire every request down to the smallest person here that would be me we pray that you would just minister Minister dear God to the sick to the needy to The Afflicted to those who'd like to be here today in the camp because of sickness in their home or various things that they're dealing with father would you help me to get out of the way that I can be able to speak what you've placed upon my heart shut my mouth to anything that would displease you Lord speak to us the words of eternal life in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you Saints you may be seated we've been speaking about the bride having so many rights that's given to her by the grace and the mercy of God a right that many of the people of this Earth would not dare to even desire they're more concerned about their rights to kill babies the rights to murder their rights to annihilate and defile your rights you see they don't just want equal rights but they want us to acknowledge their rights and US forfeit ours they believe in free speech as long as it's them speaking freely what they want to speak but we can't speak what we want to speak that's this the way that it is now remember this is all pre-tribulation anointed people that are willing to kill others people that say that Mr Trump uh the guy that shot him that they do wish the guy would not have missed that he would have you probably seen those different clips by people and this is the age and the society that we're in I wouldn't wish that on my greatest enemy whoever they would be and if you do you need to hit this altar before you leave because the spirit of murder is not the spirit of God that's the spirit that was on Cain in the Garden of Eden but God has called us to a higher place and generally the higher God calls you the greater the servitude to him and to his people so it's not the way the world would relate to it that the higher your position is in the world then the more people recognize you and the more people do for you so there lives are centered around you then you become the recipient of all the good things that they have and you are the recipient of their accolades of praise and their love and so on and so on and so on but when it comes to the spirit of God God does the exact opposite of that Jesus said you will not be like the Gentiles were don't seek their position now because the Apostles of course had got into an argument arent coming along the way and they was arguing and fussing over who would be the greatest among them now Jesus said among the Gentiles that's the way they do but then he called him a little child and he set the little child there and said except you become as humble and converted as this little child you would in no wise even see the kingdom of God so let him that is the greatest among you be your servant he said am I not come as the son of man to be your servant you can see why would have totally confused them that never heard a king talk like this before they had never heard of course almighty God veiled in human flesh they never saw this about him in the Old Testament so it was something they had to relearn about greatness because to them it was climbing to the top and each one of them thinking okay you know Peter's going to be the main man Jesus gave him the keys well wonder what I have Jesus never told me I could have keys what do I get well I I don't know what else I'm supposed to get so they're you know they're still arguing and debating over position it's it's sad to say that the same thing is ongoing among Christian people today it happens in a church it happens among preachers you know preachers we we'll talk about well how many hits do you have on your website and how many people people are subscribed to you on YouTube I really don't know how many subscrib to us on YouTube and I really don't care I really that makes no no difference at all to me you've heard me say it before and I'll say it again if it was left up to me would never stream another service I would not be on YouTube I would not be on anywhere in social media I don't do it so that people will know my name I don't do it so that our church people can look up to our church as some great something our church is no more than anybody else's Church we're saved by the grace of God and the church said saved by the grace of God and if we make it and I believe we will it will be the grace of God that does it not our works not because I'm a great man I'm a great flop I am a great failure and I preach to Great failures and my associate ministers here are great failures with me every great preacher in the message is a great failure and without God in our lives we are completely helpless brother Brandon would have been a total failure had not the mercy of God moved on his life whenever God took his wife and his baby he tried to take his own life several times over again and he would have done it had sovereignty not stepped in and not allowed him to do it is that right so what was it the grace of God and brother brandom still is a human being battled with himself on down of course to the end of his life but we know then that becoming into a place to be able to minister that we're called to be married to God we're called to have freedom we're called to have so many wonderful things but we're also called to be in service to our Lord that service can be described by so many and so many different ways so some it will be public acknowledgement to others it would be well I'm going to donate so much but can you name the building after me and if I give so much money can my name be on the founders this and that and the other and you know the sad thing about it is we see this happening in the message so you can generally know whenever a certain person does a certain certain thing and supplies the most of the money in the church because they will name this after him or name this after her or name this well my Bible tells me don't let you laugh hand know what your right hand's doing so that's why here we don't have this certain list on the outside of the wall everybody that gave over a 100,000 or everybody that gave over 10,000 will list your name there why would I want to take Heaven's Glory away from you by putting your name on a wall outside that door why would you even want me to but yet there's something about human beings we feel like we have to have that acknowledge M that public something and we want you know we just want people to know what we're doing but yet I love it whenever you can find people that uh recognize their position that God has given them certain abilities for some it will involve public display for many many others it will not be that hardly anybody will know nothing about it there's one of the brothers of our church that had passed a few years ago and at his funeral different people was coming up to his family members and telling them you know he done this and he done that and he done this and he done that and and I knew it myself cuz a brother had talked to me but even some of his children were overwhelmed because they didn't know what their father had done and I thought you know what that is a great man that is a man that does not going around blowing the trumpet but for whatever particular in reason and I feel like that it was a scriptural need that Paul would feel in his heart I would imagine that whenever our brother and his family because it wasn't just him I want you to notice how Paul says this again in 1 Corinthians 16:15 I beseech you Brethren you know the house of stephanus I want you to notice that stephanus was not the only one in his household so if he was he would have just mentioned him by name but he says the the house of stephanus that is the first fruits of aop that they now stephanus is the only one that Paul mentioned his name was it his wife his sons his daughters maybe had grandchildren we don't know who all they were but it was a good group of they and it was a good group to hang around now maybe God got a hold of stephanus first we don't know really the order of conversion but it was stephanus and they that were in his house so I love it when it comes this way that the father is the example is the way that it should be and sometimes if the father's not worry needs to be with the Lord then many times a mother will step in and she's the one who has to be that but yet if they can both be able to come to that place where they realize who they are then they can begin to influence their children and raise their children in this way instead of their children being raised like the Modern Age lean kids are that whatever they want they get it so they don't value anything it don't cost them anything they want a pair of $150 tennis shoes well they're going to get it they want this they want that they're going to get it they know nothing about the value of money they know nothing about the cost and if you're not careful you're raising those kids in that way to where they are going to look at everything else and if they're not careful they transpose that then from just life to God so everything God gives them God owes this to me God owes me this God owes me that brother Donnie owes me this the deacons owe me that these preachers are called to serve me come over here and serve me y'all need to bow down to me I'm you know that's totally the wrong mindset but this God must have laid this on Paul's heart for whatever reason there must have been something so outstanding about their addiction now I've dealt with many addicts in my Ministry around the world I've dealt with many different addicts and different types of addicts and I've seen those that have been bound by alcohol and by drugs and and sometimes by smoking maybe and and many of them are in this state that they wish they were not there they hate it they absolutely hate it and people people will tell them snap out of it you can do this you can overcome it and they try to get them a a book on this and a tape on that and this psychologist and that psychologist but when once that thing gets a hold to you many times it takes the spirit of God to break that how many times have I seen drug addicts that made up their mind I'll never do it again but remember your body and your brain has become addicted to that it will start screaming it will scream you ought to see people as I've seen them when they're trying to come out from under the influence of drugs or alcohol and the DT set in and they're sweating and they're crying and they're agonizing in pain and so on and so on why because their body is so addicted to that stuff even though they make up their mind I don't need it let me go a little farther it can happen not only to substances it can happen to pornography it can happen to all types of things I hope you understand the direction I'm going to go there are some people that have to have a fix of public accolades and it's like if they don't get their name called and so long and they can't do this and can't do that it's like it drives them crazy it just it eats on them and eats on them and they just can't take it so if if nobody won't do it voluntarily then they will almost beg for it and they will say something on YouTube or they will say something on Facebook and what they're doing they're trying to generate a little bit of Praise a little bit of love why they're addicted to that and without it they they just tore all to pieces they can't understand why nobody won't give them their fix and then whenever they do it somebody will come on there and say well brother or sister whoever it is you know you're a great so and so and you're this and this and this and you know what that does that gives them a temporary fix for a while and then nobody else will do it and they have to do the same thing again what a sad life What a Sad life that people can become to addicted of things that that cuddle oh my and babies they're all human nature what in the world are we thinking about that we think that God wants our human nature to be babied anyhow there ought to be something inside of us that we are like stephanus and his family were that they addicted themselves to the ministry of the Saints now may I say I've been talking about the ministry of the son of man and I believe that God is going to bring according to what the prophet taught us the bride of Christ around the world to the Perfection as the prophet said it to the Perfection of the son of man now listen to me again the Perfection of the son of man that does not mean everyone will stand and by discernment call people out and tell them what their names are and so on that is one to a generation we're not called none of us are called to do any of that but I do believe every member of the body will be so into the ministry of Christ Jesus of where God's called them to be and let me just tell you there's there's Parts about Ministry that are glorious there are Parts about Ministry that are wonderful but there are also Parts about Ministry that are burdensome Troublesome heavy and then I'm not talking that just about a preacher I'm talking about your ministry as a child of God oh how pleasant it would be if every aspect of our ministry now some of you mothers sitting here today you may be thinking well brother Donnie what in the world is my Minister well part of it is being a mom and there's fun Parts about being a mom but there's troubling Parts about being a mom there's Parts about being a mom that you don't like being is that right mothers you enjoy spanking your kids you enjoy chastising them you enjoy it when they're wrong and you have to say something no that's part of your ministry being the Fifth Gospel now the household of stephanus they had addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints that is they were very forward and they were very obsessed by the presence of God and the desire in them to assist the poor Saints now remember looked at this in question answers that this thing that the apostles did for a little while it was a temporary try but it never did work to where that they made every everybody even and it was not a teaching of the Lord Jesus nor a teaching of the Apostles but it was something that got among the body and they tried to do it themselves but it never did work and here it is we can see in Corinthians here around 59 ad uh that this started some 30 years ago 28 years ago something like that and it did not work it was a form of Communism in other words where everything would be communal so all the rich would sell everything they have and give it to the poor but I want you to notice the poor were still there by the time first Corinthians was written so they saw that now apparently these were people of substance and they wanted to take the blessing that God had given them instead of them living in all this upper echelon of life and this upper echelon of Lifestyle they wanted to take part of what gave them God gave them and give it out to others and to be able to be a blessing for others so their interest in the Lord Jesus somehow it was personified that they perceive this that the Lord Jesus also had a body now you see it's much easier for us to isolate this move of God and we all Focus all of our attention all of our love everything that we are toward this lovely Lord Jesus and we love him and we serve him and we give him whatever he wants but then when it comes to members of his body that are flawed members of his body which are yet human and they have their failures and their shortcomings you know come on let's be honest now most of us have a hard time you know kind of ministering unto them oh it's much easier to minister to the holy lovely Lord Jesus but that is eternal life Jesus Jesus never ministered to the perfect there's no need for him to come to the Earth cuz he wouldn't have found a perfect human being on the entire Earth when he was here that was not one I don't know really what the population of the Earth was when the Lord Jesus was here but there was not one perfect human being that Jesus could go minister to them but who needed him the most the sick the Lost those that had been married multiple times those that were in adultery those that were demon yes that's the ones that he went to NOW Watch What Happens as their interest in the Lord Jesus but they were living under the influence of the Life of Christ now remember as the church ages go on this will dwindle down in time because as the church becomes established and they have buildings and property and so on they will tend to become more material- minded but the influence of that first church age was operating under the spirit of Jesus himself so that eternal life affected this first century Believers and I believe with the Restoration in the last days there will be a restoration of this right here ministering to the body maybe some of y'all have never understood me in the sense of why I've wanted to build churches all over this world maybe you've never understood why that I would have such a desire to help Prince books and bibles and seal books and all kinds of things and just so you know without going into too much detail through our church over the years we have spent millions of dollars not thousands millions of dollars by helping the bride of Christ around the world and I thank God we're continuing to do so to this day you said why would you even want to do that because they are part of who I am they are part of who you are now I've been privileged to travel to many of those places and see where they worship and see the things that they have to worship God in I know I have an advantage over in that way but when I go and I see it but remember I was started doing this before I ever made one trip to Africa one trip to India one trip to the third world countries because it was something in my heart Carol and I said on the front porch of our little single wide trailer when we lived down in Kentucky back in the 80s and we told God sitting on our front porch in a porch swing God we sat there and held our hands God if we you want us to do something for you help us Lord if you want us to do this out of the other you put it in our hands and we promise we make a promise to you God we will help your people around the world little did we know that we were praying for something Way Beyond what we could ever imagine in our minds is it something that the Bride of Christ does yes it's something we should do I want you to notice the prophet you're in the believer's position in Christ many times people go out and see an evangelist like for instance our brother Billy Graham what good it would do for me to try to be like Billy Graham I couldn't do it if I had to I've got a Ministry that I've got to take care of and the next man's got a Ministry and each one has got a Ministry even to the housewife on now listen here he's talking about himself and he's talking about Billy Graham and then he brings it on down to even the housewife has a minister well I I thought Ministry was always preaching that's tradition that's tradition so the housewife has a Ministry well what kind of ministry is it how long has it been since you seen me get any of our housewife sisters up and then preach to you on Wednesday night or Sunday morning now never never would that be un unfitting would that be contrary to the word it would but what if that housewife at home in the morning or at lunchtime or before her and their kids go to bed and the father and that little housewife takes her Bible or that little housewife takes the books written by an Jorgenson and and dramatizes basically the prophet's life and they set that and they go to discussing the message of the hour or they're talking about the things Bible stories of Abraham Isaac Jacob and so on and that little housewife is there with all of her heart trying to instill something in her children is she out of place then she's out of place if she don't do it but you see Satan Even in our ranks has tried to so uh take away the importance of that place and simply give our our our kids you know let let them watch a Bible video let them nothing wrong with that as long as it ain't weird but there's nothing wrong with that but there's something about hearing Mama's voice and Daddy's voice did not that begin even with the giving of the Old Testament that God said you train your children you teach your children look look at parents don't think that your kids are going to come to church twice a week and then even on the Youth Services and they're going to get everything they need they are fighting things I never fought when I was a kid they're fighting things you never fought when you was a kid they need more help than they've ever had in their life I appreciate our youth services don't you I appreciate our youth leaders Desiring to do something for our youth where they can come together but remember that does not eliminate your responsibility as parents mothers God called you and gave you a Ministry praise praise the Lord God gave you a Ministry notice how he words this even to the housewife has a Ministry or ministering the word of God so you're not just making their eggs or their pancakes for their breakfast and fixing them a sandwich for lunch and you're not just earning their clothes and washing their clothes and so on but God expect you Sisters You mothers to have such an influence on their lives and let me not leave the fathers out because fathers you also have a great responsibility but I find it amazing that brother Bram never identifies the Fathers as being the sixth gospel on now so there's Matthew Mark Luke John and mother I'm glad that he didn't say you know Carol or Janet or Linda or Barbara and give them a name cuz every one the rescue sisters if you would name Barbara you'd say well that leads me out but he did not do it that way he left it under the office of mother so father is not the Fifth Gospel deacons are not the Fifth Gospel Sunday school leaders youth leaders are not the Fifth Gospel who is Mama right well praise the Lord ah I guarantee you right now hell is in an uproar and a turmoil hell is tore all the pieces all you think my my if brother Donnie could get the ministers up there and pray for them and get the ministers all all filled with the Holy Ghost and get them all riled up and get the ministers going out and doing this and that I want to do that too but I'll tell you one thing if we can start in the home with Mama then it'll make it a lot easier for all the rest of us preachers don't just let it stop in Mama but let it get a hold to Daddy as well now watch this again he says I think mother the good true mother is the Fifth Gospel Matthew Mark Luke John mother can you imagine a prophet of God placing motherhood right in line not not skip a whole big bunch of words but right after John mother Matthew Mark Luke John and mother why we look at Matthew and Mark and luk was said what great men what great men and they were but there's not a one of them that can take your place mother oh my Matthew Mark Luke John mother mother gets them first yes sir that's the one who brings them up first is Mother well brother Donnie all my kids are gone and I've got grandkids so now you're figuring you're at you're at the end of it huh carry that same thing right over to your grandchildren now remember there's a headship and an order in the home and of course God does not want the grandfather and the grandmother to be the head of the home which your daughter or son whichever it is is founded but our ability to influence our lives should never stop that's why Paul even went as far to say that the Elder women in the church let them teach the younger what what they supposed to do get a bunch of quotes together and get a bunch of scripture together teach them by your life sisters there's a way to preach the gospel without ever standing behind this pull pit what do you do you show the young daughters how to love their husbands you show the young sisters in our church the right kind of Godly life don't go around back bashing around on them beating around on them you see them dressed in a certain way that ain't right that's why God calls pastors to be able to handle lot of that but you'll make enemies and put grievance between you and the daughters of God at the church when you step out of your position God never calls you to try to bring correction and say well I'll tell you one thing I've seen a young girl dress a certain certain thing don't you think the Lord is not mindful of that and the Lord will lay it on the Shepherd's Heart or The Minister's heart find your place and stay there and tear hell why you're doing it when you get in your place oh my you don't have to be intimidated because you're not a preacher you don't have to feel intimidated because you're not an evangelist you can know that God called you to be a mother it's going to be a great reward one of these days notice this in the true Easter seal he's talking about children here he said they Little Treasures that God has given you the responsibility of raising and I've always said and made this kind of a saying to mothers we know written of four gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John but there's a Fifth Gospel can you believe that he would place a Godly mother as a gospel a gospel what is the gospel good news my my notice this Matthew Mark Luke and John but there's a fif gospel Unwritten Unwritten that's mother so mama don't sit down and say this is the generation of Jesus Christ when Mary was an espouse to her husband Joseph so on and so on that's not what mama's going to do mama's going to teach her daughters the right kind of Life mama ain't going to go around just with a measuring tape and measure the length of her skirt or do all this and that and the other show her mothers show your daughter why that it's good to dress Godly and be moral show her thy life and show her these girls and these women out here after they do come to God and many of them do and see how that Mark upon them that they got as a teenager haunts them their entire life and they still deal with that because of what they did show them the way a gospel preacher does a preacher that stands up and beats and beats and whips and beats on people all the time oh my goodness I have a hard time sitting under a man like that myself sure whoop me when I need it but after you get done whooping on me give me a little bit of oil and wine in my wounds and tell me what I can do sure lay it on me man hit me up one side and down the other but when you get done doing it don't leave me in condemnation don't leave me in a bad State pray with me lead me back into the presence of God oh my there's a Fifth Gospel Unwritten that's mother she gets them before Matthew Mark Luke and John's teaching gets them don't you see Mama gets that baby before Matthew does mama gets Mama gets that baby before Mark does it can't read Matthew it can't read mark it can't read Luke it can't read John but mama had it when she was carrying it in her womb she heard its voice her voice rather and whenever that baby is born it don't take it long to know who mama is because God gave it an affinity between thy child and that mother can't you see why Satan purposed it so many years ago to destroy the backbone of our nation come on children the backbone of our nation is not pastors it is not evangelists it is not songwriters or singers the backbone of our nation is Womanhood and motherhood don't you see why Satan wants to do so many of his things in this day are aimed at women and girls oh my get them out of their place get them out of where God wants them to be let a television raise their young ons if they believe in young ons and they get to a place they don't even want no young ons no more they want to kill them and every one of them are going to stand before God at the day of judgment I wish somebody would say Amen if you believe it but you realize it ain't no wonder that Satan wanted to do it that way if he can break it out yonder but let's not stop out there what if he can break it inside the ranks of our message and our sisters are no longer willing to show your daughters and your sons oh the importance of having a godly woman in your life oh you say well brother Donnie that's just for the girls it ain't for the girls I will tell many of the young sisters in our church when they're interested in a young man especially if he's going to another church and they're not really familiar with him I'll tell them and give them this advice you watch how that young man treats his mother you watch how that young man will treat his sisters and the females that are around him and that may give you a pretty good idea of how he will treat you because God made the home come on somebody God never made a child to be raised by two fathers whoever heard of such Tommy R out of hell God never meant for two women to get married and try to bring a baby well go ahead and bring one if you two women getting together can bring a baby I dare you do it I dare you men who want to marry a man go ahead and bring a baby but what do you do you'll adopt one and you'll pervert that child don't you understand why this transgender move and this thing is going to change an entire generation a generation of young people are being changed towards sodomites why because they're raising them as kids and they pervert they're thinking they look at two daddies they look at two mommies they see two women kissing two men kissing oh come on don't sit there and look at me and what does it do it warps that little child sinking so mama was a lesbian Mama one and Mama two was a lesbian what do you think that child is going to be but the Bible says train a child up in the way that it should go and when it gets old it will not depart from it let's raise our kids according to God's [Applause] word oh my goodness well that wasn't part of the sermon but it is now but there's a fa a Fifth Gospel Unwritten that's mother she gets them before Matthew Mark Luke and John's teaching gets them so the responsibilities is placed upon you mothers and fathers to raise these children for the kingdom of God yes sir and God don't want none of us to raise our kids up to be spoiled rotten selfish brats amen boy it seems warm in here to me is it just me or you understand God will hold you responsible for raising brats that are self-centered and selfish it'll take a pastor years and years to get that out of them if he ever does wo y'all say me Monday standing on the side of the road down there interchange off of Rome Street and Y 26 we work for food can't put preach cuz I know better than that to raise these children he says for the kingdom of God I'm sure that's your heart's desire I believe as much as I believe that quote there are mother sitting here today that is your heart's desire some of you your children's already raised and gone well say brother Donnie they're too old I can't do nothing don't you never believe that you've still got knees ain't you You' still got words right hear in this mouth you can pray amen come on somebody well they're out there in the world that may be so but the power of a mother's prayer and a Father's prayer is more powerful hallelujah it's more powerful than drugs it's more powerful than alcohol prayer is the most powerful weapon that God ever put into the hands of human beings oh my so you see every Christian that comes to the Lord Jesus has a Ministry yes sir every one of you men women boys girls don't raise your hands but I wonder how many of you even know yours because you think Ministry Ministry oh that's brother Daryl and that's brother John brother Joel Brown brother johnon brother Michael brother Jo you know brother Donnie I me that that that's that's Ministry no that's part of the ministry but you have one too each one of us has a different Ministry each one works different each one of you has a Ministry a separate Ministry all say that word with me all that comes into Christ now here's the key if you're not into him and you're just a church member then you don't have one but if you are baptized into the body you have a Ministry you say how is that so well look at your body your kidneys don't you appreciate them you ever thank God for your kidneys most of you don't you don't even think about them unless they're hurting or you get a kidney stone then you love them oh you pray for him you pray for him what about other parts of your body it has a Ministry yes sir most of the time we don't think that much about it as long as it's working well until the doctor says your bow duct is stopped up this is going on that's going on oh oh no oh what am I going to do well can I live without this certain certain thing no you can't live without it if it don't get better you're going to die oh my my that little thing that you've never even laid your eyes on becomes so important and so vital I guess that's one thing that among many that I don't like about a big church now some of y'all I've heard of over the years well I I'd love to go there I already like brother Don's Ministry and this that and the other but I don't like a big church neither do I but I ain't like some of you I want to please him so I can't pick a small Church to go to because I prefer it humanly if it' been left up to me I would have never left Kentucky 120 people or so something like that oh yeah I'd much rather been there no nobody knew me everybody left me alone nobody threatened to kill me and all that sort of thing I I I I would have still been happy right there if it's left up to me but you see my life is not my own so I can't tell the Lord now look Lord I'm going over there because it's a small Church small Church small problems bigger Church bigger problems bigger than that church bigger problem big church big problems and I don't like problems okay I wish every Christian here was a Whirlpool Christian but even they're made Chine anymore so even that name don't mean nothing but most of the Christians that I've pastured are not Whirlpool some of them want to throw me in the whirl pool and push the button and try to ring me out but you see the way I look at it God has a need for preachers that can pasture his troubled children I tell brother Tim PR and brother Ron Spencer all the time they're my buddies so I tell them all the time it looks like to me that y'all got all the perfect people to your church all the Flawless all the wonderful magnanimous tendous tremendous all these great adjectives that I can come up and and they're moving to your church and I get stuck with the rest I told brother Mark Spencer brother Ron's brother the other day I said buddy it looks like to me that brother Tim and brother Ron got all them delicious Saints they got all them high profile glory to God Mountaintop Christian and me and you must have got the scrap and the leftovers he said I'm hearing you brother but you know what God's got to have somebody but I'm going to tell you all and just s is between me and you all okay everybody brother Tim's Church ain't perfect and nether NE is he cuz I know him everybody in brother Ron's Church ain't perfect and neither is he cuz I know him there ain't no perfect preachers there ain't no perfect churches every one of them are flawed from the pull pit to the back every person that streams us is flawed and we all need help and God knew that about us he knew I would let him down he knew I would fail him and he saved me anyway I don't mind telling you if I would have known the way some of my friends would have treated me over the years I would have never let him be my friend in the first place cuz when you weigh it all out what you got out of them didn't weigh up near as much as the pain they inflicted on you but unlike the Lord Jesus he knew all my faults and my failures and my mistakes and how many times I would fall short of his glory and he said I love you anyway I'm going to save you anyway I'm going to call you to preach anyway you're going to mess up some of your words are going to come out sideways and some of them's going to come out upside down and it'll take the Holy Ghost if anybody ever gets anything out of your preaching but I'm going to go ahead and call you to preach I'm going to go ahead and save you I'm going to fill you with the Holy Ghost well aren't you glad he looked at you the same way I see your false I see your issues I see your trouble but I'm going to get you there I'm going to prove to the devil I am greater than your faults I am greater than your mistakes I am greater than your shortcoming I will prove it because I'm [Applause] God oh my all that comes into Christ has a Ministry that's right not only the preacher but you have a Ministry to something something you can do I hope this don't sound sacriligious but usually God has to drive you into your correct Ministry some Methodist Brethren the other day received the Holy Ghost and Farmers up in Indiana and all they was just all of fire and they said I've been reading a book said brother brandom shall we come together now and seek for our ministry I said no you'll run yourself doing that I said you don't do that I said a man that's always seeking for God to do something search and such and such a thing usually don't Mount to very much it's the man that doesn't want to do it that's the one that God can use it's amazing many young men have come to me over the years and thinking maybe they were called to preach and I always get amazed at it because some of the ones who come to me already had 12 or 15 sermons lined out and they just want to talk about me talk to me whether they even called or not and for some of them you can forget talking them out of it cuz they're already in the ministry and in their mind and what do they mount to nothing one of the biggest traps Satan can lay on a man is to convince him that he's called to preach or called to be a certain aspect of the ministry and yet never amounts to anything only hinders the work of God well come on now children you not believe some of the things that I asked and I ask every one of them the same thing tell me how God called you well well brother Donnie I I was reading a scripture on Sunday morning and I come to church and you read from that same scripture I said brother that happens to my wife does that mean she's called to preach too well I was out the other day and I saw this Bumblebee and I I said brother look a call is exactly that the Lord Jesus called Peter personally he called Luke personally he called Paul personally what did God tell you when he called you your call is the Foundation well God didn't exactly I mean it was just like that I I just felt impressed I I just felt now I want you to notice how he does this now this doesn't just apply to preachers this applies to all of us and finding our position it's a man that doesn't want to do it that's the one God can use look at Moses and Paul different ones running from it trying to get away from it you take a fell that's always Lord I'll do this if you'll do this and things like that God knows he'd be a stuffed shirt anyhow so it just takes somebody who don't want to do it now to me this is so sad it's heartbreaking actually he takes somebody who don't want to do it and say maybe I can use him a little while till he gets to be one so even in some of the preachers that God will use God you uses them on this option right here I'll go ahead and use him for a while until he becomes a stuffed shirt thinking he's so great and he's so big and he don't need my leadership no more or he don't check what he's feeling led to do by the word and so on you understand Lord have mercy maybe I can use him I'm reminded the question answer in 195 n that he said God has a hard time trying to find a man that he can use cuz he said with many the more he uses them the bigger they get the more he uses them the bigger they get I don't think I'll ever forget when I quoted that 30 some years ago in Happy Valley brother Johnson was standing back down with his hand many of you remember many you young people didn't ever even meet him our brother lost his sight he was standing there with his hands on the back of the chair always love the word always into the word and whenever I quoted that quote then brother abam turned around and said if God can find a person that the more he uses them the little they get so brother Johnson was standing with his hands on the back of the Pew like this and he went and the quote goes on to say the more he uses him the ler by the time I got done P guys in on the floor now if you know why that quote meant so much to him he was acting out what he heard I'll tell you children my preaching is worthless if you don't act out what you're hearing I ain't talking about being a bunch of put on now I'm talking about making that your life and your actions every day are what you are hearing are we ready to go he's ready to come oh my can I have a few more minutes he says I'll try to get away from it one time great Ministries has always been somebody trying to get away from it not one who's always CA God let him do something for them and then they're all puffed out big and how great and everything but a man that doesn't want to do it he's forced you know why we got this new place out here I didn't want to do it I don't like change we lived in our house about 16 17 years Carol something like that the walls were the same color they were when we built it and still would be but I'm married to a woman God bless her heart that loves change and she's married to a man that don't like change so it takes grace and mercy and understanding to work between change and no change Brother Gary Harris taking his hand and doing this over to Sister Lona this morning you're in hot water now buddy I made all kinds of excuses but I am so glad that I finally you know one thing I did I listened to brother Jim bab and his things at the church I got the deacons together and asked the Deacon brother brothers tell me why do you think we need that and others I got together why do we need it and once I did that I realized the need was there so what do I do the fear of doing it do I let that control me oh but Lord what if we do most every time you go to build a new church it'll always cause the church split it's amazing there will be people that will leave because you build one and there'll be more people that'll come in because you built one and I'm thinking don't make no sense at all what in the world does that even do so I ask you was it the right decision look at what God has done look at the meetings that we've been allowed to have look at the youth services the special meetings so on and so on aren't you glad I didn't listen to me aren't you glad I didn't go what Donnie wanted to do what it's the same with you in your ministry that you will have to make decisions for for the betterment of your children when you yourself may not even want to do it I can tell you of a certain Pastor a man that was called to a certain area and they' been preaching there for quite some time he contacted me several times actually came here and talked to me also on the phone as well and he said Brother Don just in a real dilemma I know you've been in that state before he said help me guide me help me so I talked to him well the brother had almost convinced he was going to take this church at this certain certain place about a situation come up in his family had children at home and because of that situation he did not feel that it was the right thing to do you think wow what a man that would acknowledge now it was a church it was a good-sized church and he would have been one of the one of the great M of great gifted brother but he looked at his family and he looked at his need you see sometimes it ain't all about us as parents it ain't all about everything working around us come on somebody and preach with with me sometimes many times we'll have to do things that will be difficult don't you think it's hard on me as your Shepherd to have to bend you over my knee spiritually and wear you out it breaks my heart every time I have to but I'll tell you what I keep before me what I keep before me is me standing before the Lord and you all standing there behind me and you come running and screaming our precious brother thank you thank you thank you for telling the truth that's what I keep before me and that's why I say it hurts them it hurts me but it will be worth at all after a while but you see many pastors do the same thing that many parents do well I don't want to say nothing to them I don't want to drive them from the Lord so I'm going to let them do whatever they want to do you know they're living in my house and everything and I mean if they don't want to live right I just whatever they want to do and they want to behave and I don't want to drive them from the Lord and pastors are do the same thing well we're trying to win people so we win them by compromising our standards so we don't preach on hair no more we don't preach on dress no more we don't certainly don't mention any social things that are get you in hot water cuz it ain't just me this who whose face is fled on YouTube but you all too so I realize that and it's painful for you to do it but first of all I have to lay down at night and if I compromise I could not stand myself I could not live with myself and I have to answer to him I want to meet him in peace not in war parents you're going to have to stand before him oh my notice this oh he says Jehovah jarra each one of us has a work to do each one of us has a Ministry and the peculiarity of it and so forth it's it's together to glorify God you see friends this is why this move around the message of no need of going to church and no need of we know many people would love to come but they can't it's where they live I ain't talking about them people I'm talking about those that make fun of going to church and make fun of pastors can't you see how Antichrist in theory that is because they think they don't need any body and nobody needs them I can be just as good a Christian as staying at home according to the very Prophet you say you believe he said the exact opposite cuz he said those words people say well I can be just as good a Christian staying home he said you cannot let me hurry we'll get down here and I'll I'll close I didn't realize this is going to take so long sir I just thought I was going to deal with this part a little bit and get over to the good part well I shouldn't say that this is good church ageb that's why no man can ever come along and say the holy man is a pope or the holy man is a bishop or a priest the holy man is Christ the holy spirit in us how dare the hierarchy declar the leoty has no word to say wow each one has something to say each has a work each has a Ministry the Holy Ghost came at Pentecost and separated himself on each that it might be fulfilled where of Christ said at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you brother Donnie when will my Ministry cease when you do when you do look at brother Benton I don't know how long it's been since our brother has been physically able to preach a sermon and the way his situation come upon him he been having a meeting and then he gets sick and then it's like it leads into the state to where he's at today but what a strength it is is to me for him coming there don't you think it'd be easier for him to set it home some of y'all think you got aches and pains you imagine how much our brother has dealt with the thousands and maybe even millions of miles that he's traveled around the world and and go up into places in the jungles where the bigname preachers wouldn't go oh my just him being here ministers to me what about anybody else is brother Benton a blessing to you the family that's here with us visting from Texas and we was talking to them the other day and they talking about how they've been streaming the services here for several years and they said they felt like they knew the people and they started calling certain people's names and they said that people didn't realize what that individual meant to them just one it was their worship and another it was their sincerity and how it minister of course they didn't know what I was studying on here but you realize it's not just what you're up and doing and what you're saying it's the way you worship it's the way you press through it's the sincerity that you have when you pray the way you raise your hand so much about us can minister to others how many is so blessed by Brother Harry's singing and his music how many's blessed by brother Larry brother lar pays gives so much time to preparing for the special songs he gives so much time many times by himself rest of the brothers work schedule won't allow them to be here and he give it up why so the singing can be as good as possible and they can have the right key they can know where to sing how to even sometimes I'll tell them if if they need to come up here and be reverent but even come in here to the church or they can be able to adjust the volume so we can minimize mistakes I don't know about you this is my life I don't want to give Jesus you know just just a high something or another I want to give him my very best I study and study and study and study brother Daryl's told me many times when we're out together out preaching together hunting together and might come into a place I was at in Illinois a few years ago he and I were there together I had a computer in my lap I had an iPad laying on this side and another iPad laying there and another another computer laying over here he walked in just shook his head said brother Donnie if I studied that much it drive me crazy but you know what every one of us have to give God our very best that's the way I'm made I get up I want to give the Holy Ghost so much to use it'll come out of me like a Gatling gun when the anointing falls on my memory falls on my recall I don't want it to be well the Cardinals beat the the Packers and the Packers beat the bleeders and the bleeders beat the boers and who whoever all that nonsense is I don't want all them sports stats in my head I want the prophet said this and Paul said that and Jeremiah said that that's why I don't feed on a bunch of this nonsense so when I get up I can speak the word speak the scripture speak the message oh children that ain't just good for a preacher each one of us need to say God help me in my Ministry [Music] let me wind it down with this you young people realize some of you have influence on others at our church some of you young men have influence on some of the other young men do you realize if you start leaning a certain way or wearing a certain type of clothes or a certain thing or getting a certain type of attitude or listening to a certain type of music or I'm just doing that cuz I want to oh no it's not just you you see what if you affect one more young man or two more young men or three more young men in our church and then they start acting like you do you understand that almighty God is going to hold you responsible for that influence same with the young sisters yes sir so if a young man or a young woman gets to church and I'll watch them in church I I can tell a lot by watching them in church where they are in their walk with God they're sitting there and sniggering and hitting one another and laughing and talking and don't pay no attention don't say Amen to the word I know they're in a backsliding state you don't impress me by how much you jump and shout and scream and holler what get God's attention is you keep his word and part of keeping his word is Amen in his word so one sister in our church and we've got them they're leaders they're sisters that have influence above other sisters and brothers that do the same don't ever think well this is just me it ain't got nothing to do with nobody that's not the way a body works so a cancer cell gets in one part of your body you think it's going to stay there what is that what's that devil want to do Spread spread amen and many of them are totally painless and almost symptomless until the person is nearly dead then when they go they've got pains they've got this at and the other and it shows up on the scan we hate to tell you you're eat up how can that be I I've never even had any any pain any issues why because the body is ministered to so God made the body to be able to catch these things yes MH so the LMP nodes the LMP glands things pass through it and it's meant to catch it there but sometimes it just overwhelms it and it passes right on through into the main trunk of the body or coming up this way and going out what is it it's like the spiritual body of Christ don't think that being nosy and trying to run your life don't think that others that see you aren't concerned about you and they see you're not sitting where you used to sit and you're not singing the way you used to sing and you don't clap your hands no more you're there but you're not a participator a real concerned brother or sister's praying for you you know what they may even say something to you brother you okay sister you okay now you see by doing that they're not necessarily trying to be your pastor they're trying to minister to you I've been concerned about you you done okay I just been worried about you don't seem like you're you're the same I've been missing you in Sunday school I've been missing you at the youth services what is that that's a body and you realize you'll come to a certain spot and they say well I'm going through this that and other as a member of the body functioning in Your Capacity you'll understand there's a spot you can't go beyond well I'll tell you what that that's beyond me you need to go see brother Donnie or you need to go talk to brother Joe brother Rob maybe brother John brother Daryl somebody because that's beyond me I cannot act as a kidney if I'm a liver I cannot act as a heart if I'm a fingernail yes sir now that little guy he ain't very big he don't pump no blood he don't even think my little fingernail is as dumb as a fingernail oh some of y'all got educated finger do you well God bless your little hearts he can't think he can't process thoughts but anybody in here ever hit that little thing with a hammer oh and you hit the wrong nail or you do something and lose that oh boy you can't hardly touch oh man I'll be so glad when that thing gets growed back out what's its whole purpose to protect yes sir God didn't give you them things sisters so you could multicolor them they serve their purpose and not being worldly but in being Protectors of that nail bed praise God let's bow our heads my hallelujah praise you Lord Jesus how many be honest with me today and say brother AR this this minister to me today this spoke to my heart God bless you me too those of you that will strin the service those of you that will go by back and archive it may you bow your heads there with us Norway Switzerland Iceland Africa all over the world may the spirit of God just come to you right where you are maybe in the Krueger National Park maybe in the office in South African Airways wherever it is that you are May the presence of the Holy Spirit deal with each of us to anoint us greater in our ministry for some of you it might be that God when you hear the prayer request turned in and this one's sick and that one's sick and something just touches your heart to send them a card and you think wow that ain't much huh it may not be much to you but to those who receive it it the Lord years and years ago put that on Carol's heart Carol don't feel like she has much of a Ministry she doesn't feel like she does very much she tells me all this time I want to be standing there with you whenever you walk up before the Lord and I know I won't have no reward I said Carol the prophet tells us with every man that stands there the a good woman standing behind him I would not be what I am today if it was not for that woman that God placed with me and the church said she not just a pastor's wife she's a Godly pastor's wife she listens to tapes she reads her Bible she prays she's always been that way and remember that was the woman that never even heard the story of David and Goliath and Jonah and the whale till after she got saved at the age of 16 she was not brought up in a Bible loving family or home or a churchgoing home some of you kids heard these stories when you two and three years old but Carol never heard them I told you she shared it with our youth here few weeks back you ought to seen the looks on some of our faces of our youths as she sat there and told them she never even heard about Daniel in the Lion's Den till she was 16 years old but God had a great purpose for her life sisters brothers young men young women when he saves you and baptizes you into the body he has a place for you and no no one can take your place might be to encourage might be to sing maybe some of you are not soloist but maybe God would give you a good voice when the choir sings where you could merge in with them some of you in your ministry it may never be acknowledged publicly from this Pulpit but when you walk before the Lord Jesus may you be like that little woman that God put it on her heart she was not a preacher but she just kept feeling it in her heart to have a meeting there in the little Community where she lived but she was no preacher how could she do it so she runs a a little old building and talks to a preacher that she knows and the preacher comes and preaches and a little boy comes up to the altar long has shaggy hair gives his heart to God that preacher LED thousands if not Millions to the Lord Jesus when he stands there to get his reward no doubt God will call that little woman we don't even know what her name is but God didn't want her to be without a reward little mothers little single girls sisters at our church you've got something to do heavenly father I come before you today I'm thanking you you didn't give to me a Ministry like brother Tim that would be called The Prince of preachers maybe brother Ron that would have such great Miracles or brother Daryl as he travels around the world and has absolutely phenomenal things happen in his ministry maybe Lord some of these brothers from Africa and India and around the world Lord Jesus I want to be faithful to what you've given me maybe brother John brother Michael brother Jonathan some of these other brothers saying Lord Brother Pete what am I supposed to do what do you want me to do Lord help me me was talking to one of them not long ago and I said brother I'd rather have three doors to preach in that God gave me than to have a whole bunch of doors that I open Myself by calling preachers and trying to promote yourself and it's sad to say Lord but we have so many especially the younger message preachers that are doing that Lord I want what you give me I don't want to have to ride on the coattail of another man so I can build my platform on them Paul even practice that and I'd like to bring it to him sometime if you'd let me that he chose not to even go name the name of Christ he said where it had been mentioned lest he would build on another man's foundation and if it wasn't for some preachers only had being identified under the reputation of another man they would have nothing Lord Jesus we don't want to be identified with this man that man we want to be identified with you so if you give us a work and it may seems small but if that's what you gave us you make no mistakes I'd rather have my small work than have a big work and fall flat on my face because I was not designed to carry that type of load and responsibility I've seen men because they felt like they were not being used enough they would venture out beyond what they were ordained to do and wind up destroying their family because of it help each young man each young woman Lord God I pray you'd move among our youths and help them Father maybe some of them will be like the household of stephanus they will addict themselves Lord I I'm GL I'm glad and grateful that brother Rob has some ideas sometimes of them doing things and brother Joe not just prayer meetings and not just services but making little gift baskets and taking it to the shut tins and maybe getting together with a guitar and going and maybe ministering to them what that is worth then people sitting there for hours on in with nobody to come and visit them and see them and then they wonder what they can do for God you told us in your word I was sick and you visited me I was naked and you clothed me and the righteous will say when did we ever see you Lord and you said when you did this to the least of these my brothers you do it to me help our young people to realize when they get together maybe make a meal and take it to some of the shutting and so they go sing to them they may not realize it but they're singing to Jesus brother Bram after the Christmas event there in 59 or 61 I don't remember which and the church had bought him a suit and brother Neville a suit and he gets up to thank him afterwards for doing so and he prayed that you'd bless them and he said help them to realize they bought them two suits for Jesus oh God forgive us how much of our life have we wasted wanting to do great big things and we've stepped over multitudes of little things we could do every day forgive me Jesus I realize I'm an old man I don't know how many more years I've got on the Earth but how much every time I've got left help me that I'll not just reach for big things it's hard it's hard when you have a global Ministry and a Global Effect and you're contacted from around the world it's hard Lord to keep that balance of the little small tiny tiny things that are so important I imagine brother Collins he told me about it years ago the first time that he saw brother brandham he walked into his house and was introduced to him brother brandham and sister brandham were washing dishes brother Brandon was standing there with an apron on Elijah with an apron on washing dishes but maybe sister mey needed his presence help us Brothers to realize sometimes it's not the great big things we do for our wife and our children it's just them little small things to let them know we're thinking about it maybe just a random text in the middle of the day with no particular thing to say other than I'm sorry I haven't told you today I love you I want you to know you're the woman of my dreams oh Jesus forgive us Lord we love you father thank you Lord can we stand together praise the Lord praise the Lord I worship you Jesus I worship you Lord God thank you Father praise the Lord praise the Lord what ever you are whoever you are whatever gender you are the Lord has a Ministry for you if you've been baptized into his body maybe you're seed and have been baptized yet but he'll have one there waiting for you when you get there you're a father you're a mother you're a young person in our church use your influence to influence others a young lady you older sisters maybe your children are gone your grandchildren are out and doing their own thing well brother Donnie I ain't got no more don't you never think that you keep on praying you keep trying to influence others that you go to church with let them see your life remember a life lived by the word is the word expressed the word expressed let's sing something together he let me just be honest with you this morning I would much rather be some of you who think you are doing nothing than I would preachers who overstep this message and seemingly are doing great things but they're doing it on the foundation of error you see I run across a quote the other day or brother bam telling about adding to the word and taking away from the word I never found any other place where he said it quite like this it's it's amazing and he was warning people not to take the word and polish it up to meet the day so you don't take it and throw it away you don't take and cut it all to pieces but you just polish it you just make it easy so you know we don't we rough the the rough edges we polish them off and we don't say this word cuz we've got another word that's smoother easier nicer more gentle and you polish it up and he said your part will be taken from The Book of Life oh don't you love him with all your heart how many feels like you need help amen with your ministry your ministry as a mother your ministry as a father your ministry as a young person in our church and you realize the Lord spoke to you today and you've not used your influence always in a positive way Hallelujah am Hallelujah Jesus here I
