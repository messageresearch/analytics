[40:41] people have believed that for
[40:44] generations for
[40:47] centuries yet we have more
[40:50] prophecies
[40:51] more
[40:53] signs of that being true than any
[40:57] generation that's ever been on the face
[40:59] of the
[41:00] Earth I'm glad I'm prepared for it
[41:03] aren't
[41:04] you praise the lord we greet you today
[41:07] in the name of the Lord Jesus what a
[41:11] great privilege it is for us to be
[41:12] gathered together
[41:14] today not only to come and have our our
[41:18] needs met and to be able to sing
[41:21] together and worship and pray and bring
[41:23] requests but also to be able to minister
[41:27] to our husband the Lord
[41:30] Jesus Prophet tells us that the wife
[41:36] ministers to the
[41:38] husband I know it's so in the natural
[41:41] sense I'm know with my wife she prepares
[41:45] meals she picks out these clothes and
[41:49] irons them and you brothers that have
[41:52] wives and you know how that is and she
[41:54] ministers to you and the Lord Jesus
[41:58] is here today in this service not only
[42:00] just to help
[42:02] us whether not you understand
[42:05] it he so orchestrated it that he needs
[42:10] ministering
[42:11] to
[42:13] loving gently caring for him I want to
[42:17] give him that don't
[42:20] you let's read
[42:22] today Matthew chap 8 ver14
[42:29] we've been speaking about
[42:31] um the rights that the bride has
[42:35] and today I'd like to look at the right
[42:39] to a
[42:41] Ministry the right to a
[42:45] Ministry Matthew
[42:48] 8:14 and when Jesus was coming to
[42:50] Peter's house he saw his wife's mother
[42:54] laid and sick of a fever
[42:58] and he touched her hand and the fever
[43:02] left
[43:03] her and she
[43:05] arose and
[43:07] ministered unto them as I mentioned to
[43:10] you last Sunday she didn't take a scroll
[43:12] or the Torah or anything like that and
[43:16] take a scripture and tell Jesus and all
[43:18] the rest of the Apostles to sit down and
[43:21] she was going to preach to them but she
[43:24] actually ministered to them
[43:27] so she prepared them food and ministered
[43:31] to them just simply as a reminder but
[43:33] the word ministered here is the comes
[43:35] from the Greek word the same word that
[43:36] we have the word Deacon from it's deonia
[43:42] is the Greek word and it means to help
[43:45] or minister to serve
[43:48] food 1 Corinthians
[43:53] 1615 I beseech you Brethren you know the
[43:56] house of
[43:58] stephanus that it is the first fruits of
[44:01] aaya and that they have addicted
[44:06] themselves to the ministry of the Saints
[44:09] so here it's the same word again deonia
[44:13] service ministering the service of those
[44:16] who
[44:17] prepare and present food I may like to
[44:21] be remembered today as we pray I got a
[44:24] text from Brother Brad Gilbert earlier
[44:26] and
[44:27] been really sick all during the night
[44:29] vomiting a lot of pain and stuff so he
[44:32] wanted us to to remember him so let's
[44:35] pray for him as well today Heavenly
[44:38] Father we love you so much
[44:41] today here in these songs Lord Jesus
[44:45] and
[44:47] KN knowing that there's a place for
[44:51] us No More
[44:54] Tears no more sighing no more sorrow
[44:58] no burdens no
[45:00] difficulties then Harry's song following
[45:03] up with it Lord or almost
[45:06] home father we know that sometimes that
[45:09] last smile can be the hardest one of
[45:14] all I remember several years ago Lord
[45:17] when I was with brother bisc and we were
[45:20] on a safarians in bubbly and he had shot
[45:25] an animal and it had got away from us
[45:27] and we treed after that for many many
[45:32] miles on foot he stepped on a thorn and
[45:36] broke it off in his foot and he was in a
[45:39] lot of pain and we wasn't prepared for
[45:42] that so we didn't take anything to drink
[45:44] anything to eat and it got so difficult
[45:49] and the brothers that we were with said
[45:51] look you Brothers you're going to have
[45:53] to stay here don't you go anywhere we'll
[45:56] go back can get
[45:58] help and sure enough they did they went
[46:01] and got drinks and some food and things
[46:04] and it seemed that we couldn't make it
[46:07] any farther but help was on the way we
[46:11] believe Lord Jesus no matter how
[46:13] difficult this life may get and the
[46:15] things we go through there's help on the
[46:19] way we're not just looking for a
[46:21] temporary help but we're looking for a
[46:23] permanent change amen father you saw all
[46:27] the needs hundreds of hands went up
[46:28] today that signified needs desires

[46:55] something from your word that would help

[46:59] way father I pray we commit the service
[47:02] to you Lord Jesus I'm going to preach

[47:19] mercy that you'd be with our sister Lord

[47:29] children we know if it were not for the
[47:31] grace of God there wouldn't be a one of
[47:34] us Left
[47:35] Alive cuz he hates us so much but we
[47:38] know the purpose of God must be
[47:40] fulfilled in our lives and the devil
[47:43] cannot take us until that purpose is
[47:45] done be with our sister father May the
[47:48] angels of God accompany her Lord doctors

[47:54] father we pray in the name of Jesus
[47:57] Jesus amen God bless you Saints you may
[48:01] be seated
[48:08] today Ministry is such a wonderful thing
[48:12] what
[48:13] God gives to individuals
[48:17] to help them to help others of course
[48:20] Ministry is not for the sake of the one
[48:23] who has it it's not for the sake of
[48:28] making one famous Rich
[48:32] important it's to be able to as the word
[48:35] certainly designates minister to
[48:38] others every Ministry has a great cost a
[48:42] great price that it exacts from the
[48:46] individual who has it and many times
[48:49] from family members and Friends of that
[48:53] one who has it most of the time a
[48:56] minister
[48:58] is not the only one that has to pay a
[49:00] price for that Ministry depending on
[49:03] what type of ministry it is and scope
[49:05] that it'll be how much coverage it will
[49:07] have it can exact a price from a lot of
[49:11] people and it's the same with whether
[49:14] it's a housewife or a farmer or a
[49:17] businessman each one of us has a
[49:20] Ministry how many believes that today
[49:23] let me just go back a little bit on a
[49:26] couple of things that we looked at
[49:27] Sunday last Sunday and the prophet says
[49:31] it this way many times people go out and
[49:33] see an evangelist like for instance our
[49:35] brother Billy Graham what good would it
[49:37] do for me to try to be like Billy Graham
[49:40] I couldn't do it if I had to I've got a
[49:43] Ministry that I've got to take care of
[49:46] and the next man's got his ministry each
[49:50] one has got a
[49:52] Ministry even to the
[49:55] housewife to for the
[49:57] housewife has a Ministry of ministering
[50:01] the word of God and yet we know we don't
[50:04] believe in women preachers so what in
[50:07] the world is a
[50:10] housewife going to minister the word and
[50:13] to whom will she
[50:16] Ministry and I want you to realize that
[50:18] he says here the housewife has a
[50:20] Ministry of ministering the word of God
[50:22] and every person that comes to the Lord
[50:27] Jesus has some sort of
[50:29] ministry that ministry will be unique
[50:34] according to your family according to
[50:36] your makeup according to your call
[50:40] doesn't mean that every one of us is
[50:42] going to start picking up Bibles and you
[50:44] know having discourses of Doctrine And
[50:47] discussing great theological terms and
[50:49] this and that and everybody's going to
[50:51] quit their job everybody's going to
[50:54] start entering into the ministry well
[50:56] but believe it or not sometimes your
[51:00] job is your
[51:03] ministry you see it's such an important
[51:06] thing this is why
[51:08] Satan spends so much of his time to keep
[51:12] each of us out of our
[51:15] ministry for me personally it's been a
[51:17] battle in my Ministry since I started
[51:20] preaching whenever I was an 18-year-old
[51:22] boy 50 years now I've been preaching
[51:27] has it got any easier it's actually
[51:30] harder now than it's ever been and in
[51:33] every
[51:34] Ministry you will face
[51:37] discouragement you will feel like your
[51:40] work is in
[51:42] vain you will feel like that you're
[51:44] putting forth so much effort and doing
[51:47] so much stuff and in this life it may
[51:51] look as if though you're getting so few
[51:54] results according to the effort you put
[51:57] forth it would be understandable if
[51:59] every Ministry housewife preacher farmer
[52:02] electrician painter um what construction
[52:05] whatever you're in if we hardly put
[52:08] forth any effort at all and we just you
[52:11] know we just took it as casual and ain't
[52:13] no big deal God called me God saved me
[52:16] God made me a housewife God made me a
[52:17] mother God made me a father and I'm
[52:19] supposed to minister to my family but
[52:22] I'll just sort of do as I want to do and
[52:25] and he'll he'll understand understand
[52:27] and he'll compensate for the difference
[52:29] but even for you mothers that give so
[52:32] much and how much do you do for your
[52:35] family and it can go seemingly so
[52:39] unappreciated you prepare a meal and you
[52:42] may spend several hours and getting it
[52:44] ready you may start early in the morning
[52:46] doing certain things and then you'll do
[52:48] a little bit more as the day progresses
[52:50] and when your family sits down to eat
[52:53] all they can say is well this was burn a
[52:56] little bit and this was a little bit too
[52:58] salty and this had a little bit too much
[53:00] pepper and I was wanting chicken I
[53:02] wasn't wanting tenderloin for for supper
[53:06] and for a wife a mother it can seem like
[53:10] the only thing that you could hear from
[53:12] your family is what they didn't like
[53:15] what they didn't want and what they wish
[53:17] they would have had and very little
[53:20] appreciation for your ministry come on
[53:24] I'm sure you sisters have been there
[53:26] before and does it make you want to cook
[53:28] another meal or does it make you the
[53:30] next time you go to the grocery store
[53:32] want to buy stofers lasagna spaghetti
[53:36] rotti and whatever more and say push the
[53:39] button pal fix what you want suit
[53:43] yourself because I can't please none of
[53:47] you now I'm sure none of our sisters
[53:49] have ever said anything like that ah
[53:52] your Grands are giving you away
[53:54] sister but you see whether it's it's a
[53:56] preacher in the pull pit that may spend
[54:00] days in
[54:02] preparation now I could go the easy
[54:05] route as the pastor I could get a
[54:08] thought from the Lord I could get two or
[54:10] three scriptures two three quotes and
[54:14] preach about 25 30 minutes something
[54:17] like that just give you a little
[54:19] something to where that you say well he
[54:21] did have some word he had some you know
[54:23] he had some good things to say and I
[54:26] could say well praise the Lord I give
[54:28] them a little sermonette today and I
[54:31] think they got something that would help
[54:33] them or I could do the way I always do
[54:38] spend days hours sometimes look
[54:42] sometimes at hundreds of scriptures
[54:45] hundreds of
[54:46] quotes and then spend all kinds of hours
[54:49] putting it
[54:52] together and then whenever I bring it a
[54:54] lot of times people do whatever they
[54:56] want to do
[54:57] anyway so if I preach on don't do this
[55:00] don't do that don't do that don't do
[55:01] that don't do that don't do that don't
[55:03] do that don't do that don't do that you
[55:05] know what a lot of people do they do
[55:06] this they do this they do this they do
[55:08] this they do this this this this and
[55:10] this that I said don't do it it's going
[55:12] to get you in trouble
[55:15] yeah and then I think you know what I
[55:18] wonder if I'm wasting my
[55:21] time I know I'm not I know I'm not just
[55:25] like you mother
[55:26] are not wasting your time when you try
[55:29] to teach your daughters the value of
[55:33] morality you try to teach your sons the
[55:36] value of morality just something as
[55:38] simple as honey make your bed before you
[55:41] go to school make your bed pick up your
[55:44] clothes pick up your shoes you know do
[55:47] this do that help Mama out help Daddy
[55:49] out and say oh well Mama you're you're
[55:52] you're home all day that's only part of
[55:54] the issue if you're allow to do that at
[55:57] home then when you get married guess
[55:59] what you're going to do same thing
[56:00] whenever you get
[56:02] married and people it's easier we all
[56:05] know it's easier just to go the easier
[56:08] way in the day we're living so that's
[56:10] what a lot of people are doing preachers
[56:13] are doing it deacons can do it everybody
[56:17] according to their Ministry mothers can
[56:19] do it if you cross your children I'm
[56:21] going to tell you if you cross your
[56:24] children and tell them you can't go here
[56:26] you can't do this you can't do that and
[56:29] you know what makes it so hard is
[56:31] because they go to church with kids and
[56:34] their parents let them get by with
[56:37] everything but
[56:39] murder and then you're telling your kids
[56:41] we don't do that in our home but Mama
[56:45] they go to the same church we do they go
[56:47] the brother Donnie is their Pastor too
[56:50] and then they can do this and do that
[56:52] and get by with it but you see God will
[56:54] never make you and answer for someone
[56:57] else the way they rais their kids he's
[56:59] going to make you answer for the way you
[57:01] raise
[57:02] yours and it's the same with a pastor a
[57:05] pastor could go the easier way and it
[57:08] tends to follow true to form that the
[57:10] older that preachers get they tend to
[57:13] get softer they tend to get to where
[57:17] that you know they enter into what many
[57:19] of them identifi as years and gray hair
[57:23] and false teeth and all that sort of
[57:25] thing with wisdom and they think well
[57:27] you know you don't have to preach it
[57:28] near as hard as you used to and the next
[57:31] thing you know you look around and the
[57:32] church looks totally different they
[57:35] dress in in ways they used to didn't
[57:37] dress when that same preacher was 25
[57:39] years younger well come on somebody I
[57:42] don't call that wisdom I call it
[57:46] compromise it's easier oh yeah it's
[57:49] easier because as you get older you get
[57:51] weary with all the battles now no don't
[57:54] don't think here today that I'm ready to
[57:57] resign are you kidding me I wouldn't
[58:00] give hell the relief to do that but I
[58:02] want you to
[58:08] see that I know how you feel about your
[58:12] ministry and believe it or not if you
[58:16] would go by the way you feel then you'd
[58:18] get a good idea of the way I feel about
[58:21] mine and the Lord Jesus went that way so
[58:25] he would be able to know how we all feel
[58:28] and he allowed the prophet to have those
[58:30] discouraging times and heartbreaking
[58:33] times can you imagine Paul uh preaching
[58:36] to the church that he himself
[58:37] established in Corinth and I mean they
[58:41] were a church that they had Supernatural
[58:43] gifts it was unbelievable they was one
[58:46] of the most gifted churches in the New
[58:49] Testament but that church had major
[58:52] problems I mean they had adultery they
[58:55] had one man living with his stepmother
[58:59] while still coming to church still
[59:01] shouting jumping jerking speaking in
[59:03] tongues and whatever and the people
[59:06] around him nobody wasn't rebuking it
[59:08] nobody wouldn't saying nothing about it
[59:11] they just had all kinds of issues how
[59:14] discouraging it must have been for that
[59:17] man that spent so much time now remember
[59:20] what God said about the city of Corinth
[59:23] God told him I have much
[59:26] people in this city but I wonder how
[59:30] that he must have laid awake at night
[59:32] and been so disheartened and so
[59:34] discouraged thinking I am wasting my
[59:37] time on these people now it wasn't
[59:40] everybody that could deal with that you
[59:43] know I I know you know it before but
[59:45] Paul said that we stretch not ourselves
[59:48] beyond our measure I'd like to bring it
[59:50] to you sometime if the Lord would let me
[59:52] that Paul said that he wouldn't even go
[59:54] into areas where the the name of Christ
[59:57] had been spoken lest he would build on
[1:00:01] another man's
[1:00:03] Foundation did you ever wonder why Paul
[1:00:05] did not write a letter to the church at
[1:00:09] Jerusalem did you ever wonder why Paul
[1:00:12] never wrote a letter to the church at
[1:00:14] Babylon which was the church that Peter
[1:00:18] founded now the original mother church
[1:00:21] was Jerusalem there are no letters
[1:00:24] written from Paul to the church at
[1:00:27] Jerusalem why it was not under the scope
[1:00:31] as it were of his ministry and he said I
[1:00:33] don't want to build on another man's
[1:00:36] Foundation which was whose Foundation
[1:00:38] Peter and the original 12 so where were
[1:00:42] Paul's letters written to the churches
[1:00:46] that God had him to found you understand
[1:00:49] that some men would not have any
[1:00:50] Ministry or have no one to preach to if
[1:00:54] they did not build it on another man's
[1:00:58] Foundation now it's the same in your
[1:01:02] ministry you see you might get input
[1:01:04] from your mother on How to be the right
[1:01:07] kind of mother you Brothers might get
[1:01:10] input from your father or from brothers
[1:01:13] that you have confidence in on how to re
[1:01:15] be the right kind of father right kind
[1:01:17] of leader in your home and you can take
[1:01:20] from that but it's inevitable that you
[1:01:23] will have to have in your home as the
[1:01:25] head of the home you wives as as being
[1:01:28] the mother and the wife and being the
[1:01:30] queen of the home that you will have to
[1:01:32] find your jurisdiction and you can't say
[1:01:35] well Mama did it this way well sister
[1:01:37] Judy did it that way well you know what
[1:01:40] sister di done it this way and Sister
[1:01:42] Janet did it that way that might work
[1:01:44] with sister Janet's kids but it don't
[1:01:47] mean that it'll work with yours so you
[1:01:50] have to find and not build upon
[1:01:53] another's foundation and say well this
[1:01:55] is the way we do here that's the way
[1:01:56] they done it and I'm going to do exactly
[1:01:58] the way they do you know it's a shame
[1:02:00] really that Satan has taken the form of
[1:02:03] this message and tried to make everybody
[1:02:05] exactly the same way well I've traveled
[1:02:07] this world I've been all over Africa
[1:02:10] different parts of India different parts
[1:02:12] of Canada different parts of the world
[1:02:15] and it's amazing when you go among the
[1:02:17] Latin uh speaking people how different
[1:02:20] they are say Venezuela and South America
[1:02:24] and then you go just north of there into
[1:02:26] Mexico still Spanish-speaking people and
[1:02:29] yet so different in the way their music
[1:02:32] is and the way their singing is but you
[1:02:34] know what a lot of folks in the message
[1:02:36] want to do they want everybody to be
[1:02:38] exactly the same way God is a god of
[1:02:42] variety so they want every Church they
[1:02:45] expect every Church to be exactly
[1:02:47] identical you're wanting a denomination
[1:02:50] is what you're want God doesn't want us
[1:02:52] everyone to be exactly in the same way
[1:02:55] our word worship is going to be a little
[1:02:57] bit different maybe than brother Ron
[1:02:58] Spencer our worship is totally different
[1:03:02] than brother Fred Mullins I can tell you
[1:03:04] that right now they going to be visiting
[1:03:06] with us before long and we fixing to see
[1:03:09] how black folks worship I'm telling
[1:03:14] you but now I realize I'm not here to
[1:03:18] turn you all into a black church because
[1:03:21] as you know I'm not a black preacher I'm
[1:03:24] black from within but somehow my skin
[1:03:26] turned white when I was born but it it
[1:03:29] would be impersonation for us to try to
[1:03:33] make ourselves act like somebody else so
[1:03:36] what we want to find is what is our
[1:03:39] foundation of our home our foundation of
[1:03:43] our church and it's amazing because
[1:03:45] being amongst the brothers around the
[1:03:47] world and how that God will deal with
[1:03:50] them and they'll have problems in
[1:03:52] Zimbabwe we don't have here they'll have
[1:03:54] issues and you pburg South Africa and
[1:03:57] ptor and some of the different places
[1:03:59] there Mumbai and India and the different
[1:04:02] places around the world we'll never deal
[1:04:04] with the Saints in New Zealand the
[1:04:06] Saints in Australia Papa New Guinea and
[1:04:08] the different places there they will
[1:04:10] deal with problems we will never deal
[1:04:13] with so we have to find what God wants
[1:04:16] us to be same in your ministry now
[1:04:19] people can think well you know I'm I'm a
[1:04:21] housewife that has nothing to do with me
[1:04:24] pleasing God that has everything to do
[1:04:28] with you pleasing God as a matter of
[1:04:30] fact I just read it this morning where
[1:04:32] brother Brandon was talking to the men
[1:04:34] following the message and he said you
[1:04:36] men you're supposed to be the head of
[1:04:38] the home and he said you're supposed to
[1:04:40] be set your wife and your children and
[1:04:42] so on in order and he went as far as to
[1:04:46] say that that is your ministry before
[1:04:50] Christ Jesus you know sometimes I found
[1:04:54] it with preachers that they serve God
[1:04:56] and they give to God and they let their
[1:04:58] families go to pot Moses was a perfect
[1:05:01] example of a man that can be so
[1:05:04] concerned about the people and not even
[1:05:07] circumcise his own
[1:05:09] son praise the Lord and we have people
[1:05:12] that want to do missionary work and they
[1:05:14] want to knock on the neighbor door and
[1:05:15] they want to get on Facebook and preach
[1:05:18] and you know Facebook is even women's
[1:05:20] platform for a pull pit and they want to
[1:05:22] get on Facebook and they want to get on
[1:05:24] social media try to correct people over
[1:05:27] this you'll be better off a lot of times
[1:05:28] to be down on your bending knees in
[1:05:31] prayer you're not going to straighten
[1:05:32] out a bunch of these Knuckleheads out
[1:05:34] here in the world you're casting your
[1:05:36] Pearls Before Swine why would you want
[1:05:39] to do it they're going to render them
[1:05:41] and then they're going to turn and on
[1:05:43] you come on somebody but what we want to
[1:05:46] do is find the scope of my Ministry I'm
[1:05:48] not sure you'll understand this but I'm
[1:05:49] going to share it with you anyway even
[1:05:51] though I'm a pastor whenever I go out
[1:05:54] and I will still preach and I may preach
[1:05:57] some of the same things that I preach to
[1:05:59] you but yet when I go out and say preach
[1:06:02] a convention Lord willing brother Andrew
[1:06:03] Glover and I will be preaching the camp
[1:06:05] over in South Carolina North Carolina it
[1:06:08] is now but from Brother Jason Watkins
[1:06:10] church and whenever I go there I was
[1:06:12] down to Brother David cider a while back
[1:06:14] but whenever I visit other men I cannot
[1:06:17] preach as a pastor now that may seem odd
[1:06:20] to you I may take some of the same
[1:06:23] thoughts and some of the same stuff but
[1:06:25] I am a visiting Minister I am a pastor
[1:06:29] but I am a visiting Minister the word is
[1:06:32] always corrective we know that right an
[1:06:35] evangelist is going to preach correction
[1:06:37] but an evangelist has a limitation on
[1:06:40] how far he can go now what you find in
[1:06:42] with a lot of message churches is a lot
[1:06:45] of them that believe in Preachers they
[1:06:46] have no problem with evangelists they
[1:06:48] have no problem with missionaries they
[1:06:50] have no problem with a prophet they have
[1:06:52] no problem even with those going out and
[1:06:54] starting churches but they problem
[1:06:55] problem is with a pastor and that's why
[1:06:57] a lot of them they go from Pastor to
[1:06:59] Pastor to pastor and their preference is
[1:07:02] actually getting one evangelist after
[1:07:04] another to come preach to him you know
[1:07:06] why because an evangelist will never
[1:07:08] really get down to where the problems
[1:07:11] are laying in the administration of the
[1:07:13] church so they get another evangelist
[1:07:15] another another another basically an
[1:07:18] evangelist is taking them to the ER and
[1:07:20] putting them on steroids and giving them
[1:07:22] a shot of faith and telling them about
[1:07:24] this and that and the other but the the
[1:07:26] evangelists have to come right back
[1:07:27] again another evangelist have to come
[1:07:29] back again another had to come back
[1:07:31] again and the real problem is the
[1:07:34] lacking of a true head which is called a
[1:07:37] pastor and the Word of Life
[1:07:39] said now you see God knows exactly how
[1:07:42] to place each one of us so all of us
[1:07:45] that comes to the Lord Jesus has a
[1:07:47] Ministry notice the prophet said each
[1:07:49] one of us has a different Ministry each
[1:07:51] one works different each one has a
[1:07:53] Ministry a separate Ministry all that
[1:07:57] comes to Christ has a Ministry now think
[1:08:01] this is not just preachers every young
[1:08:04] man all you young brothers sitting right
[1:08:06] here all you Sisters You Youth every one
[1:08:09] of you have some sort of ministry and
[1:08:12] it's not my place to tell you what it is
[1:08:16] it's not even your mama's place or your
[1:08:19] daddy's place you were brought on the
[1:08:22] Earth by almighty God and you need to go
[1:08:25] to him you see one of the worst things
[1:08:28] we can do for those of you that are not
[1:08:31] preachers is to feel like well brother
[1:08:33] Donnie can't go here and there and you
[1:08:36] know he he he said before he'd rather
[1:08:38] have a little church but of course God
[1:08:40] won't let him leave our church because
[1:08:42] he he's a minister well what's the
[1:08:44] difference if I want to go to a small
[1:08:46] church and God won't let me yet God made
[1:08:50] you a part of a big church and you
[1:08:52] choose to go to a little one so God
[1:08:54] deals with you different than does
[1:08:57] me God whoops the fire out of me and
[1:08:59] makes me stay with a big church big
[1:09:01] church big problem big church large
[1:09:04] problems you know and God makes me deal
[1:09:06] with it my whole Ministry and then let
[1:09:08] you get by with it no I'm sorry it's not
[1:09:11] you know what the problem is people
[1:09:13] don't look at their ministry as the same
[1:09:16] way that God looks at it so if they
[1:09:18] failed as a housewife no big deal I'm
[1:09:21] still a Christian I'm full of the Holy
[1:09:23] Ghost but what if God Incorporated ated
[1:09:25] that walk with God to be a part of your
[1:09:28] administration of being a housewife or
[1:09:30] being a father as well as a husband a
[1:09:34] farmer amen all that comes into Christ
[1:09:37] has a ministry that's right not only the
[1:09:40] preacher but you have a Ministry and the
[1:09:45] church said something you can do I hope
[1:09:48] this don't sound sacr religious but
[1:09:50] usually God has to drive you into your
[1:09:54] correct Ministry so every individual has
[1:09:57] a Ministry there's a part about
[1:10:00] motherhood that you mothers know is
[1:10:02] absolutely awesome and there's Parts
[1:10:05] about that that can be so
[1:10:08] difficult I have to be very honest with
[1:10:11] you this morning I was never very good
[1:10:15] in the diaper
[1:10:19] Department the lord gave me a missionary
[1:10:22] heart but I didn't get a missionary
[1:10:24] stomach to go with it so odors and
[1:10:28] different things like that woo this old
[1:10:30] boy gets sick on a horse in a minute I'm
[1:10:33] talking about so with our girls there
[1:10:35] was things that I just couldn't do I
[1:10:38] just simply no matter how hard I tried I
[1:10:41] just couldn't do it but I'm so glad that
[1:10:45] my little Godly wife it was part of her
[1:10:48] Ministry oh she said it more than once
[1:10:51] Donnie get out of the way
[1:10:57] just let me do it just let me do it well
[1:11:00] you know whenever we look at it each of
[1:11:03] us have a scope of our call now so the
[1:11:08] prophet said usually God has to drive
[1:11:11] you into your correct Ministry so maybe
[1:11:15] some of you sisters you're you're
[1:11:16] unmarried and oh you go to these youth
[1:11:19] camps and you find young men that'll
[1:11:21] visit our church from other meetings or
[1:11:24] youth servic that we have and you know
[1:11:26] you want them to come spiritually for
[1:11:28] something from the Lord but you're also
[1:11:31] looking for a
[1:11:35] boyfriend come on I once was
[1:11:38] young same with you young brothers and
[1:11:42] then there's there's things about
[1:11:44] boyfriends and girlfriends and even when
[1:11:46] you find the right one things about
[1:11:48] marriage it's just absolutely wonderful
[1:11:52] but there's things about it that's just
[1:11:54] uh
[1:11:57] difficult hard and people say well it's
[1:12:01] 5050 not
[1:12:03] always sometimes it's 90
[1:12:05] 10 and you're the one giving the 90 and
[1:12:08] get 10
[1:12:12] back uh oh the the microphone did it
[1:12:15] stop working oh it is working
[1:12:18] okay but what if God called you
[1:12:21] brothers and part of your ministry is
[1:12:24] not just witnessing and going out and
[1:12:26] going out and helping but it's to be the
[1:12:29] right kind of father in your
[1:12:31] home you see many of our message kids
[1:12:36] now will be molded by the
[1:12:39] parents for those who lived under the
[1:12:42] dispensation of the 77 concept that the
[1:12:46] Rapture was going to come there are some
[1:12:48] in our church that have paid and are
[1:12:50] still paying to this day
[1:12:53] financially because they were taught
[1:12:56] under previous Ministries the Lord's
[1:12:58] going to come at 77 so they never made
[1:13:01] no preparation they never got no degree
[1:13:05] or no real whatever to be able to
[1:13:07] provide for their
[1:13:09] family praise the Lord and then what
[1:13:12] does that hand down to their kids so you
[1:13:15] take a preacher that's off the word from
[1:13:17] the pull pit and he will preach a
[1:13:21] lopsided version of the message and and
[1:13:25] then the parents will hand it down to
[1:13:27] their kids and it can affect one
[1:13:30] generation after another after
[1:13:34] another I personally don't want that for
[1:13:37] you now I don't have no clue no idea how
[1:13:40] long I live I don't have no idea how
[1:13:42] long it's going to be before the Lord
[1:13:44] comes but I want to arm you and equip
[1:13:48] you with the very best that I can so if
[1:13:52] in a few years the Lord takes me off the
[1:13:55] scene or in a month and if the Lord
[1:13:57] takes me off the scene and you have to
[1:13:58] get somebody else that somebody will be
[1:14:00] able to step in there and be able to
[1:14:02] build hopefully I've laid a foundation
[1:14:05] through the years of something that
[1:14:07] another man can come sure he'll have his
[1:14:09] own makeup and his own ideas about this
[1:14:12] and that and the other but where he'll
[1:14:13] not have to go in there and tear all of
[1:14:15] this out and rip all of that out and
[1:14:18] have to totally start over again but
[1:14:21] just be able to build right on that same
[1:14:23] foundation and lay more blocks and more
[1:14:26] building blocks and more building blocks
[1:14:29] of the word to be able to prepare a
[1:14:32] people for the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:14:35] ain't that what we want well you see you
[1:14:38] men that's what you need to do to your
[1:14:40] children we need to live as if though
[1:14:43] the Lord Jesus could come today and as
[1:14:46] if though your life could end today but
[1:14:49] also planning as if though there might
[1:14:52] be another generation I honestly don't
[1:14:54] see how they could be but I did not
[1:14:56] believe would ever be here in 2024
[1:14:59] whenever we come to the message in
[1:15:02] 1983 I felt like and I even preached it
[1:15:05] years ago to that little church in
[1:15:07] Kentucky that we were probably some of
[1:15:10] the last ones cuz that Prophet had been
[1:15:13] gone and not since 1965 didn't I har you
[1:15:15] probably remember you and K are there
[1:15:17] brother Larry brother ter and sister Dre
[1:15:20] brother hard and sister were there and I
[1:15:22] I felt the urgency I thought my we must
[1:15:25] be the last ones but I'm so glad God let
[1:15:28] us come in under that urgency instead of
[1:15:32] just kind of setting back well who knows
[1:15:35] who knows how long it'll be I wonder how
[1:15:38] Donnie Reagan would have been different
[1:15:40] if the Lord would have let me see that
[1:15:43] time would go on to 2024 or 2028 or 2030
[1:15:48] whatever it is and I thought well praise
[1:15:50] the lord we got plenty of time man there
[1:15:53] ain't no need and just going in Hook
[1:15:55] Line and Sinker I doubt very seriously I
[1:15:59] would have went to the Monella Banking
[1:16:01] Company and borrowed
[1:16:05] $1,500 and went to Jeffersonville and
[1:16:08] bought tapes and books and pictures and
[1:16:12] C books and everything that I could buy
[1:16:16] to be able to put in our church I doubt
[1:16:19] very seriously I would have done that
[1:16:21] because I would have thought well we got
[1:16:23] plenty of time my 2024 2028 we'll just
[1:16:28] kind of ease into this thing we'll just
[1:16:31] ease into it so I preach in March the
[1:16:34] 27th 1983 that God sent a prophet May at
[1:16:39] the end of May in 1983 I preached the
[1:16:42] coming of the son of man so from the end
[1:16:46] of March till May I had listen to tapes
[1:16:50] day in day out night in Night Out sang
[1:16:53] up listening to tape studying reading
[1:16:56] praying and it's like God picked me up
[1:16:59] and throwed me right in the middle of
[1:17:00] the furnace and said get lit or get out
[1:17:04] I'm so glad that I did not approach it
[1:17:07] in the nonchalant laidback white don't
[1:17:10] you understand that's what a lot of
[1:17:12] folks around the message are doing with
[1:17:14] their own Ministry you're approaching it
[1:17:17] like you've got plenty of time where do
[1:17:20] you get that idea where do you get you
[1:17:23] have got another hour to live where do
[1:17:27] you get oh some of you men you brothers
[1:17:29] and sisters you're up in your 60s and
[1:17:31] 70s and maybe 80s now you saying well
[1:17:34] it's a time just to kind of quit you
[1:17:36] know and just lay back and relax there's
[1:17:39] never a time to quit until death comes
[1:17:42] and grabs a hold of us and Carries us
[1:17:45] across to the other
[1:17:47] side how I appreciate I've said it
[1:17:49] before I'm going to say it again how I
[1:17:51] appreciate some of these Elder brothers
[1:17:53] and sisters that are among I don't want
[1:17:55] to just wait till they pass away let me
[1:17:57] let me give them a rose right now don't
[1:18:00] you appreciate some of these Elders that
[1:18:01] have been around for years and years and
[1:18:04] years still coming to the house of God
[1:18:08] still being an influence still being an
[1:18:11] encouragement to you and I I I realize
[1:18:14] if the Lord terries a few more years
[1:18:17] myself and brother Daryl and some of the
[1:18:19] other ministers will be the elders in
[1:18:22] the ministry I think oh Lord have mercy
[1:18:25] I I mean I'm contacted by Young
[1:18:27] preachers from all over the world asking
[1:18:29] about this and that and the other and
[1:18:30] it's just hit me in the last couple of
[1:18:32] years Donnie do you realize why they're
[1:18:34] doing that you're an old man dude you're
[1:18:37] an old man I mean you better preach

[1:22:34] us has a
[1:22:37] Ministry a Ministry and the peculiarity
[1:22:40] of it and so forth it is all together to
[1:22:44] glorify
[1:22:46] who
[1:22:47] God all working together for good now
[1:22:50] the Lord be with us and help us watch
[1:22:53] out Paul writing to this troubled Church
[1:22:57] in Corinth 1 Corinthians 12124 as the
[1:23:00] body is one and has many members and all
[1:23:04] watch all the members of
[1:23:09] that one body being many are one body so
[1:23:15] also is Christ people focus on the
[1:23:19] church and they say well all this that
[1:23:21] brother Donnie's doing don't you never
[1:23:24] believe
[1:23:25] that what in the world could I do
[1:23:29] without people sir what could I do
[1:23:32] without helps what can I do without
[1:23:35] other minister brothers that are here
[1:23:37] deacons trustees Sunday school teacher
[1:23:40] our church don't function just by
[1:23:44] [Music]
[1:23:47] me don't make no Idol out of any
[1:23:52] preacher for the body is not one member
[1:23:55] but many if the foot shall say because I
[1:23:59] am not the hand I am not of the body is
[1:24:01] it therefore not of the body if the ear
[1:24:05] shall say because I am not the eye I am
[1:24:09] not of the body is it therefore not of
[1:24:11] the
[1:24:12] body if the whole body were an eye where
[1:24:15] were the
[1:24:16] hearing if the whole body whole were
[1:24:19] hearing were were the
[1:24:21] smelling Now watch how he takes the
[1:24:24] natural anatomy of the human body and
[1:24:27] then Taps into the spiritual body of
[1:24:30] Christ so we got prayer
[1:24:32] warriors we've got people that fast
[1:24:35] we've got people that have the desire on
[1:24:37] their heart to reach out to others and
[1:24:40] they they see this brother and sister
[1:24:42] not coming to church you know they miss
[1:24:44] a service and then they miss another
[1:24:46] service and they they miss another
[1:24:48] service that's not just the Deacon's
[1:24:50] responsibility and the pastor's
[1:24:52] responsibility you know you brothers and
[1:24:55] sisters you should be mindful brother
[1:24:57] have been missing your church where are
[1:24:59] you you understand that's one of the
[1:25:00] downsides of a larger church that people
[1:25:03] can miss church for several services and
[1:25:06] people don't even know if they're there
[1:25:08] or not there don't you understand you
[1:25:10] need to look around and see who sets by
[1:25:13] you see who sits near you and realize
[1:25:16] you it's not just me it's not just the
[1:25:20] deacons and the
[1:25:21] preachers it's us loving one another
[1:25:24] another caring for one
[1:25:27] another oh I know you think this ain't
[1:25:30] very deep this morning but I'm preaching
[1:25:32] to you a message that the bride will be
[1:25:35] into this state before the Rapture takes
[1:25:39] place that we love one another so much
[1:25:42] brother R said at his
[1:25:44] church that preachers would ask him how
[1:25:47] do you get them people in such love with
[1:25:49] each
[1:25:50] other and he said they would go to
[1:25:53] church on Sunday night and close out the
[1:25:55] Sunday night service and they'd stand
[1:25:58] around and weep and hold one another and
[1:26:01] say I can't wait to see you again on
[1:26:03] Wednesday they just CED cuz they loved
[1:26:07] one another so much and he different
[1:26:09] preachers he said but asking how do you
[1:26:11] do that he said just preach the Bible
[1:26:14] just preach the
[1:26:15] truth well what's amazing is he's
[1:26:19] telling the church the same brhom
[1:26:20] Tabernacle several years after that and
[1:26:23] letting them know they needed to move up
[1:26:25] to that now they moved up to deeper
[1:26:28] teachings but them teachings had all
[1:26:30] kinds of differences among them so you
[1:26:34] know what they done spent more time
[1:26:35] arguing fussing for those of you who
[1:26:38] think the brandham Tabernacle was a
[1:26:40] perfect Church you're
[1:26:43] ignorant I have per personal friends
[1:26:47] that were deacons and so on at that
[1:26:49] place they had to deal with all types of
[1:26:52] issues and you say my goodness why in
[1:26:55] the world would that be because the
[1:26:57] devil wants to come right there the
[1:26:59] devil didn't where did the devil show up
[1:27:01] and in the Book of Genesis he didn't
[1:27:03] show up in Hades he showed up in the
[1:27:06] Garden of Eden come on somebody so we
[1:27:09] know that's exactly what he wants to do
[1:27:12] in your home he wants to destroy the
[1:27:15] love between a husband and wife he wants
[1:27:17] to destroy the love between a mother and
[1:27:20] her children a father and a family unit
[1:27:23] and our church church is no stronger
[1:27:25] than the families who make it up if we
[1:27:28] want a closer church if we want a more
[1:27:31] Godly Church a more holy church we need
[1:27:34] families that are closer together and we
[1:27:36] say Lord God help us that we'll never
[1:27:39] let anything come between us that will
[1:27:42] divide us we will forgive one another we
[1:27:45] will tolerate one another's faults come
[1:27:47] on somebody oh yes there's something
[1:27:51] about that as the ministry of the body
[1:27:54] we're going to church with people that
[1:27:56] aren't perfect I'm talking to a brother
[1:27:58] this week and he's talking about people
[1:28:00] looking for a perfect church I said why
[1:28:02] in this world would anybody look for a
[1:28:06] perfect Church there is no such a thing
[1:28:09] and if you ever found one and you went
[1:28:11] there you'd ruin the whole program but
[1:28:14] you've got preachers that are faulty
[1:28:16] you've got people that are faulty church
[1:28:19] is like a hospital it's like going to a
[1:28:22] doctor's office do you go to to the
[1:28:24] doctor's office and everybody there is
[1:28:26] well everybody there is doing good
[1:28:29] they're coughing they're hiking they're
[1:28:31] spitting they've got everything in the
[1:28:33] world wrong with them why that's where
[1:28:35] sick people go well the church is the
[1:28:39] same way we've got people with problems
[1:28:42] we got people with issues oh brother
[1:28:45] Donnie I'm going to wait till I get
[1:28:47] right then I'll come no come on come on
[1:28:52] come on and get right here this is a
[1:28:55] good place to get right with
[1:29:04] God someone had mentioned to Carol some
[1:29:07] time back said someone said well they
[1:29:10] they wanted to come to church but they
[1:29:11] had a certain habit that they was
[1:29:13] dealing with and they just didn't figure
[1:29:15] out I told car I said you text them back
[1:29:17] right now and tell them I said come to
[1:29:21] church cuz it's one of the best places I
[1:29:24] Oh Glory to God I know uh to get
[1:29:26] delivered of a habit don't stay at home
[1:29:29] that's exactly what the devil wants you
[1:29:31] to do well I'm going to stay home and
[1:29:33] when I get good enough I'll come to
[1:29:35] church you'll never come to church
[1:29:38] because you ain't never going to be good
[1:29:40] enough I ain't good enough you ain't
[1:29:42] good enough you ain't good enough
[1:29:44] there's not a one of us that are good
[1:29:46] enough but we come to the house of God
[1:29:49] that God can reshape Our Lives
[1:30:00] oh my notice this in the great warrior
[1:30:02] David the scripture said those who he
[1:30:05] has called is Justified those who he has
[1:30:08] Justified he glorified Amen in the
[1:30:10] presence of almighty
[1:30:12] God get ready
[1:30:14] devil your name's
[1:30:17] indelibly wrote with the blood of Jesus
[1:30:22] Christ Glory ified in his presence
[1:30:26] positionally placed here on Earth for a
[1:30:30] purpose to do the will of God you see
[1:30:34] your position Christian you say can that
[1:30:38] well brother Bram I wasn't called to be
[1:30:40] a
[1:30:41] preacher you might not oh you might be
[1:30:44] called to be a housewife you mean being
[1:30:46] a housewife is a
[1:30:50] calling it's proof every every woman
[1:30:55] that gives birth to a child is not
[1:30:58] really the right kind of
[1:31:00] mother it's evident every man that can
[1:31:04] sire a child does not necessarily make
[1:31:08] him a good father it just makes him a
[1:31:11] progator that he can be able to
[1:31:12] reproduce himself don't you understand
[1:31:15] being a real mother is a
[1:31:19] calling being a real father is a calling
[1:31:24] being a real Godly church member in this
[1:31:29] assembly is a
[1:31:31] calling now membership of course the
[1:31:34] church has substituted membership well
[1:31:36] come on now we'll do everything we can
[1:31:38] to fill the place let's bring them all
[1:31:41] in let's have hot dog suppers and
[1:31:43] hamburger suppers and let's bring the
[1:31:45] grill well we may not do it on a grill
[1:31:47] but we got hide smoking around here just
[1:31:49] about every service anyhow so if you're
[1:31:52] looking for hide smoking this is the
[1:31:54] right place I don't know so much about
[1:31:55] hot dogs and hamburgers but we want to
[1:31:57] be right with God don't we Saints and we
[1:32:00] want to have a place that the Holy Ghost
[1:32:03] can move heal the sick cast out Devils
[1:32:06] deliver those that are
[1:32:08] bound and help the Saints find their
[1:32:12] Ministry watch's this you might be
[1:32:16] called to be a housewife but you got
[1:32:19] your position in Christ Jesus
[1:32:24] by the Holy
[1:32:26] Ghost to be a
[1:32:30] housewife so you mean that is a
[1:32:33] spiritual
[1:32:36] position it's worth more than you will
[1:32:39] ever know I
[1:32:40] figure now listen you're just as
[1:32:45] much as David and the rest of

[1:33:45] sisters I know many of you you don't
[1:33:46] dress this way and do this way because

[1:33:51] because the Lord Jesus wants you to and

[1:34:07] scriptures together that's a good thing
[1:34:09] about the Lord he's able to put them
[1:34:11] together in our soul when we can't put
[1:34:13] them together in our head but we're
[1:34:15] taking that word every one of those
[1:34:18] quotes every one of those scriptures
[1:34:20] that you put in your life you are the
[1:34:23] one sming living breathing word written
[1:34:28] Epistles known and read of all
[1:34:33] men
[1:34:34] [Music]
[1:34:37] oh listen this
[1:34:40] adoption the church
[1:34:43] positionally before the foundation of
[1:34:45] the
[1:34:46] world when God in his labor
[1:34:51] pain was bringing
[1:34:55] forth bringing
[1:34:57] forth
[1:35:00] you so before the foundation of the
[1:35:07] [Music]
[1:35:10] world I
[1:35:12] want
[1:35:14] [Applause]
[1:35:20] Housewives I've always loved the order
[1:35:22] of this
[1:35:24] I started studying this probably in '
[1:35:27] 84 in adoption after I come into some of
[1:35:29] the first initial
[1:35:31] messages notice this he positionally
[1:35:33] placed you into his own
[1:35:36] body to be a
[1:35:42] housewife why in the world would God's
[1:35:45] Prophet put a
[1:35:48] housewife in front of the position of a
[1:35:50] prophet
[1:35:55] now we would think of course first of
[1:35:57] all would had to be the
[1:36:03] prophet a
[1:36:05] housewife a
[1:36:07] farmer to be a
[1:36:10] preacher to be a prophet Lord have mercy
[1:36:15] housewife farmer preacher Prophet to be
[1:36:20] this to be that he placed you
[1:36:22] positionally then when you have come
[1:36:24] from the garlic lands of Egypt through
[1:36:27] sanctification and
[1:36:29] baptized into the promised
[1:36:31] land oh it's
[1:36:34] glorious to find your position and no
[1:36:37] one can do
[1:36:39] anything unless you know
[1:36:42] properly what you're
[1:36:46] doing you said but don't why why why is
[1:36:49] that so important we must have faith in
[1:36:52] our position
[1:36:54] you see the climax of the ages will wind
[1:36:58] up in this bride being positionally
[1:37:01] placed what she is when she finds her
[1:37:05] place she will allow him to get in his
[1:37:09] place which is the
[1:37:11] headship and he will call the
[1:37:14] resurrection so as long as they're
[1:37:16] fussing and arguing and fighting and I'm
[1:37:18] the greatest we got the biggest church
[1:37:20] and no we got the biggest church we're
[1:37:21] bigger than you are there's 5,000 100
[1:37:24] people that subscrib to our YouTube
[1:37:25] channel oh my goodness well there's
[1:37:28] 5,13 that subscribe to ours and the oh
[1:37:31] my my as long as we're doing that are we
[1:37:33] not yet carnal as
[1:37:35] men but if we can realize God has men
[1:37:39] and women that'll always maybe as would
[1:37:41] say be above us there'll always be
[1:37:44] people that God will call to do more
[1:37:46] than we are but you know what I don't
[1:37:47] have to answer for any of them I've got
[1:37:50] to answer for what little bitty tiny
[1:37:52] thing that God gives me and I'm going to
[1:37:55] do my best to use it come on with me
[1:37:57] somebody it ought to be the same way
[1:37:59] with you mothers and fathers some of you
[1:38:01] got several kids in your man family
[1:38:03] maybe five six seven whatever it is and
[1:38:05] maybe God just gives some of you one
[1:38:08] well you know what if he gave you that
[1:38:09] one you ought to raise it in the
[1:38:11] admonition and the fear of God and know
[1:38:13] that God give you a small
[1:38:15] church but does that mean that you're
[1:38:18] not supposed to Pastor that little child
[1:38:20] with all your heart I mean do it with
[1:38:22] all your heart call them love them spank
[1:38:24] them when they need it love them when
[1:38:26] they need to cry on your shoulder do
[1:38:28] whatever you need to do that's what I
[1:38:30] have to do I have to break your legs
[1:38:32] sometimes I've got to wear you out and
[1:38:34] then we all cry together right and but
[1:38:36] yet that's what I'm called to do I can't
[1:38:38] answer for brother Tim's Ministry I
[1:38:41] cannot answer for brother Barry coffee's
[1:38:43] Ministry are many of these great
[1:38:45] Servants of God I'm not even worthy to
[1:38:47] pack their briefcase but yet God's give
[1:38:49] me one and I will not I will not let let
[1:38:53] him down I've made so many mistakes and
[1:38:56] I've made so many failures but my
[1:38:59] mistakes does not mean I am a total
[1:39:02] failure what I find I'm wrong I fix it I
[1:39:06] straighten it out come on children oh
[1:39:09] but you say brother Donnie as a
[1:39:10] housewife I messed up as a mother I
[1:39:13] messed up sure you have but don't let
[1:39:16] your mess ups Define who you are you're
[1:39:19] a daughter of God you're called to that
[1:39:21] position
[1:39:23] [Applause]
[1:39:33] I love this sermon perfect
[1:39:35] F now remember they had the word and the
[1:39:38] Word was made flesh then speaking about
[1:39:41] the apostles and the word told them I
[1:39:44] give you
[1:39:45] power amen I give you power and they had
[1:39:48] the
[1:39:50] power but they didn't have faith to
[1:39:52] operate the
[1:39:54] word that was in
[1:39:57] them you said what I mean but Jesus had
[1:40:00] it he was the word and he had faith that
[1:40:03] what he said would happen he said oh
[1:40:06] bring him here how long will I suffer
[1:40:08] you he had
[1:40:11] Faith with his power can you imagine the
[1:40:14] Lord Jesus subjecting himself down to
[1:40:17] our level that he would actually be
[1:40:21] required to have faith
[1:40:25] but he was the son of God he was the
[1:40:27] word but he condescended to such a low
[1:40:30] place like
[1:40:32] humans that he required of
[1:40:35] himself to believe his own
[1:40:40] word he knew that's going to be your
[1:40:42] your one of your greatest trials he
[1:40:45] wanted to go through the
[1:40:47] struggles of

[1:41:46] never had a
[1:41:49] desire but I have one to go away from
[1:41:51] the work

[1:41:57] the word which in reality is him
[1:42:01] expressed in my own
[1:42:03] life you understand what I'm saying but
[1:42:05] it's far as say oh Jesus I'm tired of
[1:42:07] you I I don't want to serve you no more
[1:42:09] no no I've never said that and have no
[1:42:13] desire to say that but I have said what

[1:42:18] preacher I don't understand I Don't
[1:42:21] Preach good I preach loud I'm
[1:42:25] controversial people don't think I'm
[1:42:27] nice they think I'm meing a copper head
[1:42:29] crossed with a rattlesnake and a
[1:42:31] wolverine they think I'm just slap out
[1:42:33] evil lot of folks in the message think I
[1:42:35] blasphemed the Holy Ghost why in the
[1:42:38] world would you want me to preach every
[1:42:40] sermon I ever preach I make mistakes I
[1:42:42] ain't never preached a perfect one in my
[1:42:43] life I preach thousands of them and
[1:42:45] ain't never preach a perfect one you
[1:42:46] tell about
[1:42:48] discouraging to know that you have never
[1:42:50] preached one perfect sermon never and
[1:42:52] never so you already know that before
[1:42:54] you enter into it you ain't never going
[1:42:55] to preach a perfect one them just let me
[1:42:57] know up front and same with you all
[1:42:58] you're going to fail how many times you
[1:43:01] sisters fix eggs God bless your hearts
[1:43:04] poor little young us have to eat them
[1:43:05] sorry things I mean bless your
[1:43:09] hearts and you still sometimes will mess
[1:43:11] it up right and you say what what you
[1:43:13] going to do you're going to quit cooking
[1:43:15] so because after the sermon today and
[1:43:17] I'll relive it tomorrow and the next day
[1:43:19] and the next day and then it'll be time
[1:43:20] again we preach Wednesday you know so
[1:43:22] then I think if if I live under that I'd
[1:43:24] never preach another i' think forget it
[1:43:26] just forget it I make so many mistakes
[1:43:27] and I mess up so bad and some people
[1:43:30] listen some people don't my goodness as
[1:43:31] soon as I say Amen 47 of them go to the
[1:43:33] bathroom all than one
[1:43:35] time they don't even want to hang around
[1:43:37] to worship they didn't want to stand
[1:43:39] around you know just see what the Lord's
[1:43:40] going to do it's like they can't wait
[1:43:42] they're chomping at the bits to get up
[1:43:43] and leave they really don't like hearing
[1:43:45] you preach
[1:43:47] noow so if you listen to all that then
[1:43:50] you say yeah yeah
[1:43:53] I I can see that I can see that you see
[1:43:57] I'm up here looking at all of you all
[1:43:58] you ain't looking at everybody else out
[1:44:00] there see what they're doing so I'm
[1:44:02] sitting
[1:44:08] there
[1:44:10] amen but it was a wrong time to say
[1:44:17] amen and you say boy that was really
[1:44:19] some sermon today wasn't it that was
[1:44:21] really a blessing huh put you to sleep
[1:44:24] well praise God maybe you stayed up all
[1:44:26] night praying for me or
[1:44:28] something maybe the next time go ahead
[1:44:30] and sleep it would do me a whole lot
[1:44:32] more good to see you awake see said
[1:44:34] there
[1:44:35] sleep you say I'm afraid this is where
[1:44:37] we are
[1:44:39] sometimes they had the power but they
[1:44:41] didn't have the faith to operate the
[1:44:43] word that was in them see what I mean
[1:44:44] Jesus had it he was the word so he had
[1:44:47] the word but then in paragraph 64 he had
[1:44:49] Faith with his power how did he said I
[1:44:51] can do nothing myself
[1:44:54] why he
[1:44:57] relied upon what he
[1:45:01] was he relied in knowing that he was the
[1:45:05] word he had faith in God who made him
[1:45:08] the
[1:45:09] word he was God the word and there was
[1:45:13] in him and that give him Fai because
[1:45:18] listen how important this
[1:45:20] is because
[1:45:23] he
[1:45:25] understood his
[1:45:28] position so you mean to tell me the Lord
[1:45:30] Jesus brother Joe could never have
[1:45:33] accomplished all that he
[1:45:36] did if he would have not have
[1:45:39] known who he
[1:45:43] was so it gave him Faith so sisters
[1:45:46] instead of getting up in the morning and
[1:45:48] starting your Monday morning routine
[1:45:49] well I wish I could find the will of God
[1:45:51] for my life I wish I wish I knew what
[1:45:53] the Lord was doing here you are you got
[1:45:55] your oil out you poured it out you skill
[1:45:57] it you got the maple syrup you know
[1:45:58] you're fixing pancakes or eggs or
[1:46:00] sausage what I sure wish I knew what the
[1:46:02] Lord wanted me to do and there's Jimmy
[1:46:04] and Johnny and Jackie and Betty and Lucy
[1:46:06] and Freddy and Billy and whoever more
[1:46:07] sitting around the table I sure wish I
[1:46:09] knew what the Lord wanted me to do feed
[1:46:11] them hungry mouths Mama feed them hungry
[1:46:14] mouths and if you're homeschooling them
[1:46:16] God bless your heart then be able to
[1:46:17] pray over them intill in them not only
[1:46:20] about Abraham Lincoln and George
[1:46:21] Washington but instill in them the power
[1:46:24] of almighty God come on somebody what is
[1:46:28] it doing then you have faith in your
[1:46:30] position then whenever things go wrong
[1:46:33] oh my and it don't work look good and it
[1:46:35] ain't working out really good how many
[1:46:37] knows how it can be that way sometimes
[1:46:39] it seem like the more we do for God and
[1:46:42] the more that the presence of God comes
[1:46:44] in his word the harder the battles get
[1:46:46] the more difficult they get and it's all
[1:46:49] to discourage you it's to get you down
[1:46:52] it's to down on you if it ain't just you
[1:46:54] and your husband it's you and your
[1:46:56] husband and your daughter and her
[1:46:57] husband and then your granddaughters and
[1:46:59] you think well when we get them raised
[1:47:01] our troubles are over no they ain't
[1:47:03] they're like rabbits they just keep
[1:47:04] multiplying and the more you get the
[1:47:06] more oh my the more troubles they bring
[1:47:09] with them and you saying oh my I thought
[1:47:11] when I got them all raised in the empty
[1:47:13] nest forget that thought about the empty
[1:47:16] nest it don't never empty out they just
[1:47:18] move from one place to another amen and
[1:47:21] God don't want to for those who feel
[1:47:25] like it ends when their children are
[1:47:26] grown it's like you are resigning from
[1:47:29] your ministry can you imagine me
[1:47:32] resigning and coming to church and just
[1:47:34] sitting here and not doing nothing Lord
[1:47:36] have mercy you'd hear the office
[1:47:38] explosion ever was on 209 quar Run Court
[1:47:42] what would it be brother Donnie blowed
[1:47:43] up he'd been down there studying the
[1:47:45] word but he resigned I'm at the age I
[1:47:48] could resign but the way I'm looking at
[1:47:50] it there ain't no retirement for a
[1:47:52] preacher they just put them out to
[1:47:55] Pastor yes sir I ain't looking to retire
[1:47:58] I'm looking to relieve this world
[1:48:00] because I'm fixing to move to a
[1:48:03] retirement community and I'm here today
[1:48:06] to invite every one of you to come and
[1:48:10] go with me up to this retirement
[1:48:13] community it is a gated community and
[1:48:17] nobody over 20 is allowed it is a
[1:48:21] community it's going to the greatest use
[1:48:24] rally the world has ever known we will
[1:48:28] never
[1:48:32] die just
[1:48:34] [Applause]
[1:48:38] say that gave him Faith because he
[1:48:42] understood his
[1:48:44] position he knowed what he was because
[1:48:47] the scripture had said he was this and
[1:48:50] every scripture tied in to prove that he
[1:48:52] was exact what the scripture said he
[1:48:54] would be and he knew what he was
[1:48:58] therefore he
[1:49:00] relied upon what
[1:49:03] God had made
[1:49:05] him and if he did that then can't
[1:49:09] we rely upon what God made
[1:49:14] us as
[1:49:17] Believers these signs shall follow them
[1:49:19] that believe he had faith in what he was
[1:49:23] and if you are a
[1:49:26] Believer you have faith in what you
[1:49:30] are you
[1:49:33] are a
[1:49:36] Believer praise
[1:49:40] God
[1:49:42] mamas make a difference in the life of
[1:49:44] your
[1:49:46] kids and when you change dispensations
[1:49:48] and become
[1:49:50] grandmother make a difference in the
[1:49:52] life
[1:49:53] of your
[1:49:55] kids spread your
[1:49:58] light this why the word of God is so
[1:50:01] against the idea of people not going to
[1:50:04] church and staying home and living this
[1:50:06] secluded life nobody knows what you
[1:50:08] believe nobody knows you're a Christian
[1:50:10] nobody knows you're a Believer you never
[1:50:12] sing you never worship you never
[1:50:14] minister to the body you stay home where
[1:50:16] is that in the
[1:50:19] Bible it's not in the Bible nor in the
[1:50:22] message either I'll tell you what it is
[1:50:23] it's a spirit of
[1:50:25] antichrist it's against the original
[1:50:27] teaching of Christ
[1:50:29] Jesus he said no man lights a candle and
[1:50:33] puts it under a
[1:50:34] bushel but he puts it up in the house
[1:50:36] for all those to see right may God take
[1:50:41] our lives and put them on display that's
[1:50:45] right remember sisters and brothers and
[1:50:47] young people leave this place
[1:50:51] today with the the desire in Your Heart
[1:50:53] Lord help
[1:50:54] me help me to know my
[1:50:57] Ministry what you've called me to
[1:51:00] be I'm a sister I know I can't handle
[1:51:02] the word some of you Brothers don't
[1:51:04] never preach the word you don't have
[1:51:06] to you don't have
[1:51:09] to but you can live the word live what
[1:51:13] you're hearing
[1:51:14] preached then you're fulfilling your
[1:51:18] purpose in the economy of God
[1:51:23] you have faith in what you are you are a
[1:51:25] Believer and if you've got faith in God
[1:51:27] the Bible says if our hearts condemn us
[1:51:30] then we can't have faith listen how
[1:51:32] serious this
[1:51:34] is but if our hearts don't condemn us
[1:51:36] then we have faith we have confidence
[1:51:38] towards God if you want to read that St
[1:51:40] John 3:21 got the scripture written down
[1:51:43] here he said oh first John if our hearts
[1:51:45] condemn us not then we have confidence
[1:51:47] toward god listen to this carefully but
[1:51:50] as long as you're doing things that's
[1:51:52] wrong
[1:51:53] wrong you can't have
[1:51:55] confidence toward
[1:51:58] God so you see you automatically know
[1:52:02] that you're wrong now the only thing you
[1:52:05] have to do then is have faith in what
[1:52:08] you
[1:52:09] are it's wonderful to have faith in what
[1:52:12] brother brandham was it's want to have
[1:52:14] faith in your mama it's want to have
[1:52:15] faith in your pastor and you know the
[1:52:17] song leaders and the musicians and our
[1:52:19] youth leaders and that's awesome
[1:52:21] wonderful
[1:52:23] you know why God will heal you when you
[1:52:25] come up for me or these other ministers
[1:52:26] to pray for you cuz you have faith in me
[1:52:29] if you don't I can help you you have
[1:52:32] confidence you've seen God perform
[1:52:34] Miracles and it gives you confidence now
[1:52:37] what if you would have that same
[1:52:39] confidence in your own walk before
[1:52:42] God I am a believer I am a
[1:52:47] Christian but brother Donnie I'm a human
[1:52:49] being so you think I'm not
[1:52:53] but brother Donnie I have mistakes so
[1:52:55] you think I don't
[1:53:00] have you saying brother Daryl is perfect
[1:53:03] faultless there is no such a human
[1:53:08] being so what do you do if I fall flat
[1:53:11] on my face I get up dust myself off hit
[1:53:15] the devil in the Smacker and go right on
[1:53:17] and live right okay I repent
[1:53:23] praise the Lord that's why I tell you to
[1:53:25] do the same thing then I have confidence
[1:53:29] that he's forgiv
[1:53:30] me oh my have faith in what you are have
[1:53:34] faith in what the word says you are
[1:53:37] Jesus had faith in the word of God that
[1:53:39] said what he was it's written of me
[1:53:42] didn't David and the Psalms and the
[1:53:44] prophets speak of
[1:53:46] him to me this is so
[1:53:49] overwhelming that he would subject
[1:53:52] himself self to such a
[1:53:54] place that his
[1:53:56] mechanics had to orchestrate with God's
[1:53:59] Dynamics in order to produce the Divine
[1:54:04] results mentioned to you the other day
[1:54:06] and I'll close with this if we want the
[1:54:09] Dynamics of God we're going to have to
[1:54:11] keep our mechanics in
[1:54:14] order God will not anoint our
[1:54:17] mechanics if it's full of tradition
[1:54:20] ideologies of men opinions of this in
[1:54:22] that God is going to bring the rocket
[1:54:25] power down among the bride for a Rapture
[1:54:29] and he will strike only the right
[1:54:33] mechanics can't you see why God cannot
[1:54:36] strike
[1:54:37] trinitarianism and bring trinitarians to
[1:54:41] a married supper of the lamb and they're
[1:54:42] going to be looking for three and there
[1:54:43] ain't going to be three there it's going
[1:54:45] to be one so the Dynamics power will
[1:54:48] strike the bride and her mechanics
[1:54:52] amen let's bow our heads
[1:54:56] together praise the Lord
[1:55:01] Jesus I
[1:55:03] wonder how many here
[1:55:06] today would say
[1:55:10] God that's what I want with all my heart
[1:55:13] I want to find my place I know many of
[1:55:14] you do CU I get questions from you phone
[1:55:16] calls texts this that and the other
[1:55:18] brother Donnie I'm praying about this
[1:55:19] I'm praying about that I I don't know
[1:55:21] what to do what is if there's something
[1:55:23] in us we want to find the will of God
[1:55:26] even our
[1:55:27] vocation we're supposed to go to that
[1:55:29] school we're supposed to be a teacher or
[1:55:30] are we supposed to be an electrician we
[1:55:32] supposed to be an electrician we
[1:55:33] supposed to be a builder are we supposed
[1:55:35] to you know what are we supposed to do
[1:55:39] oh how it must please the father that we
[1:55:41] have that desire in
[1:55:43] us but don't just look at it as a
[1:55:45] vocation only but as a Ministry don't
[1:55:48] spend years of your life going to school
[1:55:50] young people and then transition in the
[1:55:53] middle of the road and then then take a
[1:55:54] bunch more years and go here and then a
[1:55:56] bunch more years and go there think of
[1:55:58] how much time you've wasted why you
[1:56:00] simply miss the will of
[1:56:02] God how many like to be remembered
[1:56:05] today my hands are up too I want you to
[1:56:09] pray for
[1:56:12] me Lord
[1:56:16] Jesus as a faulty
[1:56:19] preacher I come before you today
[1:56:23] I bring my faulty
[1:56:26] congregation as a preacher who's fallen
[1:56:29] short of the glory of God many times oh
[1:56:32] I don't drink run around commit adultery
[1:56:34] on my wife none of that
[1:56:36] stuff Lord and many times we
[1:56:39] know it's not so much what we
[1:56:42] do but rather it's sins of
[1:56:47] omission things that we know we should
[1:56:49] do that we don't do
[1:56:52] we don't pray like we should we don't
[1:56:54] read the word like we should we don't
[1:56:56] reach out to others like we should we
[1:56:59] don't minister to one another like we
[1:57:01] should those are sins of
[1:57:05] omission we pray you'd forgive us
[1:57:07] father we know we should forgive and not
[1:57:10] hold any Grudge in our heart and I have
[1:57:11] it here laying before me where your
[1:57:13] Prophet
[1:57:14] said that if we hold things in our heart
[1:57:16] against people even though they have
[1:57:19] done us terribly wrong you will not hear
[1:57:22] us when we
[1:57:24] pray dear God I need you to desperately
[1:57:28] Lord your people father they need me in
[1:57:31] the wee hours of the morning when
[1:57:32] they're sick or their babies are sick I
[1:57:35] don't need nothing in my heart that
[1:57:37] would hinder my
[1:57:39] prayers but help these people to realize
[1:57:41] not only does their Pastor not need that
[1:57:44] they don't need it
[1:57:46] either so maybe there's some here today
[1:57:48] that's holding things in their heart and
[1:57:50] it seems like you're not answering their
[1:57:52] prayers that could be the
[1:57:55] answer because they're holding something
[1:57:58] in their heart someone did them terribly
[1:58:00] wrong awful absolutely awful treated
[1:58:02] them bad and maybe they done it over and
[1:58:05] over
[1:58:06] again but yet that son or daughter has
[1:58:10] held that in their heart and it's grow
[1:58:11] into a root of
[1:58:12] bitterness and it seemed like when they
[1:58:15] pray nothing happens and then they've
[1:58:16] got to the place they don't even hardly
[1:58:18] pray
[1:58:19] anymore Lord Jesus you're speaking to
[1:58:21] someone right right
[1:58:23] now dear God may you deal with each of
[1:58:25] our hearts today Father there's anything
[1:58:28] anything in our hearts and our
[1:58:31] lives oh Jesus please help
[1:58:35] us we need you so much
[1:58:39] father help me Lord help me in my
[1:58:44] Ministry
[1:58:46] father oh Jesus I
[1:58:49] I I don't know what I'll have when it's
[1:58:51] safe and
[1:58:53] done cuz you can give years of your life
[1:58:55] to people and then they'll turn and walk
[1:58:57] away from you never even pay you the
[1:58:59] common courtesy to even come and talk to
[1:59:02] you before they leave treat you like a
[1:59:06] dog little do they realize as they treat
[1:59:09] God's men that's the way they're
[1:59:12] treating you I've had preachers to do me
[1:59:15] the same way Lord use you for what they
[1:59:17] can get out of you and then turn and
[1:59:19] walk away hide their intent and hide

[2:07:16] that God will help them and strengthen
[2:07:18] them some of the teachers here in our
[2:07:20] church have talked to me before and
[2:07:22] actually have come up for prayer was
[2:07:24] some of the things that they deal with
[2:07:26] and
[2:07:27] see out of small
[2:07:29] children it is
[2:07:33] unbelievable it is
[2:07:35] unbelievable some of the things that
[2:07:37] some of the school teachers have told me
[2:07:40] that they see in
[2:07:41] school it absolutely breaks my
[2:07:45] heart what kids are dealing with in this
[2:07:49] day can't you see Satan
[2:07:51] is after our youth but we say to the
[2:07:55] devil the way that Moses said to Egypt
[2:07:59] we will not leave one hoof
[2:08:07] behind Lord
[2:08:12] Jesus I knew there was a bunch of them
[2:08:15] but I have to say I didn't
[2:08:17] realize there were so many
[2:08:22] Lord some of them little tenderhearted
[2:08:26] children Lord some of them homeschooling
[2:08:29] some of them going to public
[2:08:30] school some of them maybe starting
[2:08:33] College some of them I know Lord are
[2:08:34] actually teachers
[2:08:37] themselves Lord we pray for each of
[2:08:40] them they're standing here with needs
[2:08:44] lord it's so limited today some of these
[2:08:47] teachers I know cuz they've told me what
[2:08:50] they can say they're not allowed to say
[2:08:52] certain things how difficult that must
[2:08:55] be they know what these kids need and
[2:08:58] yet they're not allowed by our
[2:09:01] educational system to tell
[2:09:04] them dear God help
[2:09:07] us father for these here that are
[2:09:10] teachers May the love of Jesus so come
[2:09:13] out of their
[2:09:15] hearts oh Lord
[2:09:17] God may they be able to experience it
[2:09:20] they may not be able to discuss Theology
[2:09:22] and doctrines with them but may they
[2:09:25] feel the love from the hearts of these
[2:09:28] teachers
[2:09:29] Lord that they can know that there's a
[2:09:31] better
[2:09:32] world Lord I pray for all of our
[2:09:35] children whether they're going into
[2:09:38] kindergarten or first second whatever
[2:09:40] they're going through Lord maybe some
[2:09:42] starting College helped them Lord some
[2:09:46] of them they've been their education has
[2:09:48] been in homeschool and now they're going
[2:09:51] out for the first time into maybe a
[2:09:54] Christian school or a public school to
[2:09:56] finish up their education or taking a a
[2:09:58] course in college they haven't been
[2:10:01] there
[2:10:02] before it'll be a new world they'll be
[2:10:04] exposed to things that they've never had
[2:10:07] before help them
[2:10:10] Jesus Lord God may you strengthen
[2:10:13] them I pray for our sisters especially
[2:10:17] they're going to be questioned about the
[2:10:18] way they look and the way they dress
[2:10:21] May the presence of God be with
[2:10:25] them help them
[2:10:27] Jesus May the young men here at the
[2:10:30] church father may they not participate
[2:10:32] in that which is wrong and
[2:10:34] evil but may the presence of God give
[2:10:36] them that Grace I know what it was like
[2:10:39] when I was a young man going to school
[2:10:41] and laughed at and ridiculed and I can't
[2:10:42] imagine how much harder that it is today
[2:10:46] but your power is just the
[2:10:48] same would you keep them Jesus
[2:10:52] give him Grace I pray
[2:10:55] father you come to this earth and you

[2:11:06] he was created a full grown man but the
[2:11:09] prophet said you became a
[2:11:11] baby and you grew up as a

[2:11:23] teenagers they feel that teenage pull
