[Applause] while you're standing if you have your Bibles you turn to Genesis 3 verse 17 after that we're going to turn to mark 15 verse 22 like top take the opportunity to wish my mother happy birthday today she's not gonna tell you how old she is but I looked that good at 83 I tell you I got to be nice I still get dinners once in a while she's been wonderful justice 3:17 under Adam he said because thou hearken unto the voice of thy wife has to eaten of the tree which I commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake and in sorrow shalt thou eat all the days of my life excuse me I can't wholly read here thorns also and thistles shall bring it forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was doubt taken for dust thou art and dust thou shalt return in reading that what God is actually doing we're gonna look at this kind of a across a court trial that God is actually passing sentence in the garden and Adam called his wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living and unto Adam also and his wife did God make coats of skins and clothed him and if we could turn over to mark 15 verse 22 this is also God passing sins for your sins and they bring him into the police call Gotha which is being interpreted place of his skull they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh but he received it not when they had crucified him they parted is gone what's casting Lots upon him what every man should take and it was the third iron hour and they crucified him let us pray Heavenly Father lord I thank you Lord for what you did for me for the representation Lord that you put out for me to lay my sins upon Lord just my sins on a loan Lord where they laid upon him your father would have seen too much but here Lord used your prophet said you made a propitiation for our sins Lord and you murdered your own son to take my place Lord as we look at this tonight father Lord you put a thought on our heart Lord you give us quotes and scriptures Lord we could study for hours on the end Lord Lord but if you don't come and hand it to the bride Lord Lord it be for nothing so the Lord I pray that you would help me tonight to get out of the way Lord Lord I get nervous and everything seems to come out wrong Lord but lord I pray that you would put me aside Lord but not only me Lord I prayed you put these people aside father Lord if they expect anything out of the flesh father they're going to leave so disappointed and I thank you for that tonight Lord I plate you breasts bless the word speak to my heart lord I need much from you father pray you would grant it jesus name amen you can be seated I wanna I got a thought tonight I had this thought I had went to New York again with brother leaning on sister Lois several months back and I had preached a message there for brother Robert and I've got some thoughts out of that and I had a sermon on my computer from back in oh nine and I had some thoughts on that and I kind of put him together in Wednesday night I come to church and brother Donnie preached both of those sermons so I told brother Jimmy I want to try to come at it a little different angle I feel like if the Lord gave it to me I don't feel right to change my thought so with you'll pray and help me we'll get through this as they're kind of making a foundation here for what we're going to speak about a represented by a lamb that would be my title tonight and brother Branham said the church in its condition in Jeffersonville in 56 now it's so pleased God that he sent Jesus to the earth but it pleased him to represent him as an animal that animal was the lamb way back in the beginning in the Garden of Eden in the four shadows of the coming of Jesus God sacrificed a lamb to be a substitutionary offering in the four shadows of the coming of Christ now as we read earlier the in in Genesis Bible does not say that God sacrificed a lamb it says he clothed them in skins but the prophet comes and tells that God took a lamb sacrificed him to cover the sins of Adam and Eve I've often wondered why the God before shadow Christ is an animal as a beast but we come to find out that the lamb the reason he chose a lamb a lamb is the meekest and most gentlest of all creatures on earth there is nothing more weaker and generally than a little lamb so innocence not self sustaining it's not arrogant it's a gentle meek little creature when God was going to represent Christ of the world he represent him as a lamb and to words we're going to look at the meaning them it's very simple it's nothing deep here to represent to take the place of in some respect to act in the place of or for usually by legal right and a sacrifice the act of offering to a deity something precious and he in the lexicons got the sacrifice to slaughter in divine judgment and what we're looking at first here is we see that God has Adam and Eve we know the reason why Adam and Eve by the Branham said that he had a conference he pulled Adam and Eve in the serpent underneath the tree there in the garden he had a conference with him and we kind of look at it like this is the first trial ever on the face of the earth God holds court in the garden he starts handing out penalties now by right Adam and Eve should have been killed and innocent spiritually they were their eternal life ended that day that they took from the tree and they were cast out of the garden but if you know anything about the way the judicial system works the brother branham always said the natural types of spiritual and I know some of the brothers by the way and brother Matthew but telling some of them are familiar with the way the court system works way the judge the judge at any time can appoint anybody any attorney in the courtroom to take a case if it worked the way God had it worked in our judicial system that wouldn't but the Matthew he'd be in quite a situation because you'd have to take the penalty for your client when whenever God appointed representation as he did with the Lambs down through time the way the children of Israel sacrifice her lambs that lamb basically became their attorney became their representation of their sins and their sins was laid upon their attorney and the death penalty was laid upon their return till we look at the first trial Adam and Eve sin that they need a covering they they realize they're naked before God they realized their sin as we know Adam sinned wilfully he was not deceived as receive so God appoints them representation through the lamb if we could look at their sin in the penalty they knew the law they knew that the penalty for the sin was death they knew that if I do what God says not to do I'm going to die so why would Adam do this which we know brother Bantam said he typed Christ being not deceived took took his bride but we know all of this had to take place of God to lay out the type scale out the four shadows of of Calvary of your sins being laid upon Christ but here Adam falls he takes the entire race with him we know that Satan takes the deed to the earth and everything in earth God still holds the abstract so he leaves walking out of the garden wearing these bloody skins now God didn't take time to kill these lambs I lay out the skin tannin salt it scrape it get it nice and warm and fuzzy to put on Adam and Eve as they leave the garden the blood is what Adam has to have for covering it's not the skin itself God required the blood but Lybrand have said in conferences I can imagine God our Father down in the Garden of Eden looking around to find a certain tree to where he could call his children up and do his presents under the tree he selected a place he called that conference and he stood Adam and Eve in the Serpent and there was a conference held they had trespassed the laws and his laws were just a must the penalty must be paid how are they going to live after the death sentence hang on them and there was a conference held there was a perpetuation made for that sin and temporarily until the woman's seed was to bruise the Serpent's head that would pay the full penalty of sin that Islam was sacrificed until there was to be until that would time to be fulfilled there was something that was achieved there was something done that was great a way that man could be saved again so God is laying out a type not as God's just not passing judgment on Adam and Eve and casting them out of the garden just because he could God is trying to lay a foundation of what is to come he's also laying a revelation of what already happened was that able comes along and then Abel brother branham said Abel actually had a revelation actually saw in faith once delivered to the Saints God gave Abel a revelation of what the plan of salvation was so Abel has a revelation of what took place in the garden Abel has a revelation of what white this required blood he has a revelation that it takes a lamb now I don't think that Abel just when he gets this revelation he runs into his little flock of sheep there grabs a lamb out and goes throws on the rock and starts hacking and beating on it what type of lamb did God require the type of lamby required which we know in in Leviticus when he starts talking about revealing to Moses the type of lamb that the children of Israel have to bring for a sin offering has to be without blemish has to be a firstborn of a ewe lamb of the you sheep could be no fault in this lamb and Abel knows the only way he's going back as he offers the same offering that God required so I would say that Abel he probably had a favorite lamb that that he had and no doubt when he gets this lamb maybe he spends days weeks maybe a month inspecting this lamb making sure that it's just right making sure it's eating the right things making sure that there's no blemish he goes through it searches it day in day out this is the lamb he's going to take before God you can't give God just anything you can't just give you sacrifice something for God god I'm gonna miss my dessert today because I'm gonna fast so I'm not going to eat that pie it don't work that way you you you sacrifice things that are going to maybe hurt you a little bit they're going to affect your life a little bit so Abel was going to give up something that affected his life so Abel finds out about this trial that happened in the Garden of Eden he finds out that God had passed judgment he didn't find out from his mother but Brenham said to the mother taught Cain that it was fruits talk Cain that it was the fine things of the earth that God required she fed Cain false doctrine Abel didn't fall for that so by faith but the Bram said that Abel's saw the crucifixion by revelation before the foundation there he had the revelation that Jesus Christ was crucified so here he's going to bring his sacrifice now as he takes this lamb and he's inspected it days weeks he's going to bring this before God as he starts as he lays it up there I'm sure maybe he said a prayer over it before he he began to - brother Brennan said begin a hack on it his throat with the rock and I'm sure blood was was going everywhere and the blood of this lamb began to fall all over Abel let's say just to dramatize a little bit he's sacrificing his favorite lamb the lamb dies he holds his lamb beer more than anything in the world no doubt he falls over the lamb weeping for what he had to give up for what he had to sacrifice and his Adam leaves the altar he's covered in the blood of the Lamb most sisters whenever you come to Christ when you accept that sacrifice it's going to get on you that's the only way that God looks at you is through the blood when he looks at you he sees the blood of the Lamb that's the only hope you had whenever the children of Israel would would sacrifice the Bible tells us that the type of land that they had to bring as a sin offering the lambs were had to be washed they had to wash there was a type of back water baptism they had to wash the land most for years the children of Israel the Jews even after Christ was crucified they still sacrifice lambs because they did not believe that Jesus was the sacrifice of actually sacrifice lambs up to what they call 70 seee which is the Christian era they don't use a B because a DV stands for year of our Lord and they do not recognize him as their Lord but they sacrifice lambs until the Roman Empire tore their temple down and this was something that that they held to the highest standards was their sacrifices so here Abel has this sacrifice that he's bringing let's read this in the power of God Chicago the Bible wasn't written in so if Cain his brother who was set under the same teaching the father and mother came down and brought fruit to make offer but able by revelation he saw that it wasn't fruits that brought us out of the Garden of Eden it wasn't your works that brought to you other denominations it wasn't anything that you could bring anything God didn't in fact God says everything that you have let's get rid of let's leave it in Egypt okay so here he's telling Abel you've got to have the revelation that your mom didn't get but it wasn't fruit soon as the blood of his mother brother Bram says or his father so he came and offered the blood of a lamb by divine revelation no one to tell him anything about it but he by faith he's seen the Son of God coming and he offered a lamb in a figurative type seeing that Jesus was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world he testified and God testified that's the truth God will also will always testify that's the truth so Abel actually some prophecies April actually saw that Jesus Christ was the lamb only a prophet could see that only a prophet could see the revelation that Abel had the revelation that Joe had let's look at Joe he had the same revelation that Adam had that day you had but look at Joe Bob Ram said there there's one coming to to put him in back in the way this is in God's provided way it says oh when I think of that my innermost being screams out what can I do what what can I do to get to this man there's coming one who will place him back to where the one will stand and put his hand and the gap of sin here well he will go in and take sin upon himself and bridge the way back that man came out of the ground again Butler Bram says Joe begin to see it in beginning and ending of Gentile disposition but Branham says the morning stars shouted for joy you ever you ever heard them why you ever anybody ever heard and said why the Morningstar shouted for joy I didn't I read this to just this I think a few months ago them shining one shattered for joy when they seen I'm sorry I'm getting no seeing that someday through a tabernacle here on earth the King Melchizedek would come in the righteousness of God give us a life to redeem us back to God again and outshine the Stars forever job catches this revelation the only reason why Joe God has to show him before he reveals to him the but the resurrection he has to show him something Joe where were you when the Stars had a for joy where the morning the sons of God shouted for joy where were you at so why did they shout for joy why was it King Melchizedek why is it is King make Melchizedek gonna be the one to redeem them back because it's gonna take a sacrifice no Keswick was the high priest only the high priest can make the sacrifice only the high priest could slay the lamb so here job sees a revelation who brings a revelation to him a prophet brother bran said the little prophet Ellie here he began to listen to this little prophet Ellie you faith comes by hearing the first thing you know God raised Jobe raised up God put his Pinnock binoculars down over his eyes he looked away down four thousand years and said I know my Redeemer liveth until last days he will stand on the earth though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall see God whom I was seating myself mine own eyes shall behold and no other he saw the resurrection of Christ so Joe has a revelation something had to die what'd he say he called him my Redeemer how do what how would the hell would he redeem Joe joke knew he was destined to die Jobe knew he was going by the way of the grave look at all the sacrifices did Joe sacrifice daily job first sacrifice for himself if you read you read that and you read in little Levitical Leviticus God required the high priests to sacrifice one for themselves first before they sacrificed the sin offering for the sinner and this was in case there was any sin on the priests job caught the same revelation in case I have sinned in any way when I offered the sin offering for my my children in Chicago in 55 brother branham priests law now in the Old Testament for of the sinner come in to offer for himself a sacrifice he had to find we know all in type how it must be a land without a blemish it must be brought from the sin offering what had to be from the first sheep from his first sheep from the old mother you and had to be without must be without blemish it must be brought up and sacrificed and died for the sins of the people notice then if a man who man who done the something evil committed adultery took the Lord's name in vain or broke the commandments he brought the lamb to the priest the lamb was washed and so forth typifying water baptism he brought the lamb up and confessed his sins before the priest what had done the evil that he did and the priest the note was made of that and was put on the book if that man does same sin two times in a year he died without mercy that's one thing that the lamb the sin offerings done for the children of Israel they didn't give him the ultimate sacrifice it didn't cover their sins as Christ in this was something had to be done year after year after year he would take the sin that the sacrifice he were laid upon the altar he would confess his false after the lamb was washed he was inspected for blemishes the high priest announces there's no fault in the lamb the man lays his hands on the head of the lamb and the priest kills the lamb he hacks and cuts on the lamb the blood of the lamb begins to get on the center and he is covered by the live source of the lamb when he left the sacrifice people would look at him and see he had received representation from the lamb by the blood that was on him let's say this sinner leaves the tabernacle after offering is sacrificed he goes down the road he goes home he's got blood all over him everybody knew where he'd been they could not cues him of anything no matter what he had done he could not be accused the blood of the lamb was on him when God looks at you what what if God looks at you without the blood as we I was talking about when we first started the way the the judge would appoint an attorney for your case one of the things that had added to this message being on my heart I was sitting in court a few months ago waiting on a case that I had in this they take please they're in the court and they do arraignment the Reimann is to let you know what your rights are and to appoint you attorney or see if you can afford one this young man walks up to the the podium before the judge and the judge asked him do you know what your rights are he says yes do you know you had can you afford attorney No look at the photo you won't want to point it to you he said no and this message was already on my heart then and and I really had to think and he he doesn't have a chance he's got no one to represent him he's going to stand before a judge with no representation he don't know the law all's he knows is his rights he knows I have a right to an attorney but he turned it down there's many in this in this day in this last age that had the right to attorney brother Graham said Christ was your attorney you had your right to attorney and you turned it down because you thought you knew what was best you thought that your knowledge of the word your knowledge of the Scriptures of the quotes you didn't need anybody to tell you what to do you're gonna stand before God without the blood because you turned down your attorney and it just sad me and I thought I've been in court I don't know how many times I've seen if you try to do by the math you can tell you the same thing they get in there then you got a clue what they're doing I don't think I've ever seen one win one yet they go in there with I don't know I mean it's free you can afford an attorney won't be upon represent you how easy is that I mean that that's just the same thing you've been offered he didn't even ask you if you wanted to afford one he just said I'll give you one so how could how could you turn it down why was why was the blood why did God required the blood the most why what about the blood was so important why was it blood why was it not something nice like gold silver why was it blood why would the God require him this but a brand of said in Christ in 55 and through the blood you become part of him into the same cell that he came out of you became him into the same cell that he came out of the same part of Christ that came out of God is the same part that you come out of you've got to be identified with that blood whenever God you you have to become part of their blood but but becomes you so when God looks at you and sees the blood of Christ he sees you with the life of Christ has to recognize the life that's why it would took blood because God had to recognize the life and the very presence of it I'm Becca and uh and through the blood you become part of him into the same cell that he came out of and the very presence and part of God comes into you by faith you purchase it and the same Holy Spirit that was in the Lord Jesus Christ comes into you let's look at your lamb for a little bit sees Jesus comes we've read briefly about him about his birth at twelve years old and then it fades away and then we pick him up at the age of thirty John's one of the first one to catch the revelation of who he was so here comes your lamb down to the River Jordan as your lamb comes down John announces him behold the lamb who takes away the sins of the world so he's announced the lamb what is the next procedure for the lamb it's going to be sacrificed has to be washed so the Prophet typifying the high priest washes the sacrifice what happens after that the Lambs washed why did he not go directly from the water to the cross he's got to be inspected for faults he's got to be inspected for mistakes he has to be checked for blemishes immediately Satan tries to find fault in tries to tempt him in for a blemish look at him three and a half years he's washed in the River Jordan he goes through trials temptations ridiculed inspected for three and a half years maybes he that does that he comes before the highest person in the land which is Pilate and Pilate says I find no fault in him phylla pilot just announces the lamb is ready for sacrifice don't even know what he's doing but Ram said well God when it comes to God's sacrifice he does not change the same work requirement that's why he told Moses how to tell the priest how to do it how to wash it had inspected how to prepare it for the sacrifice so here he goes the highest voice in the land which is Pilate announces Christ is now ready for sacrifice who's going to kill him who's going to take the life of this lamb this is your representation this is your attorney in a minute we're going to we're going to put you in the courtroom with him but here is your sacrifice Christ said I put my own life down I take it up no man would take his life but who's required to take the life of this sacrifice it's Melchizedek you read that again if I can find it here kingman milk hesitant would come in the righteousness of God and give his life to redeem us back to God again and outshine the Stars forever and ever so Melchizedek is the high priest which we know brother Branham said in when he when he meant Abraham it was Christ so let's let's put you in a courtroom let's look at your life that was just trying to briefly touch on on the representation of the sacrifice but let's look at let's look how we started out why did we need an attorney why did we need representation every one of you were raised different conclusion nominations some no churches at all some in the message you everyone in your life you were born condemned but the Brenham said you were born condemned got judged you before you were even born so we all needed attorney so as we come in different ways for different paths in life you could have never done nothing you could have been a good person all your life and in that you still were seeing in God's sight filthy dirty could have been the best person on the face of the earth but to God you were trash that's that's just the way it is God looks through the blood blob random said in Hebrews chapter five and six we read and where everyone condemned no matter what we ever do were condemned we were born condemned your mama and your Papa were born condemned you all your ancestors were born in sins shaped and iniquity so how you ever going to get it how are you going to be perfect if you never done a thing never stole never lied never done anything in your life you're still condemned you were condemned before you breathed your first breath you were condemned that's correct you were judged of God before you breathed your first step we've your first breath so let's look at the natural type of the spiritual you automatically come into life with sins so therefore you have to be tried let's put your life inside the courtroom the day that you get appointed your attorney everybody the God is no respecter of person everybody is getting an arraignment that's where you get a pointee journey it's your choice to accept it or turn it down so let's look at your life Sims were drunks some of us ran around on a wife someone have a smoked cigarette some of us didn't do anything but you're still sinned when you all the times you see if you see somebody high-profile I don't think it's arrested for something a big trial they have in the national papers and stuff and you see them sit there in a suit all nice stretched out then after the trial they lead them away and I had always wondered why don't these get it run out want them run away which at the time I didn't know they put on for four purposes for to appeal to people they put leg irons underneath their pants and you can only move your legs a certain way such loss you're hearing this again so I'm sorry and then your legs are only allowed to move just a little bit or they'll put what they call a belly band on you wish put shackles on it and this is the way you move you just move a little bit like this so this is the way you're going through life and your mind you're having fun you have no idea that you're doing this you have no idea how you're walking through life you're having a blast you're enjoying every minute of it and you're headed to the death penalty and you haven't got a clue and this is the way you're walking you're shackled you're handcuffed you go from the courtroom to the prison room you go back and forth your leg back and forth and that's your life and you're excited about it but one day every man has appointed an arraignment every woman is appointed arraignment so you come to court many of you this is the day you found Christ there's many people this is the day they turn him down so let's look at the court setting now your prosecuting attorney is Satan many of you heard his brother Brandon put Christ on trial in the trial the prosecuting attorney is Satan we're gonna put you on trial now and Christ as your defense attorney you're sitting there things in your life you starting to notice things in your life you're starting to notice something's not right you start to wonder where am I headed there's more than this than what I'm doing you start to realize it ain't his fun being shackled as you thought it was you're starting to realize that I need representation so God's the judge and as we get ready for this court trial it's funny sometimes if you sit in court and you watch somebody that's got an attorney in their attorney there yet and they're Swivl in that head looking for him to come in and he's running late and I'll tell you what it's it's funny sometimes so you look on people's faces when they think they're gonna have to represent themselves but here you are sitting and your attorney walks in let's look at the way he walks in the king of heaven and all his glory comes into your life he's gonna sit beside you he's going to tell you you have the right to remain silent which I suggest you do every attorney will tell you that I would suggest that you use that right you have the right not to be put on the stand I suggest that you do that how are you going to explain to God your sins Satan was able to get you understand how are you going to explain to God that you did what you did you've got no excuse you're found guilty already when you walk in so your attorney is sitting beside you he's telling you your rights one thing about it he knows something that you don't know now Satan comes before God he starts pointing out your faults your failures and taste that one you get saved you accept your attorney and you're set free your court trial don't end Satan accuses you every day one thing about your attorney is pro bono for life how many knows what pro bono is it's for free he will represent you for free for life so the judge God sits there and he listens to your life being played out by Satan the best thing about it is right now it's all facts Satan's telling the truth and you're you're sitting there thinking if you ever sit in a court trial and I'm on the whenever I go to trial I'm on the prosecuting attorney side and if it's my case and I'm listening to the defense attorney I'm thinking I'm gonna get beat I am gonna get beat because he's just laying out the facts but then it's my attorneys turn but Satan starts telling God all these facts about you you're wanting to say something in your offense but you your attorney isn't told you to be quiet Satan has the jury stacked against you I did find something out this year about a jury trial that I've never known I've been there 14 years and I never knew I had a murder case where they were trying this man this woman for murder and their baby and we presented all the evidence and the evidence for the prosecutor DA's office was just overwhelming and the defense after they see the evidence he defense attorney stands up and as the judge says I move for the judge to acquit my client I was thinking judge can't do that we have a jury so I asked the DA there said can he do that he said yeah the judge has power to no matter what the evidence is if he says I don't see enough evidence no matter what the jury says he can let him go you know this is like God Satan Satan gave every bit of evidence he had in history all the evidence was the kiss you in fact there's everything that Satan told God about you was true he had all the facts he had the videos he had everything to back it up God says I don't see any evidence I don't see anything to hold the defendant let's look at the witnesses Satan puts on the stand against you he puts temper up their temper says yeah about three or four times a week me and him parted bitterness he puts bitterness up there yeah he's bitter he don't he'll care care what the pasture has to say he gets it walks out lust unbelief addiction depression they all take the stand against you then God just sits there and listens remember this is just your arraignment this is when you accept your attorney after you accept your eternity after you accept your attorney God won't listen to him anymore he stands before God night and day accusing you and God does not hear you because you've got representation seyton presents the facts against you they testify there comes a certain twist to this case God looks at all the evidence than any tales tell Satan I don't see any evidence because I've laid it all on his attorney now in a court trial the attorneys have the right to approach the bench one will not approach without the other if the event says Your Honor may I approach prosecutor Kearney goes with you vice versa because they're not going to let him hear anything that he says the judge that he can't hear so he lays his sins on your attorney and your attorney has to take the penalty let's put this on Jesus for a minute here's your attorney he's in the court trial with you he's sitting there he came in radiant king of glory and all of a sudden God says I'm laying your sins on him in the Garden of Gethsemane Jesus request to approach the bench you think he already knew this was going to happen he already knew that your sins were going to be laid on him but he approaches the benches is Your Honor is there any way we could do anything else here what's your sins look you're saying did you want him did you want the sins that were laid upon you but why would you want your sins to be laid upon the King of glory and here they are he approaches the bench in the garden do you think Satan was gonna let him approach that without him being there but one thing about it Satan took his papers with him to the bench he's held the papers the deed to your life he should have left him at the table because when he approached the bench God reaches over and takes him from me so not only are your sins late on the king of heaven God takes the day back and all this is for free then cost you a dime and those those of you that have accepted your attorney have accepted the fact that your life no matter what your life was before how many would go back how many would undo what's been done for you how many would trade to go back hey when I lived in the world I had fun I had fun I enjoyed it you can't sit there and say you didn't you did your mang overs weren't great but hey they were going away soon that's just the way life was it was exciting so he approaches the bench he asked the father Lord if it'd be like we loved this cup pass from me now brother BAM tells us in the gardens where God left him yeah I used to think God left him because he wanted to see what God what Christ would do that wasn't the case he left him because God will never touch sin sin will never touch God in the sins of the world were getting ready to be laid upon your attorney and the judge pulled himself away so he walks out never wondered what he felt like I wonder what he felt like just of my sins at 44 years just of the sins that I had that were laid upon him how would he feel just if my sins were laid upon him let alone the world John 3:16 was fulfilled then for the world God gave His only begotten Son that all men all men may be saved not will be but maybe that's a choice that's where the may be saved occurs at the arraignment you can accept your attorney or you can try to take the stand for yourself so he's you remember how you walked in the courtroom you walked in shackled moving just like this that's the way your attorney walked out your attorney walked out shackled with your sins shackled with your leg arms shackled with your bitterness he walked out with temper he walked out with lust he walked out with unbelief every sin that you've ever committed Christ walks out of the courtroom with your sin attached to him you've gotten you have no excuse you have no excuse when you had an opportunity to get representation on that day you'll either have representation now or you won't have it there you'll have a no excuse your whole life will be played out before you but Branum said he murdered God murdered his own son and it pleased him Adam was given a decision in the garden he chose to take his bride sin on himself he wasn't deceived he chose to go with her Jesus was also chosen given a choice in the garden and he said not my will but your will be done he chose to take the sin of his bride upon himself and walked out of the garden to his death Adam also walked out of the garden to his death look at the fourth seal Bob Ram Sinha has long looked look as long as the intercessor still him thrown Satan can stand there and accused because he's the attorney afore the other side he's the opponent of Christ and Christ is standing there the opponent is standing there saying but wait Adam fail Adam done this I conquered him I got his wife to believe a lie and you said she'd be damned and I got it but here's the mediator standing there the kinsman redeemer by the brendham says a man standing there with the blood that can take the vial of sinners heart and change it a mediator is on the throne yes sir Satan said they're guilty jesus said they're not many of you you've got scenes you're ashamed of I do everybody does you got things in your life but probably nobody knows every one of us do it's shame it's because of shame and he walked out with that shame take your deepest darkest secret that you've got the worst thing you've ever done that nobody knows about and he walked out with it no one will ever know no one I ever know it'll never be played on that day you've got an assurance that because your attorney took that it'll never ever be brought up again they have what they call an expungement or judicial diversion if you if you enter a plea if you enter a plea that after you finish your time that they'll take this off the book Satan's always wanting to get you to enter a plea just admit you've done this just admit you done that and then after a short period of time once we get this all worked out we'll forget it God don't work that way you've got to say you must think you're dumb because you know your attorneys gonna get it wiped off the slate clean never to be brought up again boning the sea of forgetfulness so why would you take a plea for the easy way out just to just to enjoy a brief more time of worldliness of excitement Satan will get you take a plea just so you can you know have a little more fun over here skip Church here I can't make it today I can't read today I can't pray today sometimes God's Way he's gonna be the hard way Satan's gonna make it look awful easy for you so what was your death what was your penalty your penalty was death you were destined to die that's the death penalty like I was saying earlier I've got to be an attorney nowadays and they've run a courtroom that way if your attorney gets you off he takes the penalty you'd have brother Matthew and all these other attorneys be trying to get civil litigation cases and divorce cases and everything else they would have to do any criminal law wouldn't have no attorneys left they'll be I'll be in jail or killed so here we are is your lamb walks out of the courtroom carrying your sins takes them to hell well Bram said his soul went to hell his body was in the grave bit of spirit went to God and he took your sins to hell kicked in the door and threw him inside yet how many times is satan reach down in there and pull them out and hand them to you and you take him back God's already said you didn't do it God's already said you've paid the price it's been wiped clean and Satan will take your sins he'll take somebody else's sin in the church and hand it to you and you bring it up that sins been head to hell once why not put it back they were put there in hell for a reason because that's where they belong they don't belong in your mouth they don't belong in your head you take a look besides you look at somebody besides you and that is somebody that went to the same thing you went through with you the courtroom had that same God of heaven is their attorney who died for them who gave his life for them and you don't like them God found him worthy God found them worthy to be give eternal life he loved them enough and you're sitting here saying that you have the blood of Christ all over you what comes with the blood the life you'll have the same life but that's flesh that's flesh I can't help I'm gonna have a little flesh God ain't coming after flesh God ain't coming after flesh until you get this under subjection hey we're gonna have a little bit of flesh until we get out of here but that's where the Holy Spirit takes over that's where the life of Christ takes over this flesh and if God found somebody worthy that he would die and take all their sins and give his life murder his own son and we want to back bite him we want to talk about him we don't like to be around them your opinion must be greater than gods gods coming after a body he's coming after a body that is in a likeness of Christ the bridegroom that's what he's coming after what does a body do a body coexist it helps itself it's one unit it cannot be divided God is not coming after a divided body and that's where we get to the point to where once the bride recognizes who she is and we'll get out of here you can't recognize who you are if you're fighting with yourself it don't work that way but Graham said condemnation about representation I'll never forsake him because he represents me a man he is my Savior because that he died for me I'm worthy because he took me as his own he became me that I became him I might become him he became a sinner and took my sins that I might be a son of God so Christ becomes you takes your sins you become him in order for that testimony to be true in your life you'd have to take on that life you have to accept that like we're saying when that sinner laid his hands on that sacrifice and that priest would hack and beat and cut on that lamb and that blood would spray on that sinner he went home with representation where he had been you will leave that courtroom with representation of where have you been the sacrifice if you fully accepted their sacrifice it'll get all over you you can't help it it's a mess it's it's a bloody mess that's the only thing God looks at is the off spray of that lamb the cast off the blood splattered on you you can't wash it off Pilate tried Pilate tried to wash it off he won't wash off it'll need to be testify against you or it'll testify for you so where does this lamb go he goes to hell take your sins has bodies in the grave his spirit goes to God he comes back he goes to get glorified let's look at John is caught up in the vision and he sees your attorney what did he see said the Lion of the tribe of Judah he turned around he's seen a bloody lamb this this is one of my favorite quotes I've probably read it here before so forgive me this is in the breach John looked at that lamb and the lamb looked like he'd been slain he noticed he was wounded and cut and bruised and bleeding a bloody lamb that's what took our place isn't that strange a simple lamb had to take our place and he saw the lamb he proceeded out John hadn't saw him you remember the scripture in Revelations it says John looked there was no one found worthy couldn't find anyone John didn't see the lamb yet the elder had not said behold the Lion of Judah he hadn't seen him yet he's already caught up in heaven he's already caught in the vision he's been there for a little while and he hasn't seen the Lamb yet he has seen no one that's worthy but we had a seventh-day message tell us where the lamb was that when John was looking for me to John head son because he had been way back into the eternities even making intercession and showing that those had come to God under the offering of bulls and goats substitute offering so where's he yet what if a voice could have spoke to John and said John just be patient Abel's blood is still streaming out the blood of Abel screw of sacrifices to crying out to God job's sacrifices are still crying out every children of Israel that offered sin offering to Christ to God it was it had to be redeemed those sacrifices did not give them eternal life they covered their sin for that year that's it so Christ the Lamb he slain John's looking for him he's not there he's going to picking up job sacrifices he's picking up Abel's sacrifice Abraham Isaac Moses he's going to picking all those up and what else is he doing what if he said John just wait the Lambs going down and lay out to see what's going ahead in time he's picking up brother Terry's sins picking her brother Greg sins here's John is looking for him I can't find him because he's making an intercession for you and then the lamb comes and opens the book John saw the lamb revealed my name John saw the lamb revealed his name I would like to think I would like to think that my theophany and John's theophany are brothers I would like to think that John's theophany told my theophany I saw your name because he saw the opening of the book he saw the revelation that come out of that book right not John don't write it do not write it know about there's so much in John that when John came back out that vision he wanted to tell so much wondered he wondered if if we were caught up in that vision with John just say John would been able to tell us if I can't tell you I saw something I don't really want to tell you but I can't tell you that River that revelation John had caught in that vision wasn't only for John that was for me that was for you that was the revealing of my name on the Lamb's Book of Life he some people are happy with having their name on the book of life I want my name coming out of the little book I want my name to be revealed in those seven seals the third seal brother Bram said now we found out that slain lamb is a bloody lamb bleeding all over it's been slain after he'd been slaying it raised again and was sitting on the throne say way back military way back behind the throne like this interceding for all those souls that would come that would come not those that are already come that would come interceding for me and you he's sitting him behind the throne hadn't taken the throne yet he's sitting in behind the throne interceding for all those souls that would come when this last one was here and it was completed God still held the book of redemption now he's just doing the kinsmen work now like Boaz went down and Ruth was just sitting there waiting until Boaz I mean Bowie has done the kinsman redeemer work well the brendham said when he saved others he saved himself well Bram said that was a compliment could have saved himself but he saved others I believe with all my heart you look at the age were living in it is totally corrupt if you want to see what the world is really like you get some of these officers and brother Matthew would go riding with him sometime you'll see things you've never thought possible people do it the world is gone totally insane I had a call one night to go take a girl to the hospital for emergency committal she was they said a homicidal and suicidal she had two sons I think at the time they were my boys age they were around eight and four or something like that I took her there and she started telling me how she had been to rehab all this stuff and I said she was an alcoholic they take her kids from her her sister was trying to get her kids and I said ma'am have you ever tried God it I tried to witnesses some people sometimes it whenever I felt late I don't I don't do it all the time she just looked at me and she said I've tried that it don't work she said let me tell you something she would said I would give both of my sons and my soul for one kind of beer I thought where's the hope for her she turned down her attorney she done testified I've tried it and she turned it down what what are you gonna say to him I like it about Terry what are you gonna say she done made her choice she didn't want to try god she wanted a can of beer if it cost her her soul or her kids that's what would make her happy where are you at in your life are you just now in the courtroom have you even been yet you know now so you if you never have tonight's your night in the courtroom if you've never ever heard it before you heard it tonight so tonight's your arraignment you have a choice to take your attorney or turn him down if you want to represent yourself good luck let me tell you go s go down here to the detention center over to Mountain City and ask some of the guys that represented themselves that's the only place you're going to talk to him at st. how do your walking free they chose their way if I could say anything to help you on this is just totally chopped up but if I could urge you in any way like I'm saying you look at the way the shape the land is of today the government is totally corrupt I don't I'm not saying anything about the way Obama has religious views or anything you don't matter God's in control it don't matter who's in there God's in control if it ain't him the next one will be corrupt that's just the way it is but time is so short when you can have a sinner come up and tell you I was done here at the ball field the other day when the fireman's friend of mine standing about I just walked up leaning on the fence and he leaned over he was two people down walked over stood beside me said Joe I think the world's coming to an end it's not just a revelation to the Christian anymore it's not a revelation to message people anymore it's obvious so I urge you if any way possible that if God has tugged at your heart as God is saying I'm giving you representation I urge you to take it I hope all of us have so let's stand together [Applause] whenever the lamb was hung on the cross his attorney work wasn't done it wasn't over like I said it's still still going on it's even better now because God don't believe the things Satan's say Barabbas is the only person that Jesus died for twice he took his place physically and spiritually I don't know I don't know whatever happened to brightness I hope he took advantage of the opportunity that he had look at the thief on the cross here's an attorney hanging beside him attorney hanging beside him he tells him he's in need of his services Jesus looked at him and said I can't I'm hanging on the cross can't you see I can't do anything hey what he told him said here's my card come to my office here shortly it's for free can you sing that song 10,000 angels you know what he could have called into everything it's just worshiping a little bit on you know it's been chopped up I apologize for my my nervousness that's just part of me sorry they bound Jesus in the

church we come to church because we need to be chasing we need to be instructed we need to we need to find our place a closer Walt all these things and we want to find out where we come up short
