TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it's not a time to lay down it's a time for preachers not to compromise it's a time to fight for the gospel of Jesus Christ it's a time to take a strong conviction and strong stand in the word of God everyone's caving in under the pressure oh that's me you know the message is a little bit hard it's a little bit harsh and maybe we should change this and edit this and change this I don't preach that too hard you know we can't preach that 2012 now and that was back then in the 80s and 90s that was good but you know just compromise I don't need to preach so much about that and you know about how you live people are caving in over the pressure but I'm here to tell you this morning I'm here to stay at my post of duty I'm here to take a sword to saddle a horse and to go to Lauren charge hallelujah the charge in the battle you should thank God for a ministry that stands and tells you the truth those who love you the most will tell you the most truth the false prophets one who tells you lies tells you what you want to hear
