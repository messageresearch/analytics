this song when I first came in the message today I listened to a couple of the dove the lamb and the dove messages that's like Brother Gary said the other day it's it's amazing I thought I understood the Dove and the lamb back then but was listening today and it's I really want to be a lamb that the dove can leave the spirit and the bride say come the elect to be and stir inside their heart our

God what a great hour to be living it's the worst time a human being could ever live on the earth and yet it's the best time a human being could ever live on the earth you say well that sounds confusing that's CZ you're confused not me it's the worst time but it's the greatest time they a never been so dark ain't never been so SLE but it's our greatest hour to be a child of God amen amen let's read together in Revelation 5: 7 question answers tomorrow night Lord willing so those of you that want to come those of you that want to stream will'll be streaming it also I'll need your prayers I'll be speaking Lord willing tonight and then tomorrow night then I've got got to be with brother Josh spett on Friday night be coming back um for church on Sunday Lord Willie we're so glad to have the pastor's wife back with us tonight so if you tried to speak to her before church and she didn't answer you she's not stuck up she just can't hardly talk yet so she still needs your prayers she still got stitches in and went yesterday to the doctor and he said they wasn't quite ready to take them out so just remember that the Lord will just continue to bring healing in her body brother Revelation 5: 7 he came and took the book out of the right hand that hand of him that sat upon the throne when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the 4 and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of oders which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song they sung a new song it's amazing to me how that events on the earth can so move Heaven that it changes the songs that they sing I don't know exactly what our brothers and sisters husbands wives children I don't know exactly what they know how much the Lord allows them to see and that sixth Dimension but I do know from the dreams that brother brandham had his daughter mentions about his Morris chair for those of you that don't remember what that is it was a chair that they repossessed and she told him that his chair was there when he dreamed about his wife he dreamed about how sad and seeing her and she said I know Bill I know I don't know exactly what God allows him to see but I do know our actions here are so correlated with what's going up in there they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation so it's easy to see about this passage of scripture that these are not just Jews Jews would never have said that so what is this Gentiles a diverse people a bride called out of every Kindred tongue people and nation which the Jews still have a hard time understanding of course and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth how many like to be remembered tonight as we pray God bless you this whole our request in her heart remember brother Josh's meeting as I mentioned coming up this week and also Lord willing our our meeting will begin next week and we're looking forward to that time brother Matt Watkins will be speaking on Friday night brother Daryl on Saturday and Brother David Siler on Sunday morning and we're just looking forward to a great time in the Lord let's pray together Lord Jesus it is such an honor again for us to be gathered together here how we love Wednesday night just so grateful that we can be able to have church on Wednesday lord it's such an encouragement to us such a boost during the middle of the week and we're just so happy happy to be gathered in the house of God I pray tonight Lord that you would take your word and speak to us you know exactly what we have need of father I know that many people and our our church family here are dealing with different things in their bodies in their homes maybe in their home life we believe that you're mindful Lord being in contact with people all over the world it seems that there are so many things that your children are dealing with but we believe if we look at it right these things that we face can be opportunities of Faith by which you can Channel your Supernatural power in our Direction so I pray that you'd help us to look at it in that way we need you tonight Lord once again to take the word and break it to our hearts May our hearts be fertile ground that we can be able to receive it in seed form May the spirit of God Quicken it then that it'll mature into what you desire it to produce you see the meetings coming up this week next week Lord Brother Ander Glover Just Landing a few hours ago he text me and just landed in Australia got some meetings there so lots of meetings going on in the summertime and we pray that You' just be mindful of all the camps and things like that lord of the needs of your people for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus that we ask it amen God bless you you may be seated I realize that there are an element of people in Christendom that sees no significance about talking about the seals preaching about them or even trying to understand them I find that very sad myself but I also realize there's an element of people around our own message preachers that don't really preach on the seals they don't study them they don't understand them and it's as if though they have no desire to understand them because somehow they have a disconnect of the value and the importance of what the seals are so they think well we preach the cross we preach the blood we preach forgiveness we preach miracles signs wonders so what do we need the seals for but I believe from the scriptures that we've read tonight plus the other scriptures of course um that the seals play such an important part in the plan of God in the capping part of of the work of Calvary the sealing of the individual and the breaking of the seal on the individual's life and then the breaking of the seals in the church ages and then in the end time the seals being broken to help us to see our position and who we are I don't know it makes me wonder sometimes if people have ever really run across some of the statements that I'd like to to share with you right now I I think if they did it would help them to see more of a value listen to this in the rising of the sun he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals oh my goodness so the Lord Jesus the lamb is the seals so if we don't think the seals have any importance and any value we are saying that this part of Christ has no value so if we would do the same thing to Healing miracles signs and we realize that some of the message are so against all of that aspect of God some major on it some don't even minor on it but to me if it's part of God I want it I want to get it in its right place of course but if the Lord Jesus suffered stripes for our healing why wouldn't we want to be healed sure go to your doctor do all of that but when your doctor does everything that he can do for you he still canot heal you only the Lord Jesus is your healer so I look at the word of God in every aspect of that word and if it is revealing a further part of the personage of the Lord Jesus I want to understand that I want to be able to I may not understand it as great as other men do but I want to understand whatever God will let me and my capacity understand I mean understands that for yourself you want to be exactly what God wants you to be now he says he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole word of God is Christ so the whole word of God is Christ so preaching the cross is Christ preaching on the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's Christ and yet there's millions of people who profess Christianity Today that don't even believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm convinced friends I know you've heard me say it for years I'm convinced with all of my heart it's one of the greatest lacks in our message is that people have never had a Pentecostal experience I'll be dealing with it a little little bit Lord willing tomorrow night with one of the questions that's been asked and I'll go ahead and say it tonight I really believe that some of the message preachers the reason they fight emotion so much and the reason they fight us following the spirit of God and the spirit of God moving and so on in the services is because many of them that do that have never had a Pentecostal experience themsel if you ever have a true G genine acts two I ain't talking about isus Street an Acts 2 experience with God You' want everybody and their brother to have it come on you want your children to have it you'll want your grandchildren to have it you'd want your greatest enemy to have it because if they get it they won't be your enemy no more you would want everybody to experience that thing that you have had I mean you find people over and over and over again and they're preaching against emotion their all of their quotes are against emotion and it's as if though why why are they riding that horse over and over again and yet they thems themselves cry all the time and you saying du crying is an emotion as a matter of fact the prophet tells us in the church AE book that of all the human emotions the one the Lord Jesus expressed the most was crying I'm glad God did not make us as humans without emotions well come on somebody you imagine what would be if we didn't have emotions so our children tap into our emotions our grandchildren tap into our emotions sporting event whatever you enjoy doing they tap into your emotions so if you let everything else have them emotions why not let the Lord Jesus have them I don't understand why I would not want to give him my tears my joy my hands my feet everything about me my why would I want to give it to the world and not give it to the Lord Jesus himself I think he deserves everything that I am don't you you so he he wants our emotion he wants our joy he wants us to so feel you imagine when he goes to the tomb of Lazarus in St John 11 and that experience tapped in not only to the faith of God in the Lord Jesus but the Lord Jesus allowed himself to express several emotions at the grave of Lazarus and the first notable one was that Jesus wept so the the grave and the death of Lazarus tapped into the very Humanity of the Lord Jesus and he allowed himself to cry but that was not the only emotion that he did because he cried out with a loud voice so you see crying out with a loud voice I know some people the only way they know how to worship God is be still and know that I am God God speaks in a still small voice but God also Thunders come on Christ is that scripture about the still small voice but Christ is also them thunders of Revelation 10 so if we preach only the loud Thunders and we don't preach the still Small Voice we're still not preaching all the attributes of Christ and reverse part if we preach only the still Small Voice and we don't preach the shouting the running the screaming we're still leaving out that part of Christ I love the quotes an invisible Union when brother brandom talks about them acts 238 screaming hollering speaking youngans I realize there's some message folks they cringe when those quotes are read why because they do not believe them it does not go along with their emotions but a real child of God that has the Holy Ghost they don't just say Amen to their favorite quotes they say Amen to those that burn their hides they don't just say Amen to their favorite scriptures but the Holy Ghost s them will say Amen to those and I mean turn them up one side and down the other cuz it ain't just you saying amen it ain't just me saying amen it's the Holy Ghost in us saying amen amen amen is that right you know once we realize that that the word the whole word is Christ so if Christ Jesus is the seals then there must be some great value and and looking at these seals now notice he said the whole word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was open what is the opening of the seals then revealing Christ so the opening of the seals is revealing Christ why would not we as a church want to know what all that contains notice and even the very seven angels which represented the seven churches now notice the seven angels which represented the seven churches all completed we couldn't even see it they did they took the picture not us they took the picture who science do you think the scientific magazine and Life Magazine would have ever put that picture of the cloud in there if one of the message followers took that picture do you think they would have put it in there if brother brandham would have had a camera out there he and Fred sofman and the other believers and they would have took a picture of that and they would have sent it to the Science magazine or Life Magazine do youth s Life Magazine would have posted that picture but how did God do it God let the scientists themselves God let several people again if God would have allowed some of brother brenham's team in 1950 in Houston Texas in the same Houston Coliseum and Billy Paul would have run out with a camera and snap pictures of the pillar of fire and and then some other brother and some other believer and some shouting Holy Roller Pentecostal preacher do you think that picture would still be in the Library of Congress and oh yes it's still there I was there a few years ago in Washington DC brother Mike walls took us there he's took people there from around the world when they go in asking about it they've got to where now they know where they want so they say you want the cloud picture it's in drawer so and so and file so and so we have helped make it famous because it means so much to the bride of Christ because we don't just see brother brandom in that we see the Lord Jesus well praise the Lord I don't just see brother Bram it was quite an honor for me to be able to reach down in there and pick that up you have to put gloves on and all that thing you know but it was quite an honor Carol and I stood there and the other believers that was there to be able to hold it in your hand and realized I am part of that not only that but a part of what was on that picture with was in my soul when I was standing there holding it that same Pillar of Fire that same Lord Jesus is my master I'm not just a part of a picture I'm a part of a move come on Saints this is more than just a about a picture oh they can call us whatever they wish to but we are identified and we're not serving a god of yesterday but a Christ who is the same yesterday today and forever Now watch how he goes into this he said they took the picture not us and there he is standing there Supreme judge showing that he is Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end what identification so the seals in is more than just well a white horse rider and a red horse rider and a black what's the big deal brother D the big deal is it's Christ The Mystery of God revealed so in the seals is going to open up something further of your inheritance and it's not just talking about the Millennium it's not just talking about the resurrection and the change of the body but it has to do with things we need right now in this present life is there people here tonight that need healing are there anybody here that needs encouragement anybody here that needs a little more joy a little more happiness need a financial move look at all the hands in here tonight then you wonder how many more there's out there that stream it well the seals is to loose your inheritance and help you to see who you are in order to do that it will have to be a supernatural anointing that will help us to be released also to match our identity now watch this in the breach but now in this seven seal Sevenfold book of seals of redemption that the lamb took within himself I want you to notice what he does the lamb takes the book from Spirit God in the symbolism he takes the book and he takes that book into himself so he pulls it into his being now the seven seal book of seals the Redemption the lamb takes within himself was the only one that could to it so he took it from from the right hand of him that sat upon the throne to claim his Redemptive to claim his rights to claim for me and you what he redeemed us from so it has to do with now it has to do with tomorrow it has to do with next week it has to do with your Resurrection it has to do with your rapture it has to do with your Millennium it has to do with your eight day this is who you are as a group of Believers notice he said he come to redeem us back to everything that Adam Lost In the Garden of Eden he has redeemed us back to that now who are those that are going to be in the full scale of redemption redeem means of course to buy back so if I went into a pawn shop and I saw a RI nail gun there and I walk over there I say oh wow man that's a really good buy that's about half the price of what you get it over at Home Depot and oh there's a two gallon Robby sprayer and there's a Milwaukee drill and there there and I said I want to buy that I want to buy that well where's your ticket I I don't have no ticket but I I just want to buy that I I need that too but sir this is still up here and we're holding this for the person this cannot be on public sale until this certain day has expired oh but I'll give you $5 extra no sir that's not the way we do it they have a right to come back and redeem this and once this day is expired if they don't come back then we can sell it to you but we're sorry we cannot sell this to you now now we have some other items over here and they're made by Ching Wan do and they're made in Wang Wing we you know where they all come from and uh lee long long long Le long made this one and W Wong wi Wong made that one I don't want what Wang Wong Wing bong you got anything John Smith's made and Daryl you know any of them guys you got anything like that I I've done had some of Wing Wong Woos tools and they don't last so long they do to get them from Harbor Freight I'd like to have something that's going to be redeemable I don't want no Wing Wong woo Christians around here neither I ain't look for no jing jong juu and no haa cha and no we wo wo I like to have some Holy Ghost filled baptized Sanctified children of God whose names are on the Lambs Book of Life they're not scared of the devil they're not scared of death they're not scared of sickness they're not scared of evil because they have found their name and it ain't Wing Wong word but they found their word name in the word of God and they're willing to stand up and fight for what is rightfully ours so only redeemable people will ever acquire to this notice in the Harvest Time the book of redemption he redeemed all that was in that book not out of the book now remember the foolish virgin or now than that Lamb's Book of Life nor are those others outside of there but the book of redemption contains the name of the redeemable anything that had a beginning has an end but if you've got eternal life you never did begin and you you cannot end because your sons and daughters of God attributes of his thoughts and his word you have no ending of life if your name is on that book The Lamb came to redeem it not all that profess Christians not all that try to live good and holy but those whose names were written on there praise God he redeemed that and that alone whose names are on the book now how long will it take it will take until the last one is redeemed on that book aren't you glad that might have been you or I so it will take exactly that long that God dispersed his seed from the very beginning down to the ages there might be 500 it might be 5,000 we don't know but when that last one whose name is on that book notice he said the lamb in the time of intercessory back there he knew knew that there were names in there that was put in from the foundation of the world and as long as them names have never been manifested on Earth so think now you have got to manifest a name as long as those names are not manifested on earth oh Hallelujah never been manifested on Earth he had to stay there as intercessor do you get it perfectly pretty predestination all right he had to stay there because he came to die for those that God had ordained to eternal life see by his for knowledge he saw them not by his own will his will was that none should perish but by his forn knowledge he knew who would and who would not therefore as long as there is one name that had never yet been declared on Earth Christ had to stay there as an intercessor to take care of that name you see when he starts take caring taking care of that name in heaven the human respondant on the earth will automatically start feeling a draw so when the Christ the lamb goes toward that name on the book surely friends we must be on the last page we must be on the latter part of that book and them last ones are there and when the hand of God starts moving toward that last's name as it were to manifest that name on the earth no matter what color they are what race they are what continent they live are there'll be something that'll sweep over that little eagle and start pulling them toward the Throne of God they might have said I don't believe in God I don't want to go to church I don't want nothing to do with God but all of a sudden something will move on them like it did on you do you think it was you making up your mind it wasn't you making up your mind the lamb approached your name on the book Hallelujah the lamb started moving toward your name on the book and whatever day that was that was the time that you were to come to him because the manifestation of your name demanded that you come into that sphere with God Oh Glory but as soon as that final name has been splashed splashed in that Clorox are bleached and the intercessory Days Are Over let him that's filthy be filthy still let him that's holy be holy still he leaves the sanctuary and when it becomes a judgment seat woe to those outside of Christ then again souls in prison when that last name on that book was redeemed the lamb came forth and took the book I'm the one that did it he says but when God takes that last name and redeems it from The Book of Life That's all of it there can't be no more anyhow when the LI name comes out that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life that was slain from the foundation of the world when that life's name has been redeemed his work is finished he comes forth to claim what is redeemed that's what makes a heart bleed but if it went on a thousand years later that would not be even one take of years ago I remember as a boy in Pentecost hearing him singing wait a little longer please Jesus a few more days to get our loved ones in oh wait a little longer that was the understanding that I was raised in but you realize he will not lose or one oh my then Redemption will be over as far as making up the Gentile bride and what will happen now listen friends make sure that you understand that God in this time before it's done God is still reaching out Mercy to those foolish virgins that can be saved if the spirit of God moves upon their hearts oh you say but brother Donnie what if they don't believe the message many of them are not ordained to believe this message but I'll tell you one thing I would rather sit around a church even if it was a message Church I'd rather be under that canopy of protection I believe my name is there I believe with all of my heart it is but I'm going to serve him if my name ain't there if the Rapture takes place and I'm left here behind I've still have had a glorious life serving almighty God I'm not serving him because I want toap escape this world I'm not serving him because I'm hoping I'm bride I'm serving him because I love him if he cast me away at the end of the way I'd still rather live for him than I would for the Devil the devil ain't got no love for me the devil ain't never been kind to me he ain't never been kind to you but Jesus has been so good and so wonderful and so awesome and that's the reason I don't think that I'll ever be lost because loving him the way I do I just can't see myself as not being a part of that bride but if I looked up there and my name wasn't there I'd say that's fine Lord I'd still serve you I'd still pre well you say boy if I knew that I I'd go out there and live like the world that shows you don't love him right if you love him right and he throwed you away at the end of the way you'd still say blessed be the name of the Lord the Lord is good the Lord is righteous he gave me more than I deserved anyhow but when I name is redeemed the Lambs take the book and walks away that's all Redemption is over it's closed that last name goes on the book or the last name that's redeemed that was put on the book that settles it can't you see friend it won't make any difference how far it goes and how much people think they're getting saved you see we have to be in that quickening as it was in the beginning Brothers just jump down there to Ruth chapter 4 verse 11 now remember the parallel between Boaz and Ruth is an exact anot type uh between Christ and the Gentile bride notice what happens now whenever he returns and we're back at the gate and all the people that were in the gate were back at the Gate of of the city of his inheritance all the people that were in the gate and the elders said we Are Witnesses we Are Witnesses the Lord make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah which too did build the house of Israel which is a very peculiar statement which two did build the house of Israel Rachel and Leah well I thought it would have been Sarah Rebeca but Rachel and Leah Glory which too did build the house of Israel now notice what they are saying the Witnesses are saying about Ruth let Ruth build the house of Israel do thou worthily end Ephrata and be famous and Beth him what wonderful changes has now happened to Ruth's life because she trusted Boaz and let him work on her behalf now remember while this whole thing has been going on at the gate she's still back out at Naomi's house waiting she don't even know the outcome of all this yet prophecy is being spoke over her her Destiny has been made manifest and she's back there Sweating Bullets as we'd say she don't even know yet the outcome because he is at the gate Oh Glory to God he is at the gate and the Witnesses in the gate are speaking about her when she still down at the house don't you understand whatever we read this setting of Revelation 5 and those witnesses that have already died and got on in the presence of the Lord and the other ones are on the earth and they're up there singing about what we're just breaking into they're singing and rejoicing you are worthy and you made us Kings and Priests and our Gods we're still down here fighting Devils we're fighting sickness we're fighting trouble we're going through all these things and they're up there shouting and rejoicing and saying glory to God Rose glory to God Rose you've made it because of your Perfection you're going to cause a resurrection because of your completion you're going to wind up causing the body change Ruth and Ruth is still down there sweat and and I wonder how it's going I wonder what's going on up there in the gate I wonder if to got me or I wonder Boaz got me she ain't still sure am I do I belong to Boaz or do I belong to toad God wrote her name with Boaz before the foundation of the world God wrote your name was Christ Jesus before the foundation of the world but sometimes he lets us set in the house and we're sweating and we're threaten and we're worried but if we could just be identified and what we believe recognizes that's something in our soul we say Lord I've got to be a part of that Resurrection I've got to be a part of this word something down in me identifies me with this word notice so she's trusting Boaz huh look at the contrast now so she moves from loneliness to love she moves from reproach to acceptance she moves from being a beggar to being a great great mother in the lineage of the Lord God she moov moves from toil to rest she moves from rejection to absolutely being accepted by not only Boaz but of the people now remember these people would have been some of the same ones when she first come in that would have rejected her and turned her down and God's turning right around and making them people prophesy of her Destiny she moves from poverty to wealth from walmar oh h Hallelujah from poverty to we from worry to Assurance from rejection out of all the rest of the people to the total acceptation not only of man but of almighty God she moves from despare to Hope can I repeat them to you again she moves from loneliness to love from write this down so you can write it down because it's describing you you can read it later from loneliness to love from toil to rest from poverty to wealth oh Hallelujah from worry to Assurance from despair to Hope I move from Darkness to light I move from loss to F I moved from Pentecost Amen to come and Su at the table with the Lord Jesus I was somebody would have church with tonight some of you moved from a bar stool you moved right up to Heaven's table you moved from the Lost wretched sin that you were in and now you are accepted in the eyes of God you move from a bar stool to the table of the king you move from a layer to seean condition and now your bride time bride light bride word bride understanding bride manifestation why because we have trusted and are trusting our Boaz I'm not trusting myself I'm not not trusting you I'm trusting our boys she is no longer going to beru the moabitas she's going to get a new identification Ruth the wife of the Ancient of Days boas so you went from being Miss Baptist Miss Church of God Miss Apostolic Miss jovah witness come on some of you is Miss Catholic Miss Lutheran some of you is Miss message people you didn't have the Holy Ghost yet but you just sitting in the message Church it ain't good enough to be C this message come on so you moveed from that to be called miseries Jesus Christ Oh Praise the Lord and all the people that were in the gate and the elders said we Are Witnesses the Lord make the woman that has come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah it's like a poetic term that God allows the people to say when they say this so they mention Rachel and Leah with a significance and and Rachel is named first but Rachel didn't have children first but yet Rachel is mentioned first because even though she struggled in having children she was Jacob's true love and remember it was Sarah that struggled to have children Rebecca going to that time in her life Rachel going to that time and her life don't you understand God was writing it in the Old Testament that sometime the chosen of his own heart will struggle to bring forth them Christ's children whenever the baren will bring forth more children and will bring them forth a whole lot easier then sometimes the chosen of God why would Sarah The Chosen wife of Abraham have such a hard time bringing forth and Abraham goes in one time to Hagar the Egyptian may he goes into her one time and she can sees he went into Sarah time and time and time and time again and failed and failed and failed and fail you can see why that God was writing the mystery of our lives in the lives of those women and Sarah would cry and lament and wonder oh God why me some of you it's been the greatest desire of your heart to Manifest this word that you hear and you go to church week after week month after month year after year say Lord will I ever be what I hear preach will I ever come to it yes you will and you need to quit asking the question and start making the statement yes I'm going to become what I hear preach that's the reason God's letting it fall on my ears and my ears are not de I want it I want it more than I want anything I wish somebody would hear me tonight I want it more than I want my food I want want it more than I need the drink of my body I want to become this word I want to become everything the Lord God wants me to be why do I have such a Time producing it Rachel and Leah both come from a heathen origin Rachel and Leah Donnie and Carol JD and Barbara Lance and Erica you and you and you and you turn around look at all the rest of them heathens sitting there by you former heathens that's right brother Rob ask Carol now if we give our little testimony about our life and Carol gave hers and I watched some of the young people and I was also looking at brother Rob as well and Carol told about being raised in a home or they didn't go to church and didn't read the Bible so when Carol got saved at the age of 16 was the first time she ever heard the story of Daniel and the lion stand she never knew about David and Goliath Abraham and Sarah in the Bible Belt in America it ain't no wonder she loves to go to church so much now Hallelujah think of it Living in America never most of your kids our our kids in Sunday school are taught these things and I I saw her there the other night as she was telling that and see her getting choked up and I saw brother Rob and I saw some of our young people sitting there in their eyes is getting real big oh my goodness this is the pastor's wife and the pastor's wife never knew nothing about Daniel never knew nothing about the lies then never knew nothing about it no but her name was on the book you see and God even though she didn't have a family that raised her up in the truth a family that read the Bible but God got a hold of her it was not Carol Jean Smith that was looking for God it was God looking for Carol Jean Smith it was not you looking for God it was not me looking for God oh but brother Donnie I went to that Youth Camp glory to God I made up my mind you baloney it was the spirit of God moving on you or you'd have been an outright Heathen you'd have been raised up and sitting in a message church and turned into the office Infidel ever was but almighty God moved over you and began to called on you because it was time for your name to be manifested on the earth God had a word about you God had a prophecy about you like he did Ruth the moabitas Hallelujah so these two are singled out by the people that the fertility that God gave to Rachel and Leah might be given to Rose all the people that were in the gate and the elders said we Are Witnesses the Lord make the woman that is coming to thine house like Rachel and like Leah which two did build the house of Israel wait a minute I thought men built it I didn't realize women could come on now you Brothers go ahead and say Amen it won't it won't hurt you say it it's all yeah come on ease it out ease it out there you go God is fixing to do something watch him which too did build the house of Israel and do thou worthily look at the word strength might wealth Force army army worthily in Fr oh I find it amazing now several hundred years after this what is it Micah chapter 5 oh thou Bethlehem though Thou Art the least among the princes yeah out of the shall come forth a prince which shall rule my people and Ruth's Destiny was tied to that Prince a farmer moabi this Glory IFH the Hebrew word eata means fruitful the people wanted Ruth to be fruitful and F and bring honor to their little town mm it was a place where Rachel was buried ah Rachel's Tomb we saw it several years ago Rachel's Tomb saw the very place where Rachel was buried so one was dead and another one was alive death and the living so one brought Fame to the tribes of Israel and God let her go by the way of the Grave another one is now alive in the same message and going to carry it on to the resurrection do you understand Christ and the bride merging together in the Rapture out of her Union with him will produce the son of David rain out of the Bride notice this in verse 12 let thy house be like the house of FZ whom Tamar bear unto Judah why are these people saying this now Rose be like Rachel be like Leah and let thy house be like the house of FZ whom Tamar bear unto Judah of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman FZ so FZ is the son of Judah by Tamar out of him come the family of the bethlehemit for it was out of them that Bethlehem was built so what's she doing she she is being identified the prophecy they are speaking is you are going to come back to the original inheritance of who you are friends this is why I think we need to stand like never before with our Pentecostal inheritance of Acts two I studyed on it today I'll tell you what I better had a spell I had to share the quotes to some of the brothers it was just so powerful what brother renam was talking about that Pentecost is our possession I'm ain't talking about his L the street I ain't talking about going back to just a bunch of emotion I'm talking about a real genuine experience of Acts chapter 2 can't you see what they're telling Ruth and they're saying about the union between Ruth and Boaz you're going back you are tied to the original founding of this city this city was built and named of a woman like you you are identified in that original identification of the word you're not Baptist you're not Church of God you're bride this is why you had eternal life notice this of the family of the bethlehemit you see the Jews say that Ruth was 40 years old Boaz is about 85 to 90 so they are announcing the blessing of God on this Union little did they realize from this Union would come the natural flesh of the genealogy of King David and the King of Kings tomarrow was a Canaanite Ruth a moabitas Rachel Leah heathens glory to God look at the genealogy of the Lord Jesus look at how many mothers females in the family tree that Matthew mentions look at how many of them were blotted by sin were heathens were in darkness and God chose the female to come through that don't you see your picture bride don't you see how you're identified judah's oldest son was er a so he married Tamar she become judah's daughter-in-law but the Bible says that ER was a wicked man and God killed him that's what your Bible says so Judah followed Jewish custom and gave Tamar to his second son which is Onan but Onan too was a wicked man so by custom Judah should have given Tamar to the youngest son whose name was Sheila s h e l a h Sheila but Judah thought man This Woman's killing men faster than I'm them it ain't worth a risk I I just can't do it I just can't do it I this is only boy I've Got My My My Tribe will be lost oh Lord God little did he know she wasn't supposed to bring forth the child from Sheila from the head of the tribe himself it would have been much more acceptable it would have looked a whole lot better it would have made a much cleaner story had she married Sheila but God knew he's going to have some pretty bad young ones well praise the Lord so he wanted to write some hope down through the scriptures didn't he so he actually tells sure you know let him get a little bit older and let him grow up a little bit and and and I I'll give him to you yeah fine that's that's what the Jewish custom says and I'll do it but it kept putting her off and putting her off but there was something inside of her she couldn't describe it I wish somebody had hear me tonight there was something down inside of her it wasn't lost this woman was not lasting to have an affair with a man there was something in her that was beyond explanation why do I have to deal with this Judah God he's making my life so miserable and making it so hard on me if she only wanted a man she could go to all kinds of other men she could reach out to all kinds of other men why she drw to Judah it consumed her remember it was not lust come on it was a desire for a union with a prince after judas's wife died he goes to the hearing of the sheep he and a friend of his on a Dolomite passed through a certain place and Timar hears about it you remember the story she dresses herself as a Canaanite prostitute which they would pain her eyes with stulum stulum an antimony we'll hear it tomorrow night if we get to it one of the questions she hides her face but they would paint her eyelashes their eyelids upper and bottom cuz to them to make the eye appear bigger more seductive so she takes on this look and Judah seesar and remember she's not looking just for any man but one man Buton was what she' done right no it wasn't it was not right but remember she's a heathen like some of us were a lot of the stuff we done wasn't right well come on don't sit there and look at me Google ey there's probably still things you're doing tonight that still ain't right well praise the Lord but God saw the desire don't you see how God looks at the soul and God sees that cry where did she get that oh mighty God buried within her that portion of that predestinated word I don't even like that man he's treated me bad he's been mean to me he's deprived me I don't even like this guy why is it that I'm yearning I'm longing for something it's I don't understand she wanted a Judah Offspring she didn't just want offspring she wanted a Judah Offspring I don't want just Offspring at our church come on we want Jesus Offspring amen there's a strange thing in her the tribal Chief himself one many times she she talked to herself and said are you nuts dear you out of your mind you know what he'll do to you this man is a tribal chief he could have you killed just like that get this out of your mind wait for him wait wait for SAA a Kate Kate Pho the Jewish historian who lived in the time of the New Testament wrote this about her Tamar was a woman from Syria Palestina who had been brought up in her own native city which was devoted to the worship of many gods being full of statues and images and in short of Idols of every kind and description but when she emerging as it were out of profound Darkness was able to see a slight beam of Truth she then at the risk of her life exerted all her energies to arrive at piety living for the service of and Inc constant supplication to the one true God Tamar was struck in a very hard place because she had been returned to her father's house you see when her husbands died she had no place to go yeah so your final tells us she went back to her father's house her father's Gods her father's worship but Tamar couldn't be satis father should been around Yahweh Oh Glory to God am I'll tell you one thing I've been studying this week you want know why I'm so all cranked up tonight I found a new name of God I've been setting this Bible for my whole life setting this message for over 40 years and studying this week I found something in the word I thought Lord have mercy it ain't no wonder that's going to take eternity oh it ain't new it's just new to me been there in the Bible the whole time oh my no I ain't going to tell you about it you have to come back Sunday so she had no status she had no security no welfare no social security no check no nothing her only hope was a child but not just any child but a child for a certain man we remember the story Judah finally finds out about and he's going to have her stoned burned and then she presents his staff of course his identification so Tamar conceives twins now remember who these twins are of her father-in-law little could Judah have realized he would be the father of a great multitude and Christ would descend lineally out of his own body of the Union between Judah and Tamar God never chose to bring his line through FZ God never chose to bring his L to this flesh that flesh God chose Judah the lion of the tribe of Judah not sheilah not air not Onan but Judah himself I don't know about you I don't want to be pregnant with a seed of a Preacher I don't want to bring forth a Tim Brit I don't want to bring forth a Donnie Reagan or a Ron Spencer or a Daryl Ward come on somebody or a Pete Lawson or some other preacher why what I want to bring forth the image of some man when I can bring forth the image of Jesus Christ I don't want you to be a bunch of Reagan I don't want you to act like me I don't want you well I want to be just like brother Donnie no you don't you want to be like the Lord Jesus why would you settle or want to be like me or want to be like some other preacher when the Lord God is offering you himself and the proy of your womb can be Christ the anointed word not some f man like me Genesis 38:28 and it came to pass when she travailed that one put out his hand and the Midwife took and bound upon his hand a Scarlet thread saying this came out first scarlet color of redemption now and it came to pass as he drew back his hand that behold his brother come out if you look at Tamar just right you'll see yourself right there you should have come forth the Scarlet one amen that should have been the first birth but instead it drew back and this come forth first behold his brother came out and she said hast thou broken forth this breach be upon thee therefore his name is called FES so here here was the breach Lord children here is the breach you should have come forth in the right way but you bypassed there theophany so the theophany pull back and the breach come for us here you go gray hair go say contacts false teeth false knees false hips well the rest of us live a whole lot much longer I don't know how much plastic we're you know how much real stuff we're going to have R st is going to be plastic and stainless steel come on somebody man Al we used to preach about the body chain the Lord changing Adams he's going to start changing stainless steel one of these days I'm not sure how that's going to work some of you that's gotten you got joints is made out of this and that and other I imagine if the Lord could change a bone or change a cell he could turn a t St Ste in one good day so what did happened we should have been that should have been me that was my right yes but instead it pulled back and then your eye come like this the breach and the breach was upon me and afterward came out his brother that had the scared thread upon his hand that was the redeemable me glory to God I was identified with the Scarlet thread before I was ever born thank you Jesus and his name was called Zarah so Zarah put his hand out first but feris notice from whom Christ came forth so actually Christ j can't you see it what a beautiful story Christ didn't come forth from Zarah the one with the Scarlet Christ came forth from the breach feris so he had to become a man himself a kinsman redeemer so he couldn't come in the form of theophan and go to the cross the theophan couldn't die so he had to come in the form of feris so the breach was upon him but somebody he had to take the seals or than himself here is the breach this is the missing link between God and man oh we talk about a missing link being the serpent yeah that's only one side of it but there was another Missing Link here's the mystery of it right here hallelujah the Lord God was that Missing Link but he must condens send between his holy righteousness and no holy man how does he do it to the lineage of Fes Oh Glory to God so Judah calls his name feris or breaker breaker so he's a chain breaker a sin breaker a devil breaker a bondage breaker Oh Glory to God glory to God I wish I was out in the woods by myself uhhuh I sure do right now cuz I'm afraid if I really act like I feel some of y'all go to passing out like flies I'll tell you one thing I don't know what you're seeing you're tonight but I'm seeing the mystery of redemption I'm not looking just back in history but I'm looking right here tonight and seeing myself in this open book I hope you're seeing yourself in this open book oh it was that Scarlet one that's the one you're longing for that's why we're never satisfied living in Fes we're longing for the Scarlet one but brother sister we've got to overcome farz the breach we've got to come through the breaker in order to bring to the Redemption of Zarah let me close RSE 4:13 so Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife and he went in unto her the lord gave her conception and she bear a son by Boaz an old man when she had been married in her previous marriage to a young man but through that Union no Offspring but she marries an old man and the lord gave her conception and she bear a son so the souljourn in Moab lasted about 10 years now believe it or not how many ever weeks it's taken me to bring this to you actually it only happened in about four or five weeks they say the Book of Ruth the span of it was about four or five weeks whenever it come to the time they first crossed Jordan to come back in and go through this whole process her life was changed in about four or five weeks so she went from being this woman that was looked down upon and reproached to becoming in the very lineage of the Lord Jesus so from that time until the time that he takes her to himself so Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife was his wife and he went into her and the lord gave her conception and bear a son let me close with this what Eve failed to do spoken words of region of seed Mary did she took the word eve took Satan's lie Mary took God's word and through Mary's seed replenishes the Earth again through his bride through the word he will bring up the Millennium when Christ and the bride unite together and we go to the marriage supper and at the end of the tribulation period out of the finalization of our union he was King God King Jesus king theophany so when we merge together and we become body C genene theophany we merge in that Holy Union to King God King Jesus king theophany you will also be your correct Trinity you will come together after the marriage supper of the Lamb your union finalized will produce the son of David out of your spiritual womb will come from Millennium well if I didn't give you enough to think about tonight you can come back Sunday and I'll try again we'll pick this up again Lord willing next time in verse 14 and the women said unto Naomi ah so through the Redemption of Ruth Naomi is going to get placed again in her proper position and the women said unto Naomi blessed be the Lord which haveth not left thee this day without a Kinsman yes and that his name may be famous in Israel Naomi didn't give birth it was through roseth that she come back the 144,000 don't you understand the prophet says they will be the ones in the bride chamber in the Millennium Israel will never be accepted back to God again in marriage by nationality think of it one at a time Jews can come and be a part of the Gentile bride because it's of all Nations but in the Millennium they will be replaced again Ezekiel 44-48 being the rebuilding of the temple in the Millennium and they will come through the gates and all that if you'd like to read it sometime and what will it be after Boaz and Ruth come together out of that Holy Union then the 144,000 will again be identified in Temple worship through their productivity of the Gentile bread and the women said unto me blessed be the Lord which ha not lift the this day without a Kinsman that his name may be famous in Israel and he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life and a nourisher of thine old age for thy daughter-in-law which loveth thee which is better to thee than seven sons you were excluded Naomi out of the seven Church ages but God has given you a Ruth and out of this Gentile bride she has borne him and he will be a restorer of thy life and Naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom and became nurse unto it so Naomi becomes the nurse of OED now this Hebrew phraseology is she adopts him amen she adopts little OED so here it is she's an old woman now but this young child has restored her life and brought her back to being a young woman again and the women of Bethlehem named the boy OED which means worshiper worshiper the Bible tells us then shall the knowledge of the Lord cover the Earth as the waters do the Seas we as the Gentile bride part of our dispensation under the Millennium is the sons of God will be out teaching the millenn the heathen in the Millennium of our Lord Jesus the Jews the 144,000 which also receive the Holy Ghost will be out there in the Millennium teaching the Heathen remember heathens that's raised in the Millennium that never had the opportunity and we must teach them out of that Naomi will be restored to our position but you my friends are not Naomi you arose yes [Music] beloved it's B so Naomi the empty one is now full remember she said when they came from Moab she was bitter but now God has turned her bitterness into Joy the Jews which still don't understand to this day the Holocaust they don't understand all the deaths of their people and they're bitter they have resentment I don't know if you know it or not but there is a great population of the Jews around the world that do not even believe in God they are atheist they do not believe in God because they say how could there be a loving God and him allow their people to go through what they did they don't believe in God and they have such an attitude against God it was not God that did that they brought it on themselves but oh hang on naom me your joy will come back you'll find favor in his sight and Gentile Branch don't you be arrogant and proud in yourself it's the mercy of God given to us by which we could be accepted as his wife don't you love him tonight children you may struggle and wonder God why can't I bring forth just be faithful Sarah remember remember it was Rachel that went to Jacob and said give me children a I die give me children here I die he said am I God can I do that but it was like these women were consumed with it they're your type they knew they were supposed to be mothers they couldn't understand why would God delay it why would God let Hagar bring forth why would God let this one why would God let that one do you understand the 12 sons of Edom Esau every one of those 12 sons which become 12 tribal heads every one of them got their inheritance before any of Jacob's 12 sons did Esau's Sons didn't have to go to Egypt they didn't have to go to Babylon they were not beat by the whips of the Egyptians they were Edomite princes and they received Mighty kingdoms they didn't have to labor for it God just blessed them you hear it all the time people say oh Lord the Lord's blessed me the Lord's blessed me I know I must be in his will that shows how blind they are blessings don't mean you're in his will you can be out of the will of God a thousand miles away from the will of God and the blessing still fall on you they did the children of Israel their shoes never wore out and their clothes never wore out they never had to work or labor for 40 years for their food and Judgment of God was PR anounced upon them not a one of them made it in of that generation and yet the real tribe struggled and struggled it's always been that way how many would say God give me strength help me that I won't be weary Lord help me that I'll be like Sarah I'll continue I'll be like Rebecca I'll believe Lord yes Lord Lord Jesus I pray you'd forgive us father I'm sure that we're much like they were it's easy for me to see why Sarah would have believed she was not even part of your program you went for many years before you ever even spoke her name as being part of the Covenant it's easy for me to see as a human why she thought maybe Hagar would be the way cuz all of your blessings was pronounced to Abraham you was going to make him the father you said nothing about making her the mother you said one blessing after another after another to him only how what a struggle it must have been for how hard it must have been feeling like she was left out but one day the seals broke open and it was at that meeting when you met Abraham and said your name will no longer be Abram so you took the H out of your name and you divided his name Abram you cut his name in two and dropped the H down in the middle of his name and said you are called Abraham I'm big Elohim and you're little Elohim I give you the letter H and oh yeah when you go back home tell your wife she's no longer Seri I'm going to drop the ey and I'm going to cap her name the Capstone will be h s a r a h so finally Sarah receiv receives it part of the name of God oh I can't imagine how she must have felt in the tent that day when Abraham finally told her he talked about you today he talked about you glory to God father you talked about us tonight Glory you talked about me my brothers my sisters you talked about my wife my children my grandchildren my sheep you talked about us tonight Lord thank you thank you hallelujah hallelujah may we receive strength to conceive seed of malach malach Yahweh Malachi Yahweh hallelujah hallelujah

part in God's economy if God could take Tamar and remember God did not approve of the way she went about doing it God did not approve of the way that David and Batha bath sheba's situation was but God

thorns so my sisters wear it with Godly dignity and Thanksgiving in your heart Let Jesus use you there some curls hang down your back let him use you as you slip on that decent dress and you dress
