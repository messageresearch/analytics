[31:58] Corinthians chapter 1 if you would verse
[32:02] 5 I want to open this morning on our
[32:06] right to
[32:08] Fellowship our right to
[32:11] Fellowship First Corinthians chapter
[32:14] 1 verse
[32:16] 5 that in everything ye are
[32:20] enriched by Him in all utterance and in
[32:27] all knowledge now listen that in
[32:30] everything you are enriched and that is
[32:32] to give you Heavenly riches is what that
[32:35] means you are enriched by Him in all
[32:40] utterance what you speak and in all
[32:44] knowledge even as the
[32:46] testimony of Christ was
[32:50] confirmed in you so that you come behind
[32:55] in no gift waiting for the coming of our
[33:00] Lord Jesus
[33:02] Christ who shall also confirm you unto
[33:07] the end now this is what I want a double
[33:11] confirmation that you may be blameless
[33:14] in the day of our Lord Jesus
[33:18] Christ friends what in the world could
[33:21] we ask for that would be any greater
[33:24] than that to be blame blameless how is
[33:28] that even possible it's not impossible
[33:31] it's not possible brother without God
[33:33] helping a mortal which mortal among us
[33:36] today or any that's ever lived on the
[33:38] earth could ever stand on their own and
[33:41] say I am
[33:45] blameless but yet that he that ye may be
[33:49] blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus
[33:51] Christ and listen to this verse n God is
[33:55] faithful by whom whom ye were
[34:00] called unto the
[34:03] fellowship of his son Jesus Christ Our
[34:09] Lord listen again God is faithful by
[34:13] whom ye were
[34:16] called unto the fellowship of his
[34:20] son Jesus Christ Our Lord let's bow our
[34:24] hands
[34:25] together
[34:29] truly Lord Jesus these words are
[34:34] awesome how many hearts have they
[34:36] touched down Through the Ages since Paul
[34:39] wrote it to the church at Corinth so
[34:41] many years
[34:42] ago and here we stand
[34:45] today all these centuries
[34:48] later and we believe this with all of
[34:51] our hearts that we also have been called
[34:55] to the fellowship
[34:57] of your son Christ Jesus our
[35:02] lord I pray you would open our
[35:04] understanding as we Endeavor to look
[35:06] into the word today and see more of what
[35:09] you have purchased for us as your people
[35:13] bless us together father we ask in the
[35:16] name of the Lord Jesus and the Saints
[35:18] said am God bless you may be
[35:25] seated
[35:28] what a
[35:30] privilege to be called unto the
[35:35] fellowship of his son Jesus Christ Our
[35:40] Lord we know there's something about us
[35:43] as human beings that we we need
[35:46] Fellowship some people need it more than
[35:48] others of course some people like it
[35:50] more than others but we all need
[35:55] Fellowship it's something about us
[35:58] coming together even to eat brother
[36:01] brandom had a real insight actually I
[36:03] was reading it this week where he's
[36:04] talking about how that when people would
[36:07] come together that there was something
[36:09] about them coming together and eating
[36:12] that produced a real Fellowship that
[36:16] they would just get together and they
[36:18] would eat and then they would begin
[36:21] talking and fellowshipping and enjoying
[36:24] one another's company and that would be
[36:28] something within itself to be called
[36:31] into the fellowship of a great person
[36:35] most of us probably have had very few
[36:38] great people as far as the world would
[36:40] call great that we've ever been invited
[36:43] to their house that we've ever been
[36:45] invited to their table president vice
[36:49] president mayor Governor whoever it
[36:51] would be and yet for the people of the
[36:54] world to be identified in that and
[36:57] called well you've got an invitation to
[36:59] the governor's house and you've got one
[37:01] here and you've got one there you now
[37:03] most of us would be well we're going to
[37:05] let everybody and their brother know it
[37:07] I've been invited down to Mar Lago oh
[37:10] I've been invited to the White House
[37:12] I've been invited here and there and
[37:14] there and yet we have been invited to
[37:19] the personal fellowship with Jesus
[37:23] Christ the son of
[37:25] God
[37:27] and how is it that people with that
[37:30] invitation many of them never accept it
[37:33] they're not even interested
[37:35] whatsoever and some of those who say
[37:38] they are invited and say that they have
[37:41] accepted the
[37:42] invitation they still don't give him
[37:44] much personal Fellowship this is what
[37:48] they relate to fellowship with Jesus
[37:51] Christ the son of God church only so
[37:55] when they're in use Services we'll say
[37:57] or special meetings or uh twice a week
[38:01] whatever it is then they consider that
[38:03] Fellowship they're having fellowship
[38:06] with Christ Jesus well in one sense the
[38:08] word that is true but in this setting
[38:11] it's not just with the Lord Jesus that
[38:13] we're having Fellowship but we're having
[38:15] fellowship with one another but I want
[38:17] you to notice the way that Paul writes
[38:19] this he does not say that you're invited
[38:22] to the fellowship with Jesus Christ and
[38:25] his children
[38:27] but he says with Jesus Christ Our
[38:31] Lord self Fellowship personal Fellowship
[38:35] like this one on-one can be sometimes
[38:39] the most difficult Fellowship that
[38:41] Christians have a hard time relating to
[38:45] with the Lord Jesus and it's almost like
[38:48] they feel comfortable in his presence
[38:52] when they in him are amongst other
[38:56] people
[38:57] but they feel really really nervous with
[39:00] just Him and them alone and I understand
[39:05] that feeling I feel that way sometimes
[39:07] myself in his presence especially
[39:09] whenever it's so awesome and you're by
[39:12] yourself and there's just something
[39:14] about it it can be almost overwhelming
[39:18] to you it's quite intimidated to be in
[39:21] the presence of God Alone by yourself I
[39:25] mean that's what I'm talking about
[39:26] whenever you just get in that presence
[39:29] and there's no one else there but you
[39:31] and him there's something about it when
[39:33] we're together and you're in that
[39:35] presence and hundreds of others are
[39:37] there in that presence too and it seems
[39:39] like it doesn't bother us near as much
[39:42] but whenever we're by ourself and it's
[39:45] just us and him alone you ever go there
[39:48] to have fellowship with him and it seems
[39:50] like I have a hard time knowing what to
[39:52] say and how to approach him I'm not just
[39:55] talking at with your list you know all
[39:57] of our want list and all of our prayer
[40:00] requests and all of that that's not
[40:02] really Fellowship that's just making
[40:04] your request known to the Lord but
[40:07] whenever you change gears and you move
[40:10] from being able to bring your needs to
[40:13] the Lord and he wants us to do that and
[40:15] that whenever we are just fellowshipping
[40:18] with him so if you were sitting talking
[40:21] to your husband your wife son or
[40:22] daughter brother sister in the church
[40:25] and you was constantly asking them hey
[40:27] I've been meaning to ask you could I
[40:28] borrow $100 uh my car is tore up could I
[40:31] borrow your car and my tractor is tore
[40:34] up could I borrow your tractor my
[40:35] lawnmower is tore up could I borrow that
[40:37] I don't want your toothbrush don't worry
[40:39] about that I don't want your toothbrush
[40:40] but what about your mixer could I borrow
[40:42] your mixer and what about this and you
[40:44] say my goodness is that all you want
[40:47] from me you just constantly want things
[40:50] from me I I thought you loved me as a
[40:54] person and you wanted to be around me
[40:56] and you just enjoy talking to me well I
[40:59] wonder how sometimes that it makes the
[41:01] Lord feel whenever most of our prayers
[41:05] consist of our list so we have this list
[41:08] and that list and another list and when
[41:10] it really comes to just fellowshipping
[41:12] with him just talking to him and telling
[41:15] him how much you love him and what all
[41:16] he's done for you and what he means to
[41:19] you and how you can't wait to see him
[41:21] and you can't wait to be in his presence
[41:24] then you're really entering in to a
[41:27] place of Fellowship I I I personally
[41:29] believe this is more of what Paul was
[41:32] describing than he was our prayer list
[41:35] and our many needs and our many desires
[41:38] that it was actually a place that a
[41:40] person had been called into that
[41:43] personal intimate fellowship with the
[41:46] Lord Jesus I I've been privileged by the
[41:48] grace of God to be friends of many great
[41:51] preachers down through the decades that
[41:53] I've been a preacher myself and I count
[41:56] of a great honor to be friends of Great
[41:58] Men and I know that you know many of
[42:01] those friends and many of you are
[42:03] friends with them but in one way I have
[42:06] an advantage in that I have intimate
[42:10] fellowship with them so I can talk with
[42:13] them about what I'm going through they
[42:15] can talk with me about what they're
[42:17] going through and more than likely they
[42:19] would never do that with you they would
[42:21] because as lay members they just
[42:22] wouldn't do it but as preachers we have
[42:25] to have preachers on also that we can
[42:27] talk to and relate to and we can be able
[42:30] to discuss things and try to understand
[42:33] things and so we have that close
[42:36] fellowship and you know the Lord he has
[42:38] fellowship with the church he has
[42:41] fellowship with foolish virgins he has
[42:45] fellowship and will have fellowship with
[42:48] the
[42:49] 144,000 there would be people in the
[42:52] economy of God that will be allowed to
[42:55] come into the Great city of God walk
[42:58] down streets of gold but they will not
[43:00] be allowed to live there so they will
[43:02] come from time to time from New Moon
[43:05] Sabbath and so on and they will come and
[43:08] bring an offering unto the Lord but they
[43:10] will not be allowed to live in that City
[43:14] because the city is actually built for
[43:17] those who were called for close intimate
[43:21] Fellowship you see your walk on the
[43:23] earth actually reflects what where and
[43:27] how close you will live to him in the
[43:29] eighth day so it's not just that we will
[43:33] have this close intimate Fellowship here
[43:36] and then whenever we get there we get to
[43:38] go see him oh say once a year or
[43:40] something like that if there's anything
[43:41] like years there or we will get to go
[43:44] every now and then but depending on what
[43:47] you were called to do and how you're
[43:49] called to fellowship with him here in
[43:51] this life you're actually living out
[43:54] your future home right now
[43:56] so for those who really don't need that
[43:59] intimate fellowship with the Lord Jesus
[44:02] I mean they can go to church once a year
[44:03] you know that they talk to him once once
[44:05] every now and then and that they mainly
[44:07] he's just like a Sears and robu catalog
[44:10] house so they just going I need this I
[44:12] want that I want that I want I need I
[44:14] need I need I want I want but I I myself
[44:17] I like going to him with no request and
[44:21] I know that's hard to do in this day
[44:23] isn't it it's hard to go to where you
[44:25] just say what I've got this and that but
[44:27] there's times I go to him I do it on
[44:30] purpose I ask him for
[44:34] nothing I do not ask him for myself or
[44:38] for anyone else I go simply just to talk
[44:43] to him simply to be in his presence and
[44:48] for wait to him to speak back to me now
[44:53] maybe you don't understand where I'm
[44:54] coming from but I just desire to know
[44:57] him in a way in an intimate way of more
[45:03] than just him being this Almighty all
[45:06] powerful God that one day I'm going to
[45:09] meet and this distant sort of thing that
[45:12] he and I would have no I'm sorry I
[45:15] cannot handle that I've never had that
[45:18] walk with God and I sure don't want it
[45:20] now I want to know him in a way that I
[45:24] have never even known KN him before how
[45:27] many understand what I'm saying now as
[45:29] far as knowing him as Savior I know that
[45:32] knowing him as healer I know that but so
[45:35] do many others so do many others know
[45:37] him as saving them from sin but somehow
[45:40] another I feel I'm called to have
[45:44] something with him that is more than
[45:48] savior more than Redeemer notice this
[45:52] the prophet says in the beginning when
[45:54] man used to walk walk in the early age
[45:57] with God in the Garden of Eden when the
[46:01] first Man was created in the great
[46:04] Cathedrals Under The Palms he and his
[46:07] wife when the cool of the evening come
[46:10] along they came out and they worshiped
[46:14] God and they had a perfect Fellowship
[46:17] now listen what God actually wants we
[46:20] talk so much about what we want but
[46:23] let's see what God wants wants from
[46:27] people not from
[46:29] everyone I trust from
[46:32] us listen what God wants God
[46:37] Longs for
[46:39] Fellowship he
[46:42] yearns now listen to these words he
[46:45] Longs he
[46:47] yearns he
[46:49] wants who could ever imagine the
[46:52] almighty the Eternal long longing for
[46:57] anything that he himself could not
[47:01] provide yearning for something that he
[47:06] himself cannot provide wanting something
[47:11] that he himself he wanted a universe he
[47:14] made it he wanted trillions of planets
[47:18] he made
[47:20] them he wanted a multitudes of stars he
[47:24] made them he wanted angels He made
[47:28] them but he Longs for
[47:31] Fellowship but he didn't make just
[47:34] create Fellowship I'll just create
[47:37] fellowship and then I'll have it he
[47:40] Longs for something that only human
[47:45] beings can give
[47:47] it and if we don't give it to him he
[47:51] will never have
[47:53] it can you imagine the the Eternal
[47:57] putting himself in such a can I say it
[48:00] this way
[48:02] vulnerable
[48:03] position that he would bring himself to
[48:07] this spot to know that I want
[48:11] something that only
[48:13] humans can give me when humans are so
[48:17] frail they're so faithless they're so up
[48:21] and down and in and out and one day
[48:24] they're good and the next day they're
[48:25] not and one day they're faithful and the
[48:27] next day they're not and he would
[48:29] subject himself to wanting something not
[48:33] Angels now Angels would do it and gladly
[48:36] do
[48:37] so but he took this from
[48:41] Angels
[48:45] wormwood
[48:47] Michael I know you would give me this if
[48:50] I ask you for
[48:52] it you have been faithful since I
[48:54] created you aons of Ages
[48:59] ago but I yearn for
[49:01] something that you cannot give me
[49:04] Gabriel I yearn for something wormwood
[49:08] that you cannot give
[49:10] me I yearn for something
[49:14] Ariel that you cannot bestow to
[49:17] me what is it
[49:20] father what is
[49:23] it Fellowship
[49:29] love
[49:32] adoration I want to be
[49:37] adored I want to be loved by beings that
[49:41] will do it not because I make
[49:44] them but because I simply ask
[49:50] them God help
[49:54] us
[49:56] notice the prophet said God Longs for
[49:58] Fellowship he
[49:59] yearns listen what he wants us to
[50:03] do he wants
[50:06] people to speak with
[50:11] him to talk with
[50:14] him is that too much for
[50:19] us is that him asking too much brother
[50:24] Nathan that God would just want you to
[50:27] go around every day and say
[50:29] papa have I told you yet today how much
[50:32] I love
[50:33] you I just want you to know you mean
[50:36] everything to
[50:39] me you imagine the Angels there with all
[50:42] the finishing touches around the city
[50:44] and all that they're doing and papa says
[50:46] everybody
[50:47] stop everybody
[50:50] hush while I listen to my
[50:53] daughter as she Whispers love secrets to
[50:57] me listen at her listen at
[51:01] her oh from that heart that I redeemed
[51:05] from that soul that I
[51:07] purged she is pouring out the
[51:11] essence of something that you Angels
[51:14] cannot
[51:18] give you might sing too much you might
[51:20] preach too much sometime there's one
[51:23] thing you'll never be able to overdo
[51:26] that's pray the Bible said I would that
[51:29] men would pray
[51:31] everywhere lifting up holy hands you'll
[51:36] never be able to have too much
[51:39] fellowship with
[51:41] God God
[51:43] Longs for his
[51:45] creature who created in His
[51:49] image to fellowship with him but brother
[51:53] Donnie what what do I do do how do I do
[51:58] well how do you young people fellowship
[51:59] with one
[52:00] another you text you WhatsApp you zoom
[52:05] you do all these things you talk and
[52:09] when you get together and you hang
[52:10] together hang around together after
[52:12] service and you go eat and you have your
[52:14] meals together and you
[52:17] laugh and you cut
[52:19] up and you
[52:21] talk and is that enough for you uhuh
[52:26] some of y'all you're going to go eat
[52:27] after service you're going to come right
[52:30] back over here in this Fellowship Hall
[52:32] that we provided for you and some of you
[52:35] will be there till 8:00 9:00
[52:39] tonight still
[52:42] fellowshipping still talking to one
[52:45] another because you enjoy being around
[52:49] one
[52:51] another I wonder how many days we make
[52:56] Jesus so
[53:00] lonesome anybody ever felt
[53:04] Lonesome you just feel Lonesome you just
[53:06] feel Lonesome you know what what I'm
[53:09] saying that there's times you can be
[53:11] around all kinds of people and still
[53:13] feel Lonesome because the combati
[53:16] ability issue is just you know people's
[53:18] doing this or that or the other and you
[53:20] just don't enjoy doing that sort of
[53:22] thing and you you try to talk and they
[53:24] don't want to talk to you and you just
[53:25] feel so
[53:27] alone can you imagine in an Earth with a
[53:30] population of 7 billion people on the
[53:32] Earth and I wonder how many of them
[53:35] every day they get up and they are
[53:37] making it part of their main goal and
[53:39] purpose to Fellowship
[53:42] personally with almighty
[53:46] God to talk to him to love him to let
[53:49] him know he is their
[53:51] everything they're waiting for the day
[53:54] when he is going to
[53:56] come gather them together he Longs for
[54:00] them to speak to him oh he said when I
[54:02] get there brother dony I want to he
[54:04] don't want you to wait till that
[54:06] long at your service today I pray that
[54:09] we leave this place and we look at our
[54:12] fellowship with God in a way that we
[54:14] never have
[54:16] before think of the moments that we
[54:19] spend with a crazy phone in our
[54:23] hand on Instagram and Tik Tok and
[54:27] looking at this and looking at that how
[54:30] many of you people sat with these deals
[54:32] in your hands and you're playing video
[54:35] games and going through all kinds of
[54:38] foolishness just absolute foolishness a
[54:41] waste of
[54:43] time and do you even give God five
[54:48] minutes five minutes not of
[54:52] asking of fellowshipping
[54:56] or
[54:58] fellowshipping how are you
[55:01] Jesus I love
[55:03] you I haven't told you enough today I
[55:07] just want to let you know you mean
[55:09] everything to
[55:11] me I know I say it a lot to you but
[55:14] truly you are my bride and Morning Star
[55:17] you're the lily of my valleys you help
[55:20] me when I'm down and when I'm
[55:23] weary you said brother dony how could
[55:26] that mean anything to
[55:29] him it's the way he chose to do
[55:34] it now we live in the south thank
[55:40] God all you Yankees can have the north
[55:43] as far as I'm
[55:45] concerned but you know you go through
[55:46] the drivethru hello honey Hello darling
[55:50] hello sweetheart well that little
[55:51] sweetheart right there don't like him
[55:53] women at the drivethru calling her swe

[56:02] you buddy a lot of them people ain't
[56:04] your buddy and they ain't my buddy but

[56:16] say thank you I mean it's like you got
[56:18] to pull you're pulling teeth to get a
[56:20] thank you out of
[56:22] them but can you imagine God yearning
[56:25] how many's ever yearned for something
[56:28] and longed for
[56:30] it I wonder how many days of my 67
[56:37] years that God has
[56:39] yearned
[56:41] yearned to hear from me
[56:47] more than he
[56:50] did and at the end of the
[56:53] day
[56:55] I disappointed
[57:00] him when I laid down and the last one I
[57:03] spoke to was
[57:05] him the first one I speak to when I wake
[57:09] up but I could have give him so much
[57:12] more time and he yearned and he was like
[57:17] waiting
[57:21] Donnie Donnie Smith
[57:27] Jonathan as
[57:29] you
[57:32] Rob got any time for
[57:35] me just personal
[57:37] time not asking
[57:44] stuff you'll never be able to have too
[57:46] much fellowship with
[57:48] God God Longs for his
[57:52] creature who he created in His image
[57:55] to fellowship with him wouldn't you have
[57:57] loved to live in that time when the
[58:00] Great Fellowship God had with Adam and
[58:02] Eve in the Garden of Eden to come down
[58:04] in the cool of the evening and talk with
[58:06] them and fellowship with him wouldn't
[58:08] that be
[58:10] marvelous we would all like to have that
[58:13] time now I Believe by God's word I can
[58:15] prove to you when we come right back on
[58:18] them terms again with God tonight right
[58:21] straight back to that kind of a
[58:25] Fellowship so I want you to think what
[58:28] are we going to do when we get to heaven
[58:32] I think of it no grocery stores no
[58:35] Walmarts no TJ Maxx no gabes no
[58:39] malls no football games no baseball
[58:43] games no soccer no TV so a lot of the
[58:47] things that we occupy our time with they
[58:50] won't even be there no airplanes no
[58:53] vacations cuz it is one great big
[58:58] vacation so think of it what are we
[59:01] going to
[59:02] do and not be bored some of you cannot
[59:06] set 15
[59:09] minutes I watch people in a doctor's
[59:11] office and I watch people I'm just an
[59:13] observer people can hardly set for five
[59:17] minutes I've timed them without getting
[59:20] their phone out of their
[59:23] pocket how many people people do you
[59:25] ever sit and watch and just notice as
[59:28] they think and just meditate in this day
[59:31] we're living people can't hard to do it
[59:34] they cannot hardly do it the attention
[59:36] span has so dropped since people started
[59:40] watching television and movies years ago
[59:44] they could hold your eyes on the exact
[59:46] same scene in a movie for 10 times
[59:50] longer than what they can now but the
[59:53] attention span of people is so fast and
[59:57] gets away from them they have to
[59:58] constantly change the scenes in order to
[1:00:01] keep people's
[1:00:03] attention it's sad to say it's the same
[1:00:05] way in church it's the same way when it
[1:00:08] comes to reading the Bible the same way
[1:00:11] with listen to tapes the same way with
[1:00:13] reading a message book we've got to be
[1:00:16] going doing here there there there and
[1:00:20] we don't realize our attention span for
[1:00:23] God is getting less and less and
[1:00:28] less I wonder how many of us don't raise
[1:00:31] your hand but
[1:00:36] meditate I wonder how many of us
[1:00:38] children of God meditate Brother Don
[1:00:41] that's crazy no actually the Bible tells
[1:00:43] you to do it to meditate on him and
[1:00:47] think on him just lay your phone down
[1:00:52] brother Fred and sister B Mullen
[1:00:55] my dear precious friends they've got a a
[1:00:59] rule in their house so when the kids the
[1:01:04] grandkids when all of them come in
[1:01:06] they've got a basket sitting on the
[1:01:09] bar it is a
[1:01:12] deposit for everybody's cell
[1:01:15] phone now I know some of you is going to
[1:01:17] Pooch your lip at and you're going to
[1:01:18] get real quiet on me some of y'all is
[1:01:20] just as addicted to your cell phone as a
[1:01:23] drunk is to alcohol
[1:01:25] and you can't stand it without having
[1:01:27] that thing in your hand you've got a
[1:01:29] ding for this and a ping for that and
[1:01:32] this for that you got 47 notifications
[1:01:35] and you know what every one of them are
[1:01:37] and you cannot hardly stand it if one of
[1:01:40] them things goes off and you don't pick
[1:01:42] it up and look at it and Jesus is
[1:01:45] dinging and
[1:01:46] knocking and pulling and
[1:01:50] longing and
[1:01:53] begging and we don't even
[1:01:57] answer behold I stand at the
[1:02:02] door and
[1:02:04] no and if any man will open unto me I
[1:02:07] will come unto him and Su you know what
[1:02:11] that means it's short for
[1:02:15] supper Jesus wants to have
[1:02:20] supper with
[1:02:22] you and breakfast and your 10:00 snack
[1:02:26] and your 11:15 snack and your 11:55
[1:02:29] snack and then your 12:00
[1:02:32] lunch he wants to be such a part of our
[1:02:36] Lives you said brother T why are you
[1:02:38] telling this this believe it or not I'm
[1:02:41] trying to get you ready for the
[1:02:46] Rapture I think when the Rapture comes
[1:02:49] all it simply does is takes our
[1:02:52] soul changes us from within and if we're
[1:02:56] alive gives us a body which matches our
[1:02:58] soul and we will take our current
[1:03:02] status
[1:03:04] straight to heaven thank Lord so for
[1:03:08] bored and going to church bored and
[1:03:09] singing bored in praying bored in
[1:03:12] worshiping bored in
[1:03:14] fellowshipping what are we going to do
[1:03:16] when we get to the marriage
[1:03:19] supper AT&T ain't there Verizon ain't
[1:03:23] there WhatsApp ain't allowed at Jesus
[1:03:27] table so what in the world are we going
[1:03:29] to do what are we going to do we're
[1:03:33] going to worship we're going to praise
[1:03:35] we're going to adore now think of it
[1:03:37] when we've been there for
[1:03:41] 135 trillion years we've no less days to
[1:03:46] sing his praise than when we first begun
[1:03:50] how what in the world is going to occupy
[1:03:53] all of our time him it will take
[1:03:58] Eternity for him to still be unveiling
[1:04:02] who he is and what he is and how great
[1:04:05] he is and how great his love is for us
[1:04:08] so if you get bored hearing about him
[1:04:11] you don't want to go to heaven my
[1:04:14] friend notice this Paul goes on to say
[1:04:18] let me read the latter part of this I
[1:04:21] skipped one I'm sorry dedication of the
[1:04:22] building to the Lord in Cleveland 19 U
[1:04:25] 59 he said then being the Church of God
[1:04:28] God ordained a certain place for these
[1:04:30] people to meet and were they would be
[1:04:34] Fellowship because God longs to
[1:04:38] fellowship with his people and
[1:04:42] among his
[1:04:44] people I wonder when he showed up at
[1:04:47] church this
[1:04:49] morning what he had on his
[1:04:53] heart I wonder what Jesus wants to make
[1:04:57] this service for us
[1:05:00] today it's not about what I think the
[1:05:02] service should be and it's not about
[1:05:04] what you think it should be it's about
[1:05:07] what he wants it to be
[1:05:09] right so he showed up here this
[1:05:13] morning to have
[1:05:15] fellowship and to be among us that we
[1:05:19] also could Fellowship back to
[1:05:23] him now the fellowship varies according
[1:05:26] to what part of the service that we're
[1:05:28] in so whenever the service starts and
[1:05:31] then we start with the prayer requests
[1:05:32] and things like that and then we go to
[1:05:34] singing and then we're entering into
[1:05:37] praise and worship and singing
[1:05:40] songs then we will hear the prayer
[1:05:43] request someone will come up and pray
[1:05:45] and then we might sing another song and
[1:05:47] then we'll have some special
[1:05:50] songs and each one of those things will
[1:05:53] open up a different opportunity for you
[1:05:57] to be able to squeeze in this little
[1:06:00] private time with you and the Lord then
[1:06:03] when it comes time for the word what do
[1:06:05] we do preacher gets up reads the text
[1:06:07] goes to L out what God's put on his
[1:06:10] heart well when know most generally
[1:06:12] during that time it's not their perp
[1:06:14] time for everybody to be up running
[1:06:16] around jumping hollering shouting while
[1:06:19] the word's going forth is that right but
[1:06:21] yet you have a time while the word is is
[1:06:24] going force to be able to say thank you
[1:06:26] Jesus Lord that's what I need thank you
[1:06:29] for your word Lord anoint a man of God
[1:06:32] father give me what I need help me Lord
[1:06:35] you see every part of the service should
[1:06:38] be an opportunity to where we can enter
[1:06:41] into Fellowship now whenever I'll close
[1:06:44] here shortly then I I'll I'll offer
[1:06:47] prayer maybe somebody's got a need we'll
[1:06:49] offer prayer for them we'll start
[1:06:51] singing together again to worship the
[1:06:54] Lord what for to give you a time to
[1:06:57] where we can recreate our own personal
[1:07:01] little Garden of
[1:07:03] Eden when I enter these doors I'm not
[1:07:06] sure what you think about when you come
[1:07:09] in I want this to be as close to Eden as
[1:07:14] it can possibly be in this life before
[1:07:18] the
[1:07:19] restoration to where when Papa comes
[1:07:22] down and he he says my
[1:07:25] children how was your stay on Earth
[1:07:29] today now we could start at the top and
[1:07:32] give all of our complaining list and all
[1:07:35] of our griping list well it wasn't good
[1:07:37] at church it wasn't good at work it
[1:07:39] wasn't good at school and this wasn't
[1:07:41] good and that wasn't good and I'll agree
[1:07:42] there's a lot of things in this world
[1:07:44] that ain't good but if you spend all
[1:07:46] your time looking for what ain't good
[1:07:48] you ain't going to find no time to look
[1:07:50] for what is good we got trouble we got
[1:07:53] heartache we got all kinds of things to
[1:07:54] deal with but every person into this
[1:07:57] building today has got so much to thank
[1:08:00] him for you're alive aren't you you've
[1:08:02] got hands where you can raise up a voice
[1:08:05] you can talk you've got feet to be able
[1:08:07] to walk you've got something that God's
[1:08:09] done for you has all of us got something
[1:08:12] to praise God
[1:08:22] for
[1:08:24] oh Paul says God is faithful by whom you
[1:08:29] were called unto the
[1:08:32] fellowship of his son Jesus Christ Our
[1:08:35] Lord Ephesians 3:9 to make all men see
[1:08:39] what is the Fellowship of the mystery
[1:08:42] which from the beginning of the world
[1:08:46] has been hid in God who created All
[1:08:49] Things by Christ Jesus so Paul
[1:08:51] identifies that there had been a a
[1:08:54] dispensational change with the preaching
[1:08:57] of the
[1:08:58] Cross and it had been hid in God and he
[1:09:02] identified it in these terms here The
[1:09:06] Fellowship of the mystery so there is a
[1:09:10] fellowship then of the mystery now the
[1:09:13] Greek word here is
[1:09:15] Mysterion it is something that is made
[1:09:18] known only to the
[1:09:22] initiated we in one sense Are Spiritual
[1:09:27] Mystics because something has been made
[1:09:30] known to us it's not made known to
[1:09:33] everyone not made known to The Sinner oh
[1:09:36] they hear about the cross and they hear
[1:09:38] about the blood but the mystery has not
[1:09:40] been personally made known to them once
[1:09:43] the mystery comes open that he died for
[1:09:46] you that he has redeemed you that birs
[1:09:50] you into the mystery of the fellowship
[1:09:53] ship so then it is more than a head
[1:09:57] knowledge oh yeah I know about the cross
[1:09:58] I know about the blood I know about all
[1:10:00] that I know about all that it shows by
[1:10:02] your attitude you know very little about
[1:10:04] it because you don't just know it by
[1:10:08] understanding notice again in 1 John 1:3
[1:10:12] that which we have seen and heard
[1:10:14] declare we unto you that ye Also may
[1:10:18] have fellowship with us truly our
[1:10:21] fellowship is with the father and with
[1:10:26] his son Jesus Christ how in the world
[1:10:29] could John be able to project that human
[1:10:33] beings could have fellowship with God in
[1:10:36] the same way they have fellowship with
[1:10:39] one another and God's in another
[1:10:41] dimension God in this great place called
[1:10:44] Heaven notice again he says 1 John 1:6
[1:10:49] if we say then that we have fellowship
[1:10:52] with him and we walk in darkness we do
[1:10:57] lie we lie rather and do not the truth
[1:11:00] now so the people who say today oh I'm
[1:11:04] saved I'm a Christian and I have
[1:11:06] fellowship with God if they walk in
[1:11:09] darkness they are not telling the truth
[1:11:13] so you see whenever we walk in
[1:11:15] fellowship with him we must walk in the
[1:11:19] light as he is in the light and we have
[1:11:22] Fellowship one with another and the
[1:11:25] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth
[1:11:28] us from all sin if you notice the
[1:11:30] setting of John when he write said he's
[1:11:32] not talking about just us fellowshipping
[1:11:34] with one another but we're walking in
[1:11:36] fellowship with him you see the
[1:11:39] fellowship that Abraham had with God
[1:11:42] whenever God was able to try him and God
[1:11:46] was able to try job and the prophet
[1:11:48] tells us the reason that God had
[1:11:51] confidence in job was because him and
[1:11:55] job had been
[1:12:00] fellowshipping fellowshipping yes sir
[1:12:03] and no doubt there's people here today
[1:12:05] and you have close friends in our church
[1:12:08] and you may know things about them that
[1:12:11] no one else knows you may know
[1:12:13] weaknesses cuz they confide in you what
[1:12:16] is that Fellowship we've all of course
[1:12:19] been betrayed by people that we felt
[1:12:21] like we could confine in and they went
[1:12:24] and told it ain't that right but we know
[1:12:27] that there are true friends that don't
[1:12:29] do such a thing and God and job had been
[1:12:35] fellowshipping job was unaware of the
[1:12:37] testimony service that been held in
[1:12:39] heaven and in this testimony meeting it
[1:12:42] was God testifying about his
[1:12:45] servant it's something when we testify
[1:12:48] of God it's another thing when God
[1:12:50] testifies of us so in the testimony
[1:12:53] meeting in heaven God had told the devil
[1:12:55] said hey you considered my servant job
[1:12:58] there ain't a man like him and all the
[1:12:59] Earth the devil said well of course you
[1:13:01] baby him you give him this you give him
[1:13:03] that you do this at the other forign but
[1:13:05] you let me touch him I'll tell you one
[1:13:07] thing I'll make him deny you to your
[1:13:09] face I'll make him curse you I'll do
[1:13:12] this and that and the other and God said
[1:13:13] you can't do it ain't no way no you
[1:13:15] can't do it how in the world could God
[1:13:18] be so confident because him and job was
[1:13:22] buddies him and job had such Fellowship
[1:13:26] together that God knew him can God say
[1:13:29] about
[1:13:31] you he is my buddy she is my friend I
[1:13:38] know her so well I know her I know him
[1:13:44] we have Fellowship
[1:13:47] daily praise God anybody hearing me
[1:13:51] today 1 John 1 seven but if we walk in
[1:13:55] the light as he is in the light
[1:13:58] notice not as he is the
[1:14:02] light but as he is in the light if we
[1:14:06] walk with him fellowship with him as he
[1:14:10] is in the light you've got to catch him
[1:14:14] in the right light in order to have the
[1:14:17] right of Fellowship brother Melvin he
[1:14:20] must be in the light of the season and
[1:14:23] he is you can't fellowship with him in
[1:14:26] this hour under the light of Luther's
[1:14:30] Reformation that was the light of that
[1:14:33] day come on somebody you can't
[1:14:35] fellowship with him in the light of him
[1:14:37] under methodism that was a great move of
[1:14:40] God but we're not living in that age no
[1:14:43] more we must come to where he is we must
[1:14:46] find him in the light and there we can
[1:14:52] Fellowship oh oh praise God if we walk
[1:14:56] in the light as he is in the light we
[1:14:59] have Fellowship one with another and the
[1:15:02] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth
[1:15:05] us from all
[1:15:08] sin oh how God
[1:15:11] longs to
[1:15:14] Fellowship praise the
[1:15:17] Lord I don't mind telling you there's an
[1:15:19] element of God that I
[1:15:22] fear the there's things about God's
[1:15:26] presence that alarms me as a
[1:15:29] human I've sensed him since I was a
[1:15:32] little
[1:15:33] boy I've heard him speak to me many
[1:15:36] times I've even heard him audibly a few
[1:15:39] times it's never happened to me that it
[1:15:42] does not terrify
[1:15:44] me and people think
[1:15:47] blessings is God's glory and yet the
[1:15:51] prophet tells us every time the angel
[1:15:53] comes come to him it would leave him
[1:15:55] numn and create this element of fear
[1:15:59] remember when Daniel saw him he fell at
[1:16:01] his feet was sick for many days John
[1:16:05] said when he laid his right hand on me
[1:16:08] he said that he passed out remember that
[1:16:12] book of Revelation chapter 1 so there's
[1:16:15] something about the presence of God that
[1:16:18] can seem
[1:16:20] unapproachable an element of the Devine
[1:16:23] mind that it would cause human beings to
[1:16:26] tremble of course your mind's running
[1:16:28] through all different scriptures in the
[1:16:29] Bible especially in the Old Testament
[1:16:31] when they would come into the courts of
[1:16:33] the presence of God and they would
[1:16:35] tremble and shake the people of Israel
[1:16:37] saw the Mountain of God as it trembled
[1:16:40] and Shook and they said don't let God
[1:16:42] speak to us God said I will raise them
[1:16:44] up a prophet so there is an element of
[1:16:48] God's presence that can be very fearful
[1:16:52] and scary but remember God will never
[1:16:55] bring you into the court of his divine
[1:16:59] presence beyond what you are capable of
[1:17:03] relating to so he will allow you to come
[1:17:07] into His courts and into his presence to
[1:17:11] the degree to match your call and your
[1:17:15] position in him I would never be able to
[1:17:18] go where the prophets did I would never
[1:17:20] be able to go where John was I'd never
[1:17:22] be able ago no doubt where Paul did is
[1:17:25] that right and no doubt many of you
[1:17:26] would not because I'm not made thus so I
[1:17:30] I don't have that fear but I know in my
[1:17:34] own personal boundary with God that
[1:17:36] there is that that line that that
[1:17:40] narrow escape to where I come into His
[1:17:43] presence and I sense him come near and
[1:17:47] and it it it alarms me
[1:17:51] oh I'm alarmed about it right now just
[1:17:53] talking about it because there's
[1:17:56] something about him that is so
[1:18:00] overwhelming to us
[1:18:02] Mortals but I'm longing for the day when
[1:18:06] that will be lifted from me because Adam
[1:18:11] never experienced that Adam never felt
[1:18:15] that when God come down every day in the
[1:18:17] cool of the day he never felt alarm he
[1:18:21] never felt fear he never felt what we
[1:18:24] would feel when we come deeply into his
[1:18:27] presence it was just this welcoming
[1:18:30] something and the same day it was over
[1:18:33] and over and over again and father would
[1:18:36] say children I've come down to kiss you
[1:18:39] good
[1:18:41] night and he would lay Adam down and lay
[1:18:45] Eve on his arm as he would stretch his
[1:18:47] arm out to be her
[1:18:50] pillow and he would stoop down and kiss
[1:18:53] Adam as it were good night and Eve good
[1:18:56] night and say good night my children
[1:19:00] Papa's come down to tuck you
[1:19:04] in I'll see you in the morning when you
[1:19:07] get
[1:19:08] up they didn't have to lock the door
[1:19:12] they had no doors to lock they didn't
[1:19:15] have to set their security system there
[1:19:18] was no security
[1:19:20] system the night did not do to them what
[1:19:24] the night does to us there's something
[1:19:27] about the night that can be frightening
[1:19:29] is that right the night
[1:19:32] sounds I'll never forget as I was in
[1:19:35] Zimbabwe several years ago there in some
[1:19:38] meetings and I was able to go on a on a
[1:19:40] safari a hunt while I was
[1:19:43] there and the guy told me he said now
[1:19:46] you're going to stay in this little
[1:19:47] thing it was a little round sort of a
[1:19:49] structure not very big oh I don't I
[1:19:52] don't know say say 12 14 fet maybe
[1:19:55] something like that built like like a
[1:19:58] circle and he said now we've got a
[1:20:00] leopard that's out here roaming around
[1:20:02] at
[1:20:03] night and you may hear
[1:20:06] it but just don't go
[1:20:09] outside I thought are you kidding me I
[1:20:11] ain't darkening out this
[1:20:14] door I might have been born in the
[1:20:16] morning but it wasn't this
[1:20:18] morning so sure enough in the night I
[1:20:21] was awakened by this Str strange and
[1:20:23] peculiar sound that I'd never heard now
[1:20:26] the African night as the sun goes to set
[1:20:29] the baboons go to making their noises
[1:20:31] and all the rest of the animals which
[1:20:34] I'm not aware of our brother and sister
[1:20:35] here and sister hope from Kenya they
[1:20:37] could tell you about it so I I heard
[1:20:40] this peculiar
[1:20:45] sound well I'm from Kentucky right I
[1:20:48] didn't know what leopard sound
[1:20:51] like so I wake up and when I do a a
[1:20:56] chill goes all over my entire body my
[1:20:59] hair is standing up on the back of my
[1:21:02] neck on my
[1:21:05] arms and the disadvantage was they had
[1:21:09] no locks on those
[1:21:12] doors now I'm thinking this is the wrong
[1:21:16] dispensation this is the wrong
[1:21:18] dispensation for no
[1:21:21] locks so I laid there and I laid there
[1:21:24] for quite some time while I'm hearing
[1:21:26] the sound well the next morning I mean
[1:21:27] needless to say I didn't sleep much the
[1:21:29] rest of the night I can imagine myself
[1:21:31] going down the esophagus of this
[1:21:34] leopard having raw preacher for
[1:21:37] supper so the next morning I mentioned
[1:21:40] to the guy and I said I think I heard
[1:21:41] that leopard he could hear the
[1:21:43] excitement of course in my voice he said
[1:21:45] what it sound like well I replicated it
[1:21:47] he laughed real big and said that was an
[1:21:49] ante
[1:21:51] eater
[1:21:55] well I didn't know if an eaters can eat
[1:21:57] humans or not I me that didn't make no
[1:21:58] difference to me all I knew was what I
[1:22:05] heard but when Adam and Eve would lay
[1:22:07] down at
[1:22:09] night
[1:22:12] sha would come over and laid down by
[1:22:15] him imagine the big African
[1:22:19] line the black man
[1:22:23] Big woy Man on
[1:22:26] him and he would just lay down and said
[1:22:28] come here Papa would R him on the man he
[1:22:38] just Adam would say Good night
[1:22:42] darling good night sweetheart I'll see
[1:22:44] you in the
[1:22:46] morning they wake
[1:22:48] up didn't have a Temperpedic Mas
[1:22:51] mattress but no wakes in the
[1:22:56] back they would get up and they say
[1:22:58] how'd you sleep well they couldn't sleep
[1:23:00] anyway but just
[1:23:02] perfect so I said what do you want for
[1:23:04] breakfast this
[1:23:06] morning maybe maybe that fruit to this
[1:23:09] fruit cuz they were not remember they
[1:23:10] were not meat eaters the animals were
[1:23:12] not
[1:23:13] carnivorous everything was eating
[1:23:18] vegetation so they'd get up and start
[1:23:21] today it was just the same thing over
[1:23:24] and over and over
[1:23:27] again in the evening time they knew it
[1:23:31] was about right they didn't have a watch
[1:23:32] but they knew it was about time for him
[1:23:34] to come
[1:23:35] down I could just see them as they was
[1:23:37] pacing back and forth and anxious is it
[1:23:40] about church stuff yeah it won't be
[1:23:44] long and this light would appear in the
[1:23:46] bushes and maybe just a slight little
[1:23:49] breeze would start blowing the leaves
[1:23:52] and they'd sense this great
[1:23:55] aura of the almighty my
[1:23:59] children how was your
[1:24:03] day oh
[1:24:05] papa it was
[1:24:07] perfect thank you for letting us live
[1:24:09] here or you're
[1:24:12] welcome I made this just for
[1:24:15] you you like it oh we love it so
[1:24:21] much
[1:24:26] I
[1:24:27] believe we are closer than any
[1:24:31] generation that's ever
[1:24:33] been to stepping back into that Garden
[1:24:39] again so I ask
[1:24:43] you why would you not want to love him
[1:24:47] and
[1:24:48] fellowship and adore with him more now
[1:24:53] than in your entire
[1:25:03] life what will it be
[1:25:08] friends oh he
[1:25:12] didn't he didn't make them fall he
[1:25:16] couldn't but he allowed a means by which
[1:25:19] they could
[1:25:21] fall in order to make his
[1:25:24] attributes more fully
[1:25:27] expressed and remember that same
[1:25:30] being crawled underneath the garden gate
[1:25:33] as we would
[1:25:35] say would love to crawl underneath the
[1:25:39] Gate of your
[1:25:40] life the Gate of our
[1:25:43] church our place that God has given
[1:25:47] us and to go to Whispering and talking
[1:25:51] to try to pull you out of
[1:25:53] fellowship with
[1:25:58] God I pray that God will help each of
[1:26:02] us that we can understand we are here
[1:26:06] for more than driving a
[1:26:09] truck building buildings painting walls
[1:26:13] finishing wood laying
[1:26:16] carpet we are here for an eternal
[1:26:21] purpose
[1:26:23] do you understand in heaven when we get
[1:26:25] there you will not be
[1:26:31] employed there will be no real estate
[1:26:35] sales he owns it
[1:26:37] all there will be no grocery stores as I
[1:26:40] said before there will be no
[1:26:43] industry there will be no industry what
[1:26:46] will we be doing it'll be a continuation
[1:26:49] of this same life we will come back back
[1:26:52] to the Garden of Eden again remember in
[1:26:54] the Garden of Eden before the fall God
[1:26:56] led the man there and he was just to do
[1:27:00] light listen light
[1:27:04] work just to tend the
[1:27:09] garden people make fun of me cause I
[1:27:11] like
[1:27:15] Gardens that was the original employment
[1:27:19] of the first man now life
[1:27:27] don't you understand it began in a
[1:27:32] garden the price started to be paid in
[1:27:35] another Garden The Garden of
[1:27:39] Gethsemane it will end in another
[1:27:45] one and let me give you an overview as I
[1:27:48] stop
[1:27:51] momentarily the city will descend from
[1:27:53] God out of heaven in a pyramidal
[1:28:01] shape the angle of
[1:28:03] descent up the walls of the
[1:28:06] city for people in glorified bodies
[1:28:10] you'll hardly feel yourself walking up
[1:28:13] an angle at
[1:28:16] all the Earth by this time will have
[1:28:18] been
[1:28:21] changed all the excretions all of the
[1:28:24] scars all of the things that even the
[1:28:27] Earth holds this
[1:28:29] day up in newand several miles thick
[1:28:34] they still find these sea creatures
[1:28:37] several miles deep in the
[1:28:39] Earth but in the Eighth Day all of that
[1:28:42] memory of the past the echos skeleton
[1:28:46] and all the record of her past sins will
[1:28:49] be
[1:28:51] annihilated holy far from God out of
[1:28:53] heaven will come and change this planet
[1:28:57] like he changed you by the Holy
[1:29:00] Ghost and John said I saw the new city
[1:29:03] the New Jerusalem descending from God
[1:29:05] out of Heaven as a bride adorned for her
[1:29:08] husband so it will come and set down on
[1:29:11] the earth and John said I saw no more
[1:29:17] sea and there will land this 1500 M
[1:29:21] Square
[1:29:24] City it will be built on an angle of
[1:29:28] ascent and the paradises of God will be
[1:29:33] built up like
[1:29:36] this John saw a throne and him that sat
[1:29:39] on the throne was like an unto a Jasper
[1:29:42] and a sarden stone and the River of Life
[1:29:46] proceeded out from under the Throne of
[1:29:49] God it'll start at the Throne of God
[1:29:52] it'll trickle down in our Gardens behind
[1:29:56] our
[1:29:59] houses here will come the river as it
[1:30:02] comes out from the throne and the water
[1:30:04] will Branch down and start trickling
[1:30:06] down all the way down all the way down
[1:30:10] all the way down to the bottom age the
[1:30:14] Ephesian age and then it'll start
[1:30:17] recirculating again all the way back up
[1:30:20] to the top
[1:30:22] and what age is it you all live in
[1:30:24] remind
[1:30:25] me Leo
[1:30:28] to seventh
[1:30:31] age guess where you get to
[1:30:37] reside right up at the
[1:30:44] top he will Crown your
[1:30:47] life living in
[1:30:50] hell
[1:30:52] by letting you live for
[1:30:55] eternity at the top of the
[1:31:00] city so I ask you is it worth
[1:31:04] it
[1:31:10] yes living out on the breadth of the
[1:31:13] earth will be those who are
[1:31:16] saved the nations of the
[1:31:19] earth and they will come in from time to
[1:31:22] time and
[1:31:23] bring fruits of their
[1:31:27] labors into the order of
[1:31:31] MDC the priesthood of
[1:31:34] God for we will be
[1:31:39] there as part of the temple of
[1:31:42] God on the earth remember John said I
[1:31:45] looked and I saw no
[1:31:47] Temple why the lamb is the temple the
[1:31:50] father is the temple and there will be
[1:31:53] his
[1:31:54] bride who loves to
[1:31:58] fellowship and she fellowshipped with
[1:32:00] him so much in life she loved him more
[1:32:04] than riches she loved him more than sin
[1:32:06] she loved him more than anything else in
[1:32:08] the world and he said because of
[1:32:12] that I give you an eternal
[1:32:17] inheritance in this
[1:32:20] city guess what there are no U-Haul
[1:32:22] trucks in that place so you won't be
[1:32:25] moving from the seventh floor to the
[1:32:27] first floor to the third floor to the
[1:32:29] fifth floor some of you's moved all of
[1:32:31] your life you better move while the
[1:32:33] moving's good CU you're going to come to
[1:32:35] a SP a spot you won't be moving no
[1:32:42] more coming down through the mainstream
[1:32:44] of the River of Life and there would be
[1:32:48] trees on either side of the
[1:32:50] river and they will bring forth their
[1:32:53] fruits and they'll change their fruits
[1:32:55] 12 times in the
[1:32:58] year and their leaves will be for the
[1:33:01] healings of the Nations so the Nations
[1:33:03] that live out on the face of the Earth
[1:33:05] will come in to worship and they'll come
[1:33:08] in to the bride
[1:33:10] City and they'll reach up and pull off a
[1:33:14] leaf off the tree of life and they'll
[1:33:17] hand it over to their neighbor King and
[1:33:19] say we fought for one another's blood
[1:33:22] one time on the Earth but now we don't
[1:33:25] fight no
[1:33:28] more and the leaves are for the healings
[1:33:31] of the
[1:33:33] Nations setting up on the top of the
[1:33:35] throne will be the human body of
[1:33:39] God which has been
[1:33:43] glorified and hanging above
[1:33:46] him will be the father which is not a
[1:33:53] man this great
[1:33:56] light so Jesus will be our
[1:33:59] Joseph and there he will sit on the
[1:34:02] throne and when we walk up to the throne
[1:34:05] he will be emanating these lights Rays
[1:34:09] coming out as
[1:34:12] beings but you'll be changed don't worry
[1:34:15] you won't
[1:34:16] fear you to you'll be able to walk up in
[1:34:19] that light and as it hits your face
[1:34:21] it'll reflect back off of you and the
[1:34:24] people that's coming up will see where

[1:34:49] shakai with you

[1:34:53] eternity and the people that live on the
[1:34:56] earth will walk in and they'll look at
