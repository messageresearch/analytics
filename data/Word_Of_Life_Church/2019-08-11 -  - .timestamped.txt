[25:25] day almighty all-powerful omnipotent but
[25:30] it's wonderful to know him his father
[25:31] yeah revelation 22 verse 12 praise the
[25:38] Lord
[25:39] Oh Joe had a wonderful service trip
[25:40] Wednesday night a man thanked the Lord
[25:44] praise the Lord we're talking about our
[25:49] new home and actually looking at the
[25:51] reflection of the character of the God
[25:54] and the people of that new home versus
[25:59] the type of material that that new home
[26:02] is going to be built out of this new
[26:07] home consists of all different
[26:10] categories of people it consists of the
[26:13] elect and the Lambs book it will consist
[26:16] of those that are in the book of life
[26:19] whose names are non blot it out it will
[26:23] consist of those of revelation 22:17
[26:26] the spirit and the bride say come those
[26:32] that are athirst let them come and
[26:36] whosoever will let them come and take of
[26:41] the water of life freely so it shows us
[26:43] different categories of people that will
[26:46] be there a man I'm just glad I'm going
[26:50] to be one of them aren't you
[26:53] now notice as we've looked at this
[26:55] before that this book of Revelation is
[26:57] especially this 22nd chapter here it's a
[27:00] dialogue between the Lord Jesus the
[27:03] angel which is bringing the revelation
[27:05] John even the bride speaks up said to be
[27:08] very careful in reading it notice this
[27:11] this is Jesus now behold I come quickly
[27:13] and my reward is with me to give every
[27:16] man according as his work shall be I am
[27:21] Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[27:24] end the first and the last blessed are
[27:27] they that do His commandments that they
[27:31] may have right to the Tree of Life and
[27:34] may enter through the gates of the city
[27:36] I want to sure you notice that there in
[27:37] verse 14 it changed into another person
[27:40] which of course is John blessed are they
[27:43] that do His commandments it's not Jesus
[27:45] now speaking said blessed are they that
[27:47] do my Commandments of a blessed are they
[27:48] that do His commandments oh it's another
[27:50] person that's referencing him that they
[27:53] may have right to the Tree of Life and
[27:56] may enter in through the gates into the
[27:59] city I mean let's be remember tune that
[28:01] before the Lord as we pray would you
[28:04] need to request in your heart to have
[28:06] only father as we bow our heads to the
[28:09] deaths of the earth and once we came
[28:10] we're so grateful Lord Jesus to be able
[28:13] have the opportunity to stand once again
[28:15] in the presence of the Almighty God so
[28:18] grateful father that we don't have to
[28:20] stand there before you with fiery eyes
[28:23] of judgment looking at us so grateful
[28:26] Father that we don't have to stand there
[28:28] with fear so gripping our humanity our
[28:31] sins our trespasses being there before
[28:34] us knowing that judgment awaits us how
[28:37] grateful we are that we can bow our
[28:39] heads close our eyes and call on father
[28:42] God Lord we are so blessed tonight if
[28:45] you never do one more thing if you never
[28:48] answer another prayer if you never heal
[28:51] us if you never meet another need or
[28:53] another burden in our life that we have
[28:55] just to make us your children we are so
[28:59] blessed we want you to know we
[29:01] appreciate it tonight with all of our
[29:03] hearts origins
[29:04] our pretty should speak to us tonight
[29:06] fathers we look into your word once
[29:09] again Lord in Jesus name and the Saint
[29:11] said God bless you may be seated
[29:14] before we go back into the tree of life
[29:17] I would like verse 2 first tonight look
[29:19] at life itself life itself
[29:25] life is a great thing as a matter of
[29:28] fact it is the greatest of God's gifts
[29:32] most people in their mind they would
[29:36] think about now what great things would
[29:38] be in life the carnal Laodicean they
[29:42] think more of things and what all things
[29:46] they can accumulate and what all things
[29:49] that they have in their possession and
[29:52] what all things they want in the future
[29:55] and they are jealous of other people
[29:57] because they have more things than they
[30:00] do money or whatever more that it is but
[30:03] in reality and all the things of life
[30:06] and the things that go with life that is
[30:09] not the greatest part of life itself now
[30:12] money of course we know that money is in
[30:14] exchange and we're able to exchange it
[30:17] for goods for different things of life
[30:20] and we need money of course to be able
[30:21] to live function operate but money
[30:24] itself is not the greatest thing of life
[30:26] human love is a great thing but yet
[30:30] human love is not the greatest thing of
[30:32] life actually the greatest gift itself
[30:36] would be life itself
[30:38] now let's look at it for just a few
[30:40] moments before we go back into the
[30:41] Garden of Eden now if this building here
[30:44] tonight was entirely stacked full of
[30:47] hundred dollar bills beginning at my
[30:49] office door every crack and cranny the
[30:52] baptistry included the furnace room
[30:53] we'll even put it in the organ we'll put
[30:55] it inside these amplifiers speakers in
[30:57] every room we can do it
[30:59] Wolf's tank hundred dollar bills plumb
[31:01] up to the ceiling we'll go all across
[31:03] the fellowship hall we'll put them there
[31:05] we'll put them up into the nurseries
[31:07] upstairs who put them into the bathrooms
[31:09] we'll fill the sink we fill under the
[31:11] sinks we'll put them in the vanities
[31:13] we'll put them in brother Jim's office
[31:15] chair in the library
[31:16] we'll have as many hundred-dollar bills
[31:19] as we can stack inside this building
[31:21] then we'll fill the fellowship hall and
[31:23] then we'll start on the outside and
[31:25] we'll go 25 feet out from the walls of
[31:29] the building itself and we'll make a
[31:30] total circumference as high as we can
[31:32] stack them then we'll fill everybody's
[31:35] vehicle car truck RV whatever you're
[31:39] driving tonight we'll fill them all with
[31:41] hundred-dollar bills as well now some of
[31:43] y'all's eyes as big as half dollars
[31:45] right now oh my goodness what I could do
[31:47] with all that but yet now if we had all
[31:50] of that and then we had every bit of
[31:53] this money that would totally be around
[31:55] us and here we were as humans and all of
[31:58] us were here of course we're not sitting
[32:00] here because there's money in your Pew
[32:02] but we're standing on the outside
[32:03] watching us all this money has unloaded
[32:06] and whenever the last stack of money has
[32:09] been unloaded and the final hundred
[32:12] dollar bill has been placed in the in
[32:14] the desk or in the office or in the car
[32:16] wherever it is and after it's all said
[32:19] and done and right when we are going to
[32:22] be allowed to get as much as we want we
[32:26] all die so I ask you which would be
[32:33] worse the most all that money or life
[32:39] praise the Lord
[32:40] now if all of that money and we know how
[32:43] it's been for centuries that man has
[32:46] loved gold I mean you give all the gold
[32:49] rushes that have been down through time
[32:51] and people have sold everything they
[32:54] have and they went to the Klondike rush
[32:56] they went to the San Francisco 49er Gold
[32:59] Rush they won all over the world and the
[33:02] majority of them lost everything they
[33:05] had many of them lost their lives they
[33:08] lost their family right they lost so
[33:11] much stuff just on a hope that they
[33:14] would become a rich millionaire whatever
[33:17] it was because of them of a medal that
[33:20] was gonna be dug out of the ground
[33:22] and many of them lost their life on the
[33:26] whole or a promise of someone who went
[33:29] into the gold fields and dug out and the
[33:33] majority of them never got one thing but
[33:37] yet they risk the greatest thing of all
[33:40] to get something that they had no
[33:43] vindicated promise that they would ever
[33:46] become rich or famous or important and
[33:49] they gave away the most important thing
[33:53] they had which was life now want you to
[33:58] think about that now no matter what we
[34:00] could talk about tonight or think about
[34:03] now let's move beyond money and let's
[34:05] think about pleasures because that's
[34:07] what Laodicea loves so much are the
[34:10] pleasures of life so whatever that would
[34:13] bring human beings pleasures now even we
[34:16] as children of God have things that we
[34:18] enjoy doing places that we enjoy going
[34:21] and all that but whatever that we could
[34:24] talk about tonight that would be
[34:25] pleasures and we would think whatever is
[34:27] the most pleasurable in life to
[34:30] Christians is things that are not sinful
[34:31] of course and then we weren't able to
[34:33] think about all the pleasures that we
[34:36] enjoy and all the things that bring us
[34:39] the deepest of happiness and things that
[34:41] are external from us that would be able
[34:43] to satisfy and be able to lift our
[34:46] spirits for a little bit and make us
[34:48] feel better and bring something to us
[34:51] that would being an element of human
[34:53] enjoyment and yet we could pile again
[34:56] all of that together in one pile and it
[34:58] could be all be given to us and we'd say
[35:01] go enjoy your life and spend years and
[35:04] years and years on vacation and get off
[35:07] of this boat and get onto that boat and
[35:09] when you leave that boat get on this
[35:11] airplane and go here and there and there
[35:14] and
[35:15] never have to work again the rest of
[35:17] their life will be a vacation and the
[35:19] very day you get ready to start it you
[35:22] die so what should be the greatest of
[35:27] value to you
[35:28] a Disney cruise or life now what I find
[35:35] amazing about this is that people then
[35:38] will listen to Satan who will talk them
[35:42] into smoking drinking doping or all
[35:48] kinds of other things that they do to
[35:51] themself
[35:52] which is proven to shorten and take away
[35:56] their life and yet they will exchange an
[36:01] element of years of smoking or an
[36:04] element of time but woods they're able
[36:07] to get drunk or high or so on and so on
[36:10] for the greatest gift of all which is
[36:14] life now if we would look at it in the
[36:17] temporary natural sense natural life
[36:20] itself it's a built-in mechanism within
[36:23] us I'll find that amazing because when
[36:26] God made us he made our brain when there
[36:28] was no danger on the earth God made our
[36:32] response time and our reaction time so
[36:36] whenever we see danger that were able by
[36:39] perception of the eyes and it's able to
[36:42] flash into that part of our brain and it
[36:45] reacts within three quarters of a second
[36:48] so somebody stops in front of you they
[36:50] tap their brake lights they turn in a
[36:53] turn signal they just made up their mind
[36:55] they're going to start with this
[36:56] vegetable stand and get some tomatoes
[36:58] and they might call a major accident
[37:00] fifteen people behind them about pileup
[37:02] but God made us even when there wasn't
[37:06] any cars when man did not have to
[37:08] respond that fast but God knew there
[37:11] would be cars so God made us with a
[37:14] built-in mechanism to where that within
[37:17] three-quarters of a second sunset
[37:20] that we're able to respond faster than
[37:22] you can snap your fingers so what is it
[37:25] it's something built in us to be able to
[37:28] protect our lives so you're behind the
[37:30] wheel you're driving all of a sudden BAM
[37:32] that sudden not quicker than what I just
[37:34] did that you're able to react according
[37:38] to that built-in mechanism well if it is
[37:40] that way just about someone turning off
[37:43] in front of you or someone go to hit you
[37:45] and you'd go up like this to protect
[37:47] your face how much more is it built in
[37:50] us naturally even naturally to protect
[37:53] ourselves against the plight and the
[37:55] contagion of sin it's in man as just a
[38:00] fallen son of God to rebel against sin
[38:05] itself and man has to override that same
[38:08] buried deepest in him to you to the sin
[38:12] of the enemy to take his own life so
[38:15] they can put it on the pack of
[38:16] cigarettes warning Surgeon General has
[38:19] determined that smoking your cigarettes
[38:22] can cause cancer well this can cause it
[38:25] that can cause a drinking alcohol and
[38:27] they'll good and spot of every warning
[38:29] you put up there and yet take vitamin C
[38:33] to help keep them getting a cold
[38:34] oh are you crazy
[38:38] yes you are you take vitamin C the up if
[38:42] you're going to not get a cold and sat
[38:44] down and drink alcohol or smoke
[38:46] cigarettes and smoke yourself to death
[38:48] you're out of your mind well come on
[38:51] happy Valley if a man's will be
[38:53] appreciated but yet there's something
[38:56] about life no life itself
[38:58] you know it's a great mystery but we
[39:01] know that God I think believes that God
[39:03] will ever allow science to ever to be
[39:05] able to break in it and create it now we
[39:08] know they try to clone and try to do all
[39:10] different kinds of things with DNA but
[39:12] still they did not make the DNA or the
[39:14] light by which the DNA come from only
[39:17] God can do that
[39:19] but yet they desire to break into life
[39:22] itself and be able to tell of course say
[39:26] they keep the bodies are you know
[39:28] different Communists leaders and they've
[39:30] got them frozen or whatever more under
[39:32] the partition that they think one day
[39:34] they'll be able to bring life back again
[39:36] because man wants to live forever
[39:39] without coming through the power and
[39:42] under the submission of the Cross right
[39:46] so he wants to be able to do through how
[39:49] a test tube or medication or some sort
[39:52] of shot he wants to be able to gain live
[39:55] now Satan will tell people oh this is
[39:57] the life this is living you're really
[40:00] living he knows he's lying to you he
[40:03] knows that he's telling you a lie trying
[40:06] to convince you the drinking alcohol and
[40:09] all these other things is alive why
[40:11] science itself will tell you that it's
[40:13] not oh you've got a news read the
[40:15] warning and know that it is not but Yeti
[40:17] convinces people that is alive in
[40:20] reality it's not so you take the rich
[40:24] the famous all my those great
[40:26] celebrities around the world and when
[40:28] they take their lives or they're in an
[40:30] automobile accident then what happens to
[40:33] all other money whenever these great
[40:35] wealthy important people have you ever
[40:38] seen any of them take a million dollars
[40:40] with them to hell you ever seen them pay
[40:43] a million dollars inside of the casket
[40:45] well they might put it in there but I
[40:47] guarantee it'll never make it to the
[40:49] Graveyard they'll be picked clean
[40:52] well is that right why are people saying
[40:55] why should you let all that go to waste
[40:57] I mean they're able even burning that
[40:59] with them I'll help myself to a little
[41:01] bit well the Undertaker gets a little
[41:02] bit the gravedigger gets a little bit
[41:04] more ain't so-and-so gets so-and-so
[41:06] uncle cousin get so-and-so so well in
[41:09] the world burn all that good money so
[41:11] which is the greatest money or life
[41:14] answer me which is the great
[41:17] alcohol our life which is the greatest
[41:21] the pleasures of sin or life now notice
[41:25] in it is on this aspect that the very
[41:28] kingdom of God is bill and that is the
[41:31] basis of life God is the controller God
[41:34] is the giver God is the creator of life
[41:36] perpetual life and eternal life and we
[41:40] know that he is the only source by which
[41:42] people and things can actually live and
[41:45] reproduce now based upon this and we
[41:47] know when we go looking into the
[41:49] paradise of God that we have several
[41:52] phrases by which God Himself coins and
[41:54] use them in the Tree of Life the crown
[41:57] of life
[41:58] the book of life so everything that goes
[42:01] before that is a synonym with that word
[42:03] comes from the great creator himself the
[42:07] rewards giving to the overcomers of the
[42:10] church ages as an affiliation with life
[42:13] so heaven itself it's not just about
[42:15] gold and silver and beautiful things but
[42:18] it's about life praise the Lord
[42:20] now in the Garden of Eden it was based
[42:23] upon that very thing I remember when God
[42:25] started with the lower forms of life you
[42:28] know the Prophet said it might have
[42:29] started with an amoeba a very form of
[42:31] short form of life might have come from
[42:33] a one-celled saying whether it was that
[42:35] God started it from and then it started
[42:38] expanding and the cells began to divide
[42:40] and he kept going higher and higher and
[42:42] higher and it was a form of evolution
[42:44] but spiritual evolution not 9 stirred
[42:48] the others as the scientists would look
[42:50] at it now we realize then that God
[42:52] himself is the one who gives life a none
[42:55] son himself the great brain who had such
[42:57] significance so there's only way to be
[42:59] able to look at the universe and things
[43:01] that's there and explain it and that is
[43:03] Hebrews 1 and that says that the God who
[43:06] framed all sayings by the power of his
[43:08] word right we still believe that dormant
[43:11] but we know that before God ever brought
[43:14] the man into existence that life had
[43:17] already come into existence for maybe
[43:19] millions of years we don't know for sure
[43:21] but even in the end
[43:23] itself when God began to expand the
[43:26] heavens and the angels began to take
[43:29] form that God made some that were of his
[43:31] essence some of his character and they
[43:33] actually spun off of his being so they
[43:36] were not time beings they were not
[43:38] created in the element of time but
[43:39] coming from the eternal they would not
[43:42] have a beginning if you could understand
[43:44] that you'll see where you were in your
[43:45] gene for that's why we have eternal life
[43:48] so it's not that that life actually
[43:50] started on one day but it's spun off of
[43:54] him which is eternal but also from him
[43:57] that part of himself he could allocate
[43:59] things that would come forth and fill in
[44:02] the span of time and then they would
[44:04] cease to exist because they are not part
[44:07] of him and that says you understand now
[44:10] the Lord of course knew exactly had to
[44:12] make all this and man searching for life
[44:15] on Mars and trying to figure out how to
[44:17] go out and live on Mars and we got
[44:19] millions of acres here on the earth were
[44:21] there any human beings that ever set
[44:22] foot never even lived or anything else
[44:24] I'm able to go out turn try to figure
[44:26] out how to live on Mars my goodness and
[44:28] all the problems and issues that we've
[44:30] got you on the other why don't we try to
[44:31] figure out how to plant more food make
[44:33] more water and all that stuff but it's
[44:34] always man trying to get after and
[44:36] fiddle around on something they don't
[44:38] even know what he's doing well praise
[44:41] the Lord that's man that always mind in
[44:43] somebody else's business and not take
[44:45] care of his own house once you fair how
[44:47] to take salt water and make drinking
[44:49] water out every time the desert into
[44:50] something to be able to bring forth
[44:51] roses and cabbage and peaches and
[44:54] apricots
[44:55] but that's man he wants to look at
[44:57] something like that because to him he's
[45:00] saying oh my and yes science itself is
[45:02] our life science cannot make a blade of
[45:05] grass science cannot oh you say they can
[45:07] they cannot they have to take an
[45:09] original life and be able to tamper with
[45:12] the seed line and be able to get inside
[45:14] of that they cannot make life itself why
[45:17] God is the one who made it so God will
[45:21] he be able to bring all of this into
[45:23] existence and then when he made the
[45:24] earth and put all the life the beginning
[45:26] of life
[45:28] they're probably meant for an angelic
[45:29] life into botany life animal life and
[45:32] whatever lower form of life that is
[45:34] started and he kept coming up higher and
[45:36] higher and higher until the Lord God
[45:38] made man now know of God we could know
[45:40] of course in Genesis 1 that God brought
[45:43] out of himself this man in Genesis 1
[45:45] this was the man of course which was in
[45:48] the original image of the word and then
[45:50] the man at Genesis 2 took on the form of
[45:54] the kingdom he was going to be king over
[45:56] now the man in Genesis 1 could not a
[45:58] properly rule the kingdom by which he
[46:01] was going to be king over as long as he
[46:03] was in spirit form so God took him and
[46:06] give him a hand like a bear a foot like
[46:08] a monkey and all this and that in the
[46:10] other because he bore within his own
[46:12] earthly image parts of the kingdom by
[46:15] which he was gonna rule over so much the
[46:17] Son of God did the same thing and become
[46:19] a human being he could not die in the
[46:22] form of workers he could not die
[46:25] supernatural light he had the dies of
[46:27] man now whenever God brings it to this
[46:30] stage then of course the Lord wants to
[46:32] bring forth the first specie that would
[46:34] have this human life that's a higher
[46:36] life than that of the serpent of the
[46:38] chimpanzee of the monkey of the gorilla
[46:40] of all the other things that lived on
[46:42] the earth and God makes his human being
[46:44] out of the dust of the earth and he
[46:46] forms all of the organs the bones of
[46:48] sinew the sales of tissue whatever more
[46:51] that's there but the man stands as it
[46:53] wise with his toes like roots as a tree
[46:56] down into the Earth's a man cannot
[46:58] breathe a man cannot move he is no more
[47:01] than the mechanics of a bunch of calcium
[47:03] potash petroleum cosmic lights so God
[47:07] takes the mechanics of all of this and
[47:09] he reaches over here and gets a handful
[47:11] of this and a handful of that and he
[47:13] goes to shaping it not from the clay but
[47:16] from the dust of the earth the very top
[47:18] of the earth itself then God goes to
[47:21] making all of this but still there's no
[47:23] life so it's like a Potter as he takes a
[47:25] handful of clay and it begins to take on
[47:28] an image now there was no visible image
[47:30] in God's mind but which he can make it
[47:32] from except for the spirit image of the
[47:34] logos there was no other man there
[47:36] but yeah they begin to form him from
[47:38] that spiritual image I remember in the
[47:40] eternal he can look at something that is
[47:43] not and considered as though it is
[47:45] already there so the Son of God did not
[47:48] already have a flesh body but your atom
[47:50] is made in a pre figure of what the Son
[47:52] of God would look similar to thousands
[47:54] of years down the road everybody with me
[47:56] so here he stands but he is still non
[47:59] alive so now look around him he's got
[48:02] all this beautiful paradise the trees
[48:04] are alive the monkeys are alive
[48:06] elephants are alive all the Botany life
[48:08] is alive the flowers are blooming the
[48:10] waters trickling down it's such a
[48:12] beautiful paradise but your sons this
[48:14] man totally completely lifeless no he
[48:17] has ideas eyebrows eyelashes
[48:20] yes pupils his corneas he has
[48:22] fingernails toenails he has all these
[48:24] things so the mechanics of his body is
[48:26] there by representation but he's still
[48:29] not alive right now he has a position by
[48:33] which he is the head over all of this
[48:35] but there doesn't do him any good
[48:37] because he's not alive are you getting
[48:40] my point life is the same he had eyes
[48:43] but he couldn't see he had hands but he
[48:47] couldn't feel he had a mouse but he
[48:49] couldn't talk because he did not have
[48:51] any life people can come to church and
[48:54] clap their hands and play tapes and say
[48:57] they believe the message home I'll say
[48:59] I'm the pastor but without eternal life
[49:02] they're just a bunch of mechanics piled
[49:04] up in a pile but we don't want to be
[49:07] mechanics only we want to be dynamics
[49:10] and mechanics
[49:12] now the mechanics of course is the body
[49:15] of Genesis 2 and then the dynamics of
[49:18] supernatural part is that word comes
[49:19] from a Moya the breath of God which must
[49:22] be breathed in him but also atoms
[49:25] supernatural being which existed in
[49:27] Genesis 1 now this is before of course
[49:30] he's called Adam he was yet the word so
[49:32] he had not attained a human name so here
[49:35] he stands all mechanics total mechanics
[49:37] absolutely no life no movement no
[49:40] nothing else everything around him
[49:43] maybe the animals combined looked at him
[49:44] and the birds flew by and looked at him
[49:47] and all this life is moving around a bit
[49:49] himself as absolutely nothing the
[49:51] elephant could come by with his trunk
[49:53] and breeze on him he did not have the
[49:55] ability to impart this Numa of God this
[49:58] life this animation in this body could
[50:01] not do it
[50:02] there was only one source by which the
[50:04] life could come and that was from the
[50:07] eternal right
[50:09] how many else ever made mud mud houses
[50:11] and mud toys and your sisters when you
[50:14] was little make mud cakes and mud pies
[50:16] maybe some of your brothers made them I
[50:17] don't know but you played in the mat and
[50:19] you go to a beach and you make a wall
[50:22] they call it a sand castle well you
[50:24] ought to see some of mine they look like
[50:25] a wrecking balls out there because I'm
[50:27] certainly not an artist but yet you make
[50:29] all of that is there any life in it well
[50:31] you may place your doll in there your
[50:33] little girl you may place your horse in
[50:35] there you know if you're a little boy
[50:36] you might sit your John Deere tractor
[50:38] inside though that it's only it's only
[50:40] alive in your mind now you sit down
[50:43] before Papa Papa let's see that
[50:45] animation is only coming from you
[50:47] because there is no life in the tractor
[50:50] there's none in the Barbie doll there's
[50:52] not in the Sandcastle y'all preaching
[50:54] with me tonight there's absolutely
[50:56] nothing there but just the mechanics
[50:58] itself so you animate that and you say
[51:00] well come on dog come on honey
[51:02] you know this is your family so you are
[51:04] the animator of the life of this
[51:07] creation so you're putting there in your
[51:08] imagination well God did not want it to
[51:11] be imaginary life in this Adam the son
[51:14] of God God wanted them to have I
[51:16] realized I was an animation in the sense
[51:19] that God is going to breathes in him the
[51:21] breath of life so all this is around him
[51:24] but it doesn't do him any good because
[51:27] he's totally unaware so we could do the
[51:29] same way tonight a rich man roll up here
[51:31] and my we all passed by leaves a good
[51:33] old guy man he was a good old guy we
[51:35] could pile up all of his money we could
[51:37] put all these car keys and all of his
[51:39] truck keys and all of his guns and
[51:41] rifles and whatever it was he done it
[51:43] won't do him one bit of good
[51:45] not be able to take not one thing with
[51:47] him is that right so what's would he
[51:49] rather have his fine house his fine car
[51:51] if they could get one of the other back
[51:53] which one are you thinking to choose I
[51:55] know which one to choose he would choose
[51:57] life well this is what I'm trying to
[52:01] tell you tonight that God by the gospel
[52:03] offers us not just human life to be able
[52:06] to perpetuate and pass our genes down
[52:09] from one generation to another
[52:11] but God is offering to us eternal life
[52:15] which is not the life of our mother the
[52:18] life of our Father but it is his our
[52:21] life which is Zoe right which can never
[52:26] pass away though the body will die
[52:28] though it would go back to the dust of
[52:30] the earth yet once we have been breathed
[52:33] upon by the eternal Himself that life is
[52:36] ours forever now won't you notice
[52:40] something now that whenever the Lord
[52:41] told Adam that there's two trees in the
[52:44] Garden of Eden one of them was the Tree
[52:45] of Life and the other was the tree of
[52:47] knowledge of good and evil and God said
[52:49] don't protect that tree now the
[52:51] knowledge of good and evil on the day
[52:53] you eat thereof that day you shall now I
[52:57] want you to notice what God told him God
[53:00] did not tell him and the day you eat
[53:02] thereof that day you'll be lost and
[53:05] become a son of the devil God never told
[53:09] him you're going to hell the day you eat
[53:11] there now listen friends come on out
[53:13] we've changed this drastically the way
[53:16] it was in the Garden of Eden this one
[53:18] reads my folks under sent election they
[53:20] don't have election write in Genesis - I
[53:22] don't have it right in Genesis 3 God
[53:25] told Adam the consequence of what would
[53:28] happen if the aid of that tree what was
[53:30] that he would die he did not tell him he
[53:34] would be lost because Adam could not be
[53:36] lost any more than God could be lost
[53:40] God did not tell Adam he was going to go
[53:42] to hell because
[53:43] that was impossible well praise God boy
[53:48] that ought to make some y'all near to
[53:49] have a spell why Adam could not ever go
[53:53] to hell he was a son of God but what did
[53:57] he lose his fellowship and then the
[53:59] cycle of death began to move in the
[54:02] Adams body God never told him read your
[54:04] Bible god never told him you will go to
[54:07] hell and the day you made that offer you
[54:09] will be lost the day you do that you'll
[54:12] turn into a goat God told him you will
[54:14] die and even inside Adam did not die
[54:18] that day but the cycle of debt said its
[54:21] motion and Adams members is that right
[54:24] so now then we have who we see that not
[54:27] another law which is law of death comes
[54:29] into the cycle of life which god of
[54:32] course never intended for it to be there
[54:33] but he knew that it would now notice
[54:35] this in Genesis chapter 2 verse 7 and
[54:37] the Lord God formed man of the dust of
[54:40] the ground now notice now this is the
[54:42] first revelation in this chapter you're
[54:45] the first revelation of the compound
[54:46] name of God that is being revealed in
[54:48] Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God God I
[54:52] don't I you and well to him God created
[54:55] the heavens in the earth but here in
[54:56] Genesis 2 we have it is Jehovah with his
[55:00] family so it is Jehovah out of him or
[55:03] Jehovah I don't know
[55:05] so it is a compound redemptive name of
[55:08] God never remember the word interpreted
[55:10] is a manifestation of the name of God so
[55:12] here we find that the name of God in
[55:15] Genesis 2 is revealed in another
[55:17] attribute praise God
[55:20] notice so the Lord God not God created
[55:24] the heavens and the earth but the Lord
[55:26] God formed man of the dust of the ground
[55:30] I noticed the Bible of course condenses
[55:32] his truth Moses doesn't tell us how long
[55:34] it was that it took him to form the man
[55:37] nor does Moses tell us how long it was
[55:39] that the man stood there
[55:41] and that life estate but the Lord God
[55:42] formed man of the dust of the ground and
[55:44] breathed into his nostrils of the Hebrew
[55:48] word there is nostrils or face breathed
[55:52] into his face the breath of life and man
[55:57] became not a living human being but a
[56:02] living soul now notice so then man
[56:06] becomes an English a new fish a living
[56:10] soul so the man now has more than just
[56:13] human life which will grant to him the
[56:16] ability to perpetuate and reproduce that
[56:19] human life the man actually by the
[56:22] breath of God becomes a soul alive soul
[56:27] now before that it was a soul the soul
[56:31] of Adam existed of course before this
[56:33] time but it was not a soul that was
[56:35] expressed to where it could choose right
[56:39] from wrong day and night
[56:41] darkness and light it could not choose
[56:43] it was in the attribute form of God but
[56:46] once breathed out of the very existence
[56:49] of God placed into a human body then the
[56:52] man now becomes in this dedicated
[56:54] position as being a living soul not just
[56:58] a living human being a living soul and
[57:02] the Lord God planted a garden eastward
[57:04] in Eden and there he put the man whom he
[57:07] had formed and out of the ground made
[57:10] the Lord God to grow every tree that is
[57:12] pleasant to the sight and good for food
[57:14] The Tree of Life also in the midst of
[57:18] the garden and the tree of knowledge of
[57:20] good and evil now here we have the man
[57:23] that is place a living soul man which is
[57:27] placed in a
[57:29] live garden except each of those lives
[57:34] are a little bit different the life of
[57:37] the beetle is different than the life of
[57:40] the animal and the life of the animal is
[57:43] different than the life of the fruit on
[57:46] the tree and the life of the fruit on
[57:48] the tree is a little bit different from
[57:50] the life of the vine that goes up the
[57:53] tree but they all come from one source
[57:56] right so you take the life of a vine
[58:00] that grows up and then you're trying to
[58:01] be able to transpose or move that life
[58:03] over into a tree you can't do it it
[58:06] won't live and so God made each life or
[58:09] this specie according to I'll you wanted
[58:11] it to grow in the beginning now here the
[58:14] man is a living human being but he's
[58:18] more than that he is a living soul
[58:21] aren't you glad you're living souls and
[58:23] I now think of it at this time there
[58:26] were no humans on the earth with a dead
[58:29] soul now you see the scripture that Paul
[58:35] wrote years and years later talking
[58:37] about the woman that lives in sin and
[58:40] said that she is dead while she live us
[58:43] could not been said in the Garden of
[58:46] Eden because there was no live human
[58:49] beings with dead souls dead nature your
[58:54] honor Sonam said now I'm talking about
[58:56] dead in trespasses and sin so there was
[59:00] none of that but it was a living soul
[59:03] and a living human being was perpetual
[59:06] life and his use of course was
[59:09] constantly going on now then of course
[59:11] God brought the woman out of another
[59:14] fall had come that way now notice in act
[59:16] 2 the fallen Genesis chapter 3 verse 22
[59:19] and the Lord God said Behold the man is
[59:22] become as one of us I know Trinitarian
[59:26] people like to take this scripture and
[59:28] try to prove this that there was more
[59:30] than one God there but you do not find
[59:32] the Bible in the English or the Hebrew
[59:35] saying he's such saying but God is
[59:37] actually speaking to the council in
[59:40] heaven
[59:41] he ain't speaking to no little boy and
[59:44] no Holy Ghost associate but he's talking
[59:49] to those beings which are the eternal
[59:51] attributes of the eternal there in
[59:54] heaven glory the man is become as one of
[59:58] us to know good and evil and now lest he
[1:00:01] put forth his hand and take also of the
[1:00:04] tree of life and eat and live forever
[1:00:07] therefore the Lord God sent him forth
[1:00:11] from the Garden of Eden to till the
[1:00:13] ground from whence he was taken now I
[1:00:15] know the law moves and the cycle of
[1:00:18] Adams members now he is alive but he
[1:00:22] starts feeling pain and he starts
[1:00:24] sweating and from the from the brow he
[1:00:27] starts getting outside and laboring and
[1:00:29] the productivity of the grant changes
[1:00:32] and now he's got a laborer and he's got
[1:00:34] to fight these mind battles of what he
[1:00:36] did how that he's brought all this upon
[1:00:39] the earth and the creation of God every
[1:00:42] day he gets up your nights and feeling
[1:00:44] aches and pains and before that time he
[1:00:46] felt absolutely nothing that happiness
[1:00:49] in the health and the goodness and mercy
[1:00:51] of God wow what a day what a time we're
[1:00:54] going back into is that right but now he
[1:00:57] goes to dealing with issues and he goes
[1:00:59] to feeling physical things and no doubt
[1:01:02] by the chain in order to really cover
[1:01:03] the scope of the Fallen human being he
[1:01:06] had all kinds of mind battles in his
[1:01:08] mind what will the consequence of what
[1:01:10] I've done what will it bring how long
[1:01:12] will this go well God let this go for a
[1:01:15] generation or two or three or how long
[1:01:18] will this go my Adam would have known
[1:01:21] there would have been billions and
[1:01:23] billions of people on the face of the
[1:01:25] earth all the sorrow and heartache and
[1:01:27] difficulty that he introduced to the
[1:01:30] world no doubt the man could not have
[1:01:31] taken it no doubt in his mind the battle
[1:01:35] that he must have fought and what he
[1:01:36] must have won through the sickness that
[1:01:38] he dealt was and the the difficulty of
[1:01:41] him and even and he noticed as he walked
[1:01:43] outside of the garden God
[1:01:45] I slammed the gate as it was behind him
[1:01:48] and put cherubims turning every way to
[1:01:50] protect the way back to the Tree of Life
[1:01:52] and Adam went out into the earth and he
[1:01:55] noticed the ours had now lost the
[1:01:57] brightness of the green and the hues of
[1:01:59] the Blues had been toned back and the
[1:02:02] water in lost an element of its
[1:02:04] brilliance in the side he noticed the
[1:02:06] Sun wasn't as bright I said was the day
[1:02:09] before never worried look everything
[1:02:12] seemed to be toned down the hues of the
[1:02:15] colors were not OMA they were noticed
[1:02:18] brilliant as they were before and even
[1:02:20] though he was still alive the day inside
[1:02:23] of him he did not feel as happy and as
[1:02:26] light and he just did not feel the same
[1:02:29] anymore
[1:02:31] oh my understand I understand don't you
[1:02:35] as we get up every day of our life and
[1:02:37] we look around and we see the darkness
[1:02:40] that surround us everywhere the sickness
[1:02:42] of pain the suffering the heartache the
[1:02:45] trouble all might seems that it takes
[1:02:47] away some of the brilliance of the blue
[1:02:49] and the skies in it it affects the green
[1:02:52] and the trees and the green in the grass
[1:02:54] but one day my brother sister the
[1:02:56] condition that absolutely affect us
[1:02:59] sharing life one day they'll all be
[1:03:01] taken away that will never be a sick
[1:03:04] person ever marched down those streets
[1:03:07] of cold they'll never be a baby born
[1:03:09] blind they'll never be a lame a halter
[1:03:13] crippled prize dog the Blues will be as
[1:03:16] brilliant as they were in the eternal
[1:03:18] the Pink's the yellows the greens all
[1:03:21] hallelujah the magnificence of our
[1:03:23] Father in the color spectrum that he
[1:03:26] created will be in a way that you and I
[1:03:28] can only dream about
[1:03:31] [Applause]
[1:03:37] notice in verse 24 so he drove out the
[1:03:45] man drove out the man God don't like to
[1:03:55] drive his people but we're so
[1:03:58] hard-headed so stubborn
[1:04:01] God don't want to drive you he wants to
[1:04:05] lead you but why do we do many times we
[1:04:10] forced God to drive us like dumb driven
[1:04:15] cattle instead of sheep well preach
[1:04:20] brother Donnie
[1:04:21] hey man brother Donnie I wanna see
[1:04:24] brother Donnie
[1:04:26] so he drove out the man and he placed at
[1:04:30] the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims
[1:04:34] and a flaming sword which turned every
[1:04:37] way to keep the way of the Tree of Life
[1:04:43] to keep the way showing that life and
[1:04:47] salvation would never again be embraced
[1:04:51] by man until the Justice and the
[1:04:54] judgment of God was met and what man did
[1:04:58] inside the garden impose the just
[1:05:00] judgment of God and the pronouncement of
[1:05:03] death and man will never eat of that
[1:05:06] tree of life until the judgment of God
[1:05:10] has been satisfied Lord children if you
[1:05:12] only understood what I just said if the
[1:05:15] judgment of God has spice over your soul
[1:05:18] and you have eternal life tonight and
[1:05:21] you are already eating on the Tree of
[1:05:23] Life
[1:05:24] you ought to be one of the happiest
[1:05:26] people that is alive in the world today
[1:05:29] it means the judgment of God has been
[1:05:32] met concerning your soul and the Justice
[1:05:36] of God was mad in the Lord Jesus and God
[1:05:40] accepts you and allows you to protect of
[1:05:44] the Tree of Life
[1:05:45] what the cherubims kept Adam from The
[1:05:49] Hungry Ghost is leading you to what a
[1:05:52] flaming sword kept Adam from the Holy
[1:05:56] Ghost day bad day bad day is leading us
[1:06:01] to the Tree of Life not only are we
[1:06:04] feeding on it but the prophet of God
[1:06:06] said the Tree of Life is blooming in us
[1:06:14] praise be to God notice it's better
[1:06:21] bitumen their message called the end
[1:06:22] time he said now then Cain came and
[1:06:25] knelt down built an altar I'd imagined a
[1:06:29] notice says they come to the east side
[1:06:32] of the gate for therefore the angel
[1:06:35] stood with this flaming sword guarding
[1:06:38] the Tree of Life by the way he was
[1:06:41] guarding the people away from the Tree
[1:06:45] of Life
[1:06:46] now he's here trying to drive people
[1:06:49] back to the Tree of Life well I'm glad
[1:06:53] he finally got through my hard head and
[1:06:55] drove me back notice Jesus was our tree
[1:06:59] of life the woman was a tree of dead
[1:07:01] were the fruit of our mother she was the
[1:07:03] fruit tree we come here by woman come
[1:07:06] death by the woman come rise he said
[1:07:08] which also brought forth the man Christ
[1:07:10] Jesus right
[1:07:12] Satan used a woman to bring dead God
[1:07:14] used a woman to bring it back amen
[1:07:16] notice all born of natural sexual that
[1:07:19] person has to die but the man that's
[1:07:21] born of the Spirit of God never does
[1:07:24] notice in the fusion church they say him
[1:07:27] but overcometh well I give to eat of the
[1:07:29] Tree of Life which is in the midst of
[1:07:30] the paradise of God what a thrilling
[1:07:32] thought this is that Tree of Life and
[1:07:35] the Garden of Eden which could not be
[1:07:37] approached him to because of the fall of
[1:07:40] Adam is now given to the overcomer the
[1:07:44] flaming sword of the guarding cherubim
[1:07:47] has been ceased but it was not she eros
[1:07:51] blood whoa my blade was bloody with the
[1:07:55] blood of the Lamb let us meditate upon
[1:07:58] this truth awhile as we consider why
[1:08:00] that tree was denied to Adam and his
[1:08:04] descendants but now allowed again please
[1:08:11] don't misunderstand me if you've got the
[1:08:13] Holy Ghost and now you're already
[1:08:15] farther back than Adam ever started I
[1:08:24] want to get further back there where
[1:08:25] Adam was was he fell from it I believe
[1:08:29] we're set good to not see about the Holy
[1:08:31] Ghost and of the presence of God we'll
[1:08:33] never get away from the seal of God oh
[1:08:42] praise God I love this God's intention
[1:08:47] for his creation man is to express his
[1:08:51] words and Genesis animus given the word
[1:08:54] to live by a life lived by the word
[1:08:59] would be the word expressed and you all
[1:09:04] want to know what you can do to be a
[1:09:06] Christian you want to know what you can
[1:09:08] do to be the Word of God live this word
[1:09:10] every day every day you live this word
[1:09:14] you are a written of hustle in this
[1:09:16] layout of same timeframe that we're in
[1:09:19] and you are expressing the world and
[1:09:21] that word will judge the people around
[1:09:23] you Oh mah alive will but the word will
[1:09:28] be the word expressed this is true is it
[1:09:30] not but get out of there but that word
[1:09:32] no because he will see live by every
[1:09:35] word and he failed to take heed to every
[1:09:37] word
[1:09:38] then there are rose Moses what a great
[1:09:40] mighty man he was yet he also failed to
[1:09:43] live by every word that prophet that
[1:09:45] type of the great prophet to come failed
[1:09:47] an anger to obey the word and there was
[1:09:50] also David the great king of Israel a
[1:09:53] man after God's own heart he failed by
[1:09:55] adultery when he was sent to well your
[1:09:58] name could be put in your as well filled
[1:09:59] life with me too and every prophet well
[1:10:02] we just go ahead and say it brother
[1:10:03] branham to by the venom failed brother
[1:10:06] Donnie's failed every one of us years
[1:10:08] fellows only one that didn't fail and
[1:10:10] that was Jesus mother Batam couldn't
[1:10:13] take the book Paul couldn't take the
[1:10:16] book only the lamb could take the book
[1:10:19] notices but eventually in the fullness
[1:10:22] of time there came on the head even
[1:10:25] Jesus who also must be tempted to see if
[1:10:29] he would live by every word that
[1:10:32] proceedeth out of the mouth of God this
[1:10:33] is why Jesus had to be tempted and try
[1:10:36] and test to this one thing to say oh
[1:10:39] yeah I can do it I can do it I can do it
[1:10:41] that's the only words but it's one more
[1:10:44] test that is one we prove our words so
[1:10:47] God had to learn to be tested by women
[1:10:50] Jesus was tempted by drinking Jesus was
[1:10:53] tempted in every part is we are yet
[1:10:56] without sin he had to prove what he was
[1:10:59] talking about did he prove it well
[1:11:03] praise God whose couldn't be honest he
[1:11:05] proved what I couldn't he proved what
[1:11:08] you could but since he proved it I don't
[1:11:11] have to prove it he's already proved it
[1:11:12] so I prove I believe him by the way that
[1:11:15] I live and that his life without of me
[1:11:17] that he proves his own words fill
[1:11:20] amen notice he says then was Satan
[1:11:24] foiled for you must one who live by it
[1:11:27] is written and that masterpiece of God
[1:11:30] overcame by reflecting God's word every
[1:11:34] word there wasn't one sentence that was
[1:11:36] not one diphthong there was not one
[1:11:37] letter that Jesus left undone that was
[1:11:40] not one commandment that he broke you
[1:11:42] hear me church that was not one promise
[1:11:45] in God's Word
[1:11:47] that he ever broke he kept God's Word he
[1:11:52] was without sin notice them when this
[1:11:55] manifested perfect one given to the
[1:11:58] cross as the perfect Lamb of God for the
[1:12:01] perfect sacrifice and on the tree
[1:12:04] received the wounds unto death that we
[1:12:06] by him and because of him might eat of
[1:12:10] the tree of life then that life freely
[1:12:14] given would enable us to overcome and
[1:12:19] express the Word of God this is why
[1:12:22] people can't live right in this day this
[1:12:24] is why because I want to I want to I
[1:12:28] want to want to rain enough you've got
[1:12:31] to get the life of the tree in you Oh
[1:12:36] glory to God hallelujah oh ma notice
[1:12:43] this brother on Spencer I think of us
[1:12:45] read this quote over to Ruth Smeaton's
[1:12:46] this week and I just thought it was an
[1:12:48] outstanding quote I want to share it
[1:12:49] with you tonight I'd like to take a
[1:12:51] little trip and we'll go again we'll go
[1:12:53] up to the great Archangel Gabriel who is
[1:12:56] the messenger of the Covenant of the
[1:12:58] Jewish people who stands at the right
[1:13:00] hand of God one of the highest order of
[1:13:02] angels in the heaven and I would say to
[1:13:05] him Gabriel thou art a mighty angel you
[1:13:08] are loved of God you have been here for
[1:13:11] ions of time and you perhaps know
[1:13:16] everything in the heavens where
[1:13:19] everything is placed because you're one
[1:13:22] of God's right hand angels and you know
[1:13:25] the great
[1:13:25] secrets of the heavens you sounded the
[1:13:29] trumpet of the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:13:30] you announce his first coming and you
[1:13:32] shall announce his second coming so you
[1:13:35] must be a mighty man or a mighty angel I
[1:13:38] wanna ask you on all of God's treasures
[1:13:44] what is the greatest thing you have
[1:13:47] found among God's treasures I can see
[1:13:55] Gabriel bring himself to attention and
[1:13:57] say the greatest thing I have found in
[1:14:01] God's treasure since he created me yes
[1:14:07] [Music]
[1:14:12] [Applause]
[1:14:15] God made me to live for eternal for
[1:14:21] eternity life it's the greatest thing
[1:14:26] there is it's amazing how many message
[1:14:33] people don't believe that I always find
[1:14:37] it so amazing whenever someone dies in a
[1:14:39] family a husband a wife a mother a
[1:14:42] father and all ma the people were crying
[1:14:45] lament and they just you feel so sorry
[1:14:48] for them because a lot of it's true
[1:14:50] crocodile tears you know that but a lot
[1:14:52] of it is real and it's genuine but they
[1:14:55] make no plans to spend eternity with
[1:14:59] that same person they're standing here
[1:15:02] crying over now and they'll cry and get
[1:15:06] depressed and have to get on uppers and
[1:15:08] downers and inners and outers to help
[1:15:10] them to deal with the death of that body
[1:15:12] and yet they make no preparation to live
[1:15:16] eternally was that individual which they
[1:15:19] say they love so much I'm sorry I just
[1:15:22] don't understand it
[1:15:23] and looks like to me if you really love
[1:15:25] them that much you'd want to go where
[1:15:27] they are well praise gone come on now
[1:15:31] Saints you would want to be where they
[1:15:34] are but it proves a lot of people do not
[1:15:37] they miss them in time and they miss
[1:15:39] what they know about an entire man
[1:15:41] that's as far as they go but to a real
[1:15:44] attribute of God life is a wonderful
[1:15:47] thing life is a blessing of God but not
[1:15:50] just human life not just the ability for
[1:15:53] us to perpetuate human life and pass our
[1:15:56] genes on and then pass it on down to
[1:15:58] another generation and another
[1:15:59] generation another generation all that
[1:16:01] will eventually die it will eventually
[1:16:04] come to an end
[1:16:05] oh ma and then we don't make hardly any
[1:16:08] preparation for eternal life people just
[1:16:12] get all stressed out of faith to go to
[1:16:14] church once a week oh wow the red skins
[1:16:24] will be playing about the time brother
[1:16:26] Donny's preaching
[1:16:27] wonder if I could stream it on my phone
[1:16:30] while he's preaching NASCAR will be
[1:16:35] going on at Bristol about the time he
[1:16:37] gets in the pool pig you better be
[1:16:39] worried about the other fire instead of
[1:16:41] NASCAR but people make so much
[1:16:46] preparation for their hole and then for
[1:16:48] the retirement and for what you know I
[1:16:50] want people to think well of me but what
[1:16:52] about life what about preparation for
[1:16:56] eternal I'm not sure I gotta think about
[1:16:59] it
[1:17:00] so I'm starving to death tonight okay
[1:17:03] I'm so thirsty
[1:17:05] I'm so thirsty I can hardly make it I
[1:17:08] think I can hardly go and here's this
[1:17:12] bottle of
[1:17:24] I'm thinking about it

[1:17:46] faulty fighter and there's all kinds of
[1:17:50] stuff injured I might kill me well

[1:18:06] perfect
[1:18:09] well this for the sake of your argument
[1:18:12] what if I am what if brother branham was
[1:18:17] a hundred and seventy five percent long
[1:18:19] and a hundred and seventy five percent

[1:18:25] brought me to a disadvantage

[1:25:53] notices Gabriel says the greatest thing
[1:25:57] I found in God's treasures you imagine
[1:26:01] all the treasures birthmark that Gabriel
[1:26:04] has seen all of the things he's heard
[1:26:09] took off and Gabriel would say the
[1:26:14] greatest singer but brother Donny that's
[1:26:16] only brother branham's word for that as
[1:26:21] I said I'll take his word you think you
[1:26:25] can argue me out of it you're crazier
[1:26:29] now thought you was we only have one
[1:26:32] man's word that wrote Genesis but I'll
[1:26:37] take his word for
[1:26:39] when God made me to live for eternal for
[1:26:43] eternity life is the greatest sin camry
[1:26:46] as i said this afternoon this afternoon
[1:26:49] i wanted to speak on the greatest gift
[1:26:52] in the bible and how many in the
[1:26:54] audience this afternoon could think of
[1:26:55] any greater gift than God is given to
[1:26:57] man then eternal life there is not one
[1:27:03] gift that could be given greater than
[1:27:07] life I'm sick and tired of Holy Ghost
[1:27:12] feel Christians looking down on their
[1:27:15] eternal life as if it's second-rate
[1:27:18] compared to speaking in tongues or
[1:27:21] shouting or jumping or running all
[1:27:24] that's good and wonderful the greatest
[1:27:26] gift God can give you is not to see
[1:27:28] visions not to dream dreams not to
[1:27:32] prophesy not to speak in tongues the
[1:27:35] greatest gift God can give you is
[1:27:37] eternal life speaking in tongues is
[1:27:43] wonderful but we won't be done in heaven
[1:27:46] seeing visions is wonderful but we won't
[1:27:49] be done in heaven prophesy is wonderful
[1:27:52] but we won't be doing it in heaven but
[1:27:56] we will have this gift and heaven
[1:27:58] eternal life
[1:28:00] [Applause]
[1:28:06] there is not one gift that could be
[1:28:08] given greater than life life is that
[1:28:10] sublime sublime gift it's the greatest
[1:28:17] of all gifts for where there is alive oh
[1:28:22] my there is joy and God alone has
[1:28:26] eternal listen pardon me while I finish
[1:28:46] my eternal life oh praise God help
[1:29:02] refreshing hyper fresh thing it is and
[1:29:06] you got a hearing Laodicea you wore out
[1:29:08] and exhausted and tired dealing with the
[1:29:12] issues of life were able to come to
[1:29:15] church on Wednesday night or Saturday
[1:29:16] night or Sunday morning pray he's God
[1:29:20] and the Lord sets a big old refresh and
[1:29:23] dose of Holy Ghost eternal I thought in
[1:29:25] front of us we go to drink in it in
[1:29:27] praise God it revitalizes don't it
[1:29:32] oh yes it brings strength and brings
[1:29:35] health and encouragement thank God
[1:29:40] let me reach a few scriptures shed
[1:29:42] before we go some 1611 that will show me
[1:29:46] the path of life in that presence is
[1:29:51] fullness of joy at thy right hand there
[1:29:54] are pleasures forevermore Psalm 36 9 for
[1:29:59] with thee is the Fountain of Life in thy
[1:30:03] light shall we see light proverbs 6:23
[1:30:06] for the commandment is a lamp under and
[1:30:10] lamp and the law is light and reproofs
[1:30:13] are
[1:30:14] instruction are the way of life father's
[1:30:18] 10 11 the mouse of a righteous man is a
[1:30:24] whale of life this st. Just's over the
[1:30:30] preacher this is what God wants everyone
[1:30:33] of you believers to be now if you're
[1:30:36] spilling out gossip and this and that
[1:30:37] and the other than your mouth ain't a
[1:30:39] well of life it's a trash mouth it's a
[1:30:42] garbage mouth well praise God
[1:30:45] but the mouse your match of what a
[1:30:47] miracle that is the mouse of a righteous
[1:30:51] man is a whale it ain't just a bottle of
[1:30:56] Gatorade it's a whale it is a whale of
[1:31:02] life but violence covers the mouths of
[1:31:05] the wicked proverbs 15 for a wholesome
[1:31:09] tongue is a tree of life so now we've
[1:31:20] got the well and we've got the tree back
[1:31:24] in the man again a wholesome tongue why
[1:31:34] how in the world could any of us have a
[1:31:36] wholesome tongue when a human turn you
[1:31:39] set on fire of hell tell what James said
[1:31:46] don't make some big up bug eyes at me
[1:31:49] do you realize what a miracle you are -
[1:31:51] not if you have a wholesome tongue now
[1:31:56] some folks have a whole lot of tongue
[1:31:57] but it ain't wholesome
[1:32:00] I don't want to hold on I want to hold
[1:32:03] someone well I'm gonna let you go if I
[1:32:07] get killed here a wholesome tongue it's
[1:32:09] a tree of life but perverse this therian
[1:32:12] is a breach in the spirit you're not 21
[1:32:15] 8 and into this people thou shalt say
[1:32:17] that saith the Lord behold I set before
[1:32:20] you the way of life and the way of death
[1:32:26] John 6:35 and jesus saith unto them I am
[1:32:30] the bread of life he that cometh to me
[1:32:35] shall never hunger and he that believeth
[1:32:37] on me shall never thirst look what he's
[1:32:43] open to us children the bread of life
[1:32:46] the tree of life the book of life the
[1:32:49] way of life the path of life the light
[1:32:51] of life right here at your disposal and
[1:32:57] Laodicea if you can imagine in your mind
[1:33:00] we're in the middle of this dark chaos
[1:33:03] all this filth debauchery violence
[1:33:05] murder everywhere around us all this
[1:33:08] don't you understand what all this is
[1:33:09] all this violence it's preceding the
[1:33:12] tribulation people are getting under the
[1:33:14] tribulation anointing
[1:33:15] it's a pre-tribulation anointing of
[1:33:18] murder and killing and violence and they
[1:33:22] watch all these video games and they
[1:33:24] watch all these movies and read all
[1:33:26] these stories and get on all these
[1:33:28] websites of all these violence come on
[1:33:30] brother Donny
[1:33:32] you can make all the gun laws you want
[1:33:35] to we need to start making some laws
[1:33:36] against Hollywood Hollywood's the one
[1:33:39] that's run in their minds and all this
[1:33:41] music come on Saints oh yeah that's
[1:33:46] free expression they called it yeah
[1:33:47] that's why the downfall of our nation
[1:33:50] Satan knew he knew our founding fathers
[1:33:52] by founding it they did not have a clue
[1:33:54] what it would lead to the defamation of
[1:33:57] our nation in the end time but they're
[1:33:58] able to do all these things and say all
[1:34:01] these things cop killers and this and
[1:34:03] that and the other and their songs come
[1:34:05] on they can say all that in their songs
[1:34:07] but it'll come to pass if a preacher
[1:34:09] stands up and preaches against
[1:34:11] homosexual marriage to be thrown in jail
[1:34:14] why because they've got every right but
[1:34:16] we don't have not well let me say it
[1:34:19] this way we don't have much and Laodicea
[1:34:21] but I've still got a right to preach the
[1:34:23] truth as far as God's concern
[1:34:29] one set for tolerance tolerance
[1:34:31] tolerance love and an amazing how that
[1:34:34] tolerance works for everybody but those
[1:34:36] who believe the truth
[1:34:40] [Applause]
[1:34:41] so China San Fran it's at anointing of
[1:34:44] the pre-tribulation it's getting upon
[1:34:46] the people why because the foolish
[1:34:49] virgin will be hunted down like dogs
[1:34:51] that killing murdering thing you've
[1:34:54] heard it this week but one of the big
[1:34:56] networks was introducing a new drug new
[1:34:58] television a movie thing and it was
[1:35:00] these leftists as hunting the
[1:35:01] conservative people called the hunt yeah
[1:35:05] so you got to lift just going out on
[1:35:07] hunts and they're hunting conservative
[1:35:09] people with rifles and there was so much
[1:35:11] kick back that they decided to pull it
[1:35:14] but you see the mindset is there the
[1:35:18] mindset is already there to get rid of
[1:35:21] people that have morals to get rid of
[1:35:23] people that still say male and female
[1:35:25] Pam and her come on church so she could
[1:35:30] cry on me if I come out in the middle of
[1:35:35] the street and there's a hole there I'm
[1:35:37] gonna call it a manhole I'm sorry if
[1:35:39] that offends you it ain't an air hole
[1:35:44] it's a manhole man power God was a man
[1:35:48] I'm a man and I know it
[1:35:51] I like wondering if I was a girl oh I
[1:35:54] wonder if I'm a woman I don't know who
[1:35:56] is I was a man
[1:35:58] praise the Lord God made me a man I want
[1:36:01] to remain a man oh lord have mercy thank
[1:36:04] God for the truth but what is it it's a
[1:36:08] lien tolerance of the tribulation period
[1:36:14] raise God and what I just said to you is
[1:36:18] classified as hate they can call us all
[1:36:27] kinds the name say all kinds of things
[1:36:28] the batter's ridiculed us make fun of us
[1:36:30] and nearly kill us but it's for
[1:36:33] expression well a man don't you love him
[1:36:41] with all your heart aren't you glad you
[1:36:43] have
[1:36:46] most of us never have to worry about the
[1:36:48] building being full of money even your
[1:36:51] Pew you ain't gonna worry about your
[1:36:52] pube in a bowl of money some of you
[1:36:53] ain't got your pocket full much there's
[1:36:55] anything else but aren't you glad you
[1:36:57] know what God's greatest of all gifts is
[1:37:04] but the jack we've got it eternal life
[1:37:08] eternal life we can never die now tell
[1:37:15] me your body now your body and God
[1:37:16] eternal not but your soul has eternal
[1:37:18] life
[1:37:22] let's bow our heads together thank you
[1:37:26] Lord Jesus
[1:37:27] Oh Heavenly Father thank you for your
[1:37:31] words tonight Lord we're reminded of the
[1:37:35] words Lord Jesus of your apostle that
[1:37:39] day whenever some of your disciples
[1:37:43] turned and walked away and followed
[1:37:45] after you no more and you turn to the
[1:37:49] twelve and said does this offend you you
[1:37:53] also want to leave and Peter said Lord
[1:37:58] to whom would we go you have the words
[1:38:03] of eternal life I find it so amazing
[1:38:08] that Peter had already recognized
[1:38:11] eternal life laid in the Rhema words of
[1:38:16] Jesus only praise God he had his faults
[1:38:21] but he sure had some understanding Lord
[1:38:25] we say the same thing tonight
[1:38:27] some people folks going this way some
[1:38:30] folks gone that way some ain't sure if I
[1:38:32] wanted to turn a life they kind of grab
[1:38:34] a hold of it and set it down and would
[1:38:36] not be poisoned well I didn't ban it
[1:38:38] might not be more what I can do I don't
[1:38:41] know some grab the hold of it well I'll
[1:38:45] change my mind but we still say what we
[1:38:48] started saying years ago you have the
[1:38:51] words to return alive where could we go
[1:38:56] so if we had all the gold of the world
[1:38:58] all the silver all the pearls all the
[1:39:01] diamonds there was all at our exposing
[1:39:04] yet we laid here and a coffin what could
[1:39:09] what he does
[1:39:10] if we owned a fleet a fleet of the
[1:39:15] greatest automobiles that were ever made
[1:39:18] but yet we were in a casket dead what
[1:39:23] good would it do so life is the greatest
[1:39:29] of HO gifts and I wonder how many of us
[1:39:33] Christians get up every day and don't
[1:39:36] even thank you when we live that day for
[1:39:38] another day of life we drop and complain
[1:39:43] because we had these problems and these
[1:39:45] headaches and but I wonder how many
[1:39:47] people in hell would rather be alive
[1:39:50] with all the problems of life than they
[1:39:53] went down there in the regions of the
[1:39:55] lost help us father no matter how hard
[1:39:59] it is may there not be a day go by that
[1:40:03] we do not give you thanks for another
[1:40:06] day of life how many sisters are tonight
[1:40:13] Lord or brothers who their companion has
[1:40:16] gone on or a child a father a mother
[1:40:21] what would they give for an hour a day
[1:40:25] what would they give for a week to be
[1:40:29] able to call that husband back just for
[1:40:32] him to put their arm back around their
[1:40:35] shoulders again and sit down and eat
[1:40:36] with them again what would they give
[1:40:39] probably everything they own because
[1:40:42] that would mean more than their
[1:40:44] possessions so lord help us while we
[1:40:48] have our husbands our wives our children
[1:40:50] our loved ones help us father instead of
[1:40:54] marginalizing on what we differ on help
[1:40:58] us to appreciate those that's in our
[1:41:01] families in our church family as I heard
[1:41:04] the song the other day Lord that we

[1:59:32] billions of people praying at the same
[1:59:34] time and you met billions of needs at
[1:59:37] the same time it would not have
