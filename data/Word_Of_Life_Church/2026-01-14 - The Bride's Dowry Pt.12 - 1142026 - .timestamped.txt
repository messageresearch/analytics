[11:21] His granddaughters are sick due to the
[11:24] virus. His wife is scraped, bruised, and
[11:26] sore from a recent fall. Brother Jim is
[11:28] still dealing with numbness in his
[11:30] hands, which is now affecting other
[11:31] parts of his body, making it very
[11:34] difficult for him to work on his job or

[12:11] in prayer. Sister Janet will remember
[12:12] you and your family in prayer as well as
[12:15] you had your son's service, I guess, on

[12:19] people that have lost loved ones
[12:21] recently that God would just uh comfort
[12:24] their hearts and be with them. Brother
[12:26] Fred Perry got to go home from the

[12:52] recovery is greatly appreciated. So, we
[12:54] want to remember those folks tonight as

[12:58] requests. I know there's tremendous

[13:01] that we're serving a God that's never
[13:04] never never
[13:05] turned his back on the needs of his
[13:07] children. May not come when we think it
[13:10] ought to, but he always gives us exactly
[13:12] what we need. Do you believe that?
[13:14] Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."

[30:00] Came down from his glory and gave us
[30:03] [music] his victory. [singing] The
[30:05] greatest love story.
[30:08] [music]
[30:41] hadn't been this excited to sing in a
[30:44] long time. [music]
[30:46] I for [clears throat]
[30:48] weeks I had been praying, Lord, just
[30:49] give me I hadn't been able to find a
[30:52] song to sing. It felt like it'd been
[30:54] three years since I had found one, and
[30:56] it had only been a couple weeks.
[30:59] And I was driving home and it was just
[31:01] me and Jude and we was driving on it was
[31:04] a Tuesday night and I found the song and
[31:07] he said, "Daddy, I like this song." I
[31:10] said, "I think I like this song, too."
[31:11] And then Wednesday night, the service
[31:15] solidified this song to me. And before I
[31:18] got to the truck, I text Louie. I said,
[31:20] "I got you a song." Most time is the
[31:22] other way around. Usually he says, "You
[31:25] got a song." And I really just have to
[31:27] make one up. But I told him I got him a
[31:29] song and it might only bless me, but I
[31:33] hope it blesses somebody tonight. And I
[31:34] hope you just help me worship him.
[31:38] [music]
[31:40] There's a story [singing] in the Bible
[31:44] that I need [music] to hear. When I
[31:47] showed my [singing] doubt, my future
[31:51] [music] is not clear.
[31:53] The disciples they [singing]
[31:55] were walking
[31:57] with the son [music] of man and he asked
[32:00] a simple question. Who do people say I
[32:05] am? Some [music] say you [singing] are
[32:07] Elijah
[32:09] or father.
[32:12] Some say John Baptist [music]
[32:15] back to life.
[32:19] [music]
[32:21] Jesus [singing] asked, "How about you?"
[32:25] If [music] I have [singing] been, I said
[32:29] the same.
[32:31] You [music] are the Christ, the one who
[32:35] is to [music] come. [singing]
[32:38] You are
[32:41] his one and only [singing] son, [music]
[32:44] the hope of my salvation,
[32:47] the rock on which I stand.
[32:50] Heat. Heat. Heat. [music]
[33:00] [music]
[33:03] to [singing]
[33:04] [music]
[33:06] the street
[33:09] [music]
[33:10] and their castles
[33:15] still asking [music] us
[33:20] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[33:20] &gt;&gt; I
[33:22] [music]
[33:29] [music]
[33:30] Christ
[33:32] is to come. [music]
[33:34] You are
[33:38] one and only son. The hope of my
[33:42] salvation.
[33:44] The rock on which I stand. You are, you
[33:49] are, [music] you are
[33:53] the one who is to come. The lion and the
[33:58] lamb. [music] I am.
[34:02] I am. [singing]
[34:06] Who stole [music] the sting of death,
[34:09] who died and rose again. I am. [music]
[34:18] You're setting captives free
[34:22] of victory. [music]
[34:24] I am
[34:27] I am
[34:30] forever. [singing]
[34:31] I will sing.
[34:36] [music]
[34:41] Ever I will [singing] sing. You [music]
[34:43] are the Christ. The one [singing] who is
[34:48] to come. You are
[34:52] God's [music] one [singing] and only
[34:54] son. The hope of my salvation.
[34:58] The rock of [music] eternity.
[35:02] You are You are You are
[35:08] You [music] are the Christ, the one who
[35:12] is to come. [music] You are Messiah,
[35:17] one and [singing] only son, the hope of
[35:21] my salvation, [music]
[35:23] the rock on which I stand.
[35:28] You are. You [music] are.
[35:32] Are you
[35:35] [music]
[35:41] [applause]
[35:48] Maybe Jude needs to help pick out his
[35:50] songs from now on.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How many knows there's
[35:56] great [clears throat] inspiration that
[35:59] can comes from songs and from singing?
[36:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; Remember the old prophet when he
[36:05] couldn't get a word from the Lord and
[36:07] they brought a minstrel to him and begin
[36:09] to play and all of a sudden the spirit
[36:12] of God came on him. The prophet also
[36:15] tells us that whenever Israel would go
[36:17] out for war, you know what they'd send
[36:20] first? It wasn't the donut truck and it
[36:23] wasn't coffee, but it was the singers.
[36:27] The singers. You imagine what a time
[36:29] they must have had in the days of David.
[36:31] They had David, the great psalmist, the
[36:33] songwriter. They had Asaf as SA PH,
[36:38] which was also another songwriter. They
[36:42] had all these different sons of all
[36:44] these different songwriters. It must
[36:46] have been something. I didn't get to
[36:48] hear them then, but I'm longing for the
[36:50] time when I can hear him.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Won't it be something when we all gather
[36:54] together at that great time? Praise the
[36:57] Lord. Trust you well tonight.
[36:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; Fighting the devil.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Winning.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Wasn't as many of you said yes.
[37:08] Let's turn tonight to Jude chapter 1
[37:11] verse4.
[37:13] Praise the Lord. We're so happy to be
[37:16] together tonight.
[37:18] [clears throat] Just looking looking
[37:21] forward to what the Lord's got for us in
[37:22] the service.
[37:26] Remember now, we're still speaking about
[37:28] the bride's dowy.
[37:30] [clears throat and cough]
[37:32] And in this dowy is what the father
[37:35] um would give to the bride that would
[37:39] make her life better once she entered
[37:42] into matrimony
[37:44] also in her journey to her husband.
[37:48] [clears throat] And listen to this. It
[37:49] might seem odd to you till you get into
[37:51] it a little bit.
[37:53] Verse four. For there are certain men
[37:55] crept in unawares
[37:58] who were before of old ordained to this
[38:01] condemnation.
[38:03] Ordained of old to this condemnation.
[38:08] Ungodly men
[38:12] turning the grace of our God into
[38:15] lasciviousness.
[38:18] Well, if they are ungodly men, what in
[38:21] the world have they got to do with
[38:24] grace?
[38:26] Why are they even talking about grace?
[38:29] Why are they dealing with grace? And
[38:32] they're going to have such influence
[38:35] that they will be able to turn the grace
[38:37] of God around into lasciviousness.
[38:43] Must be some powerful men
[38:46] turning the grace of our God into
[38:48] lasciviousness, denying the only Lord
[38:51] God and our Lord Jesus Christ. I will
[38:55] therefore put you in remembrance, though
[38:58] you once knew this, how that the Lord
[39:02] having saved the people out of the land
[39:03] of Egypt, afterward
[39:06] destroyed them that believe not.
[39:10] So they were saved and then they were
[39:13] lost
[39:15] after being saved.
[39:18] Wow,
[39:24] brother Tony, what about us? Well, we've
[39:27] got to have a seal on our soul that way.
[39:30] Once you get that, that's when I believe
[39:33] once in grace, always in grace.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; There we go.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Until you get the Holy Ghost, you add
[39:38] all the way in. Now watch in verse six.
[39:41] Now he's going to run a parallel of what
[39:43] God did to the children of Israel and
[39:45] bring them out of the land of Egypt and
[39:46] then later destroyed them. And the
[39:49] angels which kept not their first
[39:52] estate,
[39:53] but left their own habitation,
[39:56] he hath reserved an everlasting chains
[40:00] under darkness
[40:02] unto the judgment
[40:04] of the great day. How many like to be
[40:08] remembered tonight as we pray? Amen. I
[40:10] heard part of the prayer request that
[40:12] Brother Louie was sharing. A lot of
[40:14] folks sick. A lot of folks got a
[40:15] different bunch of needs and in their
[40:18] body. And um Brother Daryl had went up
[40:22] to Pennsylvania to preach and they put
[40:25] him in a a bed and breakfast. And he had
[40:27] his arms full of his stuff as he was
[40:30] going in. And whenever he walked through
[40:33] the hallway, there was a step there and
[40:36] he missed that step. not but about four
[40:38] inches maybe something like that but
[40:41] when he did he pulled a muscle like in
[40:42] the groin area and it's really really
[40:45] causing a lot of problems and um he's
[40:49] kind of catered to it I guess in the
[40:51] last week or so and it's caused in his
[40:53] back to kind of go back out but we're
[40:56] believing God tonight that he's going to
[40:57] move for our brother
[40:59] &gt;&gt; he's in a lot of pain today and just
[41:01] really suffering we want the Lord How
[41:03] many is going to believe together
[41:06] &gt;&gt; amen in your need and request as well.
[41:09] [clears throat]
[41:09] Heavenly Father, as we bow our heads in
[41:12] your divine presence, we want you to
[41:14] know how grateful we are that we can
[41:17] come together, Lord Jesus, on a
[41:18] Wednesday night. We're so grateful,
[41:21] Father, that you have provided a way of
[41:24] of of fellowship and salvation, a way
[41:29] that we could come into your divine
[41:31] presence as Gentiles. Lord, at one time
[41:35] we were counted without the commonwealth
[41:37] of Israel. We were dogs, outcasts, but
[41:40] today we sit in heavenly places in
[41:43] Christ Jesus. And we are so thankful for
[41:46] that opportunity.
[41:48] We never want to darken these doors or
[41:50] any other church where we would visit
[41:52] and take it for granted. Lord, we want
[41:54] you to know we appreciate it so very
[41:57] much. Thank you for the songs tonight,
[42:00] Lord, the worship. And we just pray now
[42:02] that you'd help us in this further part
[42:04] of the service. Lord, you heard all the
[42:06] requests that Brother Louie read and
[42:08] maybe there's others that didn't get to
[42:10] turn in their their need and their
[42:12] request. And then, Father, mentioning
[42:14] Brother Daryl, you see this need in his
[42:16] back, Lord. And he's had such a a time
[42:19] with it. And Father, this fall that he
[42:21] had, I pray the spirit of God would just
[42:23] move for our brother tonight supposed to
[42:26] be down with brother Wadeale and and the
[42:28] Saints down in Georgia this weekend. is
[42:30] really going to need your touch to help
[42:32] him to be able to go. Also, Father, this
[42:35] prayer call that I have in my hand for
[42:37] our dear sister, dear God, we're praying
[42:39] in the name of Jesus that you just move
[42:41] forward, Lord. Touch our sister, bring
[42:43] healing and deliverance into her body.
[42:45] We pray in the name of Jesus. And the
[42:49] saints said,
[42:50] &gt;&gt; "Amen." [clears throat]
[42:53] &gt;&gt; And the saints said,
[42:54] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Okay, good. I thought y'all weren't
[42:58] going to say amen on me tonight. So,
[42:59] good. I guess you are, right?
[43:02] God bless you. You can be uh you can be
[43:05] seated.
[43:18] So, Elelliana passed out song service.
[43:20] Okay. All right. Let's pray for
[43:23] Elelliana if you don't mind. my
[43:24] granddaughter. They said Elelliana
[43:26] passed out um during the song service.
[43:30] [clears throat]
[43:31] Heavenly Father, you see this need in
[43:33] Ellie's body. Lord God, we just ask you
[43:36] right now in the name of Jesus that
[43:39] you'd come to her. Father, you see what
[43:41] caused this Lord, I just rebuke it in
[43:44] the name of Jesus Christ. May whatever
[43:46] it is a believer now father in Jesus
[43:49] name we just believe all things will be
[43:52] made well Lord in Jesus name. Amen.
[43:56] Praise the Lord.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Now of all the gifts that God has given
[44:00] to us as his people and I have got a
[44:03] list of them that I hope the Lord lets
[44:05] me go through before [clears throat] I
[44:07] leave all all of this. And we could
[44:10] start of course with salvation. We could
[44:12] start with uh being redeemed. We could
[44:15] start with reconciliation.
[44:18] So many awesome, wonderful things that
[44:20] the Lord has done for us as individuals.
[44:22] And we all have our priorities, of
[44:24] course, as far as what we would rank
[44:27] that would be the highest. And I think
[44:28] any of us would say it would be the
[44:31] Lord's blood and his love and his mercy
[44:33] and his grace. Then we'd come on down
[44:36] and we would come to our own our own
[44:38] portion of the spirit of God, which is
[44:41] his life that he's shared with us. And
[44:43] then for those of us that are married
[44:45] and we have a wonderful spouse, we would
[44:47] come to them. If you have children,
[44:49] you'd list them. Grandchildren, friends,
[44:52] relatives, neighbors, uh people we go to
[44:54] church with. There would be so many
[44:56] things that we would list that and we
[45:00] would give praise and honor to the Lord.
[45:03] And I think that we should actually give
[45:05] him praise for all those things. And
[45:07] these things are gifts that the father
[45:09] has given to us out of his great love.
[45:12] Some of them are natural. Some of them
[45:14] are more spiritual than natural. But
[45:16] yet, they all come from a heavenly
[45:18] father that has such great love and
[45:20] concern for us. But I'd also like to
[45:23] point in the direction tonight of
[45:26] another great gift that was given to us
[45:30] by our loving father that was so
[45:33] essential for us to be able to culminate
[45:37] in us being what he wanted us to be. And
[45:41] that gift is a prophet. Now, we thank
[45:44] God for pastors. We thank God for
[45:46] evangelists, teachers, missionaries,
[45:50] apostles. We thank God for every aspect
[45:53] of the five-fold ministry. But oh, as I
[45:56] look in this last day and the more we go
[45:59] on and the darkness as it's penetrating
[46:02] all around us everywhere in politics and
[46:04] religion and school and education and
[46:07] you know every every avenue that we look
[46:09] at and it makes me so appreciate that
[46:13] God gave us in this age now think in the
[46:17] in the first church age they also in
[46:20] their dowy chest they had a great
[46:22] prophetic gift and that prophet's name
[46:24] was Paul and God had so blessed that
[46:27] first church age. He gave them Peter,
[46:30] Andrew, Bartholomew, Matthew, Mark,
[46:32] Luke, John, different brothers that was
[46:34] there. And they done a great job. But
[46:36] oh, what would the New Testament church
[46:38] had been if it had not been for the
[46:41] Apostle Paul? How they must have thanked
[46:44] God for the Apostle Paul because God so
[46:47] enlightened him to write things Peter
[46:50] never touched. Matthew never touched
[46:52] because he was not a prophet. Peter, as
[46:55] great a man as he was, yet Paul had
[46:57] insight that went so far beyond anything
[47:00] that Peter ever saw. And yet Peter was
[47:02] very essential in the move of God. Then
[47:05] we come down to the second church age,
[47:07] no prophet. Third church age, no major
[47:10] prophet. Fourth church age, fifth church
[47:13] age, sixth church age, no major prophet.
[47:16] What do we have? Reformers. Men that
[47:19] love God. men that loved the church, men
[47:22] that were called of God to do everything
[47:24] they could. But God knew in the seventh
[47:27] church age that the darkness would be so
[47:30] great on the earth in the last days
[47:32] because he prophesied that it would that
[47:35] it would take more than just pastors to
[47:38] be able to go and pray and seek God and
[47:41] have a revival and see if they could get
[47:44] some evangelists to come in and see what
[47:46] they could do to stir the church up. God
[47:49] knew it would take a mighty great move.
[47:52] And he also knew that there was certain
[47:55] things that was mysteries which is only
[47:58] given to a certain class in the
[48:00] five-fold ministry and that is a
[48:03] prophetic class. So God knew that he's
[48:06] going to wait and and send this prophet
[48:08] in the very last age because there'll be
[48:11] so many things that God will have on his
[48:14] heart in his mind that he wants to
[48:17] convey to his bride. And it won't just
[48:19] be something that he'll be sharing just
[48:21] a bunch of theology, but it'll be
[48:24] something so essential and so necessary
[48:27] for her to be able to have her face and
[48:31] her heart restored back to that original
[48:34] promise of God. And if God does not send
[48:37] Elijah according to Malachi 4, he would
[48:41] destroy the earth.
[48:44] Lest I come and smite the earth with a
[48:49] curse.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Where would you and I be tonight if it
[48:53] was not for God sending us a prophet
[48:56] with a message?
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Where would the world be? Well, I'll
[49:00] tell you, they they don't appreciate it.
[49:02] They don't like it. A lot of them hate
[49:03] it. They don't want nothing to do with
[49:05] it. But once God winds up this last age
[49:09] and completes the fulfilling ministry of
[49:13] Malachi 4, then they will look and
[49:16] realize what it kept off of them. The
[49:19] darkness, the powers of hell and all
[49:22] that this message is keeping away. It's
[49:25] terrible now, but you just wait till the
[49:27] bride is gone. They ain't seen nothing
[49:29] yet what it's going to be. You believe
[49:31] that? But now notice with that comes
[49:34] great spiritual enlightenment. Yeah.
[49:37] It's not only just the great deep
[49:39] mysteries of of God and his great
[49:42] Godhead and healing and deliverance and
[49:44] all that, but there's so many just
[49:46] natural things of life that comes inside
[49:50] the contents of this message. people
[49:53] that are not even called to be bride
[49:55] that not even to really called to get
[49:57] into the depths of this message but they
[50:00] just hang around the fringes as we would
[50:02] say it would make them a better
[50:04] Christian just if they would take that
[50:08] and live those very simple things
[50:10] without getting into the great deeper
[50:12] things it would make them better people
[50:15] absolutely it would just like people of
[50:18] that same category read certain things
[50:21] about Paul's writing ings and they will
[50:23] take them very simple things and it
[50:26] makes them better church members yet
[50:28] they will miss many things that are
[50:31] given to the elect only where they will
[50:34] read from the exact same book of
[50:36] Ephesians and them type of category of
[50:39] Christians they'll take the very simple
[50:42] aspects of Ephesians and they'll totally
[50:45] miss what's hidden there for the bride
[50:48] same with Philippians Colossians
[50:50] Galatians Corinthians Thessalonians,
[50:52] Titus, Phyimon, Hebrews, all the rest of
[50:55] it that was written by this prophet of
[50:57] God. And yet in there, it's like God
[51:00] puts it forth in levels. So people can
[51:03] read the Bible and according to their
[51:05] capacity, according to the election and
[51:08] the predestination of God, some will get
[51:10] out of that forgiveness and the blood
[51:12] and mercy and the cross, and that's as
[51:15] far as they'll ever go. They'll never go
[51:17] into the great mystery of God of
[51:20] election and fornowledge and seed life
[51:22] and all the great things that God has in
[51:25] store. And they may memorize the book of
[51:27] Ephesians, but you can't memorize the
[51:30] mysterious part. Only God can make that
[51:32] known to you. Aren't you glad he has?
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to listen as we take a
[51:38] little journey into the realms or the
[51:42] spheres of the supernatural. Now
[51:45] remember that God created of course the
[51:48] dimensions way back you know who knows
[51:51] exactly when it was but we know that he
[51:54] created the angels before the foundation
[51:57] of the world. So no doubt the dimensions
[52:00] and the spheres were already created
[52:03] then as well because the angels actually
[52:06] made their choice to leave the kingdom
[52:09] of Michael before the foundation of the
[52:11] world was ever laid. So there were
[52:14] dimensions and realms and spheres of the
[52:18] supernatural
[52:20] in there the angelic beings which all at
[52:23] the at the beginning belong to God and
[52:26] they were under his domain. But he knew
[52:29] that some of them because they did not
[52:32] come from eternal essence of his being
[52:36] but rather as creatures that would be
[52:39] allocated a choice. Now remember they
[52:42] were placed in their dominion or their
[52:44] habitation as we just read on a very
[52:47] similar basis as Adam was in the Garden
[52:50] of Eden. So Adam was placed there on
[52:53] probation. So were the angels that God
[52:56] knew would fall. But remember the Bible
[52:59] also talks about elect angels which lets
[53:02] us know some were not elected. So the
[53:06] elect angels could not fall, would never
[53:09] fall. Impossible for them to fall. Now I
[53:12] want you to listen carefully now as we
[53:15] break into this of what God has given to
[53:18] us as his bride. Listen to this. In 1954
[53:22] as a prophet goes into it. Mortals are
[53:26] influenced from an outside world. I
[53:30] should understand by the grace of God. I
[53:33] deal with spirits and I should know what
[53:37] I'm speaking of. Well, for one person in
[53:40] this building tonight, I believe that he
[53:41] did.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; And I look along this dark mass of gaity
[53:49] and every once in a while you'll see
[53:52] little lights are burning. Now notice
[53:56] how that this realm had been opened
[53:59] somewhat in the Old Testament to the
[54:02] prophets and they would by the spirit of
[54:04] God be able to go into the realm. This
[54:07] is why the Old Testament would call a
[54:09] prophet a seer s.
[54:12] So he was able by the spirit of God by
[54:15] open vision. You remember the Bible
[54:17] tells us that that the word of the Lord
[54:19] came to soand so and there was no open
[54:22] vision in that day. So what that means
[54:25] is there was no man on the earth that
[54:28] had the reciprocating gift that he could
[54:30] open up his eyes like this and peer into
[54:33] the first, second, fourth, fifth, sixth,
[54:35] seventh dimension, whatever it was. So
[54:38] God would place them men on the earth at
[54:41] a certain time. So no doubt some of them
[54:44] broke into that realm and there would be
[54:46] periods of great silence of the
[54:49] supernatural and it would go for
[54:52] hundreds of years. There would be no
[54:54] word from God. There would be no open
[54:57] vision. They would just rehearse what
[55:00] they had heard in the past. And they
[55:02] would live and they how great it was
[55:05] when God delivered our forefathers from
[55:07] the land of Egypt. Oh, what a a great
[55:09] time. And then something else would come
[55:11] along. And then God would deliver
[55:13] somebody else and it would be a a new
[55:15] word that would be added to that. and
[55:18] then it might go another 150 years or
[55:20] 200 or 400 whatever it was and they
[55:23] would just go along in this slow type of
[55:26] cycle. Now the supernatural always was
[55:30] there but it was like there was no one
[55:33] that had the ability to break into that
[55:36] realm and pull out of there something
[55:40] for the season that the people lived.
[55:43] Again, why we needed a prophet. Now
[55:46] watch this. how that God allowed our
[55:49] prophet messenger to be able to deal in
[55:53] the realm of the supernatural in a
[55:55] different way than Elijah would have of
[55:59] the Old Testament or Isaiah, Ezekiel,
[56:02] Naam, you know, all the prophets of the
[56:04] Old Testament. They would have broke in,
[56:06] but theirs was more of a realm of
[56:09] prophetic word and also of the condition
[56:13] of the time, the sin of the people. God
[56:16] rebuking them by the prophets. But
[56:18] remember, God is now with the prophet of
[56:22] our day going to send this prophet at
[56:25] the beginning of the Pentecostal age. So
[56:29] the beginning of this age was going to
[56:32] come out and whatever it did. Now
[56:34] remember what the woman who was he
[56:38] identified her as an astronomer and she
[56:42] saw him on that bus that day and she
[56:45] started looking at him real funny and he
[56:48] started feeling he said a funny spirit
[56:51] and he said he always was sensitive to
[56:53] that and he said this woman spoke to him
[56:57] young man young man. So he turned around
[57:01] and said, "Yes, ma'am." And she said,
[57:04] "Do you know there's a light following
[57:06] you?" He said, "No, ma'am. I I don't
[57:09] want nothing to do with that." She said,
[57:11] "You mean no preachers have ever told
[57:14] you that there's a light following you?"
[57:16] He said, "I have nothing to do with
[57:18] preachers. I don't I don't go to church.
[57:20] I I don't know anything about all of
[57:21] that sort of thing." So she tries to
[57:24] talk to him, you will never be
[57:27] successful in the west, in the east.
[57:30] You'll have to go out west. I don't want
[57:32] anything to do with that. And he
[57:34] actually got a little bit rude with her.
[57:36] And she said, "Now, is that a way a
[57:38] gentleman should act that you would get
[57:41] rude and smart with me?" And he said,
[57:44] "Well, I'm not trying to get smart with
[57:46] you, but my mother always told me to
[57:48] stay away from that stuff." She said,
[57:51] "Would it help you if I told you when
[57:54] you were born?"
[57:56] He said, "No, because you can't do
[57:59] that."
[58:00] April the 6th, 1909,
[58:04] 5:00
[58:06] in the morning.
[58:08] And he said, "How did you know that?"
[58:12] And she said, "Did you ever hear of the
[58:15] magi in the Bible?" He said, "Well, I've
[58:17] heard something about it." Well, that
[58:20] was actually them three messengers and
[58:22] them three stars come together and it
[58:25] was the birth of Jesus. You've heard
[58:26] that? Yeah, I've heard that. Well, every
[58:29] now and then God will send a gift to the
[58:35] earth in commemoration
[58:38] of that great gift. Amen.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; And it just so happened that you were
[58:44] born in that alignment that God has
[58:48] given you a gift and sent it to the
[58:51] earth in commemoration
[58:54] of the great gift.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; You do know why that gift was sent,
[58:59] don't you? For you.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; For you. Oh, yeah. There's millions of
[59:03] people that benefited by the gift of
[59:06] healing and the signs and the prophecy
[59:08] and all kinds of different things like
[59:11] that. But many of them will never take
[59:13] the word and be changed by the word and
[59:16] actually become that word that he
[59:20] preached. Now they will become the
[59:23] healing word that he brought. Thus
[59:25] sayaith the Lord you're healed. And they
[59:28] would walk into that word. That would
[59:30] have been an awesome thing to have. But
[59:32] you can be healed and get sick again
[59:35] from the same thing and die from the
[59:37] same disease. But God had another
[59:41] Hallelujah. God had another word or more
[59:45] word that he was bringing to the elect
[59:49] of God. And it was not just for divine
[59:53] healing of the body, but he wanted to
[59:56] heal them of their mortality.
[59:59] In other words, burst them into eternal
[1:00:02] life by the breath of God. and he brings
[1:00:06] a prophet then on the earth and he will
[1:00:10] start out among the Pentecostals and and
[1:00:13] the Pentecostals will be blessed and he
[1:00:17] will as Elea went from the well back
[1:00:21] down to the house where uh where she was
[1:00:24] from and her brother benefited and her
[1:00:27] mother benefited and no doubt other
[1:00:29] people there benefited by this man but
[1:00:32] they was not the bride Rebecca.
[1:00:36] Now listen to this. Every once in a
[1:00:40] while you see little lights are burning.
[1:00:44] Lights. There you are. It's your table
[1:00:49] today. Lights are burning. That's
[1:00:52] Christians in the darkness giving light.
[1:00:57] You see what I mean? Now, what what are
[1:01:00] we what are we looking at from a man who
[1:01:04] lived so much of his life in the realm
[1:01:08] of the supernatural? Now, Isaiah never
[1:01:11] say anything like this. Of course, there
[1:01:13] were no Christians in the Old Testament,
[1:01:15] so there could be no pulsation of
[1:01:18] eternal light life from their souls. So,
[1:01:22] the prophets couldn't see it in reality.
[1:01:25] Even in the New Testament, Paul got a
[1:01:28] little glimpse, but Paul never said it
[1:01:31] quite like this before. But remember
[1:01:35] that God wanted our prophet to be able
[1:01:38] to walk in that realm so much because of
[1:01:42] all that was going to transpire in his
[1:01:45] ministry. Now, watch what he says that
[1:01:47] that's Christians in the darkness giving
[1:01:50] light. You see what I mean? Now look at
[1:01:52] this here. The sinner is influenced by a
[1:01:56] spirit because he is a spirit. The
[1:02:01] sinner is influenced by a spirit because
[1:02:05] he is a spirit. And the wrong gives
[1:02:09] influence and the right gives influence.
[1:02:14] Now remember, there's three realms up
[1:02:16] this way and three realms down this way.
[1:02:20] And you're in the middle.
[1:02:23] you're in the middle. Now, whenever the
[1:02:26] prophet would break into this realm, a
[1:02:29] vision, now this would have been
[1:02:30] somewhat different from the visions that
[1:02:33] he would have saw in 1933, and it would
[1:02:36] have involved the the car shaped like an
[1:02:39] egg and Mussolini and all of those
[1:02:42] things that would happen. But many of
[1:02:44] these other visions, it was the the
[1:02:47] realm of politics for sure. But God gave
[1:02:51] him a great insight into the realm of
[1:02:54] diseases and afflictions. Now that that
[1:02:58] realm had not been visited in this
[1:03:02] capacity since the very creation of man
[1:03:06] by a prophet. Now think of it. The Lord
[1:03:09] Jesus when he was here, he broke into
[1:03:12] that realm and he's the creator and the
[1:03:14] master of that realm. But he did not go
[1:03:17] into that realm and and bring out as
[1:03:20] much out of that realm as he allowed his
[1:03:24] messenger to in the last day. And after
[1:03:27] all, it wasn't the messenger anyway. It
[1:03:29] was the ministry of the Lord Jesus.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Now, watch. So, as he's in this realm,
[1:03:37] he's seeing things that will appear so
[1:03:40] different. So he would see angels, he
[1:03:43] would see demons, he would see light, he
[1:03:46] would see darkness, it would be in the
[1:03:49] form of streaks, it could be flickering
[1:03:53] lights, he would after casting out
[1:03:56] devils and go to a hotel at night, then
[1:03:59] those demons would come to haunt him and
[1:04:03] he would hear chains rattling all night
[1:04:07] long. Now you know what had happened
[1:04:09] there? that that devil had a place of
[1:04:12] rest in that human body and through the
[1:04:16] word of God that devil was made to leave
[1:04:20] and the devil hadn't found another
[1:04:22] resting place yet. So it come with its
[1:04:26] chains you know maybe the same ones that
[1:04:28] Jude writes about. It comes with its
[1:04:31] chains and it comes back to torment that
[1:04:35] man that made it leave. That's why you
[1:04:38] better know what you're doing before you
[1:04:39] go to casting out devils.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Now, they would be very angry and very
[1:04:45] upset then at the prophet and they would
[1:04:48] they would come back to his room and he
[1:04:51] would hear those chains rattling all
[1:04:53] through the night. And he said they
[1:04:55] would rub their flesh against him. I'm
[1:05:00] telling you one thing that ain't many of
[1:05:01] us called to deal with that.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Ain't you glad?
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; That'd scare the liver out of me. hair
[1:05:07] standing up on back of my neck right
[1:05:08] now. Oh my. But God sent one. Why?
[1:05:13] Apparently, we needed him. So in that
[1:05:17] realm, whenever he'd come out, there
[1:05:19] would be an impression that would still
[1:05:21] be left on him. And you can hear him as
[1:05:24] he preaches different things. And it's
[1:05:27] like he's bringing the insight from that
[1:05:29] world or worlds and plural and he will
[1:05:32] preach about it. Now, this is what he's
[1:05:34] doing here. and this and this uh uh
[1:05:37] service. Now we said those that are
[1:05:40] dominated from the blackness
[1:05:43] and separation. The wrong gives
[1:05:46] influence and the right gives influence
[1:05:50] and those who are dominated from with
[1:05:55] blackness and separation are dominated
[1:05:59] from the underworld
[1:06:02] of devils. So they are dominated. Now
[1:06:06] does that mean that a Christian cannot
[1:06:08] get under the influence of an evil
[1:06:10] spirit? Nope. Christians sure can.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Anybody honest enough to say that you're
[1:06:16] a Christian and you have before?
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Few of you. Well, thank God the rest of
[1:06:21] you need to get saved. I reckon I'll
[1:06:22] make an alter call and y'all get saved
[1:06:24] before we leave tonight.
[1:06:26] Now think of it. There's a difference
[1:06:28] between getting under the influence of a
[1:06:31] spirit and possessed by one.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now watch him as he goes on with
[1:06:38] this. Here's where mortals live. A whole
[1:06:43] conglomeration
[1:06:44] is blackness and darkness. And in there
[1:06:49] is little lights placed now and then. So
[1:06:54] in here where mortals are now because
[1:06:57] we're still immortal, we are found in
[1:07:00] this conglomeration
[1:07:02] of darkness, but something has happened
[1:07:04] to us by the grace of God. And then the
[1:07:07] way he's relating it was that in there
[1:07:09] is little lights placed now and then.
[1:07:14] That's Christians born again of light.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Christians that are
[1:07:23] born again of life. So then what does
[1:07:27] that make you? That makes you a son or
[1:07:30] daughter of light. So right here in this
[1:07:33] building tonight, everybody is pulsating
[1:07:36] something out from your soul because you
[1:07:39] are a little dynamo and you are creating
[1:07:43] by what you read, what you watch, what
[1:07:46] you listen to, what your spirit feeds
[1:07:49] on. All that all that culminates in an
[1:07:52] atmosphere that you create. All of us
[1:07:55] do. Every one of us killed kids and all.
[1:07:57] Now then the the there's a part of that
[1:08:00] that we have to do oursel and we cannot
[1:08:03] produce the light. Only the new birth
[1:08:06] can do that. Now once he said you are a
[1:08:08] light that is set on a hill, a candle
[1:08:11] that is set in the room and it gives
[1:08:13] light to all the room. So now get in
[1:08:15] your mind a candle that is set in a
[1:08:18] room. So it doesn't mean that every one
[1:08:21] of you are this gigantic massive massive
[1:08:25] massive light and you're going to
[1:08:28] totally put out all the darkness. No, he
[1:08:30] types us as a candle being set in a
[1:08:34] room. Now depending on the size of the
[1:08:36] room and how big the candle is, how much
[1:08:38] light you'll pull out and be able to
[1:08:40] emanate in the room. a candle that is
[1:08:43] set in a room that gives light to all
[1:08:45] the room. That's what a Christian is
[1:08:47] amongst darkness. You're supposed to
[1:08:50] shine where it's dark. Now notice the
[1:08:52] wicked or the unbeliever is influenced
[1:08:56] from beneath. From beneath. There is a
[1:09:01] trinity of hell like there is a trinity
[1:09:05] of heaven. They're influenced by evil
[1:09:08] powers. Notice the first thing when you
[1:09:11] start down. Now, let's go down in this
[1:09:14] realms. The first thing you find is a
[1:09:17] realm that's got the unsaved in it. The
[1:09:23] unsaved.
[1:09:24] That's right. That's where Jesus went
[1:09:27] and preached to the souls that were in
[1:09:30] prison that repented not in the
[1:09:32] longsuffering in the days of Noah. The
[1:09:35] next is demons. So now here you are, you
[1:09:39] and I together. We're in this mortal
[1:09:41] stream of time. The very first dimension
[1:09:44] or realm beneath us is the regions of
[1:09:48] the lost.
[1:09:50] The very next dimension down is demons.
[1:09:55] Oh my
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; demons. [snorts]
[1:09:59] Help us Jesus. The next is demons and
[1:10:03] the next is hell itself. The world is
[1:10:08] influenced by these demon powers through
[1:10:12] this trinity. So the trinity of the lost
[1:10:17] which are kept in prison until judgment.
[1:10:22] Then the second realm of that trinity is
[1:10:24] those demons which fell before the
[1:10:27] foundation of the world. They forfeited
[1:10:30] their habitation, their rights to be
[1:10:33] angels of God. They forfeited their
[1:10:36] rights to stand before his presence and
[1:10:39] worship and adore him day and night.
[1:10:44] So they have a habitation now that is
[1:10:48] the second part of Satan's trinity.
[1:10:52] Now notice as the prophet turns and he
[1:10:54] said the Christians are influenced by
[1:10:58] spirit too. The Holy Spirit. The first
[1:11:02] is the Holy Spirit above. Now we've
[1:11:06] turned from down here. Now we're going
[1:11:08] this way. The first is the Holy Spirit
[1:11:11] above for Christians. The next layer is
[1:11:17] angels. Praise God. And the next heavens
[1:11:22] is God. Now remember, heaven, it's not
[1:11:26] like it's 450,000 miles away from here.
[1:11:29] It's in another dimension that is moving
[1:11:33] faster than the one we're in right now.
[1:11:35] Remember when the prophet was carried
[1:11:37] beyond the curtain of time into the
[1:11:39] sixth dimension and when he got up there
[1:11:43] and he had crossed over into this river.
[1:11:44] Remember he had not entered into his own
[1:11:47] theophony yet because a theophony is a
[1:11:50] word formed body that you bypass to come
[1:11:52] here. In that word formed body you would
[1:11:55] know all things. His was a translation
[1:11:59] cuz watch when he got there he didn't
[1:12:02] know where he was and he sees all these
[1:12:05] people coming and he don't know who they
[1:12:07] are.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; They know him but he don't know them.
[1:12:12] You understand?
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Death in this body births us into the
[1:12:18] theophony. But he had not died. He'd
[1:12:21] simply been transferred or transported.
[1:12:24] So once he comes in there, he goes to
[1:12:27] asking these questions. Well, why'd you
[1:12:30] put me up here? Who who are all these?
[1:12:33] Well, you you've been gathered with your
[1:12:35] people. Are all these Brandoms? They're
[1:12:38] not all brandoms. these are your
[1:12:40] converts that you led to Christ. And
[1:12:43] then the brothers come and they picked
[1:12:44] him up real high and they said, "What'd
[1:12:46] you do that for?" One question after
[1:12:49] another after another. Now remember, it
[1:12:52] was a translation of sorts, he called it
[1:12:55] a couple of different things, but he
[1:12:57] said if what he was carried up into was
[1:13:01] the first heaven, then what Paul saw
[1:13:04] must have been the third heaven.
[1:13:08] Now remember it is layers and
[1:13:12] dimensions. So in the sixth dimension
[1:13:15] when he was there he never mentioned one
[1:13:18] thing about seeing Peter or Paul or
[1:13:21] Luther or Wesley or Calvin or none of
[1:13:25] their followers. He only saw his own. So
[1:13:30] in the sixth dimension it's like there
[1:13:32] are layers or spheres in that dimension.
[1:13:36] And each church age messenger is
[1:13:38] gathered with his own and at the
[1:13:42] resurrection is when we all get
[1:13:44] together.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Man, you talking about a family reunion.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Now notice, so when
[1:13:51] the Lord Jesus dies, he goes down and
[1:13:54] preaches to the souls that were in
[1:13:57] prison. And we know that the blood of an
[1:14:00] animal could not allow the souls to come
[1:14:03] back up in the Old Testament. So they
[1:14:05] were sent into a place called paradise.
[1:14:09] So paradise at that time laid down this
[1:14:13] way but not no more. It has been
[1:14:16] absolutely changed and done away with.
[1:14:20] No child of God goes this way. They go
[1:14:23] up this way.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Now saying that in that realm, watch
[1:14:28] what he said. The first is the Holy
[1:14:30] Spirit for Christians. The next layer is
[1:14:32] angels. And the next heavens,
[1:14:35] heavens
[1:14:36] is God. Holy Spirit, angels, God. The
[1:14:41] Holy Spirit come up past angels come
[1:14:45] down to redeem sinners. I don't want to
[1:14:48] go over the top of your head and just
[1:14:48] blow you away tonight, but actually the
[1:14:50] Holy Spirit is the dispensation of the
[1:14:53] son of God. The son of God is the Holy
[1:14:57] Ghost.
[1:15:00] We'll pick that up some other time. The
[1:15:03] next layer is angels and the next heaven
[1:15:05] is God. Holy Spirit, angels, God. The
[1:15:08] Holy Spirit come up pass. Angels come
[1:15:11] down to redeem sinners. Say here is a
[1:15:14] line like this. And in there's all
[1:15:17] mortals on this side or on that side.
[1:15:21] Men are influenced by one side. This
[1:15:23] side, notice now he's born up this way.
[1:15:26] This side comes from God. This side
[1:15:28] comes from the devil. Now, let's just
[1:15:30] take a great conglomeration of blackness
[1:15:33] and gaoty and muck and sin and
[1:15:36] divisiveness of this world. Every once
[1:15:39] in a while, you'll see a little white
[1:15:43] spot.
[1:15:45] That's a Christian.
[1:15:48] Now, I wonder how by vision that when
[1:15:51] people would walk up and the Lord would
[1:15:54] open their life to him. Now remember in
[1:15:56] the fourth dimension is the realm where
[1:15:59] a prophet sees his vision. Fourth
[1:16:01] dimension of course and other dimensions
[1:16:03] are light, matter, time, science. So the
[1:16:06] unbeliever goes, where the believer goes
[1:16:07] and where God is. So in the fourth
[1:16:09] dimension is the realm of science. So we
[1:16:12] have light, rays, cosmic light, all
[1:16:14] types of different things. But we also
[1:16:17] have dimensional travel. So in that
[1:16:20] dimensional world is how a prophet would
[1:16:23] be able to stand right here with his
[1:16:26] eyes wide open and he could journey back
[1:16:29] in time before the foundation of the
[1:16:31] world. And in two seconds of our human
[1:16:34] time, he could be brought up to 25 years
[1:16:37] like ago and then he would be able to be
[1:16:40] shot forth in time down through eternity
[1:16:43] and and he wasn't gone from the earth
[1:16:45] just five minutes sitting right there
[1:16:46] with his eyes wide open. Now, he's time
[1:16:49] traveling through the fourth dimension.
[1:16:52] Now, think of it, friends, that God, you
[1:16:55] say, "Brother Donnie, what's it got to
[1:16:57] do with me?" Well, I don't know exactly
[1:16:59] what it's got to do with you as an
[1:17:01] individual, but it must have something
[1:17:03] to do with you, or it wouldn't be in
[1:17:05] your message.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; If it didn't have nothing to do with
[1:17:08] you, I guess Luther would have preached
[1:17:10] them. We all wouldn't know nothing about
[1:17:12] it. But apparently, it's got something
[1:17:13] to do with us right here tonight. Amen.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Say, "Help me, Lord.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Help me, Jesus.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Open my understanding, Lord."
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Now, every once in a while, you see a
[1:17:24] little white spot. That's a Christian
[1:17:27] like a light. Now, those that are in
[1:17:30] darkness are influenced from beneath.
[1:17:33] Can't you understand, friends, why the
[1:17:35] people of the world without the spirit
[1:17:38] of God illuminating them, why they'll
[1:17:40] never see the great things of God? Uh
[1:17:43] Carol and I run into several of the
[1:17:45] saints today uh down at the viewing of
[1:17:48] brother Lyn and the funeral and we was
[1:17:50] talking to one of the sisters of our
[1:17:51] church and she was talking about and we
[1:17:54] was talking about the light and the
[1:17:55] darkness together and the light and of
[1:17:58] course she didn't know what I was going
[1:17:59] to preach tonight but whenever you think
[1:18:01] and I told her I said you know if you
[1:18:04] would have been born in total darkness
[1:18:06] and you never even saw any light at all
[1:18:10] whatsoever and you never knew there was
[1:18:13] such a thing as a light. So you take
[1:18:16] some of the underground animals as a
[1:18:18] mole or a shrew or some of those that's
[1:18:22] even worse than them and get down and
[1:18:24] they spend their whole life under
[1:18:26] darkness. There's fish that are blind.
[1:18:28] We've got some in the in the caves here
[1:18:30] in Tennessee. They have never seen
[1:18:34] light. Not one speck of light. But if
[1:18:37] you'd be able to pull that fish out of
[1:18:39] the water and talk to him and tell him,
[1:18:41] "Hey, little to fish you there. There's
[1:18:42] a light out here. You've got little
[1:18:44] brothers and sisters over here on Walta
[1:18:47] Lake and and there's a great big sun, a
[1:18:49] great big ball." Say, "Are you crazy?
[1:18:53] There ain't no ball. I I was born in
[1:18:55] this darkness. I've lived every day of
[1:18:57] my life in this darkness. I've never
[1:18:59] seen no light. I've never heard anybody
[1:19:01] even talking about it. You're crazy. Get
[1:19:03] out of here. I don't want nothing to do
[1:19:05] with you. You're messing up my dark
[1:19:07] world.
[1:19:09] That's why they don't like the light of
[1:19:11] the day because it messes up their dark
[1:19:15] world. Don't you understand when people
[1:19:17] backslide how they become so
[1:19:19] contankerous and so hateful? Why?
[1:19:22] Because the light in you is recognized
[1:19:25] by that evil spirit on them or sometimes
[1:19:29] in them. And that spirit hates that
[1:19:32] little bright light that it sees
[1:19:34] pulsating out of your soul. Sisters,
[1:19:36] it's not always necessary the the length
[1:19:38] of your hair nor the length of your
[1:19:39] dress. And we believe in all that. We
[1:19:41] believe our brothers ought to dress
[1:19:43] godly and act godly. But that's not so
[1:19:45] much what demons are looking at. But
[1:19:47] demons see that communication channel
[1:19:49] from our being. And they see from us
[1:19:52] either pulsates for them or against
[1:19:55] them. We can talk the message. We can
[1:19:57] quote quotes and quote scripture. That
[1:19:59] ain't what they go by. They go by what
[1:20:02] Paul states from our soul. It's either
[1:20:04] one of two things. It's either light or
[1:20:08] darkness.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Now notice those, he said, "Now those
[1:20:15] that are in darkness are influenced from
[1:20:17] beneath. Those that are lights are
[1:20:20] influenced from above. They are lights."
[1:20:23] Do you understand the world? They're not
[1:20:25] just in darkness. They are darkness.
[1:20:29] They are darkness. And that's why many
[1:20:31] of them, you know, as we talk about it
[1:20:33] all the time, and you've heard me say it
[1:20:34] many times, you probably get sick of
[1:20:35] hearing me say it, but I've said it all
[1:20:37] the time. I don't understand how people
[1:20:38] live without the Lord. I don't I I
[1:20:41] wouldn't want to live one one moment
[1:20:43] without him in my life. I mean, knows
[1:20:44] what I'm talking about. But yet, there
[1:20:46] are people that live what they think a
[1:20:49] normal everyday life without God. They
[1:20:52] will live on the earth 60, 70, 80, 90
[1:20:54] years, 100 years, whatever it is. and
[1:20:56] they will die and they will be lost and
[1:20:59] then they will realize one day what they
[1:21:02] miss and they live what they thought was
[1:21:04] a perfectly normal human life. Well, how
[1:21:06] come you can't do that? How come you
[1:21:08] have to go to church? Why does brother
[1:21:10] Harvey do you need to real still read
[1:21:12] your Bible? Why is it that you've been
[1:21:14] listening to this prophet all these
[1:21:16] years and you still like to turn on one
[1:21:18] of them tapes and listen to it? Why is
[1:21:20] it that you need to pray? Why is it that
[1:21:22] you need to pick up your Bible? because
[1:21:25] you were darkness, but you're not
[1:21:26] darkness anymore. So, what does it make
[1:21:29] you do? It makes you fall in love with
[1:21:32] the light which illuminated your soul.
[1:21:35] And you become wed to that light and
[1:21:38] it's a part of who you are. So, it's
[1:21:41] part of the way you live, the way you
[1:21:43] talk. It's the way we live our lives. We
[1:21:45] rule our lives by it. We judge our lives
[1:21:47] by it. Now, watch. Then, those that are
[1:21:50] in that darkness, they do exactly the
[1:21:52] same way. They talk darkness talk. They
[1:21:55] think darkness thoughts. They watch
[1:21:57] darkness programs on television and read
[1:22:00] darkness books and on the internet.
[1:22:02] Everything about it. It's darkness. It's
[1:22:04] conglomeration of gaity and mock and
[1:22:07] filth. But every now and then you'll see
[1:22:08] a little light flashing over here and
[1:22:11] over there. Now there's not that many of
[1:22:12] them in comparison to all the world. Now
[1:22:15] watch. He said, "Now, when you leave
[1:22:18] either one of these channels and you go
[1:22:20] into the realm of spirit, this is the
[1:22:23] mortal realm, the dimensions that we
[1:22:25] live in." Now, if you go this way,
[1:22:27] listen close. If you go this way, the
[1:22:30] first dimension is the spirits of the
[1:22:32] dead. Peter spoke of it in prison that
[1:22:36] repented not by the longsuffering of the
[1:22:38] days of Noah. The wicked unregenerated
[1:22:41] man when he dies his spirit goes into
[1:22:45] that realm. The next realm below is
[1:22:47] demons. The next realm below that is
[1:22:50] hell.
[1:22:53] Now what happens then to those that
[1:22:55] truly become born again?
[1:22:59] Are they delivered from every speck of
[1:23:04] darkness?
[1:23:09] I'm going to answer that for you. I'll
[1:23:12] let your gift answer it.
[1:23:14] Paul a prisoner. It's just like our
[1:23:17] lives.
[1:23:19] We are
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; shadows.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Shadows.
[1:23:25] Now, if we're a light where if our lives
[1:23:29] cope with the light of the day, now
[1:23:32] notice what he says. You are. If we're a
[1:23:35] light where if our lives cope with the
[1:23:38] light of the day, can't you see why
[1:23:41] Satan wants to pull you out of the light
[1:23:42] of the day? He don't mind if you walk in
[1:23:45] the light of Pentecost. He don't mind if
[1:23:47] you walk in the light of Lucern or the
[1:23:50] light of, you know, a Baptist or
[1:23:52] whatever more. He hates it when you walk
[1:23:55] in the light of your day. That's what
[1:23:57] gives you power to overcome him. We
[1:24:00] cannot overcome the demons in this hour
[1:24:03] with the message of Pentecost.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. We cannot overcome
[1:24:09] the darkness in this age with the
[1:24:12] message of John Smith, the founder of
[1:24:15] the Baptist church. It was a great move
[1:24:17] of God all those years ago. But even
[1:24:20] those who are professed Baptist, walking
[1:24:22] in that light, can't overcome the evil
[1:24:25] of this age. So what do they do? turn
[1:24:28] the grace of God into lasciviousness and
[1:24:32] say, "It don't matter no more. It don't
[1:24:34] matter. Hair, clothes, paint, all that,
[1:24:36] you know, mascara, all that. That that
[1:24:38] that don't matter at all. That don't
[1:24:40] matter no more." Why? They're living in
[1:24:42] a past light. And that light does not
[1:24:46] produce a victory in the age we're
[1:24:48] living.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Now notice if we're a
[1:24:53] light where if our lives cope with the
[1:24:56] light of the day, we're walking in
[1:24:59] light. It's just like you look out and
[1:25:01] say, "I see the sun in the daytime. You
[1:25:04] see the shadow of the sun. It's a
[1:25:07] reflection of the sun. It isn't the sun
[1:25:10] itself." Now remember, it averages
[1:25:12] around 93 million miles uh from the from
[1:25:14] the earth at any given time. It isn't
[1:25:17] the sun itself, but it proves that there
[1:25:19] is a sun for us to get close enough to
[1:25:21] able to even look at with our eyes, we'd
[1:25:23] be totally burned up. We'd totally be
[1:25:25] burned up. Our eyes would have melt, you
[1:25:27] know, even spacecraft be able to get
[1:25:29] close enough to it. They can't even do
[1:25:30] it because it's so hot. Now, watch this
[1:25:32] thought. It's very important that you
[1:25:34] catch that. So, he said, "But it proves
[1:25:36] that there is a sun." It proves again it
[1:25:40] says there is a sun. And now when I see
[1:25:43] like you
[1:25:45] now watch the analogy of the sun when I
[1:25:49] see like you sitting out there using
[1:25:53] fans. I just seen sister Marca an using
[1:25:56] hers. Some of the rest of you using
[1:25:59] theirs. I'd use one if I had it cuz it's
[1:26:01] hot on a firecrack here in here tonight.
[1:26:04] So now watch the analogy. So I'm I'm
[1:26:07] looking and I'm seeing you. But he said
[1:26:10] it means that you're living, but it's
[1:26:14] only a shadow of life.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Now remember, for a man who spent
[1:26:22] decades of his life in the realm of the
[1:26:25] supernatural, and he would see light and
[1:26:28] darkness and shadows and flickers and
[1:26:32] all kinds of things like that. Keep this
[1:26:34] in mind. Now, we're not talking about a
[1:26:36] theologian from Bible school, but we're
[1:26:39] talking about a man that dealt with
[1:26:41] angels and demons and sickness. Now
[1:26:44] remember, he would be able to see them
[1:26:47] things and see some of them with hair
[1:26:51] coming down and see the cancers, some of
[1:26:54] the cancers that would look like a crab,
[1:26:57] some of them that would be red, some of
[1:27:00] them that would be black, and see them
[1:27:02] demons as they was looking at him with a
[1:27:06] human appearance with their teeth.
[1:27:08] Goodness gracious. I don't want to cause
[1:27:11] anybody to have nightmares tonight, but
[1:27:13] notice it was not just so much the
[1:27:16] length of their hair or the their teeth,
[1:27:19] but it was how that he related to them
[1:27:23] in light and darkness. Now, he said
[1:27:25] because it's only a shadow of light
[1:27:27] because anything has to have darkness in
[1:27:30] it
[1:27:33] to make a shadow.
[1:27:37] Wow.
[1:27:39] We have any perfect Christians here
[1:27:41] tonight?
[1:27:45] Oh, dear Lord. No perfect Christians.
[1:27:49] Did you notice my hands were down, too?
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; I didn't see a preacher raise their
[1:27:54] hand. Do we have any Christians that are
[1:27:58] looking to the perfection of the Lord
[1:28:00] Jesus?
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. You're talking my talk.
[1:28:07] But are we perfect?
[1:28:10] Are we sinless?
[1:28:13] Is our flesh filled with the Holy Ghost?
[1:28:17] Oh my. Now notice this is what he says
[1:28:20] you are. Because a shadow has to possess
[1:28:25] so much darkness and so much light to
[1:28:28] make a shadow. The light is your new
[1:28:32] birth by the soul. The darkness is your
[1:28:36] body that your mom and daddy gave you.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; And it's going to aggravate you and
[1:28:41] haunt you every day you live on the
[1:28:43] earth.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; And the Lord Jesus knew he would do it.
[1:28:46] And he left you in it anyway because he
[1:28:49] wanted the soul to conquer the flesh. He
[1:28:52] wanted the soul to bring this body
[1:28:54] subject. Don't conquer it one time and
[1:28:56] that's it at the new birth. No. But
[1:28:58] leave it mortal. Leave it in the mortal
[1:29:01] realm. Let it be that. Now, you can't
[1:29:04] see it, but I can. I've got my hand here
[1:29:07] tonight between these lights and this
[1:29:09] desk. I can see my fingers moving. Of
[1:29:12] course, in the flesh, you can. But I can
[1:29:14] see the shadow. I can see the shadow. My
[1:29:18] thumb is moving. My first finger, my
[1:29:19] little finger. I can see the shadow
[1:29:21] moving. None of you can't see the shadow
[1:29:23] because you're at the wrong angle. But
[1:29:26] you see, when we look at it under the
[1:29:28] illumination of the light of the hour,
[1:29:31] it helps us not only to see that we are
[1:29:34] eternal with God and that we have a new
[1:29:36] birth, but if you're at the right angle
[1:29:38] with the light, it helps you to see
[1:29:41] you've still got this element right here
[1:29:42] that you can't trust it. And you've got
[1:29:45] to bring it subject to the word. Not
[1:29:47] only bring it subject, but keep it
[1:29:49] subject to the word. Other people look
[1:29:52] at said, "Oh, you don't have to worry
[1:29:53] about the flesh.
[1:29:56] Jesus knew we couldn't live right. Don't
[1:29:58] even worry about it. Turning the grace
[1:30:00] of God into lasciviousness.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; It don't matter if you drink a little
[1:30:06] bit. It don't matter if you tell little
[1:30:08] white lies.
[1:30:10] Is there such a thing?
[1:30:13] Where in the world we come up with that
[1:30:15] at? A little white lie.
[1:30:19] A little white lie. The Bible tells us
[1:30:21] the biggest lie that was ever told had
[1:30:22] 90ome% truth. And so that little guy
[1:30:24] you're calling a little white lie, it's
[1:30:26] the biggest lie there is.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Notice now. So it can't be allto
[1:30:32] together dark and it can't be allto
[1:30:36] together light. So when these people go
[1:30:40] into the sixth dimension, you see what
[1:30:42] they drop? They drop the shadow.
[1:30:48] They drop the shadow and they move into
[1:30:52] that perfect light. Several years ago,
[1:30:55] before Carol's sister Sharon passed,
[1:30:59] they'd give her a mega dose. A doctor
[1:31:01] down in Kentucky almost killed her with
[1:31:04] chemo.
[1:31:06] And they called us and wanted us to come
[1:31:08] down there. She didn't think she's going
[1:31:10] to live. She had a couple different
[1:31:11] bouts. But she told her husband Arley to
[1:31:15] tell Carol how much she loved her. You
[1:31:17] know, it was always a terrible, terrible
[1:31:18] time, but she actually felt herself
[1:31:22] leave her body.
[1:31:24] And one of these episodes that she had
[1:31:27] and she saw this great light and she saw
[1:31:31] the beautiful blue of the skies like a
[1:31:34] blue she had never seen before. And she
[1:31:37] never really cared for yellow flowers or
[1:31:39] orange on the earth. But when she got
[1:31:42] there, she saw some that was absolutely
[1:31:45] breathtaking.
[1:31:47] And here was the flowers and the fields
[1:31:49] that were blowing and the grass. Oh,
[1:31:52] hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Why? The
[1:31:56] darkness had faded away.
[1:31:59] And when brother Brandham went beyond
[1:32:02] that curtain of time and he was still
[1:32:04] there, the shadow, brother Dave, was
[1:32:06] still laying on the bed. Now remember
[1:32:09] whenever he was up there and looking
[1:32:12] back at himself and his body he was
[1:32:15] laying there like this with his hands
[1:32:17] behind his head
[1:32:20] and he was singing that song humming
[1:32:22] that song beyond the curtain of time and
[1:32:25] he looked back down there and he said he
[1:32:27] wasn't 20 feet from his body.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; 20 feet.
[1:32:34] Can you imagine tonight
[1:32:37] 20 ft from where any of you are sitting
[1:32:41] is the sixth dimension.
[1:32:45] So it's not like a rocket ship that
[1:32:48] we'll need to take,
[1:32:52] but it'll be like a movie I saw when I
[1:32:55] was a little bitty boy
[1:32:58] called The Twilight Zone.
[1:33:02] Some of y'all still living with them
[1:33:04] fears too. I see.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; I'll never forget that particular one
[1:33:08] that I saw and it was in a bedroom in a
[1:33:11] house. Anybody ever see that episode?
[1:33:14] And the mama or somebody went in there
[1:33:17] and they fell and threw the wall of the
[1:33:19] bedroom. And when they did, they was in
[1:33:22] another dimension.
[1:33:26] and they couldn't make anybody
[1:33:28] understand where they were and what
[1:33:29] happened to them. And you're going to
[1:33:32] think I'm crazy, but I'll tell you what,
[1:33:34] some of this stuff that Hollywood and
[1:33:36] science has broke into, if you'll look
[1:33:38] at it, some of it ain't that far off
[1:33:41] from the truth.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you why. Cuz a lot of their
[1:33:45] influence is demonic.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; And them demons have been there. Oh my.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Let me shake you to your boots.
[1:33:57] Do you understand there are some fortune
[1:33:59] tellers and mediums and soothsayers
[1:34:05] that are genuine?
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Genuine.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Ain't somebody you should see,
[1:34:14] but they are real.
[1:34:17] You know what gives them that reality? A
[1:34:20] demon
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; has possessed them
[1:34:25] and opens beyond their human
[1:34:27] understanding. And they'll be able to
[1:34:29] tell you certain things. That's exactly
[1:34:31] right. Don't you understand what they
[1:34:33] are? It's blasphemy.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; They're impersonating a prophet of God.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Well, that's what Brother Bram said
[1:34:40] anyway.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Now, watch this. If you are a Christian,
[1:34:44] this being a shadow, it only proves that
[1:34:46] there's a life where you can't die.
[1:34:50] Because this life has death in it, do
[1:34:53] we?
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; How many y'all's getting older, fatter,
[1:34:56] uglier?
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Well, some of y'all really think you're
[1:34:59] something, don't you? Boy, you think
[1:35:01] you're pretty?
[1:35:03] Oh my. So, this life has got death in
[1:35:06] it. So, I'm still a shadow, but glory to
[1:35:10] God, I'm pressing toward the light.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; But it's a shadow because you're living,
[1:35:17] moving creature with abilities to see,
[1:35:21] think, move, and talk. And the five
[1:35:24] senses of the body, they let you know
[1:35:27] they're dying.
[1:35:29] And there's so much trouble. We all
[1:35:31] should be able to say amen to that. And
[1:35:34] it can only be it's a reflection, but
[1:35:38] it's not that which is perfect yet. Oh
[1:35:41] Lord, there's a life and death mixed
[1:35:45] together. Right in every one of us
[1:35:46] tonight that have the Holy Ghost is
[1:35:49] eternal life
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; and mortality both in the same body.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Death is working in our bodies. and
[1:35:59] eternal life which cannot die has called
[1:36:01] this body as his tabernacle.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. This is why you ain't
[1:36:07] getting the evening light away from me.
[1:36:09] This is the only thing that's going to
[1:36:12] break the shadow off of my life.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; I don't need more darkness. I need more
[1:36:19] light.
[1:36:20] Don't you see? This is why we need
[1:36:23] light. The light [screaming] of the word
[1:36:25] of God. I don't need less light. I need
[1:36:28] more light. No wonder the prophet said
[1:36:31] when the bride sees who she is, the
[1:36:33] rapture will go. What will it be? It'll
[1:36:35] be such an ushering forth of the light
[1:36:38] that your body can't take it no more and
[1:36:41] the shadow breaks and it turns into
[1:36:44] total light sphere.
[1:36:48] Praise the Lord. And though you won't
[1:36:50] have no electric bills there, praise be
[1:36:53] to God. You'll be your own dynamo of
[1:36:56] light. Amen. In that city they had no
[1:36:59] need of the light. For the Lord God and
[1:37:01] the lamb are the light thereof.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Notice he goes on to say the
[1:37:09] physical has to die.
[1:37:11] But if you are reflecting
[1:37:15] by your mortal life
[1:37:19] the light
[1:37:21] of heaven.
[1:37:24] Then you're reflecting the eternal life
[1:37:29] God.
[1:37:31] Then when you die,
[1:37:36] you can do no more but to go to that
[1:37:40] light
[1:37:42] because that's what you've reflected.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; You can go nowhere else. I ain't scared
[1:37:48] of hell.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There shouldn't be a
[1:37:52] Christian in your tonight scared of
[1:37:53] hell. There shouldn't be a member of the
[1:37:55] bride of Christ in your scared of the
[1:37:57] tribulation period. You ain't going
[1:37:59] through no tribulation period. You ain't
[1:38:01] going to hell. He went to hell for me so
[1:38:04] I wouldn't have to.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:38:10] Then when you die, you can do no more
[1:38:12] than go to that life. Don't you see
[1:38:15] what's happens to our saints, our loved
[1:38:19] ones, our husbands, our wives, our
[1:38:22] daughters, our our children, whatever
[1:38:24] more. Can't you see what happens to
[1:38:25] them? The light is pulling them out of
[1:38:30] this shadow
[1:38:32] and they walk right out of the shadow
[1:38:35] into another dimension.
[1:38:42] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:38:45] If you are of the dark world,
[1:38:50] you reflect that
[1:38:53] and you can do you can go no other way
[1:38:57] but to darkness.
[1:39:02] So where then will people go who are
[1:39:04] trying to put out the light of the hour?
[1:39:11] See, we are in a [clears throat]
[1:39:12] reflection.
[1:39:14] So, we see that. And sure as the Holy
[1:39:17] Spirit reflects light and life, so does
[1:39:21] death reflect darkness. Paul says it
[1:39:24] this one. Ephesians 5:8, "For ye were
[1:39:27] sometimes darkness,
[1:39:29] but now are ye light in the Lord.
[1:39:34] Walk as children [clears throat] of
[1:39:38] light.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; You were darkness,
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; but you're not anymore. That darkness
[1:39:45] broke around your soul and your soul can
[1:39:49] never turn back into darkness again.
[1:39:53] Now remember Paul, Peter rather said
[1:39:55] there in Jude 1:4 that certain men had
[1:39:59] crept in.
[1:40:01] They were of the netherworld,
[1:40:04] the abyss,
[1:40:07] the darkness. Oh my. Verse 5 again, he
[1:40:11] tells us having saved them, people later
[1:40:15] destroyed them. And then he tells us of
[1:40:17] the angels. But let's go to Matthew
[1:40:19] 12:43.
[1:40:22] Now watch this this realm of demonology.
[1:40:26] When an unclean spirit is gone out of a
[1:40:28] man, he walketh through dry places,
[1:40:33] seeketh rest,
[1:40:35] and findeth none. The word rest is
[1:40:38] intermission, ceation of any motion,
[1:40:42] business or labor. Recreation.
[1:40:46] So demons look for recreation
[1:40:50] when they go out of their human house.
[1:40:54] And I want you to listen how these
[1:40:56] things are.
[1:40:58] The word denotes a temporary rest, a
[1:41:01] respite
[1:41:02] of soldiers. So Satan is a restless
[1:41:07] being
[1:41:08] since falling from the presence of God.
[1:41:11] How many ever millennia ago it was or
[1:41:14] billions of years ago
[1:41:16] because he lost his place of rest.
[1:41:20] He is a restless being. So those angels
[1:41:25] when they fell from God, what did they
[1:41:27] lose? Not only their habitation, their
[1:41:30] power to do this, that and the other,
[1:41:31] but they lost rest. Can't you see why
[1:41:35] they are restless? Can't you see why the
[1:41:38] people of this age are so restless?
[1:41:43] Can't you see, friend, in our own
[1:41:44] nation, look at all the things that's
[1:41:47] going on in America. Can't you see
[1:41:49] what's the matter with all these people?
[1:41:50] They're going nuts.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; They're going out of their minds.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Look what's happening in our own nation.
[1:41:58] All these things that are going on and
[1:42:00] watch the little bit of it on YouTube if
[1:42:03] you're prone to do such and you'll see
[1:42:05] them. It's like they're going crazy.
[1:42:07] They're screaming. They're hollering.
[1:42:09] And the look that comes on their face.
[1:42:11] Don't you see what it is? It's the
[1:42:13] demons of darkness that's taking over
[1:42:16] their bodies. Amen.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord.
[1:42:22] So he's restless
[1:42:24] and his demons are restless. So his his
[1:42:29] view of walking and living in a human
[1:42:33] body is the only appeasement
[1:42:37] or rest as we would say that he gets.
[1:42:40] Now read with me in Job 1:6. Now there
[1:42:43] was a day when the sons of God came to
[1:42:46] present themselves
[1:42:48] before the Lord and Satan came also
[1:42:52] among them.
[1:42:55] Huh?
[1:42:57] You talking about brazen and bold walk
[1:43:00] right up to the throne of God when the
[1:43:04] sons of God
[1:43:07] Hallelujah.
[1:43:09] And Satan comes right up among them. And
[1:43:11] the Lord said unto Satan, "Whence comest
[1:43:13] thou?" Then Satan answered and said,
[1:43:16] "From going to and fro
[1:43:21] in the earth, from walking up and down
[1:43:26] in it."
[1:43:30] Look at his subjects.
[1:43:32] What do they do? To and fro. To and fro.
[1:43:35] Walking up and down looking for what?
[1:43:37] [screaming]
[1:43:38] Something to satisfy.
[1:43:41] for a new spot to vacation, a new drug,
[1:43:44] a new drink, a new this, and then
[1:43:46] they'll take that, and that don't do it,
[1:43:47] and then what they do? They go somewhere
[1:43:49] else, and then that don't do, and then
[1:43:50] they go somewhere else. What they're
[1:43:51] doing, they're walking up and down,
[1:43:53] going to and fro. They're looking for
[1:43:55] something. They're looking for rest.
[1:43:57] They're mimicking their master.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Lord, children, how grateful you ought
[1:44:02] to be tonight to have rest in your soul.
[1:44:04] How grateful you ought to be to have
[1:44:06] peace in the time of trouble that we
[1:44:09] don't have to go to this church and that
[1:44:10] church and this denomination, that
[1:44:12] denomination. Aren't you glad you have
[1:44:14] arrived?
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; You've got peace that passes
[1:44:18] understanding. You've got something
[1:44:20] tonight that every demon out of hell
[1:44:22] does not have.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; And the Lord answered, "Satan, thou
[1:44:28] considering my servant Job, that there's
[1:44:30] none like him in the earth, a perfect
[1:44:32] and an upright man, one that fears God
[1:44:33] and escestth evil." Now watch again in
[1:44:36] chapter 2, verse one. And again, there
[1:44:39] was a day when the sons of God came to
[1:44:42] present themselves before the Lord.
[1:44:45] Satan also came among them to present
[1:44:48] himself. Did you notice how different
[1:44:50] his attitude had changed from chapter
[1:44:52] one? Notice chapter 1. Now there was a
[1:44:55] day when the sons of God came to present
[1:44:57] themselves before the Lord and Satan
[1:45:00] came also among them. Now in chapter
[1:45:03] two, and again there was a day when the
[1:45:05] sons of God came to present themsel
[1:45:06] before the Lord and Satan came also
[1:45:08] among them to present himself.
[1:45:13] So he said, "That's what they're doing,
[1:45:14] huh? Okay, if they can do it, I can." So
[1:45:18] here I am, God.
[1:45:21] and watch God expose him.
[1:45:25] And the Lord said unto Satan, "From
[1:45:27] whence comest thou?" And Satan answered
[1:45:30] the Lord and said, "From going to and
[1:45:31] fro, his approach might have changed,
[1:45:34] but his destiny ain't."
[1:45:38] Same old devil, still looking, still
[1:45:41] searching up and down to fro here and
[1:45:44] there. Oh my. Oh, thank God. We have
[1:45:48] entered into his rest from going to and
[1:45:51] fro in the earth and from walking up and
[1:45:54] down in it. Now watch then back to
[1:45:57] Matthew 12:44. the spirit once he goes
[1:46:00] out. Now, I hope I don't lose you here,
[1:46:04] but these demons have seen people get
[1:46:06] under conviction enough to know when God
[1:46:11] is dealing with a human heart.
[1:46:15] And they know if they will walk out of
[1:46:18] that house on their own
[1:46:23] and let that man, woman, boy, or girl go
[1:46:25] ahead and go to church, get saved, as we
[1:46:29] say, put their name on a book, get
[1:46:31] religious, whatever.
[1:46:33] If they walk out on their own,
[1:46:37] they know 6 months later, a year, two or
[1:46:40] three, they still have a right to go
[1:46:44] back into their house.
[1:46:48] Lord have mercy, children. Don't you
[1:46:49] understand that's what's happened since
[1:46:51] the cross?
[1:46:56] Can you under imagine in your mind how a
[1:46:59] person would feel so much better when
[1:47:02] that demon which has controlled their
[1:47:04] life simply leaves their temper may come
[1:47:08] their lust you know whatever it is that
[1:47:11] they were doing they feel so different I
[1:47:14] can't believe it I went to that Baptist
[1:47:16] church I went to word of life church I I
[1:47:18] went to wherever boy now I I can't
[1:47:20] believe how much greater I feel I'm
[1:47:23] feeling so much better
[1:47:26] and they think they have the new person
[1:47:29] when all that happened was that demon
[1:47:31] started watching conviction and they
[1:47:34] said, "Uhoh,
[1:47:36] God's drawing this old boy.
[1:47:40] I better get out right now while the
[1:47:42] getting's good.
[1:47:44] Cuz if I leave on my own, I can come
[1:47:48] back at any time I want to.
[1:47:52] and I'll bring seven of my buddies with
[1:47:55] me.
[1:48:01] And notice what this spirit says in
[1:48:03] verse 44. Then he saith,
[1:48:07] I will return into
[1:48:14] Now you know God and the devil ain't
[1:48:16] going to share the same soul.
[1:48:21] from whence I came out. And when he has
[1:48:23] come, he findeth it empty,
[1:48:28] swept,
[1:48:29] and garnished.
[1:48:31] Empty,
[1:48:33] swept, and garnished. Look at what's
[1:48:35] happened to this house. Somebody's been
[1:48:38] in there sweeping a lot of stuff out.
[1:48:39] Man, that went to beer bottles, and I
[1:48:41] went to marijuana, and I went
[1:48:42] cigarettes, and that went x-rated
[1:48:44] movies, and all kinds of filth, and all
[1:48:46] that. Boy, I'm Look at that. Wow. Look
[1:48:49] how clean this house is.
[1:48:52] So it's not only swept, but it's
[1:48:55] garnished. Look at the meaning of this
[1:48:56] word. Adorn, to put in order, arrange,
[1:49:02] make ready, prepare, to ornament,
[1:49:06] adore, metaphorically,
[1:49:08] to embellish with honor.
[1:49:15] So the demon goes out, the person gets
[1:49:17] saved. Man, they must have got
[1:49:19] sanctified, too, because he had things
[1:49:22] put in order.
[1:49:25] The devil comes back and said, "I'm
[1:49:27] tired out here.
[1:49:30] I ain't had no place to rest. I need
[1:49:32] some recreation.
[1:49:33] I need to go on a vacation." Lord have
[1:49:36] mercy, children.
[1:49:39] Don't be the devil's beach house.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Don't be the devil's cabin.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Don't be the devil's getaway.
[1:49:52] So he finds it empty, swept and
[1:49:56] garnished.
[1:49:58] So when this demon left, this person's
[1:50:00] life was so drastically changed, which
[1:50:03] is exactly what this demon knew would
[1:50:06] happen.
[1:50:08] So he will deceive this person into
[1:50:11] thinking they've got the new birth.
[1:50:15] Because after all, the church they went
[1:50:16] to, they tell them all you have to do.
[1:50:17] You know, it's just accept Christ as
[1:50:19] your savior and you got eternal life and
[1:50:20] you're born again and you've got grace
[1:50:22] and you'll never fall from it again.
[1:50:24] You're once saved, you're always saved.
[1:50:27] And they're said, "I don't care about I
[1:50:28] don't want the world. Oh, I don't want
[1:50:30] to." And why? Because that force that
[1:50:32] was in there, that great power, he just
[1:50:35] simply left on his own accord.
[1:50:38] And that man says, "I ain't never had so
[1:50:40] much peace in my life.
[1:50:43] Oh, it's such joy. I don't want to run
[1:50:45] around my wife no more. I don't want to
[1:50:47] do this, that, and the other. That demon
[1:50:50] sent exactly what I wanted.
[1:50:58] Lord Jesus,
[1:51:00] just so you know, I'm not making this
[1:51:01] up. And we'll close. Investments. The
[1:51:04] prophet said, "Jesus said, when an
[1:51:05] unclean spirit is gone out of a man,"
[1:51:08] did you notice he never said when he's
[1:51:10] cast out of a man,
[1:51:14] but when he goes out by his own will.
[1:51:19] So that demon by his own will goes out.
[1:51:25] And you figure when he goes out, he's
[1:51:27] going out for a reason. What greater
[1:51:29] deception could a person have than to be
[1:51:33] religiously deceived?
[1:51:36] A religious demon is seven times worse
[1:51:39] than any of the rest of them.
[1:51:44] When he goes out by his own will, when
[1:51:46] the unclean spirit goes out of a man, he
[1:51:48] returns back to this man and finds a
[1:51:50] house that he lived in has been swept
[1:51:52] and garnished. Then he goes and gets
[1:51:55] seven other devils,
[1:51:57] demons, unclean spirits, and enters into
[1:52:01] this man. And the last estate of this
[1:52:03] man is seven times worse than it was at
[1:52:06] the first. Did you notice the devil went
[1:52:08] out by his own will?
[1:52:12] And he returned
[1:52:14] by his own will.
[1:52:16] Now, if this house had already been
[1:52:19] occupied when he returned, he would not
[1:52:23] have been able to get in. And I say,
[1:52:27] glory to God to that.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Don't you understand? Every one of you
[1:52:30] that's got the Holy Ghost tonight, don't
[1:52:32] sit there and shake in your boots and
[1:52:34] you think, "Lord God, I hope it don't
[1:52:35] happen to me." It can't happen to you if
[1:52:37] your soul is sealed with the baptism of
[1:52:39] the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:52:42] Why? Because that devil, there's one
[1:52:44] thing when he comes back and he looks
[1:52:46] and sees it is swept and empty and
[1:52:49] garnished. But when he comes back to a
[1:52:52] soul that's been baptized with the Holy
[1:52:54] Ghost, not into the spirit realm, but
[1:52:57] into their soul and the token is on
[1:52:59] display and he goes to even getting
[1:53:01] close to that soul. He goes that sees
[1:53:03] that beam of light coming out of that
[1:53:05] being and said, "Lord have mercy. What
[1:53:07] nowhere else happened to this old boy? I
[1:53:09] mean, that man was all he was this and
[1:53:11] that and the other. I can't get back in.
[1:53:13] Let me try the door. The door is barred.
[1:53:15] Let me try the windows. I can't get in
[1:53:17] the windows. Let me try the attic. I
[1:53:19] can't get in the attic. Let me go down
[1:53:21] through the basement. He said, "Well,
[1:53:22] I'll tell you one thing. God must have
[1:53:24] beat me back." Yeah. Sort of like Romeo
[1:53:26] and Juliet. He come back by the baptism
[1:53:29] of the Holy Ghost and he knocked on your
[1:53:31] window and said, "Honey, let me in. Let
[1:53:34] me in." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And the
[1:53:37] Lord Jesus is sealing his people all
[1:53:40] over this world tonight. I don't care
[1:53:43] what the devil does. He will never pull
[1:53:45] the elect of God out of the divine
[1:53:48] promise of God because we are not empty.
[1:53:52] We are full of goodness. We are full of
[1:53:54] love. We are full of mercy. We are full
[1:53:57] of him. [applause]
[1:54:04] [sighs and gasps]
[1:54:05] [panting]
[1:54:08] Let me close
[1:54:10] with paragraph 60 from this same sermon.
[1:54:14] It's a very beautiful picture of a
[1:54:17] moralist
[1:54:20] as we would think today of a man that
[1:54:21] tries to think he's going to heaven just
[1:54:23] because he quit gambling. Or maybe he
[1:54:25] quit running with women that wasn't his
[1:54:28] wife or stopped his drinking on New
[1:54:29] Year's Day, turned over a new leaf and
[1:54:32] joined the church. You see, he doesn't
[1:54:35] he doesn't really convert it. He's just
[1:54:38] a moralist.
[1:54:40] The devil using moralists
[1:54:45] to go out and make a foolish
[1:54:50] representation.
[1:54:54] Do you understand? That's what happens
[1:54:56] has happened in our own ranks.
[1:54:59] Moralists have come.
[1:55:02] Some of them wound up being preachers
[1:55:07] moralist.
[1:55:09] Yeah, they were so great. And yeah,
[1:55:14] and Satan just takes and twists them
[1:55:16] around. As I said with preachers,
[1:55:19] how could a man that claims he really
[1:55:22] sees this end time message and stand up
[1:55:25] and preach it and ever walk away from it
[1:55:27] more than I can comprehend?
[1:55:30] I'm just glad I can't go that way.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Anybody else?
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; And the devil using moralist.
[1:55:40] Now you imagine not drunks and he does
[1:55:45] not somebody standing outside trying to
[1:55:47] sell our kids dope,
[1:55:49] but a moralist,
[1:55:51] a person that, oh, they're just so pure
[1:55:54] and so sanctified, this and that and the
[1:55:56] other.
[1:56:00] And the prophet said to make a foolish
[1:56:02] representation when really the real
[1:56:05] power of the living Christ
[1:56:09] isn't there.
[1:56:13] Can I read this last verse? Last 45.
[1:56:16] Verse 45. Yeah.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Now when Jesus comes back to this and he
[1:56:19] talks about this evil spirit going back
[1:56:21] in, then goeth he and take us with
[1:56:24] himself seven other spirits more wicked
[1:56:29] than himself.
[1:56:32] And they enter in and dwell there and
[1:56:34] the last state of that man is worse than
[1:56:36] the first. Now I want you to watch now.
[1:56:38] Jesus don't leave it with just the
[1:56:39] individual.
[1:56:41] Even so shall it be also unto this
[1:56:45] wicked
[1:56:46] generation.
[1:56:49] So he was speaking to individuals but he
[1:56:51] was also speaking to that generation of
[1:56:54] people. Why? Because they were being
[1:56:56] washed and they were hearing the word
[1:56:59] and no doubt things was happening but
[1:57:01] Jesus is warning them if you don't go up
[1:57:03] on the day of Pentecost and get the Holy
[1:57:05] Ghost.
[1:57:07] Listen friends, is it any wonder that
[1:57:09] our age, our generation is worse than
[1:57:14] any that's ever been on the earth?
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; God has done more in America than any
[1:57:21] other country on the face of the earth.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Sending his prophet from this place. Is
[1:57:26] it the truth? Yes.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; So when that demon returned and found
[1:57:33] demons that was worse than himself, our
[1:57:36] religious one of course is seven times
[1:57:37] worse as far as deception. We don't know
[1:57:40] exactly what these were. You see what
[1:57:42] Jesus done? He opened us up a sphere
[1:57:46] into this religious realm that demons
[1:57:50] will actually leave people and let them
[1:57:52] go to the altar or raise their hands.
[1:57:56] How many wants to accept Christ as their
[1:57:58] personal savior tonight? And people Yes.
[1:58:00] Yes. Praise the Lord. And that demon
[1:58:02] left them right before they walked into
[1:58:04] the church.
[1:58:08] And from the very beginning of the
[1:58:09] special singing, they felt so different
[1:58:12] and they thought, "This is something.
[1:58:14] I've never been to a church like this."
[1:58:16] That don't mean it's got anything to do
[1:58:18] with this church.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, I've never heard a song leader like
[1:58:22] that. I've never heard SP I've never
[1:58:23] heard a preacher. Oh, it was so awesome.
[1:58:26] Not necessarily.
[1:58:29] But that demon just chose to walk out
[1:58:32] because he saw the spirit of God dealing
[1:58:35] with their heart.
[1:58:37] Don't stop on being swept.
[1:58:41] Don't stop on being garnished.
[1:58:44] Make sure you're full of the Holy Ghost.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; That's what will back him off. Then
[1:58:54] you're children of the evening light.
[1:58:58] You see, we share that title so easily.
[1:59:01] We think because people play tapes and
[1:59:03] because they have a common vernacular as
[1:59:05] we do in the message community, seven
[1:59:07] seals, seven trumpets, you know, William
[1:59:09] Brandham and Malachi 4 and
[1:59:10] Jeffersonville and, you know, all these
[1:59:12] cliches that we have with that's that's
[1:59:14] evening light material. Not really
[1:59:17] evening light material. Those that are
[1:59:19] seeds
[1:59:20] and they're born
[1:59:22] by the spirit of God. I I started
[1:59:24] looking at the same
[1:59:27] all through the scripture, pulled up
[1:59:29] every verse beginning with Genesis where
[1:59:31] light and darkness, light and darkness,
[1:59:33] light and darkness, light and darkness,
[1:59:35] light and darkness is found in the
[1:59:37] Bible. Of course, you know where the
[1:59:38] first one is. When God separated the
[1:59:41] light from the darkness.
[1:59:45] Amen.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And the light he called day and
[1:59:49] the darkness he called night.
[1:59:52] Remember those seeds was laying there
[1:59:54] from some former civilization according
[1:59:56] to the third seal.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; So God was simply driving it back and
[2:00:02] dividing the day from the night. And God
[2:00:06] said, "All right, night, you stay over
[2:00:08] here, and day, you stay over here, and
[2:00:11] then you'll merge around, and you'll
[2:00:12] switch out, and it'll go from day to
[2:00:15] night, from night to day, day to night,
[2:00:17] night to day, and it'll follow this
[2:00:19] cycle." That's the way you are. You get
[2:00:22] born of the spirit of God. You're a
[2:00:24] mirror of this earth. Look outside. It's
[2:00:26] darkest pitch,
[2:00:30] but the sun will be up, Lord willing,
[2:00:31] again, in the morning. That's the way
[2:00:33] you are as a Christian. You've got that
[2:00:35] sun pulsating from your heart, your
[2:00:37] life, and you go through night times.
[2:00:39] How many goes through night times as a
[2:00:40] believer?
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; You go through night times and your walk
[2:00:43] with God. It feels like God's a million
[2:00:44] miles away. Hold on, children. You're in
[2:00:47] a night time. There'll be another
[2:00:49] sunrise.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; There'll be another sunrise.
[2:00:54] It'll be that way in the shadow.
[2:00:57] But can you imagine when I walk out of
[2:01:00] it,
[2:01:02] my little darling daughter
[2:01:06] was passing
[2:01:09] during their sycamore shows.
[2:01:13] I called brother Daryl and told him,
[2:01:14] "Brother Daryl, she if God don't move,
[2:01:16] she won't be here long. Would you come
[2:01:19] over?
[2:01:21] Text some of my preacher friends."
[2:01:25] and she's getting closer and closer.
[2:01:26] Most of our family was there,
[2:01:30] pulled out my phone,
[2:01:33] went to Psalm 23,
[2:01:36] and started reading it to her. The Lord
[2:01:39] is my shepherd,
[2:01:42] I shall not want.
[2:01:45] Started praying with her.
[2:01:48] Wasn't too long after that, the angels
[2:01:51] of God come in the room and carried her
[2:01:54] out.
[2:01:58] She entered into the earth. And when she
[2:01:59] entered into the earth, her birth
[2:02:02] brought tears.
[2:02:04] Her mama cried. I cried. My parents
[2:02:08] cried. Her mama cried when she saw her.
[2:02:12] When she left,
[2:02:14] it brought more tears.
[2:02:18] But she hasn't shed one since
[2:02:21] because she walked into the full image
[2:02:24] of light.
[2:02:27] Or if she could speak back down here
[2:02:29] tonight and said, "Daddy,
[2:02:32] you've preached about it for years and I
[2:02:34] heard you talk about it." She loved to
[2:02:36] talk about the Lord.
[2:02:38] She loved talking about the word. I'd
[2:02:40] take her to get her chemo and I'd take
[2:02:42] her for this and that and the other.
[2:02:44] Lance told me not long after she left
[2:02:46] this world said, "Brother Donnie, you'll
[2:02:48] never know what those days meant to her
[2:02:51] to spend time with you talking about the
[2:02:54] word."
[2:02:56] If she could speak back to us tonight,
[2:02:58] she said, "Daddy, you done as good a job
[2:03:00] as you could preaching about it, but
[2:03:03] believe me, you don't have a clue.
[2:03:08] You don't have a clue.
[2:03:12] Me and Brother Jimmy has been shouting
[2:03:14] up here for the last I don't know how
[2:03:15] long. Brother Calvin Ward, I went down
[2:03:19] to the river when he crossed and all
[2:03:21] these different ones. She said, "Daddy,
[2:03:24] I don't know if I've been gone 10
[2:03:26] minutes maybe."
[2:03:28] Oh, it seems like forever to us.
[2:03:32] I look at pictures of her and I feel
[2:03:33] like my heart is going to break.
[2:03:40] I just want to reach inside that
[2:03:41] picture, pull her out.
[2:03:46] But you see, it's my darkness.
[2:03:50] It's my darkness that's keeping me from
[2:03:53] seeing the light the way she sees it.
[2:03:59] Praise God.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; Don't you love the Lord?
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Let me share this with you.
[2:04:08] [snorts]
[2:04:08] Brother Joel and Sister Reinie would
[2:04:10] like to thank the saints for praying to
[2:04:11] the Lord for touching Hannah. Hannah
[2:04:14] went to the ER last night and she was
[2:04:16] lethargic, fevered, swelling from fluid
[2:04:19] retention. They're 95% sure she had
[2:04:23] scarlet fever. The infectious disease
[2:04:26] doctor told them he hadn't seen a case
[2:04:29] in over 30 years. He's running tests to
[2:04:32] rule out the other 5% could have been
[2:04:35] other issues other than scarlet fever.
[2:04:38] We're asking for prayers that those
[2:04:40] tests come back with a good report. When
[2:04:43] she got to the ER, they determined she
[2:04:45] could possibly be in congestive heart
[2:04:48] failure. Many people started praying and
[2:04:51] when the test came back,
[2:04:54] [snorts]
[2:04:55] her heart, kidney, and liver test are
[2:04:59] now normal.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; That's the God I'm talking about.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; We want to give God all the glory for
[2:05:14] Hannah's miraculous healing. Thank you
[2:05:17] all
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; for praying.
[2:05:20] I'll tell you, when you get in that kind
[2:05:21] of spot, it's good knowing we got a
[2:05:24] heavenly father that's in another
[2:05:25] dimension. But it sure is awful nice to
[2:05:27] know you got one with skin on it, too.
[2:05:29] Amen.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; That you can text him and reach out to
[2:05:32] him. Oh, I think he deserves a praise
[2:05:34] offering from us tonight. Satan,
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; thank you, Lord.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. [applause]
[2:05:46] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:05:48] [snorts] Let's just bow our heads
[2:05:50] together. Sorry for going over a little
[2:05:51] bit tonight. I'm sorry.
[2:05:55] Lord God, how we thank you. Father,
[2:05:59] I love this word so much. Jesus,
[2:06:03] [snorts]
[2:06:04] I feel sorry for those who got sick of
[2:06:06] it.
[2:06:08] I feel sorry for those who ate on it for
[2:06:10] years and years and never really found
[2:06:13] the substantial nourishment that was
[2:06:14] hidden there for them. I realize it's
[2:06:17] spiritual food in due season only to the
[2:06:19] elect.
[2:06:21] The others it makes them sick to their
[2:06:23] stomach.
[2:06:25] Lord God, we do not desire to be that
[2:06:29] parable that you unveiled.
[2:06:32] But Lord, we also know
[2:06:35] we're in this this realm of the stream
[2:06:37] of mortal time.
[2:06:40] We can feel the impact of these demons.
[2:06:43] We can feel it as they try to press
[2:06:45] against our minds, our bodies, our
[2:06:47] spirits.
[2:06:50] Lord, they know. I don't know how they
[2:06:51] know and what what signal it is, what
[2:06:53] what sign that it is,
[2:06:56] but there must be something so
[2:06:58] significant to them that they give up on
[2:07:02] trying to get the soul of one who's
[2:07:03] crossed the line.
[2:07:06] One who can never come back.
[2:07:09] So they focus on their body. They focus
[2:07:11] on their mind. They focus on their
[2:07:12] spirit which they still have access to.
[2:07:17] But we thank you tonight, Lord Jesus.
[2:07:20] Hallelujah.
[2:07:23] I know folks have got all kinds of hopes
[2:07:25] for 2026. Maybe it'll be the year of
[2:07:27] this and the year of that. Well, my
[2:07:29] greatest desire is it's the year of the
[2:07:32] rapture. The last one will come in,
[2:07:35] Lord, and we that are alive that we're
[2:07:37] here. Whatever's lacking in our walk,
[2:07:39] Father, that we'll get where we need to
[2:07:41] be. And Lord Jesus, we can call you and
[2:07:45] you will come and take us away.
[2:07:48] Oh, hallelujah. We worship you tonight,
[2:07:52] Father. Thank you for what you've done
[2:07:54] thus far for our sister Hannah. Lord, we
[2:07:58] are grateful, Lord. They're just telling
[2:08:00] me today as I talked to brother Joel
[2:08:01] early this morning and some different
[2:08:03] ones through the day about it. Lord, she
[2:08:05] picked up 12 pounds of fluid just in the
[2:08:08] last couple of days. And when they took
[2:08:11] her in, she looked like an old person
[2:08:13] that congestive heart failure. Oh, but
[2:08:17] our mighty God.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; Our mighty God, you wanted to manifest
[2:08:22] yourself, didn't you? Thank you, Lord.
[2:08:25] Oh, God. We always want hearts and lives
[2:08:28] that you can be free to manifest
[2:08:30] yourself, Lord Jesus.
[2:08:33] We worship you tonight, Father. We bless
[2:08:36] your name, Lord God.
[2:08:39] May we live closer to these realms above
[2:08:42] us and pull as far away as we can from
[2:08:45] those realms beneath us. Lord, help us.
[2:08:49] I pray, Lord Jesus, to be more like you.
[2:08:51] How many is that your greatest desire
[2:08:53] tonight? Would you just raise your hand
[2:08:54] as a witness to God? Father, that's my
[2:08:57] greatest desire to be more like you,
[2:08:59] Lord. Pull me close to you, Jesus.
[2:09:02] Pull us close, oh Lord God. Oh,
[2:09:05] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, this old
[2:09:08] cockleber will always be there and it'll
[2:09:10] always bother you. But one day you're
[2:09:12] going to be birthed. No more cocoa
[2:09:15] butter wheat, but total wheat again.
[2:09:19] Amen. Original seed brought back in a
[2:09:22] human body as a prophet tells us in
[2:09:24] Christ the mystery of God revealed
[2:09:26] eternal life in a human body.
[2:09:31] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord
[2:09:34] Jesus. We worship you, Father. Lord, for
[2:09:38] those that are sick, others that we've
[2:09:40] prayed for tonight, may the angels of
[2:09:42] healing go by their homes tonight, Lord.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; May they visit in their culde-sacs or
[2:09:48] their little cabin on the hill or their
[2:09:50] mobile home, whatever, whatever it is.
[2:09:53] Lord, may the spirit of God bring
[2:09:56] healing and deliverance, some dealing
[2:09:58] with flu and some dealing with different
[2:10:00] things. But Lord God, as your saints in
[2:10:02] your presence tonight under the
[2:10:04] influence of the Holy Ghost, we call for
[2:10:07] healing and we command them demons of
[2:10:09] sickness to take their hands off of the
[2:10:12] people of God. Satan, you're a liar. You
[2:10:15] high blood pressure devil, I rebuke you
[2:10:17] in the name of Jesus. You, oh sad,
[2:10:20] depressed devil, take your hands off of
[2:10:23] God's bride. She's a happy bride. She's
[2:10:26] a redeemed bride. Hallelujah. Lord God,
[2:10:31] break every hold of every evil spirit in
[2:10:33] this place. Not only this building, but
[2:10:35] wherever they're streaming tonight.
[2:10:37] Father, in the name of Jesus, we pray.
[2:10:41] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise
[2:10:44] the Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:10:47] Hallelujah.
