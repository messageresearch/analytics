[32:59] of the Lord? Yeah. One of these days,
[33:02] this building right here will be nothing
[33:04] no more than ash,
[33:07] the steel, the block, the wood, carpet,
[33:11] all the paint, and everything else
[33:13] totally annihilated.
[33:16] So, we want to have more than just a
[33:18] church building, don't we?
[33:20] We want to have the kingdom of God
[33:23] within us. And Jesus says it, "Lo, the
[33:27] kingdom of God is within you."
[33:31] I'm happy that it can be that way
[33:32] tonight. It's a privilege for us to be
[33:34] gathered together once again. Let's read
[33:37] if you would in Genesis 24 verse 21.
[33:41] Hope you're not getting tired of hearing
[33:42] these scriptures.
[33:46] I love prophecy that pertains to our
[33:50] day.
[33:51] Ellie and I was riding over to Kingsport
[33:53] one day this week and we were talking
[33:56] about driving because she was going to
[33:58] driving school. And so we were talking
[34:00] about driving and I told her, I said,
[34:03] Ellie, you know that a lot of people
[34:06] live their life on this earth and they
[34:08] live their entire life. They may have
[34:11] never saw one prophecy in the scripture
[34:14] fulfilled because sometimes it can go
[34:17] for hundreds of years before prophecy
[34:20] will be fulfilled. So there'll be the
[34:21] lifetime of this generation, nothing
[34:23] fulfilled. That generation, nothing
[34:25] fulfilled.
[34:27] And we were talking about cars. Of
[34:29] course, she's taking driving school. So
[34:31] I told her, I said, "Remember now,
[34:32] honey, in 1933,
[34:35] Brother Brandham saw the vision of a car
[34:39] shaped like an egg
[34:42] and he saw a family in that car with the
[34:45] table like and they were facing each
[34:47] other and they were playing games."
[34:51] I said, ' Now you in your lifetime have
[34:54] lived to see the age when brother Rob
[34:57] and I called your name could beckon his
[35:00] car to come around to the front door and
[35:03] pick him up. I said, "Have you seen
[35:04] that?" She said, "Yeah, Poppy, I've seen
[35:06] that."
[35:07] I said, 'Well, there's one of the
[35:09] brothers in our church that drives a
[35:10] truck, and he told me that he has seen
[35:12] in Las Vegas
[35:14] 40 foot tractors and trailers be
[35:17] probably 50 some feet with a tractor and
[35:19] everything on it back up to loading
[35:21] docks
[35:23] to unload freight by themsel. Yeah,
[35:28] that's pretty incredible to be able to
[35:29] pull one of them things forward. But to
[35:32] be able to back an 18-wheeler
[35:36] now, no doubt years ago when the prophet
[35:38] said that, people probably laughed and
[35:40] made fun of him and said all kinds of
[35:42] stuff about him, didn't he? But think
[35:44] how many prophecies have come to pass in
[35:48] your lifetime.
[35:50] And most of us are under 300, right? So,
[35:53] I mean, wow. Think of all the things
[35:55] that have come to pass in our day. All
[35:58] the riots going on in Los Angeles and
[36:00] more to come this week. No doubt. You
[36:02] know what it is? Another prophecy.
[36:05] Another prophecy as it was in the days
[36:08] of Noah. What was in the days of Noah?
[36:11] Destruction. Violence. Look how many
[36:15] times the word violence is used there in
[36:18] Genesis 6. When you see all this, it's
[36:21] another word being fulfilled.
[36:24] I know it. It's really sad. I'm waiting
[36:27] for my word to be fulfilled. Oh yeah. We
[36:30] also are prophecy. You believe it with
[36:33] all your heart. So let's read again now
[36:36] about this great great prophetic thing.
[36:40] For we know that sometimes God would
[36:41] take prophets and he would he would give
[36:44] them the inspired word and they would
[36:47] say, "Thus sayaith the Lord, this and
[36:50] this and this will happen." And that
[36:52] other times God would take prophetic
[36:55] symbols and write it in the lives of
[36:58] people and they never even said thus
[37:01] saith the Lord. But it was like the word
[37:04] prophetic form living out of their life.
[37:08] This is one of them here in Genesis 24.
[37:11] And the man wondering at her held his
[37:13] peace to wit whether the Lord had made
[37:16] his journey prosperous or not. And it
[37:20] came to pass as the camels had done
[37:22] drinking that the man took a golden
[37:24] earring of half a shekele of weight and
[37:27] two bracelets for her hands of 10
[37:29] shekels weight of gold. And said, "Whose
[37:33] daughter art thou? Tell me, I pray thee.
[37:35] Is there room in thy father's house for
[37:38] us to lodge in?" Now remember, he's not
[37:40] by himself.
[37:42] It's a one-man message,
[37:46] but there's other men that are helping
[37:48] pack it.
[37:50] [Music]
[37:51] Don't twist God's prophets words.
[37:57] It's damnable
[37:59] to do so. Amen. Eliza was not by
[38:02] himself.
[38:03] God sent brother Brandham in this day,
[38:06] but he's asked the question
[38:08] emphatically, "Are you the only one to
[38:12] preach?"
[38:13] That question and answer will condemn
[38:18] many people around this message who do
[38:20] not believe in preachers. That's right.
[38:22] Because God's prophet, who they say they
[38:25] believe, answered that question. We'll
[38:27] get to it tonight, maybe.
[38:29] Now notice,
[38:31] so he asked, "Is there room in your
[38:33] house?" "Yes, yes, there's room in the
[38:35] house." "Who daughter are you?" She
[38:36] tells him, verse 24, "And she said unto
[38:38] him, I am the daughter of Bethule, the
[38:40] son of Milka, which she bare unto
[38:43] Nahor." She said, "Moreover, unto him,
[38:46] we have both straw and proven enough and
[38:50] room to lodge in." And the man bowed
[38:53] down his head and worshiped the Lord.
[38:57] Well, let us bow down our heads and
[39:00] worship the Lord and pray.
[39:04] Heavenly Father, the prophet has taught
[39:06] us it's one of the greatest privileges
[39:09] that a mortal has
[39:12] is when he bows his head
[39:15] and calls on Father God.
[39:18] So Lord, we bow our heads tonight in
[39:21] your presence,
[39:23] thanking you once again for the
[39:24] opportunity that we can assemble
[39:26] ourselves together on Wednesday night.
[39:30] Oh, how we love church, Father.
[39:33] It's not so much the building. It's not
[39:35] just so much to see one another, though
[39:37] we do come for that as well, but to come
[39:41] into your presence.
[39:44] For Lord, I could get into the presence
[39:46] of my brothers and my sisters and have a
[39:49] great need and I might put on a smile
[39:51] and I might say something and they'd
[39:54] think everything is okay. But down in my
[39:57] heart, I'd be so burdened and so weary.
[40:01] But if I can get in your presence, you
[40:04] know what's in my heart and you can fix
[40:07] it for me. Amen. No doubt these people
[40:10] love me as their pastor and they would
[40:12] do anything and everything they could
[40:15] within their power to lighten my load. I
[40:18] don't think there's anyone here who
[40:21] calls this church their home church.
[40:24] Looks for the opportunity to add to my
[40:27] load. I don't think there's any of them
[40:30] that despise me and look for
[40:33] opportunities by which they can make me
[40:36] lose my sleep at night.
[40:39] Although I do.
[40:41] None of them are looking for
[40:42] opportunities by which they could hurt
[40:45] one another and spread rumors or lies.
[40:49] But sometimes we just don't know. We're
[40:52] just unaware.
[40:54] So, Father, we're in your presence now
[40:57] and you know our battles. You know our
[41:00] strengths. You know our weaknesses. You
[41:03] know our faults and you love us in spite
[41:06] of them all. So tonight, would you open
[41:09] your word to us, Jesus?
[41:11] I'm so needy of you, Father. I've
[41:14] studied. I've prayed. I've tried to do
[41:17] everything I know to do to present
[41:20] myself. So here I am your servant
[41:23] reporting for duty. Not only myself but
[41:27] here these other servants are here
[41:30] reporting for duty. So speak through me,
[41:33] hear through them. Live through us all
[41:37] to the glory of God. For it's in the
[41:40] name of Jesus Christ we ask it. Amen.
[41:43] Praise the Lord. You may be seated.
[41:51] So last Wednesday night we were looking
[41:53] at
[41:55] what was called
[41:58] the cuba.
[42:00] And the cuba
[42:02] was the marriage contract
[42:06] between
[42:08] a man and a woman. You never find no
[42:11] cuba ordained of God between two men.
[42:15] Come on.
[42:17] or two women
[42:20] only in a perverted age and nation. Will
[42:23] you see that?
[42:25] So the man had certain responsibilities
[42:30] and certain things
[42:32] by this binding vows of the cuba that he
[42:38] must be faithful to. He must be loyal
[42:42] to.
[42:44] Now, it was legally binding.
[42:49] If the man did not fulfill his part, the
[42:54] man could actually be sued.
[42:58] If the woman did not fulfill her part,
[43:02] she could also be sued or she could be
[43:07] put away. Now, I'm talking about in the
[43:10] engagement stage.
[43:13] So, they've not even drank the last cup
[43:17] of wine yet. They've not stood under the
[43:21] hoop. The man has not known her yet as
[43:25] his wife, but they agree to the contract
[43:30] or the covenant. Now, I'm sure that
[43:34] those of you that have read this, you've
[43:36] already noticed it, but I will point it
[43:38] out to you again that the bridegroom
[43:42] gives the bride certain gifts, not
[43:46] required by the cuba. So, the bridegroom
[43:50] is not required to give the bride gifts,
[43:55] but he does by choice.
[43:59] And then he will pick those gifts of
[44:02] what he thinks will impress her and also
[44:08] minister to her and meet certain needs
[44:12] and help her to fulfill also her part.
[44:17] And again, let me draw this to your
[44:19] attention that the bride does not give
[44:24] gifts
[44:26] to the bridegroom.
[44:29] So the gifts are always on the receiving
[44:33] end of the bride. The bridegroom
[44:38] does not receive gifts.
[44:42] Praise the Lord.
[44:45] Why? He don't need them.
[44:48] Now notice what the bride
[44:51] Well, brother Donnie, what she what she
[44:53] give to him? This is what he wants from
[44:58] her
[45:00] herself.
[45:03] He wants her. Now think this is still
[45:07] among many of the Jews the common
[45:09] practice to this day. So the
[45:12] bridegroom's family will send presents
[45:16] and different things to represent the
[45:19] notoriety notoriety rather and the
[45:22] royalty if he was royal or the richness
[45:26] of the father and what he was and it
[45:29] would speak to her. But again, the bride
[45:33] never gave gifts back to the
[45:36] bridegroom's mother and father or the
[45:39] bride never gave gifts back to the
[45:42] bridegroom.
[45:44] So you see the way they looked at it and
[45:47] still do the the family that received
[45:51] the bride was actually getting a great
[45:56] gift from her family.
[46:00] And they would give a bride price
[46:04] because in their view of it, whenever a
[46:07] man found a real woman, a real godly
[46:11] woman,
[46:13] she was a thing of such value.
[46:17] They felt they needed to give the
[46:21] family, the mother and father, a bride
[46:24] price because a mother and father was
[46:28] losing a great thing.
[46:32] And the bridegroom and his mother and
[46:36] father, they were gaining a great
[46:40] treasure,
[46:41] a great prize.
[46:44] Now I want you to notice that from the
[46:46] bridegroom's side it was not viewed that
[46:50] way. It was not viewed that the family
[46:54] of the bridegroom was losing a son.
[46:59] But it was viewed by the bridegroom's
[47:02] family that the bride's family was the
[47:06] one that was losing something. Amen. So
[47:11] from the bridegroom's family, it was
[47:14] viewed that they were the ones that was
[47:18] gaining so much. Oh my. If people only
[47:21] realize what the value of a real
[47:24] daughter of God not only was, but what
[47:28] she still is.
[47:30] Now, if you'll listen to that closely,
[47:32] you'll kind of get an understanding of
[47:34] why why you're valued so highly yourself
[47:38] a as the bride of Christ. But now, the
[47:41] bride never brought silver, gold,
[47:44] purple, linen, tapestry, you know,
[47:47] whatever her her father would have had
[47:50] and mother and herds and so on and so
[47:52] on. Uh, but even even brother Obadiah
[47:57] Kamati, any of y'all remember him? I
[47:58] know sister hope does. He used to be her
[48:00] pastor there in Kenya. But brother
[48:02] Kumadi came through here years and years
[48:04] ago and his wife and brother Kumladi had
[48:09] to to give a certain price for his wife.
[48:13] I don't remember exactly how many goats
[48:15] it was. You remember Carol? It was so
[48:17] many goats that he had to pay for his
[48:20] wife. So I mean that's not been hundreds
[48:23] of years ago. But because the same view
[48:27] was viewed by many of the African tribes
[48:30] to this same day. So by taking the bride
[48:34] then the bride was going to leave her
[48:37] home. She's going to leave her mother
[48:40] and her father and the groom is going to
[48:44] recompense her. He himself is going to
[48:48] give her personal endowment from his own
[48:52] wealth and his own riches to compensate
[48:57] hallelujah for the sacrifice
[49:00] of all she's going to give up for it.
[49:04] And his father and mother they said son
[49:07] we we we want to do likewise. We want to
[49:10] give to your bride to be and and also to
[49:14] her family because we know she's going
[49:18] to be a great lady and she'll be a a
[49:20] great matriarch of our family. Now
[49:24] remember it was very very important of
[49:27] course the sea line in the way that God
[49:31] dealing with the natural seed but it's
[49:33] not been that many years ago now for
[49:36] years and years breeders that hunted big
[49:39] massive buck deer and uh some farmers
[49:43] that took to raising deer and elk and
[49:46] different things like that. And for
[49:49] years and years it was thought to be
[49:52] that the bigger the buck and the more
[49:56] massive his horns and that would be the
[49:59] one that they would want. And they
[50:00] really didn't pay that much attention to
[50:02] the dough which is the female. But in
[50:06] the last I don't know how many years
[50:07] that it's been. But they've also began
[50:10] to realize that the dough herself
[50:15] mixing her genes with this certain buck
[50:18] will produce greater offspring. So they
[50:23] are realizing that even in the animal
[50:26] kingdom that it's not just the male but
[50:29] it's also the female. You see God
[50:32] already knew that law.
[50:34] God already knew that law in order for
[50:38] him to reproduce himself down through
[50:41] the church ages correctly. It was not
[50:45] enough that he be God. It was not enough
[50:49] that he be the word, but he must have a
[50:53] mate on earth that would match his word
[50:58] as close as could be matched for the
[51:01] anointing of that hour. And out of that
[51:04] union would produce the progeny of the
[51:07] church age that that message came into
[51:09] existence. Now, can't you see why the
[51:12] character of the bride in this going
[51:15] home time must match that of the groom?
[51:20] Can't you see why then that the church,
[51:23] the church per se, the outside church,
[51:26] the denominational systems and so on,
[51:28] for him to mix his promise seed word
[51:31] with them, what would it reproduce? What
[51:35] would it, you know, you takes just the
[51:37] genos of God and mix it into the womb of
[51:40] a person that picks and chooses what
[51:43] they want and well, we don't believe in
[51:45] tongues and we don't believe in the
[51:46] anointing and we don't believe in this
[51:48] and we don't believe in that. And then
[51:49] you mix the seed with that, what do you
[51:51] get? Another church member. But if Jesus
[51:55] could find a people, a bride whose, oh
[51:59] hallelujah, whose genes and whose
[52:02] spiritual DNA matches his own, and he
[52:06] could overshadow that bride church, and
[52:10] out of her will come offspring. What
[52:14] kind of young ones would they be? Acts
[52:16] 2:38. tongue speaking young ones. Well,
[52:20] that's what happened on the day of
[52:22] Pentecost. Is that right? That's what
[52:24] happened in the book of Acts. So, it
[52:26] were at the day when the very same thing
[52:30] not only can but will and is happening
[52:33] again on the earth. For the son of man,
[52:37] now listen to me carefully. I was
[52:39] thinking about the other day and I'd
[52:41] shared this with Carol. I I maybe have
[52:44] maybe crossed my mind before, but I I
[52:46] just could not remember it when the Lord
[52:49] spoke it to my heart. And it was I've
[52:52] been studying on the parallel of Paul's
[52:54] ministry and brother Random's ministry
[52:57] and in the New Testament how that God
[53:00] chose the church age messenger and the
[53:02] words that would come through him and
[53:06] every word that he spoke by the
[53:08] inspiration of God that Paul never said
[53:12] thus sayaeth the Lord women can't preach
[53:15] or thus sayeth the Lord you know this or
[53:18] thus sayeth the Lord as a matter of fact
[53:20] hard any in the New Testament. Yet they
[53:24] accepted those writings as straight from
[53:27] the spirit of God. And I begin to think
[53:30] about the parallel between Paul and
[53:32] between brother Brandham. And it just
[53:34] hit me like a bolt of lightning that
[53:37] Paul was the original church age
[53:39] messenger of course and had a great
[53:41] administration from the presence of God.
[53:44] But yet Paul never had the ministry of
[53:49] the son of man.
[53:52] Now see, Paul never one time claimed
[53:57] that the ministry of the son of man was
[54:00] being revealed through him in that
[54:03] church age. Now why? It had already come
[54:07] through the lord Jesus. So there was no
[54:10] promise in the Ephesian age with the
[54:14] first prophet church age messenger for
[54:17] the son of man to reoccur again in that
[54:21] first age. But he promised that he would
[54:24] come back in the layout of sin churches.
[54:27] So what would it be? A revealing of the
[54:31] son of man aresh. Praise be to God.
[54:35] Don't you understand that God never just
[54:37] sent a prophet in this last days, but it
[54:41] has been the personal ministry of the
[54:45] Lord Jesus in order to produce a bride
[54:49] like the original in the book of Acts.
[54:53] Oh, glory. It actually took more than
[54:56] just brother Brandham's ministry of
[54:59] Malachi 4. This is why he would make
[55:01] this remarkable statement and trying to
[55:04] do God a service in Streetport in 1965
[55:06] when he said, "Now the Elijah of this
[55:10] day is the Lord Jesus Christ. He's to
[55:14] come according to Luke 17:30." Now, wait
[55:18] a minute. I thought Malachi 4 was Elijah
[55:21] this day. Well, it is. It's the emerging
[55:24] of the son of man in the body of a son
[55:28] of man. Now think with me, friends. This
[55:31] never happened to Paul. Boy, some of
[55:33] you's about ready to scratch your head
[55:34] and say, "What in the world?" Think
[55:36] about it. It never happened in the days
[55:39] of Paul. Why? It was not needed. The son
[55:43] of man hadn't been gone from the earth
[55:45] that long. And that anointing was still
[55:49] there in the Ephesian age. Remember, the
[55:51] prophet tells us they were working under
[55:54] the anointing of Christ himself in that
[55:57] first church age. but knowing it was
[55:59] going to be lost down through the rest
[56:01] of the ages and he must come back
[56:04] himself in order to restore the birth
[56:08] anointing of the word. Now think of what
[56:11] we are living under then that will help
[56:14] bring us to this place and then think
[56:16] what people are turning down when they
[56:20] reject this message of the last day. It
[56:23] would be bad enough just to reject a
[56:26] prophet sent from God, vindicated by his
[56:28] presence. But they're not just turning
[56:30] down a prophet sent from God. They're
[56:33] turning down the visit of Jesus Christ
[56:37] himself in the ministry of son of man.
[56:41] And the church said,
[56:44] now think, so the bride, remember he
[56:46] tells us now proving his word that can
[56:50] you get it separated? Now, norm time it
[56:52] says it this way. Can you get it
[56:53] separate now? It seems to be so hard for
[56:56] you. The seventh angel is not the son of
[56:59] man, but he's revealing to the public
[57:02] the son of man. The son of man is
[57:05] Christ. You say, "How is that even
[57:06] possible?" The power of the blood could
[57:10] so cleanse a human being that the Lord
[57:13] Jesus could step inside a human being's
[57:16] body and use him for a moment of time to
[57:20] be able to call his bride. Now notice
[57:22] then he said and does God change his
[57:24] mind about his word? It will be take
[57:27] more than a clergyman to reveal the son
[57:30] of man in the last days. And it will be
[57:33] the Christ and the bride being joined
[57:35] together by what he said the revealing
[57:39] of the son of man. You see friend, we're
[57:42] not being married to brother Brandham.
[57:44] We're not being married to preachers in
[57:46] the message. We're being married to
[57:48] Christ the word. Now, this is why our
[57:52] attitude toward the word is what
[57:55] determines what our status is with God.
[57:59] If you will compromise on the word for
[58:02] anybody, any human being, that shows
[58:05] there's a lack in your love for the Lord
[58:07] Jesus and his word, that word ought to
[58:10] be the head of everything you do. And
[58:13] the church said, now watch, so the bride
[58:17] then she don't give gifts to the
[58:19] bridegroom. So whenever Eleazar come and
[58:23] ministered to the bride, she had certain
[58:26] gifts that was set aside for her. Then
[58:29] also there was gifts which was the bride
[58:32] price which would go to her father and
[58:35] her mother and her brother of course was
[58:37] the spokesman Laban. And their gifts
[58:40] were different. But the bride never
[58:42] turned right around Rebecca and told
[58:46] Eleazar how she thought the gifts ought
[58:49] to be operated.
[58:53] Amen. It was not the bride telling
[58:56] Eliza, "Now, don't put that on my hand.
[58:58] Put that on my head. Don't put that on
[59:01] my on my head. Put that on my foot.
[59:03] Don't put that here. Don't do this." It
[59:05] was not Rebecca telling Eleazar the
[59:08] order of the gifts. It was Eleazar
[59:11] showing Rebecca the order of the gifts.
[59:17] Oh, hallelujah. So she gave him no
[59:21] gifts, no gold, no silver, no tapestry
[59:23] as I said. So what is she going to give
[59:26] to him? Is she totally then exempt free
[59:29] where she doesn't have to do anything at
[59:31] all to where that there's no
[59:33] requirement? Oh no, there's great
[59:35] requirement of the bride. But it's just
[59:38] different than it was for the
[59:40] bridegroom. So the bride the bride's
[59:43] part, there was multiple layers to this,
[59:46] but one of the first and foremost was
[59:48] that it was going to be an un an an
[59:51] undistracted
[59:53] devotion. So there's nothing that will
[59:56] distract her from this time on. Now
[59:59] remember what's going on with Rebecca.
[1:00:01] With each statement, positive
[1:00:03] affirmation that she's going to respond
[1:00:06] to this messenger, she's going deeper
[1:00:09] and deeper into the cuba, into the
[1:00:12] marriage contract. Now, she's going to
[1:00:15] be asked a question. We'll get to it. I
[1:00:17] doubt it tonight, but she's going to be
[1:00:19] asked a question which is going to
[1:00:22] further affirm and is going to match
[1:00:25] what the messenger said. I'll go and
[1:00:27] just give you a little touch of it. But
[1:00:28] the messenger says, "Now look, God's
[1:00:30] blessed me, and this is all worked out.
[1:00:32] Now, Rebecca had gone maybe to bed. We
[1:00:35] don't know exactly where she was at, but
[1:00:36] he's speaking to her brother and her
[1:00:39] brother, and he said, "Let her go. We're
[1:00:41] leaving in the morning." And they said,
[1:00:43] "Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait
[1:00:44] a minute. We We don't want you to be in
[1:00:45] no hurry. We We want her to stay with us
[1:00:48] for a while, at least 10 days. But now
[1:00:52] watch the messenger." And the messenger
[1:00:55] said, "Do not hinder me. Don't you stop
[1:00:58] me. Don't you delay me. God has blessed
[1:01:01] me and we need to head out in the
[1:01:05] morning."
[1:01:07] Now, she's not there.
[1:01:09] So they said, "We will call the maid and
[1:01:13] ask her." Now, Rebecca, what are you
[1:01:16] going to say? You going to say what your
[1:01:18] brother said? You going to say what your
[1:01:21] mama said?
[1:01:22] Are you going to say what the messenger
[1:01:24] said? I ask you, you going to say what
[1:01:27] your best friend said? You going to say
[1:01:29] what your buddy said, your pal said,
[1:01:32] your mama said, your grandpa said? If
[1:01:35] grandpa says something different for the
[1:01:36] messenger, you better forget grandpa and
[1:01:39] follow this messenger home. Yes, sir.
[1:01:42] Well, praise the Lord. So, she then they
[1:01:47] call her. Now, she didn't hear what the
[1:01:50] messenger said. She didn't hear it, but
[1:01:52] she was already working on the unseen
[1:01:55] faith of Abraham to call those things
[1:01:58] which were not as though they were. And
[1:02:00] she was with joy going to leave with
[1:02:03] this man and marry a man she had never
[1:02:06] seen before. How could she do that? She
[1:02:08] had Abraham's face. So, she just
[1:02:11] believed this man was a kind of man she
[1:02:14] would love with all of her soul. Just in
[1:02:17] hearing his name and hearing the
[1:02:19] messenger describe him and talk about
[1:02:21] him, he created such a love between them
[1:02:26] that she said, "I can't wait to marry
[1:02:28] this man. Oh, I I'm absolutely gone." So
[1:02:30] now they call her and they said, "Will
[1:02:33] you go with this man?" And she said, "I
[1:02:37] will go." Now what? Now she's saying
[1:02:41] what the messenger said. Well, praise be
[1:02:44] to God. Now, he didn't have to slip her
[1:02:46] a note or try to fax her somehow or text
[1:02:49] her or messenger on Instagram or
[1:02:52] something like that. He didn't do that
[1:02:54] because the Instagram had already come
[1:02:56] from up here in heaven. She had a divine
[1:02:58] deposit by the angel of God and she was
[1:03:02] able to speak what that messenger was
[1:03:04] saying even though her brother said
[1:03:07] opposite and her mother said opposite.
[1:03:10] You understand? And that's where a lot
[1:03:11] of folks make their mistakes. When God
[1:03:13] goes to dealing with their heart and
[1:03:15] what do they do? They put it off to next
[1:03:17] week or they put it off to the youth
[1:03:20] camp. You might not live to the youth
[1:03:22] camp. If God is dealing with you
[1:03:24] tonight, give him your all. Whatever
[1:03:27] God's pulling on you to do, don't you
[1:03:30] delay, my brother, sister.
[1:03:34] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:03:35] In this there must be an undistracted
[1:03:40] devotion. So we're not to be distracted
[1:03:43] like now now with us. She once she's
[1:03:46] entering into the cuba was a man that
[1:03:49] she's never met before, she's going to
[1:03:52] now change her thinking. She's going to
[1:03:55] merge into the thinking of God's
[1:03:58] messenger in that day which was Eleazar.
[1:04:02] So he says certain things out of her
[1:04:05] presence. If she's really the bride,
[1:04:08] she's going to answer back the same
[1:04:10] thing.
[1:04:12] She ain't going to argue with him and
[1:04:14] join sides with her mother and her
[1:04:16] brothers. And you know what? Ain't this
[1:04:18] just fair? Ain't this fair? I'm a
[1:04:20] 16-year-old girl. Will you ever bring me
[1:04:22] back to see my mama again? Will I ever
[1:04:25] get to see my brother again? There is no
[1:04:26] scripture any history that I could find
[1:04:28] that Rebecca ever made one trip back to
[1:04:31] that homeland again. She's leaving
[1:04:33] forever. Well, that's the way I left
[1:04:35] Pentecost.
[1:04:38] That's the way you left Lucer Methodist
[1:04:40] Baptist Church of God. Is that right? I
[1:04:42] I did not leave and and keep my boat my
[1:04:45] Pentecostal boat tied up down by the
[1:04:47] river down there somewhere. I did not
[1:04:49] leave and leave the bridge wide open. I
[1:04:52] blowed up the bridge. I burned the boat.
[1:04:54] Hallelujah. Brother Larry, we ain't got
[1:04:56] no way back. And I don't want to go back
[1:04:59] because I've already entered into a
[1:05:01] contract with my husband and he and I
[1:05:05] are learning one another more and more.
[1:05:07] And I love him more than I ever did. But
[1:05:10] he can't love me more and he can't love
[1:05:13] you more. He don't love you more when
[1:05:15] you're really good and love you less
[1:05:18] when you mess up. He loves you the same
[1:05:21] whether you're up or whether you're
[1:05:23] down, when you're weary, when you're
[1:05:25] sick. His love for you does not change.
[1:05:28] It never has and it never will.
[1:05:39] So what does he want from me, brother
[1:05:41] Donnie? Your undistracted
[1:05:45] devotion.
[1:05:49] In other words, you love him like you
[1:05:52] love no one else or anything else.
[1:05:58] We're in an age when people love things.
[1:06:04] Things,
[1:06:06] possessions, wealth, property. Come on,
[1:06:10] somebody.
[1:06:14] But God don't want his bride to be this
[1:06:16] way. Now, we're in this world. We know,
[1:06:18] but we're not of it. Well, brother Don,
[1:06:20] is it wrong for me to like my house? No.
[1:06:23] Is it wrong for us to enjoy our
[1:06:25] building? No. Do we enjoy it? Yes. Not
[1:06:28] only us, but many others have been able
[1:06:29] to enjoy and it's been a blessing to
[1:06:31] them as well. But God don't want us to
[1:06:33] put this building, our home, our job,
[1:06:35] our car, our clothes, or nothing else in
[1:06:38] front of him. He wants our undistracted
[1:06:43] devotion.
[1:06:45] Amen. Amen. So, some of you young
[1:06:48] brothers that aren't married
[1:06:50] and you would talk to one of the sisters
[1:06:52] at our church and you are courting with
[1:06:56] them and you decide you want to take her
[1:06:59] out for supper one night. You ask her
[1:07:01] father it's okay with him. He says,
[1:07:02] "Sure. Y'all y'all able to go? You know,
[1:07:05] just be home at a certain time and you
[1:07:06] know, gives all the rules and the
[1:07:08] regulations and the restrictions and and
[1:07:10] all that sort of thing. And the whole
[1:07:12] time you're sitting there eating, she's
[1:07:14] sitting there looking at some other boy.
[1:07:16] Oh my. And said, and she turns to you
[1:07:19] and says, "I love his eyebrows.
[1:07:23] His nose is so cute and the shape of his
[1:07:27] ears.
[1:07:29] Would you care to go over and ask him
[1:07:30] what his name is for me?"
[1:07:36] Now, brothers, unless you really, really
[1:07:39] like that old girl, you're probably
[1:07:41] going to tell her to buy her own supper.
[1:07:44] You're probably going to get up and go
[1:07:45] to the house.
[1:07:47] How do you think Jesus feels
[1:07:51] when we love him so much on Wednesday
[1:07:54] and Sunday?
[1:07:57] And then we're peering at this table and
[1:07:59] looking at that table and looking over
[1:08:01] here and looking over there all the rest
[1:08:03] of the week.
[1:08:08] Preach, Brother Donnie.
[1:08:11] You see, he doesn't really ask that much
[1:08:16] for all that it cost him for me.
[1:08:21] So, if I live next month, I'll be 69
[1:08:25] years old. Seemed like a long time to
[1:08:27] me.
[1:08:28] But in the big grand scheme of things,
[1:08:31] what is if I died next month? What is 69
[1:08:35] years compared to eternity?
[1:08:40] I've been preaching 51, 52 years,
[1:08:43] something like that. You said, "Wow,
[1:08:45] that's a long time." I tell me about it.
[1:08:48] But what is that in comparison, brother
[1:08:51] Ben? To eternity.
[1:08:53] And it seemed like, oh, we're giving up
[1:08:55] so much and we're doing this. But when
[1:08:57] you look at it and weigh it all out,
[1:09:01] if you live to be 500 years old and you
[1:09:05] served him every day of your life, it
[1:09:07] would be so small compared to thousands
[1:09:11] and millions of years. Even if we was
[1:09:13] keeping track of it.
[1:09:18] So what does he want? My undistracted
[1:09:22] devotion.
[1:09:24] So he doesn't want me distracted
[1:09:28] by false teachers
[1:09:31] or false doctrine. Praise the Lord.
[1:09:35] Notice here in 2 John 1:7. For many
[1:09:39] deceivers are entered into the world who
[1:09:43] confess not that Jesus Christ is come in
[1:09:47] the flesh. Notice John don't say has
[1:09:49] past tense
[1:09:52] but is present tense. You see they
[1:09:54] believed that Jesus Christ was what come
[1:09:58] back on the day of Pentecost not another
[1:10:01] person.
[1:10:03] Amen. Praise the Lord. So they believe
[1:10:06] they received the portion of Jesus
[1:10:09] Christ on the day of Pentecost and John
[1:10:11] was right there in the upper room. He
[1:10:13] got his portion of Jesus. So he said,
[1:10:16] "Whoever don't believe that Jesus Christ
[1:10:19] is come in the flesh," notice what he
[1:10:21] calls them. This is a deceiver and an
[1:10:24] antichrist.
[1:10:26] Yes, sir. Praise the Lord. Look to
[1:10:30] yourselves
[1:10:31] that we lose not those things which we
[1:10:35] have wrought, but that we receive a full
[1:10:38] reward. Now your John is warning the
[1:10:41] people then that they would not become
[1:10:44] distracted already. Remember that white
[1:10:46] horse rider was riding through the land
[1:10:48] and doctrines was going everywhere. They
[1:10:51] were following Paul. They were following
[1:10:53] Peter and they were going right in
[1:10:55] behind them because remember the devil
[1:10:57] is a never he's never the first
[1:10:59] missionary. He's never the original
[1:11:01] missionary. But he waits till God's men
[1:11:03] go in and they establish a work and then
[1:11:06] the devil comes in behind them. Amen.
[1:11:08] Well, that's exactly right. But John
[1:11:10] said, "Look to yourselves that we lose
[1:11:15] not." So, how could they lose it? By
[1:11:17] becoming distracted. Oh, yes, friends.
[1:11:20] We've got to know false prophets. We've
[1:11:22] got to know false doctrine. But I don't
[1:11:24] mind telling you right here tonight. I
[1:11:26] spend much more time studying the truth
[1:11:29] than I do lies.
[1:11:31] Oh, yes. I if I hear this been said and
[1:11:34] that being said and that being said, I
[1:11:36] want to study it so I can give an answer
[1:11:39] so I can bring you the correct answer.
[1:11:41] But I do not spend most of my time
[1:11:44] studying on false doctrine and studying
[1:11:47] on this lie and that lie that people are
[1:11:50] saying. I'm not going to spend the rest
[1:11:52] of my life trying to disprove the
[1:11:54] believe the sign people and all that
[1:11:56] sort of thing because you're not going
[1:11:58] to disprove them anyway. I and I don't I
[1:12:01] don't have to have it myself. Do you
[1:12:03] believe? I don't have to hold a a paper
[1:12:06] from Louisville, Kentucky. I don't have
[1:12:08] to this and that and the other. You know
[1:12:10] what? Rebecca didn't have to have a
[1:12:12] text. She didn't even have a Bible. But
[1:12:15] she had the same faith that Abraham had.
[1:12:18] And she'd never even seen Abraham. I've
[1:12:20] got the same faith tonight that Abraham
[1:12:23] had. It's the same faith that John had,
[1:12:25] Peter had, James had, Paul had, Brother
[1:12:28] Brandham had. And that's why that I'm
[1:12:30] going in the rapture and you're going in
[1:12:33] the rapture because we have one Lord,
[1:12:35] one faith, one baptism.
[1:12:39] Exact same faith they had.
[1:12:46] So we must
[1:12:48] identify such things but don't let us
[1:12:52] become so distracted
[1:12:54] that that's all we think about the false
[1:12:56] the error the false the wrong. Oh the
[1:12:58] false the false. Yes the false is always
[1:13:00] going to be here but don't let it steal
[1:13:03] your joy from the good that's around us
[1:13:05] every day.
[1:13:07] Now notice another thing that the bride
[1:13:10] must give to the groom.
[1:13:13] Oh, these things that may sound pretty
[1:13:15] simple, but it's not really that easy to
[1:13:18] do unless you've got the love for him in
[1:13:20] your heart. So, they can't be distracted
[1:13:23] by worldly things.
[1:13:28] First John 2:15,
[1:13:30] love not the cosmos.
[1:13:35] Now, that word world is cosmos, which
[1:13:37] means the world order. So, it's not the
[1:13:42] earth.
[1:13:44] I love trees. Don't you? I love trees.
[1:13:47] Rocks. Oh, I love rocks. I know I'm
[1:13:50] crazy, right? I love rocks. I love
[1:13:53] streams. I I I I just love nature. My
[1:13:56] daddy made it. I love it. So, it's not
[1:13:58] that's not what he's talking about. But
[1:14:00] he's talking about the order of the day.
[1:14:02] So if you think this is a fine day to
[1:14:04] live and this is a great day with all
[1:14:06] the sin and the debaucher and the filth
[1:14:08] that's around us there's something wrong
[1:14:10] with your love life. Now notice how this
[1:14:13] how severe this is. Love not the world
[1:14:16] neither the things that are in the
[1:14:18] world. So the things of the world order.
[1:14:21] Oh you say brother Donnie I'll tell you
[1:14:23] one thing. I just wish everybody would
[1:14:25] become a Republican and they'd all be
[1:14:27] Christians. Look friend, every
[1:14:29] Republican ain't a Christian. Every
[1:14:31] Republican ain't got the Holy Ghost.
[1:14:33] There's some in this church that ain't.
[1:14:35] Well, come on now. Said, "Well, if we
[1:14:36] could just turn America back to being
[1:14:39] Republican, America is too far gone.
[1:14:42] America will never be redeemed. It will
[1:14:44] not be the Republican party that will
[1:14:47] save this world. There's only one that
[1:14:49] can save this world, and it ain't Donald
[1:14:52] Trump. It's not Benjamin Netanyahu. It
[1:14:55] is the Lord Jesus Christ. He's the only
[1:14:59] hope that there is left for this world.
[1:15:06] Love not the world, neither the things
[1:15:08] that are in the world.
[1:15:11] If any man love the world, listen how
[1:15:13] plain and simple this is. If any man
[1:15:15] love the world,
[1:15:17] the love of the father
[1:15:20] is not in him.
[1:15:24] Amen. Amen. Quite plain and simple,
[1:15:26] right?
[1:15:31] Notice these are things that the bride
[1:15:34] must be. So Rebecca from this point on
[1:15:38] is going to act like a married woman.
[1:15:46] She's no longer
[1:15:49] no longer a free woman. That's right. So
[1:15:54] any suitors that was in the neighborhood
[1:15:59] were all officially put at bay.
[1:16:03] No more knocking on her door. That's
[1:16:05] right. Amen.
[1:16:08] Praise the Lord. Amen. Now Isaac didn't
[1:16:11] know it yet, but he was also hitched.
[1:16:14] Now remember, no communication going on
[1:16:17] between Eleazar and Isaac. So he's just
[1:16:19] praying and praying. You remember how
[1:16:21] what kind of condition he was in, don't
[1:16:23] you? And whenever they finally found
[1:16:24] him, he was out in the field meditating.
[1:16:26] Boy, that's what you better do. You're
[1:16:28] fixing to get a wife, you better pray
[1:16:30] and meditate, sis. Same thing for you.
[1:16:32] He was out there meditating and praying,
[1:16:34] walking up and down the field. I love
[1:16:36] that because the very thing he was
[1:16:37] doing, God sent his bride right in his
[1:16:39] lap, right in the middle of his
[1:16:41] meditation. What a way to have your
[1:16:42] meditation broke up. When here comes
[1:16:45] your beloved bride, first time you ever
[1:16:46] seen her in your life, and you look her
[1:16:48] straight in the eye, and she looks you
[1:16:50] straight in the eye, instantly you fall
[1:16:52] madly in love with each other, and you
[1:16:54] think, "I couldn't done no better if I
[1:16:56] would have handpicked you myself." Let
[1:16:58] me tell you this, brother, sister. Those
[1:17:01] who live this world in the last days in
[1:17:03] a rapture, it's like the Lord Jesus
[1:17:06] personally going around the world and
[1:17:08] knocking on every lack seed's heart and
[1:17:11] calling them out and separating them and
[1:17:14] filling them with the Holy Ghost. How's
[1:17:16] he doing it? Through the revealed word
[1:17:18] of this hour. And this message will make
[1:17:21] Christ Jesus so real. We won't need 40
[1:17:24] days to find out about him. We don't
[1:17:27] need six months. This word declares him
[1:17:30] so much we fall madly in love with him
[1:17:33] just hearing about him as the preachers
[1:17:35] preach about it.
[1:17:48] I know what it's like to fall in love
[1:17:49] with somebody
[1:17:52] at first glance.
[1:17:59] Now, bless her heart, it took her a
[1:18:00] little while. Of course, I don't blame
[1:18:02] her with a face like mine, you know.
[1:18:08] But when I saw that little lady
[1:18:11] at 16 years old,
[1:18:15] I just
[1:18:17] I can't explain it to you.
[1:18:21] She captured me.
[1:18:30] Don't you understand
[1:18:32] that's exactly
[1:18:34] what you did to him?
[1:18:38] In the Song of Solomon, he said, "Turn
[1:18:40] your eyes away from me. For one of your
[1:18:43] eyes has captured me
[1:18:48] just thinking of you, you were not even
[1:18:52] in existence."
[1:18:54] He could go through all he went through
[1:18:57] for the joy. Paul says in the book of
[1:18:59] Hebrews, for the joy that was set before
[1:19:01] him, just thinking about you, he went to
[1:19:04] the cross. Just thinking about you, they
[1:19:07] beat him till he was so weak, he could
[1:19:09] hardly walk. He hadn't even met you yet.
[1:19:12] He hadn't even looked you in the face.
[1:19:14] You didn't have a face. He had never
[1:19:17] shook your hand. But just his love for
[1:19:20] you made him so willing for the joy that
[1:19:25] was set before him. Looking at the
[1:19:27] cross, despising the shame. Hallelujah.
[1:19:31] How do we go through what we go through
[1:19:33] as children of God for the joy that is
[1:19:35] set before us? One day I will see my
[1:19:38] Lord. It will be worth everything that
[1:19:41] you and I go through in this life for
[1:19:43] five moments in his presence.
[1:19:47] That's right.
[1:19:50] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:19:56] You see, when one soul falls in love,
[1:20:02] it's hard to describe it. Now, my mom
[1:20:05] and daddy, I understand as I as I got
[1:20:08] older, I understood better.
[1:20:11] My mom and daddy was really worried
[1:20:14] about me.
[1:20:16] I mean, I was just 16, you know,
[1:20:19] and they thought I had flipped out.
[1:20:24] I know you young people don't know what
[1:20:25] that even means, do you?
[1:20:29] They thought I went crazy
[1:20:32] cuz I talked about her. I wanted to be
[1:20:35] around her. I loved her.
[1:20:40] Me and my mama was pretty close. And
[1:20:42] mama, you know who talked to me now?
[1:20:43] Donnie, Donnie, you know, the Lord's
[1:20:45] called you to be something. You ought to
[1:20:46] be careful. You know, you don't want the
[1:20:49] devil to lay a trap for you. You really
[1:20:51] don't know her that well, and you know
[1:20:53] this and that and the other.
[1:20:55] I said, "But mama,
[1:20:58] I think I love her. I love her."
[1:21:03] You said, "Brother Donnie, I feel that
[1:21:05] way." Get a queasy feeling around
[1:21:06] somebody. Sometimes that's what you eat.
[1:21:11] It's more than queasiness that you want
[1:21:13] to marry somebody cuz a lot of times
[1:21:15] Alka-Seltzer can take care of you queasy
[1:21:18] and if they queasy easy then you don't
[1:21:20] love them buddy.
[1:21:22] Now it took her a little while
[1:21:25] kind of like some of us with Jesus.
[1:21:31] And on whatever we do finally realize
[1:21:37] he's the love of my life.
[1:21:43] Now, Carol's daddy was not a saved man
[1:21:46] and he was a mean man.
[1:21:49] And let me tell you right now, this old
[1:21:50] boy right here was scared to death of
[1:21:53] him.
[1:21:56] So me and Carol talked back and forth,
[1:21:57] back and forth. We talked about marriage
[1:22:00] and all that.
[1:22:01] He was sitting on the front porch one
[1:22:02] day and I walked out. His name is
[1:22:04] Vernon. I I said, "Vernon,
[1:22:07] I want to talk to you about something."
[1:22:08] He's sitting in a rocking chair on the
[1:22:09] front porch.
[1:22:12] He looked up at me like that and said,
[1:22:13] "Yeah."
[1:22:16] I said, "I love Carol.
[1:22:19] I want to marry her."
[1:22:24] Yeah, I figured it.
[1:22:29] I'll let you, but I'll tell you one
[1:22:32] thing. If you ever hurt her, I'll kill
[1:22:37] you.
[1:22:39] And I believed him. I still ain't hurt
[1:22:42] her.
[1:22:45] [Music]
[1:22:50] I believe, Carol, he sensed
[1:22:53] the love that we had for each other.
[1:22:56] I believe that love spoke
[1:23:00] that he would be willing
[1:23:03] to give me his daughter.
[1:23:06] If a man can love a woman like that and
[1:23:09] a woman love a man back that way and
[1:23:12] that love can be read
[1:23:15] by other people.
[1:23:18] What about the love of God?
[1:23:22] Hallelujah.
[1:23:24] Don't you let that lying devil ever try
[1:23:28] to talk you out of the great display of
[1:23:31] the love that God has shown to you every
[1:23:33] day that you've lived on this earth. He
[1:23:36] loved you when you was lost. He loved
[1:23:38] you when you were blind. He saved some
[1:23:41] of you when you should have died back
[1:23:43] there as a sinner. But he would not let
[1:23:46] you die unprepared because your name was
[1:23:50] on that lamb's book of life. And there
[1:23:52] was not enough devils in hell to take
[1:23:56] you out of this life until you were
[1:23:59] filled with the Holy Ghost and built up
[1:24:01] into the stature of a perfect man or
[1:24:04] woman of God.
[1:24:15] You see another thing this bride must do
[1:24:19] this is in her cubanel
[1:24:22] she must live
[1:24:26] and anticipate
[1:24:29] his coming.
[1:24:34] Now I find this this scenario here with
[1:24:36] Isaac and Rebecca being you know it's
[1:24:39] different than the normal Jewish
[1:24:42] scenario
[1:24:43] but to me it is so perfect with what the
[1:24:47] prophet said
[1:24:49] when he said the coming of the Lord
[1:24:53] is a sudden secret going away.
[1:24:58] So a coming is a going.
[1:25:03] Now I want you to notice Isaac coming to
[1:25:06] his bride was also a middle of the
[1:25:10] equation was his coming could not be
[1:25:14] fulfilled until she went.
[1:25:18] So the coming of Isaac was a going of
[1:25:21] Rebecca. So it was her going.
[1:25:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It was her going
[1:25:27] to meet her bridegroom. And what did he
[1:25:30] do? He was down on the south. Now, he
[1:25:32] was not even staying where Abraham had
[1:25:35] his little tent. He was down. He had
[1:25:37] left his home. He might not have even
[1:25:40] know, you know, what he was even doing
[1:25:42] down there. How in the world is what I
[1:25:44] want to know? Because when Eleazer left
[1:25:47] him some hundreds of miles away and all
[1:25:51] them days had gone by, when he left him,
[1:25:54] he was in one part of the country. But
[1:25:56] whenever he went back, glory to God,
[1:25:59] what happened? He knew exactly where to
[1:26:01] take that bride to. And it wasn't the
[1:26:04] same place that he left from. He his
[1:26:06] corporal body left the Mount of Olives.
[1:26:09] But this message and messenger and the
[1:26:12] resurrection will take us where? Not
[1:26:15] back to the Mount of Olives, but we will
[1:26:17] meet him in the middle of the air. Why?
[1:26:20] He left his home. We leave our home. The
[1:26:24] coming of the Lord is a sudden secret
[1:26:26] going away.
[1:26:28] [Applause]
[1:26:33] Notice in Matthew 24:42,
[1:26:38] "Watch therefore,
[1:26:42] for you know not
[1:26:44] what hour
[1:26:46] your Lord
[1:26:49] doth come."
[1:26:51] But know this, if the good man of the
[1:26:54] house had have known and what watch the
[1:26:59] thief would come, he would not have
[1:27:02] watch and would not have suffered his
[1:27:04] house to be broken up. Therefore, be ye
[1:27:08] also ready.
[1:27:10] For in such an hour as you think not,
[1:27:15] notice, not son of God,
[1:27:19] but the son of man.
[1:27:22] Not son of God,
[1:27:25] son of man.
[1:27:28] Hey, you see the church world is waiting
[1:27:32] for the coming of the son of man to
[1:27:35] fulfill these scriptures.
[1:27:39] But the next time we see him, it will
[1:27:43] not be so much son of man.
[1:27:46] It will be son of God
[1:27:49] fixing to go into the millennium. It's
[1:27:51] just a three and a half year span after
[1:27:53] the tribulation period as son of David.
[1:27:58] But he must be revealed
[1:28:00] between that time as son of man to usher
[1:28:04] in the rapture.
[1:28:07] Therefore be ye also ready. For in such
[1:28:11] an hour as you think not, the Son of Man
[1:28:15] cometh. And I'll quote it to you. It
[1:28:17] just comes to my mind now. Did not put
[1:28:19] it in the notes, but Luke 21:36.
[1:28:23] Pray ye therefore always
[1:28:26] that you may be accounted worthy to
[1:28:29] escape all these things that shall come
[1:28:31] to pass,
[1:28:34] and stand before the Son of Man.
[1:28:38] Yes, sir.
[1:28:40] Remember God called Daniel
[1:28:43] son of man.
[1:28:46] Ezekiel
[1:28:47] son of man. What is son of man?
[1:28:51] That great visitation of the presence of
[1:28:54] God.
[1:28:55] Hallelujah.
[1:28:58] Hallelujah.
[1:29:01] Notice now the bride
[1:29:03] must also
[1:29:06] be set apart,
[1:29:09] sanctified.
[1:29:11] Now by this I don't mean that we go
[1:29:14] around with a, you know, more righteous
[1:29:16] than thou type of attitude. And you
[1:29:19] know, we can't be like the Pharisees
[1:29:21] were, you know, if they'd go to the
[1:29:22] market and stuff before they'd ever eat
[1:29:25] their lunch, they'd come back in home
[1:29:27] and wash from here up to their elbows.
[1:29:29] They wouldn't even touch the the woman
[1:29:32] that touched the hem of Jesus garment by
[1:29:35] Levitical law. Jesus was unclean.
[1:29:39] You imagine the lepers that Jesus laid
[1:29:42] his hands on and healed them by the
[1:29:44] Levitical law. Them Pharisees would have
[1:29:46] never done that. Yes, sir. They would
[1:29:49] have made Jesus unclean. How different
[1:29:51] the New Testament was. Jesus made the
[1:29:54] unclean clean. And the unclean didn't
[1:29:56] make him unclean. Praise be to God.
[1:29:59] Don't you understand? He took our filths
[1:30:02] and our filths never made him
[1:30:04] contaminated. Glory to God. There's a
[1:30:07] sermon within itself. Our filth did not
[1:30:09] make him contaminated, but he took our
[1:30:13] filth and made us clean. And when he got
[1:30:16] done cleaning, he was still the sinless
[1:30:18] son of God.
[1:30:20] He could carry our filth and destroy it.
[1:30:26] Oh my. We've been reading this in 2
[1:30:28] Corinthians 11:2. For I am jealous over
[1:30:30] you with a godly jealousy, for I have
[1:30:33] espoused you to one husband that I may
[1:30:36] present you as a chasteed virgin to
[1:30:39] Christ. So this is part of the bride's
[1:30:42] part of the cuba that the bride will be
[1:30:45] separated unto him. Not a cult now, not
[1:30:48] a click, not nothing like that, but what
[1:30:51] he says he wants us to do. 1
[1:30:53] Thessalonians 4:3, "For this is the will
[1:30:56] of God, even your sanctification,
[1:31:00] that ye should abstain
[1:31:03] from fornication."
[1:31:05] Listen to this verse for what? How
[1:31:07] powerful. That every one of you should
[1:31:11] know how to possess his vessel in
[1:31:16] sanctification
[1:31:18] and honor.
[1:31:20] that you see the spirit of God living in
[1:31:22] us will empower us. But Paul is
[1:31:25] directing these words to the saints of
[1:31:28] God that you oh my every one of you
[1:31:32] should know how to possess
[1:31:35] his vessel. Notice the new birth in your
[1:31:38] soul does not give the the new birth to
[1:31:40] the body but from the soul the control
[1:31:43] tower it wants you to possess this body
[1:31:47] in sanctification. Do you understand
[1:31:49] this is what we're doing to this church
[1:31:51] building? Would any of you stand outside
[1:31:54] and watch people come in and take a
[1:31:55] sledgehammer and start knocking holes in
[1:31:57] the wall or come in here and sit down
[1:31:59] and start smoking marijuana or cussing
[1:32:02] or lying or committing adultery or
[1:32:03] drinking? I imagine some of our sisters
[1:32:06] that are as meek and gentle as they
[1:32:08] could be, they'd pick up a song or pick
[1:32:10] up a chair and go to knocking heads
[1:32:12] around. You ain't smoking in our church.
[1:32:14] That's the house of God. Why? Well, this
[1:32:17] it belongs to us and his presence. This
[1:32:20] is where we meet at. So, we want to
[1:32:22] possess this place in sanctification, do
[1:32:26] we not? Well, if we want to do this
[1:32:29] building this way, what about this
[1:32:31] building right here? We want to possess
[1:32:34] our house in purity and sanctification.
[1:32:38] This is our part of the cuba. Amen.
[1:32:41] That's right. Oh my. 1 Thessalonians
[1:32:45] 4:5,
[1:32:46] not in the lust of concupisence,
[1:32:49] even as the Gentiles
[1:32:52] which know not God. Let let me hurry.
[1:32:56] Now, this is something that would happen
[1:32:58] right before it would happen multiple
[1:33:01] times, but this is one of the last
[1:33:03] things that would take place
[1:33:06] before the bride would put on the
[1:33:08] wedding garment.
[1:33:11] She was purified
[1:33:14] by washing.
[1:33:17] Purified
[1:33:19] by washing. So she's waiting in the
[1:33:21] house waiting for the shout to come.
[1:33:26] Then a messenger comes, a friend of the
[1:33:28] bridegroom, and makes it known, brings
[1:33:31] the gown, the wedding dress to the
[1:33:33] bride.
[1:33:35] she at least has an idea that she's
[1:33:38] living in the day of the coming of her
[1:33:42] Lord.
[1:33:43] Now, notice Jesus said that that you'll
[1:33:46] not know the hour nor the day. We're
[1:33:49] talking about a 24-hour cycle. But
[1:33:51] remember, the word day is also used as
[1:33:54] an accumulation of days. So, it's a a
[1:33:57] span of time. We don't know what day the
[1:34:00] rapture is. We don't know will it be
[1:34:02] 10:00, 11:00? We don't know. Exactly.
[1:34:05] But we have an idea that we are living
[1:34:07] in that day. Amen. That's right. Which
[1:34:10] can span several days, several months,
[1:34:12] several weeks, and even several years.
[1:34:15] Why? God has sent his friend with the
[1:34:18] bride's clothes.
[1:34:22] Yes, sir. Now, as the bride would hear
[1:34:25] this, then the bride would enter into
[1:34:30] the mikvah.
[1:34:33] Mikva.
[1:34:37] They didn't have showers.
[1:34:39] They didn't have fiberglass tubs the way
[1:34:41] we do, but they would dig a hole in the
[1:34:44] ground and use masonary and have a spot
[1:34:48] where they could pour water into it. And
[1:34:51] they would go down into the mikvah.
[1:34:55] Remember, they had no air conditioner,
[1:34:58] so it's very hot, sweaty.
[1:35:01] You would not want your bridegroom
[1:35:05] to come into you when you were filthy
[1:35:08] and dirty and sweaty.
[1:35:12] Amen.
[1:35:14] So, she would step down in the mikvah.
[1:35:18] Notice in 1 Corinthians 6:10. Now this
[1:35:21] happens to us initially of course also
[1:35:25] but we have one soul changing baths
[1:35:31] but we have many flesh baings
[1:35:34] thereafter.
[1:35:36] Amen.
[1:35:38] Remember what Jesus said whenever he
[1:35:40] talked about washing their feet and
[1:35:42] Peter said you'll never wash my feet. He
[1:35:44] said if I don't wash you you have no
[1:35:46] part with me. So Jesus was likening the
[1:35:50] new births and disciplehip to the way
[1:35:53] they would have cleaned up their bodies.
[1:35:56] So they didn't have personal bathrooms.
[1:35:57] Okay? They had bath houses.
[1:36:01] So they would go to, you know, the
[1:36:04] Romans were very famous for the bathous.
[1:36:06] I've seen many of them in architecture
[1:36:08] and stuff in different parts of the
[1:36:09] world where I've been.
[1:36:11] So they would go to the public bath
[1:36:14] house and they would take a bath. Then
[1:36:18] they would get their shoes of course and
[1:36:21] everything and they would get dressed
[1:36:22] and go back to their house. But they
[1:36:25] didn't have concrete driveways. They did
[1:36:28] not have asphalt roads.
[1:36:31] So it was dust. So on their way after
[1:36:35] they got born again. I I mean I mean I
[1:36:38] mean washed.
[1:36:41] They're going back on their daily
[1:36:42] activities and they look down on their
[1:36:45] feet and there's dust between their
[1:36:48] toes.
[1:36:49] And then they could pull the robes up
[1:36:51] and see there's dust on the lower part
[1:36:53] of their legs.
[1:36:55] So what would they do then? They would
[1:36:57] have a little pan of water when they
[1:37:00] would come to the very entrance of their
[1:37:03] house that would set over to the side.
[1:37:05] They would come in, kick their sandals
[1:37:07] off, and they would wash their feet
[1:37:10] before they would go into the house so
[1:37:13] they wouldn't track that worldly dust.
[1:37:18] That's right. Hallelujah.
[1:37:21] Notice Paul in 1 Corinthians 6:10 that
[1:37:24] he's talking about those that won't be
[1:37:26] partakers of the kingdom of God. Nor
[1:37:28] thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards,
[1:37:31] nor revilers, nor extortioners
[1:37:34] shall inherit the kingdom of God.
[1:37:39] And such were some of you.
[1:37:42] That's right.
[1:37:45] But now notice he's showing them they
[1:37:47] were that, but they're not now.
[1:37:51] Why? They've had a mikvah.
[1:37:54] He says, "And such were some of you, but
[1:37:58] ye are washed.
[1:38:02] But ye are sanctified." Look at the
[1:38:05] meaning of this word. Hallow, be holy,
[1:38:09] to separate from profane things, and
[1:38:12] dedicate to God, to consecrate, to
[1:38:16] purify. Amen. Yes, sir. But ye are
[1:38:21] justified in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:38:24] and by the spirit of our God. So the
[1:38:27] bride must have a mikvah
[1:38:31] of the soul.
[1:38:34] And then she'll go to church on
[1:38:35] Wednesday and get another one. And
[1:38:37] she'll go to church on Sunday and get
[1:38:39] another. Who knows? She might have a bad
[1:38:41] day on Monday and she might have, you
[1:38:43] know, she might have just said some
[1:38:44] things she shouldn't have said. I didn't
[1:38:45] realize how many people in our church
[1:38:47] here that was temper till I preached
[1:38:50] that on Sunday. Lord have mercy. My
[1:38:52] phone like to have blowed up. I could
[1:38:55] not believe all the different people,
[1:38:58] not only here at the local assembly, but
[1:39:00] people all over everywhere. I thought,
[1:39:01] "Oh, Jesus, you're right on time. Praise
[1:39:05] the Lord." So, what do we need every now
[1:39:07] and then? We need another mitvah. Aren't
[1:39:11] you glad that we can come to the house
[1:39:13] of God and be washed by the water of the
[1:39:16] word? Don't you understand? But brother
[1:39:18] D, it makes me feel so bad. Don't you
[1:39:21] understand? You wouldn't let me bathe
[1:39:23] you if you fell clean from top of your
[1:39:25] head to the bottom of your feet. But the
[1:39:27] word helps you to realize your faults
[1:39:30] and then you'll stand still long enough
[1:39:32] for me to scrub the dirt off of you. Oh,
[1:39:35] hallelujah. But if you think you're like
[1:39:38] Angel White and you're standing there
[1:39:40] glistening in the sun, then you think
[1:39:43] you don't need no washing. But the word
[1:39:45] will say you're wrong there and you're
[1:39:46] wrong there and you're wrong there. And
[1:39:48] you feel like you got a big spot there
[1:39:50] and another one here and another one
[1:39:51] there and another one there. And you'll
[1:39:53] stand still while I take that old scrub
[1:39:55] pad and scrub and scrub a dub.
[1:39:59] And you say, "Wash me, Jesus. Wash me,
[1:40:02] Jesus."
[1:40:04] Amen.
[1:40:06] Can't you understand why preachers
[1:40:07] sometimes must preach against things
[1:40:13] that the people of God get attached to
[1:40:15] in their lives?
[1:40:17] Call me foolish if you wish to.
[1:40:21] To me, one of the final things that'll
[1:40:23] happen before the bride gets ready to
[1:40:26] leave this world
[1:40:28] is the final washing.
[1:40:33] the final washing all over the earth.
[1:40:37] The minister will be preaching, washing,
[1:40:39] lay aside, purge yourself, cleanse
[1:40:42] yourself from that person, this person,
[1:40:44] that thing, this thing. If it's
[1:40:46] hindering you, you imagine almighty God
[1:40:48] will do it over the scope of the world
[1:40:51] and probably 24 hours or less. Men of
[1:40:54] God will be anointed like everything
[1:40:55] that people think, what in the world is
[1:40:57] going on. Lord have mercy. What a hard
[1:40:58] sermon. They don't realize they're
[1:41:00] getting their last bath.
[1:41:05] They're getting their last bath washed
[1:41:07] away from selfishness and idolatry and
[1:41:09] this and that. And don't you see, bride?
[1:41:12] We must not be sweaty. We must not be
[1:41:15] dirty with the things of life. So God
[1:41:18] sends the water, the washing of the word
[1:41:21] and it just washes the bride all over
[1:41:23] the world. The ministry will be washing
[1:41:26] the bride. Maybe it'll be the last
[1:41:27] Sunday before the rapture. And on Monday
[1:41:30] morning, what a great day to have the
[1:41:31] rapture Monday, right?
[1:41:36] Oh my. The bride gathers together on
[1:41:38] Sunday and the preachers are landing
[1:41:40] out. Boy, they leave feeling so bad. I
[1:41:42] can't believe I had to preach hard. Oh
[1:41:43] my goodness, Lord. I ain't never
[1:41:44] preaching again. And Jesus said, "Amen.
[1:41:48] Amen. You ain't preaching again, bud.
[1:41:50] You just produce the last bath they'll
[1:41:51] ever need. Hallelujah. You obeyed me.
[1:41:55] They laid this aside. Some of them had
[1:41:57] bitterness. Some of them had this and
[1:41:58] that and the other. They was able to lay
[1:42:00] it aside. Now they have took their last
[1:42:03] mikvah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:42:07] Then in the morning between 7 and 9. I'm
[1:42:11] not sure if it's New Zealand time,
[1:42:13] Australian time, or Tennessee time. I
[1:42:16] don't care.
[1:42:18] I ain't worried about watching my watch.
[1:42:20] I'm worried about watching my soul.
[1:42:23] Amen. Let me close.
[1:42:27] So when they felt they were getting
[1:42:29] close, the bride would go through the
[1:42:32] ritual, and I'm reading this to you from
[1:42:33] history, of immersion
[1:42:36] called a mikvah.
[1:42:39] It signified the passing
[1:42:43] of the old
[1:42:45] and the coming forth
[1:42:48] of the new.
[1:42:50] Now, not only is there mitvas in the
[1:42:53] washing of the water of the word, but
[1:42:56] there's also a mikvah and a refilling
[1:43:00] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:43:04] The dynamics of this church will be a
[1:43:06] refilling of the Holy Ghost. The prophet
[1:43:09] says while she's worked in part, while
[1:43:11] the headstones been been descending,
[1:43:19] she'll be washed
[1:43:21] and the dynamics
[1:43:24] will fill her so full
[1:43:27] her body will no longer be able to stay
[1:43:29] mortal.
[1:43:32] It was the last washing
[1:43:34] she'll ever need.
[1:43:38] And the next morning
[1:43:40] she'll be gone. Thank you Lord.
[1:43:45] Happy day.
[1:43:48] Happy day. Oh happy day.
[1:43:54] Oh hallelujah.
[1:43:56] What is it? A signifying of the old
[1:43:59] passing away.
[1:44:02] The old order of time.
[1:44:05] my last washing of the spiritual mikvah.
[1:44:12] My provision from the bridegroom of the
[1:44:14] revealed word of this hour
[1:44:17] will bring me to my final height. And
[1:44:21] I'll hear my last sermon one day and
[1:44:23] preach my last one one day
[1:44:26] and it will signify a changing of my
[1:44:30] clothes.
[1:44:33] by close
[1:44:35] of mortality.
[1:44:38] Maybe you're getting tired of this
[1:44:40] message. It's more dear to me now than
[1:44:42] it's ever been.
[1:44:45] Listen.
[1:44:49] You see, when we accept the Lord Jesus
[1:44:50] as our savior, we start
[1:44:54] on quite a journey.
[1:44:56] We're learning more about him. We're
[1:44:58] surrendering this, giving up that,
[1:45:00] becoming more and more and more of what
[1:45:01] he wants. and we think we love him so
[1:45:04] much we could never love him more.
[1:45:07] But of course, we all found out that
[1:45:09] wasn't right.
[1:45:11] He started taking the idols out of our
[1:45:13] lives, cleansing us, separating us. I'm
[1:45:18] I'm so glad that I can still be washed.
[1:45:21] Aren't you? You realize a lot of people
[1:45:23] in the message have arrived to where
[1:45:25] they feel like they don't need anything
[1:45:26] anymore. They've not really arrived in
[1:45:28] the message. They're a Leodysian. Amen.
[1:45:30] That's the spirit of Leodosia. We are
[1:45:34] rich and increased with goods and we
[1:45:35] have need of nothing. So you ain't
[1:45:36] telling me nothing. You can't tell me
[1:45:38] nothing. Well, I've still got a
[1:45:40] teachable spirit myself. My Holy Ghost
[1:45:42] can still be taught
[1:45:44] and I want to be washed.
[1:45:47] I come here tonight, brother Jackie, to
[1:45:49] be washed if I've got something I need
[1:45:50] to get rid of or anybody else here with
[1:45:52] me.
[1:45:54] Amen. So all the gods and the idols, we
[1:45:58] get them out of our life and stay
[1:46:01] faithful unto him until
[1:46:05] the final ceremony.
[1:46:09] Now the groom and the father of the
[1:46:12] groom
[1:46:14] come to this agreement
[1:46:17] for the moar.
[1:46:19] M O H A R
[1:46:23] Mohar,
[1:46:26] the bride price.
[1:46:30] But we ain't going that way tonight.
[1:46:33] I just wanted to give you just enough to
[1:46:35] make you, oh man.
[1:46:39] But I'll tell you right now,
[1:46:42] the price was so high,
[1:46:45] which increases
[1:46:47] your value.
[1:46:52] to give a city of gold for you,
[1:46:56] streets of gold, walls of jasper. That'd
[1:46:58] be a great price.
[1:47:00] But to give himself for you, he who knew
[1:47:04] no sin became sin that we might become
[1:47:09] the righteousness of God
[1:47:11] in him.
[1:47:15] Hallelujah.
[1:47:17] Don't you love him with all your heart?
[1:47:20] Aren't you glad we can still go to
[1:47:22] church and get a bath?
[1:47:26] How many knows you need it from time to
[1:47:28] time?
[1:47:30] Yeah, we sure do.
[1:47:33] Let's just bow our heads if you would.
[1:47:38] Oh blessed Lord,
[1:47:42] once again we have been so honored
[1:47:45] to pull our feet up under your table.
[1:47:51] We feel like that we have
[1:47:54] been able to eat with royalty tonight.
[1:47:59] We've been given food
[1:48:01] that has been reserved for this last
[1:48:04] day.
[1:48:06] part Luther, part Paul, part Peter, part
[1:48:09] James, part John, part Wesley, part
[1:48:11] Pentecost.
[1:48:13] And it brought to a culmination
[1:48:17] that your prophet said, "All seven seals
[1:48:19] are open and the word is ready for those
[1:48:23] who can receive it." And you said that
[1:48:25] you're serving to us a seven course
[1:48:30] meal.
[1:48:32] Thank God. We love it, Lord.
[1:48:36] We know sometimes there's some bitter
[1:48:38] things in it. There's some tough things
[1:48:40] in it. But Lord, help us to eat it. I
[1:48:43] pray that we at this church never get to
[1:48:45] a spot to where we feel so
[1:48:47] self-righteous
[1:48:49] that we feel like we cannot move up
[1:48:52] closer.
[1:48:55] Lord, I gave you my heart when I was
[1:48:57] just a boy and I gave you my teens cuz I
[1:49:00] got saved when I was 12. So, I gave all
[1:49:02] my teens to you. All my 20s,
[1:49:07] all my 30s, all my 40s,
[1:49:11] all my 50s.
[1:49:13] If I live a couple more years, all my
[1:49:16] 60s.
[1:49:17] And if I'm in the 70s, I want to give
[1:49:19] you all that, too.
[1:49:22] But I hope I never get to a spot,
[1:49:25] and I've met people all around the world
[1:49:27] in the message who've got to that spot
[1:49:29] to where they feel like they really
[1:49:31] can't be helped
[1:49:34] cuz they think they know so much about
[1:49:37] you. May we never get to that spot,
[1:49:40] Lord.
[1:49:43] I pray, Father, may we always have a
[1:49:45] teachable spirit.
[1:49:47] May we have a washable attitude, Lord.
[1:49:51] If you see anything in me tonight that
[1:49:53] displeases you, Lord, wash me.
[1:49:57] Oh Jesus, may you move on every heart,
[1:50:00] every man, woman, boy, and girl, visible
[1:50:03] audience and invisible as well.
[1:50:07] Lord Jesus, no doubt there be many
[1:50:09] washings.
[1:50:11] And between now and the last one, while
[1:50:14] we are waiting for our bridegroom
[1:50:17] and father, we're opened here tonight.
[1:50:19] As your prophet said, this is why we go
[1:50:21] to church is to find our faults.
[1:50:26] And people who get angry and get all
[1:50:28] upset because the preacher preaches on
[1:50:30] smoking or drinking or whatever it is
[1:50:32] they're doing, they don't realize God's
[1:50:35] doing that so they can be loosed from
[1:50:37] that and be washed from it. That's the
[1:50:41] only way we can know that we're wrong.
[1:50:43] And then once we see it, then what do we
[1:50:46] do? We ask you to wash us and cleanse
[1:50:50] us. Oh, I've taken many mikvas
[1:50:54] since I've been a Christian. And if I
[1:50:57] live very much longer, no doubt I'll
[1:50:59] have to take another and another and
[1:51:01] another.
[1:51:03] But one day, I'll take my last one. I'll
[1:51:06] hear my last sermon.
[1:51:08] I'll correct the last issue in my life.
[1:51:13] Whatever it'll be, it'll be corrected.
[1:51:17] And all over the world, not only won't I
[1:51:19] be doing it, but people all over the
[1:51:21] world will be arriving. And it'll be
[1:51:25] such a supernatural element, the devil
[1:51:28] won't recognize what's going on. It'll
[1:51:31] catch him by surprise because all of
[1:51:33] that is part of the seventh seal.
[1:51:37] Because the seventh seal is the coming
[1:51:39] of the Lord. So what greater thing could
[1:51:43] be a part of that manifestation of a
[1:51:45] corporal coming is for you to pre-advent
[1:51:49] your body by sending your mind, your
[1:51:52] thoughts, and anointing your men.
[1:51:56] Hallelujah.
[1:51:58] And they're preaching things that they
[1:51:59] don't even understand why. And they wish
[1:52:01] they didn't have to.
[1:52:03] But the bride around the world will be
[1:52:05] washed for her last time.
[1:52:10] Oh Jesus,
[1:52:12] we love you tonight. Father,
[1:52:15] we worship you, Lord.
[1:52:18] We bless your name, Lord Jesus.
[1:52:22] How many with your heads bowed? Would
[1:52:25] you just raise your hand? Say, "Lord,
[1:52:28] wash me tonight." Would you
[1:52:31] just just wash me again? any attitude
[1:52:34] you see about me, Lord, in any anything
[1:52:37] I've got against anybody or anything I'm
[1:52:40] doing in my life, Lord, just show me.
[1:52:43] Show me, Lord. Wash me. Cleanse me.
[1:52:47] Praise God.
[1:52:50] We worship you tonight, Lord Jesus.
[1:52:54] Would you mind
[1:52:56] laying your hand over on the person
[1:52:57] standing by? Let's just offer a word of
[1:52:59] prayer.
[1:53:01] Brother Brad Gilbert text me before
[1:53:03] church and asked if we'd remember him
[1:53:06] tonight in prayer. Also, let's just pray
[1:53:09] for him as well. Now, keep in mind, you
[1:53:12] have no idea what that person standing
[1:53:14] beside you has got on their heart. Maybe
[1:53:17] they think they can't make it another
[1:53:19] day. Maybe they've really messed up bad
[1:53:22] this week and they feel like God's done
[1:53:25] with them.
[1:53:28] But I want you to pray for him with all
[1:53:29] of your heart now.
[1:53:32] Lord Jesus,
[1:53:35] as we have our hands one upon the other
[1:53:37] tonight, Lord,
[1:53:40] oh Lord God, I pray that you'd move in
[1:53:43] our assembly this night, Lord God,
[1:53:46] if you find any of us with any speck of
[1:53:50] unbelief
[1:53:51] towards your word, toward a promise of
[1:53:53] this age, help us, Lord.
[1:53:57] Lord, every minister, Father, our
[1:53:59] assembly, help us, dear God, anoint us
[1:54:02] to speak the words of life.
[1:54:06] Oh Jesus, we're out here on the world
[1:54:08] and many of these people have to deal
[1:54:10] with people of the world. And Carol was
[1:54:12] talking about the other night to said,
[1:54:13] you know, we're so blessed in one way
[1:54:15] cuz we don't have to deal with all the
[1:54:17] stuff that our sheep do. They have to
[1:54:20] work with people that cuss and lie and
[1:54:21] men that want to be women. Women that
[1:54:23] want to be men office filth and
[1:54:25] debauchery ever was in the world. We
[1:54:28] don't have to deal with all that.
[1:54:30] But Lord God, you know, and sometimes
[1:54:32] your children probably come in at the
[1:54:34] end of the day and they feel so filthy
[1:54:36] by the words they've heard said on their
[1:54:38] job, by the music that they've heard. We
[1:54:42] can't even go to Walmart. We can't even
[1:54:44] go to Lowe's or some place like that
[1:54:46] without rock and roll and all that mess
[1:54:48] of the devil blaring out. Lord,
[1:54:51] Lord, it's like the bread, the bride
[1:54:53] being dressed in this beautiful white
[1:54:55] garment and there's smoke and pitch and
[1:54:58] filth all around us everywhere and
[1:55:01] things are sticking with its arms out
[1:55:03] just to touch us and just to rub their
[1:55:05] filth all over us. Oh Lord God, wash us
[1:55:10] tonight. Jesus,
[1:55:12] help us, Father.
[1:55:14] Oh, we worship you tonight, Lord.
[1:55:18] May we have a miga right here before we
[1:55:21] leave this place tonight, Lord God.
[1:55:24] Oh Jesus, wash our minds. Wash our minds
[1:55:28] of the filth,
[1:55:30] Lord God. Wash our thoughts,
[1:55:33] Lord. Even Christians can have bad
[1:55:35] dreams and filthy dreams. and torments
[1:55:38] them once they wake up and they feel
[1:55:40] like they've done something horribly
[1:55:42] wrong.
[1:55:43] It's because Satan still has access with
[1:55:45] that darkness to our subconscious.
[1:55:48] Wash us tonight, Jesus. If we've got
[1:55:51] hurt feelings and hard feelings toward a
[1:55:53] brother or sister, wash us, Lord.
[1:55:57] I love the way the prophet said it. If
[1:55:58] we've got any darkness
[1:56:01] hanging on our lives, may we be washed,
[1:56:05] Lord.
[1:56:06] May we be loosed from it tonight,
[1:56:08] Father.
[1:56:10] May the mikvah of the spirit of God wash
[1:56:14] us and we will be clean.
[1:56:17] Search us tonight, oh God, and know our
[1:56:21] hearts. Search our spirits.
[1:56:24] Search every aspect of our lives, our
[1:56:26] homes.
[1:56:28] Grant it, Lord Jesus.
[1:56:31] We worship you tonight, Father, with all
[1:56:34] of our hearts.
[1:56:36] Hallelujah.
[1:56:38] Hallelujah.
[1:56:39] We praise you, Lord. And fathers, we've
[1:56:42] seen it over and over again when we
[1:56:44] baptize people in water. It's amazing. I
[1:56:48] love to look at their face when I bring
[1:56:49] them up out of the water. A smile,
[1:56:52] laughing, crying, whatever it is. It
[1:56:55] does something to them. It's hard to
[1:56:58] explain it. I've baptized hundreds of
[1:57:00] them over the world. And when they come
[1:57:02] up out of the water, it's amazing.
[1:57:04] Whether it's an old muddy river or a
[1:57:06] clear water out of a baptistry, but it's
[1:57:09] something about that countenance.
[1:57:12] Lord Jesus, may it be that way for us
[1:57:14] tonight, a mitvah that we can be washed
[1:57:17] of anything that displeases you, Lord.
[1:57:21] Not only that, but oh God, how we need a
[1:57:24] fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost. We can
[1:57:28] become so weary in this life, Lord, with
[1:57:31] all the things that are around us, the
[1:57:33] burdens, the troubles. We've got loved
[1:57:35] ones, Lord, that aren't ready.
[1:57:38] Lord, if the rapture were to come in the
[1:57:40] morning, we've got loved ones without
[1:57:41] the Holy Ghost. It weighs on us. Jesus,
[1:57:46] have mercy. Lord, we pray. Have mercy on
[1:57:49] our family members. God, we've got
[1:57:53] family, friends that are backslid, Lord,
[1:57:55] that are away from you, out of
[1:57:56] fellowship. Have mercy.
[1:57:59] Have mercy, God.
[1:58:02] Oh Jesus, we love you. We worship you
[1:58:05] tonight, oh father. We magnify your holy
[1:58:09] name.
[1:58:11] Can we just raise our hands now in the
[1:58:12] presence of the king?
[1:58:16] Praise God. Praise God.
[1:58:19] This is why the prophet would say things
[1:58:21] like this after he would preach a hard
[1:58:23] sermon. And he said, 'Don't you just
[1:58:25] feel all clean and all scoured out was
[1:58:28] the word that he used. Scoured out.
[1:58:32] Well, you know that was you. They had a
[1:58:34] what they called a scouring pad and it
[1:58:36] was kind of bristled like steel wool and
[1:58:39] you'd kind of have to take some rub rub
[1:58:42] it and rub it in order to get that out.
[1:58:44] But it cleaned all the spots and the
[1:58:46] rust and whatever more. May the spirit
[1:58:49] of God come by this way tonight and just
[1:58:53] scour our attitudes and scour our
[1:58:55] spirit.
[1:58:57] Praise God. Praise God. That we won't
[1:59:00] just be sanctified on the outside, but
[1:59:03] we'll be sanctified in our spirits.
[1:59:05] We'll know how to control our tongue and
[1:59:07] control our temper. And the church said,
[1:59:11] "Control everything about us." and we
[1:59:14] would know how to possess our vessel in
[1:59:18] sanctification. You see, brothers,
[1:59:20] that's what God wants it to be. But that
[1:59:23] smartphone that you've got, which come
[1:59:24] off the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:59:26] evil, that your wife don't have to be
[1:59:28] standing over your shoulder to keep you
[1:59:31] from going to websites you couldn't go
[1:59:33] to. Cuz you can do the same thing by
[1:59:35] yourself if I was standing there by you
[1:59:39] or the angel of the Lord was standing
[1:59:40] there by you because you possess your
[1:59:43] vessel yourself. Your wife don't possess
[1:59:46] it. Your pastor don't possess it. But
[1:59:49] you've learned how to possess your own
[1:59:51] vessel in sanctification. So you tell
[1:59:54] your flesh, you don't go there. You
[1:59:57] don't do this. You don't do that. I
[2:00:00] possess you. You obey me flesh. I don't
[2:00:04] obey you.
[2:00:07] Praise be to God. Oh, we worship you,
[2:00:11] Lord Jesus.
[2:00:13] Sing something for us, Justin. Can we
[2:00:16] just worship him a little? Look at this
[2:00:17] scripture again. 1 Corinthians 6:11. and
[2:00:20] such were some of you. But ye are
[2:00:23] washed, but ye are sanctified,
[2:00:27] but ye are justified in the name of the
[2:00:30] Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God.
[2:00:37] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:00:40] Let's just worship him just a little
[2:00:42] before we go. If you got you got to go,
[2:00:43] that's fine. We understand you. You got
[2:00:45] jobs and this and that and the other.
[2:00:47] But for those of you that can can stay
[2:00:49] for just a few minutes, let's just turn
[2:00:52] now. I believe he's come by and give us
[2:00:54] a good bath. We're not all sweaty and
[2:00:57] sticky and and all that. What What do
[2:01:00] you say we we feel washed and we feel
[2:01:02] clean? Let's just reach and grab a hold
[2:01:05] of him and pull him over real close to
[2:01:07] us.
[2:01:09] I've been over here today working
[2:01:11] outside. So, I planted some new grass
[2:01:14] over there and I planted three new
[2:01:16] hydrangeas over here and another grass
[2:01:19] right outside my door and two more over
[2:01:22] there. And I've been killing weeds and
[2:01:25] time I got done. Woo! You talking about
[2:01:28] ripe? Woo! I was ripe. 80some degrees
[2:01:32] and my metabolism is wide open and I
[2:01:36] sweat like a horse on thoroughb bread
[2:01:38] day. I'll tell you what, my wife would
[2:01:40] not have wanted me to come home and
[2:01:43] said, "Come here, baby. Lay one on me."
[2:01:46] I know what she'd have said. Go take a
[2:01:48] shower.
[2:01:52] Well, Jesus says, "Give us a bath."
[2:01:56] Now, we can say, "Lord Jesus,
[2:02:00] I'm washed.
[2:02:03] Come into my arms.
[2:02:06] Let me kiss the son lest he be angry.
[2:02:11] Let me tell you how much I love you.
[2:02:14] Remember Jesus, the prophet said that
[2:02:17] Jesus whispers
[2:02:19] secrets to the bride.
[2:02:29] Did anybody know what I said?
[2:02:33] You see, that's the thing about
[2:02:34] whispering.
[2:02:35] You've got to be really close.
[2:02:40] So Jesus wants to get us close. He just
[2:02:43] don't want our attitude stinking.
[2:02:45] He don't want things of the world on us
[2:02:47] causing us to smell up.
[2:02:50] And I I just don't understand at the end
[2:02:51] of the service and everybody's all clean
[2:02:53] and you just got a good bath and people
[2:02:55] want to leave as soon as I say amen.
[2:02:58] You just got cleaned up or he can just
[2:03:00] talk to you. Now
[2:03:02] let's worship him, shall we?
[2:03:06] Sing just
[2:03:09] my desire
[2:03:13] to live for Jesus.
[2:03:18] Yes, Lord.
[2:03:20] It's my It's my desire.
[2:03:25] Hallelujah.
[2:03:27] to be like him. Like him.
[2:03:34] Though often
[2:03:36] I
[2:03:37] will have failed
[2:03:41] and bring
[2:03:43] him shame.

[2:03:54] to live for him. Everybody now with all
[2:04:00] your heart.

[2:04:15] And you would know
[2:04:19] the reason why I love him. So
