[39:12] certainly appreciate all the effort that
[39:14] they've put forth in doing all this and
[39:16] all the work and also we finally get it
[39:19] I'm just hoping that we get it three
[39:21] days before the Rapture released so we
[39:23] can say well we had three good services
[39:26] let's turn tonight if you would to the
[39:28] book of Zechariah Chapter 6 verse 9. I
[39:31] know we've been having a lot of people
[39:34] asking about our
[39:36] dedication services and what dates that
[39:38] we're going to do it and I threw out
[39:41] middle of May and I had threw back at me
[39:44] this is going to be gone nothing's going
[39:46] to be gone nothing's going to be gone so
[39:48] I'm gonna throw some more out at you
[39:50] tonight
[39:51] um
[39:52] I've been wanting to have a special
[39:53] meeting
[39:54] Ever every year anyway so I'm thinking
[39:58] that we will have it the last the last
[40:02] day of June and first and second day of
[40:06] July
[40:07] for dedications that'd be Friday
[40:09] Saturday and Sunday that should give
[40:12] everybody plenty enough time to make
[40:14] plans we've got people from Canada
[40:16] people from Europe people from France
[40:18] people from all over the United States
[40:21] that's wanting to come if it works out
[40:23] where they can so maybe that'll give
[40:25] everybody enough time to where they can
[40:27] make plans to come and of course all the
[40:29] local folks are cordially invited
[40:32] y'all please come too
[40:35] amen
[40:36] Zechariah Chapter 6 verse 9.
[40:41] and the word of the Lord came unto me
[40:43] saying
[40:44] take of them of the Captivity
[40:47] even of held AI of tobaja
[40:51] and Jedi which are come from Babylon
[40:55] and Come Thou the same day and go into
[40:58] the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah
[41:03] then take silver and gold
[41:06] and make crowns
[41:08] and set upon the head of Joshua
[41:13] now listen what he's going to do said on
[41:15] the head of Joshua the son of Jose deck
[41:19] the high priest
[41:21] and speak unto him saying
[41:24] thus speaketh the Lord of hosts
[41:28] saying
[41:29] behold the man whose name is the branch
[41:33] he shall grow up out of his place
[41:36] and he shall build the Temple of the
[41:38] Lord
[41:39] now what A peculiar
[41:42] setting that this is so the rebuilding
[41:45] the temple they've got just a remnant of
[41:48] people from Babylon some from Persia
[41:50] some from different parts and they're
[41:52] Gathering Together
[41:54] and God tells this Prophet to go in and
[41:57] take silver and gold and to make a crown
[42:01] and sat on the head of Joshua that this
[42:04] of course not the Joshua that was in
[42:05] Moses day and then when he does that he
[42:09] gives this Prophecy of the Lord Jesus
[42:13] and you think why in the world would God
[42:15] have Blended them to together
[42:19] now notice what he says speak unto him
[42:24] saying thus speak of the Lord of hosts
[42:26] saying behold the man whose name is the
[42:29] branch
[42:30] so I wonder what some of these modern
[42:32] folks that want to criticize prophets
[42:34] over saying this and that and the other
[42:36] and they don't understand them I wonder
[42:38] what they'd said about Zachariah
[42:41] whenever Zechariah says this actually to
[42:45] Joshua
[42:46] and he says behold the man whose name is
[42:50] the branch and that probably the critics
[42:52] of that David said well is that him
[42:54] or is that Jedediah or who's even
[42:57] talking about I believe that man it's a
[42:59] false prophet I don't think what he said
[43:01] come to pass
[43:03] but you see we live on this side of the
[43:06] Fulfillment of him saying it to us it
[43:10] makes better sense does it not but can
[43:13] you imagine living in that day and
[43:15] you're a message follower as we would
[43:17] say and you believe God sent this
[43:20] prophet and you hear this prophecy
[43:22] you're probably like the rest of them
[43:24] you didn't understand it either so you
[43:26] think what did the man mean was he
[43:29] calling Joshua the branch was he calling
[43:32] Jedediah what was the man saying but
[43:34] then you go on and you say he couldn't
[43:36] have been talking about Joshua but the
[43:38] Lord tells him speak unto him
[43:45] thus speaketh the Lord of hosts
[43:48] behold the man whose name is the branch
[43:51] he shall grow out of his place
[43:55] he shall build the Temple of the Lord
[43:59] but the thing of it is Joshua
[44:01] is a high priest zerubbabel
[44:05] is the one building this Temple
[44:08] so the critics would have said that man
[44:10] don't even know what he's talking about
[44:12] this man's not even building the Temple
[44:14] well he wasn't talking about that man
[44:16] but God veiled it in such a way and that
[44:21] Gem of Prophecy laid there for hundreds
[44:24] of years I'd say the devil didn't even
[44:26] know who it was
[44:29] notice verse 13. even he
[44:33] shall build the Temple of the Lord
[44:37] and he
[44:39] shall bear the glory
[44:42] and he shall set and Rule
[44:45] upon his throne
[44:48] and he shall be a priest
[44:51] upon his throne which was never allowed
[44:54] and the whole time of the Kingdom of
[44:57] Israel only one man tried to do that and
[45:00] we remember he was stricken with Leprosy
[45:02] but God is going to merge both offices
[45:05] King and priest into one and they
[45:08] probably thought this guy's a false
[45:10] prophet while this man never was a king
[45:12] he never was a mixture of that I hope we
[45:15] don't do the same thing in our day
[45:18] he shall be a priest upon his throne and
[45:21] the counsel of Peace shall be between
[45:25] them boasts so the office of king and
[45:30] the office of priests will merge
[45:33] together and whoever this man is and
[45:36] there will be reconciliation and peace
[45:39] in both of these offices
[45:41] I mean a lot to be remembered tonight as
[45:43] we pray
[45:45] I'd like to remember Carol tonight she's
[45:47] not feeling well she's at home sick also
[45:49] my daughter listed sick and Lance had
[45:52] some dental work extensive dental work
[45:54] done today so he's not feeling very well
[45:55] also brother Dan Dyer is Maiden made in
[45:59] prayer who else would you hand up before
[46:02] the Lord God bless you can we just take
[46:05] these requests before the Lord
[46:08] Heavenly Father we are so blessed and
[46:12] not to be once again in this place that
[46:14] you have given us
[46:16] we thank you for Jesus
[46:18] we thank you Lord that we not only have
[46:21] a nice place to be able to come and
[46:22] worship but what makes it so wonderful
[46:25] is that you are here
[46:27] it wouldn't make any difference how nice
[46:29] it was how pretty it was how clean it
[46:31] was how brand new it was if you don't
[46:34] show up then we sort of want to be here
[46:37] but we know as long as you are here
[46:39] that's what makes it Church
[46:41] so father we bring our needs our
[46:43] requests our desires before you you've
[46:46] told us that we could approach the
[46:48] throne of grace
[46:50] through the shed blood of the Lord Jesus
[46:52] and we believe that our prayers will be
[46:56] answered according to the will of God
[46:58] and they will be accepted through the
[47:01] blood of the Lord Jesus Christ so we
[47:03] bring the needs that I have mentioned
[47:06] also Father of the hands of the people
[47:08] that were uplifted no doubt people
[47:10] sitting at home people streaming the
[47:12] service we pray that you'll be mindful
[47:14] of them as well I ask your father that
[47:16] you would help me tonight help me to get
[47:18] out of the way Lord God hold my mouse to
[47:22] anything that would displease you may I
[47:24] be so surrendered to the holy ghost that
[47:27] you can speak through me to your
[47:29] children to minister to their needs and
[47:32] we'll give you the praise for it all in
[47:34] the name of the Lord Jesus we ask him
[47:36] and the Saints said amen amen God bless
[47:40] you you may be seated
[47:45] I've been said in Prophecy for the most
[47:47] of my life
[47:49] whenever I was a Pentecostal preacher
[47:51] the only book that I read was the Bible
[47:54] so I committed a lot of the Bible to
[47:56] memory
[47:57] so I could quote it quoted it and quoted
[48:01] it whenever I'd stand and preach what
[48:03] little bit of understanding that I had
[48:04] that's what I quoted I didn't quote
[48:07] Malachi 4 I didn't quote Charles
[48:09] Spurgeon I didn't quote Webster I quoted
[48:11] the Bible
[48:12] but as much as I loved it and as much as
[48:15] I quoted it I was blind to much of the
[48:19] truth that I was quoting and one day God
[48:23] helped me to realize that there was more
[48:25] to his word than just being able to
[48:29] quote it that's the intellectual part so
[48:32] someone who has a mind and a pretty good
[48:35] memory would be able to commit a lot of
[48:37] it to memory and be able to quote it and
[48:40] do their entire life spending it that
[48:43] way and actually never understand very
[48:46] much about it at all so we realize that
[48:49] God has chosen a way that he would make
[48:53] his way known I mean part of the keys to
[48:55] that is Amos 3 7 surely the Lord God
[48:58] will do nothing except he Reveals His
[49:01] secrets to his servants the prophets so
[49:04] we can see here now God is working in a
[49:08] twofold way in the ministry of Zechariah
[49:11] now Zechariah was one of the restoration
[49:14] prophets because they went down into
[49:16] Babylon there for 70 years and God had
[49:19] told them under the minister of Jeremiah
[49:21] that they would come back and we know
[49:23] that Nehemiah the cut Bearer he began to
[49:25] get a burden for the people of God
[49:27] remember Nehemiah was not a priest
[49:28] Nehemiah was not a prophet but he was
[49:32] going to be a governor so God needed
[49:35] these different administrations to go
[49:37] back to the land of Israel now Ezra had
[49:40] already went ahead of him several years
[49:42] and he's there as the foundation part
[49:44] Ezra being a priest so the priesthood is
[49:47] going to be essential the law givers are
[49:50] going to be essential but they also need
[49:52] a governor so the governor is going to
[49:54] be Nehemiah Nehemiah fulfills a great
[49:58] position in the work of God going on but
[50:01] here is Zechariah which is one of the
[50:04] restoration prophets also during the
[50:06] same time frame close to the time same
[50:08] time frame of Malachi and also Micah
[50:12] these brothers these men are called
[50:14] Minor Prophets of the Old Testament and
[50:17] yet because of that because her book is
[50:19] quite short but God had a lot to say
[50:23] under the ministry of some of these
[50:25] great men and Zechariah was one of those
[50:27] that was able to write of the Messianic
[50:30] prophecies of the first coming of the
[50:32] Lord Jesus and also of the Millennium
[50:35] coming so here God merges this together
[50:38] as I mentioned single last Wednesday
[50:40] night that God is actually dealing with
[50:43] currently what's going on so they're
[50:45] rebuilding the temple they're restoring
[50:48] the wall they went through that several
[50:50] years ago in the book of Nehemiah and
[50:52] now they're coming up to part of the
[50:54] crowning part so what they're doing God
[50:57] Is prophesying by words but God is also
[51:01] prophesying by symbols now prophecy
[51:04] isn't always like this thus saith the
[51:08] Lord tomorrow there will be an
[51:10] earthquake that will come down through
[51:11] Johnson City it'll be a 7.5 all of you
[51:15] that live near the Carter County Line
[51:17] stay away from that now that's prophecy
[51:20] but yet there's also Prophecy in the Old
[51:23] Testament that God would have someone
[51:25] like David that would get in the spirit
[51:27] of Prophecy and he began to prophesy in
[51:30] Psalms 21 22 brother verse 1 my God my
[51:35] God why hast Thou forsaken me all my
[51:38] bones they stare at me and he goes on
[51:40] and on and your David is actually in the
[51:44] passion of that prophecy but yet we
[51:47] don't have it written by the rest of the
[51:48] prophets acted quite that way but yet it
[51:52] was still prophecy then we have Joseph
[51:54] that never said thus saith the Lord one
[51:57] time not one time but in Joseph's life
[52:01] was written types of Prophecy so Joseph
[52:05] never said I am a type of the Lord Jesus
[52:10] so I'm going to marry a gentile wife I
[52:13] am a type of the Lord Jesus so my
[52:16] brothers will sell me I am a type of the
[52:20] Lord Jesus so my brothers will despise
[52:24] me because I'm spiritual he never one
[52:26] time said that but yet his prophecy was
[52:30] him acting out the very Life of Christ
[52:34] itself you see it was Christ hid in
[52:37] Joseph it was Christ hid in Abraham it
[52:42] was Christ's head and many of the lives
[52:44] of the prophets now what we see here is
[52:47] Christ again hid in a symbol of God
[52:51] telling this Prophet to go down and take
[52:53] silver and gold and to make a crown and
[52:56] set it on the head of Joshua but in
[52:59] reality Joshua is not going to be the
[53:03] king of Jerusalem but yet it is a symbol
[53:06] now I want you to look when you look at
[53:08] this and you realize that God is
[53:10] actually having him to make a crown for
[53:14] a prophetic Carpenter
[53:17] now before he ever tells of the prophecy
[53:20] of the role of the carpenter he makes
[53:23] the crown in type and sets it on
[53:27] Joshua's head and the people are
[53:29] probably pondering and wondering and
[53:31] thinking what in the world is he doing
[53:33] this man is not a king he's not even the
[53:37] genealogy of a king how come he's
[53:40] calling him a king but God is having him
[53:43] to act out the prophecy in another well
[53:46] I'm totally convinced about this then
[53:49] that we ourselves can be a part of a
[53:52] prophetic vision and yet we live our
[53:55] life every day we walk on the earth we
[53:58] love our wives our children we live our
[53:59] lives we do what we're supposed to do
[54:01] and we don't even realize what we are
[54:04] doing as it was with brother miscal many
[54:06] many years ago whenever he was going to
[54:08] be a part of the vision and he didn't
[54:11] even know it his wife didn't even know
[54:13] that he's just supposed to put a green
[54:15] checkered shirt inside of his bag he
[54:17] didn't even know he had one until he
[54:19] fell in the water and went to change his
[54:21] shirt and he pulled it out and whenever
[54:23] he walked out there he was with a green
[54:25] checking shirt a part of the vision but
[54:28] not studying to be apart a part of the
[54:31] vision but not trying to be apart just
[54:35] doing what they were hunting they were
[54:37] not even on a 40-day fast they were not
[54:40] even you know on a Shabbat before the
[54:42] presence of God and seeking God day and
[54:45] not they were hunting they were just
[54:47] having a good time together as brothers
[54:49] and Little did he know he was fixing to
[54:52] move into a part of the vision now many
[54:56] of us more than likely will never see
[54:59] many Visions in our life maybe some of
[55:02] you have I've seen a few in my life but
[55:04] for the most part most of us will never
[55:06] see a vision and yet many people will
[55:09] tend to look at that and say well I'm
[55:11] not spiritual because I don't have many
[55:13] dreams and I'm not spiritual because I
[55:16] don't have many Visions well you know
[55:19] just because a man does have visions
[55:21] doesn't necessarily mean that he's more
[55:23] spiritual than those who don't have him
[55:25] it just simply means God calls that man
[55:28] to be able to do that but whether or not
[55:30] you see a vision you can actually be a
[55:34] part of one now myself I would rather be
[55:37] a part of the vision of the last day
[55:39] than just be a person who can see a
[55:42] vision and not live what they see
[55:45] because believe me I run into many of
[55:47] them in Pentecost and they could see all
[55:50] kinds of Visions as a matter of fact
[55:51] I've seen a man one night called a woman
[55:53] out and done something that was just
[55:55] totally completely wrong and after he
[55:57] called her out he called me out the very
[56:00] next person and told me what I prayed
[56:03] that day the very words I told to God
[56:07] the very words I said by myself my wife
[56:10] didn't even know what I prayed no one
[56:13] knew what I prayed and yet that man told
[56:16] me word for word what I told to God I
[56:19] thought that was so spiritual I thought
[56:21] it was so phenomenal and I thought it
[56:24] was so wonderful until I found out that
[56:26] man had a girlfriend here and another
[56:28] girlfriend there and another girlfriend
[56:30] somewhere else while he's married to
[56:32] another woman
[56:33] well praise the Lord what is that false
[56:36] anointed one at the end time so don't
[56:39] get all down because you don't see
[56:41] Visions but get all up because you're
[56:44] part of one you see as the bride the
[56:47] prophet of God saw us in a vision and
[56:50] what was that Vision it was the bride
[56:53] being in line but remember there were
[56:55] some who stepped out of line but because
[56:58] they were bride they did not stay out of
[57:02] line but they come back in life so I
[57:06] would rather be one who can be a part of
[57:08] that remember it was the bride you
[57:10] notice in that Vision he didn't see them
[57:13] separated as being preachers and being
[57:16] prophets and being prophesires what he
[57:18] saw was the bride and they were typified
[57:21] by who preachers no they were not
[57:24] typified by preachers they were not
[57:26] typified by being singers they were not
[57:28] typified by being musicians they were
[57:31] all typified as being women of all all
[57:34] different cultures isn't it amazing so
[57:36] here wasn't the main preacher up front
[57:38] and then a secondary preacher and a
[57:40] third preacher and then a singer and
[57:41] then a piano player and an organ player
[57:43] it wasn't none of them even seen they
[57:45] were all typed by what women in the
[57:48] vision so even men which are preachers
[57:51] prophets whatever they are they still
[57:53] come under the symbol of being the bride
[57:55] type is that right and there they were
[57:58] identified as those who heard the voice
[58:01] of the message of the last day and they
[58:04] got their eyes on the church and when
[58:06] they did they began to Veer off and
[58:08] follow that church downward and he
[58:10] screamed back get back in line get back
[58:13] in line he comes back to himself
[58:14] standing in the room screaming to the
[58:17] bride to get back in line I believe she
[58:19] come back and lie
[58:20] I'm our self-desire to be a part of
[58:24] those in the vision anybody else here
[58:26] with me now Zechariah whenever he moves
[58:29] into this and who knows if the man even
[58:31] realized himself that God was going to
[58:34] pick him up now remember prophets see
[58:36] their Visions in the realm of the fourth
[58:39] dimension no God created seven
[58:41] dimensions in the beginning because he
[58:42] knew that we would need these seven
[58:44] dimensions in time to be able to
[58:46] communicate which are light matter time
[58:49] science where the unbeliever goes for
[58:51] the believer goes and where God Is So in
[58:53] the fourth dimension is actually a word
[58:55] diseases begin in the fourth dimension
[58:58] is where television is in the fourth
[59:01] dimension it's where prophets see their
[59:03] Vision so in that realm a prophet has
[59:05] the ability to be able to see a vision
[59:08] like having a dream with his eyes wide
[59:11] open so his son right there and look at
[59:13] you Brother David Johnson and see you as
[59:15] a five-year-old boy and then see you as
[59:17] the age you are now and then maybe look
[59:19] ahead in your future and see you as a 70
[59:22] or 75 year old man and it could go from
[59:25] one scene to another to another in a
[59:28] matter of seconds how could he do that
[59:30] it's beyond time travel it's beyond
[59:33] light travel it's Fourth Dimension
[59:35] travel so he's moving in there and he's
[59:38] able to see all of that and that's why
[59:40] that that gift is so absolutely perfect
[59:43] because when God Taps into that of a man
[59:46] who's called to be that God made it so
[59:49] that that man cannot say error well
[59:51] praise the Lord that's why God captured
[59:54] prophets to be able to reiterate his
[59:57] word I'm not made that way okay every
[59:59] sermon I've ever preached has had
[1:00:01] mistakes in it I've never preached the
[1:00:03] perfect one I've been preaching most all
[1:00:05] of my life and I've never preached one
[1:00:08] perfect sermon I dare say it would be
[1:00:10] nice to have one under your belt before
[1:00:12] you go but more than likely I never will
[1:00:14] because now I'm only a prophet is made
[1:00:18] to where whenever he speaks the saith
[1:00:20] the Lord it cannot be wrong because God
[1:00:24] so captures that into that Realm of the
[1:00:26] fourth dimension that the prophet's Soul
[1:00:28] moves aside he can't even say what he
[1:00:31] wants to say he can't even say what he's
[1:00:33] thinking and no doubt they were standing
[1:00:35] there and the human part is thinking
[1:00:37] this and that and the other but God's
[1:00:39] direct contact into the gift of that
[1:00:41] man's life he had to do it that way in
[1:00:43] order to write the Bible
[1:00:45] do you think this man would have ever
[1:00:47] spoke these things of thus saith the
[1:00:49] Lord on their own if that have thought
[1:00:51] it through with Isaiah have ever said a
[1:00:54] virgin shall conceive if he would have
[1:00:56] run that through his intellectual
[1:00:58] mindset what in the world why why am I
[1:01:00] going to say that well there's nobody
[1:01:01] going to believe that they'll make fun
[1:01:03] of me they ridicule me but God so tapped
[1:01:06] into the gift in that man's life he
[1:01:08] really didn't have no say about it it
[1:01:10] really didn't even matter if he didn't
[1:01:11] even believe it once it was done and we
[1:01:13] know sometimes a prophet would say
[1:01:15] things and then they'd get an attitude
[1:01:17] about God didn't Jonah do the same thing
[1:01:19] and others done the same thing Jeremiah
[1:01:21] said I made up in my mind I wasn't going
[1:01:23] to preach no more why it caused him all
[1:01:26] kinds of trouble all types of anxiety he
[1:01:29] said I made up my mind I wasn't going to
[1:01:31] speak no more in the name of the Lord
[1:01:33] and then he come back and said but his
[1:01:35] word was like a fire shut up inside my
[1:01:38] bones so you know what he really didn't
[1:01:40] have an option he really didn't have
[1:01:42] well God said boy thing you want to go
[1:01:44] and do it again he didn't have an option
[1:01:45] there was something inside of there that
[1:01:48] ability from that gift tied to the
[1:01:50] fourth dimension he jumped right back on
[1:01:51] and said the same thing again now watch
[1:01:53] what God does as he breaks into this
[1:01:56] gift in Zechariah let's look in verse
[1:01:58] 13. even he shall Bill the Temple of the
[1:02:02] Lord now what we're talking about is not
[1:02:04] that it's the man it's not the man
[1:02:07] Joshua it is not the man said to die
[1:02:10] it's not the man's cerebral but it is
[1:02:12] actually God prophesying of a man which
[1:02:17] will come and build the real Temple of
[1:02:20] the Lord he shall bear the glory the
[1:02:23] glory of what the Temple of the Lord and
[1:02:26] He Shall sit and Rule upon his throne
[1:02:30] and he shall be a priest upon his throne
[1:02:33] and the counsel of Peace shall be
[1:02:35] between them both now whoever this man
[1:02:38] is notice it doesn't say that he's an
[1:02:41] angel it does not say he's a cherubim a
[1:02:44] seraphim a zoon but it actually calls
[1:02:46] him a man the man whose name is the
[1:02:50] branch so this man is going to build the
[1:02:53] Temple of the Lord so it is the promise
[1:02:55] of a future building you imagine the
[1:02:58] Jews they are so elated and they are so
[1:03:00] excited because they're getting their
[1:03:02] Temple back and after all these years
[1:03:04] they haven't had one and they're getting
[1:03:06] their Temple rebuilt and while that is
[1:03:08] being rebuilt and the last church is
[1:03:10] being put on it God is speaking hundreds
[1:03:12] of years down the road and telling them
[1:03:15] of another man that's going to come and
[1:03:17] build another Temple
[1:03:19] now whenever the Jews begin to take
[1:03:22] these scriptures and down through time
[1:03:23] no doubt some of them begin to look and
[1:03:25] think wonder if this could be a
[1:03:27] Messianic prophecy well the temple which
[1:03:30] has now been currently under
[1:03:31] construction is built by who cerebral so
[1:03:35] zerubbabel is going to be the one that's
[1:03:36] going to bring her to the consummation
[1:03:38] and finish it Joshua has been anointed
[1:03:40] as being King which wasn't king so you
[1:03:43] imagine the people saying what is this
[1:03:45] Prophet doing what we're building the
[1:03:47] house right now Somebody Like Us come
[1:03:49] and say praise the Lord we've got to
[1:03:51] move in you're now a couple of services
[1:03:52] now we're starting to build a church a
[1:03:54] day after tomorrow down the road and
[1:03:56] y'all think poor brother Donnie he's
[1:03:58] lost his mind the poor guy he just
[1:04:00] saying the poor man there's something
[1:04:02] wrong with it well here they are they're
[1:04:04] so excited about building the house of
[1:04:06] God and this Prophet stand up and said
[1:04:08] don't be too carried away with this
[1:04:10] because there's coming a man that's
[1:04:11] going to build the Temple of the Lord
[1:04:12] and they're thinking build the Temple of
[1:04:14] the lord well this is the Temple of the
[1:04:16] Lord
[1:04:17] prophecy can be so mysterious can it not
[1:04:20] so the temple which he's building is not
[1:04:23] the one that zechariah's Prophet is
[1:04:25] prophesying about it is going to be a
[1:04:28] spiritual Temple which is going to be
[1:04:30] what the Church of the Living God yet
[1:04:32] the prophet Zechariah doesn't say it in
[1:04:35] those terms who knows if the man even
[1:04:37] knew what he was talking about or not
[1:04:39] and no doubt the prophets did whenever
[1:04:41] they would say something in the name of
[1:04:42] the Lord and they would write it down or
[1:04:44] have a scribe that would write it some
[1:04:45] of them couldn't write so they would
[1:04:47] actually have a scribe that would follow
[1:04:48] them around and they would write it they
[1:04:50] would just put it down as they said it
[1:04:52] and you imagine said well what what did
[1:04:54] I say well you you call that woman out
[1:04:56] and you said her name was so and so and
[1:04:58] is that right is that was that what your
[1:05:00] name is I don't even remember it
[1:05:02] remember our modern day Prophet done the
[1:05:04] same thing so they would say you mean I
[1:05:06] said that is that is that what I say
[1:05:08] that's what you said I wrote it down
[1:05:10] word for word and then prophets would
[1:05:12] think oh my goodness a virgin shall
[1:05:14] conceive and bring forth a child and
[1:05:16] you'll call his name Emmanuel the Mighty
[1:05:18] God the Everlasting father the prince of
[1:05:20] peace and of his kingdom there shall be
[1:05:22] no end you imagine they must still live
[1:05:24] such an odd peculiar life and people
[1:05:27] would have criticized them they would
[1:05:29] have made fun of them but they had to
[1:05:31] stand on what they believed was thus
[1:05:33] saith the Lord now watch if this was a
[1:05:37] prophecy now as I said we're looking
[1:05:39] back and that's what's much easier for
[1:05:41] us hindsight is always 20 20. so we're
[1:05:43] looking back and we're looking back to
[1:05:45] the cross and we can see the Fulfillment
[1:05:48] of that scripture watch in Matthew
[1:05:49] chapter 20 verse 28 even as the son of
[1:05:53] man came not to be ministered unto but
[1:05:56] to minister to give his life a ransom
[1:05:59] for many now notice what this man whose
[1:06:02] name is the branch is going to do he is
[1:06:05] going to build the Temple of the Lord
[1:06:08] now unlike zerubbabel and all of those
[1:06:11] men in that day they was taking up out
[1:06:14] of the rubble and they were digging up
[1:06:16] Stone so what they would do they would
[1:06:18] make basically a tale it's called a tell
[1:06:21] t-e-l-l like right now whenever they're
[1:06:23] digging down in the city of David around
[1:06:25] cerusalem and they've just dug under and
[1:06:28] found the the steps that went up to the
[1:06:30] place to be able to worship and they
[1:06:32] said these are the same steps the Lord
[1:06:34] Jesus would have walked upon yet they
[1:06:36] had to dig down like 22 feet under dirt
[1:06:40] and stone and rubble and all kinds of
[1:06:43] things so what did they do so instead of
[1:06:45] carrying All That Rock away they were
[1:06:48] just haul in more and level it out haul
[1:06:50] in more and level it out so they would
[1:06:52] build one on top of another on top of
[1:06:55] another so they're digging down and
[1:06:57] digging down and the more they dig the
[1:07:00] more identity they find of who live
[1:07:02] there
[1:07:03] it's the same way with us if we can dig
[1:07:05] past our traditions and our fears and
[1:07:08] all those sort of things and really find
[1:07:10] out who we really are well he is going
[1:07:13] to build the house of God but he's not
[1:07:15] going to use the stones that they use
[1:07:17] what's he going to use well he will have
[1:07:20] to find something of material by which
[1:07:24] he can build the temple out of the house
[1:07:26] of God so what's it going to be is it
[1:07:29] going to be Jerusalem Stone now
[1:07:30] Jerusalem still has this it's a word
[1:07:32] that if you build inside the old city
[1:07:34] walls it is a legal mandate you must use
[1:07:37] either Old Jerusalem stone or New
[1:07:40] Jerusalem Stone which is still mined I
[1:07:43] saw a video not long ago where they had
[1:07:45] actually found one of the original
[1:07:46] places to where Solomon and his men went
[1:07:49] down in there and mined all of this
[1:07:51] Stone and took it out of the ground it's
[1:07:54] a mandate in order to keep this
[1:07:56] particular look well God has a look in
[1:07:59] his mind of what he wanted the temple to
[1:08:01] be now it's not a certain skin in color
[1:08:03] and it's not a certain way and a certain
[1:08:06] stature you got to be so tall but that
[1:08:09] would have to be something that he would
[1:08:11] be able to purchase or buy or create or
[1:08:14] recreate in order to have the material
[1:08:17] to make this now we know it has whenever
[1:08:19] we build a house or a building and we
[1:08:21] want something so y'all are sitting on a
[1:08:24] concrete floor so we would call the
[1:08:25] concrete company and say we want so many
[1:08:27] yards and they would come well this wall
[1:08:29] here is made out of metal studs this
[1:08:31] one's made out of studs got Steel on top
[1:08:34] Yep this wall here is made out of
[1:08:35] plywood two layers of plywood right here
[1:08:38] two between I was running down this way
[1:08:39] so we've got all sorts of material and
[1:08:42] each one of those things has a specific
[1:08:45] use and yet it's the same way in the
[1:08:47] body of God now zachariah's prophesying
[1:08:50] that there's going to come a
[1:08:52] construction man and he's going to be
[1:08:54] the head contractor for deity and
[1:08:57] construction company and he's going to
[1:08:59] be able to make this type of body and it
[1:09:02] will be a body boasts natural and
[1:09:05] spiritual and he will bear the glory of
[1:09:08] this Temple himself and he will build
[1:09:11] the temple so where is he going to get
[1:09:13] the material to make it well it won't be
[1:09:16] Stone and it won't be out of the rubble
[1:09:18] that's irritable in them is now dug out
[1:09:20] but it will be a buried treasure that is
[1:09:24] carried around in human bodies it won't
[1:09:27] even be knowledgeable or visible to
[1:09:29] those who pack to treasure they will be
[1:09:32] born like other Mortals they will come
[1:09:34] into Life Born Into time they will have
[1:09:37] a lot of them no purpose in life at all
[1:09:39] others will have a great agenda of what
[1:09:41] they want to accomplish and one day they
[1:09:43] will meet this head contractor and he
[1:09:46] will change their lives forever he will
[1:09:50] set them into the economy of God and he
[1:09:52] will start working on them from the
[1:09:55] inside out
[1:09:57] and then he will place them in relation
[1:10:00] to a body on the Earth by which they can
[1:10:03] Fellowship now we know that we come to
[1:10:05] the house of God not just to see one
[1:10:07] another we don't come here just to be
[1:10:09] seen but we come to fellowship with each
[1:10:11] other truly but we come mainly to
[1:10:14] fellowship with God is that right but
[1:10:16] yet we also realize we need one another
[1:10:19] I need you I trust you need me you not
[1:10:23] only need me but you need those brothers
[1:10:25] and sisters that are setting around you
[1:10:27] so here he comes to the earth now
[1:10:29] whenever the Lord Jesus comes upon the
[1:10:31] Earth and he's going around as it were
[1:10:34] looking for building material and he
[1:10:37] found it some of it was in a refuge pile
[1:10:39] for sure some of it was found to where
[1:10:42] even the devil didn't think there's no
[1:10:44] hope for him but the devil could only
[1:10:46] see what was on the inside and be able
[1:10:49] to peer down into the realm of the
[1:10:50] spirit and see what he thought was
[1:10:52] damaged goods so damaged said he
[1:10:54] probably thought that never be able to
[1:10:56] be redeemed but this general contractor
[1:10:59] has the ability to look past the flesh
[1:11:02] past the spirit into the soul and see
[1:11:05] representation
[1:11:07] now even at that when he knows the
[1:11:09] reputation is there it is stained it is
[1:11:12] soiled by by sin and it must be brought
[1:11:15] to a process in order for the Builder to
[1:11:18] be able to use him now once the words of
[1:11:20] the Lord Jesus even as the son of man
[1:11:22] came not to be ministered unto but to
[1:11:24] minister but to give his life a ransom
[1:11:28] for how many
[1:11:30] Oh you mean not all
[1:11:33] not every Mortal lives on the earth now
[1:11:34] you want to argue argue with the Lord
[1:11:36] Jesus these are his words so the son of
[1:11:38] man came not to be ministered to but to
[1:11:41] give his life as a ransom for many so
[1:11:44] what would be a ransom well you know
[1:11:46] we've heard of ransoms in our time so
[1:11:48] some rich person they capture a daughter
[1:11:51] of those or a granddaughter or a son or
[1:11:53] something like that and they will call
[1:11:55] him on the phone and they'll mask their
[1:11:57] voice you've heard that and they will
[1:11:59] Master voice and they say we've got your
[1:12:01] son here he is Dad Dad it's me it's me
[1:12:04] uh you know do what they say dad they're
[1:12:06] going to kill me if you don't do it then
[1:12:08] they take the phone back away from them
[1:12:10] and they'll say look we want two point
[1:12:12] million dollars well most of us they'd
[1:12:14] say just go ahead and bury him and when
[1:12:16] well I could do that 75 cents maybe well
[1:12:19] we want two point meal that's why they
[1:12:20] don't capture our youngest some of y'all
[1:12:23] was praying they would
[1:12:24] well he ain't got well we ain't got no
[1:12:26] money to be able to Ransom so they tell
[1:12:28] them look we want this money you better
[1:12:30] not call the police neither because if
[1:12:32] we see the police weren't killing him
[1:12:33] dead or in a hammer so we're going to be
[1:12:35] at a certain certain spot you get that
[1:12:37] then you meet him and we'll turn them
[1:12:39] loose oh why do they call that they're
[1:12:41] holding them for around some well then
[1:12:43] they try to figure every way they can to
[1:12:45] Mark the bills they try to put secret
[1:12:47] messages on them and everything so they
[1:12:49] can trace it down well we were all born
[1:12:51] in this prison house and sinful humanity
[1:12:55] and we were all held at captured by who
[1:12:58] the devil the enemy of the Lord God so
[1:13:01] we were held in this place and we were
[1:13:04] held for what a great Ransom Moses
[1:13:07] couldn't do it Jeremiah I couldn't do it
[1:13:09] Zechariah couldn't do it no one could do
[1:13:11] it because man was in a great Strait it
[1:13:15] could not be an angel to redeem him and
[1:13:17] he couldn't be a Kinsmen Redeemer God
[1:13:19] was the spirit so God couldn't redeem
[1:13:21] him so there was only one thing that
[1:13:24] could be done the answer to man's
[1:13:27] dilemma was what seemed to be a crossing
[1:13:30] of the Tomb now God himself was in this
[1:13:34] holy strain the mighty hell on him he
[1:13:36] could not die of course he could not
[1:13:38] even even be seen by the natural eye and
[1:13:41] you was man on the earth everyone broke
[1:13:43] the womb come forth a sinner marked by
[1:13:45] sin Cain it come to the world speaking
[1:13:47] lies so how in the world are you ever
[1:13:51] going to be able to get something or
[1:13:53] someone that can be able to meet to tell
[1:13:55] well the answer is right here and what
[1:13:58] we call the cross
[1:14:00] now look at these two beams what we call
[1:14:03] it a cross so the symbol that he died on
[1:14:07] symbolize who and what he was he was a
[1:14:12] cross in the sense he was both God and
[1:14:16] man
[1:14:17] so looking at it from the outside they
[1:14:20] thought he was simply a man and part of
[1:14:22] the time it becomes so confusing even to
[1:14:25] the disciples because the prophet said
[1:14:27] part of the time it was the father
[1:14:28] speaking and part of the time it was
[1:14:30] Jesus speaking so the father would speak
[1:14:32] and then Jesus would speak and then the
[1:14:35] father would speak and Jesus was fake I
[1:14:37] hope you understand you yourself are the
[1:14:40] same way once you become truly born
[1:14:42] again and the father lives in you you
[1:14:45] know what it's like to get that
[1:14:46] pulsation of faith and something speaks
[1:14:49] out of you that's not even yourself you
[1:14:51] ever had it to happen to you well that's
[1:14:52] the father speaking out of you and then
[1:14:55] there's other times you do the talking
[1:14:57] well most of us it's probably us does
[1:14:58] most of the talking most the time maybe
[1:15:00] so the Lord Jesus dying on the cross was
[1:15:04] only an answer of his life that it was
[1:15:07] deity which had been crossed and mixed
[1:15:10] together with Humanity this is the only
[1:15:13] way to bring the building material back
[1:15:16] into the presence sense of god notice
[1:15:19] again in Acts 20 and 28 take heed
[1:15:22] therefore unto yourselves and to all the
[1:15:24] flock over which the Holy Ghost has made
[1:15:26] you overseers to feed the Church of God
[1:15:28] which he has purchased with his own
[1:15:32] blood so now he was a ransom in Matthew
[1:15:34] 20. now he is the purchase price and
[1:15:38] remember the Old Testament that they
[1:15:40] actually had what was called Redemption
[1:15:42] money I mean notice what that
[1:15:43] metallurgical value was it was not
[1:15:45] bronze it was not gold but it was silver
[1:15:47] so silver was a metallurgical symbol of
[1:15:51] redemption now remember gold is deity so
[1:15:55] gold itself was not what redeemed the
[1:15:57] firstborn so you had a mule that was
[1:15:59] born or a donkey I should say not a mule
[1:16:01] a donkey that was born he was flop here
[1:16:04] and he was all bow-legged he's standing
[1:16:06] around and his mama said oh son oh
[1:16:08] you're so ugly they'll kill you as sure
[1:16:10] as they see you and that little fighter
[1:16:12] said Mama Mama I'm so bow-legged I'm so
[1:16:15] ugly my ears is floppy and his mama she
[1:16:17] already taught in the word should say
[1:16:19] sonny boy today is your day you are my
[1:16:22] firstborn because you are my firstborn
[1:16:26] you can be redeemed Oh Glory to God now
[1:16:31] notice what they did was they would go
[1:16:33] through the act of redemption and he
[1:16:34] would be redeemed but with some man that
[1:16:37] God gave them silver silver and they
[1:16:40] would be able to take that silver
[1:16:42] because God wanted the firstborn of all
[1:16:44] the tribes of Israel but God said I'll
[1:16:46] tell you what I'll do I'll let you keep
[1:16:48] your firstborn children but you can
[1:16:51] redeem them from me so bind back from me
[1:16:54] and let silver speak on their behalf so
[1:16:57] a firstborn son which would be me
[1:16:59] Madonna and Betty's first son first born
[1:17:01] that when I was first born by law God
[1:17:04] had a claim on me so God by his law
[1:17:07] would have claimed me but Mom and Daddy
[1:17:09] would have went and said now God we love
[1:17:11] Donnie and we want to keep God in our
[1:17:13] house so we're going to give this silver
[1:17:15] this Redemption money to buy Donnie so
[1:17:19] Donnie can be in our house and God said
[1:17:22] I'll trade with you I'll take the silver
[1:17:25] you take Donnie
[1:17:27] there's probably time to say we said
[1:17:29] kept the silver maybe
[1:17:31] but God did that soul that they could
[1:17:34] but redeem their firstborn now here we
[1:17:37] come then out to the Cross when the Lord
[1:17:40] Jesus comes to the Earth whenever he is
[1:17:43] now going to act out the part of the
[1:17:45] buyer and of the judge which is
[1:17:48] Satisfied by the amount that was paid I
[1:17:51] know I don't want to confuse you tonight
[1:17:52] but it's it's not three Gods it's not
[1:17:55] even two Gods it's the same God acting
[1:17:58] out different parts of the drama so one
[1:18:01] time you see him he's walking through
[1:18:03] the pawn shop pushing a buddy a buggy of
[1:18:06] electric attributes said he picked up
[1:18:08] off a shell here was one in a bar here
[1:18:10] was one in this church there was one in
[1:18:12] that church and he began to set them all
[1:18:14] down through there and he headed right
[1:18:16] up towards the front because he had the
[1:18:18] matching part of their soul so he had
[1:18:20] the Peace by which they could be
[1:18:22] Redeemed by so he stands out there and
[1:18:25] he presents the bug and he lays him up
[1:18:27] on there and then all of a sudden he
[1:18:29] changes his garments and he steps on
[1:18:31] behind the cash register and he pays
[1:18:34] himself
[1:18:36] hallelujah hallelujah so the justice of
[1:18:40] God was met in this human Cross of deity
[1:18:45] and humanity and the justice of God
[1:18:48] finally was met by what mercy so mercy
[1:18:52] and Grace kissed and embraced you see
[1:18:56] they had been divorced they had been
[1:18:58] apart for all these hundreds and
[1:19:00] hundreds of years but through the
[1:19:02] marriage of deity and Humanity mercy and
[1:19:06] judgment met together and the person of
[1:19:09] the Lord Jesus that's why you're sitting
[1:19:12] here tonight and good saying I am
[1:19:14] redeemed I am redeemed how how is that
[1:19:17] even possible because the man whose name
[1:19:21] was the branch he was able to come down
[1:19:24] and buy the material to build a church
[1:19:28] First Corinthians chapter 6 verse 20 for
[1:19:31] ye are bought with a price now notice I
[1:19:35] know people especially in this age don't
[1:19:37] like to be told what to do you know well
[1:19:39] you shouldn't dress this way you
[1:19:41] shouldn't do that you shouldn't go there
[1:19:42] you shouldn't do this people don't like
[1:19:44] it they just don't they just don't like
[1:19:45] it but remember you are bought with the
[1:19:48] price and in reality you are not your
[1:19:51] own well I'm going to do what I want to
[1:19:52] do well that tells me then you don't
[1:19:54] understand Redemption now this Gatorade
[1:19:57] was bought I'm not sure who bought it
[1:19:58] but I'm glad they did they bought this
[1:20:00] Gatorade a price was paid for this
[1:20:03] Gatorade now it is mine because they
[1:20:05] brought it up here and set it on my
[1:20:06] Pulpit it's in my left hand and if I
[1:20:10] want to take my right hand and take the
[1:20:12] lid off of my bottle of Gatorade if I
[1:20:15] want to do that and drink the whole
[1:20:16] bottle it's mine I can do what I want to
[1:20:18] if I want to take the lid off it's
[1:20:20] getting pretty warm I don't like warm
[1:20:22] Gatorade so if I want to take the lid
[1:20:24] off and take it to the back and pour it
[1:20:26] down the sink I can do that why because
[1:20:29] it is mine you are not your own but you
[1:20:33] are bought with a price and what for for
[1:20:36] the house of God what I've got my own
[1:20:38] life I've got my own agenda no you are
[1:20:40] not here for your own agenda I'm not
[1:20:43] here for my own agenda I am here to
[1:20:46] serve his purpose praise the Lord and he
[1:20:49] bought us with the price and therefore
[1:20:51] he will put us where he wants us all
[1:20:55] glory he ought with the price therefore
[1:20:58] glorify God in your body
[1:21:01] and in your spirit which are Gods First
[1:21:06] Corinthians 7 23 ye are bought with a
[1:21:09] price be not ye the Servants of men this
[1:21:12] is why you don't owe your allegiance to
[1:21:15] men you don't know your allegiance to
[1:21:17] the world you belong to the Lord Jesus
[1:21:20] Christ
[1:21:21] now he prepares them he buys them and
[1:21:25] then he prepares him he renews them by
[1:21:28] his grace and he begins to form and
[1:21:32] shape and polish them in order to fit
[1:21:35] and the predestinated slot that he
[1:21:37] ordained them to walk out now for many
[1:21:39] of us it will be totally different than
[1:21:41] what we want it'll be totally different
[1:21:43] than what we thought but I want you to
[1:21:45] notice in the Book of Genesis we find a
[1:21:47] conveying of God and where he was after
[1:21:49] man fell God walked God walked with his
[1:21:54] people now notice this verb and Enoch
[1:21:57] walked with God after he began methusa
[1:21:59] 300 years and he begat sons and
[1:22:02] daughters in verse 24 he not walked with
[1:22:04] God and he was not for God took him
[1:22:07] Genesis 6 9 these are the generations of
[1:22:10] Noah Noah was a just man and a perfect
[1:22:13] in his generation and Noah walked with
[1:22:16] God so notice then what we find in the
[1:22:18] Book of Genesis we find God walking with
[1:22:21] men this is the relationship that God
[1:22:25] chose up in the Book of Genesis again we
[1:22:28] see God now changing in the book of
[1:22:31] Exodus so we move from Exodus and we
[1:22:33] move over Genesis rather to the Book of
[1:22:35] Exodus Exodus chapter 25 verse 8 and God
[1:22:39] said let them make me speaking to the
[1:22:41] children of Israel let them make me a
[1:22:44] sanctuary that I may dwell among them
[1:22:48] not walk among them now watch God is now
[1:22:51] entering and bringing the people into a
[1:22:53] different dispensation so it's no longer
[1:22:56] that God will just walk among them but
[1:22:59] God wants to dwell among them look at
[1:23:02] the meaning of this word to settle down
[1:23:05] abide reside so God wanted to settle
[1:23:09] down you imagine God wanted to settle
[1:23:13] down so God said Moses let them build me
[1:23:16] a house so I can come down and I want to
[1:23:20] dwell with him can you imagine how
[1:23:21] Mighty God wanted to come down and hear
[1:23:24] the people so he's going to be in this
[1:23:25] tent and the people are going to be
[1:23:27] sitting on all four sides according to
[1:23:29] their tribal Banner so they will sit
[1:23:31] there and God was on the inside this
[1:23:34] Shekinah presence of God and God's
[1:23:36] hearing them talking about trading goats
[1:23:38] and milk cows God's children I'm talking
[1:23:41] about racing their onions and their
[1:23:42] taters and their maters and God shared
[1:23:45] on talking about their family problems
[1:23:46] and God sharing them talking about all
[1:23:49] these domestic things of Life why
[1:23:50] because God wanted to dwell among them
[1:23:54] he wanted to come down and not just walk
[1:23:57] with an Enoch and walk with a Noah and
[1:23:59] walk with this man and that man but God
[1:24:01] wanted to be right there amongst them
[1:24:03] and just hear what this talk about Lord
[1:24:06] have mercy children can you imagine the
[1:24:08] great Eternal wanting to be a part of
[1:24:10] our life
[1:24:12] I believe he wants more than that today
[1:24:14] I don't think he just wants to come in
[1:24:16] here two or three times a week I think
[1:24:18] he wants to be with us every day of our
[1:24:20] life brother Paul I think he wants to be
[1:24:22] right there he wants to be a part of
[1:24:24] your life a part of your family a part
[1:24:26] of your house a part of everything that
[1:24:28] you do in life he wants to be a part of
[1:24:30] that people make God this this creature
[1:24:33] this way out yonder somewhere that it
[1:24:36] does not even concern himself with our
[1:24:38] problems that is a lie of the devil he
[1:24:40] is concerned about your troubles he is
[1:24:43] concerned about your problems he's
[1:24:45] concerned about your bills he's
[1:24:47] concerned about your shortcomings he's
[1:24:49] concerned about you so things that
[1:24:52] matter to you matter to God
[1:24:56] wow
[1:24:58] notice this so God says I'm that I may
[1:25:01] dwell among them again Exodus 29 45 and
[1:25:05] I will dwell among the children of
[1:25:07] Israel and will be their God oh my I
[1:25:12] will be their God verse 46 and they
[1:25:14] shall know that I am the Lord their God
[1:25:15] that brought them forth out of the land
[1:25:17] of Egypt that I may dwell he keeps
[1:25:19] saying it over and over again that I may
[1:25:22] dwell among them I am the Lord and what
[1:25:25] do we find God dwelt in the Tabernacle
[1:25:27] until the people of Israel sins got so
[1:25:31] horrendous that the glory of God lifted
[1:25:34] off of the Tabernacle and departed away
[1:25:36] from it and they renamed it and called
[1:25:39] it Ichabod which means the glory has
[1:25:42] Departed
[1:25:44] but it was not God's desire or God's
[1:25:46] choice now this is what happened on the
[1:25:48] Tabernacle and Exodus chapter 40 verse
[1:25:50] 34 a cloud covered the tent of the
[1:25:53] congregation and the glory of the Lord
[1:25:56] fill the Tabernacle I want you to listen
[1:25:58] now what it was that filled the
[1:25:59] Tabernacle it was the glory of the Lord
[1:26:02] remember that the glory of the Lord is
[1:26:05] what filled the Tabernacle it does not
[1:26:07] say it was his theophany it was the
[1:26:10] glory of the Lord remember the prophecy
[1:26:13] in Zechariah was the man whose name is
[1:26:15] the branch will build the Temple of the
[1:26:17] Lord and He Shall bear the glory himself
[1:26:20] so whatever it was they came into that
[1:26:23] Tabernacle that Shekinah of God the
[1:26:26] glory of God is what this man is going
[1:26:29] to Bear whose name is the branch notice
[1:26:31] in verse 35 and Moses was not able to
[1:26:34] enter into the tent of the congregation
[1:26:36] because the cloud Abode thereon and the
[1:26:40] glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle
[1:26:42] oh what a great thing it must have been
[1:26:44] verse 37 but if the cloud were not taken
[1:26:47] up then they journeyed not until the day
[1:26:49] it was taken up for the cloud of the
[1:26:52] Lord was upon the Tabernacle by day and
[1:26:55] fire on it by Night a visible
[1:26:57] manifestation of the presence of God in
[1:27:00] the sight of all the house of Israel
[1:27:02] throughout all their Journeys and then
[1:27:05] God dwelt there and God did until the
[1:27:08] time run out then what did God do God
[1:27:10] had a man by the name of Solomon and
[1:27:13] Solomon come and built a temple for God
[1:27:15] the glory of God now moves inside of
[1:27:19] this Temple First Kings 8 10. and he
[1:27:22] came to pass when the priests will come
[1:27:24] out of the Holy place that the cloud
[1:27:26] fill the house of the Lord so that the
[1:27:29] priest could not stand to minister
[1:27:31] because of the cloud for the glory of
[1:27:34] the Lord had filled the house of the
[1:27:36] Lord then spake Solomon the Lord said he
[1:27:39] would dwell in the thick Darkness
[1:27:42] Oh What A Time
[1:27:45] well you know the sad part about it is
[1:27:48] Ezekiel chapter 10 verse 18. then the
[1:27:52] glory of the Lord departed off the
[1:27:55] threshold of the house and stood over
[1:27:58] the cherubims
[1:28:00] so once again the glory of God leaves
[1:28:04] the house of God
[1:28:06] can't you understand for a child of God
[1:28:08] today that is filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:28:12] Satan fights you like no other person on
[1:28:15] the face of the Earth if he cannot get
[1:28:18] your soul like he once had it what he
[1:28:22] wants to do is get you out of fellowship
[1:28:25] with God
[1:28:26] he cannot stand this Unity that the
[1:28:31] Great Divine architect wanted and
[1:28:34] created in his body
[1:28:36] so once a person is sealed by the Holy
[1:28:38] Ghost the devil will never be able to
[1:28:40] get in that Soul again but the devil
[1:28:43] will try to make us indifferent or cold
[1:28:46] or make us bitter or make us have
[1:28:48] attitudes remember the scripture in
[1:28:50] Ephesians 4 30 grieve not the holy
[1:28:53] spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto
[1:28:56] the day of your Redemption so this
[1:28:57] scripture is actually addressing people
[1:29:00] that are filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:29:03] people fill with the Holy Ghost can do
[1:29:05] things that will grieve the spirit of
[1:29:08] God what's he trying to do the same
[1:29:11] thing to you in the anatite that he did
[1:29:14] to the children of Israel to where the
[1:29:16] glory of God will the perfume of Life
[1:29:17] some of you you know what that feeling
[1:29:19] is you get colds you get indifference
[1:29:22] something gets in your life you still
[1:29:23] love God you'll still go to church
[1:29:25] you'll see you're not there you're
[1:29:27] running around and doing this and that
[1:29:28] and the other but it seems like
[1:29:29] something's left let me tell you what it
[1:29:32] is it's the glory the glory the glory
[1:29:35] has left you your walk and you're having
[1:29:38] problems with this and you know you go
[1:29:39] to church and you sit there and you
[1:29:41] struggle and you struggle and you try to
[1:29:43] get in and your mind's at Walmart some
[1:29:45] of you has done fixed your tractor
[1:29:46] tonight and some of you fix your
[1:29:47] lawnmower because the grass is starting
[1:29:49] to grow again some of you stopped your
[1:29:50] Hogs and feds your chickens well you
[1:29:52] need to let them chickens wait till
[1:29:53] after I get done preaching
[1:29:55] what does that well it's the devil of
[1:29:58] course trying to hinder you if there's
[1:29:59] any place he will hinder you from it's
[1:30:01] the house of God why he don't want you
[1:30:04] to come here and he sees this Divine
[1:30:06] Purpose that God has done that now the
[1:30:09] members of Christ on the Earth are his
[1:30:12] glory and they are the place where he
[1:30:14] dwells so the glory of God then in the
[1:30:16] Ezekiel we see the glory of God move
[1:30:18] from the threshold of the Tabernacle and
[1:30:21] it goes upon the cherubims and it stands
[1:30:23] over the cherubims Hosea 10 5 and the
[1:30:26] inhabitants of Samaria shall fear
[1:30:28] because of the calves of Beth Haven now
[1:30:30] here they made golden calves and they're
[1:30:32] worshiping them calves for the people
[1:30:34] there have shall mourn over it and the
[1:30:36] priests thereofs that rejoiced on it for
[1:30:39] the glory thereof because it is departed
[1:30:41] from it so the glory of God wound up
[1:30:44] believing again and we know of course
[1:30:46] whenever whenever it was rebuilt again
[1:30:48] the time and the days of the Lord Jesus
[1:30:50] and Herod spent 46 years in building an
[1:30:52] Attica which was actually the second
[1:30:54] temple and whenever he enlarged the
[1:30:57] courtyard and made it very very
[1:30:58] beautiful we have no record whatsoever
[1:31:00] the spirit of God ever went back into
[1:31:01] that place so where was God when the
[1:31:05] Lord Jesus was on the earth in his human
[1:31:08] Tabernacle now here excuse me God's next
[1:31:12] Dwelling Place was going to be a human
[1:31:16] body now who was it it was the master
[1:31:18] builder himself that stepped inside his
[1:31:22] own Creative Body so the master builder
[1:31:25] God the Eternal steps inside of this
[1:31:29] human body which we call a son now what
[1:31:32] makes it so difficult for us is that we
[1:31:34] know having the children all of us that
[1:31:37] boy when everything well this this
[1:31:39] certain man he had this you know he
[1:31:41] married this woman and they had a child
[1:31:43] and that's his son so we look at that
[1:31:45] father and then we think well there's
[1:31:47] the son which is another person and
[1:31:49] that's the way it works and the humans
[1:31:51] train but that ain't the way it works in
[1:31:53] the God's trade and the gods train the
[1:31:56] Eternal projected something out of his
[1:31:58] own heart Christ was the very heart of
[1:32:00] God not another God that one out of that
[1:32:03] God but the very portion of that God
[1:32:05] which the Old Testament kept seal they
[1:32:08] never knew the love of God and the death
[1:32:10] said it would be revealed in the New
[1:32:12] Testament God projects that out of
[1:32:14] himself that's why the Lord Jesus said I
[1:32:16] came forth from God and I go back to
[1:32:19] being God or back to God because that
[1:32:23] was the projection that could die the
[1:32:25] Eternal could not die this was the
[1:32:28] sonship now notice in Saint John 10 38.
[1:32:32] he said if I do though you believe me
[1:32:34] not believe the works that you may know
[1:32:36] and believe that the father is in me and
[1:32:40] I in him so where is the father then now
[1:32:43] the Lord Jesus of course goes to the
[1:32:45] temple and he offers the sacrifice as
[1:32:47] Martin misfold which is 12 years old and
[1:32:50] there he was dedicated as a wee little
[1:32:51] boy but we have no record he was ever
[1:32:53] allowed to preach there because he was
[1:32:55] of the tribe of Judah and not of the
[1:32:57] tribe of Levi so he went there but never
[1:32:59] allowed to go in behind the holiest of
[1:33:01] holies he was never allowed to preach in
[1:33:04] the Holy place of God but we have no
[1:33:06] record that God was even there anyway as
[1:33:08] far as the same thing that it was in the
[1:33:09] days of Solomon so where was God God was
[1:33:13] in his new Temple his new house now I'm
[1:33:16] going to say it to you this way we've
[1:33:17] spent years couple years now building
[1:33:19] this place a lot of Labor a lot of work
[1:33:22] a lot of sacrifice but don't get it in
[1:33:24] your mind now that this this building
[1:33:26] right here is where God lives so
[1:33:28] whenever we all come in God's here and
[1:33:31] then when we come and well you know we
[1:33:33] all go back home and we go our way and
[1:33:35] we leave God right here because this is
[1:33:37] where God lives God is here because
[1:33:39] you're here and he would meet with us if
[1:33:42] we was in a brush Harbor and a
[1:33:43] storefront because we bring him with us
[1:33:46] so it's not like that the presence of
[1:33:49] God we honor and we reverence this
[1:33:51] because this is when we worship Him of
[1:33:53] course but you bring him and I bring him
[1:33:55] and you bring him and you bring him and
[1:33:56] you bring him so you bring your lick of
[1:33:59] fire and that's why we need one another
[1:34:01] you understand
[1:34:03] notice this in second Corinthians
[1:34:05] chapter 5 verse 19 to with that God was
[1:34:08] in Christ reconciling the world to
[1:34:11] himself so here God was in his human
[1:34:15] Temple God was in Christ reconciled the
[1:34:18] world to himself not imputing their
[1:34:20] trespasses unto them and as committed
[1:34:22] unto us the word of reconciliation now
[1:34:26] it goes on the next verse and said he's
[1:34:27] also given to us the ministry of
[1:34:30] reconciliation so now God is having men
[1:34:33] who are called to preach the gospel and
[1:34:36] they are carrying out the same thing the
[1:34:38] master Carpenter started two thousand
[1:34:40] years ago that's why the devil hates God
[1:34:43] called preachers why he knows God called
[1:34:45] preachers ain't building a building for
[1:34:47] themselves now Satan loves egotistical
[1:34:50] anointed preachers because they're
[1:34:53] building their own little kingdom for
[1:34:55] their own little name for their own
[1:34:57] little deal but a real true man of God
[1:34:59] ain't building a Reagan Kingdom or a
[1:35:01] Spencer Kingdom or whatever other
[1:35:03] Kingdom they're simply glad to be
[1:35:06] identified as a worker in the Kingdom of
[1:35:08] almighty God somebody tell me why in the
[1:35:11] world would I want to build a Donnie
[1:35:12] Reagan Kingdom and forfeit my rights
[1:35:15] into eternal life when I can be a part
[1:35:17] of the biggest kingdom that's ever been
[1:35:19] on the Earth but you see I can't build a
[1:35:22] Reagan Kingdom and build to the kingdom
[1:35:24] of God at the same time there ain't no
[1:35:25] way totally impossible it's got to be
[1:35:28] one of the other and don't just look at
[1:35:30] me as a preacher it's the same thing for
[1:35:32] you you can build your own little life
[1:35:34] your own little world your own little
[1:35:35] kingdom and then you'll give Jesus just
[1:35:37] a little bit of space of your life or
[1:35:39] you can give him your all and you'll get
[1:35:42] rewarded at that day oh my goodness
[1:35:43] it'll be on anything you can imagine in
[1:35:46] your mind
[1:35:47] notice in Colossians chapter 1 verse 14
[1:35:50] in whom we have Redemption through his
[1:35:53] blood even the Forgiveness of sins who
[1:35:56] is the image of the invisible
[1:35:59] God
[1:36:02] so the Lord Jesus was the temple or the
[1:36:06] house of the being which could not be
[1:36:09] seen
[1:36:10] he is the sealable part of the Unseen
[1:36:14] God
[1:36:16] praise the Lord
[1:36:19] who is the image of the invisible God
[1:36:21] the firstborn of every creature
[1:36:24] Colossians 2 9 for in him dwelleth the
[1:36:28] fullness of the godhead bodily so today
[1:36:32] then of course beginning with Acts 2 he
[1:36:35] dwells where in his church now in the
[1:36:38] book of Acts chapter 7 verse 48 how be
[1:36:40] it the most high dwell us not in temples
[1:36:44] or churches
[1:36:48] made with hands I saith the prophet
[1:36:52] so don't take tonight whenever we
[1:36:54] dismiss here in a little bit that we're
[1:36:56] all going to go out and almighty God is
[1:36:58] going to be left in here and he sleeps
[1:37:00] in here and he stays in here and this is
[1:37:02] where God dwells
[1:37:04] God dwells in your heart
[1:37:06] I believe if we really believe that we'd
[1:37:09] act different at home would act
[1:37:11] different on the job well my goodness
[1:37:13] some of you Brothers wouldn't come in
[1:37:14] here wearing a hat for nothing you
[1:37:16] wouldn't come in here some of you would
[1:37:17] never come in here and raise your voice
[1:37:19] while you won't talk after church you
[1:37:22] will not talk before church is good
[1:37:23] that's what we should do we need to
[1:37:24] reverence that and thank God that we do
[1:37:27] but yet what about in our own life what
[1:37:29] about in the house of God oh you
[1:37:31] wouldn't throw a fit you wouldn't lose
[1:37:33] your temper in the house of God or not
[1:37:34] but you lose one in this house
[1:37:38] we need to recognize where God actually
[1:37:41] lives and where God actually dwell can't
[1:37:45] you see that why Satan looks at this and
[1:37:47] Satan says I hate this I hate what he's
[1:37:50] been able to do so what will he try to
[1:37:52] do divide divide and this is his same
[1:37:56] context that he's used and the same
[1:37:58] tactics he used from the Garden of Eden
[1:38:00] and that was divide and conquer so he'll
[1:38:04] try to divide us among ourselves he'll
[1:38:06] try to get in in between the husband and
[1:38:08] wife in their home come on now don't get
[1:38:11] quiet on me he will try to get between
[1:38:12] the husband and his wife in their home
[1:38:15] and cause them to bicker and fuss and
[1:38:16] fight and argue and whatever more why he
[1:38:19] knows you're only as strong as the unity
[1:38:22] projected in your walk with God you see
[1:38:25] this type of unity is not a
[1:38:27] denominational auspices that we all join
[1:38:30] together because we're United so and so
[1:38:32] on United so and so it is each one of us
[1:38:35] baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body
[1:38:38] of Jesus Christ and yet at the same time
[1:38:41] individual members that are as different
[1:38:43] as days from night one from the other
[1:38:45] God don't want you to be like me God
[1:38:48] don't want me to be like you but he
[1:38:50] wants all of us to be like Jesus Christ
[1:38:54] and the church said
[1:38:56] oh my so he dwells in the hearts of
[1:38:58] those that have received a spirit notice
[1:39:00] Psalms 40. so he builds his Temple by
[1:39:05] taking dead stones out of the pit of sin
[1:39:10] Psalms 40 and 2 he brought me also out
[1:39:13] of a horrible pit
[1:39:16] out of the Maori clay
[1:39:18] and set my feet upon a rock
[1:39:21] an established my Goings
[1:39:25] praise the Lord Ephesians 2 21 and whom
[1:39:30] all
[1:39:31] the building fitly framed I love this
[1:39:35] because Paul used the words that a
[1:39:37] carpenter in that day would have used
[1:39:40] so it's not like it's just thrown
[1:39:42] together you know just get this long
[1:39:44] board and tied to this stick and tie it
[1:39:46] to this piece of stuccoa just to take a
[1:39:48] you know take a a piece of Scotch tape I
[1:39:50] know what we can do this let's duct tape
[1:39:52] it all together they to duct tape they
[1:39:54] say is just absolutely phenomenal on
[1:39:56] this day well you can't duct tape a
[1:39:57] Christian you can't duct tape we're not
[1:39:59] Ducks no hand we're Eagles amen and
[1:40:02] Eagles and we don't have to use no tape
[1:40:03] we don't want to be taped together we
[1:40:05] want to be baptized together if we're
[1:40:07] only Eagle taped together we will bust
[1:40:10] apart but if we're baptized into the
[1:40:13] same body by the Holy Ghost you won't
[1:40:15] get us apart brother
[1:40:17] in whom all the building fitly framed
[1:40:21] fitly framed together grow us what a
[1:40:25] peculiar building this is
[1:40:28] so we can say it that the two befores
[1:40:30] are ten foot where they need to be 10
[1:40:32] foot and 12 foot where they need to be
[1:40:34] 12. and eight well they need to be eight
[1:40:36] and you put them all together and you
[1:40:38] put them on there's eight foot there's
[1:40:40] ten foot there's 12 foot there's
[1:40:41] fourteen there's two by tens two by
[1:40:42] twelves two before there's three quarter
[1:40:44] of an inch and a half and note you look
[1:40:46] at and say wow that building them in the
[1:40:49] walls was eight foot now they've grown
[1:40:51] that was ten foot now they growed and
[1:40:53] they're almost 12 foot they've all grown
[1:40:55] how in the world can these building grow
[1:40:57] well that's the because the master
[1:40:59] Carpenter pulled it together to make it
[1:41:02] where that they would have stretchable
[1:41:03] material
[1:41:05] oh oh hallelujah it's fitly framed
[1:41:09] together so it's the framework of a
[1:41:12] building and the materials accurately
[1:41:15] and carefully cut
[1:41:20] now I've been working around some of
[1:41:22] these brothers around here that's been
[1:41:24] building
[1:41:27] and uh they kind of developed a little
[1:41:29] phrase
[1:41:31] whenever we was doing some building
[1:41:34] and some modifying
[1:41:36] so if they couldn't get in touch with me
[1:41:39] or they was just uncertain about
[1:41:42] something
[1:41:43] they developed this phrase
[1:41:46] that they would ask for forgiveness
[1:41:49] instead of asking for permission
[1:41:54] well some of the things they asked
[1:41:56] forgiveness for
[1:41:58] I made them redo it anyway
[1:42:03] because I had something in my mind
[1:42:07] something that I wanted it to look like
[1:42:10] Oh Brother Tony be okay with it and I
[1:42:12] come in and say
[1:42:13] oh cry
[1:42:16] okay I did that cross
[1:42:18] I looked at that cross other down said
[1:42:20] brother Dave
[1:42:21] the cross is too low
[1:42:23] they said really
[1:42:25] I I believe that's what it needs to go
[1:42:27] no it's too low
[1:42:30] so we come over yesterday morning
[1:42:32] and took it down you know why it didn't
[1:42:34] match what I thought
[1:42:36] well we wrestle with it and wrestle with
[1:42:38] it and took it off the wall and read it
[1:42:39] on the lights and reboard the stone and
[1:42:41] this and that and the other and then we
[1:42:42] got it up and all three of us and my
[1:42:44] brother Michael and brother jacket four
[1:42:46] of us and we stood back there and
[1:42:47] brother Dave and Brother David looked
[1:42:49] over her brother Michael and said he was
[1:42:51] right it looks better
[1:42:55] now he could ask for forgiveness all day
[1:42:58] long but that wasn't what I wanted I
[1:43:00] wanted it high at the top now you see
[1:43:03] the Lord has this in his mind but what
[1:43:05] we'd ever say you know what I believe it
[1:43:07] looked better if it's over here and
[1:43:08] somebody else said no that don't look
[1:43:10] right it needs to be over here and then
[1:43:12] somebody else said why you're both wrong
[1:43:14] it needs to be right there I'm so glad
[1:43:16] we've got one absolute about what the
[1:43:18] Lord wants I wasn't called to tell you
[1:43:20] what I think we need to change it this
[1:43:22] way I think the Lord started his church
[1:43:25] the way he wanted it and I believe he'll
[1:43:28] finish it the way he started it I don't
[1:43:31] think he started it out wrong well I
[1:43:33] know some of the message people don't
[1:43:34] like it because it's built on an
[1:43:35] Apostolic Foundation but I happen to
[1:43:37] love it because that's the way he
[1:43:39] started it and I'll tell you one thing
[1:43:41] if he wanted to start it out on playing
[1:43:42] tapes only going to church I figure he
[1:43:44] could have done that 2 000 years ago so
[1:43:46] if he started it out with preachers
[1:43:48] filled with the Holy Ghost casting out
[1:43:50] Devils Healing The Sick and preaching
[1:43:51] the gospel I don't figure he's going to
[1:43:53] close it down fruits are shutting down
[1:43:55] and push and play
[1:43:57] well come on now oh no he started with
[1:44:00] men filled with the Holy Ghost speaking
[1:44:02] The Word of Life laying hands on people
[1:44:05] that is the apostolic way of receiving
[1:44:08] the holy ghost that man called of God
[1:44:10] born of the spirit of God lay hands on
[1:44:13] those and that is imparting eternal life
[1:44:17] Hallelujah why because it is the same
[1:44:19] Lord Jesus and another body doing his
[1:44:22] same work that he's always done
[1:44:26] to be continued
[1:44:32] oh praise the Lord
[1:44:36] is it any Wonder
[1:44:38] that Satan wants to do everything he can
[1:44:41] to divide us and separate us
[1:44:45] might breaks my heart when I think about
[1:44:47] down in every age
[1:44:50] what he's done how he's divided the
[1:44:52] people with doctrines and opinions and
[1:44:55] theology about this and that and the
[1:44:57] other and these people take this side
[1:44:59] with this Doctrine and won't speak to
[1:45:01] these people and this one take this side
[1:45:03] and won't speak and yet going to heaven
[1:45:04] and we can't even speak to one another
[1:45:06] on Earth
[1:45:07] what are we going to do y'all going to
[1:45:08] walk walk down the street and meet that
[1:45:10] person from that other church I ain't
[1:45:11] walking down that street I'll do one
[1:45:13] thing right now I ain't gonna do it
[1:45:17] you got that attitude you won't be there
[1:45:19] and if they got that attitude about you
[1:45:21] they won't be there neither
[1:45:23] come on children
[1:45:25] don't you see why Satan wants to divide
[1:45:27] us can't you see why why he wants us to
[1:45:30] have hard feelings and our heart against
[1:45:31] this one and that one the other one to
[1:45:33] go to church with Even in our own family
[1:45:35] and you know as well as I do it don't
[1:45:37] take 57 members of a family to get all
[1:45:39] 57 out of sync all it takes is one
[1:45:43] all it takes is one member of a family
[1:45:45] getting out of harmony with with the
[1:45:46] rest of the family and they can cause
[1:45:48] more trouble than 50 people can try to
[1:45:50] fix
[1:45:51] well praise the Lord Brother the only
[1:45:53] person it's the truth Satan knows how to
[1:45:56] do this but I'm going to go ahead and
[1:45:57] tell him and tell you Satan you are
[1:46:01] defeated
[1:46:03] he's tried for 2 000 years to destroy
[1:46:06] this house of God
[1:46:08] he will never do it he burned him he fed
[1:46:12] him to Lions he crucified him he divided
[1:46:15] him by denominations God sent a prophet
[1:46:17] and he's divided this message all down
[1:46:20] through the time he's done exactly the
[1:46:21] same thing but he never has or never
[1:46:24] will stop the work of the Living God
[1:46:27] because our God is greater our God is
[1:46:31] bigger our God is stronger amen
[1:46:34] forgiveness and love is Mercy is bigger
[1:46:37] than the devil's contention and Discord
[1:46:41] amen how many beliefs how many beliefs
[1:46:44] God will have a people around the world
[1:46:47] that will fulfill his word all hell will
[1:46:51] never stop it
[1:46:57] oh praise the Lord
[1:47:00] that thing go off

[1:47:26] place to come God has a reason for us

[1:48:27] need you
[1:48:28] each of us pooling pulling together for
[1:48:32] the purpose of God
[1:48:33] to see what God is going to do
[1:48:36] oh praise the Lord
[1:48:39] Heavenly Father
[1:48:42] we think it's a not for your word Lord
[1:48:45] we ask you Lord Jesus that you would
[1:48:47] help us
[1:48:50] father what a
[1:48:52] what a thing we have before us tonight
[1:48:55] to see your great program that has
[1:48:58] unfolded since the dawn of time
[1:49:01] to see what you had in your mind before
[1:49:03] the world began
[1:49:06] Satan no doubt thought he had messed it
[1:49:08] up for good in the Garden of Eden
[1:49:12] he thought when he got Abraham down into
[1:49:14] the land of Egypt you turn your back on
[1:49:17] him
[1:49:18] salt money got Moses
[1:49:20] you'd forsake Him
[1:49:23] every turn of the journey the failures
[1:49:25] of men
[1:49:26] never overrode the sovereignty of God
[1:49:29] but vice versa
[1:49:31] we're so thankful that you allowed that
[1:49:34] clause in your Covenant
[1:49:38] for your sovereignty
[1:49:40] you knew it would be necessary from time
[1:49:43] to time to intervene
[1:49:45] I think Lord of our Prophet messenger
[1:49:48] himself
[1:49:49] pull his gloves off after the death of
[1:49:52] his wife and daughter
[1:49:53] couldn't stand life no more
[1:49:57] pulled his gloves off on the power line
[1:49:59] up the power pole going to put his hands
[1:50:01] on those wires
[1:50:03] and take his own life
[1:50:06] but the mercy of God the sovereignty of
[1:50:09] God overrode his human weakness thank
[1:50:13] you Father
[1:50:14] thank you Father
[1:50:16] when he was going to take his life again
[1:50:18] the sovereignty of God no doubt there's
[1:50:21] people standing here tonight
[1:50:23] if your Sovereign Grace had not
[1:50:25] intervened they wouldn't even be here
[1:50:27] tonight
[1:50:28] oh God we believe we are called for a
[1:50:31] purpose
[1:50:32] and all hell cannot stop that purpose
[1:50:37] father may you help each of us that we
[1:50:40] can find our place I believe with all of
[1:50:42] my heart and many of them have
[1:50:44] but we know once we find it like the
[1:50:47] children of Israel they fought for years
[1:50:48] to get their position
[1:50:50] then after they finally gained the
[1:50:52] ground that they were able to reach in
[1:50:54] that day then they had to change their
[1:50:57] mindset
[1:50:58] and they had to fight to keep what they
[1:51:01] already fought to get
[1:51:03] so many of us Lord we may find ourselves
[1:51:06] finding to keep something that we think
[1:51:08] my goodness overcome that years ago why
[1:51:10] in the world am I here again
[1:51:12] because now we're defending what is
[1:51:15] already ours
[1:51:16] and Satan trying to bring depression or
[1:51:19] sadness or maybe some besetting sin back
[1:51:22] on people's lives that they were
[1:51:24] delivered from years ago it's nothing
[1:51:27] but him we know when the children of
[1:51:29] Israel conquered the land in Palestine
[1:51:31] South first and then they begin to move
[1:51:33] northward
[1:51:34] and by the time they moved northward
[1:51:36] took them years to be able to take it
[1:51:39] all and by the time they come back
[1:51:41] whenever Caleb come to receive his
[1:51:44] Mountain
[1:51:45] they had run the Giants out of that land
[1:51:48] but after years they moved back in
[1:51:51] and what did Caleb find them Giants had
[1:51:54] moved right back into that same land now
[1:51:57] he's confronted with some of the same
[1:52:00] things that they dealt with years before
[1:52:03] but he said give me my mountain
[1:52:07] Lord God I pray in the name of Jesus
[1:52:09] you'd help each of us tonight
[1:52:12] father maybe that mountain is peace
[1:52:14] maybe that mountain is healing over a
[1:52:16] disease
[1:52:18] maybe it's a sister going through the
[1:52:19] change of life
[1:52:21] some days she don't even know who she is
[1:52:24] someday she struggles even with her
[1:52:26] sanity
[1:52:27] but father God in the name of Jesus I
[1:52:31] pray you'd give my sisters that claim
[1:52:34] Lord is Carol and I run into a sister
[1:52:36] the other day
[1:52:38] that dealt was coveted and lost a bunch
[1:52:41] of her hair
[1:52:42] and as we talked to her there in the
[1:52:44] store and the tears trickling out of her
[1:52:46] eyes down her cheeks
[1:52:48] because
[1:52:49] of losing her hair
[1:52:51] father I pray not only for her tonight
[1:52:53] but every other one and you know I
[1:52:56] prayed for many of them after dealing
[1:52:57] with covet in the name of Jesus I resent
[1:53:00] that devil attacking our sisters even
[1:53:02] some of our brothers Satan leave them in
[1:53:06] Jesus name

[1:53:28] the sister of Sandy Edwards
[1:53:31] has been coming for quite some time now
[1:53:34] with Keith and she told me she was
[1:53:36] baptized when she was five years old but
[1:53:37] there's a lot of things she saw around
[1:53:39] her life
[1:53:41] that that was happening that made a
[1:53:43] really question if she was if it was
[1:53:45] even real if it even worked if it would
[1:53:47] even the right way to do it and
[1:53:50] she's been coming and she came in here
[1:53:52] Sunday and she said well brother Donnie
[1:53:53] was was preaching she said it was just
[1:53:56] like it was just her and him
[1:53:58] Lord speaking and I told her I said this
[1:54:00] is the great thing about God you can
[1:54:02] have 500 people in here hear the same
[1:54:04] sermon and God will speak to 500
[1:54:06] different needs
[1:54:07] that's just the way he is
[1:54:09] you know I was standing outside talking
[1:54:12] to her and you know and I explained to
[1:54:13] her I said you know you don't we can't
[1:54:15] search for God
[1:54:17] we have we don't have God is
[1:54:18] unsearchable we don't have that ability
[1:54:20] but it's God that finds us
[1:54:22] it was my purpose that God later here
[1:54:25] was my purpose that God spoke to her and
[1:54:28] she came down and she told Brother she
[1:54:29] said I want to get baptized as soon as
[1:54:31] possible
[1:54:32] so that's where we're at today so if
[1:54:34] you'll pray with me we'll pray for
[1:54:35] sister Sandy that when she comes up that
[1:54:37] God will fill her with the spirit of the
[1:54:40] Holy Ghost let us pray

[1:54:46] truth and the life

[1:54:50] to you except through that way Lord
[1:54:53] but we know father that the prophet said
[1:54:56] when that is calling to us if that's not
[1:54:59] there we would never hear it

[1:55:03] was something in in inside of her Lord
[1:55:05] would you call her name but she
