[Music] [Applause] [Music] amen are you feeling all right you feeling nervous yeah well we're in the same boat hey man praise the Lord and you know I've said this before and it's nothing new but I always come out with my wife is singing because that's my queen and every Queen deserves the audience of her King amen so if you have a rule if you have a real queen brother didn't give her audience every now and again let her know who she is for you amen that was free that wasn't in my notes anywhere that's to get you loving your wife like you should we gettin started intro we getting in trouble real early amen if you have your adoption papers let's turn to Nehemiah - yeah you heard that right that's your adoption papers your Bible no I don't want you to take my coat I paid good money for this I want everybody to see it I won't get full value out of it brother whoa come on now DMI - and then revelations 12 near my - 17 Amen you love the Lord how many has a need today now I I can't meet and speak to all those needs but he can he can near my - 17 says then said I unto them you see the distress that we are in how Jerusalem lieth waste and the gates thereof are burned with fire come let us build up the wall of jerusalem that wiii be no more a reproach verse 18 then i told them at the of the hand of my lord which was good upon me and also the king's words that he had spoken unto me and they said let us rise up and build so they strengthened their hands for this good work they heard the word and they began to do something about what they heard they didn't wait for the man of God to do all the work since they strengthened their hands for this good work revelations 12 and 11 and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death let us bow our hearts and heads to him Heavenly Father we counted an honor a privilege to stand before your purchased people and I'm reminded now and hear the prophet speak and say that if he had a charger of the literal blood of Jesus Christ the purchase of that blood has more value than the blood itself so lord I stand humble I stand quiet and Lord that's how I come before you today that's how I come before the people of God and I saw hundreds of hands lifted up this morning saying that there were needs and there would be no way that I could speak and meet or do anything about them other than you would come and speak the words of life unto us O God may you be the encourage or may you be the uplifter today O God we find ourselves here in your presence and we simply want to submit ourselves and get out of the way father not just me as the minister but as the people as well may they set themselves a sighs maybe the pressures maybe they got a call this morning and it's disturbed them it's rattled them it's left them unsettled and they're not certain what they're going to do but the one who can do is on the scene so may you have the preeminence in your place rightfully in this service and it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may have your seats I always find inspiration from this when I'm ministering the Prophet says and by the way I forgot my I've lost them somewhere I don't know where they are my my reading glasses and you would think with having two pair of contacts I'd be able to see but I'm past forty hey man hey man I wonder oftentimes what the people when I was growing up wearing glasses they call you four-eyes and I wonder what they call me now that have eight but in the message here you him way back in 1956 way back in 1956 that were still truth that's what people out on the internet don't I know y'all don't believe that stuff but he says we must be inspired by the Word of God that will bring Christ to his word we must be inspired so you come today and you have to be inspired by the Word of God and that inspiration of that word will bring Christ to his word so if you're not inspired today Christ is not coming to you you take it up with the Prophet and back in 1956 but we must be inspired by the Word of God that will bring Christ to his word and blend them together so you have a part to play in the service today whatever you get out of this service is up to you because he's waiting on you to be inspired and quite frankly I don't know of any other way to preach but under inspiration so I believe that he's gonna come to me because I'm inspired by the word and he will come to you if you become inspired by the word we must be inspired by the Word of God that will bring Christ that's powerful inspiration is what brings him to his word but I thought his words were life his words are life but there has to be some inspiration and then blend them together and make it speak and act just like it did in the days of old did you catch that Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever so the way that God acted in the Old Testament he can act here today in 2019 is that Alright so therefore if he's gonna act and do that he's gonna make you do like some of those other people did I'm reminded of a group of people that gathered in the upper room one day and they came out in an inspiration under the influence of their inspiration they didn't sound like they sounded when they went in because they went in odd they went in afraid they were uncertain but when they came out they had a new life on the inside of them they had a new way of walking they had a new way of talking they had confidence so I implore you today get under the inspiration of this word because we are fixing to take a body change we're fixing to get out of here now I need to start acting like I'm already changed you need to start acting like you're already in your new body hah that's not in my notes that's just something I read before I preach because I like that quote because I want the people to be inspired not by me not by brother Donnie not by any other men of God but be inspired by the Word of God because this word is life hey men blessed assurance Jesus the word is mine now when you have possession of something you can have confidence that little ladies stand up you're singing while ago is mine I know y'all love it but not like I love her huh those little knucklehead kids of mine I love them I know you do too but not like I do because they're mine huh it's Jesus yours today what are you gonna do for him today how are you gonna show the world that he is yours I'm only here a second Peter says to stir up your Mount your pure Minds by way of remembrance so things that you're here today that you will hear today out of this mouth will be things that you've heard before I'm only trying to stir up up your heart and quite frankly only a your heart can be stirred so if you don't have a pure heart I expect you to just look at me today I expect you to just sit and look some of you even be kind and give me this huh but a pure heart I'm gonna hear your heart say hey man I wanna hear your heart say sick and boy huh a pure heart by way of remembrance because when you get attached to something that you remember there's an identity with that that begins to stir something within you because when you hear something new you little crosses oh no I don't have anything new to give to you the only thing I want you to see today is Jesus Christ and my guarantee today I'll do this usually wherever I go I tell people that when you buy something you always want to guarantee you will look that thing over and you will inspect it what kind of warranty doesn't have what kind of guarantee huh so I guarantee you you're gonna hear things you've heard before I guarantee you gonna hear me say something I didn't probably mean the same because I'm human hello huh but I guarantee you if you look close enough if you tuned in your ear hard enough you will see and hear Jesus Christ that's my guarantee and with that I'll say this in closing I'm gonna take care of that now is that all right preachers lie all the time but I want to take our thoughts today and just go through a little bit of inspiration how the Lord dealt with me on this I don't even know how it's gonna come out because this is this is new to me but building among the rubble now it's been some time since this thought began to pulsate within me and the Lord begin to direct me this way and I never could quite formulate it I'm still working on this y'all y'all bear with me that all right because quite frankly I'm among people that know me and you know I think about that song you probably heard I want to go to church you know with a preacher and and and and it talks about you know among people that see me at my worst y'all know me huh that's right but as the Lord began to deal with me on this I began to realize that there are people sitting here today their life is in ruins and nobody knows it your spouse may not even know the hell that you're dealing with mom and daddy may not know it but today is your data rebuilds your walls now I can say that with confidence because I was once trapped in that condition coming to church discouraged singing my songs y'all see me standing right up here singing praise God brother joy building among the ruins Jerusalem that word means peace so they were building back the walls of peace so there's chaos there's hail broke forth in your life it's time to rebuild peace the Spirit of the Lord is letting you know that you have the ability to rebuild that peace the walls of the city they were in ruins and to the natural eye it was just rubble huh and from the stories told by those who had seen the destruction there was no way anything of value could be salvaged there was complete ruination people looking at your life maybe you're thinking of someone right now you think there's no hope for that person get Jesus Christ in your pocket huh so many times we've written people off hmm we'd find ourselves trapped in that mindset where we won't even call them sister or brother hello don't he want to sit beside them on the Pew because to our natural either life is just rubble but there's a soul in that body there's an opportunity for God to move in that person's life and what have you done you've written him off and still saying that I'm of Jesus Christ that I'm a Christian how many people did you know that Jesus Christ wrote off I can find in the Bible where he went and traveled many miles just for one now I don't like getting on airplanes I hate flying I hate it but I don't care where I have to go what I have to do if I can be an inspiration to just one person because as you see my inspiration has come from the fact that I know that people are sitting in churches and there are dying and nobody around them is doing anything about it they know what's going on in their lives they sometimes they know the chaos that's breaking forth in their lives and they won't even call them because I don't want him to think I'm being nosy [Music] be Jesus Christ be loved that's a simple unction that I fall under inspiration of is simply be Jesus Christ simply be love to those who I don't care what they look like I don't care what they smell like I don't care what they've done to you I don't care what they're doing to you now I don't care what they're going to do to you but if you would be love to that person that you would be fulfilling more of the purpose of what Jesus Christ wants done in this age then you rallying around your pet quote then you hold it so fervently on to that doctrine and you hold it on that thing is going to send you to hell because you missed an opportunity to be like Jesus oh I heard you sing that song I saw you close your eyes and look at all sanctimonious tears trickling down your cheeks but then you've written that person off hello but the homeowner Longoria is this all right can we go off brother Terry did you hear what I just say brother Don are you sorry outfit [Applause] Nehemiah 1:4 says and it came to pass when I heard these words that I sat down and I whipped and lorn certain days and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven because my brother is in trouble his walls his defense is crumbling my sister is in trouble and I sat down and I wept and I cried before the God of heaven their peace is gone their Jerusalem Nehemiah he hears the reporting becomes concern about the ruins or the current condition of the means of protection did you catch that he hears the report and he becomes concern about the ruins he becomes concern about the current condition of the means of protection the walls are down there is access to the temple because if you look at it chronologically in the scriptures it's it's Ezra Nehemiah Esther but it's actually as rrah Esther Ezra the Nehemiah because the temple is is we found out the temple it was was rebuilt in Ezra so the the there is access to the temple now I've come across this old quote when I was looking at some of these things and it says the more economically and culturally developed a city is the greater the value of things in the city thus the greater the need for the wall so there's a great value that's in a soul that's in a body and the devil knows that sister there's great value in you the devil knows that huh that's why he's tempting you brother too to go untrue to your virtue now we hear so much about the women keeping their virtue there's a virtue to be had a new young man there's a virtue to be kept in you you to keep that virtue as well the Spirit of the Lord told the Prophet don't smoke don't drink or defile your body and I often thought if that's one quote that everybody should keep it's that one huh running around oh wow Josiah here I go maybe somebody back here behind this stuff Oh No maybe brother Donnie has some people hiding out back here ah maybe the piano let's go see not under there I don't see anybody back here so I guess this is for you [Applause] huh because the walls have crumbled the walls have fallen and other people are in harm's way did you know that you cannot one person somebody out of their healing out of their salvation because of the condition of the walls in your life it's time to rebuild the wall Saints now the walls of your life can never be rebuilt unless you are first concerned about their condition running b-bomb okay okay what I do don't pray for me well I'm going to there's no hope for me oh yes there is because I know Jesus Christ I may not be able to do anything for you but he can now I know this is simple and as I've come to say my simple understanding of this walk with the Lord is simply going to get me out of here one day take and compare what you are now listen to me take and compare what you are now to what you could be under God or take and compare what you are now to what you used to be I know I'm speaking to three groups of people today the believer the unbeliever in the make believer so I know this fits you somewhere because I know for myself I could have been further along in him huh we so often we hear the statement that maybe we've even said it before I became a Christian 40 years ago I became a Christian 10 years ago I became a Christian let me ask you a question what have you become since you became if you became something then you should be continuing to become that very thing that you said you became huh is that real was that a simple enough question resurrection of Lazarus because we find out that that that would Nehemiah here this this this crying that he did this weeping this wailing it wasn't some little dried confession you know the resurrection alas was the prophet says and today brother Tim talking last night he didn't read a quote will I'll fill in for you brother Tim I'll take care of that today for you buddy and today they talked taking the Holy Ghost put a wafer under your tongue or shake hands with the minister oh brother the Prophet says I'm sick and tired of that old dry eyed confession there's no more to it then there is like a fellow trying to get a drink of water out of an old dry rag somewhere that's right what we need today is a good fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost come down and stir up the people again that's what we need today is a good fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost he's up in Erie Pennsylvania and he says I was watching your Lake out there the other day when I went down there it was having a big revival now if a body of water can have a revival under the inspiration of the wind of God then you tell me what you can have you tell me what I can have that we're just two jumping and bouncing in a jumping I said there's no more water in it when it's smooth but it's got a revival that's what we need today the wind blowing on us kinda shaking you up a little bit just a little bit of wind kind of shaking you up getting you out of your comfort zone and everywhere I'll preach I know that there's cute folk everywhere it's cute folk and Happy Valley I know you I've set beside some of you you say you usually set beside your wife with you I didn't say beautiful I say cute she's beautiful I'm gonna be getting trouble but the inner veil he says there's a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof is the ways of death it might seem alright intellectually your soul will always testified to the Word of God if it's born again down in my soul cries holy Oh down in my soul cries holy there's something on the inside it just can't you can't contain it so that's why I worry about the cute folk that come to church you never see them move you never see them waving Eraserhead you never see them do anything but sit there and look like a bump on a pickle your song says I know I've been changed ah no I've been changed ah no I've been changed because the Alpha and Omega done sign my name you can't help but let it come out you can't help but express it let me get along if you got an intellectual faith oh you'll agree sure say that Bibles right intellectual faith will agree with that the devil says the same thing so is he your brother or your adversary if you're saying the same thing is the devil devil say the same thing as you get a new language about you if you got an intellectual faith the Bible's right the devil says the same thing the devil says there's a God in heaven there's a Jesus cry the devil says this certainly they believe the same thing oh you say the devil believe in Jesus Christ certainly they publicly confess him said thou art the Son of God thou art the Christ the Holy One why do you come to torment us before our time comes certainly they publicly confessed him to be the Son of God publicly the devil you see these musicians going to these award shows and everything in you you'll find out that there's they're beginning to join forces the Christian so-called artists are beginning to join forces with the worldly secular musical artists now this may not mean anything to some of you but some some it will capture your attention Kanye West he's been having Sunday morning services saying he's a Christian that's what he says so I say okay but where's the change where's the identification and ministers with a shallow experience and with the bogus religion ministers go out and have people to make such a dry-out confession as that and go back out in the world and live like the world and claim that they're Christians now if you're going back out into the world doing let the world does you're not a Christian you didn't have an experience I implore you I invite you to come to an altar today you cute folk don't like the altar from that time that's about the way serving the Lord you know you've got to put your heart in it high you've got to be sincere you've got to meet God not go to church and make some cold dry out confession go down there and stay down there you've got to meet Jesus Christ there's no way that you can encounter Jesus Christ and never ever ever be the same because there's something about that atmosphere that environment brother Tim was talking about last night and the Prophet said I was thinking about this as he was mentioning the Prophet said whatever environment you are in that's what you are watch your friends young people since watch that little boy that's got his eye on you young men around the message defiling message girls young message girls defiling young message boys what's wrong what's wrong come on in brother I'm home I'm here [Applause] message de grâce joining church will never cover sin joining church will never cover sin coming to Happy Valley saying this is your home church will never cover sin no dry convention will ever cover sin no dry confession because of birth as we know is a mess [Applause] now grew up out in the country I grew up in a hollow holler for some of you folk we still refer to their own places the holler you going out in the Halloween but not in the holler down the line but I seen a few pigs born in my day it's nasty it's messy is that Alright he said well you look good in your suit I didn't think you were a country boy yeah grew up no running water in the house come on ma huh Toton and fetching water getting in the old number 11 I think it was bathtub to take a bath and I'm the youngest of six so I wasn't too clean when I got out of that water no dry a confession will never cover sin it takes sorrow and repentance and the grace of God that covers sin for the blood of Jesus Christ the one that God killed at Calvary to cover sin God killed his own son for you when nothing else could help love lifted me the son he bled and died is that right we're familiar with and know the message the Prophet preached convinced then concern listen to Nehemiah as he prays the mi 141 verse 1 a chapter 1 verse 4 if you want to read with me Nehemiah 1 okay everybody see my coat right looks good alright y'all know I'm not vain I'm just pretending I'm just playing but it's kind of sort of good to get value out of something you bought you know you don't want to just anybody see it huh but watch Nehemiah as he begins to brave begins to get concerned verse one diverted up chapter 1 verse 4 and it came to pass when I heard these words that I sat down and wept and more in certain days and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven fasting you don't hear that word much anymore I digress verse 5 and said I beseech thee O Lord God of heaven the great and terrible God that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his Commandments let 9 here now be attentive in thine eyes upon that open that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant which I pray before the noun day and night for the children of Israel thy servants and confess the sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned against thee both I and my father's house have sinned he was covering everybody he was making sure that the entire church was covered verse 7 he says we have dealt very correctly against the we-we-we we have dealt very correctly against thee and have not kept the commandments nor the statutes nor the judgments with south commend us I serve as Moses remember verse 8 I beseech thee the word that thou commandest thy servant Moses saying if you transgress I will scatter you abroad among the nations that's God's word you transgress there will be a scattering your walls will crumble huh but if you turn onto me and keep my Commandments and do them though there were of you cast out until the uttermost part of the heaven yet will I gather them from thence and I believe that's what God is doing today he through this message of beginning to gather those who have been scattered he's beginning to gather those who are broken down who are so weary they can't think that they're going to make another step maybe you haven't been to church in a long time today is your day huh though that were you cast out on the other most part they haven't yet will I get from thence and we'll bring them unto the place that I've chosen to set my name I'm trying to hurry versed here now these are thy servants and not people whom thou has to redeem by that great power and and by thy strong hand he didn't write them off no doubt there was somebody in that group that nehemiah was praying for that didn't he am i wrong at some point in his life because these were people too they bled just like you bleed they wake up in the morning their hair is all over their head just like you they got these little track marks down the side of the cheek okay cute folk I know you don't wake up with your hair all did and everything all great I [Applause] know you now these are my servants and these are your people Lord they're in trouble these walls in their lives are down and that that's or the pulsation that begin to begin to burn within me God there are people that are coming to church and they're hurting and people are just walking by them out in the vestibule hello how many cute folk we got here today okay verse 11 o Lord I beseech thee let not thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name and prosper I pray thee and I serve in this day and granting him mercy in the sight of this man for I was the king's cup bearer he begins to go in prayer and he's seeking wisdom on what he's to do and he's also praying over the people because he become concerned then there was a confession and then he's making a commitment you're looking at me today I want you concerned about the condition of your life young man brother and sister I want you concerned about the condition that you're in because we're about to leave this place Jesus is coming soon is that Alright I want you concerned and then I want you to make a confession not a dryad confession and then I want you to make a commitment that's what the sphere of the Lord is telling me to tell you today become concerned make a confession make a commitment you'll rise up and you say brother Joel I will rebuild praise God I'm there shouting with you but you have to realize that as soon as those words come out of your mouth I will rebuild Satan is there saying I will oppose aah [Applause] what are you gonna do about that you're gonna stay in your condition you're gonna stay in your struggle or you're gonna say boo devil I will rebuild near my to ten says when semble at the horror night and Tobiah the servant the ammonite you gotta watch those i'ts when they heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel any time you go to do and wanting to do good there's gonna be some i'ts to rise up now that I is an enemy of God it may be outward or sometimes the eye tis this thing right here all your cute folk now huh the flesh will rise up and say you said you will rebuild but I'm gonna oppose you because you know that scar that's got you trapped in as I've come to say we get stuck on stupid so many times maybe it was an abuse or an offence in your life and you get stuck on that very thing you are greater than the trial there's something on the inside of you that's greater than that thing that's trapped you you're getting stuck on stupid you're getting stuck on flesh this flesh you cannot bring before God I'm getting ahead of myself this fourth of our position comes forth from within and without it is a resistance against the work that God is doing in your life the trial comes to shake you listen the trial comes to shake you to put you to the very bottom to see where and how you will stand what do you do when you've done all you can seems like you can't make it through huh and the song goes on to say you just stand when there's nothing left to do you just stand and watch the Lord see you through yes after you've done all you can you just complain no that's the wrong song turn the station that's the wrong station we listen to gospel music around here not down in defeat station or at least I hope you do huh whether it be southern gospel whole LA y'all forgive me it's good to ah I just had to make you feel good but it is a resistance against God's work the trial comes to shake you to see where you're gonna stand in how but we only have to go through the Prophet says we only have to go through these schools of sufferings to know how the other fellow feels so sometimes when you're in that Valley when you're low and you're saying why me Lord think about that quote right there sometimes he lets us go through these schools of hard knocks so we will know how that other brother that you wrote off oh yeah there he is again the one that you wrote off and you said wasn't gonna make it wasn't worth anything now you know how he feels now you know how she feels when all is well in your home and nobody's died oh that's sad oh wait then it comes your house because in fact that's where he's picking up on that quote someone had passed away and he girls refer about his dad passing away and he says sometimes we go through these things so we'll know how the other person feels cuz God he's building his church out of material which he made I got a hurry he will use these things to fulfill his purpose therefore the reason that's the reason why we go through these things you're in the midst of this Saints you're in the midst of this brother/sister you're going through this very thing right now to serve the purpose of God he's working a work in you that's gonna be glorious is gonna be beautiful hmm these experiences they build our character and mold our image the mistake listen the mistake is not to define who you are see that's how the devil would twist things he will get you to make a decision he will get you to do something that you should not have done huh and then he'll make you pay for it and then he will trap you in that mental condition and make you think that that's all that you will ever be but you're more than that you've been bought with a price maybe you didn't know that but I'm here to let you know you have been bought with a price you say me brother Joel yes you but you don't know what I did I don't need to know what you did all that you need to know is what he did for you Nehemiah chapter 3 i'ma run through this real quick we found out the rebuilding begins that's what and we and we thing that that's amazing to me about Nehemiah 3 is how it starts out turn with me named Nehemiah 3 and 1 the rebuilding begins the reconstruction of the defense's starts and the breaches are closed up the holes the gaps and the Elijah of the high priest rose up with his brethren the priest and they builded the sheep gate so they start at the Sheep gate no maybe sometimes I'll have time nehemiah's gates and all there's some beautiful types all throughout and then maybe you've studied it before but but it won't have time to get into all of it and I just want to focus on that one just just for a moment in in verse 1 the Sheep gate now the Sheep gate was the gate through which the Sheep who that were used for sacrificed or brought into the city and route to the temple and that's a perfect place to start a sheep a sacrifice so blood Jesus Christ is the best place to start you say ah brother Donny was here I talk to brother Donny after sir you'll need to talk to brother die that may be good and fine if that will help do that but talk to Jesus Christ so that began building at the Sheep gate sacrifice blood Christ that's where you start and there are other gates that we could get into but but we we just don't have time and we're just going through them Oh we'll just we'll just keep going but the Sheep gate find Jesus Christ today Saints said well jewel why you saying that isn't that who we are isn't that what we're supposed to be doing in that what we're supposed to be saying the mysteries of great the seven seals of thunders and all that all that's wonderful is great it identifies Who I am but if I miss Jesus Christ I missed it all you said well tell me something supernatural jewel said I mean I will thank you the supernatural in you should speak louder than the natural that's super that's powerful because that supernatural that's in you will empower you to do what you cannot do because see when I was in my condition of my falling crumbled walls and I've shared this with you before maybe you forgot I'll tell you again cuz this is wonderful it's become more of Who I am but I'm sitting back before it here in the church before service just praying just pondering over the service discouraged down and I heard the sphere of the Lord speak to me and said the you that was you before there was you that's you now you believe what you want and you say what you want but the Lord spoke to me and he was letting me know that this that you've become that's not you you're looking at me today with natural eyes and I'm looking upon you with natural eyes I know that's not the real you and that's what I'm after it doesn't matter what you've done because there's a supernatural nough sinew and it will empower you to do what you cannot do the super Necedah sinew is an attribute of God's thinking military did you hear what I just said the supernatural necessity is an attribute of God's thinking he said oh I want to do something for Jesus Christ but become that suprem naturalness greater than Solomon he says when his program was laid out the whole thing you were recognized in that program when he began to lay out his program the Prophet says you were recognized in that program because you got eternal life I'm not talking to the cute folk cuz they don't realize that they have it but you that do know you should be swinging from his chandeliers because you got eternal life the word eternal never did begin and never can it never can it in you are an attribute of God's thinking before the world was ever created many times we think about attributes we think about healing all of these things but you are an express attribute of God's thinking and that life that's the only way you can have eternal life and that life that he was thinking of you is in you now that life that he was seeking of then it's right in you if we could just realize that the rapture will go how many wants to rapture realize that life that's in Yui has always been in you I'm here to quicken a life quicken a seed to wake us there's no way to separate it it's in there to stay you can't get rid of eternal life no matter how much you sin no matter how much drugs you put in your veins no matter how many women you sleep with no matter how many men you sleep but you cannot hide eternal life the devil tries to make you think because of what you did and what you said he wants to trap you in that but I'm here to let you know today that there's eternal life inside of you you can't get away from it the devil's got you trapped he's trying to make you think that that's all that you will ever become hear me building among the rubble you look around your life there's no way I can do this with Nehemiah what to survey the the the ruins there was no place even that he could cross over you're trapped in that condition and you think there's no way out sometimes you have to start building from within I want to go back in the scripture to be able what was the first thing he did when revelation of the light struck his path yeah what was the first thing that he did he went looking for blood when revelation struck that boy's path he went on a search for some blood cruelty of sin noticed beautiful time here he comes dragging the little lamb pulling him on what caused him to do that I could imagine the little fellow flake falling probably knew what was near dragging the little feet perfect type of Christ dragging the cross beautiful God's lamb coming down through Jerusalem falling weak Here Come the little fellow bleeding along and when he got him up to the great rock laid him upon the rock taking a piece of sharp rock I don't know guess they had no knives in those days laid him the prophet didn't know did you the Prophet didn't know hello internet people we still believe a profit that don't know everything so what if those men didn't fall off the bridge sir he's human I'll let brother Donnie do it then I don't know guess they had no knives in those days laid them like that took him to the back of his head took him by the back of his head and pulled him up like this this is a horrible thing it's ugly it's dirty it's nasty it's a bird who can ready to take place took a wrong and beat it through his throat on that rock died the lamb bleeding bleeding blood splashing his little arteries cut the blood flying all over his little white wool become bathed red with blood God looked down from heaven and said that's it that's it now you got it that's the way the blood spurting from his little veins so can God look down in this service today and look at your life and say that's it that's the blood that I'm looking for so when he when the light first struck his path he went looking for blood and when Cain saw his brother what did he see blood he saw Jesus Christ in the prefigure he saw the coming of the one that was two redeemed he saw that blood and you know what he rejoins he was a praise God that's that New Age Bible that puts everybody in and makes everybody great y'all didn't bring out to this church did you okay you internet whatever camera whether you internet folk when Cain saw his brother what did he see he saw blood and he hated it he hated Jesus Christ he hated the things of God opposition immediately revelation opposition you're sitting here looking at me now our position is I don't believe that well I'm glad you let me know that because this isn't for you because believers believe I thought that was gonna go by me but I couldn't I couldn't let it go ah Abel was covered in the manifestation of his revelation do you hear that how much time I got him have to go rather than convert to God's Way Cain chose to destroy the system of God did you catch that rather they convert he wanted to destroy he did not feel accepted with his evil lifestyle that's where we are in this age now people don't feel comfortable around you and your godliness because of their lifestyle so what are they gonna try to do they're gonna try to kill you they're gonna try to destroy your name your character your influence now if you don't have a life if you don't have a walk that's up to you but we are here to stand against every evil spirit [Music] he did not feel accepted with this evil lifestyle Kane thought if I kill it then I won't have to look at it I won't have to look at what God accepts if I get rid of it I won't have to look at it if I can just get him fired I won't have to be around him opposition they wanted he wanted to kill the light so he could feel good in his darkness that's what this age is doing today they're wanting to snuff out and kill destroy the light so they can feel good in their darkness because evil deeds are done in darkness they want to murder the truth so they can feel good in their life the devil's out to murder you he's out to kill you huh Jesus Christ God has come to call you today he's calling you what is he calling me for what is he calling me to brother Joel he's calling you to the new you he's letting you know today you don't have to stay in that condition you don't have to stay where you are you don't have to be bothered by that little Jezebel girl in the schoolhouse walking down the halls you see her every day and your friends are talking about it look at that look at that you don't want to look but pressure what are you a that devil huh hello this is real veal and it's not so much the you new it's the it's it's it's the original you the first Jew the you that was you before there was you that's you oh I wish hope you get people to see that the you that was you before there was all this chaos before there was all this mess that's who he's coming back for so there has to be a change there has to be a rebirth there has to be something to happen in your life in the message questions and answers he says someone asks the question please explain the mystery of the translation of the Bronte heroes where I might have trouble I can't see it very well I forgot to blow it up make it bigger so I can see it so don't laugh at me I'm just I'm just trying to see please explain the mystery of the translation by the end I always try to work this in because it's real it's just a change to our bodies let's say our you know what I mean when I say that I don't mean to be sacrilegious I don't mean to say ours I don't mean to say this Church I mean to say every believer Abraham he was looking for a promised son that was promised him is that right and the church is looking for a promised son to the bride is that right the bride is looking for the promised son before the promised son could come to Saren Abraham their bodies had to be changed is that right she was too old to have a baby she had no milk veins in her breasts her breasts was dried up her room wasn't fertile she was sterile she could not have the baby her heart was too old to stand labor so what happened God changed her back to a new young woman and he did Abraham the same thing because he said his body was as good as dead see and he had to change that their body in order to receive the promise that he had to change their body in order for them to receive the promised son I know you know this but you're gonna hear it again today because maybe somebody didn't catch it the last time and he cannot receive the promised son that's promised us today in these bodies that we live in these bodies are sin you cannot receive the word in this body so you got to go searching for that you that's really you because the intellectual conception of who you think this is all about you will miss it as far as the East is from the West this for the the the this first conscience controls the body with CJ's feel smelly here and it's just got us all scrupled up see taste feel smell in here and I was hoping that maybe I and my thought was going a different way even looking at just looking at the appearances and the message I preached on that but but anyways see taste feel smelling here to get you all scooped it up with reason and everything else but that that new body that comes from this born-again not this conscience it will pass away it's that inside something that lives everybody understand it's Amen it's not the outside see taste feel smell in here it isn't it's subject to death and will die but the inside part of you hold on Saints but the inside part of you down in here inside that is the person that cannot die and that's the person that the new life starts from that's the person that you that's really you that's the person that this new life starts from from the new birth and it builds another person in the image of this person you are around that life it builds another person around that changed body that changed life so potentially it's in here and what is it the word promise before the foundation of the world and around there this only reflects the negative that will reflect the positive of the word see and the same thing our translation of the bride will be the same thing I've got a new home over in Zion and it's mine the word is what's changing our bodies the words given to us to produce a rapture the word has not given us to us to fight over and bicker over it's given to us to change our very bodies you say I don't believe that it's not for you it's for believers is that right as the book of Nehemiah comes to a close chapter 12 we find the dedication of the walls and the people rejoicing singing they're praising they're shouting huh because there's been a change there's been something to happen they they directed the walls that their city was now protected that the temple was now protected that that value that was on the inside of them there was something that they realized that I got a hold of something that's now gonna hold me because I cannot hold myself there was music and there was great joy there was rejoicing they gave expression to the inward work that was going on inside of them hmm you said brother I'm just a pickle we'll bump on brother I'm more than a pickle I've got eternal life inside of me there is deity in tabernacle in human flesh [Applause] huh chapter 13 we found out even after all that worship there's still some strongholds there's still a few more things that nehemiah has to take care of and Nehemiah he took a firm stand and he declared both in Word and in action he said no not in my house not where I live you're not taking my son hello mama you have to say devil you're not getting my girl you're not getting my grandbaby [Applause] huh cuz there's still some strongholds he resisted the evil Nehemiah thirteen seven we found it and I came to Jerusalem and understood of the evil that Elijah did for Tobias now it Elijah was a priest and he got indeed allied with tobiah now Tobias we knows you know the story was one of the first ones that began to begin - mm poke it poke it in the amaya be that thorn in his flesh so what's the ministry doing hanging out with this one that's I don't know and understood of the evil that he lied she did for Dubai and preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God he drugged him up in the house of God after I put working building this thing I'm gonna allow the devil to come back up am i uh huh I worked hard to build this wall huh allow the devil to come no I don't think so ah and it grieves me sword near mine says therefore I cast forth all the house folds tougher to buy out of the chamber he took everything that that till I had drug in and he kicked it out now let's break old school was that all right he kicked out his stuff he kicked out his TV that's that's that's short for television [Applause] he kicked out all of his old bad websites Harlequin romance brother Joe is my favorite literature that's a lie they lying to you in those books they're lying to you on those websites I better shut up yeah then I commanded and they cleanse the chambers 13 and 9 and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God with the meat offering and the frankincense he's beginning to bring praise he's beginning to bring that new life he's beginning to bring that joy back in there's still some strongholds he needs to get rid of Nehemiah 13 to 23 says in those days also I saw Jews that had married wives of Ashdod of Amon and of Moab strange women hmm now my boys know you will not bring those strange women up in this house I told you I was gonna leave you alone I didn't tell you saying you specifically I got the other two I said my boys and their children speak half in the speech of Ashdod and cannot speak in the Jews language they forgot how to speak boo devil the simple quotes in the message they couldn't even quote them anymore huh because of a strange woman that they drug in and could not speak in the Jews language but according to the language of each people Nehemiah 1325 says and I contended with them now watch what near my does says well that's my baby and you know bring her on to the house I know she looks like Jezebel and bring her on bring him on to the house I know he's here spirit and his lips and his tongue in his big toe it's okay uh-uh not nehemiah and i contended with them and cursed them and smoked certain of them he took care business he began to clean house and this is what he did and I plug off their hair I'm sure there was some women in this group too and made them swear by God saying you shall not give your daughters unto their sons nor take their daughters unto your sons or for yourselves Nehemiah thirteen and twenty eight sets and one of the sons of joy joy joy odda the son of Elijah ship the high priest was son-in-law as some like musicians come with son-in-law dissemble on the horn right therefore I chased him from me if you don't get anything else out of this sermon today chase the devil from you you have the power you have the voice because this is the days of the voice is it not that voice just wasn't crying out through the words or do the body in the mouth of William Mariam Brenham that voice is to be cried out in my life in your life I don't want it to just be stuck in the Prophet I want it to be me I want to become this word and coincidentally I say that so many times the the Malachi 4 actually speaks of you before it even speaks of the Prophet it identifies Yuka because it says behold I send you so the importance of you is great so the Spirit of the Lord is wanting you to chase these things from your life this foremost enemy Semillon he had done more than any other to frustrate the purpose of rebuilding now you know the problem in your life that's frustrating the purpose of you living for Jesus Christ nobody else may know that thing but you know it it's kept you stuck on stupid for years but today is a new day [Music] today is the day of your salvation today is the day of your deliverance there's a song and it says this is a simple song don't go play anybody I know yeah I don't guess but it says Lord deliver me [Music] cuz all I seem to do is hurt me hurt me that's all it says Lord deliver me from me because the theme that you're doing is not hurting anybody but you but you'll find out eventually it's gonna eat out into the church and begin to affect the church you'll knock somebody else out of their healing stand with me building among the rubble do you love him Italy good to us I told you in closing didn't I already taking care of that all right amen God is good to us he's wonderful truly Saints it's time to rid these things out of our lives that's that simple by the jaw I know I know I understand that I believe that but it's things that we need to hold on to things that we need to get ahold of let me say that way things that we need to get ahold of this gonna change our very body because we cannot trust this there's so many people that you say well I can't trust him I can't trust her you can't even trust yourself is that right because you are who you are when you are by yourself can I come in when you're by yourself that's who you really are let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for this time these words this inspiration this little thought and I'm nothing Lord but just simply a spare tire Lord to get the people through into a pastor comes back and as I was streaming hearing brother Andrew and I thought oh my how a Sunday coming I've had to follow that and didn't brother Tim comes last night and or did you know my very heart and I've tried to give can only be me can only simply be what you've called me to be and express it in the way that you've given me unction to expression so I pray that it's found somewhere to settle that they can take it tomorrow and feed upon it and come against the enemy to fight the fight that's before them help us to have the strength to build our walls to defend that that you've started within us Lord we love you we honor you and we adore you and we thank you and it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray the mi4 14 says and I looked and rose up and said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of them remember the Lord don't be afraid of that devil young people remember the Lord o people you remember the Lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren fight for your sons and fight for your daughters fight for your wives fight for your houses stand firm it's time to fight because the enemy is trying to come in to destroy you just as Cain wanted to kill that blood he sees that blood in your life you don't like it he's coming for you but remember the Lord amen where do I go when there's

road where do I go when there's nobody that I can call who do I talk to when nobody won't see [Music] profit tells us that every promise has the same power of creation you've received the promise today in this word of God that you do have the strength to rebuild your wall that you do have the ability and the voice to say boo that's a promise and it has the same power of creation behind it just as the word and the voice said let there be back in Genesis that same power is within you did you catch that so what are you gonna speak today what are you gonna speak tomorrow Tuesday Wednesday
