usually behind that window up there but brother Joe probably a month and a half I might as well quit playing I got a while to go uh brother Joe asked me to open the Service and I just looked I said what you know and I thought you know if you could sing Jesus's face in heaven he said what you know because this ain't me but he asked me to do it and I was talking to brother Andrew Spencer last night and kind of told him he said he said man I gotta tune in just see what's going to happen so so here we are and we'll just go over a few things uh my name's uh Michael Bailey we got brother uh Joe Harrah Joe stand up he's uh 18 and older youth leader we've got brother Rob Weber brother Rob 13 and up and uh any of the visitors home kids you're on your own but any of the visitors if you need

come earlier somebody may be here to open the door around maybe nine or ten something like that uh brother Tony I think has activities for us around 12 30. uh probably volleyball I don't know volleyball tournaments and stuff like that it's always been real real fun service starts at six tomorrow or Saturday uh Sunday service starts at 11 A.M and then after service we'll have another supper lunch for the Youth probably around 1 30. and so after you eat you can stay and play as long as you want just don't stay until nine or ten you've got a five hour drive home or something like that and since we've got a new place here we've got we've come up with some rules that we got to go over and if you know rule number one we're going to have a good time this weekend who knows what rule number one is don't be bashful [Music] obey all rules thank you Mark rule number two this is for you brother Rob make at least one friend before you leave this weekend one new friend and if you make two or three be at Sunday school Sunday morning we'll give you a little gold star if you make more than more than one sister Raley's room rule number three have fun have fun in the Lord and have fun with your brothers and sisters while you're here the Lord has given us this place for a sanctuary from the world this is our safe haven for you for our young people so enjoy it while you're here Rule Number Four leave a better person than you came because you're probably your father your mother your brother and sister will really appreciate that okay [Music] and get something from the Lord that's why we're here okay that's the rules okay this is where it gets fine if you don't care just hold off for a minute I'll let you look at that for a little bit and study it if you've seen this and you know how to figure it out just just be quiet don't say nothing for a while so despite what you're probably thinking those circles are not equal there is one that is a fraction of a size larger than the other I need you to figure that which one it is do we have any people that's left-handed in here they said left-handed people can usually get it right a lot more than right-handed people so is everybody letting quit looking at me look at this see if you got it figured out everybody ready everybody's got to vote if I don't see you voting it could be in trouble for you so everybody's got to vote on one of them okay raise your hand if you think the blue one is a fraction bigger okay raise your hand if you think the pink one is a fraction bigger okay looks like majority's got the pink one what was your first instinct before I said anything about the circles but they're probably equal they look equal just a different color that is because in fact they are equal they are the exact same size identical but I got just by a few words I got everybody as soon as I said that the first words I said they're different some of you said golly bum they are I can see that right there you know but they're not and I seen this on the internet a professor did it in a college room did the same thing everybody was a vote this one's bigger that one's bigger and but he kind of went down a different Avenue and I sat there and I thought this is exactly what Satan does to us we our first initial is we know what's right we know God's word we know what is for us but then Satan starts talking to us and since he starts talking to us he starts changing our mind you know and uh that's his job to come in and make you disbelieve you know I've got he tries to make you disbelieve that you you can't be healed he tries to make you disbelieve that God doesn't hear you when you pray that your friends don't like you or you don't have any friends he tries to get you to disability that everyone in school thinks you're weird the only bad thing about that one if you're homeschooled that it could be a problem that one is you know he tell you you're not part of the Bride you're not saved you're not going into rapture he talks to all of us continue every day and uh if you notice he's a liar you know how many times did Satan tell you that you're not saved before you got baptized before you got saved zero it's after you you start your walk with Lord he starts saying you're not saved you're not going into Rapture but the best thing is that we know he's a liar so if he's telling you you're not saved it's a good thing that you are who's telling you can't go in the rapture it's a good evidence that you are going so always believe that just don't let him don't let him do what I did everything I said I made up the left-handed people you know whatever it wasn't true I just made it all up it's blowny and that's exactly what Satan throws at us and sometimes we still believe it that's just he uses fear tactics you know and I said everybody has to vote you know it could get bad for you he starts telling you things that you know are fearful to you and you start believing it but that's that's his ways you know but you see what I'm my point is with this it's very simple but uh and I want everyone from this night forward when you start hearing that voice he'll be talking to me probably tonight to you in the morning but when you hear that voice and you know God's word you know the promises that are for you you in your mind you walk through those doors you come in and sit exactly in your seat you look at those two two circles until Satan he's a liar because you know what is right for you that's what I want us to do with this but uh I think that's a that's about it let's just have a word of Prayer father God lord I once again I just thank you for this facility that you've given us father Lord that we can have these young people over and and fellowship with them and and just come to

[Music] holy holy holy I want to see [Music] amen how many wants to see him tonight amen you know what the prophet told us something very powerful he said if you want to see God you can see him and you know what he also said in another place he said if you want to see God he said I believe that God wants to show himself God in other words God wants to be seen and so I believe that if we really want to see God tonight I believe that we can see him amen we can see him in his word we can see him in his people amen how many believes that you can see him in one another and and so amen I tell you it just all depends on what you're looking for tonight you know if you if you come with an expectation you won't be disappointed amen how many has a need tonight you just want to make it known by lifting your hand I believe God sees every hand he sees every heart tonight so let's just bow our hearts together and look to him Lord Jesus we just come before your throne of grace and we thank you for this opportunity that you've given us to gather together and Lord we look out and see these young people that's here on a Friday evening and Lord of all the things that they could be doing and Lord but they've they've chose to come here and and Lord I believe that it's because that there's something a desire Lord that you placed in them Lord we know there if there's a deep that's calling there's got to be a deep to respond Lord if there's something in them as that that's crying out for you then I believe Lord that Lord there's something to meet that tonight there's Lord there's a God that Lord I think about how that Lord when a soul begins to crowd Lord nothing could stop you Lord you cross the land and sea you Lord in the Bible Lord there was one Soul crying out Lord over there in the in the land of Galleria and Lord just that one crying out and Lord you left the multitudes and great revivals crossed Land and Sea to go to that one need Lord if you would do that then I believe you'll do it again today Lord so if there's somebody crying out for you I pray God that you just come tonight Lord that's what we desire more than anything Lord I pray that you had just help us to lay our our thoughts to the side Lord our own anything that Lord perhaps we would want to say or do God we just lay all that down now we just want you to speak Lord we want you to have your way Lord we're giving you the preeminence Lord we've studied we've tried to do our part and but Lord we want you to do the ministering tonight Lord because you know the needs and Lord you know the things that we don't know so God we're asking you tonight just to minister to every heart touch every life Lord just speak to us through your word now and Lord I pray you'll give us a heart to receive Lord we commit ourselves into your hands and we give you this service for your glory in Jesus name amen amen amen just honored to be here tonight and amen we appreciate the brothers brother Joe and uh and for giving us the invitation of course brother Donnie appreciate the confidence that they would have for us to be able to come and speak to you and and I tell you it's a great privilege to speak to the to the young people of this message and I believe that you're the cream of the crop and there ain't no better young people than uh you know you're the uh you're the results of of the word of God that's been preached and and the the the fruits of of the ministry and and I always say like this you're the greatest evidence that this message is true you know a lot of people think about oh there's all kinds of things and vindications and we thank God for all those vindications but I'm looking at one of the greatest vindications that there is right here tonight amen and so uh I believe that with all my heart amen let's just look in our Bibles tonight we'll turn to the Book of Revelations in the sixth chapter of Revelations and I'm also going to read out of the book of James in the fourth chapter of James start here in Revelations chapter 6. and I'd like to read from verse 12. and everybody's going to think man this is strange for a youth service so but uh just you just pray and and I believe that the Lord will just bring it together tonight but Revelation 6 and verse 12. and I beheld him when he had opened the Sixth Seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became his blood and the stars of Heaven fell into the Earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she's shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it's rolled together in every mountain and Island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the Mighty Men And every Bond Man and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and the Rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him and setteth on the throne and from the Wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand James chapter 4 and I'd like to read from the 13th verse the Bible says go to now ye that say today or tomorrow we shall go into such a city and continue their year and buy and sell and get gained whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow for what is your life is even a vapor that appear for a little time and then vanish it away for that ye ought to say if the Lord will we shall live and do this or that may God add His blessings as you're seated I want to um just speak out of those scriptures tonight and and if I had a title I would title it a Divine interruption and um I was several years ago I was out in Colorado hunting and I was there with brother Wayne Lawson and we were doing some some elk hunting and we were there over the weekend and on Sunday morning most of the time on Sunday you know we just kind of hang around and don't really do much hunting but just try to you know give that time to the Lord and you know because Sunday just being a special time and um and so we were we were there and and he just pulled up the service back home that there in Ohio and brother there was a brother preaching there and and he was he was speaking on interruptions and and as he was speaking brother Daryl you know how it is sometimes somebody'll just say something and and and and when they say it it just an inspiration begins to open up and and so I began to think about you know an interruption and and so that that's what inspired this thought and I preached it before but and I you know I was studying in different directions praying God just show us the way to go for these services and and I just couldn't get away from this thought and you know it may as I said seem a little bit odd you reading about the Sixth Seal and you're preaching a youth service you say brother you're going to preach the Sixth Seal for a youth service well you know I tell you what you're not just any youth you're a special group of of young people tonight and I believe that I could preach the Sixth Seal amen and you would have an understanding of it amen I tell you that you're blessed amen that you know that that word has been open in such a way and I and I look out here and I see uh different young people from different assemblies and you know a great group from this church and I know you're well taught and and and you the rest of you know you got good Pastors in there and you've been taught the word of God and so I'm not worried about about it tonight I'm not worried about getting too deep or or being too shallow amen I think we ought to just follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen but as I look at this tonight I do want to read a couple quotes and I'm not going to preach on The Sixth Seal as uh I may mention some things about it but but I want to read a quote out of The Sixth Seal to get started and the prophet of God said here he said I could say some something awful good right here but I guess I'll hold that he said and he begins to go back into the scripture here and it says that they have power over the waters to turn them in the blood and the Smite the Earth with plagues as often they will now he's describing the ministry of Moses and Elijah that is to come during this time of The Sixth Seal and how many knows that they're going to come to Israel during the tribulation these Moses and light and this ministry amen that they're going to have is is going to they're going to have power to over the waters to turn them in the blood and the Smite the Earth with plagues as often as they will what is is it what can we bring at these things or he said what could bring these things but the word see amen they can do to Nature any way they want and here it is they're they're the one who brings the six seal they uncover and open it up it's the power of God to interrupt nature see The Sixth Seal is a completely an interruption of nature amen do you get it now there's your seal what does it do it's those prophets on the other side of the Rapture with the power of God the word of God and they just condemn nature they can send earthquakes turn the moon into blood the sun do anything amen at their command amen it's an interruption of nature now what is an interruption an interruption of the definition of it is it's something that causes a stop or a stop in action amen it is to cause her to make a break in the continuity or the uniformity or a a process see or a condition to break take something off to cause it to cease in the middle of something that's an interruption Amen to cause a break or a discontinuation an interference through action or speech amen especially by interjecting a remark so amen how many knows what it is to be interrupted you you know sometimes you're talking to somebody and you're in deep conversation somebody else just walks up and they interrupt you now you know and and then you you know how many's ever interrupted somebody now some of you children is probably more acquainted on that side and you know you you've done a lot of interrupting and probably been corrected quite a bit for interrupting but you know but what is it you see it it causes a distraction amen and and it will cause a shift even in in focus and even it could stop something completely from happening you know we're here we are and we're having church tonight and and you know and we're writing Mill the service but I tell you what if the fire alarms went off that would be an interruption and it would probably bring an end to you know I guarantee you wouldn't be paying attention to what I'm saying no more amen because you're wondering what's going on it's an interruption see and sometimes you know most of the time amen we look at interruptions as being bad but amen but I want you to see tonight that every Interruption is not a bad thing sometimes we need an interruption amen amen just as I said you know if if if your house was on fire amen and you know you're you're all caught up in reading a book or something like that amen you would be happy if somebody come along and interrupted you amen you know you might you might think that's awful rude for them to interrupt me like that amen but I guarantee you you'd be thankful for it amen when you realize wow they were interrupting you is that right amen now as we look at this I'm just going to read a few quotes and uh uh but the prophet said he said what about Healing The Sick he said see greater is he that is in you than the sickness because that's an interruption see it's interrupting the very laws of God's sickness is well see he's showing that sickness is an inner is an interruption of Health is that right amen so we can see it by that the prophet said the devil that's interrupted the very program of your life so sometimes Satan will come along and interrupt your life with sickness amen see he's goes on he says see Satan interrupts the life now amen I can we can trace this all the way back to the Garden of Eden because amen what happened in the Garden of Eden was actually an interruption see because amen the fall in the garden was an interruption of Eternity it was an interruption of perfection amen how many knows that God had a masterpiece family and amen and all creation was perfect and amen there was no sin there was there was everything God and his his children was in perfect Fellowship amen but then Satan climbs down and creeps under the wall amen and comes in amen and what does he do amen Eve begins to listen Amen to the LIE of the enemy and it brought an interruption Amen to Perfection it brought an interruption that friends I just say this and I time it's only an interruption to Eternity amen amen but thank God Amen one day the interruption's going to end amen and time's gonna blend right back into eternity again hallelujah amen so as we look at this amen I'll just say this amen because brother Brown's saying now sickness is an interruption it's it's Satan amen bringing an interruption brother Brown said in your life it's an interruption of Health how many believes that God Amen desires you to be healthy amen listen friends I I we don't have to wonder about these things tonight amen God don't want you to be sick God Amen don't want you to be depressed ah God does not want you to be oppressed or burdened amen amen I'm having a spirit of depression upon your life amen that is not the desire of God Amen that's an interruption amen that Satan has brought into your life amen but I say this tonight if Satan can interrupt Health with sickness I believe that God by the Holy Ghost can interrupt sickness with health amen by the power of Divine Healing hallelujah amen do you believe that tonight amen now amen as I said most of the time we look at an interruption as being a negative thing but but but you know sometimes we need an interruption amen because I just say this we were all on our way to hell every one of us amen amen I I hope that you know I hope that most of us is on another path tonight but maybe there's some that's still on that road but I'll tell you this amen all of us all of you all the adults every one of us that was born in this world we all come the same way amen and we were all born in sin amen and Shake shaping in iniquity amen and another place the Bible said we come into this world speaking lies amen why because we were born the wrong way amen and we come here as a sinner amen and we were a sinner by Nature now amen Paul was saying in Ephesians 2 Ephesians 2 and verse 1 and you have to be quickened who were dead in sin ever in trespasses and sins we're in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh and the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and we were by Nature the children of the Wrath even as others listen amen we were Sinners by Nature I'm glad that ain't the end of the story but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love we're with he has loved us even when we were dead in sins had quickened us together with Christ by Grace you are saved Hallelujah it has raised us up together and made us to sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that means glad for the grace of God tonight amen but listen as I said you amen were a sinner by Nature what's what's what the prophet said in the invisible Union by the natural birth see natural you love the world because you're up you're our of the world a part of the world that's right see your desire was by nature to love the world which you're a part of you are a part of nature see believe that amen that's your natural thing that's the reason you have to be born again you have to separate you have to die to that first husband you can't live with it you just can't say well I'll divorce him and hang him up here even until an occasion no sir amen there ain't no writing of divorcement he dies the nature of the world has to die and respect of him has to die and then you have to be reunited again with another nature your own book is gone your own Union your name in the old amen has been transferred and now you say you mean to tell me my old book it was put in the sea of his forgetfulness and you stand perfectly before God your your name now is in a new book even not in the book of life of the Lamb's Book of Life amen what Amen Alive in the last book of life your marriage certificate he said hallelujah amen where your true germ from the beginning takes hold amen now you're not only forgiven you're Justified glory amen that's Romans 5 and 1. therefore being justified by faith amen you talk about an interruption friends you talk about an interruption of nature amen now you're catching my thoughts tonight amen because just like them two prophets now you I want to just break into this for a minute and show you where I'm going just like them two prophets amen Moses and Elijah amen will step out in that tribulation and with the word of God brother Daryl amen they will interrupt all nature is that right amen what will do it the word of God will do it amen it will bring an interruption of Nature and when it happens shrey is amen there's 144 000 Jews that's going to get the baptism the true baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and believe the same message that you believe you believe that sure they will amen but I want to tell you what free is amen I don't plan to be here in the tribulation hallelujah amen and listen amen that is not amen what's gonna that is not my message that is not my time amen my time is now your time

natural because it's in his nature it's born in him can you say Amen Abraham and that's exactly amen why amen you amen did wrong even when you knew it was wrong amen because you had the wrong nature and nobody had to teach you how to lie it just come natural amen amen but I want to tell you I got I got some good news for you tonight amen amen the Bible says amen you were in times past now some of us has got a different testimony tonight Hallelujah because our Nature has been changed by the power of the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen and now as Peter would say we have been made for takers of the divine nature have an escape the amen the Wrath of the world through lust I believe he said amen but watch Friends amen now you will have a different nature oh my amen well I'll just tell you this if you were a sinner by Nature and now your Nature's been changed amen if you're a Christian by Nature come on friends if you're a Christian by Nature ain't nobody gotta beg you to go to church ain't

gotta beg you to do it amen you you don't need no pep rally you don't need no papa you just need a place amen you just need a place you just need some Liberty amen you just need some room amen that's all I'm saying tonight I ain't here to pump you I'm here to give you some room I don't let it just be a y'all hallelujah amen it is seeing you by Nature to believe the word to receive the word to amen the word to live the word because when you're born again amen now you have a different nature is that right you talk about interruption First Corinthians 6 and 9. he said no you're not that unrighteousness shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor infinite nor abusers of themselves with mankind Northeast nor covenants nor drunkers nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God that's a pretty big list amen he said none of these is going to inherit the kingdom of God and such were some of you Paul's saying listen this was your condition at one time many of you are in this condition s look at the early church look at look at let your Bible I tell you what you're going to find in there you ain't gonna find a bunch of Perfect People I know people come along today and they they want to point out all the mistakes they want to point out all mistakes in the message you know and all the mistakes and with our prophet and amen listen friends they just come to tell you he was a man we already knew that amen amen but I want to tell you what amen is a bunch of mistakes in this Bible you say oh brother preach your brother be careful preacher amen that's the perfect word of God and I believe it is the infallible word of God and I believe every word of it from cover to cover amen but there's a lot of mistakes in this Bible you want to know what they are amen Abraham lied David was a murderer was a harlot Paul was an enemy to the church a persecutor of the Believers hallelujah amen that's what they were but that's not who they are Hallelujah because they met God one day and God changed them Hallelujah and now even they are all trophies of the grace of God Amen Let me just say this even as such were some of you hallelujah amen but you are lost Hallelujah and you are signified but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God hallelujah I tell you what amen if you're a young person here tonight amen and you experienced God Amen in the way of the new birth amen and you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you ought to lift your hands lift your voice and thank God tonight amen that his grace found you hallelujah amen you were going in the wrong direction but God interrupted your path hey he changed the course I like what brother Ram said perfect Faith he said we caught me when when he caught me I was nothing I'm still nothing but I'm in his hand Hallelujah he caught me he loved me when I was unlovable amen he loved you and he was unlovable but he changed you it's just like the old sister's head aiming that time in her testimony I'm not what I ought to be I'm not what I want to be amen but thank God I'm not what I used to be amen how many feel that way tonight this is amen you might not be what you want to be amen and I tell you what amen if you're satisfied where you're at you need to come to this altar because a real True Believer don't never get satisfied they don't never get enough of God it's always crack there's a cry in the heart I want more I want to refill it amen I want a closer walk I want more Revelation amen I I want a more dedicated consecrated life it's a risk I'm not what I want to be I might not even be what I ought to be but I know this for sure tonight I'm not what I used to be by the grace of almighty God I've been changed Hallelujah how many can say that tonight how many please God's done at work in your life how maybe some God started something in you well I want to tell you something about my God he don't never do nothing halfway [Applause] and God ain't never started a project that he didn't finish Hallelujah he ain't never started something that he didn't complete that's why I feel like Paul tonight even I am persuaded Hallelujah that he is able to keep that which I committed unto him even in he that has begun a good work in me shall perform it to the day of Jesus Christ he is both the author and the finisher of my faith listen friends if he's changed my nature he's going to change my body if he change my nature come on Church even if he turns you around Hallelujah if he give you a victory one time he'll give you a victory again Hallelujah and he won't stop until you're completely delivered and made whole Hallelujah plenty family has nothing I'm still nothing but I'm in his hand that's the way see amen that's the way if God he said I was an alien from him so he loved me until he stood down to get me and picked me up and that gives me confidence that hey what he that he wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen something in me he's seen something in you he had a reason to save you look at the people that's unsafe tonight look at the millions that he could have took beside of you but he took you amen no one can take your place Hallelujah nobody can take your place listen to me young people ain't nobody can take your place you think well brother Josh you know I'm just little I'm just small you ain't got to be big and then well you know I don't have the gift that you have or I don't have the ministry brother Daryl has there's a reason we ain't here and compare ourselves with one another I can't be you you can't be me but I tell you this I can't take your place Hallelujah let me encourage you tonight amen you young people amen I tell you what there's a story in this Bible amen that name it was a leper amen over there in the land of Syria amen and he was a great man and a mighty man the Bible says but yet he was a leper and leprosy represents sin amen but Dad took a little captive girl that the Bible the Bible don't even call her name they took that little captive girl and they took her over there in the land of Syria and she become a maid to naaman's wife and one day she got to testify and she said I would to God Amen that my Lord was over in my country amen because there's a prophet of Yonder amen and he knows the supernatural he's acquainted with a supernatural God Amen and if I could just get him over there he'd be healed and may hold amen the prophet of God picked that up he said that little girl had a testimony amen and knows that she was surrounded amen Elizabeth she was a slave she was an alien she didn't have nobody around her to support her she didn't have no church to go to amen she didn't have no youth group to join remember all by herself she had a testimony Hallelujah in the power of that testimony amen took a mighty great man amen over to the land of Israel and got him in connection with a prophet [Applause] and Naaman was healed and her story became immortal in the scriptures I think about Mary over there in John 12 I believe it was she coming anointed Jesus and and anointed him for his death and she poured that ointment on him and it was costly and it was great is that right yeah even so much that it Judas and some of the others begin to criticize say what a waste what a waste she took this money could this this could have been sold and the money could have been given to the poor and we could have used this to feed a bunch of people and but the Bible says it because listen friends the Bible said that Judas didn't say that because he cared for the poor no no no no no amen he had a critical spirit amen and he looked at what she she was doing and she said and he said that's a that's a waste but you know what the Bible says Jesus said she did what she could she did what she could listen she couldn't preach the Bible wouldn't allow it she couldn't be a missionary the Bible wouldn't allow it amen but she did what she could amen and her name become immortal in the scripture and so much that Jesus said wherever the gospel is preached her name will be mentioned I don't know why I'm here tonight but I'm just going to I I believe I'm here for a reason this ain't in my notes I believe I'm here for a reason to encourage some of you young sisters you might not be able to preach behind a Pulpit but I'll tell you one thing with your long hair and long dress you're preaching a sermon louder than any preacher that's ever stood behind the pulpit hallelujah amen and every one of you young men you might not be called to be a preacher amen but you got a Ministry and your life is a testimony amen I tell you what just take what you got and do what you can hallelujah amen don't you be ashamed of it even just do what you can even I guarantee you amen your name will be immortal Hallelujah let me try to find out where I'm at and then so you know I was just thinking about interruptions and I was thinking about how you know sometimes you know as young people and I'm going to try to be brief and as I can but you know as young people you know you make a lot of plans and sometimes you know especially about the age where you guys are at right now I mean you're in a planning time of your life you're you're you know there's so many decisions in front of you and you know you you're you're deciding on Career paths and you know what direction you're going in to further your education or you know to not or whatever more and and on your and all those things and but I I think this is everybody's gonna understand this because you know sometimes you make a lot of big plans but love can be a great interruption you know you got it all figured out and you know exactly what you're going to do and where you're going to live and you know exactly where you're going to school and you know all these things you got it all figured out and then one day you just see her and everything changes you know what you know what just happened interruption love interrupted same you can look at either way you know you see that boy or whatever it is and you know what your plans just change you see what I'm saying it just get it can be interrupted even and all the things you had figured out and all the dreams that you had and all the amen but just in a moment everything's beginning to change you know and I I thought about that and I thought you know you can look all through the through the scripture and you can see how that there was people and they were going on a certain path a certain course in a certain direction I think about the woman at the well and you know the life that she had lived and and the troubles that she had had and she had been you know uh married several times and all these things and all the disappointments and the failures and everything that she but one day she'd come to a well listen she didn't go to that well to meet Jesus but Jesus went there to meet her oh she didn't wake up that morning brother they don't think now I'm going to go down to the well and meet I'm gonna go meet my savior I'm going to go meet him a man that's going to change my life forever she had no thought of that she was just going about her day amen she was just doing the thing same thing she did yesterday and and no doubt she had her day all planned out and and she was going to go down and draw some water and then she probably had a lot of things she was going to do after that amen but Jesus amen told his disciples I got a need to go by the well so Mary I got a need hallelujah amen and when he went down to that well he began to speak to that woman and he began to reveal the very secrets of her heart hallelujah amen and he interrupted her life [Applause] Hallelujah it was a Divine interruption let me tell you amen her plans changed I don't know what she had planned that Afternoon brother Dale but her plans changed amen you say what are you talking about I tell you what I'm talking about by the time amen he got done with her she dropped her water pots [Applause] she didn't even take the water back to the house even she left what she was doing and she forgot about her plans and she went running into the City and said come see a man that told me all the things that I'd ever done is this not the Christ Hallelujah I tell you what friends I believe we need some interruption in this amen well I pray that God will interrupt our services interrupt our programs amen I say let the spirit of God Amen fall down in the church even because I tell you what we get too much in a rut and we got everything all planned out and we're gonna sing three songs he's gonna preach 45 minutes we're gonna sing three more songs and then we all go into amen cookout or our McDonald's or wherever y'all go even if I tell you what sometimes a Divine Interruption amen begins to take place in the spirit of God begins to move and the Holy Ghost drops down Hallelujah and you forgot about McDonald's and you forgot about cookout and you find yourself living in an auction amen what we need amen is an interruption let the spirit of God move [Applause] I ain't got a a lot of time but I got a lot of materials but you do you realize do you realize that God interrupted the course of this world for you listen friends way back there in the first World War brother Brown will begin to talk about it he said all the arms of the earth gathered together and he said the world was moving in a course of Destruction is that right I know this way before your time you know I started to use an example tonight about interruptions and I was gonna you know use this example sometimes you know you you you'd listen to the radio and and then there comes this big buzzing sound across the radio and then you hear a voice and it says this is the emergency broadcast system and we have interrupted this program and the more I thought about I thought I was putting on them kids ever heard but you know he you know even though this was way before your time the Bible speaks of it the first woe the first World War and and and the in the in the armies of the Earth are gathered together and the world is on a a course to destruction and man would have completely destroyed himself but God stepped in according to Revelations the seventh chapter and the first verse there he said and after these things I saw the Four Angels standing on the four corners of the Earth holding the Four Winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor the sea nor of any tree and I saw another Angel ascending from the East having the seal the Living God and he cried with the loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth into the sea saying hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the trees till till we have sealed the Servants of God in their foreheads and the number of them which I heard were still worse and they were sealed whereas 144 000 of all the trials of Israel this of course speaking of that elect group of of Jews amen that would be sealed under the ministry of Moses Elijah that I was talking about brother man would call them the 11th Hour workers and they amen would have to be in the Homeland amen when the Lord returns back to the Earth Amen to receive Christ there amen the one that they amen their Messiah that they had rejected they'll have to be back in their Homeland amen and listen amen but under that first world war listen to Israel wasn't even a nation amen they were not in in their position amen and and yet the world was moving to destruction so God stepped in and stopped it he interrupted it amen and brother Brown would talk about it was 11th month 11th day 11th hour he said why was it nobody understands he said they talked about they've they they wrote books about it amen they've asked the generals who who was the one that come forth and who done this and nobody had the answer it was mysteriously stopped at that time why it's the question why was it stopped I tell you why amen it was because there was an 11th Hour worker hallelujah amen there was some elect amen Jews amen that had to be in the Homeland Amen brother Prophet comes along and says and there's also an 11th Hour Gentile worker Hallelujah you want to know why the world was not destroyed under the first world war you are the reason you want to know why I wasn't destroyed under the second amen you are the reason you want to know why amen the atomic bombs ain't falling right now you are the reason you want to know why even that the Lord didn't come amen and finish this thing in 1963 or 1965 brother you looking at it tonight you want to know why it didn't end in 1977 even you are the reason because he wrote your name on the last book of life but for the foundation of the world and all the angels of Destruction being held back for you he's been waiting on you to get here hallelujah amen he's been waiting on you to come amen God is holding but holding it back amen there's something luciferous there's something holding back the tribulation right now you want to know what it is amen you say well brother Josh amen the cup of the amorites ain't quite fool you amen that's part of it friends but I tell you what this world is ready for tribulation amen I don't know how much bull that cup can get amen but I believe it's about to run over right now amen they're ready for it they're in the spirit of it ain't but one thing on back the Judgment of God and that's the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and I don't know but one of you might be the last one oh brother amen that's why I'm gonna preach when everything's within me that's my brother Adam's gonna preach that's my brother Dale's gonna preach that's why your pastor preaches that's why brother Joe preaches Amen in every certain way preach we preach like it's the last one because it might be Hallelujah because you might be the last one to recognize Who You Are it could be in these youth meetings that the last one gets sealed with the Holy Ghost this bracket being Glory [Music] well I believe that you think about this friends and I'm going to try to wind this up but in closing I want you to think about this you know that's because I was thinking about them Jews and the Bible talks about how they were scattered so if they were scattered to the four corners of the earth brother there they were scattered all over they was in Africa they was in Europe they was scattered all over the world but God had already gave a prophecy he prophesied through Isaiah he had prophesied through Hosea amen and many other prophets of the Old Testament had spoke amen of their that there would be a time that they would be gathered back Hosea said amen in the third day hallelujah amen he said after two days amen after two days amen he would begin to revive them and gather them brother Brown would talk about how even though he would chop her out amen by the prophets and how that you know how the Israel would be gathered back together and brother man would talk about how that you know that he would even begin to describe the pressures of the world and and men under the uh anointing of Supernatural demon powers like Hitler and and Stalin and Mussolini and all these men and they begin to uh you know they were literally killing them by the thousands amen that persecution coming and brother Brown called it the tender hand of Jehovah he said driving them back to their Homeland I thought about that brother Daryl and I thought you know what they had they had homes many of them in Germany and Belgium and England in in France all over the world they had homes they were they they were born there they they had raised their children there I mean they had businesses there they were successful there no doubt they planned to to to live there the rest of their life to leave a legacy their children would continue on take over their businesses amen raise their children amen leave it to their children and on and on and we go listen amen they didn't have no plans to to uproot and and go back to a land that they had never seen or never knew or or or or or what that we would call their Homeland listen friends amen it wasn't it wasn't a Homeland to them it was it was like a foreign country they felt like they were at home and they had their plans and their and their they had their um you know um Ambitions and and and and and all these things and and they had it all mapped out and God interrupted listen France and their plans changed and they no longer had their business and they no longer had their homes and they no longer had a future and there was nowhere to go and brother Brown said what was it it was a Tinder hand of Jehovah leading them back to their Homeland driving them back to their Homeland he would go on that same quote he said we see the churches today as communicating the people putting them out all these things even think about it in the early years of this message there was no message churches would go to you are a blessed generation [Applause] you're a blessed group of young people Amen to be able to come to a church amen and have a pastor preach this message to you and be surrounded by message believers there was a time that none of that existed and brother Master they're being pushed out and forced out he said but it's just a tender hand of Jehovah leading them to the Tree of Life hallelujah amen amen and I begin to think about that and I thought about amen and look amen there she is over in her Homeland now Israel is a nation Amen in there I believe amen and you know listen friends amen I'm not trying to preach Doctrine tonight or anything like that amen but I believe amen that 144 000 that group of elect Jews they're probably right there right now in the land of Palestine just waiting for them two prophets to come amen just waiting to receive the message amen and listen by the way the message that them two prophets is going to preach it's the same message that you hear every Sunday and every Wednesday Hallelujah and the holy ghost that they're going to get is the same holy ghost that you already got Hallelujah and by the way the 11th Hour worker got the same pay as the first hour worker and let me just tell you this that's why I can say this tonight amen you 11th are Gentile workers that are sitting in front of me tonight you are them a living dire workers you are thou to liveth our Gentile group and you've got the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost it ain't no different Holy Ghost it ain't no lesser Holy Ghost it's the same Holy Ghost amen and if it's the same only goes it'll do the same thing Hallelujah it'll have the same results you believe that I believe they're there now amen amen but I want to tell you what amen there's another Interruption coming friends there's an interruption coming this world it's called a tribulation think about it they got all kind of plans and people's got all kind of ambitions and and they're planning to stay here forever and they're planning to you know and they got all kind of things that they plan to do and but there's coming an interruption it's called a tribulation there's coming Interruption under the ministry of two prophets nature is going to fall apart the sun's going to refuse to shine earthquakes amen all the things you read about in this Bible amen but I want to leave you with this before that interruption there's going to be another interruption it's called The Rapture Hallelujah and that's why James begins to say don't make plans as if it's a definite thing amen because your plans are subject to change hallelujah amen you might have a lot of things you might have plans amen that will not be fulfilled amen for 10 years you might be making plans right now for things you're going to do in 10 years but I want to tell you them plans are subject to change because there's coming an interruption Prince It's called The Rapture hallelujah amen think about it Enoch was walking one day and he just went for a stroll but an interruption dropped down Hallelujah and God told Nina you're closer to my house than you're out of yours just come on and go home with me Hallelujah he interrupted his plans Abraham took him in her action Abraham and Sarah was making plans one day to die even they were making plans and getting old remember one day in Genesis 18. amen stop struck the hell amen God begin to speak to them and reveal the secret of serious heart amen and God interrupted their own age and changed their mind back there young man and a young woman I tell you what amen some of you don't understand this even but some of you older ones back here do amen there's going to be an interruption even of your age the aging process even hair turning green I'm turning into your shoulders stupid now but God is going to interrupt it Hallelujah you say brother amen but what about them that's already dead don't worry I got a tie for them too Lazarus amen died and they buried him and Corruption that said in his body amen just to prove to us that even that wouldn't stop it hallelujah amen but amen but Jesus come down there to the grave of Lazarus and the son of man began to speak and he interrupted [Applause] God of God he interrupted the corruption process that had already started in Lazarus body and he said Lazarus come forth and a man had been dead for four days stood up and walked out of a grave I want to tell you what tonight church I don't care what your condition I don't care the champion I don't care how low you are I don't care how bad it is amen I know of God that can interrupt the course of your this event I don't care how deep and sin you are tonight I know a God that can turn you around foreign just lift your hands and say oh God Amen interrupt my course interrupt my life enter up my plans turn me around [Applause] let there be a divine interruption let's stand our feet tonight the musicians would come listen to me Church brother Daryl you know I don't I don't know why I just feel to say this tonight I'm glad he interrupted me I tell you what I'm not going to give you all my whole testimony I know the time is gone now and I preach what I had on my heart just preach and but I just wanna share this with you tonight because maybe some of you have felt the way I felt and you know what brother Daryl I I was raised in the church even raising the message and and there was just something in my heart I never doubted this message as being true like I just you know the devil didn't battle me in that way he just didn't do it because I don't know it's just something my heart was just settled you know I just I never questioned that I knew it's real you know there's something real about that I didn't understand all of it but it was just and you know what brother Aaron I've seen a lot of stuff around the message and growing up as a kid and I've seen a lot of things happen I've seen a lot of wrong things happen I've seen a lot of bad mistakes made a lot of disappointments you know I looked at a lot of people and people that I looked up to and had a lot of confidence in they just you know let me down do you know what all that somehow another by the grace of God you never it never shook me brother I knew it was right but you know how the devil fought me this is this is how the devil fought me the devil Hey listen brother Brown said this way he said when God's silent devil does a lot of talking and I will you know the devil was just telling me constantly it ain't gonna work you're a failure you you know what I convinced myself of or I let him do I let him convince me that the message is right but it ain't for me you know in the way we hear predestination the election and things like that and thank God for them truths I mean wonderful truth ain't you how many is thankful for that wonderful Revelation but you know what the devil he's slick he is a slick guy he'll take the very things that you believe and turn them around and use them against you and he started telling me he said you ain't predecimated and if you ain't predestinated ain't nothing you can do about it you cannot make yourself predestinated and I thought you know what devil you're right [Music] and I was really battling and that pull of the world was really pulling me and I thought you know what I know it's right but I'm probably going to hell anyway so I might as well just go on out and and live live like the world and have fun and but just even though I was raised in the church to give you a little bit of background I come up in a broken home that was an alcoholic his dad was an alcoholic I seen I've seen what the world had to offer I looked at some of my family I seen broken marriages and broken homes I couldn't hold down a job never you know no future no nothing and I'll tell you what I've done one day I remember it I was standing on the porch of a church and I I was just standing there brother on there forget this I was thinking about it and I thought you know what I might not be predestinated and I might not be elected I might not even make it [Music] but this is a better way to live [Music] and I said I want to have a family and I want to raise some children and I want to be a good daddy and I want to be a good husband and this is a better way to live I'll tell you what I'm going to do even if I ain't predestinated I'm going to stay with this and I'm just going to do the best I can and I said Lord if when it all ends if I if I just end up in hell you know I'm just going to do the best I can and I'm going to stay with this right here as soon as I made that decision and I said God begin to deal with my heart listen friends I tell you what it cost me friends it cost me I ended up leaving the church I was in there was a lot of things I won't go into all them things but listen God began to deal with my heart and he began to reveal his word to me and he began to he began to show me you do belong to me I don't know why you know I don't know why I didn't really go what I'm preaching tonight but I just felt to share that with you tonight because I really had it just it just come to me real strong and I want to encourage everyone of you because I know the devil's fighting you I know what I know some of you the devil's probably told you the exact same thing some of y'all probably convinced that the message is right but you're wondering if it's for you and you're wondering well you know it it's probably working for somebody else but I'm just not sure that's for me listen it's a better way to live and I'm telling you this you just need to make a decision and I say I'm gonna I'm gonna follow Jesus and brother Brown just come to a place he said even when we get to the end of the road if he throws me in hell amen listen we just had to admit bro Daryl we're just getting what we deserve it's like I told the church Southern artists they you know they say well all this predestination election stuff ain't fair I said you got that right and I don't want what's fair I want God's grace if we got what's fair all of us would go to hell but listen friends the grace of God has brought an interruption Amen in the grace of God is here tonight I tell you what amen listen you ain't got to wait for a tribulation amen your nature can be interrupted tonight by the power of the word and the power of the Holy Ghost can we bow our hearts together I wonder if there's anybody here tonight just want to lift your hand and say Lord I need an interruption I need an interruption in my life I need your grace to just slip down hands up all over the building let's just pray Lord Jesus Lord you see these young hearts and these young people Lord I I know we've carried a little and Lord I'm trying my best just to yield myself and follow you Lord I'm asking you tonight that we're just asking for a special Grace the Holy Spirit just slipped down in a special way tonight Lord maybe there's somebody it's on a collision course they're on a path the direction is
