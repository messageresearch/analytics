[29:56] every service is so impacted by you
[30:00] folks right
[30:01] there if God can ever get it over to you
[30:05] as an individual what a great great
[30:08] responsibility that you have but also
[30:10] what a great input that you have then it
[30:14] would help us to not just look at the
[30:15] preacher well I've Got Confidence in the
[30:17] preacher he's preached for so long he
[30:19] knows how to do it and he knows all that
[30:21] he may know a few things he may know how
[30:24] to study he may know how to even put
[30:25] things together but he's not the the one
[30:28] that controls it he's not the one that
[30:30] controls even the way it flows and how
[30:33] the direction God will move it that's up
[30:35] to you so let's open our hearts tonight

[34:45] never
[34:46] disappoints amen we want to go to the
[34:48] book of Deuteronomy chapter 32 tonight
[34:50] Deuteronomy chapter 32 verse 7
[34:54] Deuteronomy 32 and
[34:56] 7 I just want to follow the leadership
[34:58] of the Lord
[35:00] tonight something just real simple I
[35:03] told brother darl I'm almost embarrassed
[35:04] it's so simple but sometimes God works
[35:06] in the Simplicity of things doesn't he
[35:09] amen Deuteronomy chap
[35:11] 32:7 remember the days of old and
[35:15] consider the years of many
[35:17] generations ask the father and he'll
[35:20] show thee thy elders and they will tell
[35:24] thee when the most high divided to the
[35:27] nation
[35:28] their
[35:29] inheritance when he separated the sons
[35:32] of Adam he set the bounds of the people
[35:36] according to the number of the children
[35:38] of Israel that's right for the Lord's
[35:41] portion is his people Jacob is the lot
[35:46] of his inheritance he found him in the
[35:49] desert land aren't you thankful God can
[35:51] find you he found him in a desert land
[35:55] and in the waste of the howling Wilder
[35:57] Wilderness he led him about he
[36:00] instructed him he kept him as the apple
[36:03] of his eye verse 11 as an eagle stirreth
[36:06] up her
[36:07] nest
[36:09] fluth over her young spreadeth abroad
[36:13] her
[36:14] wings and taketh them and beareth them
[36:18] on her wings look at this as an eagle
[36:22] stirreth up her nest to stir up to cause
[36:26] to move
[36:28] to Rouse awake to awaken I like this
[36:32] last one to incite
[36:35] movement so the Eagle's responsibility
[36:38] to her young is to never allow them to
[36:42] get to the place to where they become
[36:44] complacent being in the nest so what
[36:47] they do is she comes and she stir up the
[36:50] nest which means to awaken verse 12 and
[36:54] so did the Lord alone did lead him and
[36:57] there was no strange god with him he
[37:01] made him ride on the high places of the
[37:05] earth that he might eat the increase of
[37:07] the fields he made him to suck honey out
[37:10] of the Rock and oil out of the flinty
[37:14] rock Matthew chap 24 verse 28 just one
[37:19] verse of scripture
[37:21] there for wheresoever the carcass is
[37:25] there the Eagles be gathered together
[37:29] can we buy our hearts now as we just ask
[37:31] the Lord to bless the word father we're
[37:32] so thankful to be here tonight Lord in
[37:35] this place and we ask Lord that you
[37:37] would just come now that you would move
[37:39] Among Us Lord we know that you're
[37:42] mindful of every need that is in the
[37:43] place this building tonight and Lord
[37:46] we're just asking that you would come
[37:47] and help each one may you take your word
[37:50] and may you direct it to the lives of
[37:52] your people Lord I just believe Lord
[37:54] that you've just led me to go down this
[37:56] direction and we just want to be
[37:58] obedient Lord to your leadership and we
[38:01] pray Lord that you'd come have your way
[38:03] in this place tonight may your spirit
[38:05] may it move Among Us Lord May the
[38:07] anointing just flow Lord in this place
[38:09] as we all just yield ourselves into your
[38:12] presence Lord may you come have your way
[38:15] Lord may you help us tonight we are in
[38:17] such need of you once again may you come
[38:20] and speak to the lives and the heart of
[38:21] your people in the name of Jesus Christ
[38:24] and everybody said amen God bless you
[38:27] tonight you can be
[38:29] seated I want to begin tonight with a
[38:33] statement out the message as an eagle
[38:34] stir up her nest and this is one of the
[38:39] first places where the Prophet actually
[38:41] deals with this type of the eagle and
[38:44] I'd like to speak on that tonight out
[38:47] out of verse 11 as an eagle sth up her
[38:50] nest and I want to um give you this
[38:53] statement as we're going to try to work
[38:54] toward this this evening he says the
[38:57] Prophet here speaking he's talking of
[38:59] course principally about Jacob and how
[39:02] that there was no other God before him
[39:05] he knew no other God but as he said as
[39:09] the eagle stirreth up her nest it's a
[39:13] time that when the eagle thinks that her
[39:16] little ones has matured enough she's got
[39:19] to stir up her nest and God does the
[39:22] same thing in his church when we have
[39:26] got all settled down on something then
[39:28] God stirs The Nest again he brought
[39:31] Martin Luther from Catholicism and they
[39:34] got so starchy that he had to stir the
[39:37] nest and he sent Wesley in and then
[39:40] Wesley got so starchy he stirred the
[39:42] nest and sent Pentecost in and it's I
[39:46] love this statement it's Nest durring
[39:48] time again because we've gotten settled
[39:52] down we know that whenever Moses is
[39:55] writing this at the end of of his
[39:57] ministry and Moses is one that had
[40:00] actually likened the Journey of Israel
[40:02] to an eagle as he tells them that God
[40:05] has bore them on the wings of an eagle
[40:07] and God here is dealing with Jacob and
[40:10] we know that Jacob was going to be the
[40:12] one which would be the top of his people
[40:15] of what his people was going to be named
[40:17] after so whenever God deals with his
[40:20] children which we know are the called of
[40:22] God the chosen of God the elect of God
[40:25] that God would lead him that God would
[40:28] separate him and that God would bring
[40:30] him to a place where Jacob was going to
[40:33] come by to to a birth to be able to
[40:36] actually not just have the birthright
[40:38] but have this great desire for what God
[40:41] has in store for him in his journey and
[40:44] God divided his inheritance as it would
[40:46] be with Israel he was going to divide
[40:49] his inheritance with Israel as he does
[40:52] to Israel the same thing he does to
[40:54] Jacob he's got to bring him to a place
[40:56] of re receiving his inheritance and God
[41:00] once he begins to deal with his people
[41:03] God never wanted Israel to get to the
[41:05] place of being settled but of course
[41:07] it's the nature of man he loves to be
[41:10] able to settle and he loves to become
[41:13] compl it with what God done yesterday or
[41:16] with what God done last week what God
[41:18] done 20 years ago 30 years ago and some
[41:21] people in Christ become settled with
[41:23] what God done last month but God never
[41:26] wants us to get to the place to where we
[41:28] become settled in our walk settled in
[41:31] our experience but he wants always our
[41:34] walk with God to be up today he wants
[41:36] our prayer life to be up today he wants
[41:39] our Bible time to be up today he wants
[41:42] our relationship to him that whenever
[41:44] he's going to do something you have a
[41:46] little insight by the leadership of God
[41:49] that God will actually share with you
[41:51] and and move upon your heart lead you in
[41:54] the way that you need to be led but it's
[41:56] only those who is wanting his will to be
[41:59] done in their life so whenever we get to
[42:01] a place in life to where we become
[42:03] settled down and we become comfortable
[42:06] with going to church comfortable being
[42:08] around the message comfortable having
[42:10] truth having profit knowing the
[42:13] interpretation of the scripture knowing
[42:14] the interpretation of the Book of
[42:16] Revelation look how go God has blessed
[42:18] us you and I can set and God has given
[42:21] us the understanding to the majority of
[42:24] the things that lays in this Bible when
[42:26] it comes to the Book of Revelation we
[42:28] don't have to wonder who the man of sin
[42:30] is we know who it is we don't have to
[42:32] wonder what's taking place under
[42:34] Revelation 5 Revelation 10 Revelation 11
[42:37] we understand the revealing of the seals
[42:40] we understand the revealing of the horse
[42:42] riders all of those things God has
[42:44] blessed us with but with great
[42:46] Revelation and understanding complement
[42:50] can follow that so many times in our
[42:52] Christian walk we get to the place to
[42:54] where we settle and what God has showed
[42:56] us and when we become comfortable we
[42:59] stop reaching for more of God and
[43:01] hungering for more of God but the
[43:03] prophet tells us if you Hunger for More
[43:06] Of God he said that's proof that there's
[43:08] more of God for you to be able to
[43:11] receive and you realize God gets us to
[43:13] the place in life if you are chosen if
[43:16] you're called if you're elected you
[43:18] realize that God will get you to the
[43:20] place where he forces us to move and
[43:23] what he does is he stirs up the nest he
[43:26] stir up up our life and he forces us
[43:29] sometimes to get desperate he forces us
[43:32] sometimes to get on our knees and we
[43:34] call out and we cry out because God
[43:36] never wants our spiritual walk to become
[43:39] stagnant he never wants our spiritual
[43:42] walk to be something of what God did
[43:44] besides what God's doing right now so
[43:47] what God does is he moves us from one
[43:50] Revelation to another and he opens up
[43:52] the word maybe you open your Bible this
[43:54] morning and you read something you may
[43:56] have read it since you was a child but
[43:58] what God can do is he takes what you've
[44:00] looked at many times and he shines the
[44:02] light upon it and illuminates to you
[44:04] what's it do it refreshes our souls and
[44:08] it makes us so thankful for what God is
[44:11] showing us that is an upto-date
[44:13] experience with God but if we don't God
[44:16] to get us to the place to where we call
[44:18] out we cry out because he never wants us
[44:21] to become stagnant Paul said it like
[44:24] this that he moves us from one thing to
[44:26] another he moves us from Glory unto
[44:29] Glory unto Glory because God actually
[44:32] gets us to the place where he wants us
[44:34] to be elevated he don't want us to be
[44:37] from one glory and then go down and then
[44:39] living life a little while troubles come
[44:41] up and then we get a little bit down but
[44:43] he wants us to elevate and become higher
[44:46] and higher as Eagles he wants us to fly
[44:49] higher and higher and higher God never
[44:51] wants his children and he never types
[44:54] his children to be Earthbound people you
[44:57] ever notice that in the Bible that when
[44:59] God Likens his people unto Eagles
[45:01] because he wants his people to be able
[45:04] to soar the scripture teaches us that in
[45:07] many different places the scripture
[45:08] refers to Eagles and talks about the
[45:11] heights that the Eagles has to go to and
[45:13] it mentions the eagle more than any
[45:15] other bird that there is that actually
[45:18] he mentions Eagle 30 something times in
[45:21] the scripture he takes and Likens
[45:23] himself and his people unto an eagle Jo
[45:27] said it like this he says do not the
[45:29] eagle Mount up at thy command and maketh
[45:33] her nest on high and he's telling you
[45:35] does not the Eagle at the command of God
[45:39] does he not Mount up which means he
[45:41] opens up his wings he spreads his wings
[45:44] he begins to put them into action if he
[45:46] doesn't put them into action he can't go
[45:49] no high if he doesn't put them in action
[45:51] he's going nowhere with God but if an
[45:53] eagle wants to soar he's got to put his
[45:56] God G man has god-given ability has got
[46:00] to be put into action and he says does
[46:03] not the eagle Mount up on high at thy
[46:06] command and he's telling does he not
[46:08] Mount up which means to ascend to fly up
[46:11] to be lifted up and to soar Solomon
[46:14] tells us that we should fly and we
[46:16] should soar as the eagle does upon the
[46:19] wind he says it again like this in
[46:21] Proverbs 30:19 the way of an eagle in
[46:25] the air so it's not that he is going to
[46:27] lift up off the ground but there's a way
[46:30] that an eagle flies and what Solomon's
[46:32] referring to is it's different than
[46:34] every other bird that there is that an
[46:36] eagle has the ability Amen to be able to
[46:40] soar higher than any other bird so why
[46:43] does he use the eagle so much because of
[46:45] the ability that it can take and fly so
[46:48] high up in the air and not just the way
[46:51] not just that it flies it's the way that
[46:53] it flies you realize that an eagle he
[46:57] actually flies about 10% and he Soares
[47:00] about 90% about 10% he actually has to
[47:05] take his wings and actually work and you
[47:07] know they tell us that an eagle has the
[47:09] ability to fly somewhere around 40 m an
[47:12] hour when he puts his wings into action
[47:14] oh my so he speeds up and the more He
[47:17] Flops his wings the faster that he goes
[47:19] and the more that he understands how to
[47:22] use the wind currents The Soaring of the
[47:24] eagle uses the wind to be able to fly
[47:27] higher and higher and higher I Saw an
[47:30] Eagle not too long ago there outside our
[47:33] backyard and this Eagle had been pursed
[47:35] up in a tree and a crow had come by and
[47:38] whatever that eagle had done that Crow
[47:40] was not happy and so the crow keeps
[47:43] keeps attacking the eagle over and over
[47:46] and I watched as the eagle leaves the
[47:47] branch because he got tired of the crow
[47:50] flooding around him and crying around so
[47:52] he leaves the branch and he starts going
[47:54] higher and higher and higher I was
[47:56] impress ressed with how high the crow
[47:58] could fly but finally the eagle got so
[48:01] high that the crow had to turn around
[48:03] and go back to the earth I think tonight
[48:06] we can learn a lesson that God has given
[48:09] us the ability to fly higher than the
[48:11] rest of the crows of the world the
[48:13] buzzards and the vultures he's given an
[48:15] eagle the ability to fly higher than any
[48:18] other bird there is it's the way that
[48:21] the eagle flies in the air so it's the
[48:24] manner of the eagle he's carried by the
[48:27] wind up into the Heavenly Spirits he can
[48:29] soar in places 10,000 ft in the air that
[48:33] the eagle can sore and God Likens his
[48:37] people unto Eagles and he tells that
[48:40] Moses actually tells us in the book of
[48:42] Exodus 19 and he said you've seen what I
[48:45] did to the Egyptian crows and how I bear
[48:48] you on Eagle wings and brought you unto
[48:52] myself what's he telling you I want to
[48:54] let you know as the eagle I come to the
[48:57] nest where you was at when I seen you
[49:00] down in bondage and I seen you down in
[49:02] the mud pits I want to let you know the
[49:04] eagle come down to where you was at and
[49:06] he took you upon his wings and he bear
[49:09] you up you know why they couldn't do it
[49:11] by themselves had time went on they
[49:13] would have stayed right there in the mud
[49:15] pits but because Jehovah Eagle amen was
[49:18] watching over his people he come down to
[49:21] where they was at and he bore them on
[49:23] the wings of an eagle
[49:28] Isaiah says it like this in Isaiah 40
[49:30] and 31 but they here's your favorite one
[49:33] but they that wait upon the Lord shall
[49:36] renew their strength they shall Mount up
[49:39] with wings as Eagles so God Likens his
[49:43] church the Eagles but let me tell you
[49:46] this we cannot soar by ourselves we
[49:49] cannot fly alone but if we wait upon the
[49:53] Lord if we wait upon the Lord not only
[49:57] will he give us the strength to be able
[49:59] to fly but when we become weak and we
[50:02] lose our strength and we lose our joy
[50:04] and we lose our Victory we got a promise
[50:06] that if I get down he will renew my
[50:09] strength back to me so I can mount up
[50:12] with wings as an eagle and over and over
[50:17] we could go and the scripture teaches
[50:19] that God Likens him and his people unto
[50:22] Eagles there's something about that
[50:24] whenever you see an eagle soaring and
[50:26] amazing when you're going down the road
[50:28] you never look outside the window go
[50:30] well there's a vulture and everybody oh
[50:31] my there's a vulture there's a crow
[50:33] where's that Crow at but when you say
[50:35] there's an eagle you got the attention
[50:37] of everybody in the car you know why
[50:39] it's a unique bird and an eagle has
[50:43] attributes that every other bird does
[50:46] not
[50:47] [Applause]
[50:49] possess Hallelujah I said they possess
[50:53] an attribute where they can fly higher
[50:55] they can go higher than than anything
[50:57] else that's one of the attributes that
[50:59] an eagle has that's the reason why a
[51:01] eagle never fears storms he never feels
[51:04] fears trouble he never fears wind
[51:07] because he knows if it gets too bad all
[51:09] he has to do is just set his wings upon
[51:12] upon the wind and it'll carry him up
[51:14] above the storm wouldn't that do good if
[51:17] we would understand that tonight we
[51:19] don't have to fear one thing all we have
[51:21] to do is learn how to surrender to the
[51:23] wind and amen and yield to the wind and
[51:27] allow the wind to be able to carry us up
[51:30] above our trouble and our problems not
[51:32] that we don't have them but we don't
[51:34] have to look at it like everybody else
[51:36] and we don't have to live like it like
[51:38] everybody
[51:42] else something about an eagle flying it
[51:45] motivates us something about an eagle s
[51:49] it it pulls on us it makes us it
[51:52] motivates
[51:54] us let me tell you why nobody wants to
[51:57] be locken into a
[52:02] chicken do you nobody wants to be like a
[52:05] chicken nobody wants to scratch around
[52:08] on the ground Peck around on the ground
[52:10] amen remember a chicken's a bird too but
[52:14] the prophet said I heard him say today
[52:15] he's an Earthbound bird I don't want to
[52:18] be likeing unto a chicken but let me
[52:20] tell you he's a bird he's got Wings he's
[52:23] got beaks but let me tell you a chicken
[52:25] does not have the attri rute in him to
[52:27] be able to soar he's got temporary
[52:33] things he's got temporary blessings he's
[52:36] got temporary flight he can jump up and
[52:39] he can jump down he can jump up and he
[52:41] can jump down but I don't want to just
[52:42] jump up and down I want to be able to
[52:44] soar I don't want to be a chicken that
[52:47] can flop around I want the ability that
[52:49] when trouble comes in that I can soar
[52:52] upon the
[52:54] wind the heavens is not the calling of
[52:57] the chicken that's not his inheritance
[53:00] that's not his allotment he is a bird
[53:03] with limited ability can I preach to you
[53:05] tonight no true Christian wants to be
[53:09] limited no believer wants to be limited
[53:12] we are called by God to
[53:17] soar Paul says it like this in Ephesians
[53:20] 1 and three blessed be the God and
[53:22] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has
[53:24] blessed us with all spiritual
[53:29] blessings in barnyards and
[53:32] caves in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[53:38] the believer's position is not in the
[53:41] Barnard it's not in the woods somewhere
[53:44] it's not in the Earthbound part of the
[53:45] world but it's Heavenly places in Christ
[53:49] Jesus notice the way that Paul says he's
[53:52] blessed us there's some birds that are
[53:54] not blessed that way there's crows that
[53:56] are not blessed that way vultures are
[53:59] not blessed the way that an eagle but if
[54:00] you're an eagle of God you've been
[54:02] blessed not with some all spiritual
[54:07] blessings Hallelujah we've been called
[54:09] in Heavenly Heights amen that's the
[54:13] position that God has elected us to
[54:16] that's the allotment of an eagle and
[54:18] that's the inheritance of a
[54:20] eagle but let's just get real tonight
[54:24] okay like the writer said there's an
[54:26] eagle on the inside of me he wants to
[54:29] soar upon the wind yeah but there's also
[54:33] a hip on me it likes to wall in the
[54:37] mud amen I'll say amen for
[54:40] you it amazes me when God calls an
[54:44] individual and God actually ordains a
[54:47] person to be an Eagle When You're called
[54:51] to soar let me tell you this God will
[54:54] not allow you to settle from what he's
[54:56] elected you to if that's your
[54:59] organization in life God's called you to
[55:01] be elect God will not allow you to
[55:03] settle for anything less remember he's
[55:06] talking about Jacob he said as it was
[55:08] with Jacob principally speaking about
[55:10] Jacob Jacob was not called to be a
[55:12] shocker Jacob was not called to be a
[55:14] deceiver Jacob was called to be a prince
[55:17] but in order to get Jacob to where he
[55:19] needed to be at what's God got to do
[55:21] God's got to stir the nest up a little
[55:23] bit God's got to come where Jacob is and
[55:26] trouble surroundings and problem
[55:28] surround and God finally pushes Jacob to
[55:31] the other side of the river where God
[55:32] can wrestle with him a little
[55:35] bit Moses was not called to be The
[55:38] Prince of Egypt Moses was called to be a
[55:41] prophet of God listen he wasn't called
[55:43] to be to be a man that that bind other
[55:46] men would change his job was not to
[55:48] bring
[55:49] servitude that's not what he's anointed
[55:51] to do he was called to be a chain
[55:54] breaker he was called to loose those are
[55:57] about he wasn't called to be The Prince
[55:59] of Egypt that would shackle man up and
[56:02] bind man up he was actually called to be
[56:04] an equal and he was called to loose
[56:06] those that are
[56:08] [Applause]
[56:09] bound David wasn't just called to be a
[56:13] Shepherd over natural sheep he was
[56:15] called To Be a King over Israel and I
[56:18] want to tell David didn't know his full
[56:20] allotment but God knew what it was David
[56:23] was called to be a king and let me say
[56:25] this you're called and you're
[56:29] chosen and God would not allow us as his
[56:32] church to become settled or complacent
[56:35] till we're looking back at what God did
[56:38] beside what God's
[56:40] doing that's been the fault of every
[56:43] Church age they build monuments where
[56:45] God wants movements at they get settled
[56:48] in what God did and how God move and
[56:51] what what's God got to do got to stir
[56:52] the nest up when God see him all my
[56:55] comes down moves among the up a great
[56:57] Revival breaks out what do they do they
[56:59] start looking back and trying to hold on
[57:01] we ain't got to try to take some Revival
[57:02] and hold on to it friends the Revival
[57:05] follows you you ain't got to try to lead
[57:07] people back to something if God's called
[57:09] you to be an eagle he'll send the wind
[57:11] that you need the sword and they'll give
[57:13] you the strength to be able to fly we're
[57:15] not here to Rally around yesterday or
[57:18] last year or 10 years ago or 50 years
[57:20] ago we're called a sar as an eagle
[57:27] every denomination and organization's
[57:29] done that and you know what it's brought
[57:31] deaths I said it's brought deaths but
[57:34] that's not our inheritance that's not
[57:36] our enlightment we're called to mount up
[57:39] with wings as an eagle we are called to
[57:42] be lifted up and what's God got to do to
[57:44] get me there stir me
[57:48] sometimes chickens are content with
[57:50] Barnyard
[57:51] ways Barnyard culture on Barnyard Church
[57:56] Barnyard Services somebody preach with
[57:58] me they're content with eating bugs
[58:01] they're content with eating fleas
[58:02] they're content with eating Li but
[58:04] you'll never find an eagle doing that we
[58:07] are not called to be earthbath
[58:09] everywhere a chicken goes he's got his
[58:11] vision down and he's looking now and
[58:13] he's focused now and he's constantly
[58:15] looking at what's going to come upon the
[58:17] Earth but not an eagle an eagle's not
[58:19] called to look down that's not his
[58:21] alignment he's called to look up he's
[58:23] called to look to Jesus Christ who's the
[58:26] same yesterday today and forever Lord if
[58:28] you didn't move yesterday you're going
[58:29] to move tomorrow he's called to look up
[58:32] that's what he's anointed to do it's
[58:34] continue to look
[58:38] up we're not like the buzzers that
[58:41] circles dead
[58:44] things is this all
[58:46] right we are not called to Circle
[58:49] lifeless things that's not your
[58:52] Enlightenment we are not called to
[58:54] Circle dead things are dead moov ments
[58:56] of
[58:57] yesterday God is not trying to stir us
[59:00] back to Catholicism or back to Luther or
[59:03] Wesley or even
[59:06] Pentecost oh no we're Eagles we got our
[59:09] high we got our eyes higher than all
[59:11] that we're not like the vulture yeah you
[59:14] know the vulture does he flies around
[59:17] looking for an easy meal on the side of
[59:19] the
[59:21] road right but we're called to soar
[59:26] I heard brother talking about that eagle
[59:29] and there never was a time that I go
[59:30] through Cincinnati and I see that bridge
[59:32] and says Cincinnati up there and you see
[59:34] the signs says Cincinnati Zoo that I
[59:36] don't think about that eagle that the
[59:37] prophet Saul in there and he said when
[59:40] he walked up to that cage he said that
[59:42] eagle had just about beat every feather
[59:44] that he had off of him you know why
[59:47] hallelujah it's because he said he was
[59:49] trying to get out of that cage I'm going
[59:52] to say it again an eagle was trying to
[59:54] get out of the cage and the prophet said
[59:56] he would run and he would jump and start
[59:58] flopping his wings trying to get out of
[1:00:01] that cage he would hit the bars and Fly
[1:00:03] Right fall right back to the ground so
[1:00:05] he was falling but he wasn't climbing he
[1:00:08] was continuing to fall because he's in
[1:00:11] the
[1:00:13] cage I said he's continuing to fall for
[1:00:16] and more why because he's limited to
[1:00:19] where he can go he can't go up to where
[1:00:21] he belongs so he just Falls and he falls
[1:00:25] and he falls back to the ground back
[1:00:27] behind the
[1:00:29] bars Prophet said he would fall back on
[1:00:31] his back and he said there was he would
[1:00:34] look up into that blue sky and he
[1:00:36] Hallelujah he would look up into that
[1:00:39] sky and he said something on the inside
[1:00:41] of him was looking into that blue sky
[1:00:43] and he said something was calling man
[1:00:46] something on the inside of him was
[1:00:48] calling him back to that blue sky oh my
[1:00:51] there was something a deep that was
[1:00:52] calling to the deep that was trying to
[1:00:54] get back to where he belonged
[1:00:58] that he'd been captured and put in a
[1:01:00] cage bound up and the cage you can't fly
[1:01:05] you can't fly if you're bound you hear
[1:01:08] me he said oh I love the way the prophet
[1:01:10] says it and then here is an eagle
[1:01:14] looking at a caged eagle and this Eagle
[1:01:18] looks at that eagle and he says if I
[1:01:20] only had a key to open up that cage he
[1:01:24] said I would let him out of that that
[1:01:26] cage oh if I only had the key to let him
[1:01:29] out in other words if I had a key I
[1:01:32] would restore him back to what he's
[1:01:35] called to do I would restore him back to
[1:01:38] where he's called to be if I had the key
[1:01:41] oh Hallelujah I want to tell you that
[1:01:43] God has sent us an eagle in this age
[1:01:46] with the key of Revelation that unloosed
[1:01:49] you out of your denomination out of your
[1:01:51] organization he opened up the prison
[1:01:54] bars of Catholicism amen and they give
[1:01:57] you the ability to fly back to where you
[1:01:59] belong
[1:02:02] at did you know that an eagle can lose
[1:02:06] his identity if he's caged up too
[1:02:10] long listen this if you cage him up too
[1:02:14] long if he's locked up too long he
[1:02:18] becomes dependent oh preach with me
[1:02:20] right here he becomes dependent on his
[1:02:24] handlers he becomes dependent on easy
[1:02:28] things he becomes dependent on what's
[1:02:31] handed to him besides what he fights for
[1:02:34] that's revealed to
[1:02:36] him he gets dependent on the easy things
[1:02:39] of life because he's just handed to him
[1:02:42] and he don't have to search and he don't
[1:02:43] have to soar and he don't have to hunt
[1:02:46] are you hearing me somebody I said he
[1:02:47] don't have to hunt and he don't have to
[1:02:49] soar and he don't have to search and he
[1:02:51] becomes dependent upon what preachers
[1:02:53] say or what man says or organization
[1:02:56] says and what's he do keeps him bound
[1:02:58] [Applause]
[1:03:01] up he don't fight no
[1:03:04] more there was an eagle that was in a
[1:03:06] zoo that had been locked up for quite
[1:03:07] some time and finally they said you know
[1:03:10] it's time to let him go so they got up
[1:03:12] that morning the handlers went down
[1:03:14] there and opened up the door and all of
[1:03:16] a sudden that eagle seen that door come
[1:03:18] open and you know what it did he hopped
[1:03:21] outside the door and when we got out
[1:03:24] there he hopped around for a little
[1:03:26] while and turned right around went right
[1:03:28] back in the cage oh my yeah he turned
[1:03:32] around and went back he looks around for
[1:03:34] a minute went right back into that cage
[1:03:36] do you know why he lost his identity he
[1:03:39] lost his identity he got used to the
[1:03:42] bars he got used to not flying he got
[1:03:44] used to Easy Come on somebody he become
[1:03:47] comfortable in the cage he become
[1:03:49] complacent in the cage and he settled
[1:03:51] for what was handed to him besides
[1:03:53] getting out and digging for a real
[1:03:54] Revelation from God's word and praying
[1:03:56] and being sincere and becomes dependent
[1:03:59] on everything that's given to him I say
[1:04:01] God help us tonight may we never get to
[1:04:04] that place may we never get so
[1:04:06] restricted may we never get so bound may
[1:04:09] we never get so comfortable that we
[1:04:11] forget what he's called us to
[1:04:14] be
[1:04:16] amen thank you Lord Do You
[1:04:20] Realize David didn't know it but he was
[1:04:23] called to be a giant slayer amen it's
[1:04:26] what he was called to
[1:04:28] be but what if David would have never
[1:04:31] went to the battle what if David would
[1:04:34] have stayed at home in the nest yeah
[1:04:37] come on come on he would have never
[1:04:39] fulfilled what God called him to be
[1:04:41] think of it think of everything that
[1:04:44] David had to go through to finally get
[1:04:46] on that Battlefield with the giant
[1:04:49] listen it would have been a lot easier
[1:04:51] just to stay home and watch Daddy's
[1:04:52] sheep look out for bears and look out
[1:04:54] for lies and and take care of the sheep
[1:04:56] can you imagine how much easier would
[1:04:58] have been David Goes Down to the battle
[1:05:01] and said when he got down there he said
[1:05:03] that Goliath's bow fell upon the wrong
[1:05:06] set of
[1:05:07] ears think of the things that David had
[1:05:09] to overcome just to get on the
[1:05:11] battlefield to soar David had to soar
[1:05:14] over some things his brothers tried to
[1:05:17] discourage him his king tried to
[1:05:19] discourage him go tried to discourage
[1:05:22] him fear tried to stop him reason tried
[1:05:25] to stop him Common Sense tried to stop
[1:05:28] him because to the human eye it looked
[1:05:31] totally impossible to be able to soar
[1:05:34] over this
[1:05:36] obstacle come on and you know what
[1:05:38] Israel was doing Israel's Army was
[1:05:40] looking at David the way that the
[1:05:43] Philistine Army was looking at David and
[1:05:46] you know what Israel was thinking poor
[1:05:48] little bitty David great big giant poor
[1:05:52] little bitty David great big giant but I
[1:05:54] want to tell that ain't the way David
[1:05:56] was looking at it David wasn't looking
[1:05:58] through Man's eyes but David had soared
[1:06:00] up into the heavens and he was looking
[1:06:02] through eagle eyes and he was looking
[1:06:04] through God's eyes and David was
[1:06:06] thinking oh my poor little giant great
[1:06:09] big God poor little GI great big God
[1:06:13] poor little goli great big
[1:06:19] God had David settled for being David
[1:06:23] Daddy's Shepherd he would have never
[1:06:25] become God's Overcomer you know why his
[1:06:28] calling was higher than
[1:06:31] that but why why would God put a boy in
[1:06:35] that kind of a danger I'll tell you why
[1:06:38] because David was just as safe on the
[1:06:41] battlefield as he was in the back
[1:06:44] field watching his daddy's sheep but
[1:06:48] when you look through chicken eyes and
[1:06:49] vulture eyes and and look through the
[1:06:52] things that are Earthbound you don't see
[1:06:54] through the eyes of God but Through The
[1:06:56] Eyes Of God this is what David's called
[1:06:58] to be oh could not be takeen the time it
[1:07:01] would fill us to speak about Moses and
[1:07:03] how he went from the Wilderness of the
[1:07:04] father-in-law's tent down to the
[1:07:06] judgments of Egypt how we could talk
[1:07:08] about Joseph he went through the
[1:07:10] security think about of Daddy's tent and
[1:07:12] now he's put into pontier prison what's
[1:07:14] God doing stirring up the
[1:07:17] nest Daniel went from a place so high to
[1:07:21] the Lion's Den look at Ruth she goes
[1:07:25] from a place place a comfort in her
[1:07:26] Homeland where she knows everybody she
[1:07:29] knows everything but what's God do God
[1:07:31] stirs The Nest up and when the old man
[1:07:34] dies now it's time to move on but I want
[1:07:36] to tell you if God's calling you to
[1:07:38] something higher he'll put a desire in
[1:07:40] you to be able to follow what he lead
[1:07:42] you to God wants you to go higher God
[1:07:44] wants us to be able to soar and if
[1:07:46] you're called to soar God will give you
[1:07:48] the nature of an eagle to
[1:07:50] soore
[1:07:52] Lord right from the very beginning of
[1:07:55] the book look God tells us I'm going to
[1:07:58] deal with my people the way that an
[1:08:00] eagle does her
[1:08:01] young it's profound the way that he
[1:08:04] deals with them you realize an eagle his
[1:08:08] eyesight is so Keen in the middle of a
[1:08:11] night he can see a rabbit move over a
[1:08:13] mile away
[1:08:16] yeah poor
[1:08:20] rabbit an eagle has than spiritual
[1:08:24] incredible vision
[1:08:26] yeah when it would be dark to every
[1:08:28] other bird and the Darkness would cause
[1:08:30] them not to be able to make out where
[1:08:33] real food is at that's not the same with
[1:08:36] an eagle they see things that other
[1:08:38] birds cannot see they believe things
[1:08:41] that other birds cannot believe what
[1:08:43] would be totally impossible for any
[1:08:46] other bird an eagle has the ability to
[1:08:48] see and believe amen do you realize that
[1:08:51] when an eagle mates he mates for life
[1:08:56] once they find their true mate the
[1:08:58] reveal word of the hour once they find
[1:09:01] their true mate it's to death do them
[1:09:04] part and in this case is you're an eagle
[1:09:06] even after
[1:09:08] death when an eagle mates it mates in
[1:09:12] the air it does a beautiful dance as it
[1:09:14] goes so high it mates in the air catch
[1:09:16] that their offspring is conceived in
[1:09:20] Heavenly
[1:09:23] places hey Glory so they come from the
[1:09:26] heavens they're born upon the Earth but
[1:09:29] after they're born on the Earth they
[1:09:31] return back to where they was conceived
[1:09:32] at am man they go back to where they're
[1:09:35] called to be at and may I say every
[1:09:38] Eagle of God is Born the same way we are
[1:09:41] conceived in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:09:45] [Applause]
[1:09:46] [Music]
[1:09:47] [Applause]
[1:09:49] Jesus it also makes me think if an eagle
[1:09:52] conceives several thousand feet in the
[1:09:55] air
[1:09:55] you don't have to worry about it
[1:09:57] cohabitating with a
[1:10:00] [Music]
[1:10:04] chicken
[1:10:05] right I'm just going to leave that right
[1:10:07] there for
[1:10:09] you he can't cohabitate with a buzzard
[1:10:12] or any other bird do you realize an
[1:10:15] eagle cannot be crossbreed with no other
[1:10:18] species you may cross spred a dog you
[1:10:20] may crossbreed a horse or a cow but you
[1:10:22] can never do that to an eagle in order
[1:10:24] to be able to make with the eagle you've
[1:10:27] got to get in the sphere aen where eagle
[1:10:30] soar
[1:10:31] [Applause]
[1:10:33] at they find their ma in it's for Life
[1:10:35] couldn't we learn something couldn't our
[1:10:38] young people learn something from an
[1:10:39] eagle under no circumstance should a
[1:10:41] Believer ever marry an
[1:10:47] unbeliever anybody know what you call a
[1:10:49] female eagle think about this a cow bull
[1:10:54] cow is heer
[1:10:55] deer Buck D donkey Jack Jenny chickens
[1:11:00] roosters hens but what do you call a
[1:11:03] female eagle I'm going to tell you you
[1:11:05] may never heard it but I'm going to tell
[1:11:07] you yeah you know what they call them
[1:11:18] Eagle I said they call Eagle it's Mr and
[1:11:21] Mrs eagle and God's telling his people
[1:11:25] I'm going to deal with you just like the
[1:11:27] eagle does her young think about it
[1:11:29] watch how he raises the N watch what the
[1:11:32] eagle does whenever it has young do you
[1:11:34] realize an eagle never builds its nest
[1:11:37] on the ground that's right I can say it
[1:11:39] better than that it never builds it eye
[1:11:41] level with everything else so they build
[1:11:44] it in high places or what we're talking
[1:11:46] about Heavenly
[1:11:49] places do you realize when the
[1:11:52] Eagles when it has little
[1:11:57] Eagles the eagle is born in high places
[1:12:02] therefore its sight is not like
[1:12:05] everything else it's born to view things
[1:12:08] from a certain point of view oh it sees
[1:12:12] from an elevated place and an elevated
[1:12:14] position because that's where it's born
[1:12:16] at and I'll say this when you get born
[1:12:18] again God does the same thing with you
[1:12:21] you do not view things the way that
[1:12:23] chickens do or the way that editors do
[1:12:25] or the way that lines do or Hawks you
[1:12:28] view it from an elevated
[1:12:31] Place amen I don't care what family you
[1:12:34] come out of when you get Born Again by
[1:12:36] the spirit of God you view things
[1:12:38] different you see things different
[1:12:40] things look different whenever you're
[1:12:41] born in Heavenly
[1:12:43] places Paul said it like this in
[1:12:45] Ephesians 2 and6 and he hath raised us
[1:12:48] up together he has raised us I want to
[1:12:51] tell our father has been raising us he's
[1:12:55] been raising you since the time that you
[1:12:57] hatch out upon this Earth and what's he
[1:12:59] do rais you up together and made us to
[1:13:03] sit together in Heavenly places in
[1:13:06] Christ
[1:13:07] Jesus
[1:13:09] amen before an eagle lays its
[1:13:13] eggs there's got to be preparation
[1:13:16] before there's egg laying you know what
[1:13:18] she does she flies around looking for
[1:13:22] branches looking for sticks look looking
[1:13:25] for
[1:13:26] Thorns to build the nest out of so
[1:13:29] before the egg ever hatches
[1:13:32] Hallelujah the birth is planned amen
[1:13:37] amen thank you Lord the birth is planned
[1:13:42] and this Eagle builds a huge Nest some
[1:13:44] of them 7 feet round men Zachary's been
[1:13:46] watching some Eagles out of dor a we
[1:13:48] watched them for several months now they
[1:13:50] started just so small and now they're
[1:13:52] they're quite big and I watch as that
[1:13:54] eagle Nest it is so big and how that
[1:13:57] them eagles they got room to run around
[1:13:59] in the nest and they got room to move in
[1:14:01] the nest but you know what's odd you
[1:14:04] hardly ever see the mother in the nest
[1:14:07] she comes in she brings the food she
[1:14:10] pulls it apart she feeds her young cuz
[1:14:12] that's the word of God man shall not
[1:14:14] live by bread alone by every word that
[1:14:16] proceedeth out of the mouth of God beak
[1:14:18] to
[1:14:20] beak but she stays out on the branch so
[1:14:23] when the eagle builds the Nest he finds
[1:14:26] sticks and Limbs and Thorns don't miss
[1:14:29] this so the nest itself is a collection
[1:14:32] of branches and Thorns of the Eagle's
[1:14:36] journey of building this Nest so if you
[1:14:39] want to know where the mama eagles's
[1:14:41] been look what she's making the nest out
[1:14:43] of so it's a historical record of her
[1:14:46] journey making ready for this
[1:14:50] moment it's a historical record that's
[1:14:53] putting things together for the right
[1:14:55] moment and the right time and the right
[1:14:58] age that when you get here he done said
[1:15:00] you was going to come and he's already
[1:15:02] ready there's a historical record of
[1:15:05] eagles just like you sons of God just
[1:15:08] like you that he's made ready for this
[1:15:11] moment
[1:15:13] amen amen there Thorns sticks there
[1:15:17] testimonies of where she's been amen
[1:15:20] amen it's testimonies of what she's been
[1:15:23] through the thorn
[1:15:25] is a
[1:15:26] testimony of what she's
[1:15:33] overcome I'm going to say that again The
[1:15:35] Thorn is a testimony of what she's had
[1:15:38] to overcome to be able to build this
[1:15:40] Nest to lay these eggs come on somebody
[1:15:44] as she gathers the sticks and the Thorns
[1:15:47] she don't just come down and just throw
[1:15:49] them anywhere in the nest but when she
[1:15:51] lays the sticks She lays them in the
[1:15:54] right kind of order she strategically
[1:15:56] places them with the sharp ends pointed
[1:16:00] out the nest you know why she does that
[1:16:03] because if an enemy would tried to come
[1:16:05] in he's got to get past the thorns and
[1:16:08] the sharp sticks to get into the nest so
[1:16:11] it is a defense mechanism that's built
[1:16:13] into that mother Eagle to make sure that
[1:16:16] the eggs are safe in case a predator
[1:16:18] tries to get in unaware or climbeth up
[1:16:21] some other way and tries to get into the
[1:16:23] nest she protrudes the sticks on the
[1:16:25] outside so that mountain lines you
[1:16:27] realize a mountain line will not cross
[1:16:29] the Thorns Bobcats will not cross the
[1:16:33] Thorns so the eagle uses the
[1:16:35] Thorns as the protection Glory Glory
[1:16:39] Glory I said nothing gets around the
[1:16:41] Thorns the only way oh I thought about
[1:16:44] this a couple weeks ago the only way to
[1:16:46] get around the Thorns is you got to be
[1:16:48] born on the right side of the
[1:16:51] Thorns I said you got to be right Born
[1:16:53] on the right side of the thorns if
[1:16:55] you're born on the wrong side don't plan
[1:16:56] on getting into God's Nest you got to be
[1:16:58] born on the right side of the Thorns I'm
[1:17:00] talking about the Thorns that he wore
[1:17:02] that day at Calvary that made a way for
[1:17:04] every Son of God to be born again you've
[1:17:06] got to be born on the right side of the
[1:17:11] Thorns once the eagle a babies are
[1:17:15] hatched there's something that takes
[1:17:17] place that is crucial right at the birth
[1:17:20] of an eagle you realize quickly an eagle
[1:17:25] must be able to identify and bond with
[1:17:28] its mother when it's first born they
[1:17:31] actually have a term for this and it's
[1:17:32] called filio imparting listen at a
[1:17:36] biologist that watches and studies
[1:17:38] Eagles what they said about the time of
[1:17:41] the filio imparting they said a newly
[1:17:44] hatched eaglet has a lot to learn about
[1:17:47] the world around it and I say
[1:17:50] Amen the most important figures in his
[1:17:53] life are are of course the
[1:17:56] parents boy I'm feel like preaching
[1:17:58] right now come on on an eaglet must
[1:18:01] quickly be able to identifying bond with
[1:18:03] them instead of another species all
[1:18:07] right this parental recognition is known
[1:18:09] as filial
[1:18:12] imparting in
[1:18:13] Eagles fil imparting impr printing often
[1:18:18] occurs by learning to
[1:18:22] recognize the parents vocalizations
[1:18:26] so Hallelujah so an eagle learns the
[1:18:30] voice of its parents Hallelujah think
[1:18:34] about it an eagle when it is born there
[1:18:36] is a signature behind its parents voice
[1:18:39] there may be some other eagles that
[1:18:41] comes by but I want to tell you there
[1:18:43] ain't none like the mother Eagle there
[1:18:45] may be other birds that comes by but
[1:18:48] there's an imprinting upon this Eagle
[1:18:50] that it actually learns the voice oh
[1:18:52] Hallelujah remember that John tells us
[1:18:55] in St John 10:27 my sheep hear my voice
[1:18:59] and I know them and they follow
[1:19:03] me no wonder Jesus says faith cometh by
[1:19:06] hearing amen amen again the biologist
[1:19:10] says birds can also
[1:19:12] imprint on their nesting site which can
[1:19:15] help them find their way back so were
[1:19:18] you Nest at uhhuh all right you might
[1:19:22] hear me were you Nest at that has a
[1:19:25] great importance on that little Eagle's
[1:19:27] life because if you Nest them in the
[1:19:29] right place under the right teaching
[1:19:32] under the right voice under the right
[1:19:34] word under the right message there will
[1:19:36] be an imparting and imprinting upon that
[1:19:38] little Eagle that when they get older
[1:19:40] they'll know how to find their way back
[1:19:42] amen they can come back to the place
[1:19:44] where they
[1:19:49] left he said the territory later on and
[1:19:51] the guide their choice and nesting sites
[1:19:54] for their own own
[1:19:57] young Proverbs 226 train up a child in
[1:20:01] the way that he should go and when he is
[1:20:03] old he will not depart from
[1:20:08] it again the biologist says in iglet
[1:20:11] grows another type of imprinting
[1:20:13] occurs Hallelujah in which they learn to
[1:20:17] identify with eagles as a species this
[1:20:20] blows my mind they have to know and come
[1:20:23] to the recognition of who they
[1:20:26] are in other words they begin to know
[1:20:30] they are an eagle they are is this
[1:20:33] incredible after around preaching rising
[1:20:35] of the sun talking about the eagle in
[1:20:36] the barnyard all of these years these
[1:20:38] biologists are saying that if you put
[1:20:40] them down there whatever they rais
[1:20:42] around imprints them they'll think
[1:20:44] that's what they are they'll think
[1:20:45] they're a chicken they'll think that's
[1:20:47] the way they got to live they'll think
[1:20:48] that's the way they got to eat so
[1:20:50] somewhere in that Eagle's life they have
[1:20:53] to know that they are an
[1:20:56] eagle so the more he's around to other
[1:21:00] Eagles come on somebody light has no
[1:21:03] fellowship with Darkness the more they
[1:21:05] are around other eagles the more he
[1:21:08] recognizes what he is he identifies with
[1:21:11] eagle ways he identifies with how an
[1:21:13] eagle flies he hears an eagle's voice he
[1:21:16] sees what an eagle is Mama's got a beak
[1:21:19] and I got a be Mama's got talents and I
[1:21:21] got talents Mama's got wings and I got
[1:21:23] wings he comes to the recognition while
[1:21:26] he's still in the
[1:21:30] nest he simply looks at Mom and Daddy
[1:21:33] says that's what I
[1:21:35] am I said you can look at other eagles
[1:21:37] you can pick up the word and look at
[1:21:39] other eagles you say that's what I am
[1:21:41] that's exactly what I am if they can SAR
[1:21:43] I can SAR if they can have faith I can
[1:21:46] have faith if they can believe I am what
[1:21:48] they
[1:21:49] [Applause]
[1:21:51] are I'm an eagle whatever he is is
[1:21:55] identified in the one that raises him
[1:21:58] every attribute that she has the eagle
[1:22:02] has amen watching these little
[1:22:06] Eagles there comes to a place in that in
[1:22:09] that nesting life at first it's such a
[1:22:12] safe place the Eagles get used to the
[1:22:15] nest they sleep in the nest everything
[1:22:16] they do they feed in the nest everything
[1:22:18] they know is Nest that's all they know
[1:22:20] is Nest until he starts growing and
[1:22:23] maturing
[1:22:25] and he starts outgrowing the environment
[1:22:27] that he started
[1:22:30] in I said sometimes you got to go higher
[1:22:34] come on we cannot stand with the same
[1:22:35] experience that we had and go back and
[1:22:37] lay the foundation Foundation again
[1:22:39] we've got to move higher God's G us
[1:22:41] Wings we got to
[1:22:43] fly there Comes A Time in that Eagle's
[1:22:46] life let me close with this they call it
[1:22:48] fledging fledging the mother Eagle
[1:22:53] knows it's dangerous if the little
[1:22:55] eaglet stays in the nest too long she
[1:22:58] knows it's a dangerous place if they
[1:23:01] stay too long or if they don't stay long
[1:23:04] enough premature fledging occurs if the
[1:23:07] nest is influenced by human
[1:23:14] activity you may hear me so it's
[1:23:17] dangerous if you get around too much
[1:23:20] humanity and looking at too much
[1:23:22] Humanity it imprints something upon you
[1:23:25] and it's a dangerous thing if you leave
[1:23:27] the nest too early and your experience
[1:23:29] ain't where it needs to be at and your
[1:23:31] prayer life ain't where it needs to be
[1:23:32] at you get in this place of fledging
[1:23:34] where you leave too early premature
[1:23:38] fledging if the eaglet gets disturbed by
[1:23:41] human activity it can cause the little
[1:23:43] Eagle to leave the nest too early and if
[1:23:46] it leaves it too early it can die
[1:23:47] anybody hear me tonight so then there's
[1:23:50] a proper season amen there's a proper
[1:23:54] season sees him that the eagle stays in
[1:23:56] the nest for a while he needs the safety
[1:23:59] of the nest right I call it the
[1:24:01] blessings of the nest but there comes a
[1:24:04] time that the Bible said that she's got
[1:24:06] to stir up the
[1:24:08] nest and when she stirs up the nest
[1:24:11] listen now the very place that was such
[1:24:14] a blessing such a wonderful thing the
[1:24:17] place of complete Security from every
[1:24:19] enemy cannot get to where it's at that
[1:24:21] place of Total Protection you real when
[1:24:24] a storm comes up and that mother Eagle
[1:24:26] sees the eaglet down there in that Nest
[1:24:28] that she actually takes her wings and
[1:24:30] spreads it over her young and she hides
[1:24:33] them from the
[1:24:35] Storm come on because the eagle can't
[1:24:38] fly yet and she knows if it can't fly
[1:24:40] that the storm's going to scare them but
[1:24:42] if the eaglet knows that Mama is
[1:24:44] watching and that the wings is over them
[1:24:47] they can take the rest in
[1:24:49] safety
[1:24:51] amen thank you Lord but the stirring of
[1:24:54] the n is the season to fly listen now
[1:24:58] it's time for the eagle to learn how to
[1:25:00] hunt on its own pray on its own believe
[1:25:04] on its own amen it can't learn this why
[1:25:06] it's still in the nest it's got to be
[1:25:08] able to fly and God is saying this about
[1:25:10] Jacob and God is saying this about
[1:25:12] Israel that he's got to come and stir up
[1:25:14] the nest listen they could not remain in
[1:25:17] Goan and be in The Inheritance at the
[1:25:19] same time so God has to send Moses now
[1:25:22] to stir the nest up amen right and now
[1:25:26] the prophet is saying this about the
[1:25:27] church think about it we can't abide
[1:25:30] here forever because our inheritance is
[1:25:33] not to be Earthbound our position is in
[1:25:35] Christ and he's letting us know it's
[1:25:37] time to fly so what's God going to do
[1:25:40] stir up the nest you know what she does
[1:25:44] she takes the sticks that was protruding
[1:25:47] outward and she turns them around to
[1:25:50] where they're sticking on the inside and
[1:25:52] the Thorns now which was covered up by
[1:25:54] the rabbit fur and covered up by the
[1:25:56] sheep skins and whatever more that's in
[1:25:58] the nest she takes and she pulls all of
[1:26:00] that out of the nest yeah that's right
[1:26:03] man Zachary seen it just the other day
[1:26:06] one of them Eagles that we watch on
[1:26:07] YouTube the decor eagles one of them
[1:26:10] loves to lay down the
[1:26:12] nest we was watching the other day
[1:26:15] whenever it got on top of a thorn and it
[1:26:17] jumps up oh Lord God have
[1:26:20] mercy it was laying there so sweet and
[1:26:22] just laying there how beautiful it was
[1:26:24] and about that time it moved a little
[1:26:25] bit and it stood up in the nest and I
[1:26:27] thought ain't that something God knows
[1:26:29] that we need to be taught to stand on
[1:26:30] our own two
[1:26:32] feet come on somebody so she pulls the
[1:26:35] fur out of the nest and stirring it up
[1:26:38] what's it reveal thistles Thorns pokes
[1:26:41] troubles trials battle after battle test
[1:26:44] after test all kinds of discouragements
[1:26:46] in life and
[1:26:48] discomforts but God knows you can handle
[1:26:51] it because if you don't you'll never
[1:26:53] learn how to stand stand on your
[1:26:55] own we'll just continue to lay around in
[1:26:57] the comfort of the nest and Lounge in it
[1:27:00] but now it's turn time to learn how to
[1:27:02] fly Slumber days is over drowsy days are
[1:27:06] finished when when the eagle stirs up
[1:27:08] the nest do you realize the mother Eagle
[1:27:11] let me clear this she does not as some
[1:27:14] people think she does not shove the
[1:27:16] Eagles out of the
[1:27:19] nest oh no that's pretty cruel actually
[1:27:22] she don't just shove them out of the
[1:27:23] nest that's not the way she does it but
[1:27:26] what she does is to get them ready to
[1:27:28] fly I love this besides bringing the
[1:27:31] food to the nest and ripping it apart
[1:27:34] and feeding the young she'll land on a
[1:27:36] branch just outside the nest a little
[1:27:38] bit and if the Little Eagles get hungry
[1:27:42] enough all right they'll have to
[1:27:47] move to go get where the good food's
[1:27:51] at come on somebody if it's on the nest
[1:27:55] we're going to be in the nest if it's
[1:27:56] out there on the limb we're going to the
[1:27:58] limb if it's at the Cliff of the rock
[1:27:59] we're going to the Cliff of the rock
[1:28:01] listen there ain't nothing more
[1:28:02] important to us than making sure that
[1:28:04] we're fed right and if we got to
[1:28:05] whatever we got to do to get where that
[1:28:07] food is and make sure that we're fed
[1:28:09] right and we're living right and we got
[1:28:11] something good and nutritious to put in
[1:28:14] our lives that's where we want to be
[1:28:16] at God knows how to get us to move he
[1:28:19] knows how to get our attention amen does
[1:28:22] he not know how to get our attention
[1:28:24] attention he reveals thorns and troubles
[1:28:26] and problems listen to this God's
[1:28:28] provided way see how God does testing
[1:28:31] God permits you sometimes to get a
[1:28:34] little worse after you're prayed
[1:28:36] for just to test you amen you know why
[1:28:40] he knows how to get the Eagles
[1:28:44] attention so he starts getting them
[1:28:45] ready some of these Eagles we've been
[1:28:47] watching I watched him today as I looked
[1:28:49] at him this morning when I woke up he
[1:28:51] was out on the edge of the nest working
[1:28:53] his wings I thought yeah you're getting
[1:28:54] ready this biologist says that iglet
[1:28:57] cannot wait to fly out of that Nest it
[1:29:01] takes everything are you hearing me to
[1:29:03] keep us on this Nest it starts
[1:29:06] stretching out its wings and figuring
[1:29:08] out it's got something to be able to fly
[1:29:09] with I watched myo this morning and she
[1:29:12] woke up you know laying sitting there on
[1:29:14] that Branch with her head turned back as
[1:29:15] they do and she turned around she's
[1:29:16] getting ready to leave and she starts
[1:29:18] screaming it was so beautiful she
[1:29:21] screamed one side and then she screamed
[1:29:22] the other and when she did those two
[1:29:24] little Eagles poked their head up you
[1:29:26] know what they started doing screaming
[1:29:28] just like
[1:29:30] Mama screaming just like Mama so
[1:29:33] whatever she's saying they're saying her
[1:29:36] voice is their voice their voice becomes
[1:29:38] synonymous one with the other let's
[1:29:40] stand our feet
[1:29:42] hallelujah praise be to
[1:29:52] God oh I love it don't you yeah think
[1:29:55] about what God does for you and I he
[1:29:58] wants to be able to hear your voice to
[1:30:00] be able to scream I loved it watching
[1:30:03] these Eagles whenever mama was coming
[1:30:05] into the nest before they ever get there
[1:30:08] you're just watching these little Eagles
[1:30:10] and you'll know she's coming because the
[1:30:12] little eaglets stand up in the nest and
[1:30:13] they start crying out and before she
[1:30:16] ever puts her feet in the nest she's
[1:30:19] already screaming to announce her
[1:30:22] approach yeah
[1:30:24] Hallelujah she's announcing her approach
[1:30:27] to the
[1:30:28] nest I hear the prophet say there comes
[1:30:31] a day when it's time to fly and she
[1:30:34] comes down and opens up her wings and
[1:30:35] those little e grabs a hold of her wings
[1:30:38] and she takes them way up in the air and
[1:30:41] when she goes so high in the air finally
[1:30:43] she knows it's time an eagle an eagle
[1:30:48] can fly 40 miles an hour but when it
[1:30:51] gets high and it starts to dive it Dives
[1:30:54] of speeds over 150 M an hour a golden
[1:30:58] eagle has been clocked at 200 M an hour
[1:31:00] in a dive and I thought ain't that's
[1:31:03] something you know why she can fly that
[1:31:06] fast because when she lets go of that
[1:31:08] little iglet and it starts flopping and
[1:31:11] turning and it's on his back as the
[1:31:13] prophet said one minute it's on the side
[1:31:14] the next minute that little iglet don't
[1:31:16] have to worry cuz Mama can fly faster
[1:31:20] than it can fall
[1:31:26] Hallelujah let's buy our hearts tonight
[1:31:29] our father can fly faster than what you
[1:31:33] can
[1:31:34] fall he's always watching you he's
[1:31:37] always looking over you oh mama takes
[1:31:40] them up on high she's constantly
[1:31:41] watching she's right there in case
[1:31:43] something happens if something would
[1:31:45] take place all she has to do is swoop
[1:31:47] down and pick them up and that's the way
[1:31:50] God does you sometimes he sees us
[1:31:53] sometimes we're falling and we're
[1:31:55] falling and we're on our back sometimes
[1:31:56] we're on our face sometimes we're on our
[1:31:58] side sometimes remember he can fly
[1:32:01] faster than what you can fall that's the
[1:32:04] kind of God that we serve we look at our
[1:32:07] lives and we wonder why we go through so
[1:32:09] much trouble some sometimes so much so
[1:32:10] many problems why is it because God
[1:32:12] knows he's teaching us that we're going
[1:32:15] to have to leave the nest and he allows
[1:32:16] things to poke up to be able to allow us
[1:32:19] to get to the place to be able to F oh
[1:32:22] God help us God help us we don't want to
[1:32:26] view things the way that man sees things
[1:32:29] we want to look at it Through The Eyes
[1:32:30] Of The Great Eagle help me to look at me
[1:32:34] through the Great Eagle
[1:32:35] ey Hallelujah than Lord Heavenly Father
[1:32:39] we thank you
[1:32:41] tonight Lord whenever Moses was coming
[1:32:43] to the end Moses would pin this in the

[1:33:58] attention we're thankful Lord that we've
[1:34:00] heard the eagle cry Lord thank you that

[1:35:19] we spread our wings Lord oh you are

[1:35:27] valley though you were born to Sor the
[1:35:36] sky
[1:35:37] hallelujah or of your spirit into the
[1:35:42] ground so Mount up with
[1:35:47] we
[1:35:50] hallelujah
[1:35:52] hallelujah Hall
[1:35:54] Hallelujah do you realize an eagle goes
[1:35:58] through a stage of a molten period every
[1:36:01] year an eagle goes through a mol period
[1:36:04] and what happens is as the eagle flies
[1:36:07] in the air it gets to the place to where
[1:36:11] its wings it starts picking up dirt and
[1:36:14] oil and it starts spraying its wings and
[1:36:18] whenever the wings become sprayed it
[1:36:20] can't soar like it needs to soar so so
[1:36:23] what happens is the eagle goes down to
[1:36:26] around a valley somewhere in the Cliff
[1:36:27] of The Rock and as he goes through that
[1:36:30] mol period if his wings or his little
[1:36:32] feathers has been frayed he takes his
[1:36:34] beak and he pulls them out they say that
[1:36:37] an eagle can pull out almost 23 of its
[1:36:40] wing of its feathers and at that time
[1:36:43] they say it's such a dangerous time for
[1:36:45] that eagle because he can't fly the way
[1:36:47] that it needs to fly and it don't feed
[1:36:50] the way it's used to feeding so it's
[1:36:52] there in the valley and as it descends
[1:36:54] there in it's such a dangerous time
[1:36:56] because Predators can attack it while
[1:36:58] it's down in the valley the calcium
[1:37:01] builds up around its around its its beak
[1:37:04] its Talons begins to get soar and it
[1:37:06] swells up and it cracks open it can't
[1:37:08] fly and it can't hardly move so it just
[1:37:11] sits there in the valley but I love
[1:37:15] this because it can't feed
[1:37:17] itself other eagles that has been in the
[1:37:21] valley flies over those Eagles that are
[1:37:23] Molen and it drops rabbit and squirrel
[1:37:27] down to those are molting so that they
[1:37:29] can get SP they can get food in Du
[1:37:31] season aren't you glad that God give you
[1:37:34] that thing when you was down in the
[1:37:36] valley God sent you the thing that you
[1:37:37] needed maybe you need a little bit of
[1:37:39] spiritual vitamins May some good food
[1:37:41] maybe a good fresh kill amen an eagle
[1:37:45] never eats dead caring as far as maggots
[1:37:47] and something that's been laying around
[1:37:49] it want some fresh kill so when those
[1:37:52] other eagles knows what it's like to be
[1:37:53] there so it comes down to where they're
[1:37:55] at and it drops little pieces of food
[1:37:58] down to it and what else it does after
[1:38:01] it drops the food down from its Talons
[1:38:03] it begins to scream out words of
[1:38:06] encouragement to those who are in the
[1:38:08] valley friends that's the way it is when
[1:38:10] you come to the house of God you may get
[1:38:12] down you may get discouraged and you
[1:38:14] come in there you may not even feel like
[1:38:15] you can get there you may sit there and
[1:38:17] think you're not going to get nothing
[1:38:18] out of service about that time a servant
[1:38:21] starts dropping one piece of meat after
[1:38:23] another before long you go to eating the
[1:38:24] good things of God and strength comes
[1:38:26] back to you oh my well spread your

[1:40:21] reason why we need each

[1:55:58] somebody and God orchestrated it that
[1:56:01] way because the prophet said it's Christ
[1:56:03] in me helping you and Christ in you
[1:56:05] helping me that's the way aren't you
[1:56:07] glad for that
[1:56:09] tonight so let's do this just before
[1:56:11] we're dismissed let's exercise our
[1:56:13] god-given rights as Sons and Daughters
[1:56:16] of God to lay our hands on one another
[1:56:19] that's a promise of his word he didn't
[1:56:21] say the prophets will do it or the
[1:56:22] Evangelist will do it or the pastor but
[1:56:24] he said these signs shall follow them
[1:56:27] that believe they shall lay their hands
[1:56:30] upon one another and they
[1:56:32] what what not could be not hope so not
[1:56:37] maybe they shall recover well brother
[1:56:40] darl we prayed for so and so and they
[1:56:41] passed God makes no
[1:56:45] mistakes if you accept God's will for
[1:56:47] your life as being perfect whatever
[1:56:49] happened God allowed this in my life
[1:56:51] there's great Grace for that
[1:56:53] friends

[1:56:58] an accident is your family's just torn
[1:57:01] apart in just a matter of minutes and
[1:57:03] sometimes it's days of watching them
[1:57:05] slowly slowly slowly but God makes no
[1:57:09] mistakes I'm so glad tonight to know
[1:57:12] he's got it all in control and sometimes
[1:57:15] when we don't even know what to say our
[1:57:17] heart says it for us because love is a
[1:57:20] language that the brain sometimes don't
[1:57:23] even understand do you believe that
