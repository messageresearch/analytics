[Music] [Music] oh and even though it's humble Lord help my will to crumble oh it costs amen [Music] amen I'm going to read a quote real quick to kind of the people in the audience tonight could touch him with faith till it could make him turn if he was on this platform and say sins are forgiven or your cancer is healed or whatever is wrong with you and I'll tell you about it do you believe that well then he has no hands but our hands he has he's here in spirit form no eyes but ours no ears but ours no tongue but ours so let him have everything that's the secret of this is submitting yourself with Godly love into the hands of a loving father and letting him take you over that's all no hands but our hands oh praise God brother John you got hands up there and he's gonna no hands but your hands right it's yours not just mine so we got to pull on a gift I know you haven't seen me up here in a while it's all right I haven't been up here in a while amen God bless you uh if you would turn with me to Matthew 14. and we're gonna you know I I can remember when brother Nani had the paper notes and he have a stack about like this and he'd take him and he well now we got a tablet it's a whole lot easier to deceive you on how much stuff I've got I've got a lot but we're just going to let the Lord if you pull in the right direction the Lord will take me right he's I'm not here for me so Matthew 24 14 or Matthew 14 24 and while returning let's just go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we love you so much Lord we feel your presence Lord Jesus here right amongst us Lord we're looking so forward to hearing from you Lord Lord Jesus we just submit ourselves to you Lord not only may you Lord but the audience here today Lord Jesus nothing good could be said except you come and use these lips of clay Lord in not only these lips of clay but the ears of clay out in the audience father we pray that you just move Lord Jesus we give you everything Lord I wouldn't be up here if it was up to me but you saw fit Lord Jesus so I pray that you just help us now in your name amen amen Matthew 14 24 but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when he and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straight away straightway Jesus spoke unto them saying be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid and Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but he when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and began to sink he cried saying Lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand they'd call him and said unto him o thou of little faith wherefore this thou doubt and when they were come into the ship this wind ceased then they that were in the ship came and worshiped him saying of a truth Thou Art the Son of God God bless you may be seated so I I kind of had a clue that I might be preaching Monday or Tuesday and I was praying like you're supposed to do and uh Wednesday and I went to bed and I had a dream and it's not super spiritual don't don't get excited I'm not but I dreamed brother Nani looked down and he said you are the wow the wow and so that's what I'm I'm looking at the service and titling that you are the wow and uh you know when when sister Brown died that they said she was looking up saying oh wow oh wow and I tied that together I thought Lord what are you well you are that wow when she said I man I wonder what she was saying I believe she was seeing us she was looking Beyond her circumstance she was looking Beyond where she was at In the Flesh and she was looking past the curtain of time seeing something that made her say wow amen now he says wow you know I'll just give you the definition it says astonished or admiration or a sensational success a sensational success you are the wow brother John oh buddy we can start with you and find out that you are not a successful success we could all look at ourselves and say wow you think you're the wow it's astonishing that you would even think that about you and I I you know and I'll pick on me because I know that in my flesh I am not an astonishing success got a lot of faults I got a lot of failures if I didn't guess what I'd be gone you'd be gone so let's just put it all out there we all know that we're not gone right we're all here right so we know we're not a sensational success here we all know where we're at right all right so here's here's Peter and Jesus and he he's walking on the water now it says uh before this Jesus sent them away to go pray on the other side now I can imagine when he sent he said go ahead and go across can you imagine his disciples going how is he going to catch up with us what is he doing good wait here and he can go on the mountain and pray what what's the but he sent him across so it tells me that Jesus had something in mind he had something there in his mind to say hey go do what I say um how are we going to become that wow that's Mr Brown saw how are we going to do that how is that going to happen in our flesh we're questioning Lord why now what's going on how are you going to leave me and me be successful how are you going to go on the mountain pray and leave me here now this is the part where the nerves go away and the preacher comes out so you pull on the gift foreign and he said and and so the fourth night of the watch and Jesus comes down he's walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were trouble saying you know it is a spirit and they cried out for fear how many times have we confused something good that God is about to do for something scary the Lord is not easy serve the Lord since can sometimes be real scary it can be real scary saying okay right all right brother Keith I want you to stand up and I want you to trust fall into brother Noah as he's standing now right what's wrong with that Joseph you catch my father-in-law he's going to trust for you right it's a scary thing but that's what we have to do every day when we wake up we have to learn to just let ourselves go and fall into his arms we have to learn to just step back and say Lord here I am it's all you I'm not going to do it I don't trust that do you understand what I'm saying so so to get out there go do my work do what I've told you to do and I got this yeah [Applause] you sure about that Lord but that's what we're having to do to become that wild people amen I don't usually get that dry that fast now we're gonna so we're we're finding out that that that trust is the first part of of what God wants us to do he's saying just trust me trust me if you're going to be the wild people you've got to learn to trust me sometimes we can't even trust our wife or a husband or our kids Lord help us we can't trust our kids we got people very close to us that we've seen over and over again come through for us and we have a hard time trusting um but now we've got Jesus in his word and we say we believe right we say we believe we we we don't understand it all but we believe it right but do we believe it um wow wow yeah we're getting there brother sister this is not a service a beat down this is an encouragement service we're getting there I'm learning to trust him more and more and more sometimes it's like oh I gotta pray some more oh this is a circumstance I have got to pray some more right right Hebrews 12 1-11 wherefore seeing we are also we also are compassed about with such a great cloud of witnesses laying aside every weight and a sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the rates that is set before us so he's saying we're running a race we got this stuff we all got stuff all those sins that so easily beset us but in order to win this race in order to become the wild people I'm gonna have to start putting some of that stuff down we're going to have to set that stuff aside all those things that are holding us back those things that are that are keeping us from A Closer Walk it's hard to get down and pray when you've got something in your back pocket that's just not right [Applause] [Music] it's hard to get over that hurdle yeah and if it's a if it's a mistake and you do it once that's one thing but these besetting sins I've overcome a besetting sin about a 100 times you know what I'm saying this is the last time this is the last time I'm gonna have a problem with this right come on but I will tell you there's an overcoming power that's living in you to make you the wild people yeah those besetting sins are going to be by the wayside today might be your day right now might be your time but you have to trust that the Lord is going to take those things away from you I don't care what it is people don't understand what a demon is or how that it can possess you um we'll settle down on that just a minute people don't understand what a demon is until you get delivered from one you don't even realize that you've got this thing hooked on to you and it's following you around and it's pulling on you and it's tempting you and it's bothering you it's always in the back of your mind but once you get delivered you start walking towards that wow it's amazing it's a life-changing experience and sometimes it's not some preacher casting it out it's just the word coming forth sometimes it's just you hear in the word and accepting it and Trust falling into his arms we are a wild people and now right now it's manifesting it's coming to pass Brother John [Music] I've heard this the Lord's coming I've never seen it like this I've never seen the spirit of God moving on the people more than right now don't get left [Applause] learn to trust [Music] learn to trust I didn't I guess since I didn't look at the clock I don't start my time until now I'm just kidding lay aside every weight in the sin that which so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross so the scripture before he was talking about your been setting sins and he told us look unto Jesus you know this is the Charles Spurgeon he went to a I think it was a Methodist Church and the minister preached on look to Jesus and that's what changed his life wow so simple but he was a young man of 14 I think it was in and here we go he was 14 years old and he had he had some questions his his brothers were ministers he was his father was a minister he grew up in church but he he knew something wasn't right it wasn't settled and he went into a church and he sat down and this man preached look at look to Jesus how simple is that that man tore England apart because he looked to Jesus what a simple thought we get in trouble and we look to our phone we look to Google what do they say about things about it on Facebook let me put it out there it amazes me my kids say Dad you could text faster if you could use two fingers I don't like the text in the first place why should I change I had a big keyboard and I was doing this before yeah I'm I qualify as that generation and and everything else he he was worried about where he was at anybody here right where am I at he was worried about what he was going to become all the answers are simple look to Jesus it's a simple concept it's a hard thing to do amen but it's a simple concept look to Jesus hmm yeah I'm not going to get about that's five minutes and I ain't even that's two scriptures for consider him that endures let me go back up the author and finish of our faith who for the joy that was set before him so let's put Jesus in or or God in a race right he knows what the joy is at the end right think about it in that context looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross look into Jesus he knew what was coming it's like I get tore up the minute he brother Donnie asked me to preach it tore up I get nerves and it's nerves nerves nerves until I get up here and I start saying now I'm having a good time because once that anointing comes it's a whole different story yeah right yeah but we're looking unto Jesus and Jesus saw what the end result was going to be we got to quit concentrating on this stuff down here it is a mess you can get depressed in 2.5 seconds if you look at the news and what's even scary is you can get depressed faster if you look at your circumstances because all the hell is against the wow [Applause] but that's not what we're looking to hmm if we're consider him that endures such contradiction of Sinner against himself lest he be weary and faint in your minds ye have not sorry that's enough of this ye have not resisted unto the blood striving against sin and you have not and ye have forgotten extortation which speaketh unto you as children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him so when we get corrected we ain't supposed I know you've heard this but have we heard it when we get rebuked we're supposed to look under Jesus yeah I've seen some rotten parents in my time you know how they're rotten parent I know they're rotten parents I've seen their rotten kids there's none in here you all are angels but that's the truth of it you think man that kid needs a licking yeah boy heck that kid ain't gonna spank himself hmm yeah right [Applause] so the lord loves us enough to whoop us [Music] I've got four kids I'm not going to do anything just relax boy some of them needed a little firmer hand if I could put it that way than the others it's just their nature that's just the way they are but they still got a firm hand when they needed a firm hand hmm some of us yeah some of us Brad Gilbert needed a firm I'm just kidding buddy he'll get me later don't worry he's my buddy some of us need a little firmer hand yeah and some of us need different discipline some of them I had to spank other ones I had to take stuff away and my daughter was perfect [Applause] [Music] that's what happens when you only have one but but all of us we need different things in our lives to to pull that out because we're all born with different natures what we're trying to do is become the wow we're trying to be the wow of Heaven man sometimes it's painful but we still are going to be the wow of Heaven [Music] so brother Brown says everything is looking the Ford company is looking to make a better Ford the Chevrolet is looking to make a better Chevrolet Phoenix is looking to make a larger and better town the nation is looking for more territory so it can spread itself the church just the church is looking for members but the bride is looking for the coming of the Lord oh my God the bride is looking for the coming of the Lord no matter what the cost no matter how hard it is no matter what we go through yes we got our eyes on the prize believe it or not I used to run a lot maybe that's why I don't do it so much now I got all mine out of the way but the thing that we I I used to wrestle so we would we would run four miles wrestle hard for two hours and then run eight more miles that's why I got the physique I got today but the thing I learned about running is if you run like this you're going to wear yourself out and probably run into a wall but you gotta look up look towards the goal look at the promise look where you're going and then to get into better shape you think yeah we're going to take the advice from this guy but to get into better shape we used to run my high school if you ran four times it was a mile around the halls but that last lap that you had to do when you were the tiredest and the most wore out and absolutely didn't think you could take one more step that's when you put in your mind and you said I'm going to run harder and faster than I did the whole time and you sprint your guts out you push yourself until you cannot go anymore you absolutely got to find it down in the inside of the inside of the inside because your legs are falling off your wind is nowhere to be found but if you can dig down just ask any real good athlete but if you could dig down and really just say I'm going to do it and push yourself it run hard and make your legs move the next time you run it's a whole lot easier you got to push yourself we're towards the end of the race we're at the end of the race and if you push yourself this last lap not come dragging I watch my my nephew run across country and them dudes I saw one give so much that he could not he fell across the finish line done They Carried him out of the way so he wouldn't get trampled because he wanted to win so bad that guy gave everything now for us we're running this race we're pushing as hard as we can our legs feel like they're going to give out but we're not looking for inner well our Inner Strength we're looking to Jesus for that inner strength we're going to become the wow people just a little further last week I had a dead stop and it's not fun let me let's go to Galatians five five and seven says ye did run well who did hinder you that you should know not obey the truth this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you this ain't God I used to struggle years ago coming up and praying for people I used to think I'm a minister I'm called to do it I'm supposed to do it yeah but I used to struggle thinking oh they're going to think I'm trying to make something out of myself that persuasion was not of heaven right right amen that wasn't of heaven and how many times do we find ourselves holding back oh I would I would Shout but I don't want people to think something of me think about it is that persuasion of you letting go and letting God of God that sounds so counterproductive why would he fight against what he wants [Applause] think about that you're running real well in the service you're pulling on a gift you worshiped you've put everything you have and the Lord says let go and let God and then you want to pull bags and the dawn I'm just shy I'm not saying you have to worship like I worship or somebody else does but if God leads you to do something amen what does that persuasion holding you back you did run well come on yeah you did you you ran really well what's hindering you what's hindering you in your worship uh oh what is holding you back from letting go is it your fear of Pentecost is it your fear of your neighbor if your neighbor doesn't want you to worship like that they're not part of the wow [Applause] is that right God said worship me don't hold back why you did run well finish the service out well let's worship him let's praise him let's give him watering and and worship water the the the the word with our praise what's hindering you every service should be a camp meeting service [Applause] why because I'm preaching brother Donnie no because he's here [Applause] it's not the man behind the desk it's The Man Behind The Man [Applause] that's good and it's not the man sitting in the Pew it's the man sitting in the Pew behind a man sitting in the pew you did run well look unto Jesus this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you a little 11 11th the whole lump you can't just put a little yeast in there and not expect it to rise so the devil's job is to come in and plant any kind of something that's going to hold you back so what's the devil's goal he wants to be worshiped right so if you're worshiping the true and living God do you think he wants that to happen so he's going to put whatever he can in front of you to hold you back a little 11 11th to hold up I don't care if you think your hair is messed up and it keeps you in your seat or you're afraid that you're going to shout too loud one way or the other if God can or the devil can keep you from worshiping he's going to do it yeah he just needs a little Evan that's right you just needs a little hesitation just needs a little something holding you back good we're the Wild Heaven there's nothing going to hold us back the wall of Heaven there's nothing holding us [Applause] oh I have confidence and confidence in you through the Lord that you be that ye will none otherwise minded but he that troubles you shall bear his judgment whosoever he be hmm so if your neighbor comes to you and says I'm telling you this out of love I think you got a little excited and if it was god pushing you and God asking you to worship like that and God doing that and the next time you come in church and you hold back worried about that uh oh then there's two people in trouble you because you let the leaven and him because he put the leaven or her or whomever it might be right brother John you might scare the visitors come on if they're the wow it ain't gonna scare them if that's the wow it ain't gonna scare him you go on the street and start doing it and it scares them but here this is where we're supposed to do it this is what he called us to do I said it before this could be camp meeting every time we come every time I'm trying to pick through some of these here so Pentecostal people do you see that that's you these others can't believe in that they have nothing in them to believe with but the trouble of it is you've got you've got it and don't know it if the devil if the devil can get it and he can hide it from you and not let you know you've got it then he's got you licked if the devil can hide from you that you have got it the wow factor we heard a wow factor if he can hide that from you then you start doubting your experience and you start doubting your praise and you start doubting all this stuff and it's like you're still the wow but you're more like a well you're not a wow anymore you're just a well oh well now if you're a wow You'll become a wow but that chastening part good luck because he's going to get it out of you you're going to be a wow and if you're a wow and you're acting like a well then you're going to be in trouble I am not even getting close but the trouble is you've got it and don't know it if the devil came if you can get it and he can hide it from you and let not let you know you've got it he's got you licked see you can't fail there's no way of failing you're Abraham's seed God has sworn with an oath that he take you in amen there you are he made his Covenant Hallelujah he's the one that made that promise he's the one that made the Covenant he said you are my wild people and you will be my wild people and guess what you're going to be that [Applause] if I promised you that I I could you know give you a million dollars you better start doubting real quick if I promise you that I could get you into heaven you better be questioning my uh intention I'm not a TV evangelist bye I'm not promising you anything on my Merit I'm not that stupid yeah but God made the Covenant he made the promise he said I will have a wild people yes now if the devil can hide that from you then you're you're lacking in your experience you're not getting the full benefit just like me coming out being nervous nervous nervous coming out and now under the anointing the nerves are gone and so I'm gonna liken that to to where you're at you've got to get past your nerves you've got to get past your questions you gotta you gotta every time never fails I get back there and I start looking at my notes and I think oh no too simple Lord are you sure this is what you start questioning start doubting start getting in your own head yeah yeah some of you ain't gonna like this but I'm gonna tell you anyway I coach baseball my little boy's Little League I'm not a good coach I'm just a coach I've got other coaches that are coaches I'm not real fundamental or know all the tricks and know all this stuff I got I got Ryan Kennedy who played baseball for years I got another guy who who pitched and got drafted and blew out his arm so it ain't no baseball I'm just the guy that deals with the parents [Laughter] they yell and scream at me and I go yeah get up there to pitch it's happened a couple games ago kids never played but it's got a good arm it's pretty pretty throws pretty hard well it's a whole lot different throwing in the bullpen practicing than it is when you're in the game now follow me so this kid gets up there ball ball take your base and he's looking over at me that's a lie I I'm never like that anymore it's pitch ball so this guy loads the bases and by this time he's going take me out coach take me out please so I have to go out to the mound and I've had this speech with more than one picture I look him in the face and I said I'm not taking you out coach I'm through I'm walking everybody you're a pitcher I'm walking you're a pitcher but I'm not throwing very many strikes you're a pitcher do you think I'd put somebody who wasn't a pitcher on this mound do you think I'd put somebody there that I thought couldn't do it do you think that I'm going to put you just to embarrass you but coach I can't I said do you think I know know what I'm doing then I point to the Oakland do you think they don't know what they're doing are you questioning our decision making you are a pitch a pit Go Let It Go once they get out of their own head once they can settle back down they start throwing strikes once they start recognizing who they are once they start recognizing they just go and they throw the ball so sometimes coach comes up to the mound and you feel like you're just walking everybody you cannot seem to hit the target what a sin missing the target missing the mark and you can't seem to settle in and you've got all this doubt and all this fear and all these questions so God has to come down Brothers if you come time's up so God comes down and he whispers in your ear you are the wow you are my bride you are the one that I've placed lady I see you've got a special place in this last day and I trust you wait a minute but John I thought you said it was about trusting God it is but he's got to trust you too otherwise he wouldn't have put you here right are you questioning what God has done are you questioning what God has called you to I got the scripture here but you know the the the the the madman of Galleria right after God cast all those Devils out or Jesus cast all those Devils out put in his wife you know he wanted to follow Jesus but that wasn't the position God put him in he said I need you here witnessing here right now maybe you're not here behind the desk maybe you're at school even homeschool some of you homeschoolers got a witness to your little brothers and sisters maybe you're at work yeah maybe you're like Paul and giving out money like crazy these loans it doesn't matter you are the wow but a little Evan a little doubt a little fear a few balls and you're starting to doubt Where You Are you're starting to doubt Who You Are you're starting to doubt who you were called to to be wow you are the wow we have circumstances in our lives that we question we have problems in our lives that we don't understand but we're going to get in that position right where God put us he put us in Lady of sea for a reason he said that you're more than enough you are capable trust him because he's trusting you if you feel like you're missing the mark over and over and over again look unto Jesus you can question a lot of things but I will tell you you cannot question God he knows exactly what he's doing [Music] he knows exactly where he puts you he knows exactly what he wants you to do he knows exactly how he wants you to praise trust him you are the wow we are manifesting what God's called us to be it's happening we've got a lot of naysayers we've got a lot of people thinking this world is crazy we got people marrying pizzas we can look at all those things or we can look with eyes of faith look to the promise look to what he's called us to throw our shoulders back we're at the end push push [Music] push [Music] we are Overcomers no devil or demon in hell can stop us those affirmations brother Donny's been preaching about those rights it's coming into play right now brother John is it okay if we miss the mark well no you got to repent and you've got to move on everybody do it wow everybody does it we all fall short Paul fell short yes brother Branham fell short amen brother Donnie falls short oh man we could go on we could name every one of you sorry but that doesn't take away the fact that we are the wild people spell our heads oh Heavenly Father how we love you Lord Lord Jesus sometimes we we get in our own heads Lord sometimes Lord we start doubting and questioning Lord there Comes A little leaven in our in our hearts and our heads Lord and we start reasoning it out and we start questioning Lord Jesus Who We Are oh but father we're looking unto you the author and the finisher of our faith we know what you promised you said you'd never leave us comfortless Lord you never leave us nor forsake us you said you'd help us overcome Lord I pray that you would just help us father may we be encouraged Lord Jesus
