========================================

preach what does he say Don't just show me signs don't just show me dreams don't just tell me about Visions don't just tell me this happened to you and that happened to me but tell me what you preach and what you believe amen praise the Lord this is the way we judge all preachers is by what they say now the real test then if the prophecy is true sure they can prophesy thus sayith the Lord this is going to happen and that's going to happen and it might happen exactly right but is their message of what they're going to say because we know that those signs are to get your attention as a matter of fact the prophet said that Divine Healing is the bait on the hook how many y'all's ever been fishing before so do you throw the bare hook out in the water say come on fishy fishy come on I want to catch you I want to eat you for lunch so what do you do you want to find what the fish are biting on today they might bite on this tomorrow they might bite on something else and you want to hide it if it's something if it's a spinner bait or whatever it is something that'll glisten and be able to catch a you know a Trout's attention or whatever you're trying to catch you don't want to show him them triple hooks that's on there you want those hooks to be hid as much as possible well Satan knows exactly the same thing so Satan will come in and he'll throw a bait a spin in bait way out in the middle of religion and water splashes up everywhere and here goes this person there goes another one there goes another oh oh my this is wonderful this is awesome but they don't try to check them by the word oh they say oh this is so great this is so wonderful my grandmother got healed and and my aunt got healed praise the Lord your grandmother got healed but what's that fisherman trying to say once he catches you right that's what's important amen and the youth said amen amen amen thank you and you old guys too thank you for those amens now watch in Deuteronomy chapter 18 verse1 15 now this scripture is is it's like one of the Messianic Psalms in the Book of Psalms and other Psalms that can have a compound meaning and a compound application now listen as God is going to tell the children of is is through Moses Deuteronomy 18:15 the Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy Brethren like unto me unto him ye shall hearken now this is a Messianic prophecy speaking about the coming of the Lord Jesus and there's certain attributes of this verse that can apply to Jesus of course only but also he's speaking in a larger Spectrum about God going to raise up one Prophet after another after another that will come down Through the Ages now watch verse 15 applicable mainly to Christ look at verse 16 according to all that thou deliver desirest of the Lord thy God in horb now this is the reason why that as the people of God are called out of the land of Egypt they are the people of God once they come out of Egypt they gain a new title they are called The Church of God because the word church means called out so when they were in Egypt they were the people of God but the people of God in bondage once God calls them out then they are not just any longer the people of God they still are but they are the called out people of God so they are the church in the wilderness now God is going to deal with them in a way that is totally different in the way that he deals with us as far as church and so on so he's giving them a pattern and he said according to all that thou desirest of the Lord thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly saying let me not hear again the voice of the Lord my God anybody remember this setting on on the mount okay let me refresh it it's whenever they're coming out and God tells them Moses tell the children of Israel sanctify themselves tell them to wash their clothes tell them to set a boundary around the foot of the mountain if an ox or or a cow or a human anything comes near that mountain kill them right there because the mountain was Sanctified by the presence of God so when God come down the trumpet started sounding lightning and smoke it must have been horrific the children of Israel were terrified and Moses said he himself did shake and tremble from the presence of God so the people said oh don't let God don't let God speak we'll never live and they were shaking and trembling and and terrified and even the mountain was shaking like a volcano or an earthquake was hitting the mountain God did this for a reason remember horb is the Mount from which the law of God's going to go forth and they asked for the law of God God didn't want to lead them by law they rejected his leadership but God is showing them this is what comes with the law with the law comes fear and judgment and correction and whippings and so on and so on but that was not God's choice that was theirs so when they saw it they heard it you imagine it was mixed emotions like they never felt before they were afraid of pharaoh they were afraid of the task Masters they had all kinds of human fear down in the land of Egypt but no doubt they were experiencing something they had never felt seen or experienced in their entire life so they went to Moses and said please please tell God we can't take this we we cannot stand this if God speaks to us again like this we'll all die we can't take the presence of God so God quotes back to them what they ask according to all that thou desirest of the Lord thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly so now they're coming to church so they're assembling together saying let me not hear again the voice of the Lord my God neither let me see this great fire anymore that I die not they were terrified absolutely terrified so this is what God Said and the Lord said unto me they have well spoken that which they have spoken I will raise them up a prophet from among their Brethren like unto thee and will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name I will require it of him so since the people were to obey God's Prophet without question now listen with without question false prophets then were to be treated if they spoke falsely they were to be treated by the penalty of death because a prophet was supposed to be the spokesman for almighty God now notice in verse 20 but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in in my name which I have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that Prophet shall die you believe that amen now this is how God looks at false prophets oh my let's read in Jeremiah CH 23: 21 false prophets in the days of Jeremiah I I have not sent these prophets I want you to notice that they're in plural form God sent one the devil sent many I have not sent these prophets yet they ran tell me you talking about enthusiasm you talking about a desire to get their message out they wasn't walking they wasn't riding on a donkey they were running yet they ran I have not spoken to them yet they prophesied but if they had stood in my counsel and had caused my people to hear my words then they should have turned from their evil way now once again God is giving us a way to identify the message of a true prophet of God because his message will always without question bring the people back to God's word a true Prophet will never widen the narrow pass a false prophet will widen the Narrow Path and say oh this is not required no more that don't matter no more no no that's that's fine that's fine it's okay everything's acceptable and we're all the same that's a true true sign of a false prophet because a true prophet of God will never widen the Narrow Path Jesus said straight is the gate and narrow is the way and few there be that find it but yet look at the horde of thousands of false prophets around the world today and are they preaching the narath no they're preaching that somehow Heaven has changed its description Jesus described the Broadway as the way to hell but false prophets are saying the Broadway is now the way to heaven so you don't have to even be a Christian According to some of them you can believe Islam and still be a Christian be saved go to heaven you can believe a Hindu you can believe shintu ISM taism you can believe all these things and still be there because we're all going to the same place anyway and you know there's just Jesus is just one of the many doors like the different doors here we have in our church so you know Jesus is just one of them but I would like to point out to you tonight one door in our church that one right there anybody know where that door go that door goes to nowhere because that door is a false door St so when we were building the church and standing back there in the back and looking at it and Carol has a very symmetrical eye and brother Mike walls is trying to figure out how to do all the panels and this and that and Carol sit back there and she said Donnie I'll tell you what's wrong with the look of that and I said what is it woman the woman thou gavest to be with me she said you've only got one door you need another door I said that that wall right there goes to my bathroom I do not want a door going to my bathroom she said a false door so I stood back there and looked at and I thought well I hate to admit it but she's true speaking the truth I mean excuse me there yeah so brother Dave Swanson I talked to brother Dave and you know what brother Dave did he measured this door got exactly the same type of door the same frame and behind that door is a solid wall but yep it got a handle on it and if you notice it's even black where it looks like the door goes somewhere there's hinges on it there's a handle on it but you can't get it open and you can't go in now I told Brother Homer Longoria about that door because I didn't want him to try to go in there since he had never been here before on Wednesday night a few Wednesday nights ago and I said brother Homer I want to tell you about that door and I said thank you my luck i' to tried to R out that door now you see that's what religion is trying to do oh Shintoism taoism you know ISM It All Leads to Heaven it goes nowhere Jesus did not say I'm one of the doors but I am the door to the Sheepfold I am the way not one of them I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh to the father but by me aren't we glad we know that way tonight now you see whenever God gave this identification he knew there would be hundreds and hundreds of years that the people of Israel would be dealing with false prophets notice in Jer Jeremiah 28:15 then said the Prophet Jeremiah unto hananiah the prophet so Jeremiah the prophet said to hananiah the prophet here now hananiah the Lord hath not sent thee but thou makest this people to trust in a lie you see young people why will be so damnable for every preacher that preaches lies and yet convinces people to trust those lies for salvation and God will damn those preachers to Hell me included if I ever get off the truth and the paths of God's word ain't that right no preachers are exempt it's a very serious thing now what do preachers then because of their influence they have the ability to influence people to either trust in truth or trust in a lie so then a prophet could stand up and you know perform signs wonders Miracles whatever is they do and yet then people would find oh my goodness oh my let me just give you an example I said in a tent meeting many many years ago whenever I was in Pentecost and there was a certain man that was in Pentecost quite famous brother Bram actually mention him in 1959 1962 you go to YouTube you can find his name um but anyway I was sitting there Caroline in a tent service and this man called out this woman and did something very very vulgar there in the service I'm i w to tell you what it was but and I I'm sitting there right in the next seat there right behind them and I I'm thinking oh my Lord you've got to be kiding me there's no way this can be right there's no way this can be right this man calls me out after her and her husband sits down he he tells me what I prayed that day the words I said to God and the order I said them in testing one two three I think I lost contact now unless you've ever had that to happen to you you don't have a clue how that feels cuz here I am and I saw this man do something totally totally wrong and yet he called me out and told me something that was irrefutable absolutely irrefutable then what does that make you do that makes you where that you will not question the wrong and you will not question the Miss because you focus so much on the hit oh my goodness but you see I don't want hit and miss I want hit or ning we ain't playing baseball we're talking about people's Souls now you see how it can be then for someone that you know would would even give people what we would call a word from the Lord you know you're going to be healed or this is going to happen to you that's going to happen to you and if that was not a word from God that man is leading them people to trust TR in a lie and God don't like for his kids to be lied to whether it's about their healing whether it's about their Doctrine or whatever it is I mean boy God was really upset at haniah the Lord has not sent thee but thou makest this people to trust in a li therefore thus saeth the Lord behold I will cast thee off the face of the Earth this year Thou shalt die because thou has taught Rebellion against the Lord so William brandom was a false prophet and started prophesying in the 30s in the 40s traveling around the world preached to thousands times thousands of people God justly should have taken the man off the Earth not let him live till 65 not let him become more established and and more renowned and get more influence come on now let's put it to the test of God's word why did God let him live why didn't God take him like he did hananiah why would God let him get established and leave a message and would affect hundreds of thousands of people on the Earth then God treated us unfairly God treated the people in the days of hananiah one way and God treated us another way God allowed a so-called false prophet as the world would call him to preach have signs wonders Miracles even allowing to record tapes and let them tapes be played for years I leave the Earth praise the Lord I tell you what when the Lord give me this the other day I thought I can't wait to get up there and turn that Devil's hide anybody smell him here tonight I love getting him in a corner don't you now come on let's Supply God's word does God love the people in the days of Jeremiah better than he does the people in Tanzania and Uganda and Ghana and Trinidad and all over the world where this message has been God don't love them poor little ignorant children and God would let a soulall false prophet yes sir so hananiah the prophet now I want you to notice the Bible does not even call him a false one so hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month my notice Moses goes on to say now back to Deuteronomy 18:21 and if Thou shalt say in thine heart how shall we know the word which the Lord has not spoken this is a good question is it not how shall we know the word which the Lord hasth not spoken when a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord if the thing follow not now listen follow not nor come to pass now remember prophets could speak of things that would come to pass in their lifetime and then they would also be allowed to speak of things that would come to pass maybe decades or even centuries after they left the world after they left the world so part of what they said would come to pass in their lifetime and they would see it with their eyes other things they would speak in the name of the Lord would not come to pass in their generation or the Next Generation or the Next Generation and so on but their words of Prophecy would follow them even after they left the Earth notice how he said this now when a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the Lord ha not spoken but the Prophet has spoken it presumptuously Thou shalt not be afraid of him all you mean suppos there's supposed to be a genuine fear amongst the people of God about a true prophet's words you see the sad part about it is there's followers of our message that have lost that fear that's why they do what they want to with the message so if they don't think it applies to this say they just don't preach no more I sat down not long ago and and started just making some notes of this certain Church in the message that doesn't preach this no more not heresy but because I've talked to them myself and this certain Ministry and that certain Ministry and they don't believe the way the prophet taught this and the way the prophet taught that I was overwhelmed after about 20 minutes of Great Men great churches great resounding Ministries and yet sorting through what they want and this don't apply well that was only because of the 60s and well brother randam only said that because he had a Baptist background and this so explaining away so where is the fear that the Old Testament produced in that day it's really sad to me now watch's this false prophecy by hanani Jeremiah 28:1 and it came to pass the same year in the beginning of the reign of Ziah king of Judah in the fourth year in the fifth month that hananiah the son of isur the Prophet which was of gibian spake unto the house of the Lord in the presence of the priest and all the people saying thus speaketh the Lord of hosts I want you to notice now he's not speaking in the name of a false god he's not saying in the name of ba in the name of Kos but in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of Israel saying I have broken the Yoke of the king of Babylon within two full years will I bring again in this place all the vessels of the Lord's house now notice his prophecy there's so much of this prophecy that is filled with the message of the hour what you prophesying about Babylon the house of the Lord the vessels of the house the people of the house he's mainly got two things wrong in the prophecy the length of time and the Yoke being broken all the rest of it is message message message message message but the two years sounded much easier than 70 right so what is it a false prophet one way you can always red flag him he's always got an easier way it's always more palatable to the to the non-spiritual pallet that's looking for an easier way out making the burden lighter and making everything easier in life and you know shrinking it down Jeremiah just too hard 70 years oh my that hard man Jeremiah couldn't help that God was the one who said it within two full years while I bring you again to this house the vessels of the Lord's House that Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took away from this place and carried them to Babylon I will bring again to this place jeah the son of jeim King of Judah with all the captives of Judah what message message message message sayth the Lord for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon now you imagine them people sitting there this old worldly and you know like they' got into into that shape anyway and they said man that sounds a lot better to me don't you wow that old Jeremiah always knew his way too hard he gets up there and he just preaches Lord have mercy my toes curl up in my sandals I'm I'm getting why I'm having to wear hard toll sandals to church because he just preaches all over me Lord have mercy I I just don't understand and here comes this pudding Mouse pudding Mouse yeah pudding Mouse creamy pudding hananiah but Jeremiah was more like a chainsaw [Music] Mouse Bo and Jeremiah got done there arms and elbows and ears and toes and mouths laying all over the church everybody just kind of picked all their noses up and all their eyes and hope they wound up with the right one on their face again and mosied on out to the carriage and said I ain't coming back no more are you oh I ain't coming back he's too hard so the devil said ah this hard preaching opens a door for me so it's all based on supply and demand so there was a demand among the children of Israel for a prophet now remember they didn't want a general they wanted a prophet so Satan said ah I've got the man you're looking for can I introduce to you from Houston Texas hananiah himself and his way is so much easier he's so much more likable than Jeremiah and Mo and the people said glory to God thank you Lord thank you Lord praise God now if that man's prophet was true it meant that God had gone weak on his word and God didn't really mean what he said God said now you got to do this and you got to do that got now God said no no really I mean I realize nobody can't live that no more that ain't my God that ain't my God so you see a prophet sent by God is never wrong and what he says from the word of the Lord will always come to pass 1st Samuel 3: 19 and Samuel grew and the Lord was with him I love this scripture and he did let none of his words fall to the ground and all Israel from Dan even to berseba so this is from the northern part of Israel to the southern part that they possessed from one end to the other from Dan to berseba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord praise be to God and the Lord appeared again in Shiloh for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord now remember this is not a priest a priest is not made this way this is not a pastor I'm not made this way evangelists are not made this way I'm made like this I have a subconscious and a first conscience in order for me to contact my subconscious I must must go to sleep I will fall asleep close my eyes I will go into the deep sleep and once I'm there however long it lasts I may dream dreams my dreams most of mine are probably like yours as crazy as they can be I've had a few spiritual Dreams yeah they need no interpretation whatsoever so whenever I'm there I will dream this and then whenever I come out of it lot of times I remember you know how dreams can be and then other times I come out it's just all jumbled up in my mind but there's parts that you'll dream and it can be fearful I've woke up out of Dreams before and I've had a reoccurring dream since I started being a preacher I don't tell you what that reoccurring dream is it's a dream that I'm always smoking a cigarette that is a nightmare right so I'm smoking a cigarette thank God I ain't had that dream in a long time probably have it tonight now I'm talking about it because your dreams are affected by what you're talking about what you're thinking about so I I'm smoking a cigarette and somebody from the church or some preacher friend of mine will come up and catch me at that cigarette and I'm trying to get rid of that cigarette and trying to hide my breast and trying to now you know you say why in the world would you dream such a thing I've never smoked a cigarette in my entire life I'm way too old to start smoking one now so you thinking what is it about it so but a prophet his subconscious and his first conscience are like this God move move them so close together a genuine Prophet is a special creation of God he's not like other men so he God could let him break into a vision and he would stand right there with his eyes wide open in a WRA or a p t condition wrapped r a p t which short abbreviated term for Rapture you see we have to have a Rapture in this age this is one reason why we needed a prophet that would be able to be R A into the mind of God to catch the word and bring it down to us to produce an r a p t u r e for us Church age Messengers Luther Westley Pentecost done a great day great thing in their day but none of them were R A into the realm of God to catch the word needed praise the Lord Jesus notice now God when whenever this Samuel was known and identification remember that the people of Israel wanted a king so God said all right if they want a king I'll let them have one it's not my choice I I want to be their King but if that's what they want to make the story short you remember that Saul his father had Lo lost some donkeys and they couldn't find them so Saul and a servant went out to be able to find him and we'll pick up there chapter 9:6 and he said unto him behold now there is a city and a man of God and he is an honorable able man all that he saith cometh surely to pass now notice this is an identification of a true prophet of God now let us go per Adventure he can show us our way that we should go now a four time the Bible says they were called a sear s e e r sear why because they would see then said Saul to his servant but behold if we go what shall we bring the man for the bread is spent in our vessels there's not a present to bring to the man of God what have we and the servant answered Saul again said behold I have here the ham a fourth part of a shekele of silver that I will give to the man of God to tell us our way and before time in Israel when a man went to inquire of God thus he spake come and let us go to the sear now this was the reputation of a prophet of God so it wasn't just a preacher it wasn't just a man that went around and held campaigns but this was his identity now you know if you've studied much on the time frame of Israel witcraft idolatry and a lot of this stuff is going on during this t same time frame in the land of Israel so you can imagine what a real prophet of God was called in that day a witch a sser necro romancer another Hebrew word so here God sent a prophet you understand what Satan was doing coping mimicking what God was doing you remember whenever saw some years later went down to the witch of Endor and Samuel had died by that time the blood of Jesus had not been shed so Paradise was down this way and Samuel died and went down into Paradise kept right next to hell and whenever the witch of indor went he said who who would you want me to bring up and remember that can happen today so he said Samuel the prophet so she goes through all of her rituals what was it demonic power this woman had given her soul over to the control of demons so here she breaks into that Supernatural realm and she said you are so you are so why don't don't fear don't fear I'll spare your life she said I see an old man he said what does he look like so she described him and it was Saul she was able by this power to call Saul out of paradise and Saul spoke oh my goodness Samuel excuse me the prophet called out of paradise and Saul there backslid and yet the prophet Samuel told him tomorrow night by this time you and your sons will be with me did it happen this woman was no prophetess she was a witch you see how Satan loves to do this is why we have to be on our watch we have to be so careful in the time that we're in no wonder Jesus said there'll be false prophets and the prophet preached it false anointed ones at the end time oh brother scares me to death no need for us to be scared we know how to judge we judge by the word Judge Me by the word judge by the DAR by the word inter to the preachers the word is what we're judged by Praise the Lord right same with you that's the way we are known now watch in verse n again before time in Israel when a man went to inquire of God thus he spake come let us go to the sear for that is now called a Prophet Was Before Time called a seir 2 Samuel 24:11 for when David was up in the morning the word of the Lord came unto the prophet dad David's sear so notice what a prophet was now David was a great king and David himself was also referred to as a prophet but not a sear you see David could received the word of the Lord in format of songs and Psalms ASAP was also a prophet who wrote part of the Psalms but not being a Seer you understand now god notice in 1 Chronicles 9:22 all these which were chosen to be Porters in the gates were 212 these were reckoned by their genealogy in their Villages who whom David and Samuel the seir did ordain in their set office so now remember Solomon already had the direction through a prophet of God Samuel and his father the king it's going to be years before the house of God's even going to be built but God was so particular and he showed it by a prophet of God so a prophet of God receiv received the order of worship before the Tabernacle was ever built glory to God think of it Samuel was done dead and gone before the temple was ever even built but God gave the order and the ordination of how they'd be Porters at the gate who will be here this one will do this this and will do that and God gave that church or if you want to call it that way he gave it to who the prophet of God and to David 1 Chronicles 29:29 now the acts of David the king first and last behold they are written in the book of Samuel the sear and in the book of Nathan the prophet any of y'all ever read that book the book of Nathan the prophet and in the book of GAD the sear any of y'all ever read that book me either now the rest 2 Chronicles 9:29 now the rest of the acts of Solomon first and last are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet and in the prophecy of aijah the shilonite and in the visions of IDU the sear wow against jeroboam the son of nebat now look how God has always used Sears and Prophets to guide his Kings to guide his leaders don't you understand as a pastor God knew like David I needed the guidance of a sear but God knew I would not live the sear would not live long enough and I would not live in his time frame well I was born in 1956 he was still here but I was just a 9-year-old boy whenever he passed but God Made A Way so our church and other churches around the world could be worshiping under the counsel and guidance of God Seer if we will only take what he had to say well praise the Lord my my 2 Chronicles 29:30 close here momentarily moreover he Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the Lord with the words of David and of ASF the sear ASA the SE so whenever you go to your Bible and you open up there in your Bible if your Bible is like mine Scofield or different ones they will have it written at the top a song of the psalm of David you know written by so and so whenever David was doing this or that but and some of them it won't say of David but it'll say of ASF so God was giving Asaf and Asaf was a Seer and they sang Praises with gladness and they bowed their heads and worshiped so they're singing their praise their Church order or whatever you want however you want to refer to it it was given under the inspiration of a sear of men of God that receive from the Lord oh Lord that's the way I want ours to be let me read another can I just read you a couple more before we go now watch how God worked in the realm of vision with these prophets Genesis 15:1 after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram now this is under his old name but he always was a prophet his his name is not Abraham but Abram after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision not in a book not in a book but in a vision this is the way the Bible the Old Testament was written by the word of the Lord coming to prophets in Vision form now unlike mine and your dream which can be so jumbled up and so mixed up this is what people don't understand about a prophet that when a prophet receives a vision a word from the Lord in Vision format that is infallible it don't need our opinion added to it now I want you to notice so there was nobody there to check out Abraham's Vision now Abraham I'm going to check you out by the Bible there was no Bible but God gave him his word in the form of a vision now remember keep in mind different from you and I our dreams can be all jumbled up they can be totally messed up but because a prophet's first conscience and subconscious lay like this God can attach himself to that and it will be a perfect projection from the mind of God into the channel of that man and he can stand there and thus sayeth the Lord by tomorrow bread will be sold in the city of Samaria for such and such and there'll be such and such and so and so and there was some old lepers just happened to believe that word of the Lord and the very next morning it come to pass exactly as the prophet of God said because God projected from his own mind and that Prophet caught them thoughts of God and spoke it into existence do you understand God's prophet of this Agee said there will be a Rapture so from the mind of God the thoughts of God and he was able to say it there will be a Rapture and he said it over and over again and there will be a bride ready you believe what you want to about that I don't think it's just comments it's done been spoken so let it be done it will be done at the right season there ain't enough devils in hell to stop it from happening our our laziness our sorriness our mistakes our shortcomings there ain't nothing going to stop God's spoken word from coming to pass aren't you glad let's Stand Together praise the Lord praise the Lord and after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding in great reward now this is all the word that he had for a long long time years no Bible no daily devotion no nothing like that just God's word praise the Lord let me read this one to you numbers 12:6 and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you I the Lord will make myself know known unto him in a vision and will speak to him in a dream now God didn't say that about a pastor God didn't say that about an evangelist or a teacher but a prophet of God so how shall we know if this message that we are following if this is a true Vindicated prophet of God or not well we look back in the word see what the word said when he come did he broaden the way the way false prophets did did he beg us for money the way false prophets did did he bring us the easier way the more acceptable way when you look at the sign of the false prophets in the Old Testament it's pretty plain and it's pretty similar to where we are today thank God for the truth let's bow our heads together praise the Lord Heavenly Father how we thank you tonight for your word Lord Jesus these precious things that you've made known to us in this last day and it lays right in your Bible dear God how many scriptures have we looked at on this one question over and over again from Genesis PL over to the Book of Revelation your choice your means by which you would reveal the word of the Lord was a Vindicated prophet of God being your mouthpiece we thank you for that father we thank you for every one of those true prophets that have stood down through the span of time and given the word of God to the hearts of your children then Satan would come in with a a whole slew of false prophets behind them offering other gods and other names alternative ways that was pleasing to the flesh easier more acceptable and there was an element of Israel that followed that and they went to their Destiny but there has always been a genuine people who held fast to that word of God may we do the same father I'm afraid as we go on in time there will be more ways that will be introduced Among Us ways that many will succumb to they will be overcome by false prophecy maybe even some by signs wonders and then the message that will follow will be off the beaten path of Malachi 4 Lord God I believe it has been spoken and you will have a bride that will be faithful to your word oh Jesus make may that be so of our church dear God don't let it be said about our church in 10 years 15 years 20 years if time should last yeah that was a that was a message Church years ago I remember being there in youth meetings and I I I remember going there their meetings annually and all the youths would gather there at the Banquets and they had such Services there but now alas they don't they don't preach that no more may it never be said about me that they Pastor there his name is Donnie Reagan and he used to preach the message but somebody's told me now that he's got older he's got soft or may it not be said that the guy who who actually was there he passed away and now they've got younger men and those younger men they say are compromisers and they're looking for a Crowd Oh God may it never be said about us that way as long as this is a house of God as long as this is a building dedicated to you may the word of God always be welcome may your presence always be welcome in this place may your Miracles your healing your correction of the word always be welcome here Lord Jesus Grant it father we worship you here tonight Lord we bless your name oh Jesus won't you come even right now Lord I sense your presence maybe there's some here tonight

that was spoke God by the prophet of M thank you so much for that the clarity the clarity and I remember when I first came to the message before I I came to church and I was just searching and looking uh three years three years I studied and I read the message before I actually came to Happy Valley at the time and I was looking for where it doesn't line up so if this doesn't line up show me a more excellent way okay because I could not find I looked to find where it did not line up with the scripture No matter how strange it appeared or seemed or contrary to what my nature already was at 30 some years old where does it not line up and so that challenge is put to each of you as well where does it not line up okay with whoever you talk to in anybody's opinion really that can be their opinion but it it was studying for three years and I challenge you to do the same because you need that anchor okay and I thank you God bless you all let's pray dear Lord thank you for this grace that you've given to us I thank you for the message I thank you for a profit it is so obvious that it's needed in this day and I thank you Lord for your life most of all and revealing yourself opening
