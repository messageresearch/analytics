confidence in today and no without a shadow of a doubt it hadn't lost one bit of his power amen and even brother branham told us he said take a look even at the morning star see how it glistens and it shines and it shouts and he said hadn't lost one ray of his glory and he said what about a believer amen you're not going to diminish and fall away lose all your glory oh no we are morning stars to shine forth the life of jesus christ the darkened world we're not getting less and less we're getting greater and greater we're not getting weaker and weaker we're getting more powerful and more powerful we're morning stars shine morning stars herald the coming of the day we are here in the hour for the day and the hour of our lord's return and we want to thank god for his goodness and his love and mercy to us amen what a wonderful savior that he is i was just thinking as you have gathered and enjoyed this meeting together with us thinking about the many that here are the church home folks that has worked together to try to get your meals together and try to help out in different ways um help me with the ministry and my and my home and you know i'm not much of a cook and my cook went to heaven so um some of these earthly cooks that kind of picked up the this slack and helped me out and i certainly appreciate that i want to just tell the home folks you make me proud amen god bless you each one of you [Music] and we want to just say thank you for all of you that have come and been made this meeting a part of what it is each one of you bringing your lick of fire for the wonderful ministry we'll have brother donny reagan that will be capping this service off by the power of the holy spirit today but as i i thought about what we are identified with i can hear brother branham say this and it just rung in my heart he said i was surely identified with him in his death and i was identified on the first easter i raised with him from death identified with him in his death i was with the 120 in the upper room i was identified with them hey i feel religious oh my i was identified there i was one of them i was identified i got the same experience they had i was there when it happened to be a true christian i witnessed the mighty russian wind coming i witnessed that i felt the power of gods and shook i was with them that spoke in tongues i felt the anointing come in there i was with them i was identified with them when the holy ghost began to speak through tongues with them i was with peter before the critics in acts 2 when he preached that great sermon that he did i was identified with them and i with him yes sir in acts 4 when they assembled together i was with them when the building shook and after the prayer meeting the building shook where they were setting and were identified with him and then he speaks of paul on mars hill and and john on the isle of patmos and luther and wesley but then he said i'm here in philadelphia pennsylvania identified with the same kind of group with the same kind of an experience i must be to be a christian i must be i must stay identified where the word of god is being manifested i'm identified with a group that feels the spirit of god i am identified with a group that knows he's unveiled that knows he's the same yesterday today and forever and knows that this is not fanaticism it is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever all they're called about your heretics the other bunch of finales on account of word but i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ lord is the power of god into salvation and i'm one i have one of them live in epistles that i spoke up vindicated god veiled in human form and men and women god in morphy again the great king laid aside his glory said yet a little while the world has seen me no more but i'll be veiled in them and you'll see me because i'll be in you amen oh my that's where we are today identified with a group of people that still believes he's the same yesterday today and forever knows what it feels like has experienced the power of god in their lives know the change that has taken place you came your argument can't take them out debate will never take it out of them it's sealed in there because they met god themselves and no argument can take that away amen aren't you glad to be identified with him this morning god bless you amen thank you for coming and being a part of this meeting we want to pray for wanda underwood that is on a ventilator ventilator at vanderbilt she's not fully conscious she needs the lord to intervene into her being she needs to wake up there's also a sister kathy guest she has numbness in her feet after the covet and then then there was a request there that came in from some that were seeking the baptism of the holy ghost and i just want to say to you um this is for isabella and natalia that are natalia they're seeking the baptism and and uh been having a lot of trials since they started it started seeking for it but i just tell you if you hunger and you thirst for righteousness you shall be filled that's god's promise to you and the promise is to you and to your children and i don't care how far off in sin you've been as many as the lord our god shall call and he's still calling i'll tell you if i were you i would knock and i would keep on knocking i would ask and keep on asking i would not give up until i surrendered everything to receive what he promised for me amen father in the name of jesus we didn't ask for hands to go up but i know you know the hearts of the many here today that would say jesus passed by my way lord we have read these requests and some seeking the holy ghost and his promise for them lord some that are desiring healing after covet and lord i i pray god you'll meet that need for our sister and others that are desiring the same and father for all these other situations lord a little sister on the ventilator needs to wake up you're the resurrection and the life there is nothing too hard for the lord i pray god your holy spirit will hover over that bedside lord and breathe life into her the change will begin immediately lord and a

[Applause] thank you it's a good thing i can't sing like that i'd sing all day what a privilege it's been to be able to be together so appreciate the minister and brethren it's it's been here with us appreciate the host pastor brother tim and all the deacons and all the lay folks that have done everything that you've done to make the meetings a success we're so grateful for the presence of the lord wouldn't it be sad if we had gathered like this and we were gathered under some denominational auspices or we'd gather to rally around one person or one theory or one doctrine we've come that we might be able to worship the lord and hear his word and have him to change our lives i don't know about you i didn't just come to be blessed while i'm here i want to take something home with me it'll make me a better a better person it's been such an honor to be here god bless you turn with me today to the book of matthew chapter 17 verse 1. matthew chapter 17 verse 1. we'll read through verses 5 if you would and after six days jesus take us peter james and john his brother and brings him up into an high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them moses and elias talking with them then answered peter and said unto jesus lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make three tabernacles one for thee one for moses and one for allies while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear you him i may love to be remembered today as we pray we'll spy our heads together if you would lord jesus it's with joy and sadness too that we come to the last service of this special time we so enjoyed your presence enjoyed the word the ministry of the brothers enjoy the fellowship of one another the songs it's been an awesome time and yet many of us will head toward home today we'll go our separate ways but it reminds us that one day we will have a great gathering and we will never have to say goodbye hasten that day lord jesus help me i prayed to be able to get out of the way father that you can speak through me something that will be an encouragement a help to your people only you can take a service and be able to custom fit it so every hungry heart will get something i cannot do that lord nor could any other man but it's simply in your hands so we commit ourselves to you in the name of the lord jesus and the saint said god bless you you may be seated thank you i thought that i was ready for today i've studied several things and looked at several things and caroline went back to our place last night and i studied again and again and i was convinced i knew which way i needed to go but this morning before daylight the presence of god came in where i was and woke me up and began to deal with me about what i wish to speak to you about today and i want to use three words going back home going back home and first of all let me say that whenever i or my my friends my brothers here sitting behind me stand and say it's an honor to be able to be with the bride and speak to the bride that's not just words that's not cliches it's not just something nice to say but we really mean that with all of our hearts i counted such an honor and a privilege no matter where i've been around the world to speak to the bride of christ it is highest honor of my life i was raised in kentucky just a little hillbilly boy i never thought i'd probably ever even leave the state going to school i didn't have any friends i was saved when i was 12 years old most of the boys heckled me at school all the time ridiculed me made fun of me laughed at me they'd bring pornographic magazines to school and i would cover my eyes and they would knock me down on the uh the parking lot at school and they would tear my hands away from my face and i would close my eyes and they'd take their fingers and open my eyelids and try to make me look at things that was i knew was not right so the most of my life i wanted friends friends you know real friends and whenever the lord brought me to himself and his grace and then allowed me to be able to stand with what i consider to be some of the greatest men of god alive today and i don't limit it just to these few brothers that are here but brothers of like precious faith around the world so it has been one of the honors of my life to be able to stand and speak to the queen of heaven and looking at that i realize that speaking words most of us preachers that have done it for very long i just turned 65 in july and i've been preaching since i was 18. brother tim's been preaching longer than i have some of these brothers here by the kenyan no doubt longer than i have but you do learn how to talk a little bit anyway after all of those years but you realize it's not what you can say it's not just being able to get words that you think would be a benefit but it's following the spirit of god and following exactly what he knows that we all need and our our setting today is one of a great paradox and in our minds it's probably hard for us to comprehend what it must have been like on this great mountaintop experience after six days when the lord jesus called three of his closest disciples they were of the intimate circle and he calls them up with them and there they go into the presence of god and matthew said he was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as the light now that within itself would have been a phenomenal visitation but then comes moses and elias and they are talking with him how we love mountaintop experiences don't you love them don't you so love when you are soaring in heavenly places in christ jesus and this must have been one of the highlights years and years later as peter is writing his epistle and he says that they were up on the holy amount and he he rewards it the way that he the you remember reading in the scripture beautifully the way he was able to capture it and you can tell the impact of that he never got over it no doubt john never got over it again whenever he was there on the isle of patmos it was something that so marked their lives and yet we know that god never ordained that his people would live on these type of mountains every day of their life now we have these meetings and we call them special meetings and they are they are special yet we realize that every time we come to the house of god it should be special is that right it should be special now here the lord willing wednesday night evening light tabernacle they will gather together again and i'm not sure who's going to be preaching wednesday who the special singers will be but yet we know those of you that have streamed any of these services just from the local assembly you know that this is a great church have a great ministry great music great singers it's just a great place that's all there is to it but yet really part of what makes this meeting special too is because you visitors are here as well so special meetings aren't just that well even like tabernacle hosted this and they are such a special people and such a special ministry and such special music and special special special so whenever we go home we go back to our churches and we don't have that special no actually that's not the way that it is actually each one of you visitors have had have helped make this a special meeting is that right each one of these speakers that have come those of you that have driven and spent part of your livelihood you have made that a special thing but there's something about us as human beings that we love special things in our lives and there's special places that we all like to eat and there's special things that we like to do and there's let's just be honest there's preachers that we like to hear that seem to minister to us in a special way it's not that we really love them any more than others but god has somehow connected us with their gift and they just seem to minister to us in such a way well it's just beyond our explanation really and they will always have a special place in our hearts is that right now that's that's just being honest today there are special things that god gives us each of us have had special experiences with god some of them we can share some of them we cannot share they are given to us just between us and our master so there's something about us that we have an inclination to lean towards special things special occasions special people special mountaintop experiences all but alas we know that even with the life of the lord jesus after he left this great place of this mountaintop experience and what a life-changing thing that this must have been but yet whenever he comes down from the mountain from walking in this great thing and it was a prefigure of the great body change that he was going to have actually the lord jesus allowed his body to experience what it was going to be like when he raised from the dead on that third morning now think he elijah and moses appear as well and here we see a glimpse of the future kingdom we see the glorified son of god we see the resurrected dead we see the transfigured dead and then we see the mountain those men there on the mountain and then at the bottom of the mountain we see people outside of the kingdom gates that do didn't even have an idea what was going on so it was a pre-figure of the glory of god now you think after something that great happened could there ever be any trials after that could there ever be any hardships after that now oh my how we have fed this week on the word how we have rejoiced in the presence of god some of you probably ain't stood in church this long and god only knows how long you couldn't even sit down you were so caught up in the presence of god it was awesome was it not but after today we're going back home now i guess the important thing that i would like to ask you about it is what are you going to take back home with him now while i've been here i've had an older sister in my church to pass away within 30 minutes or so her daughter passed away i have a double funeral to do on tuesday night how am i going to leave and preach that funeral all elated and jumping up and down the way i was here friday night probably not am i going to be so carried away with what i received and i'll go grab that family and tell them oh you would have been in louisiana oh hallelujah to god glory to god no their hearts are so broken can you imagine losing a mother and a sister within 30 minutes time you see the great mountaintop places that god allows us to have are many times preparing us for the weeks that we'll follow now i know we don't like to hear this and believe me i didn't want to preach it but i've learned to follow my boss he's got great plans and great benefits but if you don't obey him his hand can really hurt when he whoops you so i've learned a long time ago it's best to follow him some of you no doubt have come to this meeting you came with great burdens you left a husband at home that was not where he needed to be with god you left with issues on your job you left with issues in your church you left with family problems marital problems and although you have got touched and helped and ministered to no doubt some of you when you go back home those problems will still be there and the truth of it is there may be more once you get back home so what are we going to take with us when we go back home what are these meetings going to benefit us as the people of god so are we going to lose our joy are we going to lose our ability to stand and tell that preacher seek him boy seek him are you going to be so sad when you go to your church wednesday night that the preacher can't even get an amen out of it you know i find that many times people they look at their own home church and they say our church ain't nothing but we either we don't do this at our church and we don't do that at our church and oh my people come to a meeting like this where a host church is hosting a great meeting many folks want to go home and pack everything they've got and move to that church because they think that's the normal every every church service well let me just give you a rude awakening that is not the way it is [Applause] hallelujah see what you got me into sir they were shouting last night now they're pouting now you see people saying that that atmosphere is is allowed to be there no no no friend now i'm not saying that even in life tabernacle they have tremendous services regular service is tremendous but there's something special about special meetings and yet the people many times that will attend them then they go home today brother andrew glover will be preaching at happy valley but andrew glover will be missing part of happy valley's amen corner you know why they're here part of the people who would have normally pulled on brother andrew are not there today they're sitting over here they're sitting over here they're sitting in different spots one thing that makes a meeting like this it's so paramount is each of you bringing your lick of fire with it and bringing it together and our expectation my you could feel it from the very first night the expectation of the people of god was so high i just wonder how it'd be if we do that in normal services at home [Applause] but you see there's something about these mountaintop experiences oh my we love them notice in luke chapter 9 as luke catches this and he writes about it and he said and it came to pass that on the next day when they were come down from the hill much people met him uh-oh now he had peter james and john they were select men they were men that love god they love supernatural experiences so the very next day after transfiguration you go to meeting people and if you've got people you've got problems you've got a big church got big problems got a little church still got big problems now notice the very next day and behold a man of the company cried out saying master i beseech thee look upon my son for he is my only son and lord spirit taketh him and he suddenly cries out and it tears him that he foam us notice this again and bruising him hardly departed from him and i besought my disciples to cast him out and they could not so here the lord jesus after soaring into this great dimension of god is met with much people much people has many needs of course here he comes with this poor man bringing his son and he's so demon possessed that the young man is foaming at the mouth and the spirit tears him and oh it must have been horrible and he brings him to the disciples now these are the future men of the message they're the men that's going to propagate this message and carry it on so the lord jesus comes straight off the mountain and he hears that some of his men have now failed one of the first tasks so after this great mountaintop experience he's hit immediately with the needs of the people and he's also hit with the failures of those who are the future work of the extension of his ministry right after a mountaintop experience now you can take this the way you want to i believe with all of my heart almighty god is speaking to somebody here today well to be honest with you it's more than one somebody but remember when difficult times come we don't want to throw everything that we have got all the blessings all the encouragement all the joy all the elevation and the presence of god and just lay it aside and say what good did it do me to even go to that meeting he said well if it hadn't been for that where would i have been when this hard time hit me oh my notice this jesus answering said o faithless and perverse generation straight from transfiguration to faithless and perverse oh my goodness guess what friends we're all heading home where was jesus home now as much as transfiguration was a wonderful thing this was what he experienced of course this was the type of glory that he said father i desire to have the glory that i had with him before the world was so this was what he experienced before the logos became a man but since she'd been now a man for all of these 30 years this was now home so home was what dealing with people that were demon possessed home was now dealing with people that fell short of the glory of god home was now people that constantly had it needs and troubles and heartaches and difficulties and jesus had to come down off of the mountain and go back home oh aren't you glad that he did now what if he would have said hey you know what i love this so well i i really don't want to go back home i honestly don't want to leave this shekinah because i've been out of it now for 30 years i don't want to go out of this anymore i love this this is where i came from so peter james and john go ahead and go back down y'all go back down and y'all just do the best you can and just barely hang on or whatever you can do i ain't going back i'm sorry i am not going back i'm so glad he did because he had not died yet he had not given his blood hallelujah what is transfiguration doing it is preparing him for calvary it is preparing him for death and for his resurrection hallelujah notice in luke chapter 9 verse 46 and then there arose a reasoning among them which of them should be the greatest wow wonderful no doubt he said i'm back home i'm back home now here he already had some disappointment because disciples couldn't cast out this devil and then they begin to argue among themselves i believe i'm the best preacher there's more people stream my services than yours ain't it how many of you got streaming yours on youtube anyway well i think there's more people at our church well i i feel what when i got up to sing a special song i believe people clap 13 seconds longer for me than they did when you sing [Applause] yeah we're home come on friends we're still human beings we're still human beings would you care to finish this i'm at home huh oh man i don't know why i get asked to take the last service of these meetings anyway and then there arose a reasoning among them which of them should be greatest jesus perceiving the thought of their heart took a child and set him by him and he said unto them whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the same shall be great can you imagine coming from having your body changed a temporary resurrection a glorification of the presence of god and you come straight from that just a day before and you've got people arguing about i'm gonna be bigger than you are why you are not you've got a big long ugly nose nobody ain't gonna like you why you don't do this and you don't don't tell me i'll tell you one thing they like hearing me preach better than that don't sit there and look at me like that don't go on amongst the preachers it goes on among singers it goes on amongst musicians why because it is home can't you see friend the reason we need a body change is not just to make us all young again we don't need to just be young again we have to be changed our bodies this part of us must be changed oh not you john not you and john answered and said master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbade him because wanted to meetings in louisiana he's not part of our clique [Applause] all of this after transfiguration my goodness something y'all gonna be dragging your tracks in aren't you saying oh dear god i don't want to go home sam y'all just extended your vacation for another week didn't they gonna be here wednesday night [Applause] i think me and carol will stay [Applause] why because we don't like trouble look friends if you're born again it is your nature to love peace you think these men love to preach hard you see any god called man loves to preach hard and whenever god goes to demons you say no lord no i don't want to preach that i don't want to go that way why we love peace and yet we are some of the most profound warriors that's ever been on the earth how do peacemakers become professional fighters it's because that dual nature inside of us we are called to withstand evil we are called to preach the word we're called to help the children of god and yet we love peace we love it john the beloved disciple that leaned over on jesus chest one of the most intimate places and it was given to john but look at john's makeup john answered and said master we saw one casting out devils in thy name we forbade him because he followeth not with us jesus said unto him forbid him not for he that is not against us is for us and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he steadfastly set his face to go to jerusalem and he sent messengers before his face and they women entered into a village of the samaritans to make ready for him and they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to jerusalem and when his disciples james and john here we go it blessed little john again saw this they said lord we'll thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them you want a scripture even as elijah dead straight after transfiguration i got to be honest with you i don't think i'd ever even realize all this happened after transfiguration until before daylight this morning that's the way the lord does though and but he turned and rebuked them and said ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of john john one of the ones who was there look at peter lord it's good for us to be here let's build three tabernacles one for you one for moses one for elijah let's just stay here that's i say that praise god let's all move to brother tim's church what do you say i'll call home and i'll get a bunch of u-hauls and we'll all move here he's in the office now saying dear god no [Applause] oh my goodness so what are you folks that are visitors here what are you going to take from these meetings when you go to your home church wednesday night and next weekend you know many folks and it goes in our around our message that many live from special meeting to special meeting to special meeting to special meeting and if you're not careful our youth can do the exact same thing they go from one youth meeting to another to another to another and then you see some of them same use in their home church they don't even raise their hands they don't stand up you can't hardly get them to do anything well come on now saints why they jump from mountain to mountain to mountain to mountain and is that really what we're trying to build in the message is that what god wants us to be look at these guys were the way they were and we know the reason that they did this they was not born again oh my they did not have the holy ghost yet so do we want whether it's young or old do we want to just live from special meeting to special meeting to great climax after another climax no friend that's not what god wants us to be but take what you've got oh by brother donnie my church they don't jump and they don't shout well take what you've got and if you've got something genuine maybe it'll break out among them well praise the lord remember brother dunham says revival is not you and your church it's you it's you as long as you've got a holy ghost revival whether nobody else there wants it or not you're going to have revival because you're drinking from the water of life going back home some of y'all driving some of y'all flying brother david told me he's leaving out this afternoon at a shreveport flying going to atlanta from atlanta to geneva i think he told me amsterdam then geneva oh i know brother david well enough to know he's going to be packing some of this home and whenever he preaches again there in his congregation you'll be able to see a little bit of louisiana anointing on him you're going to be able to see a little bit of louisiana influence on him why because he's going to take what he received from the mountaintop experience will he have problems and troubles no doubt he will but is he going to let them get him down absolutely not he's going to say i went there i received and i brought it back with me praise god i didn't just bring souvenirs from the us but i brought a new fresh anointing i am that's what you want to do you don't want to just take some souvenirs from louisiana but you want to take a refreshing from the presence of the lord and when satan meets you you say back off the devil hallelujah off devil i receive the freshness from the presence of my lord going back home exodus chapter 32 verse 10 and moses turned and went down from the mount the two tables of testimony were in his hand the tables were written on both their sides the one on the one side and the one on the other were written the tables were the work of god listen now the work of god and the writing so just in case some of you all think you had the first tablet moses used a tablet [Applause] there's no way we can imagine what that must have been like to watch god take his finger i probably wasn't left-handed the way i am but god in the form of humanity right on this it must have been so sacred so holy so awesome you know the story and when joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said unto moses there is a noise of war in the camp and he said it is not the voice of them that shout for mastering neither is the voice of them to cry for being overcome but the noise of them that sing do i hear joshua heard one thing the prophet the age heard something else and it came to pass as soon as he came lying to the cat that he saw the calf what the prophet is in the mountain of god with a mountaintop experience receiving the law of god written by the very finger of god and they're down there worshiping around the calf and they were naked dancing shouting hollering screaming well that works on a pastor's attitude i want you to notice now it came to pass as soon as he came down to the camp that he saw the calf and the dancing and moses anger waxed hot and he cast the tables out of his hands and break them beneath the mount what in the world would cause a man of god to take the only inscription that god had ever written with his own finger what caused it back home you see god meant for moses to visit the mountain but he didn't tell him to pack his suitcase and move up there don't you understand why we're going to love heaven so much we get to pack our stuff and go away no more carnality no more fallen humanity no more trouble no more heartaches no more difficulty we get to pack our soul with the goodness of god and leave our humanity oh my that was born of such desire behind and get a glorious body locking under his glorious body fair he will value well [Applause] friends let's just be honest unless we're changed unless we are so changed to the core heaven would not be a really nice place to live in because some of you would want to live in a certain section and you wouldn't want to get out of that section you'd want to go to this certain spot there'd be neighbors that have tempers and there's there'll be none of that there that day why because we will all be changed not just new but changed james your humanity brother ron mentioned it last night it's so stinkin rotten humanity that we deal with every day of our life i know we don't like to hear it quoted but brother branham said his worst enemy was william branham i wonder how god feels about it when we idolize the prophet's greatest enemy we idolize his flesh we worship him into the message people do they idolize his humanity and make him like god and he said that was his greatest enemy you might as well go ahead and say amen your greatest enemy is not your wife it's not your husband come on preach women out it's not your little boy it's not your little girl your greatest enemy is yourself you are the one that gets in your way you are the one the reason you're not any closer to god today [Applause] you imagine him saying god do i have to go back home i love being here this is so awesome could you do that again could you just let me watch you right i'm not the first man that's ever on the earth but none of them ever saw you right before nobody's ever seen this exceeding great glory moses entered into that pillar of fire the prophet said become god when he come out can you imagine he was so changed they had to put a veil over the man's face because the shekinah of god was all over him in one minute shekinah was there in the next anger and it wasn't god and it wasn't cherubims and it wasn't angels and it wasn't zooms and seraphims that brought out the human agitation it was his people oh jesus people have that about them now for the next few minutes everybody can remain silent you don't have to raise your hand no smiling no friendling no moving so you won't tell on yourself but no doubt there are people here or there's probably some streaming that's what it is that's why god had me to preach this and you poor little sweet darlings are having to sit here and listen i know what it is happy valley's an hour ahead of this they have finished listening to brother ander and there's some sorry person that happy valley that needs to hear this sermon and god made me preach it for them and you poor little darlings for having to listen to it everybody that believes that stand on your head and gargle peanut butter come on friends let's be honest we need help we need help it's our humanity that clashes how many of you have people at work and they know how to push your buttons oh there's people you go to church with dear god i'm going to step outside and say the written rest of it oh there's people you're married to well praise the lord everybody just act like nobody knows what we're talking about okay now the way we've got this we've got this yeah we got it all right right between the eyes but don't you understand sometimes god allows those people in our lives to show us ourselves i used to think god would let people come to my church so i could help them i could really help them but after several hundred i began to wonder if maybe god hadn't sent them so i could be helped [Applause] oh my how we love maytag christians as pastors boy you just install them get them saved filled with the holy ghost hook them up they're there for 45 years they never cause an issue they never cause a problem they're there wednesday sunday they pay their tithes they're there anybody you need to do this and that they're there boy whatever it is they just chugga chugga choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo man they're faithful they're praying for you they don't have an old critical spirit on them every pastor ought to have at least one of them in a church you got more than one you're really blast but the truth of it is when god saves us and fills us with the holy ghost we're not automatic made tag are we but a belt will break and a wheel will slip and a cog will go bad and an electronic gadget will mess up it's not a marvel to me that i could love the lord god my marvel is how he could love me and all my humanity all of my mistakes come on that children oh don't you appreciate his love for you i never i was wasn't a sinner the way some of you were a sinner and never drank never smoke never cussed never run around never done any of that give my heart to the lord whenever i was just a young boy but the lord has had to deal with me much longer after i got saved than the years before i got saved and what have i done for him well it looks like i've already done anything but yet i look at myself and i think god please help me how can you be so merciful and so long suffering remember the bible tells us as the people of god when peter wrote about the seven virtues that was to be manifested down through the seven church ages and the last one that he wrote about was the one that sits right beneath the capstone which is brotherly kindness now don't let that scare you that's a scarecrow that's been put up before the message people but it should scare crows and not eagles that's right brotherly kindness is something that the prophet said must be added to the church i hope you understand that he said the faith of jesus christ the virtue of jesus christ the knowledge of jesus christ right on down to the very end to where he said the brotherly kindness of jesus christ you think why would the lord jesus need that don't you understand why that we need a high priest which can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities i'm so glad today that we still have a high priest on the throne of god that can understand our humanity he understands our humanity the lord jesus himself understood what it was like to be a human i'm so glad today that he's still there on the right hand of the throne of god to intercede for our humanity when we say lord i don't want to do this i don't want to do that oh god we have not a great angelic being setting there but we have a glorified human body [Applause] hallelujah a glorified human body that can remember his own humanity he can remember weakness he can remember pain he can remember heartaches and sadness and disappointment that's your high priest not an angel not gabriel not wormwood oh my paul said there's one mediator between god and man the man the man christ jesus after god spared isaac on mount moriah the great supernatural experience that god made known to abraham and he revealed himself as jehovah jireh what a phenomenal thing god created a ram and the bible says that the ram was caught in the thicket by his horns so the ram of course was ares type of christ he was caught in the thicket the thicket is the briars thorns the brambles the things that have roots in the earth so the ram was caught by a plant which was attached to the earth you you made we're what caught the rad we caught the ramp what is the horns the brother said a symbol of his power we caught the lamb and held him because we needed a kinsmen redeemer i don't think you've ever noticed this or not but the very next chapter verse one the next written word of the further part of abraham's history is this and sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years old these were the years of the life of sarah and sarah died in kurdish arba the same as hebron in the land of canaan and abraham came to mourn for sarah and to weep for her so after this mountaintop experience his dear beloved sarah dies friends you notice well as i do there are things about the will of god that can be so painful you remember the prophet saying i think it was 1951 in one of the life stories and he said father you have broken my heart over and over again but i thank you for it amen the will of god can be so painful when god will take a loved one out of your life a child a wife a husband or a dear friend whatever it is and he's oh god no no no god don't do it please god i beg you and god takes him anyway you said god why would you do that his will can be so painful and yet we believe it's perfect do we know [Applause] all these things that come after great elevations in the presence of god so yeah abraham walks off of that i wonder brother ron had god not revealed himself to abraham in the form of jehovah jireh how would abraham have dealt with such a blow that's this listen to the prophet as he says that this one the wings of a dove one time up in the mountains and watching an eagle and seeing him fly away you know my story of it i said it's good to be here lord like peter we could build three tabernacles but now watch him but down at the foot of the mountain the sick and the afflicted are waiting the lost and the dying are waiting so let's do what we can while it's day and sunday there will be the wings of a white eagle that will come down and bear us away in this sermon brother brown tells us why would he wait to heal me being an old man he's going through this cycle again every seven years seven eighths he says where i am right now 56 years old every seven years he would get this sickness in his body and his stomach all kinds of people would come up and be healed all types of miracles would happen and yet the prophet himself suffering and he sees the lies dove as he'd waited and waited and long to see that dove and in his mind he thinks he's going to be healed but actually he's going to be healed of his humanity not his stomach trouble little did he know that a little bit over a month from this time he would be in a horrific automobile accident many bones in his body broken his poor leg mangled and twisted around the steering column of his car twisted and broken a horrible way to leave this world leaving the meetings at shreveport which was some of the paramount services of his ministry and he thought within himself oh my it's going to come again this is going to happen that's going to happen all it's laying right there it was all right so we come off of that mountain went down into the valley of the shadow of death so friends what are you going to take home with you after the fall meetings of october 21. we've driven in we've flown in we've come from various places we've looked forward to these meetings for months and months great anticipation i don't know about you i wasn't disappointed well you may be after today so when the last amen has said on the last song you start filing out these doors what are you going to take what are you going to take as a souvenir maybe somebody's the first time to lose and he said i want some of that cajun food what do they call them things that the crawfish or something they eat down there them bug looking things i'm gonna try some of that why they call that stuff eight two faith or something like that or them red beans and rice man they tell me oh yeah they are good but we want more than a true faith we want to take something that our faith has risen to a new plateau my haven't these brothers done an outstanding job hallelujah they have they've done a wonderful job look wrong i'm sitting by talking in the office before we came out i said you can tell these meetings are so different than the last time when i was here a couple years ago anyway you can just catch the mind of god and the way he had the ministers to go you know what did that your needs your needs not so much that they chose to go that way but your needs dictated what they preached and it shows where you are it shows that many of you have been struggling it shows that many of you been going to great traumatic times in your life and god said i want my sons to preach faith builders i want my sons to preach things i wanted to give my people something that when they leave and pull off of that parking lot them devils are going to say you better get out of their way you better get out of their way they've got something to take home hallelujah they're going to have something to meet the enemy with tomorrow when monday comes around and tuesday comes around they're going to have something they're going to say satan out of my way hallelujah oh don't we love it whenever the anointing is here i believe any one of these sisters could not preach in this meeting we don't even believe in women preachers a preacher that couldn't preach in this kind of anointing he probably ain't even gone in the first place but you know well enough to know many times that's not when satan hits you it's not when he when all this great anointing is around you but it's when you get by yourself it's when you get back on the job it's when you get back to that husband that ain't right or that wife that ain't right and you say god what am i gonna do what am i gonna do god i'll tell you what you're gonna do you wanna take something home with you today my faith is stronger my confidence in the word of god my courage is stronger i'm going to be a better man i'm going to be a better woman i'm going to be a better young person i'm going to be a better member of my church i'm going to be a better representative of the message of the hour i'm not going to be the same that i was i'm changed i'm changed i'm changed [Applause] is that what you want well let's do it i said let's do it make up your mind [Applause] by the grace of god and i leave here i'm going to be a better mama a better daddy a brother sister a young person i've got something that's changed my life you think brother ron you think he's naive to believe we prayed for him and i believe god did some wonderful things for our brother do you think he's naive enough to believe the battle is over what do you get courage strength strength strength hallelujah many of you that were praying for many of you that come up and god moved for you you're not done well all my troubles are over no they're not over but neither are the devil's troubles over there hallelujah neither are the devil's troubles over because we are leaving here charged by the power of god hallelujah i love the way the prophet said it your glorified body is in the building this morning wanting to send a charge through you like a battery [Music] sometimes they get kind of low don't we go run run god sends you glorified body real near preachers take him jumper cables and go to hooking them up hallelujah and the devil said watch out boys watch out for getting jumped off watch out boys and getting jumped off that's what you want to leave here today with a jump a jump something that jump started your faith something that jump started shall walk with god and whenever you meet the devil [Applause] hallelujah mechanics and dynamics it ain't gonna be long let me close with this it won't be very long at all a few more settings of the sun till in heaven he will step behind the curtain as it were you see peter james and john brother branham all those that live and down for the ages have never yet got to see the lord jesus remember when he came behind the curtain time he said i won't say jesus said can't see him yet you see the way he's dressed right now would be unbecoming for them to see him because he's still acting high priest but when the last one has come in filled with the holy ghost and set in the kingdom of god i don't know how long it'll be maybe five minutes maybe an hour but he will step behind the curtain as it was and we'll change his clothes and when he walks out the angels look and say oh today is the time you see whenever we meet him in the rapture we're not seeing as it were blood on his garments and a high priest and no but escaped he comes to claim his inheritance and what does he do the first thing he does is call for you to come so when he steps out from behind the curtain as it were and they look and there he's dawning that rope don't you understand when he changes his clothes it's a sign we're fixing to thank you lord no doubt there's people right in this building today that will not die but you will change your mortal cause hallelujah for an immortal body is the way before it's easy oh no as all the trouble is laid aside oh no how will we do it one day at a time by the grace of god we will get up oh but what if i fall then you'll wipe yourself off and say god forgive me i'm gonna rise and try one more time lord i'm not giving up i'm not giving up i'm pressing the battle therefore if you have died what happens if you've entered into the theophany in the sixth dimension the theophany comes to the earth to pick up the redeemed body and if you are here you take the theophany of this body to meet the thief you who you the sea gene of god my body don't like to go to church sometimes my body don't like to pray come on my body don't like to obey the word but i'm doing my body the greatest favor that it could ever get if i listen to my body we'll be both be lost but if i listen to my soul and the hallelujah my soul makes my body obey the word one day my body will save me [Music] hallelujah because i will have a body that matches my soul that's what i want to take home hallelujah you see in the home of my dear little friend he's been preachers and their wives staying with him but they're leaving today tomorrow so tomorrow or tuesday one he'll be back by himself some of you going back to disappointments and whatever more or what you're going to take home with you i promise it won't be long maybe brother tim will get up one morning early go to brush his teeth comb that black hair and all of a sudden in the mirror since he's beautiful young sweetheart hallelujah going down the camp 1964 think of it missing people they can't find you no more but you're getting together with the rest of the group satan laid a big trap for you boy he's going to spring it on monday he's worked for months and months to lay that trap and he waits for you to show up at work and you ain't there wow you got changed you got changed hallelujah you got changed then what's jesus going to say to you come home oh glory to god come home children that's what we're waiting to hear you imagine when the angels of god the prophet tells us in the church book in 1965 the streets had already been laid the gates had already been hung and the angels are anxiously awaiting with the anticipation of the redeemed of god children what will it be like when we gather there and the prophet said the angels will bow their heads and circle the earth as we sing the songs of redemption if you imagine when he steps out and they see that smile on his face and say oh happy day happy day see what you doing jesus i'm going to bring her back home thank you lord don't you love himself i'll bring you back home bring you back

hallelujah our god is so wonderful amen amen i know many have to leave amen but we just sure hate to leave the presence of the lord amen and praise presence will go with each one of us amen before we leave brother joe would you just mind coming and closing the service and these meetings in prayer amen if you just want to lift your hands up to the lord and say thank you dear god for being with me during this weekend thank you for all the things that you have done let's just pray together with brother joe and thank the lord hallelujah father we just bow before you right now lord we want to thank you lord for the supernatural [Music] we thank you lord for the visitation we thank you for your presence lord as you come by each and every service god ever so thankful that you moved on a heart of men men who are at different places in america different churches but yet lord through the harmony of the preaching of the gospel lord the messages went right hand in hand lord ministering and dealing with hearts and lives even to this very morning lord as you dealt with brother donnie lord we're all going home but how are we going [Music] are we going to go home different are we going to go home healed are we going to go home delivered are we going to go home still bound by the same besetting sins and cares and strifes of this world but father i believe tonight or this morning rather that lives have been eternally impacted by the preaching of the gospel i believe as we heard yesterday morning the dynamics are here to give life to the word and i believe there's young people there's middle-aged people there's old people that are giving life to the word and we have seen supernatural power come to the body of christ we've seen healing take place we've seen deliverance take place we've seen lord struggles take place but father we've seen a mighty champion stand with this dear god and i just pray right now fathers you go with each and every one of us father may they not go home alone may they not go home back to their difficulties by their self under fear and in trepidation worried that they got to face it all by herself but father i believe there's a champion that stood here this weekend and that same champion is going to go with them he's going to make a way when there seems to be no way he's going to make lord he's going to bring total deliverance in the churches and the homes and the families on the job whatever it may be i believe the great champion michael has stood up for this bride and i'm asking father today that this not be the last battle this not be the last fight god but you continue to equip us each and every morning lord when we rise and shine and we give glory to the lord father may your word just be expounded to us now go with each and every one fathers we depart this place may we not depart your presence god go with us give us strength for the journey god when the enemy would come and face us tomorrow morning or may we bring him back to these meetings this weekend what god had done for us lord point him back to the hand of the living god so we just thank you lord i thank you for every movement of the spirit every heart that was touched i thank you for the spirit of the discernment that went forth and ministered to needs i thank you that you're god and i thank you for showing us who we are in your word to know as we are known and we just lord as we close out these these meetings and this this service this morning father we just want to give you all the honor and all the glory and all the praise bless your people now father blessed are ministers give strength back to their bodies their families our churches go with each and every one lord we ask it now in jesus name amen [Music] amen we want to thank each one that's taken the time the sacrifice financial maybe your work time that you took off every part amen but again we just want to thank the lord for all he's done so as we go let's sing that song thank you jesus for the grace that you've given us amen you can be dismissed oh thank you jesus for the grace [Music] jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] for the grace you had [Music] lord i thank you and i'll say thanks [Music] jesus given [Music] thank us [Music] oh [Music] bye [Music] so [Music] so [Music] you
