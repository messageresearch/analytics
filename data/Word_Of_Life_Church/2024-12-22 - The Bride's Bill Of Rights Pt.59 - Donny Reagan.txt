========================================

[Music] let me tell you a story about a man a good man a family man oh he was not a scrooge he was kind generous and upright in his dealings with others but he just didn't believe all that Incarnation stuff which the churches Proclaim at Christmas time it just didn't make sense and he was too honest to pretend otherwise he just couldn't swallow the Jesus story about God coming to Earth as a man I'm truly sorry to distress you he told his wife but I'm not going with you to church this Christmas Eve he said he'd feel like a hypocrite that he'd much rather just stay at home but that he would wait up for them shortly after the family drove away in the car snow began to fall as he sat in his Fireside chair and read the newspaper he he was startled by a thudding sound and then another and then another at first he thought someone must be throwing snowballs against the house but when he went to the front door to investigate he found a flock of birds huddled miserably in the snow they had been caught in the storm and in a desperate search for shelter had tried to fly through his living room window well he couldn't let those poor creatures just live here and freeze so he remembered the barn where his children stabled their Pony quickly he put on a coat and gashes and tramped through the deepening snow to the barn he opened the doors wide and turned on a light so the birds would know the way in but the birds did not come in he figured food would entice them so he hurried back to the house fetched breadcrumbs and sprinkled them on the snow making a trail to the yellow lighted wide open doorway of the stable but to his dismay the birds ignored the breadcrumbs he tried catching them he tried shooing them into the barn by walking around them and waving his arms but instead they scattered in every direction except into the warm lighted barn and then he realized they were afraid of him to them he reasoned I'm a strange and terrifying Creature if only I could think of some way to let them know that they can trust me that I'm not trying to hurt them but to help them but how and he thought to himself if only I could be a bird and talk to them and mingle with them and speak their language and tell them not to be afraid then I could show them the way to the safe warm barn but I would have to be one of them so they could see and hear and understand at that moment the church bells began to ring the sound reached his ears above the sounds of the wind and he stood there listening to the bells peeling the Glad Tidings of Christmas and he sang to his knees in the snow [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that I have you know didn't give it to me oh this joy that I have you know the world didn't give it to me oh this joy that I have you know

just want to say wow good job just want to encourage them to just keep singing because we certainly enjoy it don't we let's give them another hand this morning the just wanted to present these two cards to brother Donnie sister Carol the church has got him something little something for Christmas this year and just want to give this to them and tell them how much we appreciate them and I know all of you feel the same way this morning amen let's just give them a hand as turn the Serv where would we be if it wasn't for the true meaning of Christmas we know what we've been saying in the last several weeks and what we'll see for the rest of this week is not really what Christmas is all about and I'm so grateful that we as Christians can be able to separate all the nonsense away from the true meaning of it the true meaning is that he came to bring back the leadership of eternal life the leadership of eternal life that we would be able to follow him and serve him for our father in the Garden of Eden forfeited all of our rights our right to life our right to peace our right to Joy so many of our rights but the true meaning of Christmas is he came to restore all of those rights back and for that we are grateful are we not I want to speak to you today on a very unconventional Christmas sermon y'all are surprised right this is the same guy that preaches Christmas and Sodom so what can I say first First Kings 13: 6 I really don't think there's anything that I could bring to you today that would be more beneficial to all of us than being able to be in the divine order of God for our life again that's what I think Christmas is about is to place us back in that divine order and we know that it will not be consummated or completed of course until we get with him at that day but I truly believe there's an order for us here now First Kings 13: 6 what we like to read today is to me one of the more unusual and sometimes more difficult instances to understand in the Old Testament but it concerns the will of God for each of our lives our story opens up with a man of God that is sent to stand against the heathenism and the idolatry which has been brought into Israel and this man of God makes a pronunciation of what God is going to do and um God does that the king Rebels against him and God causes his hand to wither up so then the man of God is asked verse six and the King answered and said unto the man of God entreat now the face of the Lord thy God cu the king got really angry because this man of God had blasted idolatry and he says pray for me that my hand may be restored me again and the man of God besought the Lord listen now and the King's hand was re restored so we're talking about a true man of God that can speak prophecy speak the word of the Lord which was not written so he didn't have a reference to go back to and said well the Bible says the scripture says but there was no reference actually that said what this man said so it happened exactly as he said he describ the ashes and the different things that would happen there at the altar and now he's being sought after by this King for God to restore his hand the man of God besought the Lord and the King's hand was restored him again and became as it was before and the King said unto the man of God come home with me and refresh thyself and I will give thee a reward and the man of God said unto the king if thou Willl give me half thy house I will not go in with thee neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place for so it was charged me by the word of the Lord now listen carefully so now God gives him a word to say to Israel on their idolatry but God also gives him a word now listen what the word was to him so it was charged me by the word of the Lord saying eat no bread nor drink water or turn again by the same way that thou camest so he went another way and return not by the way that he came to bethl I may let to be remembered today as we pray God bless each of you just hold that request in your heart Heavenly Father father it is such a great honor for us to be here again today in your place your house that we have built Lord that we could come together and sing and worship and pray and pray for your sick children that we could be admonished that we could be corrected so Lord here we have come again and for that very purpose we want to bring our sacrifices I know your Prophet has taught us that in the Old Testament the sacrifice must be brought to the right place so now you've given the world a sacrifice 2,000 years ago they reflect what they think about that Sacrifice by the place they take the sacrifice to so Lord Jesus the greatest honor that we could do back to you is bring you back to the house of God so people who take you to a system to church anity to all kinds of things like that it shows what they think about you so now we want to bring it from the churches of the denominations and so on and we want to bring it to us today and ask this simple question so where are we taking the original the true and the only Christmas gift what are we doing with it that will tell what we think about it Lord so help us today that we can bring you back to the house of God With Us and there we will worship there we will assemble there we will be blessed together change our lives about what we hear today Father we pray in the name of Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated as many of you already know being children of God after we become truly converted and filled with the Holy Ghost and our soul is sealed in the presence of God and there's not one more thing the devil can ever do to pull our soul out of that Divine Fellowship but he still constantly tries to get our Spirit get our flesh our mind our time so many things around us in the Natural Life get us so caught up just in the things of life itself and sometimes things are not sin necessarily of thems but it has to do with the amount of time that we would give toward those things whether they would become sin or not and the will of God is one of the most important things of our life how many believes that we looked at it last Sunday that there is a permissive will of God and there is a perfect will of God and the prophet has taught us that what we should strive for and seek after is that perfect will of God and our lives now we know we're born in the permissive will of God we understand that but God has made a way by the new births that we can walk in that perfect will of God for our lives lives here in in this space of time and we looked at a couple of different instances in the Old Testament and one of them was balam and Moses of course and I'd like to pick up on that again today before we go back to the man of God in Kings and the prophet says it this way notice as God said to balam after you heard the true cut decision word true cut decision word don't go yes then he told him after he had seen in his heart what it was to do he give him his permissive will so he said go and you can do the same thing if you don't want to walk in the truth you can go and have a great ministry can you imagine now a person that would have a great ministry and yet working in the permissive will of God and the reason of this is because that people sing bless blings somehow are always God's Divine approval but God's approval is when we walk in harmony with his word and the church said you can go and have a have a great ministry certainly you can but you're taking his permissive will you're walking over his word he'll Prosper you wow you imagine that God prospers people even when they're not in his perfect will he'll Prosper you certainly just like he did balum he was a success now we would think my goodness that God blesses us and that we are successful that must be the signs of God's approval of everything that we're doing in our lives but God's approval is when we keep his word is that right now notice he says he'll Prosper you just like he did balum he was a success but he couldn't curse that people he couldn't do it cuz every time he started to curse he blessed so God used the gift that was there in him see he couldn't do it but when it come to being prosperous in his achievement he taught those people through baac to commit adultery so he actually was a success yet he grants you permission for you to make or permit your will right your will a permissive will knowing what's in your heart now this is exactly what took place in the Garden of Eden this is what took place when Adam overrode the will of God God told him what to do and we know that Eve was the first one of course to do it Adam stepped out to take take cover for her but he knew all along what he was doing and he believed that his love for her he could not make it without her he could not survive without her he knew he had another rib but he didn't have any more feminist spirit inside of his spirit so what is he going to do live the rest of his life in the Garden of Eden without a helpmate and Adam was totally overwhelmed and he decided he could not do it then what does Adam do Adam moves over into his own will about the program of God now he doesn't understand maybe what God's going to do he doesn't understand about Redemption he didn't need it before he didn't understand about reconciliation but no doubt believing he was a Son of God somehow he must have thought my father will not cast me aside somehow he will make a way for me to be brought back oh little did he know all that he would bring upon himself and upon all the billions of people that would live after him now it was in his heart because he loved her so it was emotional human love that he loved for her now watch he said oh my brother brandom I do so and so it don't bother me God blesses me every day I sing in the spirit I dance in the spirit he'll permit it go ahead that's right but what are you going to do I wear shorts I do this it don't bother me I know my faith is in Christ not in what I wear boy that's a common saying of the day isn't it but the Bible said there is something to it what will you do you'll make a stumbling block like balum did you'll make a stumbling block like balum did before every one of the other women what you'll do to your young girls so you older sisters remember that when you're dressing in a certain way that might be questionable remember it's not just your right as a daughter of God well it's my right to do this and do that and the other but remember you can affect others that you're going to church with others in your family as well you'll have a bunch of rickettes that's exactly right a bunch of little painted up Jezebels but God will prosper you why He blesses me I don't doubt that he blessed balum too he certainly will you walk in his permissive will not his perfect will God God doesn't change his mind cuse He blesses you he blessed Israel right out there for 40 years what did they do married wives raised families kiss the children paid their TI lived right out there God blessed them in the wilderness fed them with a mana on and on and every one of them perished I don't want just God's blessings on our church I don't want God just to heal the sick we believe in that do we not we've seen him do so many signs and wonders and miracles but many will stand before the Lord that day and say the same thing probably many of you are not familiar with the groups in Pentecost that was identified as snake handlers any of y'all heard of them you've probably heard of some some of the greatest Miracles that I ever heard about in the Pentecostal ranks that I was in was snake handling preachers they would handle rattles snakes copperheads all types of poisonous snakes rare snakes that was snuck in the United States they were handled by them they would hold them up like this and shout and speak in tongues and worship God basically worshiping this serpent if you ever seen any pictures of them and yet they would have phenomenal miracles in their services I'm talking about the lame would walk the deaf ears would come open the blind would see some of the greatest Miracles I ever heard about in Pentecost was in them Services they would take bottles of strick none and when they would get under the anointing and the music would go to play in real fast they would take the lid off of that strick nine and drink it and keep right on preaching many of them oldtimers had pot belly stoves that they use for heat I've actually seen that done in my uncle's Church which wasn't a snake Handler and they would get them pot belly stoves red hot and take their hands and lay right on them stoves and never have one burn on their hands so you see for those who think that just the Supernatural is what proves they are right in their Doctrine you need to read a little bit farther in the book signs and wonders are Miracles but that does not mean that God is approving of everything that we are doing now why would it be thus among them and I worked with some different preachers and they had signs and wonders too but the more phenomenal for whatever reason I don't if you know it or not there's only one state left in our Union which still actually legalizes serpent Handling West Virginia all the rest of them are illegal and yet there are some that still do it and they risk being arrested and Carol and I saw a documentary just the other day of a serpent handling church and West Virginia in a place called War West Virginia some of you know where it's at if you don't you're better off anyway anyway going there to war West Virginia and there there's a serpent handling church there and the man who is the pastor now his father was a serpent handling preacher he died by handling serpents his brother then took the church he also got bit and died down in the church the church around him praying for him his blood coagulating the man basically pret in blood all over the church until the man died and according to them died in face now his brother is the pastor of the church and doing exactly the same thing and no doubt die the same way now you tell me that God call them people to hand handle snakes like that I believe in handling snakes but I believe in handling them the way Paul did now we have examples in the new test Testament of the Fulfillment of Mark 16 do we not and they did not pick up a rattlesnake or a copperhead or a Viper of some sort and hold it up and handle them outfits I'll tell you to me in my opinion the only good snake is a dead one I don't care if they're black green yellow purple they all cause heart attacks as far as I'm concerned well praise the Lord so I have no plans on handling snakes but if if I was to be ever marooned out all an island and I was picking up firewood and one bit me I believe I've got enough Faith to shake that Rascal in the fire and say get behind me Satan that was the Fulfillment of what the Lord said so what then do we see which this stem from a man very ignorant man as far as really understanding the scripture back in the 1940s and then it come from there only affected a small minority of people but one reason that Drew their attention so much was the supernatural because they saw such signs and wonders and miracles then what did they do they moved over into the permissive will of God God never allocated any of his children to pick up a Viper and handle it I've handled a few snakes before on the end of a hole handle that's the way I like to handle them myself good long hoe Cho that head off I was down my brother him several years ago he was out showing me around his pasture and this and that and the other and a snake come up there he went over and grabbed a hold of a hole cut that thing he said may he Rest In Pieces and there we had him a little funeral service I guess you would say so to me that's the way I'm going to handle them but look how people can move into the permissive will of God and think they are operating behind the scripture now you and I would sit and look at that today and say it's Absolut absolutely terrible and we would say Lord what a reproach well I wonder what about us oh we wouldn't handle snakes and we wouldn't dare drink no strict nine or nothing like that but what about our own lives whenever we step over the revealed word of this hour and somehow we think God blesses us anyhow now don't tell me I'm going to have to preach and say Amen both now watch what the prophet said here about them every one of them perish because they never kept his original but permissive his original will his word they took his permissive way now we don't want that right notice again he says so remember friend as long as you live don't never forget this God doesn't change his mind yet he will bless he will let you go his permissive will but he won't change his mind now let's turn back if we can to the book of First Kings again and let's read about this man of God first Kings chap 13 ver verse 11 now there dwelt an old Prophet now notice the devil tried this man of God by a king to get him to break the word of the Lord which was his portion of the word now he was not an ad alter this man of God was not and he was not going to fall down before those images and worship them Idols but that word didn't really pertain to him but there was a word that God gave him now for most of us we're not going to handle snakes uh some of you women are far beyond cutting your hair you're far beyond dressing like a young teenage girl that word does not pertain to you so Satan will not tempt you in that direction but he will tempt you and I in the direction of the word that is allocated to us and whatever our weakness is in that portion of the word you follow me so far CU every one of us no matter how saved we are how filled with the Holy Ghost we are there is a weakness that we have we have great strengths that we will never do this and that and the other and then there are weaknesses that we will have and that's exactly where Satan will hit us now notice this man of God he flatly refuses to bow to the king so now the king would have given him a great reward it would have been a great honor to go to the King's house and have lunch with him my the papers would have posted it great great man of God is entertained by the king said I'll not do it I'll tell you one thing the Lord told me not to do it no sir I'll not do it but what if a prophet comes to you and there dwelt an old prophet in bethl which means House of God and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel and The Words which he had spoken unto the king and the they told them also to their father and their father said unto them which way went he for his sons had seen the way the man of God went which came from Judah and he said unto his son saddle me the ass so they saddled him the ass and he rode thereon and he went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak and said unto him art thou the man of God that camest for Judah and he said I am then he said unto him come home with me and eat bread and he said I may not return with thee nor go in with thee neither will I eat bread nor drink water with the in this place now watch him for it was said unto me by the word of the Lord Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there nor turn again go by the way which thou came as and he said unto him I am a prophet also as Thou Art and an angel spake unto me by the word of the Lord now what's this man's weakness through a contemporary a man by the D of his own caliber a man on the same plane as we would say that receives the word of the Lord and has visions and visitations By Angels now man I'll tell you one thing that'd be a hard guy to turn away from would it not I mean if a man come to you and said an angel of God come to me an angel of God said thus and so and thus and so and I am also a prophet like you oh wow I am a prophet also as Thou Art and an angel spake unto me by the word of the Lord saying bring him back with the into thine house that he may eat bread and drink water now I want you to listen what this Prophet did but he lied unto him oh my goodness so is this this man that was called a prophet was he a false prophet now be care careful was this man an impostor was this man an unbeliever an Infidel no he was actually a true Prophet why would God allow this why would God allow this man to come and try this man of God so you see it's not just that God wants to separate from drinking and adultery and fornication and all that God will allow us as his people to be Tried by the very message that we bring to others what was this man tried by the word about the flood was he tried about the word in the days of Noah or in the days of Moses he's tried by his own message amen right oh my praise the Lord but he lied unto him so he went so he back slid he went backwards and did eat bread in his house and drank water and it came to pass as they said at the table that the word of the Lord came unto the prophet that brought him back so the very man that lies to you to try to deceive you then God gives him a word about you now for those of you that understand this 100% my email is D D D D D you think I'm going to give that to everybody on this internet you can forget it man so here they set at the table then the word of the Lord come to the prophet that brought him back and he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah saying thus sayeth the Lord for as much as thou Hast disobeyed the mouth of the Lord and it's not the Commandment have not kept the Commandment which the Lord thy God commanded thee but camest back and has eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which the Lord did say to thee eat no bread drink no water thy carcass shall not come into the Seer of thy fathers you imagine that man pushes back from the table and thinking I ain't believing this I ain't believing this this man lied to me this man told me that an angel of God told him to bring me back and now he's telling me I'm going to die wow I wonder children as we go on in time and the deception of the end time moves closer and closer remember we're already under a pre-tribulation anointing that's upon the Earth the Jews have never been so persecuted the way they have been in the last several years all over Europe Asia Canada you're familiar with it all over everywhere it's increasing and if you will study down through time when the increase of anti-Semitism begins to strike the world it is forerunning a major change in the world you look at the Spanish Inquisition you look at the Spanish program you look at the French you look at the different ones down through time back in the medieval times and the ages thereafter and watch how the persecution against the Jews started it was ushering in a major change oh my the people of the world don't even realize why it is they feel this hatred against the Jews because the power of the Antichrist is fixing to rise that's why oh my and it came to pass after he had eaten I drunk that is saddle for him the ass he's going to be real nice to him now now that he's deceived him and lied to him and done prophesied his demise he's going to give him a taxi out to wait for the prophet whom he had brought back so we got two prophets both of them from God both of them have the direct contact in that fourth dimension to see visions and to speak on God's behalf oh my and when he was gone a lion met him by the way and slew him and his carcass was cast in the way and the ass stood by it and the lion also stood by the carcass and behold Men passed by and saw the carcass cast in the way and the lion standing by the carcass and they came and told it in the city where the old Prophet dwelt notice the Bible isn't calling him an old false prophet an old deceiver an old liar but an old Prophet you see it was some men like this in the era of Pentecost that warn their Pentecostal children against the prophet messenger of this age oh yeah there were some called the old prophets in Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama and here and there and there and they warn their followers there will raise a man that will do this and that and the other don't you believe him don't you follow him and people said oh oh that old Prophet boy he told me this and that and the other come on somebody when the prophet that brought him back the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof and said it is the man of God who was disobedient unto the word of the Lord you know brother Philip reading this I've wondered somebody how did this man feel himself how did this man feel knowing that he lied I mean you think surely to goodness God would let two lines punish this man cuz he lied don't you understand friends what a judgment awaits for those in this end time who have heard the message of the hour and have turned away from it it will be worse for them than it will be for those who have never heard it oh Word of Life may we not turn away from the Word of Life of the end time I'm not just talking about this building here I'm talking about the message of the hour so here this Prophet hears about and he said it is the man of God who is disobedient unto the word of the Lord therefore the Lord has delivered him unto the lion which hath torn him and slang him according to the word of the Lord which that liar spoke so I ask you if God said send us a prophet with a message and then somebody else Rises up and says they are a prophet or they see Visions or they have dreams or they speak in tongues or you know whatever in that Supernatural realm and then they actually tell us something different than what God's Vindicated prophet of Malachi 4 said what are we going to do well I know what I'm going to do y'all going to have to answer for yourself is that right what are you all going to do that's the question oh my now notice what happens he's verse 27 and he spake to his son saying Salomon the ass and they saddled him and he went and found his carcass cast in the way and the ass and the lion standing by the carcass now this is so unusual because a lion would eat a man but God would not allow this servant of God to be Dishonored in this way God punished him for his Disobedience now you see friends people say because we're bride and we're the chosen people of God we can get by with things oh no no and you imagine what preachers are going to have to answer for at the day of judgment if they're not true and genuine God gives every Minister an element of influence over his people and for every man that tries to pull them away way and pull them this way and that way every preacher will answer for that it's a fearful thing to be a preacher God help us he went and found his carcass in the way and the ass and the lion send by the carcass and the lion had not eaten the carcass nor Toren the ass which is really unusual even the arer of Kings here comments about that the lion didn't eat the body of the man of God nor did he turn on the ass but God had it done as a memorial and the prophet took up the carcass of the man of God and laid it upon the assh and brought it back and the old Prophet came into the city to mourn and to bury him and he laid his carcass in his own grave and they mourned over him saying alas my brother and it came to pass after he had buried him that he spake to his son saying when I am dead then bury me in the sufferer wherein the man of God is buried lay my bones beside his bones so you mean this man even though he disobeyed God he was still a man of God you see when you and I get out of the will of God it don't mean that we turn from seed of God to serpent seed it just means we're in trouble for the saying which he cried by the word of the Lord against the alar and Bethel against all the houses of the high places that are in the cities of Samaria shall surely come to pass now let's move from First Kings let's move now to shreport Louisiana before I left while preaching in sort one day the Holy Spirit fell upon me and said thus sayeth the Lord there is a snare set for you in South Africa now notice a year of this in 1952 which is after the African trip in 1951 so the Lord shows brother brandham to make the trip to South Africa the Lord shows him an order of where to go to go from johannisburg to Durban go here go there God lays out the itinerary of the way he wants his Prophet to go B Paul's going to be with him brother Bosworth is going to be with him him julus stad cleff is going to be with him different preachers are going to be with him on this trip but the preachers they make up a separate itinerary than God's itinerary which is typical for preachers unless they're really LED of the spirit of God so they start opposing brother brandham in his itinerary so they tell him oh no no brother BOS said I never heard of such nonsense I mean some of the things the brother said was so disrespectful to God's prophets leading and yet whenever it come right down to it brother random still gave in to an element of the pressure that was upon them oh my I'll tell you one thing friends there's great pressure of being identified as a preacher and you know who tries to pressure preachers gamblers Bootleggers preachers preachers now watch so this is in sh Port before he goes to South Africa that he says this now whenever he gets there then oh my goodness it's absolute turmoil he's so tore up Billy's tore up and Billy said Daddy you know I I'll Stand with you and brother Bosworth was stand with you don't you worry about them preachers and brother randam called him honey and he said honey I know that but you know we ain't got no what no money to get back home we ain't got no way to get back home and he said well the Lord will the Lord will be with us now notice the same sermon in paragraph 33 about 3:00 in the morning he came into the room and I felt him he moved over to the side of the bed and said who are these men and what do they mean and he said go on go on they got you tied into it said go on but remember you'll pay for it now what I find amazing is that God through the angel of the Lord is telling his Prophet who wanted to obey him that he was going to be the one that was going to pay for the Disobedience now the other men got sick but they did not get AA which is a life taker you'll pay and he said you know you'll know and he said now that you might know you have my permission to go tomorrow morning you'll wake up your boy God honored Billy and said go wake up your boy and tell him tomorrow morning at Sunday school when they have their Sunday school meeting in the morning you're going to have a clear day it'll be had been rainy and cloudy and bad and he said but it's going to be pretty the sun will be shining it'll be warm again Welly you're talking about a weather forecaster that don't miss brother Jesse if you had line into this buddy you talking about a weather meteorologist I know why in the world we listen to all these guys it's going to get two to six inches of snow and ain't ain't a cloud in the sky and we listen to them the very next day but here are the Ang of the Lord told him exactly what it's going to be now these are signs given by the angel of God it'll be warm again they're going to send for you and brother Baer is going to send for you to come and pray for the sick being that the meeting's so delayed it's be there three days anyhow and your meeting is so delayed he's going to send your boy back to get you to pray for the sick so be ready and go then when you do your son is going to come back after you with a man in a little black car and on the road back on the road to get you he's going to pick up another young man that's contrary to the rules now brother REM didn't want people riding back with him to the meeting cuz he said they'd pull all the anointing out of you they talk 90 mil an hour and they' pull all the anointing out of you so this was contrary to the rules but he's going to pick up another young man and is on the road back said he's going to call your attention and there'll be a native in a white Safari suit standing near a eucalyptus tree ah true prophecy Hallelujah near a eukalyptus tree by a bridge with a stick fixing to strike another native and said by that you'll know that I oh no oh no I give you permission to go but remember you will suffer for it I don't know about you children but as a Christian I want to eliminate every one of these snares in my life that I can what about it some of you that have made wrong choices in your life and some of you maybe are suffering to this day because choices you made would you not want to be spared for the rest of your life would you not want your children or your grandchildren to be spared from some of the things that you've been through what about it saints of God I walked into the room and I said Brethren I have dust saith the Lord I said we're doing wrong we're going down to Kimberly Clarks DOR Bloom Fontaine and Cape Town were doing wrong the will of the Lord is for us to go back here come down go back to Johannesburg and from there to brother Jackson you say what difference does it make the difference is God said it that way well why you say what difference does it make if we do church this way or that way or that way if God said it there is a reason and if you did not always tell your children why you wanted them to do this or that or the other or not to do this or that or the other you told them and you expected them to obey you well that's the same way the Lord is sometimes he says I want you to dress this way I want you to speak in tongues this way I want you to do this this way I want you to have church order that way come on somebody then are we going to argue with God or are we going to say I don't understand it and it may not make no sense to me but if God wants it done that way that's the way I want to do it oh my so here's the will of God the will of God the will of the Lord for us to go back here come down go to Johannesburg go from there over to brother jacks from there over to this Durban and I said but he gave me his permissive will this morning and gave me these signs and I told them what he told me and I said it's daylight outside now it's a pretty day and I said these things shall come to pass but remember it's not the will of the Lord oh children when it comes to the vocation in your life what you're supposed to do the work you're supposed to have the man or the woman you're supposed to marry the friends that you're supposed to have oh Lord Jesus how many have I talked to through the years and the Decades of the youth conventions and meetings that I preached around the world and how many of them that I've talked to and they say you know brother Donnie one of the worst mistakes I ever made in my life was I become a friend with this certain certain person little did I know they would pull me away from God you need to be selective of who your friends are come on don't get quiet on me you need to be selective of just pray I'd rather have one true god-given friend than 500 on Facebook that's 487 of them is going to try to pull you away from God but to a lot of people what's more important is how many friends they got following them on Facebook and tell me what good does that do you so you can outdo somebody else what are you trying to be some kind of influencer you want to be somebody in this Modern Age that compares your numbers to somebody else wake up and realize that God places us on the earth not that our flesh will be gratified but that we might follow his will Hallelujah this is one thing that really gets me about a lot of these people that have left the message and they want to portray that brother Brenham was a deceiver and a liar and all that sort of thing and you think come on if a man was a deceiver and liar you think us he'd tell us these things about himself you think the smiley preacher from Texas is going to tell us about his missing the will of God how many message preachers is going to do it much less a prophet of God that knowing his tapes should be played to Millions this is the reason I can follow such a man CU he can stand and say you all need to do this and you need to do that but he can stand and say I'm messed up don't do what I done I'm messed up I miss the will of God don't do what I done Merry Christmas I ain't going to wait for you to unwrap you president I'm unwrapping it for you you remember one time there was a prophet in the land and another one went down and prophesied God told him what to do and he said don't eat or drink it's in First Kings 13 and this Prophet sent and told him the Lord said come back here and he minded the prophet in the stead of God you know what happened he lost his life both of them prophets no matter who they are you do what God tells you to do praise the Lord down along the road we all got sick now watch here it starts every one of us got sick and when I come home I almost died I had amoeba amoeba it's a parasite a little animal gets into the intestinal tract in the stomach like little Barnacles sticks there and sucks well it takes its course in about so many hours after it gets in the bloodstream if it comes on the liver and burst you live if it goes to the brain and burst the heart you die there's nothing they can do about it I walk the floor and prayed and cried and prayed and cried oh Lord my wife had to lead me to breakfast notice his cry till his eyes were shut nearly my wife had to lead me to breakfast no answer from God but you say in our mind we think but now wait a minute he told them preachers that they shouldn't be doing it I know but somehow the Lord still looked at it and realized that brother brandham as a man still allowed them to persuade him you see had he been totally innocent it would have been them that suffered and not him uh oh now y'all getting really scared ain't you you see it's the same way with us sometimes we may not actually bow everything that we know and we may not compromise everything we know but just to keep friends with this one that one or the other one we may not just really say anything but we don't oppose it cuz we don't want to hurt our dear friend you remember when God showed the Prophet The Vision about the be the bear brother bisco was there on the hunting trip brother R tells us about it and he said Lord you fulfilled your part Bud South wanted brother bam to go another way so brother bam said he didn't want to hurt his feelings but he said I never thought about hurting yours so the bear come through but brother renam wasn't at his spot now come on children don't sit there and look at me now we don't want to make this man an idol let's make him what he said himself a man sent from God that made mistakes and we can learn from his mistakes oh my so he had to repent got up before the Tabernacle and repented and asked the people to forgive him then comes back the next service and said Lord I I repented before them and again I ask you to forgive me why I didn't want to hurt brother Bud's feeling God wanted him to go this way or it's just a hunting trip it's just a hunting trip what difference does that make God Is So meticulous about his word and you see we've been around the message long enough now for many of us we're at the era to wear little things the years ago it's thought oh boy boy boy that's right man we we want to do everything I Prophet talk yes yes yes but many of us have been around for decades now decades many of you were born in message churches cut your teeth on message pews as we say well that don't matter anymore and that don't matter anymore and oh no now we're going along we're good we're good you know we're good we got our message churches and we're having conventions all over the world and we're know all over the world yeah we're doing good I want to obey him right now just as much if not more so than I did when I came to the message in the 80s March the 27th 1983 I stood in my little p Coster church that I started and introduced the message of the hour in May of 1983 I preached the coming of the son of man from March to may I laid in the tapes went to Jeffersonville bought tapes books pictures all that brought it back to the church oh I had such a seal I want to have that same Zeal today brother Daryl some of y'all came down to that church some of y'all visited there some of you remember I don't want to be slack now brother down now that I'm a 68 year old man oh I've been in the message now for decades well can't we calm down and slow down a little bit now do we actually need to have a prayer life and and do we need to love one another and forgive aren't we deeper now you understand we're talking backsliding language right when we're saying that it's going to church that important is reading the Bible you young people you don't have to raave your hands but I want to ask you young people how many of you still listen to The Prophet's tapes how long has it been not just young people but some of you older ones you listen to this podcast and that podcast and you listen to this denominational Gody and you listen to this psychologist and you listen to this doctor and you listen to this and that another and how long has it been since you listened to Elijah oh but we're okay we're in the message and what does that mean exactly saying we're in the message if we're not careful we're headed toward another denominational system the guidelines are being drone we've been split and resplit and split and now it's fixing to split again and our guidelines are being drawn oh everybody in our click this is the brid's arrival yeah we've had a bunch of them and we'll keep having them of course into the Rapture I'm not interested in this move and that move and that move I'm interested in this move right here move him from this Earth in a body change can I have a few more minutes notice now God one morning I was laying there in my hand behind my head saying God what shall I do falling off weight Getting Thinner now remember brother Randon was a very small man anyway Getting Thinner and thinner worse and worse all the time getting worse weren nothing could be done worse all the time and my wife would say honey what's the matter I said oh sweetheart if you only knew how I felt I said I went against God's will and I said here I am broken nearly in my Ministry I told brother baar I said the Lord has spoke to me well his witness right now if I had him to come to the platform and I said if I take that itinerary look friends we're talking about just a schedule change brother R didn't have a girlfriend on the side di it wasn't like he was lifting money for himself that he could be a rich man it wasn't like he was acting putting on Brother D it wasn't like he's been a hypocrite he just simply changed the itinerary the itinerary now you realize God will always put leaders under a tighter scrutiny than anyone else in the move of God you say why would God do that to that man of God cuz he was a great leader why would God do this to brother Bram just change the itinerary because he was a great leader and leaders are responsible not just pastors evangelists teachers missionaries youth leaders deacons all of us that are called to be leaders Sunday school teachers oh children may God help us listen to this now if I take this itinerary thus saith the Lord I'll not even be able to have a meeting between 6 months and a year and this was the seventh or the eighth month so brother brandham had not been able to have meetings for eight months so what about all the sick that could have been healed what about all those that could have been delivered that's what I said I can follow a man like this one morning laying yers it was about 3:00 now think about it where he's at he don't even know what his future holds I said what does my future hold and about that time I felt something moving to the room get your memories ready now I'm going to tell you something that's going to happen he came into the room and I knew it was him and I laid real still felt moving around and it come going like laps of fire move down into the room come where I was just saying I seen one come walking to me and he had paper something like typewriter paper it was folded like this in his hand which I have no idea exactly what he meant but somehow folded in his hand and he walked up to me and said as you were meditating upon your bed what would be your future and I said yes Lord I've wondered what my future held he took the paper like this and creased it and said look you there where some of them laid but a great stack of it and he swung it in like that and it went Plum out of sight up into the heaven and he said it is clear your future is clear I came to myself I was sitting on the side of the bed and said oh god oh please speak if I found favor with you Lord please what about these of me but what's going to happen Lord I love the way he talked to God I said please if it's in your great heart if it's in your great heart if my sins are forgiven me speak to me what about it Lord I said I'm laying here I'm just about to die I said I've trusted you I believe in you I've Tau him and I said won't you have mercy about that time I felt something coming come back into the room and move down over me and said as thou was thinking about that it shall be no more more that settled it so what could be one of the greatest things that you and I if you could give Jesus a gift now we're all the time receiving from him of all of his kindness and mercies and goodness and so on but if you and I today could this is the weirdest strangest time of the year when you look at it people say it's his birthday and yet we buy gifts for everybody else I'll tell you one thing if you had a birthday party for me and you give all my presents to everybody else I'd be thinking y'all are pum crazy but that's what we do to Jesus we say this is his birthday and we give birthday presents of people we don't even know and well do I come to a close today let me just ask you so if you could I could go into his presence today and give Jesus something what could we give him that would mean the most to him you know how it is with gifts you get them and you look at them and you think what were they thinking oh y'all going to say trying to act Pious this morning aren't you man you're thinking what in the world they must think I am really weird I mean they bought this and that and the other and you say oh my goodness so what can you and I I'm including myself with you today cuz you see I also have messed up oh yeah I'm not women no women I'm not drunk or nothing like that but I made mistakes along the way several years ago there was a certain request Financial request that was made known to me by a close preacher friend of mine to help build a church in a certain place and they wanted me to contribute so much money and I prayed and I prayed and I kept feeling so funny about it just really strange in my heart I thought well I'm going to give it a little bit of time and I'm going to I'm going to go back to the Lord again and I did I went back to the Lord again and every time I did I kept feeling this strange feeling it was not not his approval those this friend of mine contacted me brother Donnie if you made a decision we're going to we're going to send money and I said brother I prayed and prayed over this and I just cannot feel right about doing this I don't what it is what he said do you know anything against the man I said not one thing that I know of I've actually been there with some man and preached for him I don't know one thing against him I said but I just feel really funny he said brother Donnie I'll tell you what it is it's Pentecost to carryover you're letting that old thing influence you I said well maybe I am maybe I'm just letting Pentecost influence me so I agreed to help so we sent several thousand they built the building had a big dedication service which I wasn't able to go and be a part of it but a storm come up while they was having it part of the building collapsed some of the Saints there were killed some injured that was bad enough six months or so later this man come to his Pulpit with his Bible and quotes and introduces to his church polygamy which he had already been practicing for quite some time in secret when I heard this news I felt so ashamed I feel ashamed telling you today I have asked God over and over again to forgive me had I not known i' still felt bad but that little something that I had a contemporary of mine taught me out of you see friends what I'm talking about but I can guarantee you this it will never happen happen to me again if I feel my God is leading me in a direction if every one of you go against me if I have to I'll Stand by myself I've done been whooped enough over missing the will of God so let's wrap Jesus a gift this morning now I won't have you to stand up and tell your faults and flaws and as your pastor I know many of them I'll be the Fall Guy this morning and tell you at least one of mine but the way I look at it if Jesus is willing to accept me and take me shouldn't I be willing to rap for him the greatest thing I could give him today and believe it or not what he wants is me I've made mistakes Lord I've fallen short of your glory you've heard me tell it before when I came to the message years and years ago and it went for a long span that God hadn't spoke to me in a long time and I looked at my life I searched my life I couldn't find nothing that I'd done wrong and I went before him Lord Lord what's wrong why haven't you spoke to me and he said you won't let me because you've let the message preachers tell you I don't speak no more yeah as your pastor I've made many mistakes but I want to take all my flawed Humanity and all my shortcomings and what I'd like to do today is wrap it in something that will be presentable I'd like to petition my father for my wrapping paper to be unmerited favor Grace if he will take the wrapping paper of his grace and WRA me from head to toe and put a ribbon of Love around my human fry anybody else here like to bring Jesus yourself Brother D would he want me with my flaws he would aren't you glad that God didn't tell brother randam look you have messed up so bad there ain't no way I'm going to use you anymore you realize there wasn't another human being on the earth that could fulfill Malachi for I'm let just go and tell you there ain't another human being on the earth that can take your place some of you sitting here today and you messed up big time I mean big time and some of you pay for the rest of your life from your mess ups you think well I might as well just quit I might as well go back to the world why in the world would you want to do that when Jesus is standing here today with wrapping paper at a ribbon and a bow and he's going to give you the name tag and the name tag for the gift is to Jesus he already filled that out for you all you got to do is stand still and let him wrap you in his grace but he does want you to take the pen and the where the line where it says from put me from me to Jesus and let's meet him today not at the foot of a tree with tinsil flashing lights and gold balls and silver but let's take a trip up to Calvary let's meet him many of us met him years ago may we have a rededication of our life today B heads if you would Lord I don't feel like I've got much to offer you I once was young and now I'm old you tell a few more years I'll get older and slow down a little bit more but Lord if you'll take what I've got I believe I've got a few more sermons left I believe I've got some more counseling and Lord some more meetings that I can preach already got invitations for conventions all over the world coming up this year so if you let me live I believe I've got a little more time I don't need to tell you but it I just want you to know my my package will have flaws I'm sure I've let you down and I've disappointed you and I'm sorry but as the author pinned this song several years ago I'm so blessed today He Didn't Throw the Clay Away I'm not like a piece of china that if one found from the Ming Dynasty that would be worth several hundreds of thousands of dollars or depending on the peace Millions I'm not like pottery that I saw years ago in the museum of egyptology and Cairo Egypt that dated back before you came to the Earth though it was mere clay yet Priceless because where it come from and the time frame it lived and I always Marvel as I stand in in museums and see those things that I think well if man would value a piece of clay molded into a pot then you could certainly value your children pieces of clay that are molded with ears and eyes and hands and feet Lord Jesus wrap me up today in your grace not only me Lord but these people wrap us in your grace unmar favor stick that red crimson bow cuz that's the only way I could beat you covered in blood put that name tag on the outside of my life and say to Jesus I believe right now while I'm in your presence I've got the faith to sign my name from darney to Jesus with all my love take me Jesus a few days we'll be entering a new year we don't know what it'll hold but father I pray may it be the year of your coming may it be the greatest year of Our Lives Lord

belongs to you Hallelujah can we stand our feet today and let Jesus finish wrapping our package with his grace an unmerited favor can we just bring to him what the president of the United States would not want the governor of Tennessee the senator the Congress you think they would want you all they want is your vote and your tax money they don't want you they don't even like you but what the world don't want Jesus will take the greatest thing that you can give him and let me just tell you now it will be required for you to give it over and over and over again that's your will because the
