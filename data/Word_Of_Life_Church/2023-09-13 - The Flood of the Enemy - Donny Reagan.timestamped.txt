[18:42] God bless you all and we miss you all so
[18:45] much so we want to remember that prayer

[18:59] we got a lot of folks here in our
[19:01] assembly that's that's sick and body
[19:03] needs healing needs a touch from the

[32:54] I think we're going to survive it
[32:56] she ain't killed me yet but in moving I
[32:59] was going through some stuff and I found
[33:01] the
[33:03] message brother Donnie preached and
[33:06] 83
[33:09] it's the first message when he
[33:10] introduced a message at our Pentecostal
[33:13] Church in Kentucky and I listened to it
[33:15] yesterday driving to Kentucky
[33:17] but I just brought back so many memories
[33:21] of
[33:22] where the Lord's brought us from how the
[33:24] Lord brought us along the road
[33:26] just so glad he
[33:29] that he's that he loves me
[33:33] spirit in the bride will sing Come
[33:41] elected
[33:44] inside their heart
[33:48] are you not in time
[33:58] soon we'll be with our Lord forevermore
[34:08] has come the pride is making preparation
[34:15] we're hearing the shout of our King
[34:22] the tokens been applied he's cleaning
[34:28] from inside
[34:30] and the dove leads a lamb once again
[34:38] a Finland and clean why is gratitude
[34:46] she's been washed in the blood of God's
[34:51] own son
[34:53] when the righteousness that's not our
[34:57] own we'll stand just before his
[35:01] throne
[35:03] where we'll reign with our Lord forever
[35:10] [Applause]
[35:16] [Music]
[35:16] [Applause]
[35:19] [Music]
[35:25] Kings
[35:27] the tokens been applied he's cleaning
[35:33] from inside
[35:35] and the dove leads to lamb once again
[35:40] upon
[35:51] she's been washed in the blood of God's
[35:56] own son
[35:58] with the righteousness that's not my own
[36:03] I'll be just before his throne
[36:08] where we reign with our Lord forevermore
[36:19] [Music]
[36:31] foreign
[36:40] [Music]
[36:51] [Music]
[37:01] [Laughter]
[37:25] foreign
[37:37] [Applause]
[37:41] I may believe the dove is leading the
[37:43] lamb once again
[37:45] I'm so glad I can be led
[37:48] you know one thing I've found sometimes
[37:50] with preachers
[37:52] is that
[37:54] sometimes when a man thinks that he's
[37:55] called to preach and many times
[37:57] genuinely they are
[37:59] but a lot of times preachers tend to get
[38:02] to a place to where they feel like now
[38:04] that they're a preacher special pastors
[38:06] that they are no longer
[38:08] a sheep
[38:11] which means they can't really take
[38:13] advice from anybody else
[38:17] so if they're a Shepherd that can't be a
[38:20] sheep
[38:22] but what I find amazing about that is
[38:25] that the Bible calls Jesus
[38:28] our great Chief Shepherd
[38:31] but it also causing
[38:34] the Lamb of God
[38:37] so he was both Shepherd
[38:40] and she
[38:43] why he could be led
[38:45] you see a real leader can be led a real
[38:49] leader can be influenced by
[38:51] contemporaries
[38:54] it's only a man that really don't know
[38:57] who he is that feels intimidated a
[39:00] preacher to take any advice from anyone
[39:03] else I hope and pray to God
[39:05] I never get like that
[39:08] I hope you don't either
[39:13] or brother Donnie when do you start stop
[39:15] taking advice I figure when I'm in a box
[39:18] or when I'm changed
[39:20] anybody else
[39:23] I've been Pastor now for over 40 years
[39:27] how he found the tape of where I'd
[39:29] introduced the message down at the
[39:32] church in Kentucky
[39:33] March the 27th 1983.
[39:37] so I've been pastoring for over 40 years
[39:39] been preaching longer than that
[39:42] but you know what I find I learned
[39:44] something new every day
[39:48] some of y'all all my land
[39:51] I know I'm not like some of you all I'm
[39:54] not brilliant and marvelous and
[39:56] wonderful
[39:59] and I hope I never get that way I hope I
[40:03] can always be taught
[40:05] always be instructed amen always find
[40:09] room to grow in God Amen don't you
[40:13] Mitchell
[40:14] don't you look man
[40:16] amen God bless you let's turn to the
[40:19] book of Isaiah tonight I forgot to ask
[40:22] you all everybody doing well yeah yeah
[40:23] well you was before I started talking
[40:25] anyway oh my goodness
[40:27] Isaiah 59 15. let me come to not the
[40:31] needs in your life need to hear from
[40:33] Heaven me too
[40:35] all I believe we're going to
[40:38] Isaiah 59 15.
[40:41] I want to speak to you tonight on the
[40:43] flood
[40:44] of the enemy
[40:46] the flood
[40:48] of the enemy
[40:50] Isaiah 59 15.
[40:54] yay
[40:55] truce
[40:57] faileth
[41:00] and he that departeth from evil
[41:03] maketh himself
[41:05] a prey
[41:07] it's a very strange time
[41:10] that God is speaking this to the people
[41:12] of Israel
[41:13] and the Lord saw it
[41:16] so truce was failing truth was
[41:20] collapsing
[41:22] and then a man
[41:24] that would depart from Evil he was
[41:27] making himself a prey so in other words
[41:29] whenever a man would depart from Evil
[41:31] it's like things turned against him and
[41:35] he was worse seemingly that what he was
[41:38] before he ever turned to God
[41:41] that can be a very confusing time
[41:44] and the Lord saw it
[41:47] and it displeased him that there was no
[41:51] judgment
[41:54] and he saw that there was no man
[41:58] and wondered
[42:00] that there was no intercessor
[42:04] therefore his arm
[42:06] brought salvation unto him
[42:10] and his righteousness it sustained him
[42:14] for he put on righteousness as a
[42:16] breastplate
[42:18] an an helmet of salvation upon his head
[42:21] and he put on the garments of Vengeance
[42:24] for closing
[42:28] and was clad with zeal
[42:31] as a cloak now remember of course this
[42:33] is a Messianic prophecy but it was also
[42:36] a prophecy for this time in Isaiah's
[42:39] visit on the Earth
[42:42] according to their deeds accordingly he
[42:45] will repay Fury to his adversaries
[42:48] recompense to his enemies to the islands
[42:52] he shall repay recompense now listen to
[42:56] verse 19.
[42:58] so shall thy fear the name of the Lord
[43:01] from
[43:03] the list
[43:06] from the West
[43:09] and His glory from the rising of the Sun
[43:13] when the enemy
[43:15] shall come in like a flood
[43:19] the ruach
[43:21] of the Lord
[43:23] ruach
[43:25] of the Lord
[43:27] shall lift up a standard
[43:30] against him
[43:32] when the enemy shall come in like a
[43:35] flood
[43:36] the spirit of the Lord
[43:38] shall lift up a standard
[43:41] against him I may believe that to be the
[43:43] truth tonight and he has a need in your
[43:46] life your home
[43:48] I stopped to pick up the Parker girls
[43:51] for church tonight and Lance wanted me
[43:55] to
[43:56] mention to you
[43:58] that Erica for the last few days
[44:01] has had
[44:03] an intensifying of
[44:05] pain in her body
[44:07] and I know that you all pray for her I
[44:10] get texts and emails and phone calls and
[44:12] things like that from from you saying
[44:15] that you pray for every day sometimes
[44:17] multiple times during the day and how we
[44:19] appreciate you doing that
[44:22] but sometimes you need a little update
[44:25] of where things are
[44:27] so they wanted me to mention to you
[44:29] tonight that she's on a pain patch and
[44:32] she's having actually having
[44:34] breakthroughs of that pain patch and
[44:37] having to take more pain meds by pill
[44:42] and we don't consider this a loss of
[44:45] ground
[44:46] we don't consider this not a sign of
[44:50] victory
[44:51] as a matter of fact we're looking at it
[44:53] that it's a sign of a scared devil
[44:57] amen and he hates to be exposed don't he
[45:01] but for the last few days she's really
[45:03] had a lot of pain Caroline had to go
[45:06] down last night about 9 30 or so and was
[45:09] there for quite a while praying and
[45:11] praying and the presence of God
[45:14] certainly came in a mighty way
[45:19] in a mighty way and the Holy Ghost
[45:22] well let me just say the Holy Ghost made
[45:25] a great visit with his presence
[45:29] I wish all of you could have been there
[45:31] to sense the presence of God
[45:34] but they wanted me to ask you tonight if
[45:38] you would remember him and I know you
[45:40] will
[45:41] we have lots of other folks that are
[45:43] sick and we want to remember them as
[45:45] well so just just raise your hand your
[45:47] needs whatever it is there to signify
[45:49] and I know you're saying oh my goodness
[45:52] brother Donnie my need is so little
[45:54] compared to hers and it's so little but
[45:57] look friends he didn't just come to pay
[46:00] for Erica's healing
[46:02] he didn't just come for the great big
[46:04] things maybe you've got a headache
[46:07] tonight that's just as important to
[46:09] Jesus maybe you've got a toothache maybe
[46:12] your feet are bothering you or something
[46:14] if I I don't even want to ask him after
[46:17] all of that why he's got plenty of
[46:19] healing left
[46:21] to cover the big things the little
[46:23] things so let's just bring all of our
[46:26] needs to it
[46:28] Heavenly Father we count it such a great
[46:31] honor
[46:32] that we could be in your presence once
[46:34] again
[46:36] Lord Jesus I believe that you're mindful
[46:40] of every need of every person in this
[46:42] building
[46:43] so whether their need would be great or
[46:46] whether it not be considered small
[46:49] Lord God we want to bring them all
[46:51] before you
[46:53] we're grateful that you suffered for
[46:56] desperate things and cancer is certainly
[46:59] a serious thing
[47:01] but Lord Jesus not only did you pay the
[47:04] price for that
[47:05] but you paid it for
[47:07] somebody's feet hurting and sore like
[47:11] mine are tonight
[47:13] mine's so small
[47:15] compared to Erica's and maybe others
[47:18] but I need to touch Lord
[47:21] I'm sure there's others here tonight and
[47:23] they say Lord I I don't even want to
[47:25] mention mine but we need to because your
[47:29] power is so great
[47:31] and you're concerned about the small
[47:34] needs the medium size the large the
[47:36] extra large
[47:38] so father we're praying tonight in the
[47:40] name of Jesus that should come by our
[47:43] way visit us tonight Lord
[47:47] father you see this need in Erica's body
[47:49] and I know when I speak it tonight
[47:52] it will be around the world by in the
[47:54] morning and that's good
[47:56] because the kingdom of hell is going to
[47:59] be bombarded against and the Throne of
[48:02] God is going to be Hallelujah
[48:06] I told her the other day honey I said
[48:09] you're so loved I said there's not a
[48:11] president a prime minister a potentate
[48:14] there's not a King around the world who
[48:17] has their name mentioned Before the
[48:18] Throne of God as much as you do
[48:21] and we're grateful for every one of them
[48:23] Lord we thank you Father we're just
[48:25] asking you that should move for her Lord
[48:27] we believe that dear God In The Name of
[48:31] Jesus may this be the night that the
[48:34] angel of God will pass by her way Lord
[48:37] and bring complete deliverance
[48:39] speak to us from your word father in the
[48:42] name of Jesus we pray and the Saints
[48:46] said amen amen God bless you Saints you
[48:49] may be seated
[48:55] I don't know if you
[48:57] know it or not but the year 2023
[49:02] has been a year
[49:05] of great floods naturally now let me
[49:08] just speak to you along the natural line
[49:10] for a few moments Europe
[49:13] has had catastrophic floods
[49:18] parts of Africa has had catastrophic
[49:22] floods
[49:23] Nevada last week had a flood thousands
[49:28] of people
[49:29] were held there at a festival
[49:32] flooded they could not get in or out
[49:36] roads were blocked and people were
[49:39] paranoid of course
[49:42] Libya the country of Libya which most of
[49:45] you know where it's at Northern Africa
[49:48] Libya was hit by a flood this weekend
[49:53] and I saw it just this afternoon that
[49:57] their estimating from what they've seen
[50:01] so far the devastation the lives that
[50:04] have been lost the lives that cannot be
[50:07] accounted for probably 20
[50:11] 000 people dead
[50:14] Italy just had a catastrophic flood
[50:19] all these floods taking place all over
[50:22] the world
[50:24] I believe and I'm sure that you believe
[50:27] with me that many times the natural
[50:30] things that we see are signs
[50:35] that have a spiritual anatype that
[50:39] connects together with it the signs and
[50:43] the heavens declare his majesty they can
[50:46] also declare judgment on the Earth
[50:51] and as we can see great floods that are
[50:55] bringing Devastation and judgment to the
[50:59] Earth
[51:00] the enemy also has an answer to this in
[51:06] the spiritual sense
[51:09] a flood can come from a a a a deluge
[51:14] which will fall within a short period of
[51:18] time
[51:19] actually right now the hurricane in the
[51:23] Atlantic they're keeping an eye on it
[51:26] it's sped up slowed down sped up again
[51:30] slow down now taking a northern course
[51:35] the tropical system of course moving up
[51:39] to the Atlantic and the high pressure
[51:42] system holding over the Eastern Seaboard
[51:45] has not allowed it to go South toward
[51:48] South Carolina Georgia and so on so it
[51:51] seems that it will take a more
[51:54] northernly route
[51:56] maybe up to Virginia Maine Eastern part
[52:01] of Canada still looking at it the radar
[52:04] the computer generating the images as
[52:07] they called it the spaghetti images
[52:09] because the images will intertwine and
[52:13] it will come across so they're giving
[52:15] preliminary warnings that parts of the
[52:20] Northeast might get five to seven inches
[52:23] of rain and a period of 12 to 24 hours
[52:27] well our drainage systems are not made
[52:31] to take such rain the uh depending on
[52:35] the Earth itself how much rains that
[52:38] they've received so floods we understand
[52:41] can come like that that it can be a
[52:44] catastrophic amount of rain that can
[52:47] fall in a short period of time parts of
[52:51] China in the last month have been
[52:54] inundated with one flood after another
[52:57] eye to another buildings washed away
[53:01] great things in Saudi Arabia also in
[53:05] Israel and Saudi Arabia in Dubai some of
[53:09] their great great major cities the
[53:12] heavens opened up and Deluge of rain
[53:15] coming down
[53:17] but we also know that floods can come
[53:20] from moderate rain that will come one
[53:24] day and another and another and another
[53:28] not catastrophic not Deluge proportion
[53:32] but just a steady rain can happen on
[53:37] Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and
[53:41] Thursday and people will look at it and
[53:43] they don't get all upset because the
[53:46] weather people have not warned them that
[53:49] we're going to have a deluge everybody
[53:51] watch out for flooding but it just seems
[53:55] it's normal rain in Carter County or
[53:59] it's normal rain in Washington or
[54:02] Sullivan County and then on the fourth
[54:04] day we get this alert of the flood and
[54:09] we think well where did that come from
[54:11] it come from Monday and Tuesday and
[54:14] Wednesday and by Thursday the round is
[54:18] saturated the rivers are at their Peak
[54:21] and all of a sudden we get this warning
[54:24] of a flood I mean notice what I'm
[54:26] talking about and yet we've also had
[54:29] them to where that it would be a deluge
[54:31] of rain and it would come a heavy
[54:32] downpour and all of a sudden we get this
[54:34] on our phones or our computers or
[54:37] whatever more and it will warn us so it
[54:40] can come in a variety of ways and I find
[54:42] myself that life can be that way that
[54:46] the flood or the onslaught of the enemy
[54:49] it can be something so spiritually
[54:53] catastrophic that it hits you and nearly
[54:57] takes you off your feet it was something
[55:00] that just happened you were not prepared
[55:03] for it you were not forewarned and it's
[55:06] just something that hits you all of a
[55:09] sudden it's there and you're saying oh
[55:11] my goodness how did this happen but then
[55:13] other times it will be one thing I've
[55:16] turned another after another after
[55:20] another and your ground around you
[55:23] becomes so saturated with one family
[55:27] issue after another family issue after
[55:31] another family issue with a financial
[55:34] issue and that a church family issue and
[55:37] before you know it your banks are
[55:40] flooded and your ground is saturated
[55:43] with water and you're trying to figure
[55:46] out where in the world am I how many has
[55:49] ever been there you see those are the
[55:52] type that can be really more dangerous
[55:55] now for those of you that have traveled
[55:57] out west in the desert Southwest and
[56:00] you've been in Arizona maybe Nevada Utah
[56:03] some of those places and you go across a
[56:06] wash now for those that's been there and
[56:08] lived there and those of you that
[56:10] envisage you know what I'm talking about
[56:11] and there will be a sign there and if
[56:14] the sign will say do not enter when 4
[56:17] flooded and you're looking at that sign
[56:19] and you're thinking you got to be
[56:21] kidding me I'm an idiot ring you're in
[56:23] 45 years and it's as dry as it can be
[56:26] what are they talking about flooding but
[56:29] that sign is there as a warning because
[56:33] in that desert Southwest in many of
[56:35] those places there's not trees like we
[56:38] have back here in the East so the water
[56:40] will run off the mountains and the rocks
[56:43] and the sand and it will accumulate and
[56:46] it can be a little bitty tiny spring or
[56:49] to look like and whenever you go across
[56:51] it and that Deluge of water can come
[56:54] across whenever you get in the middle of
[56:56] it and that next thing you know you find
[56:58] yourself about halfway down Dead Man's
[57:01] wash and you wonder why they call it
[57:04] dead man's wash your fatality number
[57:09] 3837 because you did not pay attention
[57:13] to that little bitty sign do not enter
[57:16] when flooded so you sought your Cadillac
[57:20] or your big large SUV would be powerful
[57:23] enough to take you across that and
[57:26] that's the way life can be sometimes
[57:28] that we will find ourselves in that spot
[57:31] and God anoint the pasture or the Fist
[57:34] and minister to preach about such things
[57:37] and we say well I'm not really there so
[57:39] apparently that don't apply to me but
[57:42] God was warning you tonight because your
[57:45] wash is going to be full tomorrow
[57:47] so you see the Lord is always merciful
[57:50] how many knows that he is and he gives
[57:52] us a heads up many times if we will
[57:55] listen and sometimes it's during that to
[57:59] when we become so overwhelmed with the
[58:02] floods of life now whether it comes by
[58:04] an instant Deluge or it's just one
[58:07] moderate Reign after another eye to
[58:10] another and day five finally gets here
[58:13] and that is the final time when that
[58:16] moderate rainfall is going to push your
[58:18] little creek out of its banks and and
[58:22] you find yourself totally overwhelmed
[58:25] and you're wondering what in the world
[58:27] is going on you see Satan has so many
[58:31] things to be able to flood our lives
[58:34] with now whenever we look at us as
[58:36] individuals and we also parallel of
[58:39] course the Church of the Living God and
[58:42] Satan loves to sin so many different
[58:45] types of floods and he does them in the
[58:47] same pattern sometimes it's in moderate
[58:50] days of rain and in sometimes it'll be
[58:53] an instant Deluge he loves to sin that
[58:57] the moderate Reigns of error he will
[59:00] send just a little bit of a moderate
[59:03] thing of error and it'll be one error
[59:06] eye to another and Satan will talk you
[59:08] into doing something wrong say or
[59:11] receiving just a little something that's
[59:13] a little bit off the beaten path and you
[59:15] don't think it's that bad and then
[59:17] another thing that's you know just a
[59:19] little bit of a compromise and you know
[59:22] that it's not quite right well well you
[59:24] know it sounds so so bad but you take
[59:26] one day after another day after another
[59:28] day and before long you've got several
[59:31] accumulations of several days of
[59:34] moderate era five moderate days of error
[59:38] can equal one Deluge of a false doctrine
[59:42] that you would never walk into one at a
[59:45] time but five small ones you swallow
[59:48] them down because they're so moderate
[59:50] and they don't seem to really take that
[59:53] much away from what you believe anybody
[59:55] hear me tonight
[59:57] and you see Satan wants to do this to us
[1:00:00] as individuals and he also wants to do
[1:00:02] that to the church he also wants to do
[1:00:05] that to a move of God and he will come
[1:00:08] in and most of the time it will be so
[1:00:11] mild and so moderate not to raise any
[1:00:14] attention not to raise any red flags but
[1:00:16] something that will not scare most
[1:00:18] people something that will not make them
[1:00:21] leery you see that's one thing that
[1:00:23] makes a pastor different than sheep
[1:00:25] because a passion to do you good
[1:00:28] sometimes to do a study on it how
[1:00:30] brother Brown talks about the Shepherds
[1:00:32] how leery that they are and how watchful
[1:00:35] that they are and if she is so easily
[1:00:38] deceived it never ceases to amaze me how
[1:00:42] she are so gullible and they will
[1:00:44] swallow down things that are so
[1:00:46] vulnerable that is just contrary to the
[1:00:48] word as it can be and yet a Shepherd if
[1:00:51] it's a real God called Shepherd hear one
[1:00:53] little thing and a red flag goes up and
[1:00:56] a sheep will swallow right down and
[1:00:58] might don't even make them burp it don't
[1:01:00] even make them Belch and they say wow
[1:01:02] that was some good eating right there
[1:01:04] and they don't realize they just
[1:01:06] accepted a little bit of error in
[1:01:10] moderation so you see now it would be
[1:01:13] very easy for us since we're in a nice
[1:01:15] new place here and we're getting
[1:01:17] visitors all the time coming in it would
[1:01:20] be very easy for us if we're not careful
[1:01:22] for the preachers the pastor and you
[1:01:24] folks as laity just think you know what
[1:01:26] maybe we need to kind of back off a
[1:01:28] little bit of preaching what we normally
[1:01:30] preach at the other place and just kind
[1:01:33] of round off the corner somewhat and
[1:01:35] let's not preach on wholeness because
[1:01:36] we're getting folks in here that are
[1:01:38] dressed and not in the way that we dress
[1:01:40] you know I mean I see them just like you
[1:01:42] do and we're getting people in here that
[1:01:44] are not familiar with the message so
[1:01:46] maybe brother Donny you should stop
[1:01:48] reading quotes forget it you think I'm
[1:01:50] gonna do that no way ain't no way no not
[1:01:54] this preacher well maybe we should just
[1:01:57] kind of to back off and let's not preach
[1:01:59] election for a while and let's not
[1:02:01] preach hold on listen let's not preach
[1:02:02] about women cutting her hair and wine
[1:02:05] slacks and things like that and the next
[1:02:07] thing you know what else would we do in
[1:02:10] moderation well we're not going to do it
[1:02:12] because we've got a bunch of visitors
[1:02:14] well apparently they're searching for
[1:02:16] something or they wouldn't be here so it
[1:02:19] could be the very thing that we're not
[1:02:21] preaching that they're looking for and
[1:02:24] we don't preach it and then we're to
[1:02:26] blame well come on somebody so all it
[1:02:30] takes is a little bit of moderation on
[1:02:33] one weekend and then a little bit of
[1:02:35] moderation on the next weekend and we
[1:02:37] cut a corner here and we cut a Corners
[1:02:39] there and then before long you look out
[1:02:41] on your congregation and you've got
[1:02:43] people sitting there that don't look
[1:02:45] nothing like they did a year ago because
[1:02:48] a preacher no longer preaches against
[1:02:50] him because we got folks coming to
[1:02:53] church with our eyes painted and this
[1:02:54] and that and the other and then some of
[1:02:56] our young sister said well apparently
[1:02:58] brother Donnie don't think that's wrong
[1:03:00] anymore because he's not preaching that
[1:03:02] it's wrong oh but I still believe it's
[1:03:05] wrong and that's why I'm still going to
[1:03:07] preach against it you see but mother God
[1:03:09] he wanted to make some of a man well if
[1:03:12] it makes him mad I'll tell you one thing
[1:03:14] if they're a seed to God they may get
[1:03:16] mad but they'll come right back that's
[1:03:19] the way some of you all done that's the
[1:03:21] way I done when I first started hearing
[1:03:23] this message I didn't just swallow it
[1:03:25] down Hook Line and Sinker I tried it
[1:03:28] some other scruffle my feathers some of
[1:03:30] it made me angry some of it bothered me
[1:03:32] but you see where I'm at tonight don't
[1:03:34] you I've been preaching it for over 40
[1:03:36] years and I believe it now more than I
[1:03:39] did when I introduced it over 40 years
[1:03:41] ago anybody with me so you see Satan
[1:03:45] loves to bring in well that's by
[1:03:48] moderation or by Deluge he wants to
[1:03:51] bring a flip he will try to turn the
[1:03:54] Simplicity of the Gospel in the heart
[1:03:57] Church of the people away from the
[1:03:59] fundamental foundational faith of what
[1:04:02] we believe in this last day you see
[1:04:05] having been in Pentecost and saw signs
[1:04:09] wonders Miracles and just let me let you
[1:04:11] know this tonight I have not just
[1:04:13] started having miracles in my Ministry
[1:04:15] in the last six months I have had
[1:04:18] Miracles my entire Ministry I have
[1:04:22] miracles in Pentecost I had Miracles
[1:04:24] when I come out of Pentecost I have
[1:04:27] never stopped having Miracles healing
[1:04:30] Supernatural phenomenal I just don't go
[1:04:33] around telling everybody about them but
[1:04:35] I have always had them in my Ministry
[1:04:37] and that's why I know just because you
[1:04:40] have Miracles don't mean you're going to
[1:04:43] have wind up having rapturing faiths get
[1:04:46] out a little bit and you'll find out
[1:04:47] that there's Miracles taking place in
[1:04:50] charismatic churches there are Miracles
[1:04:52] taking place in Baptist Churches I just
[1:04:55] told you of an instance the other I have
[1:04:57] a bad this woman sitting there and
[1:04:59] Erica's room and once Lance mentioned
[1:05:02] about praying about something that woman
[1:05:04] spoke of and said oh honey we believe
[1:05:06] God can do it we believe in miracles
[1:05:08] because we have seen many of them adopt
[1:05:11] this that it tends her local Baptist
[1:05:14] Church right here in Johnson City Oh you
[1:05:16] mean they're seeing Miracles yeah you
[1:05:19] see God will perform miracles for
[1:05:21] anybody that will believe he'll do it
[1:05:24] well come on now Church well brother
[1:05:27] Donnie that must mean God's approves no
[1:05:29] it means God loves Humanity people think
[1:05:32] because somebody got saved in a certain
[1:05:34] church that means that God approves of
[1:05:37] that church no no actually it don't mean
[1:05:39] that at all I've heard of people getting
[1:05:41] saved in a bar room so that don't mean
[1:05:44] God approves of the borrower but what it
[1:05:47] means is they were under conviction and
[1:05:49] God wanted them so bad God said move the
[1:05:52] liquor I'm coming in
[1:05:54] well that's how much he loves Humanity
[1:05:57] God will save him in a bar room he'll
[1:06:00] save them in a barn he'll save him in a
[1:06:02] honky tonk Billy Andrews was sitting at
[1:06:04] a bar room he told me this himself
[1:06:06] sitting right there at a bar stool with
[1:06:09] a drink in his hand of the spirit of God
[1:06:11] spoke to him and said this is your
[1:06:14] life's chance you imagine so now with
[1:06:17] alcohol in your hand and God got a hold
[1:06:19] of him and God was able to deal with him
[1:06:22] did that mean God Vindicated my room
[1:06:25] that meant God had a predestinated sea
[1:06:28] and he had to scare the liver out of it
[1:06:30] to get his attention well come on
[1:06:33] somebody God will heal the sick and the
[1:06:35] Baptist Church if they'll believe it God
[1:06:38] will heal the sick of the Church of
[1:06:39] Christ boy that would be a miracle
[1:06:41] wouldn't it God would heal the sick I'll
[1:06:43] tell you what God would heal it in a
[1:06:46] Methodist Church God would heal it a
[1:06:48] Catholic Church while my goodness
[1:06:50] friends the Catholics are having
[1:06:51] Miracles come on that don't mean that
[1:06:53] they're having a bride Revival
[1:06:56] all right
[1:06:57] now you see what Satan will want to do
[1:07:00] if he can't do this by error then he
[1:07:03] will try to come in and bring in a flood
[1:07:05] of persecution and again it may come in
[1:07:08] moderation or it may come into Deluge
[1:07:10] but he tries all these different things
[1:07:13] in order to try to do what to get our
[1:07:16] attention diverted away from what our
[1:07:19] Lord is doing you see he will come to
[1:07:22] try to corrupt our hearts our minds our
[1:07:25] souls from what we're called to do and
[1:07:27] if it can't go from one way he will do
[1:07:30] it another way he will try to come he
[1:07:32] studies our worship he studies the
[1:07:35] worship of the message people you don't
[1:07:37] have to study too much for some because
[1:07:38] they don't worship not evil studies of
[1:07:41] those who do worship and he will try to
[1:07:44] get inside that worship and he will
[1:07:46] either try to calm them down or he will
[1:07:49] try to push them on the other side of
[1:07:51] the ditch and get them to thinking that
[1:07:53] if you don't run jump shout holler speak
[1:07:56] in tongues knock over accused every
[1:07:58] night you ain't had church now you're
[1:08:00] going back to 1906 or later see you
[1:08:04] well come on somebody don't get quiet on
[1:08:06] me oh brother Donnie now brother
[1:08:08] branham's that danced on the floor and
[1:08:11] how many knows how many times brother
[1:08:13] Branham did that
[1:08:16] anybody know
[1:08:19] you know Carol anybody else
[1:08:22] would you like to know
[1:08:26] here you go
[1:08:34] one time
[1:08:36] wow
[1:08:38] so does that mean after that one time he
[1:08:40] was back sit because it didn't dance
[1:08:42] again
[1:08:44] but you see when we go to making it all
[1:08:47] this is what you've got to do this is
[1:08:49] the bride move well I've got a problem
[1:08:51] with that since brother Branham didn't
[1:08:53] do it ever serviced himself
[1:08:57] that we're gonna make that the evidence
[1:08:59] if we're not careful we're going to lay
[1:09:00] brother Brown I'm totally out of the
[1:09:02] Bride message and that's all I thought
[1:09:04] he was the one that God used to bring it
[1:09:06] well come on now somebody but you see
[1:09:09] what we do we want to say well this is
[1:09:11] the bride's move right here this ain't
[1:09:13] me a bride's revivals have we had in
[1:09:15] hell and you know what Satan does he
[1:09:17] wants to watch us and he studies each of
[1:09:20] our natures and knows what we're most
[1:09:21] vulnerable to now are the message people
[1:09:23] they don't want no emotion they want a
[1:09:25] preacher that's dead and God they don't
[1:09:27] want nobody that burns her hide a lot of
[1:09:29] them what they want is a condo priest
[1:09:31] type they want you know by the way I'm
[1:09:33] talked about a guy and he said you know
[1:09:34] but Bill he said there was a guy told
[1:09:36] himself you know brother boy said our
[1:09:37] pastor he is so wonderful me and my wife
[1:09:41] are sitting at the kitchen table the
[1:09:42] other night he says about 10 o'clock and
[1:09:44] said we're sitting in our pajamas and
[1:09:45] said our pastor come in knocked on the
[1:09:48] door and come in and sat down and had a
[1:09:49] cup of coffee with us and just had a
[1:09:51] time boy we just sat there and talked
[1:09:53] you know about this and that and the
[1:09:54] other and he said he got up and went
[1:09:56] from there to somebody else's house and
[1:09:58] somebody else's house and somebody
[1:10:00] else's house and brother random said he
[1:10:02] said God
[1:10:04] I wish I could be like that
[1:10:07] ain't that something that brother
[1:10:09] Branham would wanted to be like that man
[1:10:12] but he said the spirit of God spoke to
[1:10:15] him and said I didn't make you that way
[1:10:18] now you see a lot of folks would rather
[1:10:20] have a pastor like that one that doesn't
[1:10:23] really preach hard just the condo priest
[1:10:27] type
[1:10:27] he's all lovey-dovey and all molasses
[1:10:30] and maple syrup and just oozes out the
[1:10:33] seams with all that sweet stuff
[1:10:36] you better watch that hypocrite
[1:10:40] a man that won't tell you the truth
[1:10:43] a man that won't try to pull you out of
[1:10:45] the Flames of hell don't love you
[1:10:49] come on somebody
[1:10:52] that's right
[1:10:54] and you see we're getting it more and
[1:10:56] more I know a lot of you don't get out
[1:10:57] you don't hang around perchers the way I
[1:10:59] do but as it goes on every year some of
[1:11:03] the ministry and the message are getting
[1:11:04] softer and softer and softer preaching
[1:11:08] against sin preaching against sin
[1:11:10] preaching against that before long if
[1:11:12] the Lord tears in a few years I'm not
[1:11:15] sure what the message is even going to
[1:11:16] look like I'm not sure what it will be
[1:11:19] even identified to say we're in the
[1:11:22] message I can tell you where it's
[1:11:23] already gone for some don't identify it
[1:11:26] being in the message so they say and
[1:11:28] they believe God sent a prophet and oh
[1:11:29] yeah they believe he had the seals and
[1:11:31] all that but they're just not going to
[1:11:33] say nothing about it from behind the
[1:11:35] book They're not going to read anything
[1:11:37] that he said they're not really going to
[1:11:39] read quotes they're going to kind of
[1:11:40] keep that knowledge I knew some
[1:11:42] preachers like Captain Pentecost
[1:11:45] oh yeah when I come to the message I
[1:11:47] found out that's more than Pentecostal
[1:11:49] preachers know about brother Branham
[1:11:50] than I ever knew in my life me and Harry
[1:11:52] was born and raised about 25 miles from
[1:11:55] where brother Brandon was born Burke's
[1:11:57] for Kentucky born and raised about 35
[1:11:59] miles from where the little fish was
[1:12:02] resurrected from the dead born and
[1:12:04] raised about 60 miles a little over from
[1:12:07] where he went over at the campgrounds in
[1:12:09] Acton Kentucky all those things happened
[1:12:11] right there out of our backyard
[1:12:13] basically and never even knew nothing
[1:12:15] about it but I found out a bunch of them
[1:12:17] preachers around there knew it oh I'd
[1:12:19] hear them preach about kinsman redeemer
[1:12:21] I'd hear him preach them Mighty sermons
[1:12:24] and I said Lord have mercy where did
[1:12:26] they get them at well I found out one
[1:12:28] day and when I found out where they got
[1:12:31] them they didn't want to hang around me
[1:12:33] no more because they knew I was a
[1:12:35] blabbermouth and they knew I was going
[1:12:38] to tell you see the difference between
[1:12:40] me and them is I preached what he said
[1:12:43] too that I give him the credit but
[1:12:46] they're Hypocrites they act what they
[1:12:48] come up with it on their own
[1:12:52] oh my you see if he cannot stop you from
[1:12:55] one way or another then he will try to
[1:12:57] bring in the ceremonial side to where we
[1:13:00] just come to church and we sat down we
[1:13:02] get in the routine and we clap our hands
[1:13:05] and we're as cold as icicles and you got
[1:13:07] a six foot icicle standing up there and
[1:13:09] the church becomes like a deep freeze
[1:13:11] everybody say Amen
[1:13:14] amen
[1:13:17] amen careful now brother you're getting
[1:13:19] dwelled there you're getting wild don't
[1:13:21] get calmed down calm down oh sorry
[1:13:23] brother
[1:13:24] praise the Lord
[1:13:26] Hallelujah
[1:13:29] that's scary
[1:13:31] and a little bit of move of the Holy
[1:13:33] Ghost hall now I can understand why it
[1:13:35] bothers them you get the wind to blowing
[1:13:38] it melts icicles can you imagine what it
[1:13:41] do before long
[1:13:43] he totally disappears behind the pulpit
[1:13:45] why fire comes in there and it sets that
[1:13:48] place on fire
[1:13:49] so if he can't get us to one side or get
[1:13:52] us to the other oh God help us to get in
[1:13:54] the middle of the road oh brother Donnie
[1:13:57] you get in the middle of the road you
[1:13:58] get run over no I won't this is a
[1:14:00] one-way Street
[1:14:02] Hallelujah I said this is a one-way
[1:14:04] Street I will get run over you ain't
[1:14:07] going to get run over let's get in the
[1:14:08] middle and stay there
[1:14:09] [Applause]
[1:14:12] you see sometimes he tries to flood of
[1:14:15] neutrality
[1:14:16] just to be neutral that's what we are
[1:14:19] friends
[1:14:21] what do you think about this oh
[1:14:23] [Music]
[1:14:23] um
[1:14:29] really
[1:14:30] would you mind interpret that for me
[1:14:36] oh
[1:14:38] bad supper
[1:14:41] indigestion
[1:14:44] neutrality
[1:14:46] oh I'm I'm not going to say anything
[1:14:49] what do you think about this
[1:14:56] cat got your tongue
[1:15:00] you know where neutral people go to hell
[1:15:05] because they got a backbone like a
[1:15:08] jellyfish
[1:15:10] and they won't stand against
[1:15:12] sin
[1:15:13] and error
[1:15:15] and wrong
[1:15:18] [Applause]
[1:15:29] sometimes the flood is in the form
[1:15:32] of great sorrow
[1:15:34] misunderstanding
[1:15:36] sadness
[1:15:38] God allows something to happen in your
[1:15:40] life
[1:15:41] and you just can't put it together
[1:15:44] can't make no sense out of it
[1:15:47] and you have more questions and you have
[1:15:49] answers
[1:15:51] you see God allows sorrow to come our
[1:15:53] way God allows heaviness difficult
[1:15:57] and the longer it goes for many people
[1:16:00] the worst shape they get
[1:16:02] well how come this and how come that and
[1:16:05] why don't God do this and why don't God
[1:16:06] do that if God loves you if God loves
[1:16:10] you
[1:16:11] brother Tam had posted a quote one day
[1:16:13] this week brother Ron and myself a
[1:16:16] couple other brothers
[1:16:18] and then the court brother REM said God
[1:16:20] loves
[1:16:22] to heal his children
[1:16:25] and when I read that quote I thought wow
[1:16:28] that is awesome
[1:16:31] but old blabbermouth said to me
[1:16:35] if God loves to heal his children
[1:16:39] wonder why he hasn't already healed your
[1:16:41] daughter
[1:16:45] brother Donna you mean the devil talks
[1:16:47] to you he tries
[1:16:50] now they let him get a few words out
[1:16:54] the Bible tells me to resist him and
[1:16:57] he'll flee
[1:16:58] I don't believe in having seven hour
[1:17:00] conversations with the devil I don't
[1:17:02] believe in having an hour conversation
[1:17:04] with the devil but oh yes he come to the
[1:17:07] Lord Jesus he's going to come to you he
[1:17:10] come to the Lord Jesus and the Bible
[1:17:11] says he left him for a season if he only
[1:17:16] left the Lord Jesus for a season brother
[1:17:18] Randy I guarantee you he's going to come
[1:17:21] back to us over and over again and what
[1:17:24] are we going to do we're going to knock
[1:17:26] his block off if he wants to come back
[1:17:29] we're going to hit him again and if he
[1:17:31] comes back we're going to hit him again
[1:17:33] how many times you're going to hit him
[1:17:35] that depends on how many times he comes
[1:17:37] back because it's not right for me to
[1:17:40] listen to a liar when I can listen to
[1:17:43] the father of Truth
[1:17:50] you see God allows sorrow and hope you
[1:17:52] understand me certain sorrow is
[1:17:55] appointed to us
[1:17:58] but God allowing a certain sorrow to
[1:18:01] come to us is never intended to destroy
[1:18:05] us
[1:18:11] sometimes it can be one sore left or
[1:18:14] another
[1:18:15] little ones
[1:18:17] can be a deluge
[1:18:19] of a loved one that when they passed it
[1:18:22] tore your heart out and left you feeling
[1:18:26] absolutely
[1:18:27] pointless worthless
[1:18:31] totally devastated
[1:18:36] and what do floods do
[1:18:39] wreak havoc on homes
[1:18:42] businesses
[1:18:44] property
[1:18:46] you ought to see some of the pictures
[1:18:48] that I saw earlier this evening
[1:18:51] in Libya
[1:18:53] for their and thinking possibly at least
[1:18:56] twenty thousand if not more killed by
[1:18:58] the flood
[1:19:00] turning this place totally upside down
[1:19:05] changing people's lives forever
[1:19:08] changing the face of the Earth
[1:19:11] roads gone great big Caverns deeper than
[1:19:14] this church totally changed the
[1:19:17] landscape
[1:19:18] I've had a few trials like that haven't
[1:19:20] you
[1:19:21] tour whenever that flood leaves you and
[1:19:23] you look back and you say what in the
[1:19:25] world
[1:19:26] what in the world happened
[1:19:29] we've had so many heavy floods just in
[1:19:31] the last delusions of heavy rains the
[1:19:34] Little Creek near where I live there
[1:19:36] which is the one that comes back to here
[1:19:37] our pond down here has been filled
[1:19:40] several times in the last few months
[1:19:44] pump up to the top and running over
[1:19:46] which is why we had to put this thing
[1:19:48] out here anyway because the state made
[1:19:50] us do it to catch all the water because
[1:19:54] we moved all the grass
[1:19:55] and we had to put a gigantic pump in the
[1:19:58] bottom of it so the water supposedly
[1:20:00] that comes out on the other side is the
[1:20:03] quality of bottled water
[1:20:05] so what do you think maybe we should
[1:20:07] bottle it and sell it Word of Life
[1:20:09] Church water wow that's what some people
[1:20:12] would do that's what religion is to a
[1:20:14] lot of them it ain't nothing but another
[1:20:15] buck
[1:20:17] [Applause]
[1:20:19] and why do they do that to be able to
[1:20:21] control the flood waters so they will go
[1:20:25] into our detention Pond and there it
[1:20:27] will stay and seep down and seep down oh
[1:20:30] if life was only like that
[1:20:33] that I could have a detention Pond and
[1:20:35] there's two different types of bonds
[1:20:37] retention pawn and detention Pawn so if
[1:20:41] I could have that before it come to me
[1:20:43] personally and there would be a
[1:20:45] detention upon or retention I wouldn't
[1:20:47] carry it away there was this one there
[1:20:49] that caught it and it would let it
[1:20:51] filter down through the sand and all the
[1:20:54] things that's been embedded in the
[1:20:55] ground and little by little I would get
[1:20:57] hit with trawls and I would just change
[1:21:00] my sunglasses and wipe off the
[1:21:03] perspiration
[1:21:05] and that was a flood
[1:21:07] whoa
[1:21:10] wouldn't that be something would be
[1:21:12] worse than we are now we'll be more lazy
[1:21:15] wouldn't we would be sorry laodiceans so
[1:21:18] God don't give us no retention nor
[1:21:21] detention part
[1:21:22] but God lets it come sometime brother
[1:21:25] Jim and it will be overwhelming to us
[1:21:28] and you say Lord God what in the world
[1:21:31] is going on he has favor Oh Glory that
[1:21:35] he wants to bestow upon you because he
[1:21:38] has confidence in you that you will be
[1:21:42] able to withstand the flood why because
[1:21:44] you have a standard raised
[1:21:48] what did God say when the enemy will
[1:21:51] come in like a flood the spirit of the
[1:21:54] Lord will raise up a standard against
[1:21:58] him
[1:22:00] Lord children if we ain't got a standard
[1:22:02] in this day we're going to be wiped out
[1:22:05] we're going to wind up like the rest of
[1:22:07] the churches like the rest of laodicea
[1:22:10] is somewhere in the debris field of
[1:22:12] humanity
[1:22:16] Lord God
[1:22:18] but floods always destroy
[1:22:22] something precious
[1:22:25] something valuable
[1:22:28] Something Beautiful
[1:22:32] something Irreplaceable
[1:22:35] notice this again I was there 59 19. so
[1:22:38] shall they fear the name of the Lord
[1:22:39] from the West and his glory from the
[1:22:42] rising of the sun when the enemy shall
[1:22:44] come in like the flood
[1:22:46] the spirit of the Lord
[1:22:48] and the word Spirit there is what I
[1:22:50] quoted to you the Hebrew word that when
[1:22:52] we read it ruach
[1:22:54] look at the meaning of it
[1:22:56] as that which breathes quickly in
[1:23:01] animation
[1:23:03] so ruach breathes in animation you see
[1:23:08] this is where cartoons started
[1:23:11] so they started drawing one little thing
[1:23:14] and then they changed it just a bit and
[1:23:17] a bit and a bit then put movement and it
[1:23:20] become animated
[1:23:22] and so they start making these frames
[1:23:25] and moving these frames fast enough and
[1:23:29] it's like Mickey Mouse come alive
[1:23:33] but he wasn't
[1:23:35] but they animated it and when they
[1:23:39] animated it it was as though they gave
[1:23:41] it a personality and life
[1:23:44] and you see that's the way we are we are
[1:23:47] dead and we're no more than a picture on
[1:23:49] a piece of paper but the spirit of God
[1:23:52] comes into us and takes those dead
[1:23:55] Stills and Alma animates our life and
[1:23:59] quickens us and what does God want to do
[1:24:02] he wants to continue the same animation
[1:24:05] in our trials in our test in the rust
[1:24:09] spots by the gem that we go through when
[1:24:11] we say Lord where are you he's the
[1:24:14] animation of your soul he's the ruach
[1:24:17] that breathes Breath of Life into you
[1:24:20] and helps you when it seem like all hell
[1:24:23] is around you
[1:24:26] oh my
[1:24:27] listen to this the meaning of this word
[1:24:29] as that which breathes quickly in
[1:24:34] animation vigor
[1:24:37] courage
[1:24:39] listen Carol the meaning of this word
[1:24:42] Parker girls
[1:24:44] listen to the meaning of this word
[1:24:47] an inspiring
[1:24:48] a static
[1:24:51] state
[1:24:52] of Prophecy
[1:24:58] and inspiring a static state
[1:25:04] of Prophecy
[1:25:06] this is what Isaiah got under Jeremiah
[1:25:09] brother Branham Malachi Zachariah haggar
[1:25:14] an animation of a static power into the
[1:25:19] state
[1:25:21] of Prophecy so God says when the enemy
[1:25:23] comes in if you let me
[1:25:26] I'll lift you up into an ecstatic place
[1:25:30] of Prophecy
[1:25:33] why do we need Prophecy in the midst of
[1:25:35] a flood
[1:25:37] what are we the most concerned about
[1:25:40] children when a flood comes our way a
[1:25:43] flood of the financial crisis a flood of
[1:25:45] a family crisis what are we concerned
[1:25:48] about
[1:25:49] the outcome
[1:25:51] what's the end result of this going to
[1:25:53] be what is My outcome oh the doctor says
[1:25:56] this and this and this but what is the
[1:25:59] outcome God says if you will let me I am
[1:26:03] Rock Elohim
[1:26:06] you see in Genesis whenever the Bible
[1:26:08] says and the Lord God moved upon the
[1:26:12] face of the Earth very same word ruach
[1:26:15] Elohim
[1:26:16] ruach Elohim so it was God inspiring the
[1:26:22] chemistry of the Earth from the bowels
[1:26:24] of the earth that he has spoken into
[1:26:26] existence and it brought the earth into
[1:26:29] an a static state of Prophecy
[1:26:33] oh hallelujah oh sometimes it may be by
[1:26:38] dream coming to you sometimes it may be
[1:26:40] by a preacher that don't even know why
[1:26:42] he's saying it and he will looks right
[1:26:45] straight at you when he says it and you
[1:26:47] say glory to God that was from me Lord
[1:26:49] that was for me Lord what is it ruach
[1:26:52] was brooding over you in the middle of
[1:26:56] your flood and saying daughter I'll
[1:26:58] bring you through this son I'll bring
[1:27:01] you through this what is it on the
[1:27:03] static state of Prophecy
[1:27:06] moving over what the surface of the
[1:27:09] Earth when the Earth was flooded and
[1:27:12] what did God do ruak begin to brood one
[1:27:17] of the meanings of this word is like a a
[1:27:19] great bird an eagle that will take her
[1:27:22] wings and pull around her young and
[1:27:25] flutter her wings
[1:27:27] so ruach began to flutter over the earth
[1:27:31] oh I don't know about you that's what I
[1:27:33] need for him to do to me sometimes when
[1:27:34] I get in these flood waters and by the
[1:27:36] Jack I'm looking Lord what's my hand
[1:27:38] what's it going to be God how's this
[1:27:40] thing going to turn out I don't know but
[1:27:42] I need to know Lord I need to know I
[1:27:44] believe you're with me but house is
[1:27:46] going to turn out
[1:27:48] and the ecstatic state
[1:27:50] of Prophecy
[1:27:55] sometimes it can be a quote that a
[1:27:56] brother from Africa will send you
[1:27:58] sometimes it might be somebody that just
[1:28:01] sends you an email brother Donnie you've
[1:28:03] been on my heart well here lately I've
[1:28:04] been on a lot of folks Hearts I'm
[1:28:06] telling you what it's just been about
[1:28:08] weekly in the last I don't know how long
[1:28:09] Brother Don you've been thinking about
[1:28:11] you preacher pastor friend of mine text
[1:28:13] me one day this week said you better
[1:28:15] you've been on my heart so bad I've been
[1:28:17] so burdened for you I've been praying
[1:28:19] for us to thank you Jesus thank you
[1:28:21] Jesus Hallelujah why he knows exactly
[1:28:24] where we are and what's he do he moves
[1:28:27] on the hearts of the people of God I'll
[1:28:29] tell you what I that couldn't be a
[1:28:30] greater honor to me than if I got a
[1:28:32] letter from every senator in the United
[1:28:34] States if I got a personal letter from
[1:28:36] Joe Biden himself which he probably
[1:28:37] couldn't write in pool Fowler uh though
[1:28:39] from ever congressperson in the Congress
[1:28:41] to get an email from some of you saints
[1:28:44] of God full of the Holy Ghost and you
[1:28:46] write me say brother Donnie you've been
[1:28:48] on my heart I say look you there devil
[1:28:50] look at our devil what inside it's an
[1:28:53] ecstatic state of Prophecy that God let
[1:28:56] me know I'm mindful of your son I'm not
[1:28:58] taking the water so yeah well yet but I
[1:29:01] will as snow will come to the flood so
[1:29:04] will you come through the flood as my
[1:29:07] children have come through hard times
[1:29:09] you'll come to Hard Times
[1:29:10] [Applause]
[1:29:14] ah
[1:29:16] but you see what is the standard
[1:29:19] Bearer
[1:29:21] now God says by his attribute of ruach
[1:29:27] ruach
[1:29:29] every every name of God has a trait and
[1:29:32] a characteristic by which he chooses to
[1:29:35] reveal himself Abraham needed to know
[1:29:38] him in the attribute of El Shaddai
[1:29:42] he didn't reveal himself to Abraham in
[1:29:44] the attribute of ruach
[1:29:46] but El Shaddai
[1:29:48] and then Abraham needed a a ram a
[1:29:52] sacrifice
[1:29:53] and he revealed himself to him in the
[1:29:56] form of what Jehovah Jireh the Lord will
[1:29:59] provide
[1:30:00] but when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:30:03] he chooses this one attribute which
[1:30:06] covers everything from Zion back
[1:30:09] that no matter what you have need of
[1:30:11] ruach moves on the face of the deep when
[1:30:14] the murders Knee Deep and the flood
[1:30:16] waters is everywhere and you can't find
[1:30:19] nothing to eat don't seem right and you
[1:30:21] can't find nobody you know how it is in
[1:30:22] flood time what happens the water
[1:30:24] becomes terminated and the food becomes
[1:30:27] contaminated and the electricity is all
[1:30:29] and everything is going on in the flood
[1:30:32] and you see my things are not normal of
[1:30:35] course they're not normal but ruach says
[1:30:37] listen
[1:30:40] listen
[1:30:42] don't you hear it
[1:30:49] oh you thought that was another storm
[1:30:51] coming didn't you it wasn't his ruach
[1:30:54] he's flattering his wings
[1:31:04] notice this and Isaiah again chapter 11
[1:31:07] verse 10.
[1:31:09] now God said that he'd lift up a
[1:31:12] standard raw could
[1:31:14] so he wants to have something lifted up
[1:31:17] in the time of flood to where we know
[1:31:20] her to Rally around
[1:31:23] what do we do where do we go on the
[1:31:25] flood waters of that what do we do we
[1:31:28] need a standard I mean that's what a
[1:31:30] standard is or brother Donnie I know
[1:31:31] it's what it says how long are sisters
[1:31:33] why they're dressing and and her
[1:31:34] brothers you know can't have their hair
[1:31:35] no that that's not what the word
[1:31:37] standard means at all
[1:31:40] notice Isaiah 11 10 and in that day
[1:31:44] there shall be a root of Jesse which
[1:31:46] shall stand
[1:31:48] for an inside
[1:31:50] so a standard in the Old Testament was
[1:31:52] every tribe of Israel
[1:31:55] had their own name and had their own
[1:31:59] standard so a standard was their flag
[1:32:03] so if you were in the tribe of Judah you
[1:32:06] would pitch your tent under that
[1:32:10] standard so they would come up
[1:32:13] to drive it down in the sand and then
[1:32:16] you knew where to park your tent
[1:32:21] and your donkeys and your cows and your
[1:32:23] youngins why what did you look for your
[1:32:28] standard
[1:32:29] and when you found your standard now
[1:32:31] remember there's 12 out through there
[1:32:33] and you've got to find which one's yours
[1:32:36] you see that's a lot of the problem with
[1:32:37] a lot of people today they don't know
[1:32:39] what the standard is for this hour some
[1:32:42] of them still trying to to Camp under a
[1:32:44] Baptist standard or a church of godsend
[1:32:46] and some of them in the messenger under
[1:32:48] a two Soul standard or a seventh
[1:32:50] understanding of this Center or that
[1:32:51] Center I'm not interested in any of that
[1:32:53] stuff myself I want to find where Christ
[1:32:56] is I want to find not a cold dead
[1:32:59] religion I don't want some cold form or
[1:33:02] something other than this message I need
[1:33:04] a resurrected savior I've got needs my
[1:33:08] children have needs my people have need
[1:33:11] I don't want to put you under a standard
[1:33:14] that's compromised on the word and so
[1:33:18] well God used to do that
[1:33:20] but it don't do it no more
[1:33:27] notice what our standard will be
[1:33:30] he will set an end sign which is the
[1:33:34] standard so God himself went
[1:33:41] this is the standard what was it Christ
[1:33:44] the root of Jesse
[1:33:48] verse 12 He Shall Set up an end sign for
[1:33:51] the Nations and shall assemble the
[1:33:55] outcast of Israel
[1:33:57] and gather together the dispersed of
[1:34:00] Judah from the four corners of the Earth
[1:34:04] so Christ Jesus being God in the form of
[1:34:08] a man
[1:34:09] what's the standard that we're to Rally
[1:34:12] around
[1:34:13] and yet every so-called Christian Church
[1:34:15] would say Amen to that
[1:34:18] well sure we we believe that
[1:34:22] but just in one major difference between
[1:34:24] us and Them is they believe he was
[1:34:29] we believe he still is
[1:34:32] and we also believe he is come in the
[1:34:36] flesh
[1:34:37] oh Hallelujah we we don't just believe
[1:34:41] the word is printed on paper we believe
[1:34:44] the word is being made flesh and his
[1:34:47] bride come on somebody you see so we
[1:34:50] can't rally around that statement Web
[1:34:53] Doctor so and so on so and so says Mark
[1:34:55] 16 the last half of that chapter there
[1:34:58] wasn't even in the original yeah I'm
[1:35:00] kind of reminded of that what that old
[1:35:02] lady that got real sick and she wrote to
[1:35:03] her son you know they're in college and
[1:35:05] the boy was in Theology and he was
[1:35:07] taking a lot of Seminary stuff and his
[1:35:09] mother wrote to him and said honey you
[1:35:10] know the doctor said I ain't got very
[1:35:12] long to live so they wrote him a letter
[1:35:13] you better come home and then in a day
[1:35:15] or two they've got another that's about
[1:35:17] well you know what everything's okay
[1:35:19] everything's fine so the boy come home
[1:35:21] sometime later and he said Mom you know
[1:35:23] how you doing they sit down to talk a
[1:35:25] little bit and have a little bit of
[1:35:26] fellowship and he said mom you never did
[1:35:28] really tell me what happened well son
[1:35:29] son listen glory to God he said mother
[1:35:32] mother
[1:35:33] well son that got real bad sick and
[1:35:35] that's one of them women you know that
[1:35:36] little that little church upon the
[1:35:38] corner yes mother I know that church
[1:35:40] it's the illiterate type
[1:35:43] it's the illiterate type
[1:35:47] uh-huh well they don't know too much and
[1:35:51] they ain't got no degrees now you're
[1:35:53] talking about my language I never
[1:35:55] graduated from high school didn't go to
[1:35:58] Bob Jones University as a matter of fact
[1:35:59] I never even heard of so just you know
[1:36:01] some time ago I never heard about
[1:36:03] Harvard or Hartford or any of the rest
[1:36:05] of them forwards I never went to no
[1:36:07] Bible school I did graduate with the ba
[1:36:10] they although Born Again experience also
[1:36:13] got a hgf degree Holy Ghost Phil fire
[1:36:17] baptized I've got I got one I've got a
[1:36:19] real good degree in theology I've got
[1:36:22] another degree in CDs casting out Devils
[1:36:25] I've got one of LH laying hands on the
[1:36:28] set well glory to God oh I know some of
[1:36:31] you get ashamed of me sometimes I wish
[1:36:33] brother Donnie was a little bit more
[1:36:35] refined I wish he'd act that way you
[1:36:37] know he kind of looks that way when he
[1:36:39] first comes out and Carol said Donnie I
[1:36:41] want you to look good I said yeah your
[1:36:42] iron my shirt your arm my time to look
[1:36:44] you know decent presentable when I come
[1:36:46] out time the church is over I look like
[1:36:48] I've been in a horse race and I was the
[1:36:50] horse so it looks like you know I got
[1:36:52] very many mannered by the dawn of where
[1:36:54] did you learn your Pulpit manners that's
[1:36:57] from my brother he was a Baptist John
[1:36:59] was his first name
[1:37:02] oh I know somebody like to change me a
[1:37:05] little bit but rather would you rather
[1:37:08] me follow the spirit of God or follow
[1:37:10] some degrees and we wouldn't have the
[1:37:13] power of God in our church
[1:37:16] which can we want the Holy Ghost I can
[1:37:20] change lives
[1:37:29] so the standard
[1:37:31] is a signal
[1:37:33] of War
[1:37:38] well the most famous pictures
[1:37:41] of our nation and our identity
[1:37:43] is Iwo Jima
[1:37:46] you've seen it all of you familiar with
[1:37:48] it
[1:37:49] was not a couple of gods of degrees
[1:37:53] there's not a couple of kernels and guys
[1:37:55] that set back in the Pentagon
[1:37:57] but it was a man out there in the midst
[1:37:59] of the battle
[1:38:00] holding a plot Dunkin Donuts
[1:38:03] holding up some type of handbook how to
[1:38:06] survive World War II but they risked
[1:38:09] their life to raise that standard of
[1:38:11] religion
[1:38:12] hallelujah hallelujah oh God give us men
[1:38:17] give us men that will stand and preach
[1:38:20] the gospel bare-handed that will not
[1:38:23] compromise for a crowd that will not
[1:38:26] compromise so we can be able to get more
[1:38:29] people in our church I don't want more
[1:38:31] people in our church if all they want is
[1:38:34] just to be able to live the way they
[1:38:36] want to live I want people that want to
[1:38:38] be changed I want people that want to
[1:38:41] live like the bride of Christ not a
[1:38:44] bunch of homes out there on the whole
[1:38:45] blocks I want people hallelujah that say
[1:38:49] I have a need man of God pray for me and
[1:38:52] it will be as you have said I want
[1:38:56] people that can call Jesus on the scene
[1:38:59] just a cloud
[1:39:04] don't give me a crowd
[1:39:07] give me
[1:39:08] the clouds
[1:39:11] [Applause]
[1:39:17] so if the flag bearer got shot
[1:39:20] what did they do leave the flag laying
[1:39:22] on the ground somebody didn't know where
[1:39:24] they stood
[1:39:26] but somebody would run
[1:39:29] take that standard and stand it up
[1:39:34] oh
[1:39:36] Hallelujah
[1:39:38] can't you see why we needed seven Church
[1:39:40] AIDS Messengers
[1:39:42] the standard was so on the ground and
[1:39:44] the smut of the world and God sent a
[1:39:47] prophet with a message to raise it up
[1:39:49] God knew that Prophet wouldn't live the
[1:39:51] entire age so he would call him in after
[1:39:54] him and say now you men got the same
[1:39:56] spirit that he had you see that's the
[1:39:58] real God called men of this message it
[1:40:01] ain't them that wants to be rich it
[1:40:02] ain't them that wants to have a church
[1:40:04] and think I want to find Dandy thing to
[1:40:06] be to have their own church I'll tell
[1:40:07] you one thing if a man starts a church
[1:40:09] on his own he's opening up the office
[1:40:12] mess he ever seen in his life a man that
[1:40:14] wants to be an evangelist because he
[1:40:16] thinks it'd be an easy way of life here
[1:40:18] are cuckoo birds all I know but brother
[1:40:20] give us God called men that'll stand
[1:40:23] right there knowing they rest their life
[1:40:26] they risk their life holding the
[1:40:28] standard but there they plan it
[1:40:32] and they stand right there and hold it
[1:40:35] till they die
[1:40:38] till they die
[1:40:41] cause them Sharp Shooters
[1:40:43] seemed right at you
[1:40:46] cause they hate that standard
[1:40:53] Hallelujah
[1:40:59] Satan can drop the standard
[1:41:04] men of God will compromise
[1:41:06] the people don't know where to Rally
[1:41:09] where do we go which where's the where's
[1:41:11] the battle's front Where's the Line we
[1:41:14] don't know where to go do we Retreat do
[1:41:16] we charge what do we do we don't know
[1:41:18] what to do
[1:41:23] let me give the kingdom of hell
[1:41:27] an update
[1:41:32] you
[1:41:33] will never
[1:41:35] God's men
[1:41:44] Hallelujah you've attacked some of them
[1:41:47] with cancer you've attacked some of this
[1:41:50] and that and the other but you will
[1:41:52] never stop them and if God takes one
[1:41:54] he'll raise up another one and if God
[1:41:56] takes out then he'll raise up another
[1:41:58] one and if God takes out and he'll raise
[1:42:00] up another one God must have standard
[1:42:03] values so the people can know what do we
[1:42:06] do what do we do where's the line where
[1:42:09] do we stop where do we fall back
[1:42:14] don't you see why Satan loves to bring
[1:42:16] confusion in and among the preachers
[1:42:23] and I preached what I did Sunday a
[1:42:26] couple of Sundays ago brother Ron's
[1:42:27] about bringing the bride home safely
[1:42:30] and about those 60 Valiant men
[1:42:35] that were Solomon's personal bodyguards
[1:42:38] they were sent to bring the bride home
[1:42:43] the Bible says they were expert in war
[1:42:48] I walked off the platform went back into
[1:42:50] the office at brother Ron's brother Ron
[1:42:52] came back brother Tim came back
[1:42:55] brother Tim come over close to him he
[1:42:56] said brother Donnie
[1:42:58] I thought that was so awesome he said
[1:43:00] but one thing that just so stuck out to
[1:43:03] me
[1:43:04] was it those men could use their swords
[1:43:09] on each other
[1:43:15] are you talking about when experts in
[1:43:18] war fight
[1:43:22] they know what they're doing
[1:43:24] and they know how to use that word and
[1:43:26] how many times has Satan got among us
[1:43:31] and had men that knew how to fight
[1:43:34] and knew how to use the scriptures and
[1:43:36] knew how to use the quotes and they
[1:43:39] would turn their swords on their own
[1:44:00] so he goes to the lower parts of the
[1:44:03] Earth
[1:44:05] and he knocks on the hell's door
[1:44:08] foreign
[1:44:20] yes
[1:44:22] who's there
[1:44:25] the Alpha and the Omega
[1:44:29] the beginning and the end
[1:44:32] the prophet said Satan opened the door
[1:44:34] and said oh you finally arrived did you
[1:44:38] I thought I had you when I killed Abel I
[1:44:42] thought I got you when I took Moses I
[1:44:45] thought I got you and it goes to a whole
[1:44:47] line they said yep I'm here my blood is
[1:44:50] hard on Calvary and let me just remind
[1:44:52] you what the prophet of God said about
[1:44:54] the blood of Jesus he said it's just as
[1:44:57] fresh and Powerful as if Jesus would
[1:45:00] have died just a few minutes ago
[1:45:02] the blood ain't lost its power it's the
[1:45:06] same after 2 000 years it can save a
[1:45:09] sinner it can cleanse a lost person the
[1:45:12] power and the blood to heal the sack
[1:45:20] oh
[1:45:22] but it's amazing because the standard
[1:45:24] can be a symbol of War
[1:45:27] but it can also be a symbol of peace
[1:45:33] so there it flies in peaceful times
[1:45:36] but you still know where to go
[1:45:42] a standard is an inside
[1:45:46] victory
[1:45:48] so as a living resurrected savior
[1:45:53] the Angels had to raise the Crimson
[1:45:55] Flags of Triumph and set death or death
[1:46:01] swallowed up
[1:46:03] and Victory
[1:46:06] oh Lord God children this is what we
[1:46:08] want flying over us tonight not no cold
[1:46:11] confession I want that power of the
[1:46:13] living resurrected savior flying over my
[1:46:16] soul what will it bring it brought an
[1:46:19] end to my War because I was born to
[1:46:21] fight against God in the natural body
[1:46:24] but the end sign changed me and it
[1:46:27] changed from a symbol of war between me
[1:46:29] and God to assemble a peace and no
[1:46:32] longer at odds with God I'm no longer at
[1:46:35] us with my brothers and sisters I'm at
[1:46:38] peace
[1:46:42] Hallelujah
[1:46:43] [Applause]
[1:46:53] when the standard is set up
[1:46:57] the army
[1:46:59] together
[1:47:03] so it's a sign of recruitment
[1:47:08] and they say here's a push you want to
[1:47:11] enlist yeah believe it though
[1:47:14] what do you think
[1:47:16] I believe I hope therefore they're more
[1:47:18] Japs you know I believe I can do that
[1:47:19] man alive time you go through boot camp
[1:47:22] you'll realize you couldn't do nothing
[1:47:25] and if you're a marine you get that much
[1:47:27] longer
[1:47:29] some of us I'll call it God let me ask
[1:47:31] the devil Jesus said I've got to get the
[1:47:33] devil out of you first son
[1:47:36] I got to get you you voomies your face
[1:47:38] all washed up so you don't look like a
[1:47:39] bunch of out of hell I've got to
[1:47:41] get you full of the Holy Ghost and I've
[1:47:43] got to send you to boot camp you may be
[1:47:45] kicked around a little bit you may be
[1:47:47] smack down by that Sergeant what did you
[1:47:49] say son yes sir yes sir yes sir
[1:47:54] ah
[1:47:56] Numbers chapter 1 verse 52 and the
[1:47:58] children of Israel shall pitch their
[1:48:01] tents
[1:48:02] every man by his own camp
[1:48:06] every man by his own standard
[1:48:11] throughout
[1:48:13] their host
[1:48:19] chapter 2 verse 2 every man of the
[1:48:22] children of Israel shall pitch by his
[1:48:25] own standard with the inside of their
[1:48:28] father's house
[1:48:31] far off about the Tabernacle of the
[1:48:34] congregation shall they pitch
[1:48:37] Isaiah 49 22 thus say of the Lord God
[1:48:40] behold I will lift up mine hand to the
[1:48:43] Gentiles and set up my standard
[1:48:47] Hallelujah
[1:48:49] to the people and they shall bring thy
[1:48:51] sons and their arms and thy daughters
[1:48:54] shall be carried upon their shoulders
[1:48:57] let me close
[1:48:59] Saint John 12 32. and I
[1:49:04] if I
[1:49:06] be lifted up
[1:49:08] from the Earth
[1:49:10] will draw all men
[1:49:14] this is the standard France
[1:49:17] Christ Jesus
[1:49:19] now I talk about a Baptist Jesus I tell
[1:49:21] him how to Church of God Jesus
[1:49:23] because most of the nominations make him
[1:49:25] a second person the godhead that's not
[1:49:27] the inside he said I am the Lord God and
[1:49:30] beside me there is no other he said if
[1:49:32] there is any other God I don't know
[1:49:34] anything about it there's no one here
[1:49:36] well if he says there ain't nobody there
[1:49:38] I figure there ain't nobody there since
[1:49:40] he was there before I was there and
[1:49:41] there before you was there and then none
[1:49:43] of us that was there he was the only
[1:49:44] numbers there and he said there ain't
[1:49:45] nobody else there I figure there ain't
[1:49:47] nobody else there I mean I know I'm down
[1:49:49] with a cold book and maybe there's some
[1:49:50] me all but my goodness one plus one you
[1:49:52] only ought to figure what if but God is
[1:49:54] the only one that can take fatherhood
[1:49:55] sonship baptism of the Holy Ghost I had
[1:49:58] one plus one plus one and he still winds
[1:50:00] up in one God he don't wind up as three
[1:50:03] persons any three individuals he winds
[1:50:05] up with attributes and the same godhead
[1:50:08] [Applause]
[1:50:10] and not only that
[1:50:12] but if you're a bride tonight
[1:50:15] you also
[1:50:17] or part
[1:50:19] of the godhead
[1:50:23] listen
[1:50:24] [Applause]
[1:50:32] you see the manifestation of Christ in
[1:50:35] the flesh
[1:50:36] the revelation of him and the gospel
[1:50:40] is a signal to law Sinners to shake off
[1:50:42] their shackles
[1:50:44] it's a signal to the sick person
[1:50:47] to shake off their disease
[1:50:49] it's a signal to those that are
[1:50:51] boundless whatever that they don't have
[1:50:53] to be bound no more this is why of
[1:50:55] course it's the preacher's
[1:50:56] responsibility to hold a standard up
[1:50:59] before the people that Jesus Christ is
[1:51:02] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:51:06] so what do we do then whenever a
[1:51:08] preacher does that and people see that
[1:51:10] in his ministry then whenever they have
[1:51:12] a need they just believe they can go for
[1:51:14] prayer and God hears them and God's
[1:51:16] going to do it God may not do it
[1:51:18] tomorrow God may not do it next week but
[1:51:20] God's going to do it in his time but God
[1:51:22] is going to do it but what if a preacher
[1:51:24] then hoists to stand her back up on I'll
[1:51:26] tell you what now we got a bunch of
[1:51:28] Pentecostals in this message and I'll
[1:51:31] tell you what they're praying for people
[1:51:32] and they're having prayer lines and
[1:51:34] stuff like that now we just don't need
[1:51:36] that stuff no more Lord have mercy we've
[1:51:38] got more sick people now we've ever had
[1:51:40] we still need to pray for the sick we
[1:51:43] still need encouragement how many knows
[1:51:44] it's the truth so what does Satan one do
[1:51:47] he wants him preachers to take down that
[1:51:49] standard of Hebrews 13 8 and blow up
[1:51:51] another standards say the days of
[1:51:54] Miracles is passed
[1:51:59] well I agree with them
[1:52:01] for everybody who hangs that flag and
[1:52:04] everybody who gathers under it they are
[1:52:06] past
[1:52:08] but that don't apply to us
[1:52:11] because that ain't our flag
[1:52:13] not in what we're rallying around our
[1:52:15] flag is Hebrews 13 8. it's not Paul is
[1:52:20] the same it's not brother Branham is the
[1:52:23] same it's not you as the same or I am
[1:52:25] the same but brother Joel he is the same
[1:52:28] yesterday today
[1:52:30] and forever
[1:52:31] [Applause]
[1:52:33] oh
[1:52:36] praise God
[1:52:43] shoot my time's gone I didn't get
[1:52:46] halfway done
[1:52:47] let me just read one question here in
[1:52:49] the seat of description now Jesus said
[1:52:50] just before this great discrepancy is
[1:52:53] gathered
[1:52:54] and burned
[1:52:56] the son of man will reveal himself in
[1:52:59] the same manner as he did then what is
[1:53:01] it
[1:53:02] a lifting up
[1:53:05] or fresh
[1:53:07] before you
[1:53:10] that
[1:53:12] Jesus Christ
[1:53:14] is the same yesterday today
[1:53:17] and forever
[1:53:19] oh not this great preacher young this
[1:53:21] and are we all glory to God brother
[1:53:22] Donnie Reagan brother so and so brother
[1:53:24] Daryl Ward no no that that's not the
[1:53:26] lifting up
[1:53:27] the lifting up is Jesus Christ is the
[1:53:30] same it'll only be a few more settings
[1:53:32] under the Lord tears I'll die I'll go
[1:53:35] with the way of the Grave if this church
[1:53:37] is tied to me y'all might as well just
[1:53:39] burn it now
[1:53:41] if I'm the strength of this church if
[1:53:43] I'm the stability of this church we have
[1:53:46] wasted our time
[1:53:48] well come on children
[1:53:50] and brother Ron Spencer is the only
[1:53:52] stability in his church I feel sorry for
[1:53:54] him if the Lord takes mother to him and
[1:53:57] his church falls apart that's a very sad
[1:53:59] ending to a Greek Minister but I am not
[1:54:02] the foundation of this church mother Tim
[1:54:05] Pruitt by the wrong Spencer all the rest
[1:54:07] of these Great Men of God around the
[1:54:08] world our foundation don't need to be
[1:54:11] the pastor our foundation needs to be
[1:54:13] the Abduction of the Apostles and Jesus
[1:54:16] Christ himself the Chief Cornerstone
[1:54:27] not aware brother Donny passes
[1:54:31] you can get a stonemason to go up there
[1:54:35] and take that stone out
[1:54:38] that says Pastor Donnie Reagan I'll eat
[1:54:41] them
[1:54:42] I have no problem with you taking them
[1:54:44] down once I'm dead
[1:54:49] so what are we going to do we're going
[1:54:51] to turn this into a hog light
[1:54:53] once the pastor's changed the Bible
[1:54:56] don't say don't you Reagan the same
[1:54:58] Jesus Christ is the same the work must
[1:55:02] go on eating the sick must go on it did
[1:55:06] not stop in 1965. we still need it among
[1:55:10] us
[1:55:13] do we not
[1:55:15] praise the Lord
[1:55:20] God bless you Satan
[1:55:22] don't you love him with all your hearts
[1:55:25] go ahead and give me money
[1:55:37] praise the Lord
[1:55:39] once the standard moves
[1:55:42] the Army knows one to March
[1:55:46] yeah you imagine if you're way back in
[1:55:48] the Battalion or the platoon
[1:55:50] and you can't really see the guys in the
[1:55:52] first row and you're saying well I'm
[1:55:54] watching them guys you better not
[1:55:57] because if they marched it down over a
[1:55:59] hill and you can't see them you're going
[1:56:01] to be in a mess you don't know where
[1:56:03] they stopped they started they turned
[1:56:04] left they turn right but it just so
[1:56:07] happens that the standard is higher than
[1:56:09] any man in the army
[1:56:12] well glory to God I set the standard is
[1:56:16] Harsh so you may not be able to see your
[1:56:18] favorite preacher because he's going
[1:56:20] through a valley or whatever more but if
[1:56:22] they've got the standards high enough
[1:56:23] you can say glory to God we're moving on
[1:56:27] praise the lord I can't see brother I
[1:56:29] can't see brother so and so but I can
[1:56:32] see Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:56:34] today forever
[1:56:35] that's why Paul said looking unto Jesus
[1:56:39] The Altar and finisher of our faith
[1:56:42] that's the standard
[1:56:44] so that's what we want
[1:56:48] praise God
[1:56:56] it was a disgrace
[1:56:59] for the colors
[1:57:01] to fall to the ground
[1:57:04] it was a disgrace
[1:57:08] for the colors
[1:57:10] to be captured
[1:57:14] and the enemy prized them
[1:57:17] they wanted him
[1:57:20] don't you say why Satan wants to attack
[1:57:22] Hebrews 13 8 that Jesus is the same
[1:57:25] what's he done for him to me the message
[1:57:27] churches he's taken their colors
[1:57:33] do you understand some Churches
[1:57:35] some Churches in the message
[1:57:37] believe that Jesus come invisibly
[1:57:40] somehow 1977.
[1:57:42] and since then nobody else has been
[1:57:44] saved
[1:57:46] they don't take communion
[1:57:48] they don't have revivals
[1:57:51] they don't reach to the Lost
[1:57:53] and they go as far as teaching
[1:57:56] castration to the men in their churches
[1:58:00] why would you want a father serpent seed
[1:58:03] they say
[1:58:08] so they didn't have children and now
[1:58:10] they don't have grandchildren and this
[1:58:12] is their posterity why
[1:58:15] they took down the standard of Jesus
[1:58:17] Christ and put up the standard of some
[1:58:20] idiot preacher
[1:58:22] brother Donnie that's not nice the
[1:58:24] prophet said it so I reckon I can't
[1:58:27] come on I'm interested in some of your
[1:58:29] cultured ideas of what you think is
[1:58:31] proper
[1:58:33] get your head out of Facebook and go to
[1:58:35] studying the message more and you might
[1:58:36] find out some of these things
[1:58:42] so we took down the standard of prayer
[1:58:44] meetings and took down the standard and
[1:58:47] then we wonder why folks can't live
[1:58:48] right get that standard of the baptism
[1:58:51] of the Holy Ghost up there oh brother
[1:58:53] it'll anoint you to live right in the
[1:58:55] middle of the flood you're swimming out
[1:58:57] on the other side and the devil said I
[1:58:59] thought I had you you can't seek me
[1:59:01] devil I'm part of the whole mind greater
[1:59:04] than the Titanic was
[1:59:07] I'm Unsinkable
[1:59:10] Hallelujah
[1:59:12] I may believe it
[1:59:16] let's rally friends
[1:59:18] that's Riley
[1:59:21] there'll be a call
[1:59:23] won't last long
[1:59:26] it'll be a short quick work
[1:59:29] you better get on board if you're going
[1:59:33] Hallelujah
[1:59:35] the Dynamics of this church will be a
[1:59:38] refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:59:40] which she has worked in part while the
[1:59:42] headstone
[1:59:44] is descending
[1:59:47] he'll shut the mouths of the critics I
[1:59:49] heard him say it again last night
[1:59:52] he would shut the mouths of the critics
[1:59:56] and it would be marvelous
[1:59:58] and our eyes
[2:00:03] Hallelujah
[2:00:06] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:00:10] so our church can be great so our church
[2:00:12] can be nothing
[2:00:14] so he can be great
[2:00:16] he's not going to do this to prove I've
[2:00:18] got one great super son over and another
[2:00:20] great super son over here he wants to
[2:00:22] prove he's the Mighty God we're not
[2:00:24] looking at the guy on the front line
[2:00:26] we're not looking to God the second line
[2:00:27] we're watching the inside we're watching
[2:00:30] the inside oh I know friend a lot of
[2:00:32] folks fell in love with the prophet and
[2:00:33] that's what they think whose image is on
[2:00:35] the inside I don't see brother random on
[2:00:36] the inside I see Christ Jesus amen I see
[2:00:40] Christ Jesus a pillar of fire a pillar
[2:00:43] of Life the same yesterday today and
[2:00:45] forever that's who I'm following
[2:00:48] [Applause]
[2:00:51] oh
[2:01:01] a disgrace
[2:01:03] to lose
[2:01:06] standard
[2:01:09] it's a disgrace to lose our callers
[2:01:14] let's fight for it to the end
[2:01:22] are you willing
[2:01:24] to stand true
[2:01:27] so what if God lets an element of
[2:01:28] persecution rise
[2:01:30] how many of us will still be standing
[2:01:34] there's enough compromising message
[2:01:35] churches around
[2:01:37] and there'll be more
[2:01:40] that she'll be able to go there and not
[2:01:42] really even be identified
[2:01:44] as a message believer
[2:01:46] because it'll be such a mixture of
[2:01:48] worldliness and everything else hang on
[2:01:51] quote to profit and ain't gonna really
[2:01:52] preach the message they're just
[2:01:54] preaching the Shadows on the outskirts
[2:01:56] I'm not an outskirt guy
[2:01:59] never have been
[2:02:01] I like to be in the middle of things
[2:02:06] if there's a good brawl where is it
[2:02:09] where is it
[2:02:10] I like having buddies preacher buddies
[2:02:13] that when you get in a good brawl
[2:02:15] brother Jim Babb used to say brother
[2:02:17] Donnie you're the type of guy
[2:02:20] that if you ever get into a street fight
[2:02:22] you're the type of guy that you want to
[2:02:24] look around and see or their bias and
[2:02:25] some of these other message brothers are
[2:02:27] real eloquent and the real Statesman and
[2:02:29] they're this and that and the other but
[2:02:31] they may or may not be there in the
[2:02:33] middle of a battle believe me I've had
[2:02:34] some of them locked out in the battles
[2:02:36] I've been through and they was behind me
[2:02:38] all right about 42.5 miles
[2:02:41] uh-huh oh but I'm so glad God let me

[2:04:02] Lord Jesus
[2:04:05] a prayer to help us father
[2:04:11] I was never in our armed forces of our
[2:04:13] nation
[2:04:16] amidst the wars and times that was on
[2:04:19] the Earth
[2:04:23] they'll ask me sometimes and I'll check
[2:04:25] out at Lowe's
[2:04:27] Home Depot
[2:04:29] got a military discount I say
[2:04:33] I'm a captain of the host of the Lord
[2:04:34] does that count
[2:04:38] and in one way I feel ashamed
[2:04:42] because I was never able to stand for
[2:04:44] our country
[2:04:46] but I would have but I've been able to
[2:04:48] be called
[2:04:51] and there's folks standing here in this
[2:04:53] service tonight
[2:04:56] that risk their very lives that we would
[2:04:58] have this Freedom tonight to be able to
[2:05:00] worship you in spirit and Truth
[2:05:03] and I thank every one of them for that
[2:05:07] we're so grateful Lord
[2:05:10] but Lord God even though I was not able
[2:05:12] to serve in the Army the Marines the Air
[2:05:15] Force
[2:05:17] you call me to serve
[2:05:19] and the greatest army that's ever been
[2:05:21] on the face of the Earth
[2:05:24] Lord God not only me but every child of
[2:05:26] God sending her to not the young the old
[2:05:28] the Middle Ages the sisters
[2:05:30] every one of us
[2:05:33] we've been called to serve in the army
[2:05:36] of the Living God
[2:05:38] Lord be living in a time of great
[2:05:40] confusion flooding does that
[2:05:43] Lord as I've seen some of these floods
[2:05:45] on YouTube and watch the people as
[2:05:47] they're screaming and hollering
[2:05:50] some of the people's cars get caught in
[2:05:53] the water and they're trying to get out
[2:05:55] the car filling up with water and they
[2:05:57] don't know what to do
[2:05:59] anyone that understands it knows it's
[2:06:01] such an impossibility almost to be able
[2:06:03] to even get your door open
[2:06:05] whenever you're submerged in the water
[2:06:07] that way many people will drown because
[2:06:09] they cannot get out in the time of flood
[2:06:12] now someone just the other day Lord in
[2:06:14] China that was going down through there
[2:06:17] holding on to post and holding on to
[2:06:20] signpost
[2:06:21] in the rushing water coming down through
[2:06:24] the streets
[2:06:25] got over their head
[2:06:27] totally disappeared lost
[2:06:31] Lord we can see the floods the floods of
[2:06:34] intellectualism
[2:06:36] the flood on the other side of pure
[2:06:38] emotionalism
[2:06:40] the flood of world and it's the flood of
[2:06:42] this the flood of that
[2:06:44] some are going down in the waters of
[2:06:46] worldliness
[2:06:47] some are going down in the waters of
[2:06:49] compromise
[2:06:51] Lord the world
[2:06:53] both naturally and spiritually is
[2:06:55] inundated
[2:06:56] with flood waters
[2:06:59] and what's so sad is many of them are
[2:07:01] letting go of the standard
[2:07:03] we can't drown as long as we're hiding
[2:07:06] in the right place
[2:07:07] because you'll always have a place of
[2:07:09] safety for us
[2:07:11] help us Lord Jesus at Word of Life
[2:07:13] Church
[2:07:15] may we not only be called by that
[2:07:18] but may we be that
[2:07:20] the word of life
[2:07:24] from that scripture Lord that I love
[2:07:26] that Paul wrote holding Force the word
[2:07:30] of life
[2:07:33] that's what I want to hold to these
[2:07:35] people
[2:07:36] they're inundated with troubles Lord God
[2:07:39] they're flooded all around them their
[2:07:41] homes their families their jobs their
[2:07:43] work
[2:07:45] we've got to have something to hold on
[2:07:46] to something to Rally around and there's
[2:07:49] so many voices one preacher said hey
[2:07:51] over here's it over here
[2:07:54] others say no no no don't go that way
[2:07:56] come over here
[2:07:58] and people go there and they go here
[2:07:59] they go there they go somewhere else in
[2:08:01] them where they belong they don't know
[2:08:02] who the pastor is so they Skip Hop and
[2:08:04] jump around
[2:08:06] how sad
[2:08:08] in the middle of a flood
[2:08:10] people are jumping around from one place
[2:08:13] to another
[2:08:15] God have mercy
[2:08:17] if it was ever a time to be stable and
[2:08:20] anchored
[2:08:23] help me Jesus
[2:08:26] Lord sometimes it seems like the rain
[2:08:29] will never stop
[2:08:31] it seems like I get under one thunder
[2:08:33] cloud after another after another
[2:08:37] but Lord God I can hear my destiny
[2:08:40] ringing down through eternity
[2:08:43] Hallelujah
[2:08:46] I am the Lord God that created the
[2:08:49] heavens and the Earth
[2:08:51] did not I speak the universe into
[2:08:53] existence
[2:08:56] did not I call you
[2:08:59] I hear you say my name
[2:09:01] Lord this is what we need in this hour
[2:09:04] of stability
[2:09:05] to know that you have called us
[2:09:08] not just the preachers ever man woman
[2:09:11] boy and girl
[2:09:13] we couldn't hear an echo from the Throne
[2:09:15] of God
[2:09:16] you are mine
[2:09:19] that's the standard of the Soul
[2:09:23] feelings ain't our standard because a
[2:09:25] lot of times in battles we feel
[2:09:27] everything but you
[2:09:29] we feel everything but saved
[2:09:32] we feel everything but healed
[2:09:35] but the standard Remains the Same
[2:09:37] whether we feel it or not
[2:09:40] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:09:44] we worship you tonight Lord Jesus
[2:09:49] oh Hallelujah anybody like to raise your
[2:09:53] left standard

[2:10:13] you Lord Jesus
[2:10:15] we bless your name here tonight father
[2:10:19] Lord though thy may fall to the right
[2:10:21] and though they may fall to the left and
[2:10:23] some look this and that and the other
[2:10:24] Lord God may we be found stable may we
[2:10:29] be found standing on the Rock of Ages
[2:10:32] Lord
[2:10:33] Hallelujah it must have been such a
[2:10:37] scary time for the apostles
[2:10:40] when they realized you had died how
[2:10:43] could that be possible
[2:10:44] their minds was inundated with no doubt
[2:10:47] these thoughts of confusion and they
[2:10:49] were sore so Torn to Pieces they didn't
[2:10:52] know what to do
[2:10:54] and the flag it seemed was removed from
[2:10:57] them
[2:10:58] it was the transition from the natural
[2:11:00] pole of the Flesh and the flag is going
[2:11:03] to be changed from the human body now to
[2:11:05] the pillar of fire the spirit Spirit
[2:11:07] being
[2:11:08] and it had took a few days for that to
[2:11:11] transpire and the standard was gone from
[2:11:13] Before Their Eyes they didn't know what
[2:11:15] to do
[2:11:16] Peter got the torp he said I'm going
[2:11:18] back to what I've done before I'm going
[2:11:20] back fishing they said we're going with
[2:11:21] you
[2:11:22] they didn't know what to do the standard
[2:11:25] was gone
[2:11:26] they were so tore up they didn't know
[2:11:27] what to make of it
[2:11:29] Hallelujah
[2:11:31] but then the standard appeared
[2:11:33] in a resurrected body
[2:11:36] and they looked at him and they still
[2:11:38] didn't know who he was until the
[2:11:40] standards started doing the same things
[2:11:42] that he'd done before
[2:11:44] and then they recognized it was Jesus
[2:11:48] oh Jesus we see you doing the same
[2:11:51] things that you did when you were here
[2:11:53] we see you doing the same things that
[2:11:56] you did in the book of Acts we see you
[2:11:58] doing the same things that you've done
[2:12:00] down to the age because you're the same
[2:12:02] yesterday today and forever
[2:12:04] and we know it's you Lord so we can
[2:12:07] rally around that standard there we can
[2:12:09] be stable though the water is getting
[2:12:11] higher and higher the confusion getting
[2:12:14] greater and greater and Lord will
[2:12:16] certainly yes absolutely we're losing
[2:12:17] property yeah no question about it
[2:12:19] beautiful things in our life are being
[2:12:21] destroyed precious things are being
[2:12:23] taken away from us by the endonation of
[2:12:26] the waters is coming but we are still
[2:12:28] stable because we are wading through we
[2:12:31] know which way to go and that's up on
[2:12:34] the promise of your word
[2:12:36] thank you Lord Jesus
[2:12:39] thank you Lord Jesus
[2:12:41] we worship you tonight father
[2:12:45] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:12:49] we bless your name Lord Jesus
[2:12:52] oh thank you Father
[2:12:55] Hallelujah to God can we just worship
[2:12:58] him just just a few minutes before we go
[2:13:00] I know you got to work tomorrow you got
[2:13:02] school and college and all of that sort
[2:13:03] of thing
[2:13:04] oh but man this is such an important
[2:13:06] time
[2:13:08] praise the Lord
[2:13:09] let's make a new commitment tonight what
[2:13:11] do you say that we're identified
[2:13:14] oh my let us run as they did to evil on
[2:13:17] Iwo Jima whenever that flag my Bronze
[2:13:20] Statues have been made of it pictures
[2:13:22] have circled the globe it's a proud
[2:13:24] thing for us as American sure and we can
[2:13:26] identify with it and you know many of
[2:13:28] you know the history and all of it the
[2:13:29] what it meant but it's a symbol of our
[2:13:31] freedom we can still point tonight to
[2:13:34] that cross and we can point to men what
[2:13:37] good did the flag Do by itself but there
[2:13:39] were men there who were willing to risk
[2:13:41] their lives and hold that frightful
[2:13:43] don't you understand God call minutes
[2:13:45] that's why Satan absolutely hates the
[2:13:46] ministry in this message the ministry
[2:13:49] has never been so charged and so stood
[2:13:51] against and so humiliated and still
[2:13:53] laughed at as it is this message not
[2:13:55] another message down to the seven Church
[2:13:57] ages has the ministry been publicly and
[2:14:01] privately ridiculed jokes made about it
[2:14:03] you not believe the things I've heard
[2:14:05] jokes made about preachers from the
[2:14:07] people in this message
[2:14:09] not realizing they're going to stand
[2:14:11] before God one day and answer for
[2:14:14] ridiculing what God's Prophet said was
[2:14:16] God's commanding officers that's the way
[2:14:19] God looks at him and if you don't you
[2:14:21] need the Holy Ghost that's your
[2:14:23] supplying facts that's what it is God
[2:14:25] called men or God's commanding officers
[2:14:28] that's what he said in 1962 in North
[2:14:31] Carolina they are God's commanding
[2:14:33] officers of God's inside dress work
[2:14:37] oh my soul you need to pray for every
[2:14:39] one of them pray for every one of them
[2:14:41] that God will help to hold that flag and
[2:14:43] not slip another standard up there and
[2:14:45] take this one down and put that one
[2:14:47] behold the original one brother it'll
[2:14:49] change people's lives it'll fill them
[2:14:51] with the Holy Ghost said it'll change
[2:14:53] their lives

[2:43:49] if God said it he'll do it
[2:43:53] and all he ever asked us to do was

[2:43:57] you enjoy the word of God tonight
[2:44:03] amen
[2:44:10] you know when I
[2:44:12] and I joined the army they gave me a
[2:44:15] steel pot
[2:44:18] an M16 rifle
[2:44:20] as it 203 Grenade Launcher I carried the
[2:44:23] m203 underneath the M16 I was on a 155
[2:44:26] Hauser
[2:44:28] far to project all about 18 miles I
[2:44:30] think on a Max charge they gave me
[2:44:32] combat boots
[2:44:34] but there's one thing they never gave me
[2:44:36] that was a promise of a victory
[2:44:39] but when I got in God's Army he gave me
[2:44:41] the helmet of salvation
[2:44:43] he shot my feet with the preparation of
[2:44:45] the Gospel
[2:44:46] The Shield of faith and the sword of the
[2:44:48] word
[2:44:49] but you know what he gave me the promise
[2:44:51] of a victory
[2:44:56] Hallelujah
[2:44:57] we got the victory
[2:45:01] second book
[2:45:02] amen

[2:45:21] father
[2:45:23] to those

[2:45:28] in this hour the Sons and Daughters of
[2:45:30] God on the Earth
[2:45:32] that you could have put us in Luther's
[2:45:34] day or Wesley's day or even the days
[2:45:36] when you walk the shores of Galilee but
[2:45:38] you reserved this to this generation
[2:45:41] that we would be of people Lord
[2:45:44] of the seventh age
[2:45:46] that would be the broad light in the end
[2:45:48] time that we would bring this light to
[2:45:50] the darkness of laodicea that they would
[2:45:52] know you're the same yesterday today and
[2:45:55] forever
[2:45:56] and Lord we believe we're standing here
[2:45:58] tonight with the seed of God that you

[2:46:05] ever an atom or a molecule we were on
[2:46:07] your mind we were in your thinking Lord
[2:46:09] Jesus the father we believe that this is
[2:46:13] the hour that you have chosen that we
[2:46:14] should walk upon the Earth that we would
[2:46:17] not walk as men but we would walk in the
[2:46:19] way that you intended for us to walk as
[2:46:21] Sons and Daughters of God made in your
[2:46:23] image
[2:46:24] Lord I pray tonight as we take these
[2:46:27] things that we have heard Lord may we
[2:46:29] hold that standard up in every home and

[2:47:11] broke my daughter out of the darkness
