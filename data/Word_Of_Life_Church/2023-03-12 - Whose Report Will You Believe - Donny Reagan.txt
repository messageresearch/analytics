[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] one more time this morning [Music] [Applause] keep pressing on I'm Gonna Keep resting [Music] foreign [Music] amen is that your testimony this morning amen Sage tried to stop us turn us aside we're going to keep pressing on this morning amen failure is not in our vocabulary this morning aren't you so glad to be in the house of the Lord once again you can be seated this morning a couple of announcements uh first wanted the library wanted to announce for the uh assisted hearing if you needed the assisted hearing they now have these available just kind of like the old church they're a little bit different this is a lanyard that hangs around your neck has a well a little bit difficult has a power button on the very buttons on the side if you have a hearing aid with a t-coil technology this will transfer into your hearing aid so you don't have to wear an earpiece if you have a hearing aid with a t-coil technology now brother Michael Bailey said if you didn't have one he could sell you one for a little bit of a a profit for him there but so if you have that if you don't have the T cool hearing aid you can plug this earpiece into the top of the lanyard and then put the earpiece over your ear and it just covers one of your ears if you'd like both ears they said that you can purchase that separately and it'll come inside both ears but these will be back here in the first vestibule when you go out they're on a charging dock if you need one pick one up after you're done with it take it back set it back on the charging station for the next service when someone picks that up so if you would remember that if you need to you can see where the Michael Bailey after service about that if you need any more instructions on that or one of the deacons would be happy to help you with that this morning all right also I want to remember Bible study is tomorrow night for 13 and up six to eight supper is provided in the fellowship hall so remember that amen Bible study tomorrow evening a couple of testimonies turned in this morning want to give God thanks sister Judy Dyer said she wants to thank God for a miracle Thursday morning depressed and very emotional says brother Dan call brother Donnie I put the phone to her ear he prayed she very quickly started to feel normal she just wants to thank God for that this morning amen so no we certainly are thankful for the miracle there I want to just remember them in their and our prayers amen no longer living in the area and I know their hearts desires to be here this morning also Sister Janet Payne has a testimony uh along with a prayer request she just wanted to give God praise brought her through a severe attack early Saturday morning I asked yesterday morning uh the name of Jesus is still more powerful than anything or anybody there is no one greater amen so thank the lord for keeping Sister Janet safe yesterday amen so we have a few prayer requests turned in this morning want to remember Mary Beth Holloway not feeling well today but John if you would prepare to come take these requests please remember uh brother Isaiah sister Shea and their boys they're all sick unable to be in service this morning so we want to remember their whole family this morning uh sister Heather Potter home sick has a fever and sore throat so we want to lift her up in our prayers also with Richard Baker severe back pain uh just hard to walk so we certainly want to lift brother Baker up before the Lord this morning I think that sister Baker is having severe back pain but the baker turns that in and it's hard for her to walk this morning so we want to remember her in prayer this morning also please remember uh Sister Janet Kennedy turned in at Greg Kennedy uh brother Eugene's uncle in need of a liver transplant this morning so we certainly want to take that need before the Lord and be in prayer for our dear brother there this morning amen if you have a need on your heart you just stand to your feet amen just hold your need before the Lord amen there is no one greater than Jesus this morning amen aren't you glad about that let's go to the Lord in prayer

through hard times and difficult times and you think boy well in a world are we ever going to make it through this thing Satan will tell you well you're going to lose it now yeah yeah you'll Buckle you'll Buckle under this pressure when it's all said and done you look around think wow I did make it I'm still alive actually I'm still breathing I'm holding on I'm the most importantly of all you love him more and love him greater this turns today is the Book of Numbers if you will Numbers Chapter 13 Verse 31 we greet you today in the name of the Lord it's a privilege for us to be together in the house of God and in the presence of God Numbers Chapter 13 Verse 31 will read down through verses 33. I'd like to speak to you today on whose report will you believe whose report will you believe but the men that went up was him said we be not able to go against the people of course this is the children of Israel that are at the brink of the land and God has promised them what he's going to do and Moses has sent some spies over some had one report some have another report listen at these men's report but the men that went up with him said we be not Abel to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and what does that have to do with it actually nothing does it if you look by faith for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had surged unto the children of Israel saying the lamb through which we have gone to search it is a land that eat us up the inhabitants thereof and all the men that we saw in it are men of great stature now this is not the truth this is not true it is lies God said this lamb is a landform of milk and honey but the way they saw it it looked like the lamb was devouring the people how foolish isn't it amazing how we look at things it's not even true and they said all the people they saw were giants that's not true either there was only a few Giants in this land I wonder how many of us have believed lies of the devil just like this and confessed it to it is a land that eat itself the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature and there we saw the Giants the sons of anak which come of the Giants we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight another lie so what did they do go up and ask them so how do I look in your sight like a grasshopper right so they're speaking on behalf of the sons of anak and these big cowards for the most part probably never even spoke to one of them so here they are telling lies to the people of God about their inheritance oh my goodness how many lots of be remembered today as we pray God bless you Mrs power hits together and only father it's such a wonderful privilege to be together today in your presence knowing father that as a one-time we as Gentiles were not even allowed into your presence only the outer Court was as far as we could go but today by your grace and mercy we stand here and knowing the Living God inhabits our bodies and for that we are so thankful I pray you would help us today catch our attention catch our thoughts our spirit our soul Lord God speak to us from your word may we see today each of us must believe a report and whose report will it be I want to say before I preach this today I want to believe yours speak to his father as only you can do in the name of the Lord Jesus amen God bless you you may be seated turn with me there if you'd like to read from your Bible or you can read it from the screen of life if you'd like to as well Numbers Chapter 14 verse 1. now let's look at the effect of this evil report so these men come back 10 of them and they have all these things to say and the people hear it and this is the effect of what these men had to say on the people and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night after what after what I just read to you and all the children of Israel all the children of Israel all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would God we had died in the land of Egypt mama or would God we have died in this Wilderness and wherefore hath the Lord brought us unto this land to Fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be a prey were it not better for us to return to Egypt and they said one to another let us make a captain they were tired of a prophet so now they wanted a captain because they felt like a prophet had deceived them they felt like a prophet had led them into a place to where they're all going to lose their lives so they want what they want a captain well now they're going after the military might and said of the power of God and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into Egypt is this not the same land that they were beaten is this not the same land that they had no freedoms they had no rights and they're wanting to go back to that Land Based on what the evil report of ten Liars well praise the Lord ten Liars well I I'm out to get them today I've got an indictment for every liar that is lying to you about your family lying to you about your healing lying to you about your salvation lying to you about your marriage lying to you that you're not going in the Rapture I've got an indictment for him today and I'm going to expose their hide to you to let you know they are liars and there is no true Center now notice in verse 6 and Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the son of Jeff funny now I preached this to you years ago that the word Caleb actually means dog and Jeff funny was a killazite which was not even a Jew but God did not have a special tribe by which he would allow Gentiles a 13th tribe to join into but we find like this Caleb the son of jafani and Ruth the moibitis and difference of the Gentiles most of them wound up in the tribe of Judah Judah means praise that's a good tribe for a gentile to be into I want you to notice now Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the son of jafani which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes and they spake unto the company to the children of Israel saying the land which we pass through to search it is an exceeding good Land wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute now these other guys said that it was a land that ate up the inhabitants thereof in other words the people that were there were barely surviving they were barely hanging on they was just making it from one church service to another and just raking and scraping a little bite to eat that ain't what God Said God said it's a land flowing of milk and honey God said I'll give you the rain and due season God said I'll give you the Dew but the way they projected it well how is the difference these guys were seeing some of the exact same land it depends on which eyes you look at it with if you look at it through the eyes of the flesh you'll see a land that in that the inhabitants barely hang on but if you look at it through eyes of faith you'll see it's a land that flows with milk and honey every good thing that we have need of will be in this land so I ask you today how do you sit some of You original people that were here when I came here 35 years ago some of y'all might remember this sermon title because I took this same text over 35 years ago and I asked at that time Happy Valley Church able or not able or not well I want to ask you the same question today are we able to take this land or should we just reside and say well we're not powerful enough we can't do it we fought so many devils and we've lost strength and we've lost courage and we can't do it no more and we're about ready to get up we are about ready when you say we don't include me in your affirmation because I've got a greater desire this morning than I've ever had in my life anybody with me today I've got more determination I've got more Zeal I've got more spunk if you want to put it that way I've got more Revelation that I had 35 years ago I'm better equipped to meet every devil Out of Hell better than I was 35 years ago but brother Donnie you're 66 I don't make a bitter difference my wisdom my strength my anointing will make up for from a lack of strength because I believe that we are not on the verge of giving up I believe we're on the verge of going in we're on the verge of Donnie why is the devil fighting us so hard it's because he knows we're right on the verge of complete Victory will ride on the verge of getting everything that God has promised for us in his word anybody believe it today but it's up to you you see whose report are you going to believe now notice when they speak unto them they speak unto all the company their children of Israel saying the land which we pass through to search it it's an exceeding good land if the Lord Delight in us and I love the way that he says this because when you look at it in the Hebrew he says if the Lord continue to Delight in us the way he has already amen it's not like they're wondering well really or wanting but he said it's more than likely he's going to continue to the way that he has if the Lord continue to Delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it to us a land which flowest with milk and honey only Rebel not ye against the Lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bred for us they are how is it that these people on the same Commission on the same Journey can cease things that are exact opposite it would make you think they are describing two different lands it's like they are describing two different locations but it wasn't exactly two different lands it was one land from two perspectives one land from two different sets of eyes well I want to lay the land before you today your promised land is the true baptism of the Holy Ghost in the message of the hour that's why Satan in the last few years has had a bunch of spies that come in Among Us and they found out this land made them sick to their stomach so what did they do they left and started making YouTube videos and all kinds of Articles of this and that and the other why because it was too rich for them it was too good for them it was two powerful form they couldn't take it so it made them sick to their stomach I ain't going back no more because it made me sick they preached Holiness they preach one God they preach water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus they preached an Apostolic Faith that's right that's the only kind I know I don't want a church entity I don't want churchism I want an Apostolic Faith that'll heal our sin that'll save our lost children that'll fill us with the Holy Ghost and will change our bodies when we need him oh how they must have felt that day their defense is departed from them you imagine their defense is departed from them and the Lord Is With Us fears them not so if you would have been there now thousands of years ago and you were sitting there well change the scenario it's not Donnie Reagan preaching to you this morning but it's the 10 spies on one side and Joshua and Caleb on the other side and they're putting to you the land so which report will you believe will you believe that it's laodicea it's so dark and so wretched nobody can live right in this day it is so dreary and we are so sad we're fighting more battles than we've ever fallen alive I can barely hold my hands up I can barely pray I can barely read my Bible I can barely have an affection when the song leader stands up to be able to clap my head I don't feel like going to church I don't feel like prayer I don't feel like reading my Bible I don't feel like saying amen it's all I can do to just get there or will you believe an another report we are closer to the resurrection than any generation that's ever walked on the face of the Earth as long as there's breaths in your son's body There's Hope as long as there's breasts in your wife's body There's Hope as long as there's breaths in your body There's Hope and let me say it this way even if they're laying dead there's still hope and if you don't believe me all you got to do is ask Lazarus he was a man that was dead and his nose had already fallen in and rigor mortis had start to set into his body but that didn't make no difference to Jesus because Jesus has power beyond death hell and the grave he has power beyond your doctor's diagnosis he has power beyond your MRI he has power beyond your CT scan and every other scam that you'll ever get I don't care what the doctor says there is no hope there is no way out that's his report that I want to tell you there's another report that my Bible tells me by his stripes ye are already healed my Bible tells me you are more than a conqueror Hallelujah my Bible tells me greater is he that is in you that he that is in the world who's reports will you believe now naturally I want you to believe this one but our enemy wants you to believe his I can't make you believe this report and this is the truth of the other side every devil in hell cannot make you believe theirs you choose to so the fault really ain't in the devil it's in US notice in verse 36 and the man which Moses sent to search the land who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up a slander notice this word a slander upon the land look at this word slander it means Whispering defamation evil report unfavorable saying so they brought up a slander against this lamb even those men that did bring up an evil report upon the land died by the plague before the Lord but Joshua the son of none and Caleb the son of jafani which were of the men that went to search the land lived still well look around it spiritually friends those who have brought an evil report slander against the message slander against God's Prophet slander against the men of God standing for the truth they have died spiritually but you are still alive Hallelujah I'm not talking about just in your natural body the worst death that can ever be is the death of the soul to be annihilated from God's presence but let me just say this to you today I still believe the land is a land Floyd with milk and of it I believe I promised lamb the message of the our young people Satan will do everything he can to pull you out of your promised land to tell you what it's not for you it's too hard you can't live it that's just for old people no it ain't just for old people it's for teenagers it's for eight-year-olds it's for 10 year olds it's for everyone that come wants to come this way well I'm 80. well good that's the age Caleb was whenever he went back to obtain his promise so if you're good from 8 to 80 and maybe even 100 or better if you want to believe and trust the Lord God who promised this land you can have the benefits of it brother you can pack grapes submit they're that big around my don't take a whole bushel of them to make you enough wine to get stimulated all it takes is one of them good old Holy Ghost old-fashioned grapes and you go to squeezing that thing out real good and the stimulation of Revelation arises in your heart and you speak to that disease in your body and say leave me in the name of Jesus you speak to that addiction you speak to that habit and you say I do not belong to you I belong to the Lord God and this is my inheritance yeah whose report will you believe read what's me in first Samuel 17 42. and when the Philistine looked about and saw David he disdained him to despise holding contempt to be vile and worthless for he was but of use remember David was a teenager you mean giant Killers Don't Have To Be 50. giant Killers don't have to be 80 by them Jack they can be teenagers how many of you teenagers want to be giant Slayers amen you don't hide away well brother Donnie I'm gonna wait till I'm 40. why waste all them Years start swaying them now at 10. start slaying them now at 12 and 13. Oh my he was about to use and ready and the word ready means red it's the same word that Adam comes from the word Adam means red so out of the Red Dirt God made the man so he was a ready looking guy and he was of a fair count in this word fair means handsome and beautiful so some of you sisters would have thought David was the cutest of those things you ever saw and you imagine no one ever Goliath saw him he was not looking for someone cute he wasn't looking for someone that was handsome but it looked even less inferior because he had no Battle Scars he had nothing on his hands nothing on his arms nothing anywhere else because he'd never quite fought a man of this size before now notice I'm the Philistine this is his affirmation this is the Philistines report and the Philistine said unto David and eye a dog which is the same word Caleb am I a Caleb that thou comest to me were staves and the Philistine curse David by his Gods poor fellow I was a trinitarian wasn't him so he cursed David by his gods and the Philistines said to David notice the report and he believes this brother die with everything that's in him the Philistine said to David come to me and I will give thy flesh um to the fowls of the air and to the Beast of the field this was Goliath's confession now David hears this confession and in reality it looks like it could very well happen this man stands according to the proportion of size they say around nine foot nine inches tall without one piece of armor on he would have weighed approximately 765 pounds with his mail on which was his mental part up here and his Grieves on it would have weighed on an average of another 120 pounds with his spear with his helmet with his shield with his sword he would have reigned around 900 pounds and David Wade won 10. but it's still not fair odds a 110 pound teenager against almost a thousand pound champion now this is what the Bible calls him a champion well I don't mind telling you today demons are champions but we're more than champions they've been fighting this battle my hell in the world can you and I uh 20 30 40 50 60 70 years old ever meet demons that have been doing this for thousands of years they have been fighting against humanity since the first human being come on the earth they are professional Liars professional deceivers they are professional wrestlers professional boxers the professional and everything they do and I'm certainly not a professional except I am a professional devil whipper Hallelujah that's exactly right all you say how can you do it you ain't old enough that's exactly right I'm not old enough but I have the great I deny living inside of me amen I have the Mighty God who is from eternity to Eternity and I'm not going to fight on my strength I'm not going to rely upon my reason I'm going to rely upon the strength of the Lord because David said the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want he maketh need to lie down in green pasture he lead us me beside the Still Water it is him disguiding us today we are not on our own church we are not under the leadership of some carnal fellow that come from Kentucky 35 years ago we are under the leadership and the headship of the Holy Ghost the same holy ghost that baptized the church and Acts 2. together foreign then said David to the philistine thou cometh to me with a sword and with a spirit with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the armies of Israel whom thou Hast defied I love this word hear of the name besham and it means the ineffable the ineffable name that it was so great it could not be pronounced I come to you in the name of besham the ineffable name so your trust is in your seal your trust is in your weapons and your armor but my trust is in the name and he had such confidence in that name that he couldn't even pronounce it it was so sacred what about you today that can say the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not only do you say it but you have that same name because you're part of him you are his wife and now your miserous Jesus watch this in the Paradox the prophet says because they seem the opposition so great they was afraid to meet the challenge of the boasting Goliath of the Philistines afraid to many another something about the way that he phrases this I love it because it reminds me of tests and trials and diseases and things sometimes that we go through and Yuri stands out there and he boasts and he brags and he boasts and he brag of what he's done and how big he is and how puny you are and how small you are have you ever noticed the devil when you go to messing up and you make a mistake and then you come back to God and that boasts and Philistine will stand right there against you again you messed up again didn't you yeah there ain't no mercy for you are there yeah how come on do you think God will put up with you well you might as well just turn your back what is that that's a boasting for listening trying to talk you out of repentance Roofing God wants us to walk right before him but even when we fall flat on our face it's up to you whose report you're going to believe the devil when you're falling fire on your face the devil will try to come and bring you a report there's no way there's no help there's no mercy but I hear my God say little children I write unto you that you're saying not but if any man sin we have an advocate with the Father which is Jesus Christ the righteous which is a perpetuation for our sins and not ours only but for the sins of the whole world there's Mercy for you when you fall there's Grace for you when you mess up there's Mercy for you to come back to God whose report will you believe will you stay on your face where you turn and go back to the slop of the world or will you come crawling back to the cross and say Lord God I'm sorry forgive me Lord help me to rise up and try one more time I will believe that report [Applause] notice this the prophet said there come a little stoop shouldered Ruddy looking fella his mama had baked some raisin pies and it brought him to give to his brothers and while he was Milling around now he wasn't over practicing swordsmanship he wasn't over by practice and how to polish armor he was just kind of Milling around minded his own business just delivering raisin pies the prophet said he was so small he was too little to even fight in the army oh yeah oh my hunting these brothers in the camp the Philistine walked out and made his boat said choose you a man and come over here and fight me we won't have any Bloodshed between the nation of course that's the way the enemy likes to break when he thinks he's got the edge on you how many has ever been there when he had the edge on you oh yeah bring him over here then we'll choose we'll fight and then if I'll kill him you serve us if he kills me we'll serve you notice this and watch his faith expressed that was Goliath on the other side and he stood out there and made his boasts many times bigger than David he had fingers 14 inches long my goodness he was a malmless big fella Philistine Giant and you almost David he was even too little to be in the army too much of a runt they couldn't even use him is there anything I could do uh maybe pack raisin cakes uh you couldn't even pack a five gallon bucket of water maybe you could bring us a quart at a time you're too little to do this and too little to that I guarantee one thing many of God's Mighty people have been looked down on others and called runs but yet God took that little run and done a great big thing with it amen I hope and pray to God there's some little runs sitting here today that the world say even some of the message folks were out here ain't been around long enough Hallelujah he can't do this on that and the other praise the Lord he's just a little bit of a run well I'd rather have her be a rent and have a great giant face than to be a giant in size and have a run face well praise the Lord if I've got to be a run I've always been run pretty much all my life but I'll tell you one thing when it comes to Faith I don't want to have run faith I'm going to have grunt Faith so whenever I start toward the devil he starts growing because he says oh no here he comes again here he comes again that's the kind of child of God that we want to produce share a Word of Life Church not people that are barely hanging on from Sunday to Wednesday and Wednesday to Sunday but people that love the Lord they pray when they don't feel like it they read their Bible when they don't feel like it they come to church when they don't feel like it why because they may look like a run but they've got grunt faith and when they speak Satan backs up all right but David now remember it was revealed to David hey so here's the armies of the Living God standing in their own land and there's a boast in uncircumcised Philistine out there we'll call him cancer we'll call him paralytic oh come on children how them boasting Philistines today in the form of disease and weakness sickness yeah and they like to brag aha your great face huh look at what the doctor said look at this look at that look at the other you're going to look at something but which are you going to believe what David was no kind of a match for him not with any kind of a weapon he was no match that man's shoulders probably 10 12 feet across whoa his shoulders 10 to 12 feet across he was probably saying a 14 15 feet high spear like a Weaver's needle probably 20 foot long he could stand right here and just behead you all just the blade on it may be four foot across like a sheet of plywood and up comes a little curly headed ready which means he had red spots a little Mama's looking boy and he said let me out of him let me at it whoa whoa whoa boy Whoa whoa what in the world is the matter with you broadhead for a deer brothers wouldn't we like to have a broad head like out on our Arabs we take out a whole herd of deer with me you should want action decapitate the whole herd and here he comes and that little girl said oh let me out of what in the world let me ask that God and say Lord have mercy I had a Holy Roller I'll tell you one thing friends I need what I believe sometimes we need a few holy wrote or sitting Among Us foreign the god that took me out of the paws of the bear took me out of the paws of the light how much more will he deliver that uncircumcised for listing in my hand notice when it was revealed David become Fearless Fearless a human being he didn't even have the Holy Ghost he's a teenage boy he don't even have the Holy Ghost and he become Fearless he said today I'll cut your head off amen quick Our God by grace in that crucial moment when the decision had to be made the same God that produced The Grace on that day God the seed of faith and that little hunchback looking boy you imagine him going around little hunts about fella Hallelujah the Lord is my shepherd glory to God hallelujah a poor little guy he didn't hardly know nothing but he might not have known nothing but he knew the right person to know a little Hunchback of a fella he said notice the Giant on the other side he didn't believe it neither will the come just remember you're not trying to convince your lymphoma you're not trying to convince your concept you want to convince you and then whenever you stand on God's word and speak with the authority of the word of God that thing will obey your voice whether he believes you or not he laughed and said to my dog you sent a kid out here to fight me he said I'll pick you up on the end of my spirit and let the birds eat your flesh but you see that didn't shape David at all now you may not understanding looking at him that dude's head will be about this big around have eyeballs about like that oh my God you imagine it bad his eyes had his own personal ceiling fan he just cooled himself down just batting them eyelashes stand right up there with that big broad head on the end of that thing four foot long and he stood right there he was as confident as he could be he done said his affirmation I'll feed your body to the fowls of the air I'll destroy you but David didn't believe what goliath said David believed what David said I want you to notice it was not the Lord God that thundered this out of heaven and David is repeating it the Lord God gave David a revelation but it wasn't enough for the Lord to say it David had to say it and David needed to hear David say it Oh Glory so this is David's confession first Samuel 17 46. this day will the Lord deliver thee unto my hand and I will smite thee and take thine head from thee and I will give watch it David watch it and I don't get in the flesh I'll give the carcasses of the host Lord have mercy he's got beside himself now now it's not just challenging Goliath but he goes to stepfather and said not only you not only you I'll give the whole bunch of you wow all right you imagine I'm saying Mercy fat poor little guy man what it's it's child cruelty it's child cruelty for them to send that little fat out there look at him the poor little fellow look at him he is so he's caught up you imagine David but now he's glory to God hallelujah he's a probably a worshiping or jerking around there and wiping the sweating hallelujah thank you Lord God thank you Lord God I don't know I believe in words Lord I've slayed a whole bunch of them I'll say the whole bunch of them of course his brothers are oh dear God anybody know who's this guy is I've never seen the boy in my life I don't have a clue no doubt from some Holy Roller family some bunch of Pentecostals come into the message and won't believe nothing another oh my so disobedient don't even obey what we tell them to do who in the world would think this little fellow could stand out there but you imagine the Heavenly Host as a host of God's angels to standing there right on the edge of Eternity and they was looking down in the valley of elah and there they were this gigantic man and a little bitty shrimp of a fella scrawny little Hunchback bent over God but he was saying God's word he was saying what God had anointed him to say that was no Pastor there to encourage him there was no mama to encourage you there was no Deacon there was no use leader to encourage David but David had a revelation from God foreign are you gonna believe David I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air yeah right and to the wild beast of the earth that all the ice may know not that I'm a great fella I'm a mighty warrior I'm this I'm that but that they may know there is a God in Israel and all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with a sword of spear for the battle is the Lord's and he will give you into our hands speak that to your disease speak that to your blood pressure speak that to your your eyesight Hallelujah and it came to pass on the Philistine of rose came and Drew near do now to meet David that David hasted and ran you've got to be kidding me I mean here's this gigantic man that wasted nearly a ton a half a ton and he's got all this this equipment for him and David ain't just wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute let me have a little wisdom let me use a little wisdom I'll come back in about 13 years after I've learned a little more on how to handle the word I'll come back I need to fast and pray over this I'm sorry I I got ahead of myself I need a fast in prayer but instead of doing that David kind of girded up himself and said come on big boy you ready for it come on come on I can't wait to tear into you you imagine his brothers and all the rest of them said Lord God have mercy how could you ever take down a man like that and David said Lord God how could you ever miss a Target that big hallelujah how in the world can you not do it when you're anointed you imagine the host of eight were gathered around that teenager the prophet said that little old boy weighed about 110 pounds scrawny draw it in little fella maybe didn't get too much to eat on the back side of the desert but he stayed with God that's the main thing Here Come Little David just a bouncing in the spirit hahaha what a Holy Roller Victory already Hallelujah why place the name of the Lord God of Israel before him all devils in hell my friends he wasn't just facing the Army the first thing all the devils in hell against one teenager [Music] all the devils in hell couldn't wait across that little David dancing in the spirit you mean dancing before the battles won my goodness dancing and worshiping he had even won the battle yet but faith says it's dead go ahead and dance a little bit oh David just a dancing in the spirit brother man gets pretty excited on this you haven't heard it all Glory Hallelujah David put his hand in his bag in this case you see this little Stone right here just happens to come from the same Valley that David was in the valley of elah I stood there a few years ago so I loaded up my little bag full just a smooth Stone washed coming from the rivers and the creeks and all you stand down in that place that's just a little dried up a branch of a thing where water comes whenever the water rains and comes off the mountains so David reaches down and he picks up f a i t h j e s u s g r a c e and he picks them up and puts him in his pocket and said just in case I Ever Need a Little Faith in Jesus to provide the grace I need to take the head off of a big giant I've got five right here but remember he was prophesying because Goliath had four more Brothers hallelujah hallelujah David wasn't just getting one for old Goliath but he's getting the rest of his brothers too you boys have crossed the wrong one now can you imagine this giant had stood down their day after day after day and made his boasts and they believed his report and they shook every time he got up but this time that brag fell on the ears of the right guy the wrong guy for Goliath but the right guy for Israel is there anybody in this place this morning that this message is going to fall on the right ears yes I claim my healing yes I claim my Deliverance [Applause] David put his hand don't get nervous now I ain't gonna hit nobody but this and took fence a stone and slightly and smote the Philistine and the forehead that the stone sunk into his forehead and he fell upon his face now wait a minute a stone moving a thousand miles per second there's no way he should fall forward your brother said huh no whenever you hit a hit an animal and you hit it good enough and it'll jump and sometimes it'll do this why it's a velocity coming out of that gun and whenever it releases that bullet according to the foot pounds that it has inside of that and the force of that just knocks that thing backwards that way how is it that a force like this hit him in the forehead and instead of him going like this what you would normally think instead of him going that way he goes this way huh why God wanted to make him bow God wanted to make all glory to God I can't wait for the time when gas vows to the bride I can't wait for the time when cancer and sickness and disease of people that we are praying for will bow and say there is a mighty God among them people there is a savior among them people God didn't want him to fall backwards but Face Forward foreign [Applause] the prophet sat there he went up there just dancing in the spirit as hard as he could Why by faith he saw the victory he saw the victory he took his little sling and one of these stones and give a dance so he dances a little bit foreign yes I'm in the spirit I'm anointed to preach he said Lord have mercy I'm scared I'll get in the flesh if I do that you're in the flesh when you get up of a morning you're in the flesh when you drink your coffee you're on the flesh when you eat your bacon and eggs what are you scared the desert I'm more concerned about getting out of the Flesh and I am in it some of y'all ain't moves about your spiritual joints and crack and pop up snap crackle pop it's been so long since you've worshiped much [Applause] he took this little old sling in there one of these Stones he'd give a dance and here he comes coming around oh I see Goliath saying ho ho ho but if goliathan knew what coming he'd been saying no no no no no no not ho ho ho ho but you see it depends on which report that you believe will it be no or will it be whole You've Got to Believe setting here this day whose report will you believe are we able to take this lamb are we able on God's word to stand are we able to say Victory by the mystery of God ordained in you and me Hallelujah are we able [Applause] left-handed Donnie he had five stones f-a-i-t-h in five fingers wrapped this string around j-e-s-u-s here he comes oh brother look out Goliath you got to fall and when he set that loose the Holy Ghost got a hold to that little Stone and picked up a speed of about a thousand miles my brother died surely you don't I do but there's no way scientifically possible that the velocity of it I'm interested in science I ain't interested in velocity when it comes to Faith if my God wants to take this one right here this morning and make it do the same thing he can do so don't you understand you quote the quotes you quote the scripture and you think they're so little they're in so insignificant all you need is the same power right here to get behind that scripture get behind that quote and look how devil here we come you ready it struck that giant right between the face and he fell forward hallelujah oh my look it goes on to say talking about David he danced up there jumped up on him I remember David didn't have a sword but David Yuri is still dancing whoa I believe the report of the Lord I believe the reporter of the Lord and he just gets right and I said it just so happened I ain't got no sword but Goliath's got a good so he reaches down in the name you cancer I cut your head off foreign [Applause] for the day when the Lord God will drop that sword and beheading into the hands of our brother Ron Spencer and he'll be able to climb up on the heads of that devil that devil that is tormented him and made him sit day in day out that Devil he's battled and be able to stand right up and say this day I will remove your head how long for the day when God will drop it in my little daughter's heart and she'll be able to climb upon that body of that cancer Hallelujah come upon the body of that concern say in the name of that Sim I beheads hell I'd be held excited Hallelujah [Applause] so David prevailed over the listing for The Sewing and with a stone and smoked the Philistine and slew him and everybody said and slew him but there was no sword in the hand of David therefore David ran and stood upon the philistine and took his sword and Drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him oh I thought he already slew it some devils need double slayed Hallelujah took his sword his sword he said brother Tony why don't God always just heal people by Divine Healing and miracles and totally bypass all the scans and all the doctors and all the treatments and all that because there's some of these Devils God wants scientific pictures to prove it was there but it ain't there no more so he wants to kill the devil and then have a scientific record praise be to God well there ain't never been nothing like it before why he wants to double slam before cut his head off there with him when the Philistines Saul that their champion was dead they fled David believed the report of the Lord brother Josh whose report whose report Brother John Brother JD who's it for it Hallelujah Hallelujah but the doctor says and the doctor said brother Donnie are you going to believe that report are you going to believe the report by his stripes I am healed my brother Donna I've been dealing with the sadness of a departed loved one I'll never get over it I'll never get over to you you're going to believe that report or are you going to believe the report according to the book of Corinthians The God Who comforteth us and all of our troubles yes I know some of you are still dealing with sorrow and all because of loved ones has passed in the last couple of years but God don't want you to live in this life all down God don't want you being depressed young people God don't want you being sad God wants young people that's got joy unspeakable and full of Glory God wants teenagers God wants young men God wants young women that are so full of the power of God that when you work on your job the people say I don't know what they believe I know they're dressed funny but I ain't never been around a young girl like that in my life why God's looking for another David God's looking for somebody that'll believe his report [Applause] thank you can use another example read with me in Nehemiah chapter 4 verse 1. but it came to pass when sent belet heard that we builded the wall he was Ross and took great indignation and mocked the Jews spake before his brethren in the army of Samaria and said now here's a report what do these feeble Word of Life people do will they fortify themselves well they sacrifice will they make an end in a day yeah exactly we will one of these days we're going to get up and it may look like the same old same old regular day just my own opinion probably the rap shall happen on money one of the worst days of the week and in that day we'll make a change forever well they revived the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish and tobiah the ammonite now watch another doctor join in with his diagnosis now tobiah the ammonite was by him and he said even that which they built if a fox go up he shall break down their stone wall oh no that's their report Nehemiah what do you got to say Nehemiah 4 14 I looked and Rose up and said unto the Nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of them remember the Lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses now whose report are we going to believe we're carried back in time now or standing around the wall the wall is Rubble it's a mess absolute tore all two pieces and we've got these people over here which have great governmental power they have ranked and Authority back in Persia are they going to believe them are they going to believe this one man which was a cup Bearer he did not have any royalty he did not have any great position but he brought the king a drink of water when he wanted it and brought himself up and RC as we'd say and yet he's the one standing up I'm telling you fight for your family fight for your children fight for your daughters yes brother sister I don't have a PhD I don't have an lld I don't I did not graduate from some Bible School somewhere but I do have in my resume that I laid hands on cancer-ridden people and seen God miraculously touch them I've seen God stop heart attacks right in the middle of them at the Johnson and City Medical Center I've seen people around the world get saved get filled with the Holy Ghost get resurrected by the power of God if you're looking for a degree I don't have it if you're looking for a supernatural I do if you're looking for the power of God we do that's our identification [Applause] Nehemiah 4 20 in what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet Resort you thither unto us our God shall fight for us Nehemiah 6 3 and I sent Messengers unto them saying I am doing a great work so that I cannot come down why should the work cease whilst I'll leave it and come down to you this is nehemiah's report what's yours

against us but we will say like Nehemiah we are doing a great work for the Lord God and we don't have time to come down we don't have time to sit around and feel sorry for ourselves we don't have time to to spend a lot of time groaning and complaining and say why me why me why not us why not us you're looking for someone who will stand with you in the midst of hell oh if we were looking for preachers today in the message it could go into the hospitals preachers would be standing in line we could look for preachers today that could stand and discern and stand and have people to follow them and do all this oh yes they'd be standing up everywhere and how many preachers wants to be run down hated talked about ridiculed fight hell every day they live the lion would get shorter and shorter but I believe you've got some still standing in that line Lord they know the way isn't easy and they're not asking for it to be but what they're asking for Hallelujah heavenly father in the
