be U worth your effort to be able to be here in the house of the Lord um let me read one question and then um um read a scripture and then we'll we'll pray I know that God can hear our thoughts and I've been wondering if he hears all our thoughts if we are held accountable for any bad thoughts well let me say I hope not amen anybody else hope not 2 Corinthians chapter 10 verse 5 casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ let's just pray together if you would now father we thank you for this time that we can be together and Lord we're grateful that young people have a desire to serve you to give you their youth father how grateful we are that they want to know they want to understand your way and they want to be better Christians or consecrated to you their lives filled with your presence so Lord I can tell from these questions that I got they have things misund understandings misgivings just things that Satan tries to put them through and they want to know what's right I pray tonight that you would help me Lord to be able to get out of the way and answer these as best as I can speak to us would you father in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask amen God bless you you can be seated this of course is not just a question for the Youth we know that God certainly knows all of our thoughts and he can hear our thoughts whoever it was that asked this question then we would think well if God does know all of our thoughts then there's many thoughts that goes through our mind that certainly are not pleasing to him and not his thoughts then are we held accountable for those thoughts anybody here today be honest and say there's been thoughts that's went through your mind today that you didn't like and you wouldn't you hope that God don't hold you responsible now you wonder how that can be how can a person who loves the Lord Jesus and is serving him with all of their hearts how can thoughts go through our minds that are not pleasing to the Lord and we know once we become converted and become children of God then our nature changes and the inside of us becomes the throne room of the presence of God but our human element is still not saved still doesn't have the Holy Ghost my brain don't have the Holy Ghost Welly I wish it did don't you don't you wish your brain had the the Holy Ghost and your flesh had the Holy Ghost and everything about you but it doesn't but what has the Holy Ghost is your soul from within you that's the control tower that's your throne room so in other words what God did was God ousted that evil nature that you had and the King that lived in your soul was the devil and God liberated you from that but you're still in this cuckle bur outside so thoughts that go through our mind can be either good or evil and we know that the Battleground is not the soul once you're converted your Battleground is no longer in your soul God and Satan do not inhabit your soul at the same time but God and Satan will both fight right here a Battleground for those of you that's different visited different Battlegrounds whether it's a civil war or Revolutionary War or whatever it would have been and they might still have remnants of cannons and and holes in the ground and all types types of things that they found and that was traces of both armies being there and it's the same way with our mind both God and the devil has access to this up here so what do both of them do God will fire his word God will anoint his men and they will preach and bring scriptures and quotes and and so on and they are firing at the enemy but if it's a real Battleground then the enemy also has the right to fire so what will he fire he will he will fire fear doubt unbelief anxiety whatever he can do to try to come against us and remember brother B told us that Satan's only weapon is to get you to deny yours or doubt yours that's his only weapon but if he can convince us he's got all this great power boy he could just do anything he wants to do don't you believe that for nothing he cannot he cannot even make us do wrong we have to be willing to to do that but in our minds because our minds are successible just like your dreams anybody ever had dreams and it was horrible dreams you know whether they was uh unclean dreams or just scary types of Dreams our subconscious Satan also has access still to that because it's not yet been fully redeemed and in every aspect that he can so when brother BR preaches to us a greatest battle ever fought he laid out 10 gates for us to be able to see see taste feel here imagination conscience memory reason and affection so that's 10 Gates that Satan has access to try to get to every one of us in the soul there's only one there's only one gate and that's your choice so he will try from the 10 out here from getting our attention if it would be through sight or through hearing and then maybe imagination or conscience or the memory of something that you did or the memory of a pleasure of a sin that you once did and he would try to gain access to that all 10 of those are aiming toward the one gate which is in the soul which is your choice then you choose do I want to go that way or do I want to go that way I will oby what the king says on the throne of my heart Carolyn I spoke to a a sister after service last night and I told her I said I've got the question tomorrow night along these same lines that she actually had a council session for and I told her that the ible says let not therefore sin reain in your mortal body and the word Reign is a Greek word which is basilios and it actually means to be king in your body but when Peter wrote that he separated your flesh from your soul and he's talking to two people I if you've ever noticed it or not but he said let not sin therefore rain in your mortal body so he's separating The Immortal from the Mortal and telling you and I that we have the ability by the new births to tell the devil you're not rainning in my body you're not reigning you may bother me and you may tempt me and we know that he will but he does not have the ability to be king unless we crown him King now it can be so when it comes to sickness or disease or Temptation or just even uh feeling like you're not a part of of the church feeling your young people and say you don't feel like you're part of certain clicks and whatever that would be in the young people like there are't old people and you think well I really don't belong and nobody likes me and nobody really speaks to me and you know all that sort of thing we all feel that way and and we can go through those things and in our mind those thoughts come there well you're not really needed you're not accepted you don't make enough money or whatever more and and Satan knows exactly how to attack us in our mind and I want you to notice this that brother Bram said don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time I'm saved I have God in my heart I believe him with all of my heart do you believe in Divine Healing with all my heart let your testimony always and your thoughts everything never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it but now let's not stop there let's continue on to read when it starts that don't entertain it well you say I can't keep thoughts from coming well be like the farmer that said he couldn't stop the third the birds from flying over his place but he sure could stop him from roosting so every one of us Satan has access into our mind and he will put all types of thoughts there thoughts that's against God any y'all ever even had thoughts come in your mind I'm not sure there is a God I don't know if there is a God any of y'all ever went through that I have and I'm a preacher so I guarantee you that Satan does that but I know exactly where that's coming from God's not going to hold me responsible for that thought because he knows my heart he knows that's not who I am so if you're like me and I'm sure you are if you're born again then when a thought goes through your mind that so troubles you and bothers you and the Lord knows in your heart you was not the one who's even the author of that thought you've heard me say it before that Satan is the type of being that he'll talk you into Rob in the bank and call the cops on you well you so got the gun in your hand well that's the way he does with thoughts he will put thoughts in our mind turn right back around and say now ain't you ashamed of yourself you claim you're a Christian how could you be a Christian and let that thought be in your mind you know what he's trying to do he's trying to condemn you for something that he did himself so you need to just put him right in his place and say Satan you're a liar that's not what I want that's not who I am that come from you I will not be held accountable for that leave me get out of my mind and leave me alone you know when the when the devil came to the Lord Jesus and the scripture says that that Satan left him for a season you imagine the Son of God and the angels then came and ministered to him so the devil quit tormenting the Lord Jesus for amount of time who knows how long it was but it wasn't that even Jesus Jesus being the Son of God that he was free from Satan's thoughts and his battles and his trials but he knew how to meet the devil so a lot of the things when Satan come against him if you're the Son of God do this do that Jesus never even address that question and where we waste our time is trying to argue with the devil and try to convince him we're saved and when we can spend all day doing that and he'll come back tomorrow with the same old nonsense as that while you're not saved quit wasting your time trying to convince the devil you're saved just know you are and know that he's a defeated foe notice he said you can be like the farmer you can't stop the birds from flying over but he sure could stop them from roosting so that's a good thing you can't help the thoughts when they come but don't entertain them now that's the part that you and I will make mistakes on that we will entertain thoughts God so developed us when he created man and the Garden of Eden that he has a first conscience a subconscious a psyche he has things about him that are committed to the subconscious your blood pressure your heart rate U walking down steps we walk down them steps and we get used to it over and over again we don't have to even look at the steps we don't even count the steps no doubt you've done it before to where you go to looking at them and you'll stumble a little bit why you took it from the subconscious and started applying it to your first conscience and it enter reacted and it crossed the wavelength or the signal going to the muscles and your legs and you almost fell flat of your face why you was pulling it from the wrong Source but how many times have you went up and down them same steps and you don't even think about it aren't you glad you're breathing is committed to your subconscious You' never sleep if it wasn't if your heart rate was not committed to that when you enter into the deep cycles of sleep and your heart rate lowers your blood pressure lowers all that where's all that coming from you and I are out as cold as we can be sleeping like a log as we would say but God committed so much of that to the subconscious what it's the same way with our faith when we try so hard to have faith we're pulling it from our subconscious that's where brother B talks about Jesus he said that Jesus never stepped to the bow of the ship and said now let me see if I've got enough Faith to speak to the storm it was in his subconscious he didn't try to make it happen he knew who he was and he beli believed who he was and whenever we actually weaken ourselves whenever we try to pull our faith walk from the subconscious part and they say I'm going to do this I I've got this God I'm going to do this that other no we'll mess up sure as we do it but whenever it comes to this part notice he said God can only bless you as you confess that he's done it for you I said that we have to keep saying this he's our high priest of our confession Hebrews 3 he said he's the high priest of our conf and he can only do for us as we accept it believe it and confess it now look at those words accept a believe B confess C that's all the ABCs you'll need to know to be able to overcome the devil then when that enemy comes against you you stand right there on the promise of the word Now watch how you bring it over into Divine Healing don't think sitting there in the wheelchair shair that you're hopeless and helpless you're not don't let that negative thought ever pass through now I wonder how we would have thought about that if we were sitting in a wheelchair now he didn't say what was wrong with the individual if it was paralysis if they were crippled if they were weak he didn't really say but if it was someone that had a polio or paralysis in their body and they knew they knew what the doctor said there's absolutely no hope for you how how are you going to keep a negative thought out of your mind when maybe your legs are totally numb your feet are numb you have absolutely no feeling at all and yet he told this person man or woman whoever it was don't let that negative Sal ever pass through don't let it anchor you can't help it from going through your mind but don't let it stop now Satan knows his right he knows exactly what he can do he knows what he has power as being a fallen angel he has an element of authority and he El has an element of jurisdiction every demon in hell was once an angel of God and when they fell they kept the power that they were given by God in the category they were made in and they know exactly what they can do they also know their limitations but they know if they can talk us out of who we are what little bit of power they have left will overcome us if they can get us to doubt our weapon so this is why it constantly will come in the battle of the mind I've stood in different cities of the world Carol a few years ago was over in Switzerland and we was able to go to a uh some castles that were there in France and the southern part of France and and um really beautiful place I love those ancient buildings like that and you see that they might have walls that would be 2 feet thick some of them would be 3T some of just unbelievable but every one of those castles had a vulnerability and in the towers that they would have on the outside wall and they would have a slit maybe laid in the masoner and it would be 6 to8 feet tall and about that wide would be as big as it was well actually there was a restaurant there and we had lunch one day and it was it was an ancient castle and yet this is where the men would stand and they would shoot their ARS out that narrow place but every one of them had a vulnerable position and that vulnerability was the gate so why try to go through a wall that is two foot thick whenever you have a wooden gate so they would study and many of them they would build them up on a high heill and they would build a rampart up and that'd make it real narrow when they'd come through the gate so you wouldn't be able to get a chair charot and horses or um something wide because the gate was the most vulnerable part that's where we are the most vulnerable and our walk with God see taste feel smell hear love imagination conscience memory reason and affection our a vulnerability now then if they would break through the gate then they would have things inside the gates uh we were there in Jerusalem a few years ago and you look up like this and what you see is a Place cut out in this Stone it's made to where they can pour hot boiling oil and water down on the people who did make it through the gates so they tried to make the gate as strong as possible but they knew if they did this and this and this the enemy would study it and the enemy would do this and this and this and this and then override what they did so they would have one precaution and then another precaution so if they made it through the gate itself then they would have another part there and they'd pour boiling water and they'd pour oil on top of them they would have rocks they did everything that they could because their vulnerability laid in the gates and this is where arrows are I I love this question because somebody asked brother brenaman this in 1964 brother Ram please explain how a person knows if he's thinking his own thoughts or if the devil is placing thoughts in his mind to make him think wrong now actually this person answered their own question especially if you know you do not want to think them they answered their own question but I'm glad the prophet didn't just say that and stop but he wanted to take this question now it's a very good question worded very very good well then you know he said if it's contrary to the word it's the devil's thinking if it's with the word it's God's thinking if it's the wrong thoughts it's the devil now I want you to notice though how he's answering this he's answering this not only on the question but he's answering this on the last statement that the individual said the individual said especially when you know it's not what you want so he didn't answer answer this question just across the board with every evil thought and all that he answers the question from a sincere heart of a person that wants to be right and the first thing he says if it's contrary to the word it's the devil's thinking if it's with the word it's God's thinking if it's a wrong thoughts it's the devil if it's good thoughts of the word of God it's God's thinking if the case may be that the devil is placing thoughts in your mind about a certain thing how may it be overcome or got rid of take the vice versa from it if the devil makes you think that that you are if you know you're a Christian now there again notice where he's coming back coming back to what they said if you know that you are a Christian and he tries to make you think you're not a Christian just take the Versa and say I am a Christian I want you to look at how hard this is I mean it's going to take a pocket scientist isn't it to be able to to do this a't it going to take a a college graduate and four or five different degrees in Theology and aren't we going to have to labor and and just be so smart and so super intelligent no we're not it's going to be so simple that the weakest person in this building tonight and the weakest person that'll be streaming this and there would be in Africa and New Zealand and Australia and all over the world but they'll be hearing these so the weakest person whoever you are can take this right here and defeat the devil and his own grounds so if you know your heart is toward God and you love him with all of your heart let that be the pivotal point that when Satan comes against you that you know that's not who I am that's not what I want I love him I love him I don't want this in my mind I don't want this in my heart then you know you can take the vice versa now if you're evil you're rotten you're not born again and you're a sinner well you're a dirty rotten low down Pig and you're eating slop then you like that sort of thing I don't think there's anybody like that here tonight you wouldn't be here if you were so why are you here for you here to to be damned to Hell anybody come here tonight to be damned anybody come to be turned over to a reprobate mind anybody here that's that come with your mind made up I come intentionally to blashe the Holy Ghost so I'll be lost forever and ever and ever of course not why are we here for because we love the Lord Jesus and we hope that somebody will ask a question that maybe will help us well I'm not sure who asked this but I thank him for asking because it helped me in answering it so we can be benefited can't we so look how simple now that it is it's not that you have to be a preacher and a great but brother Donnie I can't remember the quotes like you can I can't remember like brother darl I I just can't do it you don't have to notice how he simplifies that we can act absolutely as I told the individual last night according to the word of God if you will resist the devil he will flee from you he will actually run from you you like a chicken a coward because he is terrified of a son or daughter of God that knows their position you don't have to be a preacher you don't have to be a prophet but whenever you know you love the Lord Jesus with all of your heart and it kills you if you have a bad dream or a bad thought or if you mess up y'all still mess up of course you do it kills you when you do it and he hates it when you recognize who you are and you just stand right there where you are notice he said as long as your experience matches in God's word say I'm a Christian anything else the same way when you answer this please pray for me to overcome this as I am not by myself well I can sure say Amen to that can't you now watch what he says God grant your overcoming ever who you are may your thoughts just go right on the back on the other side and say I am a Christian I am a believer Satan you have no holdt on me now he didn't have to say this next paragraph that I'm going to read but I'm so glad he did frankly I'm standing right here now saying the same thing keep from fainting right here at the pulpit that's right four or five times I've almost pitched over the pulpit that's the truth God knows that's right so here brother brandham is actually not only answering their question he's living their question so here he is preaching and I know it may seem so odd to you a preacher gets up and preaches under the anointing of the Holy Ghost and if he preaches fast the way I do and brother Daryl does and the other brothers that preach fast and you're talking 90 M an hour and at the same time you're doing that the devil is talking to you and if I'm up preaching and say I'm just a preaching preaching preaching and somebody gets up and they have to go out to go to the bathroom or they have to get up and go take their baby out or whatever and Satan will say you made them mad look at them they're leaving uhoh her husband got up too boy you've made them really mad yeah now you've done it now can you imagine you preaching 90 M an hour and stuff like that going through your mind at the same time you say Brother Don you got a split personality no I got a gift in my life that gets anointed but that's separate from me so here I am standing fighting battles while I'm preaching all hell breaking loose in your mind it's a wonder you even know what what your name is m has been able to do this so here brother brandham is fighting that very thing so he's not telling them something that was just good for them he was telling them what he was doing at the same time don't you appreciate a man of God like that question for brother Donnie if you haven't gone through a great trial does that mean you don't have the Holy Ghost no let me let me say this to you tonight our trials as well as our victories and our walk with God are predestinated to us sometimes whenever I will counsel with people and they will share with me and if Carol is in there with us with me um the thing that they are going through and the burden that they're bearing and um how how difficult it is or this question that they have in their mind and I'm sitting there and listening and praying that God will help me and give me the answer for them if if possible and whenever they will tell me what they're going through and compared to what maybe I've been through that day and what I went through in service that night and uh I was shot by this preacher and blasted by this one and I got this email and this text and this WhatsApp and U this preacher sent me a bunch of quotes uh trying to tear me down right before I walked out which is what happened the last question answers we had right before I walked out and then that person tells me their their problem and I think man alive if that was my problem glory to God oh Jesus I just be floating around on clouds and but you see I don't say that to belittle that person's problem to them that is no doubt a great problem now you can see where a person maybe would hear someone that's been through a terrible thing and they would look at themsel and say I've never really been through anything like that so does that mean I'm not born again no young man young woman whoever it was that asked this it does not I personally believe and I can prove it by the scripture and by the message that some people are ordained of God to go through more than others are some are ordained of God to suffer tremendous things in their life others will look at them and even say it publicly verbally how can they deal with that how can they go through that and and still maintain their sanity read with me in 2 Corinthians 11: 23 Paul in the Corinthian Church now he had to take more of a self-defense mode than he did in some of the other churches also in the Church of galatia because he was being attacked by the false teachers and the false prophets Paul was the one who founded these churches and the false teachers was coming in and trying to lead the people away from Paul actually blasting Paul and saying Paul was a false prophet and the sad part about it was some of the galatian Believers and some of the Corinthian Believers actually left Paul and started following these false preachers which is heartbreaking to me I mean you just think how in the world could they have been that ignorant so Paul has to go into this mode no doubt as a man of God it was very unpleasant for him it was very unpleasant indeed so want you notice he said are they Ministers of Christ I speak as a fool I am more in labor more abundant in Stripes above measure in prisons more frequent and deaths of of the Jews five times received our 40 Stripes save one 39 Stripes Thrice was I beaten with rods once I was stoned Thrice I suffered shipwreck a night and a day have I been in the Deep wow now if you've ever studied the life of Peter or not Bartholomew Matthew Mark Luke andronicus Antiochus many of the early uh Church age fathers and the writers many of them want their great hardships but I have to get to this day find anyone who went through what Paul said that he did we all believe John was a great man right John was bold and allil 24 hours on the aisle of patmas but John was the only one of the Apostles that was allowed to live out his life and not suffer martyrdom isn't that strange that John went through a lot for the Lord Jesus but yet John did not have to go through what Paul did now just reading this little bit here of the Jews five times received our Stripes 40 Stripes save one Thrice beaten with rods because he stole money because he stole somebody's wife because he was a preacher so if we would take Paul and compare Peter to him which one suffered the most Paul did if we would take John where did John mention one1 of what Paul went through he never done it what about and and what about Mark what about Luke so whenever you look at it you realize that God will use some people to be able to display different attributes of himself now say this way that there'll be some men that God will use them and they'll have great uh faith I believe brother Daryl is one of them and God uses brother Daryl and use him all around the world to pray for people and Great Signs and miracles and wonders happen in in his ministry all over the world there's not a man that I know of alive today that I have any more confidence in their prayer than I do brother Daryl Ward yeah he's alive I'm going to give him some roses now why should I just do it whenever he's passed I just want to be honest that's the way I feel about it and and I feel that way not to flatter him but because it's a truth and there's other men no doubt that wish they had had that that brother Daryl has but I wonder if they would wish for what brother Daryl has been through that has helped cultivate and grow that that he has so with every gift that comes from God there is an element of Glory there is also an element of pain an element of reproach an element of shame I think one of the worst mistakes that we can make as Christians is all of us try to be be be and believe that we all have to be exactly the same that we're all just clones so God makes this one perfect Christian then every one of us do exactly the same thing as that one does you will not find that in the teachings of the Bible or the teachings of the message now let me go down through a little bit more of what Paul went through in verse 26 in journeyings often in Perils of waters in Perils of robbers in perils by my own countrymen in perils by the Heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness my Lord this man ain't leaving nothing undone is he everywhere he went in the city in the country in the streets and the back alleys on the ships good thing there wasn't no airplanes cuz if Paul had have been in it it' have crashed he'd have lived of course but he'd come out three broken arms and a net a tooth and look look at what happened to the man now all you know there's no way that that you and I believe that the devil could have done all of this to this man just on his own if Satan had the power to kill all of us we would have been here tonight including me but he can only do as God will allow him to do so now watch this in perils by the heathen perils in the city perils in the wilderness perils in the sea and perils among false Brethren and weariness and painfulness in watchings which meant he sat up all night watching couldn't sleep in watchings often in hunger I thought David said I've never seen the righteous forsaken or his seed begging bread you imagine the devil didn't work on this man and say hey you're supposed to be a prophet Now where's that Lord Jesus that appeared to you that great Pillar of Fire oh yeah you're still bearing the resemblance of that you know the prophet tells us that Paul what he went through that that thorn that kept coming back and leave and come back it was his eyes CU on the pillar fire appeared to him it damaged his eyes and his eyes he'd get all swollen up and pus would run out of his eyes and he had to write with big letters so he had to make big old letters in order to be able to write you mean God would hurt a man why would God do that this man was going to have more than all the rest of the men of the New Testament but he's still going to be left in this so God had to whoop him why because this had become exalted don't never desire great things from God don't never desire to be a great person a great preacher a great you have no idea what you're asking for just be what God's made you and God will predestinate your trials and your victories and your glory and they'll all correspond exactly together now can you imagine when we stand before the Lord now whenever brother ROM went beyond the curtain of time brother brandham never mentioned seeing Paul Peter Luther Wesley any of those the only ones that he saw were the ones that he knew which was in his church age so apparently in that Dimension which is the sixth Dimension it's divided categorically and he did not see Paul or any of Paul's people but whenever we all stand before the Lord we will stand with our church aged messenger and he will will present us there he will stand then the other preachers will stand there with him and he will present us to the Lord Jesus as the Bride of the Le of sin age Paul will stand with his and then the Lord Jesus we will come before him and we will never appear before the white Throne never the white throne but it will be the Throne of rewards so we will stand before the Lord and our record book book will be pulled out not the record of your mistakes not the record of your faults not the record of your shortcomings but the record of your works and what you went through for his sake oh can you imagine when Paul stands up there and this that I read you tonight will be quoted out to him again Paul I see you in perils often perils in the city perils in the country Perils of the Heathen perrows here in stripes in hunger and because of that my son I say a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee enter into the joys of your lord for you have been Faithful over a few things and I will make you ruler over many now will the Lord Jesus say the same thing about me no cuz I've not been in the Perils that Paul did would he say that about you more than likely not brother Joe no you sisters more than likely not I couldn't take all of that could you all could you take that I mean you think how could you take all of that and it not just work against you so bad and there's not a man in the New Testament that wrote about the mystery of God and the Plan of Redemption like Paul did and the blessings of god of what we were in Christ and whenever he talks about being free and he writes in the book of Philippians and it writes those tremendous things about being free in Christ Jesus and what God had done that man was setting in Rome in the maritine prison I I've stood there and looked down that hole where he was in in that prison rats running over his body them dropping his food down a hole and his water the stench must have been horrific How could a Christian do that and be able to put up with that and think yes Jesus you love me so much thank you for your grace you got to be kidding me you see this is why that God wants us every one of us to fit exactly in our calling because whenever our calling we're in obedience to that there'll be certain things you will Fe be able to go through and defeat as long as you're in your right place but if you get out of your calling into another position it's like demons know they're allocated to attack certain positions and do this and this Satan loves nothing better than to get a man or woman boy or girl out of their position over into a wrong position and they come into a rank of demons they are not qualified to handle do you understand one of the greatest positions in America that is vacated more frequent than any other it's not a president it's not a senator it's not a congress it's not police it's pastors the ter turnover for pastors is the highest in the job market why because men think well Mama want me to preach mama I I I went to Seminary I talked to a guy today businessman seven years in the semetary I I mean Seminary I I couldn't keep from feeling sorry for the guy I thought you know you wonder is the guy even called from from God to be able to do it and that's why many men they get in oh I I know I know I'm supposed to I just know I'm supposed to to and they get in there and it nearly drives them insane but if we get where we're supposed to be and then the Trials come our way God will never let the trials overwhelm us if we're Where We Belong so does a person then that has never had a great trial does that mean that're they're not a child of God absolutely not and it could be it just ain't happened yet it may happen but I want you to notice we'll go on here that brother Ron says look at Peter when he was walking by he was a moral born of sinful flesh just like I or you that's right but the people had need of a Healer so they sent God sent Peter to do that specific work what a profound statement the people needed a Healer and God sent Peter to do that work but I want you you notice now the difference between him and John I read this to you just a few weeks ago John was love Peter didn't have the love in his heart that John had but now you see where we fail as I said earlier is that we will pick somebody and we think I want to be like them and now that that's who I want to be like I I want to be like them I hear them pray and boy I I I want to be that way I was always kind of jealous of brother Daryl this is his night he's getting the Roses to hear him pray I mean he just you know just go on and on and on and pray and he's not acting he's not just trying to make up words and and having the men's prayer meetings and some of the brothers might pray for 15 20 minutes and they prayed for everybody they knew they pray for their dog their cat their cow their horse their mule they prayed for everything they knew to pray for and they just run out brother Daryl just kept right on going right on going well but look at the difference he gets texts all the time from people all over the world they'll text him 2 in the morning 3: in the morning 4: in the morning I've been with him I know wanting him to pray for this wanting him to pray for that so he has a prayer list that never ends and look how God has matched his ability to pray was the contact of the people that contact him to pray no doubt some of you have done exactly the same thing so whenever God caus us to do a certain thing then it's all fit together I wonder if Peter ever felt a little bit inferior to John because Peter was a fire brand he was a fiery guy great preacher but yet if you know notice reading in the book of Acts and the rest of the Epistles it's not noted that John did near the Miracles that Peter did even when they were at the gate beautiful and Peter and John were together yet the Bible says that Peter looked on the man and said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have well what about John how come John didn't Peter didn't say all right now I'll say the first part Silver and Gold Have I None and you say the other part John but notice what God done there were both of them great men of God but yet God CH Peter and if you'll read it you'll find out he' done more miracles than any of the rest of them did but yet Peter was not a man of Love the Way John was praise the Lord Peter didn't love have the love in his heart that that John had John was God's agency of love but I wonder which one today we would think would be the greatest person the man that would do the Miracles or one that would have love or one that God would allow to suffer in such a way that it would seem almost unbearable what if God chooses certain people to suffer and suffer physically psychologically maybe emotionally and God will bring an attribute of his own nature out of that person's life and they may wonder God why am I going through this I I don't understand let me just as your pastor open my heart to you tonight okay I believe myself the Lord God called my daughter Erica to suffer in an element that other people people had they went through what she went through they would have broke under it me and her mama saw we saw a lot of what she went through and no doubt she hid a lot from us but never one time did I hear her complain never one time did I hear her say God why how come don't you love me why would you do that why but that little girl's Life Touch preachers preachers around the world how could she have done that if God had not given her that special Grace but now for other people to try to do that they would fail miserably you understand what I'm saying so each of us our our walk with God our position how far we'll be elevated in God there's there's great preachers my goodness that preach circles around me and preachers that'll have experiences with God that I I'll never be allowed to have I know that I I've accepted that a long time ago but I know one thing I want my own and I want what God has for me I'll never be what some of the great men in the message are but really if God don't want me to be that way I don't want to either I want to be what God wants me to be anybody else feel that way tonight and I refuse to be jealous of anyone who would have more or bigger you know that's the way we think more and bigger and bigger Miracles and more miracles and more people and more and more and bigger and bigger I I I just never have thought that way and I don't think that way now what I want whatever it is that has my name on it that's what I want what God thought about me and what what attributes does he want me to express I honestly believe that there are preachers that are called like Paul to publicly bear the reproach for Christ and his word they will be more publicly ridiculed than others they will be even picked on by others it don't mean they're greater than others it just means that God wants to use them to Express an attribute of his being that say the miracle working Gody will never touch or say the person that God is using to express his faithfulness and his patience when it comes to en enduring sickness and things like that and there's so many attributes that he has so you young people will bring glory to God in a way I couldn't even dream of you go through things in your school and in your college and on your job you go through things I never face that I'll never have to deal with most of my dealings is with Christians I'll bump into Center people at Lowe's or Home Depot or something like that but I don't really deal with that many people the way you have to so God cannot really choose me to express that attribute the way he would some of you and yet you think I don't never do nothing for the Lord every day you live and work and walk as a Christian you've expressed an attribute of God's mercy and you're doing it in a way that I can't even touch and when you stand before the Lord that is written in the book of remembrance watch how brother bam deals with this he said look when he taken Peter James and John hope faith and charity don't you see those gifted people there the three hope faith faith and charity Hope was in James now James is a great man but you don't find the supernatural in James Ministry the way it was in Peter and James was not noted as one of a man of love not saying it didn't have love I don't think that I'm thinking tonight that well it'll only be certain people that'll have love no every member of the body of Christ will have love but there will be some that will excel in love you understand that and there'll be some that'll have signs and wonders and miracles and there'll be others that will excel in that and God chose them for that but that's only the glory side they will also have to pay a greater price than those who have less it just comes with the territory want you notice how he Compares this and things that ought to be I don't believe that when we get to heaven that we'll all be just everybody look exactly alike I don't believe that we'll all be blonde or brunettes or little or big or all Giants I believe that God is a god of variety the world proves that he's got big mountains little mountains he's got Plains he's got deserts he's got different things because he made it the way he wanted it he made the season summer winter spring autumn it shows he's a god of variety he made you in a variety now listen what's in the family of God some men are blusterous some are real dogmatic others are fine others are kind you just find all different kinds of people and in his kingdom praise God there's hope for us as sure as there's a world aren't you glad there's hope for the blusterous now there might be some blusterous people sitting here tonight and they really struggle being around the fine people some people are just so fine and so kind and so delicate and you blusterous people feel like I don't know what around them don't you and you think there ain't no hope for me oh yes there is There's Hope for all of us and the the people that are natured in that way all that those attributes they're expressing but there will also be attributes expressed in the blusterous person that those that are more Gentile will never be able to express God will be able to get a hold of that temperament and do something with that temperament and prove it's him that does it and it will actually bring glory to the kingdom of God you said boy that old boy my goodness that man had a temper Oh my he was wound up tired on an eight day clock on boy he would just buzz up in your face isn't it amazing what the Lord's done for him isn't it awesome what God's done for that sister remember she was this and this and this and look what God has done so God chose that person to be able to bring this attribute of himself into them and they hate it oh God I wish I wasn't that way I wish I was like so and so they're so nice but what if all of us was nice I imagine there's some here tonight that are I hope I me I'm thinking that surely there are somebody that are but what if all of us were just so gentle and just so kind none of us had any issues whatsoever boy wouldn't we look down our nose on them people that come to church here on Sunday morning that's got all the problems we'd say you all ought to come and fellowship with us and hang around us all of us goody goody two shoes but the truth of it it is all of us have issues don't we all of us got issues all of us got problems and all of us need God to help us don't we including the man preaching to you tonight and yet God will diversify Now watch how he Compares them look at St Peter and judge him by Andrew Andrew is that prayer Warrior just stayed on his knees all the time and the Apostle Peter was one of those fire brands that preached and so forth let me know how Peter was but I'm so glad Peter's mistakes was written in the Bible ain't you you know the only time A lot of times that people Peter opened his mouth was to change feet that was the only time he opened his mouth he put his foot in his mouth one time after another L his temper arrogant aren't you glad those things are written about such a man look at what God done with him but God shows a man with that makeup and be able to make such a man out of him but you never find Peter saying he went through what Paul went through but I wonder how the people in that day must have looked at Paul and said how come that dear brother go through so much stuff they'd have to say like brother Tracy it's just God honey that's all you can say it's just God but but how many other people that we would look at them and say look at that poor brother that poor sister they've been so sick and they've been through this and that and the other and they they just they encourage you and they just seem like they just always have a great attitude how in the world can they do that same God different attribute and using them now I don't mind telling you we may look down on people that are prayed for whether it's a physical thing or an emotional thing and it seem seem like that they just never get delivered and yet God will allow that thing to linger and linger brother R talks about a sister out in Arizona and whenever he went to preach he was there a couple different times and she was in a wheelchair now he said this sister he said look at her she's just like a rose among you she said he said and said she just smiled and she's got this great temperament about her so what he was doing was looking there and there was people during those meetings that was absolutely healed but yet there was something about this sister that was emanating Victory even though as far as I know she never did get healed but yet still had Faith to believe that God could do it but if God had a reason that he's using her to be able to bring it out you know Paul wrote about those in the Old Testament the book of Hebrews and he said they never obtained the promise they never got it but they believed God to the very last breath left their bodies so God told Abraham I'm going to give you this whole land every bit of it yours and your seed and yet when his wife died he didn't even have a spot big enough in the ground to bury her but according to God he owned it all and he had to go buy a burial place isn't it amazing they believed and they trusted and people say oh my goodness they didn't have faith they did have faith they did have faith and they believed and it's the same way with our battles can to have a few more minutes before we close notice brother BR in the Masterpiece now the patriarch Foundation First Abraham then Isaac Jacob Joseph the Four Corners Abraham was the foundation of Faith let's say it had four foundations the foundation of Faith the foundation of love was Isaac the foundation of Grace was Jacob God's grace to Jacob anyone knows that but in Joseph was Perfection I I'm sure that you've noticed it before Abraham the great patriarchal father God did great things through the man his son Isaac not so much anybody tell me any great Miracles Isaac ever did tell me what great things that Isaac ever accomplished he was the son of a great man and the father of a great man but he wasn't so much a great man he was just a mediocre man in between two great people but how's Jacob going to get here without an Isaac now I wonder how many Isaacs that there's going to be in heaven but we focus on the Abrahams and the Jacobs so here was Abraham the great patriarchal foundation and then you've got an Isaac and what do we know about Isaac well he was a type of Christ and that Rebecca was was his bride and he was a type of Christ we know he lied we know that he denied his wife what other great things did the man do what battles did he win you ever take any of his servants like Abraham did 318 Warriors and go up against the the kings of of the veil of Sodom and gomorra against the Slime pits no what what great things did he do well he dug a well or two he followed the message believe what God Said the son of a great man and the father of a great man raised and influenced greatly by his mother a man then that was given the trait by the prophet as a man of love but as far as great faith did he have the great faith Abraham had no he didn't but was he necessary absolutely essential in the foundations of the Masterpiece now this is a sermon brother Bram is preaching so God laid the patriarchal Foundation of Abraham Faith second patriarchal Foundation Isaac in love the third patriarchal Foundation Jacob God's grace to Jacob but Joseph was Perfection totally different than Abraham totally different than Isaac totally different than his father all of them were needed you know how many of you all are needed every one of you men women boys girls black white red yellow Rich poor in the middle somewhere every one of you are needed and important to God and important to our church and to our church family now you may be a foundation of faith God may use you as a foundation of love God may use you as a foundation of Grace but wherever God uses you just keep in mind with that will come an element of Glory with that will come trials Isaac never had the trials that his father nor his son had isn't it amazing the brothers Joseph's brothers they were chosen of God put all 11 of them together they never had the trials that Joseph had but what if they went and tried to make them themselves well you know what I love God too I I want to be chosen by God and they were but they were chosen for different positions so whoever asked this question because you've never had a great trial does it mean you haven't had the Holy Ghost no it does not mean that at all and some people will go through life and they may never have a great tremendous thing and they'll look at others and think my they went through this I feel so sorry for them and they went through that and I I I'm I must not be worth very much I must not be no maybe that's exactly where God placed you you're in between two slabs of foundations of great trials and test the church went through those stages in the book of Acts they would be persecuted from the outside and then the Bible said the churches had rest when an emperor change would come from the Roman Empire there was always a political change and a political head of course but after Christianity became what they considered a threat to Rome it would it would depend upon the emperor now dioclesian was one of the worst that ever was Nero some of them but then there was others and they were kind of partial to Christianity I'm talking about prec Constantine era they were a little bit partial to Christianity and God would actually use that political head and it would bring a little bit of rest into the churches so if you follow that that same symbol in the church ases you'll see some of the church ases went down into such heavy heavy dark persecution and then others it's like they come out on the other side and they had hundreds of years and it just seemed like they floated right along it was not a great difficult thing to serve God it wasn't like your your life was on the line and then that generation go out and another generation look at us in the last days the most difficult age that's ever been on the Earth but some of our grandmothers and grandfathers they also had their trials but each one of us if we'll find our spot we will be tempered according to the amount of test that we can endure aren't you grateful for that 2 Corinthians chap 1:5 for as the sufferings of Christ abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ I find this so amazing that Paul actually identifies some of what Christians go through are actually the sufferings of Jesus himself not for him but they're actually his sufferings whether we be afflicted it's for your consolation now watch here is showing them that part of what he's going through is for them and salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer whether we be comforted it is for your consolation and salvation second Corinthians 1:7 Our Hope of you is steadfast knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings so shall you also be of the consolation for we not but not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia that we were pressed out of measure above strengths in so much that we even despaired of Life Paul reached the spot that he thought I'll not make it I will not come through this one it's so bad I'll never make it maybe some of you have been in there maybe some of you will never have to go through that but it don't mean that you're not a Christian it does not mean that you don't love God with all of your heart but God will allow each of us to be tested to the spot that he can bring us to I think whenever I stand and preach and Lord willing in July I'll be 68 years old I've been preaching since I was 18 so that's as you guessed it 50 years 20 minutes of inspirational preaching is like eight hours of work so if I preach about an hour then I've I've worked equivalent to 24 hours so I've done that for decades and yet it takes a lot out of me but I think of my dear friend brother Ron Spencer taking about 30 pills a day and he text brother Tim and I yesterday and he went to have scans and doctor's appointments and vomiting sick text me month and a half two months ago going to church Sunday morning to preach vomited eight times before he got there to get up and preach and give everything that he had brother Daryl called me five 6 months ago in a motel laying flat on his back in the floor in a motel with his feet and legs up on the bed was the only place that he could find any relief because his back was killing him and I think I don't guess I really went through much but yet I know I've went through things that neither Brother Daryl old brother Ron has went through and both of them have told me brother Donnie I don't see how you do it I don't see how you do it I don't see how you put up with it it drive me crazy so each one of us are called in different ways and what would it all be when it's all said and done and we will all stand before him at that day and there will be people that have said about you and you and you and you I don't see how you did it I understand when you got saved your whole family forsook you I understand that when you come to the message of the hour your family just I could never do that I don't know how you did that how did you do that you see that will be the commonality among all of us that question will be asked in German and Africans it will be asked in French in Spanish in English it will be asked in many languages around the world how did you do it and the answer will be the same for all of us he helped me he helped me praise God one day when we stand before the Lord and we look at Paul and when we get to fellowship with him say brother Paul how did you do that I read that so many times about you and every time I did it it just pricked my heart and tore me all to pieces for you brother how did you deal with that God help me whenever we asked brother Brandon brother BR how did you go through all that you did the world hated you they despised you how did you do it the answer will be the same he helped me you'll be asked the same thing how did you live in that last day oh I heard it was horrible I heard it was the worst age for any human being to ever live how did you ever do it let me tell tell you what you all are going to say his grace his grace helped us that's how we overcome this is one thing I love about him he calls us for a certain work he empowers us enables us helps us to do it then we stand before him and rewards us for what he helped us do and sometimes people say well it ain't fair I agree it ain't Fair it ain't fair for him he helps me do what I do and then I'm going to stand before him that day and he's going to reward me are you kidding me what do I deserve what do you deserve if I got what I deserved it would not be Heaven it would not be his Mercy Hallelujah let's bow our heads together we'll stop here for tonight thank you for these questions Lord I've been so blessed as I've studied Him Father I thank you for the use of our church I love each one of them I thank you for the desire desire to live for you and to serve you I pray you'd keep them Jesus help them give them strength father May each one of them find that spot in their life of what you've called them to be then Lord when the trials and the tests come they will have what it will take to match the trial and we know that it would be Unbecoming to your nature to call us for a work and then that work destroy us it makes no sense it's not the work that destroys us either we take too much on ourself or we get out of our calling and we get in over our heads and we can't get out so Lord I pray that you'd help each of us I Know Myself father when I've got so weary and I felt like I couldn't couldn't put one foot in front of the other and I went to look around and just kind of survey everything I begin to realize it was not you it was me I got I got too busy I I took more on me than what I should have it was never you I pray you'd help each of us father we know when your Prophet first started out and he tells us about being out there Arkansas in the prayer line 8 days and eight nights he ate his meals on the platform they had a caught on the platform and he would take a break and sleep a little bit on the platform and then get up and pray for people and when he got done there was more people to be prayed for than what he had prayed for in all them days and yet after those meetings he runs off off the road into a field has a nervous breakdown nearly loses his mind and he said does God do that to a man and then he answers his question no man does that to himself so he had a great desire to help so many people help us father as we try to do what you've called us to do to be balanced and all you've not given to any any of us to save the world we know father you're the Savior so help us to work within our limits and to realize that even you told your disciples they must come apart and rest a while and as a preacher told me years ago either you come apart and rest a while or you come apart so help each of us fathers mothers Housewives young married couple singles whatever we are Lord that we can find what you've called us to be and be faithful therein Lord May each of us Lord Jesus do as the scripture tells us casting your cares upon Him for he cares for you Lord would you minister to every heart here tonight and those that have streamed the surface heal the sick encourage those that might be discouraged we love love you father thank you for our little gathering time tonight blessed I pray in Jesus name Amen brother Jill brother Rob whichever of you just to share one just share one thought that I was thinking of um I want you to recognize I want you to recognize what's happening for us when I was your age and I know old people always say when I was your age right there was no opportunity for me to ask a question to anyone about anything there even if I had asked questions to someone to ask what about this what about God's nature what about that there was not inspiration for anyone to give me an answer so recognize what God does for us and how he loves us and a capacity to ask a question and have someone with brother Donnie for 50 years that been studying and learning of God and Anointed God to be able to gift as a gift to me as a gift to you or to the body to expound on things to give us answers to to life when I started reading the message what was so profound to me at my age in my 30s with the is that there were answers to life a man had wondered about certain things of why am I here what am I here for what am I to do what's it all about there must be more there were answers in the capacity of things that I was reading that were coming to and popping to me to recognize this is what it's about and this is what the world so starves for so what so I don't want you to miss or Miss at your age for the the ability that you have to have questions and have answers there I was in my goodness I was raised in Catholic Church I was went to Lutheran Church there was all kinds of different years until I was 30 years old there was no there were no questions there were no answers but right now you have grown up knowing that either brother brandom had question and answer Services your parents had question and answer services for with brother Donnie when he first came to the church to you it is normal but it's God's grace to you to not to recognize the the blessing that it is and thank God for it that's what I want you to know from me sitting in this row and and enjoying these things right and the world knows nothing of he that have ears to hear Let Him hear okay so thank God thank God thank you brother certainly appreciated that tonight let's just think about what we've heard and just keep it in our hearts in Christ alone will I Glory though I could pride myself in battles War for I've been blessed beyond measure and by his strength alone I'll overcome oh I could stop and count successes like diamonds in my [Music] hand but those trophies could not equal to the Grace by which I stand in Christ to long I place my trust and find my glory in the power of the Cross and every Victory let it be said of me me my source of strength my source of Hope is Christ [Music] Alone In Christ Alone will I glory for only by his grace I am redeemed and no only his Tender Mercies could reach beyond my weakness to my need and now I seek no greater on Earth than just to know him more and count my gains but losses to
