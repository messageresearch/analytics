[0:04] forces to investigate
[0:05] social networking researchers discovered
[0:08] that discover that one in three people
[0:10] surveyed felt worse lonely frustrated or
[0:13] angry
[0:14] after spending time
[0:19] smoking drinking committing adultery
[0:22] sitting at the bar
[0:25] on facebook
[0:28] here we go you all told me to go on
[0:37] often due to perceived inadequacies
[0:40] when comparing themselves to friends
[0:44] research also shows that facebook can
[0:47] cause depression
[0:49] lord have mercy children i've got enough
[0:51] in this world to cause it why would i
[0:52] want to add more to it
[0:58] a recently published american academy
[1:00] pediatrics paper
[1:02] made a major splash that's what i'm
[1:04] fixing to make this morning
[1:06] a major splash when it described
[1:08] facebook
[1:10] depression a condition
[1:14] said to result when tweens and teens
[1:17] spend too much time on social media
[1:19] leading them to turn to
[1:21] substance abuse unsafe sexual practices
[1:25] and aggressive or self-destructive
[1:28] behaviors
[1:29] by spending too much time on facebook
[1:34] this blessed holy righteous holy grail
[1:38] of facebook
[1:41] [Music]

[2:13] into that
[2:14] serious mode of thinking don't you think
[2:16] i don't know you're guilty as a hound
[2:17] dog in a hen house
[2:21] just go ahead and admit the truth even
[2:23] if you're guilty
[2:27] notice that the more time adolescent
[2:29] girls spent on the social networking
[2:31] side the more likely they were
[2:33] to develop eating disorders such as
[2:35] anorexia
[2:36] bulimia extreme dieting israeli
[2:39] researchers recently found
[2:42] by being on facebook why because the
[2:45] mind
[2:47] they look at the pictures of these girls
[2:49] and this and that and the other said
[2:50] well i'm fatter than her
[2:52] i'm more chubby than her i don't look
[2:54] like that i'm this and that in the other

[2:59] you are a human being
[3:03] our bodies are not yet glorified our
[3:05] bodies are affected by such stuff
[3:08] [Applause]
[3:09] [Music]
[3:14] [Applause]
[3:17] why is it friends that we have such a
[3:18] stigma in our society
[3:21] about people that can have mental
[3:22] illness
[3:25] people going to have colon problems
[3:26] people going to have stomach problems
[3:28] they can have all kinds of other
[3:29] problems
[3:30] most people ain't gonna make fun of them
[3:33] but if anybody has a mental sort of a
[3:35] situation we ridicule them we make fun
[3:37] of them we laugh at them
[3:38] and many times people are suffering i'm
[3:40] not saying that they're insane now
[3:41] they just have some sort of mental
[3:43] oppression or something mental going on
[3:45] they hide it from their mother they hide
[3:46] it from the church they hide it from
[3:48] their very best friends why
[3:50] because people have such a stigma about
[3:52] it and we tend to laugh on them shame
[3:54] on us i said shame on us
[4:04] dear jesus
[4:07] tomorrow when y'all get off from work
[4:09] i'll be standing on the side of the
[4:10] interstate out there we'll preach for
[4:11] food and carol be kicked out of our
[4:14] houses
[4:16] oh my notice this exposure to online
[4:20] fashion and music content
[4:22] as well as watching tv shows like gossip
[4:25] girl
[4:26] were also associated with an increased
[4:28] risk for eating disorders
[4:31] facebook was referenced in 20 of divorce
[4:35] specif uh petitions processed in 29.
[4:38] now can you imagine how far along it is
[4:40] beyond this time of this statistic
[4:43] 20 of divorce petitions processed in
[4:46] 2009 by divorce online a british law
[4:49] firm
[4:50] time magazine reported that feuding
[4:52] spouses use their facebook pages
[4:54] to air dirty laundry let me just say
[4:57] it ain't people in divorce that do that
[5:00] it's church people
[5:01] church people getting on facebook and
[5:04] airing church problems
[5:05] family what in the world is wrong with
[5:08] people
[5:12] [Applause]
[5:17] i perceive all you a mentors don't have
[5:22] facebook
[5:24] and all you bug-eyed ones do
[5:30] you're trying to give me that fake smile
[5:32] come on i can see right through you
[5:39] you tell me not to have it no i'm not
[5:41] telling you not to have it
[5:42] but i'm telling you these are the risks
[5:45] that can be with
[5:46] it can it be used it can be
[5:51] just like the internet there's hardly
[5:53] anything in this generation
[5:54] that is a more damnable tool than the
[5:57] internet
[5:58] but it depends upon those of you who use
[6:00] it
[6:01] you and your smartphone it's a shame
[6:03] that sometimes a smartphone's smarter
[6:05] than the person who
[6:06] packs it amen but you can use a
[6:09] smartphone in an internet to contact me
[6:11] but do all kinds of things
[6:12] but who's going to be the one to control
[6:14] it that king sitting inside the throne
[6:16] of your heart
[6:17] he'll keep you off them bad websites
[6:20] he'll keep you off things you shouldn't
[6:22] be there
[6:22] why because we are living in the age of
[6:25] the mind
[6:26] but it's not just the mind of laodicea
[6:29] it is the mind of christ
[6:32] jesus
[6:42] notice this time magazine reported that
[6:45] feuding spouses use their facebook pages
[6:48] to air dirty laundry
[6:49] while their lawyers use posts as
[6:51] evidence in divorce proceedings
[6:59] oh but it's all fun and games facebook
[7:01] is wake up this morning
[7:06] sexual health expert ian kerner phd
[7:09] recently blogged on cnn
[7:11] that he's seen many relationships
[7:13] destroyed
[7:14] by facebook bombs
[7:19] so i figure the best way to avoid a
[7:21] facebook bomb
[7:23] is give you a word bomb
[7:30] people reconnecting with high school
[7:33] sweethearts
[7:35] or other blasts from the past
[7:39] [Laughter]
[7:42] that can lead to emotional if not actual
[7:46] cheating
[7:48] well you say i'm not doing anything if
[7:50] you're not careful you will develop an
[7:52] emotional relationship
[7:54] with somebody by texting or phone
[7:56] calling
[7:57] or facebook don't you sat down look at
[7:59] me big-eyed
[8:00] it is satisfying you it is gratifying
[8:03] you emotionally
[8:04] you are getting something out of it lord
[8:07] children you better run from it
[8:10] don't let the world shape our mind oh
[8:13] hallelujah
[8:14] let's be ready to leave this world and
[8:16] all this layer to sea of garbage
[8:28] sweet jesus
[8:33] recent research has shown that using
[8:36] social networking sites
[8:38] namely facebook
[8:41] can increase people's stress levels
[8:48] oh my produce anxiety
[8:52] and negativity affect a person's sense
[8:55] of self
[8:58] i already have enough of that to deal
[8:59] with
[9:01] [Applause]
[9:04] look at it friend it's a snare that's a
[9:07] tribe for those
[9:08] who are addicted to this they are
[9:11] looking for comfort they're looking for
[9:13] something
[9:13] and satan is saying come on come on and
[9:16] he pulls them right into it
[9:18] and the very place they're looking for
[9:19] help and soulless is the very thing
[9:21] that's going to destroy them
[9:23] there's one place you can find the hell
[9:26] and the comfort and the peace that you
[9:28] need in this age that's jesus christ
[9:40] using these sites might even cause a
[9:43] person to develop a mental health
[9:48] disorder
[9:51] really is this all worth it whoa
[9:57] some of y'all can't stand but church
[9:59] church one time a week because you get
[10:00] beat to death
[10:01] and you do this trash right here you do
[10:04] this
[10:04] nonsense you do this nonsense every day
[10:07] of your life
[10:08] these are not preachers saying this this
[10:10] ain't deacons this is phd
[10:12] and psychologists all these people
[10:14] telling you the negative effect
[10:15] and you will deal with the positive
[10:18] negative things in it
[10:19] in order to gratify something and stay
[10:21] away from the house of god
[10:22] when you can be corrected by the word
[10:33] social media media even has the power to
[10:36] quickly spread moods
[10:39] around the world
[10:46] well glory and so does the internet
[10:51] but in a positive way this same mood
[10:53] right here at happy valley has been
[10:54] spread around the world too right now
[11:00] of course it's spreading two different
[11:02] kinds of moods some of y'all's making
[11:03] you in a good mood some in a bad mood
[11:05] and some of you ain't decided what mood
[11:06] you're into
[11:07] someone i could spread three kinds of
[11:09] moods around the world this morning
[11:12] oh my researchers found that when the
[11:15] participants
[11:16] increased their facebook use their state
[11:20] of well-being
[11:32] and yet you're scared to death if you
[11:35] pick up a bottle and read on the side
[11:37] may cause cancer
[11:43] your brother stop to get gas and you
[11:45] reach and grab a hold of the handle
[11:47] and flip up the pump and select 87 or
[11:49] whichever one you're getting
[11:50] and you read that little warning sign
[11:52] may cause cancer you stand up
[12:07] we're scared to death of cancer and
[12:09] putting stuff in us every day
[12:12] that's million times worse
[12:13] [Applause]
[12:21] well i guess i'll be the subject of
[12:22] saving them on facebook won't i
[12:26] [Applause]
[12:32] well glory can you imagine
[12:35] researchers found that when the
[12:37] participants increased their facebook
[12:39] use
[12:40] their state of well-being declined
[12:45] while those who increased the amount of
[12:46] time they spent with people
[12:48] face to face had an increase sense
[12:52] of well-being
[12:57] oh my praise be to god
[13:01] notice now the next part of this it's
[13:04] addictive like anything that can
[13:08] distract us from stress anxiety and
[13:10] emotional pain
[13:11] facebook can be hard to stop using
[13:15] even as ironically it can be then cause
[13:18] more stress can't you see
[13:23] can't you say who's the father of this
[13:25] can't you see who's the founder of all
[13:27] this
[13:28] [Applause]
[13:30] pulls people in to get them off of the
[13:32] worries and the baby bottles and the
[13:34] baby diapers and doing this and
[13:35] they go on facebook you know just hang
[13:37] out a little bit and be able to get from

[15:35] on the site coming to a stage
[15:37] where they need it in order to obtain

[15:48] detrimental effect on them as
