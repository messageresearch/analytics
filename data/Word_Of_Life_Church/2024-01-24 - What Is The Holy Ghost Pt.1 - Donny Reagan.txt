[32:07] nothing nothing so apparently you've
[32:10] never got over the hill yet have
[32:14] you we're talking about the hill of
[32:16] Calvary of course than once people
[32:19] really come in contact with that reality
[32:22] it changes our life doesn't
[32:24] it I'm so happy that I'm I was able as a
[32:28] boy to be able to see that reality years
[32:30] ago and I don't mind telling you I love
[32:32] him tonight more than I've ever loved
[32:35] him greet you tonight sure missed you
[32:38] all good to see you appreciate the
[32:40] goodness of the Lord to us let's turn to
[32:43] U First Peter chapter 1
[32:47] tonight Lord
[32:48] willing I guess we're still having the
[32:50] we're having the question answers
[32:52] tomorrow night for the Youth at 6:30
[32:54] we'll be having it in
[32:56] here and
[32:58] um the youth asked me if if um if we
[33:01] would do this
[33:03] so um some of the questions I've had for
[33:07] a month or so some at least three weeks
[33:12] and I've been studying on them for for a
[33:14] bit so last Wednesday night I was going
[33:19] to preach what I'm going to preach
[33:21] tonight and then we was going to do
[33:23] question answers on Thursday night but
[33:26] we got snowed out of course and couldn't
[33:28] do it but what I want to speak to you
[33:31] tonight on is what is the Holy
[33:35] Ghost I'm sure every one of you would
[33:38] surely be able to give me an answer what
[33:41] you think it is no doubt not just a
[33:45] little bit but on the latest Foundation
[33:48] tonight we're because the first question
[33:52] that I want to answer tomorrow night is
[33:55] how can I know
[33:57] G so the Lord just put it on my heart
[34:00] that if we want to be able to know we've
[34:04] got it might need a
[34:06] refresher what it
[34:08] is so we can know what it is got know uh
[34:14] what it is in your life and before we
[34:16] start let me just say it this way the
[34:18] Holy Ghost is not
[34:20] jumping the Holy Ghost is not sh the
[34:23] Holy Ghost is not in
[34:25] motion right
[34:27] the Holy Ghost is not speaking in
[34:29] tongues but the Holy Ghost does
[34:33] all so what is the Holy Ghost it's the
[34:37] spirit of God in us so to say that the
[34:39] Holy Ghost is shouting and say that God
[34:42] is a shout or God is a tongue or God is
[34:47] a feeling or God is an emotion but we
[34:50] know that God is a spirit and the Holy
[34:54] Ghost is the attribute of God could be
[34:58] divided
[35:00] divided so the spirit of Christ which
[35:05] refers to what the Old Testament
[35:07] prophets had if you notice we read here
[35:10] in First Peter tonight that it does not
[35:13] say
[35:15] Jesus because Jesus the human body of
[35:18] God never existed in the
[35:21] old so it's not Jesus that Elijah had on
[35:27] Jesus that Moses had in him but it was
[35:30] the spirit of what Christ CH anointed
[35:35] one First Peter 1 verse 10 so the
[35:39] question answers are for alls and we'll
[35:42] be streaming it for those of you that
[35:45] like to stream as well and I believe
[35:48] you'll be
[35:50] blessed amen so if you
[35:53] can listen this careful
[35:55] now 1 Peter 1: 10 of which
[36:00] salvation the prophets have
[36:04] inquired and
[36:06] search
[36:08] diligently who prophesied of the grace
[36:11] that should come unto you searching what
[36:17] or what manner of
[36:20] time the spirit of Christ which was in
[36:24] them did signify Peter says he doesn't
[36:28] say Jesus the humanity of God was in
[36:32] them but the spirit of
[36:35] Christ and it was actually in the
[36:38] prophets that come in them like it did
[36:40] Ezekiel but it did not seal their soul
[36:43] so that's what Peter called the spirit
[36:45] of Christ when it testified beforehand
[36:48] of the sufferings of Christ and the
[36:49] glory that should follow so the
[36:52] sufferings and then the glory that
[36:55] should follow of course that order and
[36:57] the glory is going to be the glory of
[36:59] the Resurrection but not only that but
[37:02] the glory of the church but it testified
[37:05] before him the sufferings of Christ and
[37:07] the glory that should follow unto whom
[37:09] it was revealed that not unto themselves
[37:14] but unto us they did Minister the things
[37:18] which are now reported unto you by them
[37:23] that have preached the gospel unto you
[37:27] wow so that first church they Le in
[37:31] vir that's the way God started his
[37:33] church that's way in his
[37:36] church so it was reported unto you by
[37:39] them which have preached the gospel unto
[37:41] you now listen this carefully with the
[37:44] Holy Ghost sent down from
[37:48] heaven which
[37:50] things the
[37:52] Angels
[37:53] desire to look into
[37:59] okay which things the Angels desire to
[38:03] look into now look at the screen there
[38:05] at what the word look
[38:08] means to
[38:10] stoop to a
[38:14] same in order to look at
[38:18] it if you can imagine in your mind ton
[38:20] that every one of you that have the Holy
[38:22] Ghost in your
[38:24] soul it is so overwhelm in and so great
[38:28] to the angels of
[38:30] God that they actually
[38:36] sto and they're
[38:40] looking we should never take
[38:45] Grant look at that meaning to look at
[38:49] with the head bowed
[38:52] forward to look into with the body bent
[38:58] so they don't just stand up real proud
[39:00] and sophisticated but they actually are
[39:04] looking they're trying to understand
[39:07] what in the world how God love them
[39:10] people we're with you all
[39:20] that
[39:22] Amen to suit and to look
[39:25] into metaphorically to look carefully
[39:28] into to
[39:31] inspect
[39:32] curiously yeah so it's like you're
[39:35] looking at something you just you got
[39:38] that look on your face in bewilderment
[39:40] you think
[39:42] wow body
[39:44] armorock orange
[39:47] Clementine
[39:50] wow I wonder what this going tast
[39:54] like and the angels are looking at God
[39:57] deals with us
[39:59] DAV think how can
[40:03] he how could he forgive them how can he
[40:06] put up with and what they have he in
[40:12] them I hope you understand that God uses
[40:16] the
[40:17] church as a
[40:20] school to teach his
[40:25] angels
[40:27] W to look carefully into to expect
[40:30] curiously one of who would become
[40:35] acquainted with something so they're so
[40:38] curious that they like to become
[40:40] acquainted with with that was the
[40:44] Angel's desire to look into so here it
[40:47] portrays the stretching of the neck and
[40:50] the bending of the body to be able to
[40:52] gaze upon some wonderful s
[40:58] that are
[40:59] struck with all yeah as you have the
[41:03] Holy
[41:04] Ghost on thank you
[41:08] Lord thank you
[41:11] Lord
[41:14] father that just about leaves us
[41:18] speechless to think that what you have
[41:21] done in human beings is so
[41:25] great I'm so
[41:27] curious that the angels of
[41:30] God study it in such a curious manner to
[41:35] try to relate to
[41:37] it father I pray you would help us
[41:40] toight would you open our
[41:45] understanding may we be able to leave
[41:48] this
[41:55] place
[42:22] [Music]
[43:42] over and becomes a demon there is no
[43:46] Redemption for the
[43:48] demon
[43:50] ad then demons could live inside of us
[43:53] when we were
[43:55] lost and we can be
[43:58] redeemed but that spirit that was
[44:00] inhabiting our could not
[44:04] be so they look at it in such a curious
[44:07] Manner and try to understand so the
[44:10] Redemption of the Saints and then also
[44:14] this infinite
[44:16] being holds such Marvel to them of his
[44:20] work not only Redemption for us but his
[44:23] work of
[44:25] incarnation that he would come to the
[44:27] Earth and become one of us and so much
[44:30] that he would bleed and die in pain and
[44:34] sorrow and Agony and scream from the
[44:37] cross my God my God why is s
[44:41] foren and they still are looking in this
[44:45] curious manner to understand every
[44:48] generation is different every age of
[44:50] what they go through I wonder how
[44:53] curious they must be tonight of us in
[44:57] this age the darkest most terrible age a
[45:03] person could live and they look with
[45:06] bewilderment at us as God deals with us
[45:09] in Mercy and Grace saves us sanctifies
[45:12] us fills us with the Holy Ghost and then
[45:14] they see us still as humans and we make
[45:17] mistakes and fall short of the glory of
[45:19] God and they see the plan of
[45:21] reconciliation that they say father
[45:22] please forgive me I'm so sorry and they
[45:25] see the mercy of God as it eliminates
[45:28] that sin never to be remembered against
[45:30] us again and they're looking at and
[45:32] thinking how
[45:35] that how can you do
[45:38] that and he don't even remember
[45:41] it how could it be that he that he just
[45:44] totally obliterates that sin and it'll
[45:48] never be remembered
[45:50] against
[45:52] again and they're looking with their
[45:54] bodies bent and their neck
[45:58] stretched and they're trying to
[46:02] comprehend you think the great work of
[46:05] what God has done is it any Wonder Satan
[46:10] hates the True Church of the Living
[46:13] God w't you notice in Ephesians 3:9 that
[46:18] Paul says and to make men all all men
[46:20] see what is the Fellowship of the
[46:24] mystery which from the beginning of the
[46:26] world has been hid in God who created
[46:30] All Things by Jesus Christ notice the
[46:34] order now Jesus Humanity Christ anointed
[46:37] so anointed Humanity now Paul is
[46:39] bringing it from the stage of the
[46:41] invisible logos to show us that that
[46:44] invisible logos became a man and was
[46:48] crowned with Glory the anointing to the
[46:52] intent that now to the principalities
[46:55] and Power
[46:56] ERS in Heavenly places might be known by
[47:01] the
[47:02] church the manifold wisdom of
[47:06] God so again
[47:09] principalities is the beginning of the
[47:12] creation of angelic beings Aro so it's
[47:17] the first one in
[47:19] order so Paul broke into it in a little
[47:22] different way than God allowed Peter to
[47:25] and he says to the intent so the purpose
[47:29] is that the
[47:31] principalities and powers and Heavenly
[47:35] places might be known by the church the
[47:40] manifold wisdom of God and manifold is
[47:43] the word variegated yall know what a
[47:46] variegated plant is so a variegated
[47:49] plant will have green and light green
[47:52] and I have green and white it's actually
[47:56] and there'll be couple of three
[47:58] different colors sometimes in there and
[48:00] you never know exactly how each Leaf
[48:03] will be so Paul says this is what God
[48:06] did God chose to manifest his manifold
[48:10] wisdom not in angels not in
[48:13] charans but by the
[48:16] church the church the Ecclesia of God
[48:19] the called out of God people who leave
[48:22] their homes and gather in a public place
[48:25] and by their own walk and they're the
[48:27] variegated body of God some were drunk
[48:30] some were alive some were this and that
[48:33] and God brings them all together by the
[48:35] variegated manifold wisdom of God and
[48:38] the angels are still trying to figure it
[48:41] out how can this be how can he love them
[48:46] right now he says that it not be made
[48:49] known by the church the manifold wisdom
[48:54] of God the angels are not participants
[48:57] in
[48:58] Salvation the Angels do not have the
[49:03] baptism of the Holy
[49:05] Ghost the Angels do not experience deity
[49:10] in the way
[49:12] you now in a simplified form the baptism
[49:16] of the Holy Ghost on your
[49:19] soul is your portion of deity yes sir
[49:25] from the God
[49:28] Amen it is your portion of deity that
[49:33] once you get in here it will be yours
[49:38] forever you will never that's right it
[49:41] is always
[49:43] yours now remember this is what the Holy
[49:47] Ghost is it is the part of God I know
[49:50] it's difficult for us even looking at
[49:52] the Father and Son relationship because
[49:55] we judge it by human terms and human
[49:58] perception so you would look and say
[50:00] well father and son so here's Brother D
[50:03] Swanson he is a father and then we look
[50:06] at his sons and say well them sons and
[50:08] they they look a little bit different
[50:10] than day and our makeup is a little bit
[50:13] different than the day and that's the
[50:15] way we judge God him but remember Jesus
[50:18] said God is a spirit God is not a man
[50:24] God is Not Not a Human Being right God
[50:28] is a spirit and God never had a
[50:31] permanent human body unto Jesus his word
[50:36] his son come on the earth then from this
[50:40] part of the earth I will redeem the rest
[50:43] of it will this part now this was God's
[50:46] Humanity he was both human and God is
[50:50] that right so the truth then of God was
[50:53] made manifest in the human body the Lord
[50:57] Jesus so now the manifold wisdom of God
[51:00] will be made manifest not just in Jesus
[51:04] but actually in the church so the Holy
[51:08] Angels are taught by the
[51:13] instrumentality of the church how in the
[51:15] world could a bunch of
[51:19] weaklings a bunch of former
[51:22] Sinners former Liars
[51:26] drug addicts everything of the world you
[51:28] can
[51:29] imagine and God would use them to teach
[51:33] Angels you imagine God speaking to them
[51:37] and say you want to know more about me
[51:40] watch me in my
[51:44] church you want to understand me greater
[51:48] you archangels you cherubims you
[51:51] seraphim you
[51:53] zoom Watch How I deal with my
[51:58] bride
[52:01] Hallelujah so they catch a view of God's
[52:06] Supreme love in a way that they didn't
[52:10] see it in the
[52:12] universe so the prophet tells us to his
[52:14] opinion the first thing that God made
[52:17] was Angels then he become into the
[52:20] position or the object of worship which
[52:23] is God before that he was the Eternal
[52:26] the Eternal so there was no one to
[52:27] worship him so it wasn't God because God
[52:30] is the object of worship so there had to
[52:33] be something to worship him so he
[52:35] created angels and actually the Angels
[52:37] the Fallen Angels actually fell before
[52:40] the foundation of the world was ever Le
[52:44] so they were there when he started
[52:47] creating this aspect of the universe and
[52:50] they never saw with the trillions of
[52:53] Angels the billions of stars and they
[52:57] never saw the great display of his
[52:59] wisdom in the way that they see it and
[53:03] you and
[53:06] I so here the church then becomes God's
[53:10] school for Angelic beings notice in
[53:14] Hebrews chap 1:14 are they not all
[53:18] ministering Spirits talking about the
[53:20] angels of God are they not all
[53:22] ministering Spirits sent forth forth to
[53:26] minister for them who shall be Heirs of
[53:31] Salvation so their Ministry is for The
[53:36] Heirs on the earth that's going to
[53:39] receive salvation so this within itself
[53:42] makes them more Curious to be able to
[53:45] look into it I wonder how many times
[53:47] them angels have been around us I wonder
[53:50] how many accidents that the angels of
[53:53] God have stopped you from having when
[53:56] Satan laid a a snare or trap or whatever
[53:58] and an angel of God stood between you
[54:01] and that truck or that car or maybe you
[54:04] got out and you was fixing a head
[54:06] somewhere and and you forgot something
[54:08] back at the house and you had to go back
[54:09] and get it and if you would have been 5
[54:12] minutes earlier you've been right in the
[54:13] middle of a terrible terrible
[54:16] accident God has appointed the angels to
[54:20] watch over you not only to watch but to
[54:24] minister wonder what they're
[54:27] ministering so they minister to those
[54:31] that are Heirs of Salvation so they
[54:34] comprehend they're trying to look
[54:38] imagine these angels they some of the
[54:40] same ones that were assigned to Noah
[54:43] they were the same ones that was
[54:45] assigned to Paul and assigned to the
[54:47] first church age on down to the seventh
[54:49] and they're still pondering and looking
[54:51] at what God did through Paul and looking
[54:54] at us today they're saying they're
[54:56] similar but they're so different look at
[54:59] them and what they're dealing with
[55:01] they're living in the the most terrible
[55:03] age that's ever been on the earth and
[55:05] yet it seems like they're at their wits
[55:08] in sometimes and they don't know what to
[55:10] do but father will allow me to be able
[55:14] to give them a little boost and they
[55:16] don't even know where it comes from but
[55:19] it's like they're all alone and he'll
[55:21] he'll send a message to me and I'm their
[55:24] angel to watch over them and I will get
[55:26] down near where they are are and from my
[55:29] being projects a supernatural strength
[55:33] and they're thinkinking lord I can't go
[55:35] another day I don't think I can put up
[55:37] with anything else and all of a sudden
[55:40] I'm allowed to send a charge through
[55:43] them like a battery and where they were
[55:46] standing there with their heads bowed
[55:48] and crying and in the next moment tears
[55:51] are running out of their eyes and
[55:52] they're saying thank you Lord Jesus
[55:55] thank you Lord Jesus they didn't even
[55:57] know it was me standing right there by
[55:59] him amen oh Hallelujah to God so what is
[56:05] the Holy Ghost you see the Holy Ghost is
[56:09] not Jesus the human body of God living
[56:15] in US you understand that so God did not
[56:18] divide the human body and give you an
[56:22] eye you an ear you a piece of hair there
[56:25] was not enough Humanity in that body the
[56:29] body itself served as a carrier of the
[56:33] sacrificial blood but the token was not
[56:37] the body of
[56:39] Jesus now listen carefully the token was
[56:43] not even the
[56:44] chemistry of the
[56:46] blood but the token was the spirit which
[56:50] was inside the body that was not enough
[56:55] chemistry in the body of the Lord Jesus
[56:57] if you'd give every one of us a drop of
[56:59] that blood as we say and the songwriters
[57:02] write about it it makes a good song but
[57:04] it's not really true the blood literally
[57:06] is not applied to Your Heart Right There
[57:09] was not enough chemistry inside that
[57:11] body to do it but God was able to hide
[57:15] in the blood cell so what is the Holy
[57:17] Ghost the attribute of God which could
[57:21] be
[57:23] divided you understand the Eternal
[57:25] himself and that original attribute
[57:28] could not divide himself into multiple
[57:32] portions and send it around the world I
[57:34] wonder how many people tonight on the
[57:36] face of the Earth have the true baptism
[57:39] of the Holy Ghost and it's the exact
[57:41] same holy ghost that Peter got on the
[57:43] day of Pentecost and let me just say
[57:45] this tonight in case you're wondering
[57:47] you late folks don't have a lesser Holy
[57:50] Ghost than what preachers have got and
[57:53] US regular preachers don't have a lesser
[57:56] Holy Ghost than what the prophet had
[57:58] it's the same Holy Ghost right but it's
[58:00] our calling and so on that makes us
[58:03] different you young people have got the
[58:05] same Holy Ghost so there's not like a
[58:07] young people version of the Holy Ghost
[58:10] so there in heaven you know God's got a
[58:12] special young people version and that's
[58:14] why young people can listen to rock and
[58:16] roll gospel because they're Holy Ghost
[58:18] allows them it's exactly the same holy
[58:20] ghost that us old people have got so if
[58:24] it is is it should be the same way we
[58:27] should act the same way now let me just
[58:29] go on and say so then the Chinese people
[58:32] that get the Holy Ghost get the same
[58:33] Holy Ghost then the Mexican people right
[58:36] get the same Holy Ghost uh uh the Native
[58:39] Americans get the same Holy Ghost of
[58:41] people in in Czechoslovakia and Poland
[58:43] and all around the world exact same Holy
[58:46] Ghost is that right so then you see
[58:48] whenever God sends a message globally
[58:50] around the world and sends the spirit of
[58:53] Christ into the hearts of those True
[58:55] Believers then this is why the standard
[58:58] of Holiness righteousness Purity and
[59:00] holding to that same gospel can be the
[59:03] same no matter where you are unless of
[59:06] course you hold on to your tradition
[59:08] over the top of the teaching of the word
[59:12] now you find that of course you go into
[59:13] different places and you'll find that
[59:15] they hold on to their original tradition
[59:18] which you're not supposed to do it's
[59:19] you're supposed to be baptized into one
[59:22] mystical body by the Holy Ghost so let's
[59:26] look now so how the Holy Ghost came Acts
[59:29] chapter 2 you're all familiar with it
[59:30] how the Holy Ghost came Acts 2 and when
[59:33] the day of Pentecost was fully come they
[59:35] were all with one Accord in one place
[59:37] and suddenly there came a sound from
[59:39] Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and
[59:42] it filled all the house where they were
[59:44] sitting wow what a strange way to get
[59:47] the Holy Ghost they wasn't even at an
[59:49] altar nobody was beating them on the
[59:51] back nobody was taking that g
[59:56] no they were all setting now listen to
[59:58] me this is the only time in the book of
[1:00:01] Acts that it happened quite this way now
[1:00:05] it happened of course in Cornelius it
[1:00:07] actually happened in Acts 19 but nowhere
[1:00:10] else does it mention exactly in this
[1:00:12] same way of a rushing Mighty
[1:00:16] Wind Now read your Bible and you'll find
[1:00:19] that out watch what God did suddenly
[1:00:21] there came a sound from Heaven as of a
[1:00:23] rushing Mighty Wind and it bu all the
[1:00:25] house the house the house where they
[1:00:30] were sitting and there appeared unto
[1:00:32] them clothing tongues like as a fire
[1:00:36] appeared unto them clothing tongues like
[1:00:39] as a fire now this is the original
[1:00:42] breaking up of the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:44] Ghost so it was like this big Pillar of
[1:00:47] Fire comes into the upper room and he
[1:00:50] started whipping around in the room and
[1:00:52] a lick went off and went
[1:00:58] clothing tongues of fire begin to set
[1:01:02] upon each of them notice what it says
[1:01:05] and it set upon each of them so he
[1:01:09] didn't say that the fire the burning
[1:01:11] fire actually went in them read your
[1:01:14] Bible but it sat so it came and set upon
[1:01:18] them this is the original dividing of
[1:01:22] God separating himself s into this
[1:01:26] attribute where that this is the first
[1:01:28] time it's ever happened since the dawn
[1:01:31] of creation that more than a prophet
[1:01:34] more than just one man in the age would
[1:01:37] be able to have the spirit of Christ
[1:01:39] that would testify of what he's going to
[1:01:42] do but here they are 120 people and it's
[1:01:46] visible God wanted them to be able to
[1:01:49] see it that's what I said God never done
[1:01:51] this in another place in the book of
[1:01:53] Acts but this was a visible appearing so
[1:01:58] here you've been looking around 120 of
[1:02:00] them and you have saw pillar fire there
[1:02:03] lick over him one over her one over him
[1:02:05] one over her one over a young person one
[1:02:07] over another person and it was visible
[1:02:10] God wanted them to see what he was doing
[1:02:14] he was dividing himself into this
[1:02:18] attribute now notice in verse four and
[1:02:21] they were all filled wow notice how it
[1:02:25] happens though suddenly there come a
[1:02:27] sound of a rushing Mighty Wind and it
[1:02:30] filled all the house where they were
[1:02:32] sitting and there appeared unto them
[1:02:34] clothing tongues like as a fire and set
[1:02:39] upon each of them and then they were all
[1:02:42] filled with the Holy Ghost one sign
[1:02:45] leading to another signs to get their
[1:02:49] attention no wonder that Paul in the
[1:02:51] book of Corinthians talked about tongues
[1:02:53] and prophet prophecy about one being
[1:02:55] assigned to the believer and one was
[1:02:57] assigned to the unbeliever and they were
[1:03:00] all filled with the Holy Ghost and began
[1:03:03] to speak with other
[1:03:07] tongues now notice they were filled with
[1:03:10] the Holy Ghost and they begin to speak
[1:03:13] with other tongues as the spirit gave
[1:03:18] them utterance I love the meaning of
[1:03:21] this word I can't believe it I honest
[1:03:24] cannot believe it that I've been
[1:03:26] preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:28] now for how many every years I've been
[1:03:30] preaching and I had never actually
[1:03:33] looked up the word utterance until today
[1:03:37] but boy am I glad I did today I want you
[1:03:41] to look at what this word means speak
[1:03:44] force not a word of everyday speech but
[1:03:50] one belonging to dignified and an
[1:03:55] elevated
[1:03:58] discourse and the spirit was giving them
[1:04:02] a
[1:04:03] dignified elevated discourse well I
[1:04:06] reckon this is a bunch of
[1:04:08] ignoramuses they were ignorant and
[1:04:11] unlearned can you imagine as they begin
[1:04:14] to speak this way and they were looking
[1:04:16] around and they were speaking Arabian
[1:04:19] they were speaking Spanish they were
[1:04:21] speaking Chalan they were speaking
[1:04:24] Hebrew they were speaking all these
[1:04:26] different languages and they were
[1:04:28] looking at each other and just speaking
[1:04:30] in these languages they never knew these
[1:04:32] languages but it was the spirit of God
[1:04:35] giving them utterance now I realize
[1:04:38] there's people around the message today
[1:04:40] they say we're Way Beyond that and we
[1:04:42] don't need that you show me where he
[1:04:43] took it out I'll preach the same thing
[1:04:46] now I do believe that as the people of
[1:04:48] God we should never major on a minor but
[1:04:51] I am enough of a musician to know that
[1:04:54] if a songwriter writes a song and puts
[1:04:58] miners in the song even if you don't
[1:05:01] think they belong there and you sing
[1:05:02] them without it the song will not sound
[1:05:05] the same without them and it just so
[1:05:08] happens that the author of the New
[1:05:10] Testament song put minors in with
[1:05:14] Majors so when he minored I want to
[1:05:17] minor with him when he majored I want to
[1:05:19] Major if he diminishes if he goes to a
[1:05:22] seventh or a ninth or an argumented
[1:05:25] whatever he does I want to follow it I
[1:05:27] to be honest with you I really don't
[1:05:29] care if you think it sounds good or not
[1:05:31] because I'm not playing for you I'm
[1:05:33] playing for
[1:05:34] him amen that's the way you should look
[1:05:37] at it as well I'm not here tonight every
[1:05:39] one of you should look at it exactly the
[1:05:40] same I'm not here tonight to just
[1:05:42] necessarily please the church I'm not
[1:05:44] here tonight to please my wife my
[1:05:46] husband my family I'm here to please God
[1:05:50] if some of us would get that out of our
[1:05:51] mind I think we'd Worship the Lord a
[1:05:53] little a little bit more than what we do
[1:05:55] but we're scared to death somebody's
[1:05:57] going to think we're Pentecostal I'm
[1:05:59] scared they're going to think I ain't
[1:06:01] all
[1:06:03] right now notice in verse 38 whenever
[1:06:07] Peter begins and the the the 120 go out
[1:06:11] and the people out there they look at
[1:06:13] them and they're acting so peculiar and
[1:06:17] odd and they said they're
[1:06:19] drunk now do you honestly think they
[1:06:23] would have said they were
[1:06:28] drunk had they been setting like
[1:06:35] this you see us in the message many of
[1:06:37] us have quit saying amen and instead we
[1:06:41] nod I wonder what hadie R would have got
[1:06:45] from God if she would have
[1:06:48] nodded you see the prophet did not tell
[1:06:51] her hady because you nodded but he said
[1:06:54] you said the right thing God wants to
[1:06:57] hear your amens God wants to hear you
[1:07:01] see it's not just the preacher that
[1:07:02] wants to hear them God wants to hear
[1:07:06] them now Peter's in and they move
[1:07:09] outside and they're kind of Staggering
[1:07:11] around and you know my goodness what in
[1:07:13] the world is wrong with them people and
[1:07:15] they said well they're trunk and they
[1:07:17] said no no no it ain't that this is just
[1:07:19] the third hour of the day while the
[1:07:21] saloons and taverns ain't even open yet
[1:07:23] it's the morning time so this is the
[1:07:25] third hour of the day but this is that
[1:07:27] which was spoken of by the prophet Joel
[1:07:30] so they begin to say well what what must
[1:07:33] me what must we do them to get what
[1:07:35] y'all got then Peter said unto them
[1:07:38] repent and be baptized every one of
[1:07:41] you in the name of Father Son and Holy
[1:07:47] Ghost H what' he say in the name of
[1:07:51] Jesus Christ you mean to tell me that he
[1:07:55] stands right there and says the exact
[1:07:58] opposite of what Jesus said in Matthew
[1:08:03] 2819 no he actually said the same thing
[1:08:06] cuz father ain't a name I'm a father but
[1:08:10] that ain't my name how many men in here
[1:08:12] our
[1:08:15] fathers yes sir so is Father your name
[1:08:17] brother
[1:08:18] Matthew so the children go to say father
[1:08:21] father father father how many of us men
[1:08:24] would say yes
[1:08:29] yes so Peter says you got to repent you
[1:08:32] got to be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:08:34] Christ and you shall receive the gift of
[1:08:37] the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you
[1:08:39] and your children to all that are far
[1:08:41] off even as many as the Lord Our God
[1:08:44] shall call acts 5:32 for we Are
[1:08:47] Witnesses of these Saints so is also the
[1:08:49] Holy Ghost whom God has given to them
[1:08:53] that that obey him which is the main
[1:08:55] reason more people don't have
[1:08:58] it to them that obey him so this is how
[1:09:02] it comes acts
[1:09:03] 8:14 now when the apostles which were at
[1:09:06] Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
[1:09:08] received the word of God they sent they
[1:09:12] sent I want you to know Peter and John
[1:09:15] didn't go on their own read your Bible
[1:09:19] they didn't go on their own they were
[1:09:23] sent
[1:09:24] praise the Lord they sent unto them
[1:09:26] Peter and John who when they were come
[1:09:29] down prayed for them that they might
[1:09:32] receive the Holy Ghost for as yet he was
[1:09:35] fallen on none of them only they oh
[1:09:40] no they were baptized in the name of the
[1:09:43] Lord
[1:09:45] Jesus oh my goodness you mean to tell me
[1:09:47] the Apostolic Church baptized in the
[1:09:50] name of the Lord Jesus amen is this your
[1:09:54] Bible Well if you haven't been baptized
[1:09:56] that way then I ask you tonight
[1:10:00] why acts
[1:10:02] 10:43 to him give all the prophets
[1:10:05] witness that through his name whosoever
[1:10:08] believeth in him shall receive remission
[1:10:10] of sins notice through his name verse 44
[1:10:15] while Peter yet spake these words the
[1:10:18] Holy Ghost fell on all them which had
[1:10:22] heard the word
[1:10:24] now want you notice in the three
[1:10:26] accounts that we're reading here about
[1:10:29] the Holy Ghost coming none of them are
[1:10:32] exactly
[1:10:34] identical amen isn't it amazing though
[1:10:37] how that we want everybody to get it the
[1:10:39] same way we did and we think boy if you
[1:10:43] didn't shout you didn't get it if you
[1:10:44] don't run you didn't get it if you don't
[1:10:47] speak in tongues if you don't jerk your
[1:10:48] head a certain way you didn't get it
[1:10:50] that's not following the book of Acts
[1:10:52] pattern
[1:10:54] well come on now and they of the
[1:10:56] circumcision in which believed were
[1:11:00] astonished as many as came with Peter
[1:11:03] because that on the Gentiles now listen
[1:11:06] to me the Jews were very very set in
[1:11:12] their National
[1:11:14] thinking in one sense of the word they
[1:11:17] were still yet to be enlightened that
[1:11:20] there was a gentile bride they were
[1:11:22] shocked Harry
[1:11:24] they were shocked astonished you mean
[1:11:27] them dogs got the Holy Ghost this the
[1:11:31] same one that we got how is that PO
[1:11:35] possible we are Abraham's chosen race we
[1:11:39] are Abraham's chosen people how in the
[1:11:43] world could they get the Holy Ghost come
[1:11:46] on you see the mystery of the Gentile
[1:11:48] bride had not yet been made known and
[1:11:51] God wanted to prove to them Jews look
[1:11:54] I'm giving the Holy Ghost the exact same
[1:11:57] one you got to them
[1:12:00] Gentiles aren't you glad praise the Lord
[1:12:04] and as many as came with Peter because
[1:12:06] that on the Gentiles also was poured out
[1:12:10] the gift of the Holy Ghost now I want
[1:12:13] you to notice what they done for they
[1:12:14] heard them speak with
[1:12:17] tongues and magnify God but ain't it
[1:12:21] amazing in every other place it does and
[1:12:23] say that they spoke in tongues wonder
[1:12:26] why this is significant because they was
[1:12:29] looking at it still through the tongue
[1:12:31] aspect and God said okay I see you're
[1:12:33] hung up on the tongues so I'm going to
[1:12:36] let this Bunch speak in tongues too so
[1:12:38] it'll convince you all that they got the
[1:12:40] same thing you
[1:12:42] got did they have to to have the Holy
[1:12:45] Ghost
[1:12:49] no oh my for they heard them speak with
[1:12:53] tongue
[1:12:53] and magnify God then answered Peter can
[1:12:57] any forbid water that these should not
[1:13:01] be baptized which has received the Holy
[1:13:03] Ghost as well as we now watch this is
[1:13:07] God pouring out of himself and he's
[1:13:11] dispersing himself and the angels of God
[1:13:14] now this is what's going on in the the
[1:13:15] visible realm but in the invisible realm
[1:13:19] now the angels of God are being divided
[1:13:22] so it's like a subdivision being built
[1:13:24] in a mystical Kingdom so the angels are
[1:13:27] being divided and they're not only now
[1:13:29] just watching Jews but some of the
[1:13:32] angels for the first time in their
[1:13:34] existence of their creation they're
[1:13:37] watching over heathens former
[1:13:41] Gentiles heathens you imagine the angels
[1:13:45] of God being assigned to former Gentiles
[1:13:49] which were idolators oh my and they
[1:13:52] never they never had done this before it
[1:13:55] was Daniel you know it was it was some
[1:13:57] great king over in the Old Testament it
[1:14:00] was some great king Uzziah or Joshua and
[1:14:03] for the first time in their existence
[1:14:05] they're being assigned to
[1:14:11] Gentiles praise the
[1:14:13] Lord and he said unto them now watch
[1:14:17] this is Paul going to the upper coast of
[1:14:18] Ephesus and the prophet you know in
[1:14:21] order so we'd be able to relate to it he
[1:14:23] he said he found a bunch of Baptist up
[1:14:25] there and they hadn't got the Holy Ghost
[1:14:28] yet so he said unto them have you
[1:14:30] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:14:31] believed and they were some message
[1:14:36] people and they said unto him we've not
[1:14:40] so much as heard whether there be any
[1:14:44] Holy
[1:14:45] Ghost now I find this absolutely amazing
[1:14:48] because they were following John the
[1:14:50] Baptist two dispensations had changed
[1:14:55] and they were behind two
[1:14:59] dispensations so they hadn't even heard
[1:15:01] of the Holy Ghost which again I find
[1:15:03] strange since John had it from his
[1:15:06] mother's
[1:15:08] womb his mother got it and his father
[1:15:11] got it and they hadn't even heard about
[1:15:14] it so it goes to show you that you can
[1:15:18] follow a prophet's message and still not
[1:15:20] have the Holy
[1:15:22] Ghost
[1:15:24] now this is pretty pitiful to me oh my
[1:15:27] and he said unto them unto what notice
[1:15:31] what unto what then were you baptized
[1:15:34] and they said unto John's baptism so see
[1:15:37] there are two dispensations behind so
[1:15:39] John did not baptize in a name now John
[1:15:43] was not the first one to baptize the
[1:15:45] ases baptized the zealots baptized so
[1:15:47] there was different ones that baptized
[1:15:50] but John was the first one to baptize
[1:15:52] point in unto a Messianic Advent and
[1:15:56] he'd say You Must Believe on him which
[1:15:59] is to
[1:16:01] come on him which is to come he didn't
[1:16:05] have no name cuz you weren't sure who he
[1:16:07] was yet so these people now several
[1:16:11] years after the Lord Jesus had come and
[1:16:13] gone several years after the Holy Ghost
[1:16:16] had been given and they were still
[1:16:18] baptizing people in this same way you've
[1:16:21] got to believe on him which is to
[1:16:27] come but there was some seed among them
[1:16:32] Baptist there still might be
[1:16:35] today praise the Lord and he said unto
[1:16:38] them then what were you baptized and
[1:16:40] they said unto John baptism then said
[1:16:42] Paul John verely baptized with the
[1:16:44] baptism of repentance saying unto the
[1:16:47] people that they should believe on him
[1:16:50] which should come after him now Paul can
[1:16:53] give the name that is on Christ Jesus
[1:16:55] know how he places the order here now
[1:16:57] Christos anointed Humanity so it's
[1:17:00] anointed Humanity Christ Jesus you know
[1:17:03] that the New Testament when the angel of
[1:17:05] God appeared to Mary and also on to
[1:17:06] Joseph and spoke his name it did not
[1:17:09] call him Lord Jesus Christ he was not
[1:17:13] called that until the book of Acts why
[1:17:17] he was CHR Christos the anointed one out
[1:17:20] the river he was named Jesus Jesus the
[1:17:24] human Jesus when the father came in him
[1:17:27] at the river he was jeus Christos but he
[1:17:31] was Lord Jesus Christ after he raised
[1:17:34] from the dead for God has made this same
[1:17:38] Jesus both Lord and Christ Lord Jesus
[1:17:43] Christ father son Holy
[1:17:47] Ghost oh praise be to God notice so here
[1:17:51] them Paul tells them John baptized the
[1:17:53] people and tells them what he said they
[1:17:55] should believe on him which should come
[1:17:57] which is that is on Christ Jesus and
[1:17:59] when they heard this they were
[1:18:03] baptized wow so is there anyone here
[1:18:08] tonight or anyone that will listen to
[1:18:10] this if you can show me in the book of
[1:18:13] Acts or in recorded history of the first
[1:18:18] century of the church second century as
[1:18:21] well where the original Church baptized
[1:18:24] using the titles of father son Holy
[1:18:28] Ghost I will stand here next Wednesday
[1:18:30] night and say I was
[1:18:34] wrong right or of course you can let me
[1:18:36] re-baptize you
[1:18:38] tonight cuz you ain't going to find it
[1:18:41] this is the way the true church
[1:18:45] baptized praise the Lord now notice how
[1:18:49] they get the Holy Ghost and when Paul
[1:18:53] had laid his hands upon them the Holy
[1:18:56] Ghost Came Upon them and they spake with
[1:19:00] tongues and
[1:19:03] prophesied now notice different from
[1:19:06] what happened in the upper room and
[1:19:09] different from what happened when Peter
[1:19:11] spake the word and they spake the word
[1:19:14] and when he done it then they just
[1:19:16] receive the Holy Ghost by by hearing the
[1:19:19] word but here and this is where the
[1:19:22] Prophet picks it up of course and he
[1:19:23] said the apostolic way of receiving the
[1:19:27] Holy Ghost is to have hands laid on
[1:19:31] you but notice it does not say in Acts
[1:19:34] two that when they got the holy ghost
[1:19:37] that they
[1:19:39] prophesied but these Believers in the
[1:19:41] upper coast of Ephesus did so which one
[1:19:44] are we going to use to say well that's
[1:19:46] the right way all of them are all of
[1:19:50] them are a't it amazing that God didn't
[1:19:53] make every one of them exactly the same
[1:19:55] so this and spoken tongue this and
[1:19:57] spoken tongues this and prophesied this
[1:19:59] and shouted don't you understand what
[1:20:01] Satan's trying to do he's trying to make
[1:20:03] a denominational thing out of even
[1:20:06] receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:09] and then the message people that lean
[1:20:10] more toward the emotion and the ecstatic
[1:20:13] explosion of all of that everybody that
[1:20:15] don't have that you ain't got it the
[1:20:17] ones that are more still on the other
[1:20:19] side and they produce stillborn children
[1:20:21] well bless God it's a you know the Holy
[1:20:23] Ghost without sensation you don't have
[1:20:26] no sensation and no emotion and somehow
[1:20:29] you just grow into it you know you're
[1:20:31] just one day you'll just wake up and
[1:20:33] realize that you've been born again how
[1:20:35] in the world can that ever happen how
[1:20:38] can a man that's as lost as lost can be
[1:20:40] not realize that God has changed his
[1:20:44] nature oh praise the Lord Now watch how
[1:20:49] the prophet dealt with what the Holy
[1:20:51] Ghost actually is and what is the Holy
[1:20:54] Ghost what is the Holy Ghost it is the
[1:20:57] spirit of Christ in you now before we
[1:21:00] read I just like to say a few commoning
[1:21:02] words here what is the Holy Ghost it's a
[1:21:05] seal what is the Holy Ghost it's a
[1:21:08] covenant What is the Holy Ghost it's a
[1:21:11] sign what is the Holy Ghost then it's
[1:21:15] the spirit of Jesus Christ in you so
[1:21:21] then it's not emotion it's not shouting
[1:21:24] though it will bring all types of
[1:21:27] effects some spoke in tongues some
[1:21:30] prophesied and yet it's amazing now look
[1:21:32] you know I believe in Emotion I believe
[1:21:34] in worshiping God and yet none of those
[1:21:37] scriptures that we read when they
[1:21:39] receive the Holy Ghost do we find where
[1:21:41] any of them as we say today
[1:21:45] shouted now brother Donnie don't you
[1:21:47] believe in that I do but I do not
[1:21:49] believe in making shouting an Evidence
[1:21:52] of the Holy Ghost you won't find that in
[1:21:55] the book of Acts as a matter of fact you
[1:21:57] won't even find where they shouted in
[1:22:00] the way that we think shouting is don't
[1:22:03] you believe in the quickening power of
[1:22:05] God I do and I don't like it when we
[1:22:07] make a denomination out of it that's
[1:22:10] exactly what some people are doing
[1:22:12] they're making a denomination what do
[1:22:14] you mean a denomination it's where
[1:22:16] everybody has to do it this way right
[1:22:18] here because this way's been declared my
[1:22:20] men it's not declared in the book of
[1:22:22] acts if it is you show me you preachers
[1:22:26] that won't like this you send me the
[1:22:28] scriptures and I'll
[1:22:31] apologize show me show me what they
[1:22:35] shouted and they they did all of that I
[1:22:37] believe in all of that but it is not an
[1:22:40] Evidence any more than other evidences
[1:22:44] that we make well somebody say
[1:22:47] amen and we can see how that these these
[1:22:50] different examples that God gave and
[1:22:52] every time that it came it was a little
[1:22:55] bit different well someone say well how
[1:22:57] did you get the Holy Ghost I got his
[1:22:58] sitting right here and her preacher
[1:22:59] preach the word well they might go up to
[1:23:01] Ephesus said brother tell me how you got
[1:23:03] the Holy Ghost I'll tell you what Paul
[1:23:05] laid his hands on me well my Lord what
[1:23:07] in the world you must not be near as
[1:23:09] much of a Believer as I am I sat right
[1:23:11] there and heard that word hallelujah you
[1:23:13] know how we are about that I sat right
[1:23:14] there and heard that word GL to God I'll
[1:23:17] tell you one thing I'm so spiritual I
[1:23:19] sat right there and heard the word of
[1:23:20] God and I sat right there man alive that
[1:23:23] eternal life entered into me and the
[1:23:25] other say well Paul laid his hands on me
[1:23:27] and I got it does it really matter does
[1:23:29] it really matter whether you were
[1:23:31] sitting or standing or rolling in the
[1:23:33] floor like a Holy Roller does it really
[1:23:36] matter the most important thing is what
[1:23:39] you got it you got it so whether you
[1:23:43] spoke in tongues and prophesied or you
[1:23:45] fell out in the floor you got it how do
[1:23:48] I know it changed you
[1:23:51] forever
[1:23:58] now watch brother Brandon preached this
[1:24:00] in 1959 and he preached the first
[1:24:03] service what is the Holy Ghost second
[1:24:07] service you know what is it given for
[1:24:09] and then the third service he preached
[1:24:13] how will you know you got it which I
[1:24:15] find it so amazing that they recorded it
[1:24:20] but it's never yet been released
[1:24:25] and then yet he does question
[1:24:28] answers so you saying isn't that strange
[1:24:31] isn't that
[1:24:32] odd that he would actually allow that to
[1:24:36] be released well let me say it to you
[1:24:39] this
[1:24:40] way it was not released in
[1:24:46] 1959 but the mystery of it was going to
[1:24:50] be released when he reti titled it and
[1:24:53] called it the
[1:24:58] token so how you going to know well
[1:25:01] brother Donnie if you're a woman your
[1:25:02] hair go out and you have a long dress
[1:25:04] and and if you're a brother you you'll
[1:25:05] uh you know you dress this way and that
[1:25:07] way and Men of course won't wear dresses
[1:25:09] to church and Men won't wear you know
[1:25:11] this and that look like a woman and
[1:25:12] that's the way you know it no that's not
[1:25:14] the way you'll know it that is part of
[1:25:16] it but you will be changed from what you
[1:25:19] were unto a brand new creature in Christ
[1:25:24] Jesus and the church said amen now he
[1:25:27] said what did the Holy Spirit what did
[1:25:28] it come for what did he come in you for
[1:25:33] what did he come in me for now listen
[1:25:35] it's quite simple was to continue the
[1:25:38] works of
[1:25:40] God to continue the works of God now
[1:25:45] remember part of these things were
[1:25:47] limited when the Lord Jesus come on the
[1:25:50] earth he's going to now sh share things
[1:25:53] of nature that had not been done since
[1:25:56] Adam lost it in the
[1:25:59] fall he's going to share things over
[1:26:02] animals and over nature and over storms
[1:26:07] that had not been replicated since the
[1:26:10] Fall In the Garden of Eden he's going to
[1:26:14] reverse nature he's going to reverse the
[1:26:18] cycle of death and go to a man's grave
[1:26:23] and he's been laying there for 4 days
[1:26:26] and his nose had fallen in and the skin
[1:26:29] worms were eating on his body and by the
[1:26:33] spoken word of God he's going to call
[1:26:35] that man's name and he'll come out of
[1:26:37] that grave is that right now he didn't
[1:26:41] just do that for himself and said now
[1:26:43] look at me you all can't do this but I
[1:26:46] want you to see what I am but what you
[1:26:48] all do you just go to church and you try
[1:26:50] to live right and you try to be be as
[1:26:52] good good as you
[1:26:54] can but he said now I'm showing you all
[1:26:57] what to do and I want you to act like me
[1:27:02] talk like me preach like me live like me
[1:27:06] raise the Dead Like Me cast out devils
[1:27:08] like me yeah now remember he says here
[1:27:11] that the Holy Ghost was given that we
[1:27:13] might continue the works of God remember
[1:27:15] the blind man and St John 11 whenever
[1:27:17] the disciples said Lord who s this man
[1:27:19] or his parents and Jesus said neither
[1:27:21] one but that The Works of God might be
[1:27:24] made manifest and then of course in
[1:27:27] another place in John they asked him and
[1:27:28] said Lord what might we do to do the
[1:27:32] works of God and he said this is the
[1:27:34] work of God that you believe on him whom
[1:27:39] he hath sent so the works of God then
[1:27:42] incorporates healing miraculous but it
[1:27:46] also means you're able to get in line
[1:27:48] behind the godall leader of the age and
[1:27:52] a god call Pastor and so on and so on
[1:27:55] that's also part of the works of God
[1:27:58] Jesus knew every woman was not going to
[1:28:00] cast out Devils Hallelujah come here
[1:28:02] devil I'm ready for you he knew the
[1:28:04] daughters of God was not going to do
[1:28:06] that th and sharan went to Brother Bram
[1:28:08] said brother brandham I fasted and
[1:28:09] fasted to cast out devils and I still
[1:28:12] can't do it he said you're not called to
[1:28:14] do such he said but you're called to
[1:28:17] fast and pray for those who are called
[1:28:20] to cast them out and you said well I
[1:28:22] can't do nothing brother Donnie's called
[1:28:24] to do that and brother Joe and brother
[1:28:25] Daryl and brother Joel these other
[1:28:27] brother Jonathan these other brothers
[1:28:29] that are called whoever they are but I
[1:28:31] can't do nothing yes you can you can
[1:28:33] pray for me and you can pray for the
[1:28:35] rest of these brothers because we're not
[1:28:37] dealing with a little video saying when
[1:28:39] you're dealing with a demon you're
[1:28:41] dealing with a fallen angel oh what a
[1:28:43] comfort it is to know that the saints of
[1:28:46] God are praying for
[1:28:50] you so what do we do we continue the
[1:28:54] works of God which is what building a
[1:28:58] church having church
[1:29:02] membership
[1:29:05] really so it's not just going to church
[1:29:07] every now and then whether you feel like
[1:29:08] it or not and and you know you drop a
[1:29:10] little money in and and you really don't
[1:29:12] believe in ping ties and you really
[1:29:13] don't believe in walking right and doing
[1:29:15] right and you know you just you just go
[1:29:16] to church that's the work of God that's
[1:29:18] the way Jesus did the Bible says that
[1:29:21] Jesus on the Sabbath day went to the
[1:29:23] synagogue which was his
[1:29:25] custom so lets me know a lot of the
[1:29:27] folks around the message don't have the
[1:29:29] custom of Jesus cuz Jesus went to church
[1:29:32] and if they really believe what them
[1:29:33] tapes say they don't because their feet
[1:29:36] testify they're voting with their feet
[1:29:38] not with their mouths then they would
[1:29:40] know exactly that the prophet tells us
[1:29:42] even Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[1:29:44] that if God is in your heart you can't
[1:29:47] wait for them doors to open you see the
[1:29:50] reason people don't feel that way
[1:29:51] they're missing God in their heart well
[1:29:54] come on somebody if God is in your heart
[1:29:57] you can't wait for them doors to come
[1:29:59] open and he said if you don't feel that
[1:30:01] way I tell you it's time you got to pray
[1:30:05] it come on somebody let's say what the
[1:30:09] tapes
[1:30:11] say praise the Lord now I love the way
[1:30:14] that he goes on down in this paragraph a
[1:30:16] little further and he said the Jesus
[1:30:19] that sends you goes with you and is in
[1:30:24] you and if that Spirit living in Jesus
[1:30:27] Christ made him do and act the way he
[1:30:30] did you'll have some general idea of how
[1:30:34] it will do what it's in you because that
[1:30:37] life cannot change it'll go from body to
[1:30:42] body but it cannot change its nature
[1:30:45] listen what it is now for it is
[1:30:50] God
[1:30:53] your baptism of the Holy
[1:30:57] Ghost is your
[1:30:59] portion of
[1:31:02] God now you all educate me for a
[1:31:06] bit dogs bring
[1:31:09] forth help me now educate me some of
[1:31:11] y'all been wanting to teach me a few
[1:31:13] things so help me now cats bring forth
[1:31:17] horses bring
[1:31:19] forth so what would God bring forth if
[1:31:22] he brought forth
[1:31:24] children say it come on you you can do
[1:31:27] it come on that's it come on come on
[1:31:28] honey say it say it what would God bring
[1:31:32] forth gods in
[1:31:35] humanity but you see we look so much at
[1:31:38] our Humanity we suppress the Divine
[1:31:42] Supernatural and what you and I suppress
[1:31:45] the angels of God are looking at in
[1:31:48] amazement and they just are mesmerized
[1:31:51] by about what's inside of us and we're
[1:31:53] saying well I ain't nobody I don't ever
[1:31:55] amount to nothing I guess you know I
[1:31:57] just make so many mistakes and they're
[1:31:58] looking at every one of them mistakes
[1:32:00] and you make and they're not even
[1:32:01] thinking that about you at all they
[1:32:03] think don't they know what he told them
[1:32:05] don't they know what he said that he
[1:32:07] don't even see their mistakes don't they
[1:32:09] know that that blood that he shed on the
[1:32:12] cross don't they know that it ain't no
[1:32:13] wonder that they look at us and they
[1:32:15] thinking you know I how how could he
[1:32:17] love
[1:32:18] them he gave his life he gave his word
[1:32:21] he gave his Bible then he sends a
[1:32:23] message with over 1100 sermon and then
[1:32:25] they still question does he even love
[1:32:27] them it's a there's said what in the
[1:32:30] world is it going to take for them bunch
[1:32:31] of Noe heads that's Kentucky language
[1:32:34] translated into Angelic language I guess
[1:32:36] what's he going to take for them to
[1:32:38] realize how much he cares and they're
[1:32:40] looking at you
[1:32:42] daily and thinking if you only
[1:32:45] knew what I knew about
[1:32:50] you thank you Lord
[1:32:52] praise be to
[1:32:54] God notice this what is the Holy Ghost
[1:32:57] again what is the Holy Ghost it's Christ
[1:33:00] in you the
[1:33:03] comforter that's the Holy Spirit when
[1:33:05] the comforter has come he'll do the
[1:33:07] things that I've done while the
[1:33:09] comforter is in me so it's a very same
[1:33:13] father that was in Jesus except he had
[1:33:16] the fullness all of that fullness was in
[1:33:19] him but it was the fullness that was
[1:33:22] going to be
[1:33:23] divided think of how great he is he
[1:33:27] could divide himself into millions of
[1:33:32] parts and he is no less that great
[1:33:36] August presence around the throne is no
[1:33:39] less being subdivided into how many ever
[1:33:43] pieces that he is and he's still as
[1:33:45] great upon the throne as he ever was
[1:33:48] before he divided himself now here he is
[1:33:51] he he on the throne and yet he's on the
[1:33:53] earth and he's in the United States and
[1:33:55] he's in Ohio and he's an Africa he's in
[1:33:58] India and and the angels of God are
[1:34:00] looking and say I didn't know he was
[1:34:01] this big I didn't know he was this great
[1:34:03] I saw that light I saw that shakina I
[1:34:06] saw that Glory I didn't realize you mean
[1:34:08] every time they get the Holy Ghost
[1:34:09] that's him that's him inside of them oh
[1:34:12] my God how great he is how wonderful he
[1:34:13] is and they're just saiding oh how
[1:34:15] awesome how wonderful he is he's
[1:34:17] everywhere I didn't know he's
[1:34:20] everywhere they knew he was Everywhere
[1:34:23] by his omnipotence and by his
[1:34:26] omnipotence but they didn't know he was
[1:34:28] going to be everywhere by dividing
[1:34:32] himself and baptizing himself into a
[1:34:36] little white
[1:34:37] boy and a little black girl and a little
[1:34:42] Indian a little Native American and a
[1:34:44] swed and a
[1:34:48] German and so baptizing with the love of
[1:34:51] God that they by nationality might have
[1:34:53] great differences but they'll be able to
[1:34:55] put their arms around one another and
[1:34:57] say brother I love you sister I love you
[1:35:00] why it's God don't you understand God in
[1:35:04] Me will love God in you that don't mean
[1:35:08] My Flesh will love everything about
[1:35:10] yours I'm going to say something
[1:35:12] shocking it don't mean you're going to
[1:35:14] like everything about me but if God's in
[1:35:18] you you can't hate God in Me and if
[1:35:21] God's in me and in you I can't hate God
[1:35:24] in you we might disagree on the flesh
[1:35:27] but how can God hate
[1:35:32] [Applause]
[1:35:36] God so the Holy Ghost is a seal it's a
[1:35:40] sign it's a comforter watch paragraph 16
[1:35:44] what is the Holy Ghost it's an advocate
[1:35:47] it's an advocate what does it
[1:35:50] do oh oh
[1:35:52] Jesus it has
[1:35:56] Mercy it
[1:35:58] stands in your
[1:36:00] place it does things you can't

[1:36:14] either none of us can do it there's only
[1:36:17] one that could do that and that was the
[1:36:19] Lord Jesus but God wants to come in Us
[1:36:22] in such a way well you say how come some
[1:36:24] people can do it easier than others it's
[1:36:27] because they've learned how to submit
[1:36:31] the key is the more we submit the more
[1:36:36] he can take
[1:36:38] over oh praise God it does things you
[1:36:45] can't do it's a
[1:36:48] perpetuation for your sins

[1:42:25] the spirit moves into this church here
[1:42:28] it'll just raise and it'll bring forth
[1:42:32] all the
[1:42:34] redeemed that's
[1:42:36] touched that
[1:42:43] Spirit no wonder brother Daryl the
[1:42:45] angels of God are looking at it and
[1:42:48] say
[1:42:49] father now you're you're if I understand
[1:42:52] this
[1:42:54] right you're not bringing no
[1:42:56] Resurrection until everyone I'm get to
[1:42:58] Holy Ghost is that right that's
[1:43:01] right and according to what them
[1:43:02] preachers are saying down there you
[1:43:04] imagine Angels listening to preachers to
[1:43:06] be updated on what's
[1:43:07] Happening Lord have
[1:43:10] mercy so according to what them men are
[1:43:12] saying you're you're going to bring your
[1:43:14] people to together for rapturing Faith
[1:43:16] and it will be their faith when they
[1:43:18] come to The Headstone crying Grace Grace
[1:43:20] that when when they come to that spot
[1:43:22] when they arrive there it'll be such a
[1:43:25] cosmic upheaval that the dead will be
[1:43:30] raised father are we getting that right
[1:43:33] and father said
[1:43:35] yep that's what's going to
[1:43:40] happen my church will actually arrive to
[1:43:42] that place of maturity and the devil's
[1:43:45] holding his sides laughing you got to be
[1:43:47] kidding
[1:43:49] me I don't never happened uh devil maybe
[1:43:52] I should take you back to Acts chapter 2
[1:43:55] on the day of Pentecost them men that
[1:43:57] you laughed at and said this church
[1:43:58] won't last three or four days but when
[1:44:00] that Pillar of Fire come down and
[1:44:01] divided himself They Live Like Jesus
[1:44:04] they healed the sick like Jesus they
[1:44:06] died like Jesus they preach the gospel
[1:44:08] they rais the dead that same Lord Jesus
[1:44:10] said he will have a bride in the last
[1:44:13] day Hallelujah he will have a bride in
[1:44:16] the last day that will come to the
[1:44:17] fullness of that maturity again
[1:44:21] at this time unlike
[1:44:24] Paul the alpha bride did not cause a
[1:44:31] resurrection but the Omega bride
[1:44:37] will glory to God glory to God thank you
[1:44:41] Lord list
[1:44:43] stand let me finish this quote here for
[1:44:45] you it'll bring forth them redeemed
[1:44:48] that's touched that Spirit those
[1:44:50] Lutheran who stood there with all the
[1:44:52] light they had in
[1:44:54] justification those methodists that fell
[1:44:56] on the floor and they throw water in
[1:44:58] their face from the spirit striking them
[1:45:02] through
[1:45:03] sanctification those
[1:45:05] Pentecostals that walked up and down the
[1:45:08] streets and they called them Tong deong
[1:45:11] what in the world that ever means and
[1:45:13] jabberers and Goose
[1:45:16] language and all of that they'll stand
[1:45:19] in the righteous
[1:45:21] in the sight of God at that day just as
[1:45:24] certain as this Bible stands in
[1:45:31] here oh my
[1:45:34] Lord imagine the day it'll be
[1:45:37] when the Lord
[1:45:41] Jesus is at wor steps behind the
[1:45:45] curtain and takes off his Priestly
[1:45:48] garments when the angel you'll see him
[1:45:51] rise from the
[1:45:53] throne and he steps off the platform we
[1:45:57] say and when he comes out he's got on
[1:46:01] his marriage
[1:46:04] garments you understand Peter's never
[1:46:06] seen him yet Paul's never seen him the
[1:46:10] Saints in the sixth Dimension haven't
[1:46:12] seen him yet it would be Unbecoming for
[1:46:14] them to see him with blood on his
[1:46:19] garments so he changes
[1:46:23] close imagine when David come in from
[1:46:26] slaying the
[1:46:28] Philistines and laid the forkins of
[1:46:30] those Philistines down before
[1:46:32] Saul he did not go directly and take
[1:46:36] Mall imagine he must have went changed
[1:46:39] clothes took a bath got Philistine sweat
[1:46:43] off of him Philistine blood off of him
[1:46:48] when the Lord Jesus steps out and the
[1:46:51] angel see him for his first time the
[1:46:54] bridegroom
[1:46:57] closed of all they've seen out of him
[1:46:59] they've never seen him look like this
[1:47:02] can you imagine the
[1:47:04] smile I know it maybe seem hard for you
[1:47:06] to
[1:47:07] comprehend but the Lord Jesus actually
[1:47:10] laughed when he was here on the
[1:47:13] earth I imagine one of his greatest
[1:47:16] laughs will be whenever he steps out and
[1:47:20] a smile comes upon his face and they're
[1:47:22] standing there looking at him and say
[1:47:24] I've never seen him smile like
[1:47:28] that and they look at one another and
[1:47:30] say you know what today
[1:47:34] is she's coming
[1:47:38] home him changing clothes is a sign
[1:47:43] you're fixing to
[1:47:45] amen praise God then those of us that
[1:47:49] are alive and and remain will change
[1:47:53] clothes all of a sudden a sweep will
[1:47:56] come over us and our muscles and our
[1:47:58] tissues and our bones and all of that
[1:48:00] will be
[1:48:01] changed Oh but before that happens our
[1:48:04] loved ones will start to appear
[1:48:09] first I told Carol the other day I said
[1:48:11] I want I want to you know I said you
[1:48:13] think about it as long as we've been

[1:48:30] have to build a bigger
[1:48:32] house cuz I guarantee you one thing when

[1:53:26] produce the life of Jesus
[1:53:28] Christ then come the signs then come the
[1:53:31] Wonders then the signs will follow us

[1:53:38] not a sign follower I am a person that
[1:53:42] signs follow yeah that's the way it
[1:53:44] should
[1:53:45] be praise the
[1:53:48] lord lord Jesus as we bow our heads
[1:53:50] tonight
[1:53:51] father as we enter into your August
[1:53:56] courts I pray the presence of God would
[1:53:59] move across this
[1:54:02] place Lord we're sitting in a different
[1:54:04] type building than Peter and them were
[1:54:07] in Acts
[1:54:08] 2 different type of setting than they
[1:54:11] were no doubt at
[1:54:13] Ephesus the other places where the Holy
[1:54:16] Ghost come in the book of
[1:54:17] Acts that's changed
[1:54:20] we're glad we can say tonight the Holy
[1:54:22] Ghost is not
[1:54:24] changed would you come by this way
[1:54:26] tonight
[1:54:28] Lord so what are you once you enter into
[1:54:32] this attribute by which you can divide
[1:54:35] yourself then my brother Harry not being
[1:54:38] a
[1:54:39] preacher but yet has the same holy ghost
[1:54:41] that I
[1:54:43] have my nephew Justin my
[1:54:46] granddaughters both of my daughters my
[1:54:49] son-in-law WS the people here at the
[1:54:52] church the the ones that might feel like
[1:54:53] oh I'm so
[1:54:55] insignificant but yet if they have the
[1:54:57] Holy Ghost they've got exact same holy
[1:54:59] ghost that I've
[1:55:01] got the same
[1:55:04] one and their life is a mystery to
[1:55:09] angels as they watch them and they
[1:55:12] minister to them oh Lord God we need
[1:55:15] your ministering presence tonight
[1:55:18] father
[1:55:20] sometimes we go through so much in life
[1:55:22] Lord we don't know what to do would you
[1:55:26] send an Angel by our way
[1:55:28] Lord we know you sent one to Peter there
[1:55:31] in
[1:55:32] jail and I hope they take it the right
[1:55:34] way when I say it this way that was
[1:55:36] Jesus 2,000 years ago well we're not in
[1:55:39] a physical jail tonight but we still
[1:55:41] need angels to come to us L ministering
[1:55:45] spirits that are sent to minister to the
[1:55:49] air
[1:55:50] of
[1:55:51] Salvation wh what a what a what a thing
[1:55:54] and the word ministering deonia which is
[1:55:56] the very word that Deacon comes from so
[1:56:00] when they chose
[1:56:02] deacons in the book of Acts they were
[1:56:05] men that were chosen to minister so the
[1:56:08] deacons are never called to run the
[1:56:09] church but actually they placed the
[1:56:12] deacons in the church to be able to
[1:56:13] minister to the hungry and to be able to
[1:56:15] take care of the things like that and
[1:56:18] that's the Greek word that it com comes
[1:56:19] from Deacon deonia and it means minister
[1:56:24] to minister
[1:56:26] to can we grasp it
[1:56:30] tonight those great Heavenly
[1:56:33] beings are our
[1:56:38] deons you send a Heavenly
[1:56:41] being that's never said one bad
[1:56:45] word that's never had one thought of
[1:56:48] doubt

[1:56:53] of ever leaving
[1:56:56] you and you send them to me and to these
[1:57:00] people and your people around the
[1:57:02] world Lord
[1:57:05] God who would think of
[1:57:07] such that you would send the greater to
[1:57:11] minister to the
[1:57:13] Lesser unless of
[1:57:15] course the Lesser is actually hid and
[1:57:19] one day the Lesser will enter into such
[1:57:22] a stage of
[1:57:24] glorification that the angels of God
[1:57:26] will Circle the Earth's one day and bow
[1:57:28] their
[1:57:30] heads when the Resurrection The Rapture
[1:57:32] takes place and the prophet tells us
[1:57:34] those angels will circle the Earth with
[1:57:37] bowed heads as the redeemed go to
[1:57:40] singing the songs of your Redemption and
[1:57:44] mercy because they don't know what we're
[1:57:47] singing about
[1:57:50] they Minister about
[1:57:52] it and they minister to give us strength

[1:58:01] it oh Jesus I'm

[2:01:41] to our husband brother bam talked about
[2:01:44] a wife and what a great thing she could
[2:01:46] be and a man comes in tired from work
[2:01:50] and he said he's weary and all that and
[2:01:52] his little wife meets him at the door
[2:01:54] and she comes in takes him by the hand
[2:01:56] and sets him down and she goes over and
[2:01:58] sets in his lap and puts her arms around
[2:02:00] him he said it just feels like it all
[2:02:03] goes
[2:02:04] away I wonder how many times since
[2:02:07] Sunday the Lord jesus' name has been
[2:02:09] taken in vain how many people said he
[2:02:12] don't even live there's no such thing as
[2:02:14] a God how he's been
[2:02:17] blasphemed how he's been ridiculed and
[2:02:20] criticized just in the last couple of
[2:02:23] days why don't we open the door and say
[2:02:26] come on in Lord
[2:02:28] Jesus let's take him by the
[2:02:31] hand let's take him by the hand and go
[2:02:35] over and set him
[2:02:36] down let's sit down in his lap I
[2:02:39] preached this several years ago in a
[2:02:41] convention and the Lord helped me to
[2:02:43] dramatize it like the Song of Solomon
[2:02:46] and how that she went and got him at the
[2:02:48] door door and she brought him in and she
[2:02:52] let him over and set him down and then
[2:02:54] she sat down on his lap and she took her
[2:02:58] arm and put around it and let her eyes
[2:03:02] which at one time could not even look in
[2:03:04] the face of God but now her Li her eyes
[2:03:08] looked at him and he was so mesmerized
[2:03:11] that he said turn away thine eyes for me
[2:03:15] for one of Thine Eyes has captured my
[2:03:18] eyes
[2:03:21] heart there was a brother there from
[2:03:24] Germany I heard him telling some other
[2:03:26] people after the service he said I've
[2:03:28] been a preacher for all these decades
[2:03:30] I've heard hundreds and thousands of
[2:03:32] sermons preached I've never heard
[2:03:35] anything like that in my life he said
[2:03:37] this is what I got out of it he didn't
[2:03:38] see me he said but this is what I got
[2:03:41] out of it that man actually has
[2:03:46] sat in the lap of Jesus
[2:03:51] I thought that's one of the greatest
[2:03:53] compliments I have ever been paid in my
[2:03:57] life it's one thing to say it but when
[2:04:01] you tell the story that you have
[2:04:05] experienced people can tell the
[2:04:07] difference don't you want to be able to
[2:04:10] tell the same
[2:04:13] story that you sat in the lap of Jesus
[2:04:16] and you put your arm around him and then
[2:04:18] you you move both of your hands upon his
[2:04:21] face and you just look into his eyes and
[2:04:23] you say have I told you
[2:04:26] today how much I love you I'll do Carol
[2:04:30] that way sometimes not near enough I'm
[2:04:33] sure I'll take it by the hands and I'll
[2:04:35] pull her real close and I'll say have I
[2:04:37] told you today how much I love you have
[2:04:41] I told you how much you mean to me and
[2:04:44] more times than not she'll say no tell
