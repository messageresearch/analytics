[8:43] I'm
[8:45] amazed at how you
[8:49] came through your
[8:51] preious blood. I found
[8:57] pardon and my
[8:59] sins are washed.
[9:02] They're all washed away. All my

[9:44] sins are washed
[9:49] away. No one
[9:52] knew how alone I was feeling.
[9:58] and the emptiness I tried so hard to
[10:04] hide. Though I laughed and said my life
[10:09] was fine without
[10:12] you. I was covering up the secret tears
[10:17] I
[10:20] cried. Then one
[10:22] day someone told me of your mercy.
[10:28] and the love you showed on a hill called
[10:34] Calvary. Oh, there you
[10:37] died and purchased my
[10:42] salvation when you broke sin's power and
[10:46] set my spirits free.

[11:20] away.

[11:27] away. Oh, it's true. There have been
[11:31] days when I failed
[11:35] you. Lord, you know the many times I've
[11:40] gone
[11:42] astray. Oh, but I've learned your love
[11:46] is stronger than my weakness.
[11:50] is and your ear is open every time I
[11:57] pray. No one else has ever cared for me
[12:03] like you,
[12:06] Lord. Other friends can never be as

[12:51] pardon. My

[39:04] Genesis 1
[39:07] 11. And God said, "Let the earth bring
[39:10] forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and
[39:13] the fruit tree yielding fruit after his
[39:16] kind, whose seed is in itself upon the
[39:21] earth." And it was so. And the earth
[39:25] brought forth grass, an herb yielding
[39:29] seed after his kind. So God said it,
[39:33] then it produced. Now there's a
[39:35] difference between productivity by
[39:39] divine origin and
[39:42] manufacturing by man.
[39:46] Now listen to me carefully. We want
[39:49] spiritual reproduction in our lives and
[39:53] in our church, but we don't want
[39:57] manmade
[39:59] manufacturing. A man can make a lot of
[40:02] stuff, can he? Yeah. He can make all
[40:05] kinds of
[40:07] things, but we don't want
[40:10] manmade, even man-made
[40:14] spirituality. We want it to be divine
[40:16] made. But man can make so many things so
[40:20] close to God. And if you'd look at a
[40:21] hybrid grain of corn or beans or
[40:24] whatever it is in the seed form and
[40:26] you'd put it right by the original and
[40:28] look at it by your eye, you probably
[40:30] wouldn't be able to tell the difference.
[40:32] Size, perimeter, density of moisture
[40:35] inside of it, this that the other,
[40:36] whatever makes it all up. But I'll tell
[40:38] you the way you can tell the difference.
[40:40] Plant it. Yeah. Plant it. And the hybrid
[40:44] will come forth one time and then it's
[40:47] dead. But the original will reproduce.
[40:50] reproduce, reproduce. I keep that in
[40:52] mind as we as we go in this tonight. And
[40:55] the evening and the morning were the
[40:57] third day. But let's read now. Spoken
[40:59] word is the original
[41:01] seed. Page 70, paragraph 3. Adam's
[41:06] bride could not
[41:08] wait. God had told Adam and Eve,
[41:11] "Multiply and replenish the earth." And
[41:16] it was an
[41:17] oncoming
[41:19] thing, a promise. An oncoming thing, a
[41:24] promise. She was not his wife as
[41:30] yet because she had he had never lived
[41:33] with her. The bride of Christ is not his
[41:37] wife yet. The wedding supper is to take
[41:41] place. Get it? Oh, this is rich.
[41:45] She got in a
[41:47] hurry and what did she do? She crossed
[41:51] her seed. She mingled it, excuse me,
[41:55] with the serpent
[41:58] seed. And when she did, she brought a
[42:01] child of death, a child that perverted
[42:06] every child after that. when the church
[42:10] of Jesus Christ was
[42:13] perverted, pardon me, in the time of
[42:16] Rome after her virgin
[42:19] birth. I think she was a virginborn
[42:23] church at
[42:26] Pentecost. She was given to Christ at
[42:29] Pentecost. And what did she do? She
[42:31] crossed herself with Roman
[42:36] dogma. And the Protestant church has
[42:39] done the very same thing. She
[42:43] can't wait.
[42:46] She can't wait. So then, what do you
[42:49] think that we are going to be tried by
[42:52] in this last day?
[42:55] What are we going to be tried by? The
[42:58] very same thing.
[43:01] Will we be able to wait for God's
[43:04] promise to come to pass exactly the way
[43:07] he
[43:08] says or will we not be
[43:11] tempted to
[43:13] manufacture something that will look so
[43:17] close it would deceive the very elected
[43:21] if it were
[43:23] possible. How are we going to know the
[43:25] difference, brother Donnie? It's easy.
[43:27] We take it back to the word. The
[43:29] original will always agree with the word
[43:32] of God for the hour. Is that right? How
[43:35] many like to be remembered tonight as we
[43:37] pray? Certainly want
[43:40] to remember all those that are sick. U
[43:43] brother Michael Carter doing really
[43:46] poorly without the Lord moving for our
[43:48] brother. He'll be going home before
[43:50] long. We know it's in God's hands and
[43:52] certainly want to just remember him and
[43:54] the family as well. Also, brother Steve
[43:56] Newsome really had a rough day today.
[43:59] So, be mindful of him. My granddaughter
[44:02] Ashley had to go to the doctor today
[44:03] sick. Courtney had to go later this
[44:05] afternoon sick. So, a lot of things are
[44:08] going on, but our God's still a healer.
[44:10] Amen. Let's take it to him right now.
[44:13] Father, as we stand before you tonight,
[44:15] we are in a in a wonderful time to be
[44:18] believers. We're a blessed people to be
[44:22] able to see the time, the age, the sign,
[44:25] the manifestation of what you told us
[44:27] would come in the last days. We count it
[44:30] a great honor and a privilege, Father,
[44:32] that we could be partakers first of all
[44:35] of the divine nature. Then by the divine
[44:38] nature it illuminates our soul. Helps us
[44:41] to wear that it gives us the ability the
[44:44] spiritual frequency if I can say it that
[44:47] way to hear the voice of the angel as
[44:51] it's
[44:52] calling from the waters. So father I
[44:56] pray that you would help us in this day
[44:58] that we're living. We know the angel of
[45:01] God has been sent out in the last time
[45:05] and he's calling a bride to the well. So
[45:09] Lord God, we thank you that we've been
[45:12] given an ear to hear that. Now the
[45:14] question is after hearing, what will we
[45:17] do? Will we wait? Will we believe? Will
[45:20] we trust? Father, we alone can answer
[45:23] that. But that's our desire. I pray that
[45:26] you'd help us tonight. All the sick, the
[45:28] afflicted. Lord God, but you move for
[45:30] the needs of your people. We pray in the
[45:32] name of Jesus. Amen. God bless you. You
[45:35] may be
[45:37] seated. What a terrible
[45:41] thing. So a a man is engaged
[45:45] to a woman.
[45:48] her
[45:49] body, her
[45:52] vows, her
[45:55] purity as is
[45:58] promised to a
[46:00] man. And the man with all faithfulness
[46:03] and trust and
[46:06] confidence believes that that woman will
[46:09] keep that
[46:11] vow and that he alone will be able to
[46:15] obtain all of those things which she
[46:18] will forfeit willingly to her husband.
[46:24] But when he comes to
[46:26] her, he finds that her body has already
[46:31] been
[46:33] trespassed and his vows which was made
[46:37] to her has already been stepped across
[46:41] not only by the man but by the woman as
[46:45] well.
[46:46] Now, as awful as that sounds, yeah,
[46:50] that's exactly what took place in the
[46:53] Garden of Eden. That's exactly what took
[46:56] place in the book of
[46:58] Jeremiah, in the book of Ezekiel, in the
[47:01] book of
[47:02] Hosea, also in the book of Acts. We find
[47:06] it over and over again that God has
[47:12] betrothed a generation, a
[47:15] nationality, a a certain class of people
[47:19] to
[47:21] himself. They exchanged their vows. Will
[47:24] you be true to me? I will. Well, I I'll
[47:26] be true to you. I pledge to you my
[47:30] trust. I betro myself unto you. I am
[47:35] yours and yours alone. And then God
[47:38] would come to them for a furtherance of
[47:42] his
[47:43] revelation. And he found them with
[47:46] child and they were producing of another
[47:51] seed line which was God not God's own
[47:55] nature. Now that pattern has been true
[48:00] since the Garden of Eden. But I don't
[48:02] know about you tonight. It ain't going
[48:04] to be true with me. No. Anybody else?
[48:08] Now watch and go on with this where we
[48:10] are. He says, "A woman engaged to a
[48:13] fine, young, clean
[48:17] man. And before they come together,
[48:21] what's she done? She's found
[48:24] pregnant by someone else. Not
[48:28] something, not a thing, right? Not an
[48:32] object, not a piece of furniture, not a
[48:36] material, something. Someone, yeah,
[48:41] someone. She's found pregnant by someone
[48:44] else. Then her own seed, which is
[48:49] betrothed, her own body, which is
[48:53] betrothed to her boyfriend. Now remember
[48:56] this is what God told Israel by the
[49:00] prophet in the Old Testament that I will
[49:02] betro thee unto me
[49:06] forever and you will no longer call me
[49:09] Bail.
[49:12] So they were calling God of an
[49:15] associated name to Baal.
[49:19] He'll no longer call me that.
[49:23] Oh my. Just another one of the
[49:26] gods. Our Jesus is not just another one
[49:30] of the gods.
[49:32] He's the only one.
[49:37] Oh
[49:38] my. Her body which is betrothed to her
[49:42] boyfriend, her engaged husband. Now
[49:46] remember, betrothed, engaged, but not
[49:50] yet known her as a wife. Before Adam
[49:54] ever knew Eve in the Garden of Eden as
[49:58] his wife, she was found with seed of
[50:03] another being.
[50:06] Amen.
[50:08] Now notice he said, "What a
[50:11] disgrace." That's exactly what Adam
[50:14] found. That's what
[50:17] Christ, excuse me, has found.
[50:22] couldn't wait.
[50:24] That's what's the matter with the people
[50:26] today. They can't wait for the real Holy
[50:29] Spirit to take the
[50:32] church in position
[50:35] right
[50:38] now. Listen what they
[50:39] do. They've got to manufacture
[50:44] something.
[50:46] Work
[50:47] up something.
[50:50] initial
[50:52] evidence speaking in
[50:54] tongues to get more members in the
[50:57] church.
[50:59] All this kind of Tommy rot.
[51:04] Wow. Same prophet of God warned us about
[51:07] being delicate speaking about the Holy
[51:09] Ghost that we didn't blasphe. And yet he
[51:11] would take it in this way and call it
[51:14] Tommy rot.
[51:17] Well, come on, somebody say amen. or at
[51:18] least wave your hand or something so I
[51:20] know you're with me,
[51:23] sir. All this kind of Tommy rot instead
[51:26] of waiting upon the Lord for the real
[51:30] manifestation of the resurrection of
[51:32] Christ making himself known among the
[51:38] people. She can't
[51:40] wait. So what did she do?
[51:43] She went out and become
[51:47] pregnantated with denominationalism.
[51:52] Oh my
[51:53] goodness. First was the assemblies of
[51:57] God. Then come the oneness. Then what
[51:59] more after that? Now the socalled bride
[52:04] is pregnantated.
[52:08] And now you know as well as I do, a lot
[52:09] of the denominational people in the
[52:11] denominational churches don't even refer
[52:14] to themsel as bride.
[52:17] So this must be a category of people
[52:20] that are actually calling themsel bride.
[52:25] But they're soalled. Yeah.
[52:29] Is pregnant with all kinds of tummy
[52:33] rot disgrace. He says, "The women won't
[52:37] pay a bit more attention to what God's
[52:39] word says. Nothing in the world. Neither
[52:43] will the men." Bring her on down,
[52:45] Brother Brandham. Or even the preachers.
[52:49] Now, what's sad was he was preaching
[52:51] against the Pentecostals and all the
[52:54] denominations at that time. Now, the
[52:56] same thing has come right around in the
[52:58] ranks of our
[52:59] message. You show them what the prophet
[53:02] said, show them what the Bible said.
[53:03] Women pay no attention to it. men pay no
[53:05] attention to it. And even some of our
[53:08] message preachers won't pay a bit more
[53:10] attention to it than the man on the
[53:12] moon.
[53:14] Well, preach, brother Donnie.
[53:18] What is it? She's pregnantated.
[53:22] Christ bride
[53:27] has become
[53:29] pregnant with the world.
[53:33] Dressing like the world acting like the
[53:38] world big churches fine what it shows
[53:42] what she is.
[53:45] She's of the devil.
[53:48] That's what Satan done at the first
[53:50] place was to try to build a big
[53:52] beautiful kingdom in heaven and was
[53:55] kicked out for it. Excommunicated from
[53:58] heaven. That's what Christ's modern
[54:01] bride is. Kicked
[54:04] out because she's exccommunicated from
[54:08] God. Because she's a
[54:12] Yes. Amen. And not a virgin. Amen.
[54:17] I know this is plain talk, but it's easy
[54:20] understood.
[54:22] Anybody having any problem understanding
[54:24] what's been said tonight?
[54:26] Now, notice he said it's deep,
[54:31] but I hope you get
[54:35] it.
[54:36] Now, let's
[54:39] switch. We're going to go back to the
[54:43] land of Mesopotamia.
[54:47] And then we'll journey over to
[54:51] Padan
[54:55] Haram. It is another
[54:58] type of
[55:01] God. The setting is a man by the
[55:05] name of
[55:08] Abraham. His wife has now been
[55:12] dead about three years.
[55:16] He
[55:18] is 140 years
[55:22] old. He has a
[55:24] 40 year old
[55:26] son whose name is
[55:29] Isaac and he's not married.
[55:34] So
[55:36] Abraham feels that the time is
[55:40] right for his
[55:42] son to have a wife. So he waits three
[55:46] years now after Sarah died. Now, we can
[55:49] tell by the way this chapter 24 leads on
[55:54] on in to chapter 25 in the book of
[55:56] Genesis that that Isaac really really
[56:00] loved his
[56:01] mother and he was greatly affected by
[56:05] the death of his mother. And
[56:08] apparently he was not quite ready to get
[56:12] married at the age of 40 and being able
[56:16] to
[56:17] properly
[56:19] receive a wife and love her in the right
[56:22] way. Now 40 years old some of you guys
[56:25] think dear God there ain't no hope no
[56:26] mercy for me at all. But now I want you
[56:29] to notice this now that in this is the
[56:32] very despiction of God
[56:35] himself in this type. So Abraham 140
[56:40] years old he's 137 whenever Sarah died.
[56:43] So he's lived by himself now or him and
[56:46] him and Isaac. And then he goes and
[56:47] marries the other woman coutura. and
[56:49] he's still under this tutoring of trying
[56:54] to raise Isaac and form him in this
[56:58] avenue. So now the time has arrived for
[57:03] him to get a bride. Now, we'll contrast
[57:07] this with leading up to the part about
[57:10] the bride will face the challenge of
[57:15] being a
[57:17] or a
[57:19] virgin. Look at what lays before every
[57:22] one of us here tonight and every person
[57:25] that will hear
[57:27] this. Before you and I
[57:30] lays two
[57:32] paths. the
[57:34] virgin or a
[57:37] prostitute. We present our body to God,
[57:41] a chasteed
[57:43] virgin or we come and stand before God
[57:46] at the judgment as a polluted
[57:51] church, which is where the majority of
[57:53] them will
[57:54] stand. Now, let's read if you would in
[57:56] in Genesis chap 24:1.
[58:00] Now remember,
[58:01] Isaac does not go on this
[58:05] mission. So Abraham is going to send his
[58:11] eldest servant to be able to secure
[58:16] Isaac a bride. But Abraham doesn't go
[58:20] and Isaac doesn't go. Right? So now, how
[58:24] is this going to be determined?
[58:28] There will be a divine
[58:31] presence that will go with the
[58:37] messenger and there will be a
[58:39] reciprocating part of that
[58:42] that the bride will answer to. Oh yeah,
[58:46] the same angel of God.
[58:51] Now watch. Abraham was old and well
[58:54] stricken in age. And the Lord had
[58:57] blessed
[58:58] Abraham in all things. And Abraham said
[59:02] unto his eldest servant of his
[59:08] house that ruled over all that he had.
[59:13] Put I praise thee thy hand under my
[59:19] right thigh. Now I know this seems odd
[59:22] and peculiar to us but this is uh the
[59:25] most sacred vow that could be taken
[59:29] under this time frame. So he beckons
[59:32] this servant and this servant is over
[59:35] everything that he has and he has a a a
[59:38] great wealth. Now it shows us that
[59:42] Isaac has not yet come into his
[59:48] princehood for Isaac is not over it yet.
[59:52] Now
[59:53] listen, Isaac is still
[59:56] under Amen. He's still under the
[1:00:02] dispensation of sunship.
[1:00:06] So, he's not yet moved into the full
[1:00:10] inheritance. Glory. Amen. Now, I know
[1:00:14] I'm running ahead of you and I'm trying
[1:00:15] to hold back and uh from this point on,
[1:00:18] I'm not responsible for the way I act or
[1:00:21] for if I get out out of been out of
[1:00:24] shape.
[1:00:26] So, now in the type
[1:00:29] Abraham is a type of God.
[1:00:34] Isaac is a type of Jesus
[1:00:39] Christ, the eldest servant whose name is
[1:00:44] not even mentioned in Genesis 24.
[1:00:49] He is a type of a servant that would be
[1:00:53] sent in the last day to get a bride. Oh
[1:00:59] and
[1:01:00] Rebecca, I
[1:01:02] hope is a type of you
[1:01:06] and me. Yes, sir.
[1:01:09] So now watch this as it un unfolds to
[1:01:14] us. Put I praise thee thy hand under my
[1:01:19] side. Now remember this man is a servant
[1:01:24] but he has everything at his
[1:01:27] charge to be able to take whatever he
[1:01:31] deems necessary. I want you to notice
[1:01:33] that Abraham doesn't even tell him what
[1:01:37] to take. So he doesn't say take so many
[1:01:40] rings, so much gold, so much silver, so
[1:01:43] many camels, so much this that and the
[1:01:45] other. but he leaves it at the
[1:01:48] discretion of the
[1:01:50] servant. So he makes him
[1:01:53] swear. I love the adjectives that
[1:01:57] brother Brandham uses to describe this
[1:02:00] servant. If you haven't listened to
[1:02:02] these two sermons that Brother Brandham
[1:02:04] preached called the time of decision,
[1:02:06] one of them was in Los Angeles in 1959
[1:02:09] and the other's in Chicago 1959. And he
[1:02:13] said, "God's looking for men today that
[1:02:16] will move when the spirit moves anywhere
[1:02:20] that he may send." That's a model
[1:02:25] servant. Not only that, but when he got
[1:02:29] to his place where his
[1:02:33] messages was to be given, notice this,
[1:02:37] he never
[1:02:39] boasted on himself.
[1:02:42] He never spoke about how great he was or
[1:02:48] how great his
[1:02:50] meetings was.
[1:02:53] Now
[1:02:54] listen, the model servant is not the
[1:02:58] type of man that goes around and talks
[1:03:02] about how great he is and of everything
[1:03:06] that he sees and everything that he
[1:03:08] does. I prayed for this person. and I
[1:03:11] prayed for that person. God showed me
[1:03:13] this. God showed me that. God showed me
[1:03:16] that. That's contrary to what brother
[1:03:19] Brandham said. Amen. Okay. Now, I'm
[1:03:22] going to ask you, which are you going to
[1:03:24] take? The seed of God by the message of
[1:03:28] the hour, or are you going to allow your
[1:03:31] body to be betrothed by men?
[1:03:36] Say, whoa, wait a minute, brother
[1:03:37] Donnie. We we're giving testimony. I
[1:03:40] wonder to whom the testimony is all
[1:03:42] about by the time some guys get through.
[1:03:45] I don't mind telling you. I've sat and
[1:03:46] heard some preachers talk and they
[1:03:48] talked about themselves more cuz I sat
[1:03:50] there and counted the eyes and the mind
[1:03:53] and the me
[1:03:55] in comparison to the Lord, the Lord God
[1:03:58] and the Lord Jesus. And I wound up in
[1:04:01] more eyes and more me and more my and
[1:04:04] more mine. You ain't going to convince
[1:04:06] me. That's a testimony about the Lord
[1:04:08] Jesus. Amen. Well, hallelujah. I don't
[1:04:11] know about you, I come to have church
[1:04:13] tonight.
[1:04:16] Now, watch. He never boasted on himself.
[1:04:19] He never spoke about how great he was or
[1:04:23] how great his meetings was or how great
[1:04:27] anything about himself.
[1:04:30] He wasn't a boaster or proud, but he
[1:04:35] only
[1:04:37] spoke of his
[1:04:39] master and of his master's wealth. I'll
[1:04:43] show you how important that this servant
[1:04:46] was in Genesis
[1:04:49] 24. His name is not even mentioned.
[1:04:55] So, how do we know this man? by his
[1:04:58] office, not by his human name. What a
[1:05:02] way to be known. This is a model
[1:05:05] servant. Now, the man that wants to
[1:05:08] build his ministry, build his church, or
[1:05:10] if he's an evangelist, you know, running
[1:05:12] around here, there, there, I preach so
[1:05:14] many, you know, this and that and the
[1:05:15] other, then you realize he's got the
[1:05:18] wrong example that he's looking at. But
[1:05:21] this is a model servant. Now, what is a
[1:05:26] model servant? It's one that every other
[1:05:29] servant ought to want to be like.
[1:05:33] And the Word of Life Church said,
[1:05:37] now watch, he wasn't a boaster or proud.
[1:05:40] He only spoke of his master and all of
[1:05:44] his master's
[1:05:47] wealth and that his master had a son and
[1:05:52] he was going to fall heir to everything.
[1:05:54] So you can see why that this servant
[1:05:58] didn't really have time to talk about
[1:06:01] himself that much because he was talking
[1:06:04] about his master, how great his master
[1:06:07] was and how wonderful his master was.
[1:06:10] And then when he wasn't talking about
[1:06:12] his master, he was talking about his
[1:06:14] master's son and talking about how great
[1:06:16] he was. I would to God some of our
[1:06:18] preachers would learn the key to that.
[1:06:20] Amen.
[1:06:23] What a beautiful picture of a
[1:06:27] real
[1:06:29] servant of
[1:06:34] God. His whole
[1:06:38] attention is on the master.
[1:06:43] Why shouldn't it
[1:06:45] be? Notice telling the people not about
[1:06:49] himself but about the master and about
[1:06:52] the son and he's going to fall heir to
[1:06:54] all things. He was so much time talking
[1:06:57] about the master and the son. He has no
[1:07:01] time to boast on himself or his great
[1:07:07] regime
[1:07:13] or his
[1:07:14] denomination or some affiliation that he
[1:07:17] has. It's all on the master.
[1:07:23] Praise the Lord. How many wants to hear
[1:07:25] that kind of preacher? Me too. Now,
[1:07:28] Brother Brandham said
[1:07:29] this. Was he talking scripture?
[1:07:34] Come on.
[1:07:36] Brother make this up.
[1:07:40] Well, I've got the answer here. You're
[1:07:42] sitting there dumbfounded with a look on
[1:07:43] your face. No, he wasn't making it up.
[1:07:47] Let's read about it. Genesis
[1:07:50] 24:12. And he said,"Lord
[1:07:54] God of my master
[1:07:57] Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed
[1:08:00] this day and show
[1:08:04] kindness unto my master Abraham."
[1:08:08] Verse 14. Let it come to pass that the
[1:08:11] damsel of whom I shall say, let down thy
[1:08:14] picture, I pray thee, that I may drink,
[1:08:17] and she shall say, drink, and I will
[1:08:19] give thy camels drink also. Let the same
[1:08:22] be she that thou hast appointed for thy
[1:08:25] servant Isaac, and thereby shall I know
[1:08:29] that thou hast showed kindness unto my
[1:08:33] master. Verse 27. And he said, "Blessed
[1:08:37] be the Lord God of my master Abraham,
[1:08:43] who hath not left destitute my master of
[1:08:48] his mercy and his truth. I being in the
[1:08:52] way. The Lord led me to the house of my
[1:08:56] master's brethren."
[1:08:59] Look at his focus. It was not about him.
[1:09:03] It was not about all his gifts and his
[1:09:06] great authority and how much trust the
[1:09:09] master had in him. His whole mission was
[1:09:13] to complete what the master sent him to
[1:09:16] do.
[1:09:19] Oh, praise the Lord. Verse 35. And the
[1:09:22] Lord hath blessed my master greatly, and
[1:09:27] he has become great, and he hath given
[1:09:30] him flocks. Notice who he's bragging on.
[1:09:33] My master is great. My master's got
[1:09:37] this. My master's got that. Where is he
[1:09:40] bragging about himself? I've done this.
[1:09:42] I've done that. I prayed for that
[1:09:44] person. I I a real godly preacher can
[1:09:48] stand up and testify about somebody else
[1:09:51] that prayed for somebody else other than
[1:09:53] themsel and they still give praise and
[1:09:56] glory to God. Why? That's a model
[1:09:59] servant.
[1:10:01] Oh my. Notice in verse 36, "And Sarah,
[1:10:06] my master's wife, bear a son to my
[1:10:09] master." Man, this guy is hung up, ain't
[1:10:12] he? This guy is hung up on this master.
[1:10:16] Do you know why? He loved his master. He
[1:10:21] was not there to get a bride for
[1:10:23] himself. He was not there to get a
[1:10:26] following for himself. He's a man on a
[1:10:30] mission. And what a mission he had.
[1:10:36] Verse 37. And my
[1:10:38] master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt
[1:10:42] not take a wife to my son of the
[1:10:44] daughters of the Canaanites in whose
[1:10:46] land I dwell. Verse 39. And I said unto
[1:10:50] my
[1:10:52] master. Verse 42. And I came this day
[1:10:55] unto the well and said, "Oh Lord God of
[1:10:59] my master
[1:11:02] Abraham." Verse 48. And I bowed down my
[1:11:05] head and worshiped the Lord and blessed
[1:11:08] the Lord God of my master Abraham which
[1:11:12] had led me in the right way to take my
[1:11:15] master's brother's
[1:11:18] daughter. Verse 49. And now if you will
[1:11:21] deal kindly and truly with my
[1:11:25] master. God give us preachers like this.
[1:11:30] Hallelujah. Not only preachers but
[1:11:33] leoty, deacons, trustees, songwriters, s
[1:11:37] musicians. Oh, it ain't about who can
[1:11:40] sing the greatest and who's the best of
[1:11:42] this and that. It's those that can say
[1:11:44] it's all about the master. It ain't
[1:11:47] about us and who gets the biggest hand
[1:11:49] clap and who gets requested to be sung
[1:11:51] the most. It's about the master.
[1:11:57] Verse 54. And they did eat and drink.
[1:12:00] And he and the men that was with him and
[1:12:02] terried all night, and they rose up in
[1:12:04] the morning, and he said, "Send me
[1:12:08] away unto my master."
[1:12:12] God help me to be that kind of
[1:12:17] earth. And he said unto them, hinder me
[1:12:19] not, saying the Lord hath prospered my
[1:12:23] way. Send me away that I may go and
[1:12:27] start a new
[1:12:29] denomination to my master.
[1:12:35] 19
[1:12:37] times in these
[1:12:40] verses. Verse 65, for she said unto the
[1:12:43] servant, "What man is this that walketh
[1:12:45] in the field to meet
[1:12:47] us now at the end of his
[1:12:50] journey?" And the servant said, "It is
[1:12:54] my
[1:12:57] master." Therefore, she took a veil and
[1:13:00] covered
[1:13:02] herself. So when he brings her back,
[1:13:05] notice now when Isaac walks out into the
[1:13:08] field, it's
[1:13:10] transferred, the master, the son has now
[1:13:14] become the master of the house.
[1:13:18] And he looks at him and she says, "Who's
[1:13:20] that?" And he said, "It's my master."
[1:13:27] Glory to
[1:13:29] God.
[1:13:30] Abraham through this
[1:13:35] servant obtained a brideg
[1:13:39] Rebecca for his
[1:13:42] son
[1:13:44] Isaac. Listen to that again. Abraham
[1:13:48] through this
[1:13:50] servant obtained a
[1:13:53] bride for Isaac.
[1:13:57] No matter how many other women might
[1:13:59] have wanted to be Isaac's bride, and no
[1:14:01] doubt a lot of them would
[1:14:03] have, but you could only be that bride
[1:14:07] if you followed this messenger back to
[1:14:10] the master's house.
[1:14:14] And you had to say certain
[1:14:16] things the way he said them.
[1:14:20] Amen. You couldn't add live them. You
[1:14:24] couldn't say, "Well, I'm not sure that
[1:14:25] applies." That's just that's just a
[1:14:27] random tabernacle only type thing. You
[1:14:29] know, you had to say what he said. Well,
[1:14:33] glory. Now notice in verse three, for I
[1:14:37] will make thee swear by the Lord. This
[1:14:41] is Abraham now speaking to
[1:14:43] Eleazar. The Lord the God of heaven and
[1:14:47] the God of the earth. Thou shalt not
[1:14:50] take a wife unto my
[1:14:53] son of the daughters of the
[1:14:57] Canaanites among whom I
[1:15:02] dwell. Now what what's wrong with
[1:15:06] that? Looks like to me it saved a lot of
[1:15:09] work.
[1:15:10] and a lot of
[1:15:12] effort. Several weeks to get over there
[1:15:17] and back. Several hundred
[1:15:21] miles. There's going to be robbers.
[1:15:24] Plunderers are on the way. It's going to
[1:15:27] be a dangerous journey.
[1:15:30] Why not just take one of the local
[1:15:34] women, the
[1:15:37] Canaanites, just take one of them and
[1:15:39] maybe lead her to the message.
[1:15:44] Oh my.
[1:15:46] Amen. Oh my.
[1:15:48] But you see, many believers have tried
[1:15:51] to do such in mixed marriages. It's
[1:15:54] forbidden in the word of God, friends.
[1:15:58] Now watch, watch what he gives him. Oh
[1:16:02] my. It would have been
[1:16:05] against the design of
[1:16:09] God to marry the promised seed
[1:16:14] son to a
[1:16:16] cursed woman.
[1:16:21] Don't you see the Canaanites were cursed
[1:16:24] by God himself? He said, "I will drive
[1:16:27] them out of the land and I will give
[1:16:29] that land to you all. Their days are
[1:16:33] numbered."
[1:16:35] Don't you see the denominational
[1:16:37] systems? They're cursed. While sure, God
[1:16:40] can take people out of there, but God is
[1:16:43] not sending his message into those
[1:16:47] systems to let them remain there, but to
[1:16:50] call them out. Why? It would be marrying
[1:16:54] the promised son with the promised seed
[1:16:57] word to a woman that is cursed to death.
[1:17:01] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:17:07] Amen.
[1:17:10] Hallelujah. Now notice in verse four.
[1:17:16] But thou shalt
[1:17:18] go
[1:17:20] unto my
[1:17:23] country and to my
[1:17:29] kindred and take a wife
[1:17:32] unto my
[1:17:34] son Isaac.
[1:17:38] So I want you to
[1:17:40] go to my
[1:17:44] country and my
[1:17:47] kindred, my people, people that I'm kin
[1:17:51] to. Amen. And they're kin to
[1:17:54] me. Now the prophet said, "Did you
[1:17:57] notice the bride and Eleazar found
[1:17:59] Rebecca in the evening time and the sign
[1:18:04] was
[1:18:05] performed in the evening time and that's
[1:18:08] the time we're living. I trust that you
[1:18:10] get this. It was in the evening time
[1:18:12] when Rebecca came out led by the
[1:18:15] spirit." Glory. Do you believe that? How
[1:18:19] otherwise would she have come? There
[1:18:21] might have been many before her, but she
[1:18:25] was led by the spirit in the evening
[1:18:28] time. And Eleazar, the messenger, the
[1:18:32] minister, the true servant to his
[1:18:36] master, was led in the evening time.
[1:18:39] Wonder why that Rebecca came before any
[1:18:42] of the other girls? Do you know that
[1:18:44] Rebecca and Isaac
[1:18:47] were blood relation?
[1:18:52] Oh, glory to God. And the blood of
[1:18:55] Jesus, oh my, the bride of Jesus
[1:18:58] Christ is blood relation to him. A
[1:19:04] bloodbought bride.
[1:19:07] That's why signing your name on a church
[1:19:08] book, that won't do it. Joining a
[1:19:10] church, even trying to come here to this
[1:19:12] church, that won't do it. You've got to
[1:19:15] be blood relation.
[1:19:17] Oh, that's the true baptism of the Holy
[1:19:19] Ghost. When God breaks the blood cell
[1:19:21] over your soul, then that makes you and
[1:19:24] him of the same family. Amen.
[1:19:30] He goes on to say, "The life is in the
[1:19:32] blood, and the life is in the church."
[1:19:35] The Christian that's born again by the
[1:19:36] spirit of God, that's the spirit of
[1:19:40] life, blood relation
[1:19:43] to Christ. the spirit of Christ and the
[1:19:47] blood of Christ leading a child of
[1:19:50] Christ, the seed of Abraham.
[1:19:54] So why did Rebecca make that sudden
[1:19:57] move? Why did she go to the waters of
[1:20:00] life so
[1:20:02] quickly? Why could the angel speak to
[1:20:06] her?
[1:20:09] because she was blood
[1:20:11] relation to Isaac
[1:20:14] and that's who the
[1:20:17] angel can speak to tonight
[1:20:21] is a blood relationship. Let me tell you
[1:20:22] something friend. If you only come to
[1:20:24] this message because somebody gave you a
[1:20:25] book or you heard a tape or you was
[1:20:27] convinced that it might have been right,
[1:20:29] somebody will talk you out of it. But if
[1:20:31] the angel of God opened your eyes and
[1:20:34] led you to this word, there ain't enough
[1:20:36] devils in hell to run you away from it.
[1:20:38] Your mistakes, your failures, the
[1:20:40] failures of others, it won't run you
[1:20:42] away from it. Why? The same angel of God
[1:20:46] that led Rebecca is the same angel of
[1:20:49] God that's around the world today
[1:20:52] speaking to a bride. Come to the waters
[1:20:55] of life, bride. Come.
[1:21:03] The bride of Jesus Christ is sanctified
[1:21:06] through the blood of
[1:21:07] Christ and an open vessel for the Holy
[1:21:10] Spirit to speak
[1:21:12] in. No wonder she'll come to the waters
[1:21:15] of
[1:21:16] life. Hela went forth to find a bride
[1:21:20] for Isaac and he found the beautiful
[1:21:23] Rebecca. In the cool of the evening, a
[1:21:25] little dark skinned girl come out with a
[1:21:27] water pot on. El eer prayed and said,
[1:21:31] "Lord God, give me good journey now and
[1:21:33] success from my master Abraham." And he
[1:21:36] said, "Don't go take him amongst the
[1:21:39] Philistines. Get over here amongst his
[1:21:42] people, showing that the bride of Christ
[1:21:44] and Christ is blood relation." Because
[1:21:47] Rebecca and Isaac were
[1:21:50] cousins. I'm going to go ahead and say
[1:21:52] it. You and Jesus
[1:21:58] are brother and sister.
[1:22:01] Hallelujah.
[1:22:02] Hallelujah.
[1:22:05] Amen. Chew on that a while devil.
[1:22:09] Oh, you say I'm oh sorry sinner. Not if
[1:22:12] you're born again. You're not. You have
[1:22:15] been made blood relation to the Lord
[1:22:17] Jesus
[1:22:19] Christ. You're not a sinner. You're not
[1:22:21] a vile, wretched, nothing, no sir, not
[1:22:24] any longer.
[1:22:32] And the servant said unto
[1:22:35] him, per adventure, the woman will not
[1:22:38] leave the denomination
[1:22:44] and will not be willing to follow me
[1:22:46] into the message land.
[1:22:51] You see, that's what the prophet tells
[1:22:53] us after the opening of the seals that
[1:22:55] we have come into a new land. The
[1:22:58] message of the day.
[1:23:01] These folks trying to find all kinds of
[1:23:03] faults in the message and trying to pull
[1:23:05] us away from it. Ain't no way I'll cut
[1:23:07] your head off. You uncircumcised
[1:23:10] Philistine. You ain't to get me out of
[1:23:11] this land. Come on, somebody. This is my
[1:23:14] inheritance. This is our land. In here
[1:23:18] I've got life. In here, hallelujah, is
[1:23:21] the resurrection. There is no
[1:23:24] resurrection in a denominational
[1:23:26] prostitute.
[1:23:28] [Applause]
[1:23:34] And the servant said unto him, per
[1:23:39] adventure, the woman will not be willing
[1:23:41] to follow
[1:23:43] me into this land. Must I needs bring
[1:23:48] thy
[1:23:49] son again unto the land from whence thou
[1:23:52] camest? So, so if she don't come out, do
[1:23:54] you want me then to take
[1:23:57] Jesus into the denominations in
[1:24:04] let them be claimed as bride?
[1:24:12] John saw who they were.
[1:24:15] Many of them that bloodwashed multitude
[1:24:17] in the book of Revelation. Who are
[1:24:18] these? These are they who come out of
[1:24:20] great tribulation.
[1:24:22] Why? They wasn't fully purged.
[1:24:25] Why? They deny the manifestation of the
[1:24:28] fullness of the word of God to wash him
[1:24:30] clean.
[1:24:33] So if the woman won't leave, then then
[1:24:36] should I take him out? I I you know, I'm
[1:24:40] just I don't know. This sounds like a
[1:24:41] whole lot to me. Uh, I'm supposed to go
[1:24:43] down all these hundreds of miles and
[1:24:45] this woman's just going to leave her
[1:24:47] home, her family, the structure of her
[1:24:49] whole life. And you honestly think she's
[1:24:52] going to follow me back.
[1:24:56] Abraham said, "Yeah, she
[1:24:58] will." But but eventually she
[1:25:03] won't. Oh my. It's very likely now her
[1:25:09] daddy was an arch deacon there. Her
[1:25:11] grandpa was a pastor in the association
[1:25:14] and great great grandpa founded that
[1:25:16] organization. Come on.
[1:25:20] But
[1:25:21] Eleazar, I'll send the angel of the
[1:25:25] Lord about 30
[1:25:28] minutes before you get there.
[1:25:32] Amen.
[1:25:34] There'll be no problem in leaving mama.
[1:25:38] There'll be no problem in leaving the
[1:25:40] arch deacon. There'll be no problem in
[1:25:42] leaving the pew. Even though they may
[1:25:44] have a gold plate on there with her name
[1:25:46] all over it, she will leave
[1:25:50] the angel.
[1:25:54] Hallelujah.
[1:25:56] Amen.
[1:26:03] So
[1:26:04] Haran is in the northeast of
[1:26:08] Mesopotamia or Padan
[1:26:11] Haram on the river of
[1:26:13] Beis, a trade center from Nineveh to
[1:26:19] Caramesh, the chief
[1:26:21] seat of the worship of the moon god.
[1:26:27] S I N
[1:26:31] sin.
[1:26:40] So Rebecca was called out of moon god
[1:26:43] worship. Amen. Called out of sin.
[1:26:52] Woo!
[1:26:54] 6 over
[1:26:57] 600
[1:27:00] miles. We're not talking about a 737
[1:27:05] Supermax. We're not talking about a
[1:27:08] rocket. We're talking about on the back
[1:27:12] of a camel.
[1:27:15] 1200 mile over 1,200 mile round trip
[1:27:24] for
[1:27:25] what a bride.
[1:27:29] But let me give you a journey that's
[1:27:30] even further than that.
[1:27:33] Way beyond the horizontal rainbow where
[1:27:36] the angels of God alone have walked in
[1:27:38] that great premise of the Almighty. Yes,
[1:27:40] sir. He stepped aside and laid aside all
[1:27:43] of his glory and come down to the earth
[1:27:45] and said, "I'll make a journey even
[1:27:47] farther than that. I'll come down and
[1:27:50] pay the price for my bride cuz she is in
[1:27:53] mine. She is in my mind, but she's got
[1:27:57] to be kin to me." Ken is only in your
[1:28:00] head. And when you're in the mind stage,
[1:28:03] but God said, "I've got to become kin to
[1:28:05] her so she can become kin to me. I'll
[1:28:08] become a man. Hallelujah. I'll become a
[1:28:12] man so I can burst her back into deity.
[1:28:24] Amen. The camels are very
[1:28:28] strong. They can carry up to 900
[1:28:33] lb for an average about 30 miles a day.
[1:28:38] 25 to 30
[1:28:40] miles. So, if it had taken between three
[1:28:43] and four
[1:28:46] weeks to make this
[1:28:49] journey, now you've got 10 camels loaded
[1:28:53] down with gifts.
[1:29:04] Now, watch. Abraham said unto him,
[1:29:09] "Beware that thou bring not my
[1:29:13] son there again. Don't you take this
[1:29:17] sign to them
[1:29:20] systems. It ain't for them, right? Don't
[1:29:24] you take my son into their Don't you
[1:29:28] understand why these denominational
[1:29:29] preachers what they're guilty of?
[1:29:31] They're preaching to their people that
[1:29:33] they're bride and yet sewing their own
[1:29:35] seed in them or denominational headship.
[1:29:38] God will judge them for that very thing.
[1:29:42] And this is a serious charge. And verse
[1:29:45] 10, and the servant took 10
[1:29:49] camels of the
[1:29:51] camels of his
[1:29:53] master. Here he comes back to this
[1:29:56] master thing again. Why everything come
[1:29:59] from his master?
[1:30:01] So if a man can preach on myself a
[1:30:03] building on fire, where would that gift
[1:30:05] come from? The master. A man can sing,
[1:30:08] where'd it come from? The master. A man
[1:30:10] can lay hands on the sick and have great
[1:30:12] faith, where'd it come from? The master.
[1:30:19] And the servant took 10
[1:30:21] camels. Now you imagine each one of them
[1:30:24] camels could carry up to 900 pounds of
[1:30:27] stuff.
[1:30:30] And it wasn't stuff from Big Lots. It
[1:30:33] wasn't made in China on the bottom of
[1:30:35] none of it, which wouldn't even make it
[1:30:37] across the desert. Way some of your
[1:30:39] stuff don't make it across in them
[1:30:40] shipping
[1:30:42] containers. Well, out of time it gets
[1:30:44] here. He's got gold, silver, purple,
[1:30:49] blue, all kinds of gifts.
[1:30:53] Now remember, this man was not by
[1:30:55] himself.
[1:31:01] He had men that were with him. Yes. But
[1:31:06] he was the main spokesman.
[1:31:09] Now you imagine when they camp at night
[1:31:12] and there were some of them evangelist
[1:31:14] or maybe some of them teachers or
[1:31:16] whatever more that's watching guard
[1:31:18] around what was going on. Remember this
[1:31:20] is you talking about a caravan of
[1:31:23] wealth. And you see, this is one way
[1:31:27] that this bride can have
[1:31:30] confidence in this man's
[1:31:32] message by the wealth of gifts that he
[1:31:37] has when he comes.
[1:31:41] He won't be like your extraordinary
[1:31:43] evangelist. He won't be just like
[1:31:46] another or Roberts or whatever more. But
[1:31:48] this Eleer is going to be gifted above
[1:31:53] his brothers.
[1:31:55] Now you imagine if a guy rolled in there
[1:31:57] and a little old donkey had a backpack
[1:31:59] on the back about that big and said, "I
[1:32:01] I I've got a rich master way over
[1:32:03] yonder." And I'm telling you what, he
[1:32:05] sent me over here and she look said,
[1:32:06] "Are you kidding me? You're a poor
[1:32:09] representation of that. Don't you
[1:32:11] understand why our nation will be
[1:32:12] judged? Every healing, every miracle,
[1:32:15] every sign, every discernment that was
[1:32:18] performed by the spirit of God through
[1:32:20] our prophet will be a notice of judgment
[1:32:23] to those who reject it. Amen.
[1:32:30] And the servant took 10 camels of the
[1:32:34] camels of his
[1:32:35] master and departed for
[1:32:40] all the goods of his
[1:32:45] master were in his hand.
[1:32:50] And he
[1:32:51] arose and went to
[1:32:55] Mesopotamia unto the
[1:32:57] city of
[1:33:00] Nahor.
[1:33:02] Huh?
[1:33:04] Nahor. Wonder who that might be. The
[1:33:07] city of Nahor.
[1:33:10] Now he's taking, of course, these camels
[1:33:13] for provision for
[1:33:15] himself, but much of it is going to be
[1:33:19] gifts for the
[1:33:23] bride. And also the
[1:33:27] group that the bride is called out of,
[1:33:31] they'll receive a few benefits just
[1:33:33] because she's there with them. Well,
[1:33:35] praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Y'all
[1:33:38] remember her brother's name, don't you?
[1:33:41] Laban. Oh, Jacob knew him well. He
[1:33:43] become his
[1:33:45] daddy-in-law. Oh, yeah. You can watch
[1:33:47] old Laban as the dollar signs go to
[1:33:49] rolling in his eyes when he goes to see
[1:33:51] him earrings and them bracelets on her
[1:33:53] hand. And Laban said, "Oh, blessed be
[1:33:56] the man of the Lord. Come on in. Come on
[1:33:58] in." Old Laban's still around, ain't he?
[1:34:01] Yeah. So, he come with gifts. But you
[1:34:03] know what? the the family she come out
[1:34:06] of and the move that she was called out
[1:34:10] of received the benefit from this
[1:34:13] messenger simply because Rebecca had
[1:34:16] been there among them. Well, glory to
[1:34:19] God. Hallelujah. Oh, I'll tell you one
[1:34:21] thing. Your family may look at you and
[1:34:23] say, "You brought such shame and
[1:34:25] embarrassment to us cuz you're following
[1:34:27] that man. And what in the world are you
[1:34:29] doing to all Everybody in Johnson City
[1:34:31] knows that you belong to a cult and that
[1:34:34] ain't nothing but a man worshiping
[1:34:35] church. We don't worship no man here. We
[1:34:38] worship our God who become a man. But we
[1:34:41] praise no man but the Lord Jesus. He is
[1:34:45] our redeemer. He is our God.
[1:34:52] But you see this
[1:34:54] messenger at his
[1:34:57] discretion is given control over certain
[1:35:00] elements of these gifts. Now he knows
[1:35:03] he's representing his
[1:35:06] representation is very
[1:35:09] important. So if he goes it's a measly
[1:35:12] little something that woman ain't going
[1:35:14] to be convinced.
[1:35:16] But the gifts he has must testify of the
[1:35:22] magnificence of his master.
[1:35:26] So instead of just laying hands on the
[1:35:28] people and coming through the prayer,
[1:35:29] praise the Lord. Praise the
[1:35:31] Lord. It would be like I heard
[1:35:35] yesterday. Oh, I
[1:35:37] see. I see you're from you're not from
[1:35:41] Chicago. You're from
[1:35:43] Planefield. Your name is so and so. Oh,
[1:35:46] that's your sister sitting there by you.
[1:35:48] She's got ear problem and got head and
[1:35:50] got this and that and the other.
[1:35:53] Yes. So, what was that? Testifying of
[1:35:56] the magnificence of his master, not of
[1:35:59] the messenger himself. Come on now,
[1:36:01] church. It was testifying of the
[1:36:04] magnificence of the master.
[1:36:10] It displayed the rank and the worthiness
[1:36:15] not of the
[1:36:16] man but of the master.
[1:36:25] Where has my time gone?
[1:36:32] Now
[1:36:33] watch. We jump from verse 10 to verse
[1:36:36] 11. And he made his
[1:36:39] camels to kneel down without the
[1:36:43] city by a well of
[1:36:46] water at the
[1:36:49] time of the
[1:36:52] evening. Even the time that the
[1:36:56] churches go out hungering for revival
[1:37:02] to draw
[1:37:04] water. I love the way the prophet goes
[1:37:07] in this direction. Eleaser found Rebecca
[1:37:10] in the evening time and the sign was
[1:37:14] performed in the evening time. That's
[1:37:16] the time we're living in. I trust you.
[1:37:18] Get this. It was the evening time when
[1:37:20] Rebecca came out led by the
[1:37:23] spirit. And he said, "Oh Lord God of my
[1:37:27] master Abraham, I pray
[1:37:29] thee, send me good speed this day. Show
[1:37:33] kindness unto my master
[1:37:37] Abraham. Now he leaves the success of
[1:37:40] this whole
[1:37:41] mission to Jehovah
[1:37:44] God. Behold, I stand here by the
[1:37:49] well of water and the daughters of the
[1:37:52] men of the
[1:37:54] city come out to draw water.
[1:37:59] And let it come to
[1:38:02] pass. Watch it now. Let it come to pass.
[1:38:10] speaking something with a future
[1:38:12] fulfillment.
[1:38:14] Let it come to
[1:38:17] pass that the damsel to whom I shall
[1:38:23] say, let down thy picture, I pray
[1:38:27] thee, that I may drink, and she shall
[1:38:34] say. You're a cult. I've got to Google
[1:38:38] you. I've got to check you on YouTube.
[1:38:44] Now, won't you listen at the
[1:38:46] identification of this woman who's going
[1:38:48] to get Isaac as her
[1:38:51] husband? She's going to say
[1:38:54] exactly what the messenger said.
[1:38:57] Yeah. So, it wasn't a jumbled up mixture
[1:39:00] of uh well, I feel led and I I think and
[1:39:02] and this is my opinion and uh and I
[1:39:05] don't think we no longer need that and
[1:39:06] and this is another day and no right off
[1:39:10] that ain't
[1:39:11] her. Now, watch how particular he is. I
[1:39:14] praise thee that I may drink and she
[1:39:17] shall
[1:39:19] say
[1:39:21] drink and I will give thy camels drink
[1:39:24] also.
[1:39:26] Let the same be she that thou hast
[1:39:31] appointed for thy servant Isaac. And
[1:39:33] thereby shall I know that thou has
[1:39:36] showed kindness not unto
[1:39:39] me but unto
[1:39:42] my
[1:39:47] master. You see what he's looking
[1:39:49] for is a sign of response.
[1:39:55] He's watching her. Can you imagine this
[1:39:58] man's whole reputation, his honor, his
[1:40:02] integrity is on this. Oh, would any of
[1:40:05] us want to be able to pick somebody
[1:40:07] else's wife? Good gracious. Some of us
[1:40:10] brothers know what it's like picking her
[1:40:11] own sweating bullets. Oh, God, don't let
[1:40:13] me mess up. Don't let me mess up. Not
[1:40:15] only that, she's praying the same way
[1:40:17] about you before she agreed to you.
[1:40:21] So, you're going to take this woman and
[1:40:23] you're going to take her back and Isaac
[1:40:26] is going to marry her at your choice.
[1:40:32] But this man had really been taught
[1:40:34] good, hadn't he? Yes, sir. An angel had
[1:40:37] come to him and gave him a commission.
[1:40:40] You see?
[1:40:44] Glory to God. Glory to God.
[1:40:48] So he must watch what she says, how she
[1:40:51] behaves. So the way he's framing it is
[1:40:54] he wants to see her
[1:40:56] nature. He wants to see her character.
[1:41:00] Can she
[1:41:01] serve? Or is she, you know, just lie
[1:41:04] type thing, sit around and, you know,
[1:41:05] just do her fingernails and her toenails
[1:41:07] and all that sort of thing. And she's
[1:41:09] got to be babyed and got to be pampered
[1:41:10] and all that sort of thing. But watch
[1:41:12] what he does. He pulls
[1:41:15] servitude into an identification which
[1:41:18] will be a trait that he'll
[1:41:21] know she's a
[1:41:25] bride. Praise God.
[1:41:28] Hallelujah.
[1:41:30] Good
[1:41:32] disposition,
[1:41:34] sanctified,
[1:41:36] useful, not just
[1:41:40] decoration.
[1:41:42] Verse 15. And it came to pass. Yes, sir.
[1:41:50] Hallelujah.
[1:41:54] Before, Lord
[1:41:57] God, before he had
[1:42:01] done
[1:42:06] speaking, he hadn't even finished it.
[1:42:14] Behold,
[1:42:16] Rebecca came
[1:42:20] out. Well, well,
[1:42:23] well,
[1:42:25] Rebecca. Rebecca means
[1:42:28] this
[1:42:30] cord with a
[1:42:33] noose. In other words, a rope made with
[1:42:37] like a lasso on the end of it. accord
[1:42:41] with a
[1:42:45] noose. You see, she was so
[1:42:48] beautiful and such a damsel of great
[1:42:52] beauty and
[1:42:53] attraction that they named her
[1:42:56] accord with a
[1:43:00] noose that when men will look upon
[1:43:03] her, they will be captivated.
[1:43:11] Oh, don't you see? That's what we don't
[1:43:14] see about
[1:43:16] ourselves. It's that part of himself
[1:43:18] that he placed at
[1:43:20] us that captured
[1:43:25] him. It captured
[1:43:28] Jesus. Oh, didn't he say in Song of
[1:43:30] Solomon, "Turn your eyes away from me.
[1:43:32] Turn your face away from me. Even one of
[1:43:35] your eyes has captured
[1:43:39] me. Just one of your eyes captured me.
[1:43:42] You put a noose
[1:43:44] bride on my
[1:43:48] heart. You last on
[1:43:51] me. You called me from
[1:43:54] eternity into time.
[1:43:57] You made me go to the cross. You
[1:44:06] I'd like to preach to you sometime on
[1:44:09] for the love of a
[1:44:14] woman. Hallelujah.
[1:44:24] Thank you, Lord. And it came to pass
[1:44:26] before he had done
[1:44:29] speaking that behold Rebecca came
[1:44:32] up who was born to
[1:44:36] Bethuuel son of
[1:44:38] Mila
[1:44:40] wife of
[1:44:42] Nahor. Anybody know who he
[1:44:45] is?
[1:44:47] Abraham's brother.
[1:45:02] Hallelujah. With her
[1:45:05] picture upon her shoulder. Now, it was
[1:45:08] not a picture of herself. Ah, first
[1:45:11] selfie in the Bible. I'm so
[1:45:13] beautiful. Man, man. Man, my
[1:45:16] heartbreaker. It was a big picture that
[1:45:18] would haul about five gallons of water.
[1:45:21] Yeah.
[1:45:23] labor, works, not
[1:45:31] idleness. I love
[1:45:33] this. It was in the evening time when he
[1:45:36] came to the well near the
[1:45:38] city. And it was about that time that
[1:45:42] Rebecca had to make a decision.
[1:45:46] I believe the
[1:45:48] angel of the Lord beat him there about a
[1:45:53] half an
[1:45:55] hour for he will send his angels before
[1:45:59] you. Then he makes the way clear. It
[1:46:03] must have been the angel of
[1:46:07] God that spoke to Rebecca's heart and
[1:46:11] said, "Go get the water. Amen.
[1:46:17] The day that God was pulling on your
[1:46:19] jean seed, the angel of God must have
[1:46:22] said to you, "Go get ready and go to
[1:46:25] church." You said, "I don't want to go
[1:46:27] to church." You said, "I said, go get
[1:46:29] ready and go to
[1:46:31] church." And what' you do? You went to
[1:46:33] church and you found the well of living
[1:46:36] waters. Not a church, not a preacher,
[1:46:39] but Jesus. Amen. Hallelujah. And Rebecca
[1:46:44] came to the water of life at the evening
[1:46:47] time. You get the picture. It's the
[1:46:49] church in the last days. Evening time.
[1:46:52] The evening lights are here. It's the
[1:46:54] time that the angel of the
[1:46:57] Lord in a supernatural is revealing
[1:47:01] himself
[1:47:04] to the Rebecca,
[1:47:08] the bride of Isaac.
[1:47:12] The evening time has come.
[1:47:16] The angel of the
[1:47:18] Lord's in the message.
[1:47:22] This is why you ain't getting this
[1:47:23] message from me. You all want to sell
[1:47:26] it. You want to get rid of it. Go ahead.
[1:47:28] If that's what you want to do, you ain't
[1:47:30] taking this message from me. You get
[1:47:32] tired of hearing me preach it. That's
[1:47:34] your problem. That ain't mine. I Oh, I
[1:47:36] love this message now more than I've
[1:47:38] ever loved it in my life. I ain't sick
[1:47:41] of it. I ain't tired of it. I ain't
[1:47:43] looking for a new version. I don't just
[1:47:45] hear the voice of a Kentucky. I hear the
[1:47:48] voice of the spirit of God anointing
[1:47:50] that man for this
[1:47:52] hour. The angel of the Lord's possessive
[1:47:57] in this message
[1:48:02] and it goes forth and woos
[1:48:07] the
[1:48:14] Rebecca Elizer started praying. Oh Lord
[1:48:18] God, let something supernatural
[1:48:22] happen. Oh my, you sent your angel
[1:48:24] before me. Now let him do
[1:48:27] something. I know he's gone before me.
[1:48:29] And let the one the young woman that
[1:48:32] comes and gives me a drink out of the
[1:48:34] picture also will water the camels
[1:48:36] without
[1:48:37] asking. Let that be she the one. And he
[1:48:41] no more than said Rebecca came. God's
[1:48:44] right on the dot or in your situation
[1:48:47] right on the
[1:48:49] spot. Hallelujah. No more than your
[1:48:52] heart goes out to hunger and thirsting
[1:48:54] for God, some kind of Holy Ghost revival
[1:48:57] will break out somewhere. Something will
[1:49:00] glory to God, a neighbor will get healed
[1:49:04] and somebody will tell you about it.
[1:49:05] Something will take place to let you see
[1:49:08] the angel of the Lord is a movement.
[1:49:16] Rebecca, Rachel,
[1:49:20] Zapora, all met their
[1:49:24] husbands at the
[1:49:27] well of
[1:49:31] water.
[1:49:33] Hallelujah. And the woman at the well
[1:49:36] met her true husband at the well of
[1:49:39] water.
[1:49:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And I'll tell
[1:49:44] you one thing, you might as well
[1:49:46] recognize that that's where you met your
[1:49:49] husband. Not at some denominational
[1:49:52] system, but the well of living water.
[1:49:55] [Music]
[1:49:59] Amen.
[1:50:02] They all found their husbands. Isn't
[1:50:04] that awesome?
[1:50:09] Verse 16. And the damsel was very fair
[1:50:13] to look
[1:50:14] upon, a virgin, neither had any man
[1:50:16] known her. And she went, listen,
[1:50:21] [Music]
[1:50:26] down to the well and filled her
[1:50:30] picture and came up. Right?
[1:50:34] She was beautiful corded with a noose. I
[1:50:39] quoted this to you in the Song of
[1:50:41] Solomon chapter 6 verse 5. Turn away
[1:50:43] thine eyes from me for they have
[1:50:46] overcome
[1:50:48] me. Thy hairs as a flock of goats that
[1:50:53] appear in Gilead. You see, beauty is a
[1:50:56] characteristic of his real bride. So
[1:50:58] it's fitting that the mother of the
[1:51:00] church should be called as
[1:51:03] beautiful. You see, it was a simple
[1:51:07] matter. Not a stranger would ask her for
[1:51:10] water. But it was a
[1:51:12] lifechanging question.
[1:51:16] He didn't tell her now, "Oh, if you only
[1:51:18] knew what way did you you do what I tell
[1:51:20] you to do?" Oh,
[1:51:22] no. You can't judge her character by
[1:51:24] giving her the answer.
[1:51:27] You ask her the question and then see
[1:51:30] how she answers from her
[1:51:36] heart. Her destiny depended on this
[1:51:40] answer.
[1:51:42] Can I have a few more minutes? You see,
[1:51:45] little things are often the most
[1:51:49] reliable to really reflect the truest
[1:51:53] points of our character.
[1:51:57] We think great big old thing. Oh my, we
[1:51:59] always want to do this big big big step.
[1:52:01] But I was looking at it yesterday and
[1:52:04] the prophet said it this way. It's the
[1:52:05] little things sometimes that we leave
[1:52:09] undone that means so much to
[1:52:13] us. We get in such a hurry to race over
[1:52:16] things in this neurotic age that we live
[1:52:18] in. Again, he says, "I wonder tonight in
[1:52:20] radio land in the visible audience that
[1:52:22] many of you aren't thinking on your ways
[1:52:24] and the things that you have done and
[1:52:26] the things you've left
[1:52:29] undone, it's just as great to leave
[1:52:33] undone as it is to do something wrong."
[1:52:36] That's right.
[1:52:38] So, you mean when we leave something
[1:52:40] undone, read our Bible, pray, give a
[1:52:43] nice word, be tender-hearted, on and on
[1:52:45] and on and on we can go. would just
[1:52:47] simply leave it undone. Your prophet
[1:52:50] said, "It's as great to leave it undone.
[1:52:53] Is it absolutely to do a wrong or a
[1:52:55] sin?"
[1:52:57] Just things we leave undone.
[1:53:00] We're always wanting to do something
[1:53:02] big. Maybe we wasn't ordained to do
[1:53:05] something big. Maybe it's the little
[1:53:07] things that we're leaving
[1:53:11] undone. It's what's hurting us.
[1:53:14] But watch her. Her response prompt,
[1:53:18] quick,
[1:53:20] cordial. And the servant ran to meet her
[1:53:23] and
[1:53:24] said, "Let me, I pray thee, drink a
[1:53:29] little water of thy
[1:53:30] picture." And she said,
[1:53:33] "Drink, my
[1:53:37] Lord." And she hasted and let down the
[1:53:41] picture upon her hand. Now she would
[1:53:43] have taken it down from her shoulder and
[1:53:45] set it down upon her hand to tip it
[1:53:49] over. Now watch. And gave him
[1:53:54] drink. So far so good.
[1:53:59] And when she had done giving him drink,
[1:54:01] she said,
[1:54:04] "I will draw water for the Holy Ghost
[1:54:09] and I'll start praising and watering and
[1:54:14] worshiping."
[1:54:18] That's what prophet said that the camels
[1:54:20] was type of the Holy Ghost. So whenever
[1:54:22] you're here in church and every day you
[1:54:24] live your life, you're giving water to
[1:54:26] the camel that's going to pack you home
[1:54:28] and your body change.
[1:54:31] So if you give him about a tenth of a
[1:54:32] tank, does that mean you only get 300t
[1:54:34] off the ground?
[1:54:37] I want mine to have plenty of fuel. What
[1:54:39] about you all? Amen.
[1:54:42] So watch, she uses the same
[1:54:46] language, the same words in the order
[1:54:50] that he said
[1:54:55] [Laughter]
[1:54:58] them. And she hasted and emptied her
[1:55:02] picture in the
[1:55:06] trough.
[1:55:07] And Amen.
[1:55:12] Ran again unto the well to draw
[1:55:16] water and
[1:55:18] drew for all his
[1:55:23] camels. A camel whenever it's thirsty
[1:55:26] can
[1:55:27] drink between 30 and 40
[1:55:34] gallons. Let's just go on the low side.
[1:55:37] 30 gallons times 10
[1:55:40] camels is
[1:55:43] 300 gallons of
[1:55:51] water. Assuming that Rebecca was a kind
[1:55:54] of a tough person, she could probably
[1:55:56] have at least packed five gallon, which
[1:55:59] would have been about the size of the
[1:56:00] large
[1:56:01] picture, which weighs 8.3 lb per gallon.
[1:56:05] depends on the density of the air and
[1:56:08] couple of different things can affect
[1:56:09] it. Can have a few variables to it, but
[1:56:11] we'll say 8 pounds a gallon,
[1:56:14] say 40
[1:56:16] pounds per
[1:56:19] trip. Now, she hauls five
[1:56:24] gallons. That means she makes 60 trips
[1:56:30] to the
[1:56:31] well. Now, she didn't take a garden hose
[1:56:34] like I did out here before church and
[1:56:36] hook it up on the outside of my office
[1:56:38] and run it out there to water some
[1:56:39] flowers that I set out yesterday and
[1:56:41] just stand up.
[1:56:47] Now, in this time frame, their whales
[1:56:49] were not surface wells. They would have
[1:56:52] to dig down in the ground. So, they
[1:56:54] would actually dig steps down into the
[1:56:57] ground. So, she would have had to go
[1:56:58] down into the ground. The Bible said
[1:57:01] down to the well.
[1:57:03] So she would have had to went down in
[1:57:05] the ground. Let her pitch her down. Get
[1:57:08] down on her knees. Let her pitch her
[1:57:10] down. Get up. Pull it up on her
[1:57:13] shoulder. 35 to 40 lbs. Go back up the
[1:57:17] steps. Empty it back down. Back and
[1:57:21] forth. Back and forth. Back and forth.
[1:57:24] You get the picture.
[1:57:29] Now, why in the
[1:57:31] world did not this
[1:57:34] man and his
[1:57:36] servants help that poor woman
[1:57:40] pack that water?
[1:57:46] Why don't the Lord come to our rescue as
[1:57:49] soon as we're sick? Why don't the Lord
[1:57:52] stop all death for his children?
[1:57:56] Why would Jesus tell Mary and Martha
[1:57:58] whenever he's fixing to raise their
[1:58:00] brother from the dead? But yet he tells
[1:58:03] them two women, "Yes, sir. You roll the
[1:58:06] stone away."
[1:58:08] There stood them brrawy fisherman, big
[1:58:10] broad shouldered outfit standing there.
[1:58:12] You imagine them looking, Lord, this
[1:58:14] ain't even courteous. Leave them alone.
[1:58:16] Don't you do it, Peter. Don't you move
[1:58:18] it. Sometimes when you're praying and
[1:58:21] waiting and you say, "Lord, where are
[1:58:22] you? Lord, what's going on?" He's
[1:58:24] watching your character under duress.
[1:58:27] He's watching your temperament. He's
[1:58:29] watching all of that. What do you do?
[1:58:30] Make another trip and another. You
[1:58:32] imagine she is sweating worse than I am
[1:58:34] tonight. And that heat down there back
[1:58:37] and forth. Her legs might have been a
[1:58:38] cramping and she'd gone back and forth.
[1:58:40] She didn't know who she's fixing to be.
[1:58:44] She had no promise. This man is simply a
[1:58:48] stranger. It wasn't like it's a great
[1:58:50] message preacher. It was a great prophet
[1:58:53] of God. She had no idea who this man
[1:58:55] was.
[1:58:57] Let's stand.
[1:59:06] Wonderful.
[1:59:13] So she would have looked at all them
[1:59:15] camels 30 60 90
[1:59:21] 120. Oh I don't I don't feel
[1:59:25] led. One second thought I'm feeling led
[1:59:27] to go
[1:59:31] home. But you see this is what's
[1:59:33] testifying to this
[1:59:35] messenger. This is bride type right
[1:59:38] here.
[1:59:41] cuz she'll cry and she'll pray. She'll
[1:59:44] put forth every effort. And sometimes
[1:59:46] I'll put the answer on
[1:59:49] delay or sometimes, as I said on Sunday,
[1:59:52] he may even say
[1:59:55] no. And we still keep going up down them
[1:59:58] steps.
[2:00:00] We keep getting that buckets of water. I
[2:00:02] love you, Lord Jesus. I love you.
[2:00:07] Don't you ever forget it. As long as you
[2:00:10] live, if Satan can stop you from going
[2:00:13] to the well to water your
[2:00:15] camels, he stole a great deal of your
[2:00:18] victory.
[2:00:22] Bringing it up to the messenger, it
[2:00:23] wasn't that
[2:00:24] bad. But trip after trip after trip
[2:00:27] after trip for the man, for Isaac, for
[2:00:31] Abraham, for
[2:00:34] camels, for camels. He's saying, "But
[2:00:39] brother Donnie, I'm tired and I've
[2:00:40] worked today. My hands just don't want
[2:00:42] to go up and and all that." But
[2:00:44] remember, you're watering the very thing
[2:00:46] that's going to change you after a
[2:00:47] while.
[2:00:52] Praise God.
[2:00:55] I can just see her standing there
[2:00:56] looking at it. 30 60 90 120 15 80 Let's
[2:01:01] do her. Yep. Let's do her. I don't even
[2:01:04] know who this man is. I don't have a
[2:01:06] clue this man. He might be a renegade.
[2:01:08] He might be a robber. I don't know what
[2:01:09] I'm even doing this for, but all she
[2:01:10] knew was she heard a voice. She heard a
[2:01:13] voice. You've got a meeting down at the
[2:01:16] well. And she just kept, "Oh, glory to
[2:01:18] God. I don't know what this meeting is,
[2:01:19] but it must be something." It was
[2:01:21] something. All right.
[2:01:24] Sing it for us. Hallelujah.
[2:01:30] [Music]
[2:01:32] It was a day in early spring town. Glory
[2:01:37] by an ancient wayside well. Wayside.
[2:01:41] Eleaser paused to rest his camel. Camel
[2:01:46] tree.
[2:01:48] He had found a bride for Isaac. Thank
[2:01:52] you, Lord. air. The evening shadows
[2:01:55] fall for his weary journey had not had
[2:02:01] in vain.
[2:02:05] So he take he took the fair back dressed
[2:02:09] in jewels rich and
[2:02:12] rare quickly to her waiting bridegroom
[2:02:17] far away. Pick it up a little
[2:02:19] bit. Where Rebecca loved her rising and
[2:02:25] he loved Rebecca fair. Oh, it must have
[2:02:30] been a happy wedding
[2:02:34] day.
[2:02:37] Oh, get
[2:02:39] ready. The evening shadows fall.
[2:02:44] Don't you hear the elies are call?
[2:02:48] Aren't you glad you heard him? There's
[2:02:51] already been a wedding. Greater joys
[2:02:55] will soon
[2:02:58] begin. In the evening when the trial
[2:03:02] train comes in once
[2:03:05] again. Oh, get
[2:03:08] ready. The evening shadows fall.
[2:03:13] Oh, don't you hear the eleer
[2:03:18] call. Thank God there's already been a
[2:03:22] wedding and greater joy will soon
[2:03:26] begin in the evening when the camel
[2:03:30] train comes
[2:03:33] in. Now our blessed holy
[2:03:37] father sent a prophet from above. He
[2:03:42] came down to earth to find an elected
[2:03:46] bride. Well, glory to God for our Isaac
[2:03:50] over yonder has prepared our tents of
[2:03:55] love and he wants his
[2:03:58] fair by his side course. Now
[2:04:03] everybody,
[2:04:04] oh get ready.
[2:04:08] Evening shadows
[2:04:10] fall. Don't you hear the Have you heard
[2:04:14] it? How many's heard at ease are called?
[2:04:18] Thank you, Lord God. There's already
[2:04:20] been a wedding. An invisible union's
[2:04:22] going
[2:04:24] on in the evening time when the camel
[2:04:28] train comes
[2:04:31] in. Let's do the last verse real slow.
[2:04:34] Now our blessed holy
[2:04:37] father sent a prophet from
[2:04:41] above. He came down to earth with a sign
[2:04:45] in his hand to find an elected
[2:04:50] bride. For our Isaac over
[2:04:55] yonder has prepared his tents of love.
[2:05:00] Whichever one of you's got a promise.
[2:05:03] The tent will be your new body.
[2:05:09] You've got a tent waiting. Glory to God.
[2:05:12] I feel like talking in tongues.
[2:05:13] Hallelujah. He's prepared your tents.
[2:05:18] Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. For our Isaac
[2:05:22] over
[2:05:24] yonder has prepared his tents of love.
[2:05:29] And he wants his

[2:06:35] train
[2:06:38] rose. We've left our kin folk
[2:06:42] gladly. We've b the world goodbye.
[2:06:47] [Music]
[2:06:48] We've been called to
[2:06:50] be his pure and
[2:06:53] spotless
[2:06:55] brother. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you,
[2:06:58] Jesus. Well, we'll soon
[2:07:01] behold our
[2:07:03] Jesus in that blessed
[2:07:07] eternity. What a
[2:07:10] happy, happy
[2:07:12] time that's going to be. Let's sing that
[2:07:17] once
[2:07:18] again. Well, we've left our canvol
[2:07:22] gladly. We've paid the world
[2:07:27] goodbye. We've been called to be his
[2:07:30] pure and spotless
[2:07:34] bride.
[2:07:35] Amen. Where we'll soon behold our Jesus.
[2:07:40] Thank you, Lord. In that blessed
[2:07:43] eternity.
[2:07:46] What a
[2:07:47] happy happy
[2:07:49] time that's going to
[2:07:54] be. I'm singing.
[2:07:59] Everybody will be

[2:08:46] sing
[2:08:51] over. Oh, praise the
[2:08:55] Lord. Praise the
[2:08:58] Lord.
[2:09:01] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:09:05] that I could still go free.
[2:09:10] Maybe she thought her little life would
[2:09:11] be a life that would never amount to
[2:09:14] much. And that secluded part of the
[2:09:17] world just in a simple way of going down
[2:09:20] to the well and drawing water and
[2:09:22] watering the sheep and taking care of
[2:09:24] the garden. Little did she know that God
[2:09:27] had her ordained to be the queen.
[2:09:32] Hallelujah.
[2:09:34] To be married to Isaac.
[2:09:38] Some of you probably thought you
[2:09:39] wouldn't live to be 20 or
[2:09:41] 30, maybe even 40. It never amount to
[2:09:44] nothing. Well, maybe that's true in the
[2:09:46] natural. But you're called to be married
[2:09:50] to the
[2:09:52] Almighty. Hallelujah.
[2:09:55] You can
[2:09:56] lock me
[2:09:59] up in a
[2:10:03] prison.
[2:10:06] Oh, and
[2:10:07] [Music]
[2:10:10] throw
[2:10:13] away the key.
[2:10:19] You can
[2:10:21] take
[2:10:23] away my
[2:10:27] [Music]
[2:10:29] vision from these
[2:10:32] eyes that
[2:10:35] now now can see.
[2:10:42] You
[2:10:44] proud me
[2:10:46] of the very
[2:10:49] food I
[2:10:52] need and
[2:10:54] even Oh,
[2:10:57] hallelujah. I know my
[2:11:01] hands and feet.
[2:11:04] But as
[2:11:06] long as
[2:11:09] I I know
[2:11:15] Jesus, then
[2:11:18] I could still Oh, let's sing it together
[2:11:21] now, saints. Praise the Lord. Oh, he
[2:11:27] said that
[2:11:29] I could
[2:11:31] still go free.
[2:11:36] Praise
[2:11:37] God. What
[2:11:40] kind of a
[2:11:43] man or sing it to
[2:11:50] [Music]
[2:11:52] him? Oh, water that Holy Spirit tonight.
[2:11:56] Now water it. Give him praise.
[2:12:01] [Music]
[2:12:02] So
[2:12:04] unworthy to
[2:12:07] live, glory, not
[2:12:10] fit to kill.
[2:12:14] But the man
[2:12:15] on the
[2:12:18] cross had my name written
[2:12:21] under those
[2:12:23] seals and said that
[2:12:26] I I could
[2:12:30] steal. Oh, glory to
[2:12:33] God.
[2:12:35] Oh, I
[2:12:38] never could.
[2:12:43] quite
[2:12:44] [Music]
[2:12:46] understand why a great
[2:12:49] king would want to
[2:12:52] leave heaven's
[2:12:58] throne and put
[2:13:01] on the
[2:13:03] ro of an
[2:13:07] earthly
[2:13:10] man feel
[2:13:12] Flame of
[2:13:15] flesh and
[2:13:20] bone. And to
[2:13:23] lead her
[2:13:25] tr up that
[2:13:29] lonely
[2:13:32] path that
[2:13:34] led to Calary.
[2:13:40] Let's build it up now, brothers. Oh,
[2:13:44] where that
[2:13:46] blood
[2:13:48] shame and broke
[2:13:51] all your
[2:13:53] chain. Hallelujah.
[2:13:56] Hallelujah. And said that you could go
[2:14:01] free. Let's water the Holy Spirit now.
[2:14:05] He
[2:14:05] said that I could
[2:14:09] still go
[2:14:12] free. Oh, come on, Rebecca. Let's make
[2:14:17] our eyes to Lord
[2:14:19] Jesus. What kind of a
[2:14:22] man would reach down that nail scarred
[2:14:26] hand and do this for me?
[2:14:37] Even
[2:14:40] so
[2:14:43] unworthy to
