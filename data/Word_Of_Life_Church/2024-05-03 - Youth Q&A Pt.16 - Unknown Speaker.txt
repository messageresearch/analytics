make me sensitive I pray Lord we love you Jesus we worship you with all of our hearts bless us together we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord a't it awesome for us to be able to be gathered together again tonight in the presence of the Lord there's one thing about questions that I've found over the years they can be very very interesting and very scary especially if you're the guy standing up here trying to answer them but I've learned something many many years ago being asked questions I've had different youth U meetings in different parts of the world and um I found that if I will always approach a question in the right way sometimes I've been asked questions and I could tell by the attitude of the person that was writing it that their attitude wasn't quite right but the Lord helped me to see many many years ago if I will approach it the right way whether or not people ask it in the right way he'll still help me with it and I've never seen that fail and I'm so grateful for that so let's uh start with this question tonight good question a couple different people asked this one but worded it a little bit different if Jesus turned water into wine why can't we drink it now let me just give you the short answer of that and then uh a whole bunch of scriptures and a whole bunch of History afterwards I'll answer it again we can drink the same kind of wine that Jesus made but it's probably not the kind you're thinking about you can be seated turn with me to Genesis chapter 9 verse 20 now this is the first time that the Bible before we go into St John which is the one that tells about the wedding at Canaan and where Jesus turned the water into wine let's uh look a little bit first about what the Old Testament Tau about wine about liquor about drinking and then we'll come up to where Jesus did this miracle and I believe if we look at it from that perspective you'll probably see the answer before I ever even give it to you Genesis 9: 20 and Noah began to be an husbandman and he planted a Vineyard and he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered within his tent now remember this is after what we talked about last night the flood when God had destroyed the majority of humanity and most of the living creatures which is upon the Earth the Bible doesn't say that no did this before the flood but after the flood which I find unusual it's hard to believe that he didn't know something about this but yet what was it that drove him to this after the flood so he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered within his tent and ham the father of Canaan saw the nakedness of his father now Noah must have been pretty drunk like a lot of drunk people they do very foolish and stupid stuff depending on how drunk they are so there's something about people who get drunk when they get intoxicated that they're out of their mind and yet it can give them a Brazen boldness that they wouldn't have without it believe it or not I've prayed for many people over the years in church that were drinking I've had people come up to the Altar and their breath so strong on alcohol I would have to turn my face away from them as they were telling me what they wanted prayer for because they were so drunk and yet I know that some people whenever they get drunk they want to go to church which sounds crazy to us right you think in your mind why would they ever want to do that so it Alters those who do such and we can see now remember Noah was a prophet and the spirit of God had led him in this great thing that he had just accomplished and then afterwards he becomes a husbandman plants a Vineyard and then he drinks of it and what does Noah do of all the crazy things he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered within his tent and ham the father of kingan I remember he had three sons ham sham and and jpus and then notice how Moses when he goes to correlating this about ham and ham the father of Canaan saw the nakedness of his father so here ham comes near the tent door and he sees the condition of his daddy and he saw the nakedness of his father and told his two Brethren without and shim and japi took a garment now notice the difference between these two boys and laid it upon both their shoulders and went backward so they take a piece of a garment on one on one side one on the other and they wrap it around thems and they walk this way until they're near their father and then they drop the Garment back on their father to cover their father's nakedness now what caused this drinking it was not whiskey it was not rum it was not vodka it was nothing like people would drink today but it was from the vine straight from the vine in the liquor State now he must have drunk quite a bit of this because on average from the Old Testament to the New Testament wine only had between five to 7% alcohol so it was nothing like what people drink today so he would have had had to drunk a lot of it to get like this now notice so they walked backward and they dropped this on their father and their faces were backward and they saw not their father's nakedness now what a terrible thing for Noah to do and the mercy of God has just been extended to him and they come out of the flood and then Noah gets drunk and Noah awoke from his wine now remember not whiskey not vodka not any of this strong stuff today but just from wine and knew what his younger son had done unto him now this this verse 25 is a very strange and odd verse and he said cursed be Canaan why Canan never done this Canan wasn't even there do you understand the land that the children of Israel is going to inherit many many many centuries after this was called the land of Canaan it's named after Ham's son and Canaan wasn't even there he wasn't even the one that did that isn't it unusual that God would attribute now look how important it is what we do and how it can affect our children how it can be handed down from one generation to another and he said cursed be Canaan a servant of servants shall he be unto his Brethren so here is our first instance now in the Bible of someone drinking enough wine this stage of wine to become intoxicated it causes them to take off at least a portion of their clothes causes them to become in in a state that they should have never been in and look what it brought upon ham and what it also brought upon his son Canaan now also if you'd like to write this down and I'll have these up on the screen for you in Genesis 19: 30-38 lot was so drunk he did not know what he was doing and this led to his immorality with his two daughters this is after Lot's wife was killed and they thought all the Earth so they said had been destroyed and an hour ated and there ain't nobody to bring seed to our father so the oldest got her father drunk and and laid with him that night the younger got her father drunk the next night laid with him the next night and out of there comes the seed of Ammon and the seed of the moabites so again we find a man that was drinking now keep this in mind whenever we ask the question about Jesus turning water into wine watch the pattern that we want to lead up to this Leviticus 10: 9-11 God commanded the priest not to dram so that they could tell the difference between the holy and the Unholy so apparently drinking intoxicated drink Alters the Judgment of those who drink it so that they can no longer distinguish between the holy and the Unholy holy it does something to their senses okay now you all know I've never drunk in my life I've never drunk the only thing I've ever drunks communion wine and that's only a little tiny cup full so I don't know anything about it as far as my experience but I've dealt with enough people to know what it can do so God says for the priest not to drink it because it would affect their ability to discern between holy and Unholy Numbers Chapter 6:3 the nazarites were told to eat or drink nothing from the grape vine now think of that not to even eat from something from the grape vine now if you notice if you know this or not but the Bible neither the Old Testament or the new actually uses the words grape juice you will not find that in the Bible grape juice but God deals with vinegar from the grape and God also deals with the grape the that which comes forth from it but not the words grape juice now remember that grape juice Deuteronomy chap 21: 20 a drunken son was considered to be stubborn and rebellious Deuteronomy 29 5-6 God gave no grape juice which is the first stage of grape that was squeezed out to Israel nor did they have intoxicating drink in the wilderness now remember God's providing everything they need so if God felt like that it was okay to be able to give intoxicate and drink then God surely would have given it to the children of Israel because they were sad they were down they were depressed they were weary so if God was okay was getting a little bit of intoxication God should have just created a whole big bunch of it out there and let them drink it and when it would have made everybody feel better at least till in the morning and then of course they would had a major headache Deuteronomy 32:33 intoxicating wine is like the poison of serpents and the cruel Venom of asps now an asp was a poisonous snake now we're laying a big big foundation here this is what the Bible says that intoxicating wine is and what it will do judges 13:4 also verse 7 also verse 14 Samson was to be a Nazarite for Life his mother was not was told not to drink wine or strong drink now the Bible differentiates in this term of wine and strong drink so apparently in the Old Testament there was a wine which was not a strong drink or the Bible would not have said wine or strong drink so what was that wine which was not considered strong drink it's the same one Jesus made it was not fermented wine or strong drink I can see that some of you were shock Plum out of your shoes well that's okay just hold on we'll get them for you after the service is over 1st Samuel chap 25: 32 through 38 nabal died after a drunk spree 2 Samuel 11:13 by getting UAH drunk David hoped to cover his sin now you see where I'm going with this look at the attributes of drunkenness now let me just spring the answer on you would our lord Jesus actually create 1880 gallons of wine now this is what it would have been with these containers containing two to three furens a piece and they were full of water what our lord Jesus created 1880 gallons of wine which would have intoxicated hundreds of people for many days and then knowing that all of these things right here could come from that creation can we honestly believe our lord Jesus would do such a thing well I think most of you got it we can probably move to the next question but I don't think I will I got a little bit more we want to look at now watch so Uriah getting drunk and David thinks by that his senses will be softened because this man really had some conviction said David said go go go lay with your wife no no no I can't do that no so what did David do he just kept giving him more drink more drink more drink but it didn't work because David knew what it was about intoxicating drink notice in 2 Samuel 13: 28 and 29 amnon was drunk when he was killed what a way to leave this world and meet God first Kings 20 verses 12- 21 benh Hadad and 32 other kings were drinking when they were attacked and defeated by the Israelites so what did intoxication do it desensitized their keenness to fight it desensitized their ability now know doubt these were professional men that knew how to war but why could not they fight well because the intoxication had desensitized everything about them they couldn't talk plain they couldn't walk right they could not think proper so there's no way they're going to be able to fight so get them drunk and you'll be able to kill them and the Lord Jesus would create this same thing and let this that he did be identified with him for over 2,000 years I really like the verse to that song you sung a while ago because it said water and wine I'm sure that it's been something that people for centuries actually for a couple of Millennia have wondered about and all many people have tried to take it and use it as a proof to say well Jesus turned the water into wine so you know it would be okay for us to be able to drink and it would be it's fine for you to drink the same kind he created created which was grape juice no one got intoxicated from drinking Jesus wine can you imagine him creating 180 gallons of intoxication and telling everybody get drunk and have a great time in my name do this on me remember me remember my miraculous power when you get over your hangover no that's not what our lord Jesus done at all now watch this in Proverbs 4:17 alcoholic drink is called the wine of violence Proverbs 23: 19-20 a wise person will not be among the drinkers of alcoholic beverages Proverbs 23:21 drunkenness causes poverty now remember the Lord Jesus knew all of these verses so would he as God then come in the New Testament and create something which would break every one of these verses which we are looking at tonight then if he would what kind of God are we serving you understand everybody see where we're going with it Proverbs 23 again 29 the 30 drinking calls is woe sorrow fighting babbling wounds without cause red eyes huh Proverbs 23:32 alcoholic drinks bite like a serpent sting like an Adder Proverbs 23:24 alcohol makes the Drinker unstable verse 35 alcohol makes the Drinker insensitive to pain so he does not perceive it as a warning alcohol is habit forming do you understand a if a person has so much alcohol in their blood it will keep them from freezing to death because it so stimulates the blood is that right brother Joe you know more about it than I would as far as the natural sense it will not allow them to freeze to death and and another person set up there without that alcohol and it would kill them look what it does oh my proverbs 31 veres 4 to 5 Kings princes and others who rule and judge must not drink alcohol alcohol perverts good judgment Proverbs 316 to7 strong drink could be given to those about to perish or those in pain but we have painkillers today so what would they do when people were in pain people on the battlefield and they had been stabbed in their fix them to die they got a sword running through their guts and they got big old You Know Places cut all over them and what would they do give them the alcohol to desensitize them and our lord Jesus created 180 gallons of this stuff so people could have a big party in his name not my Lord Jesus Ecclesiastes 2:3 the king tried everything King Solomon including intoxicating drink to see if it's satisfied and the end result was he said it did not in verse 8 Ecclesiastes 10:17 a land is blessed when its leaders do not drink Isaiah 5 11-12 woe to those who get up early to drink and stay up late at night to get drunk Isaiah 19:14 drunken men stagger in their vomit Jeremiah 35: 2-14 the rites drank no grape juice nor intoxicating wine and were blessed so the rites this was a sign of the blessing of God on them because they did not drink any of this and the Lord Jesus has got the disciples the apostles all standing around drunk the 70 drunk if this was what the Lord Jesus did wonder why there's not one Speck of History which would have been written against him for doing such can you imagine they would have loved that if the Lord Jesus would have created intoxicating drink and the priest and the rabbis would have come and it would have went right down through history it would have been better by somebody just said you'd not believe it Jesus went there and created this wine and they had this big drunken party now remember unlike the way we do weddings today it was a minimum of seven days that the wedding celebration lasts totally different than what we do today if you were invited to the wedding celebration if they run out of wine those which were invited to your celebration could actually take you to court and sue you for it if you run out of food food to eat they could take you to court not only that it would be a witness against you for the rest of your married life you would be ridiculed made fun of and life that because you didn't have enough wine you didn't have enough mac and cheese you didn't have enough chicken nuggets I'm saying it on your terms now so the Lord Jesus knows all of this so this now Jesus didn't arrive the first day but it was just like two or three days in to the wedding and they were already out of why were they poor people who knows exactly what was going on so we have to get the setting to understand why would he even do this in the first place the Lord Jesus bailed out that young couple the way he's bailed out many of us now was it negligence on their part was it a lack of Finance we don't know exactly what it was he's bailing out the reputation so why would you bail out the reputation of a young man and a young woman and you're going to ruin your own by making intoxicating drink and it be used against you for 2,000 years praise the Lord ain't the word of God so wonderful oh praise the Lord now notice in Daniel chap 1: 5-17 it just condensed this and you can write it down and read it when you have time Daniel refused the king's intoxicating wine and was blessed for it along with his abstaining friends Daniel 5:4 drinking wine was combined with praising false gods Hosea 4:11 in intoxicating wine takes away intelligence Joel 3:3 the enemy is judged for selling girls for wine can you imagine a father selling his daughter for wine selling your daughter for whyne why because this was an alcoholic you understand in the Victorian times they didn't have Ajax they didn't have bleach and many of the stuff that we have today anybody here know what they mopped their floors in anybody a mixture of beer and water the yeast in the beer was a cleansing agent so they would mix it together and it would actually clean their floors but do you understand that some of the alcoholics that was in such a bad shape they would go and stand outside and wait for the maids to pour out the mop water so there's cow manure there's everything imaginable inside that mop water but it had a little bit of alcohol in that mop water and they would stand outside cow manure chicken manure everything else all the filth and the Lord Jesus would create that for people to become intoxicated and addicted to not my Lord now my Lord creates wine absolutely and as a matter of fact I love to get drunk on that wine which is allowed for Sons and Daughters of God but it's stimulation by Revelation and oh yeah you do get addicted because once you ever get it it's like you can never get enough you want more but you won't sell your girls to get it you won't make you beat your wife and you won't lose your intelligence you won't become you know like a lot of drunks do but you come so in love with the Lord Jesus and so in love with other people people will know that you're pass from Death unto life praise the Lord notice habac chap 2 verse 5 a man is betrayed by wine verse 16 drinking leads to shame Matthew 24: 48-51 a drinking servant is unprepared for his Lord's return so how then could Jesus then early there in the first couple of chapters of John create an intoxicating 180 gallons of wine and then use wine as a parable in this servants getting drunk and say whenever they say our Lord delays his coming and they begin to eat and drink and they beat the servants which is what happens when you get drunk our Lord would create that very substance and use it in a parabolic form and say now if you all do this this will make you miss the coming of the lord well how could he create something that would make them do it and then turn around around and say oh yeah if y'all drink this you won't be ready for my coming are you young people understanding where I'm coming from tonight oh my Luke 1 verse1 15 John the Baptist drank neither grape juice nor one Romans 13:13 do not walk in drunkenness or immorality 1 Corinthians 511 if a Christian brother is a drinker do not associate with him Wow have no company with him 1 Corinthians 6:10 drunkards will not inherit the kingdom of God Galatians 5:21 acts of the sinful nature such as drunkenness will prohibit a person from inheriting the kingdom of God now let read Numbers Chapter 6:2 speak unto the children of is Isel and say unto them when either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite to separate themselves unto the Lord he shall separate himself from wine now notice how Moses differentiates between wine and strong drink now remember the word grape juice is not in the Bible but this wine here was actually grape juice first stage now they did not have the ability that we do today to be able to keep grape juice the only thing they could do was boil it and gigantic Vats it would then turn into a jelly type of form which would endure its life a little bit it was more of a concentrate but they didn't have the ability to go down to Food City or Kroger wherever and buy 100% grape juice they had no way to be able to do it so the first thing that they would do then whenever they would it out in their feet and and they would it and then they would take it and they would begin to use it before the natural process would go to being used so notice how the Bible then separates it he shall separate himself from from wine and strong drink and shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes nor eat moist grapes or dried now the word which we render vinegar shets signifies fermentation and might have been so rendered so sh drink no strong fermentation of wine notice again numbers 287 and the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hen for the one lamb in the Holy Place Thou shalt cause the strong wine to be poured out unto the Lord for a drink offering now notice how the Bible differentiates now strong wine what was it strong it was because it had Now set and fermented and it's moved over into this alcoholic state but remember even at that no more than 5 to 7% alcohol look at Samson's mother judges 13:4 now therefore beware I pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink not wine what is this it's what we would call today grape juice and eat not any unclean thing Proverbs 20 And1 wine is a mocker to scorn make mouths at talk arrogantly to boast to mock derived to be inflated scoff act as a scorner show oneself as a marcker sounds like a drunk man to me wine is a marcker strong drink is Raging so wine is a marcker in that it deceives by its fragrance and intoxicates by its strength so it deceives by its fragrance and then to a person they begin to smell it oh it just does something to him it doesn't it doesn't intoxicate by the fragrance but it deceives by the fragrance and intoxicates by its strengths and renders the intoxicated ridiculous absolutely ridiculous and then Solomon the great writer of Proverbs says that strong drink is a raging and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise so the word raging is to murmur growl Roar cry aloud mourn rage make noise yeah sounds like a drunk to me TL be clamorous be disqui be loud be troubled be an uproar be in a stir be it a commotion to be borous to be turbulent and the Lord Jesus created 180 gallons of this no my brother sister he did not now nothing is mentioned here if you'll notice about excess drinking it's drinking altoe oh but brother Donnie it's okay right if we drink in moderation actually it's not it's drinking itself that is condemned well praise the lord it's the very nature of alcohol that grabs a hold of people now you take my word for this and I protect the identity of course as always of many that I've dealt with down through the years and I've dealt with not not just people who drink there's a difference between somebody who just drinks and an alcoholic they will sell their soul so to speak to have it they'll do whatever they've got to do they'll take their baby's milk money they'll do whatever they have to do to have it Proverbs 23:29 who has woe who hath sorrow who ha contentions who has babbling who has wounds without cause who has redness of eyes that they T long at the wine that they go to seek mixed wine look not upon the wine when it is red watch it now it's changing from the deep color of purple it's becoming fermented it's changing ing from the grape juice color to the red to the red look not upon the wine when it is red when it giveth his color in the cup when it moves itself what's happening the fermentation of it changing the color and the person that's aware of it he knows what the color represents listen this is a man apparently that had drunk it before at the last it bite us like a serpent and sting us like an Adder Thine Eyes Shall Behold strange women thine heart shall utter perverse things now you mean intoxication will cause even a married man to look at a somebody else's wife or you know some woman at a bar and will stir up his lust and his passions and the Lord Jesus created 180 gallons of this so the people could all go around drinking and make them look at somebody else's wife and want to take their wife or their husband yall don't believe that do you how could our lord Jesus break all of these scriptures praise the Lord he could not could he brother Joel he could not Thine Eyes Shall Behold strange women thine heart shall utter perverse things now notice he says yay Thou shalt be as that that liest down to the midst of the sea or he that liest down on the top of a mast look at a drunk man he's lying down like he's in the middle of the sea or on top of the Mast anybody in the right mind ain't going to lay down on the top of a mast you know what a mast is right it's the big pole in the ship by which they would pull up the sail it's about that big around at the top you're going to lay down on top of that if you're a drunk you will why because your senses are so changed they're so changed you can't perceive things any longer verse 35 they have stricken me shalt thou say and I was not sick they have beaten me and I felt it not this is what it does when you get so drunk they can hit you and beat you and kick you and stomp you oh I don't even care I don't even care and Jesus made this so all these people could experience that no he did not my my now notice what they will do though this is the terrible thing about it they have beaten me and I felt it not when shall I wake when shall iwake I will seek it yet again so they'll go through all that utter complete nonsense that I just read you from one verse after another after another and when they wake up they say I got to do it again I have to do it again I have to have it oh my now let me just read you a few words from historians PL anybody ever heard of him plany Roman historian plyy said good wine is destitute of spirit in other words it isn't alcoholic now plany was not a holy ghost filled Apostolic preacher he was a wine drinking Roman historian and this Roman historian said good wine is destitute of spirit so some of you may be wondering tonight but wait a minute brother Donnie that man at the feast got up and said most people drink the bad you know they bring the good wine and then whenever people the wine is going on and going out then they bring the bad stuff but you've saved the good until last and you're you're thinking in your mind well the good stuff must have been the most potent stuff that ain't what plyy said plyy said the good stuff is without the spirit the alcohol intoxication he also said wine with the strength reduced by the filter was the most suitable for all men you know what they would do mix it with water Aristotle any y'all ever heard of Aristotle Aristotle said the good wine does not not intoxicate well I normally don't amen Aristotle but I'm going to amen him here now listen friends so there's a continuity that runs even with history so these men now they rub shoulders with the upper echelon of their day you imagine them saying such a thing it's outdated of course in oldfashioned in this day but that's what these men come up with it wonder where they got this idea being around all them drunk rulers and all them drunk leaders Solomon went on to say in Proverbs 31:4 it is not for Kings Oly mule it is not for Kings to drink wine nor princes strong drink notice the differentiation again between wine and strong drink verse five lest they drink and forget the law oh so this is what drinking will do huh and pervert the Judgment of any of The Afflicted Isaiah 287 but they also have aired through wine and through true strong drink the scripture over and over again now the word strong there an intoxicating beverage different from wine it was a fictitious product made of a mixture of sweet ingredients whether derived from grain and vegetables or from the juice of fruits dates and a decoation of Honey wow so the Bible actually differentiated between wine and strong drink are out of the way the priest and the prophet have aired through strong drink they are swallowed up of wine they are out of the way through strong drink they air in Vision they stumble in judgment why because they were drinking intoxicating drink habac 2:15 whoa now listen this carefully woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink so if the Lord Jesus created intoxicating drink the Old Testament put a woe on the Lord Jesus so that means your lamb the atonement for your sins had a woe placed upon him which means he was not sinless after all you see this is one thing I love about question and answers cu the lord loves to get the devil into such a tight spot a squeal like a pig I mean I love hearing that Devil's [Laughter] squal Hallelujah woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink so Jesus provides 180 gallons of this no that put us thy bottle to him and makest him drunken also that thou mayest look on their nakedness so you imagine these days if the Lord Jesus made it 50 proof 90 100 which is the way some Christians read this the best was saved to the last which in their mind thinks the most intoxicating power the most generative think that because they want to drink or they're already doing it on the side already but the best wine it must have been so flavorful it must have just been awesome because the man that was in charge of the feast he come back and said I ain't never tasted none of this in my life well of course he ain't all the rest of the wine he drunk was made by by man this was made by God himself so it wasn't intoxicating but the Aroma and the flavor and and the color it must have been absolutely awesome I'd like to have some of it right now you say oh Lord Brother do not you yes I drink ale ginger ale I drink beer A and W zero sugar root beer isn't it amazing though some of you go out I say mama brother Donnie said he dranks beer tell them the rest of what I said but it amazing somebody that would want to say oh goodness I heard the preacher say drunk beer and it's the same word but it's not the same stuff but in our mind under Western Civilization when we think wine we think like our modern day we're not reading it right in the setting of the scripture can anybody say amen amen woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink that put us a bottle to him and maketh him drunken also that thou mayest look on their nakedness so the word wine in the Bible is used to actually describe the wine with alcohol and the wine without very same Hebrew word now grape juice what we call grape juice today is sometimes referred to in the Bible as new wine Isaiah 658 thus sayeth the Lord as the new wine is found in the cluster notice now it's not set in the vat for weeks and weeks and weeks our communion wine that we use speaking of that we need to take communion again don't we how he agrees with that brother JD Woodson makes that for us I don't know exactly the process if you would like to ask him you can I'm sure but he makes that for us and it's a process of being able to allow it to do whatever it is that it does but notice how the writer Isaiah here he says as the new wine is found in the cluster not the vat not the container which it's set in and fermentation but the new wine is actually in the cluster and one saith destroy it not for a blessing is in it so will I do for my servant's sake so God here is likening the new wine which is the grape juice to the blessing of the Lord Matthew 9:17 neither do men put new wine into Old bottles so they would not take fresh grape juice and put it into the bottles remember they didn't have glass at that time but they use animal skin so the animal skins the oil out of the animal skin was dried out so if they put new wine in there then it will start activating and it will cause the animal skin to burst wide open and you lose the skin and also the wine so Jesus himself uses this word new wine now let's look at St John Chapter 2 where Jesus turned the water into wine in the third day there was a marriage in canaa of Galilee never remember remember Jesus shows up on day three so they've got at least day three on through day seven five more days of festivities and Jesus comes on the third day on the third day there was a marriage in Cana of galileon and the mother of Jesus was there both Jesus was called and his disciples to the marriage and when they wanted wine the mother of Jesus said unto him they have no wine not to us we're thinking so what what's the big deal well they didn't have punch and they didn't have Coke Zero poor things and they they didn't have zero sugar A&W Root Beer and they didn't have all the stuff whatever it is that you like to drink and these young people's reputation is going to be ly you talking about embarrassing so notice Jesus saith unto Heroman wow woman what have I to do with thee mine hour is not yet come his mother saith unto the servants whatsoever he saith unto you do it now that's quite a rebuke in one way right so you think we said well sure Mom I mean whatever you want mom is exactly what I do he don't even call her mother but he calls her woman mine hour is not yet come but somehow she must have believed I know him well enough to know he's going to do something for this young couple oh I'm so glad he's done something for us to bail me out my goodness how many times has he bail me out of some of the craziest stuff ever was anybody know what I'm talking about when you get yourself in a fix and Jesus comes on the scene notice and they're set six water parts of stone after the manner of purifying of the Jews containing two or three furens a piece Jesus saith unto them fill the water pots with water and they fill them up to the brim and he saith unto them draw out now and bear unto the governor of the feast and they bear it and when the RO ruler of the feast had tasted the water which was made wine and knew not whence it was but the servants which drew the water knew the governor of the feast called the bridegroom and sath unto him every man at the beginning just set forth the good wine now let's look at this Greek word onos this word was used to describe both wine with and without alcohol so how are we going to be able to know which one Jesus created we will judge the works of our Lord Jesus by How It lines up with his word now if you'll learn this tonight it'll help you the rest of your entire life a lot of people blame Jesus for a lot of stuff he don't do and they feel led to do this and feel led to do that and feel led to do something else and whenever you hear people tell why I feel led to do this and I feel led to do that and I feel led to do something else and yet you know the scripture you know the teaching of the word of the IR you say how in the world could that be because that's contrary to the Bible That's contrary to the word well what are you doing you're doing the very same thing I'm doing right here tonight you're judging what they say they feel led to do but what you know the word teaches now we've done look at what the word says about wine strong drink drunkenness right woe unto the man that will give his neighbor drink so you see I don't want you to be convinced when you leave here tonight tonight well brother Donnie said brother Donnie said Jesus wouldn't have done that I want you to be able to walk out them doors right there and if anybody ask you you can be able to judge it maybe you couldn't do it before this night's service but I want you after this night's service to be able to say I know my lord well enough to know he would have never broken all them Old Testament scriptures and place a woe upon himself and give them intoxicating drink so which application then of on onos was this that our Lord created now watch so alcohol content in the wine in the New Testament run from 5 to 7% now this is a little bit of history for you so it was a common practice to dilute the fermented wine at a ratio of three to one and sometimes up to 20 to one depending on how strong it was this was done to keep them from getting drunk and also to purify their water now listen carefully now remember they did not have Culligan water water they did not have Elizabethan water Johnson City Water they did not have all the ways that we have to treat water now I've traveled in different nations of the world and I know some of you here have as well and whenever I go I try to check out if I'm not familiar with it I try to go to our government's website and see if they recommend drinking the water there has anybody here ever brushed your teeth in cocacola I'm not joking you have you ever brush your teeth in Fanta orange you talking about a real treat now the reason I've have done that before is because their water would make me sick believe me I've got sick before I thought I was going to die Carolyn I was an a eting in Kenya several years ago there was we was preaching to about 5,000 service in under a large gigantic tent there was brothers that came from Zimbabwe staying in the same hotel that Carol and Iber staying with brother Barry coffee and some other ministers from the states and we were all staying at the same hotel and they would have a buffet type thing where you'd go eat well they had lettuce they had tomatoes they had you know some really good looking stuff but I had done learned you don't eat that stuff cuz it's washed in their water but these were Africans from Zimbabwe but they were coming to eat from water that was not the Bugs they were used to so every one of those people from Zimbabwe got so sick laid up in the hotel they kind of laughed at us because we didn't you know eat anything that wasn't cooked I wouldn't going to do it i' done been sick before I didn't want to be sick again so they o eyes fine it's great brother huh did they learn themsel a lesson now keep in mind they would actually use the wine and dilute it down and pour it in their water to kill the bacteria and the germs in the water wow so you mean when Paul told Timothy drink a little wine for your stomach sake boy there must be a lot more people with stomach trouble than what I realized in the world man because that's what a lot of people you know so-called Christians they love to use that scripture when my belly is hurting my Bell's H yeah it's your head it ain't your belly they don't even apply that scripture don't you understand what Paul was telling Timothy the very same application applied now watch 1 Timothy 5:23 drink no longer water but use a use a little wine for thy stomach sake and thine often infirmities now the conditions where they were the water was so bad Timothy kept having reoccurring stomach issues now this young man was such a sensitive individual I love this guy I can't wait to see him he was so sensitive about doing right and that I mean he was just had a conscience that must have just been so pure that Paul actually had to encourage him buddy it's it's all right for you to take a little bit of it and just kill all this stuff in your water he said you know Timothy I don't have to worry about you getting drunk I have a hard enough time getting you to take a tablespoon of it just to disinfect your water you're talking about a sensitive oh I like these type of Christians right here that they're just so sensitive before the Lord they're not looking to see how close they can get well brother Donnie how much wine is a little how much can I get by with a half a gallon if I take a half a gallon then how much water do I dilute it with do I delete a a bottle water and then I take a half a gallon of water no you've got the ratio the wrong way it's three parts water one part wine up to 20 Parts water of one part wine but remember they're not drinking this for pleasure meure they're not sitting around in a social drink and they're not having a glass of wine with the steak I think I might climb up on the platform and finish the rest oh my so you see it was being mixed for what reason medicinal medicinal had nothing to do with pleasure had nothing to do with some water as far as saying well you know I I just think I'd rather drink a little bit I I'm going drink a little bit with my boss and I'm going to go out tonight with the supper you know that we've got planned and no that's not what he was even talking about but for his stomach sake oh God oh God my stomach's cramping me I'm going to stop by the liquor store and get me a bottle of wine you hypocrite I said you're a hypocrite well Paul told Timothy but he told him to take a little so let me ask you so my doctor several years ago after I got really really sick and whenever I I ate at the Intercontinental Hotel one time in Nairobi and uh very last night that is going to be before we preach on Sunday and then fly out to Frankfurt Germany uh the next night and I I'd been so careful brush my teeth with Coke brush my teeth with Fanta eat no lettuce no tomatoes no cash nothing washed in water and then I went to this InterContinental hotel which is an international chain known around the world oh did they have a spread that night and I asked him I said is this safe oh safe safe safe safe I mean they had prime rib that thing looked like it was just unbelievable mhm I ate some about 2:00 in the morning it woke me up growling well you can imagine the outcome I'm Miss brother Doug McHugh and brother Earl Williams brother Doug knocks on my door the next morning about 9:00 brother Dar we're going to church you ready I brother Doug I can't man I'm dying I'm dying I'd laid in the bed bundled up like this my stomach hurting so bad I'd vomited or there's nothing else to vomit you'll be fine we'll send somebody after you you're preaching I said I can't preach I've been up all night I'm sick as a dog I can't preach you'll be fine the Lord will help you oh it's so nice to have brothers that love you I said brother DG please I can't I can't we'll send somebody after you sure enough they did they sent somebody after me I laid in the bed till about A4 to 11: I finally got up get up put put on you know my pants shirt kind of get a Time vomit I don't know how anything that left to vomit I got there I sit back there for a little bit before I come out the anointing is a strange thing I walked out got under the presence of the Lord about, 1500 people there sister hope matate was there it was a young lady that was her home church then people pulled I moved under the anointing in just a little bit I did not have one ache I did not have one pain I was so weak I had to stand up on the pull pit but when the anointing hit me my strengths come I felt like I was a horor wi I preached for about an hour and 15 minutes or something like that on a drink for the king them Africans I'm telling you what they pull me me the presence of God was so awesome I thought praise the Lord I'm Healed when the anointing left me they had to Pat me back to the room strange is it we was leaving the next night for Frankfurt German I couldn't eat I got home my eyes changed colors that changed about the color of Mason's sh shirt orange it took me weeks and weeks to get over it why something in the water now this is where we apply it now so whenever we take our medicine my doctor told me several years after that I said you got an advice for me Doc I'm going over to Africa he said y' take some Pepto bismo about two days days before you leave take it a couple times during the day and he said it will be a protective coating it will go down your intestines down into your stomach and it will make them little bacteria where they won't stick to the wall of your intestines well I not only took it I took it with me just in case I needed it so how how much of a medication do we take so if we're taking medication cough syrup something this liquid teaspoon tablespoon any y'all ever took a quart of medication at one time praise the Lord now if we're going to take this wine listen taken in comparison for the medicinal comparability of it praise the Lord so a glass and say it's for my stomach that ain't for your stomach it's that devil you got in [Laughter] you so if we're doing it for medicine let's stick by the little dose just a little bit of trivia if you want to call it that way there's something else here that we need to look at two tablespoons of 86 proof brandy or whiskey can raise the blood alcohol level to 0.04 almost immediately how much two tablespoons one tablespoon of Jin vodka rum and some whiskies can raise the blood alcohol level to reach 0.05 six tablespoons about 1/3 cup a modern fortified wine causes blood level of 0.04 to 0.05 in Paul's day it would require drinking approximately one gallon of 3 to six proof fermented grape juice within an hour to attain a 0.03 blood level alcohol boy that would be quite a feat for a pro a person that's already having stomach trouble wouldn't it I mean you walk out like there what you doing taking my medication shut what life in a make AR you get me tickles so the word denounces a person that does that as a marker now young people quit laughing I looked my head down like [Laughter] this so the wine PR is pronounced let's stand let's stand I'm done anyway praise the Lord don't you appreciate God's word amen I tell you I'm I'm so grateful that God gives us answers for questions things that we may ponder over and I'm sure all of y'all looked at all these scriptures before tonight right everybody you already knew all that yeah right I I I don't mind telling you I enjoyed saying it myself I've never had an issue with drinking myself I've never had problems but I know that some who have and it can be a real issue for some so why would our lord Jesus do such a thing he did not so let's ask the question again if the Lord Jesus turned water into wine why can we not drink it we can go to Food City after the service tonight and go down the aisle and you'll find Welches depends on which Food City you go to John City want to be on the right the other one be on the left 3/4 way up on the top you can get the reduced sugar enough that matters to you and you'll be able to get something that would be very very similar it wouldn't be near as good now because Welches does not have the same recipe the Lord Jesus had everybody understand could our Lord create such a thing that would cause people to do all this and then shame them for doing it no praise the Lord let's bow our heads together father we so love you tonight I thank you for these young people Lord I I so appreciate them want to know and Desiring father to understand that's the reason that we have these questions to where we can meet together it was very important to our Prophet all the years that I was in Pentecost I never did a question answers I was actually never in a question answer service I was quite stunned actually whenever I begin to realize how many that brother Brenham did and then as I begin to look at it I realized what a benefit it was the message was him bringing what you placed on his heart to us question and answers was us and people like us that either misunderstood or we didn't get all of what he meant by it and it was us asking for for clarification or asking parts that he didn't adequately cover and we realize he didn't do it one time but he did it over and over again through the years of his ministry and he said he'd like to find out what was on the church's heart so in August of 64 he took two weekends 823 and 8:30 two weekends to answer questions oh how great they were and brother brandham didn't want to just just the people to ask him from the audience and him not be prepared but he told the people to lay the questions up on the desk so he would be able to study beforehand maybe the young people wonder why I do it this way because this is the example that I have to follow now Lord if I would have stood here tonight and we would have had just an open discussion and someone would have asked this question word for word my answer tonight would not have been what I gave them because I would have not had been so prepared to be able to give them such an answer but since I already received this question then it gave me all all this time they would not even believe the amount of hours that I've spent studying just this one question hours and hours of scripture hours and hours of the message hours and hours so whenever they ask a question I don't want the answer to be off the top of my head and I guess and maybe perhaps but I want the answer to be as thorough as I can possibly give it thank you for this time together Lord I've so enjoyed these question answer Services we love you so much Jesus Lord we we we're not asking for the natural wine but we sure are asking for that spiritual wine Lord that you'd so stimulate our souls at this hour as we we looked at it last night the anointings are being made clear upon what's on the earth in the last day we can see that the pre-tribulation anointing is on the earth and the people are getting drunk on it hundreds more people arrested today Lord people are just insane the things they are saying the things they are doing Lord Jesus we can see that the headship of Satan is fixing to come to fruition then Lord God we believe that your headship is also you're wanting to manifest yourself in your bride Satan will actually be crowned King by his church by his subjects by his people of the last day he could not attain this Crown if it were not for his church Lord Jesus you're waiting for your crown too for you have not yet been been crowned but you're waiting for your bride to Crown you king of kings and Lord of lords what a day that will be when the saints of God rais in the resurrection those of us that are alive and we'll gather together up to Father's house I don't know exactly what the time frame will be but sometime in between that time and your Advent to the Earth to fight that battle of Armageddon the Saints will Crown you King of Kings and Lord of lords we will receive our crown for the rewards of what we've done in life and we will turn and throw those crowns as it were at your feet praise God oh Jesus I want you to be the king of my heart now though Lord I don't want to wait till that day be the king of these young people's hearts father we worship you Lord Jesus we worship you Lord Jesus can we just sing a little bit now and worship him together may his presence feel welcome here among us tonight oh Hallelujah We Worship You Jesus sing it create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit within me it Lord hallelujah create in me a clean heart oh God lord May the stimulation of Revelation the sick encourage the weary Lord oh cast me not away from my presence oh Lord and take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and renew a right Spirit Within Me oh cast me not away from that prence oh Lord and take not thy Holy Spirit from [Music] [Applause] me restore to me the joy of thy [Music] salvation and renew a right Spirit Within Me amen do you enjoy that tonight amen I don't I don't expect that question to ever get asked again if you didn't get it tonight I don't know how any way you could you could understand it any clearer than that that's I didn't drink wine just because I was told not to now I know why I was told not to but and and as he was talking there I was I was thinking you know at the police department for many years most of my kns were dealing with people on drugs and alcohol um brother Rob probably dealt with more of that than I have and actually got some of his people but hundreds hundreds of of people in in my career that and they're they're all different they all act different they all do things that you wouldn't think humanly possible but there's one that always I think of it so often and happened over 22 years ago I got sent to a an apartment this woman there she's about 38 years old she had two cute little boys they were 10 and 12 years old mom was alcoholic and she was going through withdrawals and she'd become homicidal and suicidal so they sent me over there to deal with her and I I got her calmed down and got her talked into going to the hospital with me and as I got there and begin to talk to her she began to tell me her issues and her problems how she got hooked on alcohol you I I mention her I said if you tried God she said I've tried that that don't work she said right now this very minute she said I would trade both my boys for one can of [Music] beer you know that broke my heart at the moment I had to do my reporting you know and I got to thinking you know in the scripture Jesus talks about the new wine several times and you got to understand he says I am the vine you are the branches do you understand what bears the fruit it's not the vine the vine doesn't bear the fruit the branches you bear the fruit and what is inside that fruit what is inside that grape it's the life that came from the vine if we could have the same attitude that she had become so addicted to that new wine I would say Lord I would trade this old man that's right I would trade this old man for that new one for one more drop alcohol does some some strange things new wine does some strange things brother Donnie was talking about how people get so intoxicated that their blood and they they survive in the cold we had a a man that I dealt with my entire career at Johnson City his name was Steve Bradshaw he's passed on May he rest in peace I've never been with Steve one time not one single second I don't know what he would be like sober cuz I've never seen him sober we would find Steve out in the cold in the winter in the rain close half off passed out but alive is me and you he's been hit by cars been sick but he went through it all intoxicated you get intoxicated no matter how cold this world gets no matter how cold life around you gets no matter what you get hit with it's that new wine until you want it like you want nothing else you'll not be ready to go you want you you want to be consumed with it those that are Rapture Ready are so intoxicated they can't see anything else so I I hope you enjoyed that tonight I didn't mean to get up here and preach brother Donnie I apologize but that that that is my hope for the Youth at this church not just the youth for everybody but our desire My Desire brother Rob's desire but the Don is these other ministers desire is you to get so intoxicated that you don't want anything else nothing else nothing matters school don't matter work don't matter your life don't matter trade say God I'll trade this old man for one drop of that new wine God bless you be praying about it towards some time in in in August we're I was talking to brother Donnie and brother Rob were wanting to do a weekend youth service in August so y'all be praying about that and uh Lord will and will hopefully we won't have to have that as brother Donnie says so God bless [Music] youall he's the only

questions because it's helping somebody else it's not just helping yourself you're helping other people when you do that so brother Donnie just laid out just a tremendous sermon tonight just so many
