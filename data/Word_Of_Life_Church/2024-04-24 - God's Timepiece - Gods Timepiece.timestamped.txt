[39:04] amen so enjoyed the ministry of the word
[39:07] and the worship and singing and just the
[39:11] guest visitors that came in to be with
[39:13] us and I'm sure you know it by now that
[39:16] we have been robbed for several several
[39:21] years of being able to host
[39:25] meetings people don't understand
[39:27] it's a blessing to have the people of
[39:30] God to come in and we've been robbed
[39:33] from that because we hadn't had a
[39:34] facility to be able to do it but I'm so
[39:37] grateful that the Lord has give us a
[39:39] place where we can be able to do that
[39:42] the banquet was beautiful for those of
[39:44] you that wasn't here it was beautiful
[39:45] nice setting really nice food and
[39:47] everything went real good there brother
[39:50] Ander so blessed to say I want to say
[39:52] how much I appreciate all the effort and
[39:54] all the work mainly the sisters some of
[39:56] the brothers at bill things and help
[39:58] them hang things and all of that we so
[40:01] appreciate you doing that on Sunday the
[40:04] Deacon Brothers estimated between 750
[40:07] and 800 people were here in the building
[40:09] which means that we had 75 approximately
[40:12] 75 more Vehicles than we had parking
[40:16] places
[40:17] for it's amazing what deacons can
[40:21] do so them parked in the field had them
[40:24] parked over here had them you know just
[40:26] parked everywhere where I appreciate all
[40:28] that effort I appreciate all the parking
[40:30] attendance and
[40:37] you there's more to a meeting than the
[40:40] preachers who preach it there's more to
[40:43] a meeting than the people who do the
[40:44] special singing There's always so much
[40:47] that goes on behind the scenes and I'm
[40:50] so grateful for everything that
[40:53] everybody has done God bless you we're
[40:56] just so appreciate
[40:58] let's turn tonight to the book of
[40:59] Zechariah if you
[41:02] would I thought that I was ready for
[41:04] tonight with u what had already been
[41:07] studying up during the week last week
[41:10] but early this morning the Lord give me
[41:14] a little bit different direction for
[41:17] tonight so I believe God's timing yes
[41:23] listen to that word timing
[41:27] is always
[41:29] perfect so I want to speak to you on
[41:32] God's time
[41:35] piece God's timing is always
[41:40] perfect Zechariah 12 verse
[41:44] one Zachariah was like several of the
[41:47] Old Testament prophets that he was able
[41:49] to prophesy of current events that was
[41:51] going on in his age but also able to see
[41:56] many many many thousands of years in
[41:59] advance of his time actually Zachariah
[42:03] prophesied about our day for he said in
[42:06] the evening time there shall be light so
[42:09] he spoke about us he spoke about
[42:12] Armageddon he spoke about the defeat of
[42:15] the Antichrist and all of that now let
[42:18] us pick up here in in chapter 12 verse
[42:22] one the burden of the word of the Lord
[42:24] for
[42:25] Israel sayth the Lord which stretcheth
[42:28] forth the heavens and layeth the
[42:31] foundation of the
[42:33] Earth andth the spirit of man within
[42:38] him behold I will make
[42:42] Jerusalem a cup of
[42:46] trembling now listen what God's going to
[42:48] do behold I will make Jerusalem a cup of
[42:54] trembling so it's a metaphor
[42:57] that like a person is taking something
[43:01] and they're trying to take the contents
[43:04] or view the contents in the cup but
[43:08] their hand is so shaking looking at what
[43:14] is in the cup and want you notice what
[43:16] God said that he would make the cup of
[43:19] trembling I will make Jerusalem a cup of
[43:24] trembling unto all the people round
[43:26] about
[43:27] when they shall be in The Siege both
[43:30] against Judah and against
[43:35] Jerusalem and in that day I will make
[43:38] Jerusalem a
[43:40] burdensome
[43:42] Stone so Jerusalem is going to be a cup
[43:45] of trembling and it's also also going to
[43:48] be a burdensome Stone now this would
[43:52] have been a metaphor again common in
[43:55] that day to us make no sense
[43:57] whatsoever but that land is a land of a
[44:01] lot of rocks a lot of stones so one
[44:03] thing that they would do they would have
[44:06] Stones around their Villages and their
[44:09] cities and they would have different
[44:11] size of stones and different shapes of
[44:14] stones and one thing that they would use
[44:17] them for is for their young boys and
[44:20] they would have certain ones that the
[44:22] little boys could pick up and show their
[44:24] daddy how strong they were and their
[44:26] mama and then as they got older and they
[44:29] got stronger they could pick up the
[44:31] bigger ones and the bigger ones and the
[44:34] bigger ones but there was always a risk
[44:38] whenever you picked one of them up if
[44:41] you hadn't picked it up before to know
[44:43] how solid how dense that it was it could
[44:48] hurt you now listen what God Said and in
[44:52] that day I will I make Jerusalem a
[44:56] burdensome some Stone so people are
[45:00] going to try to pick it up they're going
[45:03] to try to manipulate Jerusalem they're
[45:07] going to try to do things with it but
[45:10] listen What God Says for all
[45:14] people now I realize that us here in the
[45:16] western civilization we're thousands of
[45:18] miles from Jerusalem we think what
[45:20] effect does that have on us on us but
[45:23] the prophet Zachariah said there would
[45:26] come a day when Jerusalem would be a
[45:29] burdensome stone for all people that's
[45:33] people in Africa people in India people
[45:36] in China people in Carter
[45:40] County all that burden themselves with
[45:45] it now notice what they're going to do
[45:48] all that burden themselves with it shall
[45:53] be cut in pieces
[45:57] so then those that come and try to
[46:00] manipulate cut remove shape into
[46:04] whatever they think Jerusalem shall be
[46:08] God has warned them all that burden
[46:11] themselves with it shall be cut in
[46:16] pieces though all the people of the
[46:20] earth now listen how many all the people
[46:24] of the
[46:25] Earth will be gathered together against
[46:31] it
[46:33] why it's such a tiny
[46:36] Place Jerusalem is not that big of a
[46:39] city why would all the earth and the
[46:43] people of the Earth have representation
[46:47] there and be against
[46:50] it notice this in question answers on
[46:53] Genesis in
[46:55] 1953 if you want to see what time of the
[46:59] year it is look on the
[47:02] calendar if you want to see what time of
[47:05] night it is look at the clock well you
[47:09] don't have to I'll tell you it's
[47:13] 7:40 if you want to see what day you're
[47:17] living in look where the Jews
[47:22] are that's
[47:25] God's time
[47:28] piece how many wants to know where we
[47:31] are I believe we better find out don't
[47:34] you that's God's time piece I skip on
[47:38] down on that paragraph there a little
[47:40] bit and he said now tonight the oldest
[47:43] flag in all the world the six-point star
[47:47] of David flies over Jerusalem for the
[47:51] first time in
[47:54] 2500 years
[47:57] since the carrying away of Babylon Jesus
[48:01] said when you see the Fig Tree putting
[48:03] forth its buds there she is there he
[48:06] said learn a parable you say Summer's
[48:09] nigh when you see this know that the
[48:11] times is at the door were right at the
[48:15] end of
[48:18] time let we like to be remember tonight
[48:21] as we
[48:22] pray Heavenly Father we
[48:27] believ that we are
[48:29] taught there's things for us to look at
[48:33] and watch and
[48:36] see in order to know what the hour is
[48:40] all of us are so
[48:43] familiar with keeping up with the
[48:46] time we have so many appointments and so
[48:49] many places to go so many things to do
[48:52] and our lives are on such a time
[48:55] schedule
[48:57] so time is very important to all of us
[49:01] but then Lord we look and we see of the
[49:06] events of the world we see where we are
[49:10] we believe the Rapture is
[49:13] close
[49:14] Armageddon is
[49:17] close so father we want to look tonight
[49:21] at your time piece be able to see where
[49:24] we are so if there's some come here
[49:27] present or will hear this service and
[49:30] maybe they haven't looked at the time
[49:33] piece quite accurately or they've looked
[49:37] at it and they've just casually glanced
[49:41] may they look at it in a very serious
[49:44] way
[49:44] tonight father you see this handkerchief
[49:47] that I have in my hand I pray over it
[49:50] tonight Lord I will stick in my pocket
[49:52] as I preach your word for sister Lona
[49:55] you see her need father in the name of
[49:58] Jesus would you go to our sister tonight
[50:00] and touch her Lord we pray in Jesus name
[50:05] and the Saints said amen God bless you
[50:08] you may be
[50:15] seated it's
[50:17] evident by the time we're
[50:20] living that many people do not look at
[50:24] Israel as we do as
[50:28] Believers pretty much the majority of
[50:32] mainstream if I can say it that way
[50:36] Christians would recognize that Israel
[50:40] has a certain place in God but yet you
[50:44] might be surprised to know that there
[50:47] are some
[50:49] Christians that are against the Jews
[50:54] there are some Christians that
[50:57] actually speak against the Jews of
[51:00] course they don't believe Romans n they
[51:02] don't believe what God says that he
[51:04] would do with them and it's hard for me
[51:07] to understand how they can even profess
[51:10] Christianity and believe such but for
[51:13] where we look at it we realize that God
[51:17] started dealing with them many many
[51:21] thousands of years ago and God has
[51:25] actually said the prophetic calendar by
[51:29] the dealings of Israel we know the 70
[51:34] weeks of Daniel which are prophetic
[51:37] weeks given in a time frame the first
[51:41] set the 60 and two weeks and then the
[51:45] last one of course coming down that
[51:48] would be broke up by the Gentile
[51:52] dispensations we are fitting inside that
[51:56] time frame
[51:57] and that time piece of God and we know
[52:00] that more has happened in our age as far
[52:05] as God dealing with Israel that has
[52:08] happened for a couple of thousand years
[52:11] I me know it was
[52:13] 557 BC when Nebuchadnezzar came with the
[52:19] Babylonians and burnt the city and I
[52:22] told you just recently that they have
[52:25] found through archaeological digs and
[52:27] dug up some of the Timbers that were
[52:31] blackened with the fire that was set by
[52:35] Nebuchadnezzar and his soldiers now all
[52:38] that Bears record then not long ago they
[52:42] uncovered the arch that would have been
[52:45] from the western side of the Western
[52:47] Wall coming over into the streets and
[52:51] that Arch which would have fallen when
[52:53] Titus come in and burnt the cities so
[52:56] it's all there in the archaeological
[52:59] record and God of course we know has it
[53:02] also in his record of the word now watch
[53:06] the prophet again in the mark of the
[53:08] beast he says if you want to see what
[53:11] day of the month it is look on the
[53:13] calendar if you want to see what day in
[53:15] the season it is of the coming of the
[53:18] Lord watch where Israel's sitting that's
[53:22] God's time piece there she is set
[53:26] heading in her Homeland the oldest flag
[53:30] in the world Sixpoint start of David the
[53:33] oldest flag in the world flies again for
[53:36] the first time for 2500 years yes the
[53:40] inside now remember the prophet of the
[53:43] Old Testament said there would be an
[53:46] inside raised in the last
[53:50] days and yet it's easy to see even in
[53:55] America that people do not believe that
[54:00] God has a chosen people called
[54:04] Israel you see it on your news you read
[54:07] your newspaper you get it on your news
[54:09] apps it's absolutely beyond control and
[54:15] out of control what's taking place on
[54:18] many of our great campuses just this
[54:22] very day today arrests that are being
[54:26] made and yet many of the presidents of
[54:31] these leftist campus are letting it go
[54:36] on why because they are
[54:39] blind now won't you listen to me
[54:42] carefully tonight do you understand that
[54:45] when the bride goes home in the
[54:49] Rapture that day will be the greatest
[54:53] day that has ever been since the
[54:57] resurrection of our Lord Jesus for it
[55:01] will be the raising of the Dead the
[55:05] changing of the living but it will also
[55:10] be the unleashing and the beginning of
[55:14] the six seal now remember when the bride
[55:17] goes up Satan comes down there will be
[55:22] things that will happen so rapidly that
[55:26] the majority of the world will be
[55:29] totally overwhelmed now think Satan only
[55:33] has three and a half years left so he
[55:38] also will be on a Time Clock it's not
[55:42] like Satan will let it go for three
[55:45] months 6 months nine months and then all
[55:49] hell will break loose if the bride goes
[55:53] home in the morning in the rapture
[55:57] all hell will have broken Loose by the
[56:01] time you get off work
[56:03] tomorrow if you miss the Rapture
[56:07] right there are things that are going on
[56:11] behind the scenes even now which is
[56:15] Satan's
[56:17] mechanics that he's getting everything
[56:21] possible that he can get ready until the
[56:25] bride is gone for we know that Paul
[56:27] wrote it there 2,000 years ago for he
[56:30] that L us will let until he be taken out
[56:35] of the way and then the wicked one shall
[56:37] be revealed of course the prophet took
[56:39] that scripture and he quoted it when he
[56:41] preached the seals and I really like the
[56:44] way that he read it and the way brought
[56:46] it into present life he that now led us
[56:50] will let Christ the bride Christ the
[56:55] bride the elect he that now let us will
[56:59] let until he oh you say brother Donnie
[57:03] said he and the prophet said the bride
[57:06] she you see the Capstone will have come
[57:09] down and she will be identified with him
[57:13] and when she is taken out of the way you
[57:16] understand the reason that the world is
[57:19] not already overrun is because the bride
[57:24] is still here there is still feel Mercy
[57:27] On The Mercy Seat because the blood is
[57:30] still identified there apparently there
[57:33] are some people who are not yet saved or
[57:36] some that haven't yet received the Holy
[57:38] Ghost or there's some that are saved
[57:42] have received the Holy Ghost and they've
[57:44] just not yet come to that state of
[57:47] maturity and when they do then the
[57:50] Rapture will be the culmination of all
[57:53] these things that God has done for
[57:55] thousand thousand of years when the
[57:58] bride goes up that very day if the bride
[58:03] leaves this world at 9:00 in the morning
[58:07] and the bride walks into the paradise of
[58:10] God and Satan sees her and recognizes
[58:16] what has taken place do you understand
[58:20] Washington DC Belgium all Munich Germany
[58:25] all the Nations and their capitals
[58:28] Johannesburg South Africa Harari
[58:31] Zimbabwe all the capitals all the Great
[58:34] municipals and the great controlling
[58:37] centers of the World by by 5:00 that
[58:42] afternoon there will be such a change
[58:46] over the entire Earth the majority of
[58:49] the people will never know what is
[58:52] taking place until the laws start being
[58:56] changed which will happen day by day by
[59:00] day by day the six seal will begin to
[59:05] open up and the wraths of God will be
[59:08] poured out in accumulative form like it
[59:12] has never been
[59:14] before people will start being hunted
[59:18] down because they profess Jesus
[59:23] Christ people will be killed
[59:27] their lives will be
[59:29] taken and it will happen
[59:33] overnight now s the devil knows he has
[59:38] but a short time in some sense of the
[59:41] word he smarter than we are cuz we act
[59:44] like we got plenty of time well come on
[59:47] now there's folks around the message
[59:49] that have sat around it for years and
[59:50] years ain't got the Holy Ghost and don't
[59:53] even want it there's people that's got
[59:56] sin in their lives and they know they do
[59:58] and they act like they got plenty of
[1:00:00] time one of these days you're going to
[1:00:02] wake up and realize a bride's done go
[1:00:04] you show up at Word of Life Church and
[1:00:07] the pastor and lot of the rest of these
[1:00:09] people will be totally missing then what
[1:00:12] are you going to
[1:00:13] do I hope and pray to God there ain't
[1:00:15] none of my family left if they miss the
[1:00:18] Rapture I hope they die before the
[1:00:20] Rapture takes place that may sound crazy
[1:00:22] to you I'd rather toce them dead than to
[1:00:26] go through the tribulation period there
[1:00:28] ain't nobody here in this building
[1:00:30] tonight has an idea of how horrible that
[1:00:35] is fixing to be come on now God knew
[1:00:40] that Israel would leave the word he knew
[1:00:44] that when he made a covenant with
[1:00:46] Abraham verified the Covenant with Isaac
[1:00:50] with Jacob and then of course ratified
[1:00:52] it even further in the possession of the
[1:00:55] land under
[1:00:57] Joshua and before Moses ever left God
[1:01:01] instructed Moses to tell the people of
[1:01:04] Israel I know what you all will do I
[1:01:08] know that you will turn away from me and
[1:01:11] let me tell you what I'm going to do to
[1:01:14] you when you do now remember these are
[1:01:17] God's covenant chosen people read with
[1:01:21] me in Leviticus
[1:01:23] 26:32 and I will bring the land into
[1:01:27] desolation and your enemies which dwell
[1:01:32] therein shall be astonished at it now
[1:01:36] what's God the very God that said I'll
[1:01:39] bless you I'll make you the head not the
[1:01:41] tail I'll bless you coming in I'll bless
[1:01:43] you going out I'll bless you I'll do all
[1:01:45] these great things but this is what he
[1:01:47] also tells them when they disobey so God
[1:01:51] said this is what I'm going to do to
[1:01:53] your blessed Promised Land I will turn
[1:01:56] it into
[1:01:58] desolation and your enemies will move in
[1:02:02] the land and they will dwell there and
[1:02:05] they shall be astonished at it your
[1:02:08] enemies will look at it and see what has
[1:02:12] happened because your Disobedience not
[1:02:15] only affected you but it affected this
[1:02:19] great
[1:02:19] land notice again Leviticus
[1:02:23] 26:33 and I will scatter better you
[1:02:27] among the Heathen and will draw out a
[1:02:30] sword after you and your land shall be
[1:02:34] desolate and your cities waste
[1:02:37] Deuteronomy
[1:02:39] 4:26 I call Heaven and Earth to witness
[1:02:43] against you this day now this is Moses
[1:02:45] the prophet saying this that ye shall
[1:02:48] soon utterly perish from off the land
[1:02:51] where un until you go over Jordan to
[1:02:54] possess it now you imagine they've not
[1:02:56] even got over there yet but he's telling
[1:02:58] them before they go let me tell you what
[1:02:59] you're going to do you're going to leave
[1:03:01] the word and this is what's going to
[1:03:04] happen to you I'm going to turn against
[1:03:06] you the same God that brought you in I'm
[1:03:08] going to turn against you I'll tell you
[1:03:10] one thing friends whenever God gets
[1:03:13] upset at us oh my well you think the
[1:03:15] devil being mad at you is an issue you
[1:03:17] think Mama been mad at you your boss
[1:03:19] been mad at you it ain't nothing like
[1:03:21] when God gets upset at you now I want
[1:03:25] you to notice what what he says he said
[1:03:27] that you shall soon utterly perish off
[1:03:31] the land well until you go over Jordan
[1:03:33] to possess it you shall not prolong your
[1:03:36] days upon it notice this is all based on
[1:03:40] them this is not God wanting this God
[1:03:44] did not want that God does not want to
[1:03:46] punish us as members of the elect of God
[1:03:49] do you understand that our message the
[1:03:53] move of the message will turn to a very
[1:03:57] similar thing it's already going in that
[1:04:01] direction to where that will be some
[1:04:03] that will despise the new birth we
[1:04:06] already have preachers message preachers
[1:04:09] that preach against a real experience
[1:04:12] with God they preach against the
[1:04:15] manifestation of the Holy Ghost in an
[1:04:17] individual's life they preach against
[1:04:20] people worshiping and people dancing in
[1:04:22] the spirit what are they doing fixing to
[1:04:26] rid themselves of this Promised Land

[1:04:52] You Deuteronomy chapter 28: 64 and the
[1:04:56] Lord shall scatter thee among all people

[1:05:06] which neither thou nor thy fathers have
[1:05:08] known even wood and stone you want to
[1:05:11] know why Jews are in Germany fulfilling

[1:05:23] Nashville you know why Jews are in
[1:05:26] Asheville North Carolina you know why
[1:05:28] they're all over the world cuz God said
[1:05:31] that's where they'd go it's not a sign
[1:05:34] of God's blessing that they're there
[1:05:36] it's a sign of their
[1:05:39] Disobedience when you leave the message
[1:05:41] of the hour and you say well I'm going
[1:05:44] down here to this charismatic church and
[1:05:45] I'm going over here to this church where
[1:05:48] they don't really quote the prophet
[1:05:50] God's blessing us so much H that ain't a
[1:05:52] sign of God's blessing it's a sign of
[1:05:55] your
[1:05:57] Disobedience well come on somebody well
[1:06:00] praise the Lord I don't bear the
[1:06:02] reproach over here like I do going to
[1:06:04] Word of Life cuz our pastor don't read
[1:06:07] from the prophet's message he ain't fit
[1:06:09] to stand behind the pull pit if he don't
[1:06:11] I'll tell you that right now he's a
[1:06:13] coward and a yellow bellied and he
[1:06:16] ain't got no rights packing a
[1:06:21] Bible you'd be surprised how common
[1:06:23] that's becoming Among Us Nehemiah
[1:06:26] chapter 1 verse 8 brother Donnie you'd
[1:06:28] have a whole lot more people if you
[1:06:30] wouldn't preach that way and what kind
[1:06:31] of people would I have bunch of
[1:06:33] cigarette sucking bobhair painted face
[1:06:36] Jezebels that don't want to hear the
[1:06:38] truths of the word of God I'd rather
[1:06:40] have five people full of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:42] that wanted to move a god than 10,000
[1:06:48] Devils woo Glory Nehemiah 1 ver8
[1:06:54] remember I beseech see the word that
[1:06:57] thou commandest thy servant Moses saying
[1:06:59] if you transgress now watch Nehemiah is
[1:07:02] years later reminding god of the
[1:07:05] prophecy which we just read which how
[1:07:08] commandest thy servant Moses saying if
[1:07:10] you transgress I will scatter you abroad
[1:07:14] among the Nations but if you turn into B
[1:07:18] keep my Commandments notice if so it's
[1:07:21] not based on God it's not God that
[1:07:24] wanted to run them out out so God could
[1:07:26] prove something God is simply foreseeing
[1:07:29] what they would do God knew what Luther
[1:07:32] would do God knew what wesa would do God
[1:07:35] knew what Pentecost would do I'm going
[1:07:37] to go ahead and say it God knew what a
[1:07:39] lot of the message people would do after
[1:07:41] took his profit from the
[1:07:44] earth well praise the
[1:07:47] Lord oh my though they were of You cast
[1:07:51] out unto the uttermost part of the
[1:07:53] heaven yet well I gather them from th
[1:07:57] and will bring them unto the place that
[1:08:00] I have chosen to set my name now
[1:08:03] remember God is basing it on them so
[1:08:07] here is the clock so when Titus comes in
[1:08:12] 70 AD and captures the city and of
[1:08:15] course thousands times thousands and
[1:08:18] Josephus said that the blood was running
[1:08:21] so deep in Jerusalem that people waited
[1:08:24] through the blood and Mada was one of
[1:08:28] the life strongholds and it took them
[1:08:30] quite some time to take it but yet they
[1:08:32] did and it happened exactly as the Lord
[1:08:35] Jesus said and as Jeremiah Zachariah and
[1:08:39] the other prophets of the Old Testament
[1:08:42] and they packed them away but I want you
[1:08:45] to remember now one of the things that
[1:08:47] the Palestinian cause is is causing such
[1:08:51] an uproar in America and around the
[1:08:54] world is because they claim that the
[1:08:58] land of Israel belongs to
[1:09:03] them I say they are
[1:09:09] liars and every University Professor
[1:09:13] that says it belongs to them is also an
[1:09:17] educated
[1:09:20] liar God said I give that land to
[1:09:24] Abraham and his
[1:09:27] [Applause]
[1:09:29] seed well praise the Lord all the
[1:09:31] Palestinians are basically it's a bunch
[1:09:33] of squatters don't you understand what's
[1:09:36] the natural parallel the spiritual don't
[1:09:38] you understand to see how our
[1:09:40] government's got that if you leave an
[1:09:42] apartment or you leave a building or you
[1:09:44] leave a house and you leave it vacant
[1:09:46] for so long squatters can come in and
[1:09:49] move into your house and they've got
[1:09:51] more rights than you do that's our
[1:09:53] government that's in charge making all
[1:09:56] the laws and the rules well it's the
[1:09:58] same way the devil is trying to do to
[1:10:00] the people of Israel and telling them
[1:10:03] hey you all left out of here 2,000 years
[1:10:05] ago and now this land belongs to us it
[1:10:09] belongs to a Jew as long as there's one
[1:10:11] alive it belongs to the people of Israel
[1:10:15] because God said this land is yours well
[1:10:19] let me say the same thing to us the
[1:10:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ
[1:10:25] being the same yesterday today and
[1:10:27] forever that is our land is that our
[1:10:30] land that is our inheritance well the
[1:10:33] devil say you got away from it yeah to
[1:10:36] our shame we did get away from it but
[1:10:38] we're back home amen we are back home we
[1:10:42] are not letting go of our
[1:10:48] land oh my but now remember God knew
[1:10:53] that there would be a time that the
[1:10:55] prophetic clock would start
[1:11:04] again that he would start
[1:11:08] moving and the hands would start moving
[1:11:11] with him notice in Jeremiah
[1:11:14] 231 W be unto the
[1:11:17] pastors that destroy and Scatter the
[1:11:21] Sheep of my pastor sayith the Lord
[1:11:26] therefore thus sayeth the Lord God of
[1:11:28] Israel against the
[1:11:30] pastors that Feed My
[1:11:33] People ye have scattered my flock let me
[1:11:38] say this is not just pertinent to the
[1:11:39] Old Testament but it's pertinent to the
[1:11:42] new we be preachers around this message
[1:11:45] that divide the people of God and put
[1:11:49] them fussing and fighting and arguing
[1:11:51] and dividing over this Doctrine and this
[1:11:54] issue and that issue you come on
[1:11:56] somebody this is what God said to them
[1:11:59] kind of preachers God puts a
[1:12:03] woe

[1:12:15] by preachers that have introduced all
[1:12:18] types of false Doctrine the seven
[1:12:20] Thunders divided us perusia divided us

[1:12:32] Eternal Word of God every preacher that
[1:12:34] divides God's flock if he don't repent
[1:12:37] and make right that thing he will walk
[1:12:40] Before the Throne of God expecting a
[1:12:42] reward one day and God will judge him
[1:12:46] with a
[1:12:48] woe oh my because he used his pull pit
[1:12:52] to divide the people of God I was
[1:12:54] somebody who would preach with me
[1:12:55] tonight we want to damnn the
[1:12:57] denominations and say they're going to
[1:12:59] hell and we're just as divided as they

[1:23:37] somebody so God said here ye the word of
[1:23:40] the Lord ye
[1:23:43] nations he that scattered Israel will
[1:23:47] gather him and keep him as a
[1:23:51] Shepherd does his flock
[1:23:55] Ezekiel 11:17 therefore say thus sayith
[1:23:58] the Lord
[1:23:59] God I will even gather you from the

[1:24:31] Rome
[1:24:35] Rome it was one of the great Emperors
[1:24:38] because the Jews had caus him such
[1:24:42] problems he wanted to change the
[1:24:45] land from the name of
[1:24:51] Israel to a Roman rendition of what we
[1:24:54] call
[1:24:56] Palestine you see Rome
[1:24:59] specializes in changing
[1:25:02] names and titles and so
[1:25:05] on so they hated water baptism in the
[1:25:08] name of the Lord
[1:25:11] Jesus so they changed that to father son
[1:25:14] Holy Ghost but as you know we don't use
[1:25:18] titles we use the
[1:25:21] name so the land over there according to
[1:25:25] God is the land of
[1:25:30] Israel

[1:25:58] what this ain't
[1:26:02] right let me ask you one question if it
[1:26:05] was a bunch of conservative Christians
[1:26:08] and they were standing up there doing
[1:26:09] this against
[1:26:11] homosexuals what do you think would
[1:26:13] happen yeah if it was a bunch of Jews
[1:26:17] that were standing up there doing this
[1:26:18] against the Muslims what do you think
[1:26:21] would happen you know what would happen
[1:26:23] then throw them in jail

[1:28:00] land y s ARA
[1:28:03] Fett your
[1:28:08] land Mark Twain visited
[1:28:11] Palestine in
[1:28:14] 1871 he documented the Desolation and
[1:28:17] UNP nature of
[1:28:20] Palestine as a hopeless dreary
[1:28:25] heartbroken
[1:28:28] land why the right inhabitants weren't
[1:28:33] there now some of you I'm only to get
[1:28:35] mad so go ahead and take your mad pill
[1:28:37] now you take all the message Believers
[1:28:40] out of this message every book and every
[1:28:43] tape we've got every picture everything
[1:28:45] that pertains to the message itself does
[1:28:47] not have life but you know what gives
[1:28:50] life you know what the fundamental
[1:28:51] Foundation of it is it's them pillars
[1:28:54] that Paul wrote about it's the Believers
[1:28:56] in the church that holds that truth up
[1:28:59] oh thank God for the tapes thank god oh
[1:29:01] yes I love and praise the Lord but the
[1:29:04] tapes are not the reality of this
[1:29:06] message the reality of this message is
[1:29:10] God taking this message and living in
[1:29:12] human beings the Rapture is not for the
[1:29:16] tapes the Rapture is not for your Bible
[1:29:19] the Rapture is for you
[1:29:23] [Applause]
[1:29:27] Oh Glory so when the people leave the
[1:29:31] land the land becomes
[1:29:35] desolate now this is
[1:29:37] 1871 whenever he was there and he
[1:29:39] describes it as a hopeless dreary
[1:29:44] heartbroken land on the approach to
[1:29:47] Jerusalem that was hardly a tree or a
[1:29:52] shrub anywhere
[1:29:54] where even the Olive Tree and the cactus
[1:29:59] those Fast Friends of a worthless soil
[1:30:03] had almost
[1:30:05] deserted the country that's pretty bad
[1:30:08] when a cactus says I'm out of
[1:30:16] here don't you understand friends don't
[1:30:19] you understand when the Rapture takes
[1:30:21] place and those that have just been
[1:30:24] around the framework or the outskirts of
[1:30:27] the message they've hung around it for
[1:30:30] years and years and never really got in
[1:30:31] because there's too much reproach don't
[1:30:34] you understand they'll still have their
[1:30:36] tapes they'll still go to church if they
[1:30:38] believe in going to church and they'll
[1:30:40] still do all the things that they did
[1:30:43] but even the cactus will have left the
[1:30:45] Olive Tree will be
[1:30:47] gone the message will be desent
[1:30:55] amen sir well either you believe that or
[1:30:58] you believe the Rapture is Jesus coming
[1:31:00] down here and he went away to prepare
[1:31:03] taper acts in heaven behold I go away to
[1:31:06] prepare taper acts in heaven if I go
[1:31:08] away I will come again and receive your
[1:31:10] tapes unto myself that where I am there
[1:31:12] your tapes may be also sir brother
[1:31:18] sir our message our
[1:31:21] church Jeffersonville voice voice of God
[1:31:24] all of our church buildings will turn
[1:31:27] into Atomic
[1:31:32] F some of these poor message people that
[1:31:35] have spent their entire life fighting
[1:31:38] preachers will turn into
[1:31:41] Atomic
[1:31:48] water Fredick hasselquist
[1:31:54] whenever I don't like the name Reagan I
[1:31:56] read names like this and I think you
[1:31:58] know what Reagan ain't so bad after
[1:32:01] all would you imagine introducing your
[1:32:03] pastor brother Fredick hasselquist will
[1:32:07] now come and preach for us a Swedish
[1:32:10] doctor and naturalist visited the
[1:32:12] today's Israel Gaza West Bank and he
[1:32:14] wrote that the holy land is
[1:32:17] uncultivated and almost uninhabited
[1:32:20] don't you see why we needed a message
[1:32:24] the message of Pentecost the message of
[1:32:27] Hebrews
[1:32:28] 138 that's what it was brother Johnson
[1:32:33] uncultivated
[1:32:35] uninhabited and God sent a prophet with
[1:32:37] a message to put inhabitants back in
[1:32:41] Acts two to put inhabitants back in Acts
[1:32:45] 4 to put inhabitants back in Hebrews 138
[1:32:49] and don't you see what the devil's
[1:32:50] trying to do he hates it because there's
[1:32:53] in inhabitants in the land of Acts 24
[1:32:56] again there's inhabitants in the land of
[1:32:58] Hebrews 1day he can't stand
[1:33:06] it the primary source of income to the
[1:33:09] Turkish Administration it was the Turks
[1:33:12] at this time that was controlling the
[1:33:15] land it's the fees charged to the
[1:33:17] visitors 4,000 European Greek and
[1:33:20] Armenian visitors yearly along with an
[1:33:21] equal number of Jews from all quarters
[1:33:24] of the world he estimates the Jewish
[1:33:27] population of Jerusalem to be
[1:33:33] 20,000 ah now remember this is during
[1:33:37] the same time time frame
[1:33:38] 1874 that Mark train went in
[1:33:42] 1871 ah so minute I I I thought that
[1:33:46] that all the Jews left you believed a
[1:33:50] lie that's what they want you to believe
[1:33:56] that way it don't make the Palestinians
[1:33:59] squatters it makes Jew squatters and
[1:34:03] that's what they want to tell you you're
[1:34:04] squatting on this Holy Ghost Land no I
[1:34:07] ain't I live here I got a title de I got
[1:34:12] a right to be here come on somebody I
[1:34:16] got a right to pray I've got a right to
[1:34:19] pray sometime till I get so far out I
[1:34:23] don't even talk talking English no
[1:34:25] more I got a right praise the Lord to
[1:34:28] lay my hands on the sick and watch God
[1:34:31] heal them I've got a right to experience
[1:34:34] the
[1:34:36] supernatural I am not a squatter I'm a
[1:34:47] landowner he estimates the Jewish
[1:34:50] population of Jerusalem to be 20,000
[1:34:52] surely a substantial proportion
[1:34:54] of its population while the town of
[1:34:56] Tiberius is described as half inhabited
[1:34:59] by Arabs and the other half by Jews who
[1:35:02] pay taxes to the denominations I mean to
[1:35:04] the
[1:35:06] Arabs Felix b a Christian Theologian and
[1:35:10] professor of French literature and
[1:35:12] Hebrew visited the Holy Land in
[1:35:16] 1858 I wrote a book describing it but
[1:35:20] describes a
[1:35:22] dreary Des
[1:35:25] landscape that is sparsely inhabited I
[1:35:28] hope you're running the parallel tonight
[1:35:30] in your own heart that it's like a
[1:35:32] Believer when they read the scriptures
[1:35:34] of this hour before inhabitants got into
[1:35:37] it and it's like that scripture just
[1:35:39] couldn't come alive to them yet they
[1:35:41] knew that was the word of God in Mark 16
[1:35:43] all these wonderful words of God and yet
[1:35:46] it's a desolate place there ain't nobody
[1:35:48] living there aren't you glad but God
[1:35:50] Sanctuary tonight in the building living
[1:35:51] in these scriptures
[1:35:54] oh my notice he notes that close to half
[1:35:57] of the population of Jerusalem is Jews
[1:36:00] and that a majority of the Jews in
[1:36:01] Jerusalem
[1:36:03] are oh
[1:36:05] no
[1:36:09] indigenous
[1:36:12] indigenous wow so you mean they have
[1:36:16] been there this whole
[1:36:20] time so all Jews wasn't drove out and
[1:36:23] then the poor Palestinians come in there
[1:36:25] and these poor oh mean hateful Jews they
[1:36:28] come in and drove them out of their land
[1:36:30] there's always been
[1:36:32] Jews there's always been somebody God
[1:36:35] could put his hand on in every age even
[1:36:37] if there wasn't but one man but God had
[1:36:39] a representation God was going to have a
[1:36:42] representation in the land of Jews
[1:36:45] because he knew this Palestine
[1:36:47] denominational Spirit would raise up and
[1:36:49] say you all can't have the same Holy
[1:36:51] Ghost Peter had and I say do come too
[1:36:54] late to tell me I got it how many's got
[1:36:58] it oh
[1:37:00] Glory my notice he concludes at
[1:37:04] Palestine section of the book citing
[1:37:08] that the Turks have made a desert of it
[1:37:10] where it's scarcely possible to walk
[1:37:12] without fear even the Arabs who do so
[1:37:16] now notice who made a desert out of
[1:37:20] it the
[1:37:22] Turks now Eagles but
[1:37:26] turkeys
[1:37:29] buzzards well come on now some of y'all
[1:37:32] don't don't don't look at me so funny
[1:37:34] you used to Fellowship turkeys hopefully
[1:37:36] you aren't now hopefully you're
[1:37:37] fellowshipping a little bit higher and
[1:37:39] you're climbing up but I want you to
[1:37:41] notice who turned it into this desolate
[1:37:44] place the Turks even the Arabs who dwell
[1:37:48] there do so as temporary sojourners
[1:37:53] so they're over here at one church for a
[1:37:55] while and then they go over to another
[1:37:56] church and then they're back over here
[1:37:58] and they're over there but you know what
[1:37:59] whenever Israel begin to get in there
[1:38:01] and they begin to make caboots anybody
[1:38:04] know familiar with that term caboots you
[1:38:06] don't what it is okay they would go in
[1:38:07] and they lock in a certain spot and they
[1:38:10] pull all their money together and that
[1:38:12] everybody lives from that Community
[1:38:14] things sort of like the book of Acts so
[1:38:16] they all come in there and they work
[1:38:18] together they slave together they labor
[1:38:21] together they fight together they do
[1:38:23] whatever they had to do it's a kaboot
[1:38:24] they still happen today we visited some
[1:38:26] whenever we were there actually stayed
[1:38:28] in one whenever we were there so it's a
[1:38:31] community to where they all come
[1:38:33] together and they live and they were but
[1:38:35] the Arab church members they just hopped
[1:38:37] around from here and there and there oh
[1:38:39] I don't believe in going to church I I
[1:38:41] don't need nobody I don't need nobody
[1:38:43] you could get your throat cut by living
[1:38:46] that way amongst them
[1:38:49] Arabs you could get your spiritual water
[1:38:51] taken from me by all the demons such
[1:38:53] around you believe it or not we need one
[1:38:56] another come on somebody I'll tell you
[1:38:59] what we need too we need visiting
[1:39:01] ministers to come in and preach to us as
[1:39:03] well come on Saints oh brother Donnie
[1:39:05] you're my favorite preacher well that's
[1:39:07] all well and good but we need other men
[1:39:09] that'll come in and preach to us
[1:39:12] too the late American Economist Fred M
[1:39:16] gosell published in an article titled
[1:39:18] the population of Palestine Circa 1875
[1:39:21] in 1979 in the jour Middle Eastern
[1:39:24] studies in it Gothel refers to the
[1:39:26] writings and reports of 13 listen now
[1:39:29] additional mid 19th century observers
[1:39:33] including James Finn the British Council
[1:39:35] for Palestine all of them he writes
[1:39:38] report that Palestine is a desolate
[1:39:43] underpopulated
[1:39:47] place the problem was the Blessed people
[1:39:52] wasn't in the land
[1:39:54] so God could start blessing the land for
[1:39:58] the Blessed
[1:39:59] people so you see if the land itself is
[1:40:02] the only thing then the Arabs and the
[1:40:04] Turks and whoever ever they could be
[1:40:05] there man they don't have do nothing the
[1:40:06] land flowing of milk and honey that is
[1:40:08] not exactly true that's right amen when
[1:40:13] you go there and look around yourself
[1:40:15] and you think Lord what in the world did
[1:40:17] you see in this place and then you hold
[1:40:20] up a mirror and say I guess the same
[1:40:22] thing you saw in this place yeah when
[1:40:24] you look around let me tell you
[1:40:25] something there's places in Tennessee
[1:40:27] and Kentucky that is way more beautiful
[1:40:30] than Israel I mean some of them places
[1:40:32] are as bare and dry and Barren as they
[1:40:35] can be don't you know why CZ the people
[1:40:38] ain't in the right place so when the
[1:40:40] people's where they need to be then God
[1:40:43] starts pouring down the rain and God
[1:40:46] sends the Dew and God said so it's not
[1:40:48] like to the land oh the word is blessed
[1:40:51] the word is Holy the word is wonderful
[1:40:54] but the word can only be personified
[1:40:57] when people get into the word and then
[1:41:00] God goes to blessing the people and the
[1:41:02] word becomes magnified the word becomes
[1:41:11] fruitful the continuity of Jewish life
[1:41:14] in the Holy Land Is Well
[1:41:17] documented the Jewish presence in
[1:41:19] Palestine did not pum it to zero after
[1:41:22] the jewi defeat by the Romans in 70 CE
[1:41:27] which is common error archaeological
[1:41:30] evidence shows that with the fall of
[1:41:33] Jerusalem the center of Jewish life in
[1:41:35] Palestine shifted to
[1:41:39] Galilee oh I love that Man From
[1:41:44] Galilee for he's done so very much for
[1:41:50] me a so it moved from the big
[1:41:52] headquarters up in Jerusalem where cfas
[1:41:55] and all the rest of those guys were down
[1:41:57] to Capernaum and Galilee where Peter
[1:42:02] James John
[1:42:05] Bartholomew but they always was Jews
[1:42:11] there an autonomous Jewish presence
[1:42:16] existed until 4:29 CE and Jews
[1:42:20] constituted a majority of the population
[1:42:23] of Palestine up until the last century
[1:42:26] now I want you to notice now the
[1:42:28] population of the Jews in
[1:42:32] 1948
[1:42:37] 76,7
[1:42:39] current
[1:42:41] population 7 million
[1:42:50] 208,000 and they have so much
[1:42:54] water they sell water to
[1:42:57] Jordan they have so much water they sell
[1:43:00] water to other Arab Nations around them
[1:43:04] and yet before they didn't hardly have
[1:43:06] enough water to grow an orange tree what
[1:43:10] the blessing returned when the Blessed
[1:43:12] people got back wo glory to God glory to
[1:43:17] God hallelujah don't you understand why
[1:43:20] it's so important for you to come to the
[1:43:21] house of God why not just important for
[1:43:24] you to come to church but for you to be
[1:43:25] in your place in Christ Jesus what could
[1:43:28] happen right here tonight if every one
[1:43:31] of us could get in our proper place
[1:43:33] there ain't no telling what God would do
[1:43:36] what but we've got to be in our place in
[1:43:38] the blessing we don't want God just to
[1:43:40] bless this building we want God to bless
[1:43:42] this pull pit bless this piano bless
[1:43:45] this carpet he'll bless us because we're
[1:43:47] here together then the blessing of God
[1:43:50] returns
[1:43:53] GL oh my sir can I have a few more
[1:43:59] minutes
[1:44:02] us
[1:44:05] anti-Semitism is at

[1:44:11] stood right here and told
[1:44:14] you after October the 7th initially the
[1:44:18] people would stand with Israel you don't

[1:44:24] remember because eventually they will
[1:44:27] turn against
[1:44:30] them what don't does that mean you're a
[1:44:32] prophet just means they got a little bit
[1:44:34] of Common

[1:47:51] anointing of a catching
[1:47:58] way the Nationwide movement has gain
[1:48:01] momentum and has taking on new strength
[1:48:04] as administrators continue to allow
[1:48:07] anti-israel demonstrations at schools

[1:48:12] Colombia Yale
[1:48:16] MIT UC Berkeley University of Southern

[1:48:37] didn't read them the prophecies I read
[1:48:39] to you tonight they don't know a bit
[1:48:41] more about their Bible than nothing I've
[1:48:43] seen on YouTube or some of these news

[1:48:47] saying means from The River To The
[1:48:50] Sea yall have heard that saying they're
[1:48:53] saying from The River To The Sea well

[1:48:59] every Jew gone from the river to the Sea
[1:49:02] they're quoting God's promise to
[1:49:05] Israel and when they go to asking all
[1:49:07] these students what does it mean they
[1:49:10] don't even know they don't even know
[1:49:13] what it means can't you see they're
[1:49:17] under this anointing and they're
[1:49:19] screaming and they're hollering and

[1:49:44] warfare is going to stop with a with a
[1:49:46] Hamas

[1:49:53] I said people's insane they don't even
[1:49:56] know what they're protesting about if
[1:49:59] they can move under an anointing like
[1:50:01] that oh how we ought to be able to move
[1:50:04] under anointing when we know what we're
[1:50:06] talking about brother Jack we know what
[1:50:08] we believe Justin we know what's been
[1:50:10] said if they can do it and they don't
[1:50:12] even know what is River to the Sea well
[1:50:16] I don't know I don't know and you should
[1:50:17] see the looks on some of their faces
[1:50:19] they're
[1:50:21] dumbfounded why
[1:50:24] pre-tribulation
[1:50:26] anointed and they say they're not moving
[1:50:29] we're not giving
[1:50:30] up until our University does this and
[1:50:33] that and the other well if they can do
[1:50:36] that what about us we're not giving up
[1:50:39] till the devil turns loose of our kids
[1:50:41] till the devil turns loose of our bodies
[1:50:44] till the devil turns loose of your
[1:50:45] husband your wife whatever it
[1:50:49] is let me
[1:50:51] close Revel Revelation
[1:50:55] 12:12 therefore Rejoice ye
[1:50:59] heavens and you that dwell in them woe
[1:51:03] unto the inhabiters of the
[1:51:05] earth and of the sea for the
[1:51:10] devil has come down unto you and listen
[1:51:13] how he
[1:51:15] descends having great
[1:51:20] wrath he is so so
[1:51:25] Furious he don't have peace on his mind
[1:51:28] he don't have love safety deaths
[1:51:33] Annihilation
[1:51:37] destruction because he
[1:51:41] knowth that he
[1:51:44] has but a short
[1:51:48] time and when the dragon saw that he was
[1:51:51] cast into the Earth
[1:51:54] he persecuted the
[1:51:55] woman which brought forth the
[1:51:59] Manchild now we know the woman in the
[1:52:01] symbolism Revelation 12 that brought
[1:52:04] forth the
[1:52:05] Manchild was the Jewish
[1:52:09] nation and whenever she brought forth a
[1:52:11] Manchild something went out of his mouth
[1:52:14] which is thickness and multitudes of
[1:52:16] people to go out and capture the
[1:52:18] Manchild which was the birth of the Lord
[1:52:21] Jesus so now here we Skip and the car
[1:52:26] picks up again you never know that this
[1:52:28] 2,000 year Span in between the first
[1:52:30] part of Revelation 12 in this 12th verse
[1:52:32] here and when the dragon saw that he was
[1:52:35] cast into the air notice the first thing
[1:52:38] that he
[1:52:39] does goes after the
[1:52:43] Jews
[1:52:45] why why has Israel been fought over so
[1:52:49] many times 55
[1:52:52] Wars been fought over that place the
[1:52:56] size of New
[1:52:59] Jersey why
[1:53:02] why because he knows he loves it and
[1:53:07] then he saying he loves he hates I don't
[1:53:11] tell you a lot about yourself yes
[1:53:14] sir notice he persecuted the woman which
[1:53:17] brought forth a Manchild and so the
[1:53:20] woman were given two wings
[1:53:23] of a great Eagle that she might find to
[1:53:24] the Wilderness into her place where
[1:53:27] she's nourished for a time and times and
[1:53:32] half time three and a half years from
[1:53:36] the face of the serpent notice his
[1:53:41] titles are interchangeable devil dragon
[1:53:47] serpent that's and the serpent cast out
[1:53:50] of his mouth water remember remember
[1:53:52] water represents thickness of multitude
[1:53:54] of people as a
[1:53:58] flood so the devil cast out of his mouth
[1:54:01] all these people on the Earth and they
[1:54:04] just started compassing the Jews oh we
[1:54:07] hate you you so much Believe It or Not
[1:54:10] there'll be some of the denominational
[1:54:12] Christians that'll join in with
[1:54:15] them but of course they'll hide behind
[1:54:17] this guys you kill Jesus you kill
[1:54:21] Jesus them Jews that'll be living during
[1:54:24] that time frame didn't kill Jesus any
[1:54:26] more than I'm to blame for slavery in
[1:54:28] the days of 1865 I ain't never owned a
[1:54:31] slave in my life so don't blame me well
[1:54:35] come on somebody didn't he all know that
[1:54:37] the largest slave owner in the state of
[1:54:39] Tennessee was a black man that's right
[1:54:41] I'd like to hear some of them talk about
[1:54:43] that I ain't never owned no slave and if
[1:54:45] slavery was legal I wouldn't want a own
[1:54:47] one I'd probably be one the truth is not
[1:54:49] but you know what don't blame me for
[1:54:51] what they done back there you cannot
[1:54:54] blame these modern day Jews whenever you
[1:54:56] crucify them yourself when the word of
[1:54:59] God is made manifest and you won't
[1:55:02] comply to that you're worse than them
[1:55:04] Jews
[1:55:05] [Applause]
[1:55:15] was if y'all want to help a poor fired
[1:55:18] preacher I'll be standing on University
[1:55:20] and the ramp there of uh I I'll stand
[1:55:23] there tomorrow that sign up there we'll
[1:55:24] work for food the serpent cast out of
[1:55:27] his mouth Waters of flood after the
[1:55:29] woman that he might cause her to be
[1:55:32] carried away isn't it amazing not Russia
[1:55:35] as soon as he comes to the Earth he does
[1:55:37] not attack Ukraine Japanese
[1:55:40] Chinese a
[1:55:43] woman and the Earth helped the woman and
[1:55:45] the Earth opened her mouth and swallowed
[1:55:47] up the flood which the Dragon cast out
[1:55:49] of his mouth and the dragon was WS with
[1:55:52] the woman and went to make war with the
[1:55:55] remnant of her seed which keep the
[1:55:58] Commandments of
[1:56:00] God and have the
[1:56:02] testimony of Jesus
[1:56:05] Christ stand let me finish you I'll just
[1:56:08] let you rest for a minute future home
[1:56:11] just a little while will be summoned
[1:56:14] then the Rapture will come a little
[1:56:15] bitty group like Enoch will be taken up
[1:56:20] then the remnant of the woman's
[1:56:23] seed that keep the Commandments of God
[1:56:27] Jews have the testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:56:33] Gentile will be hunted
[1:56:36] down like
[1:56:42] dogs so here John merges together both
[1:56:45] groups
[1:56:47] Jews and
[1:56:49] Gentiles so those who refuse to should
[1:56:52] be washed in the bloody
[1:56:55] word and they go on to their Church oh I
[1:56:58] believe Jesus I'm saved yep I believe
[1:57:00] that I believe they're saved but you
[1:57:02] don't go in the Rapture just because
[1:57:04] you're
[1:57:05] saved you got to be sealed to go in the
[1:57:09] Rapture now to be honest with you I
[1:57:11] don't understand how these Gentiles will
[1:57:14] even be able to do
[1:57:16] it if they didn't have enough victory in
[1:57:19] their lives to live a Godly sanctify IED
[1:57:23] life how in the world can they live
[1:57:26] during the time of
[1:57:28] tribulation remember the mercy seed will
[1:57:31] be
[1:57:32] Smoky there'll be no blood there won't
[1:57:35] be another person
[1:57:36] saved no more Gentiles receiving the
[1:57:39] Holy Ghost it's
[1:57:43] over and the devil go straight after the
[1:57:46] Jews and the
[1:57:49] Gentiles and they will give their life
[1:57:51] for their testimony Joel 3:2 I will also
[1:57:56] gather all nations and bring them down
[1:57:59] into a valley of
[1:58:03] Jehoshaphat and will plead with them
[1:58:06] there for my people and for my Heritage
[1:58:09] Israel whom they have scattered among
[1:58:11] the Nations and parted my
[1:58:14] land zachar Zephaniah 38 therefore will
[1:58:18] you wait upon me sayeth the Lord until
[1:58:21] the day day that I Rise Up To Thee pray
[1:58:25] for my determination is to gather the
[1:58:29] Nations that I may assemble the
[1:58:33] kingdoms so here will come
[1:58:35] Russia here will come China Iran Iraq
[1:58:42] Syria well you say what about the United
[1:58:45] States by this time the United
[1:58:49] States will have entered into the
[1:58:52] seventh
[1:58:53] Vision that God showed
[1:58:57] Elijah smolter
[1:58:59] heaps of
[1:59:02] Ashes
[1:59:06] annihilated dear
[1:59:08] God our
[1:59:11] home our homeland I'm an American I'm an
[1:59:16] American I don't say that with joy
[1:59:22] dear
[1:59:24] God to pour upon them my indignation
[1:59:26] even all my Fierce anger for all the
[1:59:29] Earth shall be devoured with a fire of
[1:59:32] my
[1:59:33] jealousy Zechariah 14:1 I'll close
[1:59:36] behold the day of the Lord
[1:59:38] cometh and thy spoil shall be divided in
[1:59:40] the midst of thee for I will gather all
[1:59:43] nations against
[1:59:45] Jerusalem to
[1:59:47] battle and the city shall be taken and
[1:59:51] the houses is rifled and the women
[1:59:54] ravished h of the city shall go forth
[1:59:57] into captivity and the residue of the
[1:59:58] people shall not be cut off from the
[2:00:01] city then shall the Lord go forth and
[2:00:05] fight against those
[2:00:07] Nations as when he fought in the day of
[2:00:10] battle this my friends is the battle of
[2:00:18] Armageddon and his feet shall stand in
[2:00:21] that day upon the the Mount of Olives
[2:00:23] which is before
[2:00:25] Jerusalem on the East and the Mount of
[2:00:27] Olives shall cleave in the midst toward
[2:00:30] the East and toward the west and there
[2:00:34] shall be a great Valley now between the
[2:00:37] Mount of Olives now and where Jerusalem
[2:00:40] is so if you're up on the Mount of
[2:00:42] Olives like this looking this way
[2:00:44] there's a valley down here now here's
[2:00:47] the Garden of Gethsemane the Church of
[2:00:48] all Nations some different tombs
[2:00:50] absalon's tomb some different things
[2:00:52] down in the valley this Valley is called
[2:00:54] the Kidron Valley then you go right up
[2:00:57] you're looking straight at the Eastern
[2:00:59] Gate the Mims buried a lot of their dead
[2:01:03] there because they believed that the
[2:01:06] Messiah would not go through a cemetery
[2:01:08] and they think he's going through the
[2:01:10] Eastern Gate so they buried all the dead
[2:01:13] there to keep him from going through the
[2:01:14] gate but he'll go through
[2:01:17] nonetheless but when he steps there like
[2:01:20] this then the Mountain will shake and an
[2:01:24] earthquake underneath his feet will
[2:01:27] create this
[2:01:29] Valley Oh Glory to
[2:01:32] God and the people of Israel will run
[2:01:35] into this Valley remember from this
[2:01:37] Valley will come forth the waters which
[2:01:41] will go forth to the hinder sea actually
[2:01:44] whenever we set up in the Millennium and
[2:01:46] the Millennium Temple is built from the
[2:01:49] Cliff of the Rock in the mountain of
[2:01:52] Olives will come forth the living
[2:01:54] streams out from under the presence of
[2:01:56] God and go to the Dead Sea and when
[2:02:00] those Rivers come down and strike the
[2:02:02] Dead
[2:02:04] Sea the Dead Sea comes to
[2:02:07] life that's the way he did dead Donnie
[2:02:10] and dead John and dead Rob and dead you
[2:02:13] and dead Jew and the Waters of Life
[2:02:15] struck you praise be to God and we were
[2:02:19] made alive
[2:02:22] and you shall flee to the Valley of the
[2:02:24] mountains for the Valley of the
[2:02:26] mountains shall reach under Asel yeah
[2:02:29] you shall flee like he fled before the
[2:02:31] earthquake and the days of Uzziah king
[2:02:35] of
[2:02:35] Judah and the Lord my God shall
[2:02:40] come

[2:08:18] of some of them there and there is when
[2:08:21] that took desert
[2:08:23] places Lord as we stood right there
[2:08:25] where where was a a kabo one of the
[2:08:28] first ones and right from the top of
[2:08:31] that place
[2:08:33] looking over at the pass that we came up
[2:08:37] and there we could see the Wilderness of
[2:08:39] sin or Zen also it's called The Very
[2:08:43] place that Moses brought the Chanel of
[2:08:45] Israel through what a what a terrible
[2:08:48] place and yet right within Rock throwing
[2:08:52] distance was a kabo and there was trees
[2:08:56] and Orchards and Gardens and
[2:09:00] plants because they got in there and
[2:09:02] labored and worked and they transformed
[2:09:06] it Lord we got a bunch of spiritual
[2:09:08] Arabs I'm afraid in the message they
[2:09:11] want the preacher to do all the praying
[2:09:12] they want him to do all the pumping and
[2:09:14] do all the irrigation and do all the
[2:09:16] watering they just live an old carnal
[2:09:18] foolish life out here in the world and
[2:09:21] expect to come to church two or three
[2:09:23] times a week and the blessing of God
[2:09:24] just be poured out on them because they
[2:09:25] come here they don't do one thing they
[2:09:28] don't put forth no effort Lord God may
[2:09:30] we leave this place tonight with a
[2:09:32] different desire Lord may we gra drag
[2:09:35] out our grabit hole may we drag out our
[2:09:37] shovel may we drag out our pump may we
[2:09:39] drag out whatever we got to do Lord I'm
[2:09:42] going to put forth an effort this is my
[2:09:43] caboots and this belongs to me and my
[2:09:45] family you entrusted us of this place
[2:09:48] Lord what can we do what can we do as a
[2:09:51] family to make our church better what
[2:09:53] can we do Lord that the blessing of God
[2:09:55] will flow on us amen are we happy coming
[2:09:58] up to our Jerusalem and sing is it Mark
[2:10:00] Twain saw
[2:10:02] it what would our message become if we
[2:10:04] listen to a lot of these people around
[2:10:06] the message and the preachers sat down
[2:10:07] and quit preaching that quit laying
[2:10:10] hands on the sick that quit making alar
[2:10:11] calls if I listen to everything a bunch
[2:10:14] of these Kneads told me to do I would
[2:10:16] never preach another sermon I'd never
[2:10:18] pray for nobody else I'd just become a
[2:10:20] puppet to some of of these man-made
[2:10:22] denominational systems I ain't going to
[2:10:24] do it Lord I've got my mtic on my back
[2:10:27] I've got my shovel under my arm I've got
[2:10:29] my scoop and I've got my 45 on one side
[2:10:31] and I've got my Uzi on the other side so

[2:16:32] we've got Apostolic times moving among
[2:16:35] us but as your Prophet said in birthing
[2:16:37] faith when he prayed he said we've got
[2:16:39] them Apostolic times moving among us but
[2:16:42] we desire to see more of it not a return
[2:16:45] to isusa street but a return back to
[2:16:49] Jerusalem
[2:16:52] hallelujah hallelujah bless the land oh
[2:16:56] God bless the land oh God and what did
[2:17:00] Israel do you gave them the invention of
[2:17:05] drip
[2:17:06] irrigation for before many farmers
[2:17:09] around the world would take great big
[2:17:11] pipes and put it out in their fields and
[2:17:13] they' pump the water and waste gallons
[2:17:16] thousands and thousands of gallons of
[2:17:18] water but like you fi y do as you told
[2:17:21] Israel in the Old Testament you will be
[2:17:24] a blessing to many and you gave the
[2:17:26] invention to drip irrigation where they
[2:17:29] put a little tiny tiny tiny small pipe
[2:17:32] down by each plant and drip drip drip
[2:17:36] drip drip and instead of wasting that
[2:17:39] water all that water goes to waste well
[2:17:41] Lord sometimes I feel like that's the
[2:17:43] way we are sometimes we get under the
[2:17:46] Fountain of the blessing of God our cup
[2:17:49] just runs over and then and other times
[2:17:51] it seems like we're hooked up to the
[2:17:53] drip irrigation of the Holy Ghost and he
[2:17:56] don't come in like a rushing Mighty Wind
[2:17:58] as it were but he gives a little bit of
[2:18:00] drip of peace and a drip of the
[2:18:02] anointing and a drip of love and a drip
[2:18:04] of this and the next thing I know is car
[2:18:07] cup is running over anyway but it's
[2:18:09] running over drip after drip after drip
[2:18:12] so Lord no matter how you send it to us
[2:18:15] father you just have your way in our
[2:18:17] life will you Lord we love you tonight
[2:18:21] Jesus we worship you father we bless
