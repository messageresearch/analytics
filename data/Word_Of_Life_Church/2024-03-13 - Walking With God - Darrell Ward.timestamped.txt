[36:33] will be said to help you and encourage
[36:34] you along the way and battling just a
[36:36] wee bit of a cold and I just trust that
[36:39] my voice don't sound like I'm in a
[36:40] barrel too bad but we pray the Lord to
[36:42] just help us tonight but if you have
[36:43] your Bibles turn with us to the book of
[36:45] 2 Corinthians want to read from 2
[36:46] Corinthians chapter 5 sorry not working
[36:50] again well praise the
[36:52] Lord amen I'm telling you if I cross the
[36:56] river and somebody hands me a mic I did
[36:58] not make
[37:03] it it happens everywhere I
[37:07] go praise the Lord praise the
[37:12] Lord God is good all the time
[37:16] amen anyway we we're going to read
[37:20] second made myself laugh we're going to
[37:22] read tonight from 2 Corinthians chapter
[37:24] 5: 7 and also from 2 Corinthians chap 6
[37:29] uh verse 16 do you love him yes amen the
[37:34] Bible says this very familiar scripture
[37:36] to us all says for we walk by faith and
[37:40] not by
[37:42] sight for we walk by faith and not by
[37:46] sight now you can walk by one or the
[37:48] other but you can't walk for both at the
[37:50] same time so you're either going to walk
[37:52] by what you see with your eye or you're
[37:54] going to walk by what you see with the
[37:55] eyes of your heart amen amen now 2
[37:58] Corinthians 6:16 says this and what
[38:02] agreement hath the temple of God with
[38:05] Idols for you are the Temple of the
[38:07] Living God as God hath said I will dwell
[38:11] in them and walk in them and I will be
[38:16] their God and they shall be my people
[38:21] amen oh myall what a wonderful statement
[38:25] that The God Who created the heavens and
[38:27] the Earth said that you would be his
[38:30] people amen that ought to make you shout
[38:32] tonight good amen do you love him you
[38:36] know in order to walk with God we have
[38:39] to agree with God for the Bible says can
[38:43] two walk together except they be agreed
[38:47] and the prophet of God said this and I
[38:49] thought it was so good he said when a
[38:50] man will walk for God and walk with God
[38:54] then God will walk with that man amen
[38:58] when a man will walk for God and walk
[39:00] with God God will walk with that man
[39:05] amen let us bow our
[39:07] heads
[39:10] Hallelujah Heavenly
[39:12] Father Thy word is
[39:15] true thank you
[39:19] Lord for loving
[39:21] us for it's written that while we were
[39:24] yet sinners you loved us Lord
[39:28] father I pray tonight that you would
[39:29] just take this simple thought and
[39:30] encourage the hearts of your people Lord
[39:33] for truly we're living in such a time of
[39:35] great Darkness but yet Lord you promised
[39:37] in this evening time that there shall be
[39:39] light God we are so grateful that we're
[39:42] a people that's been called out of the
[39:43] darkness to walk in this Marvelous Light
[39:46] bless your children tonight Lord those
[39:48] that are sick and Afflicted maybe those
[39:49] that are weary may you move among them
[39:51] Lord a great way we pray with thy
[39:53] Healing Touch tonight knowing Lord that
[39:55] you're both Creator and sustainer of Our
[39:57] Lives we commit every need into your
[39:59] hands For Your Glory bless your children
[40:01] tonight bless the little bride around
[40:02] the world we pray every Minister
[40:03] ministering tonight use them for thy
[40:05] Glory we ask as we commit oursel and
[40:07] this congregation into your hands For
[40:09] Your Glory in Jesus name God bless you
[40:12] Saints you may be seated this evening
[40:15] you know
[40:16] inspiration for a message can come in so
[40:18] many
[40:19] ways sometimes someone can make a
[40:21] comment to you and it'll just something
[40:23] will just strike your heart and it'll
[40:25] inspire you to start looking in a
[40:26] certain direction or you can be going
[40:28] down the road and you see a just a a a a
[40:30] billboard on the side of the road and
[40:32] something on that billb billboard will
[40:34] strike your heart and you'll start
[40:35] looking at a certain thought you know
[40:37] like brother Brenham who was walking
[40:39] through the woods and uh he he's seen a
[40:41] cigarette pack and laying there in the
[40:43] woods and he stopped and looked at the
[40:45] at the cigarette pack and on the side of
[40:47] it was a was a slogan a slogan on the on
[40:49] the cigarette pack and the prophet got
[40:52] an inspiration from that cigarette pack
[40:54] and he preached a powerful sermon on a
[40:56] thinking man's filter and the other day
[41:00] Aiden my grandson was over at the house
[41:03] and after he left I was coming through
[41:05] the bedroom and I bumped into one of his
[41:07] toys that he had left out while he was
[41:09] there and we had it out for him to play
[41:11] with and as I bumped into it it spoke to
[41:19] me and it said let's walk together let's
[41:23] walk together and when it said that
[41:26] something just struck my heart so
[41:27] tonight for a few minutes I'd like to
[41:30] speak on let's walk
[41:32] together Walking with God in the season
[41:36] of
[41:37] transition for you see transition means
[41:39] a period of changing from one state or
[41:42] condition to another and I believe that
[41:45] we can prove tonight by the Bible and by
[41:47] the message of the hour and by the
[41:48] conditions of the world that we are now
[41:50] living in that we are in the season of
[41:53] transition now in our scripture reading
[41:55] we find that the sons and daughter
[41:57] Daughters of God they walk by faith and
[41:59] not by sight and the prophet said a man
[42:01] or a woman that tries to walk after the
[42:03] things of the world they will never
[42:05] please God so if you try to walk after
[42:08] the world and try to walk after the
[42:09] message you will never please God and a
[42:12] person that never pleases God will never
[42:15] take a Rapture amen I said if we never
[42:18] please God we will never take a Rapture
[42:20] for the Bible said that Enoch pleased
[42:23] God and he was not because God took him
[42:26] amen but a man woman that will not look
[42:28] at the things of the world but will go
[42:29] according to the leading of the spirit
[42:31] you will find those kind of people are
[42:33] usually in the will of God Amen and
[42:36] that's the great fight tonight and it's
[42:38] always been the fight that Satan took
[42:40] the eyes of a man's head to control him
[42:42] by his head but God never chose the eyes
[42:45] of your head he chose your heart God
[42:48] wants to lead men so he made himself a
[42:51] little control tower in the midst of his
[42:53] heart so that man could be led by the
[42:55] spirit of God Amen and if there's
[42:57] something in you tonight thirsting for
[42:59] more of God if there's something in you
[43:00] tonight thirsting for a deeper walk with
[43:03] God anybody here like that tonight say
[43:04] you know brother I really desire a
[43:06] deeper walk with God then there's
[43:09] something in you that thirst that's in
[43:10] you for a deeper Walk Of God is the
[43:13] evidence that there's a deeper Walk Of
[43:14] God for you to attain to because if it
[43:17] wasn't there then you would never have
[43:19] that thirst and I want you to know that
[43:21] the thirst that's in your heart for a
[43:22] deeper walk with god did not come from
[43:25] you it came from from God he put that
[43:28] thirst on Hallelujah he put that thirst
[43:32] in your heart oh do you love you tonight
[43:35] it was put there by God now one of the
[43:38] greatest examples in the Bible that we
[43:40] have of a man walking with God is
[43:44] Enoch is Enoch and the Bible says this
[43:49] that Enoch walked with God and he was
[43:53] not for God took him oh God
[43:58] let that be said about me one day let
[44:00] that be said about you one day that he
[44:03] walked with God and he was not because
[44:06] God took him by faith Enoch was
[44:09] translated that he should not see death
[44:12] and was not found because God translated
[44:15] him for before his translation he had
[44:19] this testimony that he pleased God for
[44:23] without faith it's impossible to please
[44:25] God for he that cometh to God must
[44:27] believe that he is and a rewarder of
[44:30] them that diligently seek Him amen Faith
[44:35] we're talking about faith we've got to
[44:37] have faith we've got to have it in such
[44:39] a place till we'll be translated like
[44:41] Enoch was we of me you all of us tonight
[44:45] we must come to that kind of faith that
[44:47] we can be translated like Enoch was
[44:49] that's right he had a testimony of faith
[44:52] that he pleased God for without faith
[44:55] it's impossible to please God so you
[44:57] you've got to have the same kind of
[44:58] faith that you believe and that you know
[45:00] but you see this faith is that this
[45:02] knowing is not a head knowledge you
[45:04] don't know it well I've read a few good
[45:06] you don't know it by head knowledge but
[45:08] it's a revelation that God has given to
[45:10] you God has revealed this thing to you
[45:13] amen and that's how we know we can have
[45:15] faith in it not because of a head
[45:17] knowledge but because of a revelation
[45:19] what is faith faith is a revelation of
[45:21] the will of God for your life amen and
[45:24] so when the Revelation comes we can have
[45:26] faith that God revealed this thing to us
[45:29] because we are a part of what God is
[45:31] doing in this hour amen Jesus himself
[45:34] said I do always that which pleases the
[45:37] father that's keep his word for to
[45:40] please God we must believe his word and
[45:44] keep his word and so is it today every
[45:47] son and daughter of God in order to
[45:51] please God must keep God's
[45:55] word not the part you want to keep but
[45:59] all of
[46:00] it all of it God is not known by
[46:05] sensation come on somebody well I got a
[46:08] goosebump you can get that from an air
[46:10] conditioning God is not known by
[46:13] sensation he is not known by
[46:16] education amen well I can read the Bible
[46:18] well I know the Bible from cover to
[46:20] cover that's just being able to
[46:23] read amen God's not known by education
[46:27] God's not known by sensation but God is
[46:30] known by
[46:31] faith amen faith in his word that's the
[46:35] only way he's recognized faith faith
[46:37] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[46:39] word of God that's how it comes by the
[46:41] hearing of the word of God Enoch walked
[46:44] with God it was a walk by faith so Enoch
[46:46] must have heard something from God while
[46:49] he was walking there was something that
[46:51] God was revealing to Enoch while he was
[46:53] walking for Faith cometh by hearing and
[46:56] hearing by the word of God Amen now we
[47:00] know that Enoch believed
[47:02] God you say how do you know he believed
[47:04] that because he acted on what he
[47:07] believed he walked with God that was the
[47:10] evidence that he believed God we know
[47:12] that Noah believ God you say how do you
[47:14] know Noah beli God because he built the
[47:16] ark before one drop of rain ever
[47:21] fell amen you see when you believe
[47:24] anything when you say you believe
[47:27] anything you've got to put it into
[47:29] action or do you believe oh I believe
[47:31] brother Daryl so does the
[47:33] devil but you got to put it into action
[47:37] amen hallelujah Abraham was commanded to
[47:40] separate himself from unbelief and walk
[47:42] with God Alone instead of getting weaker
[47:45] he got
[47:46] stronger and when he was 100 year old
[47:48] and Sarah was 99 they had the baby amen
[47:52] because Abraham believed God and he
[47:54] walked with God believing that he would
[47:56] have that child out because God said
[47:59] so he never looked at his body he never
[48:02] looked at it come on somebody he wasn't
[48:04] looking with the eyes of his head he was
[48:06] believing with the eyes of his
[48:09] heart and because he didn't look at his
[48:12] body he looked to the promise he never
[48:14] got weaker he got stronger stronger amen
[48:18] he knew he would have the child because
[48:20] God said he would have the child and he
[48:22] walked with God to the manifestation of
[48:25] the promise became
[48:27] flesh he walked with God to the
[48:30] manifestation of the promise was made
[48:35] flesh amen I thought that was pretty
[48:38] good you get me amens but oh my to the
[48:42] promise of the word became flesh whose
[48:46] flesh My Flesh your
[48:50] flesh the message of the hour not just
[48:52] in book form not just in tape form not
[48:55] just in CD form not just computer uh
[48:57] computer format but the message of the
[48:59] hour made flesh in you and I that we are
[49:01] the
[49:03] [Applause]
[49:04] message Hallelujah manifested on the
[49:07] earth making him the same yesterday
[49:09] today and forever so let's look at Enoch
[49:12] for a few
[49:15] minutes and look at his walk and see
[49:19] this walk that was so pleasing to God
[49:22] that God translated him now I don't know
[49:25] about you and I but that's the kind of
[49:26] walk that I want tonight that my walk
[49:29] would be so pleasing to him that he
[49:31] would say Daryl just come on home with
[49:33] me
[49:34] buddy amen so when we look at Enoch's
[49:37] walk we start to see some things that
[49:39] are laying in the message that the
[49:40] prophet said about Enoch and one of the
[49:43] things the prophet said about Enoch was
[49:44] that Enoch was a type he was a type
[49:48] Enoch knew that he was a type and he
[49:51] knew that before the flood came that he
[49:54] had to give an example now where did
[49:57] that Revelation come
[49:59] from amen how did he know that he was
[50:03] the type that everything his life was
[50:05] doing was an antitype of a type that's
[50:08] right where did that Revelation come
[50:10] from so one afternoon it'd be coming to
[50:13] him to take a
[50:16] walk notice not one
[50:19] morning not one morning he didn't take a
[50:23] walk one morning but it was an evening
[50:25] walk amen
[50:28] Enoch was translated just before the
[50:32] tribulation let me say that again Enoch
[50:35] was raptured just before the
[50:38] tribulation and he was took up and he
[50:41] was not found because God took him the
[50:43] type of the going forth of the church
[50:46] the type of the going forth of the
[50:48] church Enoch was translated from Death
[50:51] By God's transforming power and
[50:53] transforming means the ability to bring
[50:55] about a dram dramatic change amen we
[50:58] serve a god tonight who has the ability
[51:01] to bring about a dramatic
[51:04] change
[51:07] hallelujah oh I'm so glad
[51:09] tonight someone on the other day that
[51:12] God don't heal no
[51:13] more these Church of Christ people
[51:15] believe God don't heal no more I'm sorry
[51:18] if you're God suity he can't heal I feel
[51:20] sorry for you but my God my God still
[51:23] heals he still open blinded eyes he
[51:25] still makes the come on somebody we
[51:27] serve a god tonight who has the ability
[51:30] to raise the
[51:32] dead and to change our bodies brother
[51:35] Jackie back to young men again
[51:38] Hallelujah by the transforming power of
[51:40] the almighty God hallelujah you know was
[51:45] translated by transforming power why did
[51:48] God do that what did God do that for why
[51:52] did God change his body that he wouldn't
[51:54] have to see death yeah the prophet said
[51:57] for a type of the rapturing church
[52:01] that's
[52:02] coming for the rapturing church that's
[52:05] coming God done it for a type of the
[52:08] rapturing church that's
[52:13] coming well
[52:17] Glory Elijah was the same Jesus body the
[52:21] prophet said was quickened after it was
[52:23] dead in the grave Jesus body was
[52:25] quickened by the word of God and
[52:26] transform him from a dead cold image to
[52:28] a resurrected glorified Son of God
[52:31] because the prophet said in Psalms 16:10
[52:33] if you want to put it down I will not
[52:35] suffer his sold in hell I will not
[52:37] suffer my Holy One to seek corruption
[52:39] I'll not leave his sold in hell I'll not
[52:41] suffer my Holy One to see corruption
[52:44] that word has to come to pass why God
[52:47] spoke
[52:48] it God's word planted in your heart the
[52:51] prophet said if you want to go in a
[52:53] Rapture anybody here want to go in a
[52:54] Rapture oh yeah if you want to go into
[52:58] Rapture plant the word in your heart if
[53:01] you want to be a Christian genuine place
[53:04] this word in your heart and believe it
[53:06] as it was Ezekiel said take the scroll
[53:08] and eat it up and the prophet and the
[53:10] word became the self-same the prophet
[53:13] and the word became the selfs same did
[53:15] not John the Baptist John on the alatus
[53:18] was not he the type of the
[53:20] bride and what did he do he took the
[53:23] book out of the hand of he that
[53:24] descended and what did he do with the
[53:26] book he ate the
[53:27] book and John was a type of the bride
[53:30] and the book became
[53:32] one yes sir you take and eat the
[53:35] revealed word of this hour and you and
[53:37] that word becomes
[53:39] [Applause]
[53:41] one every promise has to manifest in
[53:45] your
[53:49] flesh it's not just for the preachers to
[53:51] lay hands on the
[53:53] sick these signs shall follow them that
[53:59] believe every promise must manifest in
[54:03] our flesh
[54:05] hallelujah
[54:07] hallelujah would you let some educated
[54:11] Theologian try to pump it out of
[54:13] you just let him spray you with some of
[54:16] this carnal science and knowledge and
[54:18] education you believe what God
[54:21] said well brother D I don't really
[54:23] understand it you don't have to
[54:25] understand it just believe it he'll
[54:26] reveal it to you when you have need of
[54:29] it amen I'd rather be found believing it
[54:32] than debating it because debating it
[54:35] will never produce nothing but believ in
[54:37] it Hallelujah believe in it will open
[54:39] blinded eyes believe in it will make the
[54:42] L walk believe in it we'll take a drunk
[54:44] and make a preacher out of them by
[54:46] believe in what the word said it'll
[54:47] change our bodies
[54:49] [Applause]
[54:54] amen hallelujah
[54:56] Enoch was the type of the church he also
[55:01] typed the seventh Church
[55:07] age what age are you
[55:11] in what
[55:14] what
[55:17] seventh seventh anoch typed the seventh
[55:23] Church age Enoch walked
[55:26] as a
[55:27] reflector Enoch the prophet said was
[55:30] God's perfect reflector and type when
[55:33] God was through with him he just
[55:35] translated him he took him up the
[55:38] mechanics that he had reflected become
[55:41] the Dynamics with the spirit and took
[55:44] him
[55:46] up the mechanics of the word that he
[55:50] reflected became the Dynamics with the
[55:53] Holy Spirit and it just took him
[56:01] the word that Enoch believed Walking
[56:04] with God the mechanics of the word one
[56:08] God water baptism reing the Holy Ghost
[56:10] forgiveness of sins as though you never
[56:12] done to justification all these
[56:13] Mysteries lay in there the mechanics of
[56:16] the word became
[56:20] Dynamics he reflected that
[56:25] word
[56:27] I was listening to a man the other day
[56:28] talking about leaving the message they
[56:30] said he'd come out of the brandom cult
[56:32] and they let him speak a little bit and
[56:34] this man said I believe in one God I
[56:36] believe in water baptism in the name of
[56:37] Jesus Christ I believe in signs and
[56:39] wonders and visions and miracles and
[56:40] healings I believe in the baptism of the
[56:42] Holy Ghost I believe in one God I
[56:44] believe in the Rapture of the church and
[56:47] I'm thinking where did the prophet miss
[56:51] it you walked away from something that
[56:54] you said you you
[56:59] believed think about that friends think
[57:02] about that everything he said he
[57:04] believed was what the prophet
[57:12] preached oh God he was a reflector the
[57:16] mechanics that he reflected became the
[57:18] Dynamics with the spirit that took him
[57:21] up and we are flesh and bone of him
[57:29] amen amen listen to me there's sometime
[57:31] in your life you're going to have to
[57:32] start amening what the prophet
[57:34] said there sometime in your life you've
[57:37] got to start acknowledging what the
[57:38] prophet said well I don't understand it
[57:40] he didn't say did you understand it he
[57:41] said did you believe it and there comes
[57:43] a time that we have to start confessing
[57:45] come on friends we all the time feeding
[57:47] our enemy well I'm no good God don't
[57:49] love me you know what shamgar did every
[57:50] year every year at Harvest Time When
[57:52] they'd come in they'd slap him around
[57:53] and they'd take his his grain away from

[58:40] Abraham and God promised my daddy his
[58:43] seed shall possess the gates of his
[58:51] enemy that year he killed 600
[58:54] Philistines with a nox goat because he

[1:00:59] Masterpiece was struck that he might
[1:01:01] take the rest of them for a bride that's
[1:01:04] been reflecting him Enoch was reflecting
[1:01:08] the word that God was revealing to him
[1:01:11] as he walked with
[1:01:14] him God said Enoch let's walk
[1:01:19] together now didn't that happen sometime
[1:01:22] in our age when brother bam spoke to a
[1:01:24] storm and Reb buuk the storm and the sun
[1:01:27] came up and dried up the
[1:01:30] snow and God spoke to him and said how

[1:02:05] light amen oh my someday the church
[1:02:08] which is a type of Enoch 500 years he
[1:02:11] walked before God walking walking in the
[1:02:13] light with the testimony that everything
[1:02:16] God said he did he didn't displease him
[1:02:19] for what the Lord said to do Enoch done
[1:02:22] it Enoch just kept walking in the light
[1:02:25] till one day his feet kept getting off
[1:02:27] the ground he just kept walking He
[1:02:28] Walked on into Glory without even dying
[1:02:32] that's right God took him away because
[1:02:34] God took him away because he was walking
[1:02:37] in the light with a testimony that he
[1:02:40] walked in the light of God he just kept
[1:02:44] walking he just kept walking oh friends
[1:02:49] never put a period behind what you
[1:02:50] believe always put a comma I believe
[1:02:52] this and this and this and whatever else
[1:02:54] God in his grace would revealed to
[1:02:58] me walking the prophet said Brothers
[1:03:01] It's time we make
[1:03:03] Footprints we can't stay here in this
[1:03:05] same camp the fire is moving on let's
[1:03:08] move on from glory to glory from Bible
[1:03:10] experience to Bible experience walking
[1:03:13] in the light of the revealed word as it
[1:03:16] continues to
[1:03:19] unfold it's like that Roman Candle you
[1:03:22] light it in the fuse if you walk away
[1:03:24] you never see the end of
[1:03:26] it when that first one comes
[1:03:30] out that's the beginning of the end but
[1:03:33] you've got to stay there until all of
[1:03:36] them it just keeps poof poof poof
[1:03:42] poof continues has the seals been open
[1:03:46] yes but it continues to
[1:03:49] unfold what do you see in the seals is
[1:03:51] it just a sermon is it just a series of
[1:03:54] meetings or do you see yourself
[1:03:59] there's a man I believe I think I've
[1:04:00] told you this before but it just comes
[1:04:02] to my heart there's a man by the name of
[1:04:03] bur from New Jersey raised in the Jewish
[1:04:07] Family wore the cap did all the things
[1:04:08] that the all the
[1:04:10] ceremonies he's an award-winning Native
[1:04:13] American flute player now why would a
[1:04:16] Jew from New Jersey be an award-winning
[1:04:19] Native American flute
[1:04:22] player that don't make no
[1:04:24] sense think he'd play a harp or
[1:04:26] something you know some kind of
[1:04:29] horn why a
[1:04:31] flute why brother Fred would a New
[1:04:34] Jersey Jew been an award-winning Sue
[1:04:37] flute player playing Sue music because
[1:04:41] one day somebody come to his door with
[1:04:43] an open book and they told him you're
[1:04:46] not a Jew you're a sue Indian
[1:04:50] adopted adopted as a child from the
[1:04:53] rosebud Indian reservation and when he
[1:04:55] found out who he was when he found out
[1:04:57] his genetics you see the ability the
[1:05:00] play of the flute laid within his
[1:05:02] genetics and when he realized who he was
[1:05:05] he surrendered to what he was and he
[1:05:07] went back to the red path and the sacred
[1:05:09] way and the elders why that's what he
[1:05:12] was and one day they told me I was a
[1:05:13] drunk because my papa was cuz my uncle
[1:05:16] was cuz Uncle Harold was CU a Francis
[1:05:18] was they told me I was a drunk but one
[1:05:20] day somebody came with an open book and
[1:05:22] said that's not who you are that's not
[1:05:24] who you are you're my son while you was
[1:05:27] yet in your mother's W I called you I
[1:05:29] set you aside for such a time as
[1:05:33] this the open book revealed to us who we
[1:05:36] really
[1:05:39] are walking into the light amen the
[1:05:43] light of the revealed word as it
[1:05:45] continues to unfold from glory to glory
[1:05:50] to
[1:05:52] glory Enoch walked has an
[1:05:59] eagle all these were the things the
[1:06:01] prophet said I just dug through the
[1:06:02] message all these are things brother

[1:06:54] airplane but not the eagle the eagle was
[1:06:57] born with the ability to lift off the
[1:07:02] Earth and God never said Enoch was a
[1:07:05] lion or an ox or the face of a man he

[1:10:14] tonight I was hoping some of you would
[1:10:17] get it I'm not talking about Enoch
[1:10:21] tonight I'm talking about
[1:10:24] you
[1:10:27] I'm talking about
[1:10:30] you Enoch's walk was typing you God was
[1:10:35] showing through Enoch what he was going
[1:10:37] to
[1:10:38] do through
[1:10:43] you he was a reflector he was the light
[1:10:46] of his age reflecting the mechanics of
[1:10:48] the
[1:10:50] word the evening light is not the name
[1:10:53] of the church I'm sorry it's
[1:10:56] you Jesus said I'm the light of the
[1:10:59] world and then he turned and said you're
[1:11:00] the light of the world did he suffer
[1:11:02] from Amnesia did he forget what he said
[1:11:05] no he was giving you a
[1:11:07] revelation I'm the light of the world
[1:11:09] but you are the light of the world
[1:11:10] because I'll be in you reflecting myself
[1:11:12] through you and you shall be my people
[1:11:15] and I shall be your God and I'll walk in
[1:11:18] you Hallelujah I'll reflect myself
[1:11:21] through you that the world in 2024 will
[1:11:23] know that Jesus Christ lived lives he
[1:11:25] lives in young people he lives in
[1:11:27] Grandma he lives in Grandpa he lives in
[1:11:30] that come on somebody he lives in me he
[1:11:32] lives in
[1:11:40] you if that's true let's just look at it
[1:11:43] for a minute that let look at Enoch's
[1:11:45] walk in the season of his transition now
[1:11:50] the prophet said God is just loosening
[1:11:51] up the church everywhere getting it in
[1:11:54] order
[1:11:56] now so they can get into the Rapture
[1:11:59] he's got to give it Rapture in faith
[1:12:01] before it can go in the
[1:12:04] Rapture he's just loosing up the church
[1:12:06] everywhere getting it in order so they
[1:12:09] can get into the Rapture so that he can
[1:12:12] get into the Rapture he's got to give it
[1:12:15] rapturing Faith before it can go in the
[1:12:18] Rapture the people that are in the
[1:12:20] spirit of the last days just like they
[1:12:21] were in the days of Noah eating and
[1:12:24] drinking marrying in marriage
[1:12:26] unconcerned don't care walk around
[1:12:28] anything
[1:12:30] else as it was in the days of Noah and
[1:12:33] if you understand it right the prophet
[1:12:35] of God said that Enoch and Noah was
[1:12:37] preaching at the same
[1:12:39] time so the days of Noah when the world
[1:12:42] was in that condition it was in that
[1:12:45] season that
[1:12:46] Enoch
[1:12:49] translated it was in that season of
[1:12:52] drinking and marriage and giving in
[1:12:53] marriage and unconcerned and self-love
[1:12:56] take the place of the true love of God
[1:12:58] and earthquakes in diverse
[1:13:00] places rest unrest between nations wars
[1:13:04] and rumors of wars pestilence
[1:13:07] famines it was Enoch's day it was in his
[1:13:10] season of
[1:13:12] transition it was in that time it was in
[1:13:15] that time that uniting times and signs
[1:13:18] took place sound
[1:13:22] familiar it was during that time the
[1:13:25] prophet says you see that time that
[1:13:26] Nimrod had brought all the
[1:13:28] confederations together and made people
[1:13:29] come to Babylon and come into this great
[1:13:31] Confederation and at that time of all
[1:13:33] the evil going on between the women
[1:13:35] sexually and so forth it's at that same
[1:13:37] time that God had a witness on the earth
[1:13:40] Enoch who walked with God blameless it
[1:13:43] was during that time that this evil was
[1:13:45] on the earth when God said I'll destroy
[1:13:47] man for his heart is continually evil it
[1:13:50] was during that time that there was
[1:13:52] someone on the earth who was found
[1:13:55] blameless as though they never done
[1:14:00] [Music]
[1:14:01] it
[1:14:04] Hallelujah more than what Luther
[1:14:06] preached come on somebody a greater
[1:14:09] understanding of the word walking in the
[1:14:12] light as he reveals the light Hallelujah
[1:14:16] was in the season of transition that
[1:14:18] they were uniting herself amen he was
[1:14:22] found blameless he was found blameless
[1:14:24] and that that same time evil was
[1:14:26] appearing Angels appeared on the earth
[1:14:30] Angelic beings moved into men a very
[1:14:34] beautiful type of today as evil is
[1:14:36] appearing so is good appearing also
[1:14:39] notice back there in that evil day just
[1:14:42] before the destruction when God had a
[1:14:44] man out preaching the gospel a poor man
[1:14:47] a humble man not very much of the world
[1:14:49] but a man who had a heart to listen to
[1:14:54] God
[1:14:57] a man who had a heart to listen to God
[1:15:03] how can two walk together except they
[1:15:06] agree and there's only one thing that
[1:15:07] you and God can agree on and that's his
[1:15:15] word amen and you see we know that as it
[1:15:19] was in the days of Enoch so will it be
[1:15:22] in our day you say how do you know that
[1:15:24] because when Jesus was here he spoke
[1:15:26] more of his second coming than he did
[1:15:28] his first coming and he even gave us an
[1:15:32] understanding of what was to take place
[1:15:34] he actually prophesied of what was to
[1:15:36] take place in this day that we're living
[1:15:39] in now you'll find it in Luke 21 and
[1:15:41] they asked him saying Master when shall
[1:15:43] these things be and what shall be and
[1:15:47] what sign will there be when these
[1:15:48] things shall come to pass when will
[1:15:51] these things happen and what will be the
[1:15:53] sign
[1:15:55] that it's
[1:15:56] happening and he said take heed that you
[1:15:59] be not
[1:16:00] deceived for many shall come in my name
[1:16:02] saying I am Christ and the time draw
[1:16:05] near go ye not therefore after them but
[1:16:07] when you shall hear of wars and
[1:16:10] commotions be not
[1:16:16] terrified be not terrified for these
[1:16:20] things must first come to pass but the
[1:16:23] end is Not By and By then he said unto
[1:16:26] them Nation shall rise against nation
[1:16:29] and Kingdom against Kingdom and great
[1:16:32] earthquakes shall be in diverse places
[1:16:34] many places and famines and pestilence
[1:16:36] and fearful SES yeah ain't it something
[1:16:40] that all of a sudden our government is
[1:16:41] so interested in
[1:16:45] UFOs and brother Bon said they don't
[1:16:47] know what they are they don't know what
[1:16:49] they are but he told us what they were
[1:16:51] he said they were investigating angels
[1:16:56] amen oh
[1:16:58] god oh
[1:17:00] Hallelujah fearful signs Great Signs
[1:17:03] there shall be from heaven and there
[1:17:05] shall be signs in the Sun and in the
[1:17:07] moon and in the stars and upon the Earth
[1:17:09] the stress of nations with perplexity
[1:17:11] and the Sea waves roaring men's Hearts
[1:17:14] failing for fear and for looking after
[1:17:18] those things which are coming on the
[1:17:19] earth for the powers of Heaven shall be
[1:17:21] shaken and then shall they see the son
[1:17:23] of man coming in a cloud
[1:17:27] not
[1:17:28] clouds
[1:17:30] cloud with power and great glory and
[1:17:35] when these things begin to come to
[1:17:37] pass give up quit coming to church go to
[1:17:41] Dollywood every other weekend when these
[1:17:43] things begin to come to pass then look
[1:17:45] up lift up your hands for your
[1:17:49] Redemption draweth
[1:17:53] n
[1:17:55] and he spake unto them a parable saying
[1:17:57] behold the Fig Tree and all
[1:18:01] trees and all trees not just the Fig
[1:18:04] Tree and all trees when they shoot forth
[1:18:09] you see you know of yourself that summer

[1:21:15] when the time comes that's right for
[1:21:18] things to happen yeah season is right

[1:21:46] is right he'll
[1:21:48] come with the season when the times
[1:21:50] comes it's right for things to happen he
[1:21:52] said do you believe that the time came
[1:21:54] one time for God to destroy the world
[1:21:55] with water and he sent a man by the name
[1:21:57] of Noah and God got the world ready for
[1:22:00] judgment the time came for Noah to go in
[1:22:02] the ark look Noah could not go into the
[1:22:04] ark before God was ready for him to go
[1:22:07] but when the season came for go for Noah
[1:22:09] to go into the ark God shot shut the
[1:22:12] door behind
[1:22:15] Noah he couldn't go in until the season
[1:22:18] was right but when the season was right
[1:22:21] he could go and he never shut the door
[1:22:25] God did God did so Prophet said you see
[1:22:28] we find that Enoch was a seventh from
[1:22:31] Adam and the seventh Church age is a
[1:22:34] seventh from the alpha BR the first
[1:22:38] church
[1:22:40] age Enoch was the Sabbath from Adam
[1:22:44] which is a type of the church ages now
[1:22:45] all the rest of the six men before him
[1:22:47] died but Enoch was translated Enoch was
[1:22:50] raptured the seventh so it's the seventh
[1:22:52] Church age that takes the Rapture now
[1:22:56] there's no doubt we're in the seventh
[1:22:58] Church age we all know it it's the
[1:23:00] seventh Church age that takes the
[1:23:01] Rapture all other six died but Enoch was
[1:23:04] translated because he was not found God
[1:23:07] took him but Enoch raptured was the type
[1:23:09] of all the rest of them dying but at the
[1:23:11] end time
[1:23:12] bride will be called out the rapturing
[1:23:16] without death will be called out of the
[1:23:19] seventh Church
[1:23:22] age and we are now bearing record of
[1:23:26] that
[1:23:30] age we are now bearing record of that
[1:23:34] age as it was in the days of Enoch so is
[1:23:36] it in the days of the Bride right we are
[1:23:40] now bearing record of that age as Enoch
[1:23:43] was a seven from Adam took a Rapture he
[1:23:45] did not die so the seventh Church age
[1:23:48] will take a
[1:23:50] Rapture there'll be people on the Earth
[1:23:53] by the transforming power of of God will
[1:23:55] become about a dramatic
[1:23:57] change and in a moment and the twinkling
[1:23:59] of an eye will'll be young
[1:24:03] again
[1:24:05] hallu
[1:24:08] Hall the season of
[1:24:12] transition the season of
[1:24:16] transition stand up there where Enoch
[1:24:18] did my he took a stroll one afternoon
[1:24:21] with God and walked on home with him
[1:24:23] don't just to come back Hallelujah not
[1:24:25] one morning one evening the Rapture of
[1:24:28] the Resurrection he had a testimony that
[1:24:30] he pleased God because he believe God
[1:24:33] and that's what we need and that's what
[1:24:35] we want and that's what we
[1:24:37] have you're just afraid to use
[1:24:41] it but it's time we get away from this
[1:24:44] fear and from this scar BR B said I
[1:24:47] didn't come out I didn't come to mix up
[1:24:48] a Doctrine I come to straighten one out
[1:24:50] to get away from this fear and from the
[1:24:52] scare that you don't know who you are he
[1:24:54] said you're not going to be you are now
[1:24:56] Sons and Daughters of God you always
[1:24:58] were Sons and Daughters of God it's time
[1:25:00] we get away from this fear and from this
[1:25:02] skar and start saying what he said about
[1:25:04] us come on somebody there's nothing
[1:25:07] wrong with saying what the word said as
[1:25:09] a matter of fact everything else is true
[1:25:11] he said let every man's lie let every
[1:25:13] man's word be a lie but let mine be
[1:25:16] true amen let every man's word be alive
[1:25:20] but let my word be true heavens and
[1:25:22] earth will pass away but my word word
[1:25:24] shall not pass
[1:25:27] away that's what we need that's what we
[1:25:30] want that's what we
[1:25:32] have you're just afraid to use it but I
[1:25:36] say do not be afraid to exercise your
[1:25:38] god-given rights after all this is the
[1:25:41] age of people's rights I
[1:25:44] did who you going to preach with me I
[1:25:46] don't
[1:25:49] one a predestinated word for the season
[1:25:53] a predestin ated word for the season
[1:25:56] that God would hold a word back for a
[1:25:59] certain season before he would let it be
[1:26:03] released that's why Paul never mentioned
[1:26:05] the seals it wasn't the
[1:26:08] season but in a predestinated time God
[1:26:11] would give a predestinated word to a
[1:26:13] predestinated people that they would
[1:26:15] take that word and eat that word and
[1:26:17] become that word and manifest that word
[1:26:20] and the word would be Flesh on the earth
[1:26:21] once again which would be Jesus Christ
[1:26:23] Hallelujah
[1:26:24] in his bride fulfilling the promise of
[1:26:26] the last day when he said a little while

[1:37:01] comes from your mama that's why some
[1:37:03] people see your mama other people they

[1:37:18] and a half% Native American got all this
[1:37:20] and then my brother he would have maybe
[1:37:22] something else I'll be 40% Irish and he
[1:37:25] might be 40% English but we're brothers
[1:37:27] because he got more of bomas it lean
[1:37:30] more to her than you know how and then
[1:37:33] when I got to looking at I thought the
[1:37:34] natural types of spiritual so 50% of my
[1:37:37] spiritual DNA comes from God my
[1:37:41] father and then I found a quote where
[1:37:43] brother B said we drink from the breast
[1:37:44] of Eli and we're birthed by the Breath
[1:37:46] of God so he said you see God is your
[1:37:48] mama so I get 50% of my spiritual DNA
[1:37:51] comes from my daddy and 50% of it come
[1:37:53] from a
[1:37:59] mama then what does that make us his
[1:38:05] seed do you
[1:38:07] love do you
[1:38:10] love what an agreement that the temple
[1:38:12] of God have with Idols you are the
[1:38:14] Temple of the Living God as God said I
[1:38:16] will dwell in them and I will walk in
[1:38:19] them he doesn't want just to walk above
[1:38:21] us or with us he wants to walk in
[1:38:26] us that day you'll know that I'm in the
[1:38:28] Father the father and me and I and you
[1:38:30] and you and me God in his people
[1:38:32] manifesting himself God walking in his
[1:38:36] people in the season of

[1:38:52] tonight that thirst in your heart for
[1:38:54] more of God was not put there by you it

[1:39:01] tonight we know that we can obtain it
[1:39:03] because that desire is there if you
[1:39:04] didn't want that if there was no way to
[1:39:06] obtain that the desire wouldn't be there
[1:39:07] but the very fact that each of us stand
[1:39:09] there tonight and say these things these
[1:39:11] quotes look 99% of this message is quote
