TRANSCRIPT
========================================
What is the expected result for the gospel? What is he trying to do? What does he want from the gospel? What does he want it to do in our life? Is it supposed to make life easy? Is it supposed to make our life more convenient? Is it supposed to to make us win every single battle that we face? What is the purpose? What is the outcome that he that he desires for our life? Is it to give us a greater knowledge of his word? Is that what the the gospel is about? Just to give us more knowledge in our minds. Is it did did he send a message in this last day for to give us a a greater faith in the supernatural and and and the way the the brother would just relay and we would see in his ministry just the mindblowing supernatural that lived in this brother's life and the greatest healing ministry since the Lord Jesus Christ himself. Is it just to provide us with the social structure of people that we fellowship with, people that we hang out with, people that that we just we we uh these are our people that that just this is our group. This is who we are. Is that the purpose of the gospel? Every one of them things is good. Nothing wrong with them. We need them. But the purpose of the gospel is to call the elect of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's to bring deliverance to the people of God. It is to change lives of the people of God. That is the very purpose of this gospel. [panting] What effect is it supposed to be having on my life, on your life? Is it to make us more spiritual as we see it? Because I'll be honest with you, life sometimes just feels like life. You know, I go to church. Um I worship the Lord. I feed on the word. We go to work. We we we do our jobs, we spend time with our family, and it just seems like just m uh problems on top of problems. It just seems like life. So what is is it it the scripture even says that all things work together for our good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is and and we think all things working for good. You would think that that would bring perfect peace in our home all the time. Is it, you know, uh, you would think that all of our loved ones would be saved and they they wouldn't have loved ones tonight out in the world or out in in in false beliefs and [panting] is it is it just to provide us with a healthy body? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; See friend, his view of good is so very different from our view of good. &gt;&gt; See, he thinks with a mind that is eternal. He thinks on the eternal. His love is an elective eternal love. And he and he works with that in mind. He he works in your life with that in mind. And he is willing to sacrifice if if that if necessary some some a little bit of peace and a little bit of comfort in our lives if that's what it takes to work what he's trying to work in your life to make you what he wants and he desires for you to be. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; We we as us as humans, we're so bound by time and everything we do, we think about the American dream, you know, and it's all about go we we're taught as a kid you you go through school and and and and you do your best to make the grades and then you go to college and and and then after that you get the job and you buy the house and you get married and everything is based on a timeline. That's how our minds work and and we're always working toward that. His mind doesn't go that way. He knows the beginning from the end. &gt;&gt; He knows what we need and that's good. And what we need is not always convenient. Most of the time it's not convenient. &gt;&gt; I read this week or Brother Brandham said that a church that I can't remember his exact wording, but a church that is not hurting is not a church of God. &gt;&gt; We've got to go through things. [sighs] &gt;&gt; Why does it feel like we lose so many battles? And how can that possibly serve his purpose? &gt;&gt; So much loss, it seems like, has been amplified in our lives in the last few years. You know, so many friends that we love and uh and family that we love and we have prayed for and we've talked to and we've witnessed to and and live the life in front of them. We've watched them turn and walk away from his word and um leaving the message. We and so many of us have dealt with the loss of loved ones and and people that were so so dear to our heart and people that believed him, people that trusted him, real believers, and watched them just watched him just take them. It seems at times like he just takes and takes. I'm just going to be real with you for a minute. It feels like it's not. We know it's not true, but it feels like he just takes and he takes and he breaks us and he breaks us time and time again. Negative reports everywhere we turn. I promise you we're going to turn this. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we feel like Job while you know, you go to the doctor, you and he's and I I I was at the doctor's office uh having him check my having him check my shoulder and we're going to proceed with the shoulder surgery. And then well that turned into hey also you got before we can do the shoulder surgery we got to work on your neck and actually probably before we need to work on your neck we really need to work on your low back your spine is shifting it's like Job you know it's like while he yet spake another one came running and that's what life feels like sometime you're going through the fire you're going through things that are so hard and and literally while you're going through it another thing and another thing and another thing comes and there's a reason behind it because he is molding something in you. &gt;&gt; He is making a lady that is that is that is worthy to stand beside of him to judge the world with him to reign with him or an enlex lady with a special character. Character does not come easy. It's hard &gt;&gt; character is a victory. You've got to fight for it &gt;&gt; when it comes. If you want to just tuck tail and run, you will never get there. &gt;&gt; I believe he's leading us to a place to where we just no longer just rely on just faith alone, but we trust him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When it don't work out like we thought it would, it don't work out like we prayed that it would. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God, I trust you. If you lead me, if you lead me to my grave, I will trust you. Yes. &gt;&gt; I don't understand what he's doing in so many of our lives. I don't need to understand it. I know what he's doing. &gt;&gt; He is making us. We pray and he's silent. Nothing moves. Just wonder, do you not hear me anymore? Trust is born through those quiet times when you hear nothing. You feel nothing. But I know him. I know the type of man that he is. And I'm going to hold on to him. And I'm going to follow him regardless. &gt;&gt; Have we somehow gotten out of line with this purpose to cause this? [panting and sighs] &gt;&gt; I told my wife and kids, and I got corrected by them, too. I was like, I feel like I'm cursed. I feel like everything that I touch blows up in my face. Let me tell you right off that is not God that is telling you that &gt;&gt; he does not curse his children. He allows things to come but it's the enemy that steps in and tries to tell you that he's got something against you. Tries to tell you that you're cursed. [sighs] [gasps] &gt;&gt; He wants to cause us to question the love of our God. Remind yourself in those moments who your [screaming] God is. He is the same savior, healer, deliverer, giver of peace, giver of joy &gt;&gt; that he always was. Remember what he has done for you as an individual when you were walking through the fire. He is the same God that called you. He is the same God that delivered you. He is the same God that has healed your body so many times. He is the same God that opened your eyes to his word. He has not changed. [panting] [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; Remember who you are, sons and daughters of God. [panting] You're not cursed. You are highly favored. That is why the fire has been turned up in your life. &gt;&gt; [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; You are where you are right now because he has a purpose for your life. He is making something out of you. He is changing you. [sighs] [gasps] Amen. Amen. Why did God become a man? I'm going to answer. We're going to answer this just by asking a question. Why did he become a man? Why did God create a blood cell in in the womb of Mary to be protected in the womb of a woman who was in need of salvation? &gt;&gt; Born. He was born by hard labor just like every single one of us were to grow up and be taught by a woman to live a [screaming] life of hardship. &gt;&gt; Almighty God in flesh produced a life of hardship. &gt;&gt; I hope somebody's hearing me tonight. &gt;&gt; He lived a life of poverty. He was not a wealthy man. [panting] &gt;&gt; He was homeless. He had no place to lay his head. &gt;&gt; The scripture says that he was undesirable. There was nothing that you would look at him and say, "I desire this man. I desire to be like this man." [snorts] Rumors of illegitimate birth hanging over his head. He was despised and rejected of men. &gt;&gt; A man of sorrows. What a what a description. A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. Him and grief were well were well acquainted. [panting] He knew what it was like to be alone. He knew what it was like. [sighs] &gt;&gt; See, Jesus was being shaped into something. [sighs] He was being shaped into the our intercessor [snorts] &gt;&gt; in order to intercede for me. He had to feel what I feel. &gt;&gt; He had to fight what I fight. He felt the pull so strong that it hurt. Just like me and just like you. Come on. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 2 says that for in that he himself suffered being tempted. You ever suffer with something that hurts bad? He was so pulled at him. Certain things pulled at him so hard you think it didn't pull on him when Satan offered him an easier way. &gt;&gt; Brother says, you see, he himself suffered. He learned obedience by the things that he suffered. He was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered. Hebrews chapter 5, though he were a son, yet he learned obedience by the things that he suffered. And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto them that obey him. In plain language, the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering. And according to Paul, he has left a measure of suffering that for his church that they too by their faith while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection. If God made flesh had to go through this, if he had to walk through the fire, how do we think that we can possibly get there another way? How do we think that we can reign by his side and to be able to be worthy to judge by his side? &gt;&gt; Take courage. Take encouragement, friends. [panting] He is working on you to prepare you to be his bride. [sighs] Think it not strange concerning the fiery trials that you go through. We must have character to be fit to judge. See, Jesus understood his purpose. He understood it. He found his purpose just like us. He found it in the word. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 4 after he'd been Jesus had gone to the river and and the spirit had descended on him and he goes into the to the mountain for 40 days to be tempted. He he comes out and he goes into the temple and the the book was delivered to him. Jesus took the book and he and he opened to the place where it said the spirit of the Lord is upon me &gt;&gt; because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He had sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, the recovering of sight to the blind, and to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. He then closed the book, gave it back to the minister, and he said, "This day, this scripture is fulfilled in your ears." You see, understanding his purpose gave Jesus, it released the power to walk in it. You see within him was gold. [snorts] There were attributes that he purposed to reveal to his children such as savior, healer, deliverer, etc. [panting] Brother went so far to say God being a savior, it was necessary that he predestinate a man that would require salvation in order to give himself a reason and purpose of being. You see, God has to have a sense of purpose just like we do. &gt;&gt; And we give him that sense of purpose. &gt;&gt; He exists for this purpose. He lives for this purpose. He lives for the opportunity to change our lives. He lives for the opportunity to set us free. &gt;&gt; Amen. [sighs and panting] He exists for his purpose. He is consumed by his purpose. And he went out fulfilling his purpose. Calling the elect of God from all walks of life from fishermen and tradesmen to prostitutes and and whatever more. He went out calling the elect of God. Amen. healing the sick and the afflicted. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he lives to heal his children. He exists to bring deliverance to us. &gt;&gt; I know that might be simple. I've been told that I'm simple. I'm too simple. But if I ever get so so big that this does not matter to me anymore, God help me. &gt;&gt; Because he this was his purpose. This is why he came. This is why the gospel existed back then and that is why it exists today &gt;&gt; to change our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To bring deliverance to the captives. I think about the little woman found in adultery. Life so bound by sin. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I can relate so well cuz you feel so dirty and so hopeless and there's no way that you could possibly be welcome. And the way that he stepped in and changed that little woman's life and when he knelt down and wrote in the sand and then stands up and says,"Woman, where are your accusers?" And he exists. He lives to change our lives. That's what he works on continually. He is consumed by his love for his elect. &gt;&gt; He lives to bring liberty to the oppressed. &gt;&gt; I think about brother how brother Daryl even brought it up the last time he spoke about the little woman with the issue of blood. Now, she needed healing in her body, but that wasn't the worst part that that little lady had to go through. Could you imagine having to live in a society where every time you came up near people, you have to call out unclean, unclean. &gt;&gt; She was a cast out and a reject by society. Can you imagine how that must have felt in that woman's mind? But again, as I said, he exists for the opportunity and he waited until the perfect opportunity to step in that woman's life. &gt;&gt; He knew what his purpose was and it gave him power to fulfill his purpose. The scripture has said, we have been told that there will be a bride without spot or wrinkle. And now I think to myself, now how in the world can it be possible? Because I know me. [snorts] How could he ever see me in such a way? [sighs] You need to understand who you are. We are not just someone who is here to live a life and die and that's the end of us. We are here to fulfill the purpose of God. He is he is longing for a sweetheart. &gt;&gt; [sighs] [panting] &gt;&gt; We are the sweetheart of God. He has said there would be a bride and nothing will stop him. &gt;&gt; Nothing will stop him. Not your failures, not your weakness. You cannot felt God so bad. &gt;&gt; That he says, "I'm done with you." &gt;&gt; I think about the Apostle Peter was told he was going to deny the Lord. He said, "I'm not going to do it." He He argued with God and said, "No, I won't." &gt;&gt; And then he denies him three times and he the crows and he runs away in shame. He looked like he was done. But then when the Lord Jesus rose and those sisters see him, he said, and his message to him was, "Go tell my disciples." &gt;&gt; And Peter, &gt;&gt; he singled him out. He was letting him know, "You cannot fall so far from me that I will not step back in and redeem you. You cannot be so weak that he's afraid to work in your life. [panting] [snorts] Amen. We are being prepared to become him. &gt;&gt; Think about that for a minute. Jesus was being prepared all of his life to be led to the cross to be crucified to have his body torn apart. Brother Brandham said God took him to Calvary and tore him apart. &gt;&gt; He sent the body the body goes to the grave. The spirit goes in. He went into hell or he so went into hell. In the spirit he sent back upon the believer. He tore him apart because it was his purpose. &gt;&gt; We're not altogether that different. &gt;&gt; See, we the potter is working on each of our lives tonight. and he's working and he shapes and he shapes and he's molding the clay into this image. He's looking for himself. He's looking to see himself. And as he works on this clay, if he sees something that that just won't cut it, just takes his hands &gt;&gt; and just crushes that clay. And my goodness, it hurts when he crushes the clay and he presses it. and he presses it through these fiery hard trials of life and he sets it up again. It's not quite right. And he takes the clay and he breaks it apart again &gt;&gt; and he presses it and he presses it because he is looking for his image and he will break it apart and remold it as many times as it takes. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; He is not a quitter. &gt;&gt; Did you hear what I just said? Our God is [screaming] not a quitter. He started this work and he will complete this work. &gt;&gt; You see, he understands how so many of you feel right now. So broken. You feel forsaken by God. Just like him hanging on the cross crying, "My God, [screaming] my God, why have you forsaken me?" afraid just like me and you. &gt;&gt; He understands where you are right now. [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; Take courage to know there ain't nothing wrong with you. It's because you're highly favored and you're being shaped in the in the potter's hands. Amen. &gt;&gt; Pressed into shape time after time after time. [panting and sighs] &gt;&gt; I just wish that I wasn't so stubborn that he had to break me apart so many times. &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell on myself. From the time I was a young man, [snorts] I started realizing that I was I was I was a quiet, oddnatured kid. I started realizing though that I had the I had a physical ability. I could do anything that I wanted to do as far as athletics. I was strong. I was fast. I could jump. I could out jump the highest jumper. I was strong. I was as strong as the strongest guy. And over time through life, you you you get to the place where what are you relying on to take care of you? Now, when you're on the job, are you depending on the Lord to provide for you? Or was Pete depending on that strength? I could do the work of five men all day long and never and felt like I never even broke a sweat. I felt like I was just getting tuned up. &gt;&gt; And I relied on it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I became self-sufficient. A self-sufficient Christian is worthless. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He cannot reflect himself through us. &gt;&gt; And he he looked down said, "I got to tear him down. I got to break this boy apart and mold something in him. &gt;&gt; I'm not pleased with what I see in him. [panting] &gt;&gt; And little by little, I just started falling apart physically. Shoulders, back, knees, just one thing after another. It was insane the way that it happened. one time after another after another after another [gasps] until I got to the place where I had to realize I need his help every day. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Just to get out of bed and put my socks and shoes on my feet. [gasps] [snorts] &gt;&gt; See, what it build in me is a reliance upon Jesus Christ. I need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Brother Donnie talking about these ministers saying they don't need the Holy Ghost to preach no more. My God, what would I be if I didn't have the Holy Ghost? I have nothing to offer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, we have got to be shaped into the image that he saw in his mind. &gt;&gt; [panting] [sighs] [gasps] &gt;&gt; Why is he doing it? Why does he do this? Because he wants a family. Not just a family, but a family like him. [panting] [snorts] Verse 29 says that who for whom he did for no we are here he elected us not just to say I'm elect I'm chosen I'm bride but he he whom he did for know he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that is the reason that he elected his that is the reason why he is working on us not so that We can get puffed up and say we know more than anybody else does. We can explain it all. &gt;&gt; That ain't it, friend. &gt;&gt; A mental knowledge of this word is not enough. &gt;&gt; He wants people of his own genealogy, &gt;&gt; his own seed line with his own spirit living in them. He has our own character that reflects him. Brother Brandham says here in now is set forth the love of God. He desired in love a family of his own, a family of sons, sons like himself. Therefore before him lays all mankind as one lump of clay. Out of the same lump he will now make vessels of honor and under dishonor. The choosing will be his choosing. Then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to the image in their walk. He reproves with all longsuffering with gentleness and mercy. [snorts] He chasens with nail scarred hands. Sometimes this potter must take the vessel that he's working on and thoroughly break it down. &gt;&gt; In order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires. But it is love. That is his love. Another way of love there is not. There cannot be. See, he desires someone like himself to spend eternity with. &gt;&gt; You ever just feel like I want somebody like me to hang out with, somebody like me to talk to, somebody that gets me? &gt;&gt; He is the same. [snorts] I think about my my son Micah. Me and Micah, he is he is me. He is my D my DNA. He has a nature so similar to me. He thinks like me. Me and Micah don't even have to say words. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; To know exactly what the other is is is talking, what the other wants to say. We'll walk through the house. I I'll make eye contact with him. I'm like, I know exactly what he said. He just spit out a paragraph, you know, and it's and it goes back and forth. Why? Because he's like me. He gets me. There's a communication between us because there because that likeness &gt;&gt; that is unlike a communication with somebody you just have nothing in common with. &gt;&gt; He is looking for his image, brother, sister. and he is going to break the clay and he's going to shape the clay and he's going to mold the clay until he sees his own image. So, you got to remember when we're going through all of this in life, because life's tough, you know, life ain't for sissies. It just ain't. you know, you know, whether it's health, you know, whether it's finances, whether it's family problems, um, whatever it might be, &gt;&gt; life's tough, &gt;&gt; and we're all being shaped, but the the key is being shaped by the master's hand. What potter has got you in his hand, shaping you and making you? Is it the word of the hour that is shaping you? Or is it just you on your own living your own life and life is just molding you into a hard hard person? Because that is what hard life will do. Without the Holy Ghost in your life, it will make you hard. &gt;&gt; Remember that his purpose is an eternal elective purpose. He works with eternal goals in his mind. I'm saying it over and over. &gt;&gt; His love is an elective love. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it is not based on merit &gt;&gt; or how good you are or how pretty you are or how handsome you are &gt;&gt; or how strong you are, what a good speaker you are, what a good businessman you are, how much you love the message. &gt;&gt; That ain't it. &gt;&gt; He did not choose you because you were good. No, &gt;&gt; he did not choose you because, oh well, he knew I'd be a good boy and I would serve him. No, sir. He chose us because he wanted to. He saw us in his mind &gt;&gt; in eternity. And it was love at first sight. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He saw Jacob before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; [gasps] [panting] &gt;&gt; As the scripture says, Jacob have I loved and Esau have I have I hated before either one of them boys was even born. &gt;&gt; Jacob was a scoundrel. &gt;&gt; He was a suppler, a deceiver, a cheater. And he knew that and he loved him anyway. See, he has the ability to look at the clay &gt;&gt; and say, "Oh, this that's just dirt right now, but I know what I can make out of this. &gt;&gt; Oh, that when I'm done, that mud, that clay will look just like me." [sighs] [panting] &gt;&gt; And when he was done with suppl, he was now a prince with God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; After the river, he walked a little bit different for the rest of his life. &gt;&gt; Because of the the elective love of God did not choose him based upon his marriage. &gt;&gt; He loved him because he loved him. And he saw he also saw in his mind an image of her his elect lady when he has existed alone by himself as the self-existing one. He saw her. He literally saw her [panting] &gt;&gt; when there was nothing but him. There were no angels. There was no Lucifer. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; There was nothing but God. [panting] And he saw us. [snorts] He knew us then as attributes, as thoughts. He literally saw each of his elect. And he took a picture of that in his mind. And he ain't going to stop. until that picture is perfected in our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. [panting] He elected us to be his bride and he will prepare us to be his bride. &gt;&gt; I'm dumping grace on heavy tonight. We need it. &gt;&gt; You will not make it because you think you live so good or that you are so holy. We need the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. [panting and gasps] [snorts] &gt;&gt; He has purposed in his heart. There ain't nothing going to stop him. Absolutely nothing's going to stop him [gasps] until he sees his bride without spot or wrinkle standing by his side. [panting] [sighs and gasps] Made just like himself in character, [panting] fit to judge and fit to reign. &gt;&gt; So he shapes us now in life. Yeah. &gt;&gt; With trial after trial and test after test, time after time, if he has to, he will break our hearts if that's what it takes. He will take that thing from you that you love so much. And you wonder why. Why would a loving God do something like that? I wanted so many times about my brother James just a few years ago. The Lord let me see. He let me see. He had to take my brother while he was right. 5 days before the boy died, six days before he died, he almost died of alcohol poisoning. The next day, he turned his life back to Jesus Christ. You see, he knows what he's doing. Stop wondering why and just trust him. He knows, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; how to shape your life. He knows what to remove and what to add. &gt;&gt; That's right. He literally saw her in his sight. He saw her as justified in his sight while he was in eternity. The scripture says that whom he called them, he also justified and whom he justified, he also glorified. Now, none of us were here on this earth at that time, but he saw that picture, &gt;&gt; and that is what he's working for. [panting and sighs] He's looking for a queen. [panting] Not pretend. He didn't pretend. This isn't a story. [snorts] &gt;&gt; He saw her, [sighs and panting] &gt;&gt; not in type. He saw his bride. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He saw her as justified. He saw us as glorified, standing by his side and he will work out exactly what he saw in his mind, exactly as he saw us then. He will shape us the same. [sighs and gasps] [panting] It's no wonder Paul said, "Who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect?" It is God that justifith. Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ yay that died rather and is rais risen again. Who is anybody even at the right hand of God who and who maketh intercession for us? He is our judge jury. &gt;&gt; The attorney attorney when he saw us there was no prosecutor in existence. friend. &gt;&gt; You understand that the accuser of the brethren was not there to accuse us before him. In his mind, he tried his little bride. He saw Christ as our intercessor. He saw us washed in the blood. &gt;&gt; He saw us as redeemed, not just pardoned. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, pardon means I'm guilty, but I was forgiven. &gt;&gt; See, he took us a little further than that. &gt;&gt; See, it's not a reworking of our old man. He's [snorts] not trying to reform us like an AA meeting where you go and you're tall principles to apply to your life to keep you from falling back to the bottle. &gt;&gt; [panting] &gt;&gt; This is not a reformation gospel. It is a transformation gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. He saw me. He saw you as not guilty in his sight. [sighs] [panting] &gt;&gt; As it was as though brother Brandham said that we never even did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; That's right. In the rapture message, he said, "Now notice, not only is the bride washed, forgiven, but she's justified." See, did you ever try the word justified to see what it means? Now, for exist, for instance, if Brother Green heard that I'd been drinking, I'd been doing bad things, then he found out I didn't do it, then he comes to me. He says, "Brother Brandon, well, I forgive you." Well, Brother Brham says, "You forgive me. I never done it. &gt;&gt; What are you forgiving me about? &gt;&gt; You see, but if I'm guilty, then I can be forgiven, but I'm still not just. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Think about that. If all we are is forgiven, we are not just in his sight because we we were guilty of these of this of this sin. We were found guilty if that's the case. See, it is not a reworking of our old man. It is a new creation by the spirit. &gt;&gt; You see, a deposit was placed in each and every one of us that are rel. [panting] Now, that seed is perfect, but it's in a dormant state. through the work of the Holy Ghost, the old man, he dies. That old nature dies. &gt;&gt; And that seed of God that never one time sinned comes to life &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost. That is how [screaming] he sees us as justified in his sight. [panting] That is why nothing can stop him from bringing his word to pass in our life. &gt;&gt; We are not pretending. We are not guilty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It ain't no wonder Paul, it's wearing me out. It ain't no wonder Paul said, "Who can separate me &gt;&gt; from the love of Christ? &gt;&gt; Shall tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, or sword?" I'm here to tell you tonight, brother, sister, if you don't already know it, there is no trial that can separate us from the elect love of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is no persecution that you could ever go through that could separate you from the love of God. I think about the Hebrew children and how that that there was a king [snorts] who purposed in his heart that he was going to destroy them. Brother Brham said God purposed in his heart that he was going to show that king who God was. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the king heated the fire seven times harder than it had ever been heated before. The hottest stri that they had ever seen. [panting] &gt;&gt; See, he did not take the fire away. He let him heat it up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Turn up the fire. [panting] That's how much confidence he has in himself. That's how much confidence he has in his his election. He didn't take the fire away, but he became the fourth man in the fire. &gt;&gt; See, he purposed to show himself that he was a deliverer. [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; And no fire can ever defeat the purpose of almighty God. There is no demonic power that can hold me or hold you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no fear. [panting] There is no fear of losing those that you love so great that he will allow it to shake you [panting and gasps] from his purpose. For many years, I lived with that over my head, afraid to get close to anybody because everybody it seemed like that I got close to died. My brother James, my cousin Eric, cousin Billy, my buddy Jackie, just one after the other. &gt;&gt; And I lived in fear. I didn't make friends. So many of you, I love you all to death, but I've always I would always just pull away and just stay there stay at distance because I was afraid that if I got close that some for some reason he would take he would take it from me. [gasps] That is not of God for his children to live in fear. [panting] &gt;&gt; Fear of missing the rapture. Fear of losing my family. fear of not being a being worthy. &gt;&gt; There is no depression that can hold the people of God. &gt;&gt; There is no spirit of oppression that can hold us down. &gt;&gt; He said the Lord will be a refuge for the oppressed. He has a place that we can run to and surrender &gt;&gt; and let him build us back up into confidence in him and to trust. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not just trust in him, but [snorts] trust in his people. [panting] I appreciate I'm going to say because he's not here, but I appreciate brother Donnie um because he's helped me a lot. Um, I've had that issue where I just didn't trust people. I'm always just looking. Always was watching. &gt;&gt; You know, there's there's a there's a twist coming, you know, no matter what people are telling you, there's going to be a twist coming. They don't really always mean what they say. &gt;&gt; But I but and I pushed his buttons. I'm going to be honest with you, Sister Carol. I'm sorry, but I did. At times, I pushed his buttons just to see. and he's been so patient time after time to help me um to encourage me. Um and it's helped me to get to the place where now where you start you're trusting not just God but you're trusting his people because you see I see Jesus in David Swanson and I know I can trust him. &gt;&gt; We're all human. &gt;&gt; We all got faults and problems. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But don't just look at that, brother sister. Can you see Jesus? &gt;&gt; It is not of God for his children to be oppressed. There is no darkness that that could ever hold us down from the purpose of God being fulfilled in our life. &gt;&gt; I like the way David said it. He said, "Where can I go from your spirit? Where can I go to get away from his presence? If I ascend so high that I go up into heaven, he's there. And if I make my bed in hell, he's right there with me. &gt;&gt; If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there thy right hand shall lead me. and thy right hand shall hold me. &gt;&gt; There is nothing that can stop his purpose from being fulfilled in our life. Not even death itself can stop us. If he's by if it is by his some reason it is his purpose to take us then death is just going to escort us across the river. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We win either way. &gt;&gt; I got one last question then I'm going to close. Mercy. I'm sorry. Why did he send William Brandham, &gt;&gt; brother William Brandham with a message in this last days? What was the reason behind it? &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; it was to turn our hearts, the the hearts of the elect back to the faith of the fathers. &gt;&gt; He sent him with a purpose to go and get a bride for me. And not just go get a bride, but to get her ready. You see, he said, brother Brandon went so far as far as to say, he said the heart purpose, the eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing. That's why he sent brother William Brandham in the last days. Not just to be prepared to meet him, cleaned up, new clothes on, mature. Not just to meet him, but to reign with him, &gt;&gt; to judge with him, to prepare a bride with character so much like his own that when he looks at her, she's just like me. [snorts] She's just like me. Now I have someone that I can talk to. &gt;&gt; That gets me. &gt;&gt; Someone that thinks the way that I think. &gt;&gt; Someone who feels like I feel. &gt;&gt; Someone who loves like I love and they hate what I hate. &gt;&gt; Musicians come. You see a man, a man and a wife and his wife. You can only have that real deep relationship with somebody that you just got that that connection with. &gt;&gt; I think about me and Bambi. I wanted a wife that that I could talk to more than anything in this world. That was my number one thing. I wanted somebody that I could talk to &gt;&gt; and and have a conversation with and someone with character that now I didn't have to worry about her judgment. You know, cuz if if your if you if everything matches, if say your your ethics are the same and and your your all your beliefs are the same, but the character ain't right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; she she's saying words she shouldn't say and she dresses like she shouldn't dress or um it's just it's hard. You couldn't have that fullness of relationship. But I chose a woman that I saw character in, that I saw Jesus Christ in. I chose a lady who shared my same views and beliefs. I um um the same principles in life that I live by. &gt;&gt; You see, he also desires a woman like that. &gt;&gt; Same as him in genealogy. same as him in spirit and character. She forgives the way that he forgives. She's patient like he's patient. Someone that he trusts to judge things like he jud he he he the way that he judges. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows she'll that her her decision will be just like his. See, he desires someone, if you would just stand with me, he desires someone like himself to spend eternity with. That's why we walk through the fire and [snorts] all these trials of life. He wants someone like himself to spend eternity with. Think about that. What? What? How would it be to spend eternity with somebody you ain't got nothing in common with? That sounds like hell. To be honest with you, it does. Which which tells you why he's working on us the way that he's working on us. You see, he is desiring. He is desiring a a a lady, an elect lady who is his equal in in in in in in judgment that will that will be by his side. Yes, I said equal. In Philippians chapter 5, it says, "Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, thought in not robbery to be equal with God." Yeah. &gt;&gt; This elect lady that has been shaped, [sighs] born of his spirit, same character as him, molded by him, shaped by his own [screaming] hand into perfection. [sighs] She is him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; [panting] &gt;&gt; Brother Harry, would you sing something for me while I catch my breath? [applause] &gt;&gt; Don't get discouraged, little bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's just doing it because he loves you with all of his heart. Amen. Amen. So many times I've questioned certain circumstances, things I [singing] could not understand. Many times in trials, [music] weakness blur [singing] my vision and my frustration gets so out of [singing] hand. But it's then I [music] am reminded I've never been forsaken. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've never had stand one [music] test alone. As I [singing] look at all the victories, the spirit risees [singing] up [music] in me. And through the fire, my weakness is made strong. He [music] never promised [singing] that the cross would not be heavy. [music and singing] He would not be hard to climb. He never [music and singing] offered victories without fighting. But he said [singing] help would always come [music] in time. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Just remember when you're standing in the valley of [music and singing] decision and the adversary says give [singing] in. [music] Just hold on. [music] Our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again. [singing] [music] He never [singing] promised that the cross would not be [music] heavy, that the hill would not [singing] be hard to climb. [music] He never [singing] offered victories [music] without fighting. But he said help would always come in time. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Just [music] remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and [music] the adversary says give in. Just [music] hold on. [singing] Our Lord will show up and he will [music] take you through the fire again. [singing] I know [music and singing] within myself that I will surely perish. [singing] But if [music] I trust the hand of God, he'll shield the flames again. Again, [music and singing] he never promised [music] that the cross would not be heavy. [singing] Your heel would not be hard to climb. He [music] never offered victories without fighting. But he said help would always [music] come in time. Just [music] remember when [singing] you're standing in the valley of [music] decision and the adversary says keep in [music] just hold on. [singing] Our Lord [music] will show up and he will take you through again. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] I just Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. He's worthy of it, friends. I just want to say this cuz I don't feel like I close it out quite just right. Um, he sends us through the fire, but I I also want to say this. We go through things in life, but if your load is getting too heavy that you can't take it, he is still a loadbearer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's still a loadbearer. He's able to give you some strength, to give you a leg up, to give you a boost. And and if the enemy has put something on you, he's able to take it off of you. Brother Sister, he has not changed. Just because we're walking through this, it does not change who he is. He is still a chain breaker. He is still right now a healer. He is still right now a deliverer. &gt;&gt; And he's able to help you. Whatever you're going through, if it is too much for you to carry, give it to Jesus tonight. &gt;&gt; Do not walk out of here too heavy under your load. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Enjoy. Brother Pete Lawson tonight. [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Brother Pete, God bless you. I believe that was just in time &gt;&gt; for all of us. He'll take us through the fire. &gt;&gt; He didn't promise you a bed of roses. He didn't promise none of us a flowery bed of roses, but he did say he'd be there for us. &gt;&gt; How many of you believe that with all your heart? &gt;&gt; The children of Israel, they wake went through a Red Sea. Can you imagine walking through that Red Sea? But they had a word from the Lord. That's right. &gt;&gt; I'll get you to the other side. &gt;&gt; The three Hebrew children in the fiery furnace. Can you imagine going into a fiery furnace, but somebody got in there with him and walked around? He'll walk around with you. Do you believe that tonight? Let's sing just a little bit more of that, Brother Harry, as we get ready to leave. It's been good to be in the house of God. I know that. &gt;&gt; Let's come back Sunday morning looking for what the Lord will have for us. It's going to be something good. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Through the fire. Let's sing a little bit more of it. &gt;&gt; So many times I've questioned. Praise the Lord. certain [music] circumstances, [singing] pains I could not understand. [music] Many times in trials, the weakness bl [music] out of hand. [music] &gt;&gt; Well, listen, then I am reminded. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I've never been [music] forsaken. &gt;&gt; Never been forsaken. &gt;&gt; I've never had to stand one test [music] alone. &gt;&gt; Not a one of them. &gt;&gt; As I look at [singing] all the victories the [music] spirit rises up in me. And it's through the fire my weakness [music] is made. Oh, sing it out to him, church. He never promised that the [music] cross would not be heavy. The hill would not be hard to climb. [music] He never offered victories without body. He said, "Help would always come." Just remember when you're [music] standing in a valley [singing] of decision and the [music] adversary is giving. &gt;&gt; Just hold [music] on. &gt;&gt; Hold on. Our Lord will show up and [music] he will take you through the fire again. God bless [music] you. You need to leave. You're dismissed. I know within [music] myself that I will surely perish. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, we would. &gt;&gt; If I trust [music] the hand of God, he'll shield the flames [singing] again. [music] Again. &gt;&gt; Again. He never [singing] promised that the cross would not be the hill would not be hard to [singing] climb. He never offered victories [music] without he said help would always come in time. Just [music] remember when you're standing. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. The valley of decision [music] and the adversary is safe. Give it just hold on. Our [music and singing] Lord will show up and he will take you [music] through the fire again. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; He never promised that the cross would [music] not be heavy. [singing] The hill would not be hard to climb. [music] He never offered victories without fighting. But he said help would always come in time. [music] Just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the [music] adversary says give it just hold on. Our Lord will show up [music] and he will take you through the fire again. [singing] Just [music] hold on. Our Lord will show up and [music] he will take you through the fire again. [singing] [music] Hallelujah. [music] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, sometimes when I'm going through a really hard trial, the last couple years are there capacity, I found myself many times in the basement and I just sing this chorus. We we've sung it here before.
