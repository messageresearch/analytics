[7:32] As I kneel in the darkness
[7:36] in the middle of the night,
[7:40] I'm praying for assurance
[7:43] everything's going to be all right for I
[7:48] see another battle.
[7:51] It's out in front of me
[7:54] and I'm afraid I won't be able
[7:58] and I'll go down in defeat.
[8:03] And he said, "I walk on the water and I
[8:08] call the raging sea.
[8:12] I spelled to the wind.
[8:16] It hushed and I gave you peace. Didn't I
[8:20] run to your rescue? Didn't I hear you
[8:24] when you call?
[8:27] I walk right beside you just so you
[8:32] would fall. And did not leave all of
[8:36] heaven
[8:38] just to die for your sins.
[8:42] I searched until I found you and I do it
[8:47] all again. Let's all stand. We'll sing
[8:50] the second verse. Now she's talking to
[8:53] her father
[8:55] in a house I was once a home.
[8:58] Said, "My bills are coming to Lord. Six
[9:03] days are not thy long." He hears a voice
[9:07] so still
[9:09] said, "I move like that before.
[9:14] I'll do this thing and I will give you
[9:19] so much more."
[9:22] And he said, "I walk on the water and I
[9:27] call the raging sea.
[9:31] I swore to the wind.
[9:34] Did I still I gave you peace? Didn't I
[9:39] run to your rescue? Didn't I hear you
[9:43] when you call?
[9:46] And I walked right beside you just so
[9:50] you wouldn't fall. Didn't I leave all of
[9:55] heaven
[9:57] just to die for your sins?
[10:01] I searched until I found you.
[10:04] and I do it all again. I like this last
[10:09] verse. He said, "Do you remember
[10:14] child where I brought you from?
[10:18] Just take a look behind you
[10:22] at how far you come."
[10:25] And every time you ask me, did I deliver
[10:31] you?
[10:33] Oh, why would you be thinking that I
[10:37] wouldn't see you through?
[10:41] He said I walked on the water and I
[10:46] called the raging sea.
[10:50] I spoke to the wind.
[10:54] It hushed and I gave you peace. Didn't I
[10:58] run to your rescue? And I hear you when
[11:03] you call.
[11:05] I walked right beside you just so you
[11:10] wouldn't fall. And didn't I leave all of
[11:15] heaven
[11:16] just to die for your sin.
[11:20] I searched until I found you and I do it
[11:25] all again. Let's sing that last verse
[11:28] again. He said, "Do you remember
[11:33] child where I brought you from?
[11:37] Just take a look behind you
[11:41] at how far you come."
[11:45] And every time you ask me, then I
[11:50] deliver you.
[11:52] Oh, why would you be thinking that I
[11:57] wouldn't see you through?
[12:01] They said I walked on the water.
[12:06] I called the raging sea.
[12:09] I spoke to the wind.
[12:13] It hushed and I gave you peace. Didn't I
[12:17] run to your rescue? When I hear you when
[12:23] you call,
[12:25] I walk right beside you just so you
[12:30] wouldn't fall. And didn't I leave all of
[12:34] heaven
[12:36] just to die for your sin?
[12:40] I searched until I found you. And I do
[12:44] it all again. said, "I walked on the
[12:49] water and I called the raging sea.
[12:55] I spoke to the wind."
[12:58] It hushed and I gave you peace. Then I
[13:03] run to rescue. And I hear you when you
[13:08] call.
[13:10] And I walked right beside you just so
[13:14] you wouldn't fall. And didn't I leave
[13:19] all of heaven
[13:21] just to die for your sins?
[13:25] I searched until I found you. And I do
[13:30] it all again.
[13:34] Amen. Praise the Lord. Go ahead and give
[13:37] him a hand clap of praise.
[13:39] [Applause]
[13:42] Amen. You can be seated this evening.

[16:27] Dear Lord,
[16:29] what a wonderful opportunity, Father, to
[16:31] midweek
[16:32] when seems like we battle day by day by
[16:36] day, but this is a refuge for us, Lord.
[16:38] A place to come rest, a place to relieve
[16:42] the pressure. Lord, help us to do so.
[16:44] Father, relieve it in you, not in things
[16:46] of the world. God, you hear all the
[16:48] requests. There's so many serious ones,
[16:52] Father. And it's always that way among
[16:55] your people, but you're always there to
[16:56] help. God, we're asking right now, we
[16:59] commit everything to your hand. We
[17:01] commit the preaching of the word, which
[17:03] strengthens us to go on during the week.
[17:05] May you may you reveal your word to us,
[17:07] speak to our hearts, anoint the minister
[17:10] tonight. Help us, Father God, in this
[17:12] hour for we love you, Lord. We just
[17:15] we're just uh in a battle and we're
[17:17] wanting to win. And may you help us,
[17:20] Lord God. Please help us and be with us.
[17:22] The desire is in us, Father, but you'll
[17:24] just need to please help us, Lord. In
[17:26] Jesus name we ask it. Amen.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Kim, if you'll come at this
[17:33] time, receive the tithes and offering.
[17:36] gonna sing an old song from the Happy
[17:38] Valley days that I tried to resurrect
[17:41] during the prayer line, but I probably
[17:43] should have practiced it before I tried
[17:44] to resurrect it. Um, hopefully everybody
[17:47] remembers it so I'm not the only one
[17:49] singing. I appreciate all the
[17:51] participation that I can get, especially
[17:52] on semi- old, semi- new songs.
[17:56] Let's sing this together.

[18:00] I may be troubled on every hand, but I'm
[18:03] not stressed out.
[18:07] perplexed about things in life, but I'm
[18:10] not in despair.
[18:14] I'm sometimes persecuted,
[18:17] but I'm never left alone.
[18:22] Cast down but not destroyed because I'm
[18:25] one of his own.

[18:48] my mouth going to shout his praise. By
[18:51] the blood of Jesus Christ, I'm getting
[18:54] back up.
[18:58] With the whole armor of God, I'm able to
[19:02] stand.

[21:25] back up. Let's go to that last verse.

[22:26] up.

[36:39] they were saying the name of their
[36:41] pastor,
[36:43] Jehovah Savior.
[36:47] And then this name, this preacher, their
[36:50] pastor
[36:52] was their savior.
[36:55] They turned in testimonies of healings
[36:58] and miracles
[37:00] that had happened through the power of
[37:03] his name.
[37:06] a message preacher so-called. I've stood
[37:08] there and preached in that church.
[37:12] I got another video today from the same
[37:14] assembly and they were singing what
[37:18] great power
[37:20] that laid in the name of this pastor. So
[37:24] they took the song there is power in the
[37:29] name of Jesus.
[37:32] except they said the name of their
[37:35] pastor.
[37:37] And here we are tonight knowing that
[37:40] that is lies.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; And there's only one name that's worthy
[37:47] of praise.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; You ought to be so grateful
[37:50] &gt;&gt; that you're praising Jesus
[37:53] &gt;&gt; and not some idolatry
[37:56] &gt;&gt; and blasphemy.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Cuz that's exactly what it is.
[38:02] You say around the message. Yeah. You
[38:04] say, "Well, my goodness, brother Donnie,
[38:06] why in the world would that be?" Cuz
[38:08] Satan wants to tarnish it. That's why.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you know the truth?
[38:16] &gt;&gt; And the truth has made us free
[38:19] &gt;&gt; from such stuff as that.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Well, how are you
[38:24] tonight? Good.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; How many's fighting the devil?
[38:29] &gt;&gt; We're good. Praise God. If none of you
[38:31] had raised your hands, I was going to
[38:33] quit.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Well, how many of you winning?
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Some of you still working on it. That's
[38:40] all right. Praise the Lord. You're going
[38:41] to do it by the grace of God. Let's turn
[38:44] tonight to Genesis chap 24 if you would.
[38:47] Verse 54.
[38:51] Again, our setting from the great
[38:55] passage that has been written so many
[38:57] thousands of years ago, laid there in
[38:59] the word, of course, thought probably by
[39:02] many just to be another speck of history
[39:06] and the life of the patriarch Abraham,
[39:10] but it was much much more than that.
[39:13] Genesis 24:54.
[39:15] And they did eat and drink, he and the
[39:18] men that were with him, and terried all
[39:20] night. And they rose up in the morning.
[39:23] And he said, "Send me away unto my
[39:27] master."
[39:29] Now, his message thus far has been about
[39:32] blessings and been about wealth and uh
[39:37] potentate, a man of great position and
[39:40] all of that. But now his message comes
[39:43] to this phase.
[39:46] Separating time.
[39:49] Separating time. Now watch what he's
[39:52] going to say. Send me away unto my
[39:55] master. And her brother and her mother
[39:58] said, "Let the damsel abide with us a
[40:02] few days, at the least 10, and after
[40:05] that she shall go." And he said unto
[40:09] them, "Hinder me not, seeing that the
[40:12] Lord has prospered my way. Send me away
[40:16] that I may go to my master." And they
[40:20] said, "We will call the damsel and
[40:23] inquire at her mouth." And they called
[40:27] Rebecca and said unto her, and this is
[40:31] my thought for tonight, wilt thou go
[40:36] with this man?
[40:39] And word of life said,
[40:42] &gt;&gt; I will go.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; I will go.
[40:48] Now, believe it or not, God's prophet
[40:51] said, "God
[40:53] wants to hear you
[40:55] say that."
[40:58] God wants to hear you
[41:02] say that. Maybe it was something similar
[41:05] to that in the year 1904
[41:10] when the Welsh revival broke out and
[41:13] some missionaries from the Baptist
[41:15] missionary service in here in America
[41:18] went to India
[41:20] and they began to spread the gospel what
[41:23] they knew of it.
[41:25] There was a man, his wife and two sons
[41:28] in a certain village village in India
[41:31] that received the gospel. They begin to
[41:33] testify to others and the king of that
[41:37] village had a problem because he was he
[41:41] was really tearing that place up. So he
[41:44] called him, his wife and his children
[41:47] and demanded
[41:49] that they renounce their faith in Jesus
[41:52] Christ.
[41:53] And the man said
[41:56] he would not do it. These are his words.
[41:59] I have decided
[42:02] to follow Jesus.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; So the king commanded his men with their
[42:09] bows and arrows to kill his two sons
[42:12] before his eyes.
[42:15] So he said, "I give you a chance to
[42:16] recant."
[42:21] He refused.
[42:23] shot his wife.
[42:25] She fell on top of her boys as they were
[42:28] laying there twitching and jerking.
[42:32] So he said, "What do you say about it
[42:34] now?" He said, "Though none go with me,
[42:37] I will follow."
[42:40] So now he says, "All right, we're going
[42:42] to take your life." So what will you say
[42:45] now?
[42:47] No turning back.
[42:51] No turning back.
[42:56] That song that you all know that's been
[42:58] a hymn for many, many years. That was
[43:01] the birth of that song.
[43:05] So the man lays there dead, his wife
[43:08] dead, and his two sons dead. It tore
[43:11] that king all to pieces.
[43:14] He said, "How could anybody be willing
[43:18] to do such?"
[43:21] He fell under conviction,
[43:24] gave his heart to the Lord Jesus right
[43:27] there.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; The rest of the whole tribe got under
[43:32] conviction and every one of them got
[43:34] saved. Amen.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Now I ask you,
[43:40] was it worth four people giving their
[43:43] lives to save all the rest of them?
[43:46] Isn't it amazing? It was not their life
[43:50] being lived that impacted the salvation
[43:53] of others, but them actually giving
[43:56] their life.
[43:59] That song was sung in India. an American
[44:02] artist here in America in 1959 took it
[44:06] put put the orchestration to the music
[44:08] and all that. It has been of course
[44:11] recognized as one of the great famous
[44:13] hymns of the church and birthed out of
[44:17] such pain and death.
[44:21] So I ask you again,
[44:24] will you go?
[44:29] &gt;&gt; If your mama goes, you will. If your
[44:31] daddy goes, you well, if if your friends
[44:33] go,
[44:36] no turning back.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Though none go whispering, I will
[44:42] follow.
[44:45] Let's pray together, shall we?
[44:49] Lord Jesus,
[44:51] we're so thankful, Father,
[44:55] that you can move on human beings hearts
[44:57] in such a way that makes them so odd and
[45:02] peculiar to the world,
[45:05] but yet the love that they experience is
[45:08] so phenomenal
[45:10] that it can change other people's lives.
[45:15] Father, that's what we want out of our
[45:17] own lives.
[45:19] Not just the way we dress and not just
[45:22] certain things that we do and don't do
[45:25] and places we can go and don't go and
[45:28] all of that, but may it be our love,
[45:33] truly our love that we have for you and
[45:37] not only for you, but for each other.
[45:41] But when you were here, you said, "By
[45:43] this shall all men know that you are my
[45:46] disciples
[45:48] because you have love one for the
[45:51] other."
[45:52] I can't wait to meet that man that day.
[45:57] I think myself, had that been me,
[46:00] instead of two boys, it been my two
[46:02] girls.
[46:05] while they laid their jerking and
[46:07] quivering and life going out of their
[46:08] bodies.
[46:10] I believe I'd had enough courage.
[46:14] And then if it was asked about Carol,
[46:18] I believe I'd still had enough courage
[46:20] to say, "Though none go with me, still I
[46:24] will follow."
[46:26] I pray, Father, you'd help each one of
[46:28] us here tonight to feel that way. Bless
[46:31] our gathering tonight, Lord Jesus. We
[46:33] ask in your precious name.
[46:36] Amen.
[46:37] God bless you. You may be seated.
[46:42] That's one thing I really love about the
[46:44] Lord.
[46:46] He messes up your plans.
[46:49] I was going to tell you that story at
[46:51] the end,
[46:53] but somehow another, he wanted it told
[46:55] at the beginning.
[46:58] Let me read this to you from possessing
[47:00] the enemy's gates in 1959.
[47:03] And the prophet said, "Rebecca, which
[47:05] was to be the mother of this noted,
[47:09] promised, waited son,
[47:12] when she was called, she had never seen
[47:15] before." Notice now called to the final
[47:19] test of a strange man she had never seen
[47:24] before. Only she seen the working of the
[47:29] Holy Spirit. Now remember, she never
[47:32] actually saw any vindication from God
[47:37] that Eleazar was telling the truth.
[47:41] There was no signs, no wonders, no
[47:45] miracles, no healings, no lame legs, no
[47:49] blinded eyes, none of that. None of that
[47:53] happened whatsoever. What did she have?
[47:57] She had his word, but she also had a
[48:00] personal experience that the angel of
[48:04] God had given to her. Now, notice how
[48:07] the prophet says this. She had never
[48:10] seen before, only she had seen the
[48:12] working of the Holy Spirit. And when her
[48:15] parents could not fully decide whether
[48:17] she should go with this stranger or not
[48:19] to be the wife of a man that she had
[48:22] never seen, she was brought to the final
[48:26] test.
[48:27] And we'll get the damsel and let her
[48:30] speak. We'll hear from her mouth whether
[48:34] she will go yes or no. That's the way
[48:39] it's brought to all of the seed of God.
[48:43] It's got to be your mouth.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; God wants to hear from you.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Isn't that awesome? It's got to be from
[48:57] your mouth. Now, you may wonder
[48:59] sometimes why whenever I'm preaching
[49:01] things or other ministers will do the
[49:03] same thing, I must say, what do you all
[49:06] think about it? You all understand this?
[49:08] You agree with that? Why am I doing
[49:10] that? because God wants to hear it from
[49:13] your mouth. And I figure one of the ways
[49:15] that he can do it is for me to put it to
[49:18] you in the form of a question. So I ask
[49:22] you the question and then God is waiting
[49:26] to hear your answer. Now notice it's got
[49:29] to be your mouth. God wants to hear from
[49:34] you. So when she was put to the test,
[49:38] she never hesitated a minute. She said,
[49:41] "I will go." I like that. Not, "Let me
[49:45] make up my mind. Let me study it over."
[49:49] She was fully persuaded. That's the
[49:53] people that God can use. Praise the
[49:56] Lord. When you're fully persuaded that
[50:00] God will keep his promise, she said, "I
[50:04] will go." Now remember, Rebecca was a
[50:08] type of the bride. So if she was then
[50:12] she in her journey and in her decision
[50:16] time and in the faith part of her
[50:19] journey she had to experience similar
[50:22] things to what you and I would be or she
[50:26] could not be the bride type. Now, if
[50:29] everything went easy for her and she
[50:32] never had to have a testing of her faith
[50:35] and maybe even a wondering on the
[50:38] journey after the great pulsation of
[50:41] faith had anointed her to speak this, it
[50:44] might have been so reverberating out of
[50:46] her soul and so powerful that it took
[50:48] her by surprise. We know it's done us
[50:51] that way at times. But we also know that
[50:53] God will allow us to be tested then of
[50:57] what our confession has been made out of
[51:00] our own mouths. Now, if Rebecca was a
[51:04] bride type, then I I I believe from
[51:06] looking at that that Rebecca must have
[51:09] had some disencouraging times going back
[51:13] on this 450 mile journey on the back of
[51:18] a camel. She is the type of the bride.
[51:20] So if she was, she must have had some
[51:24] wonderings and maybe some bewilderment
[51:27] and maybe even some questions after that
[51:30] she'd committed to following this man
[51:32] that she'd never seen before until
[51:35] yesterday. And he comes with this
[51:38] strange message of a king or not a king
[51:41] but of a great man by the name of
[51:43] Abraham that was a wealthy man and he
[51:46] supposedly had a son. She had no way to
[51:48] Google him. She had no way to be able to
[51:50] chat GPT and check him out, check his
[51:53] credentials. She had absolutely no way
[51:55] whatsoever. But yet, there was something
[51:58] about what the man had to say, the man's
[52:02] message. Now, if you haven't been
[52:05] listening to Time of Decision, uh the
[52:08] one in Chicago and also the one in Los
[52:11] Angeles, it do you good to listen to it
[52:13] cuz a prophet really goes into this and
[52:16] reiterates this and I I love it. But I
[52:18] went back through it again today and I
[52:19] heard him as he come to the end of the
[52:22] preaching part there and he said now
[52:24] those of you that are here and you got
[52:25] needs in your body. He said do you
[52:28] believe my message? Do you have you
[52:31] heard my message that I brought to you
[52:35] from God? I thought Lord have mercy. So
[52:40] here is the very answering to the type
[52:44] of Eleazar in the Old Testament an
[52:47] offering to the people in that day. Now
[52:49] remember 1959 so the seals are not open
[52:53] yet the revealing of the manifestation
[52:56] of the son of man has not even come into
[52:58] full view. It was already been
[53:00] foreshadowed. Great things were
[53:02] happening. But the word of God had
[53:05] already began to call and God was
[53:08] calling out. Now watch. He says what
[53:11] happens here. Now he said, "Let me make
[53:13] up my mind. Let me study over it." She
[53:16] was fully persuaded. That's the people
[53:19] that God can use. And no doubt her
[53:22] parents and her brother, which was the
[53:24] spokesman, could have said, "Come next
[53:26] to yourself, Rebecca. Don't you think
[53:29] that we might need to send a camel train
[53:31] back or to try to find out if this man
[53:33] is even to tell them the truth? We don't
[53:35] even know. They didn't have phones. They
[53:37] didn't have no no way at all to be able
[53:40] to check the story. Rebecca, think what
[53:43] you are. And remember, she was only 16
[53:47] years old.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; And going to marry a man that was
[53:53] actually 40.
[53:56] a man that was still mourning at the
[54:00] deaths of his mother.
[54:03] Now think, in one sense of the word, it
[54:06] would look like a man that in one way
[54:08] was kind of a mama's boy, 40 years old
[54:12] and still living in his mother's tent.
[54:15] Watch what your Bible says. Whenever
[54:17] Rebecca went back, he took her into his
[54:20] mother's tent.
[54:22] And from looking they'd say, "Oh my
[54:24] goodness, what kind of man is this
[54:26] anyway? And how do I know this man here
[54:28] is even telling me the truth?" So they
[54:31] could have said easily, "Rebecca, you
[54:33] may never see your family again." And
[54:35] I've told you before, she didn't.
[54:38] There's no record that she ever went
[54:40] back and saw her mother again or saw any
[54:43] of her family.
[54:46] Oh my. They could have said, "Oh, this
[54:49] is a very difficult journey and look,
[54:51] you're totally outnumbered. You're going
[54:54] and your and your maid Deborah, she's
[54:57] going with you, your nurse. And then
[55:00] there's a few foolish virgins."
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; That's going along with you.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Maids.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; They were following the message, but
[55:10] they never got to marry Isaac.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. But they was going along in the
[55:15] camel train, but they wasn't on the
[55:18] camel the power that she was riding.
[55:21] Now, Rebecca, you're outnumbered. This
[55:23] doesn't even make sense. You've been a
[55:24] sensible girl. And then we come to the
[55:28] famous word that we looked at a couple
[55:30] of weeks ago. Rebecca,
[55:33] this could be a cult.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Let me read to you the meaning of cult.
[55:42] You can read it with me. Cults are
[55:44] social groups which have unusual and
[55:47] often extreme religious, spiritual or
[55:52] philosophical beliefs and rituals. But
[55:57] you know what I find amazing about it is
[55:59] that there are cults that follow certain
[56:04] musicians
[56:06] and cults that follow certain singers.
[56:09] And I'm sure probably a lot of you all
[56:11] have heard of the famous singer in this
[56:14] day and age that we live in. Her name is
[56:16] Taylor Swift. Anybody heard of her name
[56:19] before? I'm sure you've heard her name.
[56:20] Well, she has a cult following. Now, do
[56:26] you know what those people call
[56:29] themselves who are a part of that
[56:32] following?
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Swifties.
[56:37] Yes.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; So they take her name
[56:42] upon themselves and they are not ashamed
[56:46] and you know they dress like her and
[56:48] they pay all kinds of money to go hear
[56:50] her sing and uh they do all that sort of
[56:53] thing and they are proud. They are so
[56:56] tickled to death that they are part of
[57:00] the Swifty cult.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[57:03] Well, I'm very happy myself that I'm
[57:07] part of the eagle one.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; And we also are very swift. As a matter
[57:13] of fact, we're fixing to be so swift,
[57:15] we're going to move from this dimension
[57:17] to the next one and faster than you can
[57:20] bat your eye.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Now, isn't it amazing
[57:24] now that people will not get up in
[57:28] churches and all that? Why? Because
[57:30] there's pastors that are part of the
[57:33] Swifty cult. There are Baptist people,
[57:36] church of God people. I do hope with all
[57:38] of my heart there ain't nobody here that
[57:40] belongs to the Swifty cult. I'm
[57:42] disappointed in you if you are. But yet
[57:45] there was people that belong to the cult
[57:48] of Elvis and the cult of ACC
[57:52] and the cult of this and that and the
[57:55] other. I don't know the modern ones, you
[57:57] know, just ones that I've heard as as a
[57:59] kid growing up and all that. And yet
[58:01] they are not ashamed. They're not
[58:03] backwards of it. And and people don't
[58:05] think it's a terrible thing that they
[58:07] collect every album. You know, there was
[58:10] a cult that followed the group Kiss.
[58:12] Many of you have seen that one. They
[58:14] look like absolute demons right out of
[58:16] the pits of hell. Why? Cuz that's where
[58:19] their influence come from. But yet, why
[58:22] is it that people want to identify a
[58:26] group that just believes something
[58:28] different than what they do or things
[58:31] that they really don't understand or
[58:33] that they've heard from gossip and yet
[58:35] they want to treat you like you've got
[58:37] the plague.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Right?
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Now, I I took some of these things and
[58:42] identified them from the professionals
[58:44] who study cults. But there was one more
[58:48] little aspect that I wanted to touch on
[58:51] for just a little bit and it was this
[58:53] one. According to the Cult Education
[58:57] Institute, wow, what a name. Cult
[59:01] Education Institute, CI.
[59:07] There are specific warning signs to look
[59:11] out for when considering whether a group
[59:15] might be a cult. Cults are
[59:18] characterized, now listen carefully, by
[59:22] absolute
[59:23] authoritarianism
[59:25] without accountability.
[59:29] Now, let's just take now some of the
[59:32] teaching of what our prophet taught us
[59:35] and see if his teachings line up with
[59:39] this. Now, if they do, then I think we
[59:43] as a church should look at ourselves
[59:47] very carefully and say, "Are we a cult
[59:52] that's off the word?"
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Fair enough.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Boy, some of y'all's tore up, ain't you?
[59:58] Yes sir.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Now remember complete authoritarianism.
[1:00:03] So the leader of the cult would be the
[1:00:06] one in charge.
[1:00:08] Then the people won't have any say.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; They won't control. They won't do
[1:00:14] anything. They will just do what they
[1:00:16] are told.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Y'all ain't scared to look, are you?
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Well, I ain't because I know what the
[1:00:23] answer is. Now watch this and you can
[1:00:26] read it with me.
[1:00:28] There is no one above the elder. I have
[1:00:31] nothing to do with what brother Neville
[1:00:34] does here.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Now, this is supposed to be the cult
[1:00:42] leader.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; That's saying to the church that he
[1:00:47] started,
[1:00:48] but brother Neville is now pastoring.
[1:00:51] And the supposed cult leader
[1:00:55] is saying that he don't have any
[1:00:57] control.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Now listen, it goes on. That's up to you
[1:01:02] and brother Neville. If brother Neville
[1:01:05] wanted to preach Jehovah witness
[1:01:09] doctrine,
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; that's up to him and you.
[1:01:16] Oh no.
[1:01:19] It's a bad sign. It's a bad sign that
[1:01:23] brother Brandon wasn't the cult leader.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Cuz these people are spending the years
[1:01:28] of their life now and then they'll fry
[1:01:30] in hell like a pancake after a while on
[1:01:33] lies.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Come on saints.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Now notice if he wanted to preach
[1:01:40] anything he wanted to. That's between
[1:01:41] you and him. Now wait a minute. This is
[1:01:43] one of the first principles of a call
[1:01:46] that absolutism that the leader will
[1:01:49] have and is not to be questioned.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Now, some of you guys that stream our
[1:01:59] services, especially on Wednesday night,
[1:02:01] you like like to pick what I say. Here's
[1:02:04] another one. Now, either you line it up
[1:02:08] or these things will condemn you at the
[1:02:10] day of judgment,
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; and I'll stand against you and watch the
[1:02:15] angels of God commit you into the lake
[1:02:18] of fire.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; so if you got truth, prove it. Amen.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; And Word of Life said,
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; if the congregation votes for him in
[1:02:35] there to preach that,
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; that's all right. That's up to him.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; That's up to him. No, it
[1:02:47] absolute authoritarianism that the cult
[1:02:49] leader so-called was the one that had
[1:02:52] the final say of everything.
[1:02:57] The only thing I do is just owning the
[1:02:59] property. If something another comes by,
[1:03:01] like moving the pastor and they want to
[1:03:03] take a vote on it,
[1:03:06] you couldn't ask a deacon to do that.
[1:03:08] You come and ask me. And I'd come down
[1:03:09] and say, "Well, if you want to move the
[1:03:11] pastor, tell me why. Has he done
[1:03:13] anything? Yes, we caught him drunk or we
[1:03:16] caught him doing this or doing something
[1:03:17] wasn't right. Have you got three
[1:03:19] witnesses of it?" Now notice here is the
[1:03:23] supposed leader.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; But instead of him saying, "Oh, I'll
[1:03:28] tell you one thing. I'll be in charge.
[1:03:30] I'll whoop him. I'll do this, that, and
[1:03:32] other. I'll do No, he's putting it right
[1:03:34] back on the people that are making the
[1:03:36] accusation.
[1:03:39] Have you got three witnesses of it?"
[1:03:41] Yes, we have. Then witnesses must first
[1:03:44] be tried. An elder. Notice you don't
[1:03:47] receive an accusation against an elder
[1:03:50] less it's by two or three witnesses. Let
[1:03:54] them first be proved against an elder.
[1:03:57] Then you have to swear.
[1:04:01] This would eliminate a lot of gossip
[1:04:03] that people accept on preachers if some
[1:04:06] of you lay people would make them comply
[1:04:09] to this.
[1:04:10] You're going to receive an accusation
[1:04:12] against a minister.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; If you don't go by this way right here,
[1:04:17] you're just as wrong as the person
[1:04:19] packing and spreading the lie.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Now, notice they have to swear to it
[1:04:30] that you saw it and prove it. Well,
[1:04:34] sister so and so told me that they said
[1:04:36] that they said that they saw it on
[1:04:37] Facebook. Well, my goodness, that's even
[1:04:40] more absolute than the Bible, ain't it?
[1:04:43] That's the way some people look at it.
[1:04:45] Facebook, Instagram replaces Matthew,
[1:04:47] Mark, Luke, and John.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Not to a believer, they don't.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And then if you did, then that
[1:04:57] sin is rebuked openly that it's wrong.
[1:05:00] Then say, congregation,
[1:05:04] what
[1:05:06] you mean? The pastor does something
[1:05:08] wrong and then they would call the
[1:05:10] prophet down and he was all right. You
[1:05:11] got to go up this way. You got
[1:05:13] witnesses. Y'all, all right, you three
[1:05:14] brothers stand. All right, now y'all
[1:05:17] stand. What did you see? I saw brother
[1:05:19] Donnie. He was out there. Lord have
[1:05:21] mercy. Amber beer running out of his
[1:05:23] mouth. And whenever he saw me, he
[1:05:24] swallowed that could of tobaca. He got
[1:05:27] choked and he spit it out on the bank.
[1:05:29] Brother, are you willing to swear to
[1:05:30] that? Raise your right hand. I swear
[1:05:34] before Almighty God.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Boy, y'all getting tired on a
[1:05:39] tick tonight on me, ain't you?
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Now, come on, friends. Either we believe
[1:05:43] this or we don't. Do we believe it?
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; God has given us the way.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; And notice where it's put back on you
[1:05:52] people.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; My my Then they say, "Congregation, do
[1:05:58] you want to change your pastor? If you
[1:06:00] mean the absolute authoritarianism of
[1:06:03] this so-called cult leader is not going
[1:06:05] to do it.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; No. You know why? He did not have the
[1:06:11] authority from God to do so.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Because the sovereignty lays in the
[1:06:16] church.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Not even in the prophet.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Well, come on somebody.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Not even in the pastor.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; So now I've been with you all what is it
[1:06:27] now, Carol? Going on 38 years maybe.
[1:06:30] This is the 38th year. So, how many of
[1:06:32] you would want to go to work for a
[1:06:35] company? You would give 38 years of your
[1:06:38] life, your brothers that are
[1:06:40] businessmen. So, you'd start a business
[1:06:42] and you'd work and labor and sweat to
[1:06:44] build that business. And then in 38
[1:06:47] years, the employees decide to get rid
[1:06:49] of you.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Would any of y'all want that kind of
[1:06:53] business?
[1:06:55] How many of you would want to give 25 or
[1:06:57] 30 years to some corporation and then
[1:07:00] some of your fellow employees desire to
[1:07:03] to get rid of you so they just vote you
[1:07:05] out.
[1:07:07] Now think about what a position that I
[1:07:09] hold and other pastors around the
[1:07:11] message. I give 38 years of my life
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; to being your pastor. And those that we
[1:07:18] buried and those that have went on to
[1:07:19] the Lord and all that so that I could
[1:07:22] lose my position in this church, all the
[1:07:26] labor, all the preaching, all the
[1:07:29] physical work that I've done, everything
[1:07:31] else right along with it simply by
[1:07:35] majority vote
[1:07:37] and I'm gone.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, how many of you would commit
[1:07:42] your life for 38 years?
[1:07:46] Anybody want to raise your hand? Well,
[1:07:48] at least you ain't liars.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Now, think.
[1:07:54] So, you mean, Brother Donnie, you could
[1:07:56] you could actually be voted out tonight?
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; I could be got rid of tonight.
[1:08:09] Praise the Lord. Ain't this good?
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; I love getting that devil in a spot and
[1:08:15] just pushing him, slamming him right up
[1:08:17] against that piano, taking his big old
[1:08:20] head and sliding it right underneath
[1:08:22] there until his ghoul hangs out his
[1:08:24] tongue.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; That's what the word does to his eye.
[1:08:35] Oh my. If the congregation
[1:08:39] votes forgive him, let him go on. That's
[1:08:44] the way it has to stand.
[1:08:49] So, somebody refresh my memory. So, this
[1:08:52] is the way it worked with David Koresh,
[1:08:54] right?
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; This is the way that it's worked with
[1:09:01] Charles Manson.
[1:09:04] This is the way that it's worked with
[1:09:05] all the famous cult leaders and groups
[1:09:08] that that the people themselves voted
[1:09:10] the leader out, right?
[1:09:18] Oh my,
[1:09:20] that isn't that fair enough way to run a
[1:09:23] church. That's what the Bible said. We
[1:09:25] have no bishops and overseers and boards
[1:09:28] and so forth. Moves this one and got a
[1:09:31] lot of authority. There's nobody got
[1:09:33] authority here but the Holy Ghost. He
[1:09:37] does the moving. Now listen to this. And
[1:09:40] we take him
[1:09:43] as the majority of the people
[1:09:47] the way the people go.
[1:09:53] I guarantee you there's some people
[1:09:54] around this message that don't do it
[1:09:56] this way. But we ain't them people.
[1:10:00] And there's people around the world that
[1:10:01] do it this way. Why? Cuz that lines up
[1:10:04] with the scripture.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; And somebody said,
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; "All right, then where is the
[1:10:10] authoritarianism that a cult leader
[1:10:12] supposed to have?"
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Now notice this how this works even in
[1:10:21] the majority. Then if one side wants to
[1:10:24] do this and the other side wants to do
[1:10:27] that and the side wins, the losing side,
[1:10:32] what do they do about it? I can tell you
[1:10:34] what most of them do about it. They're
[1:10:35] going to cause a split in the church.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Did you ever wonder why we don't have
[1:10:41] any scriptures on how to split a church?
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Do you ever wonder why there ain't no
[1:10:46] quotes in the message that tells us how
[1:10:48] to split a church and set up another
[1:10:50] church? You ever wonder why there's no
[1:10:53] scripture and no quotes for it? Huh? So,
[1:10:57] what do they have then when they do
[1:10:59] that? And what are they building their
[1:11:01] church upon?
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Not the word of God.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Well, glory.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; My my. Now, watch how this one side and
[1:11:10] other side thing works. And the other
[1:11:13] side wants to do that and this side
[1:11:14] wins. The losing side, what do they do
[1:11:17] about it? They join right in with the
[1:11:21] rest of them and say we were wrong.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, boy, that right
[1:11:34] there threw out some of you. Plum out
[1:11:36] the door, did it? For some of you to
[1:11:39] admit that you voted the wrong way
[1:11:44] or some turpentine on your Kool-Aid. My
[1:11:47] my goodness, I can't admit it. I will
[1:11:50] not do it. Hallelujah.
[1:11:53] Suit yourself.
[1:11:56] You're not following the teaching of
[1:11:58] this message.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Now, notice what he tells them to do.
[1:12:03] Join right in with the rest of them and
[1:12:05] say, "We were wrong. then we will go
[1:12:08] right on cuz the Holy Ghost
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; has made that choice.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; So, can we vote wrong?
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; I can.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; But can after I've voted wrong,
[1:12:32] can I go with it?
[1:12:37] Well, let me share something with you
[1:12:39] that a lot of the message people can't
[1:12:40] do. Now, watch. The prophet goes on to
[1:12:42] say like Democrats and Republicans, as
[1:12:44] long as we stand as a democracy, as
[1:12:46] Americans, if the Democrats is in, the
[1:12:50] Republicans should push right on with
[1:12:52] them.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; I'm going to send this to Trump tomorrow
[1:13:00] and then Chuck Schumer and all the rest
[1:13:02] of them on the other side. Been nice
[1:13:05] knowing you all cuz they'll hang me. If
[1:13:08] the Democrats is in, the Republicans
[1:13:10] should push right on with them.
[1:13:12] Republicans in, the Democrat push on.
[1:13:14] That's just exactly what makes us a
[1:13:17] nation. Can't you see why we're in such
[1:13:19] a mess?
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Whenever we break that, we break our
[1:13:24] democracy.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Boy, ain't that quote
[1:13:30] fitting for the day we're living in?
[1:13:32] That's right. Democrats say I ain't
[1:13:34] going to do nothing Republicans is in.
[1:13:36] Then we'll fall.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; I'm a Kuckian. Together we stand and
[1:13:41] divided we fall. So what does this do?
[1:13:45] This cultism of this aspect. It hinges
[1:13:48] on, listen to this church, the
[1:13:50] encouraging
[1:13:52] of maximum dependency
[1:13:54] upon the leader. Then they don't know
[1:13:56] what to do. They can't make those
[1:13:58] decisions on their own. They've got to
[1:14:00] have conser. And the leader wants it
[1:14:02] that way. He does not want them growing
[1:14:05] up. Listen to me. God wants you as your
[1:14:09] pastor. I want you to grow up.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; There will be questions that you'll have
[1:14:14] in your life that you'll have to come to
[1:14:15] me or other ministers. But I don't want
[1:14:18] you relying on me to be your yes and no
[1:14:21] and yes and no and yes and no about
[1:14:23] every decision of your life. God wants
[1:14:26] every one of you to be so full of the
[1:14:28] Holy Ghost that you can go to him in
[1:14:30] prayer and say, "Father, should I do
[1:14:31] that or should I do that?" And you have
[1:14:34] that walk with God. Amen. Don't let
[1:14:37] somebody else replace that for God.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Now watch this. The socalled
[1:14:49] cult leader,
[1:14:52] Total Deliverance, 1954.
[1:14:55] They was talking about building a new
[1:14:57] tabernacle.
[1:15:00] Frankly, myself, when they spoke of a
[1:15:02] new tabernacle to me, I was against the
[1:15:06] thought.
[1:15:08] That's right. I said, "We don't need
[1:15:09] exactly a new tabernacle. I'll probably
[1:15:12] be leaving here pretty soon as the Lord
[1:15:14] showed me what what comes to pass. And
[1:15:16] what do we need a new tabernacle for?"
[1:15:19] And we haven't got the money.
[1:15:22] Then I come down there and I drug out
[1:15:24] the red Kool-Aid. And I said, "Everybody
[1:15:27] that voted against me is a prophet of
[1:15:29] God. Get in this line and drink this
[1:15:32] Kool-Aid.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; You lying hypocrites."
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; I ain't talking about you.
[1:15:42] Put God's prophet
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; in such a status.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Now notice I come down and felt the
[1:15:55] feeling of the church
[1:15:58] that the church in the majority seemed
[1:16:01] to want it. Then what did I do?
[1:16:06] I sacrificed my own thoughts
[1:16:12] and throwed in with
[1:16:16] the church.
[1:16:18] A cult leader,
[1:16:21] a cult leader sacrificed his own
[1:16:24] thoughts which would have brought his
[1:16:26] own leadership into question.
[1:16:30] So you mean, brother Benam, you're
[1:16:31] secondguessing what you thought.
[1:16:37] Why did he do that? Because he
[1:16:40] recognized the body of God,
[1:16:43] God wanted to speak through his
[1:16:46] congregation.
[1:16:47] And unless God showed him a vision or a
[1:16:49] dream or gave him a direct word from the
[1:16:51] Lord,
[1:16:53] this is the way he chose to let the
[1:16:55] church run. This is the way it ought to
[1:16:57] be run this very day.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Now then, what did I do? I sacrificed my
[1:17:02] own thoughts and throwed right in with
[1:17:04] the church. Sure, let's do it.
[1:17:08] Wow.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; So, instead of standing at the door,
[1:17:12] don't do it, Rob. Don't do it, Peter.
[1:17:14] Don't do it, Lance. Don't do it. Here,
[1:17:16] tell pass it around. Pass it around.
[1:17:17] Tell everybody I said no to tell them
[1:17:19] not do it. Instead, brother Brown said,
[1:17:21] let's do it. Let's rally. The majority
[1:17:24] of this church wants to praise God.
[1:17:26] Let's do it.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; That's a real Christian with the Holy
[1:17:30] Ghost.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Thank you, Lord Jesus. That's the
[1:17:37] way it was in the Bible time, the way
[1:17:40] the church voted, the sovereignty, the
[1:17:43] groups of the people, they came together
[1:17:45] in unity, their strength. So therefore,
[1:17:47] I said certainly if that's the way the
[1:17:50] church wants, if that's what God is
[1:17:53] wanting, he's got more of authority to
[1:17:57] vote
[1:17:59] amongst a whole group of people than he
[1:18:03] has to me.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy.
[1:18:11] My
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Well, let me ask you something, Rebecca.
[1:18:17] Can you follow a man like this?
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; I can.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; I can't follow some of these dictators
[1:18:24] in the message. No. Any preacher that
[1:18:27] stand up in the pull pit and let people
[1:18:29] worship him. I ain't got the time of day
[1:18:31] for that bunch myself. I could not
[1:18:34] follow a man like that to the dollar
[1:18:36] store and back. Ain't no way I'd be
[1:18:37] scared death something happen to me on
[1:18:39] my way out. I don't want nothing to do
[1:18:41] with such a thing. I cannot follow a man
[1:18:44] that will not admit his humanity and
[1:18:47] admit his mistakes. Every one of us,
[1:18:50] every great preacher that's ever been
[1:18:52] has had his faults and his failures and
[1:18:54] his mistakes.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; And as a matter of fact, the people of
[1:18:58] God admire you more when they can see
[1:19:01] you admit them and make it right before
[1:19:04] God. And the people, they'll have more
[1:19:05] confidence in you than they did before.
[1:19:08] Everybody will unless they're making an
[1:19:10] idol out of you.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice this now.
[1:19:17] It's what God is wanting. He's got more
[1:19:19] of authority to vote amongst the people
[1:19:21] or the whole group of people than he has
[1:19:23] to me because I have no vision.
[1:19:26] No vision to say that it shouldn't be.
[1:19:31] Praise God.
[1:19:33] So, we throw in with the church and move
[1:19:36] with the church and I'm behind it to do
[1:19:39] all that I can to help out the church.
[1:19:43] That should be the motive of every
[1:19:46] Christian and every person in the church
[1:19:49] is to unify ourselves and stick
[1:19:52] together. Whatever the church votes for,
[1:19:55] that's what we should stand for. Then
[1:19:57] say for instance, they want to change
[1:20:00] something in the church. Well, then the
[1:20:01] trustees want to, somebody else want to,
[1:20:03] the deacon, they want to change
[1:20:04] something, come before the church. And
[1:20:06] if our idea seems a bit a little
[1:20:08] different, listen now, than the church
[1:20:11] does, let's sacrifice.
[1:20:15] Let's sacrifice that idea. Now, why was
[1:20:19] he telling the people that? Cuz that's
[1:20:22] what he did.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; That's what he did.
[1:20:28] He sacrificed
[1:20:30] his idea. It's not a word from the Lord.
[1:20:32] It was not a vision, but it was his
[1:20:35] idea. He didn't want to do it. Oh my.
[1:20:39] Because that's the only way we can stand
[1:20:41] united. And if this church will go on
[1:20:43] the way you're going right now and be
[1:20:44] united together, listen to this,
[1:20:47] children. It's unlimited
[1:20:51] what he'll do.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; If we'll stick together.
[1:20:56] Is it any wonder then Satan wants to
[1:20:59] divide us? He wants to divide us as a
[1:21:02] family, a marriage, home, our church. He
[1:21:05] wants to divide us as a message
[1:21:07] movement. The message community is so
[1:21:10] split and divided. That's why Satan does
[1:21:13] it is to keep the supernatural power of
[1:21:16] God. Oh, we've seen God do great things
[1:21:18] to me. Oh, it's a miniature thing. What
[1:21:21] it could be if we could be united
[1:21:24] together. Oh my. How many want it with
[1:21:26] all your heart by the baptism of the
[1:21:28] Holy Ghost? I ain't talking about making
[1:21:30] a great big denomination. I'm talking
[1:21:32] about unifying on the principles that
[1:21:35] God has given us in this last day.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us Jesus.
[1:21:42] My
[1:21:44] notice,
[1:21:46] that's how we want to be so complete
[1:21:48] with one another. Again, the Hebrew
[1:21:50] says, "By the way, while I'm speaking,
[1:21:52] somebody around this country somewhere
[1:21:54] is guilty of riding some cards to move
[1:21:59] Brother Neville out of this pull pit.
[1:22:02] You're going to have to settle that with
[1:22:03] me." Uhhuh. He says, "That's right."
[1:22:07] Yes, indeed. Said something about the
[1:22:09] deacon. The deacon board has not one
[1:22:11] thing to do with that, pastor.
[1:22:14] No, sir. The congregation in full has
[1:22:18] the authority. A deacon board is just a
[1:22:21] policeman here in this church to keep
[1:22:23] order and so forth. But when it comes to
[1:22:25] the rules, the whole church
[1:22:32] has to say so. This church is built upon
[1:22:35] the sovereignty of the local church.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Now, of course, if you don't believe in
[1:22:41] going to church, I don't guess you have
[1:22:42] no sovereignty or authority. Amen.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Therefore, I have nothing to say in
[1:22:47] moving this pastor. What?
[1:22:52] William Brandom,
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; the founder supposedly of this cult
[1:22:59] had no authority.
[1:23:08] I pray God strikes some of you people
[1:23:10] that streams out here and conviction
[1:23:12] will hit your heart while you're right
[1:23:13] there in front of your computer.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord God, if there's one
[1:23:19] that's redeemable, Father,
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; look at what you're saying versus the
[1:23:23] very facts of what this man taught.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; And the preachers in the message that
[1:23:30] don't do this, don't believe what he
[1:23:32] said.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:36] My I have nothing to do in moving this
[1:23:38] pastor or putting one in. I own the
[1:23:40] property. It's given to the church. You
[1:23:43] all are the church. You are the people,
[1:23:45] the one who control. You're the church
[1:23:47] yourself. And the church, the holy
[1:23:49] church of God is the sovereignty of the
[1:23:52] Holy Spirit in that church. And the only
[1:23:54] thing I do is own the property. Give it
[1:23:55] over to this church. Give it over for a
[1:23:57] church. And it's taxfree. And the church
[1:23:59] elects their own pastors.
[1:24:02] I have nothing
[1:24:06] to do with it.
[1:24:09] And the only way this pastor could ever
[1:24:11] leave would be the pastor decide himself
[1:24:13] to go or the majority of the votes of
[1:24:16] the church would have the say change the
[1:24:19] pastor. That's the only way. And word of
[1:24:22] life said,
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; The trustees have nothing to do with it.
[1:24:30] only repair the church. Oh my, they
[1:24:32] can't do it. The whole trustee board
[1:24:34] must meet and says we build this and we
[1:24:36] do that. Then they have to ask the
[1:24:38] treasur. They've got the money to do it.
[1:24:39] Therefore, no one person has nothing to
[1:24:42] do in this. It's the majority of the
[1:24:44] people. Yes, sir. If 20 votes for him
[1:24:47] and 21 votes against him, he goes or
[1:24:49] vice versa. That is the sovereignty
[1:24:52] of the local church.
[1:24:57] So I can see her
[1:25:00] by now they're
[1:25:02] half a day out
[1:25:08] and Eleazar just got there explaining to
[1:25:10] her why he was not a cult leader
[1:25:15] and she could say
[1:25:18] that's a relief.
[1:25:26] But can you imagine that little girl
[1:25:30] as she now transitions out from under
[1:25:32] the headship that she's known all of her
[1:25:34] life.
[1:25:36] And verse 58 says, "They called Rebecca
[1:25:39] and said unto her, thou goest with this
[1:25:41] man, and she said,
[1:25:44] I will go."
[1:25:47] This one simple act of faith
[1:25:52] changed her life.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; She was changed from being a servant to
[1:26:00] being a bride.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; She was changed to being a little girl
[1:26:04] that was unknown out in the backside of
[1:26:07] a wilderness somewhere. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:26:09] To being one of the great matriarchs of
[1:26:12] the faith of the tribes of Israel.
[1:26:16] changed from a position of loneliness,
[1:26:19] hallelujah, in the world and no doubt
[1:26:21] being a type of the bride. She always
[1:26:24] was a misfit just like most of us in
[1:26:27] this place tonight. Even when you were a
[1:26:30] little child, you was a misfit. Why?
[1:26:32] That seed of God down inside of you was
[1:26:35] crying to be born. It was crying for
[1:26:38] manifestation. And no doubt when she
[1:26:41] began to hear this Harry, it was
[1:26:43] something that rung down in her soul
[1:26:45] truer than anything she had ever heard
[1:26:48] in her entire life.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; She is now changing from poverty,
[1:26:56] from her poverty
[1:26:59] to Isaac's wealth.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Now remember when she
[1:27:06] accepted the rings, when she accepted
[1:27:09] the tab, when she accepted that she had
[1:27:11] become officially engaged as we called
[1:27:14] it or betrothed is the Old Testament
[1:27:16] word for her for for this servant man to
[1:27:19] even be allowed to touch her hand, not
[1:27:22] like today like they do, but for him to
[1:27:24] be allowed, she allowed him to touch her
[1:27:27] hand to put the bracelets on. Amen. And
[1:27:30] the prophet says the earrings as faith
[1:27:31] cometh by hearing and by putting the
[1:27:33] bracelets on was the working of her
[1:27:35] hands. And for her to allow him to do
[1:27:37] that. She did not have to say I accept
[1:27:40] your master as my husband. It was the
[1:27:43] reaction of her hand. Can't you
[1:27:46] understand why God wants you to clap
[1:27:48] yours? Can't you understand why God
[1:27:50] wants you to raise yours in praise?
[1:27:53] There's something about the hands. Amen.
[1:27:56] There's something about the hands. We
[1:27:59] ought to use ours for the glory of God.
[1:28:01] We ought to use ours to be able to
[1:28:03] praise and bless and magnify the name of
[1:28:06] the Lord.
[1:28:10] Oh my
[1:28:13] what what motivated her? Well, this
[1:28:16] messenger
[1:28:18] even though maybe she didn't have any
[1:28:21] credentials
[1:28:22] but she saw proof. She saw proof of the
[1:28:27] wealth of the man he was talking about
[1:28:30] cuz she could tell by looking at that
[1:28:32] man that he himself, you know, he he
[1:28:34] certainly was no rich man himself. This
[1:28:36] decision she made would change her for
[1:28:40] the rest of her life. Not only her. How
[1:28:43] many people down through the ages for
[1:28:44] thousands of years have been blessed by
[1:28:46] hearing this sermon about Rebecca
[1:28:48] preached? It's affected me. Hasn't it
[1:28:51] affected you? This one decision. Think
[1:28:53] of it, friend. She's not a preacher.
[1:28:55] She's not a prophet. But this decision
[1:28:58] of faith has affected people since the
[1:29:00] very day that woman made her decision.
[1:29:02] And some of you think, "I could never do
[1:29:04] nothing for God." When you make your
[1:29:06] decision to serve him, and you're going
[1:29:08] to press beyond all your faults and your
[1:29:10] failure. You never know who's watching
[1:29:13] you. You never know who's looking at you
[1:29:15] and said, "I know they're going through
[1:29:16] a hard time. And if they can do it, I
[1:29:19] can do it, too." It was her decision
[1:29:21] that they rallied around down through
[1:29:24] the ages and even Paul Meyer the writer
[1:29:26] of Hebrews put her in the great heroins
[1:29:29] of faith that Rebecca identified why the
[1:29:32] decision she made. Will you go with this
[1:29:35] man I will go?
[1:29:43] 1 Peter chapter 1:7 that the trial of
[1:29:47] your faith being much more precious than
[1:29:50] of gold that perisheth though it be
[1:29:53] tried with fire might be found unto the
[1:29:56] praise and honor and glory at the
[1:29:59] appearing of Jesus Christ whom having
[1:30:01] not seen.
[1:30:03] Look at the parallel between you and
[1:30:05] Rebecca.
[1:30:07] You've not seen him. You was not there
[1:30:09] at Calvary. You were not there
[1:30:11] physically at the tomb when he raised
[1:30:13] from the dead. You have not seen him. Oh
[1:30:17] my homing have not seen yet love. It's
[1:30:22] no wonder that we seem so crazy and so
[1:30:24] unusual to the world that we give
[1:30:26] everything we are. Oh that poor man and
[1:30:28] his wife and them two boys that gave
[1:30:30] their life for the cause of Christ to
[1:30:32] something that was totally invisible.
[1:30:34] But yet the visibility become manifest
[1:30:37] after a while, didn't it? when they seen
[1:30:39] a life a man that would stand there and
[1:30:41] give his life and all that he had.
[1:30:43] Praise God for the very cause of Jesus
[1:30:46] Christ
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; whom having not seen ye love in whom
[1:30:52] though now ye see him not yet believing.
[1:30:56] How many can say amen to that?
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, I've not held his hands. I've not
[1:31:00] reached down and touched his precious
[1:31:02] feet, but I believe anyhow. I'm waiting
[1:31:05] for the day. I'm waiting for the day
[1:31:07] when I'll be able to do that.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; But what did he say? Oh my. Whom they
[1:31:11] have not seen you love. And whom though
[1:31:14] now you see him not. Repeats it again
[1:31:16] yet believe and you sit around with a
[1:31:19] mlly grubs all sad and low down and you
[1:31:21] don't even clap your hands. You ain't
[1:31:22] got a smile on your face in 6 months and
[1:31:24] you're just poor little old me. Poor
[1:31:26] little old me. Wowy wy woo. That ain't
[1:31:28] what Peter said. But he said you rejoice
[1:31:31] with joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[1:31:35] [Applause]
[1:31:37] Oh my
[1:31:40] praise be to God. Oh,
[1:31:44] thank you Lord Jesus.
[1:31:46] How in the world I I whenever I I was
[1:31:50] studying on this, I found where one of
[1:31:52] the Bible commentators had made this
[1:31:54] statement about her. She was thought of
[1:31:58] before she knew it and was chosen when
[1:32:02] she did not know of the existence of her
[1:32:06] bridegroom.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; She was thought of before she knew it.
[1:32:13] And she, oh glory, she was thought of
[1:32:16] before she knew it and was chosen
[1:32:20] when she did not even know of the
[1:32:23] existence of her bridegroom. And I ask
[1:32:25] you tonight, Rebecca, when were you
[1:32:27] chosen? The night you come to the altar,
[1:32:29] the night your daddy talked to you about
[1:32:31] the Lord before the foundation of the
[1:32:34] world. And there ain't enough devils in
[1:32:35] hell to break that everlasting covenant
[1:32:37] with a bride.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Rebecca was betrolled and accompanied
[1:32:42] the servant to the land
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; of Canaan.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him tonight with all your
[1:32:53] heart?
[1:32:55] Notice this. The prophet said, "Then
[1:32:56] there was another great decision that
[1:32:58] had to be made after she was given." And
[1:33:01] the parents said, "Well, just let her
[1:33:03] stay around about 10 days and let her
[1:33:05] hang around the revival to really feel
[1:33:08] whether she has decided to do it or not.
[1:33:11] I haven't got much confidence in a
[1:33:13] person to make a decision to wait even
[1:33:15] until tomorrow."
[1:33:17] Why the devil talk you out of it? But
[1:33:19] the message, the message
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; had stirred
[1:33:25] Rebecca.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Friends, don't you understand? This is
[1:33:28] why people can walk away from this great
[1:33:31] message. It never stirred them. It never
[1:33:35] stirred them like the angel. Oh, glory.
[1:33:38] Did Rebecca that day? Why? You've had
[1:33:42] your hard times. You've had your
[1:33:43] difficulties. You've had this that and
[1:33:45] the other. And because people cannot
[1:33:48] answer a few things about the message
[1:33:50] and about this story and that story. I
[1:33:53] told Carol the other day, I said, "I
[1:33:54] probably got more of them human elements
[1:33:56] than any of these defectors. I've had a
[1:33:59] file for years and years and years." And
[1:34:01] she said, "Yeah, and it ain't turns you
[1:34:03] away." And I said, "No, it won't because
[1:34:05] I'm not looking at that. I'm not
[1:34:07] looking. I I realize that we have been
[1:34:09] called by almighty God, not by a
[1:34:12] Kuckian."
[1:34:13] [Music]
[1:34:15] Praise be to God.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; She
[1:34:23] was satisfied.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; The message.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Was from God.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; So let the parents said, "Oh, let her
[1:34:36] stick around a while. She'll get over
[1:34:38] it."
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; We still ain't got over it, have we?
[1:34:41] It's just a little excitement. She was
[1:34:44] over to that revival, you know. But oh,
[1:34:47] the true servant said, "Don't worry us.
[1:34:49] Don't hinder me." A lot of the servants
[1:34:52] of God has been hindered by put off
[1:34:54] decisions.
[1:34:56] Don't hinder me saying that the Lord has
[1:34:59] sent me, seeing that he's been good to
[1:35:00] me. Don't hinder me. Then they said,
[1:35:02] "Let her make her own decision." That's
[1:35:04] where you stand tonight. Make your own
[1:35:07] decision. Then they called Rebecca and
[1:35:10] said, "Will you go with this man or do
[1:35:13] you want to stay around a little while
[1:35:16] to see if you really want to do it?" She
[1:35:19] said, "I will go." She was ready. Her
[1:35:22] decision was quickly made. Amen.
[1:35:26] Something had been leading her.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Notice he didn't say someone.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; It was not the man, Elizer. It was not
[1:35:35] her mama. It was not her brother. It was
[1:35:37] the presence of God.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:41] Now notice, she commits herself.
[1:35:44] She commits herself.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; By accepting this message, this message
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; of this unusual person.
[1:35:55] and she will live the rest of her life
[1:35:59] in a different sphere because of the
[1:36:03] message she heard and received.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Now this characterized by the way she
[1:36:11] done this characterized the faith of
[1:36:15] Abraham
[1:36:18] and she didn't even know him.
[1:36:20] So, she's believing in the same way her
[1:36:24] future father-in-law believed
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; cuz he claimed those things which were
[1:36:30] not as though they were.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; And he didn't consider his own body now
[1:36:35] dead, neither deadness of Sarah's womb,
[1:36:37] but he looked at the promise of God. And
[1:36:40] this is what Eleazar is looking for in a
[1:36:42] bride to marry Isaac. A woman that will
[1:36:45] be compatible with the revelation of the
[1:36:49] message that the whole family was now
[1:36:51] needed to be have. Now it said we
[1:36:53] absolutely know that Esau didn't have
[1:36:55] it. Others down through the same lineage
[1:36:57] did not have it. But this is what he's
[1:37:00] looking for. Those who can receive the
[1:37:03] word.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Lord. So when Abraham
[1:37:10] notice was instructed to circumcise the
[1:37:14] males of his household,
[1:37:17] he didn't wait 3 days and let me pray
[1:37:19] about it. Let me go on a fast now for
[1:37:20] about 7 days or 10 days. But the Bible
[1:37:22] says early the next morning
[1:37:27] again after Abraham was instructed to
[1:37:30] offer his son as a burnt offering early
[1:37:34] the next morning. Don't you see why
[1:37:36] Satan wants you to put off decisions?
[1:37:38] And the spirit of God will speak to you
[1:37:40] and deal with you. Quit this. Don't get
[1:37:42] around that person. Stay away from them.
[1:37:44] Leave them alone. Don't do this. Don't
[1:37:46] do that. And you keep hanging on and
[1:37:48] hanging on and hanging on and putting
[1:37:52] off a decision. Oh, hear me tonight,
[1:37:54] church.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; But you see, Abraham did not wait. Why?
[1:37:59] He knew his humanity. It would try to
[1:38:02] talk him out of Brother Nathan. Why?
[1:38:03] There's no way this can be sensible that
[1:38:05] God would want me to act like a heathen.
[1:38:08] The heathen Canaanites offer their
[1:38:10] children as a burnt offering. God cannot
[1:38:13] surely mean that. That ain't what God
[1:38:15] meant. Maybe it was spiritual. Somehow
[1:38:17] it was spiritual. I better take another
[1:38:19] day or two and think about it. But he
[1:38:21] acted immediately. Why? He was afraid.
[1:38:24] That human element overwhelming. Come
[1:38:26] on, don't sit there and look at me like
[1:38:27] you don't know what I'm talking about.
[1:38:28] How many of us have talked oursel out of
[1:38:31] the will of God because we delayed and
[1:38:33] we waited and we delayed?
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[1:38:39] Lord Jesus.
[1:38:42] Hallelujah.
[1:38:44] So you imagine this is Rebecca's
[1:38:47] disposition toward the message. Delayed
[1:38:52] disobedience
[1:38:54] only weakens faith.
[1:38:57] So you keep putting it off. Well, I'm
[1:38:59] going to pray about it and I'm going to
[1:39:01] I'm going to do like Gideon. I'm going
[1:39:03] to put out a fleece and then I'm going
[1:39:05] to put out a pig and then I'm going to
[1:39:07] put out a cow. What are you going to do?
[1:39:08] Put out everything you got?
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Can you show me in the New Testament
[1:39:14] where they done that?
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; And some of you make decisions about
[1:39:20] your life and your family based on such
[1:39:23] things.
[1:39:25] Well, in the morning, if it's still on
[1:39:26] my mind and I'm still breathing, I'll
[1:39:29] know it's from God.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; The devil will make sure you live at
[1:39:33] least till 10:00.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; He loves it when we get out of the will
[1:39:40] of God.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, I've got a fleece before the Lord.
[1:39:44] I've got a fleece. The Bible does not
[1:39:47] say sons of God are led by fleeces.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; It says they are led by the spirit of
[1:39:53] God.
[1:39:54] Come on, somebody. Oh, somebody don't
[1:39:56] like this shirt here tonight. Who is it?
[1:39:58] I keep looking. I'll find you here in a
[1:39:59] minute. Why did God give you the Holy
[1:40:02] Ghost? Not so I'm going to put my coat
[1:40:03] out tonight. If it's dry all around it
[1:40:05] in the morning, I'll know it's the Lord.
[1:40:07] Well, the devil had a bunch of angels
[1:40:08] camping around all over it if he thought
[1:40:10] he could mess you up and 25 more people
[1:40:12] along with you. Come on, somebody. But
[1:40:14] we got the Holy Ghost. We don't need, my
[1:40:18] friends. We don't need to call this man
[1:40:20] or that man. You got a word from the
[1:40:21] Lord for me? Have you got this from it?
[1:40:23] What about a dream? What about this,
[1:40:25] that, and the other? As many as are led
[1:40:27] by the spirit of God, they are the sons
[1:40:29] of God.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; You see, when we delay our obedience,
[1:40:41] 10 days can turn into 10 weeks.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; 10 weeks turn into 10 months.
[1:40:48] 10 months turn into 10 years.
[1:40:51] And you've lost those 10 years of your
[1:40:53] life for what?
[1:40:56] Delayed obedience.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Speak, Lord Jesus.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Let me close with this here momentarily.
[1:41:07] And they sent away Rebecca,
[1:41:10] their sister,
[1:41:12] and her nurse,
[1:41:15] and Abraham's servant,
[1:41:18] and his men.
[1:41:20] Now as she leaves,
[1:41:23] she is now the bride elect,
[1:41:29] but her actual union with Isaac will not
[1:41:33] occur
[1:41:36] for another month or so.
[1:41:39] So while she's going along on this
[1:41:42] journey,
[1:41:44] there's an invisible union that's being
[1:41:47] formed in her heart toward this man that
[1:41:52] the this servant is describing.
[1:41:55] Now, you know, he didn't take all of his
[1:41:57] time. As a matter of fact, brother Ben
[1:41:58] said whenever he got there that he
[1:42:00] didn't even have time to talk about
[1:42:02] himself. He didn't talk about his
[1:42:04] campaigns and how many people he had
[1:42:06] prayed for and how many people got
[1:42:08] healed and got that. and all the other.
[1:42:10] He said he was so busy talking about his
[1:42:15] master. Now, he knows that he has but a
[1:42:18] limited time by pulling this girl out of
[1:42:22] this scenario that she's in. 16 years
[1:42:25] old, still moldable, still changeable,
[1:42:27] and he's got a limited time. I don't
[1:42:29] imagine he waited till they got about
[1:42:30] 383 miles down the road. And then he
[1:42:33] said, "You know what? If only got a
[1:42:34] little bit further, I better go and tell
[1:42:35] her about the bridegroom." Imagine when
[1:42:37] he got out, she started getting calmed
[1:42:38] and relaxed and either she started out a
[1:42:41] question and answer session or he
[1:42:43] started just go ahead and preaching on
[1:42:44] God and simplicity of the breach God and
[1:42:47] simplicity breaking open the seals and
[1:42:49] helping Rebecca to see who this man was
[1:42:52] because he's got a journey not only to
[1:42:54] pick the right one and a great
[1:42:56] obligation to pick the right one but to
[1:42:59] help her fall in love with this
[1:43:01] bridegroom. Cuz remember, just heard the
[1:43:03] prophet say today, whenever he saw her
[1:43:06] and she saw him, it was love at first
[1:43:10] sight.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. It was love at first
[1:43:14] sight. So, it didn't have to iron them
[1:43:16] down. Okay. What size is your feet? Let
[1:43:17] me see. How long is your hair, your
[1:43:19] eyes? What color is your eyes? I don't
[1:43:20] like hazel eyes. No, no, no. You're I
[1:43:21] don't like hazel eyes. She didn't have
[1:43:23] to weigh him on a set of scales. How
[1:43:24] much do you weigh now? Let me see your
[1:43:26] father because you will become what your
[1:43:28] father is. So, I don't know. Has he got
[1:43:29] hair? Is he not got hair? You know, how
[1:43:31] big is he? How big around is he? Well,
[1:43:33] praise the Lord. But what I what this
[1:43:36] servant had done had brought such drama
[1:43:39] and such dramatics of reality to her
[1:43:44] every day. Imagine she'd lay down at
[1:43:47] night.
[1:43:48] Oh,
[1:43:50] I feel like I already know him.
[1:43:56] Wow. I'm going to marry a man I've never
[1:43:59] seen before. But somehow it's like
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; we've always been together. Like
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; it's almost like it's almost like I mean
[1:44:10] like you know like that we we stepped
[1:44:14] out of eternity together.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; I mean I I can't explain really what
[1:44:20] what's going on here within me. I know
[1:44:22] it's me. I'm changing somehow. And the
[1:44:26] words that he keeps saying, it's like an
[1:44:28] open book that just But the book is a
[1:44:32] person. The book is a person. And every
[1:44:35] page that he turns of this person's
[1:44:37] life, I'm falling more in love not with
[1:44:40] the messenger,
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; but with his message of introduction to
[1:44:45] Isaac. The problem is friends, a lot of
[1:44:48] the message folks, they fell in love
[1:44:49] with brother Brandham more than they do
[1:44:50] the Lord Jesus.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; They want to talk about brother Brandham
[1:44:53] more than they do the Lord Jesus.
[1:44:54] Brother Brandham, this brother Brandham,
[1:44:56] Brother Brandon, Brother Brandham. I
[1:44:57] think we ought to give credit to the
[1:44:58] servant of God what he deserves. But he
[1:45:00] did not die for us. He did not raise
[1:45:02] from the dead for us. He's not coming
[1:45:04] back from for us. He was a sinner saved
[1:45:07] by the grace of God. He is our brother.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Say it again. He is our brother. We're
[1:45:15] not here to worship William, Mary, and
[1:45:17] Brandham. As a matter of fact, he taught
[1:45:20] us against such heretic things in the
[1:45:23] first place. We are here to worship our
[1:45:26] Lord Jesus. But we do believe our Lord
[1:45:29] Jesus has sent us an Eleaser.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:45:40] praise God.
[1:45:45] Now watch as she's fixing to leave in
[1:45:48] verse 60.
[1:45:50] And they blessed Rebecca.
[1:45:53] and said unto her, "Thou art our sister.
[1:45:59] Be thou the mother
[1:46:02] of thousands
[1:46:05] of millions,
[1:46:11] and let thy seed
[1:46:14] possess the gate
[1:46:17] of those which hate him."
[1:46:22] Now, I marvel at this
[1:46:25] because it wasn't over there in that
[1:46:26] land
[1:46:29] that the Lord God gave this message of
[1:46:32] his seed possessing the gate to Abraham,
[1:46:34] but it's when he come out.
[1:46:37] I marvel that they knew about it.
[1:46:41] Where did they hear this at?
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; So, they are saying something upon her.
[1:46:52] their blessing upon her.
[1:46:55] It's not even for them.
[1:46:58] But God used them to pronounce this
[1:47:03] on Rebecca.
[1:47:11] sort of reminds me, Carol, dear,
[1:47:14] of that Sunday morning that you and I
[1:47:16] got married,
[1:47:20] but we believed in going to church. So,
[1:47:22] we got married Sunday morning.
[1:47:25] We went to church on Sunday night.
[1:47:28] My uncle, I never heard him preach on
[1:47:30] predestination or election or
[1:47:31] fornowledge,
[1:47:33] but at the end of the service, I got up
[1:47:35] to play my guitar and sang and all that.
[1:47:38] And my uncle called Carol up, laid hands
[1:47:41] on both of us and wanted to pray for us.
[1:47:43] Start speaking in tongues,
[1:47:46] prophesying.
[1:47:49] Yeah. The Lord God say, "I called you
[1:47:52] before the foundation of the world.
[1:47:55] I ordained you and predestinated you." I
[1:47:58] mean, I'd heard of them words in the
[1:48:00] Bible, but I didn't even know what them
[1:48:01] meant. I was so ignorant of the Bible.
[1:48:06] I'm not sure my uncle did. I don't
[1:48:08] remember hearing preach. Did you? But
[1:48:10] you know what they was doing? God was
[1:48:12] using him. He was a good man. We'll see
[1:48:14] him one of these days, Harry. Good man
[1:48:16] that loved God. Hallelujah.
[1:48:19] I called you before the foundation of
[1:48:21] the world. I predestinated you to be
[1:48:23] together. I mean, went through all these
[1:48:25] words and we're just standing there. Oh
[1:48:27] Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you,
[1:48:28] Jesus. You see, that's one church
[1:48:30] service I'm glad we didn't miss. Ain't
[1:48:31] you Carol? Now, we could have went out
[1:48:33] on our honeymoon. I don't think we could
[1:48:35] have had any better honeymoon than what
[1:48:36] we had right there. That night we heard
[1:48:38] from eternity.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Notice be thou the mother of thousands
[1:48:46] of millions.
[1:48:52] And she was the
[1:48:56] and the Israelites
[1:49:02] both sprang from her.
[1:49:07] Let thy seed possess the gate of those
[1:49:09] that hate them. Exercise dominion and
[1:49:12] authority over their enemies.
[1:49:16] I do wish Hezbollah,
[1:49:19] Hamas,
[1:49:20] Syria, Iran, all the rest of them that
[1:49:24] hate Israel.
[1:49:27] I wish they'd read this in the Bible.
[1:49:30] God has destroyed nations for that
[1:49:33] little tiny place.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; The land of Israel about the size of the
[1:49:36] state of New Jersey. Just recently,
[1:49:39] Syria was going to be the great mighty
[1:49:41] power that was going to do this and that
[1:49:42] and the other. Look at it today on its
[1:49:44] knees.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Look at Iran. It ain't been but just a
[1:49:47] few mo months ago that our nation itself
[1:49:51] was so concerned about what Iran was
[1:49:54] going to do. And this very day, Iran is
[1:49:57] almost on its knees. Even their
[1:49:59] president saying they have no more water
[1:50:02] to drink. You can't fight a war without
[1:50:04] water now, can you? So what did God say?
[1:50:08] I'll curse them that curse you. I'll
[1:50:11] bless them that bless you. Now you see,
[1:50:14] you want to marry a woman, brothers,
[1:50:17] brother,
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; that God can say the same thing about
[1:50:20] your wife that he says about you
[1:50:23] sisters. You want to marry a man that
[1:50:26] God can say the same thing to your
[1:50:29] husband that he can say to you. God
[1:50:31] could not have said this to a daughter
[1:50:35] of
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Canaan.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; God could not have said this prophecy to
[1:50:40] a Canaanite.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Why don't y'all come over and join us?
[1:50:50] Why don't y'all Boy, y'all got some good
[1:50:52] music. Y'all got some good preachers.
[1:50:54] Sign your church in with us. We don't
[1:50:56] want to be identified with them
[1:50:58] Canaanite
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Woo! Lord have mercy.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; And you just remember, you heard it from
[1:51:06] an idiot. Okay. Somebody that did not
[1:51:09] even graduate from high school, all of
[1:51:12] those who stand against this bride, you
[1:51:15] will be condemned.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; You will be judged.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; That's not my words. That's the words of
[1:51:22] Almighty God. All the price he's paid
[1:51:24] for his beloved. All that he's done for
[1:51:27] his beloved and for those who ridicule
[1:51:29] her life at her, make fun at her. Oh, I
[1:51:32] tell you one thing. I don't want to be
[1:51:33] one of them. Do you?
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:51:38] Let me close. You see, a preacher's got
[1:51:41] a lot of doors open when he's preaching.
[1:51:43] So you when you say, "Brother Don, you
[1:51:44] saying you've been closing?" Well, I'm
[1:51:45] closing one door after another after
[1:51:47] another after another. I've had a lot of
[1:51:48] doors open. our text. So I'm closed.
[1:51:51] And Rebecca
[1:51:53] arose
[1:51:55] and her
[1:51:58] damsels
[1:52:02] and they rode upon the camels
[1:52:04] and
[1:52:08] what followed the man.
[1:52:13] And the servant took Rebecca
[1:52:18] and went
[1:52:20] his way.
[1:52:23] So what was his way?
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; God's way.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; And I'm closing the last door.
[1:52:33] I hear God's prophet say something like
[1:52:35] this.
[1:52:37] And you can only serve God on earth.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. is God's servants that sent on
[1:52:43] earth
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; interpret God's word
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; to you.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Wilt thou follow this man? Now remember
[1:52:57] it's twofold. It's Christ Jesus first of
[1:53:00] all and then Christ Jesus sent us a
[1:53:02] messenger.
[1:53:04] I can say yes to both.
[1:53:07] I have decided
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; I'll follow Jesus.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; No turning back.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; No turning back. I gave him my teens, my
[1:53:20] 20s, my 30s, my 40s, my 50s. I'm in the
[1:53:25] last year of my 60s.
[1:53:28] Brother John, don't you regret going out
[1:53:30] and sewing wild oats? No, I don't regret
[1:53:32] sewing wild oats. I'm glad I sowed good
[1:53:34] ones. The only regrets I have is the
[1:53:37] mistakes I've made. I have no regrets
[1:53:42] of giving my life to Jesus. As brother
[1:53:44] Rem said, I only wish I had more than
[1:53:45] one to give him. How many feels the same
[1:53:48] way tonight?
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Has it been easy? No, that ain't been
[1:53:51] easy, but I wouldn't want it to be easy.
[1:53:54] I want to fall in the way of the Lord's
[1:53:55] despised few.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Now, we're going to sing the song that I
[1:53:59] gave you the story of.
[1:54:02] And I want you to think now, if you'd
[1:54:05] have been there in the crowd that day,
[1:54:06] would you have questioned Jesus
[1:54:10] that Jesus allowed them two innocent
[1:54:12] boys to be killed,
[1:54:14] that innocent mother to be killed,
[1:54:17] and then that innocent man, you stand
[1:54:19] there said, "How could that be the glory
[1:54:20] of God? How in the world could God ever
[1:54:22] get something out of that?"
[1:54:24] You see, that's the way it can be in our
[1:54:26] lives, too. We look and think, "I just
[1:54:27] don't understand. I don't understand
[1:54:28] it." No. and you probably never will,
[1:54:33] but I've served him long enough to know
[1:54:35] when I don't understand him, I trust him
[1:54:38] anyway,
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; cuz he's God. And I know I ain't
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; And you know what? I know you all ain't
[1:54:46] either.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; So, we might as well just accept it.
[1:54:50] He's the mighty God and we're little
[1:54:51] nothings
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; without him.
[1:54:55] So if he wants to take this from me to
[1:54:57] make me this. If he wants to take that
[1:54:59] from me to make me this. I wonder when
[1:55:02] all them tribes people then you wonder
[1:55:04] how many of them went out and witnessed
[1:55:05] to others and they went out and
[1:55:06] witnessed to others and they went out
[1:55:08] and witnessed to others. I wonder how
[1:55:09] many will be standing there the day that
[1:55:11] day when them four people walk up there
[1:55:12] and Jesus gives them a martyr's crown
[1:55:16] and then they'll look back behind them
[1:55:17] and they'll be all them people that
[1:55:20] believed.
[1:55:22] Not because they're long dress and the
[1:55:24] long hair, but because they suffered
[1:55:27] and they died.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; I can't wait to meet that family.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; I have decided
[1:55:43] to follow Jesus.
[1:55:47] Pick up the Lord.
[1:55:49] I have decided
[1:55:54] to follow
[1:55:56] Jesus.
[1:56:00] I have decided.
[1:56:05] Aren't you glad you did it, brother Ben?
[1:56:07] So many years ago, my brother,
[1:56:11] no turning back.
[1:56:14] Thank God.
[1:56:17] No turning back.
[1:56:20] Are you sure?
[1:56:22] If none go with me,
[1:56:28] still I will fall.
[1:56:33] Oh, if none go with me,
[1:56:39] still I will follow.
[1:56:45] If none knows
[1:56:48] me,
[1:56:50] still I will follow.
[1:56:56] No turning back.
[1:57:01] What about young people? Have we
[1:57:03] decided? Can we sing it together? I have
[1:57:06] decided. I have decided
[1:57:12] to follow Jesus.
[1:57:17] Oh, I have decided
[1:57:23] I'm going to follow
[1:57:25] Jesus.
[1:57:29] I have decided.
[1:57:33] Thank you, Lord God. Thank you for
[1:57:35] helping me make that decision so many
[1:57:37] years ago. Lord,
[1:57:40] help me, Lord, that your spirit moved on
[1:57:43] me when I Lord, I didn't throw my
[1:57:46] teenage years away or my 20s or my 30s
[1:57:49] or whatever. Lord, thank you, Lord, for
[1:57:51] helping me, dear God. Thank you, Lord
[1:57:54] Jesus. Oh, Father, maybe some here
[1:57:57] tonight they've still not made that
[1:57:59] commitment. May the spirit of God move
[1:58:01] on their hearts out here Lord that they
[1:58:04] can make a complete surrender in the
[1:58:07] presence of God.
[1:58:10] Oh hallelujah.
[1:58:12] What about it brother? If your children
[1:58:15] are taken there in India that day are
[1:58:19] you going to follow him? I have decided
[1:58:22] to follow Jesus. No turning back.
[1:58:29] No turning back.
[1:58:33] Oh my, don't not go with me. So your
[1:58:39] wife and your two sons are laying dead
[1:58:42] in front of you and the spirit of God
[1:58:46] speak these words out of you. Don't none
[1:58:49] go with me.
[1:58:51] Still I will follow.
[1:58:57] Oh no. And now you're asked, I give you
[1:59:02] one more chance to turn your back on
[1:59:04] Jesus.
[1:59:05] Will you turn away?
[1:59:08] No turning back.
[1:59:12] No,
[1:59:13] I won't turn back. I have decided. I
[1:59:20] have decided
[1:59:24] I'm going to follow
[1:59:27] Jesus.
[1:59:29] Aren't you glad you have decided
[1:59:35] to follow
[1:59:38] Jesus?
[1:59:41] Hallelujah.
[1:59:42] Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, we worship you
[1:59:46] tonight, Father.
[1:59:48] Follow Jesus.
[1:59:52] No turning back.
[1:59:58] No turning
[2:00:00] back.
[2:00:05] Hallelujah.
[2:00:09] Sing the camel train for us.
[2:00:12] Praise the Lord. Before Harry sings,
[2:00:16] I didn't hear all the requests that
[2:00:18] Brother Louie had had made known, but or
[2:00:20] or Justin rather, but I I know I'm I'm
[2:00:23] aware of several folks in the church
[2:00:26] that are sick and really dealing with
[2:00:28] some really difficult situations right
[2:00:30] now. And I'd like for us as believers if
[2:00:33] we could just join together before we
[2:00:36] sing this song. If you'd like to take
[2:00:38] someone by the hand or lay your hand
[2:00:39] over on the shoulder or whatever, move
[2:00:41] out if you don't feel comfortable by the
[2:00:43] person you're standing beside so we can
[2:00:47] right now as the saints of God. The
[2:00:49] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[2:00:54] man
[2:00:55] avaleth much.
[2:00:58] And it's not just men either that God's
[2:01:00] here. God hears the daughters.
[2:01:03] If any two on earth agree touching
[2:01:06] anything, it shall be done. If ye abide
[2:01:09] in me, and my words abide in you, ask
[2:01:14] what you will. Delight thyself also in
[2:01:17] the Lord, and he will give thee the
[2:01:19] desires of thine heart. Hitherto you've
[2:01:23] asked nothing in my name, but ask that
[2:01:27] your joys may be full. Knock and it
[2:01:30] shall be open unto you. Seek, you shall
[2:01:33] find.
[2:01:35] Let's knock together. Let's seek
[2:01:37] together.
[2:01:39] Heavenly Father, just today, Father God,
[2:01:43] we've heard of
[2:01:45] different ones in the church that are
[2:01:47] sick. Brother Keith's Lynch, at least
[2:01:50] they were able to hopefully finally
[2:01:52] diagnose, Lord, what he's going through
[2:01:55] and facing his gallbladder to be removed
[2:01:58] tomorrow, Father. And Sister Becky
[2:02:01] Lynch, Brother Melvin had text me this
[2:02:03] evening, Lord, and he had to take her
[2:02:06] father in for medical attention as well.
[2:02:09] And then, dear God, you hear this
[2:02:11] precious little this little child. Lord
[2:02:14] God, we're asking for her. Dear Jesus,
[2:02:19] you see this situation and Lord, you
[2:02:22] know the rarity of this thing that she's
[2:02:24] been diagnosed with. But Father, it does
[2:02:27] not change your power. Lord, others in
[2:02:30] the church that are sick and afflicted,
[2:02:32] some weary from fighting battles, and
[2:02:35] some, Lord, they feel like their
[2:02:36] strength is gone, and they may feel
[2:02:38] distraught and heavy tonight. But Lord
[2:02:41] God, as your children, we agree
[2:02:43] together. Father, I really wonder what
[2:02:46] our church what our church would be able
[2:02:49] to see by your great hands if we could
[2:02:52] have the unity that the prophet
[2:02:54] described to us right here tonight. If
[2:02:57] we would be able to just lay aside our
[2:02:59] differences and our petty arguments of
[2:03:02] this and that and the other and just say
[2:03:04] we're brothers. We disagree, but but
[2:03:06] we're brothers. We're sisters and we
[2:03:08] disagree, but we're sisters and we we
[2:03:11] want the same thing. I believe Lord
[2:03:14] there will be a church. There is a
[2:03:16] church already in the making, already on
[2:03:19] the earth right now. Oh hallelujah. That
[2:03:22] Satan will not be able to stop. Oh
[2:03:25] father, I pray that you would help us to
[2:03:28] be a part of that group of believers.
[2:03:30] Lord, we agree together, Father, for
[2:03:33] those that are hurting, those that are
[2:03:35] needy, those that are sick. Father,
[2:03:37] those dealing with oppression and
[2:03:39] sadness and all the things that Satan
[2:03:41] brings against your children, move for
[2:03:44] them tonight. Lord, we believe together
[2:03:46] in the name of Jesus Christ. And the
[2:03:50] saints of God said,
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sing it for us. Let's sing it
[2:03:54] together. Oh, praise the Lord. Right
[2:03:57] before we get ready to dismiss, how many
[2:03:58] can say, "It's been good to be at the
[2:04:00] house of the Lord tonight." Amen.
[2:04:04] It was a day in early springtime by an
[2:04:08] ancient wayside well. Eler
[2:04:12] paused to rest his camel train.
[2:04:18] He had found a bride for Isaac
[2:04:22] the evening shadows fall for his weary
[2:04:27] journey had not been in vain.
[2:04:33] So he took the fair
[2:04:36] dressed in jewels rich and rare quickly
[2:04:41] to her waiting bridegroom far away.
[2:04:47] Oh where Rebecca loved her Isaac and he
[2:04:52] loved Rebecca fair. Oh it must have been
[2:04:57] a happy wedding day.
[2:05:01] Everybody now. Oh,
[2:05:05] get ready. The shadows fall.
[2:05:11] Don't you hear the alies call
[2:05:17] for there's already been a wedding.
[2:05:21] Greater joy will soon begin
[2:05:26] in the evening when the tra comes in.
[2:05:31] I want to sing it again now. Oh,
[2:05:35] get ready. Demon
[2:05:38] shadows fall. Aren't you glad you've
[2:05:41] heard it? Aren't you glad you've heard
[2:05:44] the ele?
[2:05:47] Thank God there's already been a
[2:05:50] wedding. Greater joys will soon begin
[2:05:56] in the evening when the camel train
[2:06:00] comes in.
[2:06:01] [Music]
[2:06:03] Now our blessed holy father
[2:06:07] sent a prophet from above. He came down
[2:06:12] to earth to find an elected bride.
[2:06:16] Praise God for our Isaac over yonder has
[2:06:23] prepared his tents of love and he wants
[2:06:27] his fair Rebecca by his side. Everybody
[2:06:32] now praise God. Oh
[2:06:36] get ready
[2:06:39] shadows fall. God bless you saints. I
[2:06:42] love you the Lord.
[2:06:49] already been a wedding. Greater joy will
[2:06:54] soon begin
[2:06:57] in the evening when the camel train
[2:07:00] comes in.
[2:07:05] Oh, get ready.
[2:07:08] The evening shadows fall.
[2:07:12] Don't you hear the alies call?
[2:07:19] There's already been the wedding.
[2:07:22] Greater joy will soon begin
[2:07:27] in the evening when the camel train
[2:07:31] comes.
[2:07:36] Amen. Let's just sing this little song
[2:07:39] as we go. with the only song I could
[2:07:40] really think of that fit fit that I
[2:07:43] could remember. Be no turning back.
[2:07:45] Amen. Let's just sing this as we get
[2:07:47] ready to go.
[2:07:49] Be no turning back.
[2:07:53] Will there be no turning back?

[2:08:07] follow Jesus. I have decided to follow
[2:08:11] my Lord. I have decided to follow Jesus.
