all praise of all days [Music] is wow is is you lord praise the lord hallelujah amen thank the lord we can certainly say that tonight can't we gracious in that in the name of the lord and wonderful privilege for us to be gathered together again in god's house ii timothy chapter 3 verse 1. second timothy chapter 3 verse 1. he believes in prophecy prophecy has always been from the garden of eden one of the attributes of our father as a matter of fact he was the first one to prophesy he gave his word and his promise of the promised seed that would come and bruise the serpent's head so prophecy is something that believers real bible believers hold to it's not something that we have to try to make happen or even sometimes that we fully understand it until it's right before us and then there it is and that oh my goodness so you know the prophet said that god fulfills his word by bringing it to pass but let's read tonight of some of these prophecies of the end time this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come we can say amen to that coming up for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god my goodness what kind of people are these well i'll tell you what kind they are most of them are religious church-going people now if you think this is describing infidels they're even worse than this this prophecy is pertaining to apostasy not agnostics it's not those on the extreme left of the political spectrum that do not believe in god i got your attention now donna traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god ah man you believe me having a form of godliness and the word godliness in the greek means to be like god so all of the above people now with this one included 19 adjectives compound and singular that paul uses to describe the people in the last day and all of these people right here are apostates now can you imagine then what the rest of the world which are agnostics infidels islam and on and on and on hindu and all the rest of the people that don't even follow in the line of christianity this is only the apostate group wow notice this having a form of godliness but denying the dunamis the dynamite the power thereof so you can profess godliness and hold and maintain to i am a christian i believe this i believe the bible i believe jesus died for my sins i believe if i accept him as my savior i won't be lost but you deny any power of his grace to change your life to keep you from sinning every day not turn to not run toward but from such such what religion with no power brother brahman said it over and over again god hates a powerless religion that ain't just baptist methodist that's message if we turn into it that includes us just as well as everybody else god hates a powerless religion my don't you love the word tonight i mean like to be remembered in prayer god bless you let's uh bow our heads together heavenly father we're so grateful tonight for your precious word as we read it it stirs our hearts lord it it does so many things for us depending on what portion of the word that we're reading and looking at these portions that we've read tonight lord i believe for many of these people that are standing here it is not a description of who they are from their soul they're isaac if they've been born again and they have that isaac that promised seed in their soul they cannot be apostate and be that but yet because in time we're still held in these prisons our bodies can certainly get under these old anointings of the last day so father i pray that you would help us lord to realize that these things are written for our admonition they're written so that we would not be caught up in the spirit of the last days everybody on the earth is going to be under the spirit of the last days but we want to be under the spirit of god we want to be under a rapturing spirit not hatred variance and strife emulation and all these things that we've read about we pray that you'd be mindful lord of the sick those that are suffering lord god move among us tonight we pray with your great presence in the name of the lord jesus we ask it amen god bless you saints you may be seated i know in some ways when we read things like this it doesn't make us feel very good there's this negative side of prophecy that we look at and we think well you know that's not me and i hope and pray that there's not a person here tonight under the sound of my voice or any that's streaming this service that would fit into this category that paul so fluently described i hope that there's none of us here that will wind up in this category but i'm sure that all of us could say that in our life that we have in times past been under this influence because it is the spirit of the last days it's part of the portion of prophecy that is given to laodicea somebody's going to fulfill it but if i have a choice that ain't part of the word i'm going to fulfill i'm going to fulfill the other part but nevertheless i don't want to look at it with some mindset oh that's not me i don't have anything to worry about but as a mortal in time i have to watch the spirit of the last day i have to watch because my flesh as we're looking at on sunday morning my flesh is not saved and yours isn't either and it is not yet fully redeemed so i have to watch this o ishmael because he still wants to try to convince me that he's the promised son and he wants to convince me that i need to listen to him just like yours does but yet when i'm in perfect harmony with the seed life that's in my soul and i'm in fellowship with my father he constantly is suppressing this ishmael and sending him out from the presence of the promised son which is isaac but my ishmael needless to say he does not like that every day that he's out of the presence of abraham it is a day of humiliation and a day of embarrassment now listen as the prophet said this in 1953 in west palm beach florida the world's got to get like this god would be unjust to pour his wrath out upon a just people which shows us that the bride will only be allowed to remain on the earth earthen up to a certain time before it reaches the climax when god's wrath will reach to a certain level the bride must be raptured out or the justice of god would have crossed his own barrier of grace and god will only let the bride stay on the earth when the tribulation before the tribulation ever sets him and even before the wrath of god and the anger of satan reaches a certain climax it would be unjust of god to leave his sweetheart here on the earth one day pass when the wrath of god is being poured out notice this they've ignored him now these are the people that have turned him away they have ignored him and walked away and satan's captured them now whether we tonight or americans or canadians or africans or indonesians or indians or whatever more that we would be we cannot look around and see our fellow americans or the people in africa their fellow amer africans or the people in the continent of india or asia wherever more that they would be they could not look at their fellow brethren of their nation and see the people who have done this turn down the mercy of god and see them walk into the captivity of satan and their soul be sealed away and they're actually souls that are in prison now if they truly have the spirit of god you cannot see people who are in that state and not feel so sad for them in your heart because there's something within us that grieves us for our fellow americans here we are veterans day and i'd like to say to all the veterans in our church and all of those that will stream the service thank you for giving the years of your service that you would be able to risk your life so that we would be able to have this right tonight to me do we not thank them for many of them they got wounded maybe not physically but psychologically and whatever more and i appreciate each one of you that gave that service for us i'm sure it must break your heart as you see what you the price that you pay and see what our nation is leading into but from one american to another i thank you and i salute you tonight on the programs of one of those who's enjoying the benefits of what you did do we not saints as the children of god just as we salute our spiritual forefathers who pave the way for us now we how we thank god for men like brother branham but then we look back at brother branham would say he could not have brought what he brought had it not been for the people who run a precedent before him and we thank god for those people who the early pentecostal fathers had paved away that even forerunned brother rem they did not see of course what brother branham saw and even maybe for those who who was in the earlier days of the message and they you know many maybe some of your fathers and your grandparents and we could preach tonight the message of the hour and they would sit here maybe 50 years ago and they'd say what are they even talking about i never heard that when i was in the message well in their day they was talking about god sending the prophet and you know the prophet said this and the prophet said that boy thank god god sent a prophet and that's where they rallied around for years and years but what did they do if it had not been for them we would not be where we are tonight so they foreign us thank god they did is that right if there is another generation we are forerunning them i personally can't believe and see that there would be but each one foreruns the other and when we see that we cannot see our nation our brothers our people and see them how they're so caught up in the rottenness of laodicea and hurt our hearts as the prophets before us did notice this in question actually in 1954 we've got to get in the spirit of the last days when the last days are here you go to a dance hall and you've got to get in the spirit of dancing or they won't dance you go to the church and you've got to get in the spirit of worship how many knows there's the spirit of worship and you and i will try and try and try and sometimes the lord will let us try and put forth our effort and then he'll send the spirit of worship but you know if you worship very god god very long at all there is a difference in you doing it and him doing it through you now what happens is you give actually get under the spirit of worship and then he just takes all of your effort and he makes it so much easier but until he does we're going to do it whether we feel it or not right because that's what we're called to do so it'll be the same way with people who get out in the dance fire never got out the dance floor in my life only dancing i've ever done has been for the lord so i don't know how it is to go to a honky tonk or a bar room or nothing like that because i've never done it before but i imagine that there's people out there and they want ain't no dancing mood well they would call it a dancing mood but actually it's in the spirit of dancing but there'll be somebody out there and boy they'll jump about on the floor as i said i've never been in one of those places so i really don't know what it's like but they may get out there and they they bring that spirit then there'll be somebody else and they'll get out there and they'll go to dancing and then the spirit is getting stronger and stronger well don't you understand it's the same way in worship and what if 90 of you come in here you're dead as a hammer you said you're on wednesday night and you're tired and you wore out you don't feel like going to church you don't feel like worshiping you're aggravated and you're mad as an old hornet but you know what there might be one person that again here say praise god i come to have church i drove all the way from the mountains of virginia i put forth the effort so while i'm here i think i'll just worship god and maybe that one person will go to worship in god i'm crying a little bit and crying out well glory to god and that spirit to get on somebody else and somebody else and then somebody else before you know it it's turned that whole service around because somebody got under the spirit of worship well it's the same way with the last days now we've talked about the last days for many many years and there's a sequence of the last days that have actually been in the session since the lord jesus spoke his words of matthew 24. now when paul writes this here in second timothy chapter 3 verse 1. this was actually written around 66 a.d so already the last days had begun so the last days are the two last thousand year increments of time that will be lived out on the earth before the millennium so the last days began then but yet what what we know about prophecy is that god can allow prophets to utter certain words from god and part of them will go say to this dispensation and then part of them will be fulfilled over here part of them over here and the sequence of that fulfillment will keep unfolding until every word has come to pass so there was words of this no doubt that paul began to see jude of course wrote and said i thought it to brought to this unto you that you had earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints thirty years after pentecost and they were already getting cold they were feeling indifferent toward god toward the church they were substituting a new birth for shaking their hands and so on and so on so already the conditions of the last days had moved into the church but not in the face and not in the reputation and the multiplicity of how much it would be like it is in our day so we live in the day when not only are these every one of these descriptive terms of these 19 terms that paul used to describe the last day but it is so much greater than it ever was when paul is here do you believe that well you have to because it's greater than it was three or four years ago i may believe we were in the last days three years ago how many believe we were in the last days in 2019 but as 2020 felt more like the last day year than 2019 or 2018 or 2017. if there is a 2021 may god have mercy on us that's all i know if it's gonna be any worse in 2020 come and get us lord jesus that's right because you know as well as i know this year is a turning point and it's not just us that knows this i spoke one year just yesterday to a man that's doing some work for us over here in our building and this man was so tore to pieces tore all two pieces about the election and tore up about he said you can just feel it you can just feed it what's wrong what's wrong preacher he said things are just so all tore up i said well i agree with you they are but i said the lord has got these things under control and we've got to believe in him i know that i know that but i've never seen i'm so tore up i've never been torn up by an election and tore up by this i just had to stand right there in my heart and say thank you jesus thank you jesus that we've got a place i'm not saying that things don't bother us i'm not things saying that things don't trouble us but i'm saying is our god is bigger than politics our god is bigger than the democrat party or the republican party he's bigger than a voting machine he's bigger than the senate he's better than the congress well come on church he's bigger than who he's bigger than the world health organization and every other he's bigger than covid he's bigger than influenza our god is god and there ain't nothing going to destroy the council of god he will bring his word to pass so while they're getting the spirit of hatred and murder we ought to be getting in the spirit of the rapture amen notice this he says we're in the spirit of the last days in god's promise that these things would be here and that's what we've got we're in the last days and men and women are setting asleep and don't realize it now let's look at this prophecy and we'll take this verse by verse and word by word and let's break it down a little bit now as i said this is a prophetic insight not so much just a total anti-god move now remember that even as much as the left in america wants to actually take america away from her judeo-christian background and as much as if we listen to a bunch of these socialists in the white house and in the congress and so on they would want to take america away and many of them want you to believe that america will eventually get away from her religious right don't you never believe it don't you never believe that that is nothing but a scarecrow from the devil god symbolized her in the book of revelation under them two horns she will maintain her religious identity not truths i'm not talking about truth i'm talking about her religious identity right up to the very last phase of her helping israel and then if she turns on israel she will be destroyed but for them to want to project sure that's what they want to do but as the demons in world war ii wanted to destroy the earth and god sent an angel down and world war ii they still to this day don't know exactly how it all come about well i could let them in on something if the white house would like to know if they want to know all they got to do is call me and i'll tell them exactly what it was our father had a greater plan most of that well a lot of us hadn't even been born yet and we certainly hadn't been born again and them demons were so at one another the demons of america versus the demons of japan versus the demons of germany and the demons of the uk and them demons got in such an uproar like had never been before and god looked from heaven and said they're about to destroy the whole thing and god dispatched the mighty angel down and he went down and said let there be peace i want you to sound to our mistress it's time to bring world war ii 2 and then you imagine them devils were so mad and they were so angry and they went to report back to hell and satan said i want to know which one of you stop that war well it wasn't me the demon of germany said and the demon of america said it wasn't me and they said well we thought it must have been you he said it wasn't me i wanted all them people to kill one another so i could take them all to hell but if it wasn't you and it wasn't you who was it they might have heard a voice from heaven say it was me it was me oh hallelujah the same god that stopped that war is the very same god when all hell comes against you as an individual or against us as a church or against the bride around the world and all the demons say we've got her we've got her now we're going to get her oh no our god still has the power over war he still has the power over disease and sickness and trouble hallelujah and if he wants to stop it he can say stop stop and guess what it'll do stop and then demons will report down in hell again who was it to stop that attack against donny i've been working on this for years and we're going to well we thought you did well i didn't do it what was this your depression devil wasn't me was it you quitting devil he's just gonna quit wasn't me who was it that voice come back from heaven it was me it was me he's my boy he's my boy and i thought today was the day it's gonna change and i stopped [Applause] watch this paul says this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come so this is identified as one of the most prophetic things in the new testament concerning apostasy peter writes about it jude writes about it but not quite as eloquent in the way that paul does notice this in second thessalonians 2 3. second thessalonians was written around 54 a.d so here written before of course timothy here and paul had already begun to deal with some of these things let no man deceive you by any means for that day that day a prophetic time shall not come so this phase of prophecy had not already moved in the full cycle they were seeing deception they were saying all kinds of things but that day that day had not arrived it has now for that day oh my shall not come it's not here but it shall come except there come a falling away now look at this word falling what the greek word is apostasia and this is where we get the english word apostasy and it means to forsake a falling away a defection or an apostasy so it is not infidels it is not agnostics it is not people that are islamic it is not people that are hindu or any other heathen worship that we know about in the world today but it is actually people who have known an element of truth but they have apostasized now they have walked away apostasy is not a genuine sincere person believing wrong now listen to me and so you don't misunderstand what i'm fixing to say no doubt every one of us sitting here tonight believes things right now that are incorrect now you see the difference between an apostate and a genuine sincere person that's believing wrong out of hearsay or out of ignorance is that whenever a genuine sincere person sees that they are wrong and they're proved wrong by the word you know what they do they change their thinking about it they change their beliefs so if they they was taught there was three gods and you show them by the word that there's only one they change their belief but not an apostate person an apostate person will actually hold on to what they believe even after you prove them wrong why because their pride whatever more will not allow them to be corrected they will not bow to the god of truth because of humiliation embarrassment whatever the reason is so a person who's believing something wrong and maybe we're sitting here tonight and you believe this about election and you believe that about so and so and this weekend you'll hear me read a quote and it'll totally spin your whole world around you're saying oh my goodness lord i'm sorry i believe that wrong i am so sorry lord jesus brother john does that mean i'm apostate no it means that you're a real genuine believer but you believed it wrong because of tradition or because you was told somebody said so-and-so about so-and-so or somebody said brother brahm told them so and so about this and that and the other and once you actually see it in the word then you say lord i'm so sorry i repent of that let me know so i don't talk it up any all still have to do that oh my goodness well the rest of you holy angels i realize while y'all are still here it's me and the rest of these people that raised their hands i'll find out something just about weekly well come on i do you say brother donnie as old as you are yeah i'm as old as i am and i hope as long as i'm in my right mind i can still be talked because i found out that's one sign you got the holy ghost you've got a teachable spirit so no doubt we will go on this weekend next week and the week there after that we will find things about the word and we'll say you know what i didn't realize it but i i believe that wrong i've held on to that but this is not the falling away but a falling away then is people who have been told the truth but they refuse to measure up to that truth and they fall away from what they have heard and they begin to alter and they begin to reach a state of compromise now notice paul said that no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first first and that man of sin be revealed so falling away is an act of professed christians who deliberately reject revealed truths so you show them in the bible nobody in the bible was ever baptized in titles and you show them scriptures about one god and you showed them malachi 4 and so on and so on and so on you see god is the only one that knows when we are witnessing to people whether or not they actually see that now jesus told the people when he was here if you would blind if you were blind if ye were blind you would have no sin but because you say we see therefore your sin remains so it shows you an eye that many of those scribes pharisees have seen such a seed they actually saw who he was but they would not bow to it we know there's no man can do these things you do unless god be with him is that right so apostasy differs from error now listen apostasy is not the same thing as error errors i said can become because of traditional things or you just not been taught or even hear saying you base it on ignorance or hear say but apostasy is something that is totally different so now it's not that the people of god are free from error holding on to something that is wrong brother branham believes many things you do a study sometime and you get time if you don't take a lot of time and type in what he said i used to believe type it in quotation marks so you get all the quotes i used to believe that uh you know this that mary produced the egg and i used to believe that and i used to believe that and i had election wrong until an angel of god stood and corrected me so you know what i hear when i hear those things i hear a man that is able to acknowledge that he was believing with all of his heart sincerity but he was not an apostate you see this is why those who have left the message are trying to make brother branham they're trying to make him a false prophet they're trying to make him a liar they're trying to make him apostate don't you understand who that is that's the devil out of hell getting on them people to try to get you to doubt the message of your homeland you see this is who you are this is where you belong it's the very same thing they done to the children of israel when the spies were sent out and they went out and they come back and well you know here's all these grapes but my goodness we found all this and that and the other here was the amorites and the hittites and we saw the sons of anac there and we were in their side as well as our own side as grasshoppers and how in the world can we ever go out there what are they doing using these people that were a part of that move and trying to plant doubt and questions and all that in the minds of the people in the message but who were these people message followers at the time so then they started getting websites as we'd say today and they started writing books and they started interviewing this person and that person another person well i'll tell you one thing i wish some of them would be able to interview god that's the one i'm looking for to come up on youtube of those who have left the message i'm not just interested in this man and that man and that man and that man and many of them don't even know their own middle name they're so old well i don't remember what i don't remember i don't remember i'd like to see you all interview god and i'd like you to ask god god why did you vindicate this man around the world if this man was a liar and a deceiver and a false prophet god why did you give this man a ministry that surpassed anyone that had ever been on the earth well praise the lord him so much said it was the lord jesus using his body well come on saints that's who you ought to interview you got all kinds of questions don't come and ask me i'm just a little beyond i'm nobody i know nothing go to god's door and tell him you want an interview and you want some answers and you want some straight answers if this man was not a prophet of god then why did not god kill him when he made the challenge if i'm not a servant of god may god strike me dead on this platform why would god leave a liar and a deceiver and a hypocrite on the earth deceiving and leading away his innocent children to follow this so-called false prophet to hell come on somebody amen but you know what god would say if i could interview god tonight god would say donny i done spoke amen i done spoke i spoke to supernatural it was me calling their names it was me giving their address it was me telling them i see your doctor he's a heavyset man he's got on glasses he told you day before yesterday their sister so and so they're so and so they're so and so that was me donny and i just smile real big like a meeting sour grapes and say lord i knew that all the time thank you jesus i knew that already i just wanted to make sure lord this is why all of their questions don't move me you see when people have all kinds of questions i like to look at the heart that has the question because a lot of times questions are not from a sincere heart i'm reminded of a preacher one day that sat there and watched as a woman come in and poured out precious ointment on the feet of my lord and he sat there and the bible said that he had a question well come on somebody and he began to ask this question how come this was not sold for so much money and given to the poor you sorry rotten hypocrite you he wasn't concerned about the poor but the bible said he was a thief so what do we have we have a question not coming from the heart of a sincere person i don't know why i'm going this way but i'm going this way but we have a question coming from the heart of a thief he was not interested in truth he was interested in what he can get out of and i can tell you friends that for some of these who say oh bless god none of these message preachers will tangle with me they're bald-faced liars i've sent many of them all kinds of things in the scripture that looks like mistakes and error you know what they can't answer you they have to hang their face and say well thank you well thank you aha thank you you two-faced small-faced liar you hypocrite hell down gonna burn up in the lake of fire come on somebody but why because god vindicated this word and where is there going to be a great fall in a way right around the message of the hour right around the very last light of the gentiles oh brother donnie don't poor old brother down in me this is going to change poor old brother donnie [Applause] this is going to get us out of here brother wes [Applause] what's this the apostate is perfectly described in second timothy 4 3 for the time will come when they will not endure wow what a word to use for sound doctrine so sometimes you have to endure it sometimes it whoops up one side and whoops you down the other stomps on your toes it crumples up your knees man it runs in one ear and out the other it shears you like a sheep on the top palm down when you get done you feel like there ain't nothing left of you but there's something down inside of you you want to come back the next time the church doors is open why because you've got the ability to endure sound doctrine i don't want to just talk about sound doctrine i want to have something in me that can endure if the lord cuts me to pieces he cuts me up one side and down the other i want to try my best to wobble in church the next time and sit down on the pew and say hallelujah glory to god i may sit there like an old ragged scarecrow i might raise my hand and one arm fall off and raise the oven and my hand falls off but i'm going to do my best to let hell know whose side i'm on i want heaven to know whose side i'm on because according to the bible there is a book of remembrance that's been written down in heaven hallelujah i want the lord god to know i am identified soul spirit and body what the message of malachi 4. i ain't got no intention on going back i've got no desire to go back my boats are burned my bridges are destroyed hallelujah i don't want to go back i'll be only saying my future lays before me because my past has been erased now this is 66 a.d so by now already folks are getting tired of sound doctrine why don't you notice how paul frames this in the prophetic future for the time will come so paul knows the scope of this prophetic word was not for his day it had not yet arrived the fullness of this prophecy well the time will come when they they i'll tell you one thing i'm glad i ain't in this vague group [Music] you know hear people say well what they said they said i'll tell you one thing a lot of these days are going to hell and this day right here that they in a daily mess of trouble they that ain't me what about you what about you i ain't going to sing whenever i quote this question i ain't going to say i'm one of them i'm one of them that ain't me but the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers isn't it amazing they don't want just one so they got them on youtube they got books by them they got them on television so they they're just you know all these pictures all they are they're just another one on the heap it's a good place to get them burned you pile them all together in a big pile and the seventh vision will take care of them when this nation will be destroyed oh god help us notice this they shall heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables in reality the spiritual fables they turn to are worse than snow white and the seven dwarfs the worse than disneyland characters snow white wouldn't take you to hell but turning to these spiritual fables three gods what is that a fable out of hell won't disney never come up with that demons out of hell loosed out of the mouth of the false prophet and shall be turned unto fables you see apostates depart from the face but not actually from the outward profession of christianity as we read the scripture here in second timothy 3 5 having a form of godliness but denying the power of thereof so apostates will depart from the faith itself but not the form of religion you believe in hell i sure do you believe god so loved the world gave you some of god's absolutely my favorite scripture in the bible you believe in moses well i sure do jeremiah zekel zephana haga malachi zechariah absolutely matthew mark luke and john absolutely i can quote you matthew mark luke and john now what about malachi 4. oh you are them branhamas no i'm not i am a child of god i am a christian filled with a holy ghost i'm not known by the name of paul or peter or james or william branham or even donny reagan we're not reaganites here we're christians [Music] oh my well luke 17 30 revelation 10 1-7 all that oh oh oh oh you see apostate teachers as we look at it here again in second timothy 4 3 and 4. so they will turn away but watch now let's skip down here and look at jude just one chapter of course in verse 4 for there are certain men notice how they got in they crept two-legged serpents in the original serpent form upon two legs instead of licking dust they crept in but how do you think they crept in well in our ranks they crept in carrying a book or they crept in going into the library and getting some tapes or they crept in up here and said brothers i want to be baptized i want to be baptized i wonder how many slippery snakes we've dunked down in that water what they do they crept in in the form of religion well thank you jesus for there are certain men crept in unawares you talking about a contrast unawares to men but notice how he says this who were before of old ordained to this condemnation unawares to men does not mean they're unawares to god ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness in other words making the grace and the mercy of god a covering for crimes and sins and intimidating persuading and convincing men that they can sin because god understands and that's what the blood is for you sin and then god forgives you and then you sin again and god forgives you that's what the blood is for turning the grace of god into lasciviousness turning grace into disgrace friends if that don't describe most of the modern day tv preachers well come on now say amen oh yes you see it it projects to them the idea that they can sin safely they can do wrong safely that they have no fear in the sense if you do wrong you'll get punished no no no no no no these guys turned the grace of god into wantonness and lasciviousness and lust and they convinced them well you know if you sin you're safe you're protected because you're in christ jesus god can't get you god can't harm you now that's what the blood is for because you're going to sin true you're just going to go ahead and sin and you might just go ahead and enjoy it and then do it and then every day just ask god to forgive you because that's what the blood is for the blood is to release you of that desire to sin [Applause] the token life come back and come back in you and annihilates that sinful nature and you're never the same again now you're going to make mistakes that's right but you ain't going to do it from a serpent nature inside of your soul but you see these types of preachers and teachers are preaching to people who he'll still have the snake in their heart so the serpent is still treading in their soul and they are smoothing it down and convincing them they can sin safely you're okay you're all right that's why it doesn't matter what you look like how long have who ever heard a long hair in the bible anybody's read it very much as why who ever heard of what differences it make of a woman wears pants or or a pantsuit or whatever i think it's very fitting for a lot of these women are our supposed vice president think it's pretty fitting for her to have on a pant suit uh-huh come on now things it's pretty fitting because she's a dominating female well glory to god same way with hillary y'all ever seen hillary in her dress it'd be like putting a dress on a hog it'd be about the same way some of these women wearing a pants that they probably don't even own a dress because you know what they've got that man thing on them that perverted thing their spiritual perverts that's right oh hallelujah brother donald you're going to get in trouble what's new about that come on tell me something i don't know but what is it they turned the grace of god into lascivious convincing people you can sin safely and god will protect you he understands you you can't keep from it i agree i agree totally for people who aren't born again they can't keep from sinning is it just me or is it getting warm in here i'm sweating plum down to my socks man notice this verse 8 jude says likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise dominion so they hate men of god that are called to be set in the position that god calls him to be to have over the body so what do they do they despise them amen i wonder how many message folks will fit into this verse in the book of jude they despise dominion and speak evil of dignities those that are called by god and sent by god to lead the sheep and they despise their position and their rank and say you don't need a pastor the lord verse 11 he says woe unto them woe unto them they have gone in the way of cain what is the way of cain the selfish life filled with hatred and murder amen and the way of cain ran greedily after the error of balaam like balaam trying to make a gang of godliness and perish once you notice how jude wrote this brother west he writes it in such a way as if though these people now this ain't even come to pass yet fully but he writes it as if though they have already perished he writes and takes the form of the word and uses it in the past tense they're done annihilated because jude knows once they get to this there's no place to get back paris not will perish but perist and the gang saying of korah who thrust himself into the priesthood they intervene into the righteous holy offices of god which should not be entered into without a divine call how many businessmen around the message churches get up and accept the office of pastorship ain't a bit more a pastor than a groundhog in a hole they're a businessman and yet they control the church and they run the church and tell the come on now don't get quiet on me why that's what's projected from headquarters well come on saints don't get quiet if it was projected apostolic it would be what trying to encourage every man of god not to sit down on sunday morning and play a tape but to preach the word preach the word that's what brother branham did why because he said what paul said well hallelujah and somebody that don't say that is a liar and they're not saying what paul said [Applause] thank you jesus notice in verse 12 how he identifies these people these are spots in your feast of charity notice where they were they were not romans they were not pagan romans that were out there trying to kill the christians but they were actually among the message people in the first century they are spots in your feasts of charity when they feast with you so they were actually coming in now i've told you before that the rich people that had large houses they would actually have church in their houses and then after the service was over they would have a big meal because many christians were poor people so they would have their servants out there in the kitchens and then prepared their meal so they would have what they call love feast or charity feasts and they would come and they would meet together one day out of the week and they would gather together and they'd hear the preaching of the word and testimonies and songs and worship and then after the service was done they'd make a day out of it basically all the saints would stay together and eat and your jude says they're coming together with you they're sitting there feeding on the word and they're saying amen and then they go out there and eat whatever more that you've got out there and they're sitting right there with you acting like they believe every word that's being preached oh my notice how he says they do feeding themselves without fear my god clouds they are without water carried about of winds trees whose fruit withereth without fruit twice dead notice twice dead born dead in humanity now their soul has crossed eternal separation twice dead oh my goodness friends how you ought to thank god today for his truth and his grace to us brother donnie i'm not perfect i'm not blaming myself i make mistakes but the spirit of god deals with me you ought to be shouting all over this whole building tonight the spirit of god's dealing with you you ought to be so grateful that he is amen because people that are twice dead are beyond redemption twice dead plucked up by the roots raging waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wandering stars to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever remember when brother branham went there as a boy he said a burning hell would have been a pleasure can you imagine he was falling and falling and falling in the smoke and in the darkness and these beings were coming out haunting him can you imagine an individual saying that burning flames would have been a pleasure can you imagine every person that goes out that set here in our assembly that have become these apostates every sermon they heard me preach every sermon that had brother daryl preached ever quote they ever quoted you imagine as they're there for thousands of years or however long this will be the amplified part of their torment this same man they're now calling a false prophet it's like they will hear his voice over and over in hell in hell part of their torment they will recall setting in happy valley church clapping their hands singing worshiping seeing themselves worship don't you remember the rich man in luke when jesus gave the parable and he showed part of his torment with his human memory his human memory of life his human memory of what he could have done do you think it's just going to be oh oh worship in the drunk oh i wish i had done this part of their torment will be every tape they've ever heard part of their torment whatever man of god every alder called that was made and they sat there and held them to the back of the pew and refused it and the spirit of god dealt with their heart they will hear me preach through the ages oh god but for those of you who take what i preach what brother branham preached what with the daryl brother wes his other brothers here preach and eternity you won't hear me preaching every day i won't preach no more y'all happy about that me too me too eternal retirement praise be to god but can you imagine them people in the other realm they are hearing me over and over again how many of them i sit right there in that office and warn them don't do this don't do it i beg you in the name of jesus don't go that way don't do it over the dolly ain't going to ain't going to be right there knowing my heart to fix it dude and walk out the door and kill said do you think they believed you i said no they didn't believe me and you just remember from this day on they'll go down oh lord god children don't you see how much he loves us to give us grace and correct us when we're wrong and give us the spirit and say lord god i want to be wrong lord god i want to be right don't let me go in my ways god don't let me turn the grace of god the precious grace of god into lasciviousness and it become a license for people to sin and they can actually sin and feel safe in doing so because i preached false doctrine to them and convinced them thus lord god let's read this someone close verse 16 these are murmurers complainers walking after their own lust and their mouth speaking great swelling words having men's person in admiration because of advantage may god help us we'll have one thing in our hearts the lord jesus in his word stand with me and let me read this to you again in second timothy 3 1 when paul says this this no also on the last days perilous times shall come we'll pick it up again lord willing next week but the word translated perilous means violent fierce wild difficult grievous hard to bear distressing now believe it or not it's the exact same word that's used in matthew 8 28 when it describes the maniac of gabra so it's describing this maniac it's the same word perilous describing this man that was so demon possessed that he would cut himself so look what paul is saying in the last days that people will believe doctrines of demons so much it will become in the last days a demonic graveyard so people will run around in these doctrines of devils and you try to talk to them don't go that way don't go that way and they just smile at you and go right on and do what they're going to do just as in gadara friends we are rubbing shoulders with demon possessed people as it was in the time of the maniac from ghatera oh god help us how much longer lord how much longer we got to live here in these tombs now let's just say that they prove there was not enough tampering with the vote and all of that to change the election mr biden and miss harris get voted in and they get inaugurated and all this and that and the other what's going to happen to all the hatred that's been shown for the conservatives and for trump and his people wonder where all that hatred is going to go to because you know they're going to express it toward biden we don't see that they're not going to express it toward the left aoc can do whatever she wants to do and whatever say and everybody just thinks it's a-okay with aoc but it ain't okay with me i don't care if it is aoc praise the lord so where's that hatred gonna go you reckon don't you understand that something has happened in the last few years that people have been able through the the media through facebook through all these different things express hatred and express such things where is all this coming from the demons that was in gadara are here the violent protests that we're sending and burning businesses and all that what is it spirit of the last days you imagine how the people in the days of jesus must have become so overwhelmed that jesus would speak and in nazareth they would pick up rocks to stone him and they're looking over there and that's the quietest man you've ever seen in your life his temperament is so mild and meek and all of a sudden he's standing with a rock in his hand and over his old sister so-and-so why she ain't never been violent a day in her life but all of a sudden they're getting so violent they're getting so angry they're calling names they're just saying all this terrible terrible stuff you say what is it they were getting under the spirit of their last days but what did jesus tell his followers pray for them that despitefully use you when they cast your name out as evil rejoice why he didn't want his followers to get under that spirit whichever spirit you get under it's going to crown you you get under hatred oh that hurt my friend and said well the bible tells us what to do pray for them turn the other cheek oh it's easy for you to say you don't have a clue do you you do not have a clue what i go through no you don't the deacons don't the trustees don't my wife don't if god did not help me i would be the most violent man you've ever met in your life i would have so much hatred in me tonight it would spill out of me but it came i've got the holy ghost when message preachers will lie on you when message preachers that you all listen to have lied on me and said things against me oh i could tell you i could call names i and what good was that do then i lower myself to their level but i refuse to hate i know not one individual in this world that i hate not one that i want to say go to hell well praise the lord why i want to be like jesus now a lot of our preachers want to be like jesus and healing the sick and raise them dead and casting out devils and sin visions that's fine that's well and good too but i'm going to turn the other cheek like jesus i want to pray for them that despitefully use me like jesus anybody in here want to be like jesus well this is part of the spirit of the last days what is it satan's personifying himself so much in his church hell is embodying itself as it presses its gates into humanity and when all hell turns loose all heaven comes down praise god so which spirit are you finding yourself yielding to getting even with so and so they run me down i'll tell you one thing i'll get them back if it's the last thing i do that's not the spirit of god friends love does not keep a record it does not keep her i'll get them back you need to repent of that that is not the spirit of god forgive them oh they haven't asked me oh really so where did the roman soldiers ask the lord jesus to forgive him for crucifying him answer me they did not but from his person he said father forgive them for they don't know what they do come on happy valley church how many wants to walk this walk carry this cross be like jesus this way amen don't you love him with all your heart oh my this is the spirit that is expecting his bride to become in so much that his own life will be manifested among her and his word will be made flesh in her when her very flesh is going to become the word think of it the word was made flesh and dwelt among us there's another promise that's got to connect with john 1 14 when the word is becoming flesh and flesh is becoming word you say what are you talking about i'm talking about the resurrection and the rapture to where our flesh one day will become spoken word of god [Music] thank you lord jesus but you see what precedes that the word must be made flesh in us in the work of incarnation that started 2 000 years ago don't think it stopped with mary she was the beginning we're the culmination of that great immaculate thing and when it becomes the word becomes flesh and a bride around the world and the fullness of the godhead body is represented to the bride and the moment of the old glory to god in the moment the consummation of it reaches and the trump of god sounds our flesh will change you may be standing there combing your hair brushing your teeth and our flesh will change and become the word don't tell me you're not familiar with that quote invisible union when flesh is becoming the word don't you understand this is what it is in you crying you're crying for perfection and you're living an imperfect body this is what you're crying for when your flesh will become the word amen praise god oh thank you lord jesus oh heavenly father lord god i pray you would help us tonight lord jesus forgive lord if there's anything tonight that we're holding on to that's wrong lord if there's any saying any error and our walk and our belief system and our doctrine correct us by your word lord but father if there's error in our spirit error in our attitude we want that taken away just like false doctrine lord we don't want to blame our ishmael and say well god made me this way oh how we have to watch that thing this is the agenda that many of the homosexuals say well god made me this way so how can god judge me if he made me this way father we do not want to take our weaknesses of our flesh and our old carnal thing that we inherited from our families and say well god made me this way well if god is perfectly happy and accepted with the way we are with our tempers and this and that and the other then preachers are wasting their time preaching against it if you made us the way we are and you want to leave us with our tempers and our upsetness and this and that then why in the world are you making me and the rest these preachers preach against it help us to understand lord much of what we are is not what you made us your prophet told us we become the nature of one behind us i inherited reagan traits i inherited show traits i inherited guffy traits way behind me many of them things are not made by you they are ungodly they are unruly and it takes the preaching of the word and me applying it to my life to help bring that old thing subject or i can hide behind the excuse well god made me this way lord god you never made me to be mean you never made me to be ill-tempered you never made me oh god to be anything contrary to your word so where does it come from my mama my daddy my uncles my grandparents oh jesus help us to be changed lord give us a desire father amen how many in this place should raise your hand to god tonight and say lord make me like you father remember friends we're not talking about perfecting our human flesh but we're talking about making it subject that part about your human makeup that is wrong don't you think for one minute that almighty god made you that way is going to leave you that way how could god make you with a temper strong enough to fight a buzzsaw and then convict you for displaying what he made you to have how could god make you men to be full of lust and then you lust after women and then god convict you for lusting come on somebody wake up let's face the facts and god never made much of what we are the way we are we inherited it out of the grab bag of humanity [Music] but satan will do his best to try to convince you your ishmael that's what many of you are still thinking this is why you hide behind well god made me this way i don't have to change this is the way i am god made me loud mouth god made me don't you blame that stuff on god well praise the lord god wants us to change to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren praise be to god i give myself away [Applause] [Music] i give myself away so you can use me i give myself away i give myself away so you can use me here i am to see hit me i give myself away so you can't use me i give myself away i give myself away so you can use me take my heart my life as a living sacrifice all my dreams all my plans lord i place them in your words [Music] i give myself away i give myself away so you can't use me [Music] i give myself [Music] i give myself to you i give myself away so i give myself away as a living sacrifice all my dreams all my plans lord i play i give myself away oh i give myself i give myself away so you can't use me your desires revealed in me i give myself away i give myself away so you can use me i give myself away [Music] oh my life is not my own oh i give myself to you i give myself away i give myself
