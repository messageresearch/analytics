[31:26] Jesus for
[32:21] on a
[32:23] bony of space
[32:27] stepped a
[32:30] pure and holy
[32:35] God and in
[32:39] awesome
[32:41] Solitude he
[32:43] stood
[32:49] alone not one faint
[32:52] star to give him
[32:56] light just just endless
[33:00] rolling Blackest
[33:05] Night but
[33:08] somehow through all the

[33:18] see he saw
[33:21] mountains high and
[33:25] lofty he saw
[33:28] Val is Lush and
[33:33] green babbling
[33:35] Brooks and
[33:37] while flowers
[33:40] growing even
[33:43] her a robin

[34:48] white
[34:52] within but he
[34:54] saw me Bound in heavy
[34:59] chains and
[35:02] long to set me
[35:06] free but he
[35:08] knew if
[35:11] I
[35:13] became like
[35:16] him
[35:18] he
[35:20] must become
[35:24] like me
[35:26] [Music]
[35:30] so
[35:33] Jesus Paid It
[35:36] [Laughter]
[35:38] all
[35:40] all to him I
[35:45] ow
[35:47] sin had left a
[35:50] cron
[35:53] stain but he was
[35:58] it
[36:00] wide as
[36:03] [Music]
[36:05] snow oh
[36:08] Jesus Paid It
[36:12] all
[36:14] all to him I
[36:18] ow
[36:20] sin had left a crms sun
[36:26] stain but
[36:28] he
[36:30] was it
[36:33] wi as
[36:40] snow thank you
[36:50] Lord praise the Lord praise the
[36:54] Lord I'm so glad that
[36:58] he paid the
[37:00] debt that I couldn't
[37:03] pay I owed
[37:06] it I was
[37:08] guilty but he took my
[37:11] place standing there that day before
[37:15] Pilate pilate said which shall I release
[37:19] unto you Jesus which is called the
[37:22] Christ or Jesus
[37:24] barabus which shall I release unto you
[37:28] and no doubt Jesus said father let him
[37:31] have
[37:33] barabus because he knew that the only
[37:35] way barabus could ever become him he
[37:38] would have to become
[37:40] barabus the only way that we could ever
[37:43] be like him he had to become one of us
[37:47] and bore our sins aren't you grateful
[37:49] for
[37:49] that yes I'm so happy tonight to
[37:54] know what he's done for us am may the
[37:58] Lord bless you richly if you count of an
[38:01] honor to be with you and to be home and
[38:02] once again we want to say we thank you
[38:04] for all the kindness you showed my
[38:06] family during the loss of my my sister
[38:09] Judy and we certainly appreciate that
[38:12] it's not forgotten even many years ago
[38:15] when the accident of Homer and Rachel
[38:18] and Jessica being hurt so bad and we
[38:20] have never forgot all the kindness and
[38:23] all that you've done for us then and
[38:25] it's just as brother David preached the
[38:28] other night we just need each other so
[38:30] much and I you know we're I'm convinced
[38:33] God created the body that way so that we
[38:35] would depend on one another so thank you
[38:37] so much and we appreciate the
[38:39] opportunity to speak to you this evening
[38:41] if you have your Bibles turn with us to
[38:42] the Book of
[38:43] Revelations want to read from
[38:45] Revelations 3: 20 just this one verse we
[38:49] trust that what we have to say tonight
[38:50] will be a blessing to you it's kind of
[38:51] short knowing it's communion night and
[38:53] so we won't be long at all but yet we
[38:56] want to take our time time too but we
[38:58] just pray the Lord will just speak to
[38:59] our hearts and uh that the things that
[39:02] we say would be more than just words but
[39:04] it would be reality in the heart of
[39:05] every believer
[39:09] amen praise the Lord do you love him
[39:14] yeah Revelations
[39:16] 3:20 the Bible says
[39:19] this behold I stand at the door and

[39:28] open the door I will come into him and
[39:32] will suck with him I will come into him
[39:36] and Su with him and he with me now that
[39:41] Su is actually supper we know that and
[39:43] supper is a light meal served late in
[39:46] the evening supper is always an evening
[39:50] meal and notice he didn't say I'll be
[39:52] knocking at the door at breakfast time
[39:54] or at lunchtime but at supper time
[39:58] at supper time let us bow our heads I
[40:01] want to speak to you this even for just
[40:02] a few minutes on a true
[40:10] communion Heavenly

[40:19] hearts that we can call you

[40:26] what you have done for for us in this
[40:29] hour for Lord truly in this time of
[40:32] great Darkness you have shown your light
[40:35] Lord to lead

[40:39] grateful and father we are so thankful
[40:41] tonight for all that you've given us in
[40:44] this hour for you have not left us
[40:47] comfortless for you said you would be
[40:49] with us that you would never leave us
[40:51] nor would you forsake us then Lord we
[40:55] come to realize that no matter what we
[40:56] face in life we do not have to face it
[41:00] alone and for this we are grateful Lord
[41:04] we pray that this evening in this
[41:06] communion service may it be a time of
[41:09] reconsecration a time of rededication
[41:12] may it be a time of Revelation Lord that
[41:15] we could see oursel more clearer through
[41:17] the image the mirror of your word Lord
[41:20] and father God May these things as I
[41:22] said not just be words but may they drop
[41:25] into our hearts Lord and produce Dear
[41:27] God that which you send it to do for
[41:29] it's the evening time and the
[41:31] manifestation of the sons of God and
[41:34] Lord It's the revelation of who we are
[41:36] and what it is you wanted to accomplish
[41:38] and Lord I pray in the communion service
[41:40] we know it's a time of healing father I
[41:43] ask in the name of Jesus that everyone
[41:45] that partakes of this communion tonight
[41:47] may they be healed Lord and those that
[41:49] are unable to come because of the
[41:51] viruses and different things that are
[41:52] going around I pray in the name of Jesus
[41:55] May the Holy Spirit go to them tonight
[41:57] Lord and deliver them for thou art the
[41:59] Creator and sustainer of our lives and
[42:02] Lord we believe you are our healer and
[42:05] we look to you bless your children
[42:07] tonight father receive honor and Glory
[42:09] unto thyself for we ask these things in
[42:11] jesus' name and the bride says amen amen
[42:14] God bless you you may be
[42:16] seated now this scripture that we just
[42:19] read here in
[42:20] Revelations it's the words of Christ
[42:23] himself after his resurrection and he
[42:26] speaking to the last Church age he is
[42:30] speaking to the last Church age so
[42:33] that's telling us that he's actually
[42:34] speaking to us he's speaking to us in
[42:38] this hour so we know that no matter what
[42:40] man has tried to do they have not been
[42:42] able to silence the voice of God they
[42:45] can explain him way scientifically him
[42:48] way but they can never stop that voice
[42:51] amen so after his resurrection now he's
[42:54] speaking to the last Church age now we
[42:56] know there are seven Church ages and at
[43:00] the first church age Jesus was walking
[43:03] among the seven golden candlesticks so
[43:06] we find in the first church ages he's
[43:08] walking among the
[43:10] candlesticks but this church age in this
[43:12] leosa age which is the last Church age
[43:15] he's on the outside trying to get in to
[43:18] his own church and what does it show us
[43:21] it shows us what this age has done this
[43:24] nation this world has become almost to
[43:27] totally a Godless Nation a Godless world
[43:30] but notice in this last age he doesn't
[43:33] come in the morning he doesn't come in
[43:34] the noon time but he comes at supper
[43:36] time he comes in the evening time it's
[43:40] in the evening time that he begins to
[43:43] manifest himself to get back into his
[43:46] church he doesn't want to get back into
[43:48] an organization he doesn't want to get
[43:50] back into a Creed he doesn't want to get
[43:52] back into some man's ideal he doesn't
[43:54] want to get back into some man that
[43:55] wears a a dress come on somebody but
[43:58] what does he wanting to do he's wanting
[44:00] to get back not just into a church not
[44:03] just into a church but he wants to get
[44:05] into his own
[44:07] church oh that's a big difference amen
[44:10] there's churches churches Brides
[44:12] churches Brides but there's got to come
[44:14] one amen and that's the one that he's
[44:16] interested in tonight he wants to get
[44:19] back in his own church amen now tonight
[44:21] we have set aside this service for a
[44:24] communion service now Union as we all
[44:27] know is where we partake of the bread
[44:30] and of the wine and foot washing it's a
[44:34] time that we examine ourselves it's a
[44:37] time that of reconsecration and looking
[44:39] at our lives now we do this because
[44:42] Jesus commanded that we should do this
[44:45] in remembrance of
[44:49] him that's that's right I know it's
[44:52] Saturday but we can Amen on Saturday too
[44:53] it's all right amen now we realize that
[44:56] this bread is not the literal body as
[45:00] some
[45:02] teach but it is a symbolic it represents
[45:06] his body and the wine is not his literal
[45:09] blood but it's symbolic of his blood
[45:12] that he shed for us and in a little
[45:15] while when we partake of this bread and
[45:17] this wine you will become one with
[45:20] it because you will consume it as you
[45:23] take it into your mouth and consume it
[45:25] and swallow it there you and this bread
[45:27] you and this wine will become
[45:31] one and we call this communion but for a
[45:36] few minutes this evening I want to speak
[45:38] to you on not just communion but on a
[45:41] true
[45:43] communion to remind you amen we do this
[45:46] to remind you that that what we do in
[45:49] symbolic form what we do tonight in
[45:52] symbolic form is what God wants to do in
[45:55] reality in each of of Our Lives God just
[45:59] doesn't want us to consume bread and
[46:01] consume wine but he wants to get into us
[46:04] tonight amen he wants to do it in each
[46:07] of Our Lives brother R said that Jacob
[46:09] wrestled all night and he wouldn't turn
[46:11] him loose until he blessed him that's
[46:13] right he battled for life and after the
[46:16] battle is over then God gives you of
[46:19] himself and that is true communion true
[46:23] communion that little bread and that
[46:25] little wafer it just represents it but
[46:28] God gives you of himself and that is
[46:31] true communion God gives you of himself
[46:35] and that is true communion the bread and
[46:38] the wine it just represents that but
[46:40] what God actually wants to give us is
[46:45] himself is himself that's true communion
[46:49] now go with me for a few minutes let's
[46:52] go back in time before there was even
[46:55] time before there was the world before
[46:58] there was a universe before there was a
[47:00] moon but before there were stars there
[47:03] was this being the self-existing one we
[47:08] know him as God but he really wasn't God
[47:10] yet because God is an object of worship
[47:14] and there was nothing to worship him he
[47:16] was God but he wasn't God in that manner
[47:20] as we know that and God had all these
[47:23] attributes that he wanted to express he
[47:27] desired to express them he wanted to
[47:29] express himself as a Healer he wanted to
[47:32] express himself as a savior he wanted to
[47:34] express himself as a redeemer as a
[47:37] father as a husband as a son he wanted
[47:40] to express himself in a body of
[47:43] Believers called his
[47:46] church let me say that again he just
[47:49] didn't want desire to express himself as
[47:51] a Healer but he actually desired to
[47:53] express himself in a body of people
[47:56] called called the church or the bride if
[47:59] you will now the Bible says in 2
[48:02] Corinthians 6:16 and what agreement with
[48:05] we with with what agreement have the
[48:07] temple of God with Idols what agreement
[48:11] does the temple of God have with Idols
[48:14] for you are the Temple of the Living
[48:19] God that's what the Bible says well I
[48:22] don't feel like it he didn't say if you
[48:23] failed it he said did you believe it
[48:26] [Music]
[48:28] what do we have to do with Idols what
[48:29] does the temple of God have to do with
[48:31] Idols ye are the Temple of the Living
[48:35] God as God has said I will dwell in them
[48:39] and I will walk in them and I will be
[48:41] their God and they shall be my
[48:45] people
[48:47] hallelujah hallelujah notice God's
[48:50] desire is not just to be above his
[48:53] people not just to be with his people
[48:56] but his desire is to be in his
[49:02] people amen for he said I will dwell not
[49:05] with them he didn't say I will dwell
[49:08] with them but he said I will dwell in
[49:11] them am he didn't say he'd walk with
[49:14] them but he said he would walk in
[49:19] [Music]
[49:20] them makes you kind of wonder what
[49:22] Enoch's walk really was
[49:27] well
[49:28] Glory I will walk not with them but in
[49:32] them you know brother bosw asked brother
[49:34] B said you know brother B do you know
[49:36] what Fellowship is he said oh I think so
[49:38] brother Bosworth what is fellowship he
[49:40] said fellowships is to fellows in one
[49:45] ship now to Fellowship means commune for
[49:49] commune and fellowship is actually an
[49:51] interchangeable
[49:53] word Two Fellas in one ship
[49:57] Two Fellas in one ship not Two Fellas in
[50:00] two ships in one sea but Two Fellas in
[50:03] one ship God the Creator living and
[50:07] walking in his
[50:12] creation Oh Glory to God I hope we can
[50:14] catch that tonight to see who we are in
[50:17] according to his word not what the world
[50:20] says we are not what we think about
[50:22] ourselves but what God thinks about us
[50:25] it's time we start saying what the word
[50:28] says amen we need to get away from this
[50:30] negative stuff well come on somebody

[50:44] desire this is what God desired this is
[50:47] what God wanted to
[50:50] achieve Hallelujah he can create planets
[50:53] but what goods a planet without somebody
[50:55] own it this is what God desired God the
[50:58] Creator living and walking in his
[51:00] creation amen you see when you're born a
[51:03] new by the Holy Spirit he can only look
[51:06] upon you as

[51:31] workmanship and in case you don't know
[51:33] it God Don't Make No
[51:39] Junk the bride is perfect because she's
[51:42] created by a perfect God
[51:45] Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah he did it
[51:48] himself you are his workmanship because
[51:52] God by his Mercy brought you into Christ
[51:54] and to fellowship and to look upon as a
[51:57] perfect work of his own I brought him he
[51:59] said I presented him to the blood and
[52:01] there's nothing wrong with my work he
[52:03] said you are God's
[52:08] workmanship amen you are God's
[52:11] workmanship and all of God's works is
[52:17] perfect what did he say when he created

[52:53] ability I'm not trusting in my education

[52:59] of the Lamb of God Amen that speaks for
[53:02] me when I cannot speak for myself he

[1:00:15] to do something good for you that's
[1:00:18] God's
[1:00:21] desire told the story of the Old
[1:00:24] Violin you don't heard the story St I
[1:00:26] know but to me it's more than just a
[1:00:29] story to fill up space on the tape to me
[1:00:32] he's trying to relay something to us
[1:00:34] something he wants us to
[1:00:36] understand and he tells the story of the
[1:00:39] old vience said there was an auction one
[1:00:41] time and they got up this old fill on
[1:00:42] old valin and the auctioner said what am
[1:00:44] I offered for it who'll give me a
[1:00:49] price it didn't look like much the
[1:00:51] prophet said a little crummy Dusty
[1:00:54] perhaps had a few scars on
[1:00:57] Out Of
[1:00:58] Tune kind of sounds like I was when he
[1:01:00] found
[1:01:03] me and he couldn't even get a bid on it
[1:01:06] finally I think he said he might have
[1:01:08] got a bid of a dollar or something
[1:01:09] nobody wanted it it was worthless they
[1:01:12] made fun of it they laughed at it get it
[1:01:14] off the block we don't want that up here
[1:01:17] nobody wants
[1:01:19] that and there was one standing there
[1:01:21] that didn't think it ought to sell for
[1:01:23] that so he went and picked it up all
[1:01:26] right he picked up the violin he struck
[1:01:28] it in his hands and he picked up the bow
[1:01:30] and he rosined it and he be to play a
[1:01:32] tune let's say he played What a Mighty
[1:01:35] God Jesus is or perhaps there's a
[1:01:39] fountain filled with blood and when he
[1:01:41] begin to play everyone started crying
[1:01:44] they had never heard such music in their
[1:01:47] life and the auctioner caught the moment
[1:01:49] and he said now what am I offered 2,000
[1:01:52] 5,000 10,000
[1:01:56] what they thought was
[1:01:58] worthless what they thought was
[1:02:00] worthless all of a sudden became
[1:02:05] Priceless and what the world laughs at
[1:02:07] and calls a cult a skirt Church trash on
[1:02:11] the internet they trash it on the
[1:02:13] internet they do not see the value of it
[1:02:16] but God
[1:02:17] says it's
[1:02:21] Priceless that's my
[1:02:23] workmanship Hallelujah
[1:02:26] amen amenu what was it the Master's Hand
[1:02:30] revealed what was veiled in the old
[1:02:32] instrument what was the difference the
[1:02:35] master of the Prophet said the one who
[1:02:36] knew it the one who built it he knew how
[1:02:40] to get out of it what was in
[1:02:45] it the violin was only the expression of
[1:02:48] the master who built it he had within
[1:02:51] himself all this music this certain
[1:02:53] sound the guitar couldn't make it the
[1:02:55] the drums couldn't make it it was a
[1:02:57] certain sound so he created a special
[1:03:00] instrument yeah that he could reflect
[1:03:03] that sound through amen he created an
[1:03:06] instrument he could express through that
[1:03:09] instrument what was in
[1:03:12] him he designed the violin he knew the
[1:03:15] sounds that he wanted it to make and
[1:03:17] when he picked it up and struck the bow
[1:03:19] across the strings the violin became the
[1:03:22] very inspiration of the master you see
[1:03:25] the music wasn't in the
[1:03:28] violin on the music was in the master
[1:03:31] the violin only expressed
[1:03:40] it you see the very heart the very
[1:03:44] Passion of the violinist was expressed
[1:03:47] through that violin he built that violin
[1:03:49] to be an instrument that he could
[1:03:51] express himself through and the violin
[1:03:55] of and the violin became one they were
[1:03:59] in true
[1:04:00] communion one with the other
[1:04:09] am I like
[1:04:11] that oh God Church can't you see tonight
[1:04:15] can't you see tonight that
[1:04:17] violin was you
[1:04:23] yes he just want to express himself
[1:04:25] through a pastor he just didn't want to
[1:04:26] express himself through a through a
[1:04:28] prophet he just didn't want to express
[1:04:29] himself through Christ but he chose to
[1:04:31] express himself through his bride
[1:04:36] amen he's come the evening time to
[1:04:39] gather you in him that he may Express
[1:04:41] himself the final voice to the final age
[1:04:45] God speaking through his
[1:04:47] bride like the violin when Jesus came on
[1:04:50] the earth he had no beauty that we
[1:04:53] should desire him but he was the
[1:04:54] instrument the means the body that God
[1:04:57] would Express the fullness of himself
[1:04:59] through Christ was the very Heart Of God
[1:05:03] expressed on the earth and Jesus said I
[1:05:06] and my father are one my father dwelleth
[1:05:10] in
[1:05:11] me you don't need know how much pler can
[1:05:14] that
[1:05:15] be I my father are one my father dwells
[1:05:19] in
[1:05:20] me amen where's your father I just told
[1:05:23] you
[1:05:27] I a father one my father dwelleth in me
[1:05:30] you can't read that any planer they said
[1:05:32] why don't you show us the father and
[1:05:35] it'll satisfy us and what did he say
[1:05:38] have I been with you so long and you
[1:05:41] don't know me when you see me you
[1:05:45] see my
[1:05:48] father
[1:05:50] true
[1:05:53] communion that's good true
[1:05:57] communion Amen brother Bram said a lady
[1:06:00] once jumped up and said why brother
[1:06:02] Brenham she said the father and the son
[1:06:03] are one just like you and your wife are
[1:06:06] one I said oh no they're not I said do
[1:06:09] you see me she said yes I said do you
[1:06:11] see my wife she said no I said then this
[1:06:14] is not the same kind of one Jesus said
[1:06:16] when you see me you've seen the Father
[1:06:18] the father dwelleth in me my wife don't
[1:06:20] dwell in me see they are one in every
[1:06:22] way they are one and we're one through
[1:06:24] agreement wife and I we're one in
[1:06:25] Fellowship but we're two personalities
[1:06:28] my wife can do one kind of thinking and
[1:06:30] me
[1:06:31] another and we're two persons but not so
[1:06:35] with God God in Christ is the selfs same
[1:06:42] person and when do we come to the
[1:06:44] realization that we can tell this world
[1:06:47] who wants to know where God is say when
[1:06:49] you see me you see my
[1:06:53] father for I am my father all right are
[1:06:59] one Jesus was God manifested In the
[1:07:01] Flesh the Bible said that God was in
[1:07:04] Christ reconciling the world to himself
[1:07:07] the flesh part was man the spirit was
[1:07:09] God Jesus said I can do
[1:07:11] nothing except my father shows me first
[1:07:15] what is that true
[1:07:17] communion God and man one so would he
[1:07:21] doesn't even think his own thoughts
[1:07:24] [Music]
[1:07:27] let this mind be in let this mind be in
[1:07:29] you that's also in
[1:07:31] Christ who thought it not robbery to be
[1:07:33] equal with God he said let this mind be
[1:07:36] in you brother darl the world's lost his
[1:07:38] mind he wants you to lose your mind not
[1:07:40] to the world but to his
[1:07:46] word Jesus said I come to do my father's
[1:07:49] will In The Garden of Gethsemane he
[1:07:50] cried out not my will let thy will be
[1:07:54] done you see like the violin had no
[1:07:57] ability on its own no desire on its own
[1:07:59] had no thought on its own it was just an
[1:08:02] instrument and Jesus said I do nothing
[1:08:04] but that which I see my father do and
[1:08:07] all my father does I do
[1:08:10] likewise because we're
[1:08:16] one God don't tell me to do something
[1:08:19] and we have a
[1:08:20] debate he says that I do it
[1:08:26] the violin is the same way it has no
[1:08:28] ability on its
[1:08:30] own I've got a key that opens every door
[1:08:33] in this church but what good is a key
[1:08:37] without a
[1:08:39] hand it's just a key
[1:08:45] right that's the way the volum was it
[1:08:47] had no ability on its own it had no
[1:08:49] desire on its own it had no thought it
[1:08:50] was just an instrument but when the
[1:08:52] master picked it up the very life of the
[1:08:55] master was expressed through the violin
[1:08:57] and that's what he wants to do with
[1:09:00] you you take this microphone right here
[1:09:03] it's an absolute perfect total
[1:09:07] mute these speakers they are mute
[1:09:11] they're just speakers without a voice
[1:09:14] behind them they're just
[1:09:18] silent the means is there the ability is
[1:09:21] there but it takes a
[1:09:24] life
[1:09:28] amen
[1:09:31] hallelujah that's what he wants us to do
[1:09:34] take the microphone take these speakers
[1:09:36] they're mute they can't speak at all
[1:09:38] there's the organ all that beautiful
[1:09:41] music but tell it to play
[1:09:44] chainbreaker go ahead organ play
[1:09:46] chainbreaker you got the strings they're
[1:09:48] in tune you got the
[1:09:51] power there's no life behind it
[1:10:00] there has to be a life behind it you
[1:10:02] know they talk about brother this piano
[1:10:04] brother Larry can make that piano talk
[1:10:06] but it can't talk without somebody
[1:10:08] playing
[1:10:09] it do you hear what I'm telling you man
[1:10:12] is just an instrument he's just clay but
[1:10:14] if Jesus can take that person in full
[1:10:18] control he can preach through him heal
[1:10:20] the sick through him cast out Devils
[1:10:22] through him see Visions through him
[1:10:24] speak in tongues through
[1:10:27] him if that person can be like that
[1:10:30] violin just totally surrendered into the
[1:10:32] hand of the master and become one with
[1:10:36] the
[1:10:39] master god was in Christ true communion
[1:10:42] now God is in his church in a true
[1:10:44] communion making him the same yesterday
[1:10:46] today and forever he Sanctified with his
[1:10:49] spirit and blood a church that he make
[1:10:51] every promise in the last day be
[1:10:53] revealed that he could go back and pick
[1:10:54] up what the other fellas had left off
[1:10:56] here in the last days and by his holy
[1:10:58] spirit reveal all the mysteries of the
[1:11:00] Seven Seals he expressed himself that is
[1:11:03] his purpose that's why he died that's
[1:11:06] the second fold of his three-fold
[1:11:08] manifestation first to express himself
[1:11:10] in Christ then Express himself through
[1:11:14] the
[1:11:16] church not just in Christ but through
[1:11:19] the church and the same thing Christ was
[1:11:22] the word and the church becomes the word
[1:11:24] when lets the word go through them yes

[1:23:36] with reverence and respect of the last
[1:23:37] couple of minutes that's floating by
[1:23:39] look to what God to my opinion will do
[1:23:41] and must do and will do in this last day
[1:23:43] is to find a tool for the Harvest he's
[1:23:46] got to find a tool to thrash the floor
[1:23:48] any fer when he goes to Harvest he has
[1:23:50] to have a tool to do it with certainly
[1:23:51] he's got to have a sharp sickle or
[1:23:53] something some instrument to thrash out
[1:23:55] the Grain and the Harvest is
[1:23:58] ripe God take us in your
[1:24:01] hands make us bonder Servants of Your
[1:24:03] Love use us for tools to bring the
[1:24:06] realization to the sinful sin cursed
[1:24:09] Earth that we're living in today that
[1:24:13] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:24:15] and forever amen may they not just see
[1:24:18] it on the sign maybe they not just see
[1:24:19] it on a t-shirt may they not just see it

[1:34:54] verse
[1:34:56] 23 that's certainly what we desire isn't
[1:34:59] it not just to partake of the symbols
[1:35:03] tonight but to partake of him that's the
[1:35:06] great
[1:35:07] gift for I have received of the Lord
[1:35:10] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:35:13] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:35:16] which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:35:20] when he had given thanks
[1:35:24] he break it and said take eat this is my
[1:35:28] body which is
[1:35:30] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[1:35:35] me after the same manner also he took
[1:35:39] the cup when he had SED remember the
[1:35:42] word come and SEP with me I'll SEP with
[1:35:46] you and you with me he's demonstrating
[1:35:49] this so he takes the cup and when he had
[1:35:52] sued saying
[1:35:54] this cup is the New Testament in my
[1:35:57] blood this do ye as often as you drink
[1:36:01] it in remembrance of me for as often as
[1:36:04] you eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:36:08] you do sh the Lord's deaths till he come
[1:36:12] notice why we do it now wherefore
[1:36:14] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:36:17] this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[1:36:20] guilty of the body and the blood of the
[1:36:23] Lord
[1:36:24] and there's a lot of folks that won't
[1:36:25] come to communion they won't participate
[1:36:28] in communion and yet they believe the
[1:36:30] Lord's coming every day and they think
[1:36:32] they're ready to leave that day doesn't
[1:36:34] make any sense to me people let the
[1:36:37] devil Rob them from such a great
[1:36:40] blessing this gives us but Brother Don
[1:36:43] I'm not perfect you're not looking at a
[1:36:45] perfect preacher a perfect preacher
[1:36:47] didn't preach to you tonight there ain't
[1:36:49] no perfect people as far as Humanity our
[1:36:52] perfection is in the Lord Jesus but this
[1:36:56] is what we're supposed to do but let a
[1:36:58] man examine
[1:37:00] himself examine so what do you do you
[1:37:05] examine you have an examination go to a
[1:37:07] doctor you get an examination you take
[1:37:09] an exam as we call it what is it a test

[1:37:26] partake don't find something wrong and
[1:37:28] say oh I'm leaving whenever they pray I
[1:37:30] don't want to be hanging around so does
[1:37:32] that mean if the Lord comes tonight
[1:37:33] you'll be left now examine yourself fix
[1:37:38] what needs to be fixed and then
[1:37:41] eat wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:37:45] bread and drink this cup of the Lord and
[1:37:47] worthily shall be guilty of their body
[1:37:49] and the blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:37:51] examine himself and
[1:37:54] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[1:37:58] of that cup for he that eateth and
[1:38:00] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[1:38:02] Damnation to himself not Discerning the
[1:38:04] Lord's body for this cause many are weak
[1:38:08] and sickly among you and many sleep for

[2:06:52] o
[2:06:57] [Music]
[2:07:29] the
[2:07:33] [Music]
[2:07:54] we can imagine in our
[2:07:56] hearts by the time this
[2:08:00] portion of the service the last supper
[2:08:03] was
[2:08:05] done the disciples were
[2:08:08] perplexed
[2:08:11] overwhelmed I don't think they were
[2:08:13] running jumping shouting hollering and
[2:08:18] all of that they were
[2:08:19] just subdued because they had never seen
[2:08:22] their Master be in this type of attitude
[2:08:26] that he
[2:08:28] was and they're trying to comprehend
[2:08:31] what's going on and they haven't fully
[2:08:34] comprehended it until he does this St
[2:08:38] John
[2:08:40] 132 and supper being ended the devil
[2:08:44] having now put into the heart of Judas
[2:08:47] scariot Simon's son to betray him
[2:08:52] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[2:08:55] all things into his hands that he was
[2:08:58] come from God and went to God and he
[2:09:02] riseth from
[2:09:04] supper and laid aside his garments and
[2:09:07] took a towel and girded
[2:09:10] himself after that he pth water into a
[2:09:13] basin and began to wash the disciples
[2:09:16] feet and to wipe them with the towel
[2:09:20] this must have been
[2:09:22] overwhelming this was a slaves
[2:09:26] job the
[2:09:28] lowest of a household staff paid the
[2:09:32] least looked down on the most of
[2:09:36] footwash
[2:09:38] flunky so here Jesus humbles
[2:09:42] himself and begin to wipe them with a
[2:09:44] towel where with he was girded then
[2:09:47] cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter Sith
[2:09:49] unto him Lord D thou wash my feet Jesus
[2:09:54] answered and said unto him what I do
[2:09:57] thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know
[2:10:01] Hereafter Peter Sith unto him Thou shalt
[2:10:04] never wash my
[2:10:06] feet listen what Jesus answers
[2:10:10] him if I wash thee
[2:10:13] not thou Hast no part with
[2:10:17] me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not
[2:10:20] my feet only but also my hands and my
[2:10:25] head Jesus says unto him he that is
[2:10:29] washed needeth not to save to wash his
[2:10:33] feet and ye are clean but not all for he
[2:10:37] knew who should betray him therefore he
[2:10:39] said unto them you're not all clean so
[2:10:42] after he had washed their feet and had
[2:10:44] taken his garments and was set down
[2:10:46] again he said unto them know you what
[2:10:49] I've done unto you you call me master
[2:10:52] and
[2:10:53] Lord oh my I am your Lord and Master and
[2:10:58] I've done this to you so I'm making an
[2:11:01] example for each one of you you call me
[2:11:04] master and Lord and you say well for so
[2:11:06] I am if th then your Lord and Master
[2:11:09] have washed your feet ye also ought to
[2:11:13] wash one another's feet for I've given
[2:11:16] you an example that you should do as I
[2:11:18] have done unto you verely verely I say
[2:11:21] unto to you the servant is not greater
[2:11:22] than his Lord neither he that is sent
[2:11:25] greater than he that sent him if you
[2:11:27] know these things happy are ye if you do
[2:11:33] them now this is our first time of
[2:11:35] course in our our new church and we'll
[2:11:38] do it similar to to the way that we did
[2:11:41] it at at the old building the brothers
[2:11:44] will stay in here because mainly our
[2:11:46] musicians are men so whenever they get

[2:11:53] be able to be dismissed here just
[2:11:55] momentarily quietly reverently of course
[2:11:58] into the large forer where some sisters
[2:12:01] will Aid you in getting getting started
[2:12:04] and uh please remember that this is
[2:12:05] still part of the service so approach it
[2:12:07] reverently with no talking sisters
[2:12:10] needing nursing facilities we ask that
[2:12:12] you'd use the Overflow Nursery down here
[2:12:15] in the Sunday School room part so in
[2:12:17] case any of the brothers need to go to
[2:12:19] the restrooms they will be able to use
[2:12:21] the restrooms and the nurses there there
[2:12:23] will be deacons at the doors to ensure
[2:12:26] privacy and security and then we will
[2:12:28] let the sisters know when it's okay for
