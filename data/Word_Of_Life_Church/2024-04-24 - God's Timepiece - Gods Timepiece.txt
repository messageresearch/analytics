we love him we so appreciate him I want to say before we read the the scripture tonight how much we enjoyed the services this past week were you blessed yeah so amen so enjoyed the ministry of the word and the worship and singing and just the guest visitors that came in to be with us and I'm sure you know it by now that we have been robbed for several several years of being able to host meetings people don't understand it's a blessing to have the people of God to come in and we've been robbed from that because we hadn't had a facility to be able to do it but I'm so grateful that the Lord has give us a place where we can be able to do that the banquet was beautiful for those of you that wasn't here it was beautiful nice setting really nice food and everything went real good there brother Ander so blessed to say I want to say how much I appreciate all the effort and all the work mainly the sisters some of the brothers at bill things and help them hang things and all of that we so appreciate you doing that on Sunday the Deacon Brothers estimated between 750 and 800 people were here in the building which means that we had 75 approximately 75 more Vehicles than we had parking places for it's amazing what deacons can do so them parked in the field had them parked over here had them you know just parked everywhere where I appreciate all that effort I appreciate all the parking attendance and you there's more to a meeting than the preachers who preach it there's more to a meeting than the people who do the special singing There's always so much that goes on behind the scenes and I'm so grateful for everything that everybody has done God bless you we're just so appreciate let's turn tonight to the book of Zechariah if you would I thought that I was ready for tonight with u what had already been studying up during the week last week but early this morning the Lord give me a little bit different direction for tonight so I believe God's timing yes listen to that word timing is always perfect so I want to speak to you on God's time piece God's timing is always perfect Zechariah 12 verse one Zachariah was like several of the Old Testament prophets that he was able to prophesy of current events that was going on in his age but also able to see many many many thousands of years in advance of his time actually Zachariah prophesied about our day for he said in the evening time there shall be light so he spoke about us he spoke about Armageddon he spoke about the defeat of the Antichrist and all of that now let us pick up here in in chapter 12 verse one the burden of the word of the Lord for Israel sayth the Lord which stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundation of the Earth andth the spirit of man within him behold I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling now listen what God's going to do behold I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling so it's a metaphor that like a person is taking something and they're trying to take the contents or view the contents in the cup but their hand is so shaking looking at what is in the cup and want you notice what God said that he would make the cup of trembling I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about when they shall be in The Siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem and in that day I will make Jerusalem a burdensome Stone so Jerusalem is going to be a cup of trembling and it's also also going to be a burdensome Stone now this would have been a metaphor again common in that day to us make no sense whatsoever but that land is a land of a lot of rocks a lot of stones so one thing that they would do they would have Stones around their Villages and their cities and they would have different size of stones and different shapes of stones and one thing that they would use them for is for their young boys and they would have certain ones that the little boys could pick up and show their daddy how strong they were and their mama and then as they got older and they got stronger they could pick up the bigger ones and the bigger ones and the bigger ones but there was always a risk whenever you picked one of them up if you hadn't picked it up before to know how solid how dense that it was it could hurt you now listen what God Said and in that day I will I make Jerusalem a burdensome some Stone so people are going to try to pick it up they're going to try to manipulate Jerusalem they're going to try to do things with it but listen What God Says for all people now I realize that us here in the western civilization we're thousands of miles from Jerusalem we think what effect does that have on us on us but the prophet Zachariah said there would come a day when Jerusalem would be a burdensome stone for all people that's people in Africa people in India people in China people in Carter County all that burden themselves with it now notice what they're going to do all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces so then those that come and try to manipulate cut remove shape into whatever they think Jerusalem shall be God has warned them all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces though all the people of the earth now listen how many all the people of the Earth will be gathered together against it why it's such a tiny Place Jerusalem is not that big of a city why would all the earth and the people of the Earth have representation there and be against it notice this in question answers on Genesis in 1953 if you want to see what time of the year it is look on the calendar if you want to see what time of night it is look at the clock well you don't have to I'll tell you it's 7:40 if you want to see what day you're living in look where the Jews are that's God's time piece how many wants to know where we are I believe we better find out don't you that's God's time piece I skip on down on that paragraph there a little bit and he said now tonight the oldest flag in all the world the six-point star of David flies over Jerusalem for the first time in 2500 years since the carrying away of Babylon Jesus said when you see the Fig Tree putting forth its buds there she is there he said learn a parable you say Summer's nigh when you see this know that the times is at the door were right at the end of time let we like to be remember tonight as we pray Heavenly Father we believ that we are taught there's things for us to look at and watch and see in order to know what the hour is all of us are so familiar with keeping up with the time we have so many appointments and so many places to go so many things to do and our lives are on such a time schedule so time is very important to all of us but then Lord we look and we see of the events of the world we see where we are we believe the Rapture is close Armageddon is close so father we want to look tonight at your time piece be able to see where we are so if there's some come here present or will hear this service and maybe they haven't looked at the time piece quite accurately or they've looked at it and they've just casually glanced may they look at it in a very serious way tonight father you see this handkerchief that I have in my hand I pray over it tonight Lord I will stick in my pocket as I preach your word for sister Lona you see her need father in the name of Jesus would you go to our sister tonight and touch her Lord we pray in Jesus name and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated it's evident by the time we're living that many people do not look at Israel as we do as Believers pretty much the majority of mainstream if I can say it that way Christians would recognize that Israel has a certain place in God but yet you might be surprised to know that there are some Christians that are against the Jews there are some Christians that actually speak against the Jews of course they don't believe Romans n they don't believe what God says that he would do with them and it's hard for me to understand how they can even profess Christianity and believe such but for where we look at it we realize that God started dealing with them many many thousands of years ago and God has actually said the prophetic calendar by the dealings of Israel we know the 70 weeks of Daniel which are prophetic weeks given in a time frame the first set the 60 and two weeks and then the last one of course coming down that would be broke up by the Gentile dispensations we are fitting inside that time frame and that time piece of God and we know that more has happened in our age as far as God dealing with Israel that has happened for a couple of thousand years I me know it was 557 BC when Nebuchadnezzar came with the Babylonians and burnt the city and I told you just recently that they have found through archaeological digs and dug up some of the Timbers that were blackened with the fire that was set by Nebuchadnezzar and his soldiers now all that Bears record then not long ago they uncovered the arch that would have been from the western side of the Western Wall coming over into the streets and that Arch which would have fallen when Titus come in and burnt the cities so it's all there in the archaeological record and God of course we know has it also in his record of the word now watch the prophet again in the mark of the beast he says if you want to see what day of the month it is look on the calendar if you want to see what day in the season it is of the coming of the Lord watch where Israel's sitting that's God's time piece there she is set heading in her Homeland the oldest flag in the world Sixpoint start of David the oldest flag in the world flies again for the first time for 2500 years yes the inside now remember the prophet of the Old Testament said there would be an inside raised in the last days and yet it's easy to see even in America that people do not believe that God has a chosen people called Israel you see it on your news you read your newspaper you get it on your news apps it's absolutely beyond control and out of control what's taking place on many of our great campuses just this very day today arrests that are being made and yet many of the presidents of these leftist campus are letting it go on why because they are blind now won't you listen to me carefully tonight do you understand that when the bride goes home in the Rapture that day will be the greatest day that has ever been since the resurrection of our Lord Jesus for it will be the raising of the Dead the changing of the living but it will also be the unleashing and the beginning of the six seal now remember when the bride goes up Satan comes down there will be things that will happen so rapidly that the majority of the world will be totally overwhelmed now think Satan only has three and a half years left so he also will be on a Time Clock it's not like Satan will let it go for three months 6 months nine months and then all hell will break loose if the bride goes home in the morning in the rapture all hell will have broken Loose by the time you get off work tomorrow if you miss the Rapture right there are things that are going on behind the scenes even now which is Satan's mechanics that he's getting everything possible that he can get ready until the bride is gone for we know that Paul wrote it there 2,000 years ago for he that L us will let until he be taken out of the way and then the wicked one shall be revealed of course the prophet took that scripture and he quoted it when he preached the seals and I really like the way that he read it and the way brought it into present life he that now led us will let Christ the bride Christ the bride the elect he that now let us will let until he oh you say brother Donnie said he and the prophet said the bride she you see the Capstone will have come down and she will be identified with him and when she is taken out of the way you understand the reason that the world is not already overrun is because the bride is still here there is still feel Mercy On The Mercy Seat because the blood is still identified there apparently there are some people who are not yet saved or some that haven't yet received the Holy Ghost or there's some that are saved have received the Holy Ghost and they've just not yet come to that state of maturity and when they do then the Rapture will be the culmination of all these things that God has done for thousand thousand of years when the bride goes up that very day if the bride leaves this world at 9:00 in the morning and the bride walks into the paradise of God and Satan sees her and recognizes what has taken place do you understand Washington DC Belgium all Munich Germany all the Nations and their capitals Johannesburg South Africa Harari Zimbabwe all the capitals all the Great municipals and the great controlling centers of the World by by 5:00 that afternoon there will be such a change over the entire Earth the majority of the people will never know what is taking place until the laws start being changed which will happen day by day by day by day the six seal will begin to open up and the wraths of God will be poured out in accumulative form like it has never been before people will start being hunted down because they profess Jesus Christ people will be killed their lives will be taken and it will happen overnight now s the devil knows he has but a short time in some sense of the word he smarter than we are cuz we act like we got plenty of time well come on now there's folks around the message that have sat around it for years and years ain't got the Holy Ghost and don't even want it there's people that's got sin in their lives and they know they do and they act like they got plenty of time one of these days you're going to wake up and realize a bride's done go you show up at Word of Life Church and the pastor and lot of the rest of these people will be totally missing then what are you going to do I hope and pray to God there ain't none of my family left if they miss the Rapture I hope they die before the Rapture takes place that may sound crazy to you I'd rather toce them dead than to go through the tribulation period there ain't nobody here in this building tonight has an idea of how horrible that is fixing to be come on now God knew that Israel would leave the word he knew that when he made a covenant with Abraham verified the Covenant with Isaac with Jacob and then of course ratified it even further in the possession of the land under Joshua and before Moses ever left God instructed Moses to tell the people of Israel I know what you all will do I know that you will turn away from me and let me tell you what I'm going to do to you when you do now remember these are God's covenant chosen people read with me in Leviticus 26:32 and I will bring the land into desolation and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it now what's God the very God that said I'll bless you I'll make you the head not the tail I'll bless you coming in I'll bless you going out I'll bless you I'll do all these great things but this is what he also tells them when they disobey so God said this is what I'm going to do to your blessed Promised Land I will turn it into desolation and your enemies will move in the land and they will dwell there and they shall be astonished at it your enemies will look at it and see what has happened because your Disobedience not only affected you but it affected this great land notice again Leviticus 26:33 and I will scatter better you among the Heathen and will draw out a sword after you and your land shall be desolate and your cities waste Deuteronomy 4:26 I call Heaven and Earth to witness against you this day now this is Moses the prophet saying this that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land where un until you go over Jordan to possess it now you imagine they've not even got over there yet but he's telling them before they go let me tell you what you're going to do you're going to leave the word and this is what's going to happen to you I'm going to turn against you the same God that brought you in I'm going to turn against you I'll tell you one thing friends whenever God gets upset at us oh my well you think the devil being mad at you is an issue you think Mama been mad at you your boss been mad at you it ain't nothing like when God gets upset at you now I want you to notice what what he says he said that you shall soon utterly perish off the land well until you go over Jordan to possess it you shall not prolong your days upon it notice this is all based on them this is not God wanting this God did not want that God does not want to punish us as members of the elect of God do you understand that our message the move of the message will turn to a very similar thing it's already going in that direction to where that will be some that will despise the new birth we already have preachers message preachers that preach against a real experience with God they preach against the manifestation of the Holy Ghost in an individual's life they preach against people worshiping and people dancing in the spirit what are they doing fixing to rid themselves of this Promised Land called the message of the hour and God will drive them from it amen notice in verse 27 and the Lord shall scatter you among the Nations and you shall be left few in number among the Heathen whether the Lord shall Lead You Deuteronomy chapter 28: 64 and the Lord shall scatter thee among all people from one end of the Earth even unto the other and th shalt thou serve other gods which neither thou nor thy fathers have known even wood and stone you want to know why Jews are in Germany fulfilling God's word you want to know why Jews are in New York City they don't belong there come on somebody you know why Jews are Nashville you know why Jews are in Asheville North Carolina you know why they're all over the world cuz God said that's where they'd go it's not a sign of God's blessing that they're there it's a sign of their Disobedience when you leave the message of the hour and you say well I'm going down here to this charismatic church and I'm going over here to this church where they don't really quote the prophet God's blessing us so much H that ain't a sign of God's blessing it's a sign of your Disobedience well come on somebody well praise the Lord I don't bear the reproach over here like I do going to Word of Life cuz our pastor don't read from the prophet's message he ain't fit to stand behind the pull pit if he don't I'll tell you that right now he's a coward and a yellow bellied and he ain't got no rights packing a Bible you'd be surprised how common that's becoming Among Us Nehemiah chapter 1 verse 8 brother Donnie you'd have a whole lot more people if you wouldn't preach that way and what kind of people would I have bunch of cigarette sucking bobhair painted face Jezebels that don't want to hear the truths of the word of God I'd rather have five people full of the Holy Ghost that wanted to move a god than 10,000 Devils woo Glory Nehemiah 1 ver8 remember I beseech see the word that thou commandest thy servant Moses saying if you transgress now watch Nehemiah is years later reminding god of the prophecy which we just read which how commandest thy servant Moses saying if you transgress I will scatter you abroad among the Nations but if you turn into B keep my Commandments notice if so it's not based on God it's not God that wanted to run them out out so God could prove something God is simply foreseeing what they would do God knew what Luther would do God knew what wesa would do God knew what Pentecost would do I'm going to go ahead and say it God knew what a lot of the message people would do after took his profit from the earth well praise the Lord oh my though they were of You cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven yet well I gather them from th and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name now remember God is basing it on them so here is the clock so when Titus comes in 70 AD and captures the city and of course thousands times thousands and Josephus said that the blood was running so deep in Jerusalem that people waited through the blood and Mada was one of the life strongholds and it took them quite some time to take it but yet they did and it happened exactly as the Lord Jesus said and as Jeremiah Zachariah and the other prophets of the Old Testament and they packed them away but I want you to remember now one of the things that the Palestinian cause is is causing such an uproar in America and around the world is because they claim that the land of Israel belongs to them I say they are liars and every University Professor that says it belongs to them is also an educated liar God said I give that land to Abraham and his [Applause] seed well praise the Lord all the Palestinians are basically it's a bunch of squatters don't you understand what's the natural parallel the spiritual don't you understand to see how our government's got that if you leave an apartment or you leave a building or you leave a house and you leave it vacant for so long squatters can come in and move into your house and they've got more rights than you do that's our government that's in charge making all the laws and the rules well it's the same way the devil is trying to do to the people of Israel and telling them hey you all left out of here 2,000 years ago and now this land belongs to us it belongs to a Jew as long as there's one alive it belongs to the people of Israel because God said this land is yours well let me say the same thing to us the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ being the same yesterday today and forever that is our land is that our land that is our inheritance well the devil say you got away from it yeah to our shame we did get away from it but we're back home amen we are back home we are not letting go of our land oh my but now remember God knew that there would be a time that the prophetic clock would start again that he would start moving and the hands would start moving with him notice in Jeremiah 231 W be unto the pastors that destroy and Scatter the Sheep of my pastor sayith the Lord therefore thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel against the pastors that Feed My People ye have scattered my flock let me say this is not just pertinent to the Old Testament but it's pertinent to the new we be preachers around this message that divide the people of God and put them fussing and fighting and arguing and dividing over this Doctrine and this issue and that issue you come on somebody this is what God said to them kind of preachers God puts a woe wo a woe on preachers that have divided don't sit there and look at me weird some of the greatest divisions we've had in this message over the years have been by preachers that have introduced all types of false Doctrine the seven Thunders divided us perusia divided us you know now the tape thing is divid this and all kinds of things are divid do you understand you think they're getting by with that according to the Eternal Word of God every preacher that divides God's flock if he don't repent and make right that thing he will walk Before the Throne of God expecting a reward one day and God will judge him with a woe oh my because he used his pull pit to divide the people of God I was somebody who would preach with me tonight we want to damnn the denominations and say they're going to hell and we're just as divided as they are the Baptist won't speak to the Methodist and the Methodist won't speak to the Church of Christ come on somebody and the people inside of our message the 7th under people won't speak to the perusia people and the perusia people won't speak to the tape only [Applause] people oh goodness therefore thus sayith the Lord God of Israel against the pastors that Feed My People ye have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not visited them behold I will visit upon you the evil of your doings sayith the Lord and I will gather the remnant a watch of my flock notice where they're at of all countries whether I have driven them why Disobedience and will bring them again to their foes and they shall be fruitful and increase I honestly don't care what AAS says I don't care what the PLO says or the doo or any other oh oh oh this is what God Almighty says God said I'm going to bring them back there ain't enough power in NATO to stop him from doing it I'm sure that you followed it friends just a few weeks ago when Iran was sending in all their uavs and their ballistic missiles and all that they did over 60,000 tons of explosives and David's sling and all the rest of Israel's Armament with the with the thank God at least a few airplanes from the US and the UK and Australia and they stopped 99% of those missiles I saw a rabbi the other day he said people don't believe in the Supernatural he said I'm telling you we was all up praying that night it was the hand of the same God that brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt he said here come them missiles this way that way that way that way and you know what one little bedwin boy one little bedwin boy was the only person that even got any injuries a lot of them stopped on the outside boy the angels of God must have been busy that night wouldn't it and here they hunkered down over 300 of them coming and Iran thought no doubt they would annihilate there I don't care what Iran does I don't care what a rat does I don't care what Joe Biden say Joe Biden ain't nobody compared to [Applause] God I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whether I have driven you saith the Lord and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive Jeremiah 31:7 for thus sayeth the Lord sing with gladness for Jacob and Shout among the chief of the Nations publish

earth one of the signs of Destruction before the days of Noah was violence in the earth look at it the increase of crime come on Saints the increase of crime many of our major cities cannot even hire

into unbelievers they got a degree in this and a degree in that and a degree in something else and they put more more value in what some professor said than they do an anointed servant of God no Professor is going to lead you through the Gates of Glory if you get there you'll get there following anointed Servants of God not a professor amen notice God said behold I will bring them from the North Country Russia Ukraine I'll gather them from the coasts of the Earth and with them the Blind and the lame the woman with the child and her the travail usful child together a great company shall

shaking down jail houses I believe in the Jail House Rock myself not the kind that Elvis sung about but the kind that Paul had come on now well come on somebody so God said here ye the word of the Lord ye nations he that scattered Israel will gather him and keep him as a Shepherd does his flock Ezekiel 11:17 therefore say thus sayith the Lord God I will even gather you from the people and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered and I will give you the land anybody know where the name Palestine comes from you don't find God using it anybody know Rome Rome it was one of the great Emperors because the Jews had caus him such problems he wanted to change the land from the name of Israel to a Roman rendition of what we call Palestine you see Rome specializes in changing names and titles and so on so they hated water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus so they changed that to father son Holy Ghost but as you know we don't use titles we use the name so the land over there according to God is the land of Israel Hallelujah GL oh my well let them stand up there and chant and let them March around and let this bunch of weak bunch of politicians you know what it's all about friend it's an election year come on wake up it's an election year that's why they're getting Bible all this Tommy rod and chist but it's time that we have some at least some politician that's got a little bit of guts and say you know what this ain't right let me ask you one question if it was a bunch of conservative Christians and they were standing up there doing this against homosexuals what do you think would happen yeah if it was a bunch of Jews that were standing up there doing this against the Muslims what do you think would happen you know what would happen then throw them in jail that's right but the pre-tribulation anointing is here do you understand how close then that puts us brother Paul it's the pre-tribulation anointing is sh and people are already acting like they're in the tribulation saying hate things and deaths to this and deaths to that then shouldn't there be a people on the Earth already living acting praying worshiping under a pre Rapture anointing Oh Glory to God hallelujah if they are getting one with their head one with their head the devil should not we become one with our head Christ oh hallelujah thank Hallelujah and I will bring you out from the people and will gather you out of the countries when you are scattered with a mighty hand with a stretched out arm with Fury poured out Ezekiel 36:24 for I will take you from among the Heathen and gather you out of all countries and we bring you into hamas's land y s ARA Fett your land Mark Twain visited Palestine in 1871 he documented the Desolation and UNP nature of Palestine as a hopeless dreary heartbroken land why the right inhabitants weren't there now some of you I'm only to get mad so go ahead and take your mad pill now you take all the message Believers out of this message every book and every tape we've got every picture everything that pertains to the message itself does not have life but you know what gives life you know what the fundamental Foundation of it is it's them pillars that Paul wrote about it's the Believers in the church that holds that truth up oh thank God for the tapes thank god oh yes I love and praise the Lord but the tapes are not the reality of this message the reality of this message is God taking this message and living in human beings the Rapture is not for the tapes the Rapture is not for your Bible the Rapture is for you [Applause] Oh Glory so when the people leave the land the land becomes desolate now this is 1871 whenever he was there and he describes it as a hopeless dreary heartbroken land on the approach to Jerusalem that was hardly a tree or a shrub anywhere where even the Olive Tree and the cactus those Fast Friends of a worthless soil had almost deserted the country that's pretty bad when a cactus says I'm out of here don't you understand friends don't you understand when the Rapture takes place and those that have just been around the framework or the outskirts of the message they've hung around it for years and years and never really got in because there's too much reproach don't you understand they'll still have their tapes they'll still go to church if they believe in going to church and they'll still do all the things that they did but even the cactus will have left the Olive Tree will be gone the message will be desent amen sir well either you believe that or you believe the Rapture is Jesus coming down here and he went away to prepare taper acts in heaven behold I go away to prepare taper acts in heaven if I go away I will come again and receive your tapes unto myself that where I am there your tapes may be also sir brother sir our message our church Jeffersonville voice voice of God all of our church buildings will turn into Atomic F some of these poor message people that have spent their entire life fighting preachers will turn into Atomic water Fredick hasselquist whenever I don't like the name Reagan I read names like this and I think you know what Reagan ain't so bad after all would you imagine introducing your pastor brother Fredick hasselquist will now come and preach for us a Swedish doctor and naturalist visited the today's Israel Gaza West Bank and he wrote that the holy land is uncultivated and almost uninhabited don't you see why we needed a message the message of Pentecost the message of Hebrews 138 that's what it was brother Johnson uncultivated uninhabited and God sent a prophet with a message to put inhabitants back in Acts two to put inhabitants back in Acts 4 to put inhabitants back in Hebrews 138 and don't you see what the devil's trying to do he hates it because there's in inhabitants in the land of Acts 24 again there's inhabitants in the land of Hebrews 1day he can't stand it the primary source of income to the Turkish Administration it was the Turks at this time that was controlling the land it's the fees charged to the visitors 4,000 European Greek and Armenian visitors yearly along with an equal number of Jews from all quarters of the world he estimates the Jewish population of Jerusalem to be 20,000 ah now remember this is during the same time time frame 1874 that Mark train went in 1871 ah so minute I I I thought that that all the Jews left you believed a lie that's what they want you to believe that way it don't make the Palestinians squatters it makes Jew squatters and that's what they want to tell you you're squatting on this Holy Ghost Land no I ain't I live here I got a title de I got a right to be here come on somebody I got a right to pray I've got a right to pray sometime till I get so far out I don't even talk talking English no more I got a right praise the Lord to lay my hands on the sick and watch God heal them I've got a right to experience the supernatural I am not a squatter I'm a landowner he estimates the Jewish population of Jerusalem to be 20,000 surely a substantial proportion of its population while the town of Tiberius is described as half inhabited by Arabs and the other half by Jews who pay taxes to the denominations I mean to the Arabs Felix b a Christian Theologian and professor of French literature and Hebrew visited the Holy Land in 1858 I wrote a book describing it but describes a dreary Des landscape that is sparsely inhabited I hope you're running the parallel tonight in your own heart that it's like a Believer when they read the scriptures of this hour before inhabitants got into it and it's like that scripture just couldn't come alive to them yet they knew that was the word of God in Mark 16 all these wonderful words of God and yet it's a desolate place there ain't nobody living there aren't you glad but God Sanctuary tonight in the building living in these scriptures oh my notice he notes that close to half of the population of Jerusalem is Jews and that a majority of the Jews in Jerusalem are oh no indigenous indigenous wow so you mean they have been there this whole time so all Jews wasn't drove out and then the poor Palestinians come in there and these poor oh mean hateful Jews they come in and drove them out of their land there's always been Jews there's always been somebody God could put his hand on in every age even if there wasn't but one man but God had a representation God was going to have a representation in the land of Jews because he knew this Palestine denominational Spirit would raise up and say you all can't have the same Holy Ghost Peter had and I say do come too late to tell me I got it how many's got it oh Glory my notice he concludes at Palestine section of the book citing that the Turks have made a desert of it where it's scarcely possible to walk without fear even the Arabs who do so now notice who made a desert out of it the Turks now Eagles but turkeys buzzards well come on now some of y'all don't don't don't look at me so funny you used to Fellowship turkeys hopefully you aren't now hopefully you're fellowshipping a little bit higher and you're climbing up but I want you to notice who turned it into this desolate place the Turks even the Arabs who dwell there do so as temporary sojourners so they're over here at one church for a while and then they go over to another church and then they're back over here and they're over there but you know what whenever Israel begin to get in there and they begin to make caboots anybody know familiar with that term caboots you don't what it is okay they would go in and they lock in a certain spot and they pull all their money together and that everybody lives from that Community things sort of like the book of Acts so they all come in there and they work together they slave together they labor together they fight together they do whatever they had to do it's a kaboot they still happen today we visited some whenever we were there actually stayed in one whenever we were there so it's a community to where they all come together and they live and they were but the Arab church members they just hopped around from here and there and there oh I don't believe in going to church I I don't need nobody I don't need nobody you could get your throat cut by living that way amongst them Arabs you could get your spiritual water taken from me by all the demons such around you believe it or not we need one another come on somebody I'll tell you what we need too we need visiting ministers to come in and preach to us as well come on Saints oh brother Donnie you're my favorite preacher well that's all well and good but we need other men that'll come in and preach to us too the late American Economist Fred M gosell published in an article titled the population of Palestine Circa 1875 in 1979 in the jour Middle Eastern studies in it Gothel refers to the writings and reports of 13 listen now additional mid 19th century observers including James Finn the British Council for Palestine all of them he writes report that Palestine is a desolate underpopulated place the problem was the Blessed people wasn't in the land so God could start blessing the land for the Blessed people so you see if the land itself is the only thing then the Arabs and the Turks and whoever ever they could be there man they don't have do nothing the land flowing of milk and honey that is not exactly true that's right amen when you go there and look around yourself and you think Lord what in the world did you see in this place and then you hold up a mirror and say I guess the same thing you saw in this place yeah when you look around let me tell you something there's places in Tennessee and Kentucky that is way more beautiful than Israel I mean some of them places are as bare and dry and Barren as they can be don't you know why CZ the people ain't in the right place so when the people's where they need to be then God starts pouring down the rain and God sends the Dew and God said so it's not like to the land oh the word is blessed the word is Holy the word is wonderful but the word can only be personified when people get into the word and then God goes to blessing the people and the word becomes magnified the word becomes fruitful the continuity of Jewish life in the Holy Land Is Well documented the Jewish presence in Palestine did not pum it to zero after the jewi defeat by the Romans in 70 CE which is common error archaeological evidence shows that with the fall of Jerusalem the center of Jewish life in Palestine shifted to Galilee oh I love that Man From Galilee for he's done so very much for me a so it moved from the big headquarters up in Jerusalem where cfas and all the rest of those guys were down to Capernaum and Galilee where Peter James John Bartholomew but they always was Jews there an autonomous Jewish presence existed until 4:29 CE and Jews constituted a majority of the population of Palestine up until the last century now I want you to notice now the population of the Jews in 1948 76,7 current population 7 million 208,000 and they have so much water they sell water to Jordan they have so much water they sell water to other Arab Nations around them and yet before they didn't hardly have enough water to grow an orange tree what the blessing returned when the Blessed people got back wo glory to God glory to God hallelujah don't you understand why it's so important for you to come to the house of God why not just important for you to come to church but for you to be in your place in Christ Jesus what could happen right here tonight if every one of us could get in our proper place there ain't no telling what God would do what but we've got to be in our place in the blessing we don't want God just to bless this building we want God to bless this pull pit bless this piano bless this carpet he'll bless us because we're here together then the blessing of God returns GL oh my sir can I have a few more minutes us anti-Semitism is at 337 6 October the 7th now remember I stood right here and told you after October the 7th initially the people would stand with Israel you don't remember it do you but I told you to remember because eventually they will turn against them what don't does that mean you're a prophet just means they got a little bit of Common Sense they do the bride the same way yes they do notice an alltime record ADL which is a group that keeps up with all this says anti-Semitism the Watchdog it also sise in global incidents since Hamas Massacre including 91% increase in Australia and 1563 anti-semitic incidents across the UK the UN has pass more resolutions against Israel than all the rest of the nations of the world put together what is it pre tribulation anointing are you watching God's time piece it's moving if they're working under their anointing of Destruction deaths kill the Jews and remember they will the Jews once again will be in that at and they're already chanting it gas them gas them and then in deborn Michigan a couple weeks ago they said kill the Americans we love you Hamas college students University intellectuals bunch of idiots Amen brother Donnie I don't like that well I'll say it again for your sake then so I make you doubly mad maybe I can cast that devil off of you get that old intellectual thing out of you friends God don't want us to be people of the head he wants us to be people of the heart notice students that are growing number of us colleges and universities are forming anti- Israel protest encampments with a unified demand that their school stop doing business with Israel don't you understand forerunning the mark of the beast and you watch that weakling we got in the White House you watch them weaklings in the senates and them weaklings in Congress now come on now you bunch of politicians you watch some of our weaking in the state of Tennessee oh yeah Nashville is getting more liberal all the time and if Nashville gets control East Tennessee will be overrun by all of them come on don't get mad at me don't you see it's going to dominate the world but I'm glad before it kicks in and goes into him we'll be gone but what I'm trying to show you is if they're already working under it shouldn't we be under the anointing of a catching way the Nationwide movement has gain momentum and has taking on new strength as administrators continue to allow anti-israel demonstrations at schools like Colombia Yale MIT UC Berkeley University of Southern California premere Premier universities that the rich and the wealthy send their kids to but you know why a bunch of them kids are doing that because their masas and daddies didn't read them the prophecies I read to you tonight they don't know a bit more about their Bible than nothing I've seen on YouTube or some of these news forecasts saying do you know what that saying means from The River To The Sea yall have heard that saying they're saying from The River To The Sea well what they're saying is every Jew dead every Jew gone from the river to the Sea they're quoting God's promise to Israel and when they go to asking all these students what does it mean they don't even know they don't even know what it means can't you see they're under this anointing and they're screaming and they're hollering and they're they're just jumping and running and we're not leaving we're not leaving and whatever they kiss oh my they kiss these signs we kiss the nukes are you got to be kidding me they want Iran to send nuclear bombs to Israel Ain't Them Palestinians got one mcka sense do you actually think nuclear warfare is going to stop with a with a Hamas border people's insane I said people's insane they don't even know what they're protesting about if they can move under an anointing like that oh how we ought to be able to move under anointing when we know what we're talking about brother Jack we know what we believe Justin we know what's been said if they can do it and they don't even know what is River to the Sea well I don't know I don't know and you should see the looks on some of their faces they're dumbfounded why pre-tribulation anointed and they say they're not moving we're not giving up until our University does this and that and the other well if they can do that what about us we're not giving up till the devil turns loose of our kids till the devil turns loose of our bodies till the devil turns loose of your husband your wife whatever it is let me close Revel Revelation 12:12 therefore Rejoice ye heavens and you that dwell in them woe unto the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down unto you and listen how he descends having great wrath he is so so Furious he don't have peace on his mind he don't have love safety deaths Annihilation destruction because he knowth that he has but a short time and when the dragon saw that he was cast into the Earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the Manchild now we know the woman in the symbolism Revelation 12 that brought forth the Manchild was the Jewish nation and whenever she brought forth a Manchild something went out of his mouth which is thickness and multitudes of people to go out and capture the Manchild which was the birth of the Lord Jesus so now here we Skip and the car picks up again you never know that this 2,000 year Span in between the first part of Revelation 12 in this 12th verse here and when the dragon saw that he was cast into the air notice the first thing that he does goes after the Jews why why has Israel been fought over so many times 55 Wars been fought over that place the size of New Jersey why why because he knows he loves it and then he saying he loves he hates I don't tell you a lot about yourself yes sir notice he persecuted the woman which brought forth a Manchild and so the woman were given two wings of a great Eagle that she might find to the Wilderness into her place where she's nourished for a time and times and half time three and a half years from the face of the serpent notice his titles are interchangeable devil dragon serpent that's and the serpent cast out of his mouth water remember remember water represents thickness of multitude of people as a flood so the devil cast out of his mouth all these people on the Earth and they just started compassing the Jews oh we hate you you so much Believe It or Not there'll be some of the denominational Christians that'll join in with them but of course they'll hide behind this guys you kill Jesus you kill Jesus them Jews that'll be living during that time frame didn't kill Jesus any more than I'm to blame for slavery in the days of 1865 I ain't never owned a slave in my life so don't blame me well come on somebody didn't he all know that the largest slave owner in the state of Tennessee was a black man that's right I'd like to hear some of them talk about that I ain't never owned no slave and if slavery was legal I wouldn't want a own one I'd probably be one the truth is not but you know what don't blame me for what they done back there you cannot blame these modern day Jews whenever you crucify them yourself when the word of God is made manifest and you won't comply to that you're worse than them Jews [Applause] was if y'all want to help a poor fired preacher I'll be standing on University and the ramp there of uh I I'll stand there tomorrow that sign up there we'll work for food the serpent cast out of his mouth Waters of flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away isn't it amazing not Russia as soon as he comes to the Earth he does not attack Ukraine Japanese Chinese a woman and the Earth helped the woman and the Earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the Dragon cast out of his mouth and the dragon was WS with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the Commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ stand let me finish you I'll just let you rest for a minute future home just a little while will be summoned then the Rapture will come a little bitty group like Enoch will be taken up then the remnant of the woman's seed that keep the Commandments of God Jews have the testimony of Jesus Christ Gentile will be hunted down like dogs so here John merges together both groups Jews and Gentiles so those who refuse to should be washed in the bloody word and they go on to their Church oh I believe Jesus I'm saved yep I believe that I believe they're saved but you don't go in the Rapture just because you're saved you got to be sealed to go in the Rapture now to be honest with you I don't understand how these Gentiles will even be able to do it if they didn't have enough victory in their lives to live a Godly sanctify IED life how in the world can they live during the time of tribulation remember the mercy seed will be Smoky there'll be no blood there won't be another person saved no more Gentiles receiving the Holy Ghost it's over and the devil go straight after the Jews and the Gentiles and they will give their life for their testimony Joel 3:2 I will also gather all nations and bring them down into a valley of Jehoshaphat and will plead with them there for my people and for my Heritage Israel whom they have scattered among the Nations and parted my land zachar Zephaniah 38 therefore will you wait upon me sayeth the Lord until the day day that I Rise Up To Thee pray for my determination is to gather the Nations that I may assemble the kingdoms so here will come Russia here will come China Iran Iraq Syria well you say what about the United States by this time the United States will have entered into the seventh Vision that God showed Elijah smolter heaps of Ashes annihilated dear God our home our homeland I'm an American I'm an American I don't say that with joy dear God to pour upon them my indignation even all my Fierce anger for all the Earth shall be devoured with a fire of my jealousy Zechariah 14:1 I'll close behold the day of the Lord cometh and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee for I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle and the city shall be taken and the houses is rifled and the women ravished h of the city shall go forth into captivity and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city then shall the Lord go forth and fight against those Nations as when he fought in the day of battle this my friends is the battle of Armageddon and his feet shall stand in that day upon the the Mount of Olives which is before Jerusalem on the East and the Mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst toward the East and toward the west and there shall be a great Valley now between the Mount of Olives now and where Jerusalem is so if you're up on the Mount of Olives like this looking this way there's a valley down here now here's the Garden of Gethsemane the Church of all Nations some different tombs absalon's tomb some different things down in the valley this Valley is called the Kidron Valley then you go right up you're looking straight at the Eastern Gate the Mims buried a lot of their dead there because they believed that the Messiah would not go through a cemetery and they think he's going through the Eastern Gate so they buried all the dead there to keep him from going through the gate but he'll go through nonetheless but when he steps there like this then the Mountain will shake and an earthquake underneath his feet will create this Valley Oh Glory to God and the people of Israel will run into this Valley remember from this Valley will come forth the waters which will go forth to the hinder sea actually whenever we set up in the Millennium and the Millennium Temple is built from the Cliff of the Rock in the mountain of Olives will come forth the living streams out from under the presence of God and go to the Dead Sea and when those

feel like they're not a professional fighter well neither was sham G he was no professional fighter he was a farmer but one day he just got sick and tired of the Philistines and the Philistines lived in the land of Gaza so right now the Gaza Strip is part of that same ground that the Philistines lived on and they come out out of that land over into Israel's land and shamgar said I'm sick of it he didn't have no nuclear weapons he didn't have no rifles but he had an ox goat he was no major he wouldn't even know private all of a sudden the anointing of the hour fell on him praise God here come them Philistines getting ready to Rob him the prophet said his little children was dressed the clothes and already fallen off of them his little wife so ragged and so poor they robbed him last year

world Hallelujah Lord Hallelujah Lord Jesus would you just minister to your children tonight father I pray help us to understand Lord the parallel of tonight that the blessings of God don't fall on the carpet in here it don't fall on the pulpit it don't fall on the seats it comes in here when we're here you're here because we're here oh God help us to see that's the reason you showed up this week in such a mighty way wasn't because you thought this building was so nice I think I'll just go down I really like that building but you said I'm going to visit them cuz my wife is there my wife from several provinces of Canada my wife from 20 some different churches was that was is going to be there I'm going to show up and bless the young people of that message I'm going to fill with the Holy Ghost I'm going to heal and did you show up amen oh thank you Lord but you come not because this building you come because of us oh Lord turn our land into a land flowing with milk and honey we know Lord even now I got to see of some of them there and there is when that took desert places Lord as we stood right there where where was a a kabo one of the first ones and right from the top of that place looking over at the pass that we came up and there we could see the Wilderness of sin or Zen also it's called The Very place that Moses brought the Chanel of Israel through what a what a terrible place and yet right within Rock throwing distance was a kabo and there was trees and Orchards and Gardens and plants because they got in there and labored and worked and they transformed it Lord we got a bunch of spiritual Arabs I'm afraid in the message they want the preacher to do all the praying they want him to do all the pumping and do all the irrigation and do all the watering they just live an old carnal foolish life out here in the world and expect to come to church two or three times a week and the blessing of God just be poured out on them because they come here they don't do one thing they don't put forth no effort Lord God may we leave this place tonight with a different desire Lord may we gra drag out our grabit hole may we drag out our shovel may we drag out our pump may we drag out whatever we got to do Lord I'm going to put forth an effort this is my caboots and this belongs to me and my family you entrusted us of this place Lord what can we do what can we do as a family to make our church better what can we do Lord that the blessing of God will flow on us amen are we happy coming up to our Jerusalem and sing is it Mark Twain saw it what would our message become if we listen to a lot of these people around the message and the preachers sat down and quit preaching that quit laying hands on the sick that quit making alar calls if I listen to everything a bunch of these Kneads told me to do I would never preach another sermon I'd never pray for nobody else I'd just become a puppet to some of of these man-made denominational systems I ain't going to do it Lord I've got my mtic on my back I've got my shovel under my arm I've got my scoop and I've got my 45 on one side and I've got my Uzi on the other side so I'll shoot Devils while I'm digging ditches I'll do whatever I've got to do cuz there's some thirsty children here tonight father there's some hungry children tonight Lord God we are willing to work and our caboots we're willing to press through the powers of hell so you can pour out your blessings Among Us yes Lord oh granted I pray father thank you Lord thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus I ask you tonight be mindful

bodies are going to be changed I pray for Harry tonight Karen Justin Lord you see all of our needs in this place Lord oh Father make our olive tree bloom again make our fig tree bloom again Lord God oh Jesus we're back in our land so bless the land our Lord hallelujah I believe Lord God we're we've got Apostolic times moving among us but as your Prophet said in birthing faith when he prayed he said we've got them Apostolic times moving among us but we desire to see more of it not a return to isusa street but a return back to Jerusalem hallelujah hallelujah bless the land oh God bless the land oh God and what did Israel do you gave them the invention of drip irrigation for before many farmers around the world would take great big pipes and put it out in their fields and they' pump the water and waste gallons thousands and thousands of gallons of water but like you fi y do as you told Israel in the Old Testament you will be a blessing to many and you gave the invention to drip irrigation where they put a little tiny tiny tiny small pipe down by each plant and drip drip drip drip drip and instead of wasting that water all that water goes to waste well Lord sometimes I feel like that's the way we are sometimes we get under the Fountain of the blessing of God our cup just runs over and then and other times it seems like we're hooked up to the drip irrigation of the Holy Ghost and he don't come in like a rushing Mighty Wind as it were but he gives a little bit of drip of peace and a drip of the anointing and a drip of love and a drip of this and the next thing I know is car cup is running over anyway but it's running over drip after drip after drip so Lord no matter how you send it to us father you just have your way in our life will you Lord we love you tonight Jesus we worship you father we bless your holy name thank you Lord oh thank you Lord God thank you Lord God we praise you tonight Lord Jesus thank you Lord thank you Lord Jesus har maybe we can sing together when can Jesus comes to Earth to live with this again before long friends all the armies of the earth will one day gather and they will pass before that great reviewing stand and I find it to

a sword rather into a plow share only when King Jesus comes to live with us again think of it we are closer than any generation that's ever been on the face of the Earth can we just worship him a little before we go I know you got to work tomorrow in school but let's just worship him a little bit before we go can we sing it for us har praise the Lord all the arm praise the Lord the world will
