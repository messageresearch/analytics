[30:18] hallelujah
[30:20] we realized we're living in an age when
[30:23] many of the lay of decisions want to
[30:26] worship but not many m-1 obey I don't
[30:31] only want to worship Him but I want to
[30:33] obey Him as I realize true obedience is
[30:37] what really leads to divine worship
[30:41] Sartain glad to be together tonight in
[30:43] the presence of God what a privilege it
[30:45] is for us Song of Solomon chapter 5
[30:49] verse 4 that I hear brother already
[30:52] praying again no they are God bless you
[30:54] brothers just roberson my baby with us
[30:56] again tonight I love that accent don't
[30:59] you hope y'all been enjoying your visit
[31:05] around the states and different places
[31:07] sorry nice to see you again before you
[31:09] head home
[31:10] song on Solomon chapter 5 verse 4 this
[31:18] is quite a book the Song of Solomon
[31:21] it's a little book as far as chapters
[31:25] and verses but it's a big book when it
[31:27] comes to the mysteries that it contains
[31:31] my beloved put his hand by the hole of
[31:35] the door and my bowels were moved for
[31:39] him I rose up to open to my beloved and
[31:44] my hands dropped with myrrh in my
[31:49] fingers with sweet-smelling myrrh upon
[31:53] the handles of the log i opened to my
[31:57] beloved but my beloved had withdrawn
[32:01] himself and was gone my soul failed when
[32:07] he spake i sought him but I could not
[32:12] find him I called him but he gave me no
[32:18] answer for the
[32:20] of you tonight that are filled with the
[32:22] Holy Ghost verse six is one of the most
[32:27] devastating things that can happen in
[32:31] the life of a believer losing a mother
[32:34] losing a father losing a child things
[32:37] like that in the natural sense are
[32:38] terrible truly terrible but to know that
[32:42] our soul failed whenever he knocked and
[32:45] we did not respond there can be no
[32:48] greater disappointment to a real
[32:50] believer now realize the majority the
[32:52] world even the jarda christians don't
[32:54] even understand this they can't even
[32:56] relate to it at all because they don't
[32:58] feel the way the bride feels about him
[33:01] but listen to this again I opened to my
[33:05] beloved but my beloved had withdrawn
[33:08] himself now notice she doesn't change
[33:10] her claim upon him as far as who he is
[33:15] she's still bride and he's still her
[33:17] beloved she's still elect she's still
[33:20] called and chosen she said open to my
[33:23] beloved and my beloved had withdrawn
[33:25] himself and was gone my soul failed when
[33:30] he spake I sought him but I could not
[33:34] find him I called him but he gave me no
[33:39] answer now we're going into the time of
[33:42] the silence into the time when before
[33:46] she could not take correction one thing
[33:48] I loved about the Lord he will always
[33:51] correct his children but not always when
[33:54] you've done the wrong you say God knows
[33:57] sometimes when we do wrong that we are
[34:00] so low and so despondent that we cannot
[34:04] take the measure of correction that we
[34:06] need right then so he'll kind of let you
[34:09] go for a little bit and wait till you
[34:10] get to feeling better then they'll turn
[34:12] you over and his knee and wear you out
[34:15] but that's still grace
[34:18] because it if people to wore you out
[34:20] maybe when you were so down it or drove
[34:22] you over the edge you tell them that
[34:24] love a man don't you appreciate his
[34:27] grace to us let's bow our heads tonight
[34:32] Heavenly Father we are grateful for such
[34:35] a wonderful loving father Lord Jesus we
[34:40] ask you tonight that you would come
[34:43] supernaturally take this word and speak
[34:47] to his father we are not ashamed to say
[34:50] that our needs are many but we are not
[34:53] also ashamed to say our God is greater
[34:56] than all the needs that we could muster
[34:58] up around the world if every individual
[35:02] in the face of the Earth's tonight
[35:03] billions and billions of people if every
[35:07] one of them had billions of needs and we
[35:09] would multiply the billions of people
[35:12] down the billions of needs and you would
[35:14] answer and take care of every one of
[35:16] them it would barely even touch your
[35:19] power so we know Lord your power is as
[35:23] great as it ever was your healing your
[35:26] deliverance all that you have all that
[35:28] you are so we pray to not follow that it
[35:31] should come and speak to us from your
[35:33] word help me that I can get out of the
[35:35] way and help the people that they can
[35:37] get out of the way Lord that we can be
[35:39] able to receive from You Lord Jesus were
[35:42] just asking that the presence of God
[35:44] would come and so arrest our thoughts as
[35:48] it were
[35:49] may we be so captivated by the presence
[35:52] of our loving Lord Jesus that will be
[35:55] changed people when we leave you tonight
[35:58] granted I pray Lord in Jesus name and
[36:01] the same said I'd like to say that
[36:06] someone's had a birthday today special
[36:10] person Harry
[36:22] I sent him a text this morning and said
[36:25] 55 and alive it can be seated god bless
[36:30] you
[36:31] the Lewis's having birthdays is much
[36:34] better than the other option so he does
[36:38] have a point on him I want to speak to
[36:42] you tonight from these verses of
[36:44] Scripture on I opened but he was gone I
[36:51] opened but he was gone it's amazing to
[36:58] me the element that remains the human
[37:02] element that remains despite the
[37:05] revelation of the supernatural birth
[37:08] that has taken place in the elect of God
[37:12] something so profound in the lives and
[37:16] the souls of the people of God that the
[37:20] scripture would call you and I a new
[37:23] creature in Christ Jesus a new creation
[37:26] a new being that's been made brand-new
[37:31] something that was not patched up
[37:34] something that wasn't kind of throw
[37:36] together new and old and wore out and
[37:38] this and that but totally transformed
[37:41] and made new and yet how could a person
[37:46] like that ever wind up refusing or
[37:50] turning down a personal call when the
[37:54] Lord Jesus would knock at our heart now
[37:58] this could be for a time of weeks this
[38:03] type of delay could be for months it
[38:07] could be for hours it could be for a day
[38:11] or so but whether it's for an hour or a
[38:16] day or a week or a month or a prolonged
[38:20] call the in result is going to be the
[38:25] same because every believer who has been
[38:30] germanized by the Spirit of God the
[38:34] beloved of
[38:35] their soul is Christ Jesus as a matter
[38:40] of fact he is the fairest of ten
[38:42] thousand to them he's he's everything
[38:44] but the truth of the matter is he is not
[38:47] everything to their body because their
[38:53] flesh still thirst after the things that
[38:57] satisfy the flesh now because God has
[39:02] made us this new creature this is what
[39:06] instills this ability to be able to love
[39:09] him like no other people can love it now
[39:13] I realize when I talk this way that it's
[39:16] not for everyone I don't want to say
[39:18] this but I've got to say it to be honest
[39:21] it's not for everybody in our church
[39:23] it's not even for everybody that says
[39:26] they believe God sent a prophet the kind
[39:29] of love that I want to bring to you
[39:31] tonight and tomorrow is only for the
[39:35] elect it is only for those who actually
[39:39] have become in rapture you see the
[39:44] rapture is not just an event but the
[39:48] rapture is a move a consummation of
[39:54] something that has already started in
[39:57] the lives of those who are already
[40:00] raptured those who have not had a
[40:04] rapture will not experience the rapture
[40:08] and those who have had a rapture will
[40:12] experience the rapture so if you're
[40:15] worried about missing the rapture don't
[40:17] worry about it no more if you've already
[40:19] been raptured in him now when I say that
[40:22] I'm not talking about just well I let
[40:24] aside this habit that habit I'm talking
[40:27] about your soul being so enraptured in
[40:31] the person of the Lord Jesus that you
[40:35] you are so moved by his being that there
[40:40] is absolutely nothing in this
[40:42] swirl that moves you like he does now
[40:46] I'm not saying that you don't enjoy
[40:47] things you go on a picnic and you do
[40:50] this and that in there that I'm talking
[40:51] about that but there is nothing that
[40:53] moves you like he does if there's any if
[40:57] Jesus has any rivals in your life you
[41:00] have not yet experienced a rapture
[41:04] that's right because if you ever do he
[41:07] has no competition there are no rivals
[41:11] to the soul once you are truly born
[41:15] again now watch this
[41:17] illusion here that that we have in the
[41:20] Song of Solomon is we looked at it's
[41:22] Sunday was that there was unlike this
[41:24] type of door lock on the latches on our
[41:27] door that it was actually as the term
[41:29] uses it was a latch and there was a hole
[41:32] in the door that would be either above
[41:35] or it beneath the latch which would go
[41:37] this way and beneath it would be a hole
[41:40] which only ahem size should be able to
[41:42] slip through and the person on the other
[41:45] side had the capability of locking this
[41:48] where it would not swing back and forth
[41:50] but the bride had at least left this
[41:53] part of it open so he runs his hand to
[41:57] the hole in the door and he moves a
[41:59] little thing over to the side and he
[42:01] reaches his hand through and when he
[42:03] does to raise the latch all but alas he
[42:07] finds that she has locked the latch
[42:09] itself so that his hand cannot be able
[42:13] to release his now remember they are
[42:15] married they are not courting they are
[42:18] not dating as we would say but they are
[42:21] married he has called her his sister his
[42:24] spouse his beloved she has already been
[42:27] been with him so they are married so
[42:30] what is she doing with a door locked
[42:33] against him anyway and you look at our
[42:35] lives especially in this latest seein
[42:38] time frame how the jobs in business and
[42:41] so many things can be M to lock the
[42:44] intimacy of the Lord Jesus out of our
[42:47] lives
[42:48] you you many of you never ever ever
[42:50] locked him out of your life when it
[42:53] comes to being Savior actually you have
[42:56] been saved not if you have locked him
[42:58] out there part if you've got the Holy
[42:59] Ghost don't get that in your mind that
[43:01] is what I'm talking about but notice
[43:03] where he's coming into he's not
[43:06] approaching her in the kitchen he's not
[43:09] approaching her in the living room he is
[43:13] approaching her in the bedroom where she
[43:16] is now retired and resting so here is
[43:20] the third room here is the Holy of
[43:23] Holies here is soma the most intimate
[43:27] place that he could find her and what he
[43:30] goes to finding her in the most intimate
[43:33] part of her being that is where she
[43:36] shuts him out she does not shut him out
[43:39] as being Savior all of well to see us
[43:43] Christians do not shut him out as far as
[43:46] being Savior because none of them want
[43:48] to be lost none of them want to go to
[43:50] hell so they do not shut him out of the
[43:53] kitchen many of them will shut him out
[43:55] when it comes to the living room because
[43:57] they don't want his uh you know its
[44:00] moves toward her and all of that but yet
[44:02] meaning it will go on and they will
[44:04] accept that but ultimately every one of
[44:07] them other than the elect will shut him
[44:09] out when it comes to the bedroom now the
[44:11] difference is that the bride in the
[44:14] beginning
[44:14] initially let him come into her but this
[44:18] is now actually they've already become
[44:20] married now most of you know if you've
[44:22] been say very long it's that day to day
[44:25] walk is where we slip up with God and
[44:28] Happy Valley said and the visitor said
[44:32] thank you visitors now that's the
[44:35] difficult part of our walk with God is
[44:38] being able to keep that fire burning
[44:41] that flame going that passion burning
[44:43] it's the same way with the marriage when
[44:45] a man and woman first get married if
[44:47] they've got any speck of love at all I'm
[44:49] sure they can live on love for a while
[44:51] and their lives but a day or two but
[44:53] outro wow you know you got a pancake
[44:55] and corn and means and taters and all
[44:57] the rest that sort of thing and then the
[44:59] man will start bolting in the door for
[45:01] his life and he'll stop doing those
[45:02] things that he done candy that's a thing
[45:05] of the past
[45:05] roses whoever heard of roses that you've
[45:07] been married for five or ten years
[45:09] so those things and then the woman will
[45:11] start reciprocating and pulling back
[45:13] from him the things that she did for him
[45:15] initially and that's what causes many
[45:18] marriages to suffer and it's the same
[45:20] way spiritually with the Lord Jesus that
[45:22] one were first saved on mine we love the
[45:25] Lord we love our Bible we love the tapes
[45:27] we love going to the house of God we
[45:29] love all those things but then answer
[45:31] while it becomes so awhile you know my
[45:34] goodness we've got church three times a
[45:36] week well on the world do I need to go
[45:38] all three times I mean why do I need to
[45:40] read my Bible every day and why do I
[45:42] need to do this and that and the other
[45:43] you don't have to know it's entirely up
[45:46] to you
[45:46] but it's up to you whether or not you
[45:48] want that intimate part that I'm talking
[45:50] about now if you want a Jesus that only
[45:53] meets you in the kitchen that's entirely
[45:54] up to you and he is a merciful God he
[45:57] will meet you in the kitchen if that's
[45:58] all you give him he will take that but
[46:01] for me on my house I don't want a
[46:03] kitchen Jesus I don't want just to live
[46:06] in rooms Jesus I want a whole house
[46:08] Jesus I don't want nothing in my closet
[46:11] I know one that's it in my bedroom
[46:13] nothing upstairs nothing in the basement
[46:15] I don't want nothing nowhere that Jesus
[46:18] can't feel welcome within my house right
[46:20] I want to be able to live for and answer
[46:23] them have every avenue of my life and I
[46:26] want him to be able to be intimate when
[46:28] I speak of that I mean by divine
[46:30] revelation of him pressing himself in my
[46:34] soul and entering into my soul with that
[46:37] mysterious part which only he contains
[46:40] now Satan has a certain element of the
[46:43] knowledge of salvation many of each
[46:44] preacher stand up and they'll preach it
[46:46] all the time but they never enter into
[46:49] the intimate part that the Lord Jesus
[46:51] reserves only for his queen and that is
[46:54] of course the elect of God now then this
[46:56] is the part that we want to look at the
[46:58] intimate part of our lives of us being
[47:01] Christian totally sold out to the Lord
[47:03] so in love
[47:04] the Lord Jesus that trials come trials
[47:07] go sickness calms sickness kills all
[47:09] kinds of things come and go but yet your
[47:11] soul is so tied in with God nothing
[47:13] moves you now your flesh may get where
[47:16] your spirit may get weary but down
[47:18] inside that so you have the tie posts
[47:21] and the anchor and you can no more
[47:23] perish than God Himself compares and the
[47:27] very design of sin has lets you you have
[47:30] no more desire to go out and commit
[47:32] adultery and run around and live the way
[47:34] you live because that old man is dead
[47:37] and you've got a new king living on the
[47:40] throne of your heart
[47:41] praise the Lord since now the illusion
[47:45] then that we want to look at is the
[47:47] intimacy of the daily wall that can
[47:50] become so difficult for us to keep now
[47:53] notice what she says in verse 6 I open
[47:56] to my beloved but my beloved had
[47:59] withdrawn himself now all of this is
[48:02] timed exactly right even in the Avenue
[48:05] by which he will now correct her now
[48:08] he's going to enjoy himself he may have
[48:10] heard a rise he may have heard the
[48:12] pitter-patter of her feet he may have
[48:14] heard exactly what was going on and he
[48:16] chooses this time even though it seems
[48:19] an opportune to her but he knows it is
[48:22] exactly the right time now she must feel
[48:25] the disciplinary action of her rejected
[48:28] husband now none of a slight discipline
[48:30] I know that but yet every one of us
[48:32] absolutely need it and if your son and
[48:35] daughter of God you'll accept it and say
[48:37] man thank you Lord for giving it to me
[48:38] if your bastard born you'll hate it and
[48:41] you'll like the preacher brings it to
[48:42] you praise the Lord now she says I
[48:46] opened to my beloved and that this is
[48:48] exactly what he desired this is what he
[48:51] wanted her to do but she missed the
[48:54] window or the timeframe by which he
[48:56] stood there now the His grace was there
[48:59] and maybe he knocked and she heard and
[49:01] she's kind of sweep in and out of sleep
[49:04] I remember she said that she'd went to
[49:05] sleep and it's like this is sort of like
[49:08] a dream so she's coming in and out and
[49:11] conscious you now we all whenever we're
[49:12] sleep and
[49:13] waking all of a sudden and we don't know
[49:15] where we are and so this is sort of the
[49:17] way she was that she was coming out of
[49:19] that unconscious or subconscious first
[49:22] conscious coming together her alertness
[49:24] is now coming but she's able to
[49:26] recognize and know that it's him so it's
[49:29] not actually said well who's there hello
[49:30] hello who's at the door who's at the
[49:32] door but there was enough signs and
[49:35] enough sense to let her know that it was
[49:37] him because she smelled the myrrh which
[49:40] was particular to him and she also
[49:43] smelled the fine myrrh which was
[49:45] dripping from his fingers which was also
[49:47] particular to him so it was not like
[49:49] she's lying I get away from my door I
[49:52] don't know who you are
[49:53] are you a burglar or you were safer your
[49:55] robber there's no question who was at
[49:58] the door so lets us know them that's
[50:00] there to gain entrance into her room
[50:02] into their room I should say that he had
[50:05] already had access into the house so she
[50:08] was not alarm she was not concerned I
[50:11] don't know who this is
[50:11] I'm hood yes but there were several
[50:13] things that let her know it was him all
[50:16] children I would to God we can look
[50:18] around and recognize it is here in our
[50:21] midst it is he that is keeping his elect
[50:24] and this in time all the signs are
[50:26] pointing to everything but I'm not just
[50:28] focusing out there although looking at
[50:30] the Supreme Court's ruling or looking at
[50:32] their earthquakes we're looking at all
[50:34] of this now the other but I'll tell what
[50:35] I'm looking at I'm looking for that hole
[50:37] in the door and I'm smelling that sweet
[50:40] smelling savor I smell the stench of
[50:43] Sodom but what I want to smell more than
[50:45] the stench of father I want to smell the
[50:48] more of my Lord Jesus I want to smell
[50:50] his presence being near me
[50:54] hey man Oh hallelujah now what she comes
[51:00] to the heartbreaking realization that
[51:04] her beloved had withdrawn himself this
[51:09] withdrawing is going to serve his
[51:13] purpose to chastise her for her soft
[51:17] fulness and I realize a lot of us want
[51:21] to have the conception and our mind that
[51:23] we can sing and do whatever we want to
[51:26] do then we ask God to forgive us God
[51:28] takes his blood and wipes it all clean
[51:31] and it's all said now but remember when
[51:34] you do wrong you sow seeds now God will
[51:39] forgive you but God ain't gonna go out
[51:41] there in your garden and dig up the
[51:43] seeds that you planted if you don't want
[51:45] no bad seats to be there don't so um oh
[51:50] my come on children don't get quiet on
[51:53] me now whenever we do wrong Abraham done
[51:56] wrong and Abraham paid what days are
[51:58] done wrong David paid come on and they
[52:01] were the elect of God when Peter done
[52:04] wrong Peter paid when you don't wrong
[52:06] you'll pay well God will forgive you
[52:08] that's right but forgiveness is a total
[52:10] different concept than reaping and
[52:13] sowing that is a law of God as well as
[52:16] the law of forgiveness and whenever we
[52:18] saw even though God forgiveness you know
[52:21] go out those I said and take all the
[52:22] seeds up out of the ground so the best
[52:24] thing that he was so good seeds let all
[52:27] them bad seeds rain on the devil now
[52:30] notice here she comes into this this
[52:33] time to where that she's happened she
[52:36] stirred herself and she's aroused and
[52:39] she's awakened and she's gone open the
[52:40] door and she find that her beloved house
[52:43] was drawn himself she said I opened to
[52:46] my beloved but my beloved had withdrawn
[52:48] himself and was gone now notice how that
[52:52] even the elect of God can turn down the
[52:56] intimacy of our Lord now he's not she's
[53:00] not lost she is not
[53:02] slid in the sensor back out in the world
[53:04] drinkin running around smoking
[53:06] cigarettes and all that sort of thing no
[53:08] she's not that but he simply was drawn
[53:11] himself from the position that he
[53:13] offered her because of her refusal and
[53:16] now she must enter into this time in her
[53:19] heart and in her soul to where she feels
[53:22] so bad because of what she done
[53:25] you know how blessed you are you
[53:27] understand how blessed you are in this
[53:30] age of reprobates that if you do
[53:32] something wrong or say something wrong
[53:35] or think something wrong you know how
[53:37] blessed you are to still feel bad for
[53:40] that do you realize we're living in a
[53:42] world when millions of people have been
[53:45] turned over to a reprobate mind to do
[53:48] those things which are abomination
[53:51] abomination the eyes of God and will
[53:53] bring damnation to their soul and they
[53:56] feel no wrong annoyance you realize how
[54:00] blessed we are tonight if we say one
[54:03] little same out of the way or if we
[54:05] raise our voices so whatever more and we
[54:08] feel so convicted in our heart you out
[54:11] of dance and shout when you still have
[54:14] conviction to know you are blessed of
[54:17] God that you don't have a reprobate mind
[54:20] reprobates don't feel bad about
[54:22] committing sin and abominations in the
[54:25] eyes of the Lord oh ma I want you to
[54:34] notice how she addresses this and she
[54:35] goes to the very core of the problem she
[54:39] says my soul failed my soul failed when
[54:48] he spake now what did he say open to me
[54:52] my sister my spouse my beloved now had
[54:59] she been in a dream totally unconscious
[55:02] she would have not been held accountable
[55:05] but there was enough about her there was
[55:08] conscience to know it was him so now
[55:11] she's
[55:11] looking back and realizing I've done
[55:14] wrong I was awake enough I knew better
[55:18] than to do this now this is the real
[55:23] breath the real body said well I'm elect
[55:26] I can do what I want to you sound like a
[55:28] reprobate I can sing I can do whatever I
[55:32] want God loves me so much he'll let me
[55:35] do it I don't want that kind of love
[55:36] from God myself I want the kind of life
[55:39] from God that if I do wrong he worries
[55:41] me l he forgives me and he wears me out
[55:45] and he corrects me you're crazy well I
[55:49] may be but that is scriptural it is
[55:53] bastard some illegitimate that he don't
[55:54] correct not sons now how sadly she
[55:58] recognizes that she has now slighted and
[56:02] neglected him I remember he's not
[56:04] divorcing her he's not putting her away
[56:06] nor is she going to be foolish enough to
[56:08] try to divorce self but what she's
[56:10] dealing with is recognizing the neglect
[56:13] then the glider she's been so busy with
[56:17] the things of life the things around her
[56:20] and the things of everyday business and
[56:23] jobs and this and that and the other and
[56:25] now she's dealing with the idea of her
[56:29] neglect was so severe that she never
[56:32] even comprehended it apparently before
[56:34] this thing is getting ahold to me it is
[56:37] changing me this thing that I think well
[56:39] I've got to do this and I've got to do
[56:41] that and I've got to go somewhere else
[56:43] God understands when I miss Church God
[56:45] understands that I can't pray God
[56:47] understands that I can't read my Bible
[56:49] no God don't God tells us in his words
[56:53] the things to get closer to God it's
[56:55] very simple read our Bible and pray how
[56:58] awful once a week every day oh look at
[57:03] her she says my soul failed when he
[57:06] spake now the very next step is I salt
[57:11] him don't you notice what she's now
[57:14] looking for
[57:15] it's the bridegroom himself which shows
[57:20] that she's moved beyond the Pentecostal
[57:22] age
[57:24] now we believe in gifts we believe in
[57:28] justification sanctification baptism of
[57:30] the Holy Ghost but now by the gym she's
[57:32] been allowed to enter into the bedroom
[57:34] she has been with him before in this
[57:38] room so now she is not seeking or look
[57:42] for tongues and a confounded
[57:44] and I look for miracles and I can find
[57:46] it but notice what she was seeking after
[57:49] I sought him look friends I love visions
[57:54] I love dreams all of tongues I had those
[57:57] experiences myself and I thank God for
[57:59] but I'll tell one thing I'm not
[58:01] searching that your gifts I want him I
[58:04] want him I want the person of the world
[58:09] by the road that will make his world
[58:11] what about the Donnie you've been safe
[58:13] for all these years and you say you've
[58:15] got the Holy Ghost how much more could
[58:16] you get how wonder how little that I
[58:19] understand I don't look at how much I've
[58:21] got and saying well how could I get any
[58:24] more but the more I comprehend about him
[58:26] the more it makes me understand how
[58:29] little I have and how much more there is
[58:32] for me to attain to and if you feel like
[58:35] you've got so much and you have no more
[58:38] question how much you do have it shows
[58:41] you have very very little if you feel
[58:45] like in this mortal life you have
[58:47] attained to such an awesome God
[58:52] Oh hallelujah
[58:55] oh my she says I saw him I saw him but I
[59:04] could not find him then it amazing when
[59:08] she realized she missed him
[59:10] she went to church Lord she's seeking
[59:19] him well let me ask you some now if you
[59:21] were satiny and you're seeking for Jesus
[59:24] would you go down to the bar tonight you
[59:28] want to go to the honky Tonk place of
[59:30] this place or there's prostitutes or
[59:32] some content would you go on down and
[59:34] didn't tell the madam whoever's in
[59:36] charge I'm looking for Jesus or you will
[59:38] find Jesus sir go to the bartender sir
[59:43] I'm looking for Jesus have you served in
[59:45] anything lately I'm looking for Jesus if
[59:47] you're looking for Jesus you've got a
[59:49] word and go where Jesus is now God can
[59:52] save people in a bar we know God can do
[59:54] all that sort of sight but Jesus doesn't
[59:56] frequent bar rooms come on Church Jesus
[1:00:01] is why he said whether there are two or
[1:00:04] three gathered together in my name which
[1:00:06] leaves out the prostitute house which
[1:00:09] leaves out the barroom works leaves out
[1:00:10] the honky Tonk which leaves out most of
[1:00:13] the places of entertainment the people
[1:00:15] like to go to on Saturday night but
[1:00:18] Jesus said whether that's two or three
[1:00:20] gathered together in my name I will be
[1:00:24] in their midst
[1:00:26] so if she saw them a little she had to
[1:00:30] know where to find him would she go
[1:00:31] church house of God under the Ministry
[1:00:35] of the word to find him
[1:00:38] even if you're not where you need to be
[1:00:42] with an ID but God or you love shout
[1:00:44] that into the place and your walk with
[1:00:46] God you have come to the right place
[1:00:49] [Applause]
[1:00:52] it's not special cuz we're here that's
[1:00:55] special cause he's here all glory he was
[1:01:03] draws now she's awake she's fully
[1:01:07] conscious
[1:01:08] she needs correction she can now
[1:01:12] appreciate and accept discipline if he
[1:01:17] would have ministered this beforehand it
[1:01:21] would have been so discourage
[1:01:22] discouraging to her a matter for the
[1:01:25] handler many times you may look at the
[1:01:28] church and you look and he says
[1:01:29] situational anything wonder why brother
[1:01:31] Donna you doing this I wonder why
[1:01:32] brother don't eat doing that we see many
[1:01:34] times as a shepherd there's things I
[1:01:36] know about the situation that you don't
[1:01:38] know and if I administer the correction
[1:01:41] that is needed at the time you think it
[1:01:43] needs to be it'll push that individual
[1:01:45] right out them church doors and if I
[1:01:47] wait for God to give me the right time
[1:01:49] then it'll be exactly what it's supposed
[1:01:51] to be look at him I know sir he does you
[1:01:54] the same way why would you have a
[1:01:55] problem of him doing somebody else up
[1:01:56] there how many times have we been so
[1:01:59] down and basically we needed a rebuke
[1:02:01] but instead of a review we got loving
[1:02:04] arms around us we got loving arms foot
[1:02:07] around us from the Lord what's he doing
[1:02:09] now does that mean you're not going to
[1:02:10] get to rebuke no he's gonna hurt you
[1:02:12] were you well heaven then he's gonna
[1:02:14] wear you out now once what happens to
[1:02:20] her you know it's amazing that whenever
[1:02:21] we get in trouble the things that happen
[1:02:24] now this set that we're fixing to read
[1:02:25] it's absolutely self-inflicted the
[1:02:28] watchman that what about the city found
[1:02:30] me they smoked me they wounded me the
[1:02:35] keepers of the walls took away my veil
[1:02:38] from me every step of verse seven his
[1:02:46] self inflicted
[1:02:49] she's not being beaten for the glory of
[1:02:52] God
[1:02:52] she's not suffering for the glory of God
[1:02:54] all of this is really gonna add your
[1:02:56] testimony is it she's making her
[1:03:00] testimony her testimony to say what God
[1:03:04] don't need verse seven in our life to
[1:03:07] make her testimony we are reaping when
[1:03:10] we lived here for seven friends oh
[1:03:12] you're getting quiet on me again
[1:03:14] was it God orchestrating this in her
[1:03:18] life
[1:03:18] absolutely not this makes me sick when I
[1:03:21] hear people in their disobedience and
[1:03:23] they quit playing quit going to church
[1:03:25] put read in the Bible get away from God
[1:03:27] and get to life an office mess ever was
[1:03:29] well god let me go don't you blame that
[1:03:31] on my daddy
[1:03:33] she cannot blame their songs on father
[1:03:36] and say well God must have ordained that
[1:03:39] God never ordained her to be treated
[1:03:41] this way she done this herself I've had
[1:03:48] a lot of verse sevens in my life and
[1:03:50] I'll go ahead and said for most of you
[1:03:52] most of us had a lot of verse sevens in
[1:03:54] your life we don't like to brag about it
[1:03:57] we're ashamed of it which is good I'm
[1:03:59] glad we are ashamed because that means
[1:04:01] that we receive the correction and we
[1:04:03] recognize you know what we didn't have
[1:04:05] to have that in our life many of the
[1:04:07] things that some of you are going
[1:04:09] through even to this day it's because
[1:04:11] you brought it on yourself you fail to
[1:04:15] respond to him when he knocked on your
[1:04:17] hearts door maybe the Lord in order to
[1:04:19] Vincent preached or your pastor whoever
[1:04:20] and warns you about a certain thing
[1:04:22] don't do this and don't do that you kept
[1:04:25] right on going over the top of it anyhow
[1:04:27] and then listen and sitting here to pay
[1:04:29] into this day because of your neglect oh
[1:04:33] my remember the darling
[1:04:35] paying for your slothfulness but listen
[1:04:37] to me just because you disobey don't
[1:04:41] mean you're not bribed just because you
[1:04:43] get in verse 7 don't mean you're not a
[1:04:46] left
[1:04:46] is another verse that perceived all
[1:04:49] hallelujah that's what I want to keep on
[1:04:52] churning
[1:04:52] if I fail and I go through first seven
[1:04:55] and I go through verse eight I'm on my
[1:04:57] way on down I will not be stopped by my
[1:05:01] own failures I want you to notice where
[1:05:13] she goes she goes to the city
[1:05:19] what you doing in the city Brad what are
[1:05:23] you doing looking for him out there you
[1:05:27] ought to know where to find him at you
[1:05:29] ought to know where to find him go to
[1:05:30] his house now don't you notice how this
[1:05:35] reads the watchman that went about the
[1:05:38] city found them now there was two types
[1:05:42] of watchmen in the ancient cities and
[1:05:46] one of them was the ones that went about
[1:05:50] the city walking around going around
[1:05:52] from gate to gate and they was not
[1:05:54] posted in any particular place so they
[1:05:57] would go about and just check what was
[1:05:59] going on the streets the alleys the
[1:06:01] entrance to the gates and just watching
[1:06:03] for anything going on and then there was
[1:06:05] another set of watchmen which would be
[1:06:07] posted to a particular post they would
[1:06:10] watch that post and they might walk back
[1:06:12] and forth but it's a very small limited
[1:06:14] area so here she is she goes out and she
[1:06:17] begins to move over let's say she visits
[1:06:19] a soccer game first and then she goes
[1:06:21] through then she goes to a basketball
[1:06:23] game and then she goes over here and
[1:06:24] there now now I'm not saying those
[1:06:25] things are wrong with himself but it's
[1:06:27] what you can make out of them it's a
[1:06:30] basketball game wrong well no I wouldn't
[1:06:32] say the basketball game within itself is
[1:06:34] wrong unless you become intoxicated with
[1:06:36] basketball then if you become
[1:06:38] intoxicated with and it becomes your God
[1:06:41] then it's a beggar God than the Lord
[1:06:42] Jesus amen brother Donnie fishing
[1:06:46] anything else can become exactly the
[1:06:48] same way so what is she doing now now
[1:06:51] she's entering into the disciplinary
[1:06:53] action that God did not orchestrate but
[1:06:57] God did allow God never our doing this
[1:07:00] god never predestinated this God never
[1:07:03] even wounded it oh ma
[1:07:09] so the watzmann that went about the city
[1:07:13] found there they smoked me so they're
[1:07:19] taking her first streetwalker decent
[1:07:24] women should be in the bid that this
[1:07:27] time what are you doing woman out
[1:07:31] walking around you're looking for
[1:07:33] business now can you imagine the slurs
[1:07:40] and the things that they must have said
[1:07:43] to her can you think in your heart how
[1:07:47] you would have felt if you would have
[1:07:49] been called some of those dirty filthy
[1:07:52] names yes that's not who you were at all
[1:07:55] but that's the image that you were
[1:07:57] projecting you should have been in home
[1:08:02] and bad you shouldn't be out there
[1:08:03] walking around when the street
[1:08:05] prostitutes is out looking for me in
[1:08:06] come on children look at the identity
[1:08:09] that she brought on herself and when we
[1:08:12] become so called up of the world and the
[1:08:14] things of the world and we're bringing
[1:08:16] that identity upon ourselves and then
[1:08:19] people look at you are you a Christian
[1:08:21] or you say do you believe this do you
[1:08:23] believe that oh I can't believe well
[1:08:25] what do you expect if you're Akhtar
[1:08:27] Walter and what the Hobbs if somebody
[1:08:29] thinks you're one I'll tell one thing
[1:08:33] even if you get mad on angel's wings
[1:08:36] that's gonna be hard to tell them from
[1:08:37] an old pig snout
[1:08:41] [Music]
[1:08:43] and all bad on old Bassem bird I'll tell
[1:08:47] you once they get harder swings eagle's
[1:08:49] wings angel's wings you don't sit out
[1:08:52] down it's gonna be really hard that's
[1:08:53] why we need to keep ourselves from all
[1:08:56] this filth out here Laodicea not only
[1:09:01] keep ourselves from it but keep
[1:09:02] ourselves from bringing it inside our
[1:09:04] own church oh ma
[1:09:09] she said the watzmann that what about
[1:09:12] the city found me they smoked me they
[1:09:16] wounded me the keepers of the walls and
[1:09:20] here's the second category of watzmann
[1:09:23] now she gets away for these guys the
[1:09:27] ones who's walked him about now your she
[1:09:30] comes she's been hit meat kit blood all
[1:09:35] over stomped and they finally let her go
[1:09:40] and when they do she makes it over to
[1:09:44] these guys that are assigned a certain
[1:09:46] post and they look at him said what are
[1:09:49] you doing I got a woman you
[1:09:51] streetwalkers we don't allow this in our
[1:09:53] city you get back to your house you
[1:09:57] lowdown sorry say you're not set to kill
[1:10:01] that was not the truth but but the way
[1:10:05] she acted they mistook her for a legacy
[1:10:11] in church member
[1:10:19] hallelujah now watch he says the keepers
[1:10:26] of the wall they took away my veil from
[1:10:31] now the other men that alive can make
[1:10:34] fun of her and ridicule so what are you
[1:10:36] doing with the veil you're kinda long
[1:10:39] veil oh but I'm clean I'm pure sure you
[1:10:46] are that's why you're out here this time
[1:10:48] of the morning sure you are that's why
[1:10:56] you're here walking around looking for
[1:10:58] some man are you looking for some man
[1:11:00] well yes I am say no but simply shut up
[1:11:09] but these first Watchmen lift her veil
[1:11:12] so she comes up to the guys who go back
[1:11:15] and forth on the walls
[1:11:17] she said the keepers of the walls took
[1:11:21] away my veil the veil was the ornament
[1:11:27] of her gender being a woman
[1:11:31] being a pure woman now harlots wore
[1:11:35] veils but they were known by their veil
[1:11:38] as well they wore a particular type of
[1:11:41] veil remember Tamar whenever she takes
[1:11:45] out for certain clothes and then she
[1:11:46] veils herself in Canaanite dress but
[1:11:49] there was a certain type of veil that
[1:11:52] the prostitutes used to make themselves
[1:11:55] more seductive and to make themselves
[1:11:57] more alluring and they would hide their
[1:11:59] eyes in a certain way and they would
[1:12:01] paint their eyes in a certain way
[1:12:03] and they would take stimulants and make
[1:12:07] the eye look real real big which the
[1:12:09] Canaanites thought was very beautiful so
[1:12:12] they would make the eyes look really
[1:12:14] really large then they would be said in
[1:12:15] the white most of them with dark eyes
[1:12:17] and
[1:12:18] the wide around the eyeball and it would
[1:12:20] make the eye look real alluring so they
[1:12:23] leave her veil but when she comes up to
[1:12:26] these men they actually take her veil
[1:12:29] what's what did she get the veil she got
[1:12:32] it from her beloved she got it from her
[1:12:35] beloved it was him who gave her that
[1:12:38] veil and they took it away because he
[1:12:40] was letting her go through a trial
[1:12:42] because he was letting her go through a
[1:12:44] test every bit of this is self-inflicted
[1:12:47] oh ma I know this type of person will
[1:12:55] make us happy but hope he'll make us
[1:12:56] ready
[1:12:58] this veil was a badge of her modesty now
[1:13:05] when they take that badge away from her
[1:13:07] look in Genesis 24 65 for she had said
[1:13:10] unto the servant what man is this that
[1:13:12] woke us in the Fila this is Rebekah that
[1:13:15] walketh in the field to meet us and the
[1:13:17] servant had said it is my master
[1:13:19] therefore she took a veil and covered
[1:13:22] herself now in the presence of Eliezer
[1:13:25] on this camel train going back she did
[1:13:28] not feel like she needed it but she's
[1:13:29] gonna come into the presence of the man
[1:13:32] that she's going to marry so she takes
[1:13:34] her veil and covers herself she will
[1:13:37] wear this veil of course in his presence
[1:13:40] they will go into the marriage tent he
[1:13:42] was in remove the veil showing that she
[1:13:45] has moved underneath his headship then
[1:13:49] he would take that veil and let over on
[1:13:51] his shoulder and show by a sign that he
[1:13:53] assumed full responsibility of that
[1:13:56] woman so she kept herself from other men
[1:13:59] not being touched by other men and the
[1:14:01] outward show was her closing amen and
[1:14:04] the album identity was a certain type of
[1:14:07] a veil which an unmarried
[1:14:10] had praise be to God tell me tell me why
[1:14:14] is it in the animal kingdom or the bird
[1:14:17] Kingdom amphibian kingdom or reptile
[1:14:20] kingdom tell me why there is no female
[1:14:23] among them that has the little virgin
[1:14:25] veil tell me why it is only in the human
[1:14:28] race tell me why it's in the human race
[1:14:33] God please sit there for that sacred
[1:14:36] trust
[1:14:37] hallelujah and listen little bride the
[1:14:39] Lord Jesus has watched you and cleanse
[1:14:42] you and sanctifies you and given you a
[1:14:45] veil of his protection of the word don't
[1:14:48] you get out here in the world don't you
[1:14:50] get out your mom the lettuce in watts
[1:14:52] keepers and watchtower man and let them
[1:14:55] steal your modesty away from you and
[1:14:58] steal that for charity what's Christ
[1:15:00] Jesus restores you to
[1:15:02] [Applause]
[1:15:09] so they tear the veil off Wow so the
[1:15:20] veil wrapped around their hair and their
[1:15:23] face they want to know who are these
[1:15:28] people they probably already know us but
[1:15:36] I figure they're gonna find this out a
[1:15:37] little bit more clear as we go on
[1:15:39] they passed a few more laws of this and
[1:15:42] that and the other make us breaking the
[1:15:44] law because we won't accept what society
[1:15:46] says what society has identified as
[1:15:49] marriage I'll tell you one thing I'll
[1:15:50] marry any gay couple in the world in the
[1:15:54] entire world if you can show me where
[1:15:57] God ever married case
[1:16:01] show me what God said they should be
[1:16:04] married fine show me what the Word of
[1:16:08] God gives any outline how a woman should
[1:16:11] treat her life show me any outline in
[1:16:15] the scripture how a man should treat his
[1:16:17] husband I know one thing that was one
[1:16:21] wedding that my father cut him that my
[1:16:24] father did he did it in the Garden of
[1:16:26] Eden a wasn't to women and wasn't to men
[1:16:29] it was a man and a woman that's the only
[1:16:32] one that we know of in history that he
[1:16:34] ever done he gave us that example
[1:16:37] because that's the right example show me
[1:16:40] work
[1:16:41] native of almería to
[1:16:43] [Applause]
[1:16:50] well you say that cause you're a
[1:16:52] religious fanatic and if you don't
[1:16:53] believe it's your devil fanatic
[1:16:55] I'm a fan for Jesus in these words
[1:16:58] you're a fan for the devil praise the
[1:17:06] Lord and get my virgin veil and get me
[1:17:10] to comprehend I'm gonna bury my head
[1:17:12] under the sand I don't care what laws
[1:17:14] they pass I don't care what they try to
[1:17:16] do to us whenever they go to pressing
[1:17:17] against you you remember no prophets
[1:17:19] that they'll come against her and
[1:17:21] they'll try to shut her out but they'll
[1:17:22] never shut her up
[1:17:24] he'll take her up so go ahead Sodom
[1:17:27] press against us God precedence
[1:17:31] it means our body changes right at the
[1:17:34] door it means our body
[1:17:42] friends this is why we need to make sure
[1:17:46] everything that's right in our lives
[1:17:48] oh ma now watch her here she staggers
[1:18:01] back out and she runs into some more
[1:18:07] people were st. I charge you o daughters
[1:18:14] of Jerusalem if you find my beloved that
[1:18:21] you tell him I'm sick of love now look
[1:18:28] how low she is she is so low she's
[1:18:33] looking to people beneath her to try to
[1:18:36] find help they've never even known the
[1:18:44] king the way she has
[1:18:46] but now she's so low that she's looking
[1:18:50] beneath her own integrity and her own
[1:18:53] character I say you shouldn't go to a
[1:18:59] Pentecostal church or a Baptist Church
[1:19:00] no God no you want to go go right ahead
[1:19:03] but to think that them folks have the
[1:19:05] message of the hour
[1:19:09] I charge you old daughters of Jerusalem
[1:19:13] if you find my beloved now notice she
[1:19:19] still does not make him their beloved
[1:19:22] notice noise she said I told you those
[1:19:24] are Jerusalem if you find your beloved
[1:19:26] but if you find marble so they're gonna
[1:19:30] find him before you do and they're gonna
[1:19:34] tell him your need when they don't even
[1:19:37] understand him the way you understand it
[1:19:40] when you do wrong you need to come back
[1:19:43] the right way come on children and the
[1:19:47] way of divine approach is still God's
[1:19:51] nature remember the Prophet tells us the
[1:19:54] word interpreted is the manifestation of
[1:19:57] the name of God the word interpreted is
[1:20:01] the manifestation of the name of God so
[1:20:05] in order to make reconciliation and to
[1:20:07] come back to the divine approach we've
[1:20:09] got to come back through the way that
[1:20:11] God has let us come through so if you
[1:20:14] fall from this element of light how can
[1:20:17] you ever go back down to this degree of
[1:20:19] light and try to find him up here and
[1:20:22] you down there come back to where you
[1:20:24] left him at now notice she says tell him
[1:20:31] that I am sick of love now the English
[1:20:36] the way this words and it seems as if
[1:20:38] though she's saying I'm sick of your
[1:20:39] love I don't know more of it but
[1:20:40] actually what she's saying is I'm sick
[1:20:42] because I don't have it I'm sick not
[1:20:47] because I've had so much but I'm sick
[1:20:52] because I'm missing it you realize the
[1:20:56] elect are never perfectly at ease except
[1:21:01] in the presence of the king
[1:21:07] this is why whether you're at home
[1:21:09] praying reading your Bible on the job or
[1:21:12] in mainly in church cause more licks to
[1:21:14] the far gather together that's why there
[1:21:17] can be such a calm that enters into our
[1:21:21] souls that is beyond explanation there
[1:21:25] can be such a rest
[1:21:27] such a satisfaction I mean those who I'm
[1:21:29] talking about why because you come into
[1:21:32] the courts of the King and do you have
[1:21:35] an element of that home certainly you do
[1:21:37] but look at how many more licks afar you
[1:21:39] have gathered here on this place to not
[1:21:40] to just you by yourself or me by myself
[1:21:43] so as we enter into the nearness of the
[1:21:46] king the Bliss of heaven begins to
[1:21:49] emanate from His divine presence and
[1:21:52] that divine presence is there - what it
[1:21:55] is the bread of his face which is
[1:21:58] pawneean which is the very character of
[1:22:00] God so on his prey his face phrase comes
[1:22:03] through his manifestation as she says
[1:22:05] and behold his cheeks and she said his
[1:22:08] cheeks is as the bear of flowers and
[1:22:11] spices because the cheeks protruding out
[1:22:13] from the face and the face representing
[1:22:15] his divine presence and because of that
[1:22:18] why brings that something inside of us I
[1:22:21] don't care how much you love fishing how
[1:22:23] much you love hunting everything else
[1:22:25] nothing else can ever produce that kind
[1:22:28] of satisfaction in your soul it's
[1:22:31] totally impossible aren't you glad you
[1:22:33] know that's the truth you see the nearer
[1:22:37] to him that we get the nearer we enter
[1:22:40] into the calm of heaven and the peace of
[1:22:45] heaven and the Bliss of heaven oh praise
[1:22:50] God no wonder when I get in his presence
[1:22:51] I don't care if I ever leave or not I
[1:22:54] know some of y'all are excited in the
[1:22:56] service you want to go eat you want to
[1:22:57] go to Dairy Queen let me tell you one
[1:22:58] thing I dismiss early for your sakes I
[1:23:03] said here Wednesday night I took a fall
[1:23:05] Wednesday morning couldn't even we
[1:23:06] couldn't even walk laid on my driveway
[1:23:08] my back busted all up
[1:23:10] I didn't think off the Lord Jesus please
[1:23:11] help now stretch it winds I thought Lord
[1:23:13] if I can get it on I'll be all right
[1:23:15] there anointing come down I felt like a
[1:23:17] sixteen year old boy
[1:23:18] I wouldn't care if would stay here till
[1:23:20] midnight because I knew when that
[1:23:22] anointing left me left he unless he
[1:23:24] healed me I was going to be crippling
[1:23:25] back there sure enough I was after
[1:23:27] church there's something about being in
[1:23:29] his presence there's something about
[1:23:31] being in the saints of God that's a
[1:23:33] wonderful my minister but all brother
[1:23:35] system when we get in the presence of
[1:23:36] the King it changes everything it turns
[1:23:40] around our thoughts it eradicate things
[1:23:42] sister always may return the troubles
[1:23:44] may come back but my how that belief
[1:23:46] sister hmm what's this they're looking
[1:23:54] person now the daughters of Jerusalem
[1:23:59] they actually recognize they don't have
[1:24:02] the bride's place and they ask earnest
[1:24:07] she asked them said if you see my
[1:24:09] brother tell him that I'm sick of love
[1:24:10] and telling that I'm wanting him when I
[1:24:12] need him so bad and then the dollars of
[1:24:15] Joseph turned back around a verse 9 and
[1:24:17] say what is that beloved more than
[1:24:21] another beloved now what you notice the
[1:24:27] way they view it they view it that Jesus
[1:24:31] is not the only beloved Lord here we
[1:24:40] separate the bride from the church
[1:24:45] now they do they do acknowledge and
[1:24:49] recognize that she is different from
[1:24:51] them and they say what is cyber the not
[1:24:56] our not our that we shared joint feeling
[1:24:59] a joint communion with them but what is
[1:25:01] your beloved more than any other beloved
[1:25:04] as if though Jesus is one among three or
[1:25:06] one among many but to the bride he's not
[1:25:13] one of three he's all three and one
[1:25:16] [Laughter]
[1:25:19] you see everybody has a beloved or more
[1:25:25] than one but everybody has at least one
[1:25:29] thing in your life that is your beloved
[1:25:33] it can be your car it can be you your
[1:25:38] soul a high opinionated so
[1:25:40] self-opinionated you always express
[1:25:42] everything I me me me my my mind will
[1:25:45] most most more than likely your beloved
[1:25:47] is yourself some function beloved is at
[1:25:50] work it's the house it's their job that
[1:25:52] you know can be many many things and the
[1:25:54] daughters of Jerusalem recognize that
[1:25:57] Jesus is a beloved but that he's not the
[1:26:00] only beloved but they know I'm talking
[1:26:02] to her she's already weird and strange
[1:26:04] anyway so they're asking her why is he
[1:26:07] so much more than everything else to you
[1:26:16] yes sir my brother's sister she has not
[1:26:19] yet entered into his presence but the
[1:26:22] culmination of restoration is right on
[1:26:26] the verge of her own mouth she is going
[1:26:30] to talk her way right into restoration
[1:26:34] and that position is in Lord of Mercy
[1:26:37] she's gonna walk right back into his
[1:26:40] presence of chapter 6 verse 1 and how
[1:26:43] she gonna do it
[1:26:44] he's gonna bless her way right out of
[1:26:47] trouble she's gonna blow us all away
[1:26:49] right out of the valley that she's in
[1:26:51] and how she gonna do it Lord gave me a
[1:26:53] new Cadillac Lord gave me a new her BMW
[1:26:55] Lord give me this she is gonna bless his
[1:26:58] name right out of failure
[1:27:00] she is gonna bless his name right out of
[1:27:03] disappointment she's gonna praise her
[1:27:05] way right out of this trial not talking
[1:27:09] about how great she is or how great the
[1:27:11] preacher is but she's gonna talk about
[1:27:14] jesus himself and she's gonna walk right
[1:27:17] out of it by bragging on her beloved now
[1:27:34] tell one thing unless you want a sermon
[1:27:37] don't ask the bride this question what
[1:27:41] is thy beloved more that another bit of
[1:27:45] it
[1:27:47] thou fairest what is a beloved more than
[1:27:54] another beloved notice they emphasize it
[1:27:57] twice you're asking for now daughters of

[1:32:09] enough they're gone in two three days
[1:32:10] you think oh you're gonna hold on to
[1:32:12] them as long as you can't go Sue's you
[1:32:13] break em they're gone and you say oh
[1:32:15] that will build over roll their mouths
[1:32:18] back at you all
[1:32:22] I'll be out of there affording them done
[1:32:24] that to me
[1:32:28] Wow
[1:32:30] it's dead then why would I want to
[1:32:34] commit my life to something that could
[1:32:37] not love me they cannot help me if money
[1:32:42] should satisfy and fame and fortune that
[1:32:44] not these millionaires and rock stars
[1:32:47] and famous movie stars and these people
[1:32:48] that commit suicide and take their life
[1:32:50] that makes them sense if fame and
[1:32:52] fortune and riches for the mic and all
[1:32:54] that satisfies a person they should
[1:32:55] never they should live forever never
[1:32:57] never never never they should be the
[1:32:58] happiest people in the world they should
[1:33:00] open colleges for happiness and they
[1:33:02] should open all kinds of things to be
[1:33:04] able to teach people but they themself
[1:33:05] are looking for something why what they
[1:33:07] have made their beloved cannot smile
[1:33:10] back at them and when they come off the
[1:33:11] stage and they have to have something to
[1:33:13] shoot them up and something to shoot
[1:33:15] them down
[1:33:15] and they've got to have more money and
[1:33:17] more that's another why because their
[1:33:19] beloved could not die for them their
[1:33:21] beloved cannot heal them when they're
[1:33:23] sick their beloved cannot reach down and
[1:33:25] take a hold of an old Depression spirit
[1:33:27] and drive it away from them it'll only
[1:33:29] make more but sure but if one is your
[1:33:32] beloved more than money
[1:33:34] what is your beloved more than science
[1:33:38] because science will scientifically
[1:33:41] prove something this week and then if
[1:33:43] time Terry's in ten years have come back
[1:33:45] and said all we was wrong we
[1:33:47] scientifically disproved that theory so
[1:33:51] I guess I lost my beloved with a new
[1:33:53] scientific experiment in a laboratory
[1:33:56] come on
[1:33:57] and your favorite music oh my that you
[1:34:00] just love so much whatever it is that
[1:34:02] you make your beloved that's dead
[1:34:07] so I askew us are colossal so you tell
[1:34:12] me what is your benefit more than Jack
[1:34:17] Daniels
[1:34:18] what is your beloved more than pills and
[1:34:23] marijuana and politics because marijuana
[1:34:29] pills and politics can make you say
[1:34:35] [Music]
[1:34:37] because you take your pills and then you
[1:34:39] come down and then you got to have them
[1:34:40] over the next day and more the next day
[1:34:42] smoke your marijuana or it may take you
[1:34:44] out somewhere and produce all kinds of
[1:34:46] elucidation and when you come back you
[1:34:47] got to have more if you got more peace
[1:34:49] in what you had you're worse off than
[1:34:51] you was so your beloved is dead
[1:34:56] hallelujah but what is my beloved I do
[1:35:01] never the Prince of Peace the giver of
[1:35:06] life the forgiver of sins the partner of

[1:35:19] about you know that preacher you ain't
[1:35:20] never smoked marijuana you're out of

[1:40:42] to church three times a week and only
[1:40:43] choose to come once that shows you're
[1:40:44] not ready for the rapture because you
[1:40:47] are putting what you think above what
[1:40:48] God said God said forsake not the
[1:40:50] assembling of yourselves together and
[1:40:51] that much more as we see the Day

[1:43:46] people it can be five years ten fifteen
[1:43:49] before they ever gets surrendered you

[1:45:11] God is magnifying his person and
[1:45:13] belittling job's trial but when you make
[1:45:17] your problem bigger than your God you're
[1:45:19] in a mess of trouble and then Jobe
[1:45:23] finally got up to a spot and he said I
[1:45:25] have heard of thee with a hearing of the
[1:45:27] ear but now - easy
[1:45:37] recognizing God and speaker than your
[1:45:39] problem God is bigger than the mass your
[1:45:43] daughter's in or the mass your son is in
[1:45:46] he's bigger than the mass your finances
[1:45:49] are in if you can only trust me
[1:45:51] [Applause]
[1:45:58] sprite together I found this to be such
[1:46:03] a paradox in verse nine that the
[1:46:04] daughters of Jerusalem saw a beauty in
[1:46:08] the bride that was overwhelming to them
[1:46:13] but yes she didn't see it in herself as
[1:46:16] a matter of fact she said about herself
[1:46:17] I am black the son found upon me this
[1:46:23] that the other but they looked at her
[1:46:26] and called her the fairest among women
[1:46:29] now here she's mr. time of fellowship
[1:46:32] but she hasn't missed who she is
[1:46:35] children may you realize temporary
[1:46:38] setbacks don't identify who you are
[1:46:42] glory to God glory to God you are who
[1:46:48] you are from your soul not from your
[1:46:51] failures and would like to be remembered
[1:46:56] before the Lord tonight you may say
[1:46:59] about yourself I'm black but comely I
[1:47:02] miss God I fell short of the glory of
[1:47:05] God brother Donnie what can I do do the
[1:47:09] talk on Matty go to talking about him
[1:47:13] and let let your sub-conscience the man
[1:47:15] in the engine-room
[1:47:16] let him hear what you really think when
[1:47:21] the devil says he nothing - you ain't
[1:47:23] that's not another you ain't bribed you
[1:47:24] ain't this and that why don't you let
[1:47:26] that man down there go to lining up of
[1:47:28] that word a man and hear yourself
[1:47:32] speaking it he's the living of my
[1:47:35] phallus I know you've read Psalms 23
[1:47:38] many of us since she was a child
[1:47:40] let me quote it to you tonight the Lord
[1:47:43] is my shepherd
[1:47:47] and I shall not want he maketh me to lie
[1:47:53] down in green pastures he leadeth me
[1:47:56] beside the still waters
[1:47:59] Psalms 23 this feel was a personal
[1:48:02] revelation of the shepherd and you as an
[1:48:08] individual sheep many many years ago a
[1:48:11] great man stood before thousands and
[1:48:14] thousands of people and he stands and
[1:48:16] they asked him to quote Psalms 23 he's a
[1:48:20] great orator he stands there with a
[1:48:22] great eloquence of a great speaker and
[1:48:25] he quotes Psalms 23 and my ever half and
[1:48:29] every now and every pronoun every verb
[1:48:32] every adjective was exactly right then
[1:48:35] they asked an old preacher to get up the
[1:48:39] old preacher didn't hardly say it quite
[1:48:41] as well but when the old preacher got
[1:48:43] done thousands of people in the
[1:48:46] auditorium will weep in the orator still
[1:48:49] that back to the preacher sat down and
[1:48:50] said now the difference ladies and
[1:48:53] gentlemen was I was quoting what I read
[1:48:56] he was quoting what he knew by heart and
[1:48:59] by experience that's the way I want to
[1:49:09] call this word don't you and so I want
[1:49:11] to call it again not by memorization not
[1:49:13] just my memory calling it up but I want
[1:49:16] to call it by experience knowing he is
[1:49:18] my shepherd it was pray together
[1:49:21] Heavenly Father I pray you'd look at
[1:49:25] every heart and this building tonight
[1:49:29] those that have streamed or those that
[1:49:31] will archive Lord God we say we're sorry
[1:49:38] how many times have you knocked in her
[1:49:41] bedroom door and we've made flimsy
[1:49:44] excuses I've took off my coat shall I
[1:49:47] put it on again have washed my feet
[1:49:51] shall I get them dirty again what
[1:49:54] excuses to give to the king of King
[1:49:58] forgive us Lord but your mercy is so
[1:50:03] bountiful and their renewed every
[1:50:07] morning Lord Jesus may you search every
[1:50:11] heart may you begin with me to that Lord

[1:50:18] that's displeasing to him my life is
[1:50:23] open before you search me

[1:50:29] secret doors that you're not allowed to
[1:50:32] enter to I want you to come through

[1:51:08] hear you knocking on the door maybe

[1:51:13] tremendous battle will say Lord it just

[1:51:29] because if you've come to awake us
[1:51:33] you've not come to take from us no doubt
[1:51:36] you'll give us something that'll help us
[1:51:38] through the rest of the long weary night
[1:51:43] hallelujah Lord Jesus may you minister
[1:51:47] to every soul according to their need
[1:51:50] Lord God hallelujah oh my beloved Lord
[1:51:58] we want to do is I read today where
[1:52:00] brother Branham said there in 1957 he
[1:52:03] said I want my heart to be as the Song
[1:52:06] of Solomon where he said
[1:52:09] kiss the son lest he be angry he said no
[1:52:12] what you just want to kiss him tonight
[1:52:14] don't you want to kiss the son he said
[1:52:17] when he said her little lips looks like
[1:52:20] to do and he said you take your lover
[1:52:23] the Lord Jesus in your arms he said but
[1:52:27] what if you've been after kissing on the
[1:52:29] world and loving on the world he
[1:52:31] wouldn't feel welcome in your lap oh but
[1:52:35] Lord Jesus we open our arms to you
[1:52:38] tonight Lord we don't want to kitchen
[1:52:41] Jesus wouldn't want to live in a room
[1:52:43] Jesus we want a whole house Jesus praise
[1:52:49] God praise God thank you lord
[1:52:55] can we just raised her hands children
[1:52:58] many of you will give Jesus your ties
[1:53:02] you'll give Jesus throughout a tower on
[1:53:05] the outside your sisters would dress and
[1:53:07] long dresses and all that but many of
[1:53:09] you never make that full commitment of
[1:53:11] your emotions to him there was an
[1:53:13] element of your emotions if you've kept
[1:53:15] back you're afraid of what people will
[1:53:17] think but if you've never made that full
[1:53:19] commitment of other aspects of your life
[1:53:22] and you walk just close enough to the
[1:53:25] world where people might not know that
[1:53:27] you're a messege believer you wear your
[1:53:29] dresses borderline
[1:53:30] you know the dresses are coming higher
[1:53:32] and higher and higher above the knees
[1:53:33] and message sisters have to pull and tug
[1:53:36] on their dresses
[1:53:37] your sisters should not even have to be
[1:53:38] taught about that but the team sent me a
[1:53:40] quote of the day tell Marilyn you hear
[1:53:42] the voice of the Lord Jesus and get the
[1:53:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost he said you'll
[1:53:46] never have to hear another sermon
[1:53:47] preached on dress I thought my lord it
[1:53:50] makes such a turn in people's life there
[1:53:53] won't even have to hear another sermon
[1:53:55] preached on dress you should not have to
[1:53:59] hear it preached over and over again if
[1:54:01] you do there's something wrong with your
[1:54:02] experience commit your music commute
[1:54:07] commit everything France committed to it
[1:54:10] hey man hey hallelujah
[1:54:15] having to just search your heart to pass
[1:54:19] through God's MRI or a CT scan as it was
[1:54:22] let him just scan ever avenue of your
[1:54:24] life don't hold anything back from

[1:55:04] sense of the word because I don't have a
[1:55:06] public job to hold down but help these
[1:55:08] people to realize if they'd only make
[1:55:11] that time available these housewives

[1:55:15] got to do you're not going to tell them
[1:55:17] to leave their children undone and leave

[2:05:14] said that there was no God or if there
[2:05:17] was a God he was dead and this little
