[42:12] what helps us to achieve these things in
[42:14] our life when symptoms can rage like a
[42:20] wildfire we can hurt worse sometimes
[42:23] after we've been prayed for and after
[42:24] we're claiming our healing we can have
[42:27] more anxiety and more trouble whatever
[42:30] it is that we're asking for but we know

[43:07] and sicknesses and your Prophet has told
[43:10] us that there would be things comeing
[43:12] the last day that would make cancer look
[43:14] like a toothache and so
[43:16] insignificant father we're grateful that
[43:19] your healing virtue is with us even in
[43:22] this Evil dark day of sickness and
[43:25] disease and Lord if we get healed and if
[43:29] we live long enough we'll get sick
[43:31] again but we're fixing to approach
[43:34] something in your
[43:36] word that if we can get the contents of
[43:40] what the scriptures and the message
[43:43] teaches us from what we're about to hear
[43:45] though our bodies may get sick our souls
[43:48] will be redeemed
[43:51] forever and that's what we desire Jesus
[43:54] we want to please you we want to serve
[43:57] serve you with all of our hearts forgive
[44:00] us of our shortcomings our failures help
[44:02] me today Lord I pray in the name of
[44:06] Jesus and the saint said amen isn't it
[44:10] good to be a child of God yes it is to
[44:13] be in the house of
[44:15] God well I'll tell you one thing you
[44:17] would not believe all the comments that
[44:19] I heard about the service Wednesday
[44:21] night and here I was about ready to just
[44:25] resign and think y'all wouldn't didn't
[44:27] want me to preach no more but the time I
[44:28] got back there to my desk my phone had
[44:30] already just about blowed up with all
[44:33] the different things and I've talked to
[44:36] several different people this week and
[44:38] to hear how perfect that the word was
[44:42] how
[44:43] timely as a matter of fact some people
[44:46] talking about things that was preached
[44:48] Wednesday night on the way to church and
[44:51] the Lord turned right around some people
[44:53] talking on two days before and I just
[44:56] love it when the Lord does that I
[44:58] believe in that kind of
[45:00] discernment when the word discerns the
[45:03] secrets of our hearts don't you the word
[45:06] is always perfect and timely isn't it
[45:09] let's turn again to Second Peter today
[45:11] if you would chapter 1 verse4 and we
[45:14] want to speak to you by the help of the
[45:16] Lord on our right to be in divine order
[45:19] to be what God has called us to
[45:23] be you know it's been my privilege in
[45:28] one way I say it that way to be able to
[45:31] deal with thousands of people around the
[45:34] world both saved and lost message
[45:37] Believers non- message
[45:39] Believers and as I deal with people that
[45:43] have found their purpose it's such a
[45:46] blessing and such a wonderful thing but
[45:48] my lot in life has also been to deal
[45:51] with a lot of people who have basically
[45:53] a wasted
[45:55] life they don't serve God they just live
[45:59] any way they want to live you know live
[46:01] according to the world the things of the
[46:03] world and never seem to find the Lord
[46:07] and don't really even
[46:08] care they live and they die they pass it
[46:12] onto their kids or kids live and die
[46:15] just a wasted
[46:17] life and it just to me it just so sad
[46:21] that a human being would come here to
[46:22] the Earth and never get credit and glory
[46:25] to the Lord who brought them they live
[46:27] their life do whatever they want to do
[46:29] and it's just absolutely
[46:32] wasted don't you want to give your life
[46:34] to
[46:35] Jesus I'm not talking about you getting
[46:37] saved now I'm just talking about after
[46:39] you're saved that you give your whole
[46:42] being to him to let him to be able to
[46:44] fulfill his word in your
[46:47] life second Peter chapter 1
[46:50] ver4 whereby are given unto us exceeding
[46:54] great and precious promises that by
[46:57] these by these promises you might be
[47:02] partakers of the divine
[47:05] nature now this is a very tricky word
[47:11] partakers it can be so absolute in some
[47:14] ways in verses of scripture where it's
[47:17] used and at
[47:19] others it's not quite so much now listen
[47:23] here because in this particular place it
[47:25] is that you might be Akers of the divine
[47:28] nature having escaped the corruption
[47:31] that is in the world through
[47:34] lust and beside this giving all
[47:39] diligence add to your faith virtue how
[47:43] in the world can you and I add
[47:48] virtue how can we add knowledge how can
[47:52] we add Temperance how can we add
[47:55] godliness how can we add brotherly
[47:57] kindness how can I add
[48:00] anything of this divine nature now on my
[48:03] own on your own we can never do it but
[48:05] we must first realize there's a need in
[48:08] our life that's one thing the preaching
[48:10] of the Gospel does makes us aware of our
[48:12] shortcomings not to discourage you not
[48:15] to dishearten you and I but to help us
[48:17] to see there's a need there then we open
[48:20] up the channel by which God can connect
[48:23] with the need in our soul and minister
[48:26] to us what we have need of how many as
[48:28] needs are here this morning needs of
[48:30] these things as well beside this giving
[48:33] all diligence add to your faith virtue
[48:36] to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[48:40] Temperance and to Temperance patience
[48:43] and to patience godliness and to
[48:47] Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[48:50] brotherly kindness charity may the Lord
[48:53] bless his word you may be seated
[48:59] I mentioned it to you last Sunday
[49:00] whenever we went this direction that to
[49:03] be a partaker of God's Amazing Grace
[49:07] it's a wonderful thing how glad I am
[49:11] today to have partaken of the grace of
[49:13] God so many years ago to save me and
[49:15] then the grace of God that helps me
[49:17] along my everyday Journey as I'm heading
[49:20] back to where I come from to be a
[49:22] partaker of Mer of Mercy UNM merited
[49:25] favor something something that God gives
[49:27] all of us every day of our life healing
[49:31] I've been healed many times I've
[49:32] experienced Miracles as you have and to
[49:35] partake of that it's absolutely awesome
[49:39] but the privilege that is given
[49:41] ultimately to what Peter is writing this
[49:45] toward of those that are partakers of
[49:48] God's divine nature now partake of his
[49:53] nature isn't the same thing as being
[49:56] able to partake of the blessings of God
[49:59] of the mercy of God God can save people
[50:03] from a terrible state that they're in
[50:06] and then turn around and be lost God can
[50:10] save them for a life of Darkness save
[50:13] them from a life of hell and then them
[50:16] somehow lose sight of that and they go
[50:19] right back into that life again and wind
[50:22] up being lost forever so to partake
[50:27] in the sense of what Peter is saying
[50:29] about the divine nature is not just to
[50:32] be able to get a little bit of it if I
[50:34] have it open this bottle here and be
[50:36] able to drink a little bit of this and
[50:38] take it into my body and my body will
[50:41] start that miraculous process of
[50:44] absorbing what's inside of here now I've
[50:46] drunk many of these before so I do know
[50:48] a little bit about what's inside them
[50:50] vitamin B3 6 c n calcium this that and
[50:54] the other is inside of there and it
[50:56] helps me it actually refreshes me a
[50:59] little bit not only to be able to quench
[51:01] my thirst but there's something inside
[51:03] of there and my body will start breaking
[51:06] it down now my mind directs my hands and
[51:09] then my hands pick up the bottle and
[51:12] then I go to doing it this way then my
[51:14] mind will tell my hand to put it up to
[51:16] my mouth I will then swallow it down and
[51:19] then from there it's a subconscious work
[51:21] that takes place so my mind is no longer
[51:24] just telling each move but in my body my
[51:27] body will start processing what I've
[51:30] just drank same with food just like
[51:32] yours does and it's the same in the
[51:34] Supernatural sense once we do our part
[51:37] now I could sit there and my body make
[51:39] crave after that I could be so thirsty
[51:42] out say I'm am so thirsty I need
[51:44] something to drink but my mind must have
[51:47] a Channel of communication and it will
[51:50] what will it do it will go to my sight
[51:53] so my sight sees where it's at knows
[51:55] where it's at it's good and cold the way
[51:58] I like it and then there'll be a
[52:00] coordination of skills and and mental
[52:03] things that'll take place and then
[52:05] reactions to those invisible thoughts
[52:08] you don't see my mind as it's telling me
[52:10] what to do but my mind is telling me my
[52:13] hands don't even see my mind's thoughts
[52:16] but my hand will reach down and pick it
[52:18] up then it'll start the process take the
[52:20] lid off start drinking it then it'll
[52:23] come inside my body and then
[52:25] subliminally there will be something
[52:27] that'll take place inside the body once
[52:30] we're born again we come to the Lord we
[52:33] bow at an altar somewhere the spirit of
[52:35] God does what it does initially then we
[52:39] respond to that then the spirit of God
[52:41] starts this work inside of us
[52:44] spiritually just like our natural body
[52:46] does our food now before long you all
[52:49] will be getting hungry again so you pray
[52:51] I can talk fast and I don't preach all
[52:53] day and y'all will be able to go eat you
[52:55] some lunch okay
[52:57] but there'll be something about your
[52:58] body in a little bit that'll start
[53:01] sending signals from your stomach and
[53:03] your stomach may start growling and
[53:05] making noises and you're feeling hunger
[53:08] pains and there'll be something there
[53:10] now your stomach can do that for many
[53:13] many hours but it will depend upon the
[53:15] rest of your body to go wherever you've
[53:18] got planned to go eat after church and
[53:20] then there's things about it that the
[53:23] outside conscience must tie in together
[53:26] with the inward need that's inside of
[53:29] your body that's what the preaching of
[53:31] the Gospel does that we hear the word
[53:33] and we see Lord I need more Mercy I need
[53:36] more love I need more forgiveness I I
[53:39] need more understanding and brotherly
[53:42] kindness and godness for my for my
[53:44] brothers and the church said so there's
[53:47] something in us that responds to that
[53:50] but God works with that element now
[53:53] people can also though partake of of
[53:56] mercy and blessings they can actually
[53:59] partake of a little bit of the light of
[54:02] God they can actually partake of a
[54:06] portion of the Holy
[54:09] Ghost and wind up being
[54:12] lost a person could partake of a real
[54:15] Divine gift from
[54:17] God and be
[54:20] lost so we want to do more than just to
[54:24] take and partake of of this and in a
[54:28] little while I try to drink this it'll
[54:30] be gone it runs in my body my body will
[54:33] do as yours it'll process it throw out
[54:36] the bad stuff try to take the good stuff
[54:38] and before long I'll want another one
[54:40] and it's the same way with our food and
[54:42] it's the same way with many spiritual
[54:44] things but whenever it comes to being
[54:46] partakers of the divine nature if we
[54:48] ever arrive to that state and our soul
[54:51] is sealed in the presence of God you
[54:54] will never lose that the rest of your
[54:57] life when you receive the Holy Ghost and
[55:00] your soul is sealed that is your part of
[55:05] deity it is yours forever thank you Lord
[55:10] it will never be taken away now the
[55:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[55:17] Ah that's a different thing
[55:20] altoe you see a person could have the
[55:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour of
[55:27] their
[55:28] life and die lost right and go to
[55:32] hell Elvis
[55:35] Presley had the
[55:38] baptism of the Holy
[55:42] Ghost don't look at me bug ey that's
[55:44] what the prophet said the prophet said
[55:46] he knew his Mo his mother Pastor all of
[55:49] them that's where he learned how to
[55:50] shake his leg all that dancing and all
[55:53] that rock and roll he learned it in
[55:54] church assembly of godur Church in
[55:56] Western
[55:57] Tennessee so Elvis had the baptism of
[56:01] the Holy Ghost but he did not partake of
[56:05] God's divine
[56:07] nature now let's turn to Hebrews chapter
[56:09] 6 this morning where this same word
[56:13] partaker is used Again by Paul for it is
[56:18] impossible for those who were once
[56:22] enlightened now this word is amazing
[56:25] word I love this word the Greek word
[56:27] fito which is the word we get photograph
[56:30] from or photo because it means to give
[56:33] light or illuminate give light
[56:36] illuminate make to see render evident
[56:40] for it is impossible for those who were
[56:43] once
[56:44] enlightened and have
[56:47] tasted of the Heavenly gift notice not
[56:53] gifts
[56:55] gift
[56:57] singular so people can be enlightened
[57:00] God will illuminate salvation to them
[57:04] give them light help them see they're
[57:06] lost help them to see they need you know
[57:09] various things in their life God will
[57:11] open up their senses their spiritual
[57:14] perception and illuminate to them and
[57:17] make them to see that they need
[57:20] something else and it's rendered to them
[57:23] evident it is evident from the way
[57:26] they're living evident from the Hunger
[57:28] in their soul so now notice what Paul
[57:30] said it's impossible for those who were
[57:32] once in life and have
[57:36] tasted so when I drink this right
[57:40] here does one drop of it go into my
[57:46] spirit does one drop of this go into my
[57:52] soul but did I partake of it
[57:56] did I did I partake of it but yet it
[57:59] don't have the ability to go into my
[58:02] spirit which is contacted by love
[58:05] imagination conscience memory and reason
[58:08] nor does it have the ability to go down
[58:10] into my soul which is contacted only by
[58:14] one thing free moral agency so this can
[58:18] go into me and you say Oh Brother Don
[58:20] you didn't get in your spirit you didn't
[58:22] partake of it but I did it refreshed me
[58:26] I felt better it helped me it
[58:30] revitalized me and momentarily I was
[58:39] changed I think the Holy Ghost can move
[58:41] on a person's body they could shout they
[58:44] could jump it could move on their eyes
[58:48] and open their eyes and let them see a
[58:53] vision yes right
[58:56] they could see a vision which is
[58:59] Supernatural if it come from God of
[59:01] course it could move on their tongue and
[59:04] allow them to speak in a language they
[59:07] never learned before and turn right
[59:09] around and interpret that
[59:11] tongue and still not be in their soul at
[59:15] all right but they are partaking of it I
[59:19] don't want to partake of the divine
[59:21] nature that
[59:22] way now watch this is a very scary
[59:25] scripture for many people it shouldn't
[59:26] be because if you're bride this don't
[59:28] even apply to you this is totally
[59:31] impossible for the elect to ever fulfill
[59:35] this verse so drive that devil away from
[59:38] your fear for it is impossible for those
[59:43] who were
[59:45] once
[59:47] once I'm not once
[59:51] enlightened I'm
[59:53] forever
[59:55] enlightened come on somebody say Amen we
[59:58] are not once oh no we're not once
[1:00:02] enlightened We Are
[1:00:03] Forever enlightened by the grace of God
[1:00:06] but this is speaking of people that have
[1:00:09] once experienced these things with God
[1:00:12] and then they turn and walk away and
[1:00:15] step across that line and if they ever
[1:00:19] do they can never come back I ain't
[1:00:21] talking about people backsliding now and
[1:00:24] being able to come back to God there
[1:00:26] people sitting here today that backslid
[1:00:29] and came back to God Peter
[1:00:32] backslid but he can never fulfill this
[1:00:35] verse of scripture cuz his name was on
[1:00:38] that bride book the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:00:41] is that right for it is impossible for
[1:00:44] those who were once enlightened and have
[1:00:49] tasted can you imagine the Holy Ghost
[1:00:52] being so close to some people that they
[1:00:56] actually
[1:00:59] taste of the Holy Ghost I said
[1:01:02] oh oh my
[1:01:05] goodness that is so
[1:01:08] awesome that is so
[1:01:10] wonderful oh I'm never be the same that
[1:01:13] is so powerful oh hallelujah
[1:01:19] hallelujah but you see it enters in and
[1:01:23] their flesh reacts their Spirit rejoices
[1:01:28] I may hot or shout amen whatever but it
[1:01:31] never moves down in the
[1:01:33] soul to seal the
[1:01:37] soul look at the word
[1:01:40] tasted to
[1:01:42] taste to try the flavor
[1:01:47] of now I am familiar with the flavor of
[1:01:51] this and I'm going to tell you all the
[1:01:52] name of it dragon fruit Berry
[1:01:58] cool name
[1:02:04] huh
[1:02:05] yep tastes just exactly the way it did
[1:02:08] the last time I drunk that
[1:02:12] flavor so some people do the holy ghost
[1:02:16] that
[1:02:18] way they open the bottle as it were
[1:02:21] press it to the oh Jesus jesuses and
[1:02:24] they prayed well they get emotional or
[1:02:26] whatever it is oh Hallelujah I feel so
[1:02:29] better praise the Lord God done
[1:02:31] something for me and they tasted of the
[1:02:34] Holy Ghost so what look at the meaning
[1:02:36] of the word that Paul uses to try the
[1:02:39] flavor
[1:02:41] of so they're not there to
[1:02:44] die to get the Holy Ghost in their soul
[1:02:47] they're simply there to try it and
[1:02:54] see see if they like it or
[1:02:58] not and some will taste some oh oh I
[1:03:02] could tell but a look wrinkle or nose on
[1:03:04] some of y'all's face you wouldn't even
[1:03:05] try that flavor right there would you
[1:03:07] dragon fruit Berry I don't want nothing
[1:03:09] doing no dragon oh my goodness Ain't No
[1:03:12] Way in the world I would want to drink
[1:03:14] something like that well some people
[1:03:15] think they might want to deal with the
[1:03:17] Holy Ghost until they taste it and when
[1:03:20] they do this no
[1:03:23] no so to take
[1:03:27] to try the flavor
[1:03:30] of
[1:03:35] enjoy to feel yeah sounds like the Holy
[1:03:39] Ghost to
[1:03:41] feel make trial
[1:03:46] of and that's the Modern Day Gospel try
[1:03:50] Jesus I'm not telling you to try Jesus
[1:03:53] Jesus ain't like a you know try this and
[1:03:56] then try alcohol and then try this and
[1:03:58] try that I'm not telling you to try
[1:04:00] Jesus I'm saying come to Jesus and give
[1:04:02] him your all CU a lot of people try him
[1:04:05] and they don't like him a lot of people
[1:04:07] try the Holy Ghost and you know what
[1:04:10] they don't like it they don't like the
[1:04:11] demands they don't like the
[1:04:13] responsibility or the flavor might suit
[1:04:15] them for a little bit but the bottom
[1:04:17] line is it's only a trial and they
[1:04:20] decide they don't want it now these are
[1:04:21] the words that Paul uses so he says
[1:04:25] let's read it again on context it is
[1:04:27] impossible for those who were once
[1:04:29] enlightened so they've been illuminated
[1:04:31] and have tasted of the Heavenly
[1:04:35] gift the Holy
[1:04:38] Ghost and were made
[1:04:43] partakers of the Holy
[1:04:48] Ghost
[1:04:50] wow so they tasted they tried they
[1:04:54] experienced and they actually partook of
[1:04:59] it made
[1:05:02] partakers of the Holy Ghost watch this
[1:05:05] in question answer 61 the prophets
[1:05:07] quoting this scripture for it is
[1:05:08] impossible for those who were once
[1:05:10] enlightened and have tasted watch tasted
[1:05:12] the Heavenly gift that been right on the
[1:05:15] edge of it tasted the Heavenly gifts now
[1:05:18] you notice they had never come to the
[1:05:23] baptism of the Holy Spirit they was
[1:05:26] enlightened to it they tasted of the
[1:05:28] Heavenly gift but were made partakers of
[1:05:30] the Holy Ghost by
[1:05:33] tasting of
[1:05:35] it so you see the difference between
[1:05:39] partaking in this degree of the Holy
[1:05:41] Ghost and being a partaker of the divine
[1:05:44] nature the only way you can truly
[1:05:46] partake of the divine nature is be
[1:05:50] immers into it and it changes you
[1:05:54] forever
[1:05:56] yes
[1:05:57] sirc blessings miracles signs wonders
[1:06:00] shouting knowledge quoting the word
[1:06:03] quoting the message even listening to
[1:06:05] tapes going to church being religious
[1:06:08] what is that that's partaking partaking
[1:06:11] so a person comes and they come to
[1:06:13] church and they participate in the
[1:06:14] service and they partake of it and then
[1:06:17] when they get out in the car they go to
[1:06:18] sort and to what you think about that
[1:06:20] what you think about that well I didn't
[1:06:21] like this and I didn't like that I
[1:06:23] didn't like this and didn't like that so
[1:06:24] they go to sort through well I didn't I
[1:06:27] don't think we have to live that way I
[1:06:28] don't think the Bible requires that so
[1:06:30] what are they doing they're sorting
[1:06:31] through and they're trying The Taste to
[1:06:34] see if they like it or not but you see
[1:06:36] if you ever become a partaker of the
[1:06:38] divine nature you will find the war that
[1:06:42] you were born with in you the moment you
[1:06:45] were born and that is you were at war
[1:06:49] with God if you ever become a partaker
[1:06:52] of the divine nature that war is over
[1:06:56] forever that's right now your old flesh
[1:06:59] May Ward against it and all that but
[1:07:00] that nature in you will never rebel
[1:07:04] against God again it can't you've been
[1:07:07] converted
[1:07:08] than oh my now notice he said they were
[1:07:13] partakers of the Holy Ghost by tasting
[1:07:16] of it having tasted of the good word of
[1:07:18] God and powers of the world to come now
[1:07:22] watch how Paul goes on to say it is
[1:07:24] impossible for those who were once
[1:07:26] enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:07:28] Heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[1:07:32] the Holy
[1:07:33] Ghost partaker sharing in partaking a
[1:07:40] partner in a work
[1:07:43] office or
[1:07:49] dignity let me tell you about a
[1:07:53] preacher very gift
[1:07:56] Ed very
[1:07:59] anointed very
[1:08:03] charismatic had
[1:08:05] healings signs
[1:08:08] wonders
[1:08:11] Miracles this preacher I'm referring to
[1:08:15] was actually
[1:08:16] baptized by Jesus Christ
[1:08:21] himself his name was
[1:08:23] Judas that's right brother
[1:08:26] amen he was
[1:08:28] illuminated to the message of the hour
[1:08:32] that Jesus was the son of God he was
[1:08:35] anointed a partaker of Jesus own
[1:08:40] Ministry he shared in the ministry with
[1:08:43] Peter James John Bartholomew all the
[1:08:46] rest of the Brethren notice this in the
[1:08:49] sardes and church age and the church age
[1:08:51] book now if language means anything at
[1:08:53] all we must admit that Judas
[1:08:56] was
[1:08:57] chosen by
[1:08:59] Jesus John
[1:09:01] 13:18 yet he was not clean John 13:10
[1:09:05] to11 Judas was also given to Jesus by
[1:09:11] the Father John
[1:09:14] 17:12 now he goes on in this if you'd
[1:09:17] like to read the whole thing but to skip
[1:09:18] a or spare a little time I skipped on
[1:09:21] down to part of this quote down for a
[1:09:23] L's in it Judas was not numbered with
[1:09:25] the 12 and actually had a part with them
[1:09:30] in the
[1:09:31] ministry previous to
[1:09:35] Pentecost now keep in mind this man was
[1:09:38] not
[1:09:39] inferior and when Jesus you've heard me
[1:09:42] say this for years but when Jesus en
[1:09:44] enlightened them to the mystery that
[1:09:47] someone was going to betray him
[1:09:49] somebody's sitting there at the table
[1:09:52] and they begin to look around and they
[1:09:54] question
[1:09:56] thems before they even questioned Judas
[1:09:59] so he was so close in
[1:10:02] lifestyle in
[1:10:04] mannerism in vacular he talked the
[1:10:08] message talk it seemed as if though he
[1:10:12] walked the message walk he hung around
[1:10:17] the right people oh somebody preach with
[1:10:20] me
[1:10:21] today so it wasn't like that they would
[1:10:24] catch Judas all the time and he would be
[1:10:26] flirting with the young sisters or you
[1:10:29] know eyeing the women he couldn't keep
[1:10:31] his hands off of the women or you know
[1:10:33] he wasn't sneaking around and doing this
[1:10:35] and that and the other and they'd catch
[1:10:37] him drunk every now and then Judas lived
[1:10:41] such a Godly life as we would say that
[1:10:44] they never even doubted that it was him
[1:10:47] as a matter of fact in the way that they
[1:10:50] would have set at the table they did not
[1:10:52] eat the way we do they did not set in a
[1:10:55] chair in the position like you're
[1:10:57] sitting in now and they would pull their
[1:10:59] feet up under a table but they would
[1:11:01] actually
[1:11:03] recline so at the Last Supper the Lord
[1:11:06] Jesus would have been sitting on the
[1:11:07] middle and John would have been on one
[1:11:10] side sort of reclined and Judas would
[1:11:14] have been on the other side
[1:11:17] reclined oh my and the disciples
[1:11:20] actually with have thought in their mind
[1:11:22] Judas is going to take Jesus
[1:11:30] place they never even question his
[1:11:34] Integrity his character his preaching
[1:11:38] his
[1:11:40] signs his
[1:11:42] wonders and he was a
[1:11:45] devil the whole
[1:11:50] time so a person can partake of the min
[1:11:55] Ministry partake of
[1:11:57] knowledge partake of the Holy Ghost in
[1:12:01] the form of anointing Supernatural gifts
[1:12:05] and so
[1:12:06] on oh my notice this Judas was numbered
[1:12:11] with the 12 and actually had a part with
[1:12:13] them in the ministry previous to
[1:12:15] Pentecost acts 1:16-17 men and brethen
[1:12:19] this scripture must need to be fulfilled
[1:12:21] which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of
[1:12:23] David spake before concerning Judas
[1:12:26] which was guide to them that took
[1:12:31] Jesus for he was numbered with
[1:12:35] us and had obtained
[1:12:38] part of this
[1:12:40] ministry the part that Judas
[1:12:44] obtained amongst the 12 and then lost
[1:12:48] was neither
[1:12:49] inferior to the ministries of the other
[1:12:52] 11 nor was it a devilish
[1:12:56] foreign Ministry
[1:12:59] interjected amongst the ministry of the
[1:13:03] others that's think of it he was
[1:13:06] actually
[1:13:07] partaking a part of the real
[1:13:11] Ministry of the Lord Jesus
[1:13:16] he dear God help
[1:13:19] us acts
[1:13:21] 1:25 now the Brethren are getting
[1:13:23] together and trying to find somebody to
[1:13:25] replace Judas and may he take part of
[1:13:27] this ministry and apostleship from when
[1:13:31] Judas by transgression fell that he
[1:13:34] might go to his own place
[1:13:39] Judas a
[1:13:41] devil lost a god-given
[1:13:45] holy
[1:13:47] ghost
[1:13:51] Ministry oh Lord
[1:13:55] and killed
[1:13:56] himself and went to his own
[1:14:00] place now let me tell you every person
[1:14:03] sitting here today and every person on
[1:14:04] the sound of my voice around the
[1:14:07] world this is the choices that's before
[1:14:09] each of us today we will live our life
[1:14:12] we will choose our own paths we will
[1:14:15] partake of the Enlightenment of the
[1:14:16] message of the hour the word of God or
[1:14:18] you'll go the way of the world and just
[1:14:20] I don't want nothing to do with it at
[1:14:21] all or you will give yourself over to
[1:14:25] the Lord
[1:14:26] Jesus and you will not go in the
[1:14:30] direction that Judas went but you will
[1:14:33] go to your own
[1:14:35] place every lost person will go to their
[1:14:39] own place every church member go to
[1:14:42] their own place and the bride will go to
[1:14:45] her own place too but it wasn't because
[1:14:49] she deserved it it was because God gave
[1:14:52] it to her by his grace now notice the
[1:14:55] way that that the scripture says this in
[1:14:58] Acts and then the prophet when he
[1:14:59] mentions this in the church AG book that
[1:15:01] he died and went to his own place so the
[1:15:03] question is this morning then where
[1:15:07] is your place cuz it's inevitable every
[1:15:12] one of us are going to our own place but
[1:15:17] I don't mind telling you this morning I
[1:15:19] have no fear of going to hell cuz it
[1:15:22] ain't my place I have no fear this
[1:15:25] morning of being lost because that's not
[1:15:28] who I am I once was lost like you were I
[1:15:32] once was buying but now I see but I am
[1:15:35] not enlightened for a season only I am
[1:15:39] enlightened for eternity I don't want to
[1:15:42] just be a partaker of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:45] can't you see how frightening this is
[1:15:47] for a preacher for a man that stands up
[1:15:50] behind the pulpit knowing that he could
[1:15:52] be a partaker of the whole Holy Ghost
[1:15:55] Ministry and without that man himself
[1:15:58] being born again how many of us have we
[1:16:00] seen down through the years of men that
[1:16:03] had a real god-given Ministry and they
[1:16:06] wind up being a womanizer or wind up
[1:16:08] being after money or popularity or
[1:16:11] whatever it is and Fall Away have we
[1:16:13] seen it sure we have will we see more no
[1:16:16] doubt we will but I'll tell you one
[1:16:19] thing if Satan can do that and he makes
[1:16:21] a mimic and a copy then that lets me
[1:16:24] know there are some genuine God call men
[1:16:28] they will not sell out they are not for
[1:16:30] sale they are not for sale for a woman
[1:16:34] or for money or for popularity or
[1:16:37] anything else if God cannot produce
[1:16:41] god-given Holy Ghost filled Ministry
[1:16:44] then the rest of you folks might as well
[1:16:46] give up and quit because before the Lord
[1:16:49] Jesus ever called and established a
[1:16:51] church he called and established
[1:16:54] preacher ERS and told them preachers go
[1:16:57] preach my word and if there's going to
[1:17:00] be a bride in the last days and there is
[1:17:03] and if she's going in the Rapture then
[1:17:06] God must have a god-given holy ghost
[1:17:09] filled Ministry that will not compromise
[1:17:13] they will preach Jesus Christ and him
[1:17:15] raised from the dead they will cast out
[1:17:18] Devils they will lay hand on the sick
[1:17:21] and they shall recover because they are
[1:17:24] partaking of the ministry of the Lord
[1:17:35] Jesus oh my
[1:17:38] goodness notice Paul goes on to say
[1:17:41] about these people that that they have
[1:17:45] tasted the
[1:17:47] good word of
[1:17:51] God very same word that he used before
[1:17:55] to eat to taste to try the flavor of to
[1:17:58] feel to make trial of or
[1:18:02] experience so they've tasted the good
[1:18:06] word of God and they even acknowledged
[1:18:09] this is so
[1:18:10] good this is so good I love this this is
[1:18:16] so
[1:18:21] good I don't want to just say it's good
[1:18:23] and stop
[1:18:25] I want to say it's so good I can't live
[1:18:27] without it and I got to have more and
[1:18:29] more and more I me know I'm talking
[1:18:31] about it's a very strange saying this
[1:18:33] eternal life that we receive we get it
[1:18:35] but it ain't like you get it once and
[1:18:37] you partake of it once and that does you
[1:18:39] the rest of your life the more you get
[1:18:41] the more you want and the more you want
[1:18:43] the more you need the more you need the
[1:18:44] more you want and the more you reach out
[1:18:46] and the more you get God said that's
[1:18:48] exactly what I wanted it to be for you I
[1:18:50] want this to be something that'll
[1:18:52] satisfy you like nothing else but don't
[1:18:55] think you'll get it 45 years ago and
[1:18:57] that's the end of it I'll tell you one
[1:18:59] thing I need more now than I've Ever
[1:19:01] Needed in my life don't you H's been
[1:19:04] serving the lord for years and years and
[1:19:06] you say I need more and I want more than
[1:19:09] I've ever
[1:19:11] had but you see this category of people
[1:19:14] taste the good word of God and they say
[1:19:18] oh this is so
[1:19:21] good but they run across things
[1:19:25] that they don't
[1:19:27] like so they throw it
[1:19:30] out and they throw that out and that out
[1:19:33] and that out sir now traveling around
[1:19:37] the world I've had to eat a lot of
[1:19:40] things the lord gave me a missionary
[1:19:44] heart but he didn't give me a missionary
[1:19:46] stomach to match it so I don't mind
[1:19:49] telling you those things that I've eat

[1:20:02] things that you had to eat on one of my
[1:20:04] trips to China One of the Brethren there

[1:20:22] saying yeah so when I'm went to markets

[1:20:36] taste of ruff ruff no
[1:20:39] no uhuh I know it may be in my mind it
[1:20:43] may be in my mind like with you now you
[1:20:46] see when people get that attitude toward
[1:20:48] God's word well where does that come
[1:20:51] from well we believe God sent
[1:20:53] a i can't handle that Prophet so oh my

[1:21:04] good word of

[1:21:24] of the powers of the world that is to
[1:21:28] come brother sister you're talking about
[1:21:32] close notice again in verse
[1:21:35] six if they shall fall away but you see
[1:21:40] Peter when he writes about these virtues
[1:21:43] he said if a man will have these things
[1:21:45] in him he will never
[1:21:50] fall I'm telling you this is important
[1:21:52] this is not something that we think well
[1:21:56] it's it's an option right like power
[1:21:58] windows if I don't want power windows I
[1:21:59] don't have to have them no this is a
[1:22:02] requirement a bride
[1:22:05] requirement if they shall fall away to
[1:22:08] renew them again un repentance seeing
[1:22:12] they no longer
[1:22:15] caiaphus no longer Pontius
[1:22:18] pilot no longer the Roman
[1:22:21] Centurion but they me you anyone
[1:22:27] else who does this to the Lord Jesus and
[1:22:30] it is no longer the centeron at the foot
[1:22:34] of the cross no longer cfus at the foot
[1:22:37] of the
[1:22:38] cross it's you it's me your mother your
[1:22:43] daddy and it's you crucifying Jesus oh
[1:22:50] again if they shall fall away to renew
[1:22:52] them again into repentance seeing they
[1:22:56] crucify
[1:22:58] to
[1:23:01] themselves so you put Jesus on your own
[1:23:08] cross so you want to know who the maker
[1:23:11] of the Cross
[1:23:12] is look in the mirror after
[1:23:16] church it was you and I who caus him to
[1:23:18] go there I may have caused it initially
[1:23:22] but by his grace I'll never cause him
[1:23:24] again
[1:23:25] amen you understand what I'm saying now
[1:23:27] notice these people that come here they
[1:23:30] are twice
[1:23:32] guilty because they caused him to do it
[1:23:35] in the first place and he went there in
[1:23:37] their stad even if they're not bride
[1:23:39] they can be
[1:23:41] saved but they turn him down again and
[1:23:44] they crucify him again the second
[1:23:49] time they crucified to themselves the
[1:23:52] Son of God a fresh fesh and put him to
[1:23:57] an open
[1:23:59] shame now let's
[1:24:01] change so I trust and hope and pray that
[1:24:05] there's no one here today that will ever
[1:24:08] be the fullfillment of Hebrews
[1:24:12] 6 but what we wish to partake of today
[1:24:15] is of second Peter and that which is the
[1:24:19] divine nature of God and how that God
[1:24:23] embodied himself in this human temple in
[1:24:27] order that through the breaking of the
[1:24:28] blood cell it would release the life of
[1:24:32] God now God forbid them in the Old
[1:24:34] Testament to be able to eat meat with
[1:24:38] the blood in there or drink the blood
[1:24:41] and God wanted the blood to be drained
[1:24:43] out of it because the life was in the
[1:24:48] blood now they would break the animal
[1:24:51] they would take and break the blood cell
[1:24:53] of the animal and it would release the
[1:24:55] chemistry out of the body and the blood
[1:24:58] was used as a paint or a symbolism the
[1:25:02] innocent life of the sheep could not of
[1:25:04] course go to God but it was a
[1:25:07] substitutionary life that God accepted
[1:25:09] for The Sinner so the sinner would come
[1:25:11] up before the altar he would lay his
[1:25:14] hands on the head of his lamb and while
[1:25:16] he was there the priest would take the
[1:25:19] knife and slice the Sheep's throat and
[1:25:22] the the lamb would die oh my in the
[1:25:25] stead of the worshipper and the
[1:25:27] worshipper would walk away feeling the
[1:25:30] guilt and the pain because his sin
[1:25:33] caused that sheep to die it was only a
[1:25:37] symbolism a prophecy pointing to a day
[1:25:40] whenever God would do something a little
[1:25:42] bit different now the innocent sheep
[1:25:45] could not give its life to come back on
[1:25:48] the worshipper so me and brother Paul
[1:25:50] Brother D you brothers and sisters have
[1:25:52] believe lived in the Old Testament with
[1:25:54] walk up before the the house of the Lord
[1:25:57] and we would bring our sacrifice and
[1:25:59] there we would lay it and we would feel
[1:26:01] so ashamed because that little lamb had
[1:26:03] to die for us and then we'd walk out of
[1:26:06] there out of back out of the court of
[1:26:07] the Gentiles and would' walk out we
[1:26:10] might see a woman and we would lust
[1:26:11] after her we might stop down and get us
[1:26:13] a drink we might cheat our brother we
[1:26:16] might have a temper fit or this or that
[1:26:18] or the other and before long that guilt
[1:26:21] would leave us and we was identified
[1:26:24] feeling guilty and feeling so bad
[1:26:27] because our sin caused that little lamb
[1:26:29] to die but that would only last for a
[1:26:32] little while because then we'd walk back
[1:26:34] out and that snake which was in our
[1:26:37] hearts would R up again and go to
[1:26:41] hissing for sin and he'd want to do this
[1:26:44] and that and the other and then our
[1:26:46] subconscious would free us from the
[1:26:49] feeling of guilt and would start doing
[1:26:51] the same thing if not worse than we did
[1:26:53] before well then next year we'd come
[1:26:56] back we'd go up to Jerusalem on y Kapur
[1:26:59] the day of atonement and we do the same
[1:27:01] thing over and over again before long it
[1:27:04] becomes a ritual to all of us it becomes
[1:27:07] a routine well you going up I reckon
[1:27:09] yeah I guess I am I need to get rid of
[1:27:11] these Sins Of Mine God knows I need it I
[1:27:13] sure need it I'll tell you one thing and
[1:27:15] we go up there and we lay our hands on
[1:27:17] that would you hurry up I've got an
[1:27:18] appointment out here I've got to do a
[1:27:20] business transaction and we lay our
[1:27:22] hands on the head of the lamb and we
[1:27:23] walk out well praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:27:25] thank you Lord that's took care for
[1:27:27] another year now I don't have to go back
[1:27:29] church for another year praise God for
[1:27:31] that I don't like going anyhow and
[1:27:33] before long it come to a place there was
[1:27:35] no emotion there was no feeling but you
[1:27:38] see what God wanted to do was to be able
[1:27:41] to bring divine nature in down inside
[1:27:45] and make it to where man would be able
[1:27:47] to protect of so you remember the the
[1:27:50] Redemption money of the Old Testament
[1:27:52] anybody remember that well was actually
[1:27:55] silver now remember the elements the
[1:27:57] metallurgical elements that God uses in
[1:27:59] Redemption gold is deity silver of
[1:28:01] course is redemption purple blue
[1:28:04] Heavenly so all of those things that God
[1:28:06] used in the Tabernacle so silver speaks
[1:28:09] of redemption and God told them if they
[1:28:11] needed to redeem their first born you
[1:28:14] know they need to redeem it then they
[1:28:15] could buy it back from the Lord and they
[1:28:18] had to have a a shekele of the
[1:28:20] Tabernacle so the Roman dinar wouldn't
[1:28:22] work the the Mediterranean money that
[1:28:25] they would have used would not work it
[1:28:27] was a special currency Meed to be able
[1:28:30] to Reed in the house of God and God was
[1:28:34] giving a type again of the ransom money
[1:28:37] or the shekele the silver shekele that
[1:28:40] they would be able to buy it back so God
[1:28:42] had to come down and make himself in the
[1:28:45] form of a currency that would be
[1:28:48] accepted for your sin the Sheep could
[1:28:51] not give you its life so God wanted to
[1:28:54] come down himself in a human body and
[1:28:57] then create blood inside of that human
[1:29:00] body a woman would carry it around to
[1:29:03] full term and give birth to that body
[1:29:06] but not one Speck of her blood or her
[1:29:09] DNA would be in that body and the church
[1:29:12] said you know who that body was right
[1:29:14] the Lord
[1:29:15] Jesus so God had this Holy Blood created
[1:29:19] in him but also in him was this divine
[1:29:23] nature that we just read about and God
[1:29:25] made him being the acceptable form of
[1:29:29] currency that could be accepted on your
[1:29:31] behalf so your righteousness God won't
[1:29:35] accept it your goodness God won't accept
[1:29:37] it all the things that you could do God
[1:29:39] will not accept now in my office desk
[1:29:42] back at home I've got money from France
[1:29:45] I've got money from Switzerland I've got
[1:29:48] money from Zimbabwe I've got money from
[1:29:50] different places around the world that
[1:29:52] I've just kept kind of is a souvenir now
[1:29:55] what do you think if we need to go to
[1:29:56] the grocery store and I go to Food City
[1:29:59] or Walmart or somewhere and I try to pay
[1:30:01] for the groceries that Carolyn I get
[1:30:04] with Zim dollars which is what they call
[1:30:05] them in Zimbabwe Zimbabwe dollars or I
[1:30:08] use Shillings from Israel sister hope
[1:30:10] Kenya is still in Shillings as well uh
[1:30:12] so if I would have I still have some of
[1:30:14] the Kenya money as well so if I would go
[1:30:16] there and I leted out on on the the
[1:30:18] counter there and they look at me and
[1:30:20] say is this Monopoly money well no it's
[1:30:22] real money but I'm in the wrong
[1:30:24] jurisdiction to use it so what do I do I
[1:30:28] have to have money that will be able to
[1:30:31] pay the price for what I want I hope
[1:30:33] you're hearing me this morning if we
[1:30:35] want eternal life if we want to be saved
[1:30:38] we don't want to just be partakers of
[1:30:40] the Holy Ghost but we want the Holy
[1:30:43] Ghost to have us and have us all then
[1:30:46] we've got to have a coin we've got to
[1:30:49] have a money that will be accepted at
[1:30:53] the great Tri tribunal of God so there
[1:30:56] before the white Throne we approach him
[1:30:59] and we come God we want to be saved God
[1:31:02] we want to be redeemed God how we do
[1:31:04] well do you have the right money do you
[1:31:07] have the right price well Lord I I help
[1:31:10] I help the people I feed the poor I I
[1:31:13] pay TI that won't work here well I I go
[1:31:16] to church I I go to word of live church
[1:31:18] and I go there every now and then and u
[1:31:20] i I don't understand what they're saying
[1:31:22] but I I do I do like to the people that
[1:31:24] the nice people that won't work well I I
[1:31:27] do I say nice things about people that
[1:31:29] won't work in order to be redeemed
[1:31:32] you've got to have the only money I will
[1:31:34] accept which is myself in human form and
[1:31:39] then when the blood cell broke open at
[1:31:41] Calvary what did it release not just
[1:31:44] tongues not just interpretation that was
[1:31:46] all part of it but it released the
[1:31:49] divine nature then by coming God's
[1:31:52] provided way
[1:31:54] we accept the divine nature to replace
[1:31:58] our sinful
[1:32:00] nature but this is the mysterious part
[1:32:03] so the sinful nature in the soul is
[1:32:06] eradicated and gone but you still have a
[1:32:09] human nature and you're living in a
[1:32:12] flawed messed up human body is there
[1:32:15] anybody H us here today that can say
[1:32:18] we're all messed up I don't care how
[1:32:20] good you think you are how wonderful you
[1:32:22] think you are you are messed up you got
[1:32:25] a belly button you're messed up you got
[1:32:28] a belly button you're a renegade you've
[1:32:30] got a human mother and father unless
[1:32:32] there's somebody here today virgin born
[1:32:34] that I don't know anything about all the
[1:32:36] rest of you are just like the rest of us
[1:32:39] your whole flesh is Low Down Rotten no
[1:32:41] good it'll bother you every day you live
[1:32:45] it is your greatest enemy drinking a't
[1:32:47] your enemy adultery ain't your enemy
[1:32:50] lying ain't your enemy your greatest
[1:32:52] enemy is your old stinking body amen woo
[1:32:57] praise the Lord now watch the prophet as
[1:33:00] he goes into this about divine nature
[1:33:02] see we got to be so in love with him
[1:33:04] till when we ask for something and he
[1:33:07] doesn't give it to
[1:33:11] us that doesn't shake us a
[1:33:18] bit God spoke something to me this week
[1:33:21] I'm just not sure yet as far as
[1:33:24] the time but when he wants me to bring
[1:33:28] it but it was along this line I found
[1:33:31] amazing because I've been listening to
[1:33:33] this tape I don't know 10 12 times this
[1:33:35] week and then I found this I heard this
[1:33:37] quote notice how he says that that we
[1:33:39] want to be so in love with him that if
[1:33:41] we ask for something and he doesn't give
[1:33:44] it to us that it doesn't shake us a bit
[1:33:49] see why the only way you can do that is
[1:33:53] has become
[1:33:55] partakers of his divine nature now have
[1:33:58] we all asked God for things and God
[1:34:01] didn't give it God didn't give it in the
[1:34:04] way we wanted it or maybe God delayed
[1:34:06] the answer have we and then sometimes
[1:34:09] God just flat out say
[1:34:12] no what is it about us it's something
[1:34:15] about us human beings we don't like
[1:34:17] hearing that word we do not like no we
[1:34:21] didn't like it when we were kids and
[1:34:23] here we are most of us Ancient of Days a
[1:34:26] lot of us anyway and we don't like it
[1:34:28] any better so whether it come from our
[1:34:30] mama our daddy our pastor the deacons
[1:34:33] trustees or God we just don't like the
[1:34:37] word no in this application I'm talking
[1:34:39] about we like yes yes that's what we
[1:34:43] want to hear oh you know it's so easy
[1:34:45] for us if we're not careful and we have
[1:34:47] scriptures that seemingly allude to the
[1:34:51] point that whatever you ask God he'll do
[1:34:56] it didn't Jesus say whatever you ask in
[1:34:59] my name I'll do it if any two of you
[1:35:02] agree on Earth that's touching one thing
[1:35:04] whatever they ask will be done so it
[1:35:05] would seem as if though whatever that we
[1:35:09] ask without contingency that it is ours
[1:35:13] oh but there's other scriptures that we
[1:35:15] must also bring in in the same context
[1:35:18] you understand and that's where people
[1:35:20] get so hurt at God and offended at God
[1:35:24] but see if we are partakers of divine
[1:35:26] nature then it gives us an allocation
[1:35:29] that to be honest with you other people
[1:35:30] just don't have so if God tells us no
[1:35:34] and his no breaks our heart uproots our
[1:35:40] life changes us
[1:35:43] forever and not in a positive
[1:35:46] way how many of us can still love him
[1:35:49] with all of our
[1:35:51] hearts you don't have to raise your hand
[1:35:53] or not I mean just in your heart ask
[1:35:55] yourself that question if God says no so
[1:35:59] he says now watch that doesn't shake us
[1:36:01] a bit and the only way you could do that
[1:36:03] is to be partakers of his divine nature
[1:36:06] then you'll understand the reason he
[1:36:08] can't give it to you partakers of his
[1:36:11] divine nature now these people that
[1:36:13] Peter is saying here how that we must be
[1:36:16] partakers of his divine nature now each
[1:36:18] one of us now notice this is
[1:36:21] 1962 so the prophet has been preaching
[1:36:24] for years had the Holy Ghost for years
[1:36:26] October the 14th in the morning service
[1:36:29] and notice how he includes himself and
[1:36:31] what he's fixing to talk about now each
[1:36:34] one of us are trying to grow into the
[1:36:38] stature of God and if you're looking for
[1:36:41] something to listen to I highly
[1:36:42] recommend this one also Blasphemous
[1:36:44] names which is just a month or so after
[1:36:46] this because he refers to the same thing
[1:36:48] Harvest Time be a good one as well so I
[1:36:50] want you to notice that his brother
[1:36:52] Brown talks about that that he said each
[1:36:55] one of us so here brother Brandon is
[1:36:58] including himself in the growing of the
[1:37:03] virtues well you say well I've already
[1:37:05] got it praise the Lord I'm so glad you
[1:37:07] do pray for the rest of us yeah cuz I
[1:37:11] need more of all these myself now he's
[1:37:14] talking about the key of Faith which he
[1:37:16] preached it just a couple of nights
[1:37:17] before and he said So today we're going
[1:37:19] to try to take that same key to unlock
[1:37:22] the way to become now notice what we
[1:37:24] want to become a
[1:37:27] virtuous
[1:37:28] Christian in the stature of God not a
[1:37:32] Christian what he's not making an alder
[1:37:34] call for us to get
[1:37:36] saved but to
[1:37:38] become a
[1:37:41] virtuous
[1:37:43] Christian
[1:37:45] virtuous
[1:37:47] Christian you know when brother random
[1:37:49] started praying for the sick
[1:37:53] and it would make him really
[1:37:55] weak and early on in his ministry he
[1:38:00] said he just didn't understand why it
[1:38:03] would make him
[1:38:04] weak and a brother told him he said
[1:38:07] brother brandom he said that's virtue
[1:38:10] going out of you and he said well I I
[1:38:13] knew that was said about about Jesus but
[1:38:17] he said I didn't I didn't want to apply
[1:38:19] that to myself and the brother told me
[1:38:21] he said well when you're praying for the
[1:38:23] people strength is going out of your
[1:38:27] body to
[1:38:29] them now I'm sure that you've seen
[1:38:31] preachers before in the prayer line uh
[1:38:34] whenever you've been to different
[1:38:35] meetings and they could pray for a
[1:38:38] thousand and they're just as strong
[1:38:40] whenever they get done as they were when
[1:38:41] they
[1:38:43] started and there's others they may pray
[1:38:46] for 10 they may pray for 50 they may
[1:38:48] pray for a 100 and brother brand
[1:38:50] referring to this he said it really
[1:38:52] helped him to understand understand what
[1:38:54] was going on because it would pull this
[1:38:57] strength so much out of him and he
[1:38:59] really didn't even understand it now you
[1:39:02] see maybe you'll never be called to
[1:39:05] stand and pray in a prayer line and
[1:39:07] strengths go out of you but being a
[1:39:09] virtuous Christian is not just limited
[1:39:12] to a preacher but God wants every one of
[1:39:15] his sons and daughters to be virtuous
[1:39:17] Christian so what will it be then when
[1:39:20] these Seven Virtues Of The Divine nature
[1:39:24] so flow out of our life that it's not us
[1:39:28] trying to make ourself I need to be more
[1:39:31] Godly I need to have more faith I I need
[1:39:33] to have more virtue I need to do this I
[1:39:35] need to make myself it's us asking God
[1:39:39] to let it flow out of us by Nature now
[1:39:42] this has affected me this way praying
[1:39:44] for people for years and years and it
[1:39:46] actually helped me whenever I found that
[1:39:47] not long ago where brother Brown talked
[1:39:49] about it and I prayed for people in
[1:39:52] hundreds and thousands of of people down
[1:39:55] through the years in prayer lines and
[1:39:56] there's times that you can go and go and
[1:39:59] go and you're praying and you you know
[1:40:02] God's flowing out of there and the
[1:40:03] spirit of God is moving and one person
[1:40:06] will come through and it's hard to
[1:40:08] explain it but it's like that one person
[1:40:11] reaches inside of you and they take out
[1:40:14] nearly every bit of your strength and
[1:40:16] you feel like you're going to fall dead
[1:40:18] as a hammer right there on the platform
[1:40:20] and there'll be times that you'll feel
[1:40:22] little by little by little but according
[1:40:24] to the need of the individual is what
[1:40:28] seems to be able to really pull on you
[1:40:30] and you realize that as Sons and
[1:40:32] Daughters of God those of you that love
[1:40:35] one another that God may use you to talk
[1:40:37] to somebody in the church or a brother
[1:40:39] or sister or somebody in your family to
[1:40:41] try to encourage them because they're
[1:40:43] having a a low time or going through a
[1:40:45] difficult time and whenever you get done
[1:40:48] you think oh I'm exhausted y'all ever
[1:40:52] been there you ever been there talk to
[1:40:54] somebody you know didn't even have a
[1:40:56] pray line you just tried to talk to them
[1:40:58] oh my goodness I'm telling you the last
[1:41:00] few days I have had I don't know how
[1:41:02] many phone calls I'm talking about
[1:41:04] Canada different parts of the states
[1:41:06] hour and a half at a time two hours at a
[1:41:08] time and time I got off the phone
[1:41:10] yesterday my throat was so sore I could
[1:41:13] hardly talk and I felt like I was so
[1:41:17] depleted of my strength and my energy
[1:41:20] simply by hours of phone call but what
[1:41:23] is it virtue going out of you so does
[1:41:26] God just want that to be the pastor only
[1:41:28] no God wants us as a group of Believers
[1:41:33] to be so virtuous it might be a sinner
[1:41:35] out on the street it might be somebody
[1:41:38] lost that you work with and yet they've
[1:41:40] got a need and they bring it up and you
[1:41:42] go to talking to them and you feeling
[1:41:44] virtue going out oh I wish somebody
[1:41:47] would hear me today we don't want to be
[1:41:49] just the type of people that all of this
[1:41:52] is word and it's all quotes and it's all
[1:41:55] just up here in our head what good does
[1:41:57] it do us if it's only in our head we
[1:42:01] want to be virtuous
[1:42:04] Christians oh my notice he said oh help
[1:42:08] us Jesus a virtuous Christian in the
[1:42:11] stature of God uh notice what it's going
[1:42:14] to be to be a living Tabernacle for the
[1:42:19] Living God to dwell in now our blood our
[1:42:23] which come through by sexual desire
[1:42:25] brought our life in the world the blood
[1:42:27] of Jesus Christ cleanses us and changes
[1:42:31] our Nature by sending upon us the Holy
[1:42:34] Spirit then we become into the divine
[1:42:37] nature of God then we become a dwelling
[1:42:41] place for God so it's not just a baptism
[1:42:44] of the Holy Ghost it's not the anointing
[1:42:47] moving on us and making us do
[1:42:48] Supernatural things and that anointing
[1:42:50] leaving us it's a permanent re
[1:42:53] residence oh praise the Lord now the
[1:42:56] anointing does do that we know that the
[1:42:58] anointing comes upon us I don't just
[1:43:01] want to have the anointing I took care I
[1:43:03] was talking to someone on the phone
[1:43:04] yesterday and just talking talking been
[1:43:06] there for a long time and while I was
[1:43:08] speaking the spirit of God I was down in
[1:43:10] the basement been listening to a tape
[1:43:12] and the spirit of God come right down
[1:43:14] where I was at I hope you believe me and
[1:43:16] the spirit of God just like spoke right
[1:43:18] out of my mouth I said oh Lord have
[1:43:20] mercy and I was telling her the things
[1:43:22] that the Lord had said it was absolutely
[1:43:24] awesome I hope I get to preach it to you
[1:43:26] sometime but the spirit of God wants not
[1:43:29] only to use the pasture the spirit of
[1:43:31] God wants to use the sisters the spirit
[1:43:34] of God wants to use the young men and
[1:43:36] the young Brothers come on somebody to
[1:43:38] where you can be a tool by which God can
[1:43:41] encourage and God can uplift and God can
[1:43:45] use you to be able to minor I ain't
[1:43:48] talking about you taking a text now you
[1:43:50] sister putting your hand on your hip
[1:43:52] well glory to God Hallelujah you do that
[1:43:54] I'm going to set you down just a little
[1:43:56] heads up but God wants each of us to be
[1:43:59] so filled with his spirit and these
[1:44:02] virtues that people can know we are Sons
[1:44:06] and Daughters of God not just because
[1:44:08] our sisters wear skirts and they don't
[1:44:10] cut their hair and this and that we want
[1:44:12] to be known by our virtues as well as we
[1:44:16] are our outward
[1:44:19] dress oh my
[1:44:25] amen and we're supposed to do his work
[1:44:27] he that believeth on me he that
[1:44:30] believeth on me quotes St John 14:7 The
[1:44:33] Works that I do shall it do also you're
[1:44:36] beginning to reflect the works of Christ
[1:44:38] but listen this carefully but so many of
[1:44:41] us try to do the works of Christ before
[1:44:45] the
[1:44:46] reflection of
[1:44:48] Christ is in
[1:44:51] us there's the trouble we find these
[1:44:55] things happening you know what I know it
[1:44:57] we see these stumbles along the
[1:45:00] road we find the scrap
[1:45:03] heaps of Ministers of Christians piled
[1:45:07] along the road it's because they didn't
[1:45:10] go into it right that's why I'm here
[1:45:13] this morning is to try to teach this
[1:45:15] little church and
[1:45:20] myself don't you appreciate that I love
[1:45:23] a man of God that can stand there and

[1:45:44] teach this little this little church and
[1:45:47] myself how
[1:45:49] we can become the dwelling place of the
[1:45:53] Living
[1:45:55] God how many like to be
[1:46:00] that that Dwelling
[1:46:04] Place of the Living
[1:46:08] God do we want to just have this word in
[1:46:11] our head and we produce all types of
[1:46:14] arguments and debates and clicks and
[1:46:18] Clans and divisions and schisms Among Us
[1:46:24] or do we want to be Bible believing
[1:46:27] virtuous Holy Ghost fill
[1:46:30] Christians that people can disagree with
[1:46:32] you and actually hate you but from your
[1:46:37] heart you feel pity for them and you
[1:46:41] pray for
[1:46:43] them amen now we're talking about bride
[1:46:48] material Let Me Go a bit father can I
[1:46:50] have a few more minutes notice in ephes
[1:46:53] 4:8 wherefore he saith when he ascended
[1:46:56] up on high LED
[1:46:58] captivity
[1:47:00] captive and gave gifts unto
[1:47:04] men wherefor when he ascended up on
[1:47:07] high what did he do he led captivity
[1:47:10] captive emptied out paradise up
[1:47:12] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[1:47:15] men now he that ascended what is it but
[1:47:19] that he also descended first into the
[1:47:22] lower parts of the speaking of Jesus he
[1:47:24] that
[1:47:25] descended is the same also that ascended
[1:47:28] far above all the heavens that he might
[1:47:30] fulfill all things and he gave
[1:47:34] some now in verse eight he tells us that
[1:47:37] he gave gifts unto men now he's going to
[1:47:40] tell us what those gifts
[1:47:42] are and he gave some Apostles some
[1:47:46] prophets some evangelist and some
[1:47:49] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[1:47:54] of the Saints for the work of the
[1:47:57] ministry not plural but
[1:48:01] singular every godall man that's ever
[1:48:04] lived on the face of the
[1:48:06] Earth have partook of only one Ministry
[1:48:10] since acts the book of Acts came that's
[1:48:14] the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:48:17] himself notice now for the work of the
[1:48:19] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[1:48:22] Christ till we all come in the unity of
[1:48:24] the faith and of the knowledge of the
[1:48:27] Son of God unto a
[1:48:30] tius perfect
[1:48:33] man not human flawlessness now but
[1:48:37] perfect Age full age brought to its end
[1:48:43] finished wanting nothing
[1:48:47] necessary to
[1:48:49] completeness that which is perfect
[1:48:51] consummate human
[1:48:53] Integrity ah and
[1:48:56] virtue of men full grown adult a full
[1:49:03] age
[1:49:06] mature ever God call man that's what
[1:49:09] he's called to produce unto a perfect
[1:49:13] man unto the measure of the
[1:49:18] stature of the fullness of Christ so the
[1:49:20] word stature then refers to the growth
[1:49:23] of a man that which will be ultimately
[1:49:28] attained as it matches the
[1:49:32] measurement not of this preacher that
[1:49:35] preacher that preacher back there but
[1:49:38] the
[1:49:39] stature of Christ himself
[1:49:43] yeah notice this then you and
[1:49:46] I are not the standard our church is not
[1:49:50] the standard for the message amen praise
[1:49:54] the Lord this church and that church and
[1:49:56] the other church is not the standard for
[1:49:58] the message there's no certain preacher
[1:50:01] that is the standard that everybody is
[1:50:03] to be measured by him God has one
[1:50:07] measure and that measure is Christ
[1:50:10] Jesus now one of the reasons that people
[1:50:13] like to compare themselves to humans is
[1:50:16] they will always pick humans less than
[1:50:18] themselves or majority of them do less
[1:50:21] than than themselves so they can be
[1:50:23] greater than them but whenever we all
[1:50:26] compare ourselves to Lord Jesus there
[1:50:28] ain't none of us can brag about anything
[1:50:30] are
[1:50:32] they now look at the word that Paul used
[1:50:35] here it's a very strange word that he
[1:50:37] says the stature of the fullness of
[1:50:41] Christ and he said which is to fill up
[1:50:45] that which has been filled a ship in so
[1:50:48] much as it filled with Sailors rowers
[1:50:53] and
[1:50:54] soldiers in the New Testament the body
[1:50:56] of Believers is that which is filled
[1:50:58] with The Presence Power agency Riches of
[1:51:03] God and of Christ so Paul is speaking to
[1:51:08] the Ephesian church and even though
[1:51:10] they're one of the deepest churches in
[1:51:12] the New Testament he says look children
[1:51:15] you all are still like
[1:51:18] children and you need to come on up
[1:51:23] yes well let me speak to you this
[1:51:25] morning as your pastor who loves you
[1:51:28] with all of my heart and many ways I
[1:51:31] believe we are men but I believe in many
[1:51:35] ways we're still children yes we need to
[1:51:41] grow and notice I ain't saying you I
[1:51:44] said we we need to grow anybody in here
[1:51:47] be honest and raise your hand yes Lord I
[1:51:51] do so the perfect man reg refers to the
[1:51:55] man or woman that is grown up in Christ
[1:52:01] Jesus so Christ has appointed pastors
[1:52:05] and teachers that the infant Church
[1:52:09] might be conducted or ushered in to a
[1:52:13] stage of maturity so you can see why
[1:52:16] preachers want Satan becomes they become
[1:52:19] a tool if they're not careful that Satan
[1:52:21] wants to get on them
[1:52:23] and cause them to argue and fuss and
[1:52:25] debate and this one preaches his service
[1:52:28] against that preacher over there then
[1:52:29] that preacher hears it by Wednesday and
[1:52:31] then that preacher takes his text
[1:52:33] against that preacher over there and
[1:52:35] then they just go back and forth back
[1:52:36] and forth back and forth I've got better
[1:52:38] things to preach on today than message
[1:52:41] preachers oh yeah I refer to them but
[1:52:44] I'll tell you one thing I don't figure
[1:52:45] y'all come here today to hear me talk
[1:52:47] about me I don't think y'all come here
[1:52:50] today to hear me run down this man or
[1:52:52] that man I think you all come here to
[1:52:54] hear tell me what I can do to be a
[1:52:56] better man brother Donnie tell me what I
[1:52:58] can do to be a better young person a a a
[1:53:01] a better daughter of God tell me man of
[1:53:04] God bring something that will edify
[1:53:09] me that way henceforth be no more
[1:53:13] children tossed to and fro and carried
[1:53:16] about with every wind of
[1:53:19] Doctrine there's no way you're going to
[1:53:21] convince me that all the Mage folks
[1:53:23] still ain't
[1:53:24] children we've had too many brides
[1:53:27] revivals Among Us and some of the same
[1:53:29] people that was a part of this revival
[1:53:31] wind up being a part of the same one
[1:53:32] years later and they go from one move to
[1:53:35] another to another to another you know
[1:53:37] why their search for the Messiah has not
[1:53:41] stopped they're still searching for a
[1:53:45] messiah well let me tell you today maybe
[1:53:47] you are I am not I have found him or
[1:53:51] better stated he has found me that's
[1:53:53] right I'm not looking for a superhero
[1:53:56] preacher now it's something in our
[1:53:58] makeup why do you think Superman went
[1:54:00] over so good why do you think Batman
[1:54:02] went over so good Catwoman went over so
[1:54:05] good why is it that our kids start out
[1:54:07] Disney movies and this and that and the
[1:54:09] other and they're looking for
[1:54:11] superheroes Hercules and whatever men
[1:54:14] that are nothing of fiction there's
[1:54:15] something about a human being that looks
[1:54:18] for a superhero well let me tell you
[1:54:20] about one the only one ever existed his
[1:54:23] name is not Hercules his name is not
[1:54:26] Samson his name is not David his name is
[1:54:29] not Donnie his name is not Tim or Ron or
[1:54:32] D or any other human being his name is
[1:54:35] the Lord Jesus Christ amen he's the only
[1:54:40] superhero that you can put your trust in
[1:54:43] and he will never let you down all other
[1:54:46] men will fail you all other men will
[1:54:49] disappoint you he is the TR the only the
[1:54:53] one superhero that will change our lives
[1:54:58] forever let's stand at our feet let's
[1:55:01] give him a
[1:55:02] hand oh come on let's give him a
[1:55:12] hand oh my let me jump down here to
[1:55:15] Ephesians
[1:55:17] 4:15 but speaking the
[1:55:20] truth in love
[1:55:23] so
[1:55:24] apparently people can speak
[1:55:28] truth and it not be in
[1:55:31] love or Paul would have never said it
[1:55:33] this
[1:55:34] way but speaking the
[1:55:37] truths in love may
[1:55:42] grow
[1:55:44] up
[1:55:46] into
[1:55:48] him now remember when brother Brandon
[1:55:50] preaches the statue of a perfect
[1:55:52] man he brought a drawing to church that
[1:55:56] day and put it up on a bulletin
[1:55:59] board and it was the seven Church ages
[1:56:02] and the Seven
[1:56:03] Messengers and then the Seven Virtues
[1:56:06] that he was preaching so he refers to it
[1:56:08] several
[1:56:10] times in his in his sermon
[1:56:13] there and he says that God did not
[1:56:16] require and he would point to one of
[1:56:18] those ages and he would say God did not
[1:56:21] require of this this age what he did of
[1:56:24] this one which was one above it and God
[1:56:27] not did not require of this and what he
[1:56:29] did with this one but it just so happens
[1:56:31] you and I are living at the very
[1:56:37] top and guess what God
[1:56:40] requires every
[1:56:46] word every
[1:56:47] word and there ain't a one of us here
[1:56:50] today that can do that with without
[1:56:52] divine nature being deposited in our
[1:56:56] soul and even when that's there that
[1:56:58] battle will still
[1:57:00] rage because
[1:57:02] remember there's 2third of you that's
[1:57:06] against
[1:57:07] you your spirit and your
[1:57:11] body so you're a Triune being the
[1:57:14] onethird the soul the gene is the part
[1:57:17] that's been born again the other two
[1:57:20] parts of you is not yet
[1:57:23] converted now remember he said that when
[1:57:25] you die your spirit breaks up you don't
[1:57:28] have a spirit in the theophany you don't
[1:57:31] have a spirit in eternity you were
[1:57:34] supposed to been C gen soul theophany
[1:57:38] and glorified body but human Spirit was
[1:57:42] substituted to you God knowing the fall
[1:57:44] would come but your spirit one day
[1:57:48] breaks up when you die and if you're
[1:57:51] alive and remaining then you take the
[1:57:55] soul to meet the
[1:57:57] theophany then you get the glorified
[1:58:00] body so in eternity it will be you the
[1:58:03] attribute you the theophany you the
[1:58:07] glorified
[1:58:09] body but right
[1:58:12] now this is
[1:58:14] you and these other two ain't you but
[1:58:19] they look like
[1:58:20] you yeah and they want to convince you
[1:58:24] that they are
[1:58:27] you and this is what you all have
[1:58:29] arguments with in amongst the church
[1:58:32] people their two against your two oh
[1:58:38] wow you husbands and wives when you get
[1:58:41] into them friendly disagreements it's
[1:58:44] her two against your
[1:58:47] two now I know y'all going to stand your
[1:58:49] NE like you're a bunch of angels all
[1:58:51] right but if you do that I'm going to
[1:58:52] tell you that might be the kind that
[1:58:53] wears rides motorcycles and wears
[1:58:55] leather
[1:58:58] jackets what we're longing for
[1:59:01] friends is our
[1:59:04] Trinity to fully be changed
[1:59:10] amen Carol and I was coming to church
[1:59:13] this morning right up the road here
[1:59:16] we're about 12 minutes away something
[1:59:17] like that and I told her I said look at
[1:59:19] her and I was talking about the Earth
[1:59:22] I said she's
[1:59:24] pitiful Barren gray
[1:59:29] cold there's some Woods there behind my
[1:59:32] house there and I was looking for a tree
[1:59:34] the other day I doing a little bit of
[1:59:35] taxidermic work so I went down to my
[1:59:36] Woods there looking for a
[1:59:38] tree that I can make a tree out
[1:59:42] of so I got down over the hills about 10
[1:59:45] degrees something like that and went
[1:59:47] down over the hill and look around and I
[1:59:48] got down in there I knew there's several
[1:59:50] there and that was was a big massive
[1:59:54] tree that had fallen years ago L there
[1:59:58] rotten
[1:59:59] decayed couldn't use
[2:00:02] that then there was a younger tree that
[2:00:05] was laying there that I'm not sure what
[2:00:07] happened to it but about that Big
[2:00:09] R then there's another one laying over
[2:00:12] here and it was about the size of my
[2:00:14] finger tens of thousands of leaves
[2:00:17] laying all over the whole whole forest
[2:00:19] floor so debris and Rock
[2:00:23] Ness just everywhere I told her said
[2:00:26] look at this coming to church I said
[2:00:28] told her about the story going into the
[2:00:29] woods I I looked at I thought you that's
[2:00:32] the way there some people 80 90
[2:00:34] something like that they get able to
[2:00:35] live their life some people goes it's
[2:00:37] babies some people go in their 30s some
[2:00:39] in their 20s yet they're laying across
[2:00:41] the face of the Earth
[2:00:44] dead but they were not meant to be that
[2:00:48] way neither was I meant to constantly
[2:00:51] have to
[2:00:52] content was myself
[2:00:56] yeah you were not meant to have this war
[2:01:00] within
[2:01:02] you day in and day out how many knows
[2:01:04] what I'm talking
[2:01:06] about we were meant to enjoy life and
[2:01:09] see good days and every day be good not
[2:01:12] a good day and then three bad and then
[2:01:14] one good and then four bad and you know
[2:01:16] a good half a day and then the rest of
[2:01:17] the day bad we never meant to have that
[2:01:22] I believe it's coming don't
[2:01:26] you I don't know how much longer I've
[2:01:28] got in this
[2:01:29] life but I want to give everything that
[2:01:32] I have for God and for his people I was
[2:01:36] talking to a friend of mine this week
[2:01:37] from Canada he's a pastor of a church
[2:01:40] there associate pastor and he he was
[2:01:44] talking about the pastor brother there
[2:01:45] and um he's a friend of mine I preached
[2:01:48] for him a few times he's want me to come
[2:01:49] back up there now this pastor
[2:01:52] this brother he's been preaching for
[2:01:54] many many
[2:01:55] years and he's 95 years
[2:01:58] old preaches two times a week and
[2:02:02] preaches like a fire
[2:02:04] brand and I said man that is absolutely
[2:02:06] awesome so he's just telling me this
[2:02:07] it's this younger brother's daddy in-law
[2:02:09] and he was just telling me I thought man
[2:02:11] that is so
[2:02:12] wonderful but then brother Daddy I had
[2:02:14] some negative thoughts and I thought 95
[2:02:18] so does that mean I've got to preach so
[2:02:20] I'm 95
[2:02:24] I hope we ain't here that
[2:02:26] long what are we waiting for what are we
[2:02:30] looking for so president Trump become
[2:02:34] the
[2:02:37] president is that going to change
[2:02:39] everything oh the United States is in a
[2:02:42] golden age when they cry peace and
[2:02:45] safety then sudden destruction comes
[2:02:47] upon them as travail upon the woman
[2:02:52] he's not my
[2:02:54] hope I'm looking for a trump all right
[2:02:57] but it's the last Trump when the Trump
[2:03:00] shall sound and the dead in Christ shall
[2:03:02] rise first amen don't you want to be
[2:03:06] ready
[2:03:07] friends can we bow our heads
[2:03:10] together brother Aaron can we sing this
[2:03:13] is your
[2:03:15] house now remember we built this place
[2:03:18] and dedicated it to God it was much
[2:03:20] easier for us to do
[2:03:23] we dedicate it to God if any of us are
[2:03:25] alive it'll never be used for nothing
[2:03:27] else but what about our house our
[2:03:31] building we give it to God and then we
[2:03:33] take it back we give it to God and we
[2:03:35] take it
[2:03:36] back how many wants to be able to
[2:03:39] surrender all that you are you want them
[2:03:42] not just be a Christian not just a
[2:03:44] message follower but a virtuous
[2:03:48] Christian you see friends I ain't
[2:03:50] talking about your virt my virtue we'll
[2:03:53] go on brother B talks about it but he
[2:03:54] says it's the faith of Jesus Christ The
[2:03:56] Virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge of
[2:03:58] Jesus Christ The Temperance of Jesus
[2:04:01] Christ the godliness this is what it is
[2:04:04] it's him it's him and
[2:04:08] US Lord Jesus if we have our heads bowed
[2:04:11] to the dust of the
[2:04:14] earth and whence our bodies are taken
[2:04:16] and one day they'll return back to
[2:04:20] that Lord as we've sat in your presence
[2:04:24] today there have been somber moments
[2:04:26] there have been lighter
[2:04:28] moments now we come to the time of deep
[2:04:32] consideration and
[2:04:35] thought Lord as we read about
[2:04:37] Judas he went to his
[2:04:40] place Pharaoh went to
[2:04:44] his the Bible says that Abraham died and
[2:04:48] was gathered with his people
[2:04:52] Isaac died and was gathered with his
[2:04:54] people Jacob died and was gathered with
[2:05:00] his so does every man and woman boy and
[2:05:03] girl when they die as we say deaths they
[2:05:07] are gathered with their people kind
[2:05:10] after
[2:05:12] kind so Lord we pray that You' help
[2:05:17] us to choose our people correct
[2:05:23] ly Lord as I said we built this place
[2:05:26] here for the glory and the honor of
[2:05:29] God Wednesday night was preaching about
