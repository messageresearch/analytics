Bibles this morning turn with us to the book of 2 Corinthians I want to read from 2 Corinthians chapter 6 starting at verse 10 and then also we like to read from Genesis 22 verse1 15 greet you the

grateful for all that he done for us in 23 and looking forward to what he'll do for us in 24 amen amen amen 2 Corinthians chap 6: 10 do you love him yeah praise the Lord praise the Lord the Bible says this as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things Genesis 22:15 and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and and he said by myself have I sworn saeth the Lord for because thou Hast done this thing and Hast not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as of sand which is upon the seashore if you've ever been there that's quite a lot and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies amen and in thy seed shall not could be not hope so not maybe but shall all the nations of the earth be blessed why because thou Hast obeyed my voice amen may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word I want to speak to you for a few minutes this morning on This Means War I want to take a context out of that of professing what we are possessing professing what we are possessing let us bow our heads Heavenly Father we bow in your wonderful presence this morning we thank you Lord for who you are we thank you Lord for the Revelation that you have given us in this hour when men are staggering in darkness yet you by Your Grace has given us light Lord and we thank you for that and I pray Lord that you would take this simple thought because really father it's the only kind I can preach but Lord I pray that you'd take it to the heart of every person here this morning that we could realize dear God not not what we're going to be but what we are now for Lord God we are the sons and daughters of the most high God and ever Redemptive blessing has been given to us and we're HS and join HS with Jesus Christ father God I pray in this coming year may we rise to the challenge Lord and claim that which belongs to us and war with our enemy until Victory is in every camp and in every home bless your children today Lord Heal those that are sick and Afflicted this viruses and things that's going around God may you just move upon your children Lord and father you see the the weather that they're calling that's coming in I ask your protection Upon Our People people dear God and bring us safely through the storms bless brother Donnie and his family today Lord as he tries to get some rest bless your little bride Around The World God when we leave this building may we safe did not our hearts burn within us as you walked and talked with us along the way we commit these things into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name and the saint says amen God bless you you may be seated thank you buddy appreciate it well praise the Lord praise the Lord now we understand by our scripture readings in verse 17 and verse 18 that Abraham is the father of the faithful and we are hirs to the promise through Christ now Abraham was just an ordinary Man actually one time Abraham was an idol worshipper right sir but what does that tell us about God it tells us that we serve a God who has transforming power now transforming means it is the ability to bring about a dramatic change and we serve a god this morning with transforming power he can transform a drunk and make a preacher out of him he can transform a street Harlot and make her a lady he can transform bitter water and make it sweet amen he could transform a sinner to a saint he can transform the world when it was dark and void and without form and make a garden of Eden out of it how by the transforming power of the almighty God the prophet said that's the transforming power of God that he can take something that's nothing and make something wonderful out of it God's transforming power they ain't got no mouth they ain't got no vocal cords and yet he said if these hold their peace these rocks will cry out how can the rocks cry out but you've got to remember that God is the creator of the rocks and when you have the power to create you can make your creation do what you want it to do amen oh Hallelujah and God by his transforming power is going to take these old frail bellies of ours one day and transform into young men and women again and you young people sitting here you will not be cheated but God by his transforming power is going to transfer you from youth to Eternal youth Oh Glory to God that's the power of my God this morning amen and we understand by the Bible that Abraham wasn't looking for God yes sir but God came looking for Abraham and as Abraham seed we can sit here this morning and say the same thing when Adam the first son was lost who come looking for Adam who come looking for him God did then who comes looking for every lost son God does you see I never sought God but it was always God seeking me it was always God seeking you because God by his for knowledge knew that Abraham would believe him when he spoke so God sought out Abraham because he knew he would believe him and God salts you out God had a purpose the prophet said that he hid it from The Eyes Of The Prudent and the wise and revealed it to predestinated babes who are predestinated to receive it do you hear that this morning why am you setting in this building today why are you believing this message today why did Brother Joel sing what he sung today because God predestinated you to receive this message and as they come looking for Rahab God come looking for you amen God said because you have obeyed my voice amen let that be said of us let us be like Abraham that we never doubt God when he speaks amen he said because you've obeyed my voice I by myself have sworn because there's none greater to swear by amen when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by none greater he swore by himself saying thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies not maybe not hope so not could be but shall and shall in the Bible is used it indicates a commandment or an obligation this shall it's an obligation it's a commandment you know like let there be light it's a commandment Hallelujah repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall it's a commandment you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost oh glory be to God when you obey God's word you get God's results amen amen I like this the prophet said Abraham was aired to All by the promise so he could lay claim to everything that was in the land and the land itself Abraham been given the promise now we understand Abraham was the poorest man in all the country because he lived out in the desert and he lived in peace with God and lot was rich and lived in the city and become the governor of the city he sat in the gate he was a judge and judged the city he had all the riches and all things but Abraham was in the desert and perhaps the poorest man in the land yet he claimed to possess it all oh my you may not be be rich in the world's Goods but we possess all things the church itself possesses all things amen say that with me the church possesses all things the church possesses all things hallelujah oh God let that sink into our souls this morning that's more than just a quote that's a reality of what God has promised us the church my church my body is a possessor of all things oh my oh my the prophet said what can I do what can I say I say this my friend to every one of you every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ every person in here every person in here was healed when Jesus died at calary there you go it's your possession amen every person in in this building has already been healed than well I don't feel it he didn't say did you feel it he said did you believe it maybe if you believe it you might start feeling it all right hallelujah amen every person in here was healed when Jesus died at Calvary then I say it's time we profess what we possess we're all the time talking down and blue and negative and this and that oh my but if we could change our language the Bible said out of your own mouth you'll be justified and out of your own mouth you'll be condemned you'll find out one day your greatest enemy is yourself oh but let this New Year let it be a new language Let It Be a new talk let it be a new profession I am an overcomer I am victorious I am a Son of God I am the Bride of Jesus Christ I am going in a Rapture how my daddy said so hallelujah amen it's time we profess what we possess everyone who's a Christian raise your hand even if you're asleep wake up raise your hand raise your hand now the prophet said I ask you to raise your hand who was a Christian your hands went up everywhere you who are a Christian you have a legal right ain't Brother Don been preaching on the bride's Bill of Rights you have a legal right to everything that Jesus died for he died his death there at the cross and gave his life that you might have the legal rights to every Redemptive blessing he died for it's yours you're just afraid to possess it profess what we possess amen hallelujah it's time that we realize who we are and what's been given to us amen I wonder sometimes if we're not poor because we choose to be yes come on well Glory one day the Gentile Kings declared war and they went and took lock Abraham's nephew took him and Lot's wife and children took him down into the country and the Bible says in Genesis 14 that when Abraham heard that his brother was taken captive and the prophet said brother I like that his brother said look at what lot had done to him but yet there was some kind of a tie that binds and no matter what he had done to him he was still a brother oh God let us grow up that no matter what someone does to us if they draw us out no matter what he had done to him he was still his brother and when he got into trouble Abraham reacted Abraham went to get him there was something that tied them together look we not agree on everything if we talk long enough I'm sure we won't but that don't mean we're not brothers let's just love one another God will work it out amen it's like gono when he was on the train and one of the one of the the the scouts who had went out and track Jon on them down and brought them in and they placed them all under arrest that's the way the government does you they placed all of them under arrest even the ones that we found jono put them all on the same train s them down down here to Florida and on the train one of his Warriors it's in jono's autobiography You' never choose to read it and one of them spoke up to one of jono's warrior one of dro Warriors spoke up to one of these guys who tracked them down he said I hate you as long as there's breath in my body I'll hate you so why didn't you leave us alone we were serving the Creator God gave us this land we was living the way he made us why did you track us down I'll hate you as long as there's bre I hate you and they said j a few of us left to hate one another we are the minority in this world come on somebody the world hates us but let us unite oursel together in the bonds of love we are brothers in the cross Hallelujah when AB heard his brother was in trouble taking captive they weren Warriors they didn't know Kung Fu they didn't no Battle Tactics 318 farmers went down after these Kings who had lot in his family 318 Farmers against these Kings and their armies why would a bunch of farmers being led by Abraham go up against a bunch of Kings with all their armies what made Abraham so sure that he could win this this battle I'm not talking about he took he didn't take special forces he didn't take Navy Seals he got a man out of the Wheatfield but why was he so sure that he could win God because Abraham had a revelation that God had given him the land and all that was in it and he acted on his belief that what God he acted on the world he was a possessor of the Gate of his enemies because God said so he wasn't relying upon the 318 Farmers he wasn't relying upon the pitchforks he was trusting in The God Who made the promise and let me say this morning I'm not relying upon my ability I'm not relying upon my education but I'm relying upon the God who made the promise amen hallelujah I'm not trusting in my ability I'm trusting in my God who cannot fail and Abraham went after his nephew and he went after what belonged to him because he was a possessor of all that was in the land what a revelation remember him said Abraham had a right to the promise and the promise was his and you have a right to the promise and the promise is yours yet he had to fight to possess it there's where the rub comes in it's easy to say I believe it but it's something else to put legs on your belief amen cuz remember the devil believes and trembles he ain't going nowhere come on somebody he had to fight to possess it the prophet said there you are the believer today uh that be us the believer today yet we're air to all things we're air to every spiritual every physical blessing every blessing the bible promises yet you have to fight for every inch of it amen that's the way God he's got it set up it's always been that way you have to fight to possess what you know is your own you have to fight to possess it and that's what you've got to do now and I say God give us strength to fight to possess what we already own am let the fight start let the fight start by professing what the word says is ours am every fight has to start somewhere then let it start with this by standing up and professing what the word says I am amen hallelujah amen Abraham returned from the slaughter of the Kings and the king of Sodom told him to take the SPs and Abraham said yet I'll not take a thread to a Sho latch the prophet said he didn't fight the war to make a lot of money and real true battles are not made with selfish motives Wars are not thought for money Wars are thought for motives and for principles men fight War for principles and when Abraham went out to get lost he didn't go out there because he knew he could whip the Kings and take their possessions that's not why he went out there because he knew he could whoop them and take what was theirs but he went out there for this principle to save his Fallen brother he went out there with the motive I've got to save my brother Hallelujah and any Minister that sent out the inspiration of the king of heaven will not go for money neither will he go to make big churches neither will he go to inspire denominations he'll go for one principle and that is to bring back his Fallen brother and I come to this service this morning with this principle to war with the devil not to get a name not for popularity but to get my Fallen brother the one Satan that has tied down and say Satan loose him and let him go that young person that the Devils tormented their mind to loose them from that battle to go get our young to get our old to get our fathers to get our mothers Hallelujah to fight for what's ours to stand for what's right let the world laugh at us you think I'm really concerned to what they think about me when their hair's 15 different colors and they can't even go out in the thunderstorm because of the metal they've got in their head come on somebody wor what the world thinks about us I Ain care what they think about me what does God say about us hallelujah this thought I was getting old I feel real good good right there Solomon said there's a Time For Peace and there's a time for war there's nothing wrong with fighting amen if you're fighting for the right principle yes sir I preached one time on jono the heart of a warrior and somebody come to me and said I didn't think Christians were supposed to fight I said well maybe you're not but I'm going to fight for what's mine amen there's nothing wrong with fighting if you're fighting for the right principle BR Bri said I was reading at Tombstone the other day in the museum and I saw a picture of gono said many of you might think that jono was a renegade but to me he was a genuine American he was only fighting for that which was right that God had given him a land and a nation and a place to live he wasn't fighting for a name he wasn't fighting for popularity he was fighting for what God gave him he said when those white soldiers come in there and by force taking over the land killing them out like a bunch of flies so there was the original picture of donos medical headquarters or his Hospital said it was two or three blankets over a piece of mosquite and them wounded real genuine American Indians fighting for their god-given rights and there jono with the baby of his own on his hip standing there looking upon his own Warriors bleeding and dying with no penicillin or nothing no way to help them genuine god-given American that's right then you call him a renegade he said I call him a gentleman fighting for something that God gave him a land and a nation and a place to live and let me say this morning we're not warn for selfish motives but Satan has took some of our possession and it's time for the Seed of Abraham to rise up and get back what belongs to us declare war on hell and its demons well the devil's been after me all week it's time we go after [Applause] him come on somebody This Means War you need to let the devil know you can't have my family you can't have my health you can't have my increase This Means War you want to fight will fight brother bam said the American Indian lost this land because they were divided among themselves Satan's tactic is always to divide and conquer that's what he's trying to do right now divide us over race lines vaccination lines whether preachers should preach or not lines come on somebody always trying to divide always trying to conquer but I say Seed of Abraham let's unite ourselves on the Promises of God's word still spend over our time arguing What We can't agree on let's stand on what we can agree on got to work the rest of it out we are the Seed of Abraham through the promise God swore to Abraham that thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies you said brother Bram I need healing the promise is yours I'm going to tell you that you're going to have to take it away from Satan Satan captures your health you've got a right to go to Satan and say give it back hand it over I come in the name of the Lord the possessor of heavens and earth and I am his Heir oh god oh I love this message give it back Satan you took my child you got him mixed up with the wrong boy took my boy mixed him up with the wrong girl I claim them that's right I claim my children I claim my brother I claim my sister took them from God's house you COA them out there but I'm coming after them I claim them well how do you know how do you know it's going to work because I'm an heir of all things amen it's given to me I'm an heir and Joint air with Jesus Christ you know what a joint air means it means whatever Christ gets you get do you hear me whatever the father gave Jesus that's what he gives you because we are joint a that's why he said you're bone of my bone your Flesh of My Flesh your spirit of my [Applause] spirit Oh Glory to God I can claim them I can claim everything that God promised me I can claim it everything that God promised me I can claim it everything that God promised me I can claim it that's right well let me ask you how much are you claiming just enough to get back to church on Wednesday we can live above that we can go into 24 man when I was little my mama kept calling me Daryl you know why cuz that was my name you know why she kept calling me Daryl so that I would know what my name was do you know why we keep hearing these quotes you know why Brother D keeps preaching these things you know why the preachers keep preaching these things God wants you to know we've got to come to the realization this is who I am look beyond what you see in the mirror amen I can claim everything that God's promised me I can claim my health I can claim my Revival I can claim my victory serve notice on the devil you're not getting my children fighting tooth and nail if he knocks your teeth out G him to death when Abraham offered up Isaac in Genesis 22161 17 he said thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy you get it the prophet said the natural seat of Abraham was Isaac so through Isaac the seed of Isaac we find out they did possess the Gate of their enemies it's in the Bible through the natural lineage of Abraham God kept his promise through the natural Seed of Abraham they possessed the Gate of their enemy Joshua possessed the gate is that not true but said God's given every sick person in here Divine Healing God's given every sick person in here Divine Healing every one of you well my case is too bad every one of you the doctor says it's no hope every one of [Music] you Jesus was wounded for our transgressions if his stripes were healed it's yours but you'll have to fight for every inch you possess but everywhere The Souls of your feet travel God told Joshua I've given you Footprints me possession let's move in let's go in Footprints is possession let's take every inch of ground that God's give us if you haven't got the baptism of the Holy Ghost Peter said the promises to you and to your children to them as far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call Footprints is possession let's go get it it's ours Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever let's possess it the works I do shall you do also let's possess it I shall give you the gift of the Holy Ghost let's possess it every devil is under your feet let's possess it you're not going down you're going up let's POS let's possess it they are a god-given rights it's God's promise don't look at the circumstances don't look at how hard it is don't look at the storm see the sun that's so in am man I've took off the many of time out of Tri Cities or out of Charlotte or out of Atlanta and it be dark and cloudy and thunder and and lightning matter of fact I flew out of Amsterdam one time and lightning struck the plane but as soon as you break above the storm you know what's up there the sun and the storm you're facing right now it's you can break beyond that cloud the sun is there he's always been there don't look at the storm look at the sun let's possess the land the prophet said we have a meeting like this this morning when we're having a meeting here and Holy Ghost falling in the place people screaming and shouting and praising the Lord then someone come up and say pray for me brother Brenham and I lay hands on him and pray for him he said now go and believe now here's what it is it's easy to feel the power of God to see it when you believe but then when it comes to The Showdown are you able to possess the thing that you profess that you have all right amen nothing wrong with shouting and running the aisles I enjoy that it's easier to preach When people's on their feet helping you instead of looking at their watch wondering when you're going to quit amen but when the shouting is done and the screaming is done and the running's done I want to possess what made me shout I want to possess what made me run that's the thing of it brother the prophet say we've got to get it you've got to take it it's ours but you have to fight for every inch can we possess what we Pro process possess what we profess josph fought for every inch of ground from one end of the country to the other the prophet said but he had a promise God said I give it to to you whether there's Giants whether there's atheists whether there's infidels cold formal churches what difference does it make God give the promise let's take it it's ours it belongs to us it's our possession let's go get it don't be afraid don't stay back and say oh I don't know don't do that don't do that if you mix Faith with doubts you've got nothing I'd rather be found believing when it happens than it happened and be found not believing it amen don't do that he said don't do that well I don't know brother d i don't the doctor said don't do that thank God for doctors but doctors can be wrong but God's always [Applause] right the doctors told me Jessica never see again but she does they said she'll never walk again but she does they said she never speak again but oh boy she does the things they said they was telling me what the MRI was saying but I was telling them what IAI was [Music] [Applause] saying let's take the land declare war on Satan go get back what he stoed from you the Hebrew children possessed the Gate of the fiery furnace it couldn't even burn them Daniel possessed the Gate of the lon's mouth it couldn't even eat him Samson one time was caught and a bunch of people had him fed in and what did he do he went out there and picked the gates of the city up I think they weighed a ton and a half a piece my God that would have tore the senine plum loose from the muscle there's no way natural muscle could have ever picked that much up he would have ripped his muscle I've seen people do it in surgery come in picking up a tu before they tear their tend and they have to have surgery to repair it and here's a man picked up each gate three tons of 12 on the hill and shut them down said you boys want your Gates come up here and get them well that's what you need the devil you need to rip up his gate say boy you want it come and get [Applause] it why could he do that how could a man do that the prophet said he was a the prophet said he was a mama's boy one place he called him a shrimp how could he do knew it because he had a covenant he had a covenant with his God amen amen as I've said before God don't need something big he just needs something yielded well when I get big I'll do something for God you can do it now if you'll just yield to him amen certainly all these died fine Warriors of the faith they all died every one of them the natural Seed of Abraham possessing the Gate of the enemy God keeping his promise but I'm thinking of another seed one Jesus Christ The Royal Seed of Abraham and what did this seed do he took all the gates of the enemy he took the gates of sickness it could not exist in his presence neither could anything else exist in his presence a funeral possession could not stand in his presence what did he do Joshua died Moses died all the rest of them died but not this Royal seed death could not stand where life was the woman the widow woman whose son was dead he stopped the funeral possession raised the boy from dead he gave gyrus his daughter back to him Lazareth was dead four days his nose done caved in but he said Lazarus come forth what did he do he broke the seals of everything his precious Soul descended into hell where I ought to have went but on that third day Samson take the gat in the city on his back had nothing to do with this he took the Gates of Hell the gates of the grave and everything else he didn't pack it up on a mountain but he destroyed it Hallelujah he possessed the Gate of the enemy the atmospheres that were filled with Devil's powers above the Angels or nothing else could come down there could be no intercession because the blood of goats could not take away sin but his own blood took away the sin and he ascended on high LED captive captive and gave gifts unto men now everyone of Abraham's seed everyone of Abraham's seed everyone of Abraham's seed that's willing to pay the price to come down to repent of their sins be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ receive the Holy Ghost and stand the test Seed of Abraham and when he come he possessed every gate the Gate of sickness the Gate of death the Gate of Hell the Gate of Temptation the Gate of the Grave he possessed every gate and freely gives it to us and makes us more than conquerors through him that loved us and gave himself for us he ha made us more than conquerors This Means War This Means War start professing what you're possessing this year you need to tell Satan Satan you're under my feet amen you may not recognize me now Satan but I've been looking into the word of God I found out who the word says I really am you know there's a I keep think of the guy's name I think it's Burl but don't hold me to that but he's a award-winning native am American fluk player from New Jersey from a Jewish family now why would a Jew be an award-winning Native American fluk player you see one day someone come to New Jersey and knocked on this man's door and when he open the door this person proceeded to tell this boy I come to tell you who you really are he was adopted found out his real Heritage Oh Glory when he found out what his DNA was you see that ability to play was always there but it was hidden because he didn't know who he was but when he started relaxing into what he really was and he went back to the native roots he went back to the red path and the sacred ways and the elders Hallelujah he began to play flute music because it was in him all the time you see it was the opening of the book that revealed his true identity and we're living in the a friends we're not preaching from a closed book the book has been opened and what do you see you see yourself like the little boy looking in the mirror mama that's me amen do you love you land this is my promise I'm an heir sir yes or do you love him stand with me this morning stand with me musicians come amen oh God help us in this coming year to get more into the word of God to believe what the prophet says not to lean so much on our emotions and on our feelings but to take What God Says to start professing in what we're possessing to remind the devil what he's what God has already given us to tell him you're under my feet to tell him you have no hold on me that's right to tell him if I resist you you must flee for [Applause] [Music] me need to tell him your demons have lost your lies have failed I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God I am an overcomer amen samgar could stand there that day when 600 Philistines come in he could stand there that day and say I am the Seed of Abraham and if samard could think that being the natural Seed of Abraham what about you who are the Royal Seed of Abraham you may think I'm crazy the prophet said but I feel better this way than I did the other the Royal Seed of Abraham the church is the Royal promise seed yes and if the natural seed could take that much courage if the natural seed could take that much courage and stand against 600 Philistines with just an ox goope what don't you and I do this morning the Royal seed with the presence of the Holy Ghost anointing us and showing himself among us hallelujah we ought to put every devil a flight we ought to run every demon out of this building this is our land this is our this is our promise amen God hallelujah you may not be rich in the world's Goods but we possess all things the church itself
