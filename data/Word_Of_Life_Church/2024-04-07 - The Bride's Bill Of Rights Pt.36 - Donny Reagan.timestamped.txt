[40:55] would to the Song of Solomon chapter
[40:59] 5 while you're turning there the um

[41:55] one and this is her in verse
[41:58] two I
[42:00] sleep but my heart waketh I sleep but my
[42:05] heart
[42:06] WTH it is the voice of my
[42:10] beloved that knocketh isn't that
[42:13] strange a voice would
[42:17] knock it is the voice of my beloved that
[42:22] knocketh saying open to me my sister
[42:28] my love my
[42:30] Dove my
[42:32] undefiled for my head is filled with Dew
[42:35] and my locks with the drops of the night
[42:38] I've put off my coat she says how shall
[42:42] I put it
[42:43] on I washed my
[42:46] feet how shall I defile
[42:50] them my beloved put his hand by the hole
[42:54] of the door and my bows removed for
[42:59] him we're going to pray together and may
[43:01] let it be remembered today as we go
[43:03] before the Lord just hold your request
[43:05] in your
[43:06] heart Heavenly Father we count it again
[43:09] a privilege and an honor that we could
[43:11] be here today in your house and your
[43:15] presence realizing Lord Jesus that one
[43:19] day we're all going to stand before you
[43:22] and when we do we will not stand there
[43:24] as a church we will not even stand there
[43:27] as a family we will stand there as an
[43:31] individual what we've done how we've
[43:34] lived the way we've reacted to your word
[43:38] we will all face that
[43:40] again we will have no lawyer that can
[43:43] come and plead for us there'll be no
[43:46] mother that will shed tears of
[43:49] compassion there'll be no father that
[43:52] would try to stand between us in your
[43:54] judgment it would just be us in you so I
[43:59] pray that you'd help each of us to come
[44:01] to that realization today that one day
[44:04] this God that we pray to that we sing
[44:06] about that we worship one day we will
[44:08] either meet him in peace or in Discord
[44:12] we desire to meet you in peace Father we
[44:16] believe that you've made a way for us
[44:17] that we can while we're in this life in
[44:19] this journey be able to settle all
[44:21] things with you and meet you peacefully
[44:24] on that day take your word speak to us
[44:28] you saw the hands that were uplifted
[44:30] signified many different needs only you
[44:33] can come and take care of those today
[44:35] granted I pray father help me to get out
[44:37] of the way Lord Jesus speak through me
[44:39] words of life I ask in Jesus name and
[44:43] the Saints said amen amen God bless you
[44:46] you may be
[44:54] seated what is it about us
[44:57] human
[44:58] beings that we tend to
[45:01] be lazy sometimes slothful
[45:06] sometimes not Resolute as we should be
[45:10] toward the
[45:11] lord we can be so
[45:15] convinced of things of life things that
[45:19] are around us that really don't amount
[45:21] to a whole lot but yet when it comes to
[45:25] him his word his his
[45:27] work it seems that even those who love
[45:30] him those who are redeemed and filled
[45:34] with his Spirit they still have that
[45:37] element that element is this of course
[45:40] to try to deal
[45:42] with it can make you to where you don't
[45:46] recognize
[45:47] him it's a sad thing when the Sinners do
[45:51] not know who he is when ages and
[45:54] generations have not known him but yet
[45:58] whenever his people don't recognize him
[46:02] when his church does not hearken to his
[46:06] voice now this setting is as we looked
[46:09] at it last Sunday the they have become
[46:12] married now they have joined together he
[46:15] has left the bridal chamber and went out
[46:19] to the invited guest the ceremony would
[46:22] have been about 7 days long the groom is
[46:26] crowned crowned the king of the ceremony
[46:29] and the bride is crowned queen of the
[46:33] ceremony they will be eating drinking
[46:36] rejoicing for seven days but this is the
[46:40] first night so he goes in unto her and
[46:44] he brings out the as the Bible calls it
[46:47] the tokens of her
[46:48] virginity and he tells his friends to
[46:51] Rejoice because here is the proof that
[46:54] she was a virgin she was true true she
[46:57] was pure she was undefiled he's not
[47:00] really gone that long just a short time
[47:04] but she already goes to bed she's tired
[47:07] the festivities of the day she's worn
[47:10] out she's under anticipation of being
[47:12] joined to him now that's happened and
[47:15] he's become a little bit common to her
[47:18] already now remember who this is this is
[47:21] in the anot type at Solomon and the
[47:24] shulamite the shulamite was a girl that
[47:27] lived in a hidden reclusive part of the
[47:30] kingdom of Judea and Solomon happened to
[47:33] be through there one day and he sees
[47:36] this beautiful young
[47:38] woman she has no royal blood in her she
[47:42] is not a person of great reputation her
[47:45] family no doubt very small not
[47:48] recognized in the tribes of Israel but
[47:51] yet Solomon's heart is taken with her
[47:55] remember this man could could have any
[47:57] woman he wanted as long as she wasn't
[47:59] married to be a wife his consorts would
[48:02] have been queens and
[48:04] princesses he was a man of renown the
[48:06] greatest King on the earth at this time
[48:08] so he could have had basically any woman
[48:12] beautiful Rich wealthy didn't matter no
[48:15] limitations to him but he fell in love
[48:19] with a popper fell in love with a girl
[48:22] that would have had so little to offer
[48:25] him looks like she should have been so
[48:29] honored that he did but yet again
[48:33] there's something about us human beings
[48:35] that Grace bewilders us Grace overcomes
[48:39] us sometimes and Grace can be so
[48:43] Bountiful and yet as rich and wonderful
[48:45] as it is it can still become so
[48:50] commonplace it's around us every day of
[48:52] our life Every Breath You Take every
[48:54] moment that you live is the mercy of
[48:57] God and in spite of all that
[48:59] graciousness that he gives to us it can
[49:02] still become so common and we can become
[49:05] so spiritually lazy to we that God in
[49:10] his word isn't really the preeminent
[49:13] part of our life as humans there's
[49:15] something about us being of the world
[49:18] that we came out of it leaves that taint
[49:22] upon us and our
[49:24] Humanity that we tend to fall in love
[49:27] with dead
[49:31] things our cars our homes our jobs our
[49:37] clothes our Hobbies our
[49:41] pastimes and yet none of those things
[49:43] and many others that I can mention live
[49:48] breathe you can love your car you can
[49:51] make an idol out of your car you can
[49:53] polish it and rub it and oh my you can
[49:56] just spend so much time on it and it
[49:59] will never have one finger to ever reach
[50:04] back and touch
[50:07] you your home as beautiful as it is as
[50:10] nice and comfortable all the things that
[50:13] we love and we possess yet none of them
[50:17] have any arms that they can ever reach
[50:20] and pull you in and embrace you your job
[50:26] no matter what we think of think about
[50:28] all the things that we love and think
[50:31] about how many of them are
[50:34] dead they have no life they have no
[50:37] ability to love us back so you look at
[50:40] your car and you
[50:42] smile do your car ever smile
[50:46] back what about your
[50:48] home what about your
[50:51] clothes your sisters what about your
[50:53] possessions your rings your purses your
[50:56] dresses your
[50:57] shoes your brothers your whatever it is
[51:00] your toys are do any of them ever reach
[51:04] back and just say I love you so
[51:10] much and yet we F our lives with dead
[51:16] things dead
[51:18] things dead things that cannot speak
[51:21] cannot express emotion cannot express
[51:24] pain sorrow compassion passion
[51:27] understanding totally completely dead
[51:32] things and look at this Bride As she
[51:35] responds to to him I I I've washed my
[51:38] feet I've changed my clothes and she
[51:41] took off her day clothes and put on her
[51:42] nightclothes and she had a pan beside
[51:44] the bed unlike us didn't have carpets
[51:47] and things like that so the floors would
[51:49] have been Dusty and they would wash
[51:51] their feet one of the last things they
[51:52] would do before they get in the bed they
[51:54] would wash their feet and get in the bed
[51:56] and she I'm already in bed I can't
[51:58] believe that you would ask me to get up
[52:02] I I just cannot believe that you would
[52:04] want me to get out of the bed and take
[52:07] my night clothes off and put my day
[52:09] clothes on and you're right there at the
[52:11] door why why would you do this why why
[52:13] would you inconvenience me this
[52:18] way so he who could knock down the
[52:25] door knocked on on the
[52:28] door he who could have
[52:31] demanded she get
[52:34] up ask that she get
[52:37] up he who could have demanded that she
[52:40] loved him I command you to love me but
[52:46] he didn't he asked her
[52:50] to so he puts his hand by the hole of
[52:54] the door as I mentioned last Sunday this
[52:56] is very unfamiliar to us of course the
[52:58] way that our doors and locks are made
[53:00] but it shows us that her heart was not
[53:04] totally closed off from him so there
[53:08] would have been a latch and there would
[53:10] have been a latch on the inside a little
[53:12] door and a door if you will and she
[53:15] could have latched that part to keep him
[53:19] from admittance but she didn't she
[53:21] leaves that to where it's open and she
[53:23] says in verse four my beloved put his
[53:25] hand by the hole of the door and my bows
[53:29] which seems odd to us but with the
[53:32] Hebrews it's the way that they looked at
[53:34] the seat of their passion the seat of
[53:37] where they felt their emotions and
[53:39] things come from and she said my bowels
[53:42] were moved for him so there's something
[53:46] about the Slumber that she's
[53:48] experiencing at least it's not all the
[53:51] way through to her soul unlike the leans
[53:56] that she she's around you understand
[53:57] what I'm saying that that they are
[54:00] through and through Soul spirit and body
[54:03] but hers was more the body but it had so
[54:06] affected her it had led her to this spot
[54:09] of sleep in this leosan age and we know
[54:13] that sleepiness is all around us
[54:16] everywhere and Matthew chapter 25 the G
[54:19] Jesus tells us the Kingdom of Heaven
[54:21] shall be likened unto 10 virgins five
[54:24] were wise and five were foolish while
[54:26] the bridegroom teared they all slumbered
[54:28] and slept and about midnight they went
[54:30] forth to cry go you out to meet the
[54:34] bridegroom then the foolish said unto
[54:36] the wise give us of your oil for our
[54:39] lamps have gone out then the wise said
[54:42] unto the foolish not so lest we not have
[54:45] enough for ourselves and for you also
[54:48] but go to them that sell and buy for
[54:52] yourselves and while they were gone to
[54:55] buy oil the bridegroom came and the door
[54:58] was shut and they were left on the
[55:01] outside so we can see that there is this
[55:05] Spirit of Slumber that affected both
[55:08] wise and foolish virgin and you're she
[55:12] is she's actually already bride entered
[55:15] into this Union with him but yet this
[55:19] this Slumber has come over her and she's
[55:23] trying to shake it she doesn't want it
[55:26] to be that way what is the matter with
[55:28] me why am I this way this man shouldn't
[55:33] even have looked at me this man should
[55:35] not even have given me the time of day
[55:38] as we would say and yet he chose me
[55:40] above many rich women he chose me above
[55:44] many women of royalty I have not one
[55:47] drop of royal blood in my vein she could
[55:50] say and yet he chose me above all those
[55:53] women he sent his personal
[55:56] bodyguard 70 well-trained men in his own
[56:02] pacquin a pin was a short type of s
[56:07] about six 6 and 1/2 ft long about 3 feet
[56:11] wide it would have been overlaid with
[56:13] gold silver blue and purple it would
[56:17] have had men on all four corners and it
[56:20] was his own personal ride as we would
[56:23] say it was carried upon the should
[56:26] shoulders of the men he sent that to get
[56:29] her not another person Solomon built
[56:33] this himself not another person
[56:36] according to the scripture or according
[56:37] to history had ever even ridden on this
[56:42] Peloquin but he let her ride on
[56:46] it I remember he did not go to her house
[56:49] it would have broken protocol for him to
[56:52] go to hers but he met her big house and
[56:55] his house
[56:57] it was a few days journey for them to
[56:59] come so he sends these personal
[57:01] bodyguards and every one of them are
[57:04] well-trained men and they knew how to
[57:06] use a
[57:08] sword in their couple of day Journey no
[57:11] doubt she's still getting the final
[57:14] polishing and the honing in tell me
[57:17] about Solomon what kind of man is he
[57:19] what does he like and and and what does
[57:22] he dislike because I I've never got to
[57:24] be around him that much
[57:26] please you are his personal bodyguards
[57:29] tell me what what am I expected to do
[57:32] she did not know anything about Palace
[57:34] etiquette she didn't know how to behave
[57:37] in a palace she's a country girl she
[57:39] didn't know what to do how how your
[57:42] manners are do you pick up a fork with
[57:44] the left hand or the right hand do you
[57:46] curtsy do you bow what do you do she
[57:49] didn't have a
[57:51] clue and yet whenever she comes close a
[57:54] messenger goes before her as they begin
[57:57] to get close to the city and he sends
[57:59] out music and he sends out incense
[58:01] burners and he sends out all the singers
[58:04] and the great celebration starts just as
[58:06] the bride is coming close to the
[58:10] city this hasn't been but about three
[58:14] days prior to
[58:17] this already she
[58:21] forgot
[58:22] already it had become common well
[58:26] well I'm the church I'm the bride H I
[58:30] just I go to church when I want to if I
[58:33] get there I'll sing if I want to if I
[58:35] don't want to Brother Lou ain't going to
[58:37] make me sing glory to God ain't nobody
[58:40] telling me what to do
[58:43] Hallelujah if I don't want to smile I
[58:45] don't want to smile if the preacher says
[58:47] say amen and I don't want to say amen I
[58:49] ain't saying amen I do what I want to
[58:53] do see already Grace is becomes so
[58:56] common to us that somehow we think he
[58:59] owes it to us he owes us
[59:03] nothing he doesn't owe you Grace he
[59:06] doesn't owe me Grace he doesn't owe me
[59:08] mercy come on somebody he doesn't owe
[59:11] you forgiveness he doesn't owe you
[59:13] pardon he does it because of who he is
[59:17] not because he owes us one
[59:20] thing now want you notice as she looks
[59:23] at this she says that her the passions
[59:26] of her soul has now been able to hear
[59:29] and recognize her voice or his voice
[59:32] rather but she recognizes it a little
[59:35] bit too late in verse 5 she said I rose
[59:39] up to open to my beloved and my hands
[59:42] dropped with myrr and my fingers with
[59:45] sweet smelling myrr upon the handles of
[59:49] the lock so she didn't respond to his
[59:52] voice when he knocked but she did
[59:55] respond when she saw his hand come
[59:59] through the opening of the door now
[1:00:00] what's what's how that how that his
[1:00:03] Mercy is extended you know his hands in
[1:00:06] the Old Testament as well as the new
[1:00:08] were signs of his glory so whenever we
[1:00:13] talk about the hand of God doing
[1:00:15] something it is generally a glorious
[1:00:17] manifestation in the realm of the
[1:00:20] supernatural so it was when she saw the
[1:00:23] hand
[1:00:24] move that she recognized she better do
[1:00:28] something about it so instead of hearing
[1:00:31] the voice and the voice captivating her
[1:00:34] heart and her responding to the voice
[1:00:38] she waited till she saw the hand which
[1:00:41] was a move and you see again even he and
[1:00:45] him Merc in his Mercy instead of turning
[1:00:48] and walking away just when the voice
[1:00:50] came first stage he did not do that he
[1:00:53] stood there a little while longer while
[1:00:55] the do is still falling and he's
[1:00:58] standing there the drips coming down on
[1:01:00] his shoulders down into his beard
[1:01:02] getting His Garment now saturated with
[1:01:04] the Dew of the night and his voice
[1:01:07] speaks and speaks and she doesn't move
[1:01:10] and finally he decides he'll have one
[1:01:13] more Outreach of mercy so he reaches his
[1:01:17] hand to the hole in the door and then
[1:01:20] she
[1:01:23] responds his voice was not enough yet it
[1:01:26] was The Voice by which she was married
[1:01:30] it was The Voice by which called her out
[1:01:33] of the darkness that she was
[1:01:35] in but it wasn't the voice that she
[1:01:38] yielded to after she become
[1:01:40] bride but she got so dependent upon the
[1:01:43] hand
[1:01:44] move instead of the voice move you
[1:01:48] following me this morning now sir the
[1:01:51] opening of the door was the latch now
[1:01:54] remember there was a hole there by which
[1:01:56] the person would be able to reach in and
[1:01:58] get the latch but there was a little
[1:02:00] small covering on that which a l a latch
[1:02:03] on the inside and she did not totally
[1:02:06] close that because she expected him to
[1:02:09] come in so her heart was still an
[1:02:12] element of it moved toward him so the
[1:02:14] king did not force his way in he did not
[1:02:18] beat the door down but no doubt he was
[1:02:23] disappointed for every child of God that
[1:02:26] sits here
[1:02:27] today if you are truly a child of
[1:02:31] God you don't actually have to leave
[1:02:33] here today and go out and pull a big
[1:02:35] drunk you don't have to go out and shoot
[1:02:38] up with some type of drugs or narcotics
[1:02:40] or something like that run over somebody
[1:02:43] and kill
[1:02:44] them to feel like your heart is broken
[1:02:47] toward the
[1:02:48] Lord but if you miss him in the least
[1:02:53] way it is such a disappointing
[1:02:56] appointment to a child of God how many
[1:02:58] knows what I'm talking about how many
[1:03:01] has been so
[1:03:03] disappointed at yourself at times with
[1:03:06] the Lord no me too I have to raise both
[1:03:09] of my hands and you see disappointment
[1:03:12] runs both
[1:03:14] ways no doubt he was so
[1:03:20] disappointed but unlike we are whenever
[1:03:23] we do things for people and they break
[1:03:26] our heart or break their promises to us
[1:03:28] and we tend to throw it back up to did
[1:03:31] not I do that this for you and that for
[1:03:33] you and that I can't believe that you do
[1:03:35] that to me I just cannot believe
[1:03:38] it oh but I'm so grateful that he's
[1:03:41] unlike
[1:03:43] me I'm grateful he's not like you
[1:03:47] too so she says I rose up to open to my
[1:03:52] beloved now being willing now after he's
[1:03:56] done turned
[1:03:58] away she realizes that she's mistaken
[1:04:02] and missed his voice so the shulamite
[1:04:06] went to the door and when she did she
[1:04:09] reached forth her hand and she realized
[1:04:14] he was gone now what's she doing she's
[1:04:16] reaching forth her hand from her side of
[1:04:19] the hole the
[1:04:21] opening she's wanting her hand to touch
[1:04:25] his hand the
[1:04:28] supernatural so her Works she's wanting
[1:04:31] to align with his works now listen to me
[1:04:36] I believe in the Supernatural I am a
[1:04:39] walking Miracle every person that's here
[1:04:41] saved today you are one
[1:04:44] too but I do not want to just know him
[1:04:48] when he sticks his hand to the door I
[1:04:52] want to recognize his voice amen amen I
[1:04:56] don't want him to have to open the Red
[1:04:58] Sea every time he wants to speak to my
[1:05:00] heart if I'm fixing to do something
[1:05:03] wrong or fixing to say something wrong I
[1:05:06] believe a child of God can live so close
[1:05:08] to the presence of the Lord that if the
[1:05:11] devil is got a trap laid for us the
[1:05:13] spirit of God can simply speak and we
[1:05:17] will avoid that snare anybody else
[1:05:19] believe the same thing
[1:05:21] today why would he have to open the Red
[1:05:24] Sea why do we always demand such great
[1:05:29] supernatural phenomena for him to be
[1:05:33] able to speak to our hearts why canot we
[1:05:36] have that Harmony between him and us to
[1:05:40] where if we start to do something wrong
[1:05:42] or start to say something wrong or
[1:05:45] anything that would displease him that
[1:05:48] his voice which will be totally unheard
[1:05:51] by the people around you but your
[1:05:54] communication line is so that if you
[1:05:57] were to do something even plan to do it
[1:06:00] he could speak to you and say child
[1:06:03] don't do that
[1:06:06] amen and you just simply
[1:06:08] turn and walk
[1:06:15] away I don't know about you I
[1:06:18] long for a church like
[1:06:22] that instead of a church that has to be
[1:06:25] ripped and beat and thrashed and wore
[1:06:31] out is that what we think Christianity
[1:06:34] is consummating in a church has got to
[1:06:37] be Beat to Death constantly every time
[1:06:39] we come to church we're so stubborn and
[1:06:41] so hardheaded the preacher has to
[1:06:44] constantly rebuke us and constantly God
[1:06:47] has to give us hard Corrections and
[1:06:53] dealings my greatest
[1:06:57] desire is to be a part of a church of
[1:07:02] people who are in such harmony with
[1:07:07] him that every move of their everyday
[1:07:10] life is so synchronized to the will of
[1:07:16] God even his very
[1:07:19] thoughts his
[1:07:22] thoughts is exactly what they wish amen
[1:07:25] yes amen say you're crazy no I'm
[1:07:29] not the Bible says as many as are led by
[1:07:33] the spirit of God are the sons of
[1:07:36] God I believe in forgiveness don't you
[1:07:39] I'm grateful for the blood of Jesus we
[1:07:41] need it all the time but to me the same
[1:07:44] spirit of God that can come and forgive
[1:07:46] me when I mess up cannot that spirit of
[1:07:49] God stop me from messing up in the first
[1:07:51] place if I live in harmony with him is
[1:07:54] that where we want to live live that we
[1:07:56] constantly want to live under confession
[1:08:00] and repentance all the time you mean
[1:08:02] that's all that's all Calvary
[1:08:06] done that's all that Calvary done you
[1:08:09] mean Calvary has no more power than that
[1:08:13] that's all the power you understand
[1:08:15] that's the epitome of the majority of
[1:08:17] Christians in the day that we live in
[1:08:19] that they do not live above sin it's
[1:08:22] constantly falling and repenting falling
[1:08:25] repenting falling and repenting you mean
[1:08:28] that's all Calvary
[1:08:30] done that's it that that that's the
[1:08:33] success of Calvary in other words we're
[1:08:37] still struggling
[1:08:39] Sinners we don't live a life of Victory
[1:08:43] we can't even have one day that we're
[1:08:45] above sin and we're above the things of
[1:08:47] the world and and that's all that
[1:08:49] Calvary
[1:08:50] did well I don't mind telling you I'm
[1:08:52] very
[1:08:53] disappointed I saw the Bible tells me
[1:08:57] that greater is he that is in you than
[1:09:01] he that is in the world now do we
[1:09:03] believe that today so cannot he that
[1:09:07] lives in me also give me instruction and
[1:09:11] wisdom and victory inside of my life not
[1:09:15] just on Sunday morning I want just as
[1:09:18] much Victory tomorrow as I've got right
[1:09:20] here today I want just as much on
[1:09:23] Tuesday and Thursday and Friday and off
[1:09:27] service days I want just as much Victory
[1:09:30] then as I've got right here this morning
[1:09:32] if not than all Calvary really has done
[1:09:35] has provided me two days Wednesday and
[1:09:39] Saturday by which I can have Victory or
[1:09:42] Wednesday and Sunday whenever it is you
[1:09:43] have your church I don't believe that I
[1:09:46] believe the power of Calvary can be able
[1:09:49] to produce the life of Jesus Christ in
[1:09:53] the heart of a child of God to whether
[1:09:56] they're in church whether it's the
[1:09:58] middle of the week if it's on Monday if
[1:10:01] it's on Saturday they can live a holy
[1:10:04] life they can overcome sin Satan
[1:10:07] Darkness Leia everything that Satan has
[1:10:10] to offer in the age we're living
[1:10:15] in because the Bible goes on to tell us
[1:10:18] this is a victory that overcometh the
[1:10:20] world even our
[1:10:23] faith so what is good about this
[1:10:26] relationship that this woman has and
[1:10:28] it's just young now you imagine some of
[1:10:30] us have been serving the lord for
[1:10:33] decades decades upon decades and yet
[1:10:35] there's something about Christians that
[1:10:38] from time to time we need a renewal a
[1:10:42] refreshing how many understands want I'm
[1:10:43] to say it a renewal a refreshing it's
[1:10:46] just like a man and wife that love one
[1:10:48] another and yet Lord willing if if the
[1:10:50] Lord lets Carol and I live to July we
[1:10:53] will be married 51 years 51 years oh how
[1:10:56] I'm grateful for how I appreciate God
[1:10:58] for giving her to me and yet there's
[1:11:01] times that Carol and I will need just to
[1:11:03] be able to get away for a day day or so
[1:11:06] I actually never get away really because
[1:11:09] as long as I take my cell phone with me
[1:11:11] it's a prison you know what I'm saying
[1:11:13] so from people around the world if I
[1:11:15] just had this church here to take care
[1:11:17] of that's a burden within itself I have
[1:11:19] people all over the world that I have to
[1:11:21] try to help and take care of so I never
[1:11:23] actually get to a place oh brother
[1:11:25] Donnie go without your cell phone what I
[1:11:28] wouldn't even enjoy it if I did I
[1:11:30] wouldn't enjoy it if I would cuz I'd be
[1:11:31] worryed about you that some of you might
[1:11:33] need me for this or that or the other
[1:11:36] but we need a Time on the occasion where
[1:11:38] we can just try to relax a little bit
[1:11:40] and get away for a refreshing where we
[1:11:43] can just spend time together I believe
[1:11:45] our relationship with the Lord Jesus is
[1:11:48] exactly the same way you ever get to
[1:11:51] that spot to where you just feel like
[1:11:53] you need a renewing with him now you
[1:11:55] know it's not him it's not on his part
[1:11:58] no fault of course on him that he's been
[1:12:00] really busy you know working on your
[1:12:02] city and and working on your new mansion
[1:12:05] and all that sort of thing and he hasn't
[1:12:07] had time to talk to you he hasn't had
[1:12:09] time to spend with you it's never him
[1:12:11] it's always me it's always you anybody
[1:12:13] say Amen to that but yet there's times
[1:12:16] that we need that renewing and that
[1:12:19] refreshing now I want you to notice that
[1:12:22] there's even in the end time to where
[1:12:25] there's so much things around us and
[1:12:27] many of you maybe remember the sermon
[1:12:29] that I preached here years and years ago
[1:12:31] called The Bondage of time and it was
[1:12:34] going down through even at that time we
[1:12:36] thought was was in bondage then it
[1:12:38] wasn't near as much bondage as it is
[1:12:40] today and it seemed like there's so much
[1:12:43] demand for the time that we have and we
[1:12:46] have no more time than what Adam had
[1:12:49] when he stepped out of the Garden of
[1:12:50] Eden 24 hours in the day s days a week
[1:12:53] and here we are we've got more demands
[1:12:55] for our time and some of you thought
[1:12:57] when you got older you would slow down
[1:13:00] you still looking for that person that
[1:13:01] lied to you I am I'm looking for the one
[1:13:04] that told me that cuz it sure ain't
[1:13:05] happened yet and yet we realize as we go
[1:13:09] on in time it will be that way there'll
[1:13:11] be more things that'll one our time and
[1:13:14] we would sit down and figure it out and
[1:13:17] allocate how much time that we give to
[1:13:19] God how much time we give to school how
[1:13:21] much time we give to soccer how much
[1:13:23] time we give to football practice
[1:13:25] baseball practice basketball practice
[1:13:28] you know all kinds of other practice
[1:13:30] this that the other all the things in
[1:13:32] our life and we would really figure how
[1:13:35] much time we get to God would' probably
[1:13:37] be ashamed of
[1:13:39] ourselves and yet he himself will take
[1:13:43] it if that's all that we will give him
[1:13:45] if we will give him 10 minutes of
[1:13:48] personal time now by that I don't mean
[1:13:50] you and WhatsApp you and YouTube you and
[1:13:53] Tik Tok you and Instagram
[1:13:55] you and Tick Tock and Jesus Jesus don't
[1:13:58] want you in Tik Tock he wants you
[1:14:00] without Tick Tock Jesus don't want you
[1:14:02] in Instagram he wants you and him
[1:14:05] together praise the Lord and yet look
[1:14:08] we've got more things than ever in our
[1:14:11] entire lives to pull on us and it's
[1:14:14] amazing though because in that thing
[1:14:16] when people are thinking about that and
[1:14:19] many of them are
[1:14:21] convinced that they don't even need to
[1:14:23] go to church anymore
[1:14:27] because I can be just as good a
[1:14:31] Christian staying at
[1:14:34] home and we have a move in our ranks
[1:14:37] that is promoting and
[1:14:40] believing that all you need to do is
[1:14:43] stay home and play a
[1:14:46] tape I really don't care if you get
[1:14:48] quiet on me I'm going to preach it with
[1:14:50] you or without you just up to
[1:14:54] you remember the angels are take Taking
[1:14:57] note
[1:14:58] today so if they know you didn't say
[1:15:00] Amen that kind of goes against
[1:15:03] you I find it amazing especially since
[1:15:06] the Bible says that forsake not the
[1:15:08] siming of yourselves together and that
[1:15:11] much more as you see the day approaching
[1:15:14] and somebody said so whenever we need
[1:15:18] really more time together to be in the
[1:15:20] presence of God people are somehow
[1:15:23] convinced that church really isn't that
[1:15:25] important that vacations are more
[1:15:27] important and some people have so many
[1:15:29] vacations honestly don't know how it's
[1:15:31] even a vacation no more because I have
[1:15:33] so many of them how could it even be you
[1:15:35] know kind of special anyway I'm still
[1:15:37] trying to figure that out let me know if
[1:15:39] you know the answer to that but I want
[1:15:41] you to I want to want to show you
[1:15:43] something here that whenever brother
[1:15:44] random was here he had moved to Tucson
[1:15:47] and many of the people from
[1:15:49] Jeffersonville Georgia different places
[1:15:51] some of them uh they took up their homes
[1:15:54] and their families and so on and they
[1:15:55] moved out there and whenever they got
[1:15:58] there there was no church for them to go
[1:16:01] to that was preaching what he believed
[1:16:04] now there was brother Brock brother
[1:16:05] Gilmore Assembly of God Church of God
[1:16:08] there was Apostolic different ones like
[1:16:10] that but there was no church because he
[1:16:12] himself did not go there to start a
[1:16:14] church so they would go from one Church
[1:16:16] to another and I know from talking to
[1:16:19] family members that brother Randon would
[1:16:20] go and visit those churches and many of
[1:16:23] them would whenever he would go they
[1:16:25] wouldn't even acknowledge he was in the
[1:16:27] building that morning so they wouldn't
[1:16:29] even say we're glad to have brother
[1:16:30] brandham here today they wouldn't even
[1:16:33] acknowledge he was there and yet I know
[1:16:35] of one at least one instance to where
[1:16:38] that he went to one place that didn't
[1:16:39] acknowledge him and he went back and he
[1:16:42] told his family they were're going to go
[1:16:43] at least to go visit and one of his
[1:16:45] family members said Daddy you know that
[1:16:47] they didn't even acknowledge that that
[1:16:48] you were there how how can you turn and
[1:16:51] go back he said they didn't Jesus either
[1:16:54] but he went back anyway amen so you know
[1:16:57] it had come to the spot now to where
[1:17:00] that the people following this message
[1:17:04] were there in this vicinity and they
[1:17:07] were not attending
[1:17:10] church and perig green brother perig
[1:17:12] green goes to on Stone Avenue there I
[1:17:16] think was the address where it was and
[1:17:18] there was where two churches and merged
[1:17:21] together Assembly of God and he feels in
[1:17:24] his heart to start a church so brother
[1:17:27] Brandon is here and this is what house
[1:17:30] will you build me this is 11:21 65 I
[1:17:33] want you to notice this day I know that
[1:17:35] each one of you if you feel like I do
[1:17:37] I'm so hungry to see the spirit of God
[1:17:40] moving I just can't hardly stand it I
[1:17:43] want you to listen to this request now
[1:17:45] and desire on his heart this is a little
[1:17:49] bit over a month before he's going to be
[1:17:52] taken from the Earth
[1:17:56] a month out from
[1:17:58] eternity and listen how he's
[1:18:01] feeling I'm so hungry to see the spirit
[1:18:04] of God moving I just can't hardly stand
[1:18:08] it some
[1:18:11] experiences I just had up in the
[1:18:13] mountain just to feel that once
[1:18:17] again that something that when I was
[1:18:21] first
[1:18:23] saved So Glorious to my heart now
[1:18:29] remember he's had all these great things
[1:18:31] to happen to him and he's within a
[1:18:34] month of Crossing into
[1:18:38] eternity but he's longing brother skip
[1:18:41] he's
[1:18:42] hungering to feel like he did when he
[1:18:44] first got
[1:18:47] saved you see there's something about
[1:18:50] Ministry that
[1:18:51] takes a great toll on you
[1:18:55] amen you deal with
[1:18:58] people and they will use
[1:19:01] you they will lie on
[1:19:06] you oh you're the greatest man that ever
[1:19:09] was until they find somebody they like
[1:19:10] better then they won't even have enough
[1:19:12] respective and come and talk to you
[1:19:14] before they leave they'll just walk
[1:19:19] away and yet the gifts and the
[1:19:23] Supernatural is wonderful
[1:19:26] but there's something that it pulled and
[1:19:28] pulled and he had so many scars on his
[1:19:33] heart and it does something to
[1:19:37] you and if we're not careful we become
[1:19:40] disappointed with people that's around
[1:19:42] us and people that we go to church with
[1:19:46] and Christians you think if anybody's
[1:19:48] going to be honest and people of
[1:19:50] integrity and character should be
[1:19:53] Christians am yes sir but I've got to be
[1:19:57] honest with you I've been treated worse
[1:19:58] by
[1:19:59] Christians than I ever was by
[1:20:02] Sinners my greatest wounds today me
[1:20:06] personally are from Christians probably
[1:20:09] some of yours are the same way are they
[1:20:11] not so it can take something out of you
[1:20:16] and if we're not careful little by
[1:20:18] little we go to losing something about
[1:20:21] that initial love that first love as the
[1:20:24] Bible calls
[1:20:25] and we become accustomed to the more
[1:20:28] hard
[1:20:29] calloused disassociated part of our
[1:20:33] lives and it becomes normal and we
[1:20:37] accept it to feel this way so we go to
[1:20:39] church we don't feel God we pray we
[1:20:42] don't feel God we read our Bibles we
[1:20:44] don't feel God we go through the
[1:20:47] religious ritual and we don't feel God
[1:20:50] and before long that becomes the new
[1:20:52] Norm oh my
[1:20:56] don't raise your hand but I wonder for
[1:20:57] some of you is that your new
[1:21:05] Norm Lord Jesus speak to us
[1:21:09] father that's something that when I was
[1:21:11] first Saved was So Glorious in my heart
[1:21:14] and we can come into a place that we can
[1:21:16] sit and we can see it among
[1:21:20] us that we are
[1:21:23] dry and we set here in the desert and I
[1:21:25] get among my brethren they talk with me
[1:21:28] and I talk with them always a little way
[1:21:30] of watching and feeling out there with
[1:21:32] the spirit as it was to see the
[1:21:35] condition of that Brethren I want you to
[1:21:36] think now they not only have the
[1:21:39] recorded
[1:21:41] sermons they have the prophet of God
[1:21:46] himself right there with them and among
[1:21:51] them and they are drying
[1:21:55] they're becoming
[1:21:58] indifferent
[1:22:00] am praise the
[1:22:03] Lord I begin to feel us
[1:22:08] all
[1:22:12] reclining getting away from the
[1:22:17] spirit now notice no doubt they were
[1:22:20] still playing taste now remember this
[1:22:22] date November 6th
[1:22:26] so by then they had
[1:22:29] hundreds over a thousand tapes recorded
[1:22:33] sermons and they had the prophet in
[1:22:37] flesh so the recorded sermons was not
[1:22:41] keeping them from
[1:22:42] drying amen the prophet in flesh was not
[1:22:46] keeping them from
[1:22:51] dry you know what they were missing
[1:22:54] going to
[1:22:59] church and not only going to church but
[1:23:02] getting in once they get
[1:23:05] there now if that did not keep these
[1:23:10] people in that
[1:23:12] date what makes people think it will
[1:23:15] keep them now here that's right how do
[1:23:18] people are convinced in their mind they
[1:23:21] don't need to go to church they don't
[1:23:23] need to worship God they don't I don't
[1:23:25] need nobody you are so
[1:23:31] wrong now watch it's happening right
[1:23:34] among them and the prophet thank God he
[1:23:36] was bold enough to be able to admit
[1:23:39] it notice what he says I begin to feel
[1:23:43] us all you what's amazing about this
[1:23:46] he's not standing there just poting y
[1:23:48] y'all need to do this and you need to do
[1:23:50] that and you need to do something else
[1:23:52] he actually puts himself
[1:23:55] in the same
[1:23:57] category I want you to notice the word
[1:23:59] that he uses the
[1:24:01] pronoun he said I begin to feel us all
[1:24:07] reclining getting away from the spirit
[1:24:10] it's become too natural a thing to us we
[1:24:14] must
[1:24:15] Worship in the spirit where the spirit
[1:24:20] of God now listen to the
[1:24:22] message not only our message should be
[1:24:25] the flame of the
[1:24:27] hour it should be the flame in our
[1:24:32] hearts wow not only the flame of the
[1:24:36] hour but the flame in our heart see it
[1:24:40] it's got to be in our hearts or we can't
[1:24:42] rightly present it to the people the
[1:24:46] spirit has to pack the message
[1:24:51] itself thank you Lord so our knowledge
[1:24:54] and our our ability to memorize quotes
[1:24:56] or scriptures or Greek terms and Aramaic
[1:25:00] words and Hebrew words and so on and so
[1:25:03] on without the spirit of God helping us
[1:25:06] we will never be able to pack the word
[1:25:09] of God
[1:25:13] Amen now he he's gathered here with some
[1:25:17] people and he's admonishing them and
[1:25:19] telling them they're going to need
[1:25:20] Sunday school teachers and officers in
[1:25:23] the church and this this is what he's
[1:25:24] telling them jump down and go with me to
[1:25:26] paragraph 33 he said keep the message
[1:25:30] honorable and live the right kind of
[1:25:37] life don't let no
[1:25:42] smut come upon

[1:25:49] late in the hour let's live it
[1:25:53] clean my life your life all our lives
[1:26:00] need to be picked
[1:26:05] up before
[1:26:09] God and the church said
[1:26:14] amen I want you to notice some of the
[1:26:16] things that was bothered him our young
[1:26:19] people just ride around from place to
[1:26:22] place from sh show to
[1:26:25] show drifting further and further
[1:26:30] away from
[1:26:34] God message
[1:26:38] youth message
[1:26:41] kids riding around from show to show why
[1:26:46] no
[1:26:48] church on so I ran into one of these
[1:26:51] women one day on the street and said did
[1:26:53] you go to church yesterday she said I'm
[1:26:56] not no
[1:26:59] legalist I wash my clothes he said you
[1:27:01] done wrong you should have been the
[1:27:02] church
[1:27:04] somewhere I find it amazing that the
[1:27:07] people who believe this trash cuz that's
[1:27:10] what it is you'll never hear them quote
[1:27:13] this quote I just quoted to you you know
[1:27:15] why I'm going to tell you why they don't
[1:27:17] believe it
[1:27:19] amen I don't care what their last name
[1:27:21] is first name middle name they don't
[1:27:24] believe what he
[1:27:26] said now this is a true prophet of
[1:27:34] God now watch Bring it on down to us
[1:27:38] that's the truth I see it in my
[1:27:45] children I see myself getting to a place
[1:27:48] now here's the
[1:27:50] answer you've got to assemble yourself
[1:27:54] El
[1:28:01] together Lord now do you understand
[1:28:04] there will be many message people
[1:28:07] so-called that will absolutely go
[1:28:10] straight to the tribulation period they
[1:28:12] will be playing tapes the day after the
[1:28:15] Rapture and when they stand before God
[1:28:18] these things I've read to you today will
[1:28:20] stand there and be a voice against
[1:28:23] them why because they don't believe what
[1:28:26] they say they
[1:28:28] believe well come on
[1:28:35] somebody I don't care how they try to
[1:28:38] reason it how they try to explain it
[1:28:40] away you see here's a man that is
[1:28:43] experiencing it
[1:28:45] himself so he's experiencing what it is
[1:28:50] to be around the message in and around
[1:28:52] the
[1:28:53] message
[1:28:54] and believe it or not there was actually
[1:28:56] some Sundays that they played tapes in
[1:28:59] their own
[1:29:02] home the brandham
[1:29:06] family and
[1:29:09] yet they're still
[1:29:12] drying and their children are getting

[1:33:10] rocks cuz you dig around in his word and
[1:33:14] you dig out Treasures for us as the
[1:33:16] people of God I said well I guess that's
[1:33:19] that's
[1:33:22] true
[1:33:29] you think that pleases
[1:33:31] him when I tell him I don't want to be a
[1:33:35] preacher why' you ever call
[1:33:37] me I don't like traveling I don't like

[1:33:52] I going to stay here with you
[1:33:55] I mean if I've got to preach anyway I
[1:33:56] might as well say with you all
[1:34:00] right you said get pleases
[1:34:02] him you think it pleases him when he has
[1:34:05] to beg you to read your
[1:34:08] Bible or
[1:34:10] pray or if the song leader has to give
[1:34:12] up come on let's everybody now let's
[1:34:14] Worship the Lord let's raise our hands
[1:34:16] and we go up like this and back
[1:34:18] down this just close our eyes and
[1:34:20] worship him we do it for a few seconds
[1:34:22] and work
[1:34:26] out and you
[1:34:28] see God isn't just asking us to do this
[1:34:31] for
[1:34:33] himself but he also knows there's a
[1:34:36] great benefit for you and I when we
[1:34:41] worship notice the way that the prophet
[1:34:43] says this whenever he talks us about
[1:34:44] going to church now it's not just going
[1:34:45] to church and taking up a spot in a Pew
[1:34:48] or in a seat but it's actually pulling
[1:34:50] us into the spirit of God because does
[1:34:54] something to us when we get in his
[1:35:00] presence so whenever I go over to the
[1:35:03] stoneyard on the Bristol Highway right
[1:35:06] up from
[1:35:07] Grand and I know that guy in there
[1:35:09] pretty good because I've been there a
[1:35:11] lot so I don't even stop at the office
[1:35:13] no more I just wave as I'm going
[1:35:15] by and I go out there through his rocks
[1:35:19] and I just pick up rocks and I just look
[1:35:22] at them some you say I knew that man was
[1:35:25] out of his mind now I know for sure he
[1:35:28] is I do I just think what them colors
[1:35:31] come from and I found all kinds of
[1:35:34] little animals and I think little guy
[1:35:37] how old are you how old are you how long
[1:35:40] have you been there embedded in
[1:35:47] that and what if I would have been an
[1:35:52] archaeologist
[1:35:54] how many people that are saved
[1:35:56] today under this part that I don't want
[1:35:59] to
[1:36:00] do and their name will be identified
[1:36:03] with me for
[1:36:05] eternity how many people sitting in this
[1:36:08] place today were sealed by the Holy
[1:36:11] Ghost to the day of your
[1:36:13] Redemption because of a part of my life
[1:36:16] that God gave me but I wish you hadn't
[1:36:19] gave it to
[1:36:22] me what makes me that way what makes you
[1:36:27] that
[1:36:31] way that's
[1:36:36] right this is our greatest
[1:36:41] enemy how many can acknowledge we need
[1:36:46] help brother Paul we need
[1:36:52] help
[1:36:55] I Rose to open up to my beloved and my
[1:36:58] hands dropped with
[1:37:00] myrr and my fingers with sweet smelling
[1:37:03] myrr upon the
[1:37:05] handles of the
[1:37:07] lock I'll open to my beloved but my
[1:37:10] beloved had withdrawn himself and was
[1:37:15] gone what he desired was his bride to
[1:37:18] come at the
[1:37:20] beckoning of his
[1:37:22] voice so he just
[1:37:24] speaks
[1:37:27] co
[1:37:33] co that's coded Dove
[1:37:36] talk for open the door
[1:37:41] sweetheart open the
[1:37:44] door I've just presented your tokens of
[1:37:47] virginity before the
[1:37:49] judges you are declared innocent
[1:37:54] oh my am it's not that he's come to
[1:37:58] punish
[1:37:59] her he's come to tell her the news he's
[1:38:02] just presented the tokens of her
[1:38:04] virginity before the Eternal
[1:38:09] himself she is
[1:38:12] accepted
[1:38:16] Hallelujah but she's
[1:38:22] asleep so now now she goes to the door
[1:38:25] and she puts her hand through the hole
[1:38:28] of the door and when she does she gets
[1:38:30] that
[1:38:36] M the aromatics of sandalwood and myrr
[1:38:42] that special ointment that the high
[1:38:45] priest alone could
[1:38:49] wear he wanted to be embraced by her but
[1:38:54] instead he turns and walks away in The
[1:38:56] Damp of the
[1:38:59] night open to my beloved but my beloved
[1:39:02] had withdrawn himself and was
[1:39:04] gone my soul failed when he
[1:39:08] spake I sought
[1:39:10] him but I could not find
[1:39:13] him I called him but he gave me no
[1:39:22] answer dear Jes
[1:39:26] Jesus so now it's hitting
[1:39:30] her I've slideing my
[1:39:33] husband I've offended
[1:39:37] him I've grieved him
[1:39:40] away remember Paul says in Ephesians
[1:39:42] 4:30 grieve not the holy spirit of God
[1:39:45] whereby you're sealed to the day of your
[1:39:46] Redemption that's speaking to those of
[1:39:48] you that have the Holy
[1:39:50] Ghost things that you could do or say
[1:39:53] that would grieve him and he just kind
[1:39:55] of pulls his
[1:39:57] presence away from
[1:39:59] him how many's ever been there besides
[1:40:04] me and it makes you feel so
[1:40:11] awful I sought
[1:40:14] him but I could not find him now that
[1:40:18] she is
[1:40:20] stirring he withdraws himself I called
[1:40:23] him
[1:40:24] but he gave me no
[1:40:27] answer in job 30:20 he said I cry unto
[1:40:31] thee and thou Dost not hear me I stand
[1:40:34] up and thou regardest me not verse 29
[1:40:38] when he giveth quietness who can then
[1:40:40] make trouble and when he hideth his face
[1:40:43] who then can Behold Him whether it be
[1:40:46] done against a nation or against a man
[1:40:49] only Lamentations 3:44 thou Hast covered
[1:40:53] thyself with a cloud that our
[1:40:57] prayer should not pass
[1:41:00] through Matthew
[1:41:03] 15:22 Behold a woman of Canaan came out
[1:41:05] of the same coast and Cried unto him
[1:41:07] saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son
[1:41:10] of David my daughter is grievously vexed
[1:41:12] with the devil but he answered her not a
[1:41:19] word you see weak face need needs
[1:41:23] immediate
[1:41:25] response and
[1:41:27] comfort but strong faith is
[1:41:32] Tried by
[1:41:36] delay strong faith is
[1:41:39] Tried by
[1:41:42] DeLay So maybe some of you today are
[1:41:44] questioning why God would take a certain
[1:41:47] person from the earth and well why would
[1:41:49] God take that person and not take that
[1:41:51] one well first of all he makes no
[1:41:56] mistakes but a lot of times the reason
[1:41:58] he takes hist because they're ready and
[1:42:00] the work is done they can't take that
[1:42:02] one because they ain't ready and the
[1:42:03] work ain't
[1:42:05] done God can delay a real son and
[1:42:09] daughter of God for months on
[1:42:12] end they cry they beg they
[1:42:18] agonize and he remains
[1:42:21] totally silent
[1:42:25] amen because he can trust
[1:42:28] them and other people who do not live
[1:42:31] half the life they live they pray seems
[1:42:34] like instantly they get an answer that's
[1:42:37] not a sign of great faith
[1:42:39] always many times it's a sign of weak
[1:42:43] face cuz they're mashed potato people
[1:42:47] they're microwave people they have to
[1:42:49] have it right now brother amen I hope
[1:42:53] pray to God I'm not a mashed potato
[1:42:55] Christian I hope and pray to God that
[1:42:57] you're not a microwave child of God that
[1:43:01] God can delay brother John and God can
[1:43:04] put off the answer and God can say to
[1:43:07] the devil about John
[1:43:10] horac have you considered my servant not
[1:43:14] job but
[1:43:16] John he loves me he trusts
[1:43:20] me I have intentionally delayed
[1:43:24] answers and he still keeps on praying
[1:43:27] still keeps on
[1:43:29] worshiping he believes in
[1:43:34] me he answered or not a word and his
[1:43:37] disciples came to bes him saying send
[1:43:39] her away for she CRI after us and he
[1:43:42] answered and said I am not sent but into
[1:43:45] the lost sheep of the House of Israel
[1:43:47] boy if you have said that to us this
[1:43:48] morning there wouldn't be 12 people left
[1:43:50] in Word of Life Church with it we'd get
[1:43:52] up
[1:43:53] why I cannot believe he would well he
[1:43:56] said he would even sent for me can you
[1:43:59] believe that my goodness I never seen
[1:44:01] such an arrogant man in my
[1:44:04] life but this was her
[1:44:07] response then came
[1:44:10] she and worshiped
[1:44:16] him she had such faith that Jesus
[1:44:22] himself
[1:44:23] could not run her
[1:44:35] off that's the kind of Christians I want
[1:44:38] to
[1:44:39] produce in this
[1:44:43] church let me close the kind of
[1:44:48] Christians that when you go to the Lord
[1:44:51] Jesus and the Lord Jesus says get out
[1:44:53] out of my face get away from me leave me
[1:44:57] alone you're boring me you're agitating
[1:45:00] me I don't have time for you that you
[1:45:03] stand right there and look at him and
[1:45:05] say I am on your
[1:45:08] hands my blood pressure needs to be
[1:45:11] healed and you're a blood pressure
[1:45:14] healer my hair's been falling out since
[1:45:17] Co you're a hair
[1:45:19] healer my liver ain't working right my
[1:45:22] kid ain't working right my children
[1:45:24] ain't working right my husband ain't
[1:45:27] working right you're a husband saver
[1:45:30] you're a wife saver I am on your hands
[1:45:33] Lord Jesus and Jesus look you right in
[1:45:36] the face and say did not I tell you
[1:45:39] leave me alone and you say I ain't doing
[1:45:47] it but you see many Christians in this
[1:45:50] day we live their walk is so flimsy so
[1:45:53] puny a preacher runs them off somebody
[1:45:57] in the church don't shake their I ain't
[1:45:59] going back no
[1:46:00] more but a real believer not only
[1:46:03] withstands the
[1:46:05] devil but they're like Jacob if they
[1:46:08] have to they'll grab the angel of God
[1:46:10] put it in a headlock and say I ain't
[1:46:12] letting you
[1:46:14] go come on
[1:46:16] somebody is that the way you believe
[1:46:21] God
[1:46:29] notice Jesus response again then came
[1:46:31] she and worshiped him saying Lord help
[1:46:33] me but he answered and said it is not me
[1:46:36] to take the children's
[1:46:38] bread and to cast it to
[1:46:44] dogs woman hear me well you ain't
[1:46:48] nothing but a
[1:46:51] dog
[1:46:54] she said
[1:46:56] amen praise the Lord glory to
[1:47:00] God and she said truth
[1:47:04] Lord oh
[1:47:07] Hallelujah yet the
[1:47:11] dogs I find this amazing in the Greek
[1:47:13] language because there's two different
[1:47:15] words used for
[1:47:18] dogs Jesus said it's not me for me to
[1:47:21] cast the children children's bread to
[1:47:23] dogs Jesus used the Greek word for big
[1:47:27] dogs but she used the word for little
[1:47:32] dogs so Jesus said it ain't me for me to
[1:47:35] give the the children's bread to you
[1:47:37] you're a big dog she said no I'm even
[1:47:40] little than
[1:47:42] that I'm a little
[1:47:47] dog praise
[1:47:49] God and Jesus answered
[1:47:54] and said unto
[1:47:56] her oh
[1:47:59] woman
[1:48:01] great is thy
[1:48:06] face be it unto
[1:48:09] thee
[1:48:11] even as
[1:48:17] thou as thou
[1:48:21] Wilt and this is the way she willed
[1:48:25] it and her daughter was made
[1:48:28] whole from that very
[1:48:34] hour Jesus did not say it will be as I
[1:48:37] will
[1:48:39] it but it will be as you will
[1:48:43] it if she would have willed it so it
[1:48:45] could have been two days a week a month
[1:48:49] or a
[1:48:51] year but when she she grabbed that word
[1:48:54] from
[1:48:55] God she took that personal word that
[1:48:59] Rama word from God and took it in her
[1:49:03] heart and purposed it in her heart all
[1:49:06] right if that's the way it is I want it
[1:49:08] from this moment right
[1:49:13] now I will it to be
[1:49:16] so from right
[1:49:21] now don't you you love
[1:49:25] him let's bow our hands
[1:49:31] together
[1:49:37] Hallelujah I wonder before we pray

[1:49:46] many that would say I want to be closer
[1:49:49] to him than I've ever been
[1:49:51] before I don't want my
[1:49:54] things I don't want my job the dead
[1:49:57] things I fill my life
[1:50:00] with to hinder
[1:50:03] me one thing about her

[1:50:09] Jesus Jesus can love you

[1:50:33] Hallelujah father as
[1:50:36] we come to the close of
[1:50:39] this portion of the service now we're
[1:50:41] asking
[1:50:43] you first of all that you'd forgive
[1:50:49] us I'll be the
[1:50:51] first
[1:50:53] to ask for your forgiveness
[1:50:57] today I've told you countless of times
[1:51:00] since
[1:51:00] you called me to be a preacher when I
[1:51:03] was just an 18y old
[1:51:05] boy I didn't understand it then and I
[1:51:08] sure don't understand it any better
[1:51:10] today why he'd ever want me
[1:51:15] anyhow unlike the sun I've not been so
[1:51:20] good unlike the moon which is now never
[1:51:22] disobeyed you I've fallen short of your
[1:51:27] glory I've claimed Lord
[1:51:31] I've asked you to take it away from me
[1:51:34] and
[1:51:37] I've I've reasoned and triy to say well
[1:51:41] I'm getting too old now I can't do
[1:51:43] it crazy me when you first call me I
[1:51:47] said I was too young to do
[1:51:50] it now I think I'm too old to do it
[1:51:55] it and yet you love me
[1:51:59] anyway I just have this feeling Lord
[1:52:02] down in my heart that I'm not the only
[1:52:04] one that's been there maybe not them in
[1:52:07] preaching
[1:52:09] but and them wondering why you love
[1:52:12] them there's people in this pace have
[1:52:14] fallen flat on their face so many
[1:52:17] times they couldn't even give an
[1:52:20] accurate count of it
[1:52:23] and yet you love them
[1:52:27] anyway when it comes right down to it
[1:52:29] they love
[1:52:31] you in spite of their failures their
[1:52:36] faults I trust today that we have heard
[1:52:39] your
[1:52:41] voice as it's knocked on the door of our
[1:52:45] hearts and me know as the artist of
[1:52:49] old and his painting went into the Hall
[1:52:51] of critics and

[1:52:55] find wrong about your painting he said

[1:53:02] you did not paint no handle to the door
[1:53:05] on the outside oh but you see sir I

[1:53:16] inside how many days and nights have you
[1:53:19] knocked and we've been busy we've had
[1:53:21] plans we've got this at the together

[1:53:39] when we give you attention and
[1:53:42] love I can remember as a boy Lord I had
[1:53:45] a flashback of it one day this
[1:53:49] week going to the elementary school
[1:53:53] there in
[1:53:55] Monella when the bell would ring for
[1:53:58] break I would go outside and stand on
[1:54:01] that
[1:54:04] playground I didn't have a
[1:54:06] friend it would ring again up in the day
[1:54:09] and I'd go out I'd stand out there by
[1:54:12] myself that happened in the first grade
[1:54:15] second grade third grade fourth
[1:54:19] grade it happened till I moved up to
[1:54:22] Middle
[1:54:23] school it happened then
[1:54:26] too and if anybody would even speak to
[1:54:29] me I just couldn't hardly believe it of
[1:54:32] course we is
[1:54:33] poor and I dress
[1:54:38] poor so I know what that feels
[1:54:41] like help me
[1:54:44] Jesus that I never treat you that
[1:54:48] way so here you are in the religion here
[1:54:51] you are in the churches
[1:54:53] and do people want you in their church
[1:54:56] do they want you to really
[1:54:58] move as you desire to move I'll ask our
[1:55:02] church today how many of us here want
[1:55:05] you to
[1:55:06] come save the Lost f with the Holy Ghost
[1:55:09] heal the sick change lives or do we want
[1:55:12] to put you in a form in a ritual a way
[1:55:15] that we can control you and tell you
[1:55:18] what you can and cannot
[1:55:21] do
[1:55:23] Lord Jesus help us
[1:55:26] today may we take our restraints off of
[1:55:29] you
[1:55:31] father not only in church but in every
[1:55:34] day of our
[1:55:36] life I believe you desire to pull these
[1:55:39] daughters closer to
[1:55:41] you when they're making their beds of a
[1:55:44] morning they go to singing and saying oh
[1:55:47] Jesus I love you so
[1:55:49] much making their children's breakfast
[1:55:53] the tears can go to trickling now of
[1:55:55] their
[1:55:56] eyes when they got their duties about
[1:55:58] the house or their job whatever it is
[1:56:00] that they do that they can go to
[1:56:02] worshiping you and you show up same with
