[7:13] I'd like to say thank you to everyone
[7:15] that came out today to be with the
[7:18] family.
[7:21] offer condolences
[7:25] and
[7:27] just to be there.
[7:30] Sometimes you don't know what words to
[7:32] say and sometimes words aren't really
[7:34] necessary, but just showing up and
[7:37] taking somebody by the hand, putting
[7:39] your arm around them, tell them you love
[7:41] them, you're thinking about them, that
[7:44] that really does more than all the words
[7:47] could say.
[7:49] Daniel Morgan Hatton, age 43,
[7:53] passed away on Tuesday, November 25th,
[7:58] 2025 at his home in Saltville, Virginia.
[8:03] He was preceded in death by Bailis and
[8:05] Janice Counts
[8:07] and Paul and Bula Hatton grandparents
[8:09] who loved him and loved the Lord
[8:13] and are reunited today.
[8:17] I just wanted to say that Daniel
[8:21] Daniel was a sweetheart. He was my
[8:23] buddy. He was uh he had such a sense of
[8:26] humor. And um he'll be greatly missed.
[8:31] I I did want to say this when I said he
[8:33] was a sweetheart. He also had a sweet
[8:35] tooth.
[8:36] And uh one time he his his mom and dad
[8:40] was he had such a sweet tooth they had
[8:42] to keep him away from candy a lot of
[8:44] times. and and uh he came over to the to
[8:48] Paul and Bulas one time and and Paul he
[8:51] would buy candy. He would find it on
[8:52] sale after Halloween or whatever and
[8:54] he'd have bags of candy. One time Daniel
[8:57] got missing and uh and when they found
[9:00] him he was under the bed with a bag of
[9:02] candy and he just about ate that whole
[9:04] bag of candy.
[9:06] And uh but his mom and dad tried to keep
[9:08] him away from all that sugar which was a
[9:10] good thing. I'm going to try to sing a
[9:12] song this morning or this afternoon.
[9:52] Crossing the calm sea with Jesus,
[9:58] the disciples
[10:00] were [singing] getting concerned.
[10:02] [music]
[10:05] The wind started violently blowing,
[10:08] [singing]
[10:10] yet he was asleep at the stern.
[10:16] Oh, does he not care that we perish?
[10:22] We're helpless and we're so afraid.
[10:29] But Jesus arose when they called him
[10:35] and said to them, "Where is your faith?
[10:39] [singing]
[10:40] Because you've prayed
[10:44] all night.
[10:46] [music]
[10:47] And you've held on with all your might.
[10:51] And child, your cries [music]
[10:55] have awoken. [singing]
[10:58] the master.
[11:03] Oh, he knows
[11:06] your voice.
[11:09] Lift your hands. It's time to rejoice.
[11:13] And child, your Christ
[11:17] have awoken [singing]
[11:20] the master.
[11:25] It hit you without any warning.
[11:29] [singing]
[11:31] Oh, the storm of your life had begun
[11:36] and seeing no hope in the distance.
[11:42] You're frightened to know [singing]
[11:44] where to run.
[11:46] Oh, by now your vessel is filling
[11:51] and you're thinking that you'll surely
[11:55] drown.
[11:57] You cried out for help from the Savior
[12:02] and you know you can't give up now
[12:06] because you've prayed
[12:10] all night
[12:12] and you've held on with all your might
[12:16] and child your cries
[12:20] have awoken
[12:22] the master.
[12:27] Oh, he knows
[12:30] your voice.
[12:32] Lift your hands. It's time to rejoice
[12:37] and child. Oh Christ
[12:40] have awoken
[12:42] the master
[12:47] [music] because ye you've prayed
[12:49] [singing]
[12:50] all night
[12:52] and you've held on with all your might.
[12:56] [singing] Child your cries [music]
[13:00] have awoken [singing]
[13:02] the master.
[13:07] Oh, he knows
[13:10] your voice.
[13:12] Lift your hands. It's time to rejoice.
[13:16] And child, your cries
[13:20] have awoken.
[13:22] The master
[13:39] certainly wish to extend our condolences
[13:42] to family and friends. I know it's
[13:47] such a difficult time whenever we think
[13:50] of
[13:52] an untimely death of what it seems to us
[13:55] as we look at it. uh told brother Bobby
[13:58] the other day and his wife that it's not
[14:01] natural in the course of natural life
[14:04] for a parent to lose a child. For those
[14:08] of you that haven't experienced that,
[14:11] it's it's quite a a different thing. We
[14:14] see our parents as they age and they've
[14:17] lived their life and we think, well, we
[14:19] can kind of accept that it's time for
[14:21] them to go. But when we see a child or a
[14:24] younger person that seemingly doesn't
[14:27] get to live out their three score and 10
[14:30] and we wonder why and we try to
[14:33] contemplate and understand it all. But
[14:35] I'm so glad when we don't understand to
[14:38] know that our father does understand and
[14:40] to know that our prayers are certainly
[14:42] with you all your family members. I'd
[14:45] like to read to you today from the book
[14:47] of Matthew chapter 16 25.
[14:50] Jesus said, "Whosoever will save his
[14:53] life shall lose it, and whosoever will
[14:57] lose his life for my sake shall find it.
[15:01] For what is a man profited if he shall
[15:04] gain the whole world and lose his own
[15:07] soul? Or what shall a man give in
[15:11] exchange for his soul?"
[15:15] I find the words of the Lord Jesus in
[15:18] dealing with u the passing of this life
[15:21] and deaths and the value of a soul that
[15:25] he would go this way in looking at it in
[15:28] almost a terms of buying and selling.
[15:32] And so I'd like to speak to you for a
[15:34] few moments today on the economy of God.
[15:37] And we know in any economy, whether it's
[15:39] the economy of our government, the
[15:40] economy of Europe, the economy of
[15:43] Africa, we have all different classes
[15:45] and categories of people that live in
[15:48] that economy. We have the poor, we have
[15:51] the really poor, we have the middle
[15:53] class, we have the rich, we have the
[15:56] ultra rich.
[15:58] Most of us probably are born and raised
[16:01] and lived in that lower part of it. So
[16:03] hard for us to relate to the ultra rich,
[16:05] the way they live and the things they go
[16:07] through. But yet I wonder if sometimes
[16:11] the kingdom of God is not closer to that
[16:14] than what we would think ourself. And
[16:17] when the Lord Jesus said this, he said,
[16:19] "What has a man profited?" So there
[16:22] again, he's talking about gaining
[16:24] something. What does it profit you if a
[16:27] man would gain the whole world and lose
[16:30] his own soul? or what would a man give
[16:34] in exchange for his soul? So, every one
[16:37] of you here today, whenever you see
[16:39] something you want, a suit, a dress,
[16:42] your sisters, a meal, you look at it and
[16:45] what do you do? You evaluate the price
[16:48] for what you're going to get back for
[16:50] it. You think, "No, no, it's it's not
[16:51] worth it. I'm not going to pay that for
[16:53] that. I'm not going to do it. I'm I want
[16:55] to go with this. I'd rather have my
[16:56] money than I would have that." which is
[16:58] basically what we are doing with our
[17:01] soul. So we look at the things of the
[17:03] world that's around us and the value of
[17:05] what they can give us and then we look
[17:07] at our our own souls and it's it's
[17:10] tendency among Christians for us to look
[17:13] and think everybody that serves the
[17:16] Lord, every Christian is going to be a
[17:19] David. They're all going to be lion
[17:21] killers. They're going to be giant
[17:24] killers. But actually from the
[17:26] scriptural account, David only killed
[17:29] one lion in his life, one bear and one
[17:34] giant. So he had a whole lot more
[17:37] non-giant killing days than he did giant
[17:41] killing days. We have people like Saul,
[17:45] a man that was God's choice to be the
[17:48] first king of Israel. And yet he was a
[17:50] man that dealt with stubbornness. He
[17:53] dealt with hard-headedness.
[17:55] He'd struggled with trying to keep God's
[17:58] word and God's program. And the prophet
[18:01] gives to us a beautiful analogy of such.
[18:06] And he says, "Lot wanted the world and
[18:08] God separated him up his world and
[18:11] separated Abraham and Lot." Lot being a
[18:14] type of a carnal believer who didn't
[18:17] think these things were true. He just
[18:19] went on down into Sodom. didn't have
[18:21] spunk as he called it to be able to what
[18:24] would call do what was right and wrong.
[18:27] And I love the way he says this. All
[18:30] these
[18:31] believers,
[18:33] as we could go on for hours, all these
[18:36] were like a bunch of change in your
[18:39] pocket. So I just pulled out of my
[18:42] pocket a penny,
[18:45] a nickel,
[18:47] a dime,
[18:49] a quarter. All of us are familiar with
[18:52] this. So now I want you to get in your
[18:54] mind that all these believers, he said,
[18:59] are like change out of your pocket in
[19:02] God's hands. So you pull out a bunch of
[19:05] change. There's pennies.
[19:09] There's nickels, dimes, quarters, half
[19:12] dollars, all in coins. Now, we know that
[19:16] our government has determined that
[19:18] they're no longer going to make pennies.
[19:22] Yet, all of us were raised using
[19:24] pennies.
[19:27] And the last ones that they made, they
[19:30] actually put certain marks on them from
[19:33] the mint. And I'm told that in a matter
[19:36] of time that those pennies will be worth
[19:40] millions of dollars
[19:43] because they are special pennies. Now,
[19:46] it won't be long. You've already seen it
[19:47] probably as I have when you go through
[19:49] drive-throughs and whatever, we're
[19:50] running a shortage of pennies. So, your
[19:52] price will be rounded up to the next
[19:55] nickel, which is going to cost you more
[19:58] money.
[20:00] So, then they'll come to a spot, of
[20:02] course, that nickels won't be worth
[20:03] doing it. then they're rounded up to the
[20:05] next dime. Now, I wonder if sometimes
[20:09] believers aren't this way. We look and
[20:12] we think, "Oh my, every real Christian,
[20:15] every real believer, there'll be a
[20:17] David. They'll be this, that, and the
[20:19] other." Friends, I hate to disappoint
[20:21] you, but heaven is going to have all
[20:23] kinds of people that struggle with all
[20:26] kinds of things in life. [snorts]
[20:28] Some of them the Lord I believe even has
[20:31] to take them early in life when he can
[20:36] catch them ready.
[20:38] You see Saul leaving in the type of
[20:41] legacy that he left behind. You could
[20:43] never say about Saul that he was a man
[20:45] after God's own heart. You could never
[20:47] say about Omry. You could never say
[20:49] about Rioam. You could never say about
[20:51] many of the kings of Israel. You
[20:53] couldn't even say that about King
[20:55] Solomon.
[20:56] A man who built the house of God. A man
[21:00] who had such a legacy that we think was
[21:03] so tremendous. And yet the Bible says in
[21:06] his old age that he he catered of course
[21:09] to strange women. What the Bible called
[21:11] him. Married the daughter of Pharaoh,
[21:13] the daughter of this one, the daughter
[21:15] of that one. And the Bible says that his
[21:18] heart was not like the heart of his
[21:20] father David which was perfect.
[21:25] Wow. And yet God when this man was born,
[21:28] when this baby boy was born, his name
[21:31] was Solomon. Great name, means peace,
[21:34] wonderful name. But God renamed him. And
[21:37] God called him Jedadiah. One of the very
[21:40] few people in the Bible that God ever
[21:42] renamed and said, "He'll be my son.
[21:45] He'll be mine." But yet his heart was
[21:48] not perfect like David. So what do you
[21:51] think?
[21:52] Should we just take him out of the
[21:54] passages of scripture and say, "Well,
[21:55] because he was not like David, there's
[21:58] no way he's going to be saved." Oh, but
[22:01] he will be.
[22:03] So, when we look at people that we know,
[22:05] maybe people in our families, people in
[22:07] our church, people in our friends, and
[22:09] we look at them and said, "My, you know,
[22:11] they struggle with this and they
[22:13] struggle with that, and will they ever
[22:15] be a David?" More than likely not. To be
[22:18] honest with you, I wonder if there's any
[22:19] of us here today that even be a David.
[22:23] I'm not talking about what your mama
[22:24] calls you. I'm talking about what God
[22:26] calls you.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; Or would most of us
[22:31] be more like this little copper guy I've
[22:33] got in my hand.
[22:35] &gt;&gt; Now, it takes five of these
[22:39] to make this.
[22:41] 10 of those
[22:45] to make this.
[22:49] Takes 25
[22:52] of those to make this. Anybody know off
[22:55] the top of your head how many it takes
[22:57] to make a $100? 10,000
[23:03] 10,000
[23:06] pennies to make a $100 bill.
[23:10] So, what do you say? Let's just start
[23:13] picketing and banning all coins
[23:17] cuz after all, 10,000. Can you imagine
[23:20] if you had to buy something for $100 and
[23:24] you was carrying 10,000 pennies in your
[23:27] pocket?
[23:30] But are they worthless? No.
[23:33] You see, the grace of God is extended in
[23:36] so many ways in various people's lives.
[23:40] I myself have never been a great person.
[23:42] Have never had any desire to be one.
[23:45] What I mainly want to be is just a
[23:48] Christian that serves the Lord. And when
[23:51] my life is done and I'm rolled up like
[23:53] this, that hopefully the preachers can
[23:56] find something good to say about me. I
[23:59] really don't have a goal, a desire that
[24:03] congressmen, senators, the president,
[24:05] the flag would be flown at half mass.
[24:08] It's not your desire, is it? But when we
[24:11] stand before the Lord that he'll be able
[24:14] to look us in the face and say, "Well
[24:17] done."
[24:19] If I would measure myself by you, I'd
[24:22] probably be greatly disappointed. If I'd
[24:24] measure myself by great men, I'd be
[24:27] greatly disappointed.
[24:29] But even if I'm no more than this little
[24:33] copper guy right here. Now, some of
[24:34] y'all have probably got them in a little
[24:36] tin can at home or whatever it is. You
[24:39] better cash them in before they get of
[24:41] no value.
[24:43] But think what they've bought. Now, I'm
[24:46] not really that old. Not yet. But I can
[24:49] remember when this could buy several
[24:51] things. When I used to go to the store
[24:52] as a kid
[24:55] and if we took all these types of
[24:58] Christians out of our church and we
[25:01] wanted only the perfect ones, the
[25:03] faultless ones, the ones that man, they
[25:06] was constantly victorious. Every time
[25:08] you seen them, there's on the mountain.
[25:11] Mag Christians, I call them mag
[25:14] Christians. I've always wanted a church
[25:16] with mate Christians, but I get the
[25:18] Chinesemade ones.
[25:21] They got faults, they got flaws, they
[25:23] got troubles, they got issues,
[25:27] but actually I can relate to them better
[25:29] because I have problems. I have faults.
[25:33] I have issues. God bless you, brother
[25:36] Copper. Sister Copper, my name is
[25:38] Copper, too.
[25:41] But what I've been able to do with these
[25:44] the 69 years of my life when I used to
[25:47] go to the store at Happy Top, the little
[25:49] community where I lived, and I'd walk up
[25:52] there about a mile or so from my house
[25:55] and get a big thick cut baloney
[25:57] sandwich, with tomato, mayonnaise. I'd
[26:01] give $5 for one of them things right
[26:02] now.
[26:04] And I'd reach down in my pockets, me and
[26:06] my brother, and would pick up pop
[26:08] bottles along the way. You remember the
[26:09] pop bottles? no deposit, no return, and
[26:12] would trade them out and come up there.
[26:15] If bologoney sandwiches would been $100,
[26:17] I'd been an old man for I never even got
[26:19] one.
[26:22] So I wonder
[26:24] whenever we look at people's lives and
[26:26] we think well this this he he he
[26:28] struggled with that and this one
[26:29] struggle with that and but I love the
[26:33] analogy
[26:36] that the coins
[26:39] you pull a bunch of chains pennies
[26:41] nickels dimes quarters
[26:46] out of your pockets
[26:48] and you put them in God's man.
[26:52] So God could take a penny, a nickel, a
[26:55] dime, a quarter.
[26:57] Ignorant, unlearned people, people that
[26:59] struggle with all kinds of things. And
[27:01] yet God says, "I'll take them. I'll take
[27:05] them." So what should we do? Should we
[27:08] keep all this in our pocket? And you
[27:09] say, "But but it's not that much."
[27:11] Really? It's not that much. I
[27:12] understand. Yeah, I understand. Because
[27:14] I read about a little boy in the Bible
[27:16] that um he skipped out school one day
[27:20] and he heard about a big meeting that
[27:21] was going on and he went over and there
[27:23] was Jesus and he was doing all kinds of
[27:26] wonderful things and this little boy
[27:27] just had just enough lunch for himself
[27:29] just a few fishes and few loaves
[27:33] and as long as he had kept that in his
[27:36] hands that's all it would have been but
[27:40] he gave it to the disciples and they in
[27:42] turn brought it to Jesus. Jesus and Jes
[27:45] in his hands just lunch for hungry
[27:47] little boy. But in the hands of Jesus,
[27:51] it could feed 5,000
[27:54] with all types of leftovers.
[27:58] So I'm asking you today, not just for
[28:00] Daniel now. He's lived his life and he's
[28:02] gone. And I believe with all of my heart
[28:06] we will see him again.
[28:10] But I'm asking you, what are you going
[28:12] to do with your life? Your penny, your
[28:15] nickel, your dime. Man, I mean, you
[28:16] might be great here today. You might be
[28:18] a $5 bill. Wow, that must be awesome to
[28:22] be a $5 bill. Most of my life has been
[28:26] in pockets of people,
[28:29] pockets.
[28:32] But if I can give this one little penny
[28:34] right here to the Lord Jesus of my life
[28:39] and let him do something with it to help
[28:41] others and I walk up before him that day
[28:45] and I long to hear these words, "Well
[28:48] done, my good and faithful servant."
[28:53] Is that what you want?
[28:57] I was able by the grace of God to
[28:58] baptize Daniel some time back when he
[29:01] gave his heart to the Lord, rededicate
[29:03] his life. Boy, he knew the word. He was
[29:05] around church and stuff. But Daniel,
[29:07] like others, struggle with this and
[29:10] that. Was he ever a giant killer? He may
[29:13] have killed more than what I knew, what
[29:14] his daddy mama knew. Maybe compared to
[29:17] some of you that live consecrated your
[29:19] entire life. That's wonderful. That's a
[29:21] wonderful testimony. I gave my heart to
[29:23] the Lord when I was 12. never spoke,
[29:25] never drank, never committed adultery,
[29:27] been married once. Um, don't have none
[29:30] of them things to deal with. But I was
[29:31] as lost as loss could be.
[29:35] None of those things that I mentioned to
[29:37] you wins me any merit. None of those
[29:40] things makes me holy. None of those
[29:43] things makes me pure. It's the grace of
[29:47] almighty God.
[29:49] I'm glad it didn't go that way. That
[29:51] means I have less scars to deal with and
[29:53] less in my mind. But I am no more holy
[29:56] or no more righteous than those of you
[29:58] who lived a horrible, terrible life.
[30:01] Because in reality,
[30:04] it's what winds up in his hands.
[30:08] I'm just so glad today that Daniel, he
[30:12] might not have been more than a penny.
[30:14] That don't sound like much. I agree. in
[30:17] my pocket
[30:19] and Daniel's pocket, it wouldn't have
[30:21] been much. But if Daniel could take that
[30:24] penny and give it over to the Lord
[30:27] Jesus,
[30:29] let me read to you what the prophet
[30:30] said. 100 carnal believers will never
[30:32] stand in the presence of a genuine
[30:34] Christian that's separated living in
[30:36] Christ Jesus. He can only take a penny's
[30:39] worth. That's all he's got. But see,
[30:42] people say, "Well, I don't believe in
[30:43] healing. I don't believe in these
[30:44] things." It's just a penny. That's a
[30:45] penny's worth. That's all they can buy.
[30:47] But I love this part. Don't stop him.
[30:52] Just let him alone.
[30:55] Just let him alone. Just a penny. That's
[30:59] all there'll ever be. But say, "Lord
[31:01] bless you, my brother."
[31:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Amen.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; Wow. Can you imagine a $100 bill looking
[31:09] at a penny and say, "God bless you, my
[31:11] brother." But we tend to look down on
[31:13] them if they don't have the same value
[31:16] printed across them that we do.
[31:20] God help us.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; What are you today, friend?
[31:28] May God strengthen, encourage, and help
[31:30] your family members. I know as the days
[31:33] go by, you will start drawing from what
[31:35] I call the vault of memories.
[31:38] You will categorize those memories.
[31:41] Some will be so painful they will hurt
[31:44] so bad. My daughter Erica has been gone
[31:47] now for two years. I still can't hardly
[31:50] stand to look at a picture of her. She's
[31:53] on my phone on my text every day it
[31:55] comes up. Carol, Erica, and Lis. Just
[31:58] for me to look at a picture of her, it
[32:01] tears my heart out.
[32:07] But I know what she gave to God.
[32:12] It's there waiting. Each one of you have
[32:15] something that he's put in your hand.
[32:17] Couple loaves, few fishes. God may have
[32:20] given some of the more the rest of you a
[32:21] boatload. That's wonderful.
[32:25] But as we go along life's journey, let's
[32:27] see what we can do. Maybe instead of
[32:29] looking down on those that struggle with
[32:31] this and struggle with that, think, "Oh
[32:33] man, I don't know. I hope they'll be
[32:34] there. I hope they'll be there. I'm just
[32:37] kind of hoping I will. When you look
[32:39] around, you think, "Oh, boy. I'm not
[32:41] sure about him." Well, I don't know
[32:42] about this guy. Boy, that lady there,
[32:44] man alive. One of the greatest surprises
[32:46] when you get there. It ain't going to be
[32:48] that this one, that, and the other made
[32:49] it. It'll probably be that you did.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; That by the grace of God, he helped you
[32:54] with all the things you had and you were
[32:57] stamped a penny and you gave that to
[33:01] God. But with it, he made change. He
[33:06] helped people. You'll realize after a
[33:09] while how important these little pennies
[33:11] are. When you start paying more for your
[33:13] Big Mac, you're going to start paying
[33:15] more for your Diet Coke. You're going to
[33:17] start paying more for a lot of stuff.
[33:18] Cuz they ain't going to round it down.
[33:21] They're going to round it up.
[33:24] Why? Cuz the pennies are no longer here.
[33:28] We're waiting for the last elect seed to
[33:31] come in.
[33:32] So we can leave this place. But I wonder
[33:36] if the last one might even be a foolish
[33:38] virgin. A penny's worth in the economy
[33:43] of God.
[33:45] I just want to be there, don't you?
[33:48] We commit our brethren into the care
[33:52] and great fornowledge of our God. Let's
[33:55] bow our heads together.
[34:00] Heavenly Father, as we stand here today
[34:02] and
[34:04] Lord, it's a sadness certainly, but yet
[34:07] Lord God, we're so grateful.
[34:10] Many of us pennies sitting here together
[34:13] and we can be thankful for what you've
[34:15] done for us.
[34:17] And we will stand beside great people on
[34:20] that day and think, "What have we done?
[34:23] What have we accomplished?"
[34:26] But yet you love pennies and nickels and
[34:29] dimes and quarters. And though it would
[34:33] take 10,000
[34:35] pennies
[34:37] to make a $100 bill, yet they have their
[34:40] place in the economy of God.
[34:44] I pray father for the family, parents,
[34:47] siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, all
[34:51] the loved ones, friends that are here
[34:52] today to say goodbye, Lord Jesus. We
[34:56] believe that we're looking and it's very
[35:00] close to us at that great day of
[35:02] resurrection. May there not be a one of
[35:04] us missing. Father, may we take the
[35:07] penny value out of our lives and put it
[35:11] in your hands and see what you can do
[35:13] with it. Lord, bless the family and
[35:16] friends, Father, as they go shortly and
[35:19] we place this body as a seed down into
[35:22] the dust of the earth. Grant it, Father,
[35:24] in Jesus name we pray. Amen.

[39:35] Don't you [music and singing] hear the

[40:28] When [singing]
[40:29] our [music] days shall know their

[40:39] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[40:39] &gt;&gt; And the king [music] commands the spirit
[40:43] to be free.
[40:48] [music] Never [singing] more
[40:50] in anguish laden
[40:54] we shall reach that [music and singing]
[40:56] lovely
[40:59] when they ring those [music] golden
[41:02] bells for you [singing] and me.
[41:08] Don't you hear [music]

[42:01] [music]
[42:24] &gt;&gt; [music]
[42:28] &gt;&gt; There's a river
[42:31] somewhere
[42:34] called [music] Jordan.
[42:39] They say that
[42:43] [music]
[42:48] [music]
[42:55] I don't know what he's saying.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; [music]
[43:08] &gt;&gt; There's a river
[43:11] somewhere
[43:14] called Jordan.
[43:19] They say that
[43:22] it's deep and
[43:24] [music] it's wide.
[43:30] [music] They say
[43:32] that the king and [singing]
[43:35] [music] the beggar
[43:40] on that shore will
[43:43] stand side
[43:46] by side
[43:49] [music]
[43:50] at the crossing
[43:55] [music]
[43:56] of the Jordan.
[44:01] Why should I be

[44:05] There will be someone

[44:30] That river [music] is so dark

[44:39] [music] It will pass like

[44:48] [music]
[44:50] My soul will awaken

[45:57] [music]
[46:13] Brother Joe, he was a little nervous and
[46:15] he said he forgot to read the rest of
[46:17] the obituary. So, he asked me to do it
[46:20] before I close in prayer. If you've ever
[46:23] stood here, you understand how
[46:25] nerve-wracking it can be. So, we'll give
[46:27] him a little bit of grace uh in those
[46:30] things. Daniel was survived by his son
[46:33] Patrick Hayden and his wife Alexis and
[46:35] of course his parents Bobby and Sherry
[46:39] Counts Hayden, his brothers Jonathan
[46:40] Hayden and his wife Cara, David Hayden
[46:44] and his wife Jordan James or Jamie
[46:47] Hatton and Philip Hayden, his sisters
[46:50] are Grace, husband Matthew Carter
[46:53] and Shannon Riley and several ne nieces
[46:56] and of course several nephews as well.
[46:59] I'll say this before I pray. I thought
[47:01] about brother Donnie as he was preaching
[47:02] and how accurate it is. And you know, as
[47:06] a pastor myself, you go for a while and
[47:09] and God just expands your vision into
[47:11] the scriptures and sometimes you think
[47:13] you you've got it figured out. But
[47:16] there's one thing I've come to
[47:17] understand. I think the grace of God is
[47:19] so far be [clears throat] vast and so
[47:22] beyond what we can actually see and
[47:24] fully understand.
[47:26] You know, we like to see somebody who
[47:27] spends 20 or 30 years serving the Lord
[47:29] and and in our mind we we understand and
[47:32] we say, "Okay, well, they made it." But
[47:34] the thief on the cross, as he was
[47:36] preaching, that come to my mind that the
[47:38] thief on the cross, all he said is,
[47:40] "Remember me, Lord." And that was it. He
[47:43] said, "Today you'll be with me in
[47:45] paradise." Because it's when the heart
[47:47] is ready, and that's what counts. And
[47:49] the beautiful part is only God knows
[47:52] when the heart's ready. So we just have
[47:54] to say, you know what, the grace of God
[47:56] is the grace of God. I need it as much
[47:58] in my life as you need it in yours.
[48:01] Thought this morning about 1
[48:03] Thessalonians chapter 4 where Paul said
[48:05] he would not have us ignorant, not have
[48:07] us understanding, that we have no sorrow
[48:10] as those or we we sorrow not as those
[48:12] who have no hope. And I thought, Lord,
[48:14] how beautiful it is that just beyond the
[48:17] veil where our eyes cannot see it,
[48:19] there's more of them than there are of
[48:21] us. just beyond the veil. If God would
[48:24] open your eyes, even in this building
[48:26] right now, there's far more than what
[48:28] you realize. It looks like there's just
[48:30] a few, but there's so much more of us.
[48:32] And we've got more to look forward on
[48:34] that side than we do on this side. Let's
[48:37] bow our heads and have a word of prayer.
[48:40] Lord Jesus, we come to you, Father, and
[48:42] we just want to say thank you for this
[48:44] day. It's a day, Lord, that's um
[48:47] difficult.
[48:51] We really at times don't have the words
[48:53] Lord to put into our feelings. But yet
[48:56] you see our tears.
[48:58] It's a language that you understand. We
[49:00] sew Lord in tears and we reap in joy.
[49:04] We're asking you, Father, that you would
[49:05] come, Lord, that you would bring a
[49:07] comfort. Lord, we hear these words in
[49:09] theory. We read them from the scripture
[49:11] and we say how good they are. But until
[49:14] you live through it, Lord, until you
[49:16] have to ask for you to be the comforter,
[49:18] when there seems to be no comfort, when
[49:20] the days go and it gets hard, we're
[49:22] asking that you would come and comfort
[49:24] the near family here, Lord. And it's a
[49:26] [snorts] loss, Lord. I'm sure it was a
[49:27] loss to to Daniel's friends, those who
[49:30] knew him, probably knew him and where he
[49:32] lived in a way that we didn't. And I'm
[49:34] sure you had a heart of compassion for
[49:36] them as well, as we all do. Lord, we in
[49:38] our own way, we have our hearts of
[49:40] compassion. We ask you, Father, as you
[49:42] have chosen to take him from this life,
[49:44] but not from your presence. We ask,
[49:46] Lord, that you would bring a comfort to
[49:49] all those who know him, a comfort to the
[49:50] family. Lord, we just commit him, Lord,
[49:53] as our brother said, as a seed into the
[49:54] ground that one day we might see in a
[49:57] resurrection. We'll see that, Lord. We
[50:00] believe around the corner will be so
[50:02] soon, Father. How can it be with the
[50:04] signs of the times that we're seeing,
[50:05] Lord? Well, whenever that would be,
[50:07] Lord, we're choosing with by faith,
[50:09] Lord. Our Christian walk is a complete
[50:12] walk of faith. We we believe when what
[50:14] we cannot understand, we just by faith
[50:16] believe you and your word. So we're
[50:18] asking for mercy and grace and help for
[50:21] the family today. In Jesus Christ's name
[50:23] we ask it. Amen. God bless you. The
[50:27] funeral directors will come.
