[23:52] that's what it's been for me for the
[23:54] last couple couple years uh just
[23:56] bringing me down because so many things
[23:58] have been happening

[24:21] back's hurting I said well that's just
[24:24] next
[24:25] so one healing after another and that's
[24:27] what I believe is I forgot to take the

[24:33] milligrams that stuff a day in the last
[24:35] couple days I've just forgot to take it
[24:37] I've been so busy

[24:43] you didn't tell me not to testify about
[24:44] that but I'm going to anyway so
[24:47] oh well let's just bow our heads and go
[24:49] to the Lord in prayer

[24:59] can Lord and we bow our heads to the
[25:01] ground from which we come
[25:03] and Lord we want to lift up your name
[25:06] and give you the praise and the glory
[25:08] and the honor for the things that you do
[25:10] for your children
[25:11] Lord we know God that your words that
[25:13] out of our belly shall flow rivers of
[25:15] Living Water
[25:17] and Lord of love and peace and joy and
[25:21] meekness and long-suffering and
[25:24] temperance
[25:25] goodness and gentleness and godliness
[25:27] these things come from us Lord not that
[25:31] we have done anything Lord but because
[25:34] of you because your word said it Lord
[25:37] and that's what we grasp a hold of this
[25:40] morning Lord as we gather together as a
[25:43] little bride around the world your
[25:46] people are gathering together Lord and
[25:48] they may archive this service Lord and
[25:50] they may need a healing they may need a
[25:52] touch from you Lord and it's your word
[25:55] that comes forth from here God it's not
[25:58] a man it's not a person there's not one
[26:01] of us that have the power to heal but
[26:04] you gave us the authority to believe and
[26:07] to know these things would be true we
[26:09] don't have to question your word Lord we
[26:12] just simply believe it and hold on to
[26:15] that that's our promise father from you
[26:17] we ask you to come down and be with us
[26:20] this morning be in each and every one
[26:23] lift their hearts o God from the Brown
[26:25] encourage us Lord as we speak to one
[26:29] another or lay our hands on one another
[26:31] let your word take place God that from
[26:34] we would just touch one another we could
[26:37] be healed you said if we laid our hands
[26:39] on one another we would be healed it
[26:42] didn't say we had to pray it didn't say
[26:43] we had to have an emotion from it
[26:45] because Faith doesn't come by an emotion
[26:48] but it comes by just believing in your
[26:51] word
[26:52] so come and be with us Lord touch these
[26:55] fingers Lord in the ministry and the

[52:40] Burdette and his church is going to come
[52:41] over and be with us on September the
[52:43] 23rd and the 24th which will be Saturday
[52:45] night and Sunday morning we're looking
[52:47] forward to that great time of Fellowship
[52:50] together and just see what the Lord will
[52:52] do for us
[52:53] also wanted to share with you brother
[52:57] Wade Altman maybe many of you knew that
[52:59] he'd gotten sick this week and had to
[53:02] take him to the hospital and according
[53:05] to the doctors once it got there he made
[53:08] it in the nick of time because his
[53:11] Widowmaker was
[53:12] trying to make a widow out of his wife
[53:15] sister Hannah so they were able to do a
[53:18] couple of stands and she text me earlier
[53:20] this morning and she was on her way to
[53:22] the hospital to pick him up and bring
[53:24] him home
[53:25] so we're grateful for the mercy of the
[53:27] Lord to our brother we appreciate
[53:29] everything doctors can do for us we're
[53:32] thankful for that so I know they would
[53:34] appreciate your prayers and calls and
[53:37] whatever more to just to let them know
[53:38] that we love him and and we appreciate
[53:40] him let's turn today if you would to the
[53:42] Book of Mark chapter 11 verse 23.
[53:46] we've been looking at the bride's rights
[53:51] for several services and
[53:54] I'm not sure I'll ever get done with it
[53:56] but we'll enjoy dealing with as long as
[53:57] we have time
[53:59] but I'd like to speak on one this
[54:01] morning that's
[54:03] very very powerful wonderful yet so
[54:07] simple
[54:09] and yet we wonder how in the world
[54:11] should we be given this right
[54:15] Mark 11 23.
[54:18] for verily I say unto you that whosoever
[54:22] shall say
[54:24] unto this mountain
[54:26] be thou removed
[54:28] and be cast into the sea
[54:31] and shall not doubt in his heart
[54:34] but believe
[54:37] that those things which he saith
[54:42] shall come to pass
[54:44] he shall have
[54:45] whatsoever
[54:48] he saith
[54:52] what scripture him
[54:54] early we'll read it again I say unto you
[54:57] that whosoever shall say
[55:00] unto this mountain
[55:02] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[55:04] the sea
[55:06] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[55:08] Shall Believe
[55:11] that those things which he saith
[55:15] shall come to pass
[55:18] he shall have whatsoever
[55:21] you saith
[55:23] therefore I say unto you that whatsoever
[55:26] things you desire
[55:28] When you pray
[55:29] believe that you receive them
[55:33] and you shall have them
[55:36] Mark 7 25.
[55:40] for a certain woman whose young daughter
[55:42] had an unclean Spirit heard of him and
[55:45] came and fell at his feet
[55:47] the woman was a Greek a sorrow
[55:50] Phoenician by Nation
[55:52] and she besought him that he would cast
[55:54] forth the devil out of her daughter
[55:58] but Jesus said unto her
[56:00] that the children first be filled for it
[56:03] is not meat to take the children's bread
[56:07] to cast it to dogs
[56:10] I wonder how many of us would have been
[56:12] left standing
[56:13] to ask the other part of this and Jesus
[56:17] said that to us
[56:18] would have got so offended we would have
[56:21] been so mad we'd have walked out of
[56:23] there would have said that guy's a learn
[56:25] a false prophet why he ain't the love of
[56:28] God he was the very epitome of love
[56:32] but Jesus knows who he can try
[56:37] he's going to use this woman as an
[56:39] example she's been preached on for
[56:41] thousands of years
[56:42] we don't even know her name
[56:45] now notice but Jesus said unto her let
[56:47] the children first be filled for it is
[56:50] not me to take the children's bread and
[56:52] cast it unto the dogs
[56:56] she answered and said unto him
[57:00] yes Lord
[57:02] yes Lord
[57:04] yep the dogs
[57:07] under listen notices under the table
[57:11] eat of the children's crumbs
[57:17] I imagine the Lord Jesus was as we would
[57:20] say Blown Away
[57:24] now there were a few people in the New
[57:26] Testament that astonished him
[57:30] which is quite impressive when you can
[57:32] astonish God
[57:38] and he said unto her
[57:41] for this logos
[57:47] for this logos saying English but the
[57:52] Greek is logos
[57:53] for this logos
[57:56] go thy way
[57:58] the devil is gone
[58:02] out of thy daughter
[58:04] wow can you imagine just that woman
[58:07] saying the right thing
[58:12] for this saying go thy way
[58:17] the devil is gone out of thy daughter
[58:20] and when she was come to her house
[58:23] she found the devil
[58:25] gone out
[58:28] that's Jubilee time ain't it when you
[58:31] find the devil's done been made to leave
[58:33] but it was not notice Jesus didn't say
[58:36] because of my saying
[58:39] but because of your saying
[58:43] she found the devil gone out and her
[58:45] daughter laid
[58:47] up on the bed
[58:49] and we'd love to be remembered today as
[58:51] we pray
[58:53] it's if you would
[58:57] Heavenly Father we have
[59:01] an awesome
[59:02] portion of your word laying before us
[59:05] today
[59:07] this was one of the things that stumped
[59:09] your prophet
[59:11] because he said you didn't say if I say
[59:14] but if you see
[59:17] so we know there must be an
[59:18] understanding to this
[59:21] I dare say that every Christian that's
[59:24] been saved in here very long at all
[59:27] have tried to speak the word
[59:31] and many of them would say the same
[59:34] thing I would have to say well
[59:37] it didn't work
[59:39] or I said it wrong or something
[59:42] but yet we know you cannot speak
[59:45] anything that is not true
[59:48] so there must be an understanding
[59:51] to this word
[59:53] I pray you'd help us today
[59:55] speak to every heart
[59:57] Lord God those that can't be here
[59:59] because of sickness or whatever more
[1:00:01] they're streaming May the presence of
[1:00:03] God go in their living room their
[1:00:05] bedroom and their office wherever they
[1:00:06] are
[1:00:08] father we believe this will be a notable
[1:00:10] day for us
[1:00:12] as the children of God you saw every
[1:00:15] hand that was uplifted minister to the
[1:00:17] needs of your people we pray today in
[1:00:20] Jesus name
[1:00:21] amen God bless you you may be seated
[1:00:29] so what
[1:00:32] does speak the word actually mean
[1:00:36] that's what I want to speak to you about
[1:00:38] speak the word
[1:00:41] probably every Christian here today
[1:00:44] in your daily walk
[1:00:46] before the Lord
[1:00:48] you speak the word
[1:00:50] you quote scripture you
[1:00:53] talk about the things of God and if you
[1:00:56] don't you should
[1:00:58] but is that the same thing
[1:01:01] that Jesus was referring to
[1:01:05] that just by quoting the written word
[1:01:08] the logos that you would have whatsoever
[1:01:12] you said
[1:01:14] I guess for me I could understand it
[1:01:16] understood it a lot easier and better
[1:01:19] had Jesus said if you will just say what
[1:01:22] I say and then you won't doubt what I
[1:01:24] say then you can have what I say
[1:01:29] but that wasn't the way he said it
[1:01:31] it said if you'll take my word and
[1:01:34] you'll say to this mountain and you
[1:01:36] don't doubt what you've said
[1:01:40] not what I've said
[1:01:42] if you won't doubt what you have said
[1:01:44] then you can actually have what you said
[1:01:49] so every child of God apparently
[1:01:53] has a right and an ability
[1:01:57] to be inspired by God himself
[1:02:00] and to not just repeat scripture and
[1:02:03] repeat quotes and we should do that we
[1:02:05] should fill our spirit our minds our
[1:02:08] memory with the word of God so that
[1:02:10] whenever we're in a battle that we can
[1:02:12] quote that to the devil but that's not
[1:02:15] the same thing as this here
[1:02:18] this is something that it takes divine
[1:02:21] inspiration
[1:02:22] to be able to strike our hearts and make
[1:02:26] it work now this something that's going
[1:02:27] to happen every day of Our Lives no it
[1:02:30] ain't would it happen because we have
[1:02:32] the ability to do it we don't have the
[1:02:34] ability it'll be when father
[1:02:37] chooses to use your mouth
[1:02:41] to say his word
[1:02:44] so what might must I do then brother
[1:02:46] Donnie until the Lord chooses for that
[1:02:49] time or what you must do is you say his
[1:02:52] word every day of your life you got a
[1:02:55] need to confess his word he's my
[1:02:57] deliverer he's my healer is everything
[1:02:59] that I need and you're saying his word
[1:03:01] but then there come a time when you will
[1:03:05] need it most that he will take your
[1:03:07] mouth
[1:03:09] and he will speak his word
[1:03:12] then it's no longer you it's no longer
[1:03:15] you saying it but it's the father saying
[1:03:18] it now there are examples of course in
[1:03:19] the Old Testament and the new and we'll
[1:03:21] look at a few of them As We Lay this
[1:03:23] Foundation a little bit and Exodus
[1:03:25] chapter 14 verse 13 and Moses said unto
[1:03:27] the people fear ye not stand still and
[1:03:30] see the salvation of the Lord which he
[1:03:33] will show to you today for the Egyptians
[1:03:36] whom ye have seen today you shall see
[1:03:40] them again no more forever the Lord
[1:03:46] shall fight for you and you shall hold
[1:03:49] your peace
[1:03:51] and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore
[1:03:54] Christ thou unto me
[1:03:57] speak
[1:04:00] unto the children of Israel that they go
[1:04:03] forward now I want you to notice there's
[1:04:05] a combination in these verses and how
[1:04:08] they tie together in order to make this
[1:04:11] successful
[1:04:13] so Moses tells the children that God is
[1:04:16] going to smack the Egyptians they've
[1:04:18] they've dealt with them for years and
[1:04:20] years they've been under their bondage
[1:04:22] and their slavery now he says the
[1:04:25] gypsums that you see now you'll never
[1:04:28] see them again because the Lord is going
[1:04:30] to fight for you
[1:04:32] but apparently Moses is still tore up
[1:04:35] you know the Moses of course writes this
[1:04:37] book of Exodus and he doesn't tell us
[1:04:40] what actually transpired between verse
[1:04:43] 14 and verse 15 but it would lead you to
[1:04:46] believe that Moses either one than his
[1:04:48] Spirit or he turns away from whether
[1:04:50] people can hear him and Moses is still
[1:04:53] really in this dilemma and he don't know
[1:04:56] what to say and he's asking God because
[1:04:58] notice the response of God and the Lord
[1:05:01] said unto Moses wherefore Christ thou
[1:05:03] unto me but neither one of these verses
[1:05:06] actually notes that he cried to the Lord
[1:05:09] so it must have been a cry that was not
[1:05:13] either it was not either audible or it
[1:05:15] was something that he turned away from
[1:05:18] then and then God responds back and said
[1:05:21] Moses wherefore Christ thou unto me
[1:05:23] speak unto the children of Israel that
[1:05:27] they go forward now remember the Red Sea
[1:05:29] is before them Pharaoh's Army behind
[1:05:31] them they've got a mountain range to the
[1:05:33] right and mountain range to the left and
[1:05:35] they're in a tiny opening there just big
[1:05:38] enough for them to fit in it and here
[1:05:40] they are they're facing this big dilemma
[1:05:42] now I want you to notice the way God
[1:05:44] addressed this because God doesn't tell
[1:05:46] him to speak to the water
[1:05:48] God doesn't tell him to speak to the
[1:05:50] mountains God doesn't tell him to speak
[1:05:53] to the Egyptians but God tells him speak
[1:05:56] unto the children of Israel that they go
[1:05:59] forward now women how in the world are
[1:06:01] we going to get the water to roll back
[1:06:03] well they're speaking and then there's
[1:06:05] action that's coupled together with word
[1:06:09] talking
[1:06:10] now speak unto the children of Israel
[1:06:14] that they may go forward but notice the
[1:06:17] reaction to this voice of God but lift
[1:06:21] up thou thy rod now remember that I
[1:06:24] thought he's supposed to talk I thought
[1:06:26] he's supposed to speak lift up thou thou
[1:06:29] Rod out then stretch out thine hand over
[1:06:32] the sea and divide it and the children
[1:06:34] of Israel Quran dry ground through the
[1:06:37] midst of the sea so here Moses is told
[1:06:41] to speak to the children of Israel how
[1:06:44] many believes that actions speak louder
[1:06:47] than words sometimes
[1:06:49] now what's amazing is as far as Moses
[1:06:52] standing goes all right children glory
[1:06:54] to God the Lord told me to tell you all
[1:06:56] something I'm going to stand up here
[1:06:58] today and I'm going to preach to you a
[1:06:59] message about we're going to open the
[1:07:01] Red Sea we don't have any example where
[1:07:04] Moses acts even stood there and said one
[1:07:08] thing that yet God told him to speak
[1:07:12] speak
[1:07:13] and then God tells him an action to
[1:07:17] couple with his speaking now you know we
[1:07:20] can quote the word to word blue in the
[1:07:21] face but there are certain actions of
[1:07:24] faith that we've got to take and if we
[1:07:27] don't take them your Mountain Will Never
[1:07:30] Move
[1:07:31] in other words there's things that you
[1:07:34] and I must put forth and we have to
[1:07:36] operate sometimes on the spur of the
[1:07:39] moment of that pulsation of faith when
[1:07:42] God drops it now this is what's happened
[1:07:45] of course to this setting when they are
[1:07:47] at the Red Sea and you know the end of
[1:07:49] the story there that the spirit of God
[1:07:51] moved upon the Water where the speaking
[1:07:54] was at we don't know what did he say we
[1:07:58] don't know but all we know is God said
[1:08:00] quit crying unto me okay I'm sick of it
[1:08:04] I want you to quit acting like a cry
[1:08:06] baby Moses I commission you to deliver
[1:08:09] this people talk to him and tell them
[1:08:11] let's go forward
[1:08:13] and then Moses instead of standing up
[1:08:16] and preaching Moses puts his words into
[1:08:19] action and then God tells him to lift up
[1:08:22] his rod and Moses obeys what God Said
[1:08:26] and he believes it's the truth
[1:08:28] Joshua chapter 10 verse 12. we have
[1:08:32] another man total different of course
[1:08:34] calling than Moses he wasn't even deemed
[1:08:37] by many to be in the office of Moses yep
[1:08:41] we see that God called him to stand in
[1:08:43] Moses place and take the children of God
[1:08:46] all into the land of promise now this
[1:08:48] man's got a different Administration
[1:08:49] altogether God's going to use him in a
[1:08:52] way that he's never used another human
[1:08:54] being since that time
[1:08:57] then Joshua spake to the Lord in that
[1:08:59] day when the Lord delivered up the
[1:09:01] amorites before the children of Israel
[1:09:03] and he
[1:09:05] said
[1:09:06] in the sight of Israel
[1:09:09] I want you to notice how peculiar that
[1:09:11] the words of God are sometimes then
[1:09:14] spake Joshua to the Lord
[1:09:18] in the day when the Lord delivered the
[1:09:20] amorites before the children of Israel
[1:09:22] and he said
[1:09:24] in the sight of Israel but he's speaking
[1:09:27] to God
[1:09:29] Joshua said unto the Lord
[1:09:32] capital L capital O capital r capital D
[1:09:36] then spake Joshua to the Lord
[1:09:39] in the day when the Lord delivered the
[1:09:42] amorites before the children of Israel
[1:09:44] and he said
[1:09:47] in the sight of Israel son
[1:09:51] but he said this to the Lord
[1:09:54] is this what your Bible says I'm sorry
[1:09:56] you had never read this before
[1:09:58] and then speak Joshua to the Lord
[1:10:02] and this is what he says son
[1:10:06] stand still thou upon gibeon
[1:10:09] and thou moon in the valley of agilon
[1:10:14] and the sun Stood Still and the moon
[1:10:16] stayed until the people at events
[1:10:19] themselves upon their enemies is this
[1:10:22] not written in the book of jasher
[1:10:25] so the sun Stood Still in the midst of
[1:10:28] heaven and hasted not to go down about a
[1:10:31] whole day
[1:10:32] and there was no day like it before or
[1:10:35] after it listen now
[1:10:38] that the Lord
[1:10:41] not the son
[1:10:43] not the Moon
[1:10:44] that the Lord
[1:10:47] hearkened
[1:10:49] unto the voice
[1:10:51] of a man
[1:10:54] so Joshua speaks to the Lord and he says
[1:10:57] son
[1:10:59] still and moon don't you move
[1:11:03] and it obeyed his voice
[1:11:06] and then the Bible said there'd never
[1:11:07] been a day like it before another day
[1:11:09] after it since that the Lord not the son
[1:11:13] not the Moon
[1:11:15] the Lord
[1:11:16] hearkened to The Voice
[1:11:19] of a man
[1:11:21] not in Joshua ever do this again never
[1:11:25] as anyone down through time ever done
[1:11:27] this again not that we know
[1:11:31] but isn't it peculiar that it would say
[1:11:34] he spoke to the Lord but he's addressing
[1:11:36] the son
[1:11:38] now maybe that's what you need to do
[1:11:40] with the situation you're in today
[1:11:44] that you need to speak to the Lord but
[1:11:47] address your disease
[1:11:50] and address your sickness or your
[1:11:53] oppression or the enemy that is taking
[1:11:56] your victory
[1:11:59] and reminding your father that you are a
[1:12:03] son and daughter and you're sick and
[1:12:05] tired of the devil beating you to death
[1:12:08] amen and stealing from you what is your
[1:12:13] right
[1:12:14] and somebody said
[1:12:15] [Applause]
[1:12:16] notice again in Matthew chapter 8 verse
[1:12:19] 5 and when Jesus was entered into
[1:12:21] Capernaum there came unto him a
[1:12:24] centurion beseeching him and saying Lord
[1:12:26] my servant lies at home to sick with a
[1:12:29] palsy grievously tormented Jesus says
[1:12:33] unto him I will come and heal him the
[1:12:36] Centurion answered and said Lord I am
[1:12:39] not worthy that thou shouldest come
[1:12:41] under my roof but speak the word only
[1:12:47] and my servant shall be healed
[1:12:50] speak the word only and my servant shall
[1:12:53] be healed
[1:12:55] for I am a man under Authority now
[1:12:58] there's something this Gentile Centurion
[1:13:00] sees that the Jews at this time did not
[1:13:04] see the Jews were taught laying on of
[1:13:07] hands and yes we believe in laying on of
[1:13:10] hands in case any of you get nervous we
[1:13:12] believe in laying on of hands
[1:13:14] but the Gentile way of receiving was
[1:13:19] recognizing power and authority
[1:13:24] now watch this speak the word only and
[1:13:27] my servant shall be healed for I am a
[1:13:29] man under Authority having soldiers
[1:13:33] under me so now watch this man he wants
[1:13:36] Jesus to know I understand who you are I
[1:13:40] know that you have power over all
[1:13:43] sickness and disease and I recognize
[1:13:47] that because I can see myself now being
[1:13:49] a centurion he is over a hundred men but
[1:13:54] he also has men that are over him so
[1:13:58] they could tell him you go there you go
[1:14:01] this you go do this and he would say yes
[1:14:03] sir I will but he also could speak to
[1:14:06] those hundred men which were under him
[1:14:09] and he could tell them we are going to
[1:14:11] such and such and we're leaving at 12
[1:14:13] o'clock and we'll be there so many days
[1:14:16] and we're going to do this so he
[1:14:18] recognized Jesus position in this
[1:14:21] amazing I wonder if Peter and some of
[1:14:23] the Apostles even wreck the way this man
[1:14:25] did I say to this man go when he goes
[1:14:29] and to another come and he cometh and to
[1:14:32] my servant do this and he does it when
[1:14:35] Jesus heard it
[1:14:37] he marveled
[1:14:40] wow can you imagine a gentile a Roman
[1:14:45] calls the Lord Jesus
[1:14:47] to Marvel
[1:14:50] wouldn't that be awesome for somebody in
[1:14:52] this building today
[1:14:54] to be able to cause the Lord Jesus to
[1:14:58] Marvel
[1:14:59] and say that's my son that's my daughter
[1:15:02] listen Angels listen at them how they're
[1:15:06] taking my word and they're standing in
[1:15:08] their position and they realize Satan is
[1:15:11] not all powerful Satan cannot manipulate
[1:15:15] them and do this with them and that with
[1:15:18] them they realize I am the one who
[1:15:21] brought them on the earth they realize I
[1:15:24] am the one that controls their life not
[1:15:26] Satan
[1:15:29] now notice this then the Bible said when
[1:15:32] Jesus heard it he marveled and he said
[1:15:35] to them that followed verily I say unto
[1:15:38] you
[1:15:39] I have not found so great face
[1:15:45] no
[1:15:47] not in Israel
[1:15:49] Lord Jesus you name the whole nation
[1:15:55] so this Roman which was not even saved
[1:15:58] as we would say
[1:16:00] so Marvel the Lord Jesus and Jesus sort
[1:16:03] of come back now Pharisees Sadducees the
[1:16:06] scenes herodians all them sent in our
[1:16:08] glory to God I'll tell you one thing my
[1:16:11] daddy was so and so my grandpa was so
[1:16:13] and so and Jesus said I found such faith
[1:16:16] in all of Israel like this the Lord
[1:16:19] Jesus identifies this Faith as great
[1:16:24] faith
[1:16:28] I hope and pray to God
[1:16:31] that some of us
[1:16:33] will be able to be identified by the
[1:16:35] Lord Jesus
[1:16:36] of having great
[1:16:39] faith
[1:16:42] how many wants it
[1:16:44] verily I say unto you I have not found
[1:16:47] so great faith no not in Israel
[1:16:52] now this actually
[1:16:54] astonishes the Lord Jesus now I'm going
[1:16:57] to talk about you know some hit like me
[1:16:58] or some hillbilly like you all we're
[1:17:01] talking about the Lord God in flesh
[1:17:05] but this statement so astounded the Lord
[1:17:09] Jesus that it actually astonished him
[1:17:12] and he marveled was it marveling of the
[1:17:16] source where did this man get this how
[1:17:18] did he know how did he understand this
[1:17:20] how could this man being a gentile
[1:17:23] surpass the faith of those that knew the
[1:17:27] law they knew the Torah they knew the
[1:17:29] mishnah they knew all the things that
[1:17:31] the prophet said and they could quote it
[1:17:33] upside down sideways backwards forwards
[1:17:36] and every other way and here was a
[1:17:38] gentile that probably couldn't quote one
[1:17:39] much less Ten Commandments and he his
[1:17:44] understanding astonished
[1:17:47] the Lord Jesus amen
[1:17:51] he understood that there was such
[1:17:54] Authority by speaking the word
[1:17:57] so he knew that the bodily presence of
[1:18:00] the Lord Jesus did not need to go to his
[1:18:03] home and lay hands on the Centurion now
[1:18:06] Jesus offers I'll go there I'll pray for
[1:18:08] him I'll go there now heal him they said
[1:18:10] no that's fine that's not necessary if
[1:18:12] you would just speak the word
[1:18:15] my servant will be healed
[1:18:18] amen now follow along with me if you
[1:18:19] will this morning what's the prophet he
[1:18:21] said Lord I'm not worthy for you to
[1:18:23] speak under under my roof I was talking
[1:18:26] about this man come under my roof rather
[1:18:28] but just speak the word there you are
[1:18:31] the authority he knew that Jesus had all
[1:18:34] power who told him this
[1:18:39] who told him
[1:18:41] how did he know Jesus had all power
[1:18:45] he had all power over sickness over all
[1:18:48] diseases over death hell he knew that
[1:18:50] all Jesus had to do is speak the word
[1:18:53] that settles it now Jesus was come
[1:18:55] willing to come and lay hands on the boy
[1:18:57] and rebuke the fever so it astonished
[1:19:01] him
[1:19:02] he said why I'm not found so fast so
[1:19:07] much Faith No not in Israel now the
[1:19:10] prophet uses this man as an example for
[1:19:13] many years in his ministry again he says
[1:19:15] that you noticed when he was going to
[1:19:17] pray for jariah's daughter to be raised
[1:19:19] zariah's a Jew he had been trained to
[1:19:22] lay hands on people giraffe said come
[1:19:25] lay your hands on my daughter and she'll
[1:19:27] live he had been taught that laying on
[1:19:30] of hands but to the Gentile he had been
[1:19:33] taught
[1:19:34] power
[1:19:36] and Authority
[1:19:41] now please understand me I'm not against
[1:19:44] lying on his hands and I will right here
[1:19:46] today if somebody needs it
[1:19:50] but a lot of it is where your faith is
[1:19:55] laying on of hands wrong absolutely not
[1:19:58] it's speaking the word wrong no
[1:20:00] well you'll find out here in a minute
[1:20:02] it's where your face is
[1:20:05] some people just have faith if a servant
[1:20:08] of God will touch them that something
[1:20:10] will happen
[1:20:12] and most unlikely it will
[1:20:14] but others
[1:20:16] could set or be at home or wherever and
[1:20:20] maybe they're 500 miles or a thousand
[1:20:22] miles or ten thousand miles away from
[1:20:25] where a servant of God is but if they
[1:20:27] can get you on the phone if they can
[1:20:29] send you an email or a text or whatever
[1:20:31] they believe if you pray God will do it
[1:20:36] why they recognize power and authority
[1:20:41] what's this it's according to what you
[1:20:43] believe both her faith was in Christ now
[1:20:46] watch your brother Branham captures
[1:20:48] Jarius he was a Jew so he believed in
[1:20:50] laying on a fence now he captures the
[1:20:52] Roman Centurion and he says both of them
[1:20:55] believed on the same person the Lord
[1:20:58] Jesus and both of them got what they
[1:21:01] needed but both of them got it in a
[1:21:03] different Channel what determined the
[1:21:05] channel their face in the way they
[1:21:08] believed it so jariah said come and lay
[1:21:11] your hands on my daughter and she'll be
[1:21:13] well and I realize there's an element of
[1:21:15] folks in the message that say well we
[1:21:17] should be Beyond laying off hands we
[1:21:19] don't need lay hands on the sick well I
[1:21:21] can understand that to a degree but if
[1:21:23] that's where people's faith is I'm going
[1:21:25] to pray for him and I'll do it to the
[1:21:27] long the last day of my life if that's
[1:21:29] what they need but I also know there are
[1:21:32] other people that know if they can hear
[1:21:34] that word and the inspiration falls on
[1:21:37] them they don't even need hands laid on
[1:21:39] them is that right brother Brad
[1:21:41] the Lord did for our brothers just a few
[1:21:43] weeks ago and he called me one day this
[1:21:45] week and he'd been shooting some nails
[1:21:47] and he had the reading a little small
[1:21:49] mailbox and he was able to read the tiny
[1:21:52] letters on the side of the mailbox
[1:21:54] because the Lord touched him sitting
[1:21:56] right here and corrected his eyes
[1:21:59] and then I repeated that one brother
[1:22:01] Joel was here of course and a sister
[1:22:03] from their church God healed their eyes
[1:22:05] I talked to her brother yesterday on the
[1:22:08] phone he'd been dealing with all kinds
[1:22:10] of things in his body swelling in his
[1:22:11] feet swelling in his legs couldn't even
[1:22:14] walk a matter of fact the last time I
[1:22:15] saw him I had to help him walk into a
[1:22:18] building the same time that I said that
[1:22:20] to Brother Brad the word that I
[1:22:22] mentioned diabetes the spirit of God
[1:22:24] struck our brother at home streaming the
[1:22:27] service the swelling is gone the
[1:22:29] inflammation is gone he went back to his
[1:22:32] Doctrine the doctor told him come back
[1:22:34] in a year
[1:22:36] I didn't lay hands on him I didn't lay
[1:22:38] hands under the bed I didn't lay hands
[1:22:41] on the sister from Brother Jules church
[1:22:43] but it was the spirit of God that struck
[1:22:45] them and they received it I don't know
[1:22:48] how you feel about it I wanted however
[1:22:50] God wants to send it to me amen I I
[1:22:54] personally believe if a man of God prays
[1:22:56] for me I don't necessarily need his
[1:22:58] hands on me but if he feels need to
[1:23:01] touch me go ahead and touch me rub me if
[1:23:03] you want to do whatever you need to do I
[1:23:05] need help I don't care how I've got to
[1:23:07] do it but I realize there's an element
[1:23:09] of people in the message always should
[1:23:11] be beyond that we don't need prayer for
[1:23:13] the sick no more I'll tell you one thing
[1:23:15] I think we need more prayer for the sick
[1:23:17] we've ever had it we've got more sick
[1:23:19] folks and we ain't the only church
[1:23:21] that's got sick folks everybody I've
[1:23:22] talked to has got sick folks and if
[1:23:24] they're sick folk everywhere Our God
[1:23:26] Specializes in healing the sin
[1:23:28] [Applause]
[1:23:30] now I want you to notice this he said
[1:23:32] it's according to what you believe both
[1:23:34] of their faith was in Christ one said
[1:23:36] speak the word and it'll be done the
[1:23:38] other one said lay your hands and it'll
[1:23:40] be done see it's according to what you
[1:23:43] believe well now that is the way it is
[1:23:46] here tonight many people has got the
[1:23:48] idea when people pray for the sick that
[1:23:51] there's something in the person that's
[1:23:54] praying for the sick that heals the sick
[1:23:57] now if you believe that today listen
[1:23:59] what you're believing that is an error
[1:24:03] so if you believe one certain man has
[1:24:07] something inside of him that's Healing
[1:24:09] The Sick you're believing wrong
[1:24:12] well Hallelujah y'all going to preach
[1:24:15] with me today that is an error it's in
[1:24:19] Christ that heals the sin his death at
[1:24:23] Calvary he paid the price for all the
[1:24:25] sins and all the sickness of the world
[1:24:27] and whosoever believeth upon that
[1:24:28] atonement that he made can never or can
[1:24:31] have whatsoever they ask the trouble
[1:24:34] lays in the people it's a lack of faith
[1:24:38] now watch again how it goes into this
[1:24:41] about gravitating toward a man I've
[1:24:44] heard so many of them say brother
[1:24:45] Branham if you'll touch me I'd get well
[1:24:48] well you know what that is that's Faith
[1:24:51] that's what it is it's it's what you
[1:24:53] believe you see the woman who come to
[1:24:55] the Tabernacle and she was sick and had
[1:24:57] a great need from God and she thought
[1:24:59] brother Brandon would be there she
[1:25:01] wasn't there brother Brown was out going
[1:25:02] somewhere else she said just show me
[1:25:05] where the man walked and let me walk in
[1:25:09] the footsteps that he walked and I'll be
[1:25:11] healed wow now if she would have had to
[1:25:15] had his hands laid on her then she would
[1:25:18] have totally left there defeated but her
[1:25:21] faith was not just in his hands her
[1:25:24] faith was he was a servant of God now
[1:25:26] can you imagine in the days of Peter
[1:25:28] that people may be sick crippled blind
[1:25:31] halt lame whatever they were and Peter
[1:25:33] would just walk on his way to the
[1:25:35] grocery store down to fish or do
[1:25:37] whatever and his shadow would go right
[1:25:40] across him and they would jump uphill by
[1:25:42] the power of God why their faith did not
[1:25:46] need for him to stop along and touch him
[1:25:49] and yet he did do that but how would God
[1:25:52] Minister according to people's face
[1:25:56] so you see if people believe that the
[1:25:59] only way they will get healed is for the
[1:26:01] pastor to lay hands on them then you
[1:26:03] know what I'm going to honor their face
[1:26:05] I'm going to do it but if they believe
[1:26:07] that they're in need and sickness and
[1:26:10] they believe what that same Faith they
[1:26:12] can call me on the phone or they can
[1:26:14] walk right up here and say you don't
[1:26:16] need to lay your hands on me speak the
[1:26:18] word and I'll be delivered if they
[1:26:21] believe that it will happen and the
[1:26:25] church said
[1:26:25] [Applause]
[1:26:27] oh my the Jews believed in laying on of
[1:26:31] hands the Gentile believed
[1:26:35] in say the word Lord
[1:26:38] my son will be healed is that right the
[1:26:40] Jews drives come lay your hand on my
[1:26:43] daughter and she'll live but the Romans
[1:26:44] said just speak the word and my servant
[1:26:47] will live that's right now listen what
[1:26:49] he says
[1:26:50] that's a higher
[1:26:59] that's
[1:27:01] a higher
[1:27:07] higher we people here in America has
[1:27:09] been taught you got to lay hands on them
[1:27:11] lay your hands well that's a Jewish idea
[1:27:15] that's not a gentile Doctrine by the
[1:27:18] Bible
[1:27:22] well praise the Lord some of y'all are
[1:27:24] tore all two pieces ain't you
[1:27:27] well no need to be the prophet was a
[1:27:29] great balancer
[1:27:31] you see where the schools of thought
[1:27:33] come from and those that don't believe
[1:27:34] in prayer lines and laying hands on the
[1:27:36] sick sure they can capitalize on these
[1:27:38] quotes but read the rest of them read
[1:27:41] the rest of them oh it just it just
[1:27:43] turns my stomach I can't hardly stand to
[1:27:45] hear a preacher that ain't balanced it
[1:27:47] just makes me sick it just makes me sick
[1:27:49] to my stomach I actually get physically
[1:27:51] nauseated when a preacher will just
[1:27:53] isolate certain quotes you know and just
[1:27:55] cabbage down on that and make it a
[1:27:56] Doctrine and I'm sitting there knowing
[1:27:58] he's leaving now 57 more that say
[1:28:01] something else also come on let's preach
[1:28:03] the whole thing amen church if we're
[1:28:06] going to believe it let's believe it all
[1:28:07] if we're going to accept the word of God
[1:28:09] let's accept all of it and that's let's
[1:28:12] not look down on people maybe people
[1:28:14] need their hands laid on them let's not
[1:28:16] look down on them and belittle them and
[1:28:18] make them less of a Christian May let's
[1:28:20] just ask God God's you minister to your
[1:28:23] people as they have need of according to
[1:28:25] where their faith is but I personally
[1:28:28] believe we're coming to A Time
[1:28:32] when the higher plane
[1:28:34] will be reached
[1:28:38] notice he said that's not a gentile
[1:28:40] Doctrine by the Bible of remembrance
[1:28:42] where I said come lay your hands on my
[1:28:43] daughter and she'll live at the Roman
[1:28:45] Centurion said I'm not worthy that you
[1:28:47] come under my house just speak the word
[1:28:49] Jesus said that's
[1:28:52] the greatest
[1:29:01] I never saw that in Israel
[1:29:05] now listen how sad
[1:29:07] but we just don't seem
[1:29:10] to be able to comprehend it
[1:29:14] in America
[1:29:19] well I personally want to be an
[1:29:22] exception
[1:29:23] to that quote
[1:29:28] praise the Lord now this is sad this is
[1:29:31] 1957.
[1:29:32] surely the goodness
[1:29:35] haven't we Advanced any
[1:29:38] since 1957.
[1:29:41] so we would still fit in a category that
[1:29:44] the prophet said we in America
[1:29:47] cannot seem to comprehend it
[1:29:50] God help us
[1:29:52] I want to comprehend it
[1:29:55] but what is it you see it shows how the
[1:29:58] tradition now to me what's wrong when
[1:30:00] you look at people having to have hands
[1:30:03] laid on them it becomes it it it must be
[1:30:06] it just has to be if brother Tim don't
[1:30:08] touch me brother Ron don't touch me
[1:30:10] brother Donnie brother Daryl don't oh
[1:30:11] brother Daryl so gifted he is but don't
[1:30:14] you understand it's not just how
[1:30:15] giftable the Daryl is it's the faith you
[1:30:18] have in God's promise
[1:30:21] again he said that Jesus always laying
[1:30:23] hands on everything as laying on his
[1:30:25] hands but what's the Gentile it wasn't
[1:30:28] so I'm not worried that you come under
[1:30:29] my roof just speak the word
[1:30:32] and my servant will live he turned
[1:30:34] around and said I never seen Faith like
[1:30:36] that in Israel there it is
[1:30:39] we're supposed to be on a
[1:30:44] go ahead and say it come on
[1:30:46] higher level than that was
[1:30:50] we're living on a closer to the World's
[1:30:53] End than we were then the Gentile way is
[1:30:57] believe the word
[1:31:00] Hallelujah
[1:31:03] I don't know I'm telling you there's
[1:31:05] been times in my life
[1:31:07] when I prefer to God the skin on it
[1:31:13] how many knows what I'm talking about oh
[1:31:14] sure yeah pray for me on the phone but
[1:31:16] if you feel Ed come by and just kind of
[1:31:18] hold my hand in the room you know just
[1:31:20] go ahead and lay your hands on me now
[1:31:22] come on I'm just being honest you might
[1:31:24] as well be honest too
[1:31:26] but yet is that where God wants us to
[1:31:28] stay what even to a spot you're a
[1:31:31] thousand some miles away from somebody
[1:31:32] that can lay hands on you I want the
[1:31:35] kind of faith that I can call him down
[1:31:37] right there if nobody is there to touch
[1:31:40] me I want to be able to call him down
[1:31:43] myself
[1:31:44] you see that's what the Roman Centurion
[1:31:47] did it's absolutely this is one of the
[1:31:49] most phenomenal things to me in the
[1:31:51] entire example of the New Testament
[1:31:53] Canon of scripture how did this man not
[1:31:55] even have the Holy Ghost this man not
[1:31:58] even confessing Jesus as his savior was
[1:32:01] not baptized by the Lord Jesus this man
[1:32:03] did not even embraced the reality of who
[1:32:06] he was as far as Redeemer and savior but
[1:32:09] yet he understood power and authority
[1:32:13] power and authority and he believed that
[1:32:17] what Jesus said would come to pass
[1:32:21] oh my notice he said what did Jesus say
[1:32:25] he turned around and said I never found
[1:32:27] Faith like this in Israel well that's
[1:32:29] the kind of things that we want here in
[1:32:33] California well let me not just limit it
[1:32:36] to the big state of California
[1:32:39] I say I want it here how many says with
[1:32:44] me we want it in Tennessee we want it in
[1:32:47] our church
[1:32:49] we want it in our families we want it in
[1:32:52] our homes
[1:32:54] Hallelujah I don't want this just to be
[1:32:57] an example in the Bible that was written
[1:32:59] 2 000 years ago I believe that Jesus
[1:33:02] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:33:05] forever
[1:33:08] well that's the kind of faith we want
[1:33:09] here in California that kind of Faith
[1:33:12] speak the word
[1:33:14] I don't think I'll ever forget it as
[1:33:16] long as I live and I'm in my right mind
[1:33:19] brother George Smith come up several
[1:33:21] several years ago and was still at the
[1:33:22] old place brother George has gone
[1:33:24] through some different things in his
[1:33:25] life and really just needed prayer
[1:33:27] needed Direction and all that from the
[1:33:29] Lord he come up and stood about in this
[1:33:32] position right here in the old church on
[1:33:34] that right hand side of the altar he
[1:33:36] come up to me and said something like
[1:33:38] this brother Donnie I believe you were
[1:33:39] God's gift to this area and I believe
[1:33:43] what you asked God God will do
[1:33:48] wow
[1:33:51] wouldn't it be something if we would be
[1:33:53] able to speak God's word in such a way
[1:33:56] that you don't have to have a gallon of
[1:33:58] oil or you don't even have to feel
[1:34:00] anything well it didn't feel no
[1:34:03] different that don't make any difference
[1:34:04] at all if a servant of God is Anointed
[1:34:07] to speak the word of God you walk away
[1:34:10] with absolutely no feeling whatsoever
[1:34:12] but if you believe it it will happen in
[1:34:15] your life and let me just tell you in
[1:34:18] case you're wondering so brother Donnie
[1:34:20] so so how is this going to work then the
[1:34:22] church that the prophet saw was coming
[1:34:25] and just in case you're wondering I have
[1:34:27] quotes before me that I'll get to
[1:34:29] momentarily this is not a my imagination
[1:34:32] this is something that brother Branham
[1:34:34] said was in the making and was coming a
[1:34:39] church that they would speak the word
[1:34:42] and it would flash like lightning
[1:34:46] so will it be just two or three special
[1:34:49] preachers and everybody in the message
[1:34:51] will go to them or everybody in the
[1:34:54] message will have to leave their church
[1:34:55] and and move to them to Three Special
[1:34:58] men you don't even believe the apostolic
[1:35:00] form of the Gospel if you believe that
[1:35:02] God is Not pointing to two or three
[1:35:05] special men God is Not pointing to one
[1:35:08] special man here in another special man
[1:35:10] God is pointing to his special people
[1:35:13] this ain't going to just be one preacher
[1:35:16] on another preacher and everybody's
[1:35:18] going to have to relocate brother that's
[1:35:20] not what they've done in the New
[1:35:22] Testament but Paul went up and down the
[1:35:24] islands of Crete over a hundred cities
[1:35:27] there and Paul spoke to Titus and said
[1:35:30] that had a great Revival imprete over a
[1:35:33] hundred cities and that visited every
[1:35:35] one of those cities and Villages and
[1:35:37] Paul run out of time and Paul left Titus
[1:35:40] there and he said I left you here to be
[1:35:43] able to ordain elders and ever cities so
[1:35:46] you see that's the way the Apostolic
[1:35:48] Church grew in the New Testament a
[1:35:51] church was not started to give a
[1:35:53] preacher a place to preach a church was
[1:35:56] started because a Revival come and
[1:35:59] people got saved and people got stirred
[1:36:01] it was the church that gave birth to the
[1:36:04] preacher not the preacher that gave
[1:36:06] birth to the church
[1:36:08] well come on somebody read your Bible
[1:36:11] read your Bible it was not that a man
[1:36:14] went out and done this and that and the
[1:36:16] other but it was the spirit of God
[1:36:18] sending a Revival and whenever the
[1:36:20] Revival come it demanded a preacher you
[1:36:23] see a church that's founded around a
[1:36:25] preacher they've got to have him the
[1:36:27] function they've got to have him to do
[1:36:29] this and that and the other but when the
[1:36:31] preacher has called on the scene because
[1:36:34] of the people it helps him to realize
[1:36:36] they don't need me near as much as I
[1:36:40] need them well come on somebody but if
[1:36:43] we're not careful we're getting out of
[1:36:44] our mind oh this great big God this
[1:36:46] great big guy everybody that's the move
[1:36:48] of God that's the only move of God in
[1:36:50] the last days that is the spirit of
[1:36:52] organization that is still around this
[1:36:55] message and I'm going to condemn it to
[1:36:58] my last breath God don't call a man in
[1:37:01] Tennessee or a man in Louisiana or a man
[1:37:04] in Virginia or West Virginia or in
[1:37:06] Germany and everybody around the world
[1:37:09] is supposed to move there God wants you
[1:37:11] to stay where he put you God wants you
[1:37:14] to stay and give your lives out to be
[1:37:17] able to progress Jesus Christ and let
[1:37:20] people see in your little place that
[1:37:22] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:37:25] forever
[1:37:29] foreign
[1:37:34] well here I go getting in trouble again
[1:37:38] notice this in Christ identified the
[1:37:40] same now what we try to do is try to get
[1:37:43] the people to believe the Lord Jesus and
[1:37:45] just accept him
[1:37:47] without being hands laid on
[1:37:50] now we know there's a scripture that
[1:37:52] says that lay hands on the sick and they
[1:37:53] shall recover and we don't try to
[1:37:55] belittle that scripture you see men who
[1:37:58] tried to belittle that
[1:38:00] are not operating in the channel of the
[1:38:02] anointing of Malachi 4.
[1:38:04] because the messenger Malachi 4 did not
[1:38:07] belittle one scripture to exalt another
[1:38:10] one
[1:38:12] you see it stumbled me years and years
[1:38:14] ago because I got saved in the
[1:38:15] trinitarian church and I was baptized in
[1:38:17] titles but there was people that would
[1:38:19] try to enlighten me on Acts 2 38 but one
[1:38:22] of the reasons I could never accept it
[1:38:24] was was their approach to it because
[1:38:27] it's like they took Acts 2 38 and tried
[1:38:30] to make it fight Matthew 28-19 but when
[1:38:34] a man talked to me one day and he didn't
[1:38:36] preach to me water baptism out of Acts 2
[1:38:39] 38 in the name of the Lord Jesus he
[1:38:42] actually talked to me about it out of
[1:38:44] Matthew 28 19 I thought now that man I
[1:38:46] can listen to because that man didn't
[1:38:49] take this scripture to fight this
[1:38:50] scripture I'll tell you I have a hard
[1:38:52] time with preachers that get up and take
[1:38:54] this quote to fight that quote and this
[1:38:56] quote to fight cut what kind of message
[1:38:58] have we got if that's what the message
[1:39:00] is come on somebody what kind of Bible
[1:39:03] have we got if this scripture finds that
[1:39:05] scripture and this and fights that
[1:39:07] there's got to be an understanding and
[1:39:09] that's where the problem lays it's not
[1:39:12] not the Bible fights the Bible it's not
[1:39:14] the message fights the message no the
[1:39:16] message fights the Bible it's
[1:39:18] knuckle-headed preacher someone made him
[1:39:20] call in the first place and they ain't
[1:39:22] got the Holy Ghost you watch how a man
[1:39:24] interprets the word and that'll tell you
[1:39:26] what he's called to preach or not God
[1:39:28] don't call no preacher that cannot
[1:39:31] preach itself out of a paper box come on
[1:39:33] somebody when God calls a man he's got
[1:39:36] the ability to rightly divide the word
[1:39:39] of Truth All a lot of preachers divide
[1:39:42] it but they don't rightly divide it but
[1:39:44] when a man is called of God he can take
[1:39:47] Matthew 28 19 compared to Acts 2 38 and
[1:39:51] say they say the same thing he can say
[1:39:53] yes sir the Bible says lay hands on the
[1:39:56] sick and the Bible also says speak the
[1:39:58] word that's a man that's called of God
[1:40:00] these are the kind of men that God wants
[1:40:04] in the last day that are not Kingdom
[1:40:07] Builders they're not looking to build a
[1:40:09] reputation all a following the they are
[1:40:13] interested in getting Jesus Christ to
[1:40:16] the people and the people can be so
[1:40:19] filled with the Holy Ghost if they have
[1:40:22] an accident out and they're by
[1:40:24] themselves they can believe the spirit
[1:40:27] of God can use their lips
[1:40:30] to speak his word
[1:40:34] [Applause]
[1:40:40] we don't try to belittle that scripture
[1:40:42] because that was the commission Jesus
[1:40:44] Christ gave to the church
[1:40:46] to lay hands on the sick
[1:40:48] but if you'll bear with me
[1:40:51] that was more like a Jewish tradition
[1:40:55] remember the girl and sick she died your
[1:40:57] eyes down to come lay your hands upon my
[1:40:59] child she'll get well but the Roman
[1:41:01] Center and the Gentile said I'm not
[1:41:03] worthy you come unto my roof just speak
[1:41:05] the word and my servant will live Jesus
[1:41:08] turned around and said I never sing
[1:41:09] Faith like that in Israel
[1:41:11] see the Gentile way
[1:41:19] I mean Gentiles have gone in your day
[1:41:22] home again it's unrealist the restaurant
[1:41:24] was Jews my Lord
[1:41:31] see the Gentile way is to believe him
[1:41:36] just absolutely
[1:41:39] believe him
[1:41:41] now we lay hands on the sick of course
[1:41:43] we do
[1:41:45] but we try to bring the reality by the
[1:41:48] scriptures
[1:41:49] of Jesus Christ
[1:41:51] being present
[1:41:57] because if I can ever get that over to
[1:41:59] you
[1:42:01] that he
[1:42:03] is here
[1:42:06] we have a musician's chat here at the
[1:42:09] church watch out
[1:42:11] we share songs quotes
[1:42:13] you know just testimonies things like
[1:42:15] that
[1:42:17] and we'll share different things that
[1:42:18] the Lord is doing in our church and not
[1:42:20] only our church but other churches of
[1:42:22] course
[1:42:23] and I always notice Harry
[1:42:27] and Harry will say this every now and
[1:42:29] then
[1:42:31] I hope
[1:42:32] we realize
[1:42:34] who's Among Us
[1:42:37] I hope we recognize
[1:42:40] his presence Among Us
[1:42:43] and it don't become common to us
[1:42:47] do you realize how blessed you are
[1:42:49] friends
[1:42:49] you understand there's people in the
[1:42:51] Tri-Cities that have never seen a
[1:42:52] miracle
[1:42:53] they've never even seen a Divine Healing
[1:42:56] they have never seen anyone raised from
[1:42:59] the dead and it's happened in your
[1:43:01] church
[1:43:03] don't let it become common Lord just the
[1:43:06] way it is no this is not the normal this
[1:43:09] is not the normal for the world out here
[1:43:11] they don't experience such things
[1:43:14] and this is only the beginning
[1:43:17] if we can keep ourselves small on our
[1:43:19] sight and see what the Lord God will do
[1:43:22] Among Us he don't want to prove us he
[1:43:25] wants to prove himself Among Us there's
[1:43:28] only one great one in the message and it
[1:43:32] just so happens to be it's the only
[1:43:34] great one that's ever been that's the
[1:43:37] Lord God from heaven
[1:43:38] somebody say Amen
[1:43:41] Hallelujah
[1:43:45] but we try to bring the reality by the
[1:43:47] scriptures of Jesus Christ being present
[1:43:49] then when you by faith reach up and
[1:43:52] touch him
[1:43:55] what
[1:44:04] see like the woman with the blood issue
[1:44:06] touched His Garment
[1:44:08] well you say if he was here I would
[1:44:10] touch him the Bible says Hebrews 3 that
[1:44:13] he's now a high priest that can be
[1:44:14] touched by the feeling of our
[1:44:16] infirmities
[1:44:17] he can be touched just as well tonight
[1:44:22] as he was then now we will say Amen to
[1:44:24] that quote but in reality do we really
[1:44:27] believe that do we really believe right
[1:44:29] here today that the Lord Jesus is just
[1:44:33] as accessible
[1:44:35] as it was that day when that woman
[1:44:36] reached out
[1:44:38] and touched the Hem of His Garment
[1:44:41] without a scripture without a quote
[1:44:43] without a promise that he would even do
[1:44:46] it but somehow it was revealed to her
[1:44:50] Oh Glory to God
[1:44:52] she believed that if she would touch him
[1:44:54] that he would change her life notice
[1:44:57] usually somebody said well
[1:45:00] you know brother so and so
[1:45:03] some Minister evangelist laid hands upon
[1:45:07] man all the Lord Heal Me
[1:45:09] that brother so-and-so laid hands on me
[1:45:12] that makes everybody
[1:45:14] want to see that brother
[1:45:17] lay hands on somebody
[1:45:21] oh
[1:45:23] testing one two three testing uh testing
[1:45:26] uh one two three uh testing one two
[1:45:29] three one two three one two three
[1:45:38] we haven't changed much have we
[1:45:41] now this quote is 1964. here we are in
[1:45:43] 2023
[1:45:45] and people are still doing the exact
[1:45:47] same thing
[1:45:51] somebody actually
[1:45:54] at your brother's hands that
[1:45:57] that it's your faith
[1:46:00] but your face was if that brother prays
[1:46:04] for me I'll be well
[1:46:06] if that brother does it if that brother
[1:46:08] lays his hands on me and if your face
[1:46:11] would have been Lord Jesus I need you
[1:46:14] come by here Lord come by here Lord I
[1:46:20] need you won't you come by here but I
[1:46:24] would you do it for me
[1:46:27] yeah do you want me to do all the
[1:46:29] praying don't you
[1:46:30] you want me to Live 24 7. so close to
[1:46:35] God that at any time you need me you can
[1:46:38] call me and you have confidence that I
[1:46:40] do that
[1:46:41] you know why because some of us got more
[1:46:43] confidence in me than you got yourself
[1:46:45] and if you're living a life like that
[1:46:47] you ought to be ashamed of yourself
[1:46:48] we're right at the end time friends
[1:46:51] oh you may not be a preacher you don't
[1:46:53] have to be a preacher to believe God
[1:46:55] that woman that touched his grandma was
[1:46:58] not even saved she did not have the Holy
[1:47:02] Ghost
[1:47:03] [Applause]
[1:47:04] [Music]
[1:47:07] oh my
[1:47:09] now watch what happens then when a
[1:47:12] certain certain preacher and evangelist
[1:47:13] or whatever lays hands on everybody so
[1:47:15] then when the Evangelist leaves town
[1:47:18] the pastor
[1:47:20] is just a little bitty fellow
[1:47:23] and the side of the congregation usually
[1:47:26] some things happen in healings and so
[1:47:28] forth and they think they have to have
[1:47:30] the evangelists back in town
[1:47:33] before anybody can be healed well you
[1:47:37] know what I figure the one we need back
[1:47:39] in town
[1:47:40] is Jesus
[1:47:42] praise the Lord thank God for the
[1:47:44] brothers that come through my God's
[1:47:46] blessed us we've been having some
[1:47:47] wonderful meetings have we not we're
[1:47:48] brothers outside coming in and we're so
[1:47:51] grateful but you know what if none of
[1:47:53] them's within phone call distance this
[1:47:55] morning I believe the king himself is
[1:47:57] here I believe the healer is here after
[1:48:00] all by the Aaron Oliver is not the
[1:48:02] heater by the wrong Spencers not the
[1:48:04] hitter but the Doubt's not the Healer
[1:48:05] there's only one Healer the I said
[1:48:08] there's only one Healer and that's the
[1:48:10] Lord Jesus and according to his word if
[1:48:14] two or three well Gather in my name I'll
[1:48:17] be in their midst
[1:48:24] now listen to The Prophet's advice
[1:48:27] they seem to have to have the
[1:48:29] evangelists back in town before anybody
[1:48:31] can be healed listen
[1:48:34] don't you never
[1:48:38] believe that
[1:48:44] it's your face in God
[1:48:47] that does the healing
[1:48:50] You Must Believe God now if you can
[1:48:52] touch him then nobody
[1:48:54] laid hands on you
[1:48:57] was your
[1:48:59] him
[1:49:00] and your faith your faith brought to
[1:49:03] reality
[1:49:06] just don't even realize that it's our
[1:49:09] faith how can I lay hands on you and God
[1:49:12] stop heart attacks how can I lay hands
[1:49:14] on you and great things happen because
[1:49:15] I'm a great person I'm not
[1:49:18] but you have faith
[1:49:20] that if I do God will do it
[1:49:24] but yeah you look at yourself I ain't
[1:49:26] nobody I ain't got no faith if you
[1:49:27] didn't believe God wouldn't answer my
[1:49:29] prayer
[1:49:30] it's not me it's me and you together
[1:49:33] it's not this famous preacher that
[1:49:36] famous preacher it's us as the body of
[1:49:39] God and we have needs and we call on God
[1:49:42] and God performs Supernatural Among Us
[1:49:46] don't think you don't have faith and
[1:49:48] you're not believing it's you
[1:49:51] you it's just happened
[1:50:01] it was your faith that touched him
[1:50:04] in your faith brought the reality so
[1:50:06] then it wasn't no one touched you
[1:50:09] but your faith touched him
[1:50:13] and so that brings real genuine
[1:50:15] testimony
[1:50:17] to him
[1:50:19] but what do we tend to do well glory to
[1:50:21] God I want to testify today Hallelujah I
[1:50:24] want this certain certain meaning and
[1:50:25] this certain preacher prayed for me
[1:50:27] glory to God I want someone so I had
[1:50:29] something else and I went down and I
[1:50:30] followed him down there and so and so on
[1:50:32] he laid hands on me and he he prayed for
[1:50:34] me and God healed me and if we're not
[1:50:36] careful we're building a following
[1:50:39] and then what do many people do they
[1:50:41] want to sell everything they've got and
[1:50:43] go follow that preacher
[1:50:46] hey I'm going to preach today if you get
[1:50:47] mad at me and throw me out on my head
[1:50:52] I'll move somewhere just because a man
[1:50:54] prayed for you and you got healed you
[1:50:56] need to find the will of God for your
[1:50:58] life what if God ordains you to sit
[1:51:00] there well brother Donnie in our church
[1:51:02] it's cold there maybe God wanted to set
[1:51:04] you on fire and have you to help bring
[1:51:07] Revival to that cold church maybe God
[1:51:10] wanted you to be one of them that was
[1:51:12] shot clap in your hands and worshiping
[1:51:14] God my goodness friend where did the
[1:51:16] prophet ever tell us such stuff where
[1:51:18] did Brother Brown ever stand up and tell
[1:51:21] people to leave their church and move to
[1:51:24] the random Tabernacle we're doing things
[1:51:26] and preaching things that are not the
[1:51:29] message of the hour
[1:51:30] [Applause]
[1:51:34] ouch on me help me Jesus
[1:51:41] you know how I feel about that I don't
[1:51:42] want nobody here at this church unless
[1:51:44] God sends them if God sends them come if
[1:51:47] God don't send you stay where you are
[1:51:49] well glory to God you got a new building
[1:51:51] I hear God's doing this that another
[1:51:53] what's that got to do is you unless the
[1:51:56] Lord God lays it on your heart to be a
[1:51:58] part of our family if God lays it on
[1:52:00] your heart then leaves the right way
[1:52:02] obey it because God will never lead you
[1:52:04] to leave a church in a way that's
[1:52:06] contrary to his word and if you do
[1:52:08] you're on the wrong Foundation to begin
[1:52:11] with but if God says you're here we want
[1:52:13] you here but I'm going to tell you
[1:52:15] before you move you're going to fight
[1:52:17] hell because Satan hates this ministry
[1:52:20] Satan hates this church Satan hates you
[1:52:22] as the people of God why because we
[1:52:25] interrupt hell we deliver the sick we
[1:52:28] cast out Devils Hallelujah to God and
[1:52:31] Satan hates a church that believes God's
[1:52:34] word and that's what we believe
[1:52:39] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:52:43] foreign
[1:53:00] listen this
[1:53:02] I believe
[1:53:06] there's a church
[1:53:08] on its Road tonight
[1:53:11] a power of the Living God
[1:53:15] that men will speak the word here and
[1:53:18] there
[1:53:20] it's amazing how a lot of preachers
[1:53:21] leave out that there
[1:53:24] I want that quote to end
[1:53:29] there's something selfish in a man's
[1:53:31] heart when he feels that way
[1:53:32] why would I not want every church that
[1:53:35] really preaches this message I have
[1:53:36] Revival why would we not want healings
[1:53:39] and miracles and signs and wonder my
[1:53:41] goodness I can rejoice when I hear signs
[1:53:44] of one it don't have to just be at our
[1:53:46] church it don't have just to be among
[1:53:48] our people I thank God for every person
[1:53:50] that gets healed I thank God forever one
[1:53:53] of them come on children they don't have
[1:53:55] to just get saved in our church and
[1:53:57] healed in our church I'm just glad we're
[1:53:59] part of it
[1:54:03] oh
[1:54:05] this is your Prophet you did what you
[1:54:06] wish with it
[1:54:08] I believe there's a church on the road
[1:54:10] tonight a power of the Living God notice
[1:54:12] how he relates this a church tonight in
[1:54:14] the making a power of the Living God and
[1:54:17] Associates that church with the power
[1:54:21] of the Living God
[1:54:23] that man will speak the word here and
[1:54:25] there it will Flash
[1:54:28] like lightning
[1:54:31] and a church is coming out not a
[1:54:33] psychologist not some of this put on
[1:54:35] make-believe but a real true genuine
[1:54:39] anointed Holy Ghost
[1:54:42] called out Church
[1:54:45] and Word of Life Church said
[1:54:47] [Applause]
[1:54:47] [Music]
[1:54:52] this in Chautauqua
[1:54:55] I would sure hope
[1:54:57] that I live to see the day
[1:55:00] when we Americans will have that kind of
[1:55:02] Faith talking about the Roman Centurion
[1:55:05] to speak the word Lord
[1:55:07] and my servant
[1:55:09] will live oh
[1:55:12] it will be
[1:55:18] but this is 1959.
[1:55:21] the prophet never lived to see it
[1:55:25] see it we did the forerunners in this
[1:55:26] message never lived to see it
[1:55:31] but I believe before we leave this world
[1:55:34] we will
[1:55:36] see it
[1:55:39] as a matter of fact it's going on right
[1:55:40] now
[1:55:44] here you him 1960 there will be a power
[1:55:48] put into the church and now is coming in
[1:55:52] that the Holy Spirit
[1:55:55] was so anoint the people
[1:56:02] so anoint the people
[1:56:06] till they'll speak the word
[1:56:09] and it'll create itself
[1:56:13] right there
[1:56:18] I mean Carol was talking about it
[1:56:20] yesterday she didn't know what I was
[1:56:21] going to preach them but I was about to
[1:56:22] blow up I was like a helium balloon oh
[1:56:25] my goodness look at all these things and
[1:56:27] I told her I said you know
[1:56:28] I shared a few quotes with her and I
[1:56:30] said I I really don't care who it is
[1:56:33] I don't even care who it is
[1:56:36] that might speak the word
[1:56:39] and my daughter is delivered
[1:56:43] that don't matter to me
[1:56:49] it don't have to be a preacher
[1:56:52] as a matter of fact I'm one of the
[1:56:53] sisters of our church not long ago came
[1:56:55] to Carol left to church and said sister
[1:56:56] Carol I don't want you to think I'm
[1:56:58] crazy and think listen maybe she said
[1:56:59] I've just got such a burden on my heart
[1:57:01] to go pray for sister Erica Good Sister
[1:57:03] loved the Lord and you had never been in
[1:57:04] the world even guess who in the world to
[1:57:06] leave it is
[1:57:07] and Carol said absolutely honey
[1:57:08] absolutely you go on so her and Carol
[1:57:11] went over there in the presence of God
[1:57:13] come into the room that's where Erica
[1:57:14] was wouldn't it be just like God to use
[1:57:17] a woman
[1:57:18] would it be just like God not to use
[1:57:21] some dignified Hallelujah glory to God
[1:57:24] I've been on the field for 397 years and
[1:57:27] I've won this many people to the Lord
[1:57:29] and I've done this and I've done that
[1:57:31] and God sends some little housewife over
[1:57:33] and said sister in the name of Jesus get
[1:57:35] up
[1:57:36] and Erica jumps up out of the bed
[1:57:39] oh brother sister foreign
[1:57:44] ourselves right away from the presence
[1:57:46] of God because we tend to Rally around
[1:57:50] personalities and we tend to Rally
[1:57:52] around this Gifted Man or that Gifted
[1:57:54] Man but there is only one person we
[1:57:57] should rally around that ain't a
[1:57:59] preacher that ain't a singer that ain't
[1:58:02] a musician come on somebody but that's
[1:58:04] the Lord Jesus Christ he's our healer
[1:58:08] he's our deliverer he is our King
[1:58:11] Hallelujah he is a devil stop her he is
[1:58:15] a cancer killer he is a giant slayer
[1:58:18] that's my God I said that's my God
[1:58:24] thank you
[1:58:37] they'll speak the word and it'll create
[1:58:39] itself right there

[1:58:44] seen Powers
[1:58:47] locks coming into the church now

[1:59:03] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[1:59:08] that what you've said
[1:59:10] will come to pass and you can have what
[1:59:12] you've said the placing
[1:59:16] in position
[1:59:18] or the fullness of the power of the Holy
[1:59:20] Ghost comes into the church
[1:59:22] then critics mouths
[1:59:27] will be shut
[1:59:30] hmm
[1:59:33] it'll be a short time
[1:59:36] Jesus come right off the mountain and
[1:59:37] went straight to Calvary notice

[2:01:34] the Oneness of unity
[2:01:37] he's talking to the devil
[2:01:39] and this is what it tells him
[2:01:41] I just taught this people
[2:01:44] that God is in them
[2:01:47] [Music]
[2:01:49] but I'd like to say the same thing
[2:01:50] though sloofa I just taught these people
[2:01:53] God's in them you're ruined
[2:01:56] hahaha
[2:02:04] I just talked this people God is in them
[2:02:06] and if God is in them
[2:02:09] they speak
[2:02:15] they speak
[2:02:18] to that disease and say be
[2:02:21] away
[2:02:23] from me
[2:02:29] they do it
[2:02:35] foreign
[2:02:42] they speak to that disease and say be
[2:02:44] away from me and don't doubt in their
[2:02:47] heart right then
[2:02:49] that disease
[2:02:55] Lance and Erica went to the cancer
[2:02:57] doctor on Friday
[2:02:59] he walks in the door he first thing he
[2:03:02] says is
[2:03:03] you're too young to give up
[2:03:06] you're gonna fight we're gonna fight
[2:03:09] with you
[2:03:18] I was glad he felt that way but if you'd
[2:03:20] said the exact opposite it wouldn't
[2:03:22] change nothing
[2:03:23] come on Shane said y'all right the
[2:03:25] doctors well there ain't no hope but
[2:03:26] there's still hope in Jesus there ain't
[2:03:28] no hope for you to be set free of that
[2:03:30] that's a lie as long as you believe that
[2:03:31] you'll never move but if you believe
[2:03:33] that well the Holy Ghost I'm a daughter
[2:03:35] of God I've been telling Erica tell him
[2:03:38] why you want to live tell him I want to
[2:03:40] be a wife to my husband I want to be a
[2:03:42] mother to my daughters I want to be a
[2:03:44] daughter to my family I want to come
[2:03:46] back to church she cries she cries
[2:03:48] nearly weekly because she can't come to
[2:03:51] church and be of the house of God and
[2:03:53] some of you stay home because of a
[2:03:54] headache I say shame on you you imagine
[2:03:57] brother Ron Spencer getting up preaching
[2:03:59] fighting cancer every day of his life
[2:04:01] the people he will condemn at the day of
[2:04:03] judgment and they stay home for the
[2:04:05] least little saying I'll tell your
[2:04:07] friends this time that we arise and
[2:04:09] realize who we are we are part of the
[2:04:12] army of God you are important you are
[2:04:15] important you are important Hallelujah I
[2:04:18] cannot do this on my own I need you we
[2:04:22] need one another and Together We Will
[2:04:25] Conquer hell
[2:04:33] let me close
[2:04:36] I may find a place to stop
[2:04:39] the Lord put this sermon together for me
[2:04:46] well for me
[2:04:48] it takes me days
[2:04:49] [Laughter]
[2:04:51] I knew we was going to have a time today
[2:04:53] when he started pouring this out on me I
[2:04:55] thought Jesus Oh Glory to God I can't
[2:04:57] wait to get to church tomorrow I can't
[2:05:00] wait because I believe we're going to
[2:05:01] see a great manifestation
[2:05:05] and because I don't care what it is if
[2:05:08] you say to the mountain be moved listen
[2:05:10] carefully
[2:05:12] if you've got to go over the mountain
[2:05:14] for a purpose
[2:05:16] somebody would say oh I'm a great man of
[2:05:18] Faith I'll move that mountain it'll
[2:05:20] never move
[2:05:22] but if there's something over the
[2:05:23] mountain that you've got to get over
[2:05:26] there
[2:05:27] to do the will of God
[2:05:29] and you can't get over it under it or
[2:05:33] around it and yet something in your
[2:05:35] heart is telling you to go
[2:05:39] you speak the word
[2:05:41] don't you doubt
[2:05:43] and maybe when you speak the word only
[2:05:46] one little grain of sand
[2:05:51] we'll fall
[2:05:52] but it's on its Road
[2:05:54] and the next day maybe a spoonful may
[2:05:58] drop the next day a teacup full you'll
[2:06:03] never notice it but if you'll just hold
[2:06:05] steady Hallelujah
[2:06:08] knowing that it's being done after a
[2:06:10] while the whole thing will fall in
[2:06:15] That's the Way It Is by Divine Healing
[2:06:18] when you see the working of the Holy
[2:06:19] Spirit the word laid on the Holy Spirit
[2:06:21] anointing that word proving it that he's
[2:06:24] here in our midst to vindicate himself
[2:06:25] to give you the promise then you accept
[2:06:28] your healing
[2:06:31] the standard
[2:06:47] the Holy Ghost is deity
[2:06:50] God tabernacled in men
[2:06:53] it's more than a sensation more than
[2:06:55] speaking in tongues more than shoutings
[2:06:58] in the spirit it's more than weeping
[2:07:00] more than joining the church it's guilty
[2:07:03] God himself tabernacled
[2:07:06] in that person
[2:07:07] and when he can speak
[2:07:15] same
[2:07:16] just the same
[2:07:20] it's gone
[2:07:26] that's the church
[2:07:28] of Jesus Christ
[2:07:30] that's the way the First Apostolic
[2:07:32] Church
[2:07:34] forth
[2:07:37] praise the Lord
[2:07:39] praise the Lord
[2:07:43] you imagine a little insignificant
[2:07:46] ignorant woman
[2:07:48] sitting there hearing the prophet talk
[2:07:50] about the great things that God had done
[2:07:54] brother George Wright you've hunted
[2:07:55] squirrels all these years have you ever
[2:07:57] seen one in the thicket if you ever this
[2:07:59] no brother random I I ain't never seen
[2:08:02] it
[2:08:03] well the only thing I know is it must
[2:08:04] have been Jehovah Jireh
[2:08:08] and that was little Hattie
[2:08:11] that ain't nothing
[2:08:13] but the truth
[2:08:17] so sisters don't worry don't get you an
[2:08:20] iPad and start sending to preach the
[2:08:21] sermon to preach the word
[2:08:23] you're a part to contribute to the body
[2:08:25] may not be but a half a dozen words
[2:08:29] or it may not be but one
[2:08:31] amen and when you say Amen healing flows
[2:08:36] through your body
[2:08:37] Oh Glory to God maybe the spirit of God
[2:08:40] but inspire me or some other minister to
[2:08:42] say God's going to bring your children
[2:08:44] back God hallelujah you believe what you
[2:08:47] want to believe I believe we're in an
[2:08:49] hour when God is calling back the
[2:08:52] backsliders
[2:08:53] don't give up on your children don't
[2:08:55] give up on your family don't give up on
[2:08:57] your loved ones come on somebody Do You
[2:08:59] Realize by you saying amen and agreeing
[2:09:02] to that it might be your very word that
[2:09:05] will punctuate and release the holy
[2:09:07] ghost out of this service and go start
[2:09:09] dealing with that boy you're yours
[2:09:10] sitting over the beer in his hand today
[2:09:12] sitting there hiring a kite on dope and
[2:09:14] that amen from your heart why because
[2:09:16] you said what had you right said be it
[2:09:19] unto me Lord yes Lord that's right
[2:09:20] that's your word that ain't nothing but
[2:09:22] the truth except you condensed it in
[2:09:24] that little four-letter word
[2:09:26] amen being unto me Lord be it unto my
[2:09:30] son be it unto my daughter bring them
[2:09:33] back God
[2:09:36] Hallelujah
[2:09:39] as a certain young man away from God
[2:09:42] told his parents not long ago
[2:09:45] you all quit praying for me
[2:09:48] this is your all's fault
[2:09:50] I ain't got no peace I ain't got this
[2:09:53] thank God I ain't got no money y'all

[2:17:12] Hallelujah it reverberated in my soul
[2:17:15] last week
[2:17:17] every time I'd hear the prophet say it
[2:17:19] when he talked about little Georgie
[2:17:21] Carter laying there in that bed for all
[2:17:23] of those years nine years and so many
[2:17:26] months
[2:17:27] she was that little lamb
[2:17:30] Hallelujah that the prophet heard
[2:17:33] screaming out
[2:17:34] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:17:37] and he said she was born
[2:17:40] to serve God
[2:17:42] or it was like it was like he called my

[2:17:47] Hallelujah may we hear our name called
[2:17:50] today Father
[2:17:51] that we won't just hear Georgie Carter

[2:17:58] admiration for but may we hear our name
[2:18:01] call from there
[2:18:03] it's Harry several years ago was
[2:18:05] listened to the invisible Union and the
[2:18:07] prophet talks about the old violinist as
[2:18:09] he picked up the violin and there was
[2:18:11] auctioning off who gave me a dollar who
[2:18:13] give me five who give me this and that
[2:18:15] but all of a sudden someone stepped out
[2:18:17] of the audience and put rosin on the bow
[2:18:20] and began to tune the violin
[2:18:23] Hallelujah and then the bids went from a
[2:18:26] dollar or five to a thousand five
[2:18:28] thousand ten thousand what was it the
[2:18:30] touch of the master and then the prophet
[2:18:33] changes over from the violin and to say
[2:18:36] I called you and I'll ordained you and
[2:18:38] so on and so on and Harry said it just
[2:18:41] so punctuated it was like the Lord God
[2:18:43] was speaking to him himself that's when
