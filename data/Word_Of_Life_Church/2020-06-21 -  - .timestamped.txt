[7:51] take time to mention this sister Lane
[7:54] ball had been suffering from an
[7:56] excruciating headache for several days
[7:59] had to keep a cold calm pass on her on

[8:21] whatever your request is today you hold
[8:23] it to the Lord we just want to commit
[8:25] all these things unto the Lord brother
[8:26] Joel Brown if you would come back this
[8:28] morning take us to the Lord in prayer
[8:29] take this opportunity at this time to
[8:32] wish all of our fathers a very happy
[8:34] Father's Day may God bless you on your
[8:36] day certainly appreciate brother Joel
[8:38] Brown and the Brown family brother Joel
[8:40] god bless you let's pray Heavenly Father
[8:44] we counted an honor a joy to not so much
[8:48] be in this place but to be in your
[8:51] presence O Lord and to be where the
[8:54] faith has been expressed many many times
[8:57] and we know that there are ones gathered
[9:00] around their computers around their
[9:01] tablets around their screens and we just
[9:04] ask that you just move into those homes
[9:06] and move into those hotel rooms move
[9:09] into those vehicles wherever they may be
[9:11] Oh God
[9:12] may be out under a tree somewhere father
[9:14] because they don't have a proper place
[9:15] as far as what we would say a building
[9:17] but Lord they've assembled together to
[9:20] hear from you and we just ask that you
[9:22] would just express yourself in a mighty
[9:24] way as you've never done before father
[9:27] and these requests of Prayer the
[9:28] testimonies that have gone forth Lord
[9:31] it's just a fraction quite frankly not
[9:34] even a fraction that we could probably
[9:36] even see it's so small of what we hold
[9:38] in our hand compared to those around the
[9:41] world father the needs that are coming
[9:43] up to you father our country is in
[9:45] trouble
[9:46] our world is in trouble Oh God and we
[9:49] need to hear from you right now father
[9:51] God and your people are calling upon you
[9:54] and just as it was with the children of
[9:56] Israel Lord when it was time to go Lord
[9:59] they were calling for you and you came
[10:00] for them Lord you came to deliver your
[10:03] people and so father that lets me know
[10:05] as we are here getting ready to take our
[10:08] exodus we aren't to be the ones calling
[10:11] you back so wherever that last seed is
[10:15] wherever that last person is that's to
[10:18] come
[10:18] that's to receive you Lord maybe it
[10:21] would be me that would say a kind word
[10:22] to a stranger maybe it would be someone
[10:25] in Africa maybe it'd be someone in Chile
[10:27] that would say a kind word to express
[10:30] love to passers-by or a family member a
[10:33] friend in need and that would be it it
[10:34] would sink it would catch and that would
[10:37] cause you to rise up from that seat Lord
[10:40] and be on your way and I can see the
[10:42] robes as they drop down around your
[10:44] ankles Oh God as you begin to make your
[10:46] way back father and may it be soon
[10:48] Father come soon Lord Jesus we need your
[10:52] father God we need you right now in this
[10:55] time and may the testimonies continue to
[10:57] come forth father for what you've done
[10:59] and it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[11:01] amen here just in a few minutes whether

[26:43] you Lord Jesus hallelujah hallelujah
[26:47] praise the Lord we greet you today the
[26:51] name of the Lord Jesus there's not many
[26:54] of us here physically but I'll tell you
[26:57] one thing it feels like there's a whole
[26:58] host that you're with us in the presence
[27:01] of God and it's such an honor that we
[27:04] can be able to gather together here
[27:06] today we'll come read together three
[27:09] brothers who stand with him in Hebrews
[27:10] chapter five want to grade all of our
[27:12] fathers today and certainly wish them a
[27:14] Happy Father's Day
[27:16] trust it'll be a blessed day for you
[27:19] amen we counted a great great privilege
[27:23] to be able to worship the Lord in spirit
[27:25] and truth I'll tell you the presence of
[27:27] the Lord so wonderful last night sort of
[27:29] is so awesome brother Darrell just done
[27:31] a tremendous job so appreciate him
[27:33] following the leading of the Lord I'm
[27:35] told him after service I felt like with
[27:38] your many testimonies from that you know
[27:40] God's presence is coming in such a such
[27:42] a wonderful way we just pray for each to
[27:45] those of you that have been sick and
[27:48] afflicted by various things and we just
[27:51] know that God is mindful of us during
[27:52] this time that he's going to he's going
[27:54] to help us we'll read from Hebrews
[27:57] chapter 5 if you would verse 5 so also
[28:02] Christ glorified not himself to be made
[28:07] an high priest but he that said unto him
[28:11] thou art my son
[28:14] today have I begotten thee you say us
[28:19] also in another place thou art a priest
[28:22] forever after the order of melchizedek
[28:28] this word ever is a it's a strange word
[28:32] it's a Greek word of course this is the
[28:34] language it was written in but it it can
[28:37] mean eternal but it can also mean age
[28:42] lasting or it can also mean one age
[28:47] coupled with another age so the
[28:51] application of this word is very
[28:53] important whenever you read it miss read
[28:55] this again in verse six he also says
[28:57] also in another place thou art a priest
[29:00] for ever after the order of melchizedek
[29:04] so we know the priesthood even actually
[29:08] of Melchizedek will come to a spot to
[29:12] where that it will fade into the eternal
[29:14] so it is a space of time it is a large
[29:17] one that it is a space of time verse
[29:20] seven who in the days of his flesh when
[29:23] he had offered up prayers and
[29:25] supplications with strong crying and
[29:29] tears unto him that was able to save him
[29:36] from death so Jesus is crying for a
[29:42] savior not because he's lost not because
[29:47] he's wretched but he's crying to be
[29:50] saved from death but if he got saved
[29:56] from death we would remain lost so the
[30:02] Savior cried for a savior but the Savior
[30:07] turned the Savior down that the Savior
[30:11] could fulfill the Savior's will and save
[30:15] all of us
[30:18] yeah with strong crying and tears and to
[30:24] him that was able to save him from death
[30:27] and was heard in that he feared he
[30:36] feared let's pray together Lord Jesus
[30:42] thank you thank you so much for coming
[30:49] to this earth and allowing yourself to
[30:52] feel this type of feeling you are not
[30:58] lost as I said you are not a sinner but
[31:02] you did not want to die this type of
[31:04] death so your cried for a savior but the
[31:11] Savior could not answer your cries and
[31:14] you be able to fulfill your purpose and
[31:20] you were ok with that because you were
[31:24] ministered to and that angelic
[31:28] ministration helped you fulfill your
[31:31] will and line it up with Father's will
[31:36] so we know Lord this is one reason why
[31:39] you send ministering spirits to us they
[31:45] are both visible and invisible those
[31:50] beings which we sense around we cannot
[31:56] see them for the most part but we sense
[32:00] a charge stronger than electricity
[32:04] stronger than anything man would be able
[32:07] to make it's the charge from another
[32:10] realm and we're so grateful when you
[32:14] send them near us but we know also there
[32:17] are ministering angels that are on the
[32:20] earth call servants of God that yield
[32:25] themselves to you Lord
[32:27] and you speak through them to our hearts
[32:30] to encourage us when we're down so
[32:33] father we thank you we President to be
[32:35] mindful of all the needs of your people
[32:37] today Lord I'm thinking her brother wait
[32:40] aunt landlord you see this serger that
[32:42] he had to have and Lord it's affected
[32:45] his ability to swallow father we called
[32:48] our brother's name right now in the name
[32:50] of Jesus may the Spirit of God touch our
[32:54] brother Lord make him well may there be
[32:57] no lasting results of this Lord and our
[33:00] brother's life all the rest of the needs
[33:02] of your children speak to us today
[33:04] father from your great word we sent your
[33:08] here Lord in a mighty way we thank you
[33:11] Lord Jesus
[33:12] help me to get out of the way father I
[33:15] pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[33:19] god bless you brothers you may be seated
[33:21] god bless your saints that are streaming
[33:22] today we're certainly long for the day
[33:27] when we can be back together again in
[33:29] the presence of the Lord but until that
[33:32] time arrives we believe the Lord
[33:33] understands well they are and he'll
[33:36] compensate for us and and help us let us
[33:40] look back if we can here to verse 5 this
[33:43] morning so also Christ glorified not
[33:48] himself to be made a high priest this is
[33:52] astounding to me the great position that
[33:55] the Lord Jesus took upon himself of
[33:58] course we know he had to in order to be
[34:01] a willing lamb to die for us but even in
[34:04] fulfilling the Father's will the Lord
[34:08] Jesus never assumed upon his fulfillment
[34:13] of that to ask Spirit God for such a
[34:18] glorified exalted position it helps me
[34:22] to realize that whenever we are looking
[34:27] for positions and we are desiring and
[34:31] wanting an element of God's glory to be
[34:35] shared upon our lives it makes you to
[34:38] understand why that
[34:40] the Prophet would tell us over and over
[34:43] again
[34:43] those who desire such a position most of
[34:48] the time are not qualified to be so but
[34:52] the Lord Jesus himself that not another
[34:56] human being or let me say it this way
[34:58] even an angelic being could say that
[35:03] they had done what he'd done yet he
[35:06] would not assume because of that
[35:09] obedience and fulfillment he would not
[35:13] assume to ascribe to the position of
[35:16] being High Priest on his own now he knew
[35:20] of course that this position was going
[35:23] to be his he actually quoted Psalms 110
[35:28] in Matthew which alluded to the position
[35:32] of the order of Melchizedek
[35:35] but yet Paul catches the attitude of the
[35:38] resurrected glorified Christ that he
[35:41] never actually assumed or stepped into
[35:45] that position on his own so also Christ
[35:48] glorified not himself to be made a high
[35:51] priest but he that said unto Him thou
[35:54] art my son today have I begotten thee
[35:58] never remember the Lord Jesus was
[36:00] begotten in the womb of Mary to the
[36:03] Immaculate Conception or the virgin
[36:06] birth but actually this begotten here is
[36:09] not referring to that begotten in the
[36:11] womb but it was a begotten which took
[36:15] place after his resurrection because it
[36:19] involves the priesthood of Melchizedek
[36:23] now the Lord Jesus acted out he was a
[36:28] priest of course the woman touching the
[36:31] hem of his garment and he was touched by
[36:33] the feelings of the infirmities of the
[36:36] people but he actually never entered
[36:38] into the order of Melchizedek until he
[36:43] entered into the order of an endless
[36:46] life now the life of Jesus the human the
[36:50] body
[36:51] today that it started and it had a day
[36:54] that it could die is L right so this
[36:58] could not be then the fulfillment or the
[37:02] completion of the order of melchizedek
[37:06] until after his resurrection notice in
[37:10] verse six and he say us also in another
[37:13] place thou art a priest forever after
[37:17] the order of melchizedek so it
[37:20] represents the Messiah as being the high
[37:24] priests by the declaration of God now
[37:28] this is not a self assuming role and
[37:30] it's not something the Lord Jesus said
[37:32] I'll do it I'll do it let me do it let
[37:34] me do it but it was by the declaration
[37:37] of God and remember it was for the
[37:40] coming messianic Kingdom that he was
[37:43] going to be not only priests but king on
[37:48] the throne now this is something that no
[37:50] other man had been able to do except the
[37:54] ascribed position of Melchizedek himself
[37:57] now this is going to be when the
[38:00] priesthood of Melchizedek will actually
[38:03] come to a termination it will be when
[38:05] the kingdom of the Messiah will be
[38:09] turned back into the realm of the
[38:12] eternal now listen to me carefully
[38:14] that the Messianic Kingdom actually
[38:17] begins with the dispensation of the
[38:20] grace of God and it goes through the
[38:23] dispensation of the church Aegis comes
[38:25] over into the span of the or the great
[38:29] honeymoon which will be the great time
[38:31] in heaven but it also comes over into
[38:34] the Millennium reign and then it will
[38:37] end at the end of the millennial reign
[38:39] when time consummates
[38:42] and comes back into the realm of
[38:45] eternity once we move into eternity
[38:48] something not only happens to this earth
[38:51] and she gets her baptism of far the Holy
[38:54] Ghost but something also happens to the
[38:58] see annek Empire the Messianic Kingdom
[39:02] now remember as long as there are people
[39:05] that are being saved in the Gentile
[39:08] Church ages in the time of the
[39:11] Millennium there will be people that
[39:13] will be turning their lives over under
[39:15] the reign of the son of David in the
[39:17] messianic Empire and as long as that is
[39:20] going on then the administration of the
[39:23] Messiah under the order of Melchizedek
[39:27] will be needed but once all rebellion
[39:31] has been annihilated
[39:33] once all rebellion now think of it
[39:35] rebellion will still be in the hearts of
[39:39] some of those unregenerate people in the
[39:43] time of the millennium and when the
[39:46] millennium is over some of them will
[39:48] actually revolt against the Lord Jesus
[39:50] and His Saints in gorath odd bodies so
[39:55] the end of the kingdom cannot be turned
[39:58] over to the eternal until all rebellion
[40:02] has been brought in subjection now this
[40:06] is what happened of course in heaven
[40:08] that rebellion was brought down on the
[40:10] earth it happened in the heart of a
[40:12] first then it happened in the heart of
[40:14] Adam and then it's happened in the heart
[40:17] of every mortal every sense and until
[40:20] that rebellion has been annihilated
[40:23] there must be a channel a dispensation
[40:26] of grace by which God can deal was man
[40:30] oh he is so great he is so phenomenal
[40:33] and so wonderful I'm sure that we don't
[40:36] understand one inkling about the
[40:38] greatness of how big and wonderful that
[40:40] our God is but looking at it in this way
[40:43] as long as God is dealing with man on
[40:46] the earth through the act of rebellion
[40:49] God had to condon sin to a level of
[40:52] administration of grace to keep from
[40:55] annihilating the entirety of the human
[40:58] race
[40:58] think of it
[41:00] to this very day and our state of
[41:03] mortality in our human bodies we could
[41:07] not be allowed to come into the realm of
[41:10] the eternal because of our mistakes our
[41:13] shortcomings are inherited weaknesses
[41:16] and all that we are we still need I know
[41:19] there's some of the message that Fela
[41:20] they don't need him on the throne of God
[41:23] they don't need him as a mercy seat
[41:25] it shows how ignorant they really are of
[41:27] their self and how ignorant they are of
[41:30] the Bible we will need him as long as we
[41:33] are mortals every day we live on this
[41:36] earth now what you notice is how that
[41:39] Paul catches determination of the
[41:41] Messianic Kingdom and how it rolls over
[41:43] into the kingdom of the eternal in first
[41:45] Corinthians chapter 15 verse 24 then
[41:48] cometh the end now listen they in so
[41:53] before it can roll back from this little
[41:55] loop this the hickey will pull back up
[41:58] into the circle of eternity again there
[42:01] must be a termination so in the
[42:03] beginning the prophet said was when time
[42:06] began so there must be an end of time
[42:10] now we are in the end time right and we
[42:13] believe at the end of all things is at
[42:15] hand but yet the end of time will
[42:18] actually not take place until I to the
[42:21] Millennium and the white throne judgment
[42:23] and then when all of this terminates
[42:26] then God will actually end time and time
[42:30] will cease to exist so the loop will be
[42:34] pulled back up into the circle and all
[42:37] the redeemable subjects of God will be
[42:39] fully clothed and their bodies of
[42:41] immortality the grace of God the spilled
[42:44] over into the book of life and those
[42:46] ever able to receive them will also be
[42:48] given eternal life and then the
[42:51] messianic Empire of the Lord Jesus which
[42:53] is the humanity of God will now have
[42:56] terminated because it completely stood
[42:59] between fallen man
[43:01] and the eternal and once the end
[43:03] absolutely consummates then there will
[43:06] be no longer the need of a mediator all
[43:10] praise God we still will need that
[43:13] humanity in the Millennium for those who
[43:16] are not yet converted praise God
[43:19] now what's this Paul said then cometh
[43:22] the end when he shall have delivered up
[43:26] the kingdom to God now here we're
[43:28] talking about the Lord Jesus now when I
[43:30] talk about two gods and we're not
[43:32] talking about actually two separate
[43:34] people but the Lord Jesus is only our
[43:36] visible extension of the invisible God
[43:40] it is the part of God that comes
[43:42] descends to the level of man that will
[43:45] allow the Justice of God to reveal
[43:47] himself to man through this channel of
[43:50] grace called the Lord Jesus but yet he's
[43:53] identified here under the Messiah ruler
[43:56] and he says then cometh sayin when he
[43:58] the Lord Jesus so had delivered up the
[44:01] kingdom to God even the father when he
[44:04] shall have put down all rule and all
[44:09] authority and all power now whatever
[44:11] this has happened at the end of the
[44:14] millennium then the Lord Jesus the
[44:16] humanity of God will now move into this
[44:19] back into this realm of the eternal
[44:22] so the mediatorial kingdom that has been
[44:25] established for several thousand years
[44:26] will have reached its accomplishment and
[44:29] fulfillment with the fullness of human
[44:32] Redemption the fullness of human
[44:34] Redemption also includes Botany life
[44:36] animal life the cellular system the
[44:38] stars the universe the earth everything
[44:41] exactly as it will be roll back to the
[44:43] setting of eternity
[44:45] what's eternity comes into view then the
[44:48] mediatorial work of the Messiah will
[44:51] have completed and consummated all
[44:53] hallelujah notices and Paul says in
[44:57] verse 25 for he must reign till he
[45:01] put all enemies under his feet so that
[45:05] is rebellion that is stubbornness that
[45:07] is sickness but it also includes death
[45:10] so it is the father who puts all enemies
[45:14] under the subjection of his own son or
[45:17] his own humanity notice in Matthew 22 44
[45:22] the Lord said unto my lord sit thou on
[45:27] my right hand till I make thine enemies
[45:30] thy footstool now notice when this is
[45:34] completed then the son the humanity the
[45:38] Word made flesh the body then that will
[45:41] be able to revert the entirety of the
[45:43] kingdom now notice it's not that Jesus
[45:46] the second person it's gonna be like a
[45:48] lieutenant or he's gonna be this guy in
[45:50] second command or no it simply moves
[45:53] under the shadow of the Father God
[45:57] everything that has been fully redeemed
[45:59] will now be able to see father God in an
[46:03] expression of his glory that we was not
[46:06] even be able to see in the rapture that
[46:09] we was not even able to see in the
[46:12] Millenium how the limbs gonna be a
[46:13] wonderful time but father will still not
[46:16] be on the earth in the fullness of his
[46:18] attribute yet in the Millennium it is
[46:21] the honeymoon right and then after time
[46:24] ends we will go back into the eternal
[46:28] Kingdom praise God notice what will
[46:31] happen then the Son of God the humanity
[46:34] the Jesus quoting this the Lord said
[46:36] unto my lord sit thou on my right hand
[46:39] till I make thine enemies thy footstool
[46:41] so when this is done the Lord Jesus of
[46:45] course in Revelation 1117 saying we give
[46:48] these Saints Oh Lord God Almighty which
[46:50] art and wast and art to come because
[46:52] thou hast
[46:54] taken to thee thy great power and his
[46:58] reign now notice so this was something
[46:59] that was delegated and given to the
[47:03] sonship of God this was given to the
[47:06] humanity of God and he has now put his
[47:09] foot on the footstool of every enemy
[47:13] they have become under him sickness and
[47:16] sorrow and death and suffering they have
[47:19] become as simply a footstool under his
[47:22] feet notice in verse 26 the last enemy
[47:25] that shall be destroyed is dead so now
[47:28] you'll be looking at after the white
[47:30] throne judgment and then we move into
[47:33] the face of the eternal now this all
[47:35] comes under the administration of the
[47:38] Messianic Kingdom I remember God
[47:40] absolutely absolutely the Lord Jesus
[47:43] could not be his own father
[47:45] but God could become his own son and he
[47:48] did so Jesus was the visibility of the
[47:52] invisible God he was the very heart of
[47:55] God the very Justice of God the fullness
[47:57] of God the wrath of God could never come
[47:59] down on the earth and walk among sinful
[48:02] men he would annihilate every one of
[48:04] them the Lord God the eternal could not
[48:06] be here among us this morning because of
[48:09] our mortality because of our failures
[48:12] our faults amen
[48:13] because of our mistakes he could not
[48:16] deal with that he could not stand it his
[48:18] justice would require death but what did
[48:21] he do he projected something out of his
[48:24] own being hallelujah he projected
[48:27] something out of his own being which was
[48:30] his own humanity
[48:32] he could become a human he could
[48:34] understand if he could become a human he
[48:37] could relate if he could become a human
[48:40] he could have mercy and such an extreme
[48:43] he could never have in the Old Testament
[48:46] as a pillar of fire so he must convince
[48:49] him to be a human and he will remain a
[48:52] glorified human through eternity Oh
[48:57] hallelujah
[48:58] notice this in verse 27 for he has put
[49:02] all things under his feet but what he
[49:07] says all things are put under him it is
[49:10] manifest that he is excepted which did
[49:15] put all things under him so the
[49:18] administration of the Kingdom of grace
[49:21] now listen carefully so you don't
[49:23] misunderstand me we'll finally be closed
[49:31] no more grace no more mercy no more
[49:37] walking by faith we will live by sight
[49:42] by the power of God we will no longer
[49:46] had to sell I know he's here I know it I
[49:48] can feel him I came feeling about but I
[49:50] know he loves me I know he does I take
[49:52] his word for it No
[49:54] we'll see you will see him so the door
[49:57] of grace and this phase of scripture
[50:01] cannot be open at the same time to see
[50:04] this ruler to seeing him in this form of
[50:09] his person it means that grace has
[50:13] brought us to this platform but as long
[50:17] as the door of grace is open it shows
[50:21] is a need of immediate sort it shows
[50:25] there are people that have not yet
[50:28] arrived into the states of perfection
[50:31] but when all the enemies have been made
[50:34] subject to the Lord Jesus then the Lord
[50:37] Jesus to humanity will be able to step
[50:40] back under the Father strong again under
[50:43] the Shekinah under that great glory and
[50:46] it will testify that he has been
[50:49] accepted grace is no longer needed mercy
[50:54] is no longer needed
[50:55] pardon is no longer needed mediatory is
[51:00] no longer needed he has successfully
[51:03] brought every attribute back into the
[51:07] realm of eternity and will be therefore
[51:13] beholding the glory of the eternal you
[51:23] see there is a great distinction became
[51:27] between the kingdom of grace and the
[51:33] kingdom of glory we've never seen that
[51:41] yet we're under the kingdom of grace is
[51:49] it any wonder that the prophet calls it
[51:52] even for our body change rapturing grace
[51:59] let's face the facts if we leave this
[52:02] world and a body changed it'll be
[52:04] rapture and grace it ain't cause your
[52:07] rapturing perfect and him because your
[52:09] rapturing absolutes and your this and
[52:11] that it will be Grace it gets us out of
[52:13] here it's grace it saved us it was grace
[52:16] this sanctified us it was grace they
[52:19] give us the Holy Ghost
[52:20] it's grace this help on sook
[52:22] it's great to selfless every day of my
[52:24] life it will be grace the consummation
[52:27] of grace leading to our new body will be
[52:29] what rapture and grace I've said that
[52:32] the marriage supper of the Lamb the
[52:34] grace of God the grace of God but one
[52:38] day the grace of God will give way and
[52:41] the door will open up to the kingdom of
[52:44] glory no longer will I have to stand
[52:46] there but my head bow because of my
[52:49] humanity no longer laughter bow Oh God
[52:52] forgive me oh god I'm sorry
[52:53] Oh God forgive me I will never pray
[52:56] another prayer forgiveness I will never
[52:58] say Lord I'm sorry lord please forgive
[53:00] my brothers lord please forgive my
[53:03] sister but I will I've been completed by
[53:07] the Messiah himself and when he has
[53:10] completed me when he has completed you
[53:13] and the cycle of redemption has been
[53:15] consummated the kingdom of Grace will
[53:18] pull itself into the kingdom of glory
[53:22] beyond abuse even many of our songs of
[53:43] heaven are still written in the
[53:46] dispensation of the perception of the
[53:49] gospel of grace and the kingdom of grace
[53:52] and in our minds our suppose we struggle
[53:56] of trying to think how it will be in the
[53:59] kingdom of glory without the
[54:01] dispensation of grace still being there
[54:03] all I was lost
[54:05] Lord you say man Lord I'm not worthy
[54:10] please don't misunderstand me one day
[54:14] you won't take that weight no more
[54:22] because the Lord Jesus would have so
[54:25] completed his work he will no longer be
[54:30] immediate
[54:32] under the Messianic kingdom don't offend
[54:38] the son of man be coming Messiah
[54:42] literally he will enter in under the
[54:45] father's glory
[54:46] what's this in verse 28 Paul said when
[54:49] all things shall be subdued unto him
[54:53] then shall the word the son also himself
[55:00] be subject and I'm getting in your mind
[55:05] yours this young guy he's gonna be under
[55:07] this old man no it's simply a Picasso
[55:10] which is a referring or a changing of
[55:14] the order praise God it is a changing of
[55:19] the order or an arrangement
[55:22] but what's multiple things are put
[55:26] together and this piano with the strings
[55:29] and things that are on it one note
[55:36] Lupo tousle one notes fine boy when you
[55:42] put them others in there what does it do
[55:44] it makes it not only a note but a chord
[55:47] and then the chord comes together and it
[55:49] makes another chord and another chord
[55:51] and a song and a melody and so on and so
[55:54] on
[55:54] and whenever the Lord God moves into
[55:58] this final stage and this is what we
[56:00] will deal with for eternity when we will
[56:02] no longer in our minds under the grace
[56:05] dispensation oh I was lost I was lost
[56:07] some onwards they do you actually think
[56:10] you could enjoy heaven going around with
[56:12] that in your mind walking around you're
[56:14] going to heaven today of how I'm not
[56:16] worthy going up to the city I'm not
[56:18] worthy you'll never have that thought
[56:20] again you're never thought you'll never
[56:24] have that before you again under the
[56:27] Messiah himself moving into the becoming
[56:31] subject under the glory of God proves my
[56:35] friends it's not a humiliation to our
[56:37] Lord Jesus it is an absent of his
[56:40] position and a complete fulfillment of
[56:44] what the humanity of God was able to do
[56:47] the humanity of God was the only thing
[56:49] that could fulfill this the locals could
[56:51] not do it the fullness of the attribute
[56:54] of God in spirit form could not do it
[56:56] God must become a human notice is also
[57:08] he himself must be subject unto him that
[57:12] put all things under him that God may be
[57:18] all you know Jesus will continue to
[57:23] reign on the earth under the glory
[57:26] Chicana of the Father through eternity
[57:32] because you see God is not a man only in
[57:38] Christ so there won't be two Thrones the
[57:42] three friends John never looked up and
[57:44] said I saw three Thrones and ever John
[57:45] said I saw one throne
[57:47] and one that said on it so here ii ah
[57:52] will hang over the son a mirth and what
[57:58] is this call Peter called it the coming
[58:00] of the day of God air berg let me just
[58:09] tell our animators smart he can rant and
[58:12] rave he can do all he wants to the
[58:15] disease and sickness and all kinds of
[58:18] things but his days are numbered let me
[58:22] just tell them Satan your kingdom is
[58:25] coming down cannot say it will not stand
[58:31] but the coming of the day of God is at
[58:36] hand my brother's system notice is in
[58:39] the day of God John saw peculiar saying
[58:47] revelation 21 22 and I saw no temple
[58:52] therein for the Lord God Almighty and
[58:56] the RAM notice are not the temples but
[59:06] the temple so Jesus is the body the
[59:11] father is the Chicana a Solomon's Temple
[59:15] was the house and the father was the
[59:19] glory the temple he was actually
[59:28] building the humanity and type of the
[59:31] Lord Jesus and it was the father that
[59:34] entered inside that temple and that
[59:36] temple was throw down and destroy and so
[59:39] did God allow his humanity to be tore
[59:42] down but he said I will not leave your
[59:44] soul and
[59:45] and your body will not corrupt why
[59:48] because I'm gonna live in that for
[59:51] eternity
[59:56] hallelujah
[59:57] so John looks around and being a Jew is
[1:00:00] used to attempt least you still play
[1:00:01] what place to worship and he said I
[1:00:03] didn't see no place of worship but he
[1:00:07] said the Lord God Almighty and the lamb
[1:00:12] are the temple there so they one mention
[1:00:18] of him one man sent over there but it's
[1:00:20] the Lord God Almighty and the lamb so
[1:00:26] the father is hanging over his body help
[1:00:33] me Jesus
[1:00:34] what's this in future home city was the
[1:00:37] throne on top revelation 21:23 they need
[1:00:40] no light for the lamb and the Lord God
[1:00:43] is a lie down see the Lord God is that
[1:00:49] pillar of fire that followed the chiller
[1:00:52] missile through the wilderness and he is
[1:00:54] ascended upon the throne in that perfect
[1:00:58] Kingdom the kingdom that Jesus is going
[1:01:02] to surrender to the father that God may
[1:01:07] be all and in all Jesus sets upon his
[1:01:12] throne here as our Joseph and the king
[1:01:17] is that light that will be on Mount Zion
[1:01:23] and his holy light will flood the entire
[1:01:28] city hallelujah
[1:01:35] question-answer 64 on top Mount Zion
[1:01:38] will set the land and the city will need
[1:01:40] no right for the lamb is the light
[1:01:43] thereof will be the father which is the
[1:01:51] Lucas God the great light the eternal
[1:01:57] light that will shine just above the
[1:02:01] food and Jesus will not be on his father
[1:02:06] stone he'll be on his song and the
[1:02:08] father well what's the father and son
[1:02:16] will be one a while there yes speaking
[1:02:18] I'll answer before they can think I'm
[1:02:19] thinking for them that's right
[1:02:21] and Jesus who commits a perfect perfect
[1:02:24] age to a perfect Living God that he has
[1:02:29] redeemed and give over to the father as
[1:02:32] that right will turn to God the Father
[1:02:35] which is spirit not man spirit all
[1:02:44] nature of goodness gathered together
[1:02:49] that's gone praise God
[1:03:03] so let's look a little bit now at the
[1:03:07] order of Melchizedek Hebrews 566 also in
[1:03:13] another place our two priest forever
[1:03:14] after the order of Melchizedek Genesis
[1:03:18] 4:17 gives us the appearance of
[1:03:20] Melchizedek and the king of Sodom went
[1:03:25] out to meet him speaking of Abram after
[1:03:28] his return from the southern kettle
[1:03:30] eomer and of the kings that were with
[1:03:32] him at the valley of shaveh which is the
[1:03:36] King's Dale and Melchizedek king of
[1:03:41] Salem so here we have a tale
[1:03:47] of two kings Abraham goes and fights he
[1:03:54] is victorious the king of Sodom whose
[1:03:59] name was Berra de ra which means gifts
[1:04:06] he is the king of Sodom
[1:04:09] which means burning so he meets Abram
[1:04:17] another King per se - I'm Melchizedek
[1:04:28] king of Salem I hope you understand your
[1:04:34] life's journey is made up of meeting
[1:04:38] these two same kings and type Beryl
[1:04:42] represents Sodom the world everything
[1:04:46] the tries to pull you away from the
[1:04:50] divine providence of the king of Salem
[1:04:54] he meets April oh my we'll find out what
[1:04:58] he offered him your Abram is now faced
[1:05:02] after this great victory and God had
[1:05:04] done a great thing for him
[1:05:06] now here comes Vera and he offers him
[1:05:08] gifts
[1:05:09] now of course Abraham had went out there
[1:05:11] and it rescued lot and the other people
[1:05:13] of Sodom and the kings of kettle a homer
[1:05:16] and the other kings had stolen the goods
[1:05:18] for Sodom and he comes back and he wants
[1:05:21] to make a deal with Abram but Abram all
[1:05:23] my he had already met Melchizedek Hamer
[1:05:28] how did this man know when he met this
[1:05:32] being that looked like a human
[1:05:38] hallelujah he broad and wide and he
[1:05:43] served to Abraham Bera
[1:05:46] offered abraham wealth goods that
[1:05:50] abraham refused his gifts but he
[1:05:56] accepted Melchizedek's
[1:06:02] he acknowledged his dependence on the
[1:06:07] king of Salem but he displayed his
[1:06:12] independence from the king of Sodom
[1:06:16] I don't need your goods I don't need
[1:06:19] your world I don't need what you've got
[1:06:22] to offer lemma can we say that today to
[1:06:24] the devil can we say to Satan and all
[1:06:27] his Laodicean riches and all the things
[1:06:30] that he's got we don't need you we don't
[1:06:32] want you we want nothing to do with you
[1:06:36] were only here until we're taken out of
[1:06:38] here but boy we turn the other way to
[1:06:40] the king of haru salaam and we say to
[1:06:44] him we need you every day every hour we
[1:06:47] can't even walk without you in this life
[1:06:50] we are totally dependent on you i
[1:06:53] realize our nation is get more and more
[1:06:56] and more on my independent from god and
[1:06:59] it is our down casting away from his
[1:07:02] presence by doing so i will be
[1:07:04] celebrating him dependence in a few
[1:07:06] weeks and relative majority of the
[1:07:09] american people are in the worst slavery
[1:07:11] they've ever been
[1:07:12] it's a slavery of sin a slavery of sin
[1:07:15] and yet many of them go to church and
[1:07:17] say they love god and they're worse off
[1:07:20] than they've ever been in their life but
[1:07:21] we say to him we need you we love you we
[1:07:26] want your words tell us what to do and
[1:07:29] we'll do it Melchizedek king of Salem
[1:07:41] brought forth bread and wine now what
[1:07:50] you notice from this prophetic stage of
[1:07:53] the implication of Melchizedek life of
[1:07:55] the typology of our Lord Jesus this is
[1:08:01] why I say cannot enter into the fullness
[1:08:02] of the Melchizedek Priesthood until
[1:08:06] after his resurrection because
[1:08:08] Melchizedek offers
[1:08:10] to Abraham the memorials of the
[1:08:14] sacrifice sacrifice this is why we take
[1:08:21] communion I can't wait to hang I'll do
[1:08:24] it again Katie this is why we're not
[1:08:28] coming up with a bloody lamb the Lord
[1:08:31] Jesus is not offering himself every day
[1:08:33] before the presence of God he did that
[1:08:37] once he was so convinced it would be
[1:08:39] successful he gave them the elements of
[1:08:42] the communion before he ever died on the
[1:08:45] cross said boys go ahead and learn how
[1:08:47] to do this because what I'm gonna do is
[1:08:48] gonna work if it'd been like us without
[1:08:53] twins they give me a few years they let
[1:08:55] me see how this is gonna work and then
[1:08:56] y'all see if you can remember I said not
[1:08:58] tell what I want you to do let's go
[1:08:59] ahead let me give you a type right now
[1:09:01] because this is going to work it's going
[1:09:03] to be this is why brother sister we
[1:09:05] don't come and we don't bring blood all
[1:09:08] over our hands and all and the presence
[1:09:09] of God but when we come up here each one
[1:09:12] in our turn and we take that little
[1:09:14] piece of bread and we press that little
[1:09:16] tiny cup to lift what is it
[1:09:18] we are testifying our Lord's work was a
[1:09:22] success because we are taking this and
[1:09:25] memorial what he does now cancer offered
[1:09:28] to the fruit of a finished work don't
[1:09:34] you understand
[1:09:35] it proved that both Melchizedek and
[1:09:37] abraham believed in Redemption the
[1:09:43] communion had never been instituted
[1:09:48] but Melchizedek instituted communion so
[1:09:58] your sets Melchizedek in a human body
[1:10:01] and he looks at his disciples and said I
[1:10:04] have long was a great desire
[1:10:08] to read this supper with you take eat
[1:10:13] this is my body drink for the assister
[1:10:19] cup of the New Testament in my blood
[1:10:22] which is shed for you as often as you
[1:10:27] drink this think of me
[1:10:29] forget a memorial and here comes
[1:10:33] Melchizedek to a breath
[1:10:37] wine and bread bear ursus here you can
[1:10:43] have souls
[1:10:44] you can have women you're gonna have
[1:10:46] money you get a popularity nut oils come
[1:10:49] on down and move down with your nephew
[1:10:53] he's living a compromised life come on
[1:10:56] down and then compromise Abraham said I
[1:10:59] refuse I am NOT a compromiser I don't
[1:11:05] want your money I don't want you else I
[1:11:07] don't want nothing you've got because if
[1:11:09] I receive the gifts of beara I will wind
[1:11:12] up in the destiny of beara which is fire
[1:11:16] of Sun but if I take communion with
[1:11:25] Melchizedek I get to live in Melchizedek
[1:11:28] stamen if I father
[1:11:33] no cares if I get one better down the
[1:11:37] power of an endless life this is the
[1:11:41] order of Melchizedek is why Jesus the
[1:11:43] man could not have entered into the
[1:11:45] fullness of the power of an endless life
[1:11:47] of Milcah so he had to give his life but
[1:11:49] after race with the dead he could move
[1:11:51] into the full administration of the
[1:11:53] order of Melchizedek said I am he
[1:11:56] but I'm alive forevermore the
[1:12:03] Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth
[1:12:11] bread and wine and he was the priest of
[1:12:15] the Most High God El Elyon enroute now
[1:12:25] back to Hebron Abram meets the two games
[1:12:32] one offers him things that will appeal
[1:12:35] to the flesh that they ride it around
[1:12:38] him what a great man you only had 318
[1:12:41] men how did you get it boy you must be a
[1:12:44] military genius what we could do with
[1:12:47] you or if you just take care of talent
[1:12:49] in your ability and your singing and
[1:12:51] your music and your preaching and so on
[1:12:53] and join with us come on over and join
[1:12:55] with us and join with you and burn with
[1:12:58] you no thank him I said no saint
[1:13:02] I'd read a little rather live over here
[1:13:04] under the oak and the plains of Mamre
[1:13:07] and have visitations from God from time
[1:13:10] to time they may not be every day they
[1:13:13] may not be a song to this honor but I'd
[1:13:15] rather live over here by myself if I
[1:13:17] have to and know that memory is where
[1:13:20] God came down to see me namely is where
[1:13:22] he met me not down on the Vale of the
[1:13:24] Kings
[1:13:25] I don't want your wealth Bella but I'll
[1:13:39] take what you have Melchizedek you
[1:13:43] imagine a bear of us still hanging
[1:13:45] around with a lawyer when Melchizedek
[1:13:48] came up and it gives him breath and why
[1:13:53] ourselves carisi he's crazy
[1:13:58] look what I gave look what I offer and
[1:14:01] he turned it down
[1:14:02] for a piece of stimulation by revelation
[1:14:13] [Applause]
[1:14:29] everything I reject you off I don't want
[1:14:44] you to say you made me rich I won't even
[1:14:49] take a shoestring but I'll take what
[1:14:56] you've got king of Salem
[1:15:01] he's God
[1:15:02] oh you imagine as he looked at him he'd
[1:15:09] heard this voice for years and years but
[1:15:14] one day the voice was made of human I'd
[1:15:22] love to see his face when you heard that
[1:15:25] voice the first time he might I had all
[1:15:29] the garb of a king or a priest or the
[1:15:31] mixture of both we don't know notice
[1:15:32] this now milk acidic he was the king of
[1:15:36] Salem and priest of the Most High God
[1:15:39] this first forbidden guest was forbidden
[1:15:43] this is not even allowed on the era of
[1:15:46] the kings this is not allowed in the era
[1:15:48] of David or Solomon erase' or none of
[1:15:51] the rest of the kings how could this
[1:15:53] person dare merge both of these great
[1:15:57] offices into one human body
[1:16:03] who right now felt like English ain't
[1:16:05] good enough to express the way I feel
[1:16:10] who was it
[1:16:12] the prefigure of the Lord Jesus what
[1:16:19] happened to lot laud accept that the
[1:16:22] gifts the positions the honor the
[1:16:26] dignity of Bella and had it not been for
[1:16:32] the bride that asks for mercy for his
[1:16:36] sorry had it had been burned up coz
[1:16:43] think about it in reality that's what he
[1:16:45] deserved
[1:16:46] he was a compromiser so don't give up on
[1:16:52] your children don't give up on your
[1:16:54] husband your wife God won't make them
[1:16:56] bride cause you asked won't it but who
[1:16:58] knows God may let them be there of
[1:16:59] course your bride and God God here in
[1:17:03] your prayer you have to put them in a
[1:17:05] premature gray if you look at me weird
[1:17:07] if you want to I'd rather the same and a
[1:17:08] premature grave and saved then live 150
[1:17:11] years and be lost that's exactly right
[1:17:14] so keep praying for all they may never
[1:17:16] be the kalam of you are but keep praying
[1:17:18] for neighbour have God may honor your
[1:17:20] prayer but Melchizedek means king of
[1:17:28] righteousness and Salem means peace so
[1:17:37] he's two kings king of righteousness and
[1:17:41] king of peace so you take his communion
[1:17:45] guess what becomes yours righteousness
[1:17:48] and peace as our brother so beautiful
[1:17:52] expressed when the world is going insane
[1:17:55] and it's going to get worse it's going
[1:17:58] to get worse but come and take communion
[1:18:00] with Melchizedek we can have peace in
[1:18:04] the midst of the storm we
[1:18:05] have peace on all the rest of the world
[1:18:07] don't know what in the world to do don't
[1:18:09] you see
[1:18:10] even as it was an Abraham's day so is it
[1:18:13] an hour day because the Lord Jesus the
[1:18:15] king of righteousness the Lord Jesus the
[1:18:18] king out peace has given us of his own
[1:18:21] furniture and obvious own nature and say
[1:18:24] eat of me children drink of me and this
[1:18:28] will be your life I promise you you will
[1:18:32] be as righteous before the eternal do we
[1:18:44] believe that if we enter into this
[1:18:49] government we always sinless God and we
[1:18:59] have peace going that way notice this
[1:19:07] and Melchizedek king of Salem brought
[1:19:10] forth bread and wine and he was the
[1:19:15] priest of the Most High God so mechanic
[1:19:19] was man priest King man glory man priest
[1:19:34] and King don't Sakurai's 6:12 speak unto
[1:19:42] him saying thus speaketh the Lord of
[1:19:43] Hosts say behold a man whose name is the
[1:19:49] branch he shall grow up out of his place
[1:19:56] he shall build the temple of the Lord
[1:20:02] you know this is messianic this is the
[1:20:03] Lord Jesus even he shall build the
[1:20:08] temple of the Lord and he shall bear the
[1:20:13] glory the Father
[1:20:16] over the son and shall sit and rule upon
[1:20:22] his phone and he shall be a priest upon
[1:20:29] his own on a council of peace shall be
[1:20:33] between them both priesthood and
[1:20:38] kingship how is it brought between the
[1:20:41] two that the justice of kingship can be
[1:20:44] honored how can the justice of kingship
[1:20:46] and the Justice of God ever be left how
[1:20:49] can it ever be led all my years the
[1:20:51] kingship of God the holy righteous
[1:20:53] justice of God and your over here is the
[1:20:55] merciful priest I can never be mad in
[1:20:58] the body of the Lord Jesus hallelujah
[1:21:01] those wipeouts offices can merge in the
[1:21:05] temple of God we shall build the temple
[1:21:09] of the Lord and his name is called the
[1:21:12] branch he said through you and you will
[1:21:39] be my branch Chiefs as I was the father
[1:21:42] frenzy understand never saw what
[1:21:46] happened to us sure I start the office
[1:21:49] of high priest
[1:21:51] it's not just the Lord Jesus hearing you
[1:21:54] when you pray and he's there all God
[1:21:57] forgives him Oh God forgive them don't
[1:21:59] shine a sound the office of high priest
[1:22:02] he's also sending his gifted men into
[1:22:06] the earth and the high priest being
[1:22:09] touched was what you're going through
[1:22:11] and it gives inspiration to a gifted man
[1:22:14] of God which has a portion of himself it
[1:22:18] was the high priest ministering to us I
[1:22:20] slept through his gift
[1:22:22] and people say all the High Priestesses
[1:22:24] start happening is that Evan yes but his
[1:22:27] presence is here on earth and he's
[1:22:29] touched by the feelings of our
[1:22:31] infirmities and when we're down and
[1:22:33] we're weary and we don't know what to do
[1:22:35] good we're not promised another one to
[1:22:37] stand and turn his back to the audience
[1:22:39] but we are promised gifts of the high
[1:22:43] priest so the high priest takes that
[1:22:46] gift and inspires you know maybe from a
[1:22:48] very simple thought and gives birth to
[1:22:51] life changing life changing things that
[1:22:54] happen and what was if the high priest
[1:22:56] heard somebody's prayer the high priest
[1:22:59] saw somebody in a sleepless night
[1:23:01] turning and tossing oh god I need help
[1:23:04] Oh God peace all God and the high priest
[1:23:09] took a ministerial gift and channeled
[1:23:12] himself though she should have said if a
[1:23:16] man of God can get out of the way toship
[1:23:18] set his preaching to you don't shut up
[1:23:21] said what you're setting under the
[1:23:23] ministry of the high priests remember
[1:23:26] the Book of Numbers who never got tell
[1:23:28] Moses tell the priest to put my name on
[1:23:33] the people the Lord bless thee and the
[1:23:38] Lord be with thee and the Lord make his
[1:23:41] face to shine upon thee the Lord make
[1:23:45] his countenance this is what they were
[1:23:46] supposed to say and by saying this they
[1:23:50] were putting the name of the Lord on the
[1:23:54] people don't you see I'm true anointed
[1:23:56] men of God preached the word they're
[1:23:58] speaking the name of God the reputation
[1:24:01] of God the character of God they're
[1:24:04] placing that on your mind your heart
[1:24:05] your soul and you're merging under the
[1:24:08] administration of the high priest which
[1:24:11] is so mindful of fortune friends who bet
[1:24:15] he who bet he could have a man to preach
[1:24:18] something that you talked about before
[1:24:20] church
[1:24:22] he could lay on us injured men something
[1:24:24] that would be so phenomenal only he
[1:24:27] could do such a thing
[1:24:34] Lord Jesus notice this ministry of
[1:24:41] Melchizedek as it comes back on our Lord
[1:24:46] after his resurrection Oh
[1:24:50] watch how that he reveals himself to him
[1:24:54] under this name in Genesis 14 18
[1:24:56] Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth
[1:24:58] bread and wine it was the priest of the
[1:25:02] Most High God El Elyon which simply
[1:25:07] means the highest this is the first
[1:25:12] revelation of this name in the Canon of
[1:25:16] Scripture and was revealed after this
[1:25:19] servant had come through one of the
[1:25:21] hardest battles of his life this is the
[1:25:26] first time Abram has ever heard this
[1:25:28] name and who put it on him the ministry
[1:25:32] of the high priest would you notice this
[1:25:43] he meets this king of Sodom immediately
[1:25:50] he takes this new name to himself
[1:25:56] Genesis 14 19 a bush him and said
[1:25:59] blessed be Abram of the Most High God
[1:26:04] possessor of Hamelin sinner so notice
[1:26:08] the Ministry of high priest he wasn't
[1:26:12] sent to bless everybody but is sent to
[1:26:15] blessing those people that wouldn't give
[1:26:19] you a dime for though every sermon I've
[1:26:21] ever preached there's people that would
[1:26:23] not walk across the street to hear
[1:26:25] brother Daryl brother Joel or some of
[1:26:26] these I don't get nothing out of all
[1:26:28] they say what in the world are they
[1:26:29] talking about well I face the fact a
[1:26:31] long time ago
[1:26:32] sent everybody but if I can be sent to
[1:26:34] Abram and bless them I'm on a blessing
[1:26:36] this is part of who I am I'm here to
[1:26:39] bless the saints of God but your
[1:26:41] ministry don't bless me well maybe if
[1:26:43] God don't bless you sir to me Oh bless
[1:26:44] you through somebody else I want to
[1:26:46] bless those I'm not called to bless
[1:26:47] everybody in the bride I'm not called to
[1:26:49] pasture everybody in the bride praise
[1:26:51] the Lord but I want to bless those that
[1:26:53] I'm called to bless don't you and he
[1:26:57] must him Melchizedek now blessed Abram
[1:27:01] because this is part of his position
[1:27:04] glory to God and he said must be Abram
[1:27:09] of the Most High God and then he calls
[1:27:12] God who possessor of heavens and earth
[1:27:15] and blessed be the Most High God which
[1:27:18] hath delivered thine enemies into thy
[1:27:21] hands and he gave him ties now it was
[1:27:29] not remember Melchizedek pain ties to
[1:27:31] Abraham
[1:27:32] but Abraham ping ties to God I mean and
[1:27:41] while Abraham handed over the ties the
[1:27:45] words of God leave in his body God said
[1:27:53] I attribute you having
[1:28:05] if God could attribute Levi to paying
[1:28:09] tires at Abram you won't argue about
[1:28:10] that that's the Bible with the Lord
[1:28:17] somehow God made us to him after Abram
[1:29:10] says by the power of the Most High God I
[1:29:16] want nothing of your stardom now he had
[1:29:21] just heard this name but it had been put
[1:29:24] on him and in him and it become a part
[1:29:30] of the law so he's saying what milk has
[1:29:33] it except he had never heard this before
[1:29:38] that he was part of the Most High God
[1:29:41] I'd say he had a spell I am part of the
[1:29:44] most I am part of the Most High but I
[1:29:48] don't know why do you preach so much
[1:29:49] about the bottom part of him cause I
[1:29:51] wanted you to get it I want you to
[1:29:53] realize
[1:29:54] more than a monitor a part of the most
[1:29:58] under the old glory to God under the
[1:30:01] order of melchizedek I'm called to tell
[1:30:03] you you were more than a human a part of
[1:30:06] the Most High call notice to never
[1:30:17] Abraham rescinds the wealth of Sodom in
[1:30:24] chapter 14 the very next verse chapter
[1:30:28] 15 verse 1 after these things the word
[1:30:37] of the Lord came to Abram in a vision
[1:30:44] saying fear not Abram I am thy shield
[1:30:50] and my exceeding great this was not
[1:31:00] before he made his choice but after
[1:31:05] think of it
[1:31:07] our journey that begins so many many
[1:31:10] years ago with many of us when we had to
[1:31:13] refuse the kingdom we were born in we
[1:31:15] were born in the kingdom of beara and
[1:31:17] the kingdom of Sodom lost unregenerate
[1:31:22] but the Eagle scream come over us we've
[1:31:25] recognized the voice of Melchizedek but
[1:31:30] we're still making choices a lot to
[1:31:33] preach on this sometime the tale of two
[1:31:35] keys we're still making the choices
[1:31:38] because these two kings or now they
[1:31:41] don't know I'm us bearer we know a mess
[1:31:43] Satan he was the one anointing there he
[1:31:47] was the one that anointed him to say
[1:31:49] words that may be pulled on April's
[1:31:52] flesh God would not make him shoes he
[1:31:58] must choose but actually choose his
[1:32:00] brother Joe I did a battle
[1:32:03] to communion then God now says the word
[1:32:08] of the Lord come to Abram in a vision I
[1:32:12] am by great reward
[1:32:14] fear not Abram I am thy shield I am thy
[1:32:26] shield and my exceeding great let me
[1:32:36] close with this whose male character has
[1:32:39] 95 now the true revelation of
[1:32:43] Melchizedek comes into view what he was
[1:32:47] God the word before he became flesh God
[1:32:54] the word cuz he had to be no one else
[1:32:57] could be a mortal like you I father and
[1:33:00] mother you did to Jesus had father and
[1:33:04] mother but this man had no father or had
[1:33:09] no mother
[1:33:10] Jesus at a time he started this man did
[1:33:17] Jesus gave his life this man could
[1:33:23] because it was life it's the self same
[1:33:27] man all the time I hope God reveals it
[1:33:32] to you the self same person all the time
[1:33:35] notice his title king of righteousness
[1:33:37] now he'd be r72 king of righteousness
[1:33:40] came apiece his two kings watch Hebrews
[1:33:44] 72 king of righteousness also king of
[1:33:46] peace he's two kings there now since he
[1:33:49] has come in the flesh and received up
[1:33:53] his body in Revelation 21 16 he's called
[1:33:58] the King of Kings he's all three of them
[1:34:02] together King god-kings the Alpha knee
[1:34:06] King Jesus God don't you understand he
[1:34:11] was king God and eternal that's what
[1:34:13] they tell what he
[1:34:14] the king can he be coming to a tangible
[1:34:16] part they offer me and let it be stuck
[1:34:18] down down another attribute of God into
[1:34:20] the humanity King God keeps the offering
[1:34:23] King Jesus it's all met to suck soul
[1:34:30] body spirit all comes to make one I've
[1:34:37] got a soul a body in a spirit but I'm
[1:34:41] only one person
[1:34:42] King God Kings theophany King Jesus all
[1:34:46] meats and were the human temple called
[1:34:49] the Lord Jesus but God created this
[1:34:52] human temple in the realm of mortality
[1:34:54] and Jesus birthday now this is very
[1:35:01] strange because they don't have one nail
[1:35:07] you understand one day your birthdays
[1:35:10] will stop Alleluia
[1:35:15] older I get the less I like a mini half
[1:35:19] there Jesus that is in heaven no longer
[1:35:24] has a birthday because God changed that
[1:35:31] body into the realm of eternity and you
[1:35:36] cannot say about that body now
[1:35:38] it was born on a certain day one day
[1:35:45] mortality will be taken from yours
[1:35:47] birthdays will stop anniversaries will
[1:35:50] stop old age parties will stop nursing
[1:35:54] home care will stop when God will take
[1:35:57] your body into the Messianic Kingdom of
[1:36:01] eternal also he is the father he is the
[1:36:12] father which was the first Son and Holy
[1:36:16] Ghost the spirit king righteous
[1:36:20] the spirit attribute theophany king of
[1:36:25] peace theophany in first King of Kings
[1:36:33] same person gonna read just one more
[1:36:40] brothers that was look a Tesla but I
[1:36:43] know we've looked at this but I'm a call
[1:36:45] to priest after the order of melchizedek
[1:36:47] and I feel I've got to put his name now
[1:36:51] we see the attribute sons of his spirit
[1:36:53] have not yet entered into the word form
[1:36:56] body but a theophany this body is
[1:36:57] subject to the word and earnest waiting
[1:37:00] for the earnest change of the body now
[1:37:02] the difference between him and you as a
[1:37:04] son he was at the beginning the word
[1:37:08] Animorph a body he came in and lived in
[1:37:12] that in the person of Melchizedek
[1:37:17] so it was who Jesus was going to be
[1:37:20] before he becomes eases it was who Jesus
[1:37:26] was going to become to be before it
[1:37:29] becomes Jesus he become Melchizedek
[1:37:31] before it becomes Jesus well Hallows
[1:37:35] then Rider we never heard it because he
[1:37:41] became Jesus Christ Melchizedek was the
[1:37:45] priests but he became Jesus Christ no
[1:37:49] can you imagine him going straight from
[1:37:51] Melchizedek they attribute the Lord
[1:37:53] Jesus and the very next slide is about
[1:37:57] you now you bypass that but in that form
[1:38:06] he knowed all things and you never been
[1:38:08] able to know all things you come like
[1:38:09] Adam like me you become from the
[1:38:13] attribute to the flesh to be tempted but
[1:38:18] when this life is finished here
[1:38:19] if this others have enough will be this
[1:38:21] all will have one waiting that's where
[1:38:22] we go that is
[1:38:24] word then we can look back and see what
[1:38:30] we've done now we don't understand we
[1:38:34] have never become the word
[1:38:36] we'll just become the freshman oh but I
[1:38:39] love this but clearly it makes it clear
[1:38:41] you'll never be the word unless you will
[1:38:43] so thought at the beginning that proves
[1:38:46] oh my goodness that proves the
[1:38:48] predestination of God you can't be the
[1:38:52] word unless you're a salt you had to be
[1:38:56] in the thinking first but you see in
[1:38:57] order to stand temptation you had to
[1:39:00] bypass the theophany you had to come
[1:39:03] down here and flesh to be tempted by sin
[1:39:06] and then if you stand all the father's
[1:39:08] give them it will come to me and I raise
[1:39:10] him on the last day see you had to be
[1:39:13] first and then you see he come right
[1:39:18] down the regular line from attribute
[1:39:22] before the foundation of the world his
[1:39:23] name is from the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:39:24] then from that he become the word that's
[1:39:27] the awfully that could appear disappear
[1:39:28] then he become flesh return back again
[1:39:32] resurrected that same body and a
[1:39:35] glorified condition but you so do you
[1:39:42] all sink and you this listening to me do
[1:39:45] you think he's actually talking to a
[1:39:47] part of us when he's making these
[1:39:51] personal references but you is he
[1:39:53] speaking to angelic realms or is he
[1:39:55] speaking to humans there was something
[1:39:57] in them that's beyond what they see and
[1:39:59] understand but you bypassed the
[1:40:03] theophany and become flesh man so see
[1:40:11] notice he separates you from your
[1:40:13] theophany but he also separates you from
[1:40:16] your flesh man you are not the flesh
[1:40:21] prism that holds you
[1:40:23] you are someone else to be tempted by
[1:40:34] Satan and if this earth the Tabernacles
[1:40:35] dissolved we have one-way lists and
[1:40:37] brothers we have listened we have not
[1:40:40] yet the bodies of the look when this
[1:40:41] body receives the Spirit of God the
[1:40:43] immortal life inside of you
[1:40:45] it throws this body and subjection to
[1:40:47] God hallelujah he their spawn of God
[1:40:50] does not commit sin he cannot sin Romans
[1:40:52] 8:1 there's therefore now no
[1:40:53] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:40:55] Jesus that walk not after the flesh but
[1:40:57] after the spirit
[1:40:58] there you are see that throws your body
[1:41:01] subject you don't have to say well if I
[1:41:03] could just quit drinking get in Christ
[1:41:05] and it's all gone see because your body
[1:41:10] is subject to the spirit it's no more
[1:41:14] subject for the things of the world we
[1:41:18] don't have the power to say to berra
[1:41:21] i don't want what you offer because this
[1:41:24] does come on we're born in it we're
[1:41:29] still corrupt I'm not I'm at this right
[1:41:31] here
[1:41:31] but the power of Melchizedek living in
[1:41:35] our soul can say to berra
[1:41:37] and all his kingdom take your Sodom take
[1:41:41] your gifts take your popularity your
[1:41:44] pride your arrogance so on and so on and
[1:41:47] take it I don't see the end of you
[1:41:50] bearer and that's not who I am praise
[1:41:55] God
[1:41:56] oh praise the Lord oh how appreciate it
[1:42:01] today
[1:42:02] let's bow our heads together Lord Jesus
[1:42:09] Lord what a blessed wicked we've had
[1:42:14] Lord house thank you for making that's
[1:42:16] so real to me early this morning but
[1:42:20] what happened last night here in this
[1:42:21] service was the administration of the
[1:42:24] high priest Father God you're not just
[1:42:28] there in heaven when we're sick and
[1:42:30] afflicted and weary and down and going
[1:42:32] through things and you sent our late I
[1:42:35] relate I can understand
[1:42:37] but Lord even aus of the ministry if
[1:42:41] people can only see your ministry is
[1:42:44] still ongoing your ministry is still
[1:42:49] working today through the Ministry of
[1:42:52] God come in as you are feeling the needs
[1:42:56] of your people and the infirmities of
[1:42:58] your people and you'll place on their
[1:43:00] hearts and sometimes against their
[1:43:02] better judgment they don't understand
[1:43:03] why it may not make no sense to him or
[1:43:06] may seem so simple to him or whatever
[1:43:08] but it's the needs of the children of
[1:43:11] God
[1:43:11] calling on their high priest oh jesus oh
[1:43:15] Jesus help me
[1:43:16] Lord if you just speak to me Lord if you
[1:43:19] just give me something you look place it
[1:43:22] on a man of God's heart and he thinks oh
[1:43:25] my goodness oh my goodness brother Daryl
[1:43:28] told me before church he said brother
[1:43:30] Donnie I told sheriff I try to preach
[1:43:32] this to not build on it may not never
[1:43:33] want me to preach again and said well
[1:43:35] buddy wanna know what I'm not he began
[1:43:37] to tell me what you'd put on his harness
[1:43:39] what it sounds like to me it's exactly
[1:43:40] what we need
[1:43:41] but sometimes us as preachers we miss it
[1:43:45] ourselves because they're not even sure
[1:43:47] yet we follow that pulsation help us to
[1:43:51] always do it Lord because this is the
[1:43:53] priesthood of Melchizedek oh thank you
[1:43:58] Lord Jesus
[1:43:59] we worship you today father would you
[1:44:02] bring healing would you bring strength
[1:44:05] would you bring grace to your children
[1:44:08] today father those are very similar
[1:44:10] double stream the service those from
[1:44:12] different parts of the world that would
[1:44:13] go back and look at it Lord father God
[1:44:16] help us uh pray
[1:44:17] we need you Lord or Jesus our desire is
[1:44:21] to be able to help one another father I
[1:44:24] don't really need to say this for your
[1:44:25] sake but I said for the public's sake
[1:44:27] the only reason that we stream these
[1:44:31] services is for the benefit of others I
[1:44:33] get beaten whipped and thrashed and tore
[1:44:36] to pieces from people in our own ranks
[1:44:39] and people without how many times have I
[1:44:42] made up my mind I was going to tell
[1:44:44] their brothers take it down I'm sick of
[1:44:46] it I just can't take the burden of it no
[1:44:48] more
[1:44:49] and again an email or a text from France
[1:44:53] or Switzerland or Canada because I did
[1:44:57] not long ago of a preacher that was up
[1:44:59] in Canada that was just about at his
[1:45:01] breaking point
[1:45:02] but he streamed in on a Saturday night
[1:45:05] service and you the high priest had me
[1:45:09] to say things that was exactly what that
[1:45:11] brother needed so who should I follow
[1:45:14] people criticizers accusers or you I
[1:45:19] think I'll choose Melchizedek
[1:45:25] we worship your Lord God
