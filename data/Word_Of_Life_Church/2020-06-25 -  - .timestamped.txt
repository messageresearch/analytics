[6:29] [Music]
[6:35] to depend upon
[6:39] is the world
[6:44] wherever you are gather this evening
[6:46] let's bow our heads in prayer father we
[6:48] honor you we love you we adore you we
[6:50] thank you for everything that you are we
[6:53] thank you for everything that you have
[6:55] been and father we thank you for what
[6:57] you're going to beef so with that
[6:59] designation the Lord with those
[7:01] designations that lets us know that
[7:02] we're wrapped up in you we were wrapped
[7:04] up in you when we didn't know it we're
[7:06] wrapped up in you now and we will be
[7:07] wrapped up within you later father so as
[7:10] we gather tonight Lord in this service
[7:13] for this service we just ask that you
[7:15] just come and meet with your people and
[7:16] we heard requests of prayer in every
[7:19] home that's represented tonight that's
[7:20] that's tuned in there's needs there as
[7:23] well father and so as those hearts are
[7:26] beating and pulsating with those needs
[7:29] those desires we just ask that you would
[7:31] just manifest yourself in those homes Oh
[7:34] God for this is how we your people
[7:37] gathered long ago anyway in the homes
[7:39] and things so this isn't new to you
[7:41] father this isn't something that that
[7:43] that caught you by surprise so you can
[7:45] do as you've done before even here today
[7:48] even tonight Lord we look to you but
[7:50] there are members of the body that's
[7:52] hurting and I as I was sitting there
[7:53] just a moment ago couldn't help but to
[7:55] think the many many nights Lord and I
[7:57] had to get up out of bed for something
[7:59] go check on the children or whatever it
[8:01] may be father I would stub my toe on the
[8:04] bedpost and father it was nighttime and
[8:07] I couldn't cry out like I wanted to
[8:09] because I might wake someone up but Lord
[8:11] the the body was in need there was a
[8:14] member of the body in need and those
[8:15] these these hands reach down and grab
[8:18] that toe and ministered to the need of
[8:20] the toes so father may the members of
[8:23] the body reach out to those that are
[8:24] crying in this darkened world tonight we
[8:27] commit everything to you everything
[8:29] that's said and done in this service we
[8:32] as we submit to you bless and anoint our
[8:34] brother Lord use him the gift that you
[8:36] place within him to get out of the way
[8:38] father God and and speak to the needs of
[8:41] your people we we commit it all to you

[30:35] this building tonight as he is in your
[30:37] home making him the same yesterday today
[30:39] and forever if you have your Bibles to
[30:41] seem to turn with us to the book of
[30:42] Proverbs we want to read from chapter 3
[30:44] starting at verse 23 it's a very unusual
[30:48] text that Lord just spit it on our heart
[30:50] last night and we studied up late and in
[30:53] most of today and we distrusted to be a
[30:55] blessing to use just a simple little
[30:57] thought that's really the only kind that
[31:00] I can bring and I was just thinking to
[31:02] I can preach like these brothers could
[31:03] sing would certainly have some church
[31:05] too not a man that just wonderful ha
[31:07] just the songs and the music that stirs
[31:10] our heart but anyhow we want to do what
[31:11] we can do and be what Lord has made us
[31:13] to be and we trusted to be a blessing to
[31:15] you tonight we want to read now from
[31:17] proverbs chapter 3 starting at verse 23
[31:20] and may the Lord richly bless you
[31:22] whatever you're facing tonight whatever
[31:24] I want you to look to him and believe
[31:26] that even before this service is over he
[31:28] can do a miracle in your life that's
[31:30] just the kind of God that I serve amen
[31:34] proverbs 3:23 the Bible says this then
[31:37] shut up then shalt thou walk in thy way
[31:41] safely and thy foot shall not stumble
[31:45] and when thou liest down they shall not
[31:48] be afraid
[31:49] yay thou shalt lie down and thy sleep
[31:53] shall be sweet be not afraid of sudden
[31:57] fear neither of the desolation of the
[32:01] wicked when it cometh notice it is
[32:04] coming when it cometh not if it cometh
[32:08] but when it cometh Amen be not afraid of
[32:11] the sudden fear neither of the
[32:13] desolation of the wicked when it cometh
[32:15] Amen
[32:16] for the Lord oh I love this right here
[32:18] for the Lord shall be thy confidence and
[32:22] shall keep thy foot from being taken
[32:26] amen let us bow our heads I want to
[32:28] speak to you for just a few minutes this
[32:29] evening on when thou liest down to sleep
[32:33] o Lord father we're just so grateful for
[32:43] your presence that we feel here Lord no
[32:48] wonder God that you are our God Lord as
[32:54] I was thinking of these scriptures it
[32:56] reminds me of the prayer we prayed as a
[33:00] child now I lay me down to sleep
[33:05] lord I never want to get away from bad
[33:11] Lord to come to you with that childlike
[33:15] faith
[33:16] simply just to believe your word Lord
[33:19] that they don't have to be explained to
[33:22] me and figured out Lord but I can
[33:24] believe it and be happy in it simply
[33:27] because you said it Lord knowing your
[33:30] word cannot fail the Lord I pray for
[33:33] your children tonight Lord those dear
[33:36] god that's afflicted with the virus may
[33:39] your presence just go to him Lord and
[33:41] strengthen them god father we know that
[33:44] even while were yet praying the Holy
[33:46] Spirit can remove every symptom every
[33:49] affliction every sign of this evil Lord
[33:53] father we pray for different ones that
[33:55] come to our mind brother Wade Lord and
[33:58] may you touch his body God that he could
[34:01] swallow it enjoy his food Lord we pray

[34:06] tonight sister Lane Lord you see her
[34:09] need to not others Lord that comes to
[34:11] our minds God may your spirit move upon
[34:13] them we pray and Lord may you just come
[34:16] and take this simple thought Lord God
[34:19] may we be able to relay it to the people
[34:21] as we saw the Lord as we looked at it
[34:24] dear God Lord may it bring peace to
[34:27] their hearts tonight we pray Lord that
[34:29] we can just shut the door and let the
[34:32] storm pass by because we're safe and
[34:35] secure in your arms
[34:36] we love you tonight Lord we commit this
[34:39] service into your hands for your glory
[34:40] for we ask these things in Jesus name
[34:43] and the bride says it may God bless you
[34:46] may be seated this evening amen
[34:50] you know it always amazes me that we
[34:54] serve a god that is so great that is so
[34:58] awesome that he created the universes
[35:01] and billions of Oh billions of stars a
[35:04] God so great that he knows all things
[35:08] the Prophet said he knows every time
[35:11] that Annett my lord I can barely see in
[35:14] that and yet our God knows every time
[35:18] that an at-bat sits I the puppet said he
[35:21] knows every being where he goes
[35:23] into the comb to get his honey hook that
[35:29] blows we can't even comprehend that

[37:33] you can sleep at night do you believe
[37:37] the Lord Jesus is going to give you
[37:39] sleep from now on not a brain tumor not
[37:44] a life-threatening disease
[37:46] the woman had trouble sleeping and God
[37:49] anointed His Prophet to call it out and
[37:53] said do you believe he's going to give
[37:55] you sleep from now on you've not been
[37:57] able to sleep but after tonight you're
[37:59] going to be able to sleep that you might
[38:03] know that I'm his prophet or his servant

[38:10] is will you believe it the arthritis
[38:12] will go from you sir you can go home now
[38:14] and be well and be a happy family
[38:19] a happy family because the husband was
[38:25] delivered of arthritis and the woman was
[38:27] delivered of insomnia the inability to
[38:31] sleep why would he do that because you
[38:39] see brother branham mentioned can't
[38:41] sleep 38 times he put those two words
[38:45] together can't sleep and out of the 38
[38:49] times that the prophet mentioned it 15
[38:52] different times was in discernment and

[40:49] them a nervous condition you can't sleep
[40:51] you're taking powders because I want you
[40:53] to understand one of Satan's tactics is
[40:56] to bind people with sickness and with
[40:59] fear and you'll find a lot of times the
[41:01] sickness is in our body it is a result
[41:04] of fear our spirit gets nervous our body
[41:08] gets upset your stomach gets upset it
[41:10] causes an ulcer many of the sickness of
[41:13] all goes back to nervous conditions in
[41:15] fear because the world of Satan's
[41:18] tactics he uses the greatest is fear
[41:20] Illinois no woman that's possessed with
[41:23] the demon to speak like a man to cause
[41:25] fear because that's what he operates in
[41:30] the realm of fear amen
[41:33] Oh hallelujah stew bound the people that
[41:36] fear the Prophet said now you're moving
[41:37] on you're the father you're moving
[41:39] you're showing signs and wonders the
[41:40] great Atomic Age is here nations against
[41:43] nations kingdoms up against kingdoms
[41:45] spirits fighting against spirits the
[41:49] people are nervous you said it would be
[41:51] fear up on the earth perplexity of time
[41:53] the stress between nations men's hearts
[41:56] failing for
[41:59] what a dig that we're living in mitts
[42:02] hearts failing them for fear perplexed
[42:03] of time distressed between nations the
[42:05] Earth's getting so nervous till it's
[42:08] burst and forth earthquakes everywhere
[42:11] Jesus said it would be that way there'd
[42:14] be earthquakes in diverse places what's
[42:16] the matter the earth knows she's doomed
[42:20] she's nervous the world's nervous but
[42:24] the church the church is rising in the
[42:28] gospel ducked away with security Oh an
[42:34] internal time perplexed the time nervous
[42:37] time Oh hallelujah the bride it's tucked
[42:40] away its security she is secured oh that
[42:45] my father had given me will come and no
[42:48] man can them out of my head that's
[42:51] security whoo hallelujah were not in
[42:56] this pocket we're not in a safe when I
[42:58] don't know what we are in his hands amen
[43:01] brother secured in the time of trouble
[43:04] the hour of gross darkness when gross
[43:08] darkness would cover the earth and gross
[43:10] darkness would cover the people because
[43:13] the children of the world walk in
[43:16] darkness they walk at nighttime they
[43:19] love darkness the Bible said men people
[43:22] loved darkness more than they do liked
[43:24] because the light would manifest their
[43:28] deeds a man that's when the cockroaches
[43:32] and the let's when all those things
[43:34] crawl around is in the darkness but turn
[43:36] the light on and watch them flee but in
[43:40] a time of gross darkness darkness on the
[43:42] land darkness on the people and the
[43:45] children look darkness the people loved
[43:47] darkness more than they love light when
[43:51] the spiritual darkness gets upon the
[43:53] earth like that then it's the time for
[43:55] the enemy to attack we're at that hour
[43:59] of gross darkness you know it sure
[44:01] showed me a video clip here not long ago
[44:03] of a river that was flooded out of its
[44:05] banks and the river out of its banks it
[44:08] struck a house and he destroyed the
[44:10] house
[44:10] broke it up and washed it away and
[44:14] that's exactly where Satan is tonight
[44:17] the spiritual darkness upon the earth
[44:18] has opened up the floodgates to allow
[44:21] the god of this evil age to unleash his
[44:24] destruction destruction upon the
[44:28] communities upon our government about
[44:30] our homes upon our families
[44:32] Satan is like a flood a raging river of
[44:34] water destroying everything that in its
[44:37] path have the people under a spirit of
[44:40] destruction because the puppet said God
[44:42] cannot bring destruction to the people
[44:45] or under the spirit of it that's why
[44:48] they're destroying their bodies that's
[44:49] why they destroy everything that they
[44:51] touch
[44:55] Satan is riding his horse he Satan has
[44:59] built his house now he's just
[45:00] wallpapering it this is the world that's
[45:05] around us as we know it today
[45:07] under a spirit of destruction Saint John
[45:09] 10:10 says that this way the thief
[45:12] cometh not but for to steal had to kill
[45:15] and to destroy he wants to steal your
[45:17] joy he wants to steal your peace he will
[45:19] store robbed you of every deadly
[45:21] blessing but I say let's not let him
[45:24] tonight
[45:24] God gave me joy God gave me peace
[45:28] God gave me healing God gave me
[45:30] deliverance that's the devil robbed us
[45:33] of none of it hey man he wants to steal
[45:38] your joy steal your peace Rob you've
[45:40] ever addicted blessing that Jesus died
[45:43] at Calvary for to secure for you we're
[45:45] living in a time when people are scared
[45:48] to death their nerves are on edge they
[45:51] can't sleep they can't eat depressed
[45:53] worried you sit on the people's faces at
[45:56] Walmart you see it at the red light you
[45:58] look at the VIPs almost like they're in
[46:00] a stoop it's almost like they don't even
[46:02] see they're in their own world because
[46:05] Satan has isolated the people isolated
[46:07] because we don't talk no more we got our
[46:10] phones they talk for us people are
[46:12] isolated don't you see Satan's
[46:14] this tactic has always been to divide
[46:16] and conquer
[46:17] divide and conquer you so you're
[46:22] painting the dark picture but that's
[46:23] what we're after is people are scared
[46:28] depressed worried they're tired the
[46:30] Restless that can't sleep they can't
[46:32] rest
[46:33] their minds are somebody told me the
[46:35] other day said I was up all night my
[46:37] mind was just racing I couldn't quit

[48:38] the house I fear a bond to the markets
[48:41] fear of home invasions fear of riots
[48:47] fear of mobs fear everything is fear
[48:55] things happiness that people never
[48:58] thought people who think they're in
[49:00] control of their lives and all of a
[49:01] sudden things hit us that we didn't
[49:04] think it's supposed to be that way you
[49:05] know 2020 supposed to be like 19 we come
[49:07] to church three times a week we play
[49:09] volleyball after church on Sunday and
[49:11] all of a sudden it ain't like that no
[49:14] more
[49:14] all of a sudden it's changed all of a
[49:18] sudden the pews are taped and were
[49:19] isolated one from the other things
[49:25] happen that people didn't expect to get
[49:29] scared things begin to go sideways here
[49:34] he's supposed to be like I work God's
[49:37] people for heaven's sakes
[49:38] we followed the message but I was
[49:43] thinking about God bringing Israel to
[49:45] the promised land they had a prophet
[49:47] they had a pillar of fire they were
[49:48] coming out of bondage sound familiar and
[49:51] they were after Kadesh Barnea they had
[49:54] not been brought through many trials
[49:56] they had seen the hand of God a very
[50:00] beautiful picture of us 12 spies were
[50:07] sent to spy out the land I believe if my
[50:10] memory serves me like 40 days and they
[50:14] come back they come back packing a huge
[50:18] bundle grace takes two I'm just said my
[50:22] god is that a great vine see that's just
[50:23] one bunch that's how big they are they
[50:27] came back with evidence they came back
[50:30] with evidence
[50:31] that the land was exactly the way God
[50:33] said but 10 of them out of the 12 10 of
[50:39] them come back I said all yes like God
[50:44] said but but it's too hard it's too
[50:52] great of a place it's impossible that
[50:55] God walls they've got armies
[50:57] they've got cities that are well trained
[51:00] they're educated they're smart and we
[51:05] really you know as we look like
[51:07] grasshoppers and because we thought we
[51:09] were grasshoppers that's the way they
[51:10] perceived us
[51:13] we're a failure we can't do it well now
[51:16] God said it's a laugh oh yeah that's the
[51:18] grace but I'm trying to tell you you're
[51:20] not listening look at me focus those
[51:23] giants there they're scary they're big
[51:26] they're mean they've got tattoos it's
[51:34] impossible God brought us this far and
[51:37] we can't go no further and Caleb Joshua
[51:43] maybe your old man he stood up he said
[51:45] that's nonsense what more than able to
[51:49] take the land
[51:50] get me my mountain oh he's a quack he
[51:57] went in the alley well they're property
[51:59] you're gonna get get away from him we're
[52:02] trying to tell you there's giants in the
[52:04] land don't listen to em there's a bunch
[52:06] of hopped up faith 10 against two they
[52:11] were all numbers and that mob mentality
[52:15] you get a mob and get them in the
[52:17] direction they'll do a lot of damage a
[52:19] mob mentality tend against - it wasn't
[52:23] long till it spread throughout the
[52:27] entire camp how fast bad news travels
[52:39] and it's something somebody can get
[52:41] healed all I ever hear about somebody
[52:43] break a leg everybody hears about it how
[52:45] fast bad news travels the minute when it
[52:50] said we're not able to go up against
[52:52] these people that's stronger than we
[52:54] and they brought an evil report to the
[52:56] land that they searched out to the
[52:58] children of Israel say in the land which
[52:59] we have go to searches the land that
[53:01] eateth up the inhabitants thereof and
[53:04] all the people we saw an army and a
[53:05] great statue and all the congregation
[53:08] look how fast this fear went through the
[53:13] church the Bible said all the
[53:17] congregation except for two as far as I
[53:20] know all the congregation lifted up
[53:23] their voice and cried and the people
[53:26] wept that night they were no sleeping in
[53:31] Israel that night their fear produced
[53:37] insomnia the nervous condition the
[53:40] report that they believed changed their
[53:43] whole attitude changed their whole
[53:44] atmosphere and they went from a people
[53:47] of God's people who had saw miracles and
[53:49] wonders and they become a people that
[53:51] were scared to death what are we going
[53:54] to do and they cried and they wailed and
[53:58] every time they take a breath to cry
[53:59] again they heard somebody snoring you
[54:03] know who it was capable
[54:10] that was no sleep in the camp because
[54:13] the report caused him to lose confidence
[54:15] in the god that gave him the promise but
[54:19] kind of never lost his faith he just
[54:21] laid down and his sleep was sweet cousin
[54:26] said I'll tell you one day I'm gonna
[54:27] sleep about eight hours and then we'll
[54:29] get up in the morning and I'm going to
[54:30] start with my sword now I'm gonna go get
[54:33] my Mountain now what made Caleb so sure
[54:39] when the opposition was so great God
[54:44] brother you're not listening you don't
[54:45] know how bad this thing is it's
[54:47] spreading throughout the message all
[54:48] kinds of churches people getting
[54:49] infected oh my lord
[54:51] you just don't realize how bad it is but
[54:55] look at Caleb he never catered to that
[54:58] fear he never even entertained it what
[55:03] make Caleb's is sure what the opposition
[55:05] was so great it's according to what you
[55:08] look at it's according to what you take
[55:10] care it's according to what you believe
[55:12] in what you hear Caleb was looking at
[55:15] the promise of God his confidence was in
[55:18] God the other kids were looking at their
[55:22] circumstances if you go to looking at
[55:24] your circumstances or look what's around
[55:26] you you're sure to fail you must never
[55:30] look at what's around you never look at
[55:33] what's around you look at the promise
[55:38] that's where Eve made her fatal mistake
[55:41] Satan come along with this theology and
[55:44] she mixes theology with what God gave
[55:47] her and she gave it to Adam and it
[55:50] caused a hybrid faith you won't have her
[55:55] faith will do nothing well I believe but
[56:00] hybrid faith commotions
[56:03] well I believe that the doctor said
[56:05] hybrid faith hybrid faith cannot produce
[56:08] life but faith in God's Word the doctor
[56:11] may say you're a double tensor but faith
[56:13] in God's Word can cause that to dissolve
[56:16] out of your body
[56:17] I've seen God do it I know he's able to
[56:21] do it amen she mixed it gave it to hi
[56:28] Adam a hybrid faith that's what the
[56:30] church has got today the so-called
[56:31] Church a hybrid faith it's mixed with
[56:34] fear and doubt and frustration are you
[56:40] hearing me tonight so if you've got four
[56:42] well I believe I believe the message but
[56:44] if you've got fear and doubt and
[56:45] frustration
[56:45] you've got hybrid faith hybrid faith is
[56:50] mixed with fear doubt frustration or
[56:54] brother I thought you said fear and
[56:55] faith don't mix fear and faith don't mix
[56:57] but hybrid faith and fear does mix
[56:59] there's splits with hybrid faith and
[57:01] pure faith hallelujah amen amen it's
[57:07] frustration if it was genuine faith
[57:08] Taylor continued on faith it wouldn't
[57:11] move when God says anything it'll be
[57:14] that way if God says it'll be that way
[57:16] the Prophet said if God said George
[57:18] Washington what's going to get up in
[57:20] five minutes I'd say get him a chair so
[57:22] he could shut down when he gets up
[57:23] because God does not lie
[57:28] we're just who's recovering from the
[57:30] from the accident or a woman from the
[57:32] Institute's coming to call me said mr.
[57:33] Ward can I talk to you I said yes ma'am
[57:35] said this is not about Jessica said it's
[57:36] about someone else I said yes ma'am she
[57:39] said there's a boy that we've got a
[57:40] class that he he got choked on a hot dog
[57:43] had sprain damage so he's not able to
[57:46] speak said his mama said they're
[57:48] Christians like you are they're
[57:49] Christians his father's a pastor also
[57:52] said his boys mother's telling everybody
[57:54] that God spoke to her and said on a
[57:56] certain date her boy will speak I said
[57:59] yes ma'am she said with mr. Ward here's
[58:01] what I want to ask you said if that's
[58:03] just a few days away and from what I can
[58:06] see there is no way that boy can speak
[58:11] and she said if he don't speak mr. Ward
[58:14] she was such a nice lady she was so
[58:16] concerned she said I'm so afraid if that
[58:18] boy don't speak it will crush that woman
[58:22] because she's told everybody that God
[58:25] said so I said well ma'am I am NOT a
[58:29] smart person
[58:30] but there's one thing I do know if God
[58:32] said the boy will speak it maybe one
[58:34] second before that time expires but that
[58:37] boy will speak because God does not lie
[58:40] now if the woman got an impression or
[58:42] thought not said that then that's
[58:43] something else but if God said the boy
[58:45] will talk he will talk because God does
[58:48] not live I'm so glad my confidence isn't
[58:53] that kind of God tonight not a
[58:55] wishy-washy God that spins a will but a
[58:57] God who speaks it and confirms it and
[59:00] backs it up and manifest it to his
[59:02] people
[59:03] amen amen
[59:06] Oh hallelujah genuine faith wouldn't
[59:10] move but she mixed it up with what Satan
[59:12] gave her turned it together said here it
[59:14] is you see Satan wants you to see the
[59:17] problem but not the answer he wants you
[59:19] to see the symptom but not the healing
[59:21] he wants you to see the chaos but not
[59:23] the calm he wants you to see the storm
[59:25] but not the rainbow the darkness but not
[59:28] the light but I say to you don't see the
[59:31] problem see the answer don't look at the
[59:35] symptom as long as you look at that arm
[59:37] as long as you look at that throat
[59:38] you'll never be able to swallow don't
[59:40] look to that look to that either a my
[59:42] head so nervous Said's what is it the
[59:46] Prophet said the churches are in an
[59:48] erotic age every church is proselyte in
[59:50] pulling and fussing and steward so
[59:52] neurotic aids the world in chaos but I
[59:55] say stand still God's calling his church
[59:58] to halt see stand still don't be jumping
[1:00:00] around running around not knowing what

[1:00:10] sure of your experience be sure of who
[1:00:12] you are and stand on it I'm not a
[1:00:16] Christian because I feel like it I'm a
[1:00:18] Christian because I met God's
[1:00:19] requirements amen amen amen be confident
[1:00:23] the one who gave the promise had to give
[1:00:27] a solemn warning to the church stand
[1:00:29] still God always commands to stand still
[1:00:31] before he does anything stand still and
[1:00:33] see the promises of God God doesn't make
[1:00:35] a promise that he can't keep God will
[1:00:37] bankrupt heaven before he'll let one
[1:00:40] promise of his word fail
[1:00:42] Oh hallelujah tonight we have a word
[1:00:45] from the Lord amen

[1:00:49] told us this time would be he told us
[1:00:51] what to look for

[1:00:55] did he not make us aware for the signs
[1:00:58] and the times in the hours that were
[1:01:00] living in is to take none of us by
[1:01:02] surprise he said these things would come
[1:01:04] men's hearts would sell for fear in a
[1:01:07] day of fear it's not something that's
[1:01:09] coming in here a man told us what to
[1:01:14] look for he said when these things begin

[1:01:45] are the seals have been open to reveal
[1:01:47] to us who we are where we come from what
[1:01:49] our position is the sons and daughters

[1:13:03] would be a cat 5 hurricane no doubt a
[1:13:05] major storm knowing the cells would be
[1:13:07] torn no the boat would fill with water
[1:13:09] knowing that the sciples would be
[1:13:11] frenetic and woods filled with fear
[1:13:13] screaming and running around he knew
[1:13:15] every bit of that because he was the
[1:13:17] word yet what did he do he laid down and
[1:13:22] he went to sleep because the word said
[1:13:27] with all the hair stem that shall not be
[1:13:31] afraid sleep sweet he just laid down and

[1:14:02] sweet because he knew who he was and he
[1:14:05] had confidence if the God who made him
[1:14:08] that that he would pass to the other
[1:14:10] side because the Son of God had spoke
[1:14:13] the word who were the son of God Bob

[1:16:37] to be disrespectful but are you sure
[1:16:41] What did he say God opened the boy's
[1:16:45] eyes and I say to you didn't I
[1:16:53] hole in our weakness and we may be

[1:17:12] my heart shall not fear though this war
[1:17:14] shall rise against me and this will I be
[1:17:17] confident one thing about the side of
[1:17:19] the Lord that I will seek after that I
[1:17:21] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[1:17:24] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[1:17:26] of the Lord to enquire in his temple for
[1:17:29] in the time of trouble he shall hide me
[1:17:32] in his pavilion in the secret of his
[1:17:33] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[1:17:36] me upon a rock Philippians 1:6 says be
[1:17:41] confident being confident of this very
[1:17:44] thing that he was begun a good work in
[1:17:48] you will perform it until the day of
[1:17:50] Jesus Christ he never brought us this
[1:17:55] far to leave us
[1:17:57] he never told us to swim to let us
[1:17:59] drowned
[1:18:00] he never umbilical nests to move away
[1:18:02] and he never lifted us up to let us down
[1:18:07] he never created us to forget us he
[1:18:11] created us for himself
[1:18:16] [Laughter]
[1:18:30] that's why Satan hates us what he wants
[1:18:33] to destroy what God created for himself
[1:18:38] it was anything he ever asked for he
[1:18:42] didn't have a car he didn't have a
[1:18:43] chariot he didn't help us he didn't have
[1:18:46] more than one change of clothes as far
[1:18:47] as I know but he never asked God for a
[1:18:49] new suit to preach it he never asked God
[1:18:51] for a new tractor idea he never asked
[1:18:53] God for a good out the only thing he
[1:18:55] ever ask the Father for was both foolish
[1:19:03] be a confident of this very thing he
[1:19:07] that started the hook I've never done it
[1:19:11] myself but you never did you you was
[1:19:14] looking for you he come looking for us
[1:19:17] we wasn't trying to find Elijah
[1:19:19] God sent Elijah to find us a bird being
[1:19:24] competent in this very thing that he who
[1:19:26] started the work in us will perform it
[1:19:29] until the day of Jesus Christ like Ruth
[1:19:33] like Ruth were arrested we're just
[1:19:38] resting waiting on his Lord he finished
[1:19:42] the work at Calvary but before he can
[1:19:44] come and take us to his home he goes
[1:19:47] home first to prepare a place for us so
[1:19:53] we're just resting in sleep sweet sleep
[1:19:57] resting relaxing remember the prophet of
[1:20:02] God said under the Seventh Seal it's
[1:20:04] laxing time why because the open of the
[1:20:09] word reveals to us who we are brother
[1:20:10] Joe I don't have to guess no war I know
[1:20:12] I come from God I know I go back to God
[1:20:15] I know that my DNA is God's DNA and I

[1:22:20] drunken still on him he wakes up the
[1:22:22] next morning haunted nightmares troubled
[1:22:25] mind and you call that peace that's no
[1:22:29] peace that's the world today trouble
[1:22:36] sleep nightmares who died long ago
[1:22:41] someone I think it was in this church
[1:22:43] somewhere I was preaching I believe it
[1:22:44] was in they don't matter who it was that
[1:22:46] somebody come to me with having
[1:22:47] nightmare said I have nightmares at
[1:22:49] night I said you don't never have to
[1:22:51] have another one you let your nightmares
[1:22:54] right here take good dreams and go back
[1:22:57] with them you have to live that way
[1:23:03] troubled Minds can't rest can't stop
[1:23:06] thinking about what's going on he never
[1:23:08] wanted us to live that way that's not
[1:23:11] the way he wants us to live I give you
[1:23:14] peace not as the world giveth give unto
[1:23:17] thee the man I'm coming to a close a man
[1:23:22] may not have a pillar to press his head
[1:23:24] to oh I love this right here a man may
[1:23:28] not even have a pill at the press's head
[1:23:30] - he may not even own a decent pair of
[1:23:32] shoes or be able to have a decent meal
[1:23:35] in his house but if God reigns in his
[1:23:38] heart he can go to bed happy and he
[1:23:43] wakes up happy it's a lasting peace
[1:23:48] because he's got confidence that God
[1:23:51] told David I've never seen the righteous
[1:23:54] forsaken nor his seed
[1:23:57] beggin for bread so when I have meat of
[1:24:00] it he will provide it for me
[1:24:04] so troubalert you'll give it to us not
[1:24:07] when we think we need it but when he
[1:24:11] knows it'll be right old if you go to
[1:24:20] bed happy and he wakes up happy it's a
[1:24:23] lasting peace it's something that God
[1:24:25] does
[1:24:26] it's our confidence in our Lord that
[1:24:31] he'll never leave us nor will he forsake
[1:24:34] us brother sister he said brother Harry
