the hope of the church and this hour was the coming of the lord well if he said that 1964 you wonder what it is now in 2024 it ought to be the very hope of what we live for every day of our life shouldn't it praise the Lord let us U read in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 if you would tonight I guess we're still on brother Joe brother Rob for the question answers tomorrow night at 7 7:00 okay um 1 Corinthians chapter 12 verse 24 for our comely Parts have no need but God has tempered the body together tempered to mix together co-mingle to unite cause several parts to combine into an organic structure which is the body to unite one thing to another but God has tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked if the lacking Parts could be able to accept that how smooth everything would truly be now Paul's taking the Natural Body the anatomy of the human body and running a parallel to the spiritual body of Christ notice in verse 25 that there should be no Schism division rent metaphorically it's a division or A dissension now the reason that God would give more abundant honor to the part which is uncomely is to equal out so that it wouldn't cause Schism or division in the body in other words no big eyes and little use and this one's really important and this one sort of kind of important and that one ain't important but if we could realize that God places them there actually diversity to me expresses the Great greatness of God we will always have diversity you say in heaven absolutely In Heaven There Will Be degrees in heaven you didn't know that well the prophet said that word for word just what I told you degrees in heaven but you see the part about degrees that bothers us now will not be there there will be degrees in heaven there always has been and always will be and all of that in heaven the part that that bothers humans about it now will be missing so everybody will be fine with it I guarantee I I could ask you tonight what do you think the ideal temperature will be in heaven and some of you all are at a very dangerous time in your life right now temperature wise I'm talking about and some of you would probably think oh dear God I hope it's at least 58 58 others of You Are pass that time in your life and you're hoping it's going to be 75 and some of you thinking it's going to be 80 me and Carol was talking about it yesterday and I told you know the thing of it is whatever it's going to be it'll be absolutely perfect and what's amazing is nobody will complain wow forget the gates of pearl forget streets of gold there'll be nobody complaining nobody arguing nobody debating nobody fussing won't that be awesome it's almost more than what we can imagine but I really believe that there can be this Unity of the spirit of God and among the people before we get there let's read this scripture we Clos that with last Wednesday night Romans 16:17 now beseech you Brethren mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned and avoid them no doubt Paul hated and absolutely hated to have to deal with these things Corinthian Church was a was a church that was had so many issues and problems but in reality if it had not have been there and God never caused him but God took the problems in the Corinthian Church and if it had not been for Paul dealing with them in that church we would not have some of these things through the entire New Testament he doesn't mention the Ephesian church galatian church church at Philippi church at thessalonica it's not mentioned anywhere else so God didn't cause it but God took it and caused this Apostle to be able to write things that's still an answer to a lot of the things we deal with today a't that wonderful we're going to pray please pray for juli and Ivy he passed out at work today went to the ER and is now home they did test but didn't find anything so continue to pray for him how many else has a need a request T that on your heart before the Lord Heavenly Father we love you so much we're so thankful Lord Jesus what I just spoke about there for a moment Lord what a perfect place lays before us this world even in its Fallen state is an awesome place to live it can be so beautiful the flowers the trees the animals all the things that you made the heavens the constellations the Stars the universe what an awesome world you have made so we know it's not because of the lack of Beauty and the lack of the hand of the Creator but it's the sin of man dear God how we long for the day when it will be fully redeemed father that all the things that trouble us will be taken away Lord Jesus May every one of us be ready for that hour father we pray for brother Julian tonight that you'd be mindful of him Lord you see what happened to him today and we're praying father there'll be no evil that will come of this you saw the hands that were uplifted signifying different types of needs and requests would you be mindful of them I pray father that you'd help me to get out of the way father speak through me tonight in the name of Jesus we ask and the Saints said said amen God bless you you may be seated read with me now again if you would back in in 1 Corinthians where Paul goes on to say about the body 1 Corinthians 12:26 and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members Rejoice with it now whenever we look at this and we think of what a miraculous thing that that can be that God by a Unity that is beyond any human human Unity could ever produce now we'll take our church tonight we'll use it as an example so we have people from different cultures different backgrounds different ethnicities different racial backgrounds and all that from different religious backgrounds even and yet if God could be able to take each of us and bring us to a place that we would be as they were in the day of Pentecost in that one Accord and with the one mind which was given to us by the Lord what a great thing God can do well then you multiply that by hundreds and thousands of churches that are around the world made up just like ours some of them larger some of them smaller but coming from different parts of the the Earth different religious backgrounds different natural backgrounds and all of that affects who we are so some of us if you'd get in our vehicles after church and some of you would resume the music you were listen to on your way to church some of you it's going to be country gospel some of it it's going to be maybe a little bit more of a modern flare some of you might have a little bit of classical some of you ain't going to have none because you don't care for music no way so can you imagine now you're bring all them people together and you've got all these musicians and their makeup is different song leaders are different special singers are different and then you will sit there and well I really like hearing brother so and so and I really like hearing sister so and so because the style they sing I just like that so well but you know what God made every one of us to be just a little bit different and when we can move beyond our own personal taste well I like this and I like that but so do the other people sitting behind you they have their own life and the ones in front of you and maybe even the one sitting beside you they have their own life so they like a preacher that preaches a certain way and others say I can't understand him he talks too fast um and others say he takes so long to say it come on man say it get it out spit it out and others say Oh Glory to God I just like somebody in the middle and you think how in the world could it ever be that God would bring us all together but he does and he will even greater because this is what he wants to do to bring that unity in such a place don't you understand why Unity is such an important thing to God because it's something the kingdom of Hell will never achieve Satan can have an element of political Unity until you cross your politics and then they fall apart and they can have a religious unity to a certain degree God will produce a unity in his body that the kingdom of Hell cannot even come close to producing ain't that wonderful and God can be able to make people that would be so different from one another but notice how Paul says this that whether one member suffer all the me members suffer with it now that could be a a more of an agreeable tone maybe than what the latter part of this verse would say or one member be honored now I found it as being a pastor that a lot of times sickness and trouble and heartache and despair and sadness and things like that can many times bring people closer together then honor will so if one person is honored in the church especially if it's a preacher or one is more gifted or one is getting more recognition how many people get jealous of people's suffering any of y'all ever got jealous of somebody having a migraine you ever get jealous of anybody having a kidney stone well I tell you right now if you do it's a sign you ain't never had one you ever get jealous of anybody having back paint well shoot I heard this down in their back that makes me so jealous I I can't stand it I'm just wanting that so bad ain't it amazing we don't get jealous of that we don't get jealous of Trials we don't get jealous of testing but we do get jealous of honor and praise and you know one being lifted up but a real true unity in the body can treat honor with the same love and respect and the exact same channel as it can if you hear that brother's sister is down in their back or they're having a physical issue and you oh God oh God please please help them why are we more touched with sadness why are we more touched with pain than we would be with honor is't that something because I'll tell you what it was that that caused Satan's fall in the beginning it was not that he was jealous of God in the sense of God well he knew he couldn't make stars and he knew couldn't create a universe but he wanted to be like him so he said in his heart I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I want you to notice he never said I'll exalt my stars above the stars of God he didn't have none and couldn't make none how come he didn't say I'll exalt my Earth above God's Earth he didn't have an earth so he had to take what God made but he did have a strong so what he wanted to do was exalt himself and that's where a lot of this pride and all this sort of thing comes from and jealousy boy I don't know why I'm preaching on this this ain't even in my notes tonight I guess I probably should follow it though you reckon and people wanting recognition of this and that and the other and you find jealousy can be so hard I love the way this early church writer maybe you've never heard of his name before costum costum said said an early church writer when a thorn enters the hill the whole body feels it and is concerned the back bends the belly and the thighs contract now listen at the inside Brothers you don't have it so don't don't look for it uh the back will bend so a thorn enters the hill and whenever it does the bat will be Bend well the back can't bend and the thighs and the belly try to go against them so what do they do this bends which pulls the muscles in your back and these here will contract so they are tightening up in order to allow the back to bend what good would it do for the back to try to bend if these muscles just say I ain't doing it I ain't doing it I ain't doing it I get tired of doing that I get tired of doing that but but what does it do the brain sends the command to the back and the muscles in the back begin to expand and these muscles here from the same control tower in the brain will cause them to be able to contract together in order to allow you to bend now it said the back is concerned and the back will bend the belly and the thighs contract the hands come forward now look at what's happening all instantaneously one working with the other so the back will bend the belly muscles and all that will contract which allows the Torso to bend over and then the hands will begin to reach forward what forward to try to pull that thorn out of the hill now listen to the Insight that this man had to draw out the thorn the head Stoops and the eyes regard the affected member with intense gaze so a little tiny Thorn enters into the foot and all these things start taking place what is that that's a body that's in unison that's a body now the pain isn't in the back and the pain is not in the belly the pain is not in the arms the pain is not in the fingers the pain is not in the eyes but all of the body is reacting in such a way to bring relief to that one little tiny spot that has the thorn isn't that awesome now notice this in 1 Corinthians 12: 27 now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular so we're baptized by one Spirit into one body but yet we do not leave lose our particular identity so we will not all be the same hair color in heaven will not all be the same size will not all be the same color we will not all be exactly the same and look exactly the same God is not going to have a copy machine and just keep copying one after another after another all of us look exactly alike that will not be and yet God does the same thing here in this mystical body on the earth and even in Ministry and gifts so God will have some that lean more toward the intellectual side Paul did a a great man of great wisdom and understanding but he did not lean toward the intellect to lead him he let God let the spirit lead his intellect yet Peter was more of a Firebrand type of preacher Andrew a prayer Warrior so God had this diversity inside the body and each one of them found what God wanted them to be now the the mystery of it all is God being able to bring us into that real spot notice what he said now ye are the body of Christ all the members together and members in particular you see true Christians that are truly Born Again of the spirit of God and have the Holy Ghost now listen to these words carefully a true Christian born of the spirit of God and they have the Seal of the Holy Ghost they actually manifest the personal presence the personal presence of Jesus Christ every Christian does not have the ability to manifest the personal presence now that is a Greek word that Paul used in in the New Testament several different places and you've heard it it started a camp many many years ago in our ranks called perusia and what that means is there's two different words that was used for the coming of the Lord one of them was the physical appearing the Corporal appearing and the other was the personal presence appearing now every child of God that is filled with the Holy Ghost has something special about them which is not themsel now as the people of God we can't brag on that because it's not something we prayed for it's not something we fasted for it's something that our father gave us by inheriting his divine nature and that's why sometimes that people will get around members of the Bride real true members of the bride and they'll say there's something different about you where do you go to church there's something different what is it that's different about you I'm fixing to tell you what that is that's the personal presence of the Lord Jesus himself deposited in the female form of him on the earth now Christians denominational Christians other types of Christians do they have something with the Lord absolutely can they say I was lost and God saved me absolutely can they say God deliver me of drinking absolutely but do they have that personal presence I'm not talking about emotion now I'm not talking about just running and jumping and we believe in all of that but there is a personal presence of Christ that is in every member of his body so this is his personal presence among men in Christ was the Incarnate God in the bride his elect body is the Incarnate Christ today so no doubt there was a special something about the Lord Jesus for those who were sensitive toward god brother Charlie Cox told me one time that when brother Brandon would come down hunting and they'd go out hunting squirrels and he'd have squirrel blood all over his clothes and his beard would be all grow out certainly didn't look like a preacher didn't look like a prophet but they'd go in them stores maybe after that hunt on the morning to get them a sandwich or something like that them old guys sitting around whittling y'all know what widdling is that sit around on the front porch whittling and talking spitting Amber out the side of their mouth and whenever brother Brandon would walk by there was just something about him an aura a presence those of you there's some here tonight that was actually around him so they could probably witness that too us and there was something special and no doubt we will never have what God allowed him to have but I believe as the people of God he desires his personal presence to be so expressed out of our lives that people know there's something different about you as a child of God I mean knows what I'm talking about and you've experienced it yourself now whenever that happens to us we do not need to be as if the so we've got something to be happy about ourselves but we should be happy that it is speaking out of Us and other people are able to sense it now how in the world born we born into this world lost unregenerate away from the presence of God could God ever get us back to that spot so we had to be redeemed back to our place in Christ now not before uh the world began of course in the mind of God as a thought alone but well God wanted us to come to substance as he wanted to come to substance himself I love the way the prophet says in future home that he thought about himself as being a human and he transmitted that down to become Jesus so here was this this primary thought of God which was the logos and God thought of himself as being a human now he didn't think of that of course in the form of the early stages of the of the dawn of creation but there was a manifestation of a time limit by which that thought would Express itself had he thought of that initially then he would have come out of the realm invisible and he would have manifested himself in the human body way back Yonder in the eons of Ages ago but he thought about that with a time frame on that thought and you're exactly the same way you see even though we were in the mind of God in the mind of the Eternal but God had a time frame on the span of your life so there was a time frame attached to you as being the thought of God you follow me God thought of the Earth the same way and we know of course that the Angels actually fell from heaven before the Earth was ever brought into existence so they fell before the foundation of the Earth and the Earth is one of God's attributes so how is God then going to get us back to that place to where we wouldn't just be thoughts but we would actually be manif ested thoughts expressed in a human form now you know the Plan of Redemption is so wonderful and yet there's Parts about it that is so mysterious turn with me if you to Revelation 5:1 I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals now here John is carried up into a vision now remember things in a vision aren't always as they appear now watch what this is going to happen and how when we just jump down to verse let's let's look at verse six and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain now John is carried up into a dimension and the prophets of course would see their Visions in the fourth dimension light matter time signs where the unbeliever goes where the believer goes and where God Is So in that Realm of the four fourth dimension that's the realm of Television Through The Ether Wes so in that realm a prophet could break into there and he would see something it might be a symbol it might he might see a sheep and it might be represent wool it might represent a lamb so he actually needed an interpretation of that Vision so I want you to notice now John sees and he said behold and I lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts so here was a throne setting and there was four beasts and in the midst of the elders so this is going to identify a certain time frame of when this is going to take place so there's four beasts four creatures and there was also Elders midst of the elders and there stood a lamb as it had been slain so now this is not before the pre this is this is not the pre-incarnate status of the Lord Loos this is not what was Before the Throne of God before Humanity notice when John breaks into this he says there stood a lamb as it had been slain so here John picks up in this stage of the vision but this Vision according to the time slaught would actually have been after the crucifixion and the resurrection of Our Lord so here it was that this lamb as it had been slain now notice the time frame having seven horns and seven eyes well what is that that's the church ages of course so when John looks and sees um this this is very important of course in the book of redemption because God wanted to make known what our inheritance was I realize there's an element of people that say they follow the message and they say they believe the message yet they see no importance of preaching from the opening book they see no importance at all and and setting on the seals they say no value whatsoever of bringing it from that way I'd like to know how in the world you think you're ever going to produce a rapturing faith preaching the same Bible stories that's been preached for 2,000 years and trying to bring a rapturing faith it never it didn't Rapture him 2,000 years ago it ain't going to Rapture you tonight it's going to have to be preached oh yes we'll still preach the same Bible stories but we will preach some Bible stories through an open book in order to bring the true reality of where we are in this in time now I I remember preaching some along this line a couple years ago and I remember a preacher that really got upset at me he was actually sitting in our church whenever I dealt with it and I saw that look come across his face and I knew right then he didn't like the direction I was going but it wasn't what I was saying was wrong it was just his understanding was so shallow he didn't even know where I was coming from so he took it all to one side and made a mess out of of course but I want you to notice how that when John sees this and he sees this land and as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes and remember the seven horns are the power of the Lamb revealed in the seven Church ages so this is not John is not seeing the vision of this before the foundation of the world but it's in the time frame it's during the dispensation of the church ages seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that's set upon the throne they say brother Donnie what in the world has this got to do with us finding our position because these are the only people right here that will ever find it the others will go from church to church they'll go from Doctrine to Doctrine and they'll they'll be drunk on the wine of the they will be drunk on the tribulation pre-tribulation anointing they will have no understanding no need the necessity of it will never Strike their soul to be ready for the ultimate which is the body change they will go right on thinking everything's fine I go to church I belong to church my name is on the book which means the more to God than nothing but yet those who really once they that God calls their name from that book and they catch the identity and they heard their name call and they heard from their theophany which by the way you can't hear from your theophany if you don't have one and those who have one is that theophany is the word made manifest and that lines up appropriately with the horn and the eye in the age that you live in so notice now whenever John sees this and he's breaking into this vision and verse 7 he said he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne now remember God is not a man God Is Not a Human Being God is a spirit but this is a vision so things can appear in A Vision in a vision form which does not mean they're in a reality form I'm sorry you didn't know brother R said that but remember when the seals come open when John writes about them here in Revelation they was opened up in a vision form but the prophet said how much more would it be in the seals in the reality form so there is a vision form and a reality form and John is seeing this in a vision so it was not like God was an old man sitting on the throne and there was Jesus his little boy and this little boy come up and took the book out of his Daddy's Hand it's a vision it's a vision and he came and took the book out of the right hand hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and 20 Elders now remember four and 20 Elders 12 from the Old Testament 12 from the new so what are we talking about after the crucifixion I want you to listen carefully now the Lord Jesus could not do this at the cross this could not be fulfilled at the cross now listen to me carefully the blood the deaths the burial the resurrection there had never been anything like it and there still hasn't been but this book was not opened after the blood was shed after he died and was buried even after he raised again now remember Redemption has multiple stages absolutely the blood was essential but the blood alone did not loose the Seven Seals the resurrection there had never been anything like it before but his resurrection did not loose the Seven Seals look friends what a day we live in what a privileged people we are to live under the administration of an open book at the end time I think of it even after his death's burial and Resurrection the book still had not been opened oh my notice what happens here and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the 4 and20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odor which are the prayers of the Saints now look how your prayers are actually stored up in vials in heaven and whenever this come open notice when the lamb takes the book and then there there's this reaction in heaven that the Beast fall down before him and the 4 and2 Elders fall down before him and whenever they do they bring these vials full of the prayers of the Saints oh my thank you Lord and these prayers were like odors like the incense in the Old Testament and they had been stored up these prayers and whenever the lamb takes the book it releases the prayers of God's people what are they praying for Redemption Resurrection Rapture body chains last member to come in so they can leave Hallelujah thank you Lord God and they sung a new song saying thou AR worthy to take the book and to open the seals there were for thou was slain and Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood now who is this that's singing this song this is the redeemed that have experienced this name calling out of the open book and it's redeemed us to god notice by thy blood how were they redeemed and now notice the curious mystery of redemption is being worked out right now by this mysterious creature that John looked at and saw by Vision it's still being worked out tonight there might be 500 left there might be a thousand there might be a 100,00 who knows but whenever the last name is called and finished and the Mystery the of redemption is done then the lamb will take for the human counterpart of the book book you understand that he took the book out of the eternities and broke the seals but there is a human counterpart of that book on the earth glory to God thou wer worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for that was slain so what are they doing they're giving acknowledgement and recognition that this has been after he was slain so when did he take this book I want you to notice what they keep saying about him what attribute title they keep using lamb lamb lamb don't you understand why this could not happen on the cross because a goat cannot take that book Hallelujah he went there as a lamb but he died as a goat a goat could not take the book look at the lamb goat imagery in our lord Jesus why would he take that imagery upon himself because his wife bore that same imagery he was a lamb first and become a goat you were a goat nature and become alive Hallelujah don't you see what he does John said behold not the goat of God the Lamb of God now notice what these people are saying friends don't you understand this is us by theophonic representation of the presence of God and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the Earth but how is this made possible for us to be in the family of God he must take our sin people have no problem with Jesus becoming a lamb but I'll tell you what will make them sick to their stomach even some of the message folks when you preach the real truths he wasn't just a lamb he become a goat that's all right you can hold your amen so I read you the quotes and then you can say Amen then a lamb took the book not a goat hanging on that cross he became a goat and never did anything wrong don't you remember Leviticus 16 don't you remember in the several different places when God gave them the sacrifices and the Order of the sacrifice one would require a bulock another would require a lamb but on certain days and in certain occasions there must be a coat on the day of atonement there was two goats they would cast lots the priest would they would cast lots upon the goats one goat was killed and the other one the sins of the people were transferred the priest would lay his hands on the head of the goat and trans their sins now you imagine you've been standing there that day and you never saw no sin go on the head of that goat but you had to believe that somehow that priest could transfer not only your sins the sins of the entire nation were transferred on the head of that goat one goat was killed and the other one was took by a clean man which had washed his garments and met certain Str anent requirements given by God and the man would go out into the Wilderness he didn't kill the goat but he turned the goat loose and the Goat would wander out beyond the camp of the people of God until those sins would actually kill that goat some of them would live for days some of them live for weeks but eventually you're talking about a strange bizarre thing you've got this goat out there roaming around in the wilderness there was nothing physically wrong with him there was no heart issues no liver issues the whole issue was sin and the sins of all of these thousands and hundreds of thousands and millions of people was on this goat and he was wandering around and wandering around and many of the theologians down through the church ages many of them said that goat in the wilderness was the devil God sent us a prophet in the end time to straighten out that false teaching and let us know both of those goats were our Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah so he must die and then he must go into the Wilderness called Hades I know friends this Nery chokes us to death when he gave his life on the cross he died the death of a sinner and he had never done one thing wrong notice the prophet here says living dying buried Rising coming and the scriptures in the Old Testament at the sin offering when they got two goats and these goats Jesus represented both of them and they represented him rather and one goat was killed and the other the sins of the nation was placed upon this goat called not the scape lamb the scape goat and the Goat had to go out into the Wilderness to die to be out there alone amongst the Beast Jesus had to be that goat I want you to notice he was a lamb he was a sheep but he was made goat for you and I dear God that would we being goat might become sheep so if we were goat a fallen nature he could not have fully redeemed us if he would have just come down to the level of lamb oh and Moses beat that brass years and years and years before this and hung it up on a pole what a stumbling block it must have been to some of the people of Israel that day when God said Thou shalt make no graven image and yet that Prophet stood there and took a hammer and beat that brass and beat it into a serpent why a serpent why a serpent don't you understand the Lord Jesus became that serpent on the pole on goasa Brother Don I can't stand it when you make him that low you know why tradition won't let you go that low if the devil can keep that head from you you'll never have the full understanding of the Redemption that he's paid for you I didn't bring him this place he brought himself I didn't bring him here you didn't bring him here the prophet of God never brought him there he brought himself brother Joe to that place he was made goat for you and I that we being goat might become she sheep we being Sinners guilty of death subject to death and sold out under condemnation yet Christ become me that I through his grace might become him a Son of God seated at the right hand of God in glory Lord have mercy so he become me that I might become him he took my place as a goat that I might become a sheep he goes on and said that I said a few moments ago he become we were goats he become goat goat for us he becomes sin for us that's the reason had to be punished the way he was because all of our sins were placed upon him and there he had to Bear them away in his own body to Calvary and me know the anointing left him in the Garden of Gethsemane he walked into the Garden of Gethsemane Son of God with the Incarnate father in him he walked out of that that same garden and the anointing left him and there was a transfer a transfer you see it was in a garden meaning Millennia before that the first Son of God made his choice to Forfeit his right as a Son of God to redeem his wife now it's another Garden with The Real Son of God forsaking all the prophet tells us in 1962 in Phoenix he forsook his sunship don't you see reconciliation and Redemption what it is Adam forsook his in the Garden of Eden the Lord Jesus forsook his In The Garden of Gethsemane what was it for both of them the love of a woman i' like to pre preach that to you sometime for the love of a woman Hallelujah the Lord Jesus forsook his sunship he walked in there the fullness of the godhead bodily oh he walked in there the manifestation the attributes of God the alpha all the great things that he was and he walked out a goat with your lying your drinking your adultery your smoking my our Abominations walked into the howling Wilderness of humanity burying our sins and as great as that was he could not take the book because John did not see a goat walk Before the Throne of God and say give me that book he was cursed in the eyes of God cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree how many's ever done something wrong and you feel so bad so filthy so awful and you do that with one sin on you it's hard for our minds to imagine isn't it the sins of the entire world every murder every abortion Every curse word everything that was ever been brother Rob I don't see how he made it I don't see how he walked out of there he must have been so bore oh just bearing our our sins and our our our sorrows and just so weighted down and felt so guilty and felt so dirty and felt so filthy remember on the cross he didn't say my father my father why is th forsaken me but my God my God why he forfeited sunship in the garden so I could stand before you tonight as a Son of God so you could sit here say Amen to the word as Sons and Daughters of God we were goats he become goat for us he become sin for us that's the reason he had to be punished the way that he was because all of our sins were placed upon him and there had to he had to Bear them away in his own body to Calvary a reproach a disgrace sinfully hanging [Applause] there the Lord Jesus become a reproach he was a disgrace sinfully sinfully hanging there naked stripped bleeding and listen this last word bleeding bleeding my God my God why Thou forsaken me he did not die the death of a righteous man he died the death of a sinner so for those of us who have to face death we can face it as a son or daughter of God and say death you ain't got no hold on me why because he become a God no wonder heaven was an explosion in Revival when he took that book CA from Heaven's point of view this was such a tremendous act the most Sublime thing in scripture because from their view they see what he did we have it watered down through denominational this and that and the other come on somebody I think we really need to look at it tonight in full full scope of what it was he was God and become man that was a great condensation but he had to go further he had to go from being man to become a sinner he was a logos and he became a human being he was the Lamb of God as John so identified him Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world but he could not Remain the lamb identity he had to take on that identity of a goat now remember this book that John saw whatever was in this book was so important that it went from the hands of Adam in the Garden of Eden back to the original owner it could not be stored in the courthouse of Heaven it could not be stored in the library you know God has a library K's names there's also books in there in his Library called The Book of remembrance but this book couldn't go there this book was so important it had to go back into the hands of him who sat on the throne now watch in Revelation 10:1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face were as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book would you notice now the size of this book it was a little book open so the size is determining what he's Gathering so it's not all the names of the billions of people that have lived on the face of the Earth and he's coming to call their names cuz no doubt it would be big books but this book specified a particular need a particular purpose now this is the same one that we saw in Revelation 5 but now he's changed his appearance he's appearing in a form which matches Revelation 101 now his garments remember it wasn't an actor so he's changing his garments the garments that he wore in Revelation 5 would not be fitting for Revelation 10 so he changed his garments according to the scene and what the ACT is calling for I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud Revelation 5 doesn't mention nothing about that and a rang bow was upon his head Revelation 5 doesn't mention that and his face were as the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book now notice John specifically notices the status of this book he noticed that it was small and he noticed that it was open so something had happened in between Revelation 5 and Revelation 10 what was that Revelation 6 so when the lamb opened the seals when he started opening them the mystery of what was on the inside the letters written inside of there the mystery was made known so when he appears in Revelation 10 he notices that the book is open which means the Seven Seals had been tore off the backside so remember it was in the form of a scroll like this when the prophet preached it he said if it was one of our modernday books it would be like straps around it so there'd be seven straps around it but and then of course they would have a scroll and they would roll it up and then they'd put something around it and they would put a seal the king's seal or a magistrate seal or you know somebody in the court whatever it was they take hot wax and they'd pour onside that scroll paper and they'd roll it together and they'd pour the hot wax and then they'd take their seal which would either be on a an amulet type of thing wore around their neck like a necklace or it would be on a on a on a ring so they would take that and they'd heat it up and they'd put that seal inside of there then that was to delivered to whoever it was delivered to and that seal better not be broken it had to remain sealed so whenever the man received it then he would take it and he would pop that seal what was it breaking the wax so he would break that seal and then he would unroll the document and he would start reading the contents because it was sent for the eyes of a certain individual now the man carrying it or the whole train or whatever it was it was not intended for them they were just Messengers but it was intended for the one that was sent to can't you see why in each Church age that he said unto the Angel of the Church of Ephesus right unto the angel of the Church of so on and so on right so God gives to them the mystery of the revelation of their age by the spirit of God the Holy Ghost breaks that seal opens the mystery and makes it known this is why the prophet said one of those Angels Came each day can you imagine what a phenomenal thing was happening in 1963 when each one of those angels one of them came each day and made known the mystery to the seventh angel on the earth the mystery which was made known only to them so nobody else in the church age knew the fullness of it and God had to send those seven theophonic beings in those you imagine the angels of God hovered around that Tabernacle in in March of 1963 can you imagine the angels of God hearing things that had not been uttered many of those things since the foundation of the world and don't you know demons was in there too and why some of these people in the message don't want to preach this message it's more than I can comprehend this was so important to God that Angels were gathered around that place Angelic visitation like had never been on the earth he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth verse eight now you know verse three there already cried with a loud voice let's jump down here to eight verse eight now the Declaration is made that time shall be no more but I want you to notice in this 10th chapter something happens now to a goat which was a goat but had now become a lamb because the man who took the book which was a lamb become a a goat and turn back into the lamb stage Oh Glory to God don't you understand what Jesus was the goat was part of the ACT he wasn't goat first he become goat you were only goat because you was in a fallen nature but you were sheep before the foundation of the world and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth this is the same book that the heavens had been searched the Earth had been searched and no one was found worthy Jesus was the missing link as the serpent is the missing link between the Animal Kingdom and the human Kingdom Jesus was the missing link between the Divine Kingdom and Humanity don't you see Satan only copied what God did there was a missing link there where did he get that imagery from somehow he was able to see it from the foundation of the world back there when God created him when Michael was no doubt there and he was able to pick it up somehow and he thought this is what I've got to do I've got to have a link God's got one I need one here was the Leake and the Leake took the book and tore the seals off and opened it but don't you see he didn't open it for himself right he opened it for you don't you understand there would have never been a general Resurrection there would have never been a general Resurrection a Rapture could have never been if the book had not been revealed that's right in Revelation 10 they had his blood they had proof of his resurrection there was men still alive that saw him dead and saw him alive again they had the blood which had purged them thank God for the blood don't we thank God for the blood we needed every day of Our Lives but don't you understand the opening of the book it's a part of the Plan of Redemption just like the blood just like the cross just like the resurrection so why leave that part out this has to do with our inheritance after we're washed in the blood this has to do with us seeing who we are oh if the church could recognize who she is he says and one day she will and the Rapture will go not come he didn't say the Rapture will come but the Rapture will go am when she recognizes who she is and it's amazing because he didn't say when she recognizes who I am well I hope we have I hope we've recognized Malachi for of him but that would in itself has not produced The Rapture yet don't you understand it's not enough for us to recognize Malachi 4 we've got to see who we are we've got to see who we are in the body well I'm a singer I'm a songwriter I'm this that the other that's good but who are you and what are you I'm not talking about just your natural call in line one day my preaching will cease one day there'll be no more preaching in heaven but what will I be when I get to heaven and express Son of God that was there in his thinking before the found of the world and brought back in a human body and when it's all said and done there will be those thoughts in his mind manifested in flesh eternal life in human bodies can you imagine Eternal eyeballs can you imagine Eternal eyelashes Eternal fingers Eternal toes eternal glory to God hallelujah what a day of wa just children of God but we must take the BK we've got to eat it now I want you to notice what happens to John in verse n and I went I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book what in the world happened to this man from Revelation 5 whenever John heard everything in heaven everything else weeping and crying and no man was found worthy and John looks and say My my what in the world's going to happen but something happened to him oh children this is what I want to happen to us then we can look and realize Papa give me the buck give me my P of who I am then surely we will be able to say not just quote I and my father are one and I went into the angel and said unto him give me the little book John are you out of your mind an angel couldn't even have this it couldn't John could not walk up and take that book in Revelation 5 but the mediator humanized the reception of the book The ability to receive the book for any human being was when God changed his currency from Divine to Human so it was not a theophonic hand that reached forth and took it out of the hand of him that sat on the throne in Revelation 5 it was not an angel it was God's Own Humanity so here was the breach the breach that reached up and took the book when he took it it ain't no wonder the rest of them was shouting and jumping and and they said glory to God I get my portion I get my chance to take it to here was the missing link between the book and the pride and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter notice the prophet said he had a little book that John had to eat and when he did he got it into his belly and it was bitter but in his lips it was sweet when you have to digest it then it gets bitter everybody against you everybody telling you you're a holy rer you're this or that or the other you're off in your head it's hard to digest it but when you're testifying of his glory it's sweeten your lips how many's been there and done there it's sweeten your lips that's all but when you stand up in a meeting you say glory to God oh when you're going down through that great Siege it's hard but then when you're out there in that great Siege you can testify of it then it's sweet in the lips that's this book of redemption do you understand what it comes into you but divine revelation and you eat of this word of God don't you understand it's going to be sweet and bitter mixed together amen but you're testifying of what John testified it shows that the lamb has given you your portion of the book and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings so you see we too needed the book to become open to us in this day why brother Donnie so we would know the contents my goodness we spent years and years and years certain the goodness we're further up the road than when we friends come to the message aren't we aren't we what do we want to do we don't want to make great men you know Idols out of them and that well we want to eat the B so you can come to your place I can come to mine we can find who we are in Christ Jesus so we can call for the resurrection I know I know it's just going to choke some some of you that prophet of God said one day you will speak your own body you will call your own body if you've died and entered into the into that sixth Dimension you will call for your own body now we see in this seven seal book it is the mystery of redemption it's a book of redemption from God now all the Mysteries at this time should be finished at the sounding of this messenger and here's the angel on Earth and another Angel Mighty messenger came down see the angel was an earthy Angel messenger But Here Comes one down from heaven a rainbow Covenant only Christ it could be just exactly like it was in Revelation the first chapter notice so that he takes on the imagery of Revelation 1 not Revelation 5 you see friends this is what cleanses us as we walk in the light as he is in the light as he is in the light and the light will change from one phase to another from one Brilliance to another from one Effy of Glory to another and we must find him and when we find him we'll be able to be identified with him and if we walk in the light as he is in the light then we will have Fellowship one with another and no that ain't you and your wife and that ain't you and your brother John is relating fellowshipping between you and God we will have Fellowship one with another as we looked at it Sunday ohar we will have Fellowship one with another and the blood of his son Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin don't you see why we must come to our spot that's what cleanses us Keeps Us ready for the Rapture I'm not talking about people supposing they're under the blood there'll be millions of them that think they're under the blood but all they've got is a chemistry in their mind they've got a paint in their mind but they've not found Jesus in the light of this day they're Found Jesus in the light of 2,000 years ago I've got to find him in the light of 2024 in order for my sins to be purged if not I will meet him as a filthy foolish virgin don't you understand why the bride must be harmonizing with the light of the day the releasing of your sins is identified under the administration of the son of man and the bridegroom's call will come right through this message I know it may seems staggering to some of you but there are men who say they believe this message that preach that people can be in a denomination and go in the Rapture even be in the Catholic church and go in the Rapture why do we need this message then why waste our time reading it why God's going to let everybody and their brother go in and dress like everything in the world and pray to St Cecilia and pray to marry what the Bible says there is one mediator between God and man that the man Christ [Applause] Jesus notice the Seven Seals he says has the book seal the book is absolutely sealed do you see it the book is absolutely a sealed book under the Seven Seals is broken it is sealed up as Seven Seals now that's different from the seven Thunders this is the Seven Seals on the book and the book The Seals will not be released until the message of the seventh angel Paul never mentioned Seven Seals why don't some try to look at me funny he never Paul never mention seven Thunders he preached the cross he preached the blood he preached Redemption through reconciliation God never show Paul there was no need for it he's Liv in the first church age so God did not allow the book to become open even after Jesus went to heaven in the first church age it was saved for your day I don't blame the devil if I was him I'd fight this message too I if I was a devil I'd hate this message I'd hate every message preacher this really preaching as that is I do everything in the world I could to stop them but guess what devil you ain't going to stop us because this didn't start with us it didn't start with me it didn't start with you it started with the Lord God before the foundation of the world let me just say there ain't enough demons out of hell to stop this message there ain't enough websites there ain't enough Liars there ain't enough people trying to accuse a prophet of God this message will be standing when the world is on fire Hallelujah I don't know about you tonight friend I thank God for the messenger of Malachi 4 I thank God for this end time message it's going to be the very thing that's going to change our bodies the seals will not be released into the message of the seventh angel let's stand so you see we're presuming but the genuine revelation of God will be made perfect and that sounding and Vindicated truth that's exactly what the word said the mystery should be finished at that time the seven sealed book remember it was closed in Revelation the 5th chapter and in Revelation the 10th chapter it was opened now we're going to see what the book says about how it become open and it's not made known until the lamb takes the book I remember not the goat do you understand he could not do this at the cross the actor's garment was a goat not a lamb if he would have tried to went Before the Throne of God he would have been thrown out that's right of the presence of God but he wouldn't do it cuz he knew his position and just like with ours there comes hardships and difficulty but I guarantee you one thing there ain't not one member of the bride of Christ has ever been through what our lord Jesus went through ain't that right we were in the cess poool of sin and our Way's been up from the time he saved us but his way was come down hated criticized ridiculed lied forsaken by men and then turn right at the very end and father God the spirit for suck him and let him die sinner this horrible death in order to redeem us so if you're here tonight and you still got a goat nature you don't have to have it anymore you can become converted right here for this service sins he become a goat so you could become a lamb so if you're stubborn and hardheaded nobody don't be nothing well whether or not you want to admit it I'm going to go admit it for you got a goat nature you're stubborn you B this bad I don't believe that I don't believe that well get a l am nature and you'll believe every word God spoke praise God oh my let's jump down here to the brothers the conference title there in two song as you people that Shear has had the tapes on the Seven Seals when the lamb come forth to claim his Redemption what he had redeemed time was finished then he's working in it now doing the work of redemption but someday he walks from the sanctuary to take up the book of redemption that he's purchased with his own blood so there's a vision Visionary image of this taking a book and there's the reality form of taking the book Oh Glory to God and remember it was not the taking of the book that purchased it it was the blood it was not the resurrection from the dead that purchased it all of this steps into the Redemption you understand so we can't do away with any of them then the hour is over he comes forth then to claim what he has redeemed oh I got to read one more is it okay that's good cuz how was going to anyway but it just makes it nicer when yall say Amen listen to this now you see the seals when he was in his mediatorial work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book oh that he's redeemed and all that's in this book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book so in Revelation 5 in symbol form he takes the book from the eternities Revelation 10 it gives it to John and our age the seals are tore off the Mysteries made known can't you see how one leads in into the other into the other and then the last taking of the book is when your body's changed I love this one choss the mystery oh I absolutely love it someday he comes forth to get this book now notice someday he comes this this is not fulfilled friends someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in this book would be him for that's the believer wow it makes it sound like you and him are are the same oh I guess that's what he meant when he preached it the rising of the sun this are seal she is him you see we ain't got it yet y'all just stand there like a bunch of Baptist when it hits you about 3:00 in the morning you'll tear the sheets off your bed you go to running and screaming your wife will be dialing 911 say honey what in the world's a matter I got it I got it I got it but you know what you're looking at the goat that's right and if you don't get your eyes off this right here you ain't going in no rapture I read at the SE where brother man was talking about priest studying for Sunday and he said as priests we come to sacrifice and Worship the Lord and praise him and he said you let the devil tell you you're too tired you're too tired and he said you keep letting him do that he will take you to hell you imagine by you letting the devil tell you that you're too tired to worship God and you keep listening to him and you'll let him take you to hell I thought wow that is serious is it not let me close all that's in this book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book The Believer is the words in the book so friend it's not that in the book is the name Janet pay and um um Harry Reagan and Joe Hara and Donald Reagan Jr that's not my real name I've got a word name but the mystery of my life me coming to the Earth July the 9th 1956 starting on my journey back to full Redemption get saved at 12 get immersed in water in titles wrong way I would get the gift of the Holy Ghost I would speak in tongues I would start preaching at 18 all of that was right there the mystery of my life he would speak to me as I would cross Wolf Creek Dam audibly out of the backseat of the vehicle I was riding in and tell me about a predestinated plan and there's more light I didn't even believe in predestination what was it the mystery of my life oh glory to God and all that's in that he come for this book of redemption whose names are written on that book before the foundation of the world can I please read one more the church is a predestinated church every name that was ever put on that book Jesus came to redeem and when that last's name is redeemed the book is closed he didn't intend that no one be lost but his for knowledge let him know who would be lost therefore he could predestinate and their names are put on that book and when that book of redemption is closed and sealed with Seven Seals while he's been worked out by the mysterious powers of God and someday when that book of redemption is finished the lamb takes it then that last name is called off that the lamb comes forward to call for what he has redeemed that's his church and I believe the time is close at hand and everybody said let's B it together dear Lord Jesus heavenly father as we have our heads bowed to the dusts of the Earth from whence our body were taken we realize this flesh is not the real us as I listened to a minister the other day Lord as he was sharing with me some of the experiences that he' been through his wife that he' been married to for 21 years he went to church on Sunday morning and she wasn't feeling good so his two children came back after church to check on her she was expecting twin boys when they come back they find their mama laying in the kitchen floor dead they called their daddy he comes in there tore all to pieces of course shaking quivering crying and he said brother Donnie God let me see a vision and he said I saw my wife leave out of her body and I saw two young men leave out of her as well so the brother lost his wife and a set of twin boys in the same day yet Lord God God you knew their names before the world ever began as you know our names no doubt the mystery of our life contains much Sadness and Sorrow we have disappointments heartbreaks misunderstandings and your will will inflict Upon Us sometimes pain and sorrow but it's only for a fleeting moment for as Paul said I reckon that the present sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in us at that day Hallelujah Lord Jesus help us to be faithful if there's a one here tonight Lord that have not heard their name called from that book I don't mean that they heard a a voice call some kind of name but it was something that got a hold to them might have been sitting on a bar stool they might have been out in a barn somewhere just got through milking the cows they might have been sitting in a Baptist Church Pentecostal Church whatever more but it was like something Beyond them was calling them to a place higher than they ever knew Lord God I want to say tonight I thank you so much that as human beings you have allowed us as your people to express your personal presence in this day that we live what an honor to have a gift is a wonderful thing to be able to sing for you a wonderful thing to be able to preach awesome but we know there'll be many people that will do those things and stand before you in Matthew 24:24 and be judged and be lost but if one ever is granted that personal presence of Jesus Christ and his being that is his part of the book of life for everything that was in the book was you so the Book of Life is the mystery of your new married life Hallelujah for we know that our name was actually placed in that book when your name was no doubt yours was the first one in the top of the page and the prophet said when your name was spoke there so out hours was spoken to existence before the foundation of the world written indelibly with the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ I always thank you for your blood tonight father how we thank you for your resurrection and how we thank you for taking the book in the last days and opening up to the bride what she needed to hear what she needed to see what she needed to rejoicing the sad part about it is Father it helps us to realize there's people who set in our own church people who set in message churches around the world and they would sit under the preaching of an open book for years and turn and walk away and go to some denominational vomit or go to some hybrid so-called message guy they prove thems Unworthy of eternal life How could a person ever walk away from the open Book of Revelation 10 when they have been invited by the mighty Angel himself God don't let them hear me tonight don't let them hear me inviting them to come come and take the book lord God you speak to them John didn't hear Paul say it John didn't hear Peter said it John heard you say it it was you that invited John to take the book oh Jesus we worship you tonight father hallelujah hallelujah do you love him Saints with all your heart oh I trust each of you tonight I trust that you have heard him personally make the invitation come and dine the master call us come and D not feeding on Creeds credentials of man Dogma Theology of some school somewhere but feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man and he tells us after he preaches that great Dynamic sermon he says children what's that hunger in you it's the father trying to make himself known to you but she lets so many things get in the way and many knows that's most of our problems You' not believe the text the emails the whatsapps that I've heard from preachers and from people all over everywhere since the service Sunday one Minister many years of my Elder said he didn't know how many years that he had left on the Earth but that sermon had changed his life and how many ever years he had left he would be different from Sunday on I thought praise God it was worth all the studying if ain't but one
