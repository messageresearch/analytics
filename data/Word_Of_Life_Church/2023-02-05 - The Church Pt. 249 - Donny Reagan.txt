matter what we own why much we're worth the value of our property or anything like that when it comes to that time the only thing really matters is we're ready in it I trust that's our desire today we welcome you today the first official service Word of Life Church of Johnson City who had a little open house here Wednesday night but I guess officially we wasn't allowed to do that we actually had permission but we didn't have written permission but I got the certificate of occupancy I pulled out of the parking lot at the municipal place in Johnson City at 4 58 on Friday evening they close at 5. like everything else has been with this project we've done it's been to the right down to the last wire of everything but thank the lord we got it today so we can officially shout jump sing praise the Lord cry make an alder call whatever the Lord leads us to do today I trust this will be the beginning of many great times that we'll have together as the people of God we're grateful for it each of you I know are grateful to not have to go back to the Holiday Inn I'm grateful for the Holiday Inn as a place as a hotel but for a church and not so much but um each cold day I was sitting back there or night no heat so I sent back a freezing to death with my coat on so this morning I went in and had a really nice warm steady back there so many of you have complained of course your back hurt them with those seats and all that it was uncomfortable so I'll tell you what we have to do all them excuses we've got my last layer massage today so if y'all don't worship I'm gonna think oh so let's lay us out all of our excuses now I hope everybody's looked around everybody look around just look around say all that okay now you've seen that was helping our hearts to the Lord to see what he has for us today I believe we're living in a great hour I want you a great time turn with me if you would to the Book of Genesis chapter 4. I thought I knew what I was going to speak about today in our first service but about 10 minutes after nine the lord caught me up is what he had in his mind already I don't understand exactly why Desmond that way doesn't it went a lot I don't know if I'm that hard to hit it or what so needless to say I was a basket case um so I trust that you'll be able to make sense of it all today Genesis chapter 4 verse 1. and Adam knew his wife and she conceived and bear Cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord she again bear his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of sheep notice the difference in their occupation Abel was a keeper of sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground and in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought the fruit of the grounds an offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel notice the order the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering not his offering first but to him the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but unto Cain again the person first instead of the offering but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very Ross and his countenance fell we're going to Bow our heads together today I wonder how many would like to be remembered before the Lord and God bless each of you Heavenly Father we want to say with gratitude in our hearts we're so glad to be able to be gathered here today after many many plans and many many hours of work and so many have done so much Lord and we are thankful for each one for what they have done now Lord we're able to officially have our first service we're just so grateful today we're not coming to present a nice place we thank it that it is a nice place but we know that if we were here in a a brush Harbor or in the tent or we was gathered out under a tree Lord you would still be there because where your people are joined together is where you desire to be Lord Jesus we're asking you that you would help us today help me to get out of the way help me that I can be able to surrender myself father help the people to be able to receive from you granted Lord God I pray Heavenly Father for him brother retiefs family there in South Africa Lord it was your time to call our brother home today and heading to church and I imagine there's hundreds and hundreds of our brothers and sisters there their Pastor being taken and they are Weeping and crying and so sad now just trying to figure out what they will do and so on so we pray that you would be with them today Lord that you would comfort them another one of your children is made it safely across the Divide we ask you Lord that you would be with them help us now fathers we Endeavor to look into your word for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask you and the Saints said amen amen God bless you you may be seated I don't know thank you I'd like to speak to you this morning on accepted worshipers accepted worshipers it must have been quite an awesome thing unlike what we're experiencing here today to where we've got a new facility of our own and feel like we've been kind of in the Feast of Tabernacles for the last four months we've been you know booths and here and there and there and whatever we can make best of but I think in all that there was still a reason for all that but our scene opens with the two first worshipers outside of the garden gate they both had been taught by the same parents they hadn't quite heard all the story that it brought them out of the Garden of Eden you see their parents were not quite honest with them they were not taught that it was blood that brought them out they were not taught exactly what their mother had done but yet God has a way of making himself known to his own whether you are taught the truth or not he will get the truth to you I think we all can say Amen to that because that's pretty much where all of us were and yet it was a an occasion that must have been a happy one it must have been both of them had come to a spot to her for whatever reason we have no account that they had done this before that had done this prior to this particular setting if they had Moses did not take account of it and it must have been something that they were given a notice on as it were Maybe by their father maybe directly by God we don't know for sure but somehow they both knew it was time for them to worship they knew it was time for them to come to the best they knew as an altar now remember neither of these boys had actually been inside the Garden of Eden all their life all they had known was living outside the garden gate so I can imagine they would walk up there from time to time and they would get close to where the cherubims were and they would see the flaming fire on both sides and they would feel an element of fear remember they had been born totally different than the way their mother and father had come into the Earth and they themselves had now been born with fear they'd been born with an element of trauma they had been born with an element of nervousness and all that sort of thing Adam created fresh from the hand of God didn't know what that was like neither did Eve but their boys did so you can imagine them as they would come near this big beautiful gate and they would ask why can we know not no longer go inside of that didn't you say you used to live there oh yes we used to live there we used to live there what was that lie oh boys it was it was more than you can comprehend yeah you you just cannot imagine what it was like to be inside of that place the great animals would come up to us and the birds would fly upon Papa's shoulder and they'd clue to him and he would name them the dinosaurs would come through the paradise of God there was no harm there was just as gentle as a little kitten and they would tell them over and what was it what was it that brought you all out well we will not go into the details of that that is not really something that we want to talk about it's not really something that we want to share with you boys maybe maybe maybe sometime later we'll tell you about it but yet on this particular time it had come a time for them to go to worship you see there's something about the heart of every individual whether they even believe in God or not there's something in them that caused them to worship and they will worship something they'll either worship God they'll worship a piano they'll worship a building they'll worship an idol they'll worship their wife themselves their mother their father it's in all human beings to worship some worship movies some worship their phone they worship social media they're more in contact with that than they are with God so that's what they worship so everybody will worship something now whether these boys had never worshiped God before or not the Bible doesn't really say but yet it opens up with this particular occasion to where that they are both notified they are made known that it's time for them to go to church as many of you no doubt today you knew we were going to have her first service and I woke up I don't know how many times during the night I woke up I don't know how many times during the morning kept looking over at my clock I've got one over on a dresser there kept looking at it looking at it scared to death so it's going to miss the first service which would be bad for the pastor wouldn't it so I'm looking at the clock okay I've got four more hours I've got five more hours whatever more and then finally you know it rolled around thought okay I got to get up so I was anxious needless to say and I Carol said you sleep very good off and on you she said well I was waking up going back to sleep waking up I was watching the clock yeah I said yes same here so it must have been a similar thing for them in that they were very anxious to know what to do it must have been very singular in that both of them had their own approach and only one of them is going to be accepted now you know God is obligated to make his way known to sincere Hearts oh I love him for that don't you and he wants to make himself known to those who are even out of his economy by election if they would only open their hearts and humble themselves to the way of the elect God would accept them as well but we're fixing to see the first setting where a hard-headed stubborn mortal on the earth refuses to listen to God and he also refuses to take advice and counsel from one who is more revelated than himself now that's always hard for one human being to do to another and yet this is the setting that we have today so the Bible then tells us that Cain had brought Adam knew his life and she conceived and barricade and said I've gotten a man from the Lord and she again bear his brother Abel and Abel was The Keeper of the sheep so we see their vocations are totally different now originally Man In The Garden of Edom he did not paint for a living He was not a plumber he was not an electrician he was not a computer scientist but man was actually a gardener so all man really had to do was to watch and just take care of what God had given Adam never had to make any plants and never had to hybrid any plants he never had to come up with any sort of new product it simply take care of what God gave him and Adam failed in doing that so he's to watch it and to keep it and yet because of his Disobedience now he's put out and everything is gone away with of what he knew in the Garden of Eden and now he's on the outside in the city-state as it were of the region still called Eden but no longer able to walk inside the garden so his boys are going to as they were identified they are going to come up and be able to worship now we know already there was something totally different about Cain we know that his nature was different than different seed lines and now he's going to reflect where he's from by how he goes to church now listen what the Bible says in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering to the Lord now there would not seem unusual to a carnal-minded man of the world because this is all he knew this is what he done so he tilled the ground he was as what we would say today was a farmer and Adam himself had now moved outside of the garden gate and he also no doubt had started tilling and he had done many various things but somehow there was a difference in this in that Cain is going to use this his occupation his job as a means to come to worship God now notice his first error is that he believes his Works will get him favor in the eyes of God let me tell you right now it will never do it there's only one thing that will make us accepted and God God's eyes and that is we accept first God's provided way for our day other than that we're lost now but Cain he has this idea now we know that they were taught the prophet tells us over and over again they were taught that it was fruit that brought them out of the garden of Edom so all he's doing is simply bringing back what he was taught so he was taught it was fruit so what's he do he brings maybe beautiful vegetables and fruits and plants and as I said he must have had a little bit of a warning an inclination and he has an idea that he's going to have a little bit of time to prepare this so he brought forth maybe his best cantaloupes his best tomatoes his best cucumbers his best corn and his best of this and that and that and we'll just say later variety out before the presence of God and they come near to where this altar was at the garden gate now they never ventured to go exactly where it was but as close as they felt comfortable in going and while he lays it there and opens up in all almighty God I bring before it to you the very best that I have I have labored I have sweated I have done this and I have done that you understand where I'm going I have done something else and God I pray that you will take all this work of my hands and while he's doing it I hear a ruckus I hear a noise I hear something that is so different than what he is doing and I look as I'm standing there with them and I see Abel now whenever Eve named Cain she said I have gotten which is acquired I have gotten a man from the Lord now that that's the King James version but if you look in other versions you'll find out she said I have gotten a man with the Lord not from him but she actually believes she had been with God and the product of that Union was Cain and we know of course they were Twins and Cain was first being the firstborn and then Abel was born and she calls him vained vain shortness of life not very valuable I don't want you to just look this morning at two ancient names of the scripture but I want you to identify yourself with these two boys because in reality all of our life's story is written here in Genesis 4. there is a part of you that was the firstborn your flesh and the second born is your able which is your seed your soul the firstborn is always the one that wants to be the boss and you know what our cane will do his best to kill our able but don't let your cane kill your Abel you've got control over that cane that's right so Cain was the first one notice the order so he's the firstborn he has the birthright he has as it would be the order of the priesthood he's the one that would have the first approach to God seemingly and yet he comes first and he's allowed to be there before the altar of God and the presence of God as close as he could come and then Here Comes Abel and Abel I can see him as he gets a little a little lamb without a spot or a blemish and now we know this is totally contrary to what his father taught him his daddy and his mother told him over and over again it was fruit it was fruit that brought us out of the garden of Edom we ate the wrong thing we ate an apple we ate a pomegranate we ate you know we ate the wrong thing and of course that's why God told them to put clothes on because they ate an apple well as it's been said if eating apples makes people realize they're naked we better buy a whole bushel of them and go to Walmart start passing them out maybe some folks will start putting more clothes on but we know it was not an apple it was Disobedience to God's word and here comes Abel and he has a lamb and he tied a grapevine because there was no rope so he tied a grapevine around that Lamb's neck and he's pulling it to his altar and here is ableist or he's coming with tears and he said all emotional and all worked up and as he's coming and and Cain is just finishing his prayer remember Cain was a very religious man as a matter of fact the prophet tells us he was much more religious than Abel ever was to be honest with you I don't want to be religious I want to be right eousness is not necessarily being religious but righteousness is having rights standing with God I ain't worried about being religious today and I don't want to bring any of you to religion so much I want to bring you to Christ Jesus so you can be righteous before his presence is that what you want with all your hearts so Abel comes now and came maybe just finishing up maybe holding his hands a certain way and his elbows laying it on me all turn you know fixing his face to where that it was what he thought was an identification of sincerity and bringing it to almighty God and God did not say a word God did absolutely nothing there was no Heavenly reaction to Cain's offering so here comes Abel and he's pulling this little lamb and the Little Lamb an able pulling on him and pulling on him and the dust kicking up from his legs and here he comes tears running down his cheeks knowing that he's already accepted before he offers it to God Hallelujah you see how can you say that he hadn't even he hadn't even broke the blood cell of the Lamb he knew he was accepted because God gave him the Divine approach you see before he ever offered the lamb God accepted him and he accepted the lamb because of who he was he accepted the person the worshiper now we know that being Sunday of course that all over the world today already in Australia New Zealand and Asia and Africa in different parts of the world people have already went to their Sunday service and their seven eight hours ahead of us some of that farther away depending on the International Date Line where they cross it and they've already had their Sunday morning service and they've worshiped God and they've offered their praise and but I wonder how many of them the Lord God actually accepted you see people say well whatever I get him he will he will take it no no he won't he will take only what his provided way says he will take he's not like you and I to well we're saying well if I get up and I give God this so that God will take it God said no I simply will not refuse I will refuse whether you're offering if you don't come my provided way now you imagine by this time that kind of came is standing there and he's looking at his brother and he's thinking what in the world is the matter with him you little Holy Roller you loud outfit where is your church order where don't you know how to worship oh but he does but he's so different from His Highest brother that his half-brother is looking at him and trying to figure out what in the world is going on now remember this is a very religious man so Abel the scripture says abroad of the firstlings of the flock and of the fact thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel first and to his offering not the other way around it wasn't that God looked at the offering and said okay the offering is good so I accept the offering and now I accept you God accepted Abel and on that basis he accepted his offer you said well how can that be how was it had already proved his approval of Abel by giving him a divine revelation now there was no Bible in that day remember no Genesis Moses is writing this hundreds and hundreds of years after actually thousands of years after that it took place so there was no written bible there was no table there was no prophets there was nobody there there was no church there was no Pastor even his mother and father taught him wrong but God wanted to make sure he knew the right way to worship you see God is obligated to his own to bring the way of righteousness to his own I'm so grateful for that today where would you and I be today friends had it not been for that was anybody in here taught wrong besides me I tell you the more I realize about God the more I realized how much I didn't even know about God and God by his grace brought us to his truth and it was not because of the truth I knew that brought me to him that it was because of this truth I was born of his bone and spirit of his spirit and life as a his life I was part of him before I ever even knew I was part of him so he accepted that on Abel and he gives him a divine revelation I tell you we may be poor people we may be middle-class people we may be lower class people but if we're sitting here today and God has given to us a revelation of who he is and who we are and where we're going and what it's going to take to get there we ought to be one happy group of people praise the Lord oh my now the story turns we've got Abel in verse 4 which is accepted Watch What Happens in verse five but unto Cain until his offering he had not respect God doesn't even answer Cain he doesn't even say anything about Cain's offering until after Abel offers his so now this is going to place Cain in bad light but not just in the eyes of God not just because of God but because of his brother his brother made him look like a bad person but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very Roth and his countenance failed now Moses had a reason for writing that in those terms so Cain comes up to the altar and he has the smile as it was this this appearance of knowing that he's going to be accepted so he comes oh my must have just been so upbeat he was so happy all praise God God's going to accept me today I'm going to be able to walk into his presence and maybe who knows who knows God may even let me back inside the garden gate Mom and Daddy's told me that it's him there and they told me how great it was maybe God will let me back in and he's coming with such anticipation and he's so excited and it must have been a look upon his countless it was just beaming with joy and Yuri standing the whole time and then a little bit of something affects him as his brother comes and he's still standing there hopeful that God's going to let him back in and then when God when God performs a miracle and sends down a streak of fire out of heaven and consumes Abel's offering Theo De cushy Theo De Cushing God looked intently on Abel's offering God didn't just look at it but God looked with such intentness That Fire come out of Heaven is the word theodicishing Fire come out of Heaven from the presence of God and ignited that lamb and God burn it up but God made not a move when Cain offered his so here is the Holy Ghost and Fire praise the Lord identified with Abel's offering this is why I still believe in the Holy Ghost and Fire not the Holy Ghost and Ashes I don't want just ashes of what we used to have anybody say amen I don't want just ashes well we used to do this and we used to praise God we used to worship God shame on you if you just used to do it you ought to do it now more than you've ever done in your life we got more to praise him for we got more to thank him for but you can imagine now so the prophet tells us this when the Harvest Time by revelation of the word God's word before it was even written you see God's word was already allocated in the heavens and God has never had a new thought God has never even spoken new word so every page of the scripture every book of the Bible every word that every Prophet would ever say was already in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and that's why God by Revelation would deal with these prophets in this Supernatural Majestic form that God would convey from his own mind something he wanted them prophets to catch and they was of direct contact oh my from the presence of God straight to their soul how in the realm of vision the fourth dimension they were able to go into that realm and God would project it was such a perfect channel that Satan could never get into it unlike you and I well I feel led to do this and I feel that and we've all felt led to do a lot of things that turned out to be the devil well go ahead and say Amen you have but when God wanted to secure a way that was so infallible he chose a prophet and he chose the means to project his time by the way of vision it was so perfect it could not be broken that's why when a prophet would say thus saith the Lord there are enough devils in hell to stop it from happening is that right this is where we hang our soul today so when God projects this before there was ever any prophets God projects this Revelation straight to the heart of Abel and Abel does this all according to the revelation of God and now God vindicates it it's not enough for you and I to say I believe God with all of my heart we need the sign of our exception which is what mother Donnie the token the Holy Ghost and Fire oh well I I picked out my Pew here in the new building I'm going to be there every time you have a service that's my sign I'm a Believer no that's just being faithful to your post of Duty you're supposed to be at your post of Duty is that right but that does not mean that God has accepted you God wants to see the token on display in every life and God doesn't want it to be just by well I join a church I sign a book I attend the church I believe every word the prophet said that's just being able to read God wants that stamp of approval on your soul and on my soul that we have passed from Death unto life when did the fire come and consume the lamb after the lamb was dead when do you and I get the Seal of the Holy Ghost on our soul what our first nature is dead we are no longer just church members we are no longer trying to live right well I'm going to turn over a new Leaf it takes more than turning over a new Leaf I'm going to try to be a good person I went to the library yesterday brother Donnie and I checked out how to be a better Christian and I've got a whole library of self-help books you might as well start a fire with them because they'll never get you to heaven there's only one way you can ever get there and that is by God's way accepting what God did and God accepting you has given you the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can hold that token in Satan's face and say back off devil cancer gets a hold of your body you can hold your token and say turn me loose [Applause] Satan grabs a hold of one of your kids or your husband or your wife you can hold that token before you and say Satan take your hand off of my daughter take your hand off of my son well wouldn't this be the natural thing to do so you got confidence in your daddy so-called your confidence in your mama they tell you it was an apple so what do you do you go to an apple tree you pull down a red delicious a Golden Delicious you pull down the Fiji you pull down this one you pull down that one you someone I'm not sure exactly what Apple it was but I'm just going to offer God all these fruits and I'm going to polish them they are going to be so beautiful I'm gonna throw in a few cantaloupes maybe a watermelon who knows some figs I'm going to make God so overwhelmed there's no way God will be able to turn me down I'm going to buy the Widow Some Coal I'm going to buy some groceries for some good people and I'm going to do this and that woman I get up to heaven there ain't no way God will turn me down he will if you don't have the Holy Ghost he will if you don't come his provided way is that right Saints you see the Hebrew word that Moses chose to use that I found this amazing it was a look that was so keen and Earnest and a penetrating glance penetrating glands and then the Theologian theodosian in the the Greek translator in the second century use this this word that I've been claiming to you and it means to be kindled or set on fire or ignite it I hope that's what the Lord God does to every member of this church all many of you have had the Holy Ghost for years and years but I dare said we could probably take a refilling this morning I want you to notice tournament in Hebrews if you would chapter 11 verse 4. and Paul catches this sometime years later after this and he said by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it being dead yet speak us I notice him so Abel's Abel's blood had a voice so Abel's blood had a voice Abel was dead Paul said being dead yet speaketh what what was it that spoke the blood had a voice and Moses when he takes the account of course he doesn't pull it through the cross but Paul is identifying that there was something more than just a natural fruits and vegetables something more than an animal but supernaturally God had given this man a witness and he obtained this from God that he was righteous that's offering isn't this what it's all about being accepted you know it's not only for church people but the majority of the people in the world they want to be accepted so why did they dress a certain way why do they do a certain thing why do they hang around certain people because they want to be accepted in that group of people is that right no it's not necessarily wrong to want to be accepted I think we all do but it depends on who you were wanting to be accepted by most of you probably feel that way do you not today I've always wanted to be accepted most of my life and yet there's always been categories of people I have never been accepted in and there will always be that now I realize as I've gotten older that my category of people that I want to be accepted in has also changed so I don't want to be accepted in the upper echelon of America I do not want to be accepted in the great people of the world what they would call great but what I desire to be accepted in is by almighty God and by his children I don't figure there's any higher category of people on the Earth than the seed of God did anybody say Amen to that and yet many of you young people know what it's like you may want to hang around a certain group of our youth or you may go to a youth camp and you say oh I like to make friends with them and no matter how hard you try it seems you're not accepted maybe your clothes aren't nice enough or you don't come from my nice enough family and it really bothers you because you're not accepted or I would to God that we was that concerned about being accepted by God like we are people we go to church with and people that we will meet at a young Youth Camp or maybe a certain chat or something on Facebook or Instagram and you say well nobody's invited me to join that chat nobody will let me be a part of well I'll tell you today almighty God is right here in this building and if you're not saved and you don't know him he is making you the most awesome offer you would ever be able to give and that is to be accepted into beloved to be accepted Hallelujah in the body of Jesus Christ and to be accepted in the Rapture and the change oh my God oh God help us unto Abel and his offering notice accepting the person before accepting the gift notice this the prophet tells us Cain maybe it's all they're just as pretty prettier than Abel's well of course it would have been prettier because you would lay out the fruits and the vegetables maybe you know use a little bit of greenery one of the good things for broccoli wow use broccoli for decoration and parsley you know and some of that stuff and then you lay it all out and you just decorate it so beautifully and then you'd have something real real beautiful and outstanding in the middle of it and then you lay all these other things around there you come and say oh God I'm so impressed myself wow look what I've done look at what I've done and then your brother comes up and he builds his altar maybe out of Refuge Stone it's not pretty at all it's not beautiful he takes that lamb and he doesn't have a knife as we would today but a sharp rock with an edge on it maybe a piece of flint or something and he goes to hack it not a little love uh [Music] the blood is getting in its and it's throat and it's choking the hot blood spewing out all over Adam's or Abel's clothes oh God the blood all over the altar and your can stands King I cannot believe him he thinks that's Church he thinks that's the way you're supposed to behave in church afraid we've still got a few Canaanites hanging around us oh my anybody go to cry and go to standing up and raving their hands to the Lord they think there's something wrong with you well we think the opposite we think there's something wrong with you if you don't want to do it oh my god there ought to be something inside of us that wants to praise the Living God you imagine as Abel realizes this lamb is dying in his Stead the slam is taking his place and the tears now trickling out of his eyes mingling with the blood of the lamb and there he stands an absolute mess he looks like a butcher a picture how could anyone with love butcher this innocent he wanted to be accepted it friends as you're a pastor I want you to love me I want you to love me I want you to appreciate the good things God does to us but if ever one of you turned me down turn your back on me out to this service and say we don't want you no more we wanted to use you just long enough till you had finished this building and now we've got somebody else in mind now that would be painful to me it would break my heart but more than you accepting me I want him to accept when you and I come to Crossing that Great River Called Death mama won't be there Daddy won't be there even the pastor can't be there just a little while ago and our brother over in South Africa a few hours ago got ready to cross the sun couldn't be there his wife couldn't be there she was in the automobile listen but she's in the hospital in intensive care but when it come to crossing over the only one that could be with him was the Lord oh he was known around the world a man of Honor reputation among many many people in South Africa of course and in different parts of the world and yet none of those people saying well accept him Lord accept them that's not enough our brother would have to have the fire you see us when God looks upon the sacrifice you see people many of them to this face who cannot understand why the Lord Jesus had to suffer the way that he did the wrath of God was being taken out again on the Lamb of God this time not a four-legged lamb but a two-legged Lamb with a soul you see that four-legged lamb of Abel did not have a soul so the innocency of that lamb could not come back into Abel but when the Lamb of God died on the cross blade him and weeping and crying my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me what was it he was making a way so we could sit here this morning in the month of February 2023 and some of us being our background drunks and adulterers and idolaters and liars and Among Us and everything else you can imagine but here we set today with the spirit of God cleansing our soul and ways in our hands before almighty God and God saying I accept you I accept your worship I accept your praise because I accept you oh notice the prophet goes on to say in the bottom part of this quote God Vindicated Abel by consuming his sacrifice so God consumed able sacrifice then what Abel has is the token so God didn't let the fire go over unable and lick all the blood off of Abel but Abel has the chemistry all over him you imagine he must have looked like a mess wonder what you and I would have thought brother Larry that Dave had been standing near and see this guy must say where have you been where have you been to the slaughterhouse no I've been to church blood all over his hands brought all over his clothes blood all over his face all mingled together with tears and he's shouting a little bit as he goes back rejoicing praise God praise God you're saying what in the world are you so happy for because God received me and because God accepted me God accepted my sacrifice and the Reason God accepted my sacrifice because it was the right one he made it known to me what he would accept I simply carried out what he said Lord friend we expect to be misunderstood we expect to be lifetime ridicule made fun of him but really in reality that don't matter what matters is we know when it's all said and done we will be accepted by the Lord God because we accept his atonement for our sins [Applause] oh my so here we are in church this one guy shouting around happy praising God and this other person's getting mad in church still happens don't it folks get mad in church but I became unto his offering he had not respect and Cain was very Ross now notice the order again that God didn't accept the person so it doesn't accept the sacrifice do you want to do all these good works in vain do you realize many people is going to stand before the Lord that day and he will look at them and say depart from me you worker of iniquity I never knew you yet they will say I cast out devils in your name I built churches I I preached I sang I I was on the field for years and years I've done this and they say that's not what I accept I don't even know you Lord God help us notice this word Ross it means to be to be hot Furious burn to become kindled fixed vexation Furious so this is what Cain got from going to church on Sunday morning so he went in office oh man he was in the best mood that ever was and he goes in there and this is what he turns into Furious burn become angry become Kindle go out the back door and slam the door I'll never go back there again church and yet here we are rejoicing and worshiping God for the truth it still happens does it not so Cain now being so upset and his countenance false not Moses of course was in in a secret place with God we'll say in the cleft of The Rock when God reveals this to him and Moses must have like other prophets saw it by Vision people want to know why we believe the Bible is so infallible and how could these men that were not even there record these events as if though they were there well because to us the way we believe it they were there they were transported back in time I believe Moses myself walked right there in the Garden of Eden it's also believed the prophet of this age also by Vision was able to go back in the Garden of Eden as he preaches about it and said that he was beside myself last night and I come to myself and beside myself and I saw Adam and Eve remember him talking about that he also said the same thing about seeing the five comings of Elijah this is why it was so real to them by Vision they were actually carried back in time to see it and he sees two people in church wasn't a very big church at all but they had a big split over it so one of them gets mad one of them says glad one of them gets angry and one of them gets under a murdering Spirit and the other one gets killed by one church service notice the prophet said Cain wanted to be religious and he went made his own religion and when he did he brought it before God something like this here's the best of God this is all I can do about it now take it or leave it or if that ain't the attitude of the Leo to see you today God I ain't coming your way don't you tell me how to dress don't you tell me what to do don't you tell me this or that I won't come no more and we'll do this or that or the other why people want their own man-made religion oh God have mercy on us Lord have mercy take it early oh yeah he wants his own way that's the way he came did I heard the brother say it the other day and I shared it with several different Minister friends of mine that the prophet said man does not want to be told what to do he wants to be his own boss anybody here like that besides me rest all you Liars get up and pray through man wants to be his own boss well I think and I believe and that's what I want to do yeah you see that's your boss talking that's right notice this he believes his own ideas will get him in that's what he's saying says his own way so this is the nature of the Earthly man to come up with an Earthly religion so notice where his religion came from the Earth he was a tiller of the soil you see this is what many of us do so much of we till our soil we baby our soil we fertilize it we feed it we give it what's it what it wants oh my goodness if it don't like hard preaching we just change churches don't we if it don't like this and that we just do whatever wants so we nurture it and we love it oh don't you love yourself aren't you just absolutely no sister look at me like I'm aware don't sure you do you love yourself you have this built in you called self-preservation an element of that God gave you that but Satan anoints it to where we make idolatry out of it and then we will bring our Sacrifice from the toil of the soil here I am God what do you think am I just awesome or what am I about the greatest son you ever made on Earth I know you're setting our life in it maybe but if we could hear the way we talk and think about ourselves sometimes it might scare you Cain was more religious than Abel was he done more for the Lord he says than Abel did WOW done more for the Lord done more for the Lord than Abel did and the Lord said unto King Genesis 4 6. why art thou Ross and why is I countenance falling and then God gives him his serenity do like your brother and I will accept you you mean to tell me I've got to do like him I've got to act like him I'm older than him I'm the firstborn now watch your flesh I'm the firstborn shut up King shut up King talk to me Abel talk to me tell me who I am Abel you're a son of the Living God tell me where I'm going Abel one morning between six and nine your body's gonna be changed okay he's gonna be able to come to a change and buy the power of Abel on the inside it will turn that outside man into a brand new creature tell me Abel watch My Hope in Christ Jesus all things are yours tell me Abel is there any good promise for me in the word of God Delight thyself also on the Lord and He will give Thee the desires of thine heart I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thou Soul prosperous if any till one Earth will agree is touching anything that shall be done if he abide me and my words abide and you ask what you will and it shall be done come on with me now children if you listen to Abel do a lot of the talking you'd be a whole lot better off and still listen to Cain Run his fat mouth you're okay we'll talk you right out of your salvation he'll talk you right out of your Victory right out of your joy but you need to shut his mouth brother Donnie how am I going to do it well you've got to write to the pillar of fire just I Abel did so the spirit of God coming inside of you can have a few more minutes turn with me to the book of First Kings chapter 18 verse 21. and Elijah came unto all the people and said how long hold she between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him if Baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word oh don't you love it when the word shuts the mouth of the devil then sat Elijah unto the people I even I only remain a prophet of the Lord but baal's prophets are 450 men and the odd still ain't good for baal's Prophets one against 450 the odds still ain't good let them therefore give us two Bullocks and let them choose one Bullock for themselves I cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood and put no fire under and I will dress the other block and lay it on wood and put no fire under and call ye on the name of your gods and I will call on the name of the Lord and the god that answers by fire not by books not by ashes not by intellectual conception but the god that answers my fire let him be God praise the Lord and all the people answered and said it is well spoken they will regret that agreement it is well spoken and Elijah said of the prophets of Baal Choose You One by Lord for yourselves and dress it first for ye are many now you be little guys you know bless your little hearts you need all the all the help you can get so y'all go ahead and start first and call on the name of your Gods but put no fire under and they took the block which was given them and they dressed it and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon now here they start early in the morning their morning began that sits o'clock so they start in the morning third hour the day was nine o'clock they're still calling now noon time comes six hour of the day they'll still calling foreign [Music] man I imagine they had some singers I imagine they had some choir directors I imagine they brought out the minstrels and the tambourines and they was a harping and they was a jumping around and there was a dancing oh does anybody feed it oh yes brother I feel it I want Bales fixing to come well five after nine it still hadn't showed up 10 out of 10 he hadn't showed up we'll have him after 11 he hadn't showed up 12 out to 12. he hadn't showed up guess what they showed up cause there is no real God named Veil it is a figment of man's imagination idolatry in the form of demons oh yeah mama now watch O Brother Elijah now Oh They'll hear us but there was no voice nor any of that answered and they leaped upon the altar which is made clear to God they're getting Pentecostal bailouts so now they move and they jump up on the altar glory to God hallelujah I feel it I feel you know I'm not making fun of the real spirit of God but look how emotional they got the friend we want more that emotion does emotion come with it yes and if your religion ain't got no emotion you better bury it now watch the spirit of Elijah you see it tends to go with the Elijah spirit that people who are under it tend to ridicule and make fun of dead religion and he came to pass at noon not Elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he is a god either he is talking or pursuing or he's in a journey or maybe he's asleep oh my goodness and you can imagine you've got 450 false prophets there and you got one little bitty old skinny armed guy standing there by himself little bitty oh God that the world absolutely hated despise him and yet he gets so bold and he stands up there and ridicules notice what he's doing look at all these things that he's doing he is absolutely identifying this Theory as something that is false now of course he could not say this about his God cry alive for he is a God either he is talking which means he cannot hear and talk at the same time even I can do that and I'm certainly not a God so they're supposed to be a purity Beauty God look what he's doing to that God he is stripping him down to size either he's talking or he's pursuing as a god he's out there after somebody I'll be right back to my godship in a few minutes I'm after somebody every whole whole tide over there I'll be back in a few minutes because he can't do two things at once I'll tell you how big my God is if he's got millions of Christians all over the world that live from different time zones and the all different different zip codes and every one of them's got to have prayers answered uh you won't get my prayer you won't get yours or you won't get yours or theirs every one of us will get the right answer at the right address at the right time because our God can multitask he is the original multitasker Hallelujah he can talk he can listen he can do all this at one time because he is Elohim now that Elijah goes real low and he says he just went to sleep up here in heaven on you guys [Music] snoring so loud y'all may have to get really loud to yourself hey prayer Adventure he sleepeths and must be awake and after they cried aloud I want you to listen what people do under demonic Force they go to cutting themselves God never ask his children to cut themselves for him God don't specialize in cutting he specializes in healing cuts so now they're getting so wrapped up so they're jumping they're screaming and lodging and making them Madam all you imagine they're so mad they're Furious they're sweating and they're slobbing and they're spitting it must have been one mess and your Elijah said well call him a little louder I call under God go ahead and call it and I can't go ahead curse me by your gods that don't exist cut themselves out to their manner with knives and lancets kill the blood gosh out of and it came to pass from midday was passed they prophesied oh Lord so now they jump they screamed they've hollowed they've cut themselves with knives and lenses and now they start prophesying they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice you imagine Paul Elijah he probably went over and took a break about two o'clock having an evening siesta he's probably just absolutely wore out with all this nonsense I know exactly how I feel sometimes sometimes you just get wore out with a nonsense of people you just wish people would get really sincere with God and to see what God will do let's quit playing Church let's hide Church we've got a great place to have church what do you say we just aren't having churches we've got a great building that the spirit of God can move a moment we've got a lot of needs we've got a lot of sick boats let's just start having Church let's just let the Lord God move amongst foreign came to pass on the midday was passed they prophesied to the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded Elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the Lord Elijah Ministry is a restoration back to the original he didn't Glenn are entirely all trip and say we don't need the altar no more it was a restoration back to the altar that was broken down who broke it down bunch of these false prophets and Elijah took 12 Stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob unto whom the word of the Lord came saying Israel shall be thy name and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord he made a trench about the altar as great would contain two measures of seed and put the word in order you see God ain't scared of order as long as this divine order divine order allows you to still worship God divine order still allows you to praise the Lord come on don't get scared to order what we don't want is man-made order I love divine order oh man cut the Bullock in pieces and lay him on the wood and says fill for Byram no what you're putting water on the sacrifice and water on the wood feel for balance with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice on the wood and he said do it the second time and they did it the second time and he said do it the third poll y Hallelujah and they did it the third time and the water ran the water ran round about the Altar and filled the trench also with water it looked like to a a man in his human mind would think what are you doing you want the driest kindling you want the driest wood and if God don't do it you can be able to sneak over there rub it hard enough maybe a light on its own man you're making it totally impossible for this move to be anything other than God Ah that's exactly what we want you see we're not interested in a Reagan move we're not interested in a Ron Spencer mover a Tim Pruitt move or any other man-made move we want a move of God Almighty we don't want to move over just stirred by this preacher and that creature and that preacher goes home and you lose your Revival I want a Revival when I'm a thousand miles from brother Ron Spencer I'm 2 000 miles from another 10 foot I can still be in Revival because the Revival is down inside of my able I don't have to get around a preacher to have Revival I want to stay in Revival ball I want to stay on fire can you imagine this oh well we might as well shut the doors now down we're running this is going to be a huge embarrassment and it came to tight to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice so here it was at the evening time that Elijah the prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel let it be known this day that thou art God and Israel and that I am thy servant and that I have done all these things at Thy Word Hear Me O Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God the thou has turned oh no turned their heart back again ain't that what Malachi 4 said in the last days said Cindy Elijah and he would turn the hearts back brother Jerry and here is Elijah the Old Testament identifying with the same thing Lord turn their hearts back to what the original Apostolic teaching of the Bible so here is Elijah Oh Glory that thou has turned their heart back again then oh wow so he didn't have to go to nine o'clock at night 12 o'clock and then one o'clock and then three o'clock the next day and five o'clock the next day but as soon as the man of God spoke about restoration face then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones I am the Dust and lift up the water that was in the trench that's my God I said that's my God against all the odds oh but you see the move wasn't over yet I'm all close and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the Lord he is the god the Lord he is the god and Elijah said unto them take the prophets of Baal give them a big social security check and sign them up on Medicare and Welfare let not a one of them escape and they took them and Elijah brought him down to the brook his Sean good Lord what a thing for a man to do and slew them there and accepted worshiper let me just read another scripture in the New Testament Matthew 15 22 and behold the woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me O Lord thou son of David my daughters grievously Vex with the Devil but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away so what if one of the deacons had met you at the door this morning said look sir you're not welcome here today or told one of you ladies you're not welcome here we don't know you we ain't never seen you before you're not welcome oh I can imagine you'd have stomped out of here you'd have had it on Facebook before you ever pulled out of the parking lot you would have called the Johnson City Press Elizabeth and Starry said that church up there I'll tell you one thing I went up there and I the disciples telling Jesus would you get rid of this woman she cries after a she is nothing but a pest she's aggravating us to death but he answered and said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel and you're a gentile dog but she would not take no not even from Jesus the prophet says about the this woman she had so much faith even Jesus himself couldn't run her off Lord God let me be that kind of man but maybe that kind of person no two young people want to be that kind of young people but notice this verse then came she and worshiped him amen amen he turned her down his disciples said you know already treated her bad that didn't change her she said I'm going to be accepted I'm getting what I need and somehow it dropped in her heart key is worship your way through this worship your way through this resentment worship your way through this rejection shouldn't have a scripture there named nothing but somehow it just dropped there I want to praise him I'm going to praise him what I feel like it I'm going to praise him when I don't I'm going to crack my hands on the hands as hard I'm going to let my voice when I'm hoarse I'm going to worship him let it be said about us then Donny came and worshiped him then Brenda came then Carol came then Carrie came then you came and worshiped him and so moves his heart [Music] then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me but he answered and said it is not me to take the children's bread cast it to you you're a dog and she said amen amen I'm a dog there's two Greek words that are used for the word dog whenever Jesus said dog he used the one word which means a big dog but when she answered him she used the other Greek word used for dog which means little dog Jesus is so humbled her but she went down beneath the humidity that he placed upon him and she said that's right I know I'm a dog I have no right I had no claim but my little girl needs your touch today Lord God I say to you my little girl back there in that office needs the touch of the same master maybe some of you here today near the touch of that same Master you know so I'm not where are they of course you're not I'm not either but let's worship Him let's worship Him let's get a hold to this heart and you won't be able to tell us no You're My Healer yeah Hallelujah you're my provider you're my savior you're my king you're my everything I don't feel like praising you I don't feel like worshiping you but I'm going to do it anyhow I mean that's what I'm saying truth Lord yet the dogs he did the crumbs which fall from their master's table then Jesus answered and said unto her o woman great is thy face be it unto thee even as thou wilt Lord have mercy children this is one of the few times when Jesus in the New Testament places the outcome of the scenario in the hands of the believer oh woman greatest thy faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt but they don't reckon how she willed it the last words of the verse tell us and her daughter was made whole from that very hour why she willed it so now she would have willed that it waited till tomorrow until next week until next year that's exactly the way it would have happened brother Jim within her being dog a gentile social humiliated so embarrassed don't you see what real Faith does it goes over the top of humiliation and says I've got a need I'm desperate [Applause] accepted worshipers how many of them I got here today what do you feel like you've met God's requirement God has testified back to you you believe God will hear your prayer what do you have neither you need to move in your home moving your marriage moving your finances what do you believe what can you believe for he's only limited to what our faith if we limit him well he saved me he's saying that's all I want all my you've got a whole arcade the prophet said of all the good things of God what do you need remember I'm past 60 and I'm getting old and and all these those things supposed to just be on old people once you get Social Security and all that stuff my Bible tells me I worship of all things that I must prosper from being held even as I so prosperous I don't even believe in Divine Healing I believe in Divine health show me somewhere in the scripture where the scripture says I have to have rheumatoid arthritis show me somewhere in the scripture so whenever it says I get old I have to have Alzheimer's show me where it says it oh but it runs in my family but you've got another family tree Hallelujah you've got another family tree don't look just to the DNA of your natural family look to the DNA of God Hallelujah
