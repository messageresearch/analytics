[8:26] say just this morning, before you can
[8:29] love God, you've got to love one
[8:31] another.
[8:33] &gt;&gt; Now, how many of you want to love one
[8:34] another? How many of you really want to
[8:36] love the Lord? Well, look at your
[8:38] neighbor and tell him this. If it's a
[8:41] sister, it'll be all right to say this
[8:43] to a brother or likewise, I love you in
[8:46] the Lord.
[8:49] Now that's saying it right.
[8:54] Now we have one of the deacons get on
[8:56] you if you say it any other way.
[9:00] Amen. Ain't it good to be in the house
[9:02] of the Lord this morning? Are you glad

[16:41] that we have to do next week. But pray
[16:43] you'd help us, Lord. Lay everything

[30:18] time while they're getting here. Your
[30:20] grace and mercy has brought me through.
[30:23] Your grace and mercy
[30:30] has brought
[30:32] me through.
[30:39] [Music]
[30:45] because
[30:47] of you.
[30:52] Now I want to thank
[30:57] you
[30:59] and praise
[31:01] you.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; You too.
[31:06] For your grace and mercy,
[31:14] it's brought
[31:16] me through.
[31:20] Give our singers a nice hand this
[31:21] morning if you
[31:23] [Applause]
[31:24] [Music]
[31:34] know I drive around sometimes I just
[31:36] think about things. I was thinking these
[31:39] colleges a few years ago they set up a
[31:42] thing for the athletes and they called a
[31:43] transfer portal and it's NIL deal. It's
[31:45] something they get named for their money
[31:47] for their name, image, and likeness. And
[31:50] I was thinking that uh you know, God
[31:52] kind of had that and plans for us before
[31:54] the foundation of the world.
[31:57] He he saw me and he thought he's going
[32:00] to take on my name, my image, and he's
[32:03] going to be like me. And he also said
[32:06] they got a transfer portal and I'm about
[32:09] to enter that transfer portal and I'm
[32:11] going to transfer from here to glory.
[32:14] Amen. Glory.
[32:18] I guess I'm weird. I just think of
[32:19] things like that and I think of all
[32:21] these things the world does and I just
[32:22] like to tie it back to what Jesus does
[32:24] for me. You know,
[32:27] how many's got a lot of peace this
[32:29] morning?
[32:30] Let's sing about it.
[32:34] [Music]
[32:45] I'm so tired
[32:48] and so weary,
[32:51] but I must
[32:53] go along
[32:56] till the Lord
[32:59] comes and calls
[33:02] calls me away.
[33:05] Oh yes.
[33:08] Well, the morning
[33:11] is bright
[33:13] and the lamb.
[33:16] Oh, he's the light
[33:19] and the night.
[33:21] The night is fair
[33:25] as the day.
[33:27] Oh yes. Oh, there will be peace
[33:33] in the valley
[33:36] for me.
[33:39] Someday
[33:41] there'll be peace
[33:44] in the valley
[33:47] for me.
[33:49] Oh Lord, I pray there'll be no sadness.
[33:54] Hallelujah. No sorrow,
[33:58] no trouble.
[34:01] I'm going to see.
[34:03] There'll be peace
[34:06] in the valley
[34:09] for me. I like this verse.
[34:15] There
[34:17] will be gentle
[34:20] and the wolf
[34:23] he'll be tamed.
[34:25] And the line
[34:28] shall weigh down
[34:31] by the lamb.
[34:34] Oh yes.
[34:36] Oh, and the beast
[34:40] from the wild.
[34:42] It's going to be left
[34:44] my little child.
[34:47] And I'll be changed. Oh, changed from
[34:51] this old man.
[34:53] that I am. Well, oh yes. Hallelujah.
[34:58] Oh, there'll be peace
[35:01] in the valley
[35:04] for me
[35:07] someday.
[35:09] Oh, there'll be peace
[35:12] in the valley.
[35:15] all for me.
[35:17] Oh Lord, I pray there'll be no sadness.
[35:23] Oh, no sorrow,
[35:26] no trouble.
[35:28] I'll see.
[35:31] There'll be peace
[35:34] in the valley
[35:37] for me. Let's sing that second verse
[35:39] again.
[35:40] Oh, will the pair
[35:45] will be gentle
[35:47] and the wolf
[35:50] he'll be tamed
[35:52] and the lion
[35:55] shall lay down.
[35:58] Oh by the lamb.
[36:01] Oh yes.
[36:03] Oh, and the beast
[36:06] from the wild.
[36:09] It's going to be led
[36:11] my little child.
[36:14] And I'll be changed. Changed from this
[36:18] old creature. Oh, that I am. Oh, yes.
[36:24] Will there be peace? Thank you, Lord. in
[36:28] the valley
[36:30] for me
[36:33] someday.
[36:35] Oh, there'll be peace
[36:38] in the valley.
[36:41] Oh, for me, oh Lord, I pray. Oh,
[36:46] there'll be no sadness. Think about it.
[36:49] Oh, no sorrow,
[36:52] no more trouble
[36:54] I'll ever see.
[36:57] Oh, there'll be peace
[36:59] in the valley
[37:02] for me.
[37:06] Oh, there'll be no sadness,
[37:10] no more sorrow,
[37:12] no more trouble.
[37:15] The bride will ever sing.
[37:18] There'll be peace
[37:20] in the valley
[37:23] for me.
[37:26] Oh yes.
[37:28] [Music]
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[37:31] [Music]
[37:41] [Music]
[37:54] Oh, heaven must be a beautiful place.
[38:01] Oh, heaven
[38:04] must be a beautiful place.
[38:10] Oh, I know
[38:12] that heaven is a beautiful
[38:17] place
[38:19] and it's filled
[38:21] with nothing but my Jesus grace.
[38:27] Oh, and heaven
[38:30] is a place that I long to see.
[38:35] Oh,
[38:36] heaven
[38:38] is a place that I long to see.
[38:45] Oh, heaven
[38:47] is a place that I long to see.
[38:53] And Jesus
[38:56] died and he went there for me.
[39:01] Oh, and I'm home.
[39:04] my way home. Don't you want to go?
[39:09] Oh, I'm on my way home. Don't you want
[39:15] to go?
[39:18] Oh, I'm on my way home. Don't you want
[39:24] to go?
[39:28] See, I've
[39:30] got a home on the other shore. Oh.
[39:35] Oh. And we've come
[39:38] too far to turn back now.
[39:44] Oh, I've come
[39:47] too far to turn back now.
[39:53] Oh, I've come
[39:55] too far to turn back now.
[40:02] See Jesus
[40:04] said, "I'm going to help you."
[40:10] And I'm going
[40:12] to a place that he's prepared for me.
[40:18] Oh, I'm going
[40:21] to that place he's prepared for me.
[40:27] Oh, I'm going
[40:30] to that place. He's prepared
[40:33] for me.
[40:37] There's no dying, no crying there.
[40:44] Oh, and heaven
[40:47] must be a beautiful place.
[40:52] Oh, in heaven it must be a beautiful
[40:58] place.
[41:01] So in heaven
[41:04] must be a beautiful place
[41:10] for it's filled
[41:12] with nothing but my Jesus grace. And
[41:16] we've come too far. Oh, and I've come
[41:21] too far to turn back now.
[41:24] [Applause]
[41:26] Oh, I've come
[41:29] too far to turn back now.
[41:36] Oh, I've come
[41:38] too far to turn back now.
[41:44] See Jesus
[41:47] said he'll help you make some time.
[41:52] Oh, I'm on my way home. Don't you want
[41:57] to go? Are you coming along?
[42:00] Oh, I'm on my way home. Don't you want
[42:06] to go?
[42:10] Oh, I'm on my way home. Don't you want
[42:14] to go?
[42:18] See, I've
[42:20] got a home on the other shore.
[42:26] Oh, and heaven
[42:29] must be a beautiful place.
[42:35] Oh, heaven
[42:37] must be a beautiful place.
[42:43] Oh, how heaven
[42:46] must be a beautiful place.
[42:52] For it's filled
[42:54] with nothing but my Jesus grace.
[43:00] Oh, and it's filled
[43:03] with nothing but my Jesus
[43:08] grace.
[43:17] [Music]
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[43:23] &gt;&gt; thank you, Jesus.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; And that's your home we're singing
[43:27] about.
[43:29] Wow. If heaven was full of cabins, there
[43:33] were no mansions.
[43:36] The roads were dirt,
[43:38] gravel, and the best heaven had to offer
[43:41] was black top.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; It'd be so much better than the place
[43:45] we're living now.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; I've thought about it, you know, to live
[43:49] in the first century when the Lord Jesus
[43:51] would have been here. What an awesome
[43:54] thing it must have been to been around
[43:56] him, hear his words,
[43:59] and contemplate what was said. And
[44:03] please don't misunderstand me, but I
[44:06] would rather live right now and be here
[44:09] today in this church and be a part of
[44:13] you and a part of this move of God in
[44:15] this hour than I would to have lived in
[44:18] the first century
[44:20] and had their experience
[44:24] &gt;&gt; before the Holy Ghost came.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Before the Holy Ghost came. Yes.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Now remember what kind of people they
[44:32] were. They were good people,
[44:35] &gt;&gt; but they were as blind as they could be
[44:37] to many things.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; I'd rather stand where I stand right
[44:41] here today.
[44:43] Because those of you that are truly born
[44:45] of the spirit of God and have an
[44:48] understanding of the word, you actually
[44:50] have a greater understanding right now
[44:53] than what Peter did
[44:55] &gt;&gt; when he was going about preaching the
[44:56] gospel, casting out devils, and doing
[44:59] all kinds of great things in Matthew 10
[45:02] because he didn't have the Holy Ghost.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; What an age to live in.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; And that was the beginning. This is the
[45:10] end.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now remember, God increases his
[45:14] glory as he goes along, but he hides it.
[45:19] So looking at the tabernacle in Shiloh
[45:22] to see what God did there must have been
[45:24] absolutely awesome. And they're still
[45:26] finding more archaeological finds in
[45:30] Shiloh after all these thousands of
[45:32] years. Things that are proving one thing
[45:37] after another after another that the
[45:40] scripture is exactly true. Just recently
[45:42] they found what they think is where the
[45:44] tabernacle itself sat and they found
[45:48] thousands of animal bones which were
[45:52] sheep, goats and cattle and they were
[45:56] all from one side of the animal. So they
[46:00] were just layered one on top of another
[46:02] on top of another. Now, those of you
[46:04] that know your Bible in the book of
[46:05] Leviticus know that there was only one
[46:08] side of the animal that was offered and
[46:12] the other side was given to the priest.
[46:15] So, one thing after another. I don't
[46:18] need archaeological finds and rocks and
[46:21] sticks and dirt and all that thing, but
[46:23] I just love it when they find it.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; It don't give me more faith. It just
[46:28] solidifies the faith that I've already
[46:30] got. I can believe him without a rock or
[46:33] a stick or a piece of dirt. Can't you?
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; But I sure like it when they find it.
[46:38] God bless you. How y'all doing today?
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Doing good. Praise the Lord. Ain't God
[46:43] good to us all?
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[46:48] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Certainly
[46:51] appreciate you praying for us in the
[46:52] meetings this week. Brother Wayne just
[46:54] did an outstanding job and so good to
[46:56] see the different saints and ministers
[46:59] from different churches and places and
[47:02] uh for those of you that streamed and
[47:03] those of you that were there I saw a few
[47:05] of you that were there but there was
[47:07] tremendous amount of needs that were um
[47:11] made known there to the saints and a lot
[47:13] of them still didn't get met of course
[47:15] but I think it total over half a million
[47:18] dollars 500 something,000
[47:22] was the needs of what they needed. Um,
[47:25] and they wound up getting a little over
[47:27] 180, which was still a tremendous amount
[47:31] uh for the attendance that was there.
[47:34] But, you know, our church has helped
[47:36] people around the world for many, many
[47:37] years. And once we was building our
[47:39] building, of course, we were um a little
[47:42] bit held back because of that. But um
[47:45] now that the Lord has helped us to where
[47:46] we are financially, I'd like us to to
[47:49] start taking some more of these things
[47:51] on our hearts. Um, having been there and
[47:54] seen a lot of these things, I'll tell
[47:56] you, it just it does something to you
[47:58] when our our brothers are not like
[48:00] Americans, brothers in the Philippines,
[48:02] Africa, and India. They go out and they
[48:05] have tent meetings or just under a tree
[48:07] or brush harbor type thing or whatever.
[48:09] And they will preach the message and
[48:11] there will be denominational people that
[48:13] will come and they are constantly
[48:16] leading denominational people and
[48:18] pastors to the message. And then of
[48:21] course they baptize them and then guess
[48:23] what the denomination does? They kick
[48:25] them out of their church
[48:27] &gt;&gt; because the denomination paid for it. So
[48:30] then these saints have no place to
[48:32] worship. So a lot of these needs that
[48:34] were mentioned there were some of them
[48:35] were that way. So they're meeting under
[48:37] a tree. I myself have preached under a
[48:39] big gigantic tree in in Kenya one time.
[48:42] A brother had contacted me a few years
[48:44] ago and he was there as a little boy
[48:46] whenever I was there. Had malaria which
[48:48] was incurable. come up for prayer
[48:51] totally gone from his body.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; That's our God.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; So, if God showed up under a tree,
[48:58] what can he do here for us today?
[49:01] &gt;&gt; So, I'd like for us to just, you know,
[49:03] take it on your heart and uh that if the
[49:06] Lord would help us to do things, some of
[49:07] them need churches, some of them need um
[49:10] roofs, some of them have a building,
[49:12] have an outside walls. And uh might be
[49:15] surprising to a lot of you, but in
[49:16] Africa they still make their brick like
[49:19] they did in the days of Pharaoh.
[49:22] I was in Uganda several years ago and I
[49:24] saw where they they take little tiny
[49:26] moles and they take the uh the Nile the
[49:29] white Nile actually is right there. I
[49:31] stayed right on the white Nile 50 ft
[49:32] from it whenever I was there. Um so it
[49:35] begins in Uganda began in Uganda then
[49:37] goes to Egypt. But I saw all kinds of
[49:41] Eskim Mo looking things. I thought,
[49:43] "What in the world is that?" So, it's
[49:46] kind of round top like this, but you
[49:48] could tell it was made out of brick. And
[49:50] actually, they had made the brick and
[49:52] take little moles and mix up that dirt
[49:54] and water and straw and just put it in
[49:57] there and they let it air dry for a bit.
[49:59] And then they build this Eskimo looking
[50:01] thing and they make it hollow in the
[50:03] middle. They fill it with these brick,
[50:05] but then they leave a door opening where
[50:07] they can go in and keep adding wood to
[50:10] the fire. And what they're doing,
[50:13] killing their own brick. K I L N, not K
[50:17] I L L,
[50:19] but killing their own brick. And they've
[50:22] they've done that. So it's not like our
[50:24] brothers and sisters in these parts of
[50:25] the world are asking us to do everything
[50:27] for them. You Americans just, you know,
[50:29] do it for us because you all owe it to
[50:31] us. They're not doing that. They do
[50:33] everything that they can do. So some of
[50:36] the buildings um actually had brick
[50:38] walls, no roof, no shutters, no shingles
[50:42] rather I should say cuz there they use
[50:44] iron sheets. But some of them had no
[50:47] roof. Some of them had no windows, no
[50:48] doors. Some of them had no plaster on
[50:51] the walls. Some of them had no floors.
[50:53] You talking about a time you get several
[50:55] hundred Africans together in a dirt
[50:57] floor.
[50:59] And they ain't like you white people,
[51:00] they don't just stand there and look at
[51:02] the song.
[51:04] That's right.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; I mean, they clap their hands and
[51:06] worship God. And And you talking about a
[51:09] dust cloud.
[51:12] Hallelujah. So, God bless you. Let's
[51:14] let's keep these hearts or these needs
[51:16] rather in our hearts before the Lord. It
[51:18] just tears me up whenever I see them and
[51:20] and hear about them and having been
[51:23] there in a lot of those countries
[51:24] myself. So, we just thank the Lord for
[51:27] what he's helped us to be able to do.
[51:29] I'd just like to do more if we could.
[51:32] So, we're grateful for all those that
[51:33] were there to meetings and uh uh the
[51:36] ministering of the word. And people
[51:38] sacrificed their time. Some of them took
[51:40] their vacation. They had to pay their
[51:42] hotel rooms. They had to pay their gas.
[51:43] They had to pay their food bills while
[51:45] they were there. And then many of them
[51:47] donated a part of their living to be
[51:50] able to do these things for the bride
[51:51] around the world. 52 years they've had
[51:54] this camp meeting there. And every year
[51:56] it's been for these types of things. I
[51:59] told Brother Joe the other night before
[52:01] we come out, I said, "I want to be
[52:02] standing near you that day when the Lord
[52:06] calls Brother Henry Green up first,
[52:08] which was his daddy and then Brother Dan
[52:10] Daisy, now Brother Joe as the Lord calls
[52:13] them up before his throne and the
[52:16] thousands times thousands of people,
[52:18] maybe even hundreds of thousands that
[52:20] have been so blessed and so helped by
[52:23] the vision of that little church." If
[52:24] you've ever been to Brother Joe's, you
[52:26] know it's not a mega church. It's a
[52:28] small church, but they've been able to
[52:31] do so much for the kingdom of God. And
[52:33] not just them. They've been a a funnel
[52:36] by which people could be able to um
[52:39] donate and give. And I know for sure
[52:41] that one church in this meeting donated
[52:44] $100,000. So, I thought that was
[52:47] wonderful for the Lord. And then
[52:49] different people giving different things
[52:50] and stuff. So, I just wanted to make
[52:52] that known to you today. Let's read in
[52:55] second Peter chapter 1.
[52:59] Beginning with verse two,
[53:02] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[53:07] through the knowledge of God. Isn't it
[53:08] amazing that grace and peace reaches its
[53:13] multiplied form through the knowledge of
[53:16] God.
[53:18] Through the knowledge of God and of
[53:21] Jesus our Lord. according as his divine
[53:24] power has given unto us all things that
[53:27] pertain unto life and godliness
[53:31] through the knowledge of him that hath
[53:33] called us to glory and virtue whereby
[53:37] are given unto us exceeding and great
[53:39] precious promises that that by these ye
[53:43] might be partakers
[53:46] of the divine nature, having escaped the
[53:48] corruption that is in the world through
[53:50] lust and beside this giving all
[53:52] diligence
[53:54] add to your faith virtue. So I have a
[53:58] question for you. If these things, these
[54:01] seven things, and then they're capped
[54:02] off by the eighths, if these seven
[54:05] things are only given by God, how can we
[54:09] add them?
[54:13] Now, Peter says it plainly, beside this,
[54:14] giving all diligence, add to your faith
[54:18] virtue. So tell me, how do I go about?
[54:20] You're free to and you're free to
[54:22] respond to me. How can I go about adding
[54:25] more virtue? How can I add more
[54:27] knowledge? How can I add more of these
[54:29] divine things when they're only
[54:31] God-given? Well, as far as me and you
[54:33] doing it oursel, we can't. But what God
[54:36] wants us to do is as we're growing and
[54:39] climbing up this mountain of God, he
[54:42] accomplishes in us each one of these
[54:44] virtues.
[54:46] And then he wants us to be able to
[54:49] acknowledge
[54:50] that we have arrived.
[54:53] And then from that point on, we say,
[54:55] "I'm ready for the next one. I'm ready.
[54:58] I added to myself by saying what he
[55:03] said." So he's worked in me faith. He's
[55:05] worked in me virtue. He's worked in me
[55:08] knowledge. Instead of constantly
[55:10] spending the rest of your life on
[55:12] foundation one
[55:13] &gt;&gt; and thinking you ain't got nothing. Come
[55:16] on.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Add it, friends. Look at your life. See
[55:19] where you are.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Add to your faith virtue, and to virtue
[55:23] knowledge, and to knowledge temperance,
[55:26] and to temperance patience, and to
[55:29] patience godliness, and to godliness,
[55:32] brotherly kindness, and to brotherly
[55:34] kindness. Here's the eighth. Charity.
[55:37] Charity, which is God himself. How many
[55:40] to be remembered today as we pray? God
[55:42] bless you. Heavenly Father, it's such an
[55:45] honor to be able to stand before your
[55:46] children again today, Lord. And we want
[55:49] you to know that we're indeed grateful
[55:51] for the opportunity that's given to us
[55:53] to be able to walk in the light of the
[55:55] day. We're so grateful, Father, that
[55:58] we're not living in just the mere
[56:00] shadows of a man who lived over 2,000
[56:03] years ago or the shadows or the
[56:06] historical events that happened at the
[56:08] cross and the resurrection and the
[56:11] historical events that happened in the
[56:12] book of Acts. But we can testify today
[56:15] that you are the same yesterday, today,
[56:18] and forever. We thank you that you have
[56:21] been uh mindful of us to help us to be
[56:25] partakers of these great things. Speak
[56:27] to us today, Father. We know as your
[56:29] prophet has taught us, we come to church
[56:31] to find out where our shortcomings are,
[56:34] to find where we are and where we need
[56:36] to move up to. So we pray you'd help us
[56:38] today, Father, in the name of Jesus. And
[56:41] the saints said,
[56:42] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[56:43] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's look at the meaning
[56:44] of this word. You may be seated again in
[56:46] verse six. on patience. I know y'all
[56:48] were hoping I'm done with patience, but
[56:50] you're patiently waiting for me to
[56:51] preach on patience so you can get all
[56:53] the patience you need so we can move to
[56:55] the next one. Right.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Well, are you been worked on? Praise the
[56:59] Lord. Well, good. Thank God. Amen. And
[57:02] to knowledge, temperance, and to
[57:04] temperance, patience, which is enduring
[57:08] patience, patient continuence, patient
[57:11] waiting, steadfastness. in the New
[57:14] Testament, the characteristic of a man
[57:16] who is not swerved from his deliberate
[57:20] purpose and his loyalty to faith and
[57:24] piety by even the greatest trials, the
[57:29] greatest trials and sufferings. How many
[57:32] are going through probably some of the
[57:34] greatest trials you've ever went through
[57:36] in your life?
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; And how are you going to come out on the
[57:40] other side? Well, that's going to depend
[57:42] upon your patience. You see, Brother
[57:44] Donnie, don't you believe that we're
[57:46] elected? I do. And I believe these
[57:49] things are attributes that God wants his
[57:51] elect to have, not just talk about. And
[57:55] we've had pictures of the pyramid and
[57:57] all that sort of thing. We love all of
[57:58] that. I don't want just the memorabilia
[58:01] associated with it. I want it a reality
[58:04] not only in me, but in you. And you when
[58:07] you listen to this, you'll hear the
[58:09] prophet as he spoke to the tabernacle
[58:11] there. And he said that he had labored
[58:13] for years and years for these things to
[58:16] be found in the lives of those people
[58:19] there. Well, by the grace of God, I'm
[58:21] trying to do the same thing. And so is
[58:23] every other God called man. So what is
[58:26] going to be the o the opposite of
[58:29] patience? Well, it's going to be
[58:31] impatience. So it can now this is
[58:33] something tricky about impatience and
[58:36] how that it can do. Impatience doesn't
[58:39] always say that it will not happen.
[58:42] Impatience doesn't always say it never
[58:45] will happen. It's not true. It can
[58:47] happen. Impatience will look at it and
[58:50] say, "Well, yeah, I I believe it can.
[58:52] But when will it happen? I'm asking God
[58:55] for healing. I'm asking God for my son,
[58:57] my daughter, my husband for a financial
[59:00] move and I've been waiting and waiting
[59:02] and there's been no deliverance and then
[59:05] how how long do I wait? Well, patience
[59:07] would say you keep waiting until God
[59:09] moves. But impatience will move upon us
[59:13] and then we will try to start fixing it
[59:16] ourself. or we will see other people in
[59:20] the way that they have gone and we will
[59:23] be influenced by their decision and then
[59:26] we will decide well you know what that
[59:28] worked for brother Rob maybe I'm going
[59:29] to try the same thing just because
[59:31] something worked for brother Rob don't
[59:33] mean it'll work for you God may have a
[59:35] total different plan for you same with
[59:37] me same with any of you brothers and
[59:38] sisters here and the thing of it is that
[59:40] we go to him who brought us here and say
[59:43] Lord why am I here what is my purpose of
[59:45] being there you just want me to go to
[59:46] church every now come and then sing a
[59:48] song, play a guitar, you want me to
[59:49] just, you know, do whatever it is I do.
[59:51] No, we got to go to him and say, "What
[59:53] is my complete fulfillment of the
[59:56] objective that you had in your mind
[59:58] before the foundation of the world?"
[1:00:00] Now, watch how that God always will will
[1:00:03] say his word and then he will give Satan
[1:00:06] an opportunity to try the recipients of
[1:00:10] that word and see if they will believe
[1:00:12] it. Will they hold out? Will they wait?
[1:00:15] Will they be faithful? Will they be
[1:00:17] patient until God brings it to pass? Or
[1:00:21] will they accept a copycat or a twin? A
[1:00:26] twin that will look so much like what
[1:00:29] they're asking for that they would they
[1:00:31] would not even question it. Now, keep in
[1:00:33] your mind that when you're praying for a
[1:00:36] supernatural something that Satan hears
[1:00:39] you when you pray. So then if he cannot
[1:00:42] get you to doubt it, then he has the
[1:00:44] ability to try to make a twin that will
[1:00:48] look so much like your answer. I wonder
[1:00:51] if any of us have ever accepted that
[1:00:53] twin in our life. And we thought, "Oh,
[1:00:56] praise the Lord. This is it. This is it.
[1:00:58] I've been praying about this certain
[1:01:00] certain thing. Thank you, Lord. Thank
[1:01:01] you, Lord." And then whenever you
[1:01:03] received it and it grew up, you realized
[1:01:06] you accepted the wrong answer. But you
[1:01:09] know what? Had it been a demon with
[1:01:11] horns on its head and real ugly and
[1:01:14] scary, you would have never accepted
[1:01:16] that. There's no way you would have ever
[1:01:18] took it. So what does Satan do? He tries
[1:01:22] to hide it behind whatever your
[1:01:25] personality will identify it as being an
[1:01:28] answer from God. Now that's tricky, is
[1:01:31] it not? Now everybody because their
[1:01:33] personality is so different, they will
[1:01:35] look for different answers and it will
[1:01:37] come in different ways. they think and
[1:01:40] then Satan knows you. As a matter of
[1:01:41] fact, it'd probably be frightening how
[1:01:43] well he knows all of us. But so he will
[1:01:45] mimic an answer of God and generally
[1:01:49] knowing how impatient that we as humans
[1:01:51] are, he will send it before God sends
[1:01:55] his because God develops our patience by
[1:01:58] us waiting. But Satan knows how
[1:02:01] impatient we are. So he'll give us
[1:02:03] enough time to where that our impatience
[1:02:06] will build. and were at that desperate
[1:02:09] spot. Some of the biggest mistakes I've
[1:02:11] ever made in my life was whenever I felt
[1:02:14] pressured and in a hurry to make a
[1:02:17] decision about something. Anybody ever
[1:02:19] been there besides me? Oh yeah. I've
[1:02:21] made some bad mistakes because of that.
[1:02:24] Wasn't even sin. I ain't talking about
[1:02:25] sin. I'm just talking about run ahead of
[1:02:28] the program of God or jump ahead because
[1:02:30] you were being pressured by, you know,
[1:02:32] circumstance or individuals. And Satan
[1:02:35] knows exactly how to mimic an answer
[1:02:38] from God, but just make it a little bit
[1:02:42] different than the will of God, knowing
[1:02:44] that we're impatiently waiting and our
[1:02:47] patience is about to run out.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Now, we looked at the children of Israel
[1:02:52] just a little bit last Sunday, and it
[1:02:53] didn't quite get done with that. So, I'd
[1:02:55] like to look at it again if you don't
[1:02:56] mind. In 1st Samuel 8:4, then all the
[1:03:00] elders of Israel gathered themselves
[1:03:02] together and came to and to Samuel unto
[1:03:05] Rama and said unto him, "Behold, thou
[1:03:08] art old, and thy sons walk not in thy
[1:03:10] ways. Now make us a king to judge us
[1:03:14] like all the nations." Now, there was
[1:03:17] something in them. They wanted a king.
[1:03:21] And God actually wanted them to have
[1:03:24] that desire. God was the one who gave
[1:03:28] them a desire to have a king that would
[1:03:32] rule over them. Now listen to this. God
[1:03:35] was the one who gave them the desire and
[1:03:38] they looked at it and thought this must
[1:03:40] be the time. So they began to
[1:03:44] acknowledge that there was a need there.
[1:03:46] They were different than all the rest of
[1:03:48] the nations around them. All of them had
[1:03:50] kings. Hittites, Amorites, Jebusites,
[1:03:53] you know, even archaeological finds are
[1:03:55] still finding many of these things to
[1:03:56] where the it would name the kings and so
[1:03:59] on that were there. So they looked
[1:04:00] around everybody that was around them
[1:04:02] and everybody had this except for them.
[1:04:05] So everybody that was there in that day
[1:04:07] was organized.
[1:04:09] Oo, they were organized. So that have a
[1:04:12] king, that have a military general, that
[1:04:14] have, you know, all these people that
[1:04:16] have secretaries of this and secretaries
[1:04:18] of that. and then they would have an
[1:04:20] organization to where they were
[1:04:22] organized. But Israel, it wasn't that
[1:04:24] way. So they lived in their tents and
[1:04:26] they plowed their fields and they raised
[1:04:27] their crops and they raised their
[1:04:29] children and they went to church, you
[1:04:31] know, and they did all these things that
[1:04:32] God said, but there was no organization
[1:04:35] to their move. All they had, all they
[1:04:38] had, I don't even want to say it that
[1:04:40] way, but all they had was a prophet with
[1:04:44] direct contact from the presence of God.
[1:04:48] That's all they had, which in reality
[1:04:51] was all they needed.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; But you see, compared to the rest of the
[1:04:56] organized world, then it seemed like
[1:04:59] they had nothing. So maybe they'd meet
[1:05:01] some of these people in the market.
[1:05:02] Well, how's your king? Oh, we don't have
[1:05:04] a king. Well, what about the board of
[1:05:06] treasury? Well, we don't actually even
[1:05:08] have that. Well, what about this? What
[1:05:10] about the alderman? What sheriff, the
[1:05:12] county deputy, the magister? We don't
[1:05:14] have any of that. We're not even we're
[1:05:16] not even set up that way. Well, what do
[1:05:18] you all have? All we got is one old man
[1:05:21] and his name is Samuel. And he says God
[1:05:23] speaks to him and shows visions. You
[1:05:25] mean every one of you go by what that
[1:05:28] one man says? Yeah. Well, I've heard you
[1:05:31] all was a cult. Now I'm convinced that
[1:05:34] you are
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; because you ain't got nobody to check
[1:05:37] that one man out. So you all are
[1:05:40] definitely following a cult.
[1:05:45] Wow. So, they were not organized. So,
[1:05:48] they looked around and they thought, you
[1:05:49] know what we need to our move is some
[1:05:53] organization. Now, we're not want to run
[1:05:55] God off. We're not one. We need God. We
[1:05:57] love him. We want him to be there. But
[1:05:59] what's wrong with mixing God with a
[1:06:02] little bit of organization? So, we want
[1:06:04] to organize. And we know if we have a
[1:06:06] king, it'll be one that we can all look
[1:06:08] at and he'll get on his throne every now
[1:06:10] and then or his paloquin, you know, or
[1:06:12] whatever it was, his bar and he'll come
[1:06:14] through the city and we'll all be able
[1:06:16] to wave our flags at him and we'll just
[1:06:18] have a great time and he'll set holidays
[1:06:20] and special days and we'll be able to
[1:06:23] see our king. Now, God's invisible and
[1:06:25] he appears as a cloud and a bush and
[1:06:28] different things like that. But we would
[1:06:29] like something that we could see all the
[1:06:32] time. Something that would be with us
[1:06:34] day in day out. And if our enemies come
[1:06:37] against us, our king will step up in the
[1:06:40] window. My way up high, way higher than
[1:06:42] that. And he'll step up there and he'll
[1:06:44] stand up there and wave at us like this.
[1:06:46] And we'll all say, "Oh, great king, live
[1:06:48] forever. Oh great king, live forever."
[1:06:51] And we'll see the men standing all
[1:06:52] around him. here they'll come and blow
[1:06:54] the horns and the trumpets. Wow, won't
[1:06:56] that be something? And Samuel said,
[1:06:58] "What
[1:06:59] you mean? You all want an organization
[1:07:03] over the top of God's word? This is
[1:07:05] God's system. This is the way God chose
[1:07:09] for it to be." Now naturally it's going
[1:07:11] to look like to some of the people that
[1:07:14] he's trying to preserve his position of
[1:07:17] leadership because naturally since he's
[1:07:20] the voice of God then he is naturally
[1:07:23] going to defend his position. So sure
[1:07:27] why absolutely job security you know and
[1:07:30] and what in the world can we expect from
[1:07:32] somebody who's been doing all this for
[1:07:34] all these years and all of us bow down
[1:07:37] to his whms and if he says this is wrong
[1:07:40] then I guess it's wrong we ain't got no
[1:07:42] written Bible and they didn't have as
[1:07:44] far as a Bible itself five books of
[1:07:46] Moses and they didn't have all these
[1:07:48] articles of the New Testament they
[1:07:50] didn't have Naam they didn't have all
[1:07:51] the different ones after that so this
[1:07:53] guy gets things from God that we can't
[1:07:55] even prove it. We He He says God tells
[1:07:58] him things that we can't even find in
[1:08:01] the first five books of Moses. And yet
[1:08:03] if we don't do it, we get in trouble
[1:08:05] with God, man. And it ain't no wonder
[1:08:08] that he don't want us to have a king.
[1:08:11] But you know what God done whenever God
[1:08:13] had heard Samuel's cry? Now watch. Look
[1:08:16] in verse six. But the thing displeased
[1:08:18] Samuel when they said, "Give us a king
[1:08:20] to judge us." And Samuel prayed unto the
[1:08:22] Lord. Natur that's what he always done.
[1:08:25] And the Lord said unto Samuel, hearken
[1:08:26] unto the voice of the people and all
[1:08:29] that they say unto thee, for they have
[1:08:30] not rejected thee, but they have
[1:08:33] rejected me that I should not reign over
[1:08:36] them. So God was already reigning in the
[1:08:40] position of invisible king. So it wasn't
[1:08:44] that God was going to be their king in
[1:08:47] the future. He would be in flesh, but he
[1:08:50] already was in the invisible realm and
[1:08:54] giving what was necessary, his word, to
[1:08:56] his prophet messenger. And God told
[1:08:59] Samuel, "Look, they've not rejected you.
[1:09:02] They've rejected me. You'll go on and
[1:09:04] still be their prophet, but they have
[1:09:06] rejected my headship."
[1:09:09] Now notice, they have rejected, not
[1:09:11] rejected thee, but they have rejected
[1:09:13] me, that I should not reign over them.
[1:09:16] According to all the works which they
[1:09:18] have done since the day that I brought
[1:09:20] them out of Egypt, even unto this day,
[1:09:22] wherewith they have forsaken me, and
[1:09:24] served other gods, so do they also unto
[1:09:28] thee. Now, was God going to become their
[1:09:31] visible king? He was. And what did they
[1:09:34] do? They got ahead of God because they
[1:09:37] wanted to be like everybody else. It
[1:09:39] won't be but just a few more years. If
[1:09:42] time goes on, it won't be but a few more
[1:09:45] settings of the sun that we will find an
[1:09:49] element of people around this message
[1:09:52] that will be tired of being led in the
[1:09:55] same way the children of Israel were.
[1:09:58] through God sending a message to a
[1:10:01] prophet and that prophet's message would
[1:10:04] carry the bride right on up to the
[1:10:06] rapture and give her everything that she
[1:10:09] needed for the rapture. But there will
[1:10:12] be an element of people already are
[1:10:14] actually and they will gain number
[1:10:16] though and they will start wanting to
[1:10:19] rebel against that. Well, you know, we
[1:10:21] we we need this and and we need that and
[1:10:24] we need something else added to it
[1:10:27] because, you know, the prophet was
[1:10:29] illiterate and my that this message
[1:10:31] stopped in ' 65 and we've went so much
[1:10:34] farther now and we need something else.
[1:10:36] So, you know what? I've been reading the
[1:10:38] books of this guy and the books of this
[1:10:40] guy and that one and that one. I think
[1:10:41] we might need to merge some of this
[1:10:44] stuff into it. Oh, I know some of you
[1:10:46] sitting there big eyed and looking at me
[1:10:48] and you think it'll never happen. Oh, it
[1:10:49] will happen. You mark it down in your
[1:10:51] little book. It's already happening.
[1:10:53] Why? Because people around the message,
[1:10:56] everyone around this message are not
[1:10:58] born again. That all of them don't have
[1:11:00] the Holy Ghost just because they say God
[1:11:02] sent a prophet. No. And they will want
[1:11:05] the way of organized religion. Now, they
[1:11:07] will not go to the world. They're not
[1:11:10] going to join Catholicism. Many of them
[1:11:12] will never leave the message and go to a
[1:11:14] Baptist church or something like that,
[1:11:16] church of God or assembly. But they will
[1:11:18] want to just kind of pull out and hang
[1:11:20] around on the fringes of the message.
[1:11:23] Now, they don't want to totally deny it,
[1:11:25] but you know, then they'll get a
[1:11:27] preacher that's looking for fame or
[1:11:28] whatever more, and then he will start
[1:11:30] building his own agenda, and he'll say,
[1:11:33] "Well, we believe the prophet as long as
[1:11:35] the prophet is in the scripture."
[1:11:38] Oh, we'll believe the prophet as long as
[1:11:40] I can prove him in the scripture. So,
[1:11:42] you see who your absolute is becoming,
[1:11:44] don't you? the eye that's doing the
[1:11:47] talking. It's not the scripture nor the
[1:11:49] message. It's that I man. Well, praise
[1:11:52] the Lord. But you see, no matter how
[1:11:54] long it goes on, if I live a few more
[1:11:57] years and die, if I die after today's
[1:11:59] sermon, and you all go on and the Lord
[1:12:01] carries for a few more years, I believe
[1:12:03] there'll be an element of people around
[1:12:05] the world that will still be true to
[1:12:07] this message because this is God's
[1:12:10] message and it is his requirement. Now,
[1:12:12] no doubt among the people of Israel,
[1:12:14] there were people that were
[1:12:16] brokenhearted. They were brokenhearted,
[1:12:19] brother Joel, because they knew this was
[1:12:21] not the will of God. But what could they
[1:12:24] do? They were outnumbered. So the
[1:12:26] voices, and it must have been a majority
[1:12:29] enough that God said, "You might as well
[1:12:32] give it to them because that's what they
[1:12:34] want. It's not my will. It's not what I
[1:12:37] told you, but it's what they want. And
[1:12:40] they're not going to go on." Now God is
[1:12:42] going to bless it. What is it?
[1:12:44] Permissive will, permissive will. But
[1:12:47] God himself wanted to be their king. Now
[1:12:50] notice in the simian church age book and
[1:12:53] the in the days of Israel when they left
[1:12:55] Egypt, they were under the leadership of
[1:12:57] the spirit of God me manifesting in
[1:13:00] gifts. God was the leader of the people.
[1:13:03] Actually, he was their king. Amen. He
[1:13:07] was a father king. Now notice the
[1:13:10] difference between Israel and the rest
[1:13:13] of the nations. They were going to have
[1:13:15] a king, but he would not be a father
[1:13:18] king. But God wanted to be a king. All
[1:13:21] right? But he also wanted to be their
[1:13:24] father. Not another king could do that.
[1:13:26] So God wanted to be their father king.
[1:13:29] So he would love them in a two-fold way
[1:13:32] that even David or Solomon or any of the
[1:13:35] great kings that would follow years
[1:13:36] later would ever be able to love them
[1:13:38] the same. So what did they do? They
[1:13:40] accepted a substitute and they accepted
[1:13:44] half of what God wanted them to have.
[1:13:48] Now they wanted a king that would love
[1:13:51] the his people as subjects which many of
[1:13:54] them did and they served the people
[1:13:56] faithfully for many years. The ideal
[1:13:58] reign of a king on Israel was 40 years.
[1:14:01] Most of you know that 40 years was an
[1:14:03] ideal reign. If a man obeyed the Lord
[1:14:06] and followed in the commandment of God,
[1:14:08] God would at least give him a 40-year
[1:14:11] reign. When a man displeased the Lord,
[1:14:14] then the Lord would cut him off, cut off
[1:14:17] his posterity and his name many times
[1:14:19] and cut it short of that ideal span that
[1:14:23] God had chosen himself. And yet they
[1:14:26] would love them and they would fight for
[1:14:28] them. But not one of them kings as great
[1:14:30] as they were could ever feel toward them
[1:14:32] people the way God could. And the church
[1:14:35] said it's the same way with a pastor,
[1:14:38] you know, that belongs under the oposes
[1:14:40] of a denominational headship. And he can
[1:14:42] only preach what that denomination will
[1:14:44] let him preach. And if he goes to
[1:14:46] preaching things outside the word, you
[1:14:48] know what they call is the word, then
[1:14:50] you know what they're going to do?
[1:14:51] They're going to warn him. and that if
[1:14:53] they don't line up, they're going to
[1:14:54] boot him out.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Do they love the people? No doubt they
[1:14:59] do. But what would a lot of them do?
[1:15:00] They'll compromise and quit preaching
[1:15:02] it.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Well, come on, somebody.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Notice this. But God was the father
[1:15:08] king. He took care of Israel like a man
[1:15:13] cares for his family. He fed them,
[1:15:17] fought their battles,
[1:15:20] smoothed away their difficulties,
[1:15:24] and settled their problems.
[1:15:28] As much as David loved them, he couldn't
[1:15:31] do these things. David couldn't take
[1:15:33] care of all these things. Solomon could
[1:15:35] take care. There's only one person that
[1:15:38] can do that, and that's Almighty God.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Look what we settle for sometimes,
[1:15:43] friends. We will settle for a king that
[1:15:46] can only give us half of what a God
[1:15:49] called man can give.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; You see, a God called man in this day,
[1:15:53] if he's really a son of God, he has the
[1:15:56] ability to not only lead you with
[1:15:58] pastoral leadership, but to be able to
[1:16:01] love you as he himself grows in these
[1:16:04] virtues. So then what would it become
[1:16:07] when the real true pastors around the
[1:16:09] world preaching this end time word will
[1:16:12] become living walking temples of the
[1:16:16] living God.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Then they will lead their people under
[1:16:21] the image of the god king. So it won't
[1:16:25] be nothing about them, their name, their
[1:16:27] agenda, you know, they want this, they
[1:16:29] want that, but it will be them
[1:16:32] surrendered to the will of God. And they
[1:16:34] will love that word. And they, the
[1:16:36] people, listen to me. I know you're
[1:16:38] looking at me funny today. I believe
[1:16:40] before we leave this world in a rapture,
[1:16:43] that God will achieve the father king
[1:16:48] symbolism that he wanted thousands of
[1:16:51] years ago. And it will only be, of
[1:16:54] course, just a precursor of what's going
[1:16:57] to come in the millennium. But God will
[1:17:00] get men so under his control right in
[1:17:03] the middle of Leodysia. And they will
[1:17:06] love God and they will love their people
[1:17:09] and they will preach the word. And when
[1:17:12] they their people suffer, they will
[1:17:14] suffer with them. That's what a real
[1:17:16] pastor does. That's what a real
[1:17:18] evangelist does when it comes through.
[1:17:20] So how is he able to do that? Where's he
[1:17:22] getting that from? His human makeup. His
[1:17:25] human makeup will run out just like
[1:17:27] yours does. But whenever he will become
[1:17:30] impatient with the people in his
[1:17:33] humanity, if he's really living in this
[1:17:36] height of the pyramid, then God's
[1:17:39] patience will live through the man. And
[1:17:42] God will help the man to be able to be
[1:17:44] patient with the people beyond his own
[1:17:47] capacity. Now, that's exactly what
[1:17:50] happened to God's prophet before he left
[1:17:52] this earth. I personally believe from
[1:17:54] the walk that we can see in the man of
[1:17:56] God that he already had these things in
[1:17:59] his life then and he was living a life
[1:18:03] which was pleasing to the Lord in so
[1:18:06] much that God could take that life from
[1:18:08] us. Now, it would look like he'd have
[1:18:10] plenty of years left. Can you imagine?
[1:18:12] Brother Brandham was taken when he was
[1:18:14] 56 years old. Here I am 69 years old.
[1:18:17] So, I've been preaching more years than
[1:18:18] what brother Brandham was allowed to
[1:18:20] preach. So, it's not like that he didn't
[1:18:22] have a lot of years left in his life.
[1:18:24] But I believe with all of my heart, his
[1:18:26] message was delivered. His message was
[1:18:30] done in the aspect of the prophetic
[1:18:33] realm, the revealing of the son of man.
[1:18:36] Then what's God going to do? God is now
[1:18:39] going to start establishing churches. If
[1:18:41] brother Brandon was here today and he
[1:18:43] could preach and if he was in
[1:18:45] Jeffersonville, I wonder how many of us
[1:18:47] would be here. Well, I here's one that
[1:18:49] wouldn't. I'd be up there. You think I'd
[1:18:51] want to be down here. You all whenever a
[1:18:52] prophet of God standing up there
[1:18:54] preaching, where would most of us move
[1:18:55] to? Jeffersonville. Forget Johnson City.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Forget Harrisonburg,
[1:19:01] Virginia. Forget Mendon, Louisiana.
[1:19:03] Forget somewhere in Arkansas. Let's move
[1:19:05] to Jeffersonville. Wick and said under
[1:19:07] the administration of the prophet of
[1:19:09] God. But God knew exactly what he was
[1:19:12] doing to time the prophet's departure to
[1:19:15] take him so these other foes of the
[1:19:18] ministry would go out and start having
[1:19:20] churches and establishing churches.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God wanted the light shed
[1:19:26] beyond Jeffersonville. Well, aren't you
[1:19:29] glad? Think if everybody would have
[1:19:31] remained in Jeffersonville, how would
[1:19:33] you have ever heard about the message?
[1:19:34] How would I ever heard about the
[1:19:36] message? How would it went overseas? How
[1:19:38] would it have got to the places around
[1:19:40] the world that it's got to? So God knew
[1:19:43] he must take the prophet off of the
[1:19:45] scene and the message had reached its
[1:19:48] climax under the prophet's ministry. And
[1:19:51] then what will God do? Then God will
[1:19:53] begin to manifest himself in a body
[1:19:56] move. Now of course Satan knew that
[1:19:58] exactly. And Satan started raising up
[1:20:00] men from right around the message. Well,
[1:20:02] I'm Joshua. I'm Caleb. I'm this that the
[1:20:05] other. Why? The leader of the message
[1:20:08] seemingly was gone and people were torn
[1:20:11] to pieces. I can't imagine how they must
[1:20:13] have felt. There's people here that was
[1:20:15] alive when brother Brandham was taken
[1:20:17] out of the earth. Brother Harvey, I
[1:20:18] can't imagine how you felt, Brother
[1:20:19] Emanuel. I can't imagine how you felt.
[1:20:21] We've got some others, Brother Palmer.
[1:20:23] How they must have felt when they got
[1:20:25] news that God's prophet had passed away.
[1:20:28] They must have felt like, "Oh no, this
[1:20:30] can't be. There's no way this can
[1:20:31] happen. This cannot happen. He's still
[1:20:34] got more to do. He's got more places to
[1:20:37] preach and and more to bring. Well,
[1:20:39] apparently God didn't think so. God felt
[1:20:41] like from the prophetic aspect, the
[1:20:43] message had been brought. And now it was
[1:20:46] time for God to take his prophet. And
[1:20:48] you notice the children of Israel, as
[1:20:50] long as Moses was there, they was just
[1:20:52] meandering around here and there and
[1:20:54] there. Wherever Moses went, that's where
[1:20:56] they went. You know what? Moses went
[1:20:58] that way, they went that way. Moses went
[1:21:00] that way, they went that way. But what
[1:21:02] did God do? God knew that the children
[1:21:04] of Israel would never come to their
[1:21:06] position as long as Moses was there. So
[1:21:09] he takes Moses off the scene. And then
[1:21:12] God places who? Joshua, which is a type,
[1:21:15] of course, double type actually in the
[1:21:16] New Testament and in the last days. It's
[1:21:18] a type of the prophet and also of the
[1:21:20] Holy Ghost. And yet God knew that they'd
[1:21:22] never come to their position as long as
[1:21:24] the the prophet Moses was there. So he
[1:21:27] takes him. Joshua then begins to
[1:21:29] position them. Then what did they do?
[1:21:32] They get their own property, their own
[1:21:33] house, their own maiders, their own
[1:21:35] ters, their own goats, their own sheep.
[1:21:37] Then every man starts living on his
[1:21:40] property. And now they fought for years
[1:21:42] and years to get the property. Then they
[1:21:44] change dispensations. And then they
[1:21:47] start fighting not to get the property,
[1:21:49] but fighting to keep their property.
[1:21:51] Have any of you noticed that way in your
[1:21:53] own life that you have things in your
[1:21:55] life, joy, deliverance of this and that
[1:21:57] and the other, and then sometime later
[1:22:00] after you're set free or delivered of a
[1:22:01] certain thing, the devil will try to
[1:22:03] bring that thing back and you think,
[1:22:05] "What in the world is going on?" It's
[1:22:07] just that Philistine that you knocked
[1:22:10] down years and years ago when you was
[1:22:12] trying to get your land. Now that same
[1:22:14] Philistine's trying to come back and
[1:22:16] move in your house after you've done
[1:22:19] built a Holy Ghost house. But you need
[1:22:21] to let that Philistine know there ain't
[1:22:23] no room in this house for no
[1:22:24] uncircumcised Philistine. There ain't no
[1:22:27] room in this house for no Hittites. So
[1:22:29] pack up your bag and get out of here.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Now what is God doing? Exactly the same
[1:22:35] thing in the last days. So watch. He fed
[1:22:37] them, fought their battles, smoothed
[1:22:39] away their difficulties, settled their
[1:22:41] problems. He just I love this statement.
[1:22:43] I absolutely love it. He just busyed
[1:22:47] himself.
[1:22:48] busied himself over them. Can you
[1:22:51] imagine almighty God the creator of the
[1:22:53] heavens and the earth and he just busyed
[1:22:55] himself over his people. I believe
[1:22:58] that's what he wants to do to us,
[1:22:59] brother Joel. Just to busy himself over
[1:23:03] us. If we can just wait. Well, brother
[1:23:05] Donnie, I pray and I pray. How long does
[1:23:06] it take? Well, he's a busy God. He's got
[1:23:08] a lot of children to take care of. Well,
[1:23:10] just wait a little bit. While he's
[1:23:11] working on your patients, he's working
[1:23:12] on the folks in Uganda too and Zimbabwe
[1:23:15] and Zir and all these other places
[1:23:17] around the world. So he busied himself
[1:23:20] over them. They were the only nation to
[1:23:23] which he was truly God. Truly God. And
[1:23:28] can't you see the difference between the
[1:23:30] bride and the church, the foolish virgin
[1:23:33] and the bride? He we the elect are the
[1:23:36] only ones that is truly God. truly king.
[1:23:41] They love him. They acknowledge him as
[1:23:44] far as savior. But what the dividing
[1:23:47] line is with the church is that they do
[1:23:49] not want him to be their lord. Now they
[1:23:52] say they do. But if he would tell them,
[1:23:54] don't dress this way, don't do that,
[1:23:56] don't go here, don't go there, don't
[1:23:57] watch this, don't get on your phone and
[1:23:59] do that. Come on, somebody. Then they
[1:24:01] say, now don't you go to meddling in my
[1:24:03] business, God. This iPhone is mine. I do
[1:24:06] what I want to. Well, you know what?
[1:24:08] You're just proving right there. He is
[1:24:10] not your Lord. If he is your Lord,
[1:24:12] you'll do whatever he tells you to do.
[1:24:14] That's just the way that it is. So, it
[1:24:17] separates. And the bride, this is what
[1:24:19] he wants to be to us in this day. If
[1:24:21] you're not, friends, as an individual,
[1:24:24] why would you settle for him just being
[1:24:26] God, God in your life, in your job, in
[1:24:31] your home, when he wants to be truly
[1:24:35] God? Why would you settle for just being
[1:24:38] a distant relationship and you go to
[1:24:40] church and you have a religious
[1:24:41] inclination and and you want to you
[1:24:43] don't want to go go to hell. You don't
[1:24:45] want to be lost, but you've never really
[1:24:47] made that commitment. Remember the
[1:24:48] sermon the Lord gave me years ago on the
[1:24:51] danger of an uncsured heart. The danger
[1:24:54] of a person just keeping back that small
[1:24:57] little compartment in their heart that
[1:24:59] they never totally give up to God. And
[1:25:02] you will never have complete victory
[1:25:04] until you totally surrender everything
[1:25:07] you are to Jesus Christ. Amen. Notice he
[1:25:11] busy himself over them. They were the
[1:25:13] only nation to which he was truly God.
[1:25:15] But one day they got to looking around
[1:25:18] and they saw the Philistines and the
[1:25:20] other nations with kings over them. It
[1:25:23] caught their eyes. Notice not the soul.
[1:25:27] It caught their eyes. So they looked at
[1:25:30] and they said, "Well, why can't we be
[1:25:32] like that? I like that. Don't you? Don't
[1:25:35] you like that system? Everything is
[1:25:36] organized. Everything, man. They've got
[1:25:39] this and that and the other. Everything
[1:25:41] is so good. We need that. I mean, we're
[1:25:43] we're nobody. Don't you understand that
[1:25:45] the banks whenever we got ready to build
[1:25:47] our church here, well, they put poor old
[1:25:50] brother Jim Babu, the office rigor that
[1:25:52] ever was. And the main reason was
[1:25:54] because we was an independent church and
[1:25:57] we were not an organization. Now they
[1:26:00] could not understand they could not
[1:26:02] understand the amount of money that went
[1:26:05] through our bank account for the last
[1:26:07] how many ever years and how that money
[1:26:09] went here and there and there and there.
[1:26:11] And they asked brother Jim all kinds of
[1:26:13] questions. How many young people do you
[1:26:15] have in your church? Do they pay ties?
[1:26:17] How many of them are single? How many of
[1:26:18] them are married? uh even blood type,
[1:26:20] blood pressure, how much medication you
[1:26:22] No, I'm teasing on that. And then how
[1:26:24] many old people do you have in your
[1:26:25] church? Because they want to know how
[1:26:27] many is going to kick the bucket, you
[1:26:28] know? So if we finance this church for
[1:26:30] y'all, how y'all going to pay these
[1:26:31] bills? It was unbelievable all the stuff
[1:26:34] they put poor brother Jim through. And
[1:26:36] they just could not understand it why
[1:26:39] that we would want to build a place that
[1:26:42] was bigger. And to them, to them, the
[1:26:45] way it looked, it looked like that it
[1:26:48] was being built around one man.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. Come on.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; And brother Jim had to try to explain to
[1:26:58] them, look, if he passes away, there'll
[1:27:01] be another one come and another one come
[1:27:03] and another one come. It's not about
[1:27:05] him. He's only the pastor. But they got
[1:27:08] a trustee board. But they still Oh my.
[1:27:11] We could have had a great big
[1:27:12] organizational name about that long
[1:27:14] while they had passed it a whole lot
[1:27:16] quicker since Linda than what they did.
[1:27:18] But you know what? Why? Because man
[1:27:20] looks and said, "Oh, I know that's much
[1:27:22] more trustworthy. That's much more
[1:27:24] trustworthy." Do you understand that
[1:27:26] there's more me more Baptist people that
[1:27:28] are in cults than message people are?
[1:27:31] More Methodist people that are in cults,
[1:27:33] more Catholic people that are in cults.
[1:27:35] Islam, oh, come on, somebody. More of
[1:27:37] them. You know who the the me and Carol
[1:27:39] saw a YouTube video the other day and
[1:27:41] the most wealthy church in the United
[1:27:44] States, not around the world, but in the
[1:27:46] United States right now, it's not the
[1:27:48] Catholic Church. No, sir. It's actually
[1:27:50] the Mormons.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Church of the Latter-day Saints and
[1:27:54] everything they do is so secretive and
[1:27:56] so quiet. Yet, you don't hear a lot of
[1:27:59] people calling them a cult. But yeah,
[1:28:00] when you pull up the meaning of cult,
[1:28:02] which I did this past week, be sharing
[1:28:04] it with you on Wednesday night, Lord
[1:28:05] will it. And you look in the Miriam, you
[1:28:07] look in Wikipedia, you look in, you
[1:28:08] know, all these different places and you
[1:28:10] look at 12 different dictionaries and
[1:28:11] you find 12 different meanings. And then
[1:28:14] I finally read one I could not keep from
[1:28:16] chuckling because the answer they said
[1:28:18] was, "Well, even professional people who
[1:28:21] study on cults say they can't even agree
[1:28:23] to be able to define one." I said,
[1:28:24] "Yeah, that's about right. That's about
[1:28:27] right." But you realize they looked at
[1:28:29] and said, "Oh my, that that's what we
[1:28:31] want. Everything is just in such a
[1:28:33] state, you know, in the organization.
[1:28:35] My, that's lovely. I like that. So, what
[1:28:38] if we get tired of Brother Donnie? My
[1:28:39] goodness, he's been here for all these
[1:28:41] years. I'm getting tired of him
[1:28:42] hammering on us and where I I I get wore
[1:28:45] out from his preaching, Brother Daryl.
[1:28:47] Let's let's replace Brother Harry and
[1:28:49] let's replace Brother Larry. Let's let's
[1:28:51] just totally revamp our church and redo
[1:28:53] this and that and the other.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; No, sir, brother.
[1:28:57] Let's go to headquarters and say, "We
[1:28:59] are tired of our pastor standing up
[1:29:01] there and burning our hide." You don't
[1:29:03] know what it feels like. Every time we
[1:29:05] leave church, we have to drag oursel out
[1:29:08] to the car and stop by the ER and get
[1:29:10] patched up and swings in our arms and
[1:29:13] when we go out. We are sick and
[1:29:15] tired of it. But our money helped pay
[1:29:17] for that building and we want to take
[1:29:19] over.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:29:26] Well, you see, some people would say,
[1:29:28] "Yes, yes, that's what we want."
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; That's what Israel wanted.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Well, this this prophet thing
[1:29:37] that that that's uh you know, they ain't
[1:29:39] nobody else out here. God wanted them.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; The Philistines didn't have a prophet.
[1:29:45] The Amorites, the Hittites, the
[1:29:46] Jebusite, none of them had a prophet.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; So, Israel was the only one. God, all
[1:29:52] the rest of them were so organized just
[1:29:54] like clockwork. Boy, I mean,
[1:30:03] see, the more you add to it, the more
[1:30:05] harmony it makes, the more rhythm it
[1:30:07] makes.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; But they were just
[1:30:12] and it may go for years before he gets
[1:30:14] another word from the Lord. And then
[1:30:17] dick
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; another 10 years passes
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; and they're thinking
[1:30:26] this this ain't right. Look how many
[1:30:27] there are of us. We need to have
[1:30:30] something organized and structured.
[1:30:34] Structured.
[1:30:36] It caught their eyes and they decided
[1:30:39] they
[1:30:41] decided instead of going to God and
[1:30:44] said, "God, we we we've seen this. Would
[1:30:47] it be okay with you? Would this be your
[1:30:49] will?"
[1:30:50] Very decided.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; That they ought to humanize
[1:30:57] their leadership. So they wanted a king.
[1:31:00] A God was going to humanize the
[1:31:03] leadership
[1:31:04] himself in the person of the Lord Jesus
[1:31:07] Christ. Well, my goodness, brother
[1:31:09] Donia, that's going to be thousands of
[1:31:12] years.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Yep. You see, the prophetic time clock
[1:31:18] sometimes can move so
[1:31:21] slow.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; But, Brother Dave, they wanted it in
[1:31:26] their lifetime.
[1:31:28] I don't want my great great great great
[1:31:29] great great great great great great
[1:31:30] great great great great great great
[1:31:31] great great great great great great
[1:31:32] great grandchildren seeing a
[1:31:35] humanization of God's king. I want to
[1:31:37] see it myself. I want this. Now we've
[1:31:41] got to the problem.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; In the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:31:48] But they got a Oh my goodness. They got
[1:31:52] ahead of him.
[1:31:54] I'm gonna tell you something, friend.
[1:31:55] This this next next statement right here
[1:31:57] is scary.
[1:32:00] Satan knew
[1:32:02] the plan of God.
[1:32:06] So he put it in the hearts of the people
[1:32:13] to get ahead
[1:32:15] of God the word.
[1:32:19] So it wasn't a sensual desire. It was
[1:32:22] not a a sexual perversion. And it was
[1:32:24] not. It was actually
[1:32:27] the plan of God,
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; but not for their age.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, speak to us.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; When they approached Samuel and asked
[1:32:43] for a king, Samuel was so dismayed that
[1:32:46] his heart almost failed him. And God had
[1:32:49] been leading his people through this
[1:32:51] consecrated scripture vindicated
[1:32:53] prophet. and he felt that he had been
[1:32:55] rejected. He gathered the people and
[1:32:57] pleaded with them not to turn away. Now,
[1:32:59] can you imagine how this this prophet of
[1:33:02] God must have felt. Was it tragic? Yes,
[1:33:06] it was tragic. And God even had his
[1:33:10] prophet to tell him before he ever
[1:33:12] crowned one, of course. And he told him,
[1:33:13] he said, "Tell him what he'll do. He'll
[1:33:16] take their daughters and make them
[1:33:18] bakers in his house. He'll take their
[1:33:21] sons and make them this and that and the
[1:33:23] other." God told them the downside of
[1:33:25] humanizing your leadership. And then
[1:33:29] when even when God through his prophet
[1:33:31] told them all that, they said, "We want
[1:33:34] it anyhow." God said, "Fine. Go ahead
[1:33:37] and give it to them.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; It ain't my will. It's contrary to my
[1:33:43] word at this time, but give it to them.
[1:33:47] They're not going to hush until you do."
[1:33:50] Lord, children, I'll tell you, it's so
[1:33:52] dangerous when we're praying for about
[1:33:54] things and we pray and pray and we want
[1:33:56] pray for what we want for instead of
[1:33:58] waiting on the will of God and God will
[1:34:00] delay us and God will send a word for
[1:34:02] through an evangelist and God sent a
[1:34:04] word through a pastor and send another
[1:34:06] word for somebody else and you sat right
[1:34:08] there and hear that and it's so
[1:34:09] personalized to you that you know God's
[1:34:12] got your number and you'll get up and
[1:34:14] walk out and say, "Well, I'm going to do
[1:34:15] it anyhow." No,
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my. May God have mercy on us.
[1:34:20] Brothers, let's jump some of these
[1:34:21] quotes here. Let's run over to Psalms
[1:34:23] Psalms 37. Now, look, look at the word
[1:34:26] here. How that the word describes about
[1:34:29] patiently. Psalms 37:7. Rest in the Lord
[1:34:33] and wait patiently for him. Fret not
[1:34:36] thyself because of him, notice, who
[1:34:40] prosperest in his way. Because of the
[1:34:43] man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.
[1:34:47] So, children of God can look at people
[1:34:50] that seemingly are more blessed,
[1:34:53] getting on better in life and doing
[1:34:56] better. The compromisers have a whole
[1:34:58] lot less trouble than we do. The
[1:35:00] compromising churches and the
[1:35:02] compromising preachers have a whole lot
[1:35:05] less battles than we do. And then Satan
[1:35:08] will say, "Well, look at them. You're
[1:35:09] supposed to be so right and you're
[1:35:10] walking with God, you know, and all
[1:35:12] their children are in church. And look
[1:35:14] at yours. You've got one that's away
[1:35:16] from the Lord. You got one that's
[1:35:17] questioning the truth. You've got one
[1:35:19] that's this and that. Well, sure. All
[1:35:21] their kids in church cuz the way they
[1:35:22] taught, they can do anything they want
[1:35:24] to do. Live any kind of life they want
[1:35:25] to live. Just long as they show up for
[1:35:27] church, they're all right. We preach a
[1:35:28] consecrated life, a dedicated life to
[1:35:31] the kingdom of God. Oh, sure, you don't
[1:35:33] have to have it when you first come. But
[1:35:35] God wants it before you leave this
[1:35:37] world. That's what I want for you,
[1:35:39] friends. I ain't ask for your money. I
[1:35:41] ain't ask for favor. I ain't ask for
[1:35:43] things from you. But I'll tell you what
[1:35:44] I want. I want people in our church that
[1:35:47] love the Lord Jesus Christ so much they
[1:35:49] are willing to obey his word it makes no
[1:35:52] difference what it cost them. That's not
[1:35:54] me asking you that. That's God asking
[1:35:56] you that. I'm only repeating his desire.
[1:36:00] Anybody here want that?
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Y'all rather have some compromise and
[1:36:03] pastor just have said, "Well, just do
[1:36:05] whatever y'all want to do. As long as
[1:36:07] you come church, you know, once every
[1:36:08] now and then, that's fine with me. I
[1:36:09] don't really care how you live. I don't
[1:36:11] care how your men treat your wives. I
[1:36:12] don't care how y'all treat your
[1:36:14] children. Be mean to them, beat them,
[1:36:15] whoop on them if you want to. I don't
[1:36:16] really care. God don't either. We're in
[1:36:18] such a day of grace. You know, God got
[1:36:20] saved in the New Testament. Y'all knew
[1:36:21] that, right? Y'all knew that God got
[1:36:23] saved and God got converted from from
[1:36:25] being that old mean, wicked, evil God
[1:36:28] that he was in the Old Testament. God
[1:36:29] hated homosexuality in the Old
[1:36:31] Testament. But God says it's okay now
[1:36:33] according to them anyway. So God must
[1:36:35] have got saved. No, God wasn't lost.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; It was us that was lost. And the reason
[1:36:42] people think that today is because they
[1:36:45] are still lost.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Psalm 40 and1. To the chief musician, a
[1:36:53] psalm of David, I waited patiently for
[1:36:56] the Lord, and he inclined unto me and
[1:37:00] heard my cry. Hebrews 6:12. Be not
[1:37:03] slothful, but followers of them who
[1:37:05] through faith and patience inherit the
[1:37:09] promises. So you see, God is going to
[1:37:12] have to have leaders who are tried just
[1:37:15] like you are and more than likely more
[1:37:18] than you are because they will be an
[1:37:20] example. They're not just going to stand
[1:37:22] up in the pull pit and tell you all you
[1:37:24] all do this and you all do that and you
[1:37:26] all do something else and they
[1:37:28] themselves are exempt from it, but
[1:37:30] they're going to be tried. Oh yes, they
[1:37:33] will. And then can't you get behind a
[1:37:35] leader like that? Can't you get behind
[1:37:38] one? Oh, can you imagine following a
[1:37:40] leader that is so weak and puny every
[1:37:42] time hardship hits his life and he's
[1:37:45] ready to quit. He's ready to step down.
[1:37:47] Oh my I if I'm going to set under a man,
[1:37:50] I want to sit under a valiant leader.
[1:37:53] One that's called of God. One that I can
[1:37:55] see that God has moved on that man. And
[1:37:59] God, it seemed like in some ways has
[1:38:01] nearly tried to destroy him. God has let
[1:38:05] things come his way that he's not a
[1:38:07] baby. I don't understand it. And I tell
[1:38:09] Carol all the time, you know that
[1:38:10] there's certain preachers they can get
[1:38:12] by with anything. They can say things
[1:38:14] wrong. They can do things wrong. And
[1:38:16] they they're the type of people that
[1:38:18] people in the message just make over and
[1:38:20] make excuses from. Well, you know, it's
[1:38:22] it's it's this and it's that and it's
[1:38:24] something else. You know what? I ain't
[1:38:26] that type of guy. Believe me, you all
[1:38:28] won't let me get by with it. Most of
[1:38:30] all, he won't let me get by with it. So,
[1:38:32] I'd much rather be that kind of an
[1:38:34] individual that everybody has to walk
[1:38:36] around, you know, just be so careful.
[1:38:38] Don't hurt his feelings. Don't hurt his
[1:38:40] feeling. I want to follow a man that can
[1:38:42] be led of the Holy Ghost. A man that'll
[1:38:45] stand right there on that word even if
[1:38:47] his closest friends turn away.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Notice when God made promise to Abraham,
[1:38:54] because he could swear by no greater, he
[1:38:56] swear by himself, saying, "Surely
[1:38:58] blessing, I will bless thee.
[1:39:00] multiplying, I will multiply thee. And
[1:39:03] so after he had patiently
[1:39:07] endured.
[1:39:08] Isn't this amazing how that the Old
[1:39:10] Testament doesn't mention patience of
[1:39:13] Abraham, but more so his faith, but here
[1:39:16] Paul, the writer of Hebrews, not only
[1:39:19] mentions how faithful that he was, and
[1:39:21] of course he did in Hebrews 11, but now
[1:39:23] he couples that faith with patience
[1:39:26] because Abraham believed God. Yes. and
[1:39:29] it was imputed unto him of
[1:39:30] righteousness. But he must wait for
[1:39:32] years, decades for the promise of God to
[1:39:36] come to pass. So after he had patiently
[1:39:39] endured, he obtained the promise.
[1:39:44] Do you understand where many of the
[1:39:45] churches are today?
[1:39:48] Pregnant.
[1:39:54] Every church in the world will wind up
[1:39:59] pregnant.
[1:40:04] There's two kings
[1:40:07] that's desiring to conquer the world.
[1:40:11] You see, when a king would come in and
[1:40:14] they would take over a city,
[1:40:16] they had certain things that they would
[1:40:18] do in war.
[1:40:21] They wanted the crown. So say Barcelona
[1:40:25] would have a crown and then Madrid would
[1:40:29] have a crown for that city and there
[1:40:32] would be a crown for this one and that
[1:40:34] one. And those kings wanted the crown.
[1:40:38] But there's one of the first things that
[1:40:39] many of them would do when they would
[1:40:42] take over a city. They looked
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; for the king's wife.
[1:40:49] They would kill the king's seed,
[1:40:53] boys and girls, men and women if they
[1:40:56] were grown up.
[1:40:57] But they would look for the king's wife.
[1:41:00] That's why many castles and palaces and
[1:41:03] cities had secret getaways because
[1:41:05] that's the first ones they want.
[1:41:09] So they could actually rape the king's
[1:41:12] wife
[1:41:14] and claim her
[1:41:17] as their own. She was a trophy.
[1:41:23] So he confiscated the crown and then he
[1:41:26] would take the king's wife and sew his
[1:41:30] seed in her body.
[1:41:34] Can't you see what Satan has wanted to
[1:41:36] done for thousands of years?
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't always use friends people
[1:41:42] that's on the outside.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Some of his greatest tools have been
[1:41:46] people from the inside.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Then what does he do? Then the
[1:41:53] queen rocks around now under the new
[1:41:57] dominion of this new king which has took
[1:42:00] her husband's crown and confiscated her
[1:42:03] body which belonged to her husband.
[1:42:09] Now she is bearing in her body the image
[1:42:14] of this heathen
[1:42:16] king.
[1:42:20] Is she going to love it?
[1:42:22] Is she going to kill it? Is she going to
[1:42:25] abort it? What's she going to do?
[1:42:30] As a mother, there'd be something in
[1:42:32] her. Well, I can't I can't abort this
[1:42:35] baby. I can't take its life cuz it's
[1:42:37] part of me.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; But if I give birth to it,
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; it'll be part him.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Pardon me.
[1:42:48] That's what Satan's done in every age.
[1:42:51] confiscate the king's crown.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; All right, brother.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; He was the king of Ephesus. And Satan
[1:42:58] moved in under the white horse anointing
[1:43:00] and tried to snatch that crown. Oh my.
[1:43:03] Down through the ages, he's done the
[1:43:05] same thing. Then what would he had for
[1:43:07] the bride? The bride's body.
[1:43:11] Lord God, help us.
[1:43:14] The people are supposed to be giving
[1:43:16] birth to the word and he confiscates
[1:43:20] their body, church body.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; That's why Paul in Galatians 8:1 said,
[1:43:27] "When I come to you, you receive me as
[1:43:29] an angel of God." And he said, "When you
[1:43:31] looked at my eyes and the state they
[1:43:33] were in, you would have plucked out your
[1:43:35] eyes and given them to me. But now have
[1:43:39] I become your enemy?" What happened?
[1:43:41] Some Judaizers come in Galatia and they
[1:43:44] started turning those people right
[1:43:47] against Paul, the very man of God that
[1:43:49] had led them to the Lord Jesus. And them
[1:43:52] Judaizers wanted the crown. Not a Paul.
[1:43:55] Paul wasn't the crown king. It was
[1:43:58] Jesus.
[1:44:00] It was Jesus. He said, "Have you become
[1:44:02] Christians by the grace of God and now
[1:44:04] you've turned to the law?" And what did
[1:44:07] those Judaizers want? They wanted the
[1:44:10] body of the believers to sew their seed,
[1:44:14] their false doctrine
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; in the body
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; of the believers
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; that if they give birth, it will be half
[1:44:26] message,
[1:44:27] half a dod. Wow.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; You remember the way they had done in
[1:44:32] the days of Nehemiah
[1:44:34] when the men had married the women of a
[1:44:37] foreign authenticity and God told them
[1:44:40] not to.
[1:44:41] And some of those men, Jewish men was
[1:44:44] marrying those women.
[1:44:46] And the Bible said that half of them
[1:44:49] spoke in the tongue of the Jews and half
[1:44:52] of them in the tongue of Ashod.
[1:44:56] Yeah,
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus.
[1:45:01] Why? Because they had sown the seed and
[1:45:06] a place that produced a hybrid.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Word of life.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Word of life.
[1:45:15] Take on your name.
[1:45:18] Word of life.
[1:45:22] We don't want our body
[1:45:25] to be sewn the seed of a man.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. I'm not interested in
[1:45:31] producing a bunch of raanites.
[1:45:34] You shouldn't be interested in being a
[1:45:35] Spencerite or or a Puitite or a Wardite.
[1:45:39] You ought to be want to be a son or
[1:45:40] daughter of God. Let the Lord Jesus
[1:45:43] reflect his image in you.
[1:45:50] Oh my look at this in the spoken words
[1:45:53] original seed. Now
[1:45:57] the so-called bride
[1:46:00] is pregnantated. Now can you imagine
[1:46:02] there is a people called bride. There's
[1:46:04] another people that's the so-called
[1:46:07] bride.
[1:46:09] So they actually are called bride but
[1:46:12] from the prophetic standpoint they're
[1:46:14] the so-called.
[1:46:17] But without prophetic insight, everybody
[1:46:19] will look at them all and call them all
[1:46:22] the same thing.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Now, the so-called bride is pregnantated
[1:46:28] with all kinds of tommyrock, disgrace.
[1:46:32] The women won't pay a bit more attention
[1:46:34] to what God's word says and nothing in
[1:46:36] the world. And neither will the men or
[1:46:39] even the preachers.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Then call that a bride. What is it?
[1:46:47] She's pregnantated.
[1:46:50] Christ blood
[1:46:52] has become pregnantated with the world.
[1:46:55] Dressing like the world. Acting like the
[1:46:58] world. Big church is fine. It shows what
[1:47:01] she is. She's of the devil. Amen.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; I'd rather have to I I would rather any
[1:47:12] day out of the week if I had to worship
[1:47:14] under a brush harbor.
[1:47:16] If you folks come in here and get a
[1:47:18] hike, a flute and high in society and
[1:47:19] think, "Boy, we got a nice building. We
[1:47:21] got this and that and the other." I'd
[1:47:23] rather have the spirit of God than this
[1:47:25] place to be filled with the wealthiest
[1:47:26] people in Johnson City. What good's
[1:47:28] wealth going to do us? I want somebody
[1:47:30] that wants to love the Lord. Somebody
[1:47:32] that wants to worship God and sing and
[1:47:34] pray and and live right and live what
[1:47:38] they're hearing preached.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; She's of the devil. That's what the
[1:47:47] devil done at the first place is try to
[1:47:49] build a big beautiful kingdom in the
[1:47:52] heaven and was kicked out. Remember sin
[1:47:56] never began in the Garden of Eden.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; It actually started in heaven.
[1:48:03] When Satan said, "I will exalt my
[1:48:05] throne." Right? There's where sin began,
[1:48:07] right? In his soul, that day on Calvary
[1:48:09] 1960, the prophet tells us that his soul
[1:48:12] sinned. What was it? Pride. I'll do this
[1:48:17] and I'll do that. I'll be like the most
[1:48:21] high.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; I will exalt my throne. I'll raise up.
[1:48:28] I'll go into the north sides.
[1:48:32] the sides of the north.
[1:48:36] Listen to this. Oh Lord, that's what
[1:48:40] Christ modern bride is. She's kicked out
[1:48:46] because she's excommunicated from God
[1:48:50] because she's a
[1:48:52] and not a virgin. It's deep, but I hope
[1:48:57] you get it.
[1:48:58] Adam's bride could not wait, but she
[1:49:02] went forward first. That's the way
[1:49:03] today. The bride today, she wants to
[1:49:06] manufacture something. Glory to God.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; She's got to work it up on the platform.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; So, you what that let you know? That
[1:49:18] part right there, that phase of it is
[1:49:20] not cold dead churches that don't have a
[1:49:23] move of God,
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; But it's churches. Glory to God. Glory
[1:49:27] to God. And they work it up on the
[1:49:30] platform.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; I don't think shouting should have to be
[1:49:34] worked up on the platform.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; I think if you got the shout in you, you
[1:49:39] should be able to shout from right back
[1:49:41] there.
[1:49:42] [Applause]
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; I don't think it should be me. I don't
[1:49:46] think it should be the song leader. I
[1:49:48] don't think it should be the musicians
[1:49:49] that has to pump you all up to a glory.
[1:49:52] Hallelujah. If you ain't got a glory,
[1:49:54] hallelujah, I say shame on you for all
[1:49:57] that God has done in your life, all that
[1:49:59] he's set you free from, it shouldn't be
[1:50:01] the song leader praising God. And you
[1:50:03] all sitting there like a bump on a
[1:50:05] pickle. It ought to be from the very
[1:50:07] back, the very last row in the
[1:50:08] mezzanine, come out there in the
[1:50:10] nurseries that the sisters out there
[1:50:12] ought to be saying, "Glory to God, I was
[1:50:14] lost and he found me. I was blind and he
[1:50:16] opened my eyes." It shouldn't have to
[1:50:18] come from the platform.
[1:50:28] Oh, she's got to have everything. What
[1:50:30] is she doing? Manufacturing something.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Some of the guys installed our lights.
[1:50:39] They wanted to meet with me
[1:50:42] and they wanted to know if we wanted
[1:50:44] psychedelic colors
[1:50:48] and fog machines.
[1:50:51] And if we wanted the lights hooked up so
[1:50:53] when the music boomity bumpity boom that
[1:50:56] the lights would blippity blippity blip.
[1:51:00] And what about a big screen back here
[1:51:02] behind you? This one guy worked at a he
[1:51:05] went to a big major major church in
[1:51:07] Atlanta and he said, "This is what I've
[1:51:09] done for our church.
[1:51:11] A big old massive screen 21 ft wide, 9
[1:51:15] ft long. And when the preacher is
[1:51:17] preaching, I sit back there with the
[1:51:20] control of the iPad and I dramatize what
[1:51:23] he's preaching. So I flash pictures.
[1:51:27] I said, I dramatize enough. They don't
[1:51:29] need no more.
[1:51:30] [Applause]
[1:51:35] Can you imagine? That's what churches go
[1:51:38] to.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Fog lights,
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; fog machines.
[1:51:45] Brother, I ain't one to look for the
[1:51:47] fog. I'm one to look for the sunshine.
[1:51:50] Fog is always a dangerous sign to me.
[1:51:52] Ain't it you? You know what? When it's
[1:51:54] all foggy, you can't see to go very
[1:51:56] good. Well, I guess that's a pretty good
[1:51:57] display of where they are. They can't
[1:51:59] find out which God's really God. The
[1:52:01] Father, the Son, or the Holy Ghost. They
[1:52:03] can't see this. And I need to clear out
[1:52:05] the fog in the brain, plus the fog
[1:52:07] machine on the platform. I don't want no
[1:52:10] fog machine. I don't want no flashing
[1:52:13] lights. I want hearts that are set on
[1:52:15] fire of the Holy Ghost that are burning
[1:52:18] out that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:52:21] yesterday, today, and forever. That he's
[1:52:23] filling young people with the Holy Ghost
[1:52:26] and changing lives,
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; making us love one another and love our
[1:52:31] enemies like never before.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; But the church has to manufacture
[1:52:40] something.
[1:52:42] If you would go to YouTube sometime and
[1:52:46] pull up some of these so-called worship
[1:52:48] and this modern day and Christmas
[1:52:52] programs of the modern day church,
[1:52:56] it would have been outlawed years ago to
[1:52:58] even show what they look like and the
[1:53:01] way they dance and the way they have
[1:53:03] swings upon the platform and the women
[1:53:06] sitting there with with hardly no
[1:53:08] clothes on at all and swinging back and
[1:53:10] forth. Looks like nothing but a barroom.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the church of the living
[1:53:16] God being turned into such filth?
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Tommy rot.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Sure love y'all.
[1:53:30] [Applause]
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; You see, there's nothing to it.
[1:53:40] It's a phony.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; If it wasn't, the world would be a flame
[1:53:45] of the power of God. The church would be
[1:53:47] on fire. Dead would be raised and all
[1:53:50] kinds of things would be taking place.
[1:53:54] But what did she get sewed up before
[1:53:56] Christ could get to her?
[1:53:59] He got to her to plant his own seed.
[1:54:06] Now, you know, the sad part about it is
[1:54:07] we can no longer leave a lot of this
[1:54:10] stuff
[1:54:12] out in the outlying areas,
[1:54:15] but it's creeping right in our own
[1:54:16] ranks.
[1:54:21] Oh, yes, we want youth services. Yes, we
[1:54:24] want revival. We want what the church is
[1:54:27] supposed to do. But when it turns into
[1:54:30] entertainment, it's time for me to
[1:54:32] leave. Amen.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; If all y'all want to turn into is one
[1:54:36] big meal after another big meal and hot
[1:54:38] dogs and hamburgers and, you know, light
[1:54:40] up the grill. Well, this is my view of
[1:54:42] it. I'd rather have the hide lit up in
[1:54:44] the sanctuary than the grill lit up on
[1:54:46] the patio.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; If I got to get my burning, let me get
[1:54:52] my burning now. Cuz I sure don't want to
[1:54:54] stand before God and him say, "You're
[1:54:55] you're going to be lost, boy. You're
[1:54:57] going to hell cuz you didn't preach the
[1:54:59] truth." No. If I got to get burnt,
[1:55:01] Brother Joel, may God set me on fire. If
[1:55:04] every time I go to church, my goodness,
[1:55:06] some of you all, you ought to be jumping
[1:55:07] up off your pew anyhow just because your
[1:55:10] hide's getting fried. Amen. If it ain't
[1:55:12] emotional and you're not a static, God
[1:55:14] say, "Woo! Oh, help me Jesus. Oh, help
[1:55:16] me Jesus."
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, my
[1:55:22] hard God. That's what's the matter
[1:55:25] today. You want some kind of phony
[1:55:27] makeup with scream and jump and speaking
[1:55:29] in tongues or something?
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Instead of waiting on the real word of
[1:55:35] God to me made manifest to the bride.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Do we believe in jumping? We do.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; But don't jump no higher and you live.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; You You live high, shout high, brother.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; But if you're lying, cheating, running
[1:55:50] your mouth and gossiping this and that
[1:55:52] and the other, don't jump around here.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Jump up out of your seat and come down
[1:55:57] and be the first to hit the altar. Then
[1:55:58] jump up from the altar.
[1:56:03] [Applause]
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; There's a bunch of brothers from Uganda
[1:56:09] and uh Tanzania and Kenya and uh
[1:56:13] Philippines and Jamaica wanting me to
[1:56:15] come overseas. Y'all want me to schedule
[1:56:16] that this week and be gone for about six
[1:56:18] months and give you a little reprief?
[1:56:22] Oh my
[1:56:24] Notice
[1:56:26] them kind that takes the word of God as
[1:56:28] God's true bride bringing forth
[1:56:32] children.
[1:56:34] They can't die. A child that the bride
[1:56:38] brings forth on the word can't die
[1:56:40] because it's the word. Did you get it?
[1:56:46] She can't die. That child can't die
[1:56:48] because he's a word child.
[1:56:52] He's a seed child. He's an eternal
[1:56:55] child. Hallelujah. That's exactly what
[1:56:57] Jesus Christ's word. A spoken eternal
[1:57:01] child didn't have to die, but he did it
[1:57:03] in order to pay the debt. That's the
[1:57:05] only way it could be paid. Nobody else
[1:57:07] could do it. They was all sexual after
[1:57:10] the devil.
[1:57:14] The next time you look in the mirror and
[1:57:17] you think you're so cute and you
[1:57:20] brothers are so handsome and you just
[1:57:21] think I am God's gift to women, look at
[1:57:26] me. Look at that profile.
[1:57:29] My hair, my teeth, my crooked nose, my
[1:57:35] big long floppy ears. You're a child of
[1:57:38] the devil.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about your body.
[1:57:44] Every man, whether he's a priest, oh
[1:57:46] hallelujah, or a prophet or a king, he's
[1:57:49] born between Satan and Eve. And yet we
[1:57:52] idolize
[1:57:54] this byproduct
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; of Satan.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:58:10] She brought
[1:58:12] a bastard child
[1:58:16] we are all children of. But God came in
[1:58:20] the flesh to give us another birth.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; To bring us back to the original sons
[1:58:25] and daughters of God. There you are.
[1:58:29] Just like Christ would have come to the
[1:58:31] group. He would have come to his church.
[1:58:33] He promised it. God promised to
[1:58:36] multiply.
[1:58:38] But they had to wait until God's time.
[1:58:40] That's right.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; That's what's the matter today. They
[1:58:44] don't want to wait to God's time.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; And how many brides moves and brides
[1:58:50] revivals have we seen? Now remember,
[1:58:52] every generation gets its chance at a
[1:58:55] real revival. Every generation of our
[1:58:57] young people will get their own chance.
[1:58:58] And you watch what Satan will do. He'll
[1:59:00] raise up a man from Europe, raise up one
[1:59:02] from Germany, raise up one from Arizona,
[1:59:05] from here or there or there. and they'll
[1:59:06] go out there and they'll forrun that
[1:59:08] genuine move of God, go to pulling
[1:59:11] people off to themsel, form a little
[1:59:13] denominational idea, and they'll have,
[1:59:15] you know, sometimes it's emotional,
[1:59:16] sometimes it's intellectual. And what's
[1:59:18] it there for? To forrun what God's
[1:59:20] fixing to do for the young people of
[1:59:22] that generation. Cuz God don't want you
[1:59:24] young people going in on my experience
[1:59:26] or your mom and daddy's experience. He
[1:59:28] wants every generation, listen to me,
[1:59:30] young people, God wants every generation
[1:59:33] to have your chance at a revival. your
[1:59:36] chance at the word of God. The world
[1:59:37] will never receive one, but the
[1:59:39] generational people and our young people
[1:59:41] in our message can have one if they want
[1:59:44] it. Do you want the memory of your
[1:59:46] mama's revival, the memory of your
[1:59:48] daddy's revival, or do you want your own
[1:59:50] revival?
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; It won't be a bunch of hooped up
[1:59:53] hollowing you this and that and the
[1:59:54] other and then people that when they hit
[1:59:56] the ground can't live right. They'll be
[1:59:58] born of the spirit of God casting out
[2:00:00] devil. Oh yes, the supernatural will
[2:00:02] follow their life. But when they're not
[2:00:04] casting out devils, they're still living
[2:00:06] so godly and so holy.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; My Let me find a place to close.
[2:00:17] I'm surprised y'all didn't say glory.
[2:00:19] Hallelujah.
[2:00:22] The reason that Adam's bride never did
[2:00:24] bear right the lifechild is because she
[2:00:27] disbelieved God's word.
[2:00:30] If that's right, say amen.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Now you see what you done.
[2:00:42] You fulfilled those words after what he
[2:00:44] said. So you became momentarily
[2:00:49] that quote.
[2:00:53] But if you could do it once, I'd say you
[2:00:56] start doing it more often.
[2:00:58] Now, not just saying amen. Not just
[2:01:00] saying amen, but living. Amen.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Living.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; The reason Jehovah's wife was put away
[2:01:12] or his bride was because she rejected
[2:01:14] God's word,
[2:01:19] the prophet.
[2:01:22] Is that right? The reason Christ's bride
[2:01:25] is not was
[2:01:28] is put away in divorcement is because
[2:01:31] she has rejected the word of God like
[2:01:34] Eve did like the rest of them. Exactly.
[2:01:38] All
[2:01:41] I know. I know that's plain talk. All
[2:01:44] All polluted.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Their husband couldn't get to them. They
[2:01:50] was already pregnantated.
[2:01:52] before their husband got to them.
[2:01:58] Brother Donnie, what do we look for?
[2:02:02] We look and wait patiently for the
[2:02:05] promised word of this hour to be
[2:02:08] fulfilled in our lives.
[2:02:11] That's love, faith, virtue, knowledge,
[2:02:13] temperance, godliness, brotherly
[2:02:15] kindness, all these things. But it also
[2:02:16] includes casting out devils, healing the
[2:02:19] sick. It includes every word that God
[2:02:22] has emphasized in this day.
[2:02:25] And you know what gets me is Satan has
[2:02:28] sent men in and around this message that
[2:02:32] fall in. And no doubt the final climax
[2:02:36] of the dynamic striking the bride will
[2:02:39] be such a wonderful awesome thing
[2:02:43] that before it happens,
[2:02:46] Satan will have some men going around
[2:02:48] and saying this and that and the other
[2:02:52] and it will forrun not just the bride's
[2:02:55] revival but the bride's body change.
[2:02:59] Yeah.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; And what does it do? Then when the
[2:03:02] spirit of God really goes to moving,
[2:03:05] then people say, "We've done heard
[2:03:07] that." Yeah, we've done heard and saying
[2:03:09] that. Look what happened. Yeah. Look at
[2:03:11] this mistake. Look at that mistake. This
[2:03:13] person was called out and told this and
[2:03:14] this one was called out and told that
[2:03:16] and come to find out it never even
[2:03:17] happened and this wasn't even true and
[2:03:18] this this preacher run away with that
[2:03:20] man's wife and this man done this and
[2:03:22] that and another. Don't you understand?
[2:03:24] It's scarecrows
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; to scare you.
[2:03:28] Well, maybe I'm quite simple and I know
[2:03:30] I am, but how I thought scarecrows were
[2:03:33] built to scarecrows.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; not built to scare eagles.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; I myself
[2:03:44] am waiting, looking, longing
[2:03:50] for the refilling of the Holy Ghost in
[2:03:52] this church.
[2:03:55] And what will be the dynamics of this
[2:03:57] church of refilling of the Holy Ghost?
[2:03:59] We've worked in part while the headstone
[2:04:03] has been descending the headstone for
[2:04:06] what? On top of the body. So if you got
[2:04:09] a headstone that's this size and the
[2:04:11] only thing you've got is faith and your
[2:04:13] foundation is this big and you bring the
[2:04:15] headstone down and set it on top of that
[2:04:18] big foundation.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; And you're going to say, "I'm a complete
[2:04:22] Christian. I'm ready to go." No, you're
[2:04:24] not.
[2:04:26] Each layer has to be there. And as the
[2:04:28] layers come, it's getting narrower,
[2:04:30] narrow, narrow, and narrow.
[2:04:34] And then right on top, brotherly
[2:04:36] kindness, we'll be right there for only
[2:04:38] God knows how long. And there'll be this
[2:04:41] flat edge right on the very top of us.
[2:04:44] The flatness proves to us we're waiting
[2:04:47] on something. And what comes the
[2:04:50] headstone which is a miniature pyramid
[2:04:55] itself. So it's Christ. It's all of him
[2:04:58] in the form of charity now coming to set
[2:05:01] down right on the very top of this
[2:05:03] pyramid.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; And when he does the dead in Christ
[2:05:06] shall rise first.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; It won't be a repeat of Pentecost. It
[2:05:14] will not be a repeat of Acts 2 or 1906.
[2:05:17] No. It's going to be a resurrection from
[2:05:19] the dead.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; It will be so massive. All the saints of
[2:05:24] God will be released out of the sixth
[2:05:26] dimension in a moment of time.
[2:05:32] Praise be to God.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to be ready?
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Stand.
[2:05:48] [Applause]
[2:05:56] Ecclesiastes 7:8
[2:05:59] says it this way, "Better is the end of
[2:06:02] a thing than the beginning thereof.
[2:06:06] And the patient in spirit
[2:06:09] is better
[2:06:11] than the proud in spirit."
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's good. The patient in spirit
[2:06:16] is better than the proud in spirit.
[2:06:20] Let's bow our heads together.
[2:06:28] Lord Jesus,
[2:06:32] I pray you'd help us. Lord,
[2:06:36] help me. Lord, and
[2:06:39] every one of your God called men
[2:06:42] that are around the world
[2:06:45] trying to do their best
[2:06:48] to bring a pure word
[2:06:51] not
[2:06:53] added with human ideas and conceptions
[2:06:56] and
[2:06:58] just seed word.
[2:07:01] Help each of us, Father, to realize what
[2:07:03] a responsibility us preachers have. I
[2:07:06] know one day I'll have to stand before
[2:07:08] you and give an account for every sermon
[2:07:10] that I've ever preached.
[2:07:13] I've never preached a perfect one.
[2:07:16] Every one of them's had flaws in them. I
[2:07:20] misqued a scripture or misqued a quote
[2:07:22] or whatever. I didn't intentionally do
[2:07:25] it, but it's just the human part. That
[2:07:28] can be pretty discouraging within
[2:07:29] itself.
[2:07:31] to think you've given decades of your
[2:07:33] life doing a certain thing and you
[2:07:35] actually never
[2:07:37] master it. You never really become very
[2:07:40] good at it. It's like someone else is
[2:07:43] using you for that purpose and they
[2:07:44] don't want you to have glory,
[2:07:47] which is fine with me.
[2:07:50] I don't worry about the glory part, but
[2:07:52] I'll tell you, sir, there's something
[2:07:53] that does concern me.
[2:07:55] I don't want to fail you.
[2:07:58] I don't want to fail you.
[2:08:00] I don't want to fail your children.
[2:08:03] I know many of these people here today,
[2:08:05] they've been hurt, let down by
[2:08:06] preachers. Many that'll stream this
[2:08:07] service from different parts of the
[2:08:09] world. They've been let down by
[2:08:10] preachers, confused by preachers.
[2:08:13] Some of them are ain't but one preacher
[2:08:15] away from not even believing preachers
[2:08:17] at all.
[2:08:20] But I pray we could learn from the
[2:08:21] example of the prophet of God as he was
[2:08:25] treated so bad by preachers.
[2:08:29] They did so many things to him.
[2:08:34] And yet
[2:08:36] he wanted both of his sons to become
[2:08:38] preachers
[2:08:40] because to him it was one of the highest
[2:08:43] honors that they could ever have.
[2:08:47] So that teaches us something, Lord, that
[2:08:51] he himself knew more about him. And
[2:08:52] unlike me, I'll hug a brother's neck and
[2:08:54] say, "Oh, brother, I love you so much
[2:08:55] and you're such a dear friend." And
[2:08:57] little do I realize that dear friend or
[2:08:59] that person I'm calling a dear friend
[2:09:01] has a knife and they're fixing to lay it
[2:09:04] wide open in my back
[2:09:07] cuz I like all these people have been
[2:09:09] deceived by people.
[2:09:13] I've been deceived by people. I've been
[2:09:14] deceived by preachers.
[2:09:18] But I still believe in them today, Lord.
[2:09:20] And I thank you for that.
[2:09:23] We believe that we still need God call
[2:09:25] men to be able to bring the word and
[2:09:28] help us to be able to build this stature
[2:09:32] of a perfect man.
[2:09:34] It'll truly be a miracle when it's
[2:09:36] accomplished that all around the world
[2:09:37] the elect of God will come to that place
[2:09:40] finally on one day whenever it is
[2:09:45] every one of them will have reached that
[2:09:47] place
[2:09:49] and you'll be able to leave the throne
[2:09:52] and come and take us home.
[2:09:55] How we long for that day Lord Jesus.
[2:09:59] I pray you'd help me and these sheep
[2:10:02] that you've committed to my charge, my
[2:10:04] father.
[2:10:06] May I be faithful. May I be true.
[2:10:11] Lord God, help every servant, every man
[2:10:14] of God here today that we would like
[2:10:18] never before have such a desire to serve
[2:10:22] your little bride,
[2:10:25] to lay our own agendas, our own ideas
[2:10:27] aside, to preach Christ Jesus.
[2:10:32] Not to preach ourselves,
[2:10:34] but to preach you.
[2:10:36] Oh God, we love you so much. We worship
[2:10:40] you today, Father.
[2:10:43] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[2:10:47] With every head bowed, with no one
[2:10:49] looking around, please, I wonder, is
[2:10:50] there anyone here today that say
[2:10:53] I I I realize, Brother Donnie, after
[2:10:55] hearing this, I I need a closer walk
[2:10:58] with the Lord. I I don't want to be
[2:11:01] caught up in nothing that displeases
[2:11:04] God. God bless you. God bless you,
[2:11:06] saints. God bless you. Amen. Me too. I
[2:11:09] raise both my hands. Lord Jesus, I want
[2:11:12] to be more like you, Father.
[2:11:15] Oh Jesus, we worship you today.
[2:11:19] We adore you, Lord God. We bless your
[2:11:21] holy name.
[2:11:24] Thank you, Father.
[2:11:27] Oh, can we just love him? Now, let's
[2:11:28] just close our eyes and open our hearts
[2:11:32] to him. Now, remember, he's not just
[2:11:35] your savior. If you're bride,
[2:11:38] he's not just your Lord. If you're
[2:11:41] bride,
[2:11:42] he's your husband.
[2:11:45] And he wants to be your lover.
[2:11:49] He wants to be your lover. Remember the
[2:11:51] prophet tells us that 1956. He says
[2:11:53] these simple great words. God is a lover
[2:11:58] and he wants to take some of your
[2:12:00] starchy hearts
[2:12:02] and make love to you.
[2:12:06] So God wants to come near us.
[2:12:09] Not just in church or he does in church,
[2:12:11] but he wants to come near us. Maybe on
[2:12:14] your job, at home, wherever it is.
[2:12:18] And him just surrounds you with his
[2:12:20] presence.
[2:12:21] And then you go to responding and
[2:12:23] reacting. Lord Jesus, I love you. I love
[2:12:26] you, Father.
[2:12:29] You sisters, you and your husband are in
[2:12:32] love.
[2:12:33] You love each other. You know what it
[2:12:35] means to you if he just walks up and
[2:12:38] puts his arms around you and tells you
[2:12:40] how much he loves you. You're the most
[2:12:43] precious woman in all the world to him.
[2:12:47] It just does something to you. I don't
[2:12:49] care if you've been married 40 years, 50
[2:12:51] years. It just does something to you.
[2:12:56] Oh, when Jesus comes near us, you
[2:12:58] realize that's his presence coming near
[2:13:01] us. It's him in the God form. putting
[2:13:04] his arms, as it were, around you and
[2:13:08] pulling you up close to him and
[2:13:10] whispering secrets to you.
[2:13:13] I love you before the world began. You
[2:13:16] were mine. I called you. I chose you and
[2:13:21] nothing can pull you out of my care. Oh,
[2:13:25] hallelujah.
[2:13:27] Praise be to God.
[2:13:30] Praise be to God.
[2:13:33] Can we just worship him just a little
[2:13:34] bit? Now, I know some of you heard the
[2:13:37] service that I preached over at Brother
[2:13:39] Joe's the other night, but let me repeat
[2:13:41] it again. When the Schulamite is coming
[2:13:43] up the ascent up to Jerusalem,
[2:13:46] and she's on Solomon's palquin,
[2:13:50] it has elements of silver, gold, purple.
[2:13:54] The little carpet laying on the bottom
[2:13:56] of the paloquin was interwoven with
[2:13:59] fabric of colors. And they would as they
[2:14:03] would plat this together and have
[2:14:06] interwoven stories of victories inside
[2:14:10] that carpet. And that poor little
[2:14:13] Galilean girl probably never even seen a
[2:14:16] paloquin in her life.
[2:14:19] But yet those men on the outside, 60 men
[2:14:22] of the strongest of Israel,
[2:14:25] and they would give their life for her.
[2:14:31] It's about a twoight journey.
[2:14:35] And the Bible said they had their sword
[2:14:37] strapped to their side because of fear
[2:14:40] of the night.
[2:14:42] It's where we are, but Joel, the
[2:14:45] nighttime, the darkness, it's all around
[2:14:47] us. But God's got some pastors, some
[2:14:50] evangelists, some teachers on the earth
[2:14:53] to help the little bride.
[2:14:55] But they can only help you
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; if you will allow them to.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; Why would you be in such horrific
[2:15:04] battles in your life and not reach out
[2:15:07] to servants of God to help you? I don't
[2:15:09] understand.
[2:15:11] They're here to help you. They're here
[2:15:13] to encourage. They're here to speak
[2:15:15] words of encouragement and offer prayer.
[2:15:20] And the verse six there it says
[2:15:23] describing her and then it's like a
[2:15:25] voice of someone in Jerusalem or in the
[2:15:28] nether part of Jerusalem coming down the
[2:15:30] rampart and looking down through there
[2:15:32] and they see they see as they're coming
[2:15:36] and it's the bridal party
[2:15:38] and this voice rings out. Who is this?
[2:15:44] Who is this that cometh from the
[2:15:46] wilderness?
[2:15:49] And then this voice describes what they
[2:15:52] saw
[2:15:53] that they saw this this coming this this
[2:15:56] person. Who is this? Who is this
[2:16:00] different person asked the same thing in
[2:16:02] the book of Isaiah?
[2:16:04] Who is this that cometh from Boazer
[2:16:10] with dyed garments on? Another
[2:16:14] person asked it in the book of Matthew,
[2:16:18] "Who is this
[2:16:20] that the whole city
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; is an uproar about?"
[2:16:26] You see what who all this who this is,
[2:16:28] don't you? It's about the bride and his
[2:16:31] groom.
[2:16:32] And they saw these pillars of smoke, two
[2:16:35] great columns of smoke arising. If you
[2:16:39] read that, you notice they didn't say
[2:16:40] pillars of fire.
[2:16:43] but pillars of smoke.
[2:16:47] So, an altar of incense and an altar of
[2:16:50] sacrifice, myrrh, frankincense, all
[2:16:54] these expensive, truly exotic spices
[2:16:58] that were offered and they were coming
[2:17:00] right up with the bride. So, they were
[2:17:02] waving branches. It must have been a
[2:17:04] sight to behold. They're waving branches
[2:17:08] as she's coming and singing and praising
[2:17:11] and and all this. And here's solemn. Now
[2:17:13] remember, against protocol for him to go
[2:17:16] to her land of Shunam in the upper
[2:17:19] northern part of the Galilee of
[2:17:21] Issachar.
[2:17:22] Against protocol for him to go all the
[2:17:24] way to her land and set his foot on her
[2:17:28] land.
[2:17:30] But he sent his own paloquin and he's
[2:17:33] going to leave his home and she's left
[2:17:36] her home and they're going to meet out
[2:17:38] there in the middle somewhere.
[2:17:42] Our Lord Jesus don't put his foot upon
[2:17:44] this earth.
[2:17:46] But we'll leave our home and he'll leave
[2:17:48] his and we'll meet in the middle of the
[2:17:51] air where the heavens is expanded to
[2:17:54] receive us.
[2:17:56] There will be multiplied millions.
[2:17:59] Millions.
[2:18:01] Now remember, Peter's going to get his
[2:18:03] glorified body. He ain't got it yet. All
[2:18:06] the church ages are waiting on us. I
[2:18:09] don't blame the devil. I'd be doing all
[2:18:10] the work he's doing, too.
[2:18:13] If he can keep us fussing and fighting
[2:18:15] and arguing and following the survival
[2:18:16] and that and that and that. He knows the
[2:18:18] resurrection will be held.
[2:18:25] But here she comes and Solomon steps out
[2:18:29] crowned with the crown that his mother
[2:18:33] gave him.
[2:18:36] You imagine the little lady as they come
[2:18:38] up the soldiers and the paloquin stops
[2:18:41] and one of the soldiers pull back the
[2:18:43] curtain and said, "We have arrived,
[2:18:47] my lady."
[2:18:54] She must have been so nervous and so
[2:18:57] apprehensive.
[2:18:58] She'd probably never even seen a
[2:19:00] paloquin before in her life.
[2:19:03] But she stepped out. Let's just say for
[2:19:06] the sake of today's sermon and she
[2:19:09] stepped down the seven steps
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; because she ascended the seven steps to
[2:19:15] come up in and sat down.
[2:19:19] And one of the guards comes, "My lady,
[2:19:24] takes her by the hand."
[2:19:29] Two days before she was tending sheep
[2:19:31] and picking maiders and cucumbers. And
[2:19:36] do you understand? You may get up one
[2:19:38] morning to go out and pick your flowers
[2:19:40] and and feed your cows and water your
[2:19:42] dogs and take care of your cat if you
[2:19:44] got one of them things. And you may be
[2:19:46] out there, you know, washing your car,
[2:19:48] brother down, painting the door, the
[2:19:50] last door you'll ever paint.
[2:19:53] And that very evening,
[2:19:56] you'll be in another dimension.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; Let's get ready.
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; Let's get ready.
[2:20:10] Don't you want to go to that land? Don't
[2:20:15] you want to go to that land? Don't you
[2:20:19] want to go to that land where I'm bound?
[2:20:28] Don't you want to go to that land? Don't
[2:20:32] you want to go to that land? Don't you
[2:20:37] want to go to that land where I'm bound?
[2:20:45] There'll be no dying in that land. Ain't
[2:20:50] God
[2:20:52] in that land. There'll be no dying in
[2:20:57] that land where we're bound.
[2:21:03] Be no dying in that land.
[2:21:08] Be no dying. Let's say it now, children.
[2:21:13] dying in that land where I'm bound.
[2:21:20] There's only joy in that land.
[2:21:25] Only joy. No sadness, no trouble, no
[2:21:29] heartaches.
[2:21:31] Only joy in that land where the bride is
[2:21:35] found.
[2:21:38] Only joy and peace in that land.
[2:21:43] Only joy in that land.
[2:21:47] Only joy in that land where I'm bound.
[2:21:54] Let's sing it together now. Don't you
[2:21:56] want to go? Don't you want to go to that
[2:21:59] land? Don't you want to go to that land?
[2:22:05] Don't you want to go to that land where
[2:22:10] I'm mine?
[2:22:14] Don't you want to go to that land? Don't
[2:22:18] you want to go to that land? Don't you
[2:22:23] want to go to that land where I'm bound?
[2:22:33] [Music]
[2:22:35] Praise God. Turn around, shake, come at
[2:22:37] somebody's hand and say, "I want to see
[2:22:39] you there at that land.
[2:22:42] I want to see all of you children. Oh, I
[2:22:45] want to see you." Hallelujah. Oh, I want
[2:22:49] to see him. Look upon his face. Let's
[2:22:53] sing a little now before we go.
[2:22:56] Ever of his saving grace.
[2:23:01] Now on the streets of glory,
[2:23:04] let me lift my voice.
[2:23:07] My cares aren't pass on my last ever to
[2:23:13] rejoice.
[2:23:14] Well, oh, I want to see him. Look upon
[2:23:19] his face.
[2:23:33] My voice
[2:23:35] cares all past at last ever to rejoice.
[2:23:42] Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his
[2:23:47] face
[2:23:49] there to sing forever
[2:23:52] of his saving grace.
[2:23:56] On the streets of glory,
[2:23:59] let me lift my voice.
[2:24:02] Cares all past, home at last, ever to
[2:24:07] rejoice
[2:24:09] as I journey through the land. Singing
[2:24:13] as I go,
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; as I go,
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; pointing souls to Calary. Come on, let's
[2:24:19] sing it together. Crimson flow. Thank
[2:24:21] you, Lord God. Many arrows pierce my
[2:24:25] soul from without.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord.
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; But my Lord leads me.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, he does.
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; Everybody
[2:24:36] I want to see him. Look upon his face.
