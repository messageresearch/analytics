Lord in your life without him being the guidepost and helping you through all the things of life I know I know people do it every day but I ain't one of them aren't you glad you ain't one of them I know people think it's small it's inferior when I was in China several years ago and preaching in those meetings there there were professors School teachers people of every occupation that you you can imagine and the type that the communist government thought would not search for God if you can educate them and give them this and that then that'll do away with the need of God yeah but I sat there and looked at them people and I thought there was still something in them even though they were professors teachers mathematicians and all of that but you can't satisfy the soul with mass amen you can't satis y it with algebra you can't satisfy it with money it's made to search for God when it's all said and done friends and when our heart is slowing down the blood pressure is dropping and we get ready to cross over all you own won't amount to nothing what you think you are won't amount to nothing what's going to really matter is you know him I'm glad I do don't you let's turn tonight to Matthew chapter 16 how are y'all we're well doing good doing good thanks for asking how he's happy to be in the house of the Lord ain't it wonderful to be a Christian just awesome to be a be a child of God Matthew chapter 16 verse 18 let's look tonight and see what we are a part of by the grace of the Lord the Lord Jesus saying these words and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church I will build my church now what is an organization an organization is a man-made system there are also many independent churches that are manmade churches yeah if Jesus don't build them they're not hisen now people can put his name on the sign that still don't mean he built that church because Jesus uses a particular type of material and this is the way you'll always know that Jesus founded whatever Church you're going to whatever one you're looking at or fellowshipping or whatever the traits of the Builder will be in there and you'll be able to identify it by its characteristics its traits its foundation and the building material that is used this is it Upon This Rock I will build my church so what was the rock of course The Rock was Revelation revelation of who he is not who he was so the churches of this day that are built by Jesus himself will be focusing on who and what he is in 2023 and shortly 2024 right so if they're built upon a memory of what he was 2,000 years ago that's not a church that Jesus Built right amen cuz Upon This Rock he said I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it acts 15 verse1 now some traits and characteristics of this church now a few years after Jesus starts building and certain men which came down from Judea taught the Brethren and said except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved now notice certain men don't call them Brethren just calls them men certain men came down from Judea and taught the Brethren yeah so here was some men that were not Brethren but they were teaching the Brethren how in the world did that happen so you got man that's not even born again and somehow the Brethren let them among them and start teaching them wow that ought to be a double wow we ought to take warning an't that amazing certain men which came down from Judea taught the Brethren and said except you speak in tongues you ain't got to hold holy ghost or except you run and Shout you're not the bride I see then it was circumcision but it's changed in every age and it's happening in our ranks as well that we're making new evidences of what the bride is we've had so many bride revivals I can't even keep up with them but let me tell you what the bride Revival won't be the bride's Revival will not be hacking and splicing and cutting the word or the message and putting it together to fit your idea it won't be that now of course they were saying this because this was such an important thing in that day and this day we don't even think nothing about it so the evidence will change but that Spirit never changed except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no SM small no small dissension and disputation with them wow so Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain other of them should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and Elders about this question now you see because the scarecrow has been so effective for thousands of years if we would try to do this today in our message people would start screaming denomination denomination denomination you know why the scarecrow has started scaring Eagles now this is the way the original Church operated and the devil put up a scarecrow of the name of denomination and they started pulling some of these things out of there and Satan knew it would scare the elect from the 3 Century right on down and it still scared them notice in verse three and being brought on their way by the church they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria declaring the conversion of the Gentiles and they caused Great Joy unto all the Brethren and when they were come to Jerusalem they were received of the church and of the Apostles and Elders wow Paul the prophet a church AG messenger had to be received by the church and by the apostles and the elders oh why didn't he get this attitude I don't care if y'all don't think I'm of God or not glory to God go on to Hell well that's the attitude a lot of the men message folks have I did say message folks not real Believers you see real message Believers know that brother bram's message is not something new on now it's a restoration to the original amen now you see a lot of message people do not believe that they can never believe a lot of the doctrines they do they could never stay home play tapes don't need preachers no more all that the reason they believe that is because they believe this message is something totally new and if you believe that tonight I pray to God you get the Holy Ghost before you leave this service cuz you ain't got it now cuz the Holy Ghost will never lead you to believe a lie because the prophet messenger come to return the hearts of the children back to the apostolic fathers and the church said and they declared all sa that God had done for them I me like to be remembered tonight as we pray sister Wendy Asher has an aunt that has a real need and they want this prayer cloth so just hold that request in your heart as well as you pray over what you have need of heavenly father we so love you tonight oh I'm so glad to be back in church I'm so thankful when you saved me you saved me to go to church you saved me to sing you saved me to worship you saved me to pray you saved me to live right you saved me to Rejoice you saved me from heaven and you saved me from hell I don't worry about being lost cuz I didn't come from there and I ain't going going there how grateful We Are Tonight Lord Jesus for your mercy father as we approach your word tonight we're asking for your help we're asking dear God that you'd help me to get out of the way help the people to be able to enter in the service Lord they've worked today many of them and no doubt they're tired and would your presence just come and catch us up Lord father I know there's several that's sick and couldn't be with us in service tonight we ask that You' be mindful of them Lord I have this prayer cost in my hand for sister Wendy's Aunt you know all about this need and request and we believe you father that you're going to move for dear God we desire to be with all of our hearts one of those churches that has been turned back to the apostolic faith help us I pray Lord God In The Name of Jesus Christ and the church said amen God bless you you may be seated now I'm sure that you all believe already tonight that just because people say they are Apostolic does not mean that they are the original Apostolic anybody here ever belong to the UPC Church of God in Christ few of you Church of God in Christ one is Church of God the black side of that UPC thing probably nobody many of them claim to be Apostolic but basically what they preach is one God and they don't even have it correct and water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus I was at a funeral some time ago of an Apostolic man a family member close to someone of mine and the preacher which was Apostolic of course got up and every way that he could he tried to bring in Acts 238 and uh speaking in tongues evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues and preaching this guy's funeral but also trying to get forth his Apostolic Doctrine now many of those Apostolic preachers they they are specifically known for acts 238 and a lot of them turn into preachers that carry an Acts and 238s so that's all they know how to do with that scripture is fight with it and they will fight you and they will get angry and they will get upset and they have no mercy whatsoever for someone that maybe God has never opened their understanding to that so they take their Axe and cut their heads off and if there's anything left they pull out both 38s and finish them off with that and as I sat there listening to that man's funeral and I thought you know I knew the man well and knew the man was a good man loved God with all of his heart but yet this preacher saw it as an opportunity to be able to convey once again their so-called Apostolic Doctrine but I had talked to some of those people years before about the message ah mentioned predestination serpent SE some of the different doctrines that we know the apostles actually preached and what I found was that those Apostolic people wasn't Apostolic at all they were Apostolic denomination so because they baptized in jesus' name and because they preach the tongues as the evidence of the Holy Ghost and you shout and this and that then you're true Apostolic no you're just Apostolic by name but there is a true Apostolic people on the face of the Earth today so true Apostolic people are built upon the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets so the true Apostolic people are those that can tie their original Roots back to the church in the book of Acts which was what Jesus started himself now Jesus said himself on this rock I will build my church now it may be kind of offensive a little bit but as I said earlier every church that's built on every Church Corner between here and Memphis and back is not built by the Lord Jesus because Jesus could go in there and start just preaching a little bit about his word we'll say he would start in the Book of John and he might say something like this in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and many might come on down to verse 14 and say and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth some of them might make it to the end of that and say amen and then we might bring Jesus over to St John 10 when Jesus would say I and my father are one amen we might bring him over to where Phillip said so Lord show us the father and he said Phillip have I been with you so long and you don't know who I am if you see me you see the father well right there a bunch of the trinitarians would fall out of their Pew would they and yet they claim to be following Jesus well Jesus was actually the one who said that and then we come over to the first church AG messenger that was the foundation stone that God began to build a lot of these Revelations on what he gave him and he would say something like this for without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifest In the Flesh just in the justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles who did God God then we might come to the book of Titus where he said Hing to and the coming of the day of God in that day when the Lord Jesus will come himself you mean calling Jesus God not one of them but him Jesus wasn't one of the Gods in heaven he was the only one and we might move over to the Book of Revelation when John was carried up and he said I saw one and I saw a throne not three but I saw one throne and he that sat upon the throne was to look upon as a Jasper and a Sardis Stone which was the birth stones of the tribes of Israel so I wonder how many churches in the tri cities that the Lord Jesus would Acclaim that he himself started that church and it would be identification that all would know because the building material that church is built upon so it's built upon the Revelation then of who Jesus is in this age and yet many of them will take people down to the water and they'll say in obedience to the Commandment of the Lord Jesus I baptize you in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost so in other words you spiritually baptize them into the Catholic Church well glory to God I thought y'all was Apostolic here tonight so I wonder then how many of them that Jesus would stand up and say I did not build my church upon the teaching that speaking in tongues was the evidence of the Holy Ghost well there'd be some more that'd get mad at Jesus and then others that would say well you know I I believe once in Grace always in Grace and once you get saved as a matter of fact this I was going hunting this last week and on and one of the brothers just telling me that he had Hunted been around a guy up there where we were some time before this and the guy was cussing I mean cussing everything off the hinges and the brother asked him he said uh what do you do he said I'm a licensed ordained minister oh my goodness so I doubt Jesus would want to put his arm around that dude and call him buddy wouldn't you so you can imagine then one church after another after another the Lord Jesus J would say you are not mine I never built this church as a matter of fact this one was built by this organization or this man or this or that or the other this is not even my church my name is not here my Revelation is not what built you it was built out of Envy or Strife or whatever more this is not my church it's going to be surprising when we get to the end of the way and a lot of people stand before the Lord and they will stand there sinking you know that I've done this and that and the other and the Lord Jesus will look at them and I know some of the brothers right now don't like it whenever preachers will still preach on Matthew 24:24 but I've got to because I'm a Full Gospel preacher and I believe in healings and signs and wonders and miracles but by no means do I believe that the bride's only identification is the miraculous because there's going to be all kinds of people that's going to stand before the Lord and say we cast out Devils we raise the Dead We heal the sick in your name come on church and they will absolutely be anointed I heard the prophet say it today it is the true anointing of the Holy Ghost but they are anointed falsely to the word so you mean the spirit of God would come upon people and anoint them fall ly to the word so you don't judge them by their signs or their miracles or how much they jump or dance or shout but what you judge them by is the word that includes me that includes every other preacher that includes every one of us and the church said am so the church then that Jesus is going to come for in the last days is going to be an Apostolic Bible believing church now keep in mind that God did not send brother brandom in order to replace our Bible but to make our Bible more real to us is that right is that the way you believe it and understand it so he did not come to sim brother brandom so that people would formulate their doctrines outside of the context of scripture and they would come up with all kinds of strange ideas which of course is going to be in every age but he would come right back cuz when he would be on the curtain of time and he saw his people only didn't see Paul's did not see Luther's did not see Wesley's but he saw his only and whenever he reconciled and he told the angel said if Paul's group goes in mine will and then those thousands I heard him say it today that there was hundreds of thousands of those people looked like there could have been millions that was there and they screamed out we are resting on that and they said one day Jesus will come to you and you will be judged and if you are accepted and you will be then we will go in on your teaching so that would be totally impossible for us to go in on brother brandom's teaching unless he was a word Prophet praise the Lord so Paul didn't say one thing and brother Ram say something else now he might have said it in a Kentucky way where Paul said it in his way but it's still the word of God now whatever the Lord started forming this church he knew of course that there would be Seven Ages it would be spread over seven dispensations and there would be seven manifestations of the spirit of God in the Book of Revelation it would be called the seven spirits of God but it would be seven manifestations of the same spirit of God each one of them would be represented by a horn on the Beast and then there would be an eye in the horn now these were actually the horns were the power on the earth which protected the Lamb's rights so in the first church age there was a horn which was under the lion anointing and there was an eye in the horn oh you're trying to get deep brother Donnie no I'm not I just want you to know where you're identified and where every age has been so a horn come up on there and that was the church that was the true Acts 2 church then in that horn was an eye so the eye represented the sear or the dispensation of light that was given to them so he saw seven horns and then he saw seven eyes an eye in each horn so it was the messenger of that age so the eye of the age catches the mind of God looks into the script of God catches the word of the day pulls it down into the horn and then the horn gets under the manifestation of that word you following me of what their word is for their day cuz we didn't know what our word was the Ephesian people didn't know what their word was the Samarian people pergamos saus Sardis Philadelphia and leoda we didn't know what our word was and every Church age message if you notice in the Book of Revelation unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write notice who the letter is addressed to it's not addressed to the denominational headquarters it's not sent to a bunch of Bishops that's going to tell everybody what they can do and cannot do come on church say Amen but who is the letter sent to it is sent to the church M messenger the angel of God of that day he is the eye on the horn so the eye gets the message direct from God then the eye comes right down and projects it down to the horn and then the horn protects the Lamb's rights in that day now we're talking about the bride's rights but also the Lamb of God has rights this is one thing we're called to do we're not called to be passive we're not called to let the world do whatever they want to do and people just say whatever they want to say and let's just s around and hold our peace and and be real quiet Paul didn't believe that Paul and Barnabas did not have no small dissension and disputation with those that was teaching contrary to the word of God they confronted them and said you're not saying the truth well come on now children this is what we are called to do we are called to protect the Lamb's rights in this leot to sin age now everybody in this age one of the most important things to them is what their rights so the gay rights and the you know this rights and that's right well that's fine if that's what they want to do but the Lamb of God also has rights he has a right to have a church he has a right to have a church filled with the Holy Ghost a church built upon the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets is that right and he's not going to send Gabriel down to protect those rights but he's going to have men of God under the same anointing that the eye brought it I don't want to just repeat what brother random said I don't want to just repeat it like a tap recorder but I want to have the same spirit of God he had I want to operate under the same thing that's what I love when he writes it down pick up your pen and write in the spoken words original see that the bride not only has the word but she has the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word it's evident friends a lot of churches and a lot of preachers around this message are missing the mind of Christ notice the seven seal he said whenever the mind of Christ comes in that is the supernatural element so people can come to the message but it does not mean they get the immediate oh my the immediate deposit of the mind of Christ just when you hand them a book if they do not have the mind of Christ they'll never know what God wants done by that word but if you receive the mind of Christ with the message itself then you know what he wants done it's evident some folks still don't know what he wants done they think he wants us to argue and debate and make this little kingdom and that little kingdom that's not what he wants done with the word he wants us as preachers to preach the word and produce word first and Obey them scriptures lay hands on the sick I know some of the preachers in the message they're fighting laying hands on the sick and they say we're Beyond it we don't need it no more I'll guarantee you one thing we've still got a lot of sick folks around here and I'm going to still keep on go brother Donnie brother brandom got to a place he never had no more Visions I want you to show me that in the message I'll tell you when brother brandom stop having visions when he move into the other dimension you want to tell me the prophet stopped praying for people people and the prophet start having prayer line I want you to show me that where he said that himself what did he do he was still ministering to the body right before he left the Earth and that's what every godall man is called to do cast out Devils lay hands on the sick praise the Lord now notice if here in the chapter 15 again verse 5 but there arose up a certain set wow of the Pharisees which believed wow so you mean they still kept their old name on Pharisees that believed I guess my question would be believed what how could you be a believer and still want to be called a Pharisee or a sad you see I think some of y'all are sad you that it was needful to circumcise them how could they believe how could they be word born Christians and still believe you had to be circumcised In the Flesh they had no Revelation that the Holy Ghost was the tool of circumcision in the New Testament they had no idea it was still to do with this right here amen that it was needful to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses and the apostles and the elders came together for to consider of this matter now notice they did not consider it denominational at all when questions raised up for the preachers to get together and try to resolve some of these issues come on wonder why that's so foreign to us come on now wonder why that's so strange and we're Apostolic are we really I wonder I wonder how many Apostolic churches we actually have in the message we have a lot of message churches but I wonder if they're Apostolic message churches you hear what some of them is preaching you can understand they're a long way from the doctrine of the Apostles verse 22 then pleased it the apostles and Elders with the whole church to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas wow so what if we hear there's some kind of Doctrine that's broke out wherever and then some of the brothers get together and say you know what we we all need to go to timbuck two we'll say we need to make a trip to timbuck too and we need to straighten out some of stuff cuz this is going to affect us all boy can you imagine what some of the message people say Lord have mercy brother Donnie and brother Daryl and Brother David S or this brother they're going to 10 Buck too and they told me that they're going over there to straighten out a bunch of stuff who in the world they think they are Lord we're going into denomination that's the way they done they did in the Bible you know what I just realized I'm I'm I might I might be in the wrong church tonight I mean I'm preaching to people that look just like you two weeks ago the last time I preached But now y'all are looking at me like you don't know me come on brother oh my goodness so they send these people now with Paul and Barnabas namely Judas her name barabus and Silas Chief men among the Brethren and they wrote Letters by them after this matter the apostles and elders and Brethren send greetings unto the Brethren which are in the Gentiles and Antioch and Syria and cissa for as much as we have heard that certain which went out from us on now they went out from them but they went out without Authority you see this is the way God wanted to control Division and contention I wonder how many them guys when they heard Paul was in town shook like a leaf and the fall winds blowing they said Lord have mercy he's here oh good gracious I didn't realize h why because Paul said you think I've got this attitude they say oh his words are powerful but he's puny as we saying his body he said let him know that these same words I write when I get there I will have the same attitude sir you see that would have kind of helped Squatch down a lot of false Doctrine and a lot of false teachers why is it that all these things are breaking out around the world you know because the greatest most powerful Nation so-called in the world has a weak leader and Satan waits for weakness as Nations wait for weakness now watch for as much as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words so they actually came out from under the apostles and the elders and then they started troubling the people sewing Discord and false Doctrine and whatever more uh with the word subverting your souls subverting subverting your souls and saying that's what it said today oh well you know we really think it's not necessary to no longer quote the prophet well of course we believe the message in secret but you know I I'm kind of thinking that maybe maybe we should start a TV program or something like that not against anybody wants to do all that sort of thing but you know if if we're going to have a TV broadcast and maybe a radio broadcast and we're going to do this and other or maybe we're going to do a lot of Outreach meetings well that's good nothing wrong with that either unless of course you have to compromise What You Preach well since we're going to do that it wouldn't be fitting to you know to mention anything about so I won't say it but you all will understand so from this point on I won't say seventh angel or any preachers that come into our church I'll mention to them and ask them not to read quotes of subverting their souls so you understand what some preachers now begin to do they began to cut off the light they're supposed to filter down into the soul of the horn the body the body is supposed to absorb the light as it comes through the eye and the revelation of the hour it sets their soul on fire by that word but of course if you become ashamed you think it was just a mistake to Paul wrote to Timothy and said don't be ashamed of me as his messenger there must have been something already moving among them what do we have to actually get up and say Paul I mean really he's got a pretty bad record you know this guy was a murderer can you imagine in that day now of course we pick up our Bible today and we read it as a holy word of God but in that day it was simply books or letters written by this man that was so strange and bizarre that he said he was carried up to the third heaven whoever heard of such a thing and he said women couldn't even preach my Lord what in the world's a matter with him and he even wrote In the book of Romans that men were sleeping with men and women sleeping with women and he said those that do it are worthy of damnation and I say the same [Applause] thing I heard some of the guys up in the lodge where we were staying out in the hunting trip talking about a gay Pastor I thought oh my Lord make me sick at my stomach gay Pastor can you imagine can you imagine a man being that blind can you imagine people being so foolish they would set under such when God's word will condemn them oh wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute I must have got a little raise of that light it come down on me and hit me and made me kind of Li you like or something kind of rough let me let me let me cut off that light and say oh how is everybody this is the greatest day of your life oh boy come on now some of you that would feed on that slop that's all it is slop fit for Hogs I want you to notice how that Luke whenever he writes this in chapter 15: 24 it said for as much as we have heard that certain went out from us now you see they were not sent they just went amen it seemed good unto us being assembled with one Accord well that's a miracle within itself ain't it to send chosen men unto you as our beloved Barnabas and Paul men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we have sent therefore Judas not his scar it now Judas and isus who shall also tell you the same things by mouth so now they notice the difference between these men and the others the others went but weren't sent these went but were set the others didn't have a message that coincided with what the apostles was preaching but these were the voices echoing the truth of what the apostles said now they didn't just send Paul and Barnabas but they sent these other brothers who had been around even longer you see friend a lot of the thing that Satan has wanted to do is to try to corrupt us away from this original Apostolic order and it gives him more Liberty to do whatever he wants to do all people have to say is they feel led I challenge any person here any person listen to me tonight around the world I challenge any preacher to show me where the words feel led all right in the book of Acts where any preacher felt led to go do this or do that or the other contrary to God's scripture I'll be waiting but I ain't going to stop preaching till I get it I'm just going to go and preach now notice we have sent ah so you mean the church sent wow hope it's hard for me to say this brother Joel Brown's had a burden on his heart to do something for the community where he was raised up and he come and talk to me about it and want me to pray with him of course he follow the leading of the Lord and God would be with him and wed my advice lesson so it so happens that there's a church not too far from this community where brother Joel was feeling and I told him brother Joel the first thing you need to do of course after praying about it is contact the brother in that area right Joel I said don't you go in there and try to start something different than what he's got said why would you tell him that because I think Bible I think Apostolic that's the way they did you never find them coming in come on children now preach with me you don't find it in the Bible with them going along with men who done something contrary to the doctrine of the Apostles and the prophets so I said go in and let the brother know you're not there trying to undercut him but you've got a burden for your your black Community where you were raised because many of them of course still live in their own community and may not go to some of the white churches yet or whatever more and he just wanted to go see is there somebody there Lord is there somebody there said but brother Joel the thing of it is you don't want to be like brother random brother random went to India and had hard no churches to support him all those people come to God and he said whenever he come back he said probably nearly every one of them went back to the siks the James the Buddhist because there was no church to s send them to so I said go there and talk to that Pastor which brother Joel did so and the brother actually said well you can have our church if you wish to if you want to use it for outreach whatever and I thought praise God that that's that's an awesome way to do it and brother Joel said well maybe not maybe we just you know get a building and I tell them I said where you going to have it I said I hadn't thought about that said well you going to use for PA well I hadn't thought about that well you see whenever you've got men that are experienced and you're going to start a work work it's foolish so foolish not to ask the men of God who's been laboring for decades it shows scriptural ignorance in the minds of so many people as I said I wonder how many Apostolic message churches we have thank you Jesus y'all want me to go on another hunting trip this week is any place say we can go brother Danel notice now in verse in verse 40 and Paul chose Silas and departed because he felt led and he felt led and and uh Silas felt led Paul CH Silas and departed so do you understand what would happen in that day if a man would feel lad to go out and start a church or do whatever and they would go to the local church and say hey he come talk to you are you all working with this is this a work together with you and if they would have said no real Apostolic Believers would had nothing to do with it right come on message people will read your Bible now remember from this night forward every one of you is going to be held accountable and you will stand before the Lord God himself and these scriptures right here that you've seen on this screen will be on Heaven's screen yeah not only you visible but those of you that are streaming and if I'm taken from the earth and people go back and archive it them too cuz this is God's word not mine and he went through Syria and Sicilia confirming the churches chapter 16:4 and as they went through the cities they delivered them the oh no decrees I mean y'all still believe your Bible 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 they delivered them the decrees for to keep that were ordained of who ordained of the Apostles and Elders which were at Jerusalem wow verse five and so oh so here's the way New Testament churches expanded and started and so were the church is established notice and how many faiths Presbyterian Faith Church of Christ Faith Church of God faith one God faith two God faith three God faith there was one Faith well there's truly still is just one true faith can I go a bit farther thank you chapter 20 verse 17 and from myus he sent to Ephesus now this is Paul as he's journeying through he sent to Ephesus and he called the Elders of the church wow so you mean the prophet of the age is going through an area and he would not even pass through that area Harry until he called the Elders of the church and wanted to meet with them chapter 21: 18 and the day following Paul went in with us into James and all the elders were present and when he saluted them he declared particularly what things God had WR among the Gentiles by his ministry 1 Corinthians 4:17 for this cause have I sent unto you osthus you mean Paul sent another preacher okay now some of y'all buckle up okay put your shoulder harness on your seat belt your crash helmet and everything before brother Ron Spencer ever started pastoring I sent him on a mission get your handkerchief out and wave it by that person by You Phantom phanom you don't believe me ask him as a matter of fact we was talking about long ago he said you remember when you sent me to certain certain place I said yes sir I remember that brother Jim bab went with him they had some Great Fellowship until they started talking about the different football teams that they liked and then they nearly had a fallen out it didn't last long now can you imagine brother Ron Spencer being able to be sent somewhere come on now well glory to God it's either getting awful hot in here or I'm feeling the pressure notice and when he saluted them he declared particularly what things God had wrote among him among the Gentiles now he jumps over here First Corinthians speaking about now what he do have i s unto you timotheus who is my beloved Son and faithful in the Lord and shall bring into you remembrance of my ways which be in Christ as I have taught everywhere in every Church wow you mean to tell me that Timothy then whenever he would go in and preach the message and he would actually preach about the messenger and talk about the messenger to the people and say now I want to remind you now brother Paul you remember how he lived now brother Paul you remember you imagine people say now what in the world is he doing referring to some man what in the world is he doing talking about some man oh my good people say I cannot believe you all stand up and quote a man well what's the difference between us quoting the Vindicated prophet and you quoting the smiley preacher from t what's the differ that El standing up here preaching and you quoting the 700 Club or The 500 Club or the 200 Club you're going to quote somebody I'm just GL I'm quoting the right body amen I'm not ashamed of this message know of this [Applause] messeng 2 Corinthians 8:16 but thanks be to God which put the same Earnest care Into the Heart of Titus for you for for indeed he accepted the exhortation being more forward of his own court and he went unto you we have sent with him the brother my goodness so you mean men of God actually felt they could influence others and they would go because these men of God hey why don't some of you Brothers go down to a jail over there why don't you do this what you want to do something for the Lord some young preachers want to preach and where a lot of them want to start out preaching before 500 yeah they want to stand up so why don't you go to the nursing home oh no no no I'm too nervous to go over a nursing home if God's called you you'll start in a hog lot if that's where you have to start if you've got to start down out with one woman Jesus wasn't too big to go to one woman anytime a preacher is too big to go to one woman he's too big for his britches amen if you're a called of God you'll preach in a pig lot you'll preach wherever God sent you because it's burning inside of your soul you ain't preaching for an offering you ain't preaching for a crowd you're preaching because God himself called you to do it now can you imagine if brother Joel Brown moved on his heart whenever they start having Services maybe he's already started having some and the brother from that area would call me and say Hey brother Donnie brother Joel Brown from your church is coming up here and he's doing this this or this you know anything about it and brother Joel didn't think it necessary of course to come to me and I would have to say no sir I don't I don't know one thing about it so I don't know exactly what verse said he might use but more than likely Sunday brother Joel is going to be his text why cuz he don't know brother Joel he want alpam under the headship of his pastor [Music] but now if the brother's concerned and he ain't call me cuz he trusts him you imagine when say oh yeah done talk to Brother D okay that's good that's exactly right oh you say that's a denominational that's the Bible that's God's protocol but again friends people don't believe what the prophet told they do not believe what he said that God called ministers are God's commanding officers they simply don't believe it and do you realize your unbelief will keep you out of the Rapture you think it matters to God which scripture you disbelieve whether it's Malachi 4 or Ephesians 4 I want to believe all of them don't you brother amen boy it seems like I've been preaching for three days is it that long man a lot God help me tomorrow notice we have sent him the brother whose praises and the gospel throughout all the churches not that only but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this Grace what a recommendation so the churches was in such Unison they said brother Paul We believe this young brother he'd be a blessing to you and a help to you and a strength to you so it wasn't just I feel L I feel L I feel L I feel L but the church has recommended this brother and Paul so honored the way the churches felt about it he said I believe I'll take him with us all these scriptures of will be available for you if you'd like to read them yourself this is not a king Donnie version It's the King James that's right I'm sorry y'all didn't know this is in your Bible maybe you'd spend more time reading your Bible instead of on Facebook and Tik Tok and twick twack and everything else in the world and social media spend a little time in Social mediating with God you might know your Bible a little better Philippians 2:25 yet I suppose it necessary to send to you aphroditus and companion and labor and fellow Soldier but your messenger he that ministered to my wants for he longed after you all and was full of heaviness don't you understand what this did this eliminated so much false [Music] prophets they would not let them in their pulpit without [Music] recommendation for he longed after you all and was full of Heaven is because that he had heard that ye had heard he had been sick for indeed he was sick and N to death but God had mercy on him and not on him only but on me also amen won't you look at this prophet of the age he needed men around him that had inferior Ministries and he did not feel threatened he needed men that could come he knew he wasn't going to live forever he knew in order for the message to live there had to be other men of God that would pack that same message oh I heard brother man said today things that ought to be and he's preaching that last message I if you knew it or not but that Assembly of God and he said I know I'm I know I'll go on I oil pass something like that and he said go on and these young men I used to fulfill that scripture not anymore since I'm an old man but these young men will take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord Jesus tape players don't have legs Church come on MP3 players don't have legs Shaman don't have legs a tape player can't baptize you a tape player cannot sit there and cons so you God call men is what God ordained to pack this word he's never changed it and that's what we believe because we are original Apostolic [Applause] Believers praise God can you imagine what this recommendation meant now for a pafitis to the church I send him therefore the more carefully that when you see him again you may Rejoice that I may be the less sorrowful receive him therefore so what about hus fius and some of those others that he wrote their name in the Bible now they too were preachers but they were preachers without a recommendation oh my they were preachers that Paul warned the flock about now no doubt there some dumb sheep that went and hurt him just out of curiosity but if they really believed this man was a servant of God you imagine ever darking in a door where amus was preaching or felius was preaching and Paul said their Doctrine does eat like a canker which is cancer and a corruption that starts in on the body and the skin begins to die word used for a couple different medical terms there and Paul would liken their Doctrine and their preaching to the rottening of the Flesh and the limbs would fall off ain't a saying of God full of the Holy Ghost going to sit and hear amanus preaching nothing why wasn't recommended by the church receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness and hold such and reputation fimon 1 ver10 I beseech you beseech thee for my son onesimus whom I have begotten in my bonds which in time past was to thee unprofitable but now profitable to thee and to me whom I have sent again thou therefore receive him wow so if some other man raises up glory to God I'll tell you one thing I believe the word too hallelujah amen thank you Jesus and Paul didn't recommend him so it show up at Corinth or show up wherever wonder what them people would think and where where's your recommendation oh Lord to God I don't need no recommend Hallelujah I feel that oh [Music] my friend should not believe some of the trash and the nonsense that's going on around our message people with some of their so-called gifts prophesying for this man to leave his wife and marry this man's wife and someone sometime ago a woman standing up and speaking in tongues and interpreting or prophesying or whatever you want to call it I've got a different name for it yeah the Lord I'm calling for a trim I'm calling for a trim so the sisters of the church went home and got their scissors and they started trimming well that's what the Lord said he wanted not my God beels above the devil well come on now well Hallelujah how do we judge prophecy oh I felt it we don't judge it by feeling we judge it by the word and if it don't come to pass it ain't the Lord hallelujah hallelujah oh my notice in Jude chapter one only one chapter of course verse 17 but beloved remember ye The Words which were spoken before of the Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ notice how now Jude is the Foster brother brother of the Lord Jesus notice how Jude is exhorting the people to Remember The Words which were spoken by the Apostle as if though it was the holy word of God wow how many believes the apostles Doctrine is important yes sir brother how many be honest and say well to be honest with you I'm not sure how much of the message churches even go with that anymore I'll raise my hands whether you got enough courage to or not I can guarantee you it's so sad when you look at it oh my brother Donnie we're in the age of the Prophet The Apostles don't even matter no more really well Jesus certainly disagrees with you that's right because he built his City in heaven in a reflection of the earth Revelation 21:14 and the wall of the city had 12 foundations and in them the names of the 12 Apostles of the Lamb yes so you mean when you get there and you're going to live in that City for eternity you're going to see them 12 names of them Apostles now you see the Lord Jesus want he said brother brandom did not go in there and tire at TH Foundation say now wait a minute I made a mistake here I shouldn't have never built the city on the foundation of the Apostles I should have just buil on brother Bram alone and have brother Ram's name there he makes no mistakes so what did Brother Brandon be built upon the doctrine and the teaching of the Apostles and Jesus Christ was so confident that he could build the church on it that he himself allowed himself to be the first stone laid on that foundation and then you and I are given the privilege to be laid by him on that same Foundation that's right let's stand praise the Lord and the church said how many wants our church to be a Bible believing Apostolic Church not UPC not Church of God in Christ not any of these other denominational things but a Bible believing Church oh my hallelujah thank you Father thank you Father you see in reality friends a man a preacher which cannot be led and cannot recognize headship himself is not a leader he is a dictator you look at the difference between Saul and David Saul could not be corrected Saul could not admit he was wrong he couldn't follow directions so therefore he could not be LED under the teachings of the prophet Samuel and look he becomes so stubborn so hard-headed he didn't want to be told what to do oh yeah God said this I've done what God Said but look at David boy he had his mistakes didn't he but he knew how to repent amen and he could do it not because of act but because he genuinely meant it that's right he could be led to repentance he could be led to saying he was wrong he could be led and God even hundreds of years later God was still referring back to David and he said for my servant David's sake for my servant David's sake hundreds of years after he was gone but his legacy meant so much to God oh may God help us we can be that kind of Christians let's bow our heads if you would praise the Lord now maybe you're here tonight and you say actually brother Donnie I didn't realize the Bible said all that well you probably didn't because you're not called to study the word like a preacher would and God knows that so maybe you didn't understand maybe you didn't see it maybe you didn't know it was there but after tonight you say my I want to be that kind of believer I want my heart my life my home our church to be established upon the doctrine the teaching of the Apostles that original word because I truly believe God sent his Prophet to restore our hearts back to the apostolic fathers that's right the apostolic fathers praise God how many wants our church to be that kind of a church would you just raise your hand before God and the angels are watching you the Lord Jesus is watching you and demons are watching so remember we're making our stand we want to be a Bible believing Church oh yeah a message sure oh absolutely with all of our hearts yes we want to believe it teach it walk it obey it praise the Lord heavenly father as we lift our hands to you tonight dear God in your presence I thank you Lord for the Bible I realize Lord Jesus some of our brothers and sisters still in parts of Africa India different parts of the world still don't have a personal Bible I've seen some pictures of some just a few days ago getting their own Bible for the first time we have them laying in our cars laying in our homes we have access to them all of us that have a smartphone have access to them and how much do we read them how I thank you for the Bible and Lord how we thank you tonight for the message of the hour amen that points us right back to the Bible the devil tried to lay a trap for your Prophet one day a man come to the prophet and said now now brother brandham you've had so much experience with God so many visions and so on you would be qualified to write your own Bible now he said the man i' have been trying to catch me a little and I said well brother that might be so but that couldn't be what God would want because he said there would be NE added to this word I remember brother Charlie Cox telling me one time that when brother brandham was there at their house and brother Char had been reading a message book and he had his Bible laying there on a table and he had just laid that message book over on top of the Bible brother brandham saw it went over and picked it up and laid the Bible on top of the message book said brother Charlie don't ever put anything before the word of God Lord God I pray our people will always believe that I pray your people around the world will always have that attitude to love the word to love their scriptures to read them oh Jesus we love you father we don't want to just baptize in your name say we're Apostolic we're one God but we want to be able to take the founding of a new church or the advancing of the kingdom of God brothers that would go out of our assembly I don't believe you call preachers just to set them all under a preacher the rest of their life but they may be sitting there for years to get training so they can be able to go out maybe start other works or missionary or whatever more more but Lord if they follow the apostolic pattern they will not have to sneak around behind the pastor's back like a snake in the grass thank you Lord cuz if they would have done that in the days of Paul they would have got no recommendation help us father What a Sad thing it is many churches will crumble because they aren't built on the revelation of your word I didn't start this church Lord it was started years ago on rone Hill I thank you for those who started it Lord Lord the Yan's family and the Phillips family and many of them dear God their parents and grandparents and we thank you for them they were the Pioneers that started it then move moved it over to Happy Valley and Lord they changed the name of it when it moved from Ron Hill to Happy Valley because they didn't figure that Ron Hill would quite fit the name anymore with them being at Happy Valley sort of the way I looked at it whenever we left Happy Valley I didn't figure it'd be fitting since we're sitting in Buffalo Valley to call it happy valley so I figured it's time for a change Lord God just because we change the name of the church don't mean we change what we stand for as a matter of fact I'm more determined now to disrupt the kingdom of Hell than I've ever been in my life hallelujah hallelujah we're more determined dear God to stand for your gospel stand for your truths cast out Devils heal the sick I'm more determined dear God to pray for the sick people people I'm more determined to pray for folks with cancer than I've ever been in my entire life I am by no means discouraged I am by no means down or weary Satan thought he would get my face but he better thinkink again he thought he would discourage us but he better think again we are not discouraged we are encouraged we are encouraged in the word we're encouraged in Your Great Name in your great power father we're looking for great things to happen among us we've seen great things but we are looking for greater and by greater I don't necessarily mean more emotion I mean a greater manifestation of your person and when I say greater I don't mean dead a lot of folks consider greater with dead I don't think it's going to be dead I don't think we're going to stop worshiping we ain't going to stop praising we ain't going to stop singing we're not going to stop clapping our hands I think we ought to have a shout we ought to have the shout of the king among us now more than ever before because your word is manifesting itself amen Lord God prove yourself Among Us Jesus we've already seen you heal cancer we saw sister Ruth Garden Lord I believe with all of my heart here several months ago she lay there dear God lifeless but after prayer the spirit of God brought our sister back we've seen you do so many things among us already Lord God that only fertilizes our faith to believe you've got wonderful things if we can only stay small and stay humble Lord God help us I pray amen thank you Father how many wants that with all your heart amen friends let me show you the difference difference between some of the arrogance that goes around some of the message preachers I a god taken me to hunt this week and I almost missed the deer that the Lord give me because the guide hadn't called me and I thought well it's too late for me to go brother Daniel called anyway Fally worked it out where I could this guy I get in his truck and he's getting there maybe had even went a mile we've talked about the Lord he's a saved man been a Sunday school teacher youth leader things like that about 64 years old and he said D already told me said my my son's a pastor 32 years old and he said I can tell from talking to you you're a man of God your experience and handling the word what advice would you give to my son I thought as as I sat there m Jo my heart's I I I I was so sad because I thought of the message preachers that could ask their Elders similar things but won't even do it won't even come to Men of God that have labored in the word and already forgotten more than some of them will ever even know and won't even humble thems to come the Servants of God and say help me man of God I've got a burden on my heart to do this to do that do you see anything wrong with it do you see anything wrong in my Ministry look at me servant of God pray with me help me advise me yeah and I thought how sad I'm not sure if he was a Baptist or Methodist whatever but all I know is we talked about the Lord and hugged one another's neck and shed tears I thought how pitiful that a man like this that knows nothing about the message of Malachi 4 and yet but have more humility about him don't even know what I believe and some of the message people that have watched you for years and years yeah what'd you tell him brother Donnie I said my advice to him would be this stay humble stay little don't never become big in his own eyes and become arrogant and proud and I said if he will stay that way God will be able to use him he said 'w he's always been humbled and got a real good spirit I said that's great but I said tell him that I said to keep it because Solomon the man of God that built the Great temple of God when he got older he also built this Temple and that Temple and another Temple and another Temple for idol worship the very same man that built the house of God because he got arrogant and proud God God's blessed us and give us a nice place to worship don't we thank him for it than Lord but let's not get arrogant let's not get proud and say boy our church is Big our church is our church let's stay small and little and see what he'll do let's not ask people come and see our church let's tell them come and see our Jesus yeah amen amen come and see our Jesus don't come and see our pastor come and see our youth choir Bo I tell you why sister Emma is doing such a great job with our young people and our boy you ought to see our youth group my goodness brother Rob and brother Joe and this brother oh just just come and see our youth group let's tell them to come and see our Jesus are youth leaders can't change your heart I can't change their hearts only Jesus can change our hearts amen hallelujah sing something for us s praise the Lord you imagine what brother Brandon would be able to say tonight if he'd walk in this church and say my those of you that have been to brandham Tabernacle you know how small that it is how humble how little brother brandham wanted to build a bigger church but the people didn't want to and one of the brothers that was on the board said that after the people voted not to do it brother brandham told them that's what they think of my Ministry but because the church voted to do so he stayed right there but I've often wondered what it would have been if they would have been of the right mind you see a Visionary is always one of the most misunderstood preachers that there is in the ministry because most everybody just wants to keep his scrunch down don't grow don't do this don't do that oh no oh no it's our for and no more but the Visionary that says what about tomorrow if there is another 10 years or 5 years what will we do what are we going to do with our young people what are we going to give to them oh my we don't want to just give them a nice building we don't want to give you a place to play basketball we want to give you a place where you can be born again but I also want to give you a place where you can come together with your own and we can invite the youth from North Carolina South Carolina Georgia it's absolutely amazing the youth services that we've had I'm hearing from pastors I'm hearing from youth churches or youth leaders rather some of these other churches when I was here when brother Matt was here how many of the youth from South Carolina North Carolina Georgia sit outside and say thank you brother Donnie for letting us come praise God so you see this ain't just for us this ain't just for us hallelujah and it won't be if we'll stay little and stay small how many wants to be that way oh Jesus we love you Lord Jesus Use Me Jesus use me let's sing it together before we go I'm sorry I have you a little bit long tonight we say Brother Don but I'm not a preacher and I I've never even spoken tongues I don't get up on the floor and dance and I understand my little daughter that just stepped be on the curtain of time I never recall ever hearing her speaking tongues I seen her one time on a video where she was jumping can't recall that I ever saw her shout her higher down I can't recall that I ever saw her cast out a devil or do things that people think is great but I have never seen a lay member whose life touched so many people from around the world I just keep hearing about and I say Lord have mercy Lord have mercy you see the Lord told me months and months ago that we was going to see his glory and he told me that it would be marvelous in our eyes but I totally misunderstood what he meant I just knew beyond a shadow of a doubt and our dedication Services when all the saints of God was praying and Saints from around the world were praying I just knew I just knew beyond a sh of doubt she's going to jump out of that wheelchair and run over this whole place and we was going to tear this church down and have to build another one we all shouted it down but that wasn't what he me at all so you see sisters even you can be great just live your life for what the Lord wants you to be your brothers that'll never preach you never know who you're affected but brother Donnie everybody may not know me the way they do sister cuz she was your daughter I know that but what if you influence one soul and they come to the Lord Jesus Christ and the prophet said that name that individual will be identified with you for eternity forever each of of you have a
