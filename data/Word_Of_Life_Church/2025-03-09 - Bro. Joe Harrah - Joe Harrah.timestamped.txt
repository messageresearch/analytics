[25:23] might just have to hear me amen I didn't
[25:27] get a response out of that but I don't
[25:28] guess they want to hear me when
[25:31] you you was talking about the world
[25:33] famous I knew who he was talking about
[25:35] and that was the queen that was her the
[25:38] final voice of the final age is that of
[25:39] the wife the bride and so that's what I
[25:41] prefer is to hear her sing other than me
[25:44] so just getting old and worn out I guess
[25:48] and I think about that so many times the
[25:49] prophet he was in his early 50s talking
[25:51] about being old 52 53 being at 54 I feel
[25:55] like he does now so um

[26:05] forgot see I already forgot what I was
[26:08] going to sing
[26:10] amen if you get tired of this oh well it
[26:15] speaks a very very true reality that
[26:19] this word that we're hearing is not just
[26:21] words that we're hearing it's words that
[26:24] we're hearing in order that we can
[26:26] become that very thing that we're
[26:27] hearing and if you're here today and you
[26:30] think I just can't do this just open
[26:33] yourself up and be like it was with Mary
[26:35] and she said be it unto me and she kept
[26:38] those words she didn't say anything to
[26:40] anybody but there was a life taking
[26:43] place with in her and the evidence
[26:46] brought forth one day it come forth one
[26:49] day and they begin to talk about it yeah

[28:17] going to

[40:10] Jesus name amen amen if you have your
[40:13] Bibles um we'll turn to Book of Job real
[40:17] quick and we read Job 1 start at chap at
[40:22] verse eight then we'll turn to Acts 19
[40:29] hopefully this should go really quick I
[40:32] should have you out
[40:34] by the buffet at Golden
[40:38] Corral you can get you some of the go
[40:41] the chocolate
[40:42] fountain before they run out at
[40:44] 12:30 so let's
[40:47] read Job 1 and8 and the Lord said unto
[40:51] Satan hast thou considered my servant
[40:53] servant
[40:54] job that there is none like him in their
[40:57] earth a perfect and an upright man one
[41:00] that fearth
[41:01] God andth evil then Satan answered the
[41:05] Lord and said do job fear God for not
[41:08] hast thou Hast not Thou made a hedge
[41:10] about him and about his house and about
[41:12] all that he hath done on every side that
[41:15] thou H has blessed the work of his hands
[41:17] his substance is increased in the land
[41:19] this is Satan testifying what God had
[41:22] done for
[41:23] job but put forth thy hand now and touch
[41:26] all the he hath and he will curse thee
[41:29] to thy
[41:30] face and the Lord said unto Satan behold
[41:33] all that he hath is in thy power only
[41:36] unto upon him put not uh that forth
[41:40] thine hand so Satan went forth from the
[41:42] presence of the
[41:44] Lord Acts 19 we're going to start at
[41:46] verse 13 a very familiar
[41:51] scripture then certain of the Vagabond
[41:53] Jews exorcists took upon
[41:55] them to call over them which had evil
[41:58] spirits the name of the Lord Jesus
[41:59] saying we adure You by Jesus whom Paul
[42:01] preacheth there were seven sons of ska a
[42:04] Jew chief of the priest which did so
[42:06] when the evil spirit said in said Jesus
[42:09] I know Paul I know but who are you and
[42:12] the man in whom the evil spirit was
[42:14] leaped on them and overcame them and
[42:16] prevailed against them so they fled out
[42:18] of that house naked and wounded you
[42:21] could be seated may the Lord add
[42:23] blessings to his word
[42:27] the title I give this this morning thank
[42:29] you
[42:31] might alarm you or baffle you a minute
[42:35] hopefully we can get past that but title
[42:39] I gave you this morning is a proper
[42:40] introduction to
[42:45] Hell job had a proper introduction to
[42:48] Hell these men
[42:51] didn't and I believe every son and
[42:53] daughter of God will have a proper
[42:56] introduction to hell it's it's all about
[42:59] knowing who you
[43:01] are and knowing who you have in you and
[43:04] brother brandom said the God who is rich
[43:06] in
[43:07] Mercy now we are a part of God you
[43:09] always was you don't remember it because
[43:11] you were only an attribute in God you
[43:13] were only in his thinking your very name
[43:16] if it if it ever was on the book of life
[43:18] it was put there before the foundation
[43:20] of the
[43:22] world I said I'm not saying these this
[43:25] to mix up Doctrine but but to straighten
[43:27] it out that we might get away from this
[43:29] fear and this scare that you don't know
[43:31] who you
[43:32] are you're not going to
[43:35] be but now you are sons of God you were
[43:39] always the sons of God before God Can
[43:42] Make It introduce you to
[43:45] hell you have to know him
[43:48] first and that was the deal with with
[43:50] with job and we'll get into job here a
[43:52] little bit you know there's there these
[43:54] sons of ska they they was trying to cast
[43:56] out a demon in the name of the Lord
[43:58] Jesus and they didn't even know who he
[44:00] was they didn't have the proper
[44:02] introduction to Christ that they should
[44:04] have had you know we you say well we see
[44:08] people that you know there's there's
[44:09] people that we hear that you know some
[44:11] got called some got some sent some just
[44:14] took up their Bibles and went we and
[44:16] you've got people that that are trying
[44:18] to handle this word that never had a
[44:19] proper introduction right to God you
[44:22] have to have a proper introduction to
[44:24] God before you have a proper
[44:25] introduction to hell amen Satan needs to
[44:28] know who you
[44:30] are and and he didn't know these guys
[44:34] you're talking to me about Jesus Christ
[44:35] and you I I don't know who you are I
[44:37] know who he is I spent 40 days with him
[44:40] yeah I spent 40 days in in the
[44:42] wilderness tempting this guy and
[44:44] couldn't do anything and then you're
[44:45] telling me you're casting out in his
[44:47] name I know the power he has and you
[44:49] don't have
[44:51] it if you have it you'll have the fruits
[44:54] oh yeah you know that that's the the
[44:56] thing that you know we we want to do we
[44:57] want to you know we get people that just
[44:59] want to throw all these these quotes in
[45:02] your face they want to battle you with
[45:03] quotes or or debate you with scripture
[45:05] and all that and they don't even know
[45:06] what they're talking about you got
[45:08] people that put put religious posts and
[45:11] and all these things on on their social
[45:12] media all the time and they don't live
[45:14] it it's CU they've never had a proper
[45:17] introduction and and you know I know it
[45:19] sounds strange I don't want to be
[45:20] introduced the devil I
[45:22] do I do I want him to know who I am and
[45:26] it's not me it's not me it it it's when
[45:30] brother Brandon I was listening to my
[45:31] wife was listening this morning to the
[45:32] Deep call the brother brand was talking
[45:34] about the Deep call to the Deep there
[45:35] has to be a deep to respond so it's not
[45:38] you that the devil knows it's not you
[45:41] that's being introduced he's being
[45:43] reintroduced to the god of
[45:45] Heaven every every time this this old
[45:48] man dies we we talk about the old old
[45:51] man ding we kill the old man and we we
[45:53] go down in the water we grave we come up
[45:55] a new man
[45:57] Satan's getting a reintroduction to God
[45:59] when you get filled with the Holy Ghost
[46:01] this is a
[46:03] reintroduction here he is again over
[46:05] here God here's God every every time
[46:07] that Satan pokes his head up he's seeing
[46:09] God in a new person he's seeing a new
[46:11] man everywhere he
[46:14] looks and those times are getting fewer
[46:16] and fewer it's going to be long before
[46:18] the last when the last person is finally
[46:20] introduced to hell we're getting out of
[46:22] here every morning that you get
[46:25] up it's to be a fresh introduction to
[46:28] the devil here I come
[46:30] again I'm here again I'm not going to
[46:33] let you beat me down with with with
[46:35] every everything that hell can offer and
[46:37] that's that's what he tried to do to job
[46:39] you know job's problem there for a
[46:41] little bit we'll get into it here in a
[46:43] little bit more but the deal with job
[46:44] was job didn't fully understand what was
[46:47] happening and sometimes we don't fully
[46:49] understand we don't understand we try to
[46:51] look at through Through The Eyes of
[46:53] Flesh so many times we try to look at
[46:55] what's happening in our life and we
[46:57] don't understand that God is just doing
[46:59] what he did to
[47:00] job have you considered so and so have
[47:02] you considered so and so you know we
[47:06] when we look at it the eyes of the flesh
[47:08] we we have to take in the scripture that
[47:10] the Bible says he's a worthy adversary
[47:12] yeah and he is worthy adversary you and
[47:15] your flesh can do nothing with him
[47:17] right but but whenever you get the Holy
[47:20] Ghost and you let the holy ghost in your
[47:22] life start living through you the
[47:24] scripture that tells us when one day
[47:26] we'll look at him and say is this the
[47:28] guy is this the guy that I was
[47:30] introduced to that that that ws so much
[47:33] havoc in my life caused me so much chaos
[47:36] and and and I thought all my my world
[47:38] had fallen
[47:40] apart and this is what God had introduce
[47:43] me
[47:44] to and I let that little bitty
[47:47] imp take over my life come
[47:50] on right sir a proper
[47:54] introduction helps you to realize who
[47:57] you are in Christ
[47:59] first then you could say bring on Hell
[48:02] Bring It On
[48:04] yeah there shouldn't be a a son and
[48:07] daughter of God filled with the Holy
[48:08] Ghost in here today that hell don't know
[48:10] all about you on they they tremble hell
[48:13] trembles when you get up in the morning
[48:15] they have to fight you for another day
[48:17] they have to fight another losing battle
[48:20] with you every day do you realize when
[48:23] when you approach every day filled with
[48:26] the Holy
[48:28] Ghost hell's losing you're scoring more
[48:31] points than
[48:34] hell hell's losing yeah and then we give
[48:38] in to these these little things in our
[48:40] life we give in wow we give into
[48:43] bitterness we give into to gossip we
[48:45] give into not reading our Bible not
[48:47] praying hell starts scoring more points
[48:50] and then that scripture comes back into
[48:52] view he's a worthy
[48:54] adversary I don't ever ever fulfill that
[48:57] scripture in my life he's a worthy
[49:01] adversary because if it's not me
[49:03] fighting the battle
[49:05] right when God introduces you to Satan
[49:08] he's saying Satan look at
[49:10] me look at
[49:13] me not look at so and so here so and so
[49:16] there God said look this is me righten
[49:19] this is me he by Grace brother B say is
[49:23] by his grace he became you that you
[49:26] could become
[49:28] him you know there's absolutely zero
[49:31] anything you have to do in your life to
[49:33] overcome the devil zero
[49:37] nothing it's it's like it's like that
[49:41] you decided that you're your basketball
[49:43] team got into the to the the
[49:46] championship you're in the NC you're in
[49:48] the high school
[49:50] championship and the coach said you're
[49:52] going to sit today we got Michael Jordan
[49:55] today yeah
[49:57] I don't know how it get any better than
[50:00] that we got Michael Jordan
[50:03] today we you go you ain't go hey the
[50:06] game is over they're probably going to
[50:07] [Music]
[50:09] Forfeit That's what Satan feels like
[50:11] doing every morning when you wake up
[50:14] never mind God never mind I I can't
[50:17] fight it today come on that's the way he
[50:19] ought to view every one of our Lives
[50:21] when we get up in the
[50:23] morning Satan I'm here to reintroduce
[50:25] myself to you
[50:28] I'm going to introduce myself to
[50:31] you but before you could even do that
[50:35] right you know brother Brandon we
[50:37] brother brandom always said when this
[50:38] bride recognizes who she is we'll get
[50:40] out of
[50:41] here the reason why we can't in
[50:44] introduce ourselves to to hell every
[50:46] morning we get up or in the middle of
[50:48] the day or at the end of the night is
[50:49] because we
[50:51] forget it doesn't make you any less
[50:54] bride it doesn't make you any less child
[50:57] of God but Humanity kicks in so many
[51:00] times then we forget who we are yes sir
[51:03] we forget what God made us we forget the
[51:06] value that he's placed in our
[51:10] life that's why we don't feel like
[51:13] reintroducing oursel to the
[51:15] devil cuz we don't see no value in
[51:19] oursel we don't see what God sees in
[51:24] US you have so much
[51:30] value that when
[51:32] God had that picture of you in his mind
[51:35] before the foundation of the world that
[51:37] one picture of you held so much value
[51:40] with
[51:42] God he said I'll never
[51:44] rest till that that
[51:47] thought of you becomes a reality to me
[51:52] amen yes that's the value look look look
[51:56] over everything that's happened when God
[51:58] said let there be light it was because
[52:00] he had an urge inside of him to get to
[52:03] you he had something built up inside of
[52:06] you when when that thought of you came
[52:08] to his mind brother Brenham said he's
[52:10] never lost that picture of
[52:12] you you look at yourself you get up in
[52:15] the morning you look at yourself and you
[52:17] begin to think Lord I don't see how you
[52:19] see anything in me come on come on I
[52:23] don't see I don't see how I can go and
[52:25] and face the day face the devil will
[52:26] face hell for with everything that's in
[52:29] my life I don't I don't
[52:32] see it's it's because you don't
[52:34] understand who you are yet you you don't
[52:37] know who you are yet and and God when
[52:39] God had that vision of you when he had
[52:42] that picture of
[52:44] you God said I'll die to get
[52:49] it I'll die to get it and I've said it
[52:51] here before we read the scripture and
[52:53] the Bible says no greater love has any
[52:56] man that that would lay down his life
[52:58] for his brother we've seen that over the
[53:01] years many you know the the those that
[53:03] went and served and and went over and
[53:05] died so you could have freedom in this
[53:07] country we we've heard of guys stepping
[53:09] and people stepping in front of bullets
[53:11] for other people and you know how what
[53:13] kind of love is that that's you you
[53:15] can't surpass
[53:17] that but man cannot understand the love
[53:20] that God had for
[53:22] you tell me one father in here
[53:28] that would kill your only son any child
[53:31] of yours for somebody
[53:34] else one father I
[53:37] wouldn't there's there's nobody in here
[53:39] would say I would I would take the life
[53:40] of my child so you could be
[53:43] free we wouldn't do that that that
[53:45] doesn't live inside of man to do that
[53:48] and God went God's love went so far
[53:51] above man's
[53:53] love and that's the value he puts in you
[53:56] this is you know we we look at job you
[53:58] know why we always said why did job you
[54:01] know job didn't understand what God was
[54:03] doing job had no idea why you know I've
[54:06] I've sacrificed everything that's that's
[54:09] what we look at so much in our life we
[54:10] think why is God putting this on me I've
[54:12] been living right I've been reading my
[54:13] Bible been praying I've been paying my
[54:15] tithes I've been giving offerings I'm
[54:18] supporting the the ministry I pray for
[54:20] my Pastor I pray for the sick why is God
[54:22] doing this to
[54:24] me why why is he doing this to my
[54:29] life why do I have
[54:33] cancer why is my my children falling
[54:38] [Music]
[54:39] away why is my husband backslid why is
[54:42] my wife
[54:45] backslid God why are you doing this to
[54:47] me I'm trying to live
[54:49] right that's the attitude that job took
[54:53] towards
[54:54] God I don't understand
[54:57] yeah and the prophet went on to say the
[55:00] go job be to accuse God wrongly yeah
[55:06] we've all done it yes we have we've all
[55:09] done it job is is is is sitting there he
[55:13] the grass
[55:14] dies the spring it comes
[55:18] back yeah we we we look the flowers die
[55:21] in the spring they come back and the the
[55:23] leaves of the trees fall off in the
[55:25] spring they come come back that's why I
[55:27] really believe God gave brother lenel
[55:29] that inspiration with that song there'll
[55:32] be another spring because job didn't
[55:34] have that Revelation brother lenel job
[55:37] didn't have
[55:38] it because job said when I
[55:41] die I can't come
[55:44] back I can't come
[55:48] back but he didn't realize he had an
[55:51] introduction
[55:53] coming God wasn't trying joob
[55:57] God wasn't trying to see what job would
[56:00] do God had already told
[56:03] Satan there's none like him there's none
[56:06] like
[56:10] him if your kid was Michael Jordan would
[56:12] you show him to
[56:14] everybody
[56:16] wow if your kid was Tom Brady would you
[56:18] show him to
[56:20] everybody that's all God was doing right
[56:24] that's all God was doing
[56:27] this is my
[56:29] trophy this is the greatest thing I have
[56:33] Satan let me introduce you to
[56:37] it let me show
[56:40] you what I
[56:43] got so when you're going through your
[56:45] battles your struggles with your
[56:47] besetting sins things in your life and
[56:50] you Lord I fought this thing for years
[56:53] lord I can't get over it I I can't get
[56:56] over
[56:57] this come
[56:59] on and there's times in your life that
[57:01] we we we look at the things in our life
[57:04] and you're there's no way you'd want to
[57:07] fight a b you think oh I'm so
[57:08] spiritually weak right now there's no
[57:11] way I could fight a battle if God gave
[57:13] it to me and yet you get one anyway it's
[57:15] because you don't see in yourself what
[57:17] God sees that's right you don't see in
[57:20] yourself you don't see the value you
[57:22] have in yourself that God sees
[57:27] the future home I've jumped around I
[57:28] apologize this was happened this morning
[57:32] so brother brandham said if you are the
[57:34] bride the bride is part of the husband
[57:37] the only place you'll ever recognize it
[57:40] is recognize what part of that husband
[57:42] you are you can't recognize being
[57:45] bride you have to recognize your
[57:49] position it's like a
[57:51] wife when a man and woman they they come
[57:54] up here and they get married and they
[57:55] they do their V
[57:57] and they walk out he takes on her name
[57:59] or she Tak sorry hope I ain't

[58:11] know you never
[58:13] know but she takes on his name right and
[58:18] they turn around and they are
[58:21] introduced this is a new introduction
[58:23] for her right
[58:26] they are introduced as Mrs so and so
[58:29] with his last name with his first name

[1:00:59] well you talk about Jupiter and Mars and

[1:01:24] said now then beyond that there's just
[1:01:27] as many Moons and
[1:01:33] stars that's the power the power that it
[1:01:36] took for God to create that lives in
[1:01:40] you that same power do we realize
[1:01:45] it do we understand our human Minds
[1:01:47] can't really comprehend that CU we know
[1:01:49] we're not going to go out and speak
[1:01:51] these things and create create galaxies
[1:01:54] and create universes and we're going to
[1:01:56] go step out in onto one of these planets
[1:01:58] and go create on we want to sometimes
[1:02:01] this world gets so bad you Lord break
[1:02:03] that law apart please let me create one
[1:02:05] little planet for my for no more oh good
[1:02:09] because you live in a world we live in a
[1:02:11] world that's just so
[1:02:14] toxic but you know God chose
[1:02:17] you right chose you to be in this part
[1:02:20] of this world at this time that's right
[1:02:23] it doesn't matter how toxic it gets how
[1:02:26] bad the politics gets how bad the
[1:02:28] inflation prices and all that gets God
[1:02:31] chose you this in leosa from the
[1:02:33] foundation of the world he knew you
[1:02:35] would be here he knew you could overcome
[1:02:38] in this
[1:02:39] time and that's the value that he placed
[1:02:42] in
[1:02:44] you because it's not you
[1:02:47] anyway that is one of the things we
[1:02:49] forget more than anything it's not us
[1:02:52] anyway you know when when I was when I
[1:02:55] was back back here while ago brother
[1:02:56] Mike walls come back there and I was
[1:02:58] like I don't what I don't know how this
[1:03:00] is gonna turn out and he said well it
[1:03:01] ain't you
[1:03:03] anyway it ain't you
[1:03:06] anyway and I needed
[1:03:08] that I needed that because I was told at
[1:03:12] 9:00 this
[1:03:15] morning so it's not
[1:03:18] me it's it's not me you you can look all
[1:03:21] you want and and I you
[1:03:24] know I never mind I'm going to skip
[1:03:28] that but I didn't I didn't ask for this
[1:03:31] I I didn't ask for a calling in my
[1:03:33] life I told Brother Terry Horn one time
[1:03:35] I said brother Terry if God if God was
[1:03:38] to come come to me and say Joe my son
[1:03:42] that was your last sermon you don't have
[1:03:44] to preach anymore I would be the
[1:03:46] happiest man on the face of the Earth
[1:03:50] happy brother Terry brother Terry said
[1:03:52] Joe brother Joe that would just be too
[1:03:54] easy
[1:03:56] it'd be too easy there's no battles in
[1:03:58] that brother Jackie there's no battles
[1:04:00] in
[1:04:02] that we don't choose pick and choose
[1:04:05] what God wants us to do that's
[1:04:08] true back to job and brother brandham
[1:04:11] said then Jesus came and called there
[1:04:13] was a man one time named job one of the
[1:04:14] oldest prophets in the bible he was a
[1:04:16] great man he loved the Lord he done all
[1:04:19] he knowed to do and Satan desired to
[1:04:20] sift
[1:04:21] him he said to God one day God said to
[1:04:24] him rather where where Where Have You
[1:04:26] Been Satan you know the thing that
[1:04:28] really astounds me about that is God was
[1:04:32] was wanting
[1:04:34] Satan to come to him to give job to
[1:04:37] him where you been I got something for
[1:04:40] you job didn't come to God I mean Satan
[1:04:43] didn't come to God and said hey you've
[1:04:45] got to give me job wow think about that
[1:04:49] God said hey where you been I've been
[1:04:52] waiting on
[1:04:54] you I've been waiting on you I've got
[1:04:58] somebody that's you know you know what
[1:05:01] what Satan said I've seen your trophy

[1:05:08] big wall built a brick wall built around
[1:05:10] him because he's your favorite I haven't
[1:05:13] even thought about taking
[1:05:15] him you see that's when God allows Satan
[1:05:19] in your life the most when you think
[1:05:21] that you're just up here walking on
[1:05:22] cloud
[1:05:23] n you're reading every morning reading
[1:05:26] your Bible you're listening to tapes

[1:06:10] everywhere everywhere why you are what
[1:06:13] he
[1:06:14] wants you are what he wants he wants
[1:06:17] God's prized possession and that is you
[1:06:22] amen when you got filled with the Holy
[1:06:24] Ghost
[1:06:26] God made a proper
[1:06:27] introduction you think you know I was
[1:06:30] reading this this morning you know Adam
[1:06:32] didn't have the proper introduction that
[1:06:34] job had no wow and God allowed it
[1:06:39] because if if if Adam had the proper
[1:06:41] introduction and how we've been hearing
[1:06:42] on on Wednesday nights if if how it was
[1:06:45] supposed to come forth by Spoken Word
[1:06:46] we' have never been reading about job
[1:06:48] right we would have never read about
[1:06:51] job and we would have never read about
[1:06:53] all these attributes
[1:06:56] God allowed Adam to to not have the
[1:06:59] proper introduction with Satan but he
[1:07:01] was in God's image Adam was in God's
[1:07:03] image right yeah but God let him make
[1:07:06] his own choice because God knew I've got
[1:07:10] other
[1:07:11] attributes that I want to put in people
[1:07:14] in
[1:07:15] 2025 I have attributes in me that if
[1:07:18] Adam don't
[1:07:20] fall if Adam doesn't fall I've got
[1:07:22] attributes that no one will ever know
[1:07:24] about yeah no one will ever know these
[1:07:28] attributes that I
[1:07:30] have Adam wasn't
[1:07:33] deceived but we he chose he chose to go
[1:07:37] with his wife his wife was deceived she
[1:07:38] never had a proper
[1:07:41] introduction she met Satan not on the
[1:07:43] grounds that God
[1:07:45] allowed God God allowed it to happen but
[1:07:48] that wasn't the way God had purposed
[1:07:52] everything to be spoken word spoken word
[1:07:55] spoken word spoken
[1:07:57] word but God said I've got so much in
[1:08:01] me that I want to give in you that God's
[1:08:05] got attributes that he put in you that
[1:08:07] he didn't put in the early church
[1:08:10] because you're fighting new battles
[1:08:12] you're fighting things that they they
[1:08:13] didn't have you know they they had to
[1:08:15] meet Satan on the grounds that God gave
[1:08:17] them the next Church age they had to
[1:08:19] meet Satan on the grounds that God gave
[1:08:20] him there and every age has to meet
[1:08:24] Satan on the grounds that God gives him
[1:08:27] and God gives every age a proper
[1:08:30] introduction to
[1:08:35] hell he says have you considered my
[1:08:37] servant job there was none like him in
[1:08:40] the
[1:08:41] earth he is a perfect
[1:08:45] man says sure you give him everything do
[1:08:47] everything for him certainly he's a
[1:08:49] great man but let me have him one time
[1:08:52] I'll change the
[1:08:54] tune I'll make him curse you to your
[1:08:56] face you can't do it that's his
[1:08:59] confidence in a Believer he has that
[1:09:01] much confidence in you it doesn't matter
[1:09:03] and God knows that if you've got the
[1:09:05] Holy Ghost his life in you right Jesus
[1:09:09] told him said I'll never leave you
[1:09:10] comfortless I go away but I'll come back
[1:09:14] and I'll be with you even in you to the
[1:09:16] end of the world was that to
[1:09:19] everybody was that was that was like we
[1:09:22] said last time you know God God's last
[1:09:24] move wasn't the CR cross it was for for
[1:09:27] many it was for
[1:09:29] Millions the cross many stopped at the
[1:09:32] cross some of them will never have the
[1:09:34] proper introduction to hell that you
[1:09:37] got cuz God said I got so much to show
[1:09:39] you past the
[1:09:40] cross I've got so much on the other side
[1:09:43] of the cross for this
[1:09:48] bride I'm going to move rather quickly
[1:09:50] here
[1:09:51] so you know that God never God never
[1:09:54] asked job job
[1:09:57] listen Satan's going to be up here in a
[1:09:59] little
[1:10:00] bit and um I need y'all to
[1:10:04] meet I need but don't worry I've got
[1:10:07] faith in you I've equipped you for
[1:10:09] everything that you need you know I'm
[1:10:12] going to let him do some
[1:10:15] stuff you know brother Steve Nome didn't
[1:10:19] God didn't say brother Steve I'm going
[1:10:20] to give you cancer but don't
[1:10:23] worry he already knew what was in inside
[1:10:25] brother Steve yeah amen God don't have
[1:10:28] to warn you that that you're going to
[1:10:30] get tested tomorrow he don't have to
[1:10:32] warn you that you're going to get cancer
[1:10:34] next week come on he don't have to warn
[1:10:36] you that because he already knows what's
[1:10:38] in you am he introductions have already
[1:10:41] been
[1:10:42] made you you've already met hell you and
[1:10:45] you've you've seen the how you've
[1:10:47] overcome you've seen your brothers and
[1:10:48] sisters overcome hell day after day day
[1:10:51] after day you know there's no big
[1:10:54] battles and small small battles when it
[1:10:56] comes to God there's there's a headache
[1:10:59] here and the God has to struggle a
[1:11:01] little bit over here if somebody's got
[1:11:04] leprosy God doesn't look at it that way
[1:11:08] God God looks at it and says healing is
[1:11:10] the children's
[1:11:11] bread Take and
[1:11:13] Eat I've given to you for
[1:11:16] that it it it's there's
[1:11:19] no big things and little things in God's
[1:11:22] eyes cuz God can do everything God can
[1:11:24] do anything and and sometimes we
[1:11:26] categorize the problems in our life by
[1:11:29] their
[1:11:31] severity right that's human nature run
[1:11:33] to the doctor you should brother benam
[1:11:37] said God uses doctors yes to use that
[1:11:40] that think that he don't I've got a
[1:11:43] quote for you brother brandom said to
[1:11:46] pray for your nurses and doctors because
[1:11:48] if you don't one day God's going to ask
[1:11:50] you why you
[1:11:53] didn't wow
[1:11:56] so this is just things that God's put in
[1:11:58] our life to when you get that proper
[1:12:00] introduction you don't have to be scared
[1:12:03] you don't have to
[1:12:06] worry God will never put anything in
[1:12:09] your life that he won't equip you with
[1:12:11] faith first that's true God will equip
[1:12:15] you with faith before you go through
[1:12:17] anything because God will not send you
[1:12:20] into a battle
[1:12:23] defenseless it's not your battle anyway
[1:12:25] right right you I preached that some
[1:12:28] years ago the battle is not
[1:12:30] yours you know in in when the prophet
[1:12:33] came to to Jehoshaphat say you stand
[1:12:35] right here you stay right here
[1:12:37] everything you see before you be gone
[1:12:41] tomorrow you've already met the enemy
[1:12:44] before you've already had proper
[1:12:45] introductions you know what they're
[1:12:47] capable of Yeah by faith you stand here
[1:12:51] and you let God take care of
[1:12:53] it yes
[1:12:58] so God didn't allow job to be part of
[1:13:00] that
[1:13:02] conversation but job had
[1:13:04] value you have value I have value
[1:13:07] everybody has value in God's eyes and
[1:13:09] and sometimes that is diminished by our
[1:13:10] problem the value we have in our life
[1:13:13] when we look at our life is diminished
[1:13:15] by our circumstances it's diminished by
[1:13:17] our symptoms in our life yeah we don't
[1:13:20] understand our un when we don't
[1:13:23] understand something it clouds
[1:13:26] Faith many times it clouds faith and and
[1:13:29] all we could see circumstances and
[1:13:32] symptoms pain suffering grief it blurs
[1:13:37] Faith so many
[1:13:38] times but look at the value you have
[1:13:41] this is why God wants to introduce you
[1:13:44] to hell so why would he introduce you to
[1:13:47] the devil in Matthew 10:27 says what I
[1:13:50] tell you in darkness speak you in light
[1:13:52] what you hear in the ear that preach
[1:13:56] upon the housetops fear not them which
[1:13:59] kill the body but are not able to kill
[1:14:01] the soul for fear him which is able to
[1:14:04] destroy both soul and the body in hell
[1:14:08] yeah if you haven't had the proper
[1:14:09] introduction you f feel that scripture
[1:14:12] right are not Two Sparrows sold for a
[1:14:15] farthing and one of them shall not fall
[1:14:17] on the ground without your father but
[1:14:19] the very hairs of your head are all
[1:14:20] numbered fear you not therefore you are
[1:14:23] of more value than many SP
[1:14:27] and Luke Luke brings it back up and Luke
[1:14:29] says are not five sparrows sold for two
[1:14:32] farlings and not one of them is
[1:14:34] forgotten before God but even the very
[1:14:36] hairs of your head are numbered fear not
[1:14:38] therefore you are more value than many
[1:14:41] sparrows you have value with God yes
[1:14:46] from the very beginning Adam had
[1:14:50] value God has placed value on everything
[1:14:54] he has
[1:14:56] made the Bible tells us when he said let
[1:14:58] there be
[1:14:59] light God said it was
[1:15:02] good everything he made it was good but
[1:15:04] when he came to man he made man he said
[1:15:06] he's very good it's very
[1:15:10] good God placed value in everything that
[1:15:12] he made but the highest value he placed
[1:15:14] is when he created you everything I made
[1:15:17] was good but this is very
[1:15:20] good why because he knew I've got to
[1:15:23] live in that yeah I'm going to move in
[1:15:27] there I'm going to take
[1:15:30] over this creation that I see that's
[1:15:32] very good God like we've been here in
[1:15:33] the the in the Garden of Eden God could
[1:15:35] have said you know what this Garden that
[1:15:37] I've made I could just live here this is
[1:15:40] great this is good this is this is good
[1:15:44] but then when he created
[1:15:46] man that's where he wanted to live
[1:15:49] that's where he placed value
[1:15:55] you know
[1:15:56] sometimes I wonder if
[1:16:01] we we
[1:16:03] understand if God would allow us one
[1:16:05] time to see the value that he has in us
[1:16:08] you know I studying this I thought of
[1:16:10] Queen Esther you know when Queen Esther
[1:16:13] you look at her people her people were
[1:16:15] were the Jews and they were the most
[1:16:17] hated in the
[1:16:19] land and somehow she ended up in the
[1:16:23] king's court
[1:16:25] King uh hazus was going to to pick a
[1:16:28] wife and it just so happened she was the
[1:16:31] chosen
[1:16:34] one she never really realized when she
[1:16:37] had to come before the king for a
[1:16:40] petition she hadn't had full
[1:16:42] introductions with him
[1:16:45] yet and she would she had a need in her
[1:16:48] life and and as as I as I tell this I
[1:16:51] want to understand sometimes we find
[1:16:53] ourselves here
[1:16:55] she had a need in her life and she had
[1:16:57] not had the the proper instructions with
[1:17:00] introduction with the king and the
[1:17:02] people around her was telling us you
[1:17:03] better be careful when you go in there
[1:17:06] you be careful you have to come down
[1:17:09] with bowed before him you have to gravel
[1:17:11] up to him and if he doesn't reach his
[1:17:13] scepter out to you he could kill you if
[1:17:15] you come before him she didn't she was
[1:17:19] already pronounced the
[1:17:22] queen she still didn't have full
[1:17:24] understanding
[1:17:25] of who she
[1:17:26] was so Queen Esther goes and she wants
[1:17:30] an audience with the King and when she's
[1:17:32] the door is open she gets on her hands
[1:17:34] and knees and she she gravels up to the
[1:17:36] king keeps her head down does not look
[1:17:38] at him and I thought you know if if
[1:17:40] Ester had really understood how much
[1:17:43] this King felt about her
[1:17:46] yeah she would have done exactly what
[1:17:49] the scripture tells us to do right to
[1:17:51] come boldly Before the Throne come on
[1:17:54] let your petition be known yes so when

[1:18:26] you want
[1:18:28] it that's his desire for you God God
[1:18:32] desires to give but we feel like so many
[1:18:35] times that you know God's a foreign
[1:18:38] person to us
[1:18:41] sometimes God God's on another level
[1:18:43] he's on a big cloud up here and you know
[1:18:46] I can't reach that
[1:18:48] high I'm just a little
[1:18:51] nobody yeah if if you got that mindset

[1:20:09] your father cuz you don't know who he is
[1:20:12] come on good preaching good go
[1:20:15] ahead the problem that you got if you're
[1:20:18] a son and daughter of God and I've said
[1:20:19] it here a 100 times if there's you have
[1:20:22] you you're going through a trial you're
[1:20:23] going through a test
[1:20:25] God has allowed it right if you have the
[1:20:28] Holy Ghost God has allowed it and most
[1:20:33] of the time it's because he's trying to
[1:20:35] show Satan how perfect you
[1:20:38] are oh yeah I hope they don't stumble
[1:20:41] you
[1:20:43] any it's getting the new birth yeah like
[1:20:47] I said when I was born you know after a
[1:20:49] while I understand who my dad was I
[1:20:53] understood who my mother was
[1:20:56] you'll never be able to face Satan
[1:20:59] without a new birth that's right right
[1:21:01] you
[1:21:02] can't we're going back to the scripture
[1:21:04] he's a worthy adversary without a new
[1:21:06] ver without a new birth you're stuck on
[1:21:10] he's a worthy
[1:21:11] adversary when you get the new
[1:21:14] birth what does he
[1:21:16] say anything anything you ask anything
[1:21:19] you have need of you have the power in
[1:21:21] you that the Gates of Hell will never
[1:21:23] Prevail against amen
[1:21:30] amen know as I was studying this I
[1:21:34] looked at the woman at the well this is
[1:21:35] I'm going to take a tangent I always do
[1:21:38] that and we'll get back to
[1:21:41] it but the woman at the
[1:21:45] well you know there's a lot of people
[1:21:47] that can probably put their life right
[1:21:50] there with the woman at the
[1:21:52] well but brandom said
[1:21:55] now what did this putting the old
[1:21:57] scripture with the experience Jesus was
[1:21:58] given to her talking about the woman to
[1:21:59] well what did it do it made the Messiah
[1:22:01] quickly her sins were forgiven because
[1:22:04] at the beginning she was
[1:22:06] redeemable because she was in God's
[1:22:08] thinking at the beginning and it
[1:22:10] redeemed her brought her back when she
[1:22:12] seen the expressed scripture manifest of
[1:22:15] Jehovah what he was is what he is she
[1:22:20] understood she got a proper
[1:22:23] introduction but the way this this
[1:22:24] happened Jesus was already there waiting
[1:22:26] on
[1:22:27] her you'll never be
[1:22:30] introduced to God by going out searching
[1:22:32] for
[1:22:33] him it's not you searching we've been
[1:22:35] told over and over God searched for you
[1:22:38] and God found
[1:22:40] you and and that was Jesus was waiting
[1:22:43] on her to come and he gave her a proper
[1:22:47] introduction she said I he tells her
[1:22:49] I've got water I've got water that you
[1:22:52] if you drink it you'll never thirst
[1:22:53] again he was talking about himself this
[1:22:56] is how he introduced himself to her I
[1:22:59] have water that you'll never if you
[1:23:01] drink you'll never thirst again where is
[1:23:03] this water I want some of that where is
[1:23:06] this
[1:23:08] water she thought he there was a whale
[1:23:11] somewhere there was he was the whale
[1:23:15] yeah she came from
[1:23:17] a a country that believed in signs and
[1:23:21] wonders she never asked him for one
[1:23:24] right yes she never asked him for
[1:23:27] proof she never said show me this and
[1:23:30] I'll believe
[1:23:32] you she took what she heard and
[1:23:35] introduced it to the city oh yeah and
[1:23:39] the city was
[1:23:41] saved you know so many times we want to
[1:23:44] we want to see we want
[1:23:47] proof we do we're like Gideon you know
[1:23:50] the deal with Gideon Gideon was like you
[1:23:52] know an angel came to him you got an
[1:23:54] angel standing there telling you oh get
[1:23:56] in you body man of Valor God wants you
[1:23:58] to do this this and this he wasn't a in
[1:24:01] in in Man's eyes he wasn't he was a
[1:24:04] wheat
[1:24:05] farmer right and he understood
[1:24:09] that he be to look at what he really was
[1:24:13] in in and through human eyes Gideon be
[1:24:16] to look at this is what I really am and
[1:24:18] and he be to look at that and he said I
[1:24:19] don't I don't see this then I'm going to
[1:24:21] put a fleece before the Lord if an angel
[1:24:24] come and told me something God said I
[1:24:25] think I believe him
[1:24:28] yeah but he says I'm going to put a
[1:24:30] fleece before the Lord and if the if if
[1:24:32] the Dew is on the fleece and the ground
[1:24:34] is dry then I know it was
[1:24:38] God next morning it
[1:24:41] happens and Gideon said that's final
[1:24:45] right no I need another
[1:24:49] sign if tomorrow if the fleece is dry
[1:24:51] and the ground is wet then I'll believe
[1:24:53] it we do that so many times oh yeah
[1:24:57] human nature we begin to look at
[1:24:58] ourselves what what would God see this
[1:25:00] God's want me to go do this wanting to
[1:25:03] do that sometimes God will put put it on
[1:25:05] your heart to go talk to a brother or
[1:25:06] sister and you think I don't understand
[1:25:08] that I I don't understand why God would
[1:25:11] want me to do that I I can't do that and
[1:25:13] and sometimes we hold back yes doing
[1:25:16] things that God is is pushing us to do
[1:25:18] allowing us to do and we we look at
[1:25:19] ourselves we look at our own abilities
[1:25:24] yeah and God said that ain't what I want
[1:25:25] you to look at right I want you to go
[1:25:28] introduce me to
[1:25:30] them introduce them to
[1:25:33] me because without that first they're
[1:25:36] getting ready to be introduced to hell
[1:25:38] and they'll they'll not know how to
[1:25:39] fight
[1:25:46] it it all come down to
[1:25:49] predestination if you're
[1:25:51] predestinated predestin you know a lot
[1:25:53] of people stumble over predes
[1:25:54] destination if you're
[1:25:56] predestinated and it does it doesn't
[1:25:58] matter what what you go through you're
[1:26:01] going to come out of it predestination
[1:26:03] will pull you out of it you might have
[1:26:06] to go through it several times you might
[1:26:08] have to to to fight that same battle for
[1:26:11] years I I've known people that have come
[1:26:14] to me and said pray for me over this I'm
[1:26:16] you know I'm struggling with this
[1:26:17] struggling with that you know two three
[1:26:20] years later they still they come I'm I'm
[1:26:21] struggling with you know if you're child
[1:26:24] son and daughter of God you're going to
[1:26:26] come through it yeah that's right you
[1:26:28] know I I don't understand why you know
[1:26:31] there's a lot of things that happen in
[1:26:32] our lives we don't understand I don't
[1:26:33] understand why some people battle some
[1:26:35] of the same things for for 20 years I
[1:26:37] don't understand it God does God
[1:26:39] understands I'm not judging on that
[1:26:42] right because all our battles are
[1:26:44] different right and God has a set point
[1:26:46] in time yes that when you come through
[1:26:49] that battle he's going to finally show
[1:26:52] you off when you've come conquered that
[1:26:56] that's what job did job had conquered
[1:26:58] it then he said look here's Satan he's
[1:27:03] perfect you know what I I like the most
[1:27:06] about job about the whole story of job
[1:27:08] and I don't mean sound like a broken
[1:27:09] record but he he's my favorite character
[1:27:11] in The Bible the thing that I love the
[1:27:14] most about job is when job started
[1:27:17] thinking
[1:27:18] God when job started saying I know my
[1:27:22] redeemer liveth and though the skin
[1:27:23] worms devour this flesh I know I'll
[1:27:26] still see him right and then job said I
[1:27:29] know that the last chapter job says I
[1:27:31] know that he is God and he can do all
[1:27:34] things yet at this moment job is still
[1:27:38] in the middle of his
[1:27:39] trial job is still covered in boils job
[1:27:43] is still lost everything job is still
[1:27:46] sitting on his Ash Heap and he's given
[1:27:49] God
[1:27:50] glory amen he finally understood God's
[1:27:53] in uction he finally understood what God
[1:27:56] was W to do it ain't about me it's job
[1:27:59] understood it ain't about me it's about
[1:28:01] God that's what you got to understand in
[1:28:03] your life when you're going through
[1:28:04] something in your life this is about God
[1:28:07] Amen God said I the footsteps of a
[1:28:09] righteous man are order of the Lord
[1:28:11] everything you go through will give him
[1:28:14] glory it's not about you struggling from
[1:28:17] day to day and I know that's tough I
[1:28:18] know that's hard it's not about the
[1:28:20] struggles you go through it's about God
[1:28:22] getting Glory through your strugg
[1:28:25] it's about it's about when you get to
[1:28:26] the point when you don't know where else

[1:28:32] report is his worst it's ever been the
[1:28:34] cancer spread here it's done this you

[1:28:51] that's God
[1:28:53] too it's all God Amen it's all
[1:28:57] God but God says when it gets the
[1:28:59] darkest when it gets the worst in your
[1:29:03] life I might hey satan where you
[1:29:07] been I got somebody I want to introduce
[1:29:09] you
[1:29:11] to I got somebody you're introduce you
[1:29:14] to and Devil's going to look at them and
[1:29:15] say they're so
[1:29:17] low they're so low they can't even
[1:29:20] hardly pray anymore God says that's
[1:29:23] right where I want them
[1:29:25] that's right this this is the perfect
[1:29:27] time for you to meet them because I know
[1:29:29] what they're made of I know the value in
[1:29:32] them amen we we we we spend so much
[1:29:35] energy so much time focusing on our
[1:29:39] problems we so much energy focusing on
[1:29:42] our circumstances our symptoms in our
[1:29:44] life focusing on we see Satan pulling
[1:29:47] our kids out in the
[1:29:48] world we focus on
[1:29:51] that instead of focusing God saying
[1:29:54] I'm working on a testimony for that
[1:29:56] young man am I'm working on a testimony
[1:29:59] for that young
[1:30:01] girl
[1:30:02] GL why because they have an
[1:30:06] introduction you might look at them and
[1:30:08] say they've already been introduced to
[1:30:09] hell not
[1:30:11] properly about not properly not the way
[1:30:14] God wants him
[1:30:16] to cuz when God gives them a new birth
[1:30:20] yes Satan's not going to recognize them
[1:30:24] amen Satan's not going to recognize him
[1:30:26] when your son and your daughter your
[1:30:28] husband and your wife get filled with
[1:30:30] the Holy
[1:30:32] Ghost Satan will look at them like he's
[1:30:35] never seen them the
[1:30:37] truth this is a new battle amen this
[1:30:40] this is something that they got to go
[1:30:43] through you know they're going to have
[1:30:45] to get to the point it's it's between
[1:30:47] them and God you know I told a church in
[1:30:49] in Virginia here a few weeks ago you
[1:30:52] know we we got so many times we got
[1:30:53] parents fighting their kids battles
[1:30:56] right your kids go through something
[1:30:58] parents are all over it hands all over
[1:31:00] it and God might allow that yeah God
[1:31:04] might allow that battle for them and
[1:31:07] you're messing it up they need Bolding
[1:31:10] as much as you do they need shaping as
[1:31:12] much as you do and you you try to fix it
[1:31:15] why it's human nature it's human nature
[1:31:18] moms and dads they want to do
[1:31:20] that but there has to be a proper
[1:31:22] introduction for them as Dell it's an
[1:31:25] individual walk it's a body move and if
[1:31:28] they're part of the body they'll come
[1:31:29] [Music]
[1:31:32] in but you can't put them
[1:31:35] in you can't you can't put them in and
[1:31:37] tell them listen this is what you need
[1:31:39] to do and you got to H hover over them
[1:31:42] make sure they're reading the Bible make
[1:31:43] sure that it don't work that way that's
[1:31:45] between them and God a lot of the times
[1:31:48] you'll drive your kids further away cuz
[1:31:50] you're trying to fight the battle that
[1:31:52] God gave them right
[1:31:55] I hope that's that that you understand
[1:31:57] that I don't mean to step on parents
[1:31:59] toes
[1:32:04] but so while I'm here let's stand
[1:32:08] together while I'm here I want all hell
[1:32:10] to know who I
[1:32:12] am I want hell to know who I am don't
[1:32:15] don't don't try to ride run and hide
[1:32:17] from hell don't try to run and hide from
[1:32:20] Satan cuz you're not showing him
[1:32:22] yourself right that's right you're not
[1:32:24] showing him who you are when you got the
[1:32:27] new birth you want to see him that new
[1:32:28] life you want to show Satan who that new
[1:32:31] life is inside you just like God wants
[1:32:33] to show you off you ought to want to
[1:32:35] show God
[1:32:40] off God's desire for you is that you see
[1:32:42] yourself as he sees
[1:32:45] you with all the things we got going in
[1:32:47] our lives it's it's hard to do that it's
[1:32:50] it's hard for us to see oursel like God
[1:32:52] sees us yeah that that's human
[1:32:57] nature but if you could see yourself in
[1:32:59] the in the world and you say God it's
[1:33:00] not me it's you use me how you want to
[1:33:03] use me do with me whatever you have
[1:33:05] whatever you want to do with
[1:33:07] me God use me but don't let it be
[1:33:13] me let's bow our
[1:33:17] heads I know this has
[1:33:19] been short and chopped up and I
[1:33:24] apologize for
[1:33:26] that but I pray that if something was
[1:33:28] said to somebody that would touch
[1:33:31] someone this morning amen God's faithful
[1:33:35] yes he is as our sister was
[1:33:37] singing his faithfulness is
[1:33:39] great amen it's never

[1:33:44] you have a need in your life you not
[1:33:48] taking away you have in the Holy Ghost
[1:33:50] but you might you might say Joe I I want
[1:33:53] I want Satan to know who I
[1:33:56] am don't look at it at it through the
[1:33:58] Through The Eyes Of Man to say you know
[1:34:01] hey I want me in Satan to know each
[1:34:02] other it ain't that you want Satan to
[1:34:04] know the god that's in you that's right
[1:34:07] so you if you anybody in here would got
[1:34:10] that on their heart
[1:34:12] say make that a revelation to me make
[1:34:15] that a revelation that I want hell to
[1:34:18] understand I'm a son and daughter of God
[1:34:21] and no matter you want want to get to
[1:34:24] the point where you you finally
[1:34:26] understand like job did God is showing
[1:34:29] you off because he's so proud of
[1:34:32] you that ought to be every one of our
[1:34:35] desires is God is my life to the point
[1:34:38] where you can show me off is is my my
[1:34:42] life to the point that makes you
[1:34:44] proud you know sometimes within an hour
[1:34:47] that we wake up in the morning we some
[1:34:49] many times we feel like we've already
[1:34:50] done something wrong we we we think
[1:34:52] there's no way God's proud of me because
[1:34:54] because this that's the age we live in
[1:34:57] and God said quit looking at that look
[1:34:59] at my life and you there's a deep
[1:35:01] calling to the deep and if you have a
[1:35:02] desire for god brother brandom said
