it just struck home you know that they have no protection now from the government and they could rush in at any minute and just take their lives and that's just like satan lord he's just such a coward he's just such a coward your people who are meek and gentle and sweet and loving and kind and forgiving lord and they they walk around as vessels of your spirit lord and the devil is just so afraid of of us he's so afraid and he tries to hit us when we're down lord and he doesn't realize that you never leave us and you never forsake us when we're going through the hardest times of our life you did

we mentioned brother jim babb you mentioned him in his prayer in the hospital still tim airwood in the hospital let's remember those folks and the streamers we thank god we want to we appreciate them joining us but you know they send their requests in and you know we we take those needs seriously too don't we when they had them but we're also blessed to have the people that we have praying when we bring a need here and share it people all over the world praying for our loved ones i'm thankful for that we'll bless our streamers tonight [Music] oh come behold the works of god the nations at his

you are with us with us in the fire you will lead us through the fiercest battle oh where else would we go but with the lord of hosts [Music] [Applause] my brother louie asked me to sing a song again i think i've sang it twice so i assume he wants to sing it to get it right so hopefully i get it right this time i many been god's been good in your life i know he has in my life you know i've been through quite a bit my young age but all of it i can say he's been he's been really good me [Music] pull up the lyrics here sorry [Music] lately i've been looking back along the swindling road to all familiar markers of the mercies i have known i know when mine sounds simple but it's more than a cliche there's no better way to tell you than to say my god's been good in my life i feel blessed beyond my wildest dreams when i go to sleep each night and though i've had my share of hard times i wouldn't change em if i could cause [Music] i can see that i've cried some bitter tears but i felt his arms around me as i faced my greatest fears you see i've had more gains and losses and i've no more joy than hurt as his grace rolls down upon me undeserved my god's been good in my life i feel blessed beyond my wildest dreams when i go to sleep each night and though i've had my share of hard times i wouldn't change him if i could because through it all god's been good for god has been my father my savior and my friend his love was my beginning and his love will be my end i could spend forever trying to tell you everything is but the best way that i can say is this my god's been good in my life i feel blessed beyond my wildest dreams when i go to sleep each night though i've had my share of hard times i wouldn't change him if i could cause [Music] my god's been good [Music] appreciate those songs tonight let's stand brother donnie gets ready to come tonight you know there's a i was just sitting thinking of the folks that i forgot to mention tonight and there's just so many there's so many needs that you could just go on and on and i think we got to be careful that we don't come to church and that's we want to take our brothers and sisters to the lord and we want we definitely want to intercede for them but our focus tonight is to worship god brother only read the definition of church and it's a public place where people come together to worship the lord and that's our primary focus tonight and i just i just want us to have church tonight brother donnie's prepared brother donald has carried a far heavier load than any of us can imagine with everything's going on tonight should be a reprieve for him we should be pulling on the gift worshiping god focusing for the next little bit on what god's the good things god's done for us can we just take a few moments here tonight and just have church does that sound good to everybody [Music] lord we are the ones called by your name we humble ourselves now as we pray we seek your face pour out your spirits [Applause] on me lord [Applause] [Applause] [Music] we are the ones called by your name we humble ourselves now as we pray renouncing every sin seek your face health pour out your spirits oh ourselves now as we pray renouncing every sin and wicked we need to pour foreign lord oh on me thank you lord jesus praise the lord praise the lord i mean those we needed from time to time we just need refreshing don't we from the presence of the lord to be able to come and just be able to minister to us amen we're so thankful that the lord is moving for his people and doing doing wonderful things and i really believe that what we're going through now is simply going to prepare our hearts for a great big thing he's fixing to do right down the road and our walks and in our lives you know god has a way of doing things to thin down and shake us and help our faith because he's got something greater he wants us to do now for my past me and you we want to continue to search for greater things than god never reach well i guess i've reached it i'm totally satisfied with what i am i think there's more revelation a closer walk with god a greater understanding for absolutely every person in this building tonight don't you so that's what i'm looking forward to see what the lord's going to do we're going to pray and i'm not sure what what all brother joel has mentioned but we want to continue to remember brother jim babb of course on the hospital once seen yesterday i was able to pray with him had a little bit of movement yesterday actually in his eyes and uh things none today but until the lord says different we're going to just conti continue to pray for him claim a miracle and believe the lord is going to move is that right you say but it's so far gone could be called lazarus to the pulpit tonight and ask him how far gone can you be before it's too late my name is lazarus he said also brother tim airwood had to be readmitted back to the hospital and they're treating him i was able to go see him as well and talk with him sister connie a little bit yesterday and have prayer for him and brother george is handing me this request please remember the wiggins family sister sherry's mom passed away in her sleep earlier this week so we want to remember them how many of you have a need and request on your heart tonight i believe the lord is mindful of every one of them yours might seem so small that you think my goodness with everything that's going on but i really hate to even ask the lord let me not remind you of a lady possum who resided in indiana and she had a real need one day she didn't have a bible to know that malachi 4 was even on the earth but somehow another the spirit of god led her to elijah's house now i'm not sure if there are any blessed possums but that one was a blessed possum can you imagine how many human beings went by his house laughed at him ridiculed he made fun of him called him a false prophet and everything in the world and god sent a dumb animal and that dumb animal was able to receive so you know what people can call us dummies if they want to as long as i'm getting what i need from god i really don't care you could have told that possum that he was a false prophet you could have told that possum that's a cult don't you go to that house this you think should have paid any attention to you she got what she needed and she walked out of the yard and turned back as if to say thank you and went on her merry way so if god can deal that with a dumb possum he can deal with him with a dummy like me any more damage here tonight can say the same sometimes it's not our how dumb we are that's our disgrace it's because we think we know so much so let's take our needs our requests before the lord right now father we love you so much we are so grateful lord that we could have this time to be together again tonight father a little unusual for us on thursday night but i just hated not to be able to have church in the midweek we need it so bad lord i i want to mention father these requests and brother joel i'm sure has already mentioned several but brother jim babb and you see lord the condition of our brother but father we're just asking you for your mercy until you take him or you tell me otherwise to quit praying this way i'm going to keep on praying and keep on asking and keep on believing father that you're going to move for our brother lord you know as i stood by his bedside yesterday and i walked in there no one there with me just by myself and i watched him lord for a minute or so to see if there was any movement there was nothing at all then i laid my hand on his shoulder and i started talking to him and i started telling him how much we loved him how much we appreciated him that we was praying for him sister linda for scotty lord and his eyes began to move a bit and i saw some expressions in his face and i knew he was hearing me so lord god i pray today father in the name of jesus may you move for our brother tonight lord dear god if it's your will to take him we would by no means want to hold him here in that body that he's held in but father god until you're done with him we're not going to let him go not only him but none of the rest of ours father we pray also for brother tim erwood you see lord his need and father is feeling some better today and we're grateful for that we're just believing you that you're going to continue to strengthen his body and help him lord we pray for the wiggins family you see sister sherry's mom lord to just sit back in a chair to take a nap oh my she awoke in a brand new land lord i pray that you just be with the family and help them comfort their hearts lord god we pray during this time in the name of the lord jesus and the saints said amen amen god bless you let's turn to that to uh first corinthians chapter 14. now i woke up this morning really really dizzy my eyes was dancing in my head and actually they were dancing so much that my eyes crossed and i had to put my hands over my eyes until that would pass so i might hang on to this tonight while i'm preaching but i'm not going to let it hinder me so don't you let it hinder you because i know what the lord had put on my heart and i saw you stinking rotten lowed down sorry scumbag of a devil i know why you don't want me to go to church because you don't want me to preach what the lord's given me but i'm here he's here and you all are here so i say we have church praise the lord first corinthians 14 6. now brethren if i come unto you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine and even things without life giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or harped so if a person would take a pipe or a heart or an organ or a guitar or a piano and they just kept hitting one note over and over and over and over again i'll tell you what it's going to do to you the same thing it does to me drive me nuts i love c but not by itself you see there's a difference between a note and a chord and a chord is an accumulation of several notes together so paul is here using this and saying unless there would be a distinction in the note from one key to another from one note to another an octave then there's no way to tell amazing grace how sweet the sound has saved a rich like me i once was lost but now i'm found but now blind i could see but let's add the distinction amazing grace how sweet the sound what is that distinction so the octave changed now paul said unless it gives a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or harped for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound so a sound that has not been talked a sound given distinctions and you are aware of the distinction who shall prepare himself to battle from those scriptures i want to speak to you tonight for just a bit on a time of uncertainty may the lord bless his word you may be seated let me start it out with this quote there is uncertainty on every hand everywhere you look in national affairs it's uncertainty the big four meetings now you look at this and you see that this was 1955 so there were four great powers at the time that the prophet was saying this and they would have their meetings and they would discuss this and discuss that in world peace and so on and so on so it was called the big four and he said they come together and they write out declarations but there's an uncertainty whether the other side will keep their pledge or not and that amazing here we are in 2021 and people are exactly the same as they were in 1955. it's uncertainty in everything you look at but one thing that's in christ that's one thing that you can be assured that's certain now let's let's look if we can tonight at a few things in our time that are so uncertain we have just seen a catastrophic event that has happened under the direction of our leadership of our government and that is in the land of afghanistan we've seen and dealt with 20 years of war a trillion dollars that have been spent countless of lives that have been lost people's bodies have been maimed people have lost uh limbs and sight and not even counting the psychological battles that many of those uh armed personnel would deal with for the rest of their life and tonight there is definitely an uncertainty in thee in the land of afghanistan because of the way our government handled this uh we are tonight the laughing stock of the world and you can imagine with the afghan people as the taliban is now taking over every every aspect of life in afghanistan oh we know that our president on july the 8th was asked the question do you think the taliban will come into ultimate control of afghanistan no i do not because the afghan army is 300 000 strong that's exactly the way expressed it 300 000 strong and they have an air force and they have this and that and the other and the taliban is only 75 000 people but here we are tonight because of that that makes his words even more uncertain than they were before and they were pretty uncertain with a lot of people so here we have thousands of u.s citizens that are there in afghanistan tonight we are not even sure if they will get out now we're dealing with a lot of trouble we know here and you probably saw the pictures and the videos as well that when these c-17 transport planes were coming into the tarmac and actually heading out and you had hundreds and hundreds of afghan people that were holding on to the sides and holding on to the landing gear and some of them actually held on as these c-17s took off into the air and the pictures were taken of their bodies as they were falling out of the sky human remains were actually found closed up in the landing gear why one word uncertainty they were uncertain what would happen to them when the taliban comes in so they felt like they might have a better chance can you imagine a human being being so desperate brother joel they would hang on to a wheel of an airplane that's going to wind up being 40 000 feet 42 000 feet but they were so desperate and what they knew was coming they thought surely they would not let me die they're americans they have a heart they have feeling and yet not only have we treated the afghans that way but we have many of our own citizens that are there i saw video today of a united states citizen and was pleading for help pleading for the american people to reach out to their congress and their senate that they would not be left there why because they are uncertain of the homeland that they belong to they are uncertain of the leadership that we have in the white house now don't get quite on me already they are uncertain of how they're going to be treated they are uncertain of how will they be alive by the time the reinforcements get there or will they be forgotten oh they were promised it will not be like it was at the bay of pigs there will not be any helicopters that will come in and land on the rooftops but of course if you've seen it you saw it happen in 1971 whatever it was and you saw the similar picture now in 2021 so what does that create uncertainty there is uncertainty about the atmosphere of the earth there is uncertainty about the climate change there is uncertainty about floods on the east side of the united states and droughts on the west there is uncertainty because we have just recorded in july the hottest months that has ever been recorded since they've been keeping records so we've got ice that's melting here and there and there and some say oh don't worry about it don't pay no attention to it so you go to youtube and you click on it and you go to studying and you'll find some people say oh it's terrible it's terrible and you'll find others with another explanation and you don't know which one to believe well praise the lord so what does it produce an element of uncertainty well i'm not sure if you know it or not but in the last couple of years over a million people have had to relocate in the middle east leaving places like syria and babylon iran iraq different places like that and the main reason was not because of persecution it was not because that the government was actually out to get them but it was a shortage of water because rivers are running dry lakes are running dry and evaporating just this past week the united states government to have proclaimed a drought status on the colorado river affecting lake mead and lake powell for they have reached their lowest levels since it was whenever they were built now that don't affect us you think back here oh but you're very wrong you see the thought that one source of water the colorado river actually takes care of seven states and part of mexico and 40 million people get their water to survive from the colorado river now it's not just drinking water but it is also your strawberries that come from california it is your onions it is your lettuce it is this and this and this just this year thousands and thousands of acres of farmland that had to lay in the fertile valleys of california had to lay their idol because they did not have enough allocation of water to be able to grow their crops where are you and i gonna see it at the grocery stores so what is it it is an uncertainty and you're farmers i saw one the other day on youtube actually and it was a fourth generation farmer and their great in them had moved there back in the 1800s and they'd farmed that land and dug ditches and so on to be able to irrigate the land and now this farmer sang with all these thousands and thousands of acres but they're not sure what they're going to do they're going to have to go out of business because there is an uncertainty about the water and we look at california with all the fires that are going on right now you know it of course also when you look in siberia as i saw it day before yesterday the largest fire now on the on the hope entire planet covering thousands and thousands of acres and everywhere we look whether it's from the east or the west it is uncertainty that's going on everywhere it is uncertainty about the fires what are we going to do thousands of structures have been destroyed in california and the last few weeks now of course you know whenever it does this and then when the rains come then it allows all the wash off to come off of there and then it comes to the tributaries and the streams so that creates another problem and then we look at the world powers people are so uncertain and they just don't feel safe well it's china what's china going to do and what's russia going to do and what about iran isn't it amazing that america shut down her embassy in afghanistan but iran did not have to shut thirst down nor did china have to shut theirs down nor did russia have to shut theirs down because they are in cahoots together now think of it it's all all getting ready for america to appear in a very weak vulnerable state to embolden our enemies it to embolden even those that hate us and would love to attack us love to absolutely annihilate us and it also makes us look weak not on inside of our enemies but also in the sight of our allies our allies are running us down because of what has happened in this latest scene in afghanistan and to be honest with you they ought to because many many lies will be lost because of it and yet what was it because of the faltering of our government can't you see friend what it is the whole world around us is falling and crumbling away it must give way to a brand new kingdom and yet what is the producer among the american people our president that many so loved and so thought would turn everything around you had to be a little bit worse thinking in the first place if you hear him talk a little bit and why they kept him here they kept him here for a reason don't you figure because he didn't have no sunscreen didn't want him to get sunburned it was because he was hiding his ability but what is it now now we're stuck with it well you look at who's the vice and you think my goodness what shall we better off with him or her but you know that this must come and watch our enemies look at him they think they are so weak they are so vulnerable and it must embolden our enemies russia wouldn't be something to be in some of their inner circle meetings and hear them as they are talking about us and our leader the leader of the free world our president is not just to lead to the united states but he's known around the world no matter who he is in the white house is known as the leader of the free world if this is the leader of the free world freedom is in trouble and what does it produce it produces uncertainty and yet it leaves something and uncertainty creates doubt and it can create fear oh but i'm so glad tonight that the bride of christ has an absolute and that is christ the word oh you imagine living in this world and people not knowing what the answer is and people looking on the powers of america it's hard to believe really that we've changed this fast in seven months under this new presidency what has happened and how america has eroded to where that we were energy free and selling all this all and this now the other now we have to beg the old nations to be able to sell to us it's amazing how things can happen so fast oh but i'm so glad that the bride of christ is getting ready every day of her life i'm uncertain too about politics i'm just not certain which one's going to be it's going to this or that or the other i'm uncertain about this and that when it comes to the natural realm but i'm so glad i've got a certainty in my soul tonight notice this the prophet goes on to say you've got to have the certainty of anything to know whether it's right or not so what does that leave us in whenever we don't have a certainty about something well i don't know i don't know if this is right or that's why i'm just confused and that's exactly where the majority of our world is now we're living in a day of great uncertainty we all know that the day of uncertainty and the time of uncertainty i don't believe there was ever a time since it first began back in the garden of eden when sin come in and broke eternity into time i do not believe there's ever been a space of time with so much uncertainty now can you imagine this one was 1960. here we are 61 years or whatever more later what would he say now brother dave if it was uncertain in 1960 what about 2021 oh my oh my i do not believe there's ever been a space of time with so much uncertainty as today because there's not even one hope left in the natural world today so no matter which way you look dealing with our situation to where we are in the present time dealing with diseases and sicknesses and you know all the epidemiologists saying to this and one say to that and one say something else and this and went to college 18 years this and went 14 years and they're saying opposite things they say which one do i follow which one do i do we've got baxters and anti-vaxxers and massacres and end time actors and then they'll come to the same church you know well one don't believe this and one believes in that some still don't believe covetous real they still think it's made up believe me i've buried enough people to know it is real is it lies is it politics oh yes all that's attached to it but friends this virus itself is a killer that's right notice this now let's take something else he said that's uncertain just so many things jobs is uncertain i was thinking about this whenever i'm studying on this how different now whenever brother branham was here about jobs but now we've got jobs but we've got too many lazy people that don't want them because our government is paying them to stay at home my goodness you've got we hire signs at wendy's at mcdonald's everywhere five thousand dollar sign on bonus you gotta be kidding me working at a drive-through and they're gonna pay you five thousand dollars sign on bonus we're giving this and we're giving that but what is it it's an uncertainty and look eventually them checks are gonna stop somebody's gonna have to pay this big bill when we're writing all this money well come on somebody somebody's gonna have to take care of all this our government can't do it remember the same government that's doing all this are the same ones that just made these decisions about afghanistan so if you think you can trust them look at their record and you'll realize there's a bunch of liars a bunch of thieves and they ain't got no business being there in the first place so let me point you in the direction tonight that we can look it's not toward the white house it's not toward any place on this earth our vision should be toward the lord jesus oh my he said you can have a good job you sink and the next day the boss comes around and gets somebody else and kicks you out and puts somebody else in so it's uncertainty of your job let's think also home life is uncertain divorce might as i was looking at the stats on this how it's increased around the world in the last few years even during the time of covet more people are found for divorce more people have been all kinds of things one after another after another because people have been forced to live at home and they realized they didn't love that man they married that woman they're married after all they was having to spend more time with them on normal work basis they just spent a couple hours a day and now they're shut up in the same house and they say you know what i don't like this guy so you know lawyers have been taking advantage of it and putting up advertisements on youtube and facebook and this and that divorce lawyers because it shot through the roof oh you got them crooks that take advantage of everybody's heartache and trouble and what is it home life is uncertain and we've got to a place that our government wants to tell us how to raise our children [Applause] that's right they want to tell us how to raise our children what we can do and what we cannot do and how we can do this now another don't tell me friends i just got a call the last few days from one of our great great people from jmc you know all this and this deal over to med center and moana talk to me about why we preach this and preach that and the other and that a certain person didn't want to live this way and comply that way and it's really harmful for their health and they don't need to do this and that and the other one me to compromise on what we believe to be the truth and then try to bring a little bit of threat to you well you want to be held accountable i said do you want to be held accountable you want to be held accountable if we give in on this part and then we give on something else and something else and you stand before god are you willing to answer for that person so thank you sir have a good day that phone call didn't equip but what do they want to do they don't want to just let you live the way you think you want to live the government wants to be able to control us and tell us what we can do cannot do will they do the hindus that way of course not well they do the muslims that way of course not but it's the conservative christians that have a standard for the word of god come on somebody preach on it enough but why does it make it it makes it uncertain oh my it makes the times that we live uncertain it makes church life now i hate to say it this way but i might as well church life is uncertain for a lot of folks you know they just don't understand what in the world is going on well i'll be the first one to admit to you i don't understand all that's going on either i i never realized that we would go through such things as we have been over the last year and has it been tough yes it's been tough on you it's been tough on me tough on the ministry been tough on all of us but i realize also at the same time as difficult as it's been i just heard today that some of the churches in the philippines have not been able to assemble together and have church for 18 months so it's not been so bad for us after all has it and we didn't like it because we had to stream we didn't like because it was 10 or 12 of us i didn't either i didn't like it but can you imagine not being able to meet together for 18 months you imagine brother fred how uncertain that you would be in the supernatural realm and then satan throws all these thoughts hey i thought you said god loved you god knew this was going to come and you're supposed to go to church well why did god let all this happen well i just i have to answer oh blabber mouse back and say i don't have a clue but me and you ain't on speaking terms so i'm not wasting my time talking to you i'll just talk to father and say father i don't understand but i know it's all gonna work for our good somehow i don't understand why we was not able to have church i don't understand why but don't you imagine friends in the times of the early martyrdom and you think we've lost several out of our church many people around the world have died during this time of the covenant with saying wow what a terrible saying but can you imagine a selling carol come to church tonight in the days of the martyrdom and whenever they would come and attack the churches in in corinth or in rome or thessalonica wherever it was and the romans would come and get them and crucify them and beat their brains out and all the horrible things they would do and maybe annihilate an entire church an entire church in a couple of days take an entire church to the coliseum of rome and there lose the pastor the deacons the all ever ever member of the church and the church be totally eradicated you imagined by the john it must have been in their humanity and they think god what is going on how could this be your will lord lord we do not understand and it went on and on all that i love the way the book of acts says it the bible says that the churches had rest so god let them be tried and he let them be tested and then god gave them a season of rest i don't know about you i'm hoping it's right around the corner for us but god knows exactly what to let families and churches and ministries go through we believe his word he'll never let more come upon us than what we are able to bear how he believes that absolutely as the saints of god we do what's this problem the prophet said let us take home life it is uncertain you don't know what's happened to the moral fiber of our women brother branham betty if you was here today you'd really ask that divorce is on the move why it's terrible well you see the divorce courts are crowded where girls and boys will marry and live together have two three kitties or something like that and they'll separate and go out and marry another marry another marry another marry another oh my goodness oh children what what will it be if the lord tarries a few more years do you realize that 72 percent of black children in america are born without a father in the home hispanics indians whites it's not just in one race but over the whole spectrum raising them in a home and many times they don't even know who their father is because the way the mother lived and what is that going to do it's going to make them uncertain it's going to put well they don't know if they can trust a man they can't trust a woman they can't trust this and it's getting about that way anymore when it comes to church people don't know who to trust well i don't think trust this one he says this this one says that but it's uncertainty everywhere you look unless you're looking up this way [Applause] now don't look up here and think you can find the certainty your soul needs ah i'm just as much a human as you are i i misunderstand things just like you do and sometimes i've been in the dark about what we've been going through just like you have but look in the same direction i'm looking follow me as long as i follow christ and this is where my eyes are up this way now watch this the brother said the uncertainty of home life the uncertainty of job the uncertainty of war the uncertainty of churches my it's amazing how many thousands of churches have folded up during covet thousands of churches that no longer even have church why it's so uncertain and for some of them that are open they've lost so many people they're having to rent out part of their building for daycare or for offices or this or that or the other to be able to keep the electricity bills paid and part of the overhead it's so uncertain don't you see what the world needs the world needs a messiah [Music] the whole thing is setting up everywhere all around the globe they need a superman oh and the devil's got one right in the making this is going to fall apart and that's going to fall apart and that's going to fall apart and all mine when the bride is going up then here will be the man that'll step right in and said children i'm the man you've been looking for i will cross craft to prosper which is prosperity of course merchandise and manufacturing i will do this and i will do that and the world will swoon after him and they will follow him straight to the gates of hell oh brother donna i'm worried about it don't worry about if you got the holy ghost you ain't going to be here nowhere [Applause] notice this he said you just can't evaluate it hardly because there's no way to evaluate what a experience in the holy ghost is to a membership of a church now he's comparing church membership to the baptism of the holy ghost there ain't even no comparison there's no comparison whatsoever and it is not uncertain praise god notice he said we live in a day of uncertainty can you imagine in the times of martyrdom and persecution and the church did not have retrospectibility the way we do today and we can look back and see when the prophet wrote to us the seals by the inspiration of god that god was sowing a seed down into the ground paul never said that paul never said look children don't worry there's another bride that's going to come up the omega bride 2 000 years down the road and you're the alpha bride and you've got to be buried in the dirt of denomination so the omega bride can come out of those systems and bring forth the very same crop you did now but instead they've just wondering oh lord what's going on oh god so you go to church and you lose your life for going to church you go to the house of god and you and your wife are arrested and somebody else gets your children you're torched you're fed to lions you think they didn't have some uncertainty you think they didn't say god what what is god i never realized me serving you lord that i would deal with this i don't understand lord i don't understand and oh brother sister i'll tell you one thing when satan can see that uncertainty in our heart he loves to attack that avenue well what about this and what about that and how come this and what about that and you might as well just go and say him to it much of it we are not going to understand we just have to commit it to god and say lord you work it all out according to your good pleasure [Music] my notice he said we live in a day of uncertainty we live in a day when there's everything almost that we can put our hands on and the natural is uncertain oh my goodness so here we are we thought we was coming out of a pandemic we didn't realize that there was going to be variance we saw when we went through some of you in july and august and may and whatever it was in 2020 my praise god we got that behind us and by then we already was pretty much convinced we couldn't really trust our government and we sure can't trust china don't you love the way china does things i mean if this actually did come out from the wuhan uh place there they send it to us and then they start making masks and send them to us wow ain't that cute and i told carol a month or so ago i said if you notice how many more masks that there are and it seemed like they were dying down and you wasn't seeing them nowhere and i told her i said i sure hope that ain't a sign of things that are to come and then here you go we get another variant oh but now they're so cool with those masks because now what they're doing is color coordinating the mask for the ladies so if you have the blue polka dot desk so i say erica's got on and then they're they're so nice and cool because they're making that that mask to match that dress now isn't is that not that fashion or what do you think friends do you think then that they tell us it didn't happen by mistake and you are going to believe that you are going to believe that whenever our surgeon general stood and said the masks are useless they are useless the same man said just a couple of weeks ago and said oops we made a mistake we shouldn't have said that so was he right then or right now i wore the mask i sanitized my hands i've done everything like i was supposed to do and got covered anyway did it make much difference i don't know if it made any difference or not other than smothering me to death the whole time i wore the crazy thing you think i like mess you're crazy there's only one masked man that i used to like and that was zorro when i was a kid but i have grown up so i don't like him on me i don't like him on you well come on and then we come to the vaccine and then oh my we've got message people that are fussing and fighting in argument and this and that and the other and we've got the vaccers and the message and the anti-vaxxers in the message and each one of them has got their little debits you know well they can be able to click on youtube or this doctor that doctor depending on which way you lean and which way you want to go towards and the bottom line is there is just as much uncertainty now as it was when it started months and months ago what shall we do brother donnie pray saints pray with all of us we cannot trust our government we cannot trust even a lot of our health care people they're pushing people out of there you know it as well as i do they've got so much on their hands there's no way people are getting the care they need because they can't give it to them it's uncertain i sure wouldn't want to go to a hospital right now i don't mind telling you well hallelujah praise god why it's uncertain and then this this great doctor that's got this degree i was reading some of them to carol last night which trained brother ron spencer services i was reading some things out of carol and this guy was so-and-so the immunologist so and so and so and so and so and so on he had so many things i just added a few myself and i called him reseology and s'moreology and all that other stuff too because i thought man a guy with that many degrees he needs a couple more so carol was just sitting there of course laughing at me and then he said one thing and then i pulled up another one with all these degrees behind his name and he said the exact opposite now you're saying which one was right rhysology or s'moreology what does it produce for those of you that would even want to know where would you look for an answer of truth well brother donnie i trust the statistics which ones whose or cdc's or wuhan's what is it friend it's a time it's a time of uncertainty now i'm not telling you not to be concerned about such things i think these things are important to us and i think each of us have to make the decisions about what we do and all this stuff of life oh my i hope you understand the reasons that i've even asked for mask and this and that and the other it's not to make life hard on you it's to protect you i love you if that be one person that we could stop from getting i'd do everything i could to stop one person believe me i don't want to lose another one i prayed and prayed and prayed and stood by those that were gasping for breath if there's one thing i could do to stop one of you from being there you better believe i'm going to do it whether you understand me or not or whether you think i'm overboard or not that's entirely up to you but when i stand before god i will give an account for trying my best to spare you this hell and people are still uncertain well i don't know you're going to get the one shot or the two i ain't getting neither one of them things and blessed things i'll tell you one thing them straight out of the pits of hell they'll most shot by them things they just come up with them somebody else said no they've been working on this technology for 20 20 years that's a bunch of lies you can't believe them liars and there you go and you was ready to pull into walgreens and make your appointment and then you pull back out and say thank you jesus thank you jesus and then you hear of these stats and these things you're saying oh maybe i should do it you say no it's the devil that's the devil trying to talk me into it children it's sad where we are now you're laughing but you know it's the truth some of our own people don't know what to do and don't you ask me because i ain't gonna tell you i'll tell you the same thing i've told everybody else around the world that's asked me you asked god you asked god what you ought to do and you're getting a shot which one you ought to give you ask god and he'll never tell you're wrong oh hallelujah so there's uncertainty in science scientifically prove this and this and this and this and then six months later scientifically prove this and this and this and i guess it depends on which side of the six months you are whether you're saved or not so what do you do you're so uncertain you don't know what to do and then you got people in the message preachers that are preaching that the vaccine is the mark of the beast how can a message preacher be so ignorant you ought to study the message y'all just have to make them the vaccine is not the mark of the beast the mark of the beast is denominational denominationalism well praise the lord and then you've got others that say oh my this certain certain woman she got the vaccine and when she walked by a computer her name splashed up on there and her address and her social security number oh lord it's probably more dangerous for you to go out here and get in your car and pull out on this highway which i won't miss none when we get away from here and we worry and fret do you understand the prophet of god said the worst thing satan can ever put upon you is fear [Music] [Applause] someone was telling me the other day they heard the different things about people who get the covet and the different things that lead to mortality about it and there's talking about this and that and the other you know and the second most important thing that this board of doctors was saying that they felt like was one of the worst things that could happen to people was fear fear i thought yeah that's what their prophet said all those years ago fear and people are terrified oh i believe we should be cautious yes i believe we ought to wash our hands i believe we ought to do whatever we can do but friends don't live under the fear of this thing our lives are not in the hands of the devil they are in the hands of almighty god if we don't believe that we might as well quit serving hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] a time of uncertainty notice he said we live in a day of uncertainty and living today almost everything you put your hands on the natural it's uncertain so much uncertainty till the nations are quaking uncertainty in our national security there's no nation safe anymore to be the victims to russia by midnight tonight now you imagine this is 1961. what could they do now or either being bits it depends on what russia wants to do about it what did that last angel's message say listen to this carefully when he crossed the three angels babylon has fallen is fallen and become the habitation of every unclean spirit that's exactly where it's at sure we have no security in our nation don't you see that third angel's message has already sounded doom has done been pronounced on babylon and she will finally be blowed to bits i don't care who we put in the white house it will make no difference something's worse than others we know that but it don't matter who we put in there they will never change it the message of the angel has already come forth babylon is fallen it's faulty it's uncertain everywhere uncertainty there's no way there's uncertainty in your job uncertainty in politics uncertainty in the democrat party uncertainty in the republican party uncertainty in all the parties well friends if you think this is just an america you need to open your eyes a little bit look in france was all the protests that are going on in france which is a very liberal nation compared to us but yet all the protests because of the mandates of this and that and the other look in australia got the mandate stricter there just reset them again this week straight to that than what we've ever had here in america and they are protesting and people are resting the police arresting them shooting them with tear gas what does it produce and people saying oh no oh no they're taking my rights next thing they want my gun next thing they want this what does it make us as american citizens feel uncertain because big brother is always watching you i'll pick up my cell phone just every now and then and say hey just in case you're listening go ahead and record me [Music] you ever noticed so you talk about eating somewhere doing this and that and the other and then you open google next time and there it is on your advertisements come on joe i'll turn it off well maybe you might be able to do it but they're still watching you and people scared to death that there's a computer chip and a vaccine and they're going to watch them you've got some bigger net in your purse you're packing around that's your iphone sis that's your droid they keep up with you isn't it amazing carol and i were getting our vehicle on sunday morning on wednesday night it didn't do it tonight because we usually don't have church on thursday night but on wednesday night or saturday night and sunday morning whenever i back out of my garage before i get out of the garage it will tell me it's 12 minutes to happy valley church of jesus christ now what's it doing it is patterning my behavior it knows exactly pretty much where i'm going when i get ready to leave tonight it'll tell me exactly how long it's going to take me to go home and it'll be right unless i go through taco bell and get a taco so if they can do that how much more are they listening are they watching just in case you feds are listening this sermon tonight i hope you bunch of devils get saved and get the holy ghost for this whole thing blows apart [Applause] well don't you want them saved hallelujah well all you say the democrats are do it we can well see what they've done and we can well see what happened when the republicans had it don't you understand neither party can turn it around it's doomed and damned oh my notice the prophet said in the church it's also uncertainty how can we have about 900 different organizations and every one of them differ one to the other and fussing one or the other how can a poor laity know what to do how can the people know where to stand and what does it make uncertain well my mama was a baptist but then she married a methodist and then my uncle was a pentecostal so i'm a pentecostal myth a heck of alcoholic bad catholic uh i don't know what i am that's right they really don't know where they fit they don't know where they're blocked well one's just as good let's see him if my daddy was a pentecostal and my mama was a baptist does that mean i'm a baby or a penny baby or a method i don't know what i am anymore i don't want him i can tell you what i am a word born holy ghost filled heaven bound christian so ain't got no group i identify with as far as the nomination but i want to know that i'm certain i want to know that i can be certain when i die that i have made peace with my god and i've done everything that i know to do oh praise the lord let me jump down to the last quote here we'll close you've done good thank you look at this in the absolute in phoenix what the christian needs today in this atomic age and this time of uncertainty you need something besides just an experience of joining church you need an anchor an absolute that you know because churches will fail people will fail but christ cannot fail now i want you to notice how your prophet what he pointed us to as the absolute and if we point to anything different from him we're not saying what he said now notice because churches will fail people will fail but christ cannot fail he's he's the absolute to the believer and if christ is your absolute you're tied to him and if he is your absolute and you're tied to him then you're tied to the word well politics is uncertain that's right churches are uncertain that's right but if you have got a place that you can tie look we don't want to be tied to a doctrine in this message i don't want to be tied to jeffersonville i don't want to be tied to some church in louisiana some church in alabama i want to be tied to the lord jesus now watch he's going to tell us how we'll know if you're tithed there or not now this tells whether you've got the right absolute or not c if you can read in that scripture something that christ has ordained or commissioned us to do such as lay hands on the sick or preach or you know whatever christ has commissioned us to do and because of some twisting around and if someone would tell you that was for the disciples or someone else you don't hold on to that then christ is not your absolute so someone tells you that brother branham was all of the fivefold ministry and we don't need any more preachers their absolute is not christ according to the seventh angel well well well he's the same yesterday and forever except we don't believe in miracles and we don't believe in well your absolute is not christ how could you be tied to christ when your life being saved by god is a miracle and you not believe in miracles how could a miracle not believe in other miracles oh praise god friends right here's a problem many of our folks christ is not they're absolute well praise god then christ is not your absolute that person who led you out of the way is your absolute oh my but if that word christ still holds see then he's your absolute we mustn't let anything stir us out of the way of the word [Music] and the church said covet 19 vaccers anti-vaxxers massacres anti-massacres churches anti-churches make sure you've got a thai post please don't misunderstand me when i say this your typos cannot be your memory in quoting scriptures some people think that's their typos them quoting you'll get to a spot you'll lose your memory but if christ is in your soul even when your memory is gone brother tom you've still got that top host in the soul don't make your toe oh well brother branham is my absolute i can understand where you're going i can understand where you are going but the man himself that you are calling his name told us to make christ our absolute yes we take his teachings and we believe as it was in the days of paul when they took that that it was a prophet's word that's right but and when you come to this you cannot get brother branham in your soul then this doctrine that doctrine this man that man there's only one person that can get in your soul and that's christ jesus or the devil make christ your absolute and if you get the holy ghost in your soul don't you worry you'll have the right balance with the message amen can we stand together thank you lord jesus hallelujah thank you lord jesus thank you lord jesus aren't you glad in this day of uncertainty we have an absolute a tied post to our souls we'll always have these things of life friends he said brother tony you didn't answer on these questions exactly right exactly right i am not to be the person that you come to and has the answer you run from any man that has all the answers for your life he's lying to you even the prophet of god couldn't answer everything everybody asked there's only one that can do that and that's almighty god but this is something about it whenever we're uncertain about this and that and the other can you imagine the world out here now many of them don't know what to believe they don't know which way to go they're not sure about our peace are we going to have any peace what about our money what about our rights what about this what about that what about that and every one of them feeding on one source of the news and then someone else feeds feeding on another source and then they they talk and they hash it all out oh my goodness and if they don't have an absolute and really know where this thing's going to end can you imagine when they lay down at night how troubled they must be but tell me how good does it feel when you lay down at night and you tell the lord how much you love him and how much it means to you and you go to drifting off and your alpha brain waves begin to change and then they'll go into that straight line and then going into the deeper sleep and you lose consciousness and it's such a wonderful thing to know as our sister that out in arkansas just sat down back in the recliner to take a little rest she got a little rest all right praise god if there's something that brother west we go home tonight we lay down our eyes are never open again in this mortal body but we've got an absolute we've got an absolute my absolute friends is not doctrines of this message don't you understand why i blessed that so much we are not going to be in eternity discussing serpent seed we are not going to be in eternity discussing the seven seals or the seven thunders what we're going to be doing in eternity is worshipping our lord god our savior our messiah our master this is why i don't understand people that don't want to worship him now i don't understand that i think what are they going to do for eternity ought to burst something in us that makes us want to love him and worship him with all of our hearts oh praise god lord jesus it makes us look about lord and we hear it from one to the other to the other lord our president told us just a little bit ago that if we would get vaccinated we would not we would not get covet but of course now we know that is not true and we truly want to give medical science they are learning as they go we know that and we will allow them that but which one do we believe this one says this and can scientifically prove it and this one says that oh god we're so grateful that we have something certain tonight our king our savior our resurrected lord and you left us your word to be able to lead us to that blessed place oh thank you heavenly father so in uncertain times we're so thankful that we have an absolute and that absolute will guide us so father i'm sure some of these here lord they're looking at various decisions in their life and they don't know what to do many of them trying to decide on this and decide on that we see the protest around america because of schools and lord i'm wanting to mandate our kids to wear them and scientists has not been able to really say will it damage their lungs would it hurt their lungs and some say oh it's crazy to say such a thing and others say no no it's legitimate we need to research this and check into it so there again it makes us uncertain oh jesus pull us up next to yourself would you lord during these troublesome times whisper into our ear and let us know you still love us you still care for us father thank you lord jesus father we're just asking you that you'd move for your children around the world lord this covet thing took us all totally by surprise we never ever saw anything like this would ever come and not just affect the population of the earth but affect all the churches and all your ministers there's not a minister lord hardly around the earth that i know that's not been affected by this thing or a church but yet you knew it lord is this all part of bringing a desperation to us you told us through your prophet that if we didn't get desperate we'd miss it and yet you told us we couldn't get desperate within ourselves so we're in a fix almost says that we're a catch-22 that we got to be desperate and we can't be desperate on our own but you sure know how to turn up the pressure to make us desperate so father i pray you'd help each of us lord in uncertain times that we can be so grateful when we lay down on our beds tonight that we can have a certainty in our hearts if there's anyone here or anyone under the sound of my voice it's heard this service it's not in the visible audience that those are not ready to meet you may they find that certainty that absolute vindication of the resurrection of the lord jesus in their life and the evidence will be they can say amen to every word of god they will let no one explain it away no one devalue it because they have been born by the breath of god himself oh jesus thank you for such an absolute and troublesome times father i pray for those lord we don't get one buried till we have just a few days and then another lord we still want to remember those that have lost loved ones lord the term lost you know what i mean when i say that father and our terms they're not lost when we know where they are but they're lost from our presence or away from our presence we know different ones are still grieving father we pray that you'd be with them comfort them with us lord them children them grandchildren widowers father oh jesus may your grace move upon each heart i was reminded today thinking about it it's similar as it been in ages gone by when the inquisitions was going on and the martyrdoms was taking place you veiled a gathering time of many of your children and you let them go under a martyrdom or an inquisition in spain or wherever it was this time you wanted to call a bunch of your children home and you veiled it or allowed them to go oh it looked like you think why in the world when the lord just let them go to sleep that's the way we're looking at it death to you is so different from us it doesn't really make any difference whether they go by covet or a car wreck or just go to sleep in a chair the bible says in your sight in your sight the death of your people of the saints is precious because they catch that taxi and they span that bridge and they're burst onto that theophany body oh lord god comfort every heart would you lord bring peace i pray father we love you jesus with all of our hearts thank you lord god i mean he loves him with all your heart can we just worship him a little bit before we go i know you got to work tomorrow and stuff but can we just worship him just a little bit but the door maybe and come sing that song about the storm that you sing be discouraged why should i be discouraged when you sung on this sermon you preach praise god for an anchor amen to know the gospel makes that certain sound that we can rest our souls on thank god that he in this hour we're living in such confusion and such uncertainty he has spoken to us friends
