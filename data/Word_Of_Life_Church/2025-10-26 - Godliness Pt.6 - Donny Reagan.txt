But aren't you glad for the evening light? &gt;&gt; Like brother Donnie said here a while back. All these people that are trying to get us to turn away from following the prophet and the message. What have you got that you think's better? Where would we go? I mean, don't you feel that way? Where would Lord, where would I go to if I if I couldn't if I didn't have the message? Just take me out of this world. I thank God for the evening light. The spirit and the bride are saying [singing] come. [music] The elect [singing] are feeling the stir inside their heart. [music] Cuz our uniting [singing] time has come. We and the father [music] are one. [singing] [music] who will be with our Lord forever [music and singing] more. Oh, the evening light [music] has come. The bride is making [singing] preparation. We're [music] hearing the shout of our king. [music] The token man. [music] He's cleaning from inside [singing] and the dove leaves [music] a lamb once again. Fine linen clean [music and singing] and white was granted to her. She's [music] been washed in the blood [singing] of God's own son with [music] righteousness. It's not our [singing] own. We stand just before his [music] throne where [singing] we reign with our Lord forever [music] more. Oh, evening [music] light has come. The bride is making preparations. Today [music] we're hearing the shout [singing] of our king. [music] The token man. He's cleaning from [music] inside. And the dumb made a lamb once again. [music] Oh, the evening light has come.

[music] I'm glad the lead [music] once again. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen. That's wonderful. God bless you. You can be seated for just a couple of moments. I've got a baby to dedicate today. Brother Tyler and Sister Caitlyn, if I bring a little son, we'll dedicate him to the Lord today. And it a privilege for us to be together in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sing it. &gt;&gt; Bring [music] them in. Bring them [singing] in from the [music] fields of sin. Bring them in. Bring [singing] them in. Bring the little ones to [music] Jesus. [singing] Let's bow our heads together. Heavenly Father, what a great honor and a privilege it is another little child that we can bring into your presence. Lord, we can see the darkness and the chaos that's around us every day in the world that we live. If we didn't have you, it would be frightening to think that we would want to bring children into this world in its present state. But Lord, we're grateful that we're not just bringing them into this life, but we're believing that they will be with us in that life that is to come. For Isaiah said it would be them and their offspring with them. My brother and sister want to bring their little son to you today. father. Whenever they brought him home from the hospital, no doubt they told him to do this and that and the other. But no matter how hard they would have searched, there would have been no manual to come home with him, how to raise him, how to influence him, how to affect him in life. But you've already given that to us, Lord. It's your word. So I pray that you'd help my brother. Pray that you'd help my sister. She's been given the great title of the fifth gospel, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Mother. I pray you'd help both of them, Father, to be able to influence his little life in a way that will be pleasing to you. Keep him from the evils of the day, Father. We dedicate his little life to you, Father, in the name of Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he wanted to look around a little bit and see you all. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together if you would. We'll turn to second Peter chapter 1 verse 2. Certainly welcome each of you here today in the house of the Lord. um brothers and sisters here from Ukraine, Brother Alex, mom and dad, and those that are with them, any visitors, other visitors that we have. We've been looking at the um the divine nature of God and being partakers of it and God building a body, a mystical body for his presence to dwell in. and those virtues which God by his very own nature wants to put in us. So let's read together. Second Peter 1 verse 2. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. According as his divine power hath given unto us all things. Wow. Isn't that wonderful? all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue. Whereby given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And beside this, giving all diligence and to your faith virtue to virtue, knowledge to knowledge, temperance to temperance, patience, and to patience, godliness, and to godliness, brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, charity. How many like to be remembered today as we pray? Amen. God bless each of you. Heavenly Father, we count it such a great honor once again that we could be able to come together, not only just physically that we would have strength and be well enough to do it, but still so far living in a nation that we can have this right. We're grateful, Lord God. We realize our nation is represented in the book of Revelation with those two horns. And we know, Father, one day she will raise up and it will try to take that from us. To me, prophecy is unclear as far as how how far along it will move when the bride is still here. But we know one thing. You will have us prepared for whatever will come. And we believe your word now will help us to be ready for what the future holds. So you saw the hundreds of hands that were uplifted today. Maybe sickness, financial needs, troubles in their homes, whatever they are. Lord Jesus, would you meet each one of us in our need? Help me, Lord, that I can speak that which is only beneficial and helpful. Dear God, shut my mouth to anything that would displease you. I realize I stand in one way in a dreadful place today. Any preacher that stands up behind this pullpit, not only this one, but different ones around the world, what a what a great thing it is. And yet, what a responsibility that goes with it. And if I get to it today, Lord, to read it to them, what your prophet said when he called this pulpit the sacred desk. A sacred desk, the closest thing to heaven on this earth, a pullpit. And dear God, I pray that you'd help me every time I stand, whether it's here or wherever else it is, help me to do it. with that knowledge. Lord, speak to us today. We pray in the name of Jesus. And the saint said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be may be seated. [laughter] So, we've been looking today again. We want to pick it up at godliness. And we know that godliness is my goodness within a series that anybody could take on that word only and no telling how long that we would be able to go on it because to be godly to be like God would certainly be so many things. And yet we know that it's been made possible by him that we could have a godly nature, godly desires, godly behavior, and that which is pleasing to him in this life. And what I closed out with the last time that we looked at this about being godly was that God goes to church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Aren't you glad you believe God goes to church? &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you want to go to church? &gt;&gt; We'll read today again in Luke 4:E 16. And he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. And as his custom was, his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read. I remember whenever Jesus would have went to church and started going there in the synagogue as a little boy being dedicated in the temple but there was only one temple but there were all kinds of little towns and villages so each one of them couldn't have a temple so they did have a synagogue so a synagogue was a place which a multi multi-purpose building they would have gatherings and this and that in it but no sacrifice so there was no blood no mercy mercy seat, no shakina glory, no law, no Torah, no Mishna, nothing there as far as divine supernatural. And remember remember these guys would get up and they they take the scroll and they'd stand and read it and read it and comment on it. The bar bar mitzvah would have been held there when a boy turned 12 years old and for the first time he would be allowed to take the scroll and read it publicly. He was considered to be a man when he could do that. So there would have been as far as we have a record of no miracles, nobody got saved, uh nobody got healed, nobody got delivered, but Jesus was faithful to go to church in so much that Luke wrote this many years after the Lord Jesus had left the earth and said that it was his custom. It was his custom to go to church. So if the Lord Jesus would have went to church in that day and there was no move of God at all, I wonder what he'd do today. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Now think of it. You'd never see a move of God. It would be the same thing over and over and over again. So they would have the people that would sing the songs and the women was on one side, the men on the other. And the women were never allowed to even stand in the pulpit. They were never allowed to take the Torah and read it openly. They were not allowed to do any of that, participate, only behind a little veil that would have been there. But Jesus was an habitual worshipper in the synagogue. So, it's something about him. Now, remember, wonder if he ever got anything when he went there. Wonder if he got anything out of the service. Well, you know, if Jesus was the word and they would at least stand up and read the word, no doubt he could have got something out of the service. I figure that if you and I go with the right attitude, we can get at least something out of the service. Now, Luke leads up here to a very phenomenal time in Jesus' life. And it's a it's kind of a dispensational change because he's going to take the word and the priest handed him the word. Now, this is not the first time it's happened, of course, but it's the first time that something like this is going to happen. So, he finds a place in the scroll, and it's Isaiah 61. And he read, and you remember what Jesus said, "This day, this scripture is fulfilled." And Luke 4:20, he closed the book and gave it again to the minister, and sat down, and the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him. And he be to say unto them, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears." Now Jesus goes on from there. That within itself would have been overwhelming. But he goes on in several more verses and tells them some more things. Now listen what happens in this church service. Chapter 4 28. And all they in the synagogue when they heard these things were filled with wrath. &gt;&gt; What a church service. &gt;&gt; And rose up and thrust him out of the city. Now Carol and I stood there a few years ago where this happened right there in the little village of Nazareth. So they had a little synagogue that they had rebuilt there. They had a well, they had a wine press. Very, very neat place. But there's a a precipice out from where the synagogue was, a real steep place with rocks and brambles and all types of things like that. Now, this is the way the service ended. And they all in the synagogue when they heard these things were filled with wrath and rose up and thrust him out of the city and led him unto the brow of the hill where on their city was built. So Nazareth's up in a little high place and then they lead him out to that brow and it's straight down like this that they might cast him down headlong. I wonder if Jesus ever went back to church after they throwed him out. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; He actually did. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, he's used to getting thrown out. &gt;&gt; And you know what Jesus does, unlike us? Jesus keeps on going back. Now, I want to ask every one of us here today, if any of us would have been treated like this, &gt;&gt; would we have ever went back to church again? &gt;&gt; Or you say, "I never would." See, that shows you're lacking &gt;&gt; that portion of God in your life &gt;&gt; because Jesus went back. Amen. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, Jesus has kept going back &gt;&gt; for over 2,000 years since this happened. &gt;&gt; The churches are still throwing him out. &gt;&gt; He's been invited all over the Tri Cities this morning. &gt;&gt; No doubt churches everywhere, every denomination that there is here, every independent church. No doubt they w they invited him to come. But then do they welcome him once he shows up. &gt;&gt; Now you see there's a difference in us standing and somebody will come and pray, "Oh Lord, we invite you to this service. Please come Lord Jesus." And then would we turn him loose to have his will in the service. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now notice this is what Jesus does. It wasn't his time yet. So the scripture says, "But he passing through the midst of them went his way." Now the Lord Jesus instead of getting this attitude toward church and saying, "You know what? I ain't never going back again. I ain't never going back to church. Are you kidding me? I'd go there to help them and they'd lead me up to the brow there and they're going to throw me over and they would have done it had it been time, but it just wasn't time. But instead of Jesus getting burned out on church and I'm so sick and tired of preachers, I'm so fed up with lay people. I'm I'm just fed up with the whole church thing. Jesus is still going to churches where he's not even welcome. &gt;&gt; Jesus this day on Sunday has visited with his presence thousands times, thousands of churches, right? And how many of them let him have his way? &gt;&gt; I guess the question is, will we? &gt;&gt; Is Jesus free in Word of Life Church today to have his will or do we want to put him in a box and say, "Now, Lord, you can't do this, but you can do that, but you can't do this, and you can't do that." &gt;&gt; Oh my. Notice this in the sermon that the prophet entitled Pride Campbellville, Kentucky. Some of you were there with me at this setting uh several years ago when brother Charlie Cox had some meetings there and they had a tent set up when brother Random was there. It was a Methodist campground. Sister Nelly uh the Lord dealt with her that service and she gave her heart to God after this service right here. Jesus unnoticed. Jesus with dirty feet made a gazing stock after being invited. Now, you know, to me, it would be awful if people just said, "Look, you know what, Lord? We're having this thing called the church, but we're not even going to invite you, okay? We hear that you're a miracle worker. We hear that you'll make people shout sometimes, and we hear that you'll make them cry, and we hear you'll make them do all sorts of things." and we really don't want that in our place. So, we're not even going to invite you. Okay? Just stay out of our assembly. But the sad part about it is they say he's welcome, but if he come in and started doing any of the above things I just lift listed, they wouldn't want him back anymore. &gt;&gt; So, they invite him, but he's not welcome. Can you imagine how rude that would be to be treated in such a way that someone here in the church or a family member or friend of yours would invite you for supper. &gt;&gt; You walk in the door, you smell it, there's the bread, there's the meat, you can smell the potatoes, the carrots, this or that. And they they let you in and they don't speak to you after that. They tell you, "Sit down right there." them and their family goes to the table. They go to start eating and that aroma is filling your their house and you and your family are sitting in the living room looking at one another and trying to figure out what what what is happening. We thought that we were welcome here. No, you were invited, but you wasn't really welcome. &gt;&gt; So, they sat there and eat and talk about how good it is. past the butter and past the carrots and and past the mashed potatoes and gravy and oh, this is so good. They never acknowledge you. They never look at you. How long would you all stay? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You going to stay for dessert? Not that you're going to get any, but you're going to let them eat it in front of you and your children. Now you all are hungry and you haven't eaten for [clears throat] a while and you saw you thought that you was going to be part of this. So Jesus come to the service here today. He's hoping to be a part of this service. He's wanting to be the object of our worship, &gt;&gt; the main reason that we come here, &gt;&gt; not to see one another. That's well and good, but that's not the reason we're here. &gt;&gt; It's to worship him. &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Notice the way the prophet lays this out. I wonder when you have a prayer meeting and you invite him to your church and then he comes down to do something for you and you just let him be unentertained. Too much of that in our home life and everywhere. When the president comes, why am I? They throw out the carpet all the way from the train all the way into the hotel. They they stroll the streets and young ladies will go forth for flowers and the bouquet the sidewalks and hang down the flags and every sign of welcome. But when Jesus comes to to town, he has to stay in a little mission somewhere. He'll be called crazy holy roller Jesus with dirty feet. There he sits unentertained, unwashed, unwelcomed. And you say, "Jesus, do you take a lesser place? Jesus, do you take a little bitty place when you're called in a home?" Yes, I take that little place. What? the little room in the upstairs or perhaps maybe on the second floor or the little closet or down in the basement. You're ashamed of him before the celebrity, before your company. You're afraid or ashamed to testify of him, to tell of his saving grace. May God help us. Amen. &gt;&gt; But will you come anyhow, Jesus? Yeah, I will come anyhow. That proves to me he's the Lord of Lords. He's a big person. &gt;&gt; I'll come anyhow, no matter just how little of a place you will make for me. Don't you understand? That's the way he'll do in our service. &gt;&gt; That's the way he'll do in our life. &gt;&gt; So he allocates so much time for our life on the earth. And he wants to give us our life and our time and not not make us a robot to where that he programs us and we go here and we do there and we we pray and we read our Bible and then but he wants to give us time and then give us choice and wants us to choose in the right balance of work and pleasure and all of that and him. This is why he ends up shortch changed so much because of our own choice. and we go here and we do that and we do this and do that and the other and we give Jesus this little tiny bit in our life &gt;&gt; and Jesus will take it and hug it up as it were so close to him &gt;&gt; and look back at you and say, "Thank you. Thank you for that 30 minutes that you gave me. I really do appreciate it cuz I love spending time with you. &gt;&gt; I love hearing you talk to me. I love hear you singing to me. I love hearing you testify to me. Thank you. No matter how little of a place you'll make for me, I'll come anyhow. I like that. He's my Lord and I will come anyhow. No matter how little the place is, I will come. Though you give the president everything, you give Dr. Jones, a great spread. But when Jesus comes, he takes a corner somewhere. What a bunch of Pharisees. Put on entertainers. No love entertainers. I will take that place. You know the prophet said, "One of the greatest privileges that you and I have been given in our life is to entertain Jesus Christ." Now, y'all should be able to say amen to that cuz most human beings love either one form or another of entertainment. &gt;&gt; Now, whether it's reading, whether it's your phone, whether it's movies, whether it's music, whatever sports, everybody has some for form of entertainment. To some, it's Instagram, it's this and that and the other. It's cooking, it's, you know, whatever it is. Is it wrong? No, not necessarily. A lot of entertainment does not. It's not sin of itself, but it's sin into what we make it into in our lives. &gt;&gt; And then the only entertainment that Jesus has has that he asks for is for us to entertain him. Actually, something angels cannot do. And God knows they would do a much better job than I could ever do. and they would be so honored to do it. But yet Jesus has allowed so much entertainment to himself, to the church, and if we don't do it, it don't get done. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Revelation 3 20. One of the saddest scriptures in the Bible. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. And if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him and will s. And the word there, s is short for supper. I will have supper with him. You see, this is where we are. Jesus didn't say breakfast. &gt;&gt; Why? This verse of scripture applies to the last day. It's supper time. &gt;&gt; Jesus ain't offering you breakfast. He ain't offering you lunch. You're in the supper time, the end time. &gt;&gt; And Jesus is wanting to have supper with all of us. I will come into him and we'll have supper with him and he with me. Now listen how the prophet picks this up and he says in this led us to sin church age it was the most messed up church age of all the rest of them. The most messed up of all the rest of them. And we found the most pathetic thing in the last part of the Leodysian church age. Notice not at the beginning at the last part of the Leodysian church age. Jesus standing on the outside of his own church where he had been put out knocking at the door trying to get back in. And you're talking about a sad situation. If I'm going somewhere and I'm going to be gone out preaching somewhere and I'm gone for a few days and I come back and I come over to the church and I'm gonna go in the office here and my key won't work. So I come around to that door and it won't work. Now I've got a master key. So it unlocks every door in here. But all of a sudden I find out my key won't let me in. No doors. I go to the main entrance won't let me in. I go to the handicap entrance, won't let me there. I go to the deacon store in the back, won't let me there. I go over here to the fellowship hall. I can't even get in anywhere. So, it's on Monday morning, 9:00. I call brother Jackie, brother Michael. Neither one of them will answer my phone calls. I text them. They won't even respond. And I'm thinking, what in the world? Did they have an election while I was gone? Yes. &gt;&gt; Have they changed the locks on the door? Now, wouldn't that be sad to say, "Oh, you're no longer welcome here. Really? What have I done?" &gt;&gt; What have I done to you all? Now, that would be heartbreaking for me as a man. But what is that in comparison to the Lord Jesus? So, HE TRIES HIS LAW. HE TRIES HIS KEY, it won't work. He tries mercy, that won't work. He tries grace, that won't work. He tries joy, tries deliverance, tries healing, none of it. Well, there they say, "No, no, no. We want your name and we want your city and we do not want to go to hell and we've gone, you've gone to prepare a place for us and we want that, but we don't want you being the boss of our lives." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So, if that's the way it is, we're changing the locks on our church door. Jesus. &gt;&gt; I wonder children, have we done that in our lives? NOTICE THIS JESUS ON THE OUTSIDE OF HIS own church where he'd been put out. Not at the beginning of the leis church age, brother Paul, but at the very end where we are. Do you understand? This is going to be part of the consummation of the judgment of God that the churches will put Jesus out. &gt;&gt; You said amen to that. But let me go a little bit farther. And it ain't going to be limited just to denominational churches either. &gt;&gt; Message churches are going to do the same. &gt;&gt; Not all of them. Notice he said trying to get back in. Isn't that sinful? I think that's about one of the most pathetic scriptures I've ever read. Jesus outside of his own door and his church had put him out. His church had put him out and he was trying to get back in. You imagine knocking, let me in, please, church. I'm the one who bought you. I'm the ONE WHO SAVED YOU. I'M THE ONE THAT DELIVERED YOU FROM A LIFE OF sin and of hell and debauchery and darkness and filth and all that. Let Let me please. Will anybody let ME BACK IN? WHAT ABOUT WORD OF LIFE? CAN I COME IN THERE? WORD OF LIFE CHURCH. CAN I COME IN ON WEDNESDAY? CAN I come in in THE YOUTH SERVICE? CAN I COME IN ON SUNDAY? CAN I COME IN? Y'ALL GOING TO MAKE ME STAND OUT HERE AND LAY ON THE SEA WHERE THEY HATE ME AND THEY DESPISE MY NAME AND THEY RIDICULE ME AND THEY MAKE FUN OF MY WORD. Won't anybody give me a shelter? &gt;&gt; I will. Lord, if any man that will open and let me back in my own house. How would you brothers feel if you come in from work tomorrow and your wife change the locks? You push your garage door and it no longer works. You go in the basement door and you can't get in there. You try the front door. You try the back door. And finally her and your children meet you at the door and say, "We don't want you here no more. You're not welcome." Would you keep on knocking, brothers? Would you keep on trying? Do we want to be godly or not? &gt;&gt; You see, WHEN JESUS GETS turned down and put out, what does he do? He keeps coming back. I'll tell you one thing. If we had more people around this message that had that determination, the devil couldn't run you off. The preacher couldn't run you off, the deacons couldn't run you off, there ain't nobody going to run you off and run you away from the presence of God. But if you're a little BABY AND YOU'VE GOT TO BE PETTED AND YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A BOTTLE AND YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A PACIFIER AND YOU WANT A PREACHER to change your stinking diaper and you want a preacher to baby you and make over you all the time, I'm afraid you're at the wrong place. God ain't looking for a bunch of babies. He's looking for an army. IT'S NOT AN ARMY OF BABIES AND INFANTS, but an army of God. Oh my, let me back in my own house. I'll suck with him. And he with me. And then the prophet said, "Isn't that pathetic? THE GOD OF HEAVEN PUT OUT OF HIS OWN CHURCH BY their creeds and denominations and the way that they're doing put them put him out of the church and accepted their creed." Again, it said Jesus Christ has been put out of his own church and standing knocking at the door trying to get back in and richness and pleasures of the world has drove him from the church until the church has become a lukewarm. It's a very pathetic picture of all the other churches in the church ages. And you know what's the amazing thing about it is Jesus still goes to church and HE'LL BE THERE. YOU KNOW WHAT I'm convinced this morning? If there were people that have already said their creeds and their dogmas and they've made Jesus not the person of the Godhead but the second one and they've took this from him and that from him and that from him. But no doubt he visited some of these churches around the Tri Cities area today and there may have been somebody that got saved. &gt;&gt; All right. Oh, you say you mean they CAN GET SAVED? YES. THAT'S how much Jesus wants to visit people who have turned him down. How much more than will he visit those of us who want him here and all of his greatness and all of his power and all of his mercy. Oh my. I HOPE AND PRAY TO GOD THAT OUR church never ever gets to a spot to where we say, "Jesus, your miracles aren't welcome." Well, as long as I'm in the pastor, this is going to be our stand. Jesus healing is welcome here. JESUS MIRACLES ARE WELCOME HERE. JESUS DELIVERING THE LOST, IT'S WELCOME HERE. JESUS FILLING WITH THE HOLY GHOST, IT'S WELCOME HERE. Is that right, church? [applause] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He can't heal. He can't deliver. He can't tell them how to dress. He can't tell them what he demands of them because they don't want to hear it. So this you leave that alone. This is our private lives and you stay out of my private life. Oh my. BUT YOU SEE A LOT OF MESSAGE PEOPLE, they don't invite him to their church because they don't believe in going to church. &gt;&gt; So they don't invite him. As a matter of fact, they are guilty of abandoning him. &gt;&gt; They don't invite him. And you know the sad part about it is they take the message of the hour, this precious message, and try to prove their false doctrine &gt;&gt; by the very message of God that's restored the hearts of the children of God in the last days. Are you talking about something that you're going to try to take the message of the hour and use the message to disprove scripture? &gt;&gt; Forsake not the assembling of yourselves together as a manner of some is &gt;&gt; and the church said &gt;&gt; now let's look at let's look at David. So to be godly a person a person should have a desire to go to the house of God. Now I'm convinced friends that a lot of the message people have either lost or never had the respect for the house of God. And they're raising a if if time goes on for this younger generation in the way that many message people are teaching their children about church, it won't be but a few more years they will ridicule it and laugh at it. Some are already doing it now. AND WHAT IS THAT MISSING? THE sacredness of what it means to come to the house of God. Notice in Psalms 5:7, "But as for me, I will come into thy house, in the multitude of thy mercy, and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple." Now remember, there was not even a solid structure in the days of David when he said that. It was a tent. &gt;&gt; A TENT. But David knew there was something that God had a house. And he said, "I will come in." He could never even enter in behind the veil and go into the Holy of Holies. He was only allowed in the outer court. But he recognized being there was so sacred and so holy and so righteous. Listen as he goes on in Psalms 26:8. Lord, I have loved the hab the habitation of thy house and the place where thine honor dwellest. 654 Blessed is the man whom thou chooses and cause us to approach UNTO THEE, THAT HE MAY DWELL IN THY COURTS, NOT EVEN IN THE Holy of Holies, but a person that would be allowed to dwell in the courts of God. IN THY COURTS, WE SHALL BE SATISFIED WITH the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple. PSALM 66:13, I WILL GO INTO THY HOUSE WITH BURNT OFFERINGS. I will pay thee my vows. Psalms 84:1. TO THE CHIEF MUSICIAN UPON GATIS, a psalm for the SONS OF KORA. HOW AMIABLE, HOW amiable are thy tabernacles, oh Lord of hosts. Now remember he make uses the word in plural form tabernacles because there was three dimensions or three spheres of the tabernacle. How amiable are thy tabernacles. Look in Hebrews 9:2. For there was a tabernacle made, the first wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the sheerbread, which is called the sanctuary. And after the second veil, the tabernacle, so plural tabernacles in plural form, which is called the holiest OF ALL, WHICH HAD THE GOLDEN SENSOR, and the ark of the covenant overlaid roundabout with gold. Look, and you talking about David THOUGHT THIS WAS SO HOLY AND SO GODLY and so righteous and it was just things. [snorts] BUT IT WAS THINGS THAT HAD BEEN CONSECRATED TO GOD. And it WAS THINGS THAT GOD SAID, "I WANT this and I want that and I want that." And David knew they were there, ALTHOUGH HE NEVER GOT TO SEE THEM. HIS EYES COULD NEVER BEHOLD THEM. BUT HE SAID THIS IS THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD'S WORD AND IT IS SO HOLY. IT IS SO SACRED. I wonder children when we come to the house of God have we who even believe in going to church lost some of our sacredness and respect for the place that has been dedicated to God. Notice in verse 5, and over the cherubams of glory shadowing the mercy seat of which we cannot now speak particularly. PSALMS 84:2, MY SOUL LONGETH. YEAH. YAY. Even faintth. MY SOUL LONGETH. Even faintest. The word here means to PALE OR TO BE FAINT or weak. to pine after, TO LONG FOR, TO [screaming] DESIRE EARNESTLY. MY SOUL LONGS. YOU MEAN HE HE WANTED JUST TO GET UP TO THE TABERNACLE? &gt;&gt; And he FELT LIKE HE WAS GOING TO PASS OUT IF he didn't get to go to church. &gt;&gt; He was pining. HE WAS SAD. HE FELT LIKE I I'M GOING TO PASS OUT. I'M GOING TO PASS OUT. OH NO. OH NO. WHAT IS IT, DAVID? YOU AIN'T EAT. WHAT IS IT, DAVID? YOUR HIGH BLOOD. YOUR LOW BLOOD. NO. [screaming] NO. NO. I CAN'T GO TO CHURCH. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine if David would have been allowed to live in Johnson City in 2025? And this was David's home church. The deacons every service would have to set him down. He would be harping and jumping and shouting and running. And if they put HIM ON THE OUTSIDE, HE'D been running ON THE OUTSIDE. CAN YOU IMAGINE A MAN WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST THAT LOVE just to go and see a tent &gt;&gt; to SEE A TENT &gt;&gt; AND KNOW THAT THERE WAS OTHER THINGS THERE BUT JUST TO BE THERE BECAUSE HE SENT YOU UNDERSTAND [screaming] MANY MESSAGE PEOPLE THEY'RE NOT GOD CONSCIOUS THIS IS WHAT DAVID [screaming] had &gt;&gt; he could sense God there This word that David used expresses such a longing or desire to make one faint or exhausted with intent desire. And he said, "I'm going to pass out. &gt;&gt; [panting] &gt;&gt; David. King David. WHAT? WHAT IS IT? WHAT IS IT? I want to go to church so bad. I'm going to pass out if I don't get to church. Can't you see why Satan don't want you to go? &gt;&gt; HE WON'T FIGHT YOU ABOUT GOING TO WALMART LIKE THAT. &gt;&gt; HE WON'T FIGHT YOU ABOUT GOING TO WORK LIKE THAT. COME ON, SOMEBODY. OH MY. [screaming] BUT TO GET IN GOD'S PRESENCE, TO GET IN THE HOUSE OF GOD, WHAT WOULD IT BE? WORD OF LIFE. IF EACH ONE OF US HAD SUCH A DESIRE AND ANTICIPATION TO COME TO THE HOUSE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Oh my. [applause] Oh, I'm so exhausted. I'm about to faint. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; If I can't go TO CHURCH, MY SOUL LONGER, YAY, FAINTEST FOR THE COURTS OF THE LORD. MY HEART AND MY flesh cry us out &gt;&gt; for the living God. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, OUR WHOLE nature is benefited when we come to the house of God. &gt;&gt; Your flesh will benefit, your spirit will benefit, and your soul DEFINITELY WILL BENEFIT. NOTICE DAVID, BUT JUST AN OLD TESTAMENT PERSPECTIVE. IT BENEFITED HIS SOUL. IT BENEFITED HIS FLESH. &gt;&gt; OUR WHOLE NATURE demands the fellowship of almighty God. &gt;&gt; BODY AND SOUL AND SPIRIT, we are made for the service of our king. &gt;&gt; Oh, he wants your soul. He wants your spirit. But he also wants your hands. He wants you to lift up holy hands before the Lord. He wants your VOCAL CORDS. AMEN. SHOUT WITH A VOICE OF TRIUMPH. IS THAT RIGHT? HE WANTS YOUR FEET. SOMETIMES PATTING THEM. PRAISE GOD. SOMETIMES DANCING THEM. HE WANTS YOUR SPIRIT, SOUL, AND BODY. &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL'S CHILDREN GET GIVE ALL theirs &gt;&gt; to the devil. Why should not we give all of ours to God? Amen. &gt;&gt; NOTICE HE SAID, "MY HEART AND MY FLESH CRITH out the cry of earnest longing and desire for the living God, not an idol. That's what I cry for, the living God." I don't want to just stand here and say for the rest of my life, where is the Lord God of Brother Random? &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. I don't want Where's the Lord God? Where's the Lord God of Paul? Where's the Lord God? I want to be able to say it like this. The Lord God is here. His presence is here. He's doing the same things he's always done. &gt;&gt; That's the living God I crave for. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Psalms 84:4, blessed are they that dwell in thy house. They will still be praising thee. Silah. Verse 10. FOR A DAY IN THY courts is better than a thousand. I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God to dwell in tents of wickedness. JUST A DOORKEEPER. SOMEBODY THAT COME TO CHURCH AND SWEEP THE LEAVES OUT FROM THE DOOR AND SEE CHEWING GUM PAPERS OUT ON THE PARKING LOT, YOU KNOW, JUST PICK UP THIS AND SAY, "OH MY, IT'S SUCH AN HONOR. I'M SO GLAD TO BE THE TRASH BOY. I'M SO GLAD TO BE THE LEAF BLOWING CHURCH BECAUSE GOD'S HOLY PRESENCE, THIS IS A PLACE CONSECRATED to the presence OF GOD. AND AS LONG AS THE BRIDE'S HERE AND WE NEED IT, HIS PRESENCE WILL ALWAYS BE HERE, FRIENDS. OH YEAH. OH, IT CAN BE IN MY HOME, TOO. IT CAN BE IN YOUR HOME. YES. BUT IT'S NOT the same. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Psalms 122 verse1, a song of degrees of David. I was so sad and I was so troubled and I was so disappointed. I was glad when they said unto me, "Let us go into the house of the Lord," &gt;&gt; which was a tent in that day. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine David being able to walk in here and the brothers up here on their musical instruments and singing and you all clapping [applause] your hands and worshiping God? And as soon as David entered in, he sensed that presence of God. Oh my, what in the world would David done? You talking about a dancing little David? If David could dance under the law, what could he do under grace? I wish somebody would preach with me this morning. BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE OF US that love the Lord Jesus? Hey, I don't believe David loved him any more than SOME OF YOU RIGHT HERE TODAY. I BELIEVE WHAT WE need is an awakening in our walk with God and a REALITY WHEN WE COME TOGETHER. HOW SACRED, HOW HOLY, HOW PRIVILEGED WE ARE AS A PEOPLE OF GOD THAT WE CAN COME TOGETHER AND SAY, "YES, LORD, MOVE AMONG YOUR PEOPLE. THEY'RE SICK HERE TODAY. GOD, HEAL THEM. THERE'S LOST HERE TODAY. SAVE THEM. PEOPLE NEED THE HOLY GHOST. FILL THEM, LORD. Oh my. But I want you to think, friends, now watch the prophet. I I've I've I've looked at this message right here through the years. I couldn't tell you how many times that I've studied it and looked at it, but somehow another, I've totally missed this quote. I'm fixing to read you. AND STANDING HERE AT THIS BIBLE on the sacred desk. Now listen, sacred desk. Now show me where brother Ram said your kitchen table was sacred &gt;&gt; or your coffee table or your end table where your MP3 player lays. &gt;&gt; Come on. Now, if you're going to make him the voice of God and say what is it said, either you take this the same way as that, or you're a filthy hypocrite, &gt;&gt; preach, brother Donnie, &gt;&gt; STANDING HERE WITH THIS BIBLE ON THE SACRED DESK, THE PULL PIT, THE CLOSEST PLACE TO heaven on the earth. So you mean a pulpit where men of God come and stand and preach the WORD IS THE CLOSEST place to heaven on earth and then people don't want to go and be around that place the closest place to heaven on earth. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. I TELL YOU, IT SHOULDN'T JUST AFFECT the leoty, but it should affect the ministry as well. &gt;&gt; TO REALIZE WHEN A PREACHER WALKS UP BEHIND THIS PLACE OR WHEREVER it is that HE'S PREACHING. OH MAN, WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN A BUNCH OF IDEOLOGIES. WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN A BUNCH of I this and I've done that and I've DONE SOMETHING ELSE. BRING US JESUS, BROTHER. DON'T BRING YOUR AGENDA. DON'T BRING YOUR THIS, THAT, AND THE OTHER. I GET SO SICK AND TIRED OF PREACHERS AND USING THE PULLPIT as a PLACE TO GET BACK AT PEOPLE AND GET BACK AT ONE ANOTHER. THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. IT'S TO BRING JESUS CHRIST TO THE CHILDREN OF GOD. IT'S TO LET THE PEOPLE SEE JESUS IS NOT DEAD. [screaming] HE'S [laughter] ALIVE. [applause] I wonder if the message ministers wouldn't be more sincere themselves and respect this holy place more if it wouldn't bring right on out to the leoty. Think about what a statement AS I STAND YOU with this Bible on the sacred desk. Check it out. Study it sometime and he gets times he uses this terms over and over again. SACRED DESK, THE PULPIT, THE CLOSEST PLACE TO HEAVEN ON EARTH. WOW. Listen to this. In the supernatural, many times defining our own ranks of Pentecost. Sometimes our atmosphere becomes an emotion instead of a worship and THAT SOON DIES out and the members become one thing and another. But if we could ever get a group of people &gt;&gt; together WHERE WAS GENUINE HOLY SPIRIT ATMOSPHERE, A sacredness and a sincerity and worship men and women, hallelujah, SITTING IN THERE ARE GOD CONSCIOUS. Now notice the word that HE USES GOD CONSCIENCE. NOT YOUR HUMAN CONSCIENCE BUT GOD CONSCIENCE. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU RECOGNIZE GOD is there. Oh my. SITTING IN THERE OUR GOD CONSCIENCE AND KNOW THAT THE GREAT OMNIPOTENT [screaming] GOD is present ready to do all things without one shadow of a doubt and even HAVE AN EFFECT UPON THE UNBELIEVERS ARE SETTING in this evening. YOU CAN NEVER COME INTO THAT GLORY TO GOD ATMOSPHERE WITHOUT SOMETHING HAPPENING. &gt;&gt; How many knows that's the truth by experience? &gt;&gt; Now watch this. THIS IS A dedication of a church of a brother down in Cleveland, Tennessee in 1959. And we know that the church, the spirit of God is in the people that makes the church. But we also have places, GATHERING PLACES DEDICATED WHERE THIS church body gathers together to worship God. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AH, YOU SEE THEN FOR THOSE WHO JUST MAKE IT THE SPIRITUAL PART, the mystical body, well, we are the body of Christ and we no longer need to meet together. That's not what he's saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And word of life said, &gt;&gt; AND GOD HAS GIVEN TO OUR PRECIOUS brethren and to this congregation this most beautiful structure. Therefore, we are here this morning FOR THAT PURPOSE TO DEDICATE IT TO BE A place of worship to the Lord our God. So, did brother Brandham look at church buildings as just any other building, any other type of building, or was there something special or sacred about a church, things that are to be my I felt honored tonight to come into a church like this, which if you don't know, it was an Assembly of God church. I ALWAYS FEEL BETTER in a church than I do in those auditoriums. Well, praise the Lord. My my there's nothing AGAINST THE AUDITORIUM, BUT YOU KNOW, maybe just a superstition. Seems like to me a truth. YOU GO INTO THOSE AUDITORIUMS WHERE THERE'S FIGHTS, RRESTLES, BURLESQUE, everything else going on. Evil spirits seem to hang around them places. NOW THAT MAY BE SEEM to be a superstition, but it isn't. SO, BUT WHEN YOU come into a church, YOU FOLKS READ YOUR BIBLE AT HOME, &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO TAPES AT HOME, READ THE MESSAGE AT HOME, PRAY AT HOME, TALK ABOUT THE LORD AT HOME. &gt;&gt; WELL, WHY CAN'T WE ALL JUST START STAYING HOME THEN? Because this part of the message tells us otherwise. &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT A PLACE THAT WE HAVE HALLOWED and set aside for worship. &gt;&gt; Notice the presence of God is there. You know, it seems to be different. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EFFECT THE BUILDING HAS. It's where the people are congregating. OF COURSE, THE SAME people are at the other place, but on those evil grounds. So, in y'all's homes, there's never any arguing, right? Never any fussing. Uh, testing one, two, one, two, testing one, two. So, IN YOUR HOME, IT'S TOTAL CONSECRATED TO GOD. Y'ALL JUST OFFERING sacrifices and praising God all day long and just worshiping and everything. There's &gt;&gt; ah, that could be one reason it feels different in church. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Can I go a little longer? &gt;&gt; Boy, it seems hot in here this morning. Man, a lot of I'm sweating like I don't know what. Is it just me? &gt;&gt; AND AS I SAID, BROTHER BRANDON talked to some preacher and he was talking about having a hard time getting his people to come to church. Said he had to get them to sign a card, you know, would they at least come on Easter and Christmas. AND I SAID, "YOU GET that bunch of lukewarm church members down to the altar and let them pray through till the Holy Ghost sets their soul of fire. There'll be no signing cards. GOD'S IN THEIR HEART. GOD [screaming] GOES TO CHURCH." &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW, CHILDREN. LET'S SAY WHAT THE TAPE SAY. LET'S PRESS [screaming] PLAY. AND WHEN THIS QUOTE IS SAID, LET'S ALL SAY AMEN. AND NOT LET'S NOT JUST SAY IT WITH OUR VOICE, BUT LET'S SAY IT WITH OUR FEET. LET OUR FEET TAKE US TO THE HOUSE OF GOD BECAUSE GOD GOES TO CHURCH. WOO! [cheering] [applause] My my but as I read this quote, I couldn't keep from wondering if we ain't got a lot of message folks like this brother had in his church. You get that bunch of lukewarm church members down to the altar, let them pray through till the Holy Ghost SETS THEIR SOUL OF FIRE. THERE'LL BE NO SIGNING CARDS. GOD'S IN THEIR HEART. GOD GOES TO CHURCH. HE LOVES TO WORSHIP. OH, COME ON, SOMEBODY. IF WE GET SO EXCITED ABOUT GOING ON A VACATION SOMEWHERE, WE GET EXCITED ABOUT GOING ON A GOLF TOUR OR GOING TO DOLLYWOOD, WHAT ABOUT COMING TO THE HOUSE OF GOD WHERE THE MIRACULOUS IS HERE, HEALING IS HERE, DELIVERANCE IS HERE. OH, WHAT IT COULD BE? GOD. [screaming] [applause] &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; SORRY, I'm gonna have to get rid of this thing. [sighs] &gt;&gt; What visions are we? We feel that every person &gt;&gt; rot shaggy IS DUTY [screaming] BOUND. to attend some church and belong to some church as a Christian. Many people say, "Oh, I stay home and read my Bible. I'm just as well off." No. The Bible said we shouldn't forsake to assemble ourselves together. WE'VE GOT TO DO THAT. THIS IS NOT A SUGGESTION. WELL, I THINK I THINK I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK. THIS IS WHAT THE MESSAGE TEACHES IN THE LAST DAY. I'M TALKING ABOUT BEING [screaming] LIKE GOD. GOD GOES TO CHURCH. GOD LOVES SINGING. GOD LOVES WORSHIP. OH, HALLELUJAH. AND IF YOU'RE LIKE [screaming] GOD, WHAT WILL YOU LOVE? [applause] We've got to do that. And I want somebody to present to me the quote or God's prophet said, "WE'VE GOT to play the tapes only. I'll wait for the quote, &gt;&gt; but until you send it to me, I'll keep on preaching what he said. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Notice that had a real move of God there at the tabernacle that morning, 1959. Brother Bam said, "I'm still feasting also on that blessing this morning on the exceeding abundantly." It's unknown. Lord have mercy. IT'S UNKNOWN THE THINGS THAT GOD WOULD DO FOR US WHEN we assemble ourselves together. Have you noticed since we made this consecration to God how the things has been going here? Now can you imagine the Brandham tabernacle may needed a reconsecration TO THE LORD. THE CHURCH OF THE PROPHET OF GOD NEEDED MORE CONSECRATION. AND ONCE THEY DEDICATED THEMSELVES, NOT JUST [screaming] HIM BUT THEM, GOD BE TO MOVE IN A GREATER WAY INSIDE THEIR CHURCH THAN IT DONE BEFORE. &gt;&gt; OH MY. BLESSING AFTER BLESSING, POWER AFTER POWER, GLORY AFTER GLORY. IT'S JUST BEEN WONDERFUL. and he will continue to do so. &gt;&gt; If you can't come here, get you a good church home somewhere where they really &gt;&gt; No, brother Brandon said go to a church where they preach. &gt;&gt; Help my time, as my grandma used TO SAY. HELP MY [screaming] TIME. You mean brother Brandon believed IN GOING TO CHURCH WHERE THEY PREACHED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WELL, THEY REALLY PREACHED THE GOSPEL AND SO YOU CAN BE FED BY THE SPIRIT of God. If y'all will get with me right here in a few minutes. Oh my. [sighs] Now listen to this one. after people got saved in Brother Brandham's meetings. Promise me that you'll find a good gospel church somewhere, a church that teaches the full gospel, the power of God, his resurrection. Join up with them people with and make yourself a church home. Don't stray around loose on the streets. Go get a good church somewhere of your choice where the gospel and the power of God is made known and the signs, oh hallelujah, of eternal life is in there. The signs that was in Christ and the church said, &gt;&gt; DISCERNMENT OF SPIRIT. EVERY MAN OUGHT TO HAVE A CHURCH HOME. YOU OUGHT TO HAVE A PLACE NOT JUST FLOAT ABOUT FROM PILLAR TO POST, BUT HAVE SOMEWHERE THAT YOU GO TO CHURCH AND CALL IT YOUR CHURCH. COME ON, SOMEBODY. LET'S PRESS PLAY AND OBEY. SOMEWHERE YOU PAY YOUR TITHE, SOMEWHERE THAT YOU HELP SUPPORT THE CAUSE. TAKE YOUR CHOICE. BUT THEN DON'T NEVER DYSFELLOWSHIP the other man because he don't belong WITH YOUR GROUP. GOD GOES TO CHURCH. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE SAY, "I CAN STAY AT [screaming] home &gt;&gt; then be just as good a Christian as I can at church." You can't. &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering] [applause] The Bible said, "Oh, so that was important to Brother Brandham." &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "Yeah, he was a a prophet of God." &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID, "NOT FOR SAKE OF ASSEMBLING OURSELVES TOGETHER THAT much more as we see the time coming." IF YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN, you long to go. where other Christians are and fellowship with OTHER CHRISTIANS. SO YOU CANNOT STAY AWAY FROM CHURCH AND LIVE THE SAME LIFE. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. HALLELUJAH. YOU CANNOT STAY AWAY FROM CHURCH AND LIVE THE SAME LIFE. I SEE WHY SATAN WANTS MESSAGE FOLKS TO STAY AWAY FROM CHURCH BECAUSE HE KNOWS THEY CAN'T BE AS GODLY. THEY CANNOT LIVE THE SAME KIND OF LIFE. THEY ARE LIVING A SELFISH LIFE. AMEN. BY NOT BRINGING THEIR STRENGTHS AND THEIR SUPPORT TO THE CAUSE OF GOD. I AIN'T TALKING ABOUT YOUR MONEY. I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU STANDING BEHIND THE GOSPEL OF THE LAST DAY. [applause] &gt;&gt; You cannot stay away from church and live THE SAME LIFE. YOU you can't do it because it's like I I'm hungry, but I'll never go to a table. I'll never eat. I AIN'T GOING TO do it. You've got to go and feed on the word of God &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; fellowship with one another. We need one another more now than we ever need each other. He said it's now. But when YOU GET YOURSELF SINGLED out from the rest of them, making yourself a little different, YOU DON'T WANT TO ASSOCIATE WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THIS AND YOU DON'T WANT TO ASSOCIATE WITH THAT. &gt;&gt; You're not the perfect bride. &gt;&gt; You're not the called out bride, but you're on dangerous ground. Can't you see where this move, friends, around this message is leading people? &gt;&gt; It's putting them on dangerous ground, not rapturing ground. &gt;&gt; You're on dangerous ground, right? Then keeping away from church. I EXPECT SOME FOLKS TO GET MAD AT ME. HEY, what's new about that, right? And they may make one of you may want to make a few YouTube videos about me and call my name and whatever or I don't really care. But I'll say to you and those of you who promote such, how is it going to be when you stand before God's prophet &gt;&gt; and him say to you, why did you not say what else I said? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHY DID YOU DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM GOING TO CHURCH? WHY DID YOU DISCOURAGE PEOPLE? LORD HAVE MERCY. WHAT A THING TO DO TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM GOING TO CHURCH. THAT'S WHAT THE DEVIL [screaming] DOES. &gt;&gt; THEN THAT PUTS YOU ON THE DEVIL'S side [sighs] years and years ago. I was preaching a camp down in Texas. I preached some things they didn't want me to preach. was about the Godhead and how great Jesus was. And I told him if there's another God in heaven, he's sitting on the floor. Cuz John looked in heaven, he saw only one throne and Jesus was on it. Ain't no three or four thrones ever with the Godhead sitting on top of it. Oh my. Preachers gathered in the back of the building, bigger building than this, gathered in the back of I seen them. I thought, "Oh boy, you've had her now." Sure enough, here they come to me after church said, "Hey, you can't preach that here." THE WHAT WHAT SHOCKED ME WAS THERE SUPPOSED TO BE PEOPLE. WONDNESS PEOPLE THAT SAID THEY BELIEVED IN THE GODHEAD. THEY RUN ME OUT OF THAT CAMP. THE SAD PART ABOUT IT WAS THE YOUTH OUT THERE WAVING GOODBYE AND CRYING LIKE BABIES. Oh my. And yeah MY BUT I'M SO GLAD FRIENDS THAT WHEN WE GET RUN [screaming] OUT THAT JESUS IS RIGHT THERE TO HELP US. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'D GO BACK BUT THEY NEVER WOULD LET ME COME BACK. BUT I TELL YOU ONE THING. AND IF YOU'RE IN THIS SPOT TODAY AND YOU SAY, "LORD, I'VE NOT HAD THE RIGHT ATTITUDE, BUT I'M INVITING YOU BACK, JESUS. I'M INVITING YOU BACK, JESUS. I'M SORRY." COME ON, SOMEBODY. WHY DIDN'T I QUIT GOING TO CHURCH? BECAUSE I WAS ORDAINED TO GO TO CHURCH. I WAS ORDAINED TO PREACH. I WAS ORDAINED TO NOT COME TO CHURCH AND SIT THERE LIKE A BUMP ON A PICKLE. I'M ORDAINED TO CLAP MY HANDS. I'M ORDAINED TO PRAISE GOD. I'M ORDAINED TO WORSHIP HIM. THAT'S WHAT I WAS BORN FOR. I WAS ORDAINED TO [screaming] TORMENT HELL. I WAS ORDAINED TO CAST OUT DEVILS. What about you? [applause] [sighs] [gasps] Some of the deacon brothers might want to meet with sister Carol after church and she's see if she's putting gunpowder in my Sunday morning breakfast. You're getting on dangerous ground right then, keeping away from church. Find the one of your choice and remain there and be a Christian. Brother, to all of them, that's the way to be a real Christian. So what does that make people who actually teach against this? Then we've got fellowship. I love this other word, protection. &gt;&gt; People love you and pray for you. &gt;&gt; Can I have you a few more minutes? The Holy Spirit in you will not hunger for the world. It'll hunger for God. If it's hard for you to go to church and press yourself to come and the church is open, there's something wrong with that spirit. &gt;&gt; Wow. This is the issue, friends. &gt;&gt; This is the problem. So, if it's hard for you to go to church and press yourself to come when the church is open, there's something wrong with that spirit. It's notice it it's trying to keep you away from God. The spirit OF GOD WILL RUN YOU right straight to the church every time the door opens for fellowship. &gt;&gt; Well, tell me what kind of spirit is on people that runs them away from church and they look for every excuse. I got a backachche. I got a headache. I got a toeache. But it's amazing TO ME THE MIRACULOUS happens as soon as church IS OVER AND YOU RUN INTO THEM AT WALMART ON Sunday evening. &gt;&gt; What cures take place when the amen is said and people say, "Honey, I feel better. Let's go to Red Lobster. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Can people be sick and can't come to church? Sure. &gt;&gt; But do those same same people that are so sick they can't go here, do they not go to Walmart? Do they not go to Target? Do they not go to TJ Maxx and go here and there and there? &gt;&gt; Uhoh. Uhoh. Preach, Brother Donnie. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Let me close. Our heavenly father, thou has chosen that we should gather together. It's the will of God. I don't care what revelation you have or what man is teaching you otherwise. If they don't say what the law and the prophet said, they are liars. &gt;&gt; It's the will of God that we should assemble ourselves together as we see the day approaching and that regularly, Lord, to bring ourselves closer to you and closer to each other in the bond of fellowship. through the shed blood of Jesus, which makes it possible. You see, so you're not just coming for yourself, but you're coming for others. &gt;&gt; Again, he says, "And be not afraid, it is I." We're taught that as the day begins to approach to the end, that we should not forsake the assembling of ourselves together as some who [snorts] have not the faith. Wow. &gt;&gt; Now, what I don't understand is I I I guess I guess probably I must have got the infabase that had all these going to church quotes in it. &gt;&gt; And then a lot of other people, they got a different infabase. Maybe that word, you know, whenever they type in these exact words that I typed in yesterday, gather ourselves together, quotation marks and here it just pulls right up right there in the message. &gt;&gt; Wow. And these are not AI generated. &gt;&gt; Although it wouldn't surprise me in the near future if we don't get some that are generated that says we shouldn't go. Come on. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But remember, anything we make the prophet of God say that's contrary to scripture is false doctrine. And we make him a liar. &gt;&gt; Come on. Word of life. God's prophet never come to lead us away from the Bible, but lead us right back to the Bible. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let's stand together. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Is your life worthy of the gospel? We have assembled together, Father, for no other purpose but to try to learn how to live better and to live closer to you. For we see the day approaching, and we &gt;&gt; must assemble ourselves together. oft and take instructions from you. Grant it, Father, in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Donnie, every time I come into church, I don't always get something. Jesus could relate to that. And the Lord God said to so and so, and so and so begat so and so and so be go begat so and so. Some of y'all go to sleep on me and I preach like a firecracker lit on both ends. I can't imagine if you had been in the synagogue, you just stretched out [laughter] so and so begat so and so and he begat so and so and they begat so and so and they went this many perimeters this way and done that and they done that and what do you say? Glory to God. What do you say? &gt;&gt; I love this one. Christ's a mystery. Now you've got tapes on that. You've got tapes on what we believe &gt;&gt; and you've got tapes on discipline &gt;&gt; in the church. I wonder why they ain't hearing them. Wonder why some of you ain't hearing them. &gt;&gt; You come once every two or three weeks, &gt;&gt; way out of church, stay home your sorry hide on Wednesday night when you could come to church. &gt;&gt; Preach it now. Streaming ain't meant to discourage people from going to church. &gt;&gt; It's to help the envalid, the those that wants to stream where else. Oh, but brother Donnie, I've got a slight little pain. Does that stop you from going on your sister's trip? &gt;&gt; I've got a slight little headache. Oh, does that stop you from going on a hunting trip or a golfing tour, some of you brothers, or do you take a little Tylenol in Jesus name and go ahead and pack YOUR BAGS? &gt;&gt; WOO! IF YOU GO ON A GOLFING TOUR WITH A HEADACHE, that shouldn't hinder you from coming to the house of God. And if YOU AIN'T GOT TYLENOL, LET ME KNOW. I'LL BUY YOU SOME. [applause] Lord have mercy. You going to get me killed one of these days. &gt;&gt; You've got tapes on discipline in the church. HOW WE BEHAVE OURSELF IN THE CHURCH of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. how we got to come together. So, we got tapes on that of how we got to come together and set TOGETHER IN HEAVENLY PLACES. DON'T STAY HOME. &gt;&gt; NOW, here's this massive gigantic twolettered word if. If God is in your heart, you can't hardly wait for them doors to open up yonder, to get in here to fellowship with your brothers, which is going to be pretty hard for you to do if you don't believe in going to church &gt;&gt; because they're in their home and you're in your home and you're in your home and you're all streaming from one location. That's kind of tough. Y'all do remember the COVID days, right? &gt;&gt; I didn't JUST MISS COMING TO CHURCH. I missed you all. &gt;&gt; Y'all might not have missed me, but I missed you. And I'm We miss one another, right? &gt;&gt; I'M AFRAID A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE GOT THAT LONGLASTED COVID EFFECTS. They still don't want to get together, but I believe Jesus is here to deliver the postcoavid effects where you SAY, "OH LORD, I NEED TO GO TO CHURCH. I NEED TO BE WITH MY BROTHERS AND SISTER. I NEED TO WORSHIP. I NEED TO BE THERE AS A STRENGTH. &gt;&gt; I don't mind telling you friends, this this puzzles me to no end. How people nearly make him God &gt;&gt; and say it's God talking on tapes and it's the literal VOICE OF GOD AND GOD HIMSELF. How can you say that &gt;&gt; and then read a statement like this? Don't stay home. If God is in your heart, you can't hardly wait for them doors to open yonder and to get into fellowship with your brothers. And if you don't feel that way, then I tell you, it's time you got to praying &gt;&gt; cuz we're in the last days. And the Bible exhorted us to much more as we see the day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and love one another. This will all men know that you are my disciples when you have love one for another. That's right. Stay right together. Token and shreport. We should love one another more than we ever did in all of our lives. There should be such a hunger to get to church. There should be such a hunger for us to get to one another. &gt;&gt; It should be a love affair. Who is Jesus and Topicus? We should assemble ourselves together. The Bible tells us that as we see the end approaching, not forsaking this of ourselves together, it'll it'll not only do that, it'll strengthen you &gt;&gt; and you your strength will strengthen the church. &gt;&gt; Can't you see what a selfish life that people live that see no need in attending a place of worship? They are robbers and they're being robbed. &gt;&gt; They're being robbed of our strength and they're robbing us of their strength. How can robbers go to heaven? I sure love y'all. &gt;&gt; Wish I had time. Go out and eat with all of you after church. I know everyone want to buy my dinner. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's bow our heads together. [sighs] Dear Jesus, what a serious hour, Lord. When Paul wrote it so many years ago in the time when the Christians were being killed and to be caught going to church could cost them their life, maybe their wife, their children, unborn babies. So they started kind of pulling back from church a little bit. And Paul felt led to write to them and tell them, "I know it's hard times and I know it's scary and it's fearful, but forsake not the assembling of yourselves together." I'm so glad that he took that opportunity because it's not said like that anywhere else in the entire New Testament. And what a background for it to be written under. people that were losing their life because they were identified as being Christians. And we know that public worship has always been something that you have wanted from the very garden of Eden. Abraham under his oak at memory. Jacob at man. There's something about public worship. You've never wanted your church to be in secret. Lord, it just breaks my heart, Father. As we see the days approaching and around the world in the ranks of the message, this move, it's dividing folks that have been friends for years, people leaving churches, just staying home. How sad. And the sad part about it is, Father, they try to use the very message that all these quotes I read from today come from that very message. and they try to use that very same message to prove we don't need church. Lord Jesus, thank you for your truth. Lord, I may not turn one person today. There'll probably some listen. They'll get mad and angry and all upset and whatever more. But father, even if one person that believes this false doctrine is never turned, I hope that the people here who believe in going to church will be more fired up about going than they've ever been in their entire life. I hope they have a greater desire and a greater determination to realize Lord Jesus this place where we are. Oh dear God, dedicated to your presence, dedicated as a place of worship and you've met with us so many times already, Lord, no longer than we've been here. Already the angels of God have been seen visibly in this place. Lord, I'll never forget it. Several years ago before we left Happy Valley after I'd preached one night and at the end of the service, I looked over to Harry to tell him what song to sing. And standing over by my office door said an angel, a man standing there, dark hair, white garments, looking straight at me. I felt totally paralyzed. I turned my head away because I was feeling so overcome by that presence. I couldn't hardly take it. And then I turned back and he was gone. That's the kind of church we want. That's the kind of place we want. It don't have to be fancy. Lord, if it was a storefront building and had plastered walls that had been repaired over and over again, but it was dedicated to you. It would be a special place. How many have we baptized once we've come here, Lord? How many have renewed their life to you, Lord? Oh, how many things you've done among us, and we're so thankful. Father, I pray that we will never lose the sacredness. I used to hate the years I was in Pentecost, Lord. I thought it was such a waste of my time. But as I look back, I realized there was some things that I gained back there that were true. And going to church and it being sacred and it being holy and a consecrated place. I'm so glad that I realized that years and years ago. And I'm so thankful, Father, that we know, Lord God, it's still the same today. Would you pass through us here this morning, Lord, the sick, the weary, may the angels of God that are standing at their post of duty. Hallelujah. May they minister strength, encouragement. We love you today, Jesus. We want to rededicate our lives to you, Father, in this place today. Oh Lord, take us, use us, Father. Take my hands, my mouth, Lord Jesus. My spirit, my soul, my body. I rededicate it. I reconsecrate it to you today. Lord, I pray for my musician brothers and sisters that play and the song leaders. I pray for the leoty. I pray for the brothers and the sound booths, the recording, the audio, the internet, all of that. Help us, Lord. I pray for the deacons, the trustees. Oh Jesus, may we rededicate ourselves to you today, Father. &gt;&gt; We ask for more sincerity. We ask that we can be more God conscious. Help us, Lord Jesus. Help every minister in our church that climbs behind this pullpit to realize that they're standing at the closest place between heaven and earth. So therefore, we're not interested in their ideas or their agendas or them. But men of God preach Jesus. Help me Lord as the pastor. Oh Lord God, to stay true, stay faithful. I believe your greatness will be made manifest among us in a way that we've not yet seen if we can just dedicate ourselves to you, Father. Praise the Lord. How many just rededicate your life here this morning while we're standing in the presence of the Lord? Would you mind laying a hand on that person there standing by you? You're offering yourself now, but you're praying for them that God will help them. Oh, Wednesday night when you walk in this place next Sunday, when you walk in here, may this sermon be a pivotal point in our lives till we realize this is a sacred place. This is a holy place. God goes to church and God loves to worship. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Brother John, would you come pray for the people? Lord Jesus, thank you, Father. Father, &gt;&gt; oh heavenly father, [snorts] &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; how we love you, Lord Jesus. How we thank you so much for your word, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord God. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father God, &gt;&gt; help us, Father. It helps us realize, Father, where we're sitting at. Lord, maybe we don't sit on the side where we don't want to go to church, Lord. Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; but Father, maybe it helps us to realize that there's so many of our our loved ones that do, Father. &gt;&gt; Jesus, I pray. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, I pray that you would just move, Lord. &gt;&gt; I pray, Lord Jesus, that you would just help us, each and every one, Lord Jesus, that we might rededicate our lives to you, Lord. We pray, Father God, that we we would be more fervent and more sincere, Lord Jesus, in you, Lord. May we realize, Lord, that as the world gets wicer and evil, Lord Jesus, that you are becoming greater and more holy, Lord Jesus, and you're desiring for us to get closer to you, Father. How we love you, Lord. We thank you, Father, that you make us aware, Father, that that you want us, Lord Jesus, to be more sincere, Lord Jesus. And and and make us more aware, Father God, of what you want to do for us, Lord Jesus. We know that the word is coming down so strong, so pure, Lord Jesus, that you're grabbing our attention, Father, and you're getting us ready for that day, Father God. We long for it, Lord Jesus. We pray that you would just continue to be with each and every one, Lord. We pray, Father, that you would just move for our sister Evelyn, Lord Jesus, as she had to leave, Father God, that she had to leave being sick, Lord. We pray in the name of Jesus that you would just go for forward, Lord Jesus, and meet her. Lord, we ask you, Father, for each and every knee. Lord, we ask it, Lord Jesus. We give you all the praise and the glory, Lord. We have no motive, Lord Jesus. We have no objective, Father God. BUT TO SEE YOU, LORD, that others would see you reflected in our lives, Lord. We love you. We thank you for it, Lord Jesus. Just give to each and every one. Father, we love you. We thank you for it, Lord. How we worship you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's just sing this together and worship him just a bit before we go. Sing it for us here. &gt;&gt; As I walked [singing] through the door, I sensed his presence. And I knew this [singing] was the place where love abounds. [music] For this is the temple Jehovah God abides here. [singing] And we are standing [singing] in his presence [music] on holy [singing] ground. And [singing] we are standing [singing] on holy ground. [singing] And I know there are [singing] angels all around. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Let [singing] us praise Jesus [music] now. Oh, [singing] we are [music] standing in his presence on the holy [singing] ground. [music] Oh, [singing] we are standing on [music and singing] holy ground. And I know that [singing and music] there are angels [music] all around. [singing] Let us praise [music] Jesus [singing] now. [music] For [singing] we are standing [music] in [singing] his presence on holy ground. In his [singing and music] presence there is joy [singing] beyond measure. [music] And at his [music] feet, [singing] peace of mind can still be found. [singing] And if you [music] have [singing] a need, I know my God has the [music and singing] answer. Reach out [singing] and claim it. For [music] you are standing on [singing] holy ground. [music] For we [singing] are standing [music] on [singing] holy ground. Oh, [music and singing] and I know that there are angels [singing] [music] all around. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Let us praise [music] Jesus now. For [singing] we [music] are standing in his [music] presence on a [singing] holy ground. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, we are standing holy ground. [music] [singing] And I know [music] I know that [singing] there are angels [music] all around. [singing] Let [music] us praise Jesus [singing] now. Oh, [music] we are standing in his [music] presence on [singing] holy ground. [music] I have heard how Christians [singing and music] long ago were brought [singing] before [music] a tyrous throne. They were told that he [singing] would spare [music] their lives if they would renounce [music and singing] the name of Christ. One [music and singing] by one they chose to die. [music] Son of [singing] God, they would not deny like a great angelic [singing and music] saint. I can [music and singing] almost hear their voicees ring. I pled [singing and music] alance to the lamb. With all my [singing and music] strength, with all I am, I will seek to [singing] honor his [music] commands. I pledge [singing] alance to the [music] Now [music] the years have come [singing] and now the years have gone, but the cause [singing and music] for Jesus still goes on. And now [music] our time has come [singing] for us to count the cost, [music] to reject [singing] this world and [music] embrace our cross. And one by one, [singing] let us live our lives for [music] the one [singing] who died to give us life till the [music] trumpet [singing] sounds on that final [music] day. Let us proudly stand and [singing] boldly [music] say I pledge [singing] allegiance to the [music] lamb with all [singing] my strength with [music] all I am will sing to honor [singing] his commands. I [music] [singing] lead angels to [music] the to the lamb [music] of God who bore my pain, [music and singing] who took my place, who wore my shame.
