[7:53] Praise the Lord. Isn't it good to be in
[7:55] the house of God tonight?
[7:57] &gt;&gt; How many of you enjoyed service here on
[7:58] Sunday?
[7:59] &gt;&gt; Was the word of the Lord phenomenal?
[8:02] &gt;&gt; We appreciate it with all of our heart,
[8:03] don't we?
[8:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at your neighbor and tell
[8:06] them you're glad to see him in the house
[8:08] of the Lord tonight.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a privilege it is to be in
[8:12] the house of God.
[8:14] Praise the Lord. Want to welcome all of
[8:17] our visitors. If we have visitors with
[8:19] us tonight, we want to say we welcome
[8:21] you to this service. Trust you just

[8:32] Also, give our visitors and our
[8:34] streamers a real good hand tonight. If

[8:42] [applause]
[8:42] If you don't mind to stand with me just
[8:44] for a few minutes, we don't have that
[8:45] many requests. Uh, Sister Ruth Louise
[8:48] Jax is requesting prayer for her
[8:50] daughter. She is pregnant with twins and
[8:53] they're just asking that the Lord would
[8:55] let everything be all right on her
[8:57] behalf. Sister Connie Kingston says,
[8:59] "Please remember me in prayer. I fell
[9:01] and fractured my arm." We'll be going in
[9:03] next week for surgery. So, we certainly
[9:06] want to pray for her tonight. Want to
[9:08] continue to remember Brother Samuel
[9:10] Sheffller in prayer that the Lord just
[9:12] work out all the details in his life.
[9:14] God's able to fix all those situations,
[9:17] isn't he? Amen. Sister Diana wants us to
[9:20] remember her niec's baby boy, Cassidy. I
[9:22] hope I got that name right. He's 8
[9:25] months old with a rare cancer. They are
[9:28] starting radiation now and concerned it
[9:31] could cause him to be deformed as he
[9:33] grows. Thank you so much for your
[9:36] prayer. So we certainly want to remember
[9:38] that prayer request tonight as we pray
[9:40] an unspoken prayer request for Aaron
[9:43] Scott. Brother Rudy, sister Nina sends
[9:45] that in. So let's remember Aaron tonight
[9:47] as we pray. Then we have this testimony.
[9:50] This is from brother Curtis Hunnel.
[9:53] Says, "Praise the Lord. God has healed
[9:55] my hip. I can walk now." Isn't that
[9:58] great? Ain't that great?
[10:01] [applause]
[10:04] He wants to thank all of you for your
[10:05] prayers, your love, kindness, food,
[10:08] mailing of cards, texts, and phone
[10:10] calls. God bless you all. So, we
[10:13] appreciate Brother Curtis tonight. Thank
[10:14] the Lord that he's received a touch from
[10:17] the master. Amen. How many of you have a
[10:19] need tonight you'd like for this group
[10:21] to pray about? We just want to commit
[10:23] all these things unto the Lord as we
[10:25] approach this this season and things
[10:28] going on, the hustle and the bustle of
[10:30] all that's going on. We just want to we
[10:32] want to stay balanced and we want to
[10:34] stay in love with the Lord and we want
[10:36] to love each other. Amen.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; Not just at Christmas time. We want to
[10:40] love each other all the time, don't we?
[10:42] &gt;&gt; Look at your neighbor and tell them and
[10:44] say this right,
[10:47] brother, sister, I love you in the Lord.
[10:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Let me make just
[10:54] a few announcements tonight. We will be
[10:56] having service, a special service on
[10:59] Saturday, December the 27th that will
[11:03] include communion and footwashing. The
[11:05] service will begin at 6:00. So remember
[11:08] that announcement tonight. Also,
[11:10] Christmas cards from Brother Donnie and
[11:12] Sister Carol are available in the
[11:14] library. You still have some of those,
[11:16] Brother Keith. One per family until
[11:18] further notice. Remember that tonight if
[11:21] you will. And all the trustees are going
[11:23] to be a meeting tonight after the
[11:25] service. Remember that a trustee meeting
[11:28] tonight after the service. Let's just
[11:30] sing that chorus one more time. What a
[11:33] lovely name.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; The name of Jesus. A lot of people took
[11:37] his name in vain today. A lot of people
[11:40] take his name in vain every day that
[11:41] they live. But I'm so glad we call on
[11:43] that name with reverence and respect
[11:46] because he is the greatest thing that
[11:48] ever got a hold of our life. Amen.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[11:53] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "It's the truth." Anyhow,
[11:56] praise the Lord. Is what
[12:00] a lovely name the name of [music] Jesus
[12:06] reaching higher far [singing]
[12:11] than [music] the brightest [singing]
[12:13] star.
[12:15] Oh, and sweeter [music]
[12:18] than the songs they sing in heaven.
[12:25] Let the world [music] proclaim. Brother
[12:27] John, if you'd come, Brother John
[12:29] Hornac,
[12:31] sing it one more time if you will. Oh
[12:34] yes. Now, what
[12:37] a lovely name. The name of Jesus,
[12:43] reaching higher far
[12:47] [music]
[12:48] than the brightest star.
[12:52] Oh, it's sweeter
[12:56] than the songs they [music] sing in
[12:59] heaven.
[13:02] Let the world [music and singing]
[13:03] proclaim.
[13:07] What a lovely [music] name.
[13:11] And we love this guy right here, too,
[13:13] don't we? Brother John. Brother John,
[13:15] just want you to know this. This
[13:17] assembly is praying for your boy. I
[13:22] believe God's going to fix everything.
[13:24] &gt;&gt; I believe God's going to fix everything.
[13:26] He never said, "Did you feel it?" He
[13:28] said, "Do you believe it?" How many of
[13:30] you believe that God's going to help
[13:32] this man's boy?
[13:34] &gt;&gt; Just a wonderful family this guy's got
[13:36] right here.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; We love you, buddy. Appreciate you
[13:39] praying. Have to cry. [laughter]
[13:42] He is doing better. Let's keep praying.
[13:45] We're uh we we have I guess is a good
[13:49] opportunity to tell you we we've been to
[13:50] the doctor about several things with him
[13:53] uh his neck and we think that maybe
[13:56] there's some correlation there
[13:59] between his his his neck is in he's got
[14:02] the the neck of a 54 year old at 14. So
[14:10] unless Lord moves there, he's he's got a
[14:12] long way to go with that too. But maybe
[14:14] there's a correlation between that and
[14:16] his stomach and all that. But we've seen
[14:17] some improvement.
[14:20] Some is not all. And we're believing for
[14:22] all.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; So just keep that in mind. And just
[14:26] remember he's 14 and he's dealing with
[14:28] all this.
[14:30] &gt;&gt; So that's a lot. He can't go to school.
[14:32] He just, you know, that's a lot for a
[14:34] young man to deal with. So
[14:37] and a lot for his mama
[14:40] and me a little too. So if you would
[14:43] just just keep believing Lord more than
[14:46] able. He's more than able.
[14:49] &gt;&gt; And not only more than able, but more
[14:51] than willing.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; Just help us find that faith where we
[14:54] need to be and watch him work.
[14:57] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we love you, Father.
[15:02] There's no doubt in our minds, no no
[15:05] question in our hearts, Father, how real
[15:07] you are and how awesome you are and how
[15:11] many things we've seen you do time and
[15:13] time and time again, Lord. And just
[15:16] because we're waiting doesn't mean that
[15:19] you're not moving, Lord. We believe with
[15:22] all our hearts, with each request that I
[15:24] hold in my hand, Lord, that you're
[15:25] mindful.
[15:27] Lord, I
[15:29] think of the sparrow. Lord, think of
[15:31] your scripture and you you're mindful of
[15:33] the sparrow. Lord, surely you you care
[15:36] about sons and daughters and their
[15:39] well-being and and how it each sickness
[15:44] and each situation, Lord. It affects not
[15:48] only them, Lord, but the family and the
[15:49] loved ones and the the church family,
[15:52] Lord. Lord Jesus,
[15:56] you're an awesome God.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[15:59] &gt;&gt; There's no doubt.
[16:01] &gt;&gt; There's no question, Lord, not only for
[16:04] Lincoln, Lord Jesus, but for each
[16:06] request that I hold in my hand. You're
[16:09] mindful, Lord. And Lord, if we're
[16:12] concerned about it, what kind of God
[16:15] would you be if you weren't? But Lord
[16:17] Jesus, we know that you're concerned
[16:20] and not worried,
[16:22] just just concerned that we we have
[16:25] questions or doubts, Lord. So we believe
[16:26] that you're here to to push all those
[16:30] away that we can look promise right in
[16:33] the face and accept it and believe it,
[16:35] Lord. And Lord Jesus, we're not only
[16:37] asking for healings and different
[16:40] situations and things, Lord Jesus, in
[16:42] our lives, Lord, but we're longing to
[16:45] hear more of you.
[16:47] &gt;&gt; We're longing, Lord Jesus,
[16:50] honestly, Lord, that's the most
[16:52] important thing, Lord.
[16:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; So, I want to draw closer to you. I want
[16:57] to know you more cuz I know that if I
[17:00] get to know you more, then I'll be able
[17:01] to see myself more. Lord, we're just
[17:04] longing for it. I pray that you'd help
[17:06] us put it aside every weight and every
[17:09] measure, every thought of the day. Lord,
[17:11] I come running from work and and I just
[17:14] want to put all that aside and focus and
[17:16] concentrate on you. I want to worship
[17:18] you, Lord. I pray that you would help
[17:20] each musician in the in the songs that
[17:23] we sing, Lord. May it bring you honor
[17:25] and glory and praise, Lord.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; Just anoint each and every part. Father,
[17:29] we love you. We thank you for it in
[17:32] Jesus name. Amen.
[17:35] &gt;&gt; God bless you.

[23:54] &gt;&gt; [music]
[24:01] [music]
[24:08] &gt;&gt; You are perfection.
[24:12] You have [singing]
[24:13] no [music] flaws at all.
[24:20] When you came [music and singing] to
[24:22] earth, you had your choice of [singing]
[24:27] where you could have been born.
[24:32] So why [singing]
[24:35] choose a [music] stable
[24:37] if you are [singing] able
[24:41] to choose royalty?
[24:45] And I [singing]
[24:48] like to [music] believe
[24:51] it was to [singing] show me
[24:55] that a perfect king can live in
[24:57] imperfect [singing and music]
[24:58] things.
[25:02] M.
[25:04] So if [music and singing] you're looking
[25:06] for a place to rest,
[25:11] oh, here [music]
[25:13] is [singing] my request.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; [music]
[25:22] &gt;&gt; I'm not fit for a [singing] king, but if
[25:26] you want to live in me, [music]
[25:30] then make [singing] my heart your own.
[25:35] I [music] don't have [singing] silver or
[25:38] gold, and you deserve a better throne.
[25:43] [music] Still, I'm [singing] the one you
[25:45] chose.
[25:46] Make my heart yours. Oh, [music]
[25:51] [singing]
[25:55] [music]
[26:00] [music]
[26:03] you are so [singing] holy.
[26:06] [music] Oh, the earth bows at [singing]
[26:11] your voice. [music]
[26:17] all knowing [singing and music] king
[26:19] born for suffering
[26:22] but still [singing] you made your
[26:25] [music]
[26:26] choice
[26:28] so why [singing]
[26:31] choose a manger [music]
[26:33] when you're the creator
[26:37] of [singing and music] everything
[26:41] when I [singing]
[26:44] feel so unworthy [music] me. Oh, you
[26:48] remind me [singing]
[26:51] that a perfect king [music]
[26:53] can live in perfect things.
[27:01] So, if you're [music] looking for a
[27:03] [singing] place to rest,
[27:08] oh, here [singing] is my
[27:11] request. [music]
[27:16] I'm not fit for a king,
[27:18] [singing and music] but if you want to
[27:20] live in me, then [singing] make my heart
[27:24] your own.
[27:28] [music] I don't have silver or gold,
[27:31] [singing]
[27:32] and you deserve a better throne.
[27:36] Still, I'm the [music and singing] one
[27:37] you chose.
[27:39] Make my heart.
[27:42] [singing]
[27:45] [music]
[27:47] [singing] Oh,
[27:50] [music]
[27:52] make my [singing] heart.
[28:00] Oh. [singing]
[28:07] your home.
[28:15] [singing]
[28:18] [music] Make my heart your home.
[28:23] [music]
[28:26] Ooh.
[28:29] Oh. [singing]
[28:33] So, if [music] you're looking for a
[28:35] place to rest, [singing]
[28:39] oh, here is my [singing]
[28:43] request. [music]
[28:49] [music]
[28:51] I'm not fit for a [singing] king. But if
[28:55] [music] you want to live in me,
[28:58] then make [singing] my heart your home.
[29:01] [music]
[29:04] I don't have silver or [singing] gold,
[29:07] and you deserve a better throne.
[29:11] Still, I'm the one you [singing] chose.
[29:15] Make my heart your home. [music]
[29:20] [singing]
[29:23] Oh,
[29:28] make [singing and music] my heart your
[29:30] home. Oh,
[29:34] [applause]
[29:40] [applause]
[29:44] words up there.
[30:51] Uh, brothers, can you pull up the
[30:55] the words to Almost Home? Brother Oal
[31:00] Reese asked me to sing this. If y'all
[31:02] can help me and make it a a
[31:04] congregation, it'll be a whole lot
[31:06] better.
[31:10] It's not a Christmas song, but
[31:13] I believe it's a lot of what Christmas
[31:15] was about.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; Christmas was about him making our heart
[31:21] fit for him to live in us. I was
[31:23] listening to brother Brown today and
[31:26] preaching in 49 about deity being in us
[31:31] and I [music] was thinking Lord he
[31:32] preached that in 49 and I still ain't
[31:34] got it [laughter]
[31:36] not the way he preached it but at the
[31:38] end of it he just I love his simplicity
[31:40] [snorts]
[31:41] at the end of it he said let's just have
[31:42] a testimony he said just a three or four
[31:45] testimony said can somebody say I love
[31:48] Jesus and it just people started just
[31:51] here and there saying I love Jesus and
[31:52] it Just I don't know. Can anybody here
[31:55] say, "I love Jesus."
[31:57] &gt;&gt; I love Jesus.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; Ain't you glad he came? [music]
[32:00] &gt;&gt; Are you disappointed?
[32:03] [music]
[32:04] Are you desperate for help?
[32:09] [music] You know what it's like to be
[32:11] tired and only a shell of yourself.
[32:16] [music]
[32:17] You start to believe
[32:22] you don't have what it [music] takes
[32:27] cuz it's all you [singing] can do just
[32:29] to move [music]
[32:30] much less finish the race.
[32:36] But don't forget [music]
[32:40] what lies ahead.
[32:45] Almost
[32:47] home, brother. It won't [singing]
[32:51] be long. Soon all our burdens
[32:56] [singing and music]
[32:56] will be gone.
[33:02] Oh, with all your strength, sister, run
[33:07] on
[33:09] free. [music]
[33:10] Hold up your head. Keep [singing]
[33:14] pressing
[33:16] on.
[33:18] We are almost home. [music]
[33:23] Well, this road will be hard,
[33:27] but we [music] win [singing] in the end
[33:32] simply because it's Jesus in us. It's
[33:37] not if, but when.
[33:41] So [music] take joy in the [singing]
[33:42] journey
[33:45] even when it feels [music]
[33:47] long [singing]
[33:50] and find strength in each step. Knowing
[33:53] heaven [music] is cheering you on.
[33:57] [singing]
[33:58] We are
[34:01] almost [singing]
[34:02] home. Brother, [music]
[34:04] it won't be [singing] long. Soon all our
[34:09] burdens
[34:11] will be gone. [singing]
[34:17] Oh, [music] with all your strength,
[34:21] sister, run all around free. Hold
[34:26] [music] up your head. Keep pressing
[34:32] on.
[34:34] We [music]
[34:34] are almost home.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[34:39] &gt;&gt; We're almost [music] home.
[34:44] We're almost home.
[34:50] [singing]
[34:54] [music] I know that the cross has
[34:56] brought heaven to us. But make no
[34:59] [music] mistake, there's still more to
[35:01] [singing] come when our flesh and our
[35:04] bones [music]
[35:05] are no longer between.
[35:07] who we are right now and where we're
[35:10] meant to be. [music] When all has been
[35:13] lost, made whole again. These tears and
[35:16] [music] this pain no longer [singing]
[35:19] exists. No more walking. We're running
[35:22] as fast as [music] we can. Consider this
[35:27] our second way. [music]
[35:31] We're almost
[35:34] home, brother. It won't be long. [music]
[35:40] Soon all our burdens
[35:43] will be gone.
[35:47] [singing]
[35:49] [music] Oh, with all your strength,
[35:53] sisters, run on, run free. [music]
[35:58] Hold up your head. Keep pressing
[36:03] [singing] on.
[36:06] We are almost home.
[36:11] We're almost home.
[36:16] We're almost home.
[36:19] [singing]
[36:24] We are almost home.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's not just a nice
[36:39] song.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[36:45] We don't just know that by looking at us
[36:48] and what God is doing in us and what God
[36:52] is doing through us and the desire that
[36:53] we have. But we look and see on the
[36:56] other side out there.
[36:58] Remember there's two great kings.
[37:01] Both of them have wives.
[37:05] Both of those kings are gods.
[37:09] Two gods,
[37:11] two kings,
[37:13] &gt;&gt; two wives.
[37:15] King God
[37:17] and the God of this evil age.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; He's only a god because he's worshiped
[37:23] by the people,
[37:25] &gt;&gt; not because he's a creator. Remember,
[37:27] God is an object of worship.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; And Satan is a god,
[37:34] &gt;&gt; but he's not mine.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; But he is the god of this evil age.
[37:43] If you listen to that title of that
[37:45] sermon, you listen to it and you hear
[37:46] the prophet say he's worshiped by
[37:48] millions and billions
[37:52] &gt;&gt; of people.
[37:54] Isn't that something? People would
[37:56] worship a God that ain't got a heaven to
[37:59] take him to.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; A god that couldn't create a fly.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; A god that can't heal them. A god that
[38:08] don't love them. And yet they give him
[38:10] their whole heart and soul.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; My my don't make any sense to me. Does
[38:17] it?
[38:18] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I can't relate to it. God bless
[38:21] you. Let's turn to Genesis 24. Said all
[38:25] that to lay a foundation for the
[38:27] direction we're going to go tonight.
[38:30] So keep in mind that when we go from
[38:33] Genesis right on to the book of
[38:34] Revelation that there's two great powers
[38:38] that are influencing the people on the
[38:40] earth. And everybody on the earth is
[38:43] under the influence of one or the other.
[38:46] And in that influence there can be
[38:49] people with different motives, different
[38:50] objectives. Just like with the devil,
[38:53] the devil is the king of politics. And
[38:56] yet people on either side of the aisle
[38:58] of whichever side of the aisle you're on
[38:59] when it comes to politics, they'll fuss
[39:02] and fight and argue and debate and
[39:05] they've still got one head,
[39:07] &gt;&gt; the devil.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; So it ain't like God is the God of the
[39:10] Republican party and the devil's the God
[39:12] of the Democratic Republic.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Depends on which one you are. Of course,
[39:16] you think God's on your side.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Actually, God is not the God of either
[39:20] one of them.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; The devil is the God of politics.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; But in that he diversifies and so does
[39:29] God. So God has different people with
[39:32] different makeups, different callings
[39:34] and that sometimes can be very confusing
[39:36] to people and it's hard for people to
[39:39] imagine.
[39:41] But the fastest growing religion in the
[39:43] world of course is Islam.
[39:46] And whenever you study the history of
[39:47] it, you realize how rotten and corrupt
[39:49] that it really is. But yet the same God
[39:53] of Islam is the exact same God of
[39:57] Christianity in the denominational
[40:00] system.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Now, they would never think they were on
[40:05] the same side,
[40:07] but they are.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Not only that, but people around this
[40:12] message that don't take the full word
[40:14] are just as bad.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; It don't matter to God. It doesn't
[40:19] really matter to God. which verse of
[40:22] scripture that you don't believe whether
[40:24] it's Malachi 4 or Ephesians 4.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; The real bride believes every word he
[40:31] says.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; So now watch this this antitype
[40:40] as great as this messenger that we're
[40:42] going to read about was
[40:45] gifted gifted by by Abraham but also
[40:48] gifted by God. called by Abraham, called
[40:50] by God, endowt with treasure by Abraham
[40:54] and by God. But yet, as great as he was,
[40:59] he could not be able to bring a bride on
[41:04] his own strength.
[41:06] As gifted as brother Brandham was, never
[41:09] a gentile like him, never a prophet on
[41:12] the earth like him.
[41:14] But even as great as that was, it took
[41:18] more than that.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; It took the angels of God.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; It took the angels of God. Now remember,
[41:27] Eleazar went, but he was confused about,
[41:30] "Should I take him there if she won't
[41:32] come?" He said, "Oh, no, no. The angel
[41:33] of the Lord will go before you." So, he
[41:36] was not adequate enough within himself.
[41:40] Neither is Brother Brennham. Neither is
[41:41] your pastor. Neither's any other
[41:43] preacher.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Neither will Satan's bride
[41:49] consummate wind up being in hell
[41:53] just on her own corruption.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; She will be influenced by demons.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; Them demons will deceive. Them demons
[42:05] will motivate them. So both brides under
[42:09] the headship of God and the God of this
[42:12] evil age have angels working for them
[42:17] &gt;&gt; to bring their bride
[42:18] &gt;&gt; to them.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I just know which one I'm on
[42:23] whose side I'm on.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; And Abraham was old and well stricken in
[42:28] age. And the Lord blessed Abraham in all
[42:32] things. And Abraham said unto his eldest
[42:35] servant of his house, that ruled over
[42:37] all that he had, put I pray thee, thy
[42:39] hand under my side, and I will make thee
[42:42] swear by the Lord, the God of heaven,
[42:44] and the God of the earth, that thou
[42:46] shalt not take a wife unto my son, to
[42:48] the daughters of the Canaanites among
[42:51] whom I dwell. But thou shalt go unto my
[42:55] country, and to my kindred, and take a
[42:59] wife unto my son, the three m, my
[43:03] country, my kindred, my son Isaac. And
[43:07] the servant said unto him, per
[43:08] adventure, the woman will not be willing
[43:11] to follow me into this revealed word of
[43:14] the hour. must thy needs bring thy son
[43:17] again into the land from which you come
[43:20] out of. Come out of her, my people, that
[43:22] you be not partakers of her sins." So
[43:25] God wouldn't call us out, and then send
[43:27] us back in.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; And Abraham said unto him, "Beware that
[43:31] thou bring not my son thither again. The
[43:34] Lord God of heaven, which took me from
[43:36] my father's house, and from the land of
[43:38] my kindred, which spake unto me, that
[43:41] swear unto me, saying unto thy seed,
[43:43] will I give this land." He shall send
[43:46] his angel before thee. So it would not
[43:52] have been enough for Eleazar to went by
[43:55] himself. Neither would it been enough
[43:59] had brother Brandham came.
[44:02] Why would God
[44:04] send an angel and meet him in that
[44:07] sacred place where he was? And he's down
[44:11] praying and out of this light he sees
[44:14] them feet of the angel of God. Wonder
[44:18] why an angel.
[44:21] So then you realize what a lot of other
[44:23] preachers then had to do in that age.
[44:27] They would also have to say that they
[44:30] had an angel
[44:34] &gt;&gt; because that's one of the things that
[44:35] separated him
[44:37] &gt;&gt; was the angel. Wasn't just a preacher.
[44:39] wasn't just a prophet, wasn't just a
[44:40] prophesier, but he had an angel to
[44:43] accompany him. So then other men in that
[44:45] age and some thereafter, they must say
[44:48] the same thing. Why? Because that will
[44:51] raise them above their brethren,
[44:54] &gt;&gt; uhoh,
[44:54] &gt;&gt; and put them on the level that very few
[44:57] men ever get to walk on.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; They communicate with angels
[45:04] &gt;&gt; and they talk to them according to them
[45:06] and angels talk back. and so on and so
[45:09] on.
[45:11] [clears throat]
[45:11] Notice this. He shall send his angel
[45:14] before thee, and thou shalt take a wife
[45:16] unto my son. I want you to notice he
[45:18] said. Well, maybe it'll work out. I
[45:20] don't know. I mean, I'm praying that it
[45:22] will. I'm just kind of hoping if I go to
[45:24] all this trouble. No, look how positive
[45:26] he is. He shall
[45:29] &gt;&gt; send his angel before thee. And thou
[45:32] shalt
[45:34] &gt;&gt; take a wife.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. unto my son from then. If
[45:38] Abraham could be that positive, how much
[45:41] more positive was our God? Yes, sir.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; I may like to be remembered tonight as
[45:45] we pray. God bless you. Let's pray
[45:47] together. Heavenly Father, we thank you,
[45:50] Lord, to be living in this day. We're so
[45:53] grateful, Lord Jesus, for what we see
[45:56] that you have done in the days and the
[45:58] ages gone by. It was marvelous the
[46:02] things that you have done. But Lord, how
[46:04] grateful we are that we live in a day
[46:07] that in reality is greater than them
[46:10] all. Oh, it have been wonderful to live
[46:13] in the days of Peter, James, and John
[46:15] and Paul and all of that. But that was
[46:18] the alpha church. That was the church in
[46:20] its beginning. But here we are, Lord
[46:23] God, the going home time. We thank you
[46:26] for the this day that we live. Speak to
[46:28] us tonight from your word. Father, I
[46:30] pray in the name of Jesus. And the
[46:33] saints said,
[46:34] &gt;&gt; amen.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated. Turn
[46:37] with me to Daniel chapter 10 verse 13.
[46:42] [clears throat]
[46:43] So remember, Satan is not God in the
[46:46] realm that he could create.
[46:48] Uh so he's a powerless being although an
[46:53] object of worship.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; But your car could be that.
[46:58] Your piano could be that. Your house
[47:02] could be that. All kinds of things you
[47:04] could make a god out of.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; So you put them before the Lord. They
[47:08] are your God. But Satan is a powerless
[47:12] god when it would be to to say that he
[47:15] is omnipotent because he's not
[47:17] omnisient. He's not uh being everywhere
[47:20] at one time, same time. He's not none of
[47:22] that. It cannot create cannot do many
[47:25] things that almighty god can do. that he
[47:27] is a god and that he is worshiped by
[47:30] millions and billions of people. So
[47:33] whenever he was able to convince the
[47:36] angels in the beginning and he exalted
[47:38] himself above them and preached to them
[47:41] and then whenever he got these angels to
[47:43] believe his lie, they separated away
[47:46] from the presence of God. Now there was
[47:48] a a divine hierarchy that God had given
[47:52] them by creation. Gave them their power,
[47:55] their authority, their ability of what
[47:58] they would be able to do. God placed
[48:01] them in ranks. And whenever they fell,
[48:05] they actually did not lose that rank. I
[48:08] want you to think that some of the
[48:09] angels that fail actually had higher
[48:14] rank than the ones who didn't fall.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; So it's not like that when they fell and
[48:22] backslid they lost everything. No, they
[48:26] did not lose everything. You see, that's
[48:29] why that preachers, singers, religious
[48:32] people can be gifted of God to do all
[48:35] kinds of things and then they can
[48:37] actually backslide, get away from the
[48:40] Lord, and it's not like they lose
[48:42] everything. How many preachers stand in
[48:44] the pull pit every week and preach and
[48:46] do their duty and in their hearts as
[48:49] backslid as they can be?
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And sometimes it'll be years
[48:53] before that ever comes out and people
[48:55] find out, oh my goodness, he was doing
[48:57] this, he was doing that. He was living
[49:00] this way, living that way. Why? Because
[49:03] he never lost that. God gave it to him
[49:05] and it was there whether he was serving
[49:07] God or wasn't serving God. So these
[49:10] angels then that forfeited what the
[49:13] Bible calls their estate. Now it was not
[49:16] land of course, houses and things as we
[49:19] would know, but it was an allocation
[49:21] that God gave to them. Now they are held
[49:24] in chains unto everlasting darkness. So
[49:29] they'll never be able to rise above
[49:31] where they've fallen from. But it
[49:34] doesn't mean that they cannot appear,
[49:36] disappear just like the angels of God
[49:39] can. There's some of them right here in
[49:40] this building tonight. Them demons are
[49:42] right here. And they can appear,
[49:45] disappear, make themselves appear as
[49:48] angels of light. They can anoint people
[49:52] with their anointing. They can actually
[49:54] get into people's mouths with their
[49:58] anointing and uh be so convincing that
[50:03] they would lead people astray in the
[50:06] name of the Lord. And they would say,
[50:08] "Thus sayaeth the Lord." Cuz thus sayeth
[50:10] the Lord, just repeating it doesn't
[50:12] bother demons. They're not afraid.
[50:14] They're not afraid at all to go to
[50:16] church. They like church, unless of
[50:18] course it's a devil casting out church.
[50:20] They don't like them as much. But
[50:22] they're not afraid to get around people
[50:24] that believe in God. They're not afraid
[50:27] to attend a tape meeting.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; They're not afraid to attend our special
[50:32] meetings, our youth meetings. They're
[50:34] not afraid at all. But what they become
[50:37] afraid of is when the spirit of God will
[50:40] take the cover off of them and God will
[50:43] illuminate you to help you to see who
[50:45] you are and also to see who they are and
[50:49] greater is he that is in you than he
[50:51] that is in the world. Now they don't
[50:53] like that and they actually are afraid.
[50:57] Now think about it that demons can
[50:59] become afraid. that when they're going
[51:02] to be exposed, they become very fearful.
[51:06] And they also when God is going to
[51:10] illuminate something about their plan,
[51:13] something that they're in the process of
[51:16] doing that really gets them fired up.
[51:19] Now, God had to send an angel of God
[51:23] that would forerun this great messenger,
[51:27] and he's coming to get a bride for
[51:29] Isaac. And it was more than Ezer, more
[51:33] than the gifts, more than all of that.
[51:36] There had to be an angelic anointing
[51:39] that would come and release her from the
[51:43] hole that she had been raised in all of
[51:46] her entire life. Now watch, let's bring
[51:49] it over now to the book of Daniel,
[51:51] chapter 10, verse 13. Now, we know the
[51:54] story here as we looked at a little bit
[51:56] last Wednesday night that
[51:58] [clears throat] Daniel has been praying
[52:01] because he had learned by the reading of
[52:04] the books of Jeremiah that there was an
[52:08] allocation of time. The children of
[52:10] Israel was going to go down into this
[52:13] captivity state and they were going to
[52:15] be there for a certain period of time,
[52:17] 70 years. And he knew by reading the
[52:21] prophets books.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Now some people in that day might have
[52:27] said, "Why in the world are you reading
[52:30] the books of that dead man?"
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Why would you sit around and read them
[52:37] books when that man's been gone now for
[52:40] about 65 years?
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; That man's been gone for years and
[52:47] years. But Daniel knew he had the word
[52:49] of the Lord.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; So Daniel starts praying and fasting and
[52:55] seeking God about the time frame where
[52:59] they were. Now remember, King Cyrus was
[53:02] the king that God had prophesied through
[53:05] Isaiah about himund something years
[53:09] before he was ever born. It was through
[53:12] an edict of King Cyrus. I'd like to go
[53:15] through some of that all with with you
[53:17] sometime. But it was through Cyrus that
[53:19] God had began to move on their heart for
[53:22] restoration to build the temple back.
[53:25] And yet there was more to be done. So it
[53:27] went from one king to another king, from
[53:30] one prophet to another prophet. And now
[53:33] it was time for another loosing of that
[53:37] prophesied word. So Daniel was praying
[53:39] and praying, and you've remembered that
[53:41] he had prayed for three weeks now. So
[53:44] he'd been praying, fasting, seeking the
[53:46] face of God, heard no answer whatsoever.
[53:50] And no doubt he was troubled. God, have
[53:53] I done something or is there something
[53:55] wrong with me? Maybe. Because the first
[53:58] thing is, as I read to you last week,
[54:00] that the angel, the Lord, one of the
[54:02] first things that he said to Daniel was
[54:04] he gave him an explanation why he hadn't
[54:09] been there the first day. So it must
[54:12] have been very troubling to Daniel. And
[54:14] you think how beloved this man was that
[54:17] an angel of God wanted to explain to him
[54:21] why he wasn't even there. So let's read
[54:24] now in Daniel 10:3. But the prince of
[54:28] [snorts] the kingdom of Persia
[54:31] withtood me one and 20 days. Now
[54:35] remember who this angel is that's
[54:37] talking. It's Gabriel.
[54:40] Gabriel,
[54:41] patron angel of the Jews. So, we're
[54:46] talking about a very high ranking angel
[54:50] that never fell.
[54:53] And yet when Daniel was praying and
[54:56] Gabriel is on his way down to bring to
[55:00] him that which was noted in the
[55:02] scripture and when he broke into the
[55:05] kingdom of Persia
[55:07] a demon which was an original angel
[55:11] which ranked an authority higher than
[55:15] Gabriel.
[55:17] Still, [snorts]
[55:18] even though he had fallen,
[55:20] he outranked Gabriel and withtood
[55:24] Gabriel.
[55:26] Now, as we looked at it last week, that
[55:28] these demons actually will get on
[55:31] leaders,
[55:33] prime ministers,
[55:35] presidents, rulers of nations. So when
[55:39] the UN gets together and here's
[55:43] Bulgaria, you know, here's Germany,
[55:45] here's America, here's Israel, here's
[55:48] uh, you know, all these different
[55:50] nations and they're there, but you're
[55:52] only seeing the representative of that
[55:56] kingdom. But in another realm, demons
[56:00] are also at the UN.
[56:03] And those demons will begin to anoint
[56:06] their mouthpieces, whether it's a
[56:08] president or prime minister or whatever
[56:11] they call their representative in their
[56:13] country, and they will start arguing and
[56:16] going back and forth and debating and
[56:19] and arguing and hating and and all of
[56:22] that.
[56:23] Now watch what what's happening here in
[56:26] the kingdom is that he said the prince
[56:29] of the kingdom of Persia withtood me one
[56:34] and 20 days but lo Michael which means
[56:39] to be like God lo Michael one of the
[56:43] chief now watch the rank one of the
[56:47] chief princes
[56:50] came to help me.
[56:53] Gabriel
[56:55] needed help.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll tell you one thing, friends.
[57:00] If Gabriel needed it, I guarantee
[57:02] everybody in this building tonight needs
[57:04] it.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; But at least Gabriel had enough sense to
[57:07] accept help.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; This is astounding to me. Now he says,
[57:15] "Michael, one of the chief princes came
[57:18] to help me and I remained there with the
[57:22] kings of Persia." And now remember what
[57:24] was going on was that Simbes which was
[57:28] the son of Cyrus. There was uh uh many
[57:32] different delegates of the provinces of
[57:35] the kingdom and they would come in for
[57:38] these meetings. And when they would, it
[57:42] was like politics today, of course. They
[57:44] would try to get this man on their side
[57:46] and that man and that man and that man.
[57:49] And they would give them gifts and they
[57:51] would promise them certain things. If we
[57:54] can have your vote, then we'll we'll do
[57:55] this for you and if we can have your
[57:56] vote and we'll just just like it is
[57:58] today cuz it's the same king that runs
[58:00] it.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; And what they were doing, there was this
[58:04] demon of the kingdom of Persia, which
[58:07] had been chosen by Satan many years
[58:09] prior to this. and he would be the one
[58:12] that would anoint the Mes and the
[58:15] Persians and they would merge together
[58:18] and make the kingdom called the Miso
[58:20] Persia. But it's running now down to the
[58:24] end of that kingdom. But this demon was
[58:27] still the one in hierarchy and he was
[58:30] the one over this part of the prophecy
[58:33] of God to try to keep it from happening.
[58:36] Now they were getting together and Cyrus
[58:39] heart had already been touched toward
[58:42] the Jews. But this demon of Persia was
[58:46] trying his best since Cyrus kind of
[58:49] leaned that way. He's trying to use the
[58:52] provincial leaders, the magistrates,
[58:55] we'd call them today prime ministers and
[58:57] all of that. and he's trying to anoint
[58:59] their thinking and they're going to come
[59:01] against Cyrus because Satan don't want
[59:06] God's word for the hour to be fulfilled.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; So, he's going to attack the word. And
[59:14] if Daniel the prophet, if he can be
[59:18] [clears throat] hindered from receiving
[59:20] the timeline,
[59:22] then the rest of the people there will
[59:25] not be able to know it. Because if God
[59:27] is going to do anything, he's going to
[59:29] reveal his secret to the servants, his
[59:32] servants, the prophets. So they could
[59:34] have read it over and over and over
[59:36] again, and they would have never got it.
[59:38] So here was God's here was God's
[59:41] dimensional mouthpiece that could break
[59:45] into the realm of God and be able to get
[59:48] the timeline for the prophecy. Now, it
[59:50] laid in the word, but it didn't do any
[59:52] good if somebody wasn't able to place it
[59:56] in the right timeline. I hope somebody's
[59:58] hearing me tonight.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; You see, it's the same with us. We
[1:00:02] didn't need another pastor. We didn't
[1:00:04] need another evangelist. We needed
[1:00:06] somebody to be able to catch the vision
[1:00:09] of where we were in the timeline. Are we
[1:00:12] in the Ephesian age, the Pergamian age,
[1:00:14] the Sardis Age? Where are we? We're in
[1:00:17] the bride age. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:00:20] So, the prince of Persia, this demon
[1:00:23] over the kingdom, is trying to keep
[1:00:27] Gabriel from bringing the timeline to
[1:00:31] Daniel. And then Daniel will utter it,
[1:00:34] being the messenger of the hour. And the
[1:00:37] elect under Daniel's administration will
[1:00:41] get under the burden of the words. I'm
[1:00:43] going to say it to you this way that the
[1:00:44] angel of God will bring the seal of that
[1:00:47] day and the seal will release the
[1:00:51] mystery of what's to happen in that day
[1:00:54] because God has always allocated so much
[1:00:56] of his word to a certain time frame.
[1:00:58] Sometimes you may have an allocation of
[1:01:00] the word and it'll go for decades and
[1:01:02] nothing else new will come with it. And
[1:01:04] if there is something new, it'll have to
[1:01:05] come to a prophet. And you may you
[1:01:08] imagine how Satan hates that when God
[1:01:11] has now got a word and it's going to be
[1:01:14] revealed. He's going to do everything he
[1:01:16] can to stop that understanding. So
[1:01:20] whenever Gabriel comes down and breaks
[1:01:22] into this realm, this demon finds out
[1:01:27] that he's there.
[1:01:29] And now he starts waring with Gabriel,
[1:01:33] the mighty angel Gabriel. So he's coming
[1:01:36] in and anointing. Now remember, they're
[1:01:39] not just duking it out like that and
[1:01:41] just kicking one another, you know,
[1:01:43] shudo chops and all that sort of thing.
[1:01:45] You know where the battle was? It was in
[1:01:48] the minds of the leaders and them demons
[1:01:52] are fighting for control
[1:01:55] of their minds.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Now what THEY'RE WANTING TO DO IS BOTH
[1:02:00] kingdoms are projecting something. So,
[1:02:03] the prince of Persia and his associates
[1:02:06] are there to try to get Cyrus out of of
[1:02:11] this spot to where he's favoring the
[1:02:13] Jews and and anoint the the provincial
[1:02:16] leaders to where they will say, "No, no,
[1:02:18] no. WE CAN'T DO THAT. NO, NO, NO. YOU
[1:02:20] KNOW, THAT AIN'T RIGHT. That ain't
[1:02:21] right." And then Cyrus will say, "No,
[1:02:22] wait a minute. Wait a minute. I don't I
[1:02:24] don't want to cause trouble in the
[1:02:25] church here. You know, I don't I don't
[1:02:26] want to man alive. I hate to do this
[1:02:28] because it's really going to cause some
[1:02:29] issues." And them demons HAS ALL GONE
[1:02:31] ON. AND THERE'S Gabriel G.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; AND GABRIEL IS THERE WHISPERING TO Cyrus
[1:02:37] and Gabriel. And where's the war going
[1:02:39] on amongst the people?
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Don't you understand? It's exactly the
[1:02:44] same way today. It's not like the angels
[1:02:46] of God are here tonight. I mean, they're
[1:02:48] just hitting them demons right square in
[1:02:50] the mouth, kicking them in the shin, you
[1:02:52] know, knocking them down, kicking and
[1:02:54] stomping. But you understand what's
[1:02:56] going on? Both of them are fighting for
[1:02:58] your mind. Most of them are wanting to
[1:03:01] control you. They are wanting to control
[1:03:04] the people of the earth. Now, for those
[1:03:06] of you who have a seal on your soul,
[1:03:08] them demons can never go any farther
[1:03:11] than that seal. But they'll try to
[1:03:14] trouble you and they'll try to bring
[1:03:16] affliction upon your body and they'll
[1:03:18] try to occupy your mind with business
[1:03:20] and this and that and the other and just
[1:03:23] keep your focus broke away from the word
[1:03:26] and the time and the season that we're
[1:03:29] living in. I hope somebody's going to
[1:03:30] hear me tonight.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; So this is where that is going. So the
[1:03:34] purpose of the prince of Persia is
[1:03:38] detaining Gabriel because his master
[1:03:43] Satan does not want Gabriel to deliver
[1:03:47] the mystery to Daniel of what Satan is
[1:03:51] trying to do. Oh
[1:03:54] Lord have mercy. You can imagine them
[1:03:57] demons out of hell whenever them seals
[1:03:59] started coming open in March of 1963.
[1:04:02] You imagine them devils was nervous
[1:04:05] wrecks. They was tore all two pieces
[1:04:07] when they was hearing the things that
[1:04:09] had never been uttered on the earth by
[1:04:11] Paul or Peter or James. Come on,
[1:04:14] somebody. And yet the devil was hearing
[1:04:16] what was going on. They must have been
[1:04:18] tore up bad. NOW THE DEVIL WAS HOSTILE
[1:04:22] AGAINST THE JEWS. But God had moved upon
[1:04:25] Cyrus heart and had already softened
[1:04:28] that heart. Now, a word was going to be
[1:04:30] revealed for another phase of the
[1:04:34] restoration. But Michael had come down
[1:04:37] and Michael, in other words, like this,
[1:04:39] Michael related to Gabriel, all right,
[1:04:42] I'm good. I don't need your help, but
[1:04:44] you need mine. So, I'm here. I'll hold
[1:04:47] the fort while you're gone. YOU GO DOWN
[1:04:50] there and make it known to Daniel the
[1:04:53] time has arrived.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. SO HE WOULD NOT LEAVE
[1:05:00] CYRUS. YOU UNDERSTAND? THIS IS WHAT
[1:05:02] THEY'RE FIGHTING. HE WOULD not leave
[1:05:04] Cyrus until Michael came. And when
[1:05:08] Michael came, then Gabriel knew he could
[1:05:11] leave Cyrus and go down and tell Daniel.
[1:05:15] And what he does, that's the first thing
[1:05:16] that he tells him and lets him know what
[1:05:18] was going on. Now watch in verse 14. Now
[1:05:21] I am come to make thee understand what
[1:05:25] shall befall thy people in the latter
[1:05:28] days. For yet the vision is for many
[1:05:31] days. Now remember this vision that
[1:05:33] Daniel is going to receive from God is
[1:05:37] going to be divided by a timeline. So
[1:05:40] part of it is for right then and part of
[1:05:43] it is actually still yet to come to
[1:05:46] pass. We're living in in those days
[1:05:48] right now. So whenever he said that it
[1:05:50] shall befall thee, for yet the vision is
[1:05:52] for many days. And when he had spoken
[1:05:55] such words unto me, I set my face toward
[1:05:59] the ground and I became dumb.
[1:06:06] I don't mind telling you, I've seen some
[1:06:07] of these modern-day charismatic guys.
[1:06:09] You know, you see some of them on
[1:06:11] YouTube and some of them and they talk
[1:06:13] with angels, they eat breakfast with
[1:06:15] them, have lunch with them, all that
[1:06:16] sort of thing. And yet, you know, when
[1:06:19] Gabriel come to Daniel, it made him so
[1:06:24] sick. The man passed out. When John had
[1:06:28] these visitations, he passed out like a
[1:06:32] dead man. Is that right? THE THE PROPHET
[1:06:35] OF GOD said that every time that it
[1:06:38] would come near him, though it's
[1:06:39] happened hundreds of thousands of times,
[1:06:42] it would always alarm him, leaving him
[1:06:44] speechless. I've talked to different
[1:06:46] people that was around brother Brandham.
[1:06:48] Brother Bisco was one of them. And
[1:06:50] whenever the angel of the Lord would
[1:06:52] come near and brother Brandon would turn
[1:06:55] ashen white and couldn't even talk, lose
[1:06:59] the ability to speak. And yet SOME
[1:07:02] PEOPLE THAT TALK ABOUT, "OH, there's an
[1:07:04] angel. There's one. There's one. There's
[1:07:06] one. There's one." And it's not
[1:07:07] describing. Oh, there's a body armor
[1:07:09] light. Yeah. How you doing there? How
[1:07:11] you doing? act like you're saying, um, I
[1:07:14] I I I have to question that. I'm sorry
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; because I I'm talking about this man
[1:07:19] here. I want you to look what effect
[1:07:21] that the visitation of the angel had on
[1:07:24] him. And behold, one like the similitude
[1:07:27] of the sons of men touched my lips. Then
[1:07:31] I opened my mouth. Now this presence was
[1:07:34] so overwhelming
[1:07:36] that Daniel went dumb dumb to speak. He
[1:07:39] could not speak. and one like the
[1:07:41] similitude of the sons of men touched my
[1:07:44] lips. I want you to notice now that in
[1:07:47] these visions, Daniel does not mention
[1:07:49] seeing angels with wings.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, if you'll do a
[1:07:58] biblical search and you type in the word
[1:08:00] angels and wings, you'll find no hits
[1:08:04] cuz there ain't none. Now the cherubams
[1:08:08] had wings over their faces and wings
[1:08:10] over their feet, but none of these had
[1:08:14] wings, BUT HOW DANIEL SAW THEM was that
[1:08:18] they looked like a man. Then I opened my
[1:08:22] mouth and spake and said unto him that
[1:08:24] stood before me, "Oh my Lord."
[1:08:28] Look at how Lord is spelled though. Not
[1:08:30] capital L, capital O, capital R, capital
[1:08:33] D, but all lowercase.
[1:08:37] Oh my Lord, by the vision my sorrows are
[1:08:41] turned upon me, and I have retained no
[1:08:46] strength.
[1:08:47] LOOK WHAT THE visitation of an angel of
[1:08:50] God did to this prophet of God. It made
[1:08:54] him so weak, he had no strength left.
[1:08:59] How can the servant of this my lord talk
[1:09:02] with this my lord? For as for me
[1:09:05] straightway there remain no strength in
[1:09:08] me neither is their breasts left in me.
[1:09:13] So Daniel has been so mesmerized by the
[1:09:17] presence of this angel that he was dumb.
[1:09:20] It left him dumb initially. Then it left
[1:09:23] him breathless and it left him with no
[1:09:26] strength at all. AS A MATTER OF FACT, HE
[1:09:29] WOULD HAVE died had not the ANGEL OF GOD
[1:09:33] TOUCHED HIM. BECAUSE HUMAN FLESH CANNOT
[1:09:37] SURVIVE.
[1:09:39] It cannot survive
[1:09:41] in such presence.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; We must be changed.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; And then there came again and TOUCHED ME
[1:09:53] ONE LIKE the appearance of a man.
[1:09:58] one like the appearance of a man and he
[1:10:03] strengthened me. NOW NOTICE WHAT THIS
[1:10:05] angel is doing. So Gabriel comes to
[1:10:09] bring the message and then one like the
[1:10:12] appearance of a man comes and touches
[1:10:15] him and he's able to speak. And then one
[1:10:19] whether it's the same one or not he
[1:10:20] doesn't say. And then there came one
[1:10:22] touch me like the appearance of a man.
[1:10:25] And he strengthened ME AND SAID, "OH
[1:10:29] MAN, GREATLY BELOVED, fear not. Peace be
[1:10:33] unto thee, BE STRONG. YAY,
[1:10:38] be strong." [snorts]
[1:10:40] And when he had spoken unto me, I was
[1:10:43] strengthened.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:46] So the angel of God, all he had to do
[1:10:50] was look at him and tell him, "Be
[1:10:54] strong."
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; So I wonder if the angels of God would
[1:11:00] say, "Look at us in the last days and
[1:11:03] say, "Be
[1:11:06] raptured."
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Wonder what we would be.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; You tell me.
[1:11:16] SO HE SIMPLY RECEIVED strength by the
[1:11:20] angel of God saying
[1:11:22] be strong don't be afraid.
[1:11:26] Now he said whenever he spoke unto me I
[1:11:29] was strengthened AND SAID LET MY LORD
[1:11:32] speak
[1:11:34] for thou hast strengthened me.
[1:11:39] Oh hallelujah.
[1:11:42] THEN SAID HE KNOWEST THOU WHEREFORE I
[1:11:46] come unto thee, and now I will I return
[1:11:51] to fight with the prince of Persia.
[1:11:57] Now he's going back and Michael is going
[1:12:00] to leave, but Michael won't leave until
[1:12:02] Gabriel gets there. And then Gabriel
[1:12:05] will resume
[1:12:07] what he was doing before. Anointing the
[1:12:10] king, anointing the princes, anointing
[1:12:13] the provincial mayors and all them
[1:12:15] people and the leadership.
[1:12:18] Oh children, I'll tell you one thing. If
[1:12:21] we could just understand the power of
[1:12:23] prayer,
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT? I BELIEVE THAT GOD CAN
[1:12:27] MOVE upon the rulers of this world that
[1:12:30] we live in. I believe that God still can
[1:12:33] be able to move on the president, the
[1:12:36] vice president, senators. That don't
[1:12:39] mean they're full of the Holy Ghost. A
[1:12:40] bit MORE NOTHING. BUT GOD CAN MOVE on
[1:12:43] them. OH, IF WE WOULD ONLY PRAYING IF
[1:12:46] WE'RE NOT CAREFUL. IT'S LIKE WE TAKE
[1:12:48] everything because we believe in
[1:12:49] predestination and election. We take it
[1:12:52] as IF THOUGH EVERYTHING THAT happens to
[1:12:54] us is ordained of God. If you're not
[1:12:56] careful, the devil will pull the wool
[1:12:58] over your eyes, as we say, and he'll ROB
[1:13:00] YOU BLIND OF JOY and many things in your
[1:13:04] life, and you'll say, "Well, it must be
[1:13:06] ordained of God." Don't you believe
[1:13:08] everything that comes from the DEVIL IS
[1:13:10] ORDAINED OF GOD.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my. NOW, NOTICE I He said, "I will
[1:13:18] return and I will fight with the prince
[1:13:21] of Persia. AND WHEN I AM GONE FORTH, now
[1:13:24] watch dispensationally,
[1:13:26] something is fixing to happen. Lo, the
[1:13:29] prince of Grecia
[1:13:32] shall come. A demon for the kingdom of
[1:13:37] the Greeks,
[1:13:39] which by which Alexander the Great will
[1:13:43] operate under.
[1:13:46] Satan had already allocated a demon
[1:13:50] that would be the antor
[1:13:53] of Alexander the Great. And when you
[1:13:55] look at that kingdom within a period of
[1:13:57] 13 years, he absolutely annihilated
[1:14:02] the kingdom of the Miso Persians which
[1:14:06] STRATEGICALLY LOOKING AT IT WITH THE
[1:14:09] NUMBERS 30,000 MEN. [clears throat] WITH
[1:14:12] 30,000 MEN. HE GOES IN AND TEARS UP THAT
[1:14:17] PLACE AND DOES ALL OF THAT. A MAN 33
[1:14:20] YEARS OLD WHENEVER HE DIED. AND HOW IN
[1:14:22] THE WORLD WAS HE ABLE TO DO SUCH?
[1:14:25] Because a mighty DEMON HAD BEEN chosen
[1:14:30] to anoint Alexander and make HIM ONE OF
[1:14:33] THE GREATEST STRATEGISTS THAT THE WORLD
[1:14:35] HAD EVER known when IT COME TO WAR.
[1:14:38] WHERE DID HE GET THAT ABILITY TO FIGHT?
[1:14:41] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; COME FROM THAT DEMON THAT HAD FOUGHT
[1:14:45] against the angels of God. And in 13
[1:14:48] years, he annihilated all that the Mes
[1:14:51] had fought for, ALL THE PERSIANS HAD
[1:14:53] FOUGHT FOR. AND THEN THEY JOINED
[1:14:55] TOGETHER. THEY CALLED IT THE MESO
[1:14:56] PERSIAN. AND ALL OF THAT THAT THEY DONE.
[1:14:59] DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHY? WELL, YOU SAY,
[1:15:01] BROTHER DONNIE, WHY WASN'T IT JUST A
[1:15:03] TRANSFER OF POWER? BECAUSE THEM demons
[1:15:06] can't even get along with one another.
[1:15:09] AMEN.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? THEM DEMONS CANNOT
[1:15:12] EVEN GET ALONG WITH ONE ANOTHER and they
[1:15:15] will fight one another
[1:15:18] or children. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHY
[1:15:21] GOD IS NOT THE AUTHOR OF CONFUSION? AND
[1:15:25] GOD IS NOT THE ONES THAT DIVIDES
[1:15:27] FAMILIES AND COMES IN WITH arguing and
[1:15:30] fussing and debating and churches and
[1:15:32] all that SORT OF THING. THAT'S NOT GOD
[1:15:34] THAT DOES THAT. IT'S A DEVIL.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:38] Oh my. YOU SEE, THE PRINCE OF GRE Grecia
[1:15:42] is the satanic ruler of the Grecian
[1:15:47] Empire and it's ALREADY GOT AN EARTHLY
[1:15:50] counterpart that was chosen which is
[1:15:53] going to be Alexander the Great. NOW
[1:15:57] WATCH IN VERSE 21. BUT I WILL SHOW THEE
[1:16:00] THAT WHICH IS NOTED
[1:16:04] IN THE scripture
[1:16:07] of truth.
[1:16:12] I WILL SHOW THEE THAT which is noted in
[1:16:16] the scripture
[1:16:18] of truth.
[1:16:21] And yet the Bible was not actually put
[1:16:24] together yet.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:29] So it ain't like they had Genesis and
[1:16:31] Exodus and Leviticus and Deuteronomy and
[1:16:33] Judges, you know, Joshua and Judges and
[1:16:35] and Ruth and on and on and on. They had
[1:16:37] this Old Testament said that. No. But
[1:16:40] you see, it was already scripture in the
[1:16:44] mind of God before it ever come on
[1:16:46] paper.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS HIS WORD. OH, THANK YOU, LORD.
[1:16:52] GOD HAS HIS word and he don't add one
[1:16:55] new word to it, but it comes a season
[1:16:58] for it and God lets it loose. SO HE
[1:17:02] SAID, "I'VE COME TO SHOW YOU what is
[1:17:06] noted in the scripture of truth." Now,
[1:17:08] isn't that strange that he would say it
[1:17:10] that way? Because all scripture is
[1:17:12] truth. BUT HE SAID that which is noted.
[1:17:15] WHAT NOTED? WHAT? THAT WHICH was noted
[1:17:18] for his time. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
[1:17:21] FRIEND? THAT'S WHY WE KEEP emphasizing
[1:17:23] the message of the HOUR BECAUSE GOD HAD
[1:17:27] SENT TO US A PROPHET WITH A MESSAGE NOT
[1:17:31] TO REPLACE OUR BIBLE, NOT TO DO AWAY
[1:17:33] with our Bible. We believe in
[1:17:35] justification, sanctification, BAPTISM
[1:17:37] OF THE HOLY GHOST. BUT THERE WAS
[1:17:39] something noted in the scripture OF
[1:17:42] TRUTH FOR THE HOUR THAT WE LIVE IN. And
[1:17:46] Satan couldn't stop IT FOR COMING. BUT
[1:17:48] WHAT'S HE DONE NOW? HE'S CHANGED HIS
[1:17:51] TACTICS. NOW HE WANTS TO TRY TO STRIKE
[1:17:55] THE CREDIBILITY OF THE noted truth of
[1:17:58] this hour AND MAKE PEOPLE DOUBT THAT IT
[1:18:01] WAS REAL. MAKE PEOPLE DOUBT THAT YOU
[1:18:03] EVEN NEED IT. HE'S ONLY GOING BACK in
[1:18:06] reverse and doing what he couldn't do
[1:18:08] years ago. HE COULDN'T STOP IT THEN. AND
[1:18:11] I'LL GO AHEAD AND TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, he
[1:18:13] ain't going to stop it now. He didn't
[1:18:15] stop in the days of Moses. THEY DIDN'T
[1:18:17] STOP IN THE DAYS OF DANIEL AND HE AIN'T
[1:18:20] GOING TO STOP IT NOW CUZ IT'S NOT THE
[1:18:23] IT'S NOT THE BRAND OF MESSAGE. IT'S NOT
[1:18:25] OUR MESSAGE. IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE
[1:18:27] FABRICATED. It's the Lord God's message.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Honest give HIM A HAND.
[1:18:34] CAN we [applause]
[1:18:36] praise the Lord?
[1:18:39] I will show THEE THAT WHICH IS noted in
[1:18:42] the scripture of truth. AND THERE IS
[1:18:44] NONE THAT holdeth with me
[1:18:49] in these things
[1:18:51] but Michael
[1:18:55] your prince.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Michael
[1:19:04] your prince.
[1:19:07] So none OF THE REST OF THE angels
[1:19:11] but Michael
[1:19:13] and Gabriel were illuminated to the
[1:19:17] season. None host with me in these
[1:19:19] things but Michael your prince.
[1:19:24] So who was Michael?
[1:19:27] Christ
[1:19:29] pre-incarnate
[1:19:31] manifestation. It was him that was the
[1:19:34] cloud and the pillar of fire.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; IT WAS HIM THAT [clears throat] was the
[1:19:39] bush. PRAISE THE LORD. CHRIST WAS THE
[1:19:43] prince [snorts] of the kings of the
[1:19:47] earth. He was the prince, protector,
[1:19:53] and guardian of THE JEWISH PEOPLE. HE
[1:19:57] WENT BEFORE THEM in the wilderness.
[1:20:00] That's right. Oh, you say, "I wish he
[1:20:02] was mine." If you're bride, he is.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; NOW, NOTICE THIS GREAT MIGHTY ONE, it is
[1:20:10] he is the only one that shares with me
[1:20:14] in this understanding.
[1:20:17] Now Daniel whenever he's hearing these
[1:20:20] words, YOU IMAGINE AS THE REVELATION
[1:20:23] begins to strike him. So he's he's
[1:20:25] comprehending, okay, I can see that I I
[1:20:28] can see this is a great time and I've
[1:20:29] been been waiting on it trying to
[1:20:31] understand what Jeremiah meant. Is this
[1:20:33] the time, Lord? Is this the season? Or
[1:20:36] is this some type of spiritual
[1:20:38] symbolism? Was the 70 years an actual 70
[1:20:42] years? Or was it um you know a prophetic
[1:20:45] something that didn't actually mean 70,
[1:20:47] but it meant 7,000? And God did IT THAT
[1:20:50] WAY. LORD, I don't know. I DON'T KNOW.
[1:20:52] WHAT time are we in? And then God sends
[1:20:55] him this mighty deliverer to be able to
[1:20:58] help him to understand. SO HE
[1:21:00] STRENGTHENS him in order to be able to
[1:21:04] have the word for the season. that
[1:21:07] Gabriel could strengthen Daniel
[1:21:10] because Michael had strengthened
[1:21:13] Gabriel.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love the divine protocol of God.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? GOD STRENGTHENED
[1:21:21] HIS PROPHET MESSENGER THAT THE PROPHET
[1:21:24] MESSENGER COULD COME ON THE EARTH AND
[1:21:26] BRING A word in season for the hour
[1:21:29] which would in turn STRENGTHEN THE GOD
[1:21:31] CALLED MEN. AND THEN THE GOD CALLED MEN
[1:21:34] WOULD CATCH THE WORD, not their
[1:21:36] revelation, but what was already said.
[1:21:38] THEY WOULD CATCH THAT WORD. AND IF THEY
[1:21:40] WILL GET UP AND PREACH UNDER that same
[1:21:42] anointing, it will bring strength to the
[1:21:45] people to help them face the challenge
[1:21:48] of the hour.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; I LOVE TO PREACH about Shadrach,
[1:21:52] MESHACH, AND ABEDNEGO. I LOVE ALL THEM
[1:21:54] STORIES. BUT a real TRUE MAN OF GOD IS
[1:21:56] GOING TO BRING SHADRACH, MESHACH, AND
[1:21:58] ABEDNEO right up to the present tense
[1:22:00] where we are right now. WHAT GOOD DOES
[1:22:03] IT DO TO TELL YOU THAT HE WAS A GOD THAT
[1:22:05] USED TO MOVE? HE WAS A GOD THAT USED to
[1:22:07] be THE SAME AND SAY, "WELL, he ain't the
[1:22:09] same no MORE." WHAT GOOD'S THAT GOING TO
[1:22:11] DO, brother John? But we NEED TO BRING
[1:22:13] IT RIGHT UP. HOW CAN I DO IT? HOW CAN I
[1:22:16] DO IT WITH ALL THE OPPOSITION? HOW CAN
[1:22:18] OTHER MEN OF GOD DO IT WITH ALL THE
[1:22:19] OPPOSITION? CAUSE AN ANGEL OF GOD
[1:22:22] COMMISSION OUR PROPHET MESSENGER. YOU GO
[1:22:25] THERE AND I WILL BE WITH YOU. NOTHING
[1:22:28] SHALL HINDER YOU. NOT EVEN CANCER.
[1:22:30] YOU'LL CALL A BRIDE OUT. SO ON AND SO
[1:22:33] ON. MINISTERS OF GOD LAY RIGHT THERE AND
[1:22:36] THEY FEED ON THOSE WORDS. HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:38] AND THEY GET STRENGTHENED AND THEY COME
[1:22:40] OUT THOUGH THEY'RE FIGHTING HELL
[1:22:42] EVERYWHERE THEY TURN AND THEY WALK RIGHT
[1:22:44] UP THERE BEHIND THE PULL PIT AND THEY
[1:22:46] CLIMB IN THERE AND SAY, "CHURCH, WE'RE
[1:22:48] MORE THAN CONQUERS. CHURCH, WE CAN FACE
[1:22:51] EVERY STORM. CHURCH, WE CAN BE ABLE TO
[1:22:53] DO WHAT GOD'S CALLED US TO DO. THE
[1:22:55] STRENGTH IS COMING RIGHT ON DOWN. RIGHT
[1:22:58] ON DOWN. RIGHT ON DOWN.
[1:23:02] Praise the Lord. [applause]
[1:23:06] YOU SEE, MICHAEL THE Archangel
[1:23:09] and his angels UNDER HIM FIGHT for the
[1:23:14] elect of God. WE NEED MORE THAN JUST A
[1:23:19] PROPHET. WE NEEDED MORE THAN JUST A
[1:23:22] PASTOR AND AN EVANGELIST. THANK GOD FOR
[1:23:24] EVERY GOD CALLED ONE THAT WE HAVE. BUT
[1:23:27] WE NEEDED beings that would be ABLE TO
[1:23:29] GO IN THAT OTHER realm and be able to
[1:23:33] WORK ON OUR BEHALF WHEN WE COULD NOT GO
[1:23:36] THERE. DANIEL COULD NOT GO INTO THAT
[1:23:39] REALM. BUT GOD already had that took
[1:23:41] care of.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Woo! Praise the Lord.
[1:23:47] Now, let's let's go into this in victory
[1:23:50] day in 1963.
[1:23:53] I'm sure that you you already know it,
[1:23:54] but just just to remind you of it that
[1:23:57] there are national spirits. Now, as
[1:24:02] there are national spirits, so are there
[1:24:05] denominational
[1:24:07] SPIRITS. SO, THAT'S WHY THE CHURCH OF
[1:24:09] CHRIST can fight against the Baptist and
[1:24:11] the Baptist will fight the church of
[1:24:13] Christ. And then, you know, they'll
[1:24:14] fight against a Catholic and fight
[1:24:16] against this and fight against that. But
[1:24:18] yet, they're all under one head,
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; which is the devil. Of course, the
[1:24:22] organized religion I'm talking about.
[1:24:24] Not everybody in there. Some of them
[1:24:26] will come out. BUT UNDER THAT SYSTEM,
[1:24:28] they have one head, but it's divided
[1:24:31] into Catholicism and then Protestants,
[1:24:35] which was the daughters. And then OUT OF
[1:24:37] THAT, THEY'LL FUSS AND FIGHT ON ONE
[1:24:39] ANOTHER. BOY, they'll make a, you know,
[1:24:41] a podcast and they'll blast that church
[1:24:43] and they'll turn right around and blast
[1:24:45] them. And who is it that's doing it?
[1:24:47] It's the devil.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Now, them spirits are divided. SO THAT
[1:24:52] THE SPIRIT THAT WOULD DOMINATE THE
[1:24:55] BAPTIST ORGANIZED religion
[1:24:58] absolutely hates
[1:25:00] the demon that is over the church of
[1:25:03] Christ.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; And the demon over the church of Christ
[1:25:06] hates everybody else anyway. Amen.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; WE SPEAK WHERE THE BIBLE SPEAKS AND
[1:25:11] SILENT WHERE THE BIBLE SILENT.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Sure you are.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE WHAT MAKES THEM DO THAT NOW?
[1:25:18] NOW YOU KNOW IT AS WELL AS I DO THAT THE
[1:25:20] BAPTIST CHURCH, the Baptist theology
[1:25:23] just like the church of Christ.
[1:25:24] Everybody will never be a CHURCH OF
[1:25:26] CHRIST. THE CHURCH OF CHRIST JUST DRAWS
[1:25:29] a certain TYPE OF PEOPLE, A certain
[1:25:32] makeup. You know, a lot of them are
[1:25:33] argumentative. They want to argue and
[1:25:35] they want to, you know, that sort OF
[1:25:36] THING. AND THERE'S OTHERS THAT SAID, "OH
[1:25:38] MAN, I DON'T WANT TO be around nothing
[1:25:39] like that at all. I hate that sort of
[1:25:40] thing." THEY JUST LOVE TO ARGUE. THEY
[1:25:43] JUST LOVE TO DEBATE. BOY, they love to
[1:25:45] get you and they think, "Oh my goodness,
[1:25:46] and rip you up one side and down THE
[1:25:48] OTHER." YOU UNDERSTAND? THEY ARE THE
[1:25:50] EPITOME OF THAT DEMON. THEY ARE
[1:25:53] REFLECTING that demon which motivates
[1:25:56] THE CHURCH OF CHRIST. THEN YOU'VE GOT
[1:25:58] THE SOUTHERN BAPTIST, and then you got
[1:26:00] the free will, of course, and then
[1:26:01] you've got this, and you got that. YOU
[1:26:03] GOT THE PENTECOSTALS, YOU GOT THE ONE
[1:26:04] GOD PENTECOSTAL, then you got the THREE
[1:26:06] GOD PENTECOSTAL AND YOU'VE GOT THEM ALL
[1:26:08] DIVIDED AND THEM demons actually get
[1:26:11] jealous OF ONE ANOTHER. SO YOU CAN
[1:26:13] IMAGINE THEN WHENEVER THE BAPTISTS WILL
[1:26:15] START GROWING AND THEY HAVE BIGGER
[1:26:17] CHURCHES AND ALL THAT SORT of thing that
[1:26:19] the demons in the Methodist church cuz
[1:26:21] for the last how many ever years the
[1:26:23] Methodist church has been going way
[1:26:24] downhill and that demon OF THE METHODIST
[1:26:27] CHURCH I IMAGINE WHEN they all get
[1:26:29] together they're fussing and fighting
[1:26:30] and carrying on and they can't stand
[1:26:32] that Baptist demon AND THAT CHURCH OF
[1:26:34] GOD DEMON LORD HAVE MERCY I CAN'T be
[1:26:37] around that bunch of Nazarines
[1:26:38] [clears throat]
[1:26:39] and they all hate the spirit of God that
[1:26:43] brought this angel's message.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Woo.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; NOW WATCH THE PROPHET. YOU FIND IT
[1:26:53] WHEREVER you go. YOU FIND A NATIONAL
[1:26:56] SPIRIT.
[1:26:58] I went in and they have different ways
[1:27:00] and it's so strange. If I had time, I'd
[1:27:02] like to skip through some of the nations
[1:27:04] and show you. When you go in and you go
[1:27:06] INTO GERMANY, YOU FIND A military
[1:27:08] spirit. Everything is military. You have
[1:27:11] to stand straight, WALK STRAIGHT, CUT
[1:27:13] YOUR CORNERS and everything. It's
[1:27:14] military
[1:27:16] exact perfect match for what was needed
[1:27:20] to anoint Adolf Hitler.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, THAT ANOINTING would have never
[1:27:27] worked in Switzerland
[1:27:30] to bring in the Holocaust. It would have
[1:27:34] never worked in other countries BECAUSE
[1:27:36] THE NATIONAL SPIRIT IS TOTALLY
[1:27:38] DIFFERENT. IT WOULD HAVE NEVER WORKED
[1:27:39] THAT WAY. IT'S OUR WAY OR NO WAY. IT'S
[1:27:42] GOT TO BE THIS. IT'S GOT TO BE THAT.
[1:27:43] WELL, THE PEOPLE ARE natured that way.
[1:27:45] And that anointing sits right down on
[1:27:47] them. And Satan said, "We've got a man.
[1:27:50] We've got a man.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord."
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; You go INTO FRANCE, YOU FIND AN IMMORAL
[1:27:59] SPIRIT, JUST WOMEN AND WINE and liquor
[1:28:02] and stuff like that. YOU GO INTO
[1:28:04] FINLAND, YOU FIND A LOYAL SPIRIT. Kind
[1:28:06] of like everything is honest. We must
[1:28:09] pay off everything. I figure we could
[1:28:11] use a few more fins.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; I'm just saying, you know, WE MUST PAY
[1:28:16] OFF EVERYTHING. SEE, IT MUST BE DONE.
[1:28:18] IT'S JUST GOT TO BE THAT WAY. NO MATTER
[1:28:20] HOW HARD THEY HAVE TO WORK, WHAT IT
[1:28:22] COSTS, IT JUST MUST BE THAT WAY. YOU
[1:28:25] COME INTO AMERICA AND YOU FIND A BIG HA.
[1:28:29] [laughter]
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:35] I BELIEVE FRIENDS, laughter is a good
[1:28:37] medicine. YEAH.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; BUT REMEMBER, THERE'S ALSO a spirit of
[1:28:41] America
[1:28:43] that's ha
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; each of us have to find that place and
[1:28:49] that balance
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; to where we're oh my more godly than
[1:28:55] Americans.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; I believe IN LAUGHING. ABSOLUTELY I do.
[1:29:00] BUT I ALSO KNOW THERE'S AN American
[1:29:03] spirit.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; That American spirit can get on
[1:29:06] preachers in the pullpits.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; And they're more joke tellers than they
[1:29:09] are truth tellers.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Preach, Mother Donnie.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my. NOTICE HE SAID, "SOMEBODY TELL A
[1:29:18] A JOKE." NOTICE THEY SAID THAT'S THE
[1:29:21] AMERICAN SPIRIT.
[1:29:24] The American spirit. SOMEBODY TELL A
[1:29:27] DIRTY JOKE ON THE RADIO AND everybody
[1:29:28] laugh at her. Ernie Ford or some OF THEM
[1:29:30] CRACKING JOKES that they have, you know,
[1:29:32] everywhere. Arthur god FRIEND GROUP LIKE
[1:29:34] THAT. THAT'S THE American spirit. AND
[1:29:37] THEN THOSE SPIRITS get jealous
[1:29:43] of one another.
[1:29:46] Now, I would just like for you to think
[1:29:48] about it, not while I'm preaching
[1:29:51] tomorrow if you want to or something,
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; BUT I'D LIKE FOR you to think of what
[1:29:56] hell must be like
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; for about an hour.
[1:30:02] SO, YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE DEMONS COMING
[1:30:05] from their national drama.
[1:30:10] THEY'RE WORKING THE CYCLE of the END
[1:30:12] TIME. THE PROPHECY OF THE LAST KINGDOM
[1:30:16] laying right before them.
[1:30:19] And they gather down in hell for a demon
[1:30:22] conference
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; AND THEY START TALKING AND THEN THEY
[1:30:29] START RAISING THEIR VOICES.
[1:30:31] THEN THEY START arguing
[1:30:34] and debating and fussing.
[1:30:39] You see, that's one reason why that I
[1:30:41] know that for many of the people who
[1:30:42] have left this message,
[1:30:45] they're not under the leadership of the
[1:30:46] Holy Ghost because they'd rather argue
[1:30:49] than pray.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Tell the truth.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; You see WHAT I'M SAYING? SO THEY MOVED
[1:30:59] OUT FROM UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE HOLY
[1:31:01] Ghost under a spirit that wants to argue
[1:31:05] and fuss and debate and looking for
[1:31:09] mistakes.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; And if you keep going that way, you will
[1:31:16] perfectly fit in the regions of the
[1:31:19] lost.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; There ain't no people like that in
[1:31:24] heaven.
[1:31:26] Amen.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Now watch. Then those spirits get
[1:31:31] jealous of ONE ANOTHER AND WHAT DO THEY
[1:31:33] DO? THEY CAUSE WAR.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; SO IF THE NATIONAL spirits do that, then
[1:31:40] what about the DENOMINATIONAL SPIRITS?
[1:31:43] WHAT ABOUT THE DOCTRINE things that
[1:31:45] we've seen right inside the ranks of our
[1:31:46] message? One doctrine and another and
[1:31:48] another and another. You know, this
[1:31:50] man's got the message of iron. This
[1:31:51] man's the latest, greatest gift of the
[1:31:53] bride. This is the bride's revival. How
[1:31:55] many of them have we had? And what DO
[1:31:57] THEY DO? ALWAYS ISOLATE, pulling people
[1:32:00] away, procolating people, pulling them
[1:32:03] to come over here. Boy, if you ain't
[1:32:05] having meetings like this in your
[1:32:06] church, you better leave your church.
[1:32:08] Well, I find that strange since God's
[1:32:10] prophet said, "You go back to your
[1:32:12] church and bring revival back to your
[1:32:14] church."
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Come on, SOMEBODY.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT IS IT CAUSING WAR? DEBATING IT.
[1:32:23] WHAT HAPPENS in families?
[1:32:25] Oh, now here we're going to really get
[1:32:27] down where the rubber hits the road, I
[1:32:29] guess.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Husbands and wives and children and
[1:32:32] mamas and daddies and BROTHERS AND
[1:32:33] SISTERS FUSSING, ARGUING, FIGHTING.
[1:32:36] WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM? HELL,
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; NOT HEAVEN.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; They cause war. They cause war in
[1:32:47] churches. They cause WAR IN
[1:32:48] DENOMINATION. THEY CAUSE war in nations.
[1:32:51] And they cause war in families.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; That's right. NOW, YOU SEE, EVERY NATION
[1:32:58] IS CONTROLLED BY SATAN.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID, "SO, HE'S THE GOD
[1:33:06] OF THE NATIONS."
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Some of you looked at me strange a while
[1:33:11] ago and I said, "There's two gods."
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; I knew what I was talking about. I just
[1:33:15] knew you waiting. You know, HE'S THE GOD
[1:33:19] OF THE NATIONS. SATAN TOOK JESUS up top
[1:33:22] of the mountain, showed him all the
[1:33:23] kingdoms that was in the world IN A
[1:33:25] MOMENT OF TIME. And when the prophet
[1:33:28] quotes this in the Sue book, he says,
[1:33:29] "What a creature."
[1:33:31] You imagine the devil showing Jesus the
[1:33:33] United States, showing him the kingdoms
[1:33:36] of the world in a moment of time.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my. AND HE SAID, "THESE ARE MINE. I
[1:33:44] DO WITH THEM ANYTHING I WANT TO. I'LL
[1:33:45] GIVE THEM over to you if you worship
[1:33:47] me." Jesus said, "Get behind me, Satan."
[1:33:50] He knew he was going to fall heir to him
[1:33:51] in the millennium. So he didn't have to
[1:33:53] bow down to him. He knew it. AND WHEN
[1:33:55] GOD COMES AGAIN, I love this. MAKES HIS
[1:33:58] KINGDOM HERE, THERE'LL NOT BE ANY
[1:34:00] DIFFERENT KINDS of spirit. Praise the
[1:34:03] Lord. A GERMAN SPIRIT, A FRENCH SPIRIT,
[1:34:06] A NORWEGIAN SPIRIT AND AN AMERICAN
[1:34:10] SPIRIT. THERE WON'T BE THAT. IT'LL BE
[1:34:12] ONE SPIRIT. AMEN. AND HE SAYS, "THE
[1:34:15] SPIRIT OF GOD LIVING IN every heart."
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. AND THERE'LL BE ONE FLAG,
[1:34:23] one nation, ONE PEOPLE, A BROTHERHOOD, a
[1:34:27] fatherhood of God, and a brotherhood of
[1:34:30] men. God hasten the day.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:37] THEN WE FIND BECAUSE PEOPLE DO THIS AND
[1:34:41] CAUSE THESE GREAT FUSSES AND SO FORTH.
[1:34:44] NOW SEE, AS LONG AS SATAN CONTROLS IT,
[1:34:47] THERE'S going to be wars and troubles
[1:34:49] and war. Jesus said in St. John, Matthew
[1:34:53] 24, he said, "You hear of wars and
[1:34:55] rumors of wars and WARS AND WAR." WHY?
[1:34:57] CUZ THE PRINCE of the earth, Satan, the
[1:35:00] power of the nations, there is a
[1:35:02] national spirit, a national spirit. It's
[1:35:05] devils.
[1:35:06] They can't get along
[1:35:09] with one another. That's right.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine no peace in hell?
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Nobody goes around smiling. How are you
[1:35:22] today, brother demon?
[1:35:24] They said, "Get away from me. I don't
[1:35:26] like you. Stay away from me."
[1:35:29] I know a few people like that.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; You ain't under the influence of the
[1:35:37] Holy Ghost and you got that attitude,
[1:35:38] friends.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Fred, I find this astounding in
[1:35:43] the way that he says this. They can't
[1:35:45] get along
[1:35:47] with one another.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; So his kingdom,
[1:35:51] he split away. He split the first
[1:35:54] church. Satan did.
[1:35:58] All the congregants
[1:36:00] were angels.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; The first church worshippers,
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; they was worshiping God. That's how
[1:36:09] that's what made him God because they
[1:36:10] worshiped him and it was what? Angels.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Angels.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, SIR.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; SO, HE SPLIT THE FIRST CHURCH.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; You ever find any scriptures or quotes
[1:36:19] where it teaches us how to scripturally
[1:36:22] split a church?
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Wonder why.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; So, his kingdom then is established upon
[1:36:31] a split.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Rebellion.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. SO WHAT DO YOU FIGURE the
[1:36:38] people in the kingdom are going to do?
[1:36:40] Split
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; hell wide open.
[1:36:45] [screaming]
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; OH MY. COME ON, CHILDREN. THEY ARGUE.
[1:36:50] THEY FUSS. THEY DEBATE. THEY FIGHT.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; UHHUH. YEAH. YEAH.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; AND THEN PEOPLE WANT US TO LEAVE THE
[1:36:59] prince of peace
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; AND GO INTO THIS TO WHERE THESE DEVILS
[1:37:03] CAN'T EVEN GET ALONG WITH one another.
[1:37:05] Come on.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Wow. Paragraph 101. WELL, THAT'S THE
[1:37:12] DEVIL. YOU SEE, HE'S A KILLER.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; The nation. EVEN DEVILS FIGHTING DEVILS.
[1:37:27] But angels of God don't fight
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; angels of God.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. But devils fight devils.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; So when people ARE ALL THE TIME FIGHTING
[1:37:39] AND ARGUING,
[1:37:41] [snorts]
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; wonder whose kingdom they belong to.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; I'm just saying.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:52] [sighs]
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Now notice HE SAID THEY JUST FIGHT
[1:37:57] ONE ANOTHER. When brother B says this,
[1:38:00] he he he mentions about the Siberian
[1:38:02] huskys and he said that whenever they
[1:38:05] would, you know, they got them them
[1:38:07] huskys in the in the harness and they'll
[1:38:09] pull that dog sled and they've got their
[1:38:10] mouths all taped up, you know, or
[1:38:12] whatever and then they kind of keep them
[1:38:15] APART. BUT HE SAID WHENEVER THEY TAKE
[1:38:17] THEM OUT, THEY'VE GOT A CHAIN OF one
[1:38:19] over here and one over there and one
[1:38:20] over there. He said they're so full of
[1:38:22] the devil. That's what he said. THEY'RE
[1:38:24] SO FULL OF THE DEVIL THAT KILL ONE
[1:38:26] ANOTHER.
[1:38:28] AND YOU THINK, MY GOODNESS. SO, SATAN
[1:38:31] Satan harnesses these demons
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; AND THEY THEY CARRY OUT PART OF HIS
[1:38:40] mission
[1:38:41] and AT THE SAME TIME THEY CAN'T STAND
[1:38:44] one another. Yeah.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine walking away from the
[1:38:51] fountain of pure love
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; and leaving a kingdom that was so
[1:38:58] sublime
[1:39:00] and you walk in to this
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; that I've read to you tonight?
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Can I have a few more minutes? Matthew
[1:39:13] 12:43.
[1:39:15] When the unclean spirit has gone out of
[1:39:18] a man,
[1:39:20] he walketh through
[1:39:23] dry places.
[1:39:26] Huh?
[1:39:29] So a demon leaves
[1:39:32] out of an individual
[1:39:35] and Jesus now remember so he would know
[1:39:38] this these things.
[1:39:41] JESUS DESCRIBES THAT DEVIL whenever it
[1:39:43] would go out of a human body
[1:39:48] into this sphere.
[1:39:51] Jesus calls it a dry place.
[1:39:55] So it WOULD BE A THIRSTY PLACE.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; A PLACE THAT THIS demon
[1:40:02] is not being satisfied.
[1:40:07] HE WALKETH THROUGH DRY PLACES.
[1:40:11] Now notice what Jesus said then that
[1:40:13] these disembodied spirits do
[1:40:17] seeking
[1:40:19] rest.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:40:23] They are tormented
[1:40:26] beings.
[1:40:29] Wonder why, friends, for many of these
[1:40:30] folks that have left the message, wonder
[1:40:33] why they have turned into such tormented
[1:40:35] creatures.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; No matter what they do, where they go,
[1:40:39] where they wind up, it's like they're
[1:40:42] tormented.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Now, these are the words of Jesus. When
[1:40:50] the unclean spirit goes OUT OF A MAN, HE
[1:40:53] WALKETH THROUGH DRY places seeking rest.
[1:40:59] You mean a demon
[1:41:01] would want rest.
[1:41:04] Look at the word rest.
[1:41:07] Intermission.
[1:41:08] Everybody knows what that is, right?
[1:41:10] Intermission.
[1:41:12] Cessation of any motion,
[1:41:16] business or labor.
[1:41:19] recreation.
[1:41:21] So the devils are seeking recreation.
[1:41:25] But notice
[1:41:27] it don't say they were seeking that when
[1:41:29] they were in a human body,
[1:41:33] but once they went out of the human
[1:41:36] body.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now remember this demon and this
[1:41:40] scenario the way the Lord Jesus gives it
[1:41:43] was not cast out
[1:41:47] but he left of his own accord. Now watch
[1:41:50] how these demons will do.
[1:41:54] They know that if they leave on their
[1:41:56] own accord they can come back when they
[1:41:59] want to.
[1:42:01] If they're cast out,
[1:42:04] they cannot do it until that person is
[1:42:07] willing to let them back in because they
[1:42:10] were made to leave. Yeah.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; I wonder
[1:42:16] I wonder
[1:42:19] as they watch God's program down through
[1:42:22] the ages and seeing the spirit of God
[1:42:24] dealing with humans hearts
[1:42:27] and they can see the spirit of God is
[1:42:29] drawing them and moving on them the way
[1:42:32] he did Cyrus and the princes of Persia
[1:42:34] and all of that.
[1:42:36] And that demon pulls a fast one and
[1:42:39] says, "I better get out of here while
[1:42:41] the getting's good."
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Because if I leave first,
[1:42:47] I can come back
[1:42:50] at my will.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; So that demon will leave that
[1:42:58] individual. So say they go to a Baptist
[1:43:00] church, a Methodist church, Pentecostal
[1:43:02] church, word of life church, whatever it
[1:43:05] is.
[1:43:06] And whenever THEY COME, THEY FEEL SO
[1:43:09] WONDERFUL
[1:43:11] AND SOMETHING UNBELIEVABLE happened to
[1:43:14] them.
[1:43:15] Lord, children, may God open our ears
[1:43:18] tonight.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; AND SOMETHING TREMENDOUS happened
[1:43:25] and they're thinking they got born
[1:43:28] again.
[1:43:31] But what happened was that demon simply
[1:43:34] made a fast exit.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; When the unclean spirit is gone out of a
[1:43:41] man, he walketh through dry places
[1:43:44] seeking rest. Notice how Jesus said
[1:43:48] this. And findeth none.
[1:43:51] YOU UNDERSTAND THAT SATAN AND HIS demons
[1:43:54] are restless,
[1:43:57] unqued spirits.
[1:44:01] LORD
[1:44:04] BEING CAST OUT of heaven,
[1:44:07] THE ONLY PLACE THEY CAN find
[1:44:11] intermission,
[1:44:13] what they perceive as rest,
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; is when they're in human bodies
[1:44:20] and taking the joy of them humans.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Wow. taking the peace of them humans,
[1:44:26] causing them humans to drink and lie
[1:44:29] and, you know, just break God's WORD AND
[1:44:31] ALL THAT. THAT'S THEIR that's their
[1:44:34] entertainment.
[1:44:37] THEY'RE POWERLESS WITHOUT LIVING IN a
[1:44:40] human body.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THEY GO OUT, I MEAN, THEY'RE
[1:44:44] WALKING AND THEY'RE going here and
[1:44:45] there. I I can't stand it. I CAN'T STAND
[1:44:48] IT. I'VE GOT TO HAVE SOME REST. I'VE GOT
[1:44:50] TO HAVE SOME REST.
[1:44:53] SO THEY GO BACK AND GET INSIDE THEM
[1:44:55] BODIES AND WHATEVER THEY TELL THEM
[1:44:57] DRINK. WHY? HEY, THAT WOMAN'S SMILING
[1:44:59] AND SHE SMILE BACK AT HER. GET HER PHONE
[1:45:01] NUMBER. DO THIS. THAT'S WHEN THEY'RE
[1:45:03] actually
[1:45:05] in the only rest they can get.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm so glad the one that used to
[1:45:19] live in me before I got saved and had
[1:45:22] not another nar and another day of rest.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; But I SURE HAVE. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:33] AND THE DEVIL WANTS TO CONVINCE YOU HE'S
[1:45:35] GOT SO MUCH TO OFFER YOU. LOOK AT THE
[1:45:38] KINGDOM THEY LIVE IN, SAINTS.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; They have no peace. Amen.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Speak to us, Lord God.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, THESE DEMONS HAVE NO
[1:45:58] contentment
[1:46:00] or satisfaction until they return
[1:46:03] into that human body. Remember the the
[1:46:06] demons that was cast out of the man and
[1:46:07] they said they asked Jesus, "Let us go
[1:46:10] into the hogs."
[1:46:12] when we don't don't cast us out into the
[1:46:14] deep. Please don't cast us out into the
[1:46:15] deep.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Let us go into the hogs.
[1:46:20] YOU SEE, THEY RETURN INTO their mire
[1:46:23] and their filth.
[1:46:26] It's the only rest they have.
[1:46:30] Lord God,
[1:46:33] HIS VIEW IN WALKING in these places
[1:46:37] among such people
[1:46:40] is rest.
[1:46:43] Lord God,
[1:46:46] think of what we'd be tonight, friends,
[1:46:49] if it wasn't for the spirit of God.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; IF GOD HAD NOT GIVE US REST. DON'T YOU
[1:46:54] SEE THAT THE AGE is becoming the epitome
[1:46:57] of these demons?
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Look at MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE
[1:47:02] LEFT THE WORD, the revealed WORD OF THE
[1:47:03] HOUR. LOOK AT THEM. THEY'RE MISERABLE.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; I AIN'T GOT FACEBOOK. I DON'T WANT IT.
[1:47:08] BUT SOME OF THE STUFF I HEAR the people
[1:47:10] say left the message OF THE HOUR. MY
[1:47:12] GOODNESS. THINGS THEY CALL their
[1:47:14] parents, THINGS THEY CALL THE PREACHER
[1:47:16] where they went to church and this and
[1:47:17] that and the other. AND WHENEVER I'VE
[1:47:19] READ STUFF LIKE THIS, I THINK, LORD GOD,
[1:47:21] IT'S THE EPITOME.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE EPITOME. THEY HAVE NO REST.
[1:47:26] THOUGH THEY SAY THEY'RE FREE. We don't
[1:47:28] have to do this and we don't have to.
[1:47:29] BOY, I'M FREE. I'M FREE.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; NO, you're not.
[1:47:34] No, you're not. You have no rest, no
[1:47:37] satisfaction.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Notice in Job chapter 1 verse 7, and the
[1:47:46] Lord said unto Satan, "Whence comest
[1:47:48] thou?"
[1:47:50] Then Satan answered the Lord and said,
[1:47:52] "FROM GOING TO AND fro
[1:47:55] in the earth and from walking up and
[1:47:59] down in it,
[1:48:03] a restless
[1:48:04] evil.
[1:48:08] Walking up and down, going here, going
[1:48:10] there, looking, searching, looking."
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; You've got it now, devil. What you going
[1:48:17] to do with it? You can't even enjoy it,
[1:48:21] can you?
[1:48:25] Look again in Job chapter 2 verse 2. And
[1:48:28] the Lord said unto Satan, "From whence
[1:48:29] cometh down Satan answered the Lord and
[1:48:31] said, from going TO AND FRO IN THE earth
[1:48:34] and from walking up and down in it." 1
[1:48:36] Peter 5:8, "Be sober, be vigilant,
[1:48:39] because your adversary, the devil, as a
[1:48:42] roaring lion,
[1:48:44] walkest about
[1:48:46] seeking whom he may devour."
[1:48:51] You see, that's why people that pulled
[1:48:53] away from the word in every age that
[1:48:55] they've done it, whether it was Dayan
[1:48:56] and Kora, Byum, whoever it was, same in
[1:48:59] our age, what do they do once they leave
[1:49:02] the word? They get this walking about
[1:49:05] thing on them and they want to talk to
[1:49:07] you and talk to you and talk to you and
[1:49:09] pull ON YOU AND PULL ON YOU. DON'T YOU
[1:49:11] SEE WHERE THEY'RE GETTING THEIR
[1:49:12] inspiration from?
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; AS HE WALKS ABOUT SEEKING WHOM HE MAY
[1:49:20] DEVOUR.
[1:49:24] Lord Jesus, [snorts]
[1:49:27] A FALLEN CORRUPT spirit
[1:49:32] can have no rest.
[1:49:35] But in a polluted human heart,
[1:49:42] aren't you glad you've got a heart
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; that the devil wouldn't feel it on me?
[1:49:46] [laughter]
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, LORD.
[1:49:54] THE CORRUPTION OF THE ONE IS SUITED TO
[1:49:57] THE other
[1:50:00] as like beggets like.
[1:50:05] Notice, let me close here momentarily.
[1:50:08] And verse 44,
[1:50:10] then he saith, so the unclean spirit
[1:50:12] goes out of a man, and he walketh
[1:50:14] through dry places, seek and rest, and
[1:50:16] findeth none. Now verse 44, THEN HE
[1:50:18] SAITH, I WILL RETURN.
[1:50:21] Notice his claim
[1:50:24] into [clears throat]
[1:50:26] my house. [snorts]
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; You see, the title deed had not been
[1:50:34] released,
[1:50:37] he still claimed it.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; As his
[1:50:43] Lord Jesus had moved in with the Holy
[1:50:45] Ghost, he could have not said that.
[1:50:49] That's right.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Think about it, friends.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; I will return into my house from whence
[1:50:58] I came out.
[1:51:00] And when he has come, notice what he
[1:51:02] finds now. He findeth it empty,
[1:51:08] swept,
[1:51:10] and garnished.
[1:51:13] First word that Jesus used though
[1:51:16] was empty.
[1:51:20] swept.
[1:51:22] Why did it need to be swept? Cuz it was
[1:51:25] a mess.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; SWIPE OUT THE CIGARETTES. SWEEP OUT ALL
[1:51:30] THE illicit this and that and the other
[1:51:32] wrong, you know, books and movies and
[1:51:34] all of that filth that a Christian
[1:51:36] should not even be able to be involved
[1:51:38] in at all. Come on, somebody say amen.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; And the SPIRIT OF GOD SWEEPS IT OUT.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; And then notice it garnishes it. This
[1:51:47] this word is phenomenal.
[1:51:49] Adorn
[1:51:52] to put in order, arrange,
[1:51:56] make ready,
[1:51:58] prepare.
[1:52:01] But the key word is the first one,
[1:52:04] empty.
[1:52:06] So a person can be empty and still be
[1:52:09] adorned and arranged and in order
[1:52:14] and prepared and they think, "I'M READY.
[1:52:16] I'M READY. PRAISE GOD."
[1:52:19] But they're as empty as they can be.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Empty,
[1:52:28] swept,
[1:52:31] and garnished.
[1:52:33] The word garnest also means to ornament,
[1:52:36] adore. Metaphorically, it's to embellish
[1:52:40] with honor.
[1:52:44] What is this? A life of a person that
[1:52:46] got saved. And sounds like brother Ben
[1:52:49] even sanctified.
[1:52:51] GOD DONE GREAT THINGS FOR THIS
[1:52:53] INDIVIDUAL.
[1:52:55] And let me read it to you in the
[1:52:57] prophet's words and we'll close from
[1:52:58] here.
[1:53:00] Sometimes [snorts] the spirit gets real
[1:53:02] contrary.
[1:53:04] They just don't want to come at all. And
[1:53:06] that's the time you have to have an
[1:53:07] authority. Do you believe that? Now
[1:53:09] there's sometimes if a person's faith
[1:53:12] will come up, maybe they don't have
[1:53:13] enough faith and it's just waving there.
[1:53:18] And there's a demon trying to hold maybe
[1:53:20] a little of unbelief there. Just kind of
[1:53:23] skeptical. Sometimes you have to command
[1:53:26] it out. And if you do that, then they're
[1:53:29] angry.
[1:53:32] That's when they go
[1:53:34] from one to another.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; And when they come out, you know, Jesus
[1:53:40] said them demons come out and said
[1:53:41] sufferers are going to the swine. See, a
[1:53:43] devil is helpless
[1:53:47] if he isn't in a body somewhere.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; He's just a spirit in the world until
[1:53:55] he's in a body. No rest. You see,
[1:54:00] no rest.
[1:54:03] He can torment us.
[1:54:06] Notice he said, listen what Jesus said.
[1:54:09] When the deaf spirit went out of the
[1:54:11] man, he could hear. When the deaf
[1:54:13] spirit, when the dumb spirit went out,
[1:54:15] the child, he could speak. And when
[1:54:17] demons when they come out, demons are
[1:54:19] helpless
[1:54:21] unless they are embodied.
[1:54:23] Look at the de demon that Jesus met at
[1:54:27] Gadra said sufferers to go into the
[1:54:29] swine
[1:54:31] without a body. Jesus said go and the
[1:54:33] swine went into fits that was in the
[1:54:36] maniac and down into the sea. They went
[1:54:39] and drowned in fits [snorts] just like
[1:54:43] the man did.
[1:54:46] And in studying this verse of scripture,
[1:54:48] I found this in a Bible concordance.
[1:54:50] It's called Williams Bible, Wilmington's
[1:54:54] rather Bible handbook. I thought it was
[1:54:56] just so wonderful. I want to share it
[1:54:57] with you. Reformation
[1:55:00] minus regeneration
[1:55:04] means condemnation.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Reformation minus regeneration
[1:55:12] means
[1:55:14] condemnation.
[1:55:17] Oh my.
[1:55:20] Help us, Lord.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Look, children, we we can't do this on
[1:55:25] our own.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; This is way too strong for us.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Way too powerful.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; But with Jesus in us, we can meet the
[1:55:37] challenge of the day.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our head, shall we?
[1:55:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:55:51] Oh my. I'm not here tonight to preach
[1:55:54] these things to you to scare you or
[1:55:56] frighten you or anything like that,
[1:55:58] [cough] but just so [clears throat] we
[1:55:59] can see what we are dealing with
[1:56:04] and know that these demons
[1:56:06] [clears throat]
[1:56:07] that we're talking about tonight, they
[1:56:09] have they have been in this battle for
[1:56:12] thousands of years.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; They have taken down many, many people.
[1:56:20] Us on our own, we're no match for them.
[1:56:24] But with Jesus in us, as I've already
[1:56:26] quoted it to you, greater is he that is
[1:56:28] in us than he that is in the world.
[1:56:33] And what does it produce in people who
[1:56:35] walk away from the word? Arguing,
[1:56:38] fussing, fighting, hate.
[1:56:41] I've dealt with some of these people who
[1:56:42] have left the message. Not all of them,
[1:56:44] but many of the ones that I have talked
[1:56:45] to and dealt with by emails.
[1:56:48] I have never dealt with people with such
[1:56:50] spirits on them.
[1:56:52] They hate the prophet. They hate the
[1:56:54] message. They hate you. They hate every
[1:56:57] preacher that preaches it.
[1:57:01] And it's like they have come under an
[1:57:03] anointing.
[1:57:05] An anointing to destroy.
[1:57:09] an anointing not to heal, an anointing
[1:57:12] not to pray for us if we're so blind.
[1:57:15] Then show us more of Jesus.
[1:57:19] Give us more than what we've got.
[1:57:23] Ain't nobody going to win me by hatred.
[1:57:26] And the church said,
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; the Bible says God is love. The Bible
[1:57:30] doesn't say God is hate.
[1:57:35] Can't you see these two heads
[1:57:37] are coming to their fullness?
[1:57:41] The God of this evil age is releasing
[1:57:44] more and more demons. Remember the
[1:57:48] prophet tells us in 1961, I think it was
[1:57:50] that the lid had been tore off of the
[1:57:52] kettle and demon powers are streaming in
[1:57:55] every direction.
[1:57:58] But also the power of God has been
[1:58:00] released.
[1:58:02] Praise the Lord.
[1:58:04] God is wanting his people to take on his
[1:58:07] image. And what image is that, brother
[1:58:09] Donnie? The stature of a perfect man.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:58:14] Satan wants his people to take on his
[1:58:17] image.
[1:58:19] It will be a mark, a mark of the beast.
[1:58:22] What is that mark? Protestantism.
[1:58:26] Made light to the image of the of
[1:58:28] Revelation 17.
[1:58:32] And they will force everyone on the
[1:58:33] earth that's left to take that mark or
[1:58:36] they cannot buy or sell.
[1:58:39] Can't you see that same spirit right
[1:58:41] around the message of the hour? Well, if
[1:58:43] you don't believe what we believe and
[1:58:44] preach what we preach, you're not even
[1:58:45] in the bride. You can't be the bride's
[1:58:47] revival. That's not the spirit of God
[1:58:49] people are working under.
[1:58:53] Lord have mercy, children. May God help
[1:58:56] us.
[1:58:59] How many wants to be more like Jesus?
[1:59:02] I don't mind telling you, I've dealt
[1:59:04] with demons for many years
[1:59:06] [clears throat] of my life. Seen them,
[1:59:08] seen them physically.
[1:59:10] I don't want nothing to do with them. I
[1:59:13] sure don't want them things living in my
[1:59:15] body.
[1:59:17] Driving me out of my mind,
[1:59:20] making me hate and destroy
[1:59:24] and want to annihilate. No. and have no
[1:59:28] rest, no peace.
[1:59:32] I just wonder what it's like down in
[1:59:35] hell for a little while.
[1:59:39] We can see
[1:59:41] the violence that's coming on the earth.
[1:59:44] We can see these demons in these cities,
[1:59:48] how these people are protesting and
[1:59:50] rioting, killing, mutilating,
[1:59:53] destroying. We can see this anti-semite
[1:59:57] thing that's around the world. Friends,
[1:59:59] can't you see it? You just heard about
[2:00:01] it in Australia.
[2:00:05] The FBI just stopped
[2:00:08] some ISIS recruits out in Los Angeles.
[2:00:14] They're already saying in Europe
[2:00:17] that during Christmas time that the
[2:00:19] chatter on the internet
[2:00:22] that ISIS
[2:00:24] and these Islamic people
[2:00:27] are going to kill and destroy. Why?
[2:00:30] That's the demon. Study the life of
[2:00:33] Muhammad.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; He mutilated. He raped. He murdered.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; You want to follow a man like that?
[2:00:41] There's something mentally wrong with
[2:00:42] you.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; That man married a six year old girl.
[2:00:48] Six years old
[2:00:50] and consummated the marriage when she
[2:00:52] was nine.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; You imagine having sex with a 9-year-old
[2:00:57] girl.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; And that's a prophet.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; He's a prophet. All right. A false one.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Anointed with demons out of hell.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Donnie, be careful. No, I'm
[2:01:09] not going to be careful. I'm going to
[2:01:10] tell you the truth.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; The truth is what'll make you free, not
[2:01:14] compromise.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; I realize we got message preachers.
[2:01:17] Everybody's on YouTube and everybody's
[2:01:19] streaming and more gets on YouTube. And
[2:01:21] the more streams, the less we're talking
[2:01:23] about it, the less we're preaching and
[2:01:25] declaring it. I wonder how long it'll be
[2:01:27] before message preachers will even be
[2:01:29] preaching against sin.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; Well, if YouTube kicks us off, so be it.
[2:01:33] If I've got to stay on YouTube and I got
[2:01:35] to compromise to do it, let's get off of
[2:01:38] it oursel. Amen.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody say amen.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; THE TRUTH IS WHAT'S GOING TO GET US OUT
[2:01:44] OF HERE. THE SPIRIT OF GOD WILL RAISE UP
[2:01:47] A STANDARD AGAINST THE kingdom of hell.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:56] Thank you.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; Help us tonight, Father.
[2:02:04] Lord God, I pray for every man, woman,
[2:02:06] boy, and girl that's in divine presence.
[2:02:11] I pray for those, Lord, that were sick
[2:02:13] and couldn't come to church. Those,
[2:02:15] Lord, that live in different parts of
[2:02:16] the world and
[2:02:19] they'll stream or archive this service.
[2:02:23] Dear Jesus, keep us in this hour.
[2:02:27] Father,
[2:02:30] either the God of this evil age or the
[2:02:33] God of eternity
[2:02:35] is going to dominate our lives.
[2:02:38] Every person in this building is going
[2:02:40] to be under the control of one or the
[2:02:42] other.
[2:02:43] Our president, our Congress, our Senate,
[2:02:47] our Congress people will fight and fuss
[2:02:49] and argue and go back and forth and we
[2:02:52] see some of them things the way they do
[2:02:54] and they hate one another.
[2:02:57] and they're on the same side
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; and don't even know it,
[2:03:02] but they can hate one another and still
[2:03:04] be under the same king
[2:03:07] because that's the way his demons are.
[2:03:11] But yet John told us,
[2:03:14] "If a man hates his brother,
[2:03:17] he does not have eternal life abiding in
[2:03:20] him, for he is a murderer.
[2:03:24] And a man cannot be a murderer and hate
[2:03:26] his brother.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; We can disagree. We can have points of
[2:03:31] doctrine that would bitterly disagree.
[2:03:34] But since we're part of the kingdom of
[2:03:36] light, we cannot hate one another.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; And by this shall all men know that ye
[2:03:44] are my disciples when you have love one
[2:03:48] for another.
[2:03:50] But demons are known for their
[2:03:52] corruption and the rottness.
[2:03:55] But they're also known
[2:03:57] for their hatred.
[2:04:00] They hate their own kind. They hate
[2:04:03] their own soldiers. They hate the people
[2:04:06] they live in. And their only fun and
[2:04:10] pleasure
[2:04:12] is robbing people of their happiness
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; and their health.
[2:04:18] When demons want rest,
[2:04:21] they take people's
[2:04:23] pleasure out of life,
[2:04:26] that's the only rest them tormented
[2:04:29] devils know.
[2:04:32] Oh, and when the Holy Spirit wants rest
[2:04:34] and peace,
[2:04:36] he lives in a human heart.
[2:04:41] This is my rest. That's what you
[2:04:43] prophesied in Isaiah. This is the rest.
[2:04:48] Jesus said, "My peace
[2:04:51] I leave with you."
[2:04:54] But Satan takes the peace of his people.
[2:04:58] But Jesus gives us his peace back.
[2:05:03] You settle our unrest and our
[2:05:06] uneasiness.
[2:05:08] And you make us calm
[2:05:10] even in our greatest trials.
[2:05:14] Hell is at the boiling point. America's
[2:05:18] at the boiling point. The world,
[2:05:20] families.
[2:05:24] Lord Jesus,
[2:05:26] help us. Father,
[2:05:29] we love you, Father God.
[2:05:33] Would you move in every heart you're
[2:05:35] present tonight, Jesus?
[2:05:38] You can start with me or you can save me
[2:05:40] to the last. I don't care how you do it.
[2:05:43] But move in me, Lord.
[2:05:47] Keep me from hatred.
[2:05:50] Keep me from evil.
[2:05:53] I know only way a lot of people identify
[2:05:55] evil as women cutting their hair and
[2:05:57] wearing pants and all that sort of
[2:05:59] thing. Oh, but some of the most evil
[2:06:02] people I've ever seen was those that was
[2:06:05] religious as they could be.
[2:06:09] Lord God, we don't want to be just
[2:06:11] religious. We want to be saved,
[2:06:14] sanctified,
[2:06:17] filled with the Holy Ghost.
[2:06:20] So if that devil that used to live in us
[2:06:24] come back to the house to inspect it,
[2:06:27] first thing he's going to find is
[2:06:29] there's a sign on the door. No vacancy.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:06:37] There's no sign on our door to let for
[2:06:42] rent for lease.
[2:06:46] And the reason he can know that is is
[2:06:48] because your name revealed by the word
[2:06:51] of the hour is applied over our heart.
[2:06:57] That's what the prophet said when they
[2:06:58] took the blood and they rubbed it there
[2:07:00] in Egypt.
[2:07:02] They took that blood of the lamb and
[2:07:03] they rubbed it over the mantle and over
[2:07:04] the doorpost because he said that's
[2:07:07] where the name of the people were. So
[2:07:09] they took the blood of the lamb and they
[2:07:11] rubbed up that lentil and they rubbed
[2:07:13] right over the name of that individual
[2:07:15] and their name was covered in the blood.
[2:07:19] So Lord, it ain't Donnie. It ain't
[2:07:20] Harry. It ain't Daryl, Jim, Joel, Fred,
[2:07:22] Susie, Carol. It's your name. and the
[2:07:26] word interpreted as the manifestation
[2:07:30] of the name of God.
[2:07:33] So he comes that old drinking devil,
[2:07:36] that old lion devil, whatever he was. He
[2:07:39] said, "Well, I can't get back in there.
[2:07:40] There ain't no room." No, sir, devil. We
[2:07:42] ain't got one stack of room. We ain't
[2:07:43] got a closet. We ain't got a cabinet. We
[2:07:46] ain't got a drawer. We want our drawers
[2:07:48] full of goodness. We want our closet.
[2:07:50] And we want everything about us. Oh,
[2:07:52] hallelujah. We want the basement. We
[2:07:54] want the attic. We want to every every
[2:07:57] place in us so full of the love of God
[2:07:59] there ain't no room for no devils.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:08:05] We worship you [laughter] Jesus.
[2:08:09] Can we stand there for you children?
[2:08:14] Hallelujah.
[2:08:16] Hallelujah.
[2:08:19] One of the brothers come up here Sunday
[2:08:21] for prayer. He's right here tonight
[2:08:23] looking at me. He said, "Brother Donnie,
[2:08:26] you know how it felt when you first got
[2:08:27] saved?" I said, "Yes, sir. I sure do. I
[2:08:29] remember that, brother." He said, "I
[2:08:31] just been wanting that so bad. I've just
[2:08:33] been praying."
[2:08:35] And I said, "You remember before the
[2:08:36] prophet left the earth about a month, he
[2:08:38] said he longed to feel like he did when
[2:08:40] he first got saved and them mountaintop
[2:08:42] experiences." And I tell him, I said,
[2:08:44] "This is just my own belief, but I
[2:08:47] believe that's the kind of shape the
[2:08:48] bride's going to be in before she leaves
[2:08:50] this world.
[2:08:52] That first love will restrike her.
[2:08:56] She'll just love him so much and things
[2:08:59] will be of less value. We will use as we
[2:09:02] preach Sunday but not abusing this world
[2:09:07] and we just love him so much
[2:09:10] and it's automatic. The more you love
[2:09:12] him,
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; the more you'll love one another.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Remember the last virtue right next to
[2:09:18] charity is what? healing, miracles,
[2:09:21] signs, wonders, speaking in tongues,
[2:09:23] visions,
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; brotherly kindness.
[2:09:28] Charity will set right on top of our
[2:09:32] brotherly kindness. The very last virtue
[2:09:35] to be produced in its full
[2:09:36] manifestation, the sevenths that will
[2:09:39] fall right into the eighth, brotherly
[2:09:43] kindness. He knew exactly where to put
[2:09:46] it.
[2:09:48] I mean, he loves him tonight. sing
[2:09:49] something for us. Hey, can we just
[2:09:50] worship the Lord? I know you got to work
[2:09:52] tomorrow and your kids have got school
[2:09:54] and stuff like that. If you if you need
[2:09:55] to go, feel free to go.
[2:09:58] I just like to worship him a little
[2:10:00] before we go.
[2:10:02] I think of what I could be tonight.
[2:10:06] I could have been an empty house.
[2:10:09] As I look back and realize when I was in
[2:10:11] Pentecost, my soul wasn't sealed. Well,
[2:10:14] I had a baptism of the Holy Ghost. Yeah.
[2:10:16] spoke in tongues, run, shouted, cast out
[2:10:18] devils, all kinds of things, but I
[2:10:20] wasn't sealed.
[2:10:23] But thank God he kept me from that evil
[2:10:25] thing coming back in me.
[2:10:28] Praise God. And if you're not sealed
[2:10:30] tonight, friend, you can before you
[2:10:32] leave this place.
[2:10:35] You don't want to be empty. You want to
[2:10:37] be full. Full. Be ye filled with the
[2:10:42] spirit.
[2:10:45] Let's just worship him together.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; We need you, [singing] Lord,
