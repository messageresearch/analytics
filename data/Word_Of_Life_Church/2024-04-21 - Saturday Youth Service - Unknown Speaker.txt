he's pouring out on us yes he's pouring out on us oh he pouring out on us [Music] [Applause] sure can say today that God has poured out his Mercy on each of us where would we be without it we so counted an honor and a privilege for us to be gathered together again here today again we'd like to express our appreciation for those of you that have come and been able to participate in the service trust you enjoyed the banquet last night those of you that were here all the preparation that they made and brother Andrew just did an outstanding job didn't he just so appreciate the word can we just stand together we'll ask brother Andrew if you'll come speak to us again this morning we want to just open our hearts today to see what the Lord has for us you come from different states and different provinces in Canada and no doubt the battles you face are very similar in some ways and very different in other ways but we know that our God is so mindful of us in the age that we're living you young people face things that no other generation ever faced we know in the days of the early church it would have been martyrdom as a matter of fact we have one record of of a sister named Sosa you can find this in Fox's book of Martyrs and a couple of historical places she had seven sons they took the oldest dismembered him they took the second one cut his bowels out on down one to another another to another for the cause of the Lord Jesus so even though more than likely most of you will never face such things but you're facing a different type of a battle yours is mental yours is going through the pure pressure and all the pressure that Satan has been able to turn up in this day and you may thinking yourself how will I ever be able to stand with people like that but in reality you're living in the most difficult age that's ever been and the same spirit of God that released an anointing to help those people I've often wondered what sister Sosa had to say when she went back to church and all the saints heard that her seven sons have been killed horribly I've wondered what her testimony would have been you imagine trying to get up and testify and say I want to thank God for his Mercy I want to thank God for his grace and all seven of your sons have been killed for the cause of Jesus Christ so remember he's mindful of what you go through as well and the anointing of God that was released in that day helped those young men to be able to give their lives and help that mother to be able to go back to church and say I don't understand why maybe some of you are here today and you have wies and wherefores and things that you don't understand and God doesn't promise that we'll understand all that comes our way but he promises I'll be with you and I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you so as we approach the service today may you be able to pull on the gift of God and I want to say what um what an awesome time that it's been and I've asked the ministers as far as how it's been for them to be able to preach and and so on and both of our brothers have said that there's been a really wonderful pull and we're grateful for that that comes from you you see the pull don't come from them and the pull don't come from God and the pull don't come from Angels the pull comes from you so you have a need and you're pulling God help me God speak to me God give give me what I need that's your participation these meetings would be nothing or any others that you go to if it was not for you being there to be able to pull so whatever you need today we just want to approach the Lord together and ask him to come and use our brother and speak through him the words that we need how many has a need today in your life maybe it's Financial maybe it's physical maybe it's decisions that you got to make about your future but when know the Lord Jesus is mindful of us let's just sing together touching Jesus is all that matters and remember no matter how educated you might be how long you've been serving the lord how long you've been a Christian you might know the message so well you can quote the prophet word for word and all that is good we're grateful that you can do that but remember in the New Testament the four Gospels it was not the educated it was not the weal y the ultra Rich it was not those that kept every law every letter of the law that we have the descriptions of That was able to touch Jesus but it was those who believed him some had all those great attributes and they didn't believe him at all so whatever your need is today brother Ron Spencer and I have been texting back and forth before we come out in the meetings the meeting began this morning and he was telling me he said I feel like these types of of meetings help our young people to realize they have value in the eyes of God and in case you're wondering today I Echo that same feeling you have great value in the eyes of God God could have allowed you to live in the first age second age third age days of Noah whatever day it would have been but he chose you young people you young men you young ladies to live in this age Satan has made his claim against you our get them I'll pull them away but God has testified for you they will stand they will be faithful amen praise the Lord let's sing together we invite our brother to come oh woman tried so [Music] many Physicians yet grew worse so to Jesus she [Music] came and when that crowd tried to restrain her she whispered these words through her pain now this is what we want to do today for touching Jesus is all that really matters sing it with all your heart now then your life will never be [Music] just believe when you call on his name oh touching Jesus is all that really matter hold in your life it will never be the [Applause] same oh there is only one way to touch him oh just believe when you call on his name I got to touch Jesus it's all that really matter more than your life it will never be the same oh there is only one way to touch you just believe when you call on his name hallelujah hallelujah aren't you thankful that your need has touched the master aren't you grateful that you can reach out and touch him how many he has a need that you got to get to Jesus today amen hands all over this place but our Lord can work through every Pew just now let's just go to him in prayer Heavenly Father we come before you Lord we sense the very Nearness of the Holy Spirit father Lord we recognize Lord Jesus that we are not the one that is important in this room but is your great presence oh God The Great I Am that has whispered down through time father that there would be a time that you are going to raise up a generation that would believe against all restraints oh god father here she is standing upon the face of the Earth unbridled by Traditions oh God sitting here father under the power of belief Lord recognizing that where two or three are gathered there you are father there's needs of hands all over this building just now and we invite you Lord God we recognize that you are here by your word father we recognize and sense the very Nearness of of your presence but father we are asking Lord that you change the situations in our life just now father things that are laying in our in our bodies oh God in our spirits and in our souls father that only you know we ask Lord and invite you to come to take the service just now Lord hide us behind the curtain as it were and begin to use our vessel father Lord we we give ourselves over to you both hearer and speaker father now father there's needs all over this building and I invite you right now the same God that spoke the planets into existence I invite you Lord Jesus to come and move and brood across this congregation and touch your children today and we'll be careful to serve you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen God richly bless you today it's good to be in the house of the Lord I trust you all in joy last evening at the banquet my tell you what the Lord certainly was was good to us and we certainly want to uh thank our brother Donnie Reagan and the church here for inviting us to be a part of these meetings and uh to be a part and speak here for our brother Josh Bennett and I tell you I sure love brother Josh with all my heart and his ministry so blessed uh so many around the world and it's another I'm another one that his ministry has touched and we certainly appreciate the work of the Lord that's going on here this weekend and I believe I believe we're standing in very special moments so if you have your Bibles this morning we just like to take a little thought that the Lord's laid on our heart for this morning you have your Bibles we'd like to look over in uh Matthew chapter 28 verse 5 Matthew chapter 28 verse5 and bring greetings from our home Church Full Gospel Lighthouse in Elton Virginia also from our pastor brother Ron Spencer and he sends his greetings to you and we certainly love you with all of our heart here hey brother Matthew God bless you this morning good to see you amen ain't it good to be in the house of the Lord amen Matthew chapter 28 and verse 5 and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified he is not here for he has risen as he said come and see the place where the Lord lay and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead behold he goeth before you into Galilee there shall you see him lo I have told you and they departed quickly from the Seiler now notice with fear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples words I absolutely love that portion of scripture right there because it shows us the mingled of emotions and passions that are running through the disciples here of great fear and joy at the same time so it shows shows us that there can be things that are laying there in our spirit or in our emotional realm and it it's amazing and it doesn't it didn't matter what the emotion was it didn't matter what the feeling that they were feeling but the expression of their faith is in the final of that verse there and they did run to bring his disciples word and as they went to tell his disciples behold Jesus met them saying all hell and they came and held him by the feet and worshiped him then said unto them Be not Afraid go tell my brethren that they go into Gile and there they shall see me may God bless his word you may be seated today in the presence of the Lord you amen today by the help of the Lord I'd like to take a just a little thought here on messengers of the Resurrection m messengers of the resurrection and brother brandham says in the message go tell he said he said oh there's been great messages he said but Easter C them all he said great messages he said Easter was all of it he said when the dead was made preparation he said that last enemy when he'd seen sickness he said we'd seen sickness healed in the Old Testament he said we'd seen Miracles performed in the Old Testament he said there was Visions in the Old Testament but every man went right to the Grave wondering would he ever rise again he said but on Easter morning when the disciples got the greatest message that any man could ever get what did they get go tell my disciples that I'm risen from the dead death had been conquered and the Bible says here in Hebrews chapter 2 therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great a Salvation which at first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him God also bearing them witness with both signs and wonders and with diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will as we said we'd like to take a thought here on on messengers of the resurrection and Webster tells us what a what a messenger is it's one who Bears a message or an errand it's somebody that is known as a Harbinger or a forerunner or he that fores shows it somebody no matter whether it's a verbal communication or if it's a written communication they're taking out a notice or an invitation and they are delivering a message and the Bible said in Proverbs 13-1 17 that a wicked messenger falleth into Mischief but a faith F Ambassador is Health a faithful Ambassador is health so it tells us that a trustworthy and a wise messenger he releases he releases healing wherever he goes and I think it's a very powerful thing to to know that today that everywhere that we go we don't have to release bad news by the words of our mouth or by our Expressions upon our body but I believe it's a very powerful thing to recognize that we have the ability to release healing to wherever that we go the Bible says in Proverbs 25 and 13 as the cold of snow and in the time of harvest so is a faithful Messenger to them that send him for he refreshes the soul of his Masters and I believe that if we're going to do anything we want to do something that is going to refresh our Master now anybody anybody can carry news but the value in the messenger is the message that he carries because we recognize that that anybody that's got a got a mailbox or got a got a post office that they go to that there there the mailman can carry he can carry in his in his brief case where he can carry in his van he can carry checks to you that can bless you or he can carry bills in the in and place it in your mailbox that you'll surely not a whole lot think about him so he can carry either good news or he can carry bad news and you've heard the expression don't shoot the messenger that the message came from a higher source and I believe that it's a very powerful thing that we recognize where the message that we believe in where it came from it didn't come from the mind of a man but it came from almighty God and I know that this message has caused it has caused Scruples and things but don't shoot the messenger this message didn't come from William brandom's mind but this message came from the real from the realm of almighty God where he would begin to release things for this generation that would raise a people into a standard that they would recognize that are the token on display so don't shoot the messenger and don't shoot our young people for living exactly what they're called to be I I know that there are certainly there are certainly people that would that would that would definitely rather maybe maybe they would rather have ups that would deliver their packages over FedEx because FedEx sometimes has a reputation of being able to miss deliver things and not make it to your house and I think it I think it's I think it's uh I think it's something that we that we notice is that they these these companies that deliver messages or they deliver your package they drop it off maybe they'll drop it off your address is such and such and they drop it off at your neighbor's house it's a MISD delivery but I want you to know there's there's one thing that God does not have he does not have a reputation of delivering your package that he's destined for you off at your neighbor's house when he's destined for your address when he's got blessings that are upon your roads that are coming to your house almighty God knows exactly where he's coming from so don't get mad today when God drops off the Deliverance for this brother when he knows exactly that that that brother needs that Deliverance don't get mad at God when God comes by your way and brings peace to this sister because he knows exactly what she has need of in her life and in that situation it's not a misdelivery but I'll put this in in your mind just now if you've made a declaration and you've ordered something from almighty God he won't MISD deliver any anything to the Church of the Living God he's got a reputation of being right on time it might look like he's running late it might look like he ain't coming but he's got a reputation Hallelujah that he always backs up his word and it ain't what you're doing in the moment but it's what God's got his eyes on you in the moment of your crisis he's right there and I'll say this and brother brandham said that the church he said not the bride he said but she's living off of past reputations back there in the L Ling time he said but you're not living back there under past reputations but there is a reputation the reputation keeper is our Lord Jesus Christ you don't have to pay somebody to keep up your reputation there's a God that not only seals you but he keeps you he guides you he protects you he's watching over you all the days of your life that's one thing that brother Brandon would say that God never he never he never held he never held Israel on what they was or what they was back in the day or what they had been he said but he held them to what they were at that moment and it's a sign to us that God does not have grandchildren that God does not have grandchildren where we can go off of the experiences of our grandfathers or our grandmothers but we've got to have a personal experience with almighty God because if you're ever going to be a witness for the Church of the Living God you've got to be you've got to have an experience and you can tell about brother Ron's Miracles you can tell about brother Donnie's Miracles you can tell about brother brother Daryl world's Miracles but what about your miracle and the only way that you're ever going to be a faithful and a true witness is that you have an experience with almighty God for yourself and I'll say this that you don't have to live here in depression you don't have to live here under the jurisdiction of hell but you are under a kingdom and that kingdom is not a weak Kingdom that it is a power it is an anointing I want you to know that today you don't have to sign up for a box of rattlesnakes because you didn't order it but if you sign for it it's your sin but you don't have to sign up for that if I was you I'd make a declaration I signed up for my joy I signed up for my peace I signed up for my Deliverance I signed up for the Holy Ghost I signed up for healing and when healing comes by my way I'll know that it met the master hallelujah hallelujah I was I was doing a little study a while back and I studying studying I got to reading about I got to reading I was kind of curious about it and I got to reading about the mail men in World War II and and how that they would how that it was their job to deliver the mail that it wasn't necessarily their job to fight in the battle but it was it was a job that they had been granted or or the the government would allow them to operate in and maybe they didn't necessarily pick up a gun but yet they had they had some of the most important jobs because they were not only were they carrying out death threats not only were they carrying out not only were they carrying out tactics for the battle but there were certain things that they were carrying in their in their mail back and I I found I found that there was a man that in that was in World War II that he he be to he be to express and tell his story of what it was like and he told he said I he said I was one of the most key components of the army or the battle that was happening in World War II he said because I W he said I was carrying the good news from back home and he said I was he said I was he said I would work out he said I was the first one off of the ship and he said I was the last one get back on the ship he said I recognize my job as one of the most important jobs he said because I would watch as I would take the mail into the camps of of the United States he said I would take them in there and he said I would literally watch it change the morale of all the all the fighters that were there in that war he said it literally changed the morale of all the saints he said when I would drop off the package or I would drop off the mail he said it was amazing to see he said there were certain men he said you'd watch it he said they would take it he said they'd recognize it was familiar handwriting he said they would begin to they would begin to smell the envelope and they could smell the smells of back home maybe maybe she was writing this maybe mama or or his wife was writing this while she was breaking baking bread and being able to go into that spot he was able to he was able to sniff it and it would take him from a spot of war and scars and and blood and agony but he was able to smell it and it took him all the way back what was it it was good news from home he said I literally watched as the people he said as they would read it it completely changed the morale from a spot where they were in a miserable spot to a light of Hope in a moment that they recognize that there's something worth fighting for oh if men in the natural could recognize that there's something worth fighting for to give them a renew hope how about us as Sons and Daughters of God should we be able to look into the script bag of almighty God and let it change our position in the fight maybe you've been a little bit down maybe you got a little cold on God maybe maybe you just need to sniff the letter of the word of God and find out that he's still your God maybe you need to pick up the mail maybe you need to pick up the package and look through the package one more time and find out that God's still God maybe you need to look through the word one more time and find out that he still got a promise for you in this generation he didn't leave you down here hallelujah he didn't leave you down here without a witness but I say it's time that we go reading through the mail of Psalms 18 oh I will love thee oh Lord my strength the Lord is my rock and my Fortress my deliverer my my God my strength what's David talking about he wasn't talking about his neighbor's God he was talking about his God I ain't talking about your God I'm talking about my God and maybe the god that you know and is powerful as the God that I know but the God that I know still delivers from cancer he still delivers from brain bleach that God that I know he's my God he's Mighty in battle he never has lost a battle he never gives up he didn't send you down here in Le Osa to see you go down into feet he sent you here to be a mighty Gentile Warrior I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from my enemies the Sorrows of death they Compass me in the floods of the young Godly men made me afraid the Sorrows of Hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me but in my distress in my distress I called upon the Lord and Cried unto my God and he heard my voice out of his Temple and my cry before him even into his ears maybe you're in battle and you need to change maybe you need to change the morale of your home but be ye of good cheer I have overcome the world Psalms 1:18 and6 the Lord is on my side I will not fear what man can do unto me is he really caring for me brother Andrew am I all alone down here in leot or does he really care for me when I go through troubles does he see me Psalms 34 and18 the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and saveth such have be of a contrite spirit Lamentations 3 and 22 it's of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not they are new every morning great is our faithfulness the Lord is my portion saving my soul therefore will I hope in him William brandham don't get your eyes on TL osburn's upon his Academy don't get your eyes eyes upon or Robert's Academy but the Lord is your portion bride don't get your eyes on Le oosa the Lord is your portion maybe you need to grab yourself an attitude check maybe you need to grab and allow this word of God to roll over your soul and bring a freshness back to your heart drive back every devil of Hell flush out all the enemies flush them out flush them out if the enemy's robbed you there's a God that restores if he's taking away your joy there a god that restores what does this word do it literally changes our spiritual altitude it takes us from one level to a Next Level and God sees your attitude and just like he saw hady right when she was sitting there she didn't have an attitude why couldn't that happen to me how why don't I create squirrels but she said that's nothing but the truth brother Bram she had the right kind of attitude and changed her situation so I'm saying to you young people it's not an emotion that changes your spiritual altitude it's not upon the things that you feel upon your flesh that changes your spiritual altitude but there is a message that we are carrying that lifts us into another realm that's why the S phenician woman when she was sitting there before Jesus and she had a very serious condition with her daughter she said Lord see my daughter here he said it's not meat for me to give the children bread over to you dogs but notice her attitude even so Lord the dogs eat the crumbs from the master's table maybe that's all you're here for this morning maybe you only showed up for a crumb in this meeting but I'll guarantee you if you grab a hold of one of these crumbs it'll change your situation it'll lift you into a realm that'll take you higher and one of these mornings I'll tell you how important you are that if Satan could already got you he would have but God's got a purpose in your life if he could he would disrupt your family he would disrupt your mind he'd disrupt the services if he could but you're so powerful that God allowed you to be destined to carry a message that would go until the very CL climax of this generation that you would be a final runner in the final generation because God Saves his best till last as brother Donnie was saying about those that had gave their life back there under the Dark Ages there was an anointing that would keep them in that generation under 68 million Martyrs that would lay there and give their life over to Jesus Christ how did they do it they gave it and were able to sustain because of the anointing that was there but God has not left you here without an anointing in there is an eagle anointing that takes you into a realm that only an astronaut can go to you change the situation by the atmosphere that you carry with the very word of God hallelujah brother Bram said in question answers he said but this message that I'm preaching is the true message this day and it's the last message he said you see what I'm doing Brethren I'm putting all you all in the same place that I am he didn't leave one of us out I'm putting all of you in the same place that I am this ain't some Catholicism religion where we leave it on the pastors and we leave it on the Elders of the church I'm putting you in the same place I don't care who your pastor is I don't care where you came from I'm putting you in the same place as I am cuz you're just as much into it as I am you are messengers of the same message go ahead and give the Lord a hand clap of Praise ah it's good to know it's good to know that it ain't just William bram's message it's good to know that it ain't just the preacher's message it's good to know that it's your message and God is as good as his word if he was with William brandom against every single devil that would line itself up against the Church of the Living God if you're packing the same message that William Brandon preached every devil has to bow has to Bow you say you don't know what you're talking about brother Angel oh absolutely I do I know exactly what I'm talking about this message that William Brandon preached is your message there was a brother one time there was a brother that bought a home one time and he he had bought B this home and when he went in there there was there was all kinds of I don't know any other way to say it but ghost up in the house and they was they would walk they they'd Walk The Attic up there at night time when they would lay down at they would lay down to go to sleep and and they would hear footw walks footsteps walking across the banister while they were up there and it went on for weeks upon weeks upon weeks and that man finally had enough of it but he recognized that the message that William Brandon preached was his message as well so he took a bunch of them spoken word books up there and laid them out across the banisters laid them all the way across that attic he said now try to walk across the word and it never walked again let me tell you something Church of the Living God all you got to do is put the message on display and it'll work every single time I've watched sugar diabetes bow to the name of Jesus Christ I've watched cancer bow to the name of Jesus Christ I've watched depression bow to the name of Jesus Christ because there is no other name given amongst men whereby we should be saved but by the name Hallelujah the one that entrusted you to run with this message shows the faith that he's God in the one that he gave the message to because Jesus would say about John the Baptist he said verily verily I say unto you among men among them that are born of of women there have not risen a greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding notwithstanding that he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he it doesn't matter if you're the lowest part of the body of Jesus Christ you're greater than every devil that could come up against you it ain't your workup it ain't your emotion it ain't your excitement it's the word of God that makes every demon in Hell bow hallelujah what was it John was to be a messenger not only just a prophet but a prophet messenger one that would forerun the first coming of Christ where where did the word meet John in that day it met him in the water where did the word meet the prophet in this day in 1933 when he was baptizing his 17th person there in the Ohio River it was packed all around the United States even up in Canada that a local Baptist Minor was baptized and there there came out a star and hung over William brandham and said said these words as John the Baptist was sent to forun the first coming of Christ so have you been William brandham sent to forun the second coming of Christ it would happen over and over and over again in meeting on top of meetings one time in a in a cathedral in San Antonio Texas where William brandham was walking out there there was a little fellow that was sitting up there and he began to speak in tongues like a shotgun Fir and or a machine gun rapidly way back way back there he said a fellow rose up and said thus sayith the Lord the man that's walking to the platform is going forward with a Ministry that was ordained of almighty God as John the Baptist was sent as a first Forerunner of the coming of Jesus Christ so he packs a message that will cause the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ let me tell you something Church you don't have to recreate the wheel just live the message just live the message there there he is that goodlooking dude sitting back there that's my cousin or I'm his cousin but we had a we had a great great grandmother that's brother Malachi right there W you stand up and let them see you they probably don't know you here yet that's my cousin he's a great turkey hunter if you got any hunting land see him up after church he'd be happy to see you you're welcome we had a great great grandmother and you can go ask him Miss after church he'll tell you the truth we had a great great grandmother name was Clara Spencer and and in the early 1930s brother Joe the Lord had visited my our great great grandmother and give her a give her a vision of what Elijah was of what Elijah was and who who he was and that had went that went some probably 30 30 some years and know it had been it' been 30 30 32 years and it had she had carried that in her heart and my papa Charlie had come had come in contact with the message and the very first I think it's amazing the very first message that he ever got was the way of a true Prophet which brother Brandon would tell in the service right before he preaches the way of a true Prophet that he's going to preach on the trail of a prophet I think it's amazing that that there the Spencers were lined up to be on a trail of a prophet before Elijah was ever fully into effect of his Ministry and when my papa Charlie they they had them old spoken word only believe books and back in the day and they they had them there and and and and when he he went in he contacted the message and he he so fell in love with the message immediately he wented to share it with his family so he took that he took that little book in there I said Mama I've come in contact with a message and said he began to tell her certain things about it and he flipped over the fly leaf of that book and there was William bram's picture they used to have this picture on the inside of them books I many of us don't read books no more we read them right off our tablets anymore but back then they had them PCT a picture of brother brandom in the in the fly Lea of that book and there when her eyes fell on that before brother Charlie my papa Charlie could say anything else she said that's Elijah I saw him 30 years before I ever seen this message it was a sign unto this generation that there was an Elijah Ministry that was coming that would cause the very second coming of Christ Christ Church you don't have to have a new thought young people you ain't got to recreate the will just live the message be the message preach the message live the message it's everything just be what the message is you have to put on something just prach a message I'll tell you what the message does just exactly like what William Brandon would say he said I want you to repeat this prayer you pray it I'll repeat it you pray it I'll just transfer the words that it takes to defeat Satan what is happening service after service Wednesday and Sunday Saturday and Sunday throughout the midweek what is happening there is being a transfer from Heaven Divine over to a church that has the power to defeat Satan by this message Hallelujah I'll just transfer the words that it takes to defeat Satan right to your lips and then you believe your confession that's your part that's your part it's brother Donnie's child problem it's his it's his part to preach the word it's your part to believe it come on somebody it's our part to preach it's our part to study it's our part to get ourselves out of the way but it's your part to line yourself up get behind this Joshua Ministry and let's run down and take everything that's rightfully ours then you believe your confession now you that's sick repeat this with me almighty God creators of Heaven and Earth author of everlasting life Giver of all good gifts I your servant confess my sins I believe through the merits of thy son Jesus I am forgiven of my sins I am sick in body I need your help give me fa just now to believe your word to believe these things which I have seen tonight that reproduces your life again as it was yesterday so is it today and now Lord upon this confession I accept my healing and I believe from this night henceforth I shall be well I commit myself to you in the name of Jesus Christ how powerful is that how simple is that now you that are sick you repeated that now be healed in the name of Jesus Christ well is it that simple brother Andrew it's that simple because you've been given an authoritative word and you are not oblig Hallelujah you're not obligated to make yourself whole you're not obligated to make yourself feel something you're obligated to believe his word and let that angel of the Lord come slipping down your neighborhood maybe you got a Gord maybe you got C but the angel of the Lord knows exactly where you live and it might be 6 weeks before it shows up but you keep believing well what are you telling us brother Andrew I'm saying I'm saying that the word that you're carrying is not a dead letter it's a living word that you're a messenger of the same power that Rose Jesus Christ from the dead because the Bible said that we ought to give the more Earnest heed L at any time should let them slip for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast notice brother Brandon picks that up in the Hebrew series he said do you hear it he said if the word spoken by angels He said the angel is a messenger he said the word angel means the messenger and he said just go and notice what brother random does he goes back to Hebrews chapter 1 it said God who innd times and in diverse manner spoke to the fathers By His prophets that was God's messenger he said they was God's Messengers they were God's angels a messenger is an angel or an angel is a messenger rather you recognize where we're living at it's the hour of the restoration of the Bride tree that it has been a restoration to prophesy the same things that the angel said in this generation you recognize what William brandham when he call is called beyond the curtain of time he said he said those words came to him his words came to him so well I preach what Paul preached I preached what Paul preached what Paul preach William Brandon preach and what William Brandon preached you amen you amen now I tell you what I enjoy all the shouting I enjoy all the Clapping of hands I enjoy you shouting down the aisles but there's nothing more as a man of God that Thrills my heart is when I see young people begin to amen the word of God because they saying to their situation I believe it so be it it doesn't matter Hallelujah if you feel a chill running down your neck or whether you're running down the corner just say Amen to it amen amen Amen brother brandom say you he said if there's a great big signal going through here that we don't capture with our we don't capture with our own eyes but it's a radio signal that come through here and it would say Amen across the congregation he said it'd be a great big thing across it he said but if there was something there that would be able to catch it then somebody would be able to catch it and identify that it said amen he said if one person caught it they'd say Amen to it he said but if a second person caught it there'd be the two times the power of Amen well I'd say there's more than two people in here today and he said where two or three are gathered in my name there I'll be in the midst of him I'd say we're closer around 300 400 some people but if oh if 400 people could say Amen to the word of God what would Satan do this morning with somebody that lines herself up I had a I had a customer customer called me the other day actually on the way here and he told me is said now you got to understand he's not a very he ain't a saint by no means he he's in that world and he he's a he's he's respectful he's respectful to me and Dad and all of us but he's definitely not a Christian by no means but he called me other day he said it's been a very strange dream he said I very strange day he said had a crazy dream I thought I thought this pretty powerful he said I had a crazy dream he said this a guy I don't know anything about the message he's had a crazy dream that William brandham and you was sitting in my room and he said I couldn't understand what you were saying he said but you were both saying the same thing and he said he was trying to get me to understand now here's a guy I they got he ain't got a clue about what the message is he said William brandom I said well I tell you that's actually absolutely the truth he said because because I whatever William brandom said that's what I'd be saying and I maybe you don't understand it what's happening right now but I'm saying the same thing that that William brandham said and if William brandham would stand there night after night and demons would bow to the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm saying the same thing maybe you don't understand fully but he's come for your deliverance this morning Hallelujah I tell you you're that kind of powerful people that no matter what comes against You Against All Odds you're going to express something that's been on the inside of you all the days of your life your daddy didn't give it to your mama didn't pass it on to you your preacher didn't pass it on to you but a jean Sheed of God awakened to the word and you got a hold of it and screamed Amen to the message Abraham against all ODS it was told to him he was going to have he's going to have an Isaac he told he's going to have an Isaac at 20 years old 30 years old at 40 years old there was something on the inside of him that was expressing that an Isaac was coming but it wasn't until mezc showed up 75 it was in him to express it at 90 it was in him to express it at 100 he saw the Fulfillment of it and maybe there has been a prophecy of the word of God that has been put over your life that you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and now you're living in the reality of that moment as Jesus would say in John chapter 20 and he breathed on them the Holy Ghost it was a prophecy but it wasn't until they got up there in the upper room on the day of Pentecost that the prophecy became a reality and there they was expressing what Jesus had saw on the inside of them he saw a promise that was coming by their way you may not recognize this but I'm trying my best to get it to you but you're the most powerful people there is on the earth I'll take any of our 12y old girls any anybody 12 in here I know I got a daughter here at 12 I'll take any of these 12-y old girls and stack them up to the religions of the world and they can shut down politics they can shut down they can shut down government by the power that Reigns on the inside of them what is it it's the same power that was on the inside of Mary that she didn't even know that was there but it was lingering there but there come a time when she was going to express what everything that she'd been born for everything that she was desting for she was going to express when she was taking a walk there was something over her life all her days but when she met Gabriel when she met the messenger it Chang change her Destiny I tell you what it is it's like brother Brandon would say he would talk about that Cockney and recognizing it day your day and its message he said there he said I heard a story about an old Cockney he said there he was and he said the king had a message and the King had a message and he was going he had to get it over to a certain spot so he entrusted a man to run with a message he gave him he give him a scepter said you take this and you go no matter what you come up against you go keep on running run with this message run with this message when you come against demons run with this message when you come against anxiety run with this message when you come against fear run with this message when you come against pain run with this message when you come against fear when you come against peer pressure run with this message when you run against rejection run with this message when you come up against the Demons of Hell run with this message when the enemy comes in like a flood run with this message because there's no weapon that is formed against you that shall prosper run with the message what's in your hand it's a king scepter it came from the King you're not walking out there on your own you're an ambassador of almighty god brother BR I I want I want to show you what brother Brandon said he said a messenger you you are a messenger this morning you're a messenger of good news or a messenger of bad news he said but oh isn't it beautiful to know that we are ambassadors that we are angels The Messengers of the Resurrection I know that you're right here in Le osia and I know the troubles that you face I I can imagine what I faced in high school I could imagine what brother Matthew McClaren faced in high school but 10 times worse every single generation I can't imagine what you come up against I can't imagine but God's got confidence in you he's got confidence in you little girls he's got confidence in you sons of God he's got confidence in you that he would put in your hands the greatest weapon that was ever given to man the word of God I got got in the car the other day and a devil got in with me he started talking to me and I'm going to let you in on a little conversation me and the devil had he said what if this Rapture that you're preaching ain't for another 70 years I sat there for a second I thought man him's going to be some powerful young people him's going to be some powerful young people it's going to be a powerful generation if it gets 10 times worse every single generation put another 70 years on it so what you're the most powerful the devil don't know what to do with you you're so powerful you can line up every devil against this message and he'll never stop you'll never stop you'll never Hallelujah you are who he thought of you are who he elected you are who he ordained Hallelujah and we're not back in town we've got news from the Homeland there is a Rapture there is a body change there is an anointing there is a breakthrough you arec elected God blessed be the name of the Lord that's the kind of young people that I preaching to no matter what it takes no matter what we got to go [Applause] through it humbles me to think that God elected you to this position he didn't just put anybody in this spot he put the best of the best you humbled yourself you came without nothing but you're the best he's got you're the best he's got chlo you're the best he's got I tell you it's kind of like brother brand brother BR tell that little story I hope it's all right I hope I ain't going too far here today clock clock doesn't shut off anyway I didn't set no time it just the whole thing shut down that's a bad it's time to quit it's kind of like brother Brandon would talk about that that little boy that was walking down that little down past that little goalie he's walking down through there seeing that man laying over there in that little in that little goalie may you better be careful on these steps you hurt yourself you got walking down past that goalie I might be like that man if I keep walking on them things walking past there and a little boy saw him he walked into there that little that little building in there he walked in there and said sir your sign's down outside that man walked outside wiped his sign took his little took his little a and wiped his sign say Sir Sunny you're mistake it he said that sign ain't down it's hanging up right there he said oh no he said I'm talking about your best sign I'm talking about your best sign he said son that's the best sign I got he said oh no he said there's a man laying over there in the corner Corner staggering under the influence of what you're selling on the inside of here you're the best sign that God's got let me tell you when the rest of the world don't want to be a token and don't want to display you're the best sign that almighty God has got and maybe you don't believe it just let maybe you don't understand what I'm talking about but can I give you some news from the Homeland that might change the morale of the troops God is still on the Throne let it lift your spirit God still loves you he still got healing for your body he still got resurrection power he's still Jehovah Gyra he's still Jehovah Nish he's still Jehovah Shalom he's still Jehovah shama he's still Jehovah n he's still setting free he's still delivering he's still giving the Holy Ghost it's time that you experience the news from home hallelujah hallelujah he still got you on his mind he still got a Rapture for you and I got the best news here's your headline news to change the morale Satan is defeated every problem every situation every sickness every disease every Power Satan you're limited so what am I saying to you young people lay aside every weight and run this message William brandom ran his part it's time that you run your part lay aside everything that holds you down you can't run with the weight of sin on you you can't run with pain upon you lay it down lay it down and you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me I wonder if we got any Witnesses in here God still give the holy ghost take a look around devil God still deliver do I have a witness in this place that God still sets the captives free God still got a pillar of fire that leads the church it doesn't matter the critic that you come up against God's got a witness God's going to have one person whether nobody else wants to serve him or not he's going to have one person they're obligated to keep his word they have met him they have been in fellowship with him they have talked with him they have entertained him and God is obligated to keep his word that person's been in fellowship with them they've talked to the father they know who they are they know that they're redeemed they know that their Blood Washed their blood bought and they've been raised into this generation for such a time as this it's time that you have a banquet for your enemy come on Esther it's time that you not only go to the king's banquet but it's time that you have a banquet for hmon and tell your king what Hon's done to you he's tried to destroy you he's tried to rob you he's tried to teach you have a banquet hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he came to this banquet to die he showed up at the wrong banquet he showed up at the Rome youth meeting ain't that right ain't that right he's still God he's still on the throne he's still got his eye on me he still loves me he's greater than anything Hallelujah another bam said that when Jesus raised Lazarus from the grave he went down there said I am the resurrection in life and he proved he was a Son of God he proved he was God in man brother B said you flip the chapter and you see Lazarus at a banquet you see Lazarus set a banquet brother B said these words I thought this so powerful he said and them people that came to that banquet they didn't come to see Jesus they come to see the power of Jesus oh maybe it came here with wrong intentions but you're seeing the power of my Jesus because there's a witness in this place there's a witness in this place you're at a banquet and the works of almighty God is in this room God delivers don't God sets free Tony he he's in this room he's here Elijah's God is [Applause] here we had that move come through called disbelieve the sign a bunch of defectors from the message walked away had some real hurts in it had some real hurts in it but God backed up his word every single time because God is obligated to his word my brother my brother Matthew he's not a man that's given over to imagination at all you want to hear the truth just ask my brother Matthew he'll tell you the truth it might hurt your feelings but he'll tell you the truth he's that kind of guy but there was a a group of disbelievers that had come against had to come against everything that you're here for this morning completely come against it my brother was was packing some notes that he'd gotten from you without understanding and he took it to him and said if you can't explain if you can't explain if you can't explain this then how can you you're going to have to turn if you turn down the message you're going to have to turn down the Bible told him exactly how you said it brother Donnie walked in there threw it down on table and they was all sitting in there a whole room of them you talking about walking into a room where the enemy's at he walked in there and Matthew ain't scared of nobody he ain't scared nobody it's probably it's probably one of his biggest weaknesses got me out of a lot of trouble as a boy thank you Matthew we walked in there threw it down on the page on the table they didn't want nothing to do with it cuz them people don't want Tru truth people don't want truth but it shows me how powerful that you are that you want this you've had critics come against it you've had squatters try to come in and take it from you but it shows me how powerful that you are Mason it's because there's something on the inside of you that's raising you to believe it against all hope he walked in there threw it down his house at that time was over in this such and such place he walked back over and Titus was a little big boy at that time him and Cassie sitting there in the room if y'all hear this God bless you but they're sitting there in the room they're sitting in the room Matthew walked in I he he he really he really guards this but I I think it's the time to say it he looked at Cash said if William brandham is not Malachi 4 then all the Bible's wrong at that moment the pillar of fire sweeped into the room and hung in the room right there these ain't people that's giving over to imaginations these are people that are real rugged Believers and in the face of criticism and in the face of it all God backed up his word what I'm saying to you young people is that no matter where you put this message it'll live put it in a dungeon and there'll be people praying for you over in John Mark's house and the angel of the Lord will come by your way Peter I get you out of the prison house do I have a witness in this place that God's still God he still loves me he's still on the throne he ain't forgot [Applause] me Hallelujah you don't have to do anything else brother Lance but believe it believe it believe it just believe it that's what this ministry was hanging on if you can get the people to believe you it's hanging upon your belief but will you be a runner he's give you the greatest message he's still alive this ain't just Sund day no more it's snd day and you are sitting here at the rising of the Sun and it's time to run it's time to run Patrick Henny Henry run with everything that's within you it's more than the British are coming Jesus is coming tell your friends tell your neighbors tell your loved ones come come come unto him and he'll give you rest come unto him and he'll give you peace oh let the musicians come let the saints of God rise to their feet and declare I am a witness I'm a witness I'm a witness I was a wayward preacher boy heard this message all my life been close to the presence of God been in prayer rooms been in meetings but i' never met him young people I know what I'm talking about I've seen fakes but don't let it scare you away there's some real reality here I seen what it was like to be in the presence of the Lord and people shout and dance and not really have it and see him walk right back out there and do the things they were doing but I see a reality in this room today I was close to it sister Carol I seen it with my own eyes I seen the power of God come down brother Eli I was that close and it wasn't enough it wasn't enough oh one night with the king I was walking down the streets in Canada now if he can meet me on the street surely he can meet you in this place surely he'll show up in a place that's been set aside this building doesn't know it's Saturday the speakers don't know it's Saturday them pews don't know it's Saturday but you do then speakers don't know that wall over there don't know that he's here well you do and he met me on a street he met me on a street and the god that my daddy knew was no longer the God my daddy knew I knew him I met him it changed my life he set my course he knew what he was doing he knew what he was doing because he would send me all the way to Johnson Tennessee to tell you that he still loves you and he can come all the way past all your pain and all your anxiety and all your fears all the blockages that you've built up to tell you that if you can push past the sin barrier if you could push past those things you'll break free into a room where the Holy Ghost is and he can come and wash you and make you new and that messenger is here this morning to make you a messenger of his resurrection I may not be your favorite preacher and that's okay brother Ron brother Donnie they may not be your favorite preachers but don't get construed by the package that the message shows up in just open it up just open it up you'll never know what it's like until you open it up you'll never know what it's like to feel the presence of the Lord until you open your heart maybe right there where you are you just want to lift up your hand say God I want to know you like never before I want to come to a time where I can amen every word of God that it'll be a sign in this generation that there's still one that still believes against all hope that God has ordained me to run with this message Father God In This Place the word of God has been preached we have felt your presence Lord a hush is falling over this building just now and your presence is here to vindicate your word there's young people and old people are lock hands all over the building that have identified that they want to be a witness father this morning father I pray Lord as we worship you in our song and in our heart Lord that we would open up the message just now and we'd run with everything that's within us oh God you didn't send it here just to allow it
