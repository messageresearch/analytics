[25:52] be found
[25:55] I couldn't see it then but I can see it

[26:04] [Music]
[26:08] in The Waiting
[26:11] [Music]
[26:16] buried in the broken pieces
[26:21] every man and every moment where I've

[27:04] [Music]
[27:07] in the waiting in the searching in the
[27:12] healing and the hurting like a blessing
[27:16] buried in the broken pieces
[27:20] every minute every moment where I've
[27:25] been or where I'm going even when I
[27:29] didn't know it I couldn't see it
[27:33] there was Jesus on the mountains in The
[27:38] Valleys
[27:42] in the shadows of the alleys
[27:48] in the fire in the flood
[27:54] [Music]
[27:55] always is and always

[28:31] been or where I'm going even when I
[28:35] didn't know it I couldn't see it and
[28:39] there was Jesus
[28:46] there was Jesus
[28:54] there
[28:55] Jesus Jesus
[29:00] [Music]
[29:01] [Applause]
[29:12] where would we be without him today
[29:17] and he's glad you know it
[29:21] I mean this guy who knew you before you
[29:23] knew him
[29:24] that's what really matters isn't it
[29:27] let's turn to the Book of Romans today
[29:29] if you would
[29:31] Romans chapter 8. verse 16.
[29:37] I Mendoza living in a great time
[29:41] I mean those are living in an awful time
[29:44] terrible time
[29:45] sickness trouble despair sadness
[29:48] heartache
[29:50] we know all that right
[29:53] if you'll keep up with the news just the
[29:56] news
[29:57] of all the nuclear threats and all the
[30:00] things that are going on
[30:01] I took care of this week I don't know
[30:03] how people out here without the hope of
[30:05] the Lord in their heart
[30:07] I don't know how they get up every day
[30:10] if you just watch just a few YouTube
[30:13] videos on the nuclear war between
[30:16] America
[30:17] and Russia
[30:19] you watch it for about 10 to 15 minutes
[30:21] it's a whole it'll take
[30:23] and it'll about put you on your knees
[30:26] when you realize what lays ahead for our
[30:30] nation and for the world I guess I never
[30:33] really thought about it before
[30:35] at the end of the Millennium there will
[30:37] be such nuclear fallout
[30:41] or the tribulation period rather before
[30:44] going into the millennium
[30:47] the Lord God will have to perform
[30:50] such an absolute miracle
[30:53] because once the nuclear fallout starts
[30:56] the atoms start dividing dividing it
[30:59] keeps going going then the onset of the
[31:03] nuclear winter comes
[31:06] Darkness covers the earth no sunlight
[31:09] can penetrate
[31:10] so at the end of the tribulation period
[31:12] the Earth is going to be hanging out
[31:14] here like this darkened star
[31:18] that what will our Lord do he'll speak
[31:21] his word and clear it all back and Break
[31:23] Forth in a millennium
[31:28] I'm grateful for that aren't you
[31:30] he done us the same way we was in a
[31:32] nuclear fallout with the devil when it
[31:33] comes to sin instead of London the Lord
[31:36] spoke his word Over Us Praise the Lord
[31:39] Romans chapter 8 verse 16. but until we
[31:41] get there we've got a few more trials
[31:43] maybe a few more tests along the way
[31:46] the spirit itself Bears witness with our
[31:49] spirit
[31:50] that we are the children of God
[31:54] and if children then heirs
[31:57] Heirs of God join heirs with Christ if
[32:01] so be that we suffer with him
[32:03] that we may be also glorified together
[32:07] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[32:10] present time are not worthy to be
[32:13] compared to the glory which shall be
[32:16] revealed in US
[32:19] for the earnest expectation of the
[32:22] creature way this listen now the earnest
[32:25] expectation of the creature weigh this
[32:28] for the manifestation
[32:32] of the sons of God
[32:35] oh Lord
[32:37] how many lots of people remember today
[32:38] as we pray
[32:40] some of our youth gone today down to
[32:42] Brother David sellers service they have
[32:45] there this weekend certainly wants to
[32:46] remember them trust you've been praying
[32:47] for them so there's many that are sick
[32:49] Afflicted going with different things in
[32:51] their bodies and their homes so let's
[32:54] just pray together
[32:55] father we love you so much today we
[32:58] thank you Lord Jesus for loving us
[33:00] caring for us providing for us Lord
[33:02] everything that we have need of we're
[33:06] asking Lord that you would help us take
[33:08] your word once again father and speak to
[33:11] us those things which will be beneficial
[33:14] we've not come together just to see one
[33:18] another though we like that we've not
[33:20] come to just speak to one another but
[33:23] Lord we've come to hear from you
[33:25] and we've not only come just to receive
[33:28] but we've come to give Lord I want to
[33:31] give my very best in this service so
[33:34] when I stand before you that day
[33:37] that you'll not shame me and say you
[33:39] want to get half
[33:40] you only gave a third
[33:43] I want to give everything that I have to
[33:45] give today
[33:46] but I pray not just me have that
[33:49] attitude but everyone here the same
[33:52] attitude Lord and if we do then we know
[33:56] that you'll move you know the needs that
[33:58] are among us different ones sick
[34:00] Afflicted and we know that you're
[34:02] mindful of that we thank you for the
[34:04] healings Lord that we've been
[34:05] experiencing several instantly healed
[34:08] Sunday several instantly healed
[34:10] Wednesday Lord You're a mighty God
[34:13] moving Among Us
[34:14] we shall thank you
[34:16] speak to us today Father
[34:18] in Jesus name we pray
[34:20] God bless you Saints you may be seated
[34:29] I'll keep it for a minute
[34:38] anybody guess what size this is
[34:43] anybody want to guess
[34:47] thank you but you're so wrong
[34:51] 40 regular
[34:55] I like a lot of moving room
[34:59] anybody guess what size shirt I wear
[35:04] 17.
[35:06] 17 here but 15 here so
[35:12] I wonder why that's important
[35:15] maybe some of your sisters I could guess
[35:18] what size dress you are
[35:21] you better not brother die
[35:25] some of your brothers what size shirt
[35:27] you wear
[35:29] not the size matter well yeah on some
[35:32] things it does
[35:36] we think of size the way that we compare
[35:40] to one another and the way that we
[35:43] compare preachers in the way that we
[35:45] compare churches and size whether it's
[35:49] by gift or by knowledge or by years of
[35:52] experience it's a way we look at a lot
[35:54] of things
[35:55] but yet the Lord looks at it in a total
[35:59] different way than what we do
[36:01] now no doubt I would look very very odd
[36:04] today if I walked out of the office and
[36:07] I had on a say a 48 coat and I had on a
[36:12] waist instead of being a 34 of a 44.
[36:17] and I had a belt that was also a 44 and
[36:20] instead of wearing size 10 shoes I had
[36:23] on either size five
[36:25] or it's not brother Andrews size 13 or
[36:27] 14.
[36:29] so size is relevant according to our
[36:33] needs
[36:35] and I'm not sure that we will ever
[36:37] understand why we're here in time why
[36:41] that we go through various things and we
[36:45] tend to measure what we go through well
[36:47] how come I have to go through so much of
[36:50] this and this again we're comparing size
[36:53] the size of what the size of our burden
[36:56] the size of our load the size of our
[36:59] reproach the size of what we have to
[37:02] deal with so because we deal with so
[37:05] much size and say if you've got 14 kids
[37:07] and you pull up on a Volkswagen lot and
[37:10] you tell that guy I want one of them
[37:12] little bugs they say
[37:14] so you're not taking your wife and your
[37:15] kids with you say yeah we're all going
[37:17] to ride in this Volkswagen Beetle well
[37:20] he's going to think there's something a
[37:22] little bit wrong with you because
[37:24] there's no way according to the size of
[37:28] your family you're all going to be able
[37:30] to get in that little Volkswagen car so
[37:33] he will say more than likely sir maybe
[37:35] you might need an SUV or you might need
[37:39] a minivan I don't like them minivans I
[37:42] don't like the look of that suvid I
[37:45] probably couldn't afford one anyway they
[37:46] begin around 85 000 so there ain't
[37:48] around the world I can afford one of
[37:49] them but this Volkswagen but sir I'm
[37:51] trying to get it over to you you'll not
[37:53] be able to fit all of your family inside
[37:57] this car you said this is a family car
[37:59] yes this is a family car well whenever
[38:02] you talk to that man that way he's going
[38:04] to sing there's something wrong with
[38:06] this guy because he cannot relate size
[38:09] so he's looking at you looking at your
[38:12] stair-step children looking at your wife
[38:15] and thinking how am I going to be able
[38:17] to get it over to this man that he's
[38:19] going to need a larger vehicle
[38:23] well you know most of us would say well
[38:25] that's right Common Sense would tell you
[38:27] that ah it's amazing how much we lack
[38:30] common sense though sometimes when it
[38:32] comes to spiritual things
[38:35] so the Lord looks at us at the size that
[38:37] we are now
[38:40] and he looks at the size he wants us to
[38:42] be when we're done with our journey our
[38:46] spiritual walk
[38:48] and for a lot of us it's not that we are
[38:52] smaller but it's that we're too big
[38:58] so we've got so much attached to us
[39:01] that we think is spiritual
[39:04] that is a great attribute to have
[39:08] and yet the Lord looks at us and he sees
[39:11] that there's so much has got to be
[39:13] shaved off and more taken off and more
[39:17] taken off because there's way too much
[39:20] of us
[39:22] so how does God do that how does God
[39:26] take off of us what is too excessive
[39:30] trials
[39:32] test
[39:34] failures
[39:35] disappointments
[39:38] I know we don't like to think of it in
[39:40] this way but
[39:41] in reality we tend to pray more when
[39:44] money's tight and said when we have a
[39:47] whole lot more than what we need
[39:48] we tend to pray more if we sink in all
[39:52] that that God has somehow displeased
[39:54] with this or we've not felt his presence
[39:57] or something just doesn't seem right
[40:00] between us and him we tend to become
[40:03] more serious than if every time we go to
[40:06] the house of God the blessings are just
[40:08] being rained down on us and we can't
[40:10] even contain ourself and that's a lot of
[40:13] times when people tend to get more loose
[40:16] with God
[40:17] because we read blessings as approval
[40:22] but don't you think for one minute in
[40:25] your life
[40:26] blessings is the only sign of God's
[40:29] approval
[40:30] because the children of Israel were
[40:33] forbidden to go into the land of promise
[40:35] God pronounced the Judgment over on this
[40:38] side of the inheritance
[40:40] they died in the wilderness by the
[40:43] thousands
[40:44] yet they didn't have to have new shoes
[40:47] they didn't need new clothes they didn't
[40:49] have to go to the grocery store God
[40:51] blessed them every day of their life
[40:54] and they didn't have one inch of ground
[40:58] in the Promised Land
[41:00] but no doubt they were convinced because
[41:03] God blessed them everything was okay you
[41:07] see that's a typical layout of sin God
[41:09] blesses me I've got this and I've got
[41:12] that that must mean God loves me
[41:16] actually it doesn't
[41:19] come on the greatest sign of his love
[41:22] for any of us
[41:24] is his approval of us in Christ Jesus
[41:30] and then we also know that one of his
[41:32] signs of approval and that we are
[41:35] children is because he corrects us
[41:39] and spanks us real good when we get
[41:42] wrong
[41:43] and when we get into error you know God
[41:46] ain't like a lot of parents today a lot
[41:48] of parents see absolutely no fault in
[41:51] their children
[41:52] so their children can do whatever and
[41:54] you know it's always somebody else's
[41:57] fault if their kids get into a you know
[41:59] an issue with other church kids or
[42:01] whatever it's never their kids fault and
[42:05] some parents think that is an ideal
[42:07] parent that is not a realistic parent
[42:10] that is not a truthful parent but God is
[42:15] the ultimate parent and he loves his
[42:17] children so much that he will always
[42:20] correct them when they're wrong because
[42:23] he does love them
[42:25] so look at it this way then that the
[42:29] size of cross that God allows to each of
[42:33] us is God measuring us for our crown and
[42:38] our reward that we will get hereafter
[42:41] now a lot of what we go through in life
[42:44] is not God's fault it's not God even
[42:47] testing us
[42:48] it's us things that we've done some of
[42:51] what we go through is stuff we inherited
[42:55] from our parents grandparents Aunts
[42:57] Uncles has nothing to do with God but
[43:00] yet the things that he allows to come
[43:03] our way is totally different
[43:06] and the things that he allows to come
[43:08] our way is the things that He blesses us
[43:11] for and when we come through them now
[43:13] let me share some of these things with
[43:15] you today turn and second Corinthians
[43:18] chapter 6 verse 3 and I want you to
[43:20] notice one of the greatest men of God
[43:23] that ever lived on the earth at any
[43:27] given time Paul the Apostle now I want
[43:31] you to listen now I was going to go
[43:32] through this morning by the help of the
[43:34] Lord some of the things that this great
[43:37] man went through now I realized a lot of
[43:41] message folks they don't really think
[43:42] about Paul that much they don't think
[43:44] about Peter James John they pretty much
[43:47] think about our messenger only but let
[43:50] me just remind you that when brother
[43:52] Branham went beyond the curtain of time
[43:55] he referred to Paul he referred to what
[44:00] Paul talked why because in that place he
[44:05] knew Paul had a great place in heaven
[44:09] so it we do ourselves a great
[44:11] disadvantage by taking the apostolic
[44:15] fathers and putting them over here on
[44:17] the minority side and thinking they're
[44:19] really nobody you need to re-read your
[44:21] Bible
[44:22] as a matter of fact the foundations of
[44:25] the city are going to contain the names
[44:29] of the Apostles you show me one
[44:31] scripture where brother branham's name
[44:33] will be on that Foundation
[44:35] now don't get mad at me just read your
[44:37] Bible praise the Lord you show me where
[44:40] my name will be there you show me where
[44:42] brother Tim Pruitt brother Ron Spencer
[44:45] any of the great men that we know and
[44:47] love where their names are going to be
[44:49] in the foundation of the city
[44:51] if we're not careful we will lose sight
[44:54] of what God has done because we're so
[44:57] caught up in what he's doing and we're
[45:00] failing to put in priority what he did
[45:03] the city is already built Paul's name is
[45:05] done there the foundation of that great
[45:08] thing is already there Paul's name is
[45:12] there
[45:13] I don't think we ought to put these
[45:15] brothers on the sideline and say Well
[45:17] they're not really that important we've
[45:19] got Elijah in our day Elijah himself
[45:22] compared his own message and judged his
[45:26] own message by Paul I preached what Paul
[45:32] preached
[45:34] and Word of Life Church said
[45:37] so brother and then sat up and say I
[45:40] didn't need what Paul had to say I was a
[45:42] prophet of that day and I didn't need
[45:44] that no brother Branham did not believe
[45:46] that it's only people in error around
[45:49] the message that believes that
[45:51] now I want you to notice then this man
[45:54] went through more in his life than any
[46:00] other Gentile preacher
[46:03] he experienced more well to me if he did
[46:07] then you look at the word God was
[46:10] measuring that brother for a large
[46:12] position in heaven
[46:14] notice second Corinthians 6 3 giving no
[46:18] offense in anything that the ministry be
[46:21] not blamed but in all things approving
[46:24] ourselves as the Ministers of God in
[46:27] much patience in afflictions and
[46:30] Necessities in distresses notice he says
[46:33] in stripes in imprisonments in tumults
[46:39] in labors
[46:41] in watchings which means he couldn't
[46:45] sleep
[46:47] so night after night after night he had
[46:51] insomnia
[46:53] now there's somewhat he went through in
[46:55] stripes
[46:57] you know of any Gentile preacher
[47:00] that's been beat
[47:02] 39 stripes
[47:08] you know then he Gentile preacher in
[47:10] America that's been thrown in prison
[47:14] seven times
[47:19] it imprisonments Thomas and labors and
[47:24] watchings and fasting by pureness by
[47:29] knowledge by long-suffering by kindness
[47:31] by the Holy Ghost by love unfamed by the
[47:35] word of Truth by the power of God by the
[47:39] armor of righteousness on the right hand
[47:41] and on the left by Honor and dishonor by
[47:46] evil report and good report look at what
[47:49] he's going back and forth between the
[47:51] contrast of what this made me through
[47:53] and what was most of it brought on what
[47:56] was the cause because he stood for the
[48:00] Lord Jesus
[48:03] and he bore this cross why
[48:07] because he was a Jew
[48:10] because he was an educated man because
[48:15] he was a gospel preacher
[48:18] so all of this was brought on him
[48:21] because
[48:23] of the sake of Christ
[48:25] and you keep in your mind the Lord will
[48:28] not be beholding to any man
[48:32] by Honor and dishonor by evil report and
[48:36] good report
[48:37] as deceivers
[48:40] yet true
[48:41] so they were they were blasted they were
[48:45] ridiculed they were run down I know yeah
[48:48] by the way I ain't just talking about
[48:50] the Jews but I'm talking about some of
[48:53] the so-called message people of the
[48:55] first century
[48:59] you see even those that Paul led to
[49:02] Christ
[49:04] when it come right down at the end of
[49:06] his life
[49:07] even some of them
[49:09] turned on him
[49:11] when Paul stands before the judicial
[49:14] system for his first preliminary hearing
[49:19] under so-called Roman Justice
[49:24] no one from Ephesus
[49:27] no one from Rome
[49:29] not one Christian not one preacher not
[49:33] one teacher not one Apostle no one
[49:39] stood with him
[49:43] and yet Ephesus wasn't that far away and
[49:46] the Ephesian church was one of the
[49:47] deepest churches in the message
[49:50] there was hundreds of Believers in the
[49:53] Roman church but not one Christian
[49:56] he had not one witness that was willing
[50:00] to come and say I will stand for this
[50:02] man's credibility he's a man of great
[50:05] honor a man of great Integrity not one
[50:10] believer not one Holy Ghost Field child
[50:15] of God
[50:16] stood
[50:17] for Paul
[50:21] he actually prayed for them
[50:24] that God would not lay that sin to their
[50:27] charge
[50:29] do you realize what they've done
[50:32] when they treated Paul that way
[50:35] they sinned
[50:43] Lord God
[50:46] as unknown and yet well known
[50:50] as dying behold we live as chastened
[50:55] and not killed that's sorrowful
[50:57] yet always rejoicing
[51:00] as poor yet making many rich
[51:03] as having nothing
[51:06] yet possessing all things this man when
[51:09] he come down
[51:10] when he writes Timothy
[51:13] just a few months from his death
[51:16] and he writes Timothy he says
[51:19] make haste and come
[51:22] and he tells them in another place to
[51:24] come before winter time now the reason
[51:26] was because they shut down the sailing
[51:29] of the ships to the Aegean and the
[51:33] Mediterranean parts of the Mediterranean
[51:35] because it was so rough in the winter
[51:37] season it was not worth the risk to sail
[51:39] boats
[51:41] so Paul told Timothy hurry
[51:45] if you don't come you won't see me alive
[51:49] hurry please come
[51:51] why
[51:52] because every Christian in Rome
[51:56] forsooking
[52:05] so he tells Timothy when you come
[52:07] through troas
[52:08] would you bring that cloak
[52:11] I forgot my coat there
[52:15] and this man was so poor
[52:21] he had one cup
[52:25] so what would have been your view
[52:27] of this man
[52:29] where would some of you stood if you was
[52:32] an Ephesian Christian
[52:34] any of your brothers any of your sisters
[52:36] any of your young people
[52:38] any preachers
[52:40] been willing to show up in the judicial
[52:42] court of Rome
[52:44] and said I will stand for this man of
[52:47] God
[52:50] or would we stayed at the house
[52:54] and said well I I prayed about it and I
[52:57] I didn't feel that
[53:02] and yet he begot them to the Lord
[53:05] he prayed with them so they were filled
[53:07] with the Holy Ghost
[53:09] he led them through the darkest sins
[53:12] LED them back to Christ when they
[53:15] backslid and when he needed a friend
[53:18] he had this many
[53:28] I pray God will honor Paul's prayer
[53:32] and forgive all them people
[53:36] why would God
[53:40] I think sometimes
[53:42] you know you go through a Lawton
[53:44] whenever you do you get to feeling sorry
[53:46] for yourself you know how we are
[53:48] I'll go to reading about some of this
[53:50] stuff right here
[53:51] what some of these men of God went
[53:53] through it I think I ain't been through
[53:55] nothing
[53:57] I ain't hardly been through Nothing in
[53:59] life
[54:02] notice this is what God tells Paul about
[54:05] the city of Corinth Acts chapter 18
[54:08] verse 10.
[54:10] for I am with thee and no man shall set
[54:14] on thee to hurt thee for I have much
[54:16] people
[54:17] in this city and remember this is a
[54:20] wicked terrible place but God says he
[54:23] has a lot of people a lot of elect
[54:25] they're in Corinth
[54:28] and he continued there a year and six
[54:31] months
[54:33] teaching the word of God
[54:36] now Paul Had A peculiar way about him
[54:39] well look at it Wednesday night I don't
[54:41] want to Sidetrack today but Paul would
[54:44] not go in
[54:45] and start a work
[54:48] in an area where there was already one
[54:52] no you don't find that that's totally
[54:54] contrary to the scripture
[54:56] Paul went hundreds and hundreds of miles
[55:00] away from where there was any works of
[55:03] God going on
[55:05] so here he goes to this horrible Wicked
[55:08] sinful City because God told him to go
[55:12] now once it gets there and he stays for
[55:15] 18 months the longest historical record
[55:18] that we have where he stayed in any
[55:20] given city of all of his trips
[55:23] now remember this man traveled thousands
[55:26] of miles
[55:27] by feet by Ox cart by ship
[55:32] a real missionary
[55:34] he didn't go down the road and start
[55:36] another word I wonder why he'd done it
[55:39] it was contrary to what God gave him you
[55:42] see
[55:43] so he would travel for hundreds and
[55:45] hundreds of miles well so I want
[55:47] scripture for that I've got it but I'd
[55:49] say I'm gonna give it to you now
[55:52] now whenever he goes there then and then
[55:55] he establishes the church
[55:57] and then he goes to colossi goes to
[56:00] Philippi he goes to thessalonica
[56:04] and then false prophets and apostles
[56:07] they start coming in from Jerusalem and
[56:11] from other places and they go to sowing
[56:14] Discord in the church and causing all
[56:16] kinds of problems in the church
[56:19] I know you might find it hard to believe
[56:21] but some of the Corinthian believers
[56:24] which are actually saved under Paul's
[56:27] Ministry
[56:28] started siding with some of these false
[56:31] Apostles he called them different titles
[56:34] but false Apostles and false evil
[56:38] workers
[56:39] and they started blasting Paul and Saint
[56:43] Paul was off the word
[56:45] and some of these people that had come
[56:48] from the world under Paul's Ministry and
[56:51] got converted and got the Holy Ghost and
[56:54] they actually turned against Paul
[56:58] and started taking sides with these
[57:01] false prophets not what they started
[57:02] claiming was of course that they were
[57:04] the true prophets and they were the true
[57:06] Apostles and you remember the judaizer
[57:09] has done the same thing to the church in
[57:11] galatia but keep in mind that Satan is
[57:15] not the originator of true missionaries
[57:18] but God is God is the one who sends
[57:21] forth the true missionaries and then
[57:23] after they go in and establish a work
[57:25] then Satan will send his preachers in
[57:28] afterwards and cause them of course
[57:30] Ministers of like and they will come in
[57:33] afterwards and then sow in Discord and
[57:36] so on and so on it's always been the
[57:38] same pattern and it always will be so if
[57:41] you've ever wondered why that Paul wrote
[57:44] this in second Corinthians 11 whenever
[57:46] he goes to talking about it seems like
[57:49] he's bragging about himself
[57:51] and it seems like that he's just going
[57:54] on and on and talking about what God did
[57:57] through him and how God did this and did
[57:59] that and basically what Paul is having
[58:02] to do that because the false prophets
[58:05] have come through into the church at
[58:07] Corinth and they have run him down to no
[58:09] end and there were real children of God
[58:12] sitting there and they took sides with
[58:15] these false prophets against their own
[58:18] church AIDS messenger
[58:21] well Mama second Corinthians chapter 11
[58:25] verse 22. Now watch how he approaches
[58:27] this are they Hebrews they who these
[58:31] false Apostles false prophets false
[58:34] teachers so he said are they Hebrews so
[58:38] it lets us know they were are they
[58:40] Hebrews so am I are they Israelites so
[58:44] am I are they Seed of Abraham so am I
[58:48] now no doubt this is what they were
[58:49] telling the the people that are in
[58:52] Koreans which were a mixture of Gentiles
[58:54] and Jews mainly Gentiles and they were
[58:56] telling them look we are the certain
[58:58] certain tribe and we belong to so and so
[59:00] on my grandpa was in the prophet's
[59:02] meetings and my uncle was there in the
[59:04] prayer line and this and that and the
[59:05] other as if though that gives them some
[59:07] type of credentials well I'll tell you
[59:10] one thing I was this and that and the
[59:11] other one Paul said well what they are
[59:13] I'm that too and even more now I don't
[59:16] doubt someone said Lord have mercy what
[59:18] in the world is he bragging about it's a
[59:20] shame really and one sense that Paul
[59:23] would have to be able to incorporate
[59:26] this into the scripture into the Holy
[59:29] Bible because you had men there that
[59:31] were so running and down and absolutely
[59:34] tinging his credibility among the church
[59:38] he had founded isn't it amazing how
[59:41] people are
[59:42] are the Hebrews so am I or the
[59:44] Israelites so am I or the Seed of
[59:46] Abraham so am I are they Ministers of
[59:49] Christ I speak as a fool
[59:57] notice what his response was I
[1:00:01] am more
[1:00:05] and labors
[1:00:07] more abundant
[1:00:09] in Stripes above measure
[1:00:13] in prisons more frequent
[1:00:16] Clement one of the early writers of the
[1:00:20] first century who wrote at the end of
[1:00:23] the first century said that Paul is
[1:00:26] imprisoned seven times
[1:00:30] seven times
[1:00:32] so he said so they claim they're this
[1:00:34] and that and the other he said
[1:00:35] everything they are I'm more
[1:00:39] wow
[1:00:40] what a shame that a preacher has to get
[1:00:43] up and say such things or write in the
[1:00:47] passage of the New Testament and this to
[1:00:49] be read for two thousand years and
[1:00:52] people trying to figure out why in the
[1:00:54] world was Paul saying that it was
[1:00:55] because them false the prophets and
[1:00:57] false Apostles and false workers were
[1:01:00] coming in and attacking the very church
[1:01:03] that God led him to start
[1:01:07] well praise the Lord
[1:01:09] amen so he says he was in labors more
[1:01:12] often more abundant and Stripes above
[1:01:14] master in prisons more frequent and
[1:01:17] deaths often isn't it amazing that he
[1:01:19] didn't mention how many more Devils he
[1:01:21] cast out
[1:01:22] how many more sick did he heal how many
[1:01:25] more dead that he raised it's not
[1:01:27] something which is the way a lot of
[1:01:29] times that we compare preachers you know
[1:01:31] that we say well how many discernments
[1:01:33] does he have or how many miracles does
[1:01:35] he have and I'll tell you if he's a man
[1:01:36] of God or not you need to read Matthew
[1:01:37] 24 and you'll find out there'll be all
[1:01:40] kinds of miracle workers that'll have a
[1:01:42] whole lot more miracles maybe than even
[1:01:44] some of our message preachers do and
[1:01:46] they'll be lost and go to hell
[1:01:49] because you can have Miracles and it
[1:01:51] still don't mean you're a son of God
[1:01:54] well praise the Lord
[1:01:58] notice verse 24. of the Jews five times
[1:02:05] received our 40 Stripes save one
[1:02:08] so five times brother Jack he was beaten
[1:02:12] with 39 stripes
[1:02:15] so I find it so amazing that his
[1:02:19] credentials now of what he's identifying
[1:02:22] himself as being a true servant of God
[1:02:25] is that it's not healings signs wonders
[1:02:29] Miracles death to the understanding of
[1:02:32] the word he's Allowing God to separate
[1:02:35] him from the false by how God is
[1:02:39] measuring him for his crown
[1:02:42] because those false guys are not being
[1:02:45] measured for their crown
[1:02:48] because everybody loves them
[1:02:51] now they were politicians you see so
[1:02:53] they knew what to say how to say it at
[1:02:56] the right time
[1:02:57] so here Paul is identifying himself as a
[1:03:00] true man of God by what he went through
[1:03:03] and not just how many folks he prayed
[1:03:06] for
[1:03:07] instance is this your Bible or not
[1:03:10] you do believe this right am I in the
[1:03:12] right place this morning I thought I was
[1:03:14] the pastor of this church I remember
[1:03:15] laying some Miss Stone I remember
[1:03:17] staining all this stuff here I remember
[1:03:19] am I in the wrong place this morning
[1:03:20] really okay I just want to make sure
[1:03:22] because y'all y'all look at me really
[1:03:24] strange
[1:03:26] so why would a preacher
[1:03:28] want to separate himself by identity and
[1:03:33] not just sign to sign well I cast out a
[1:03:36] devil one time well that ain't nothing
[1:03:38] I've cast out five well that ain't
[1:03:40] nothing I cast out ten
[1:03:42] but Paul didn't even go that way
[1:03:44] but he went by the size of the Cross
[1:03:47] measuring him for the crown because he
[1:03:49] knew unless these guys got converted
[1:03:51] they had no Crown anyway
[1:03:57] notice he says of the Jews five times
[1:03:59] received die 40 Stripes save one
[1:04:02] Thrice
[1:04:04] was I beaten with rods
[1:04:10] Lord God
[1:04:13] once was I stoned
[1:04:17] so if I die tomorrow and you guys are
[1:04:19] looking for another pastor and a guy
[1:04:21] like this sends in his resume all this
[1:04:23] is listed on his resume
[1:04:25] would he get off the ground
[1:04:28] which I'll even consider a guy like this
[1:04:33] think about it Thrice was I beaten with
[1:04:36] rods once was I Stone Thrice I suffered
[1:04:39] shipwreck
[1:04:42] a night and a day have I been in the
[1:04:45] Deep
[1:04:46] in journeyings often
[1:04:49] in pales of waters and Perils of robbers
[1:04:54] of course it didn't take them old boys
[1:04:55] long enough to realize they'd wasted
[1:04:57] their time with this guy he didn't have
[1:04:59] nothing
[1:05:01] you know they'd probably give him money
[1:05:03] by the day to buy him some lunch when he
[1:05:04] got down the road because this man
[1:05:06] didn't have nothing he only had one coat
[1:05:08] and left it by control us and he left
[1:05:10] his scripts in another place and said
[1:05:12] would you get my books because I want to
[1:05:13] say that the message a little more I
[1:05:15] forgot him over that night I left and
[1:05:17] bring my books back and bring my coat
[1:05:19] and he'd get among Perils of robbers and
[1:05:21] which they producer Saudi Arabia in them
[1:05:23] places and still do to the day and he
[1:05:25] would go through that all right hold it
[1:05:27] up buddy hold it up he said boys I'm
[1:05:29] telling you once I ain't got nothing
[1:05:31] y'all right we've heard that before well
[1:05:33] that robbed him and said what do you do
[1:05:34] for a living and said I'm a Holiness
[1:05:36] preacher
[1:05:37] I'm a holy ghost fail preacher well come
[1:05:40] on somebody preached with me this
[1:05:42] morning well you imagine them old robber
[1:05:44] said don't bother him I don't try to
[1:05:46] hold him up before round it'll cost me
[1:05:48] fifty dollars I bought the boy a room I
[1:05:50] bought her a pair of shoes I bought him
[1:05:51] this and the other man I ain't never
[1:05:53] seen a preacher so poor and yet hear a
[1:05:55] Paul separates himself from those guys
[1:05:58] that are false prophets by what the size
[1:06:02] of his cross
[1:06:06] because God makes
[1:06:08] number state
[1:06:15] mistake in Perils of robbers and perils
[1:06:17] by my own countrymen
[1:06:19] and perils by the heathen in perils in
[1:06:23] the city in perils in the wilderness a
[1:06:26] man of God
[1:06:27] a prophet of God went through all of
[1:06:30] this stuff
[1:06:35] perils in the wilderness pills and the
[1:06:37] Sea perils among false brethren
[1:06:41] and weariness
[1:06:44] painfulness in watching soften
[1:06:48] in hunger
[1:06:53] they ain't talking between breakfast and
[1:06:55] lunch
[1:06:59] I wonder how many days he went
[1:07:03] that he didn't have nothing to eat
[1:07:07] I thought David said I was all young and
[1:07:10] now I'm old and I've never seen the
[1:07:12] righteous forsaken nor is seed beg in
[1:07:14] prayer
[1:07:15] I thought David said Delight thyself
[1:07:17] falls on the Lord let me give you the
[1:07:19] desires of your heart why is God
[1:07:22] making the most important man on the
[1:07:25] earth at that time
[1:07:27] goes through hunger
[1:07:33] he's in the measuring room
[1:07:37] hold your arms out Paul
[1:07:40] stand normally now
[1:07:44] whenever I bought this suit on sale
[1:07:47] 79 maybe 99 something like that what we
[1:07:51] paid for it
[1:07:52] been hung in the closet for a bit
[1:07:55] Carol's just been so busy hadn't been
[1:07:57] able to
[1:07:58] cuff the trousers for me
[1:08:02] so I had to go down in their sewing room
[1:08:04] and to be able to try them on and then
[1:08:06] stand there I'll move around I'm you
[1:08:09] know kind of a moving sort of evolution
[1:08:10] stand still I'm on a poke this pen if
[1:08:13] you don't stand still
[1:08:15] she wasn't going to do it intentionally
[1:08:16] she isn't going to do it by mistake
[1:08:18] because I was moving
[1:08:20] so I had to get in her room
[1:08:23] I've got one leg shorter than the other
[1:08:26] one
[1:08:27] so she has to do them according to that
[1:08:32] but I had to be there and stand long
[1:08:35] enough
[1:08:36] and she wanted to change this and modify
[1:08:40] that
[1:08:41] so women have done any good for her to
[1:08:43] call Brother Adam without him come over
[1:08:45] and and try on Donnie's suit were not
[1:08:48] the same size
[1:08:50] it wasn't any good for her to call Harry
[1:08:52] Harry skinny is a bean Pole
[1:08:55] always has been
[1:08:58] bless his heart out if he does I get his
[1:08:59] tapeworm
[1:09:03] so it has to be me
[1:09:08] oh children
[1:09:11] if God's handed out gifts we're all
[1:09:13] standing to learn
[1:09:14] if God's handed out this and that and
[1:09:16] how they're all standing in life but how
[1:09:18] many wants to stand in line when he
[1:09:20] calls you into his tailoring room
[1:09:23] and then we say oh no oh no oh no not me
[1:09:27] not me no God no
[1:09:31] may God give us the courage
[1:09:35] when he calls us into his room and says
[1:09:39] try it on
[1:09:48] home
[1:09:51] Paul says in awareness and painfulness
[1:09:53] and watching's often in hunger
[1:09:55] and thirst
[1:09:57] and fast things often in cold
[1:10:03] what's the next one
[1:10:07] you need a prophet of God
[1:10:10] would set and shiver
[1:10:14] in the cold nights or the cold mornings
[1:10:16] and he didn't even have enough money to
[1:10:19] buy another coat
[1:10:23] you see why I'm reading these scriptures
[1:10:24] whenever I get down and kind of worry
[1:10:25] because I think I ain't never been
[1:10:27] through a whole lot in my life
[1:10:28] I don't even want to stand beside people
[1:10:30] like this put me way way back away from
[1:10:32] people like this
[1:10:35] how in the world by the way can we walk
[1:10:37] before them
[1:10:38] people that have gone through what
[1:10:40] they've gone through and we bellyache
[1:10:42] and cry over a little this and that and
[1:10:44] the other oh my goodness
[1:10:50] and fast things often in cold
[1:10:53] and nakedness
[1:10:55] besides those things that are without
[1:10:59] that which cometh upon me daily
[1:11:03] the care
[1:11:04] of all the churches
[1:11:08] you see I was an apostle and a prophet
[1:11:10] in that first church age he was not in
[1:11:13] charge of one particular congregation
[1:11:18] but he was over the entire church
[1:11:22] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:28] water responsibility
[1:11:33] so all the churches in that first
[1:11:36] century
[1:11:37] he was at the oversight
[1:11:40] of them all
[1:11:42] notice it says in second Corinthians 10
[1:11:45] verse 8 for though I should boast
[1:11:47] somewhat more of our Authority which the
[1:11:49] Lord has given us for edification
[1:11:52] and not for your destruction I should
[1:11:55] not be ashamed that I may not seem as if
[1:11:58] I would terrify You by letters
[1:12:01] now if you've read very many of his
[1:12:03] letters you know he could be pretty
[1:12:05] terrified
[1:12:07] for his lighters and I want you to
[1:12:09] listen to some of the things that was
[1:12:11] being said about this church AIDS
[1:12:14] messenger
[1:12:16] for his letters say they
[1:12:20] always felt sorry for them I don't know
[1:12:23] who them are but they are they and they
[1:12:25] are them we've got some of their kin
[1:12:27] still alive today I'm afraid
[1:12:30] for his letters say they are weighty and
[1:12:34] Powerful but his bodily presence is weak
[1:12:38] and his speech contemptible damnable
[1:12:44] was out basis of Truth
[1:12:48] so you mean some of the Corinthian
[1:12:50] people were saying this about their
[1:12:53] churches messenger
[1:12:55] some of the very ones that he said you
[1:12:58] were this and you were that but now are
[1:13:00] you clean and now are you washed and
[1:13:03] they had got among some false teachers
[1:13:05] and they begin to
[1:13:07] sway them away from the truth
[1:13:11] dear Lord
[1:13:14] a Roman historian called naciferous
[1:13:18] says about Paul
[1:13:20] hey on a small and a contracted body
[1:13:24] somewhat crooked
[1:13:27] and bowed
[1:13:29] a pale face
[1:13:31] looked old
[1:13:33] I had a little head
[1:13:36] and had a sharp eye
[1:13:38] and his eyebrows hung downwards
[1:13:42] so he definitely wasn't an Elvis
[1:13:49] his nose was bent somewhat long
[1:13:54] his beard thick and pretty long and that
[1:13:57] as the hair of his head had a sprinkling
[1:14:00] of gray hairs
[1:14:04] do you imagine when he stood up there he
[1:14:06] did not come in a three-piece suit the
[1:14:08] way I am today
[1:14:10] he did not look even like some of these
[1:14:12] brothers sitting here now
[1:14:14] find handsome young men and older
[1:14:17] brothers
[1:14:19] but he would have been a pretty pitiful
[1:14:21] excuse of a Preacher
[1:14:24] kind of bent over
[1:14:26] bowled a little bit
[1:14:28] and a sprinkling of gray in his beard
[1:14:31] quite long
[1:14:33] almost bald-headed
[1:14:35] sharp looking eyes
[1:14:38] type of guy that you just got the creeps
[1:14:41] you know just the Willies just look at
[1:14:43] he sends chills all over me just look at
[1:14:46] that guy who who in the world is that
[1:14:48] first church AIDS messenger the angel of
[1:14:51] the Lord to the church at Ephesus
[1:14:57] follow paper which was another historian
[1:15:00] Roman historian
[1:15:01] scoff English says of Paul
[1:15:04] when the bald-headed Galilean met me now
[1:15:08] this Roman historian actually met him
[1:15:11] when the bald-headed Galilee and met me
[1:15:13] with his hook nose
[1:15:16] which went through the air
[1:15:18] to the third heaven
[1:15:23] that is a nose ain't it
[1:15:27] this was the type of a man that God
[1:15:30] chose
[1:15:31] would we have been okay with that type
[1:15:33] of a man
[1:15:40] second Corinthians chapter 10
[1:15:42] verse 11. now Paul says they're saying
[1:15:45] boy his way his little words is really
[1:15:47] powerful but when he comes he's a puny
[1:15:50] looking feller but verse 11 he said
[1:15:52] let's not just wanted to think this that
[1:15:54] such as we are in Word by letters when
[1:15:57] we are absent such will we be also
[1:16:00] indeed when we are present oh my
[1:16:03] goodness
[1:16:04] for we dare not make ourselves of the
[1:16:08] number or compare ourselves
[1:16:10] of ourselves with them that command
[1:16:13] themselves but they measuring themselves
[1:16:16] by themselves which is what most of us
[1:16:19] do
[1:16:21] we are the measuring tape
[1:16:23] and we measure ourselves by ourselves
[1:16:27] so we are the measuring tape and we
[1:16:30] measure ourselves that's why there's
[1:16:32] hardly any self-condemnation the age
[1:16:34] that we're living in because the
[1:16:36] self-examination is wrong
[1:16:39] the self-examination uses us well I
[1:16:41] think and I believe and this is my
[1:16:43] opinion and I don't like and I I there's
[1:16:46] your measuring tape and City you should
[1:16:49] be saying well what does the word say
[1:16:50] what does the Bible say what does the
[1:16:52] message say what do we talk why don't we
[1:16:54] talk from the scripture why do we talk
[1:16:56] but instead we have at our handy little
[1:16:59] measuring tape and
[1:17:01] I think and I believe and this is what
[1:17:03] my daddy said and my grandma said this
[1:17:05] and Aunt Matilda said this and ain't
[1:17:06] juicy Bell said this and Uncle so-and-so
[1:17:08] said that yep see there they are they're
[1:17:10] all them little numbers on your tape
[1:17:11] Uncle Fred and Uncle Joe and so and so
[1:17:14] and grandpa so and so on your little
[1:17:15] great uncle so and so that's all them
[1:17:17] little marks right there well I've
[1:17:18] always been this way and I plan to be
[1:17:20] this way the rest of my life where
[1:17:21] you'll be that way when you go to hell
[1:17:23] except it won't matter then will you you
[1:17:25] see God don't he accepts a show we can
[1:17:27] come to God a liar we can come to God a
[1:17:29] prostitute we can come to God all kinds
[1:17:32] of evil but if you ever get to God you
[1:17:34] won't say like you were when you got
[1:17:35] there you will be different but lay it a
[1:17:39] seal said Oh Come As You Are and y'all
[1:17:41] they want you to stay as you are but the
[1:17:44] Gospel of Jesus Christ changes us from
[1:17:47] what we are to what he wants us to be
[1:17:49] not what we want to be well I think we
[1:17:53] have no thought coming
[1:17:58] oh my goodness
[1:18:01] let me share this with you in 1961 it's
[1:18:04] tremendous quote mother man said God
[1:18:06] demands respect for his servants his
[1:18:09] servants you know how you know they are
[1:18:11] his servants because he vindicates his
[1:18:13] servants by his word
[1:18:15] he takes these servants and makes them
[1:18:18] Servants of God and proves that they are
[1:18:21] servants by making his word work through
[1:18:25] them servants
[1:18:27] then as you respect that servant
[1:18:31] you respect God
[1:18:34] but now it's heaven and a lot of them
[1:18:36] Corinthian Christians did not have this
[1:18:38] principle
[1:18:39] so they felt like that God maybe had
[1:18:42] used Paul and yeah I touched him and all
[1:18:44] that sort of thing but yet Paul somehow
[1:18:47] they had been affected in their thinking
[1:18:49] toward him and now they believed that
[1:18:51] somehow he was a lesser man of God or
[1:18:53] he's a lesser Prophet or the Seer to the
[1:18:56] age
[1:18:57] they didn't realize that by not showing
[1:18:59] up at Paul's trial
[1:19:03] they done it to Jesus
[1:19:10] I wonder today France
[1:19:13] or yourself I've been there
[1:19:16] well I'll tell you what you can do
[1:19:18] you can judge the way you do now
[1:19:21] and the way you treat God's servants now
[1:19:24] and it will tell you exactly what you
[1:19:26] would have done in the days of Paul
[1:19:32] because I'm his little brother
[1:19:34] Daryl is his little brother these other
[1:19:36] preachers here were his little brothers
[1:19:38] so the way you treat us in our age is
[1:19:42] the way you would have treated Paul as
[1:19:44] you lived in his age the people that
[1:19:46] have embraced the message for years and
[1:19:48] years and turn away now blessed the
[1:19:49] prophet and all this that and the other
[1:19:51] they would have done the exact same
[1:19:53] thing to Paul oh if I'd been in the days
[1:19:55] of Paul you had done him exactly the
[1:19:56] same way you did the messenger of
[1:19:58] Malachi 4.
[1:20:00] now watch brother man goes on to say so
[1:20:02] when I respect you and you respect me
[1:20:05] and we respect each other then we're
[1:20:08] respecting God that ought to help every
[1:20:10] one of us want to respect one another it
[1:20:12] don't mean we go along with one another
[1:20:14] on everything but we still respect one
[1:20:16] another as children of the Living God
[1:20:19] and the church said
[1:20:22] now kind of go on a few more minutes
[1:20:23] watch I'm going to be if you would in
[1:20:25] Galatians chapter 1 verse 6. look at
[1:20:27] some of the troubles that Paul was demon
[1:20:29] down the galatian church so here God is
[1:20:32] actually letting him go through fast
[1:20:33] things through trials through all this
[1:20:35] sort of thing and then he's got all the
[1:20:37] churches Lord have mercy I cannot
[1:20:39] imagine the only thing I'm grateful for
[1:20:42] in the days that Paul was they didn't
[1:20:43] have phones instant messaging texting
[1:20:46] emails and all that it might have took
[1:20:49] weeks and months for Paul to heard about
[1:20:51] something going on in the galatian
[1:20:52] church if it happened this morning he'd
[1:20:54] heard it by noon as soon as he got done
[1:20:56] preaching if they live in this modern
[1:20:57] day as a technology so God knows exactly
[1:21:00] where to place a man don't he but you
[1:21:02] imagine every church now that he founded
[1:21:04] this man in one of his missionary trust
[1:21:07] won over 700 miles one way
[1:21:10] show me where Paul ever established a
[1:21:12] church in Jerusalem
[1:21:15] look where Peter went James went
[1:21:17] Bartholomew John show me where Paul
[1:21:20] followed in their steps
[1:21:22] and started another church
[1:21:26] he didn't
[1:21:29] well I'm sorry y'all didn't know that's
[1:21:30] in the Bible
[1:21:33] now watch what had happened in the
[1:21:35] galatian church now remember these were
[1:21:37] Jews and they were called judaizers they
[1:21:39] were apostate judaizers so they come to
[1:21:42] the church in galatia was mainly
[1:21:43] Gentiles and they so tell them you all
[1:21:45] got to be circumcised
[1:21:47] why you all can't believe the Holy Ghost
[1:21:49] why you ain't got no Holy Ghost you're
[1:21:50] if you're going to be in the seat of
[1:21:52] Abraham you've got to become a gentile
[1:21:53] convert oh they said well we're already
[1:21:55] converted Oh no you're not you're eating
[1:21:57] sausage for breakfast
[1:21:59] you about your heathens you got a
[1:22:02] Baconator for lunch and sauces for
[1:22:04] breakfast and pork chops for supper why
[1:22:06] no other matter but you bunch of
[1:22:07] heathens y'all ain't Believers while
[1:22:09] there ain't no way in the world and a
[1:22:11] bunch of them Galatians start saying oh
[1:22:13] okay why there was legalizers among the
[1:22:16] Galatians
[1:22:17] and their nature was legalistic so they
[1:22:19] said Okay okay so what do we need to do
[1:22:22] Thou shalt not and thou shalt not and
[1:22:24] thou shalt not yes so that's what we'll
[1:22:26] do
[1:22:29] so here a poor old brother Paul bless
[1:22:32] his heart if he didn't have enough his
[1:22:34] already demon with
[1:22:36] notice how he writes to him in chapter 1
[1:22:38] verse 6. I Marvel that ye are so soon
[1:22:42] removed
[1:22:44] from him that called you unto the grace
[1:22:47] of Christ
[1:22:49] unto another gospel
[1:22:52] to be honest with you friends when I
[1:22:54] read these things especially when
[1:22:55] they're accumulative like this this
[1:22:57] morning when I read all this I'm
[1:22:58] thinking my mind how was this man even
[1:23:00] able to put up with all of this
[1:23:03] how could he do it and no doubt they
[1:23:05] were spread apart they didn't happen you
[1:23:07] know one day after another one week
[1:23:09] after another he couldn't have took it
[1:23:10] by the Paul it would have just wiped him
[1:23:12] out and they were sped over a period of
[1:23:13] months and years
[1:23:15] and he would get one thing resolved and
[1:23:17] something else would come up and he'd
[1:23:18] get that church sort of straightened out
[1:23:20] and another thing would come up
[1:23:24] he says which is not another
[1:23:27] but there be some that trouble you and
[1:23:30] would pervert the gospel of Christ
[1:23:34] chapter 3 verse 1. oh oh foolish
[1:23:40] Galatians who
[1:23:42] has
[1:23:44] Bewitched you
[1:23:49] now what was it judaizers
[1:23:53] what were they doing come outside you
[1:23:55] can't believe that Paul
[1:23:57] oh you can't believe that why have you
[1:24:00] ever really checked his stories
[1:24:03] well I'll tell woman you get time now
[1:24:05] you read in the book of Acts well they
[1:24:08] talk about that Pillar of Fire and all
[1:24:10] that stuff coming down and then see
[1:24:12] where Paul told about it himself
[1:24:15] and you'll find there's two different
[1:24:16] Tales there
[1:24:19] how can you trust a man like that that
[1:24:21] ain't got a hundred percent recall well
[1:24:23] you'd never trust one thing because
[1:24:24] ain't nobody got that
[1:24:27] well how in the world could you believe
[1:24:29] Paul was a man of God and he packs a
[1:24:32] doctor around with him
[1:24:34] Luke was a physician
[1:24:37] and Paul left trophemus one of his
[1:24:40] Faithful Servants back in one of the
[1:24:42] Cities sick
[1:24:44] and carries a doctor around with him and
[1:24:47] supposedly lays hands on the sick and
[1:24:49] they recover and left his body back
[1:24:51] there on the city sick don't sound like
[1:24:54] no man of God to me
[1:24:57] friends don't you understand what
[1:24:58] they've done to them they've done the
[1:25:00] same thing to them men of God that
[1:25:02] people are trying to do today to our
[1:25:04] Prophet until our pastors and our
[1:25:06] genuine evangelists come on Church why
[1:25:09] because Satan knows the vulnerability of
[1:25:11] humanity we're not first century we're
[1:25:14] not Greeks we're not cynthians we're not
[1:25:16] many of those but they're so much like
[1:25:19] us about exactly the same as it was
[1:25:21] within people same as it was in The Book
[1:25:24] of Numbers Chapter 14. humans are humans
[1:25:27] that's why they all got to be saved it
[1:25:29] will perish
[1:25:32] oh my
[1:25:34] all foolish Galatians how this must have
[1:25:37] broke his heart to say this
[1:25:39] who hath Bewitched you
[1:25:43] so they were Bewitched
[1:25:45] but by whom preachers
[1:25:49] now this was not a wizard
[1:25:51] this was not a witch
[1:25:54] it was somebody preaching another gospel
[1:25:57] another Jesus
[1:26:01] that you should not obey the truth
[1:26:03] before whose eyes
[1:26:06] Jesus Christ has been evidently set
[1:26:10] forth crucified among you
[1:26:14] in galatia
[1:26:17] Jesus was not crucified in galatia
[1:26:20] he was crucified in Jerusalem
[1:26:23] what Paul is saying
[1:26:26] God allowed him to preach the cross in
[1:26:29] such a real way that they were sitting
[1:26:32] at the cross
[1:26:33] he allowed Paul to step into an
[1:26:36] anointing in such a real way my goodness
[1:26:39] brother Daryl preached it for us a few
[1:26:40] years ago on an Easter Sermon I was
[1:26:42] sitting on the platform behind him I
[1:26:43] thought I was going to get up and leave
[1:26:45] it was so real to me I could see the
[1:26:47] blood going out of his body I could see
[1:26:50] his muscles twitching on the cross I
[1:26:52] could see the agony it was so that's my
[1:26:55] makeup I'm a dramatic preacher anyway
[1:26:56] and when I hear drama tears me all the
[1:26:58] pieces as I sat there and I was in pain
[1:27:01] you may think I'm nuts I felt pain
[1:27:04] running through my body
[1:27:07] and Paul said God allowed me to preach
[1:27:10] Jesus Christ to you in such a way that
[1:27:13] you walked away from there as if though
[1:27:16] you had been at the cross
[1:27:21] oh
[1:27:25] and he says this only what I learned of
[1:27:28] you
[1:27:29] receives you the Spirit by The Works of
[1:27:31] the law
[1:27:33] or the hearing of Faith are you so
[1:27:35] foolish
[1:27:37] mama
[1:27:40] having begun in the spirit now made
[1:27:42] perfect by the flesh
[1:27:46] these poor Galatians
[1:27:48] so what did they do you mean brother
[1:27:50] Donnie they had an effect on real
[1:27:52] genuine Believers yes
[1:27:56] I'm going to shock some of you Plumb
[1:27:58] down to your socks
[1:28:00] brother Charlie Cox told me years ago
[1:28:01] there was a woman preacher in
[1:28:03] Jeffersonville
[1:28:04] my brother Branham was here
[1:28:07] and it was amazing the effect that woman
[1:28:10] preacher had on some of the people from
[1:28:12] The Tabernacle
[1:28:14] right brother Paul
[1:28:16] and some of the people from the Branham
[1:28:18] Tabernacle left to follow
[1:28:21] a woman preacher
[1:28:29] I'll tell you one thing friends we
[1:28:32] better if we have ever been in our life
[1:28:34] better make sure our foundation is on
[1:28:38] Jesus Christ the word of God
[1:28:43] [Applause]
[1:28:52] can you imagine
[1:28:54] when the prophet set the church in order
[1:28:56] about gifts you know while other people
[1:28:57] done left the Branham Tabernacle went to
[1:29:00] other churches
[1:29:04] but they didn't go along with the
[1:29:05] prophet's teaching on it
[1:29:07] they thought they knew more about it
[1:29:08] than he did
[1:29:11] and if you listen to what he said he
[1:29:12] said a lot of us prophesying things that
[1:29:14] didn't even come to pass well come on
[1:29:16] don't sit there and look at me I'll bug
[1:29:17] God now if God if God anoints you or me
[1:29:20] or whoever it is to say thus saith the
[1:29:21] Lord that ain't you saying that that's
[1:29:23] God that says it well if God says Thou
[1:29:26] saith the Lord there's going to be a
[1:29:27] hurricane come through Tennessee and say
[1:29:28] there ain't never been one in their life
[1:29:30] if God said there's going to be one
[1:29:31] he'll make one come to Tennessee and if
[1:29:34] God says that there won't be no excuse
[1:29:36] well the winds changed and there was an
[1:29:38] upper draft that come down on the high
[1:29:40] Dome and the high pressure come on say
[1:29:42] it admit it you lied you missed God but
[1:29:44] God says something God Don't Lie When
[1:29:48] God Says something it will come to pass
[1:29:51] amen somebody say Amen because God don't
[1:29:56] make mistakes and the prophet said they
[1:29:59] were prophesying things that never
[1:30:00] happened saying things that never come
[1:30:03] to pass someone who said in order he
[1:30:05] said the spirit of Christ is subject to
[1:30:07] Christ's teaching so what some of them
[1:30:09] do they got mad and left
[1:30:13] the opportunity to set in the church
[1:30:15] where Elijah was the pastor
[1:30:22] mama
[1:30:24] Galatians 4 12. can I go a few more
[1:30:27] minutes
[1:30:29] Brethren I beseech you be as I am for I
[1:30:32] am as you are you have not injured me at
[1:30:34] all
[1:30:34] well you know house or infirmity of the
[1:30:36] flesh I'll preach the gospel unto you at
[1:30:38] first in my Temptation which was in my
[1:30:40] flesh you despise not nor rejected
[1:30:44] but receive me as an angel of God
[1:30:48] even as Christ Jesus
[1:30:52] but notice how people can change on you
[1:30:57] where is then the blessedness that you
[1:31:00] spake of for our bear record that had
[1:31:01] been possible you would have plucked out
[1:31:04] your own eyes and given them to me why
[1:31:07] because they would see his eyes running
[1:31:09] brothers that
[1:31:11] they would see his his letters and he
[1:31:14] made him in big letters
[1:31:17] because he couldn't hardly see
[1:31:20] and he said you all love me so much you
[1:31:22] would have pulled your own eyes out and
[1:31:24] gave them to me
[1:31:26] they said where's the blessedness that
[1:31:27] you spoke of me
[1:31:29] but now notice what it says am I
[1:31:31] therefore become your enemy because I'll
[1:31:33] tell you the truth
[1:31:34] the zealously affects you but not well
[1:31:38] they would exclude you that you might
[1:31:40] affect them in other words they won't
[1:31:42] listen to you your side of it so that
[1:31:45] you'll change them but they want their
[1:31:47] the other way around
[1:31:50] oh my goodness what is God doing
[1:31:53] measuring
[1:31:57] now Paul what are you going to do
[1:32:00] you're going to get an attitude against
[1:32:02] these people
[1:32:04] are you going to get hateful
[1:32:07] you're God's chosen messenger now Paul
[1:32:10] anointed of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:13] you Smit a man blind
[1:32:16] because he crossed you
[1:32:19] what are you going to do Paul
[1:32:22] second Timothy chapter 4 verse 9.
[1:32:25] Paul writing to Timothy now this is
[1:32:28] after the judicial thing that I told you
[1:32:30] about a while ago do thy diligence to
[1:32:31] come shortly unto me hurry and get here
[1:32:34] in other words
[1:32:36] oh my goodness he's only got a few more
[1:32:38] months left
[1:32:39] and in the closing days of his life
[1:32:42] he wants a dear trusted friend
[1:32:45] by his side
[1:32:48] for Demas
[1:32:50] have forsaken me
[1:32:52] having loved this present world
[1:32:57] and is departed into thessalonica
[1:32:59] Christians to galatia Titus unto
[1:33:02] Dalmatia
[1:33:03] that's amazing because Demas was a
[1:33:06] preacher a message preacher will call it
[1:33:10] and Paul mentions him first in
[1:33:12] Colossians chapter 4 verse 4 when Paul's
[1:33:14] in Rome the first time Luke the Beloved
[1:33:17] verse 14 rather Luke the Beloved
[1:33:19] Physician and Demas greet you
[1:33:22] Philemon chapter 1 verse 24 Marcus
[1:33:25] aristocritus Demas Lucas my fellow
[1:33:30] laborers
[1:33:31] so Demas was a close friend and a fellow
[1:33:35] laborer with Paul
[1:33:38] but when it come right down to it
[1:33:42] it was too risky being identified with
[1:33:45] Paul
[1:33:46] so Demas returned back and I do say back
[1:33:51] because historians say he was from
[1:33:53] thessalonica
[1:33:55] from a rich family Prophet tells us that
[1:33:58] present say to my Ministry he was from a
[1:34:01] rich family and wealthy
[1:34:03] and thessalonica was the capital of the
[1:34:08] Empire during part of this time period
[1:34:10] before Constantinople
[1:34:13] so it was a great Mega Center a lot of
[1:34:17] merchandise and Mercantile was very big
[1:34:19] there
[1:34:20] and when Paul really needed a friend
[1:34:25] what did Demas do
[1:34:27] slipped out
[1:34:31] Lord God
[1:34:34] so he chose those rich
[1:34:36] for his friends
[1:34:39] over this poor guy
[1:34:44] um
[1:34:45] I found this so amazing I actually sat
[1:34:48] yesterday as I was studying this and it
[1:34:51] took my breath
[1:34:53] listen to me it took my breath
[1:34:56] physically
[1:34:57] as I sat in the chair
[1:35:03] the patron saint
[1:35:06] of the city of thessalonica
[1:35:10] was Demetrius
[1:35:12] which is the extended form of the word
[1:35:15] Demas
[1:35:18] so under Catholicism Demas became the
[1:35:22] patron saint
[1:35:24] of thessalonica
[1:35:26] he was martyred in 290
[1:35:29] A.D or somewhere up in through there you
[1:35:31] know or that's when they set it up
[1:35:33] Rather
[1:35:34] that's when they made him the patron
[1:35:36] saint
[1:35:37] martyred sometime after Paul and 290 A.D
[1:35:40] they make the Declaration
[1:35:43] a man that betrayed God's prophet
[1:35:47] a man that turned his back on God's
[1:35:50] prophet and the church
[1:35:52] lifts him to sainthood
[1:35:57] and calls him
[1:35:58] the patron saint
[1:36:01] of our city
[1:36:08] God have mercy
[1:36:12] listen to astounding things that brother
[1:36:14] Branham says about him
[1:36:16] now I imagine Demas didn't forsake Him
[1:36:18] and start off tonight clubs
[1:36:21] I don't imagine Demons did that because
[1:36:23] Demas
[1:36:24] was a spirit
[1:36:27] filled man
[1:36:32] wow
[1:36:34] you understand you can have the baptism
[1:36:37] of the Holy Ghost every hour of your
[1:36:40] life
[1:36:42] and die lost
[1:36:44] and go to hell
[1:36:49] don't look at me funny I just quoted to
[1:36:51] your quote
[1:36:54] the baptism is your spirit how many
[1:36:56] people have we baptized up here and what
[1:36:58] do I do and the other brothers do put
[1:36:59] her hand over the mouth what for and
[1:37:01] their nose to put over like this to keep
[1:37:04] the water from going in their nose and
[1:37:05] their mouths a person can have the
[1:37:08] baptism in their Spirit every day and
[1:37:10] still not be regenerated from the soul I
[1:37:13] don't want it in my spirit alone I don't
[1:37:15] want it on my flesh I want that in my
[1:37:18] soul in my soul that'll Quicken me to
[1:37:21] every word of God and I will be willing
[1:37:23] to give my life
[1:37:28] if not
[1:37:32] I will forsake God's servants
[1:37:36] if I don't have the baptism of the Holy
[1:37:39] Ghost and my soul
[1:37:41] I'll not be able to stand the pressure
[1:37:42] that's coming
[1:37:45] amen
[1:37:49] demos was a Spirit-filled man
[1:37:53] he was a great helper
[1:37:56] if you ever took the history of demons
[1:37:58] he was a notable preacher
[1:38:01] a fine cultured man
[1:38:04] Holly polished
[1:38:06] educated
[1:38:08] smart man
[1:38:10] I believe bema saw a failing seemingly
[1:38:14] in Paul's Ministry
[1:38:16] I think he thought that old fellow was
[1:38:18] washed up before God
[1:38:22] demon said I ain't associating with a
[1:38:25] guy like that
[1:38:26] he's just a low class
[1:38:30] person
[1:38:35] let me tell you something Word of Life
[1:38:37] we think because of our new building and
[1:38:39] our fine carpet and this that and other
[1:38:41] and we look down at people that's poorer
[1:38:43] than us and maybe have to meet in a
[1:38:45] storefront and we're saying they ain't
[1:38:46] got what we got we won't have what we
[1:38:49] got long
[1:38:50] I'll tell you one thing I'd rather have
[1:38:52] the Holy Ghost in This big building
[1:38:58] don't you understand that's the Demon's
[1:39:00] anointing
[1:39:01] to go to looking at the real message
[1:39:03] people and looking down your nose at
[1:39:05] them
[1:39:06] somehow you're better
[1:39:09] tell me how
[1:39:11] 150 pound of Georgia dirt is better than
[1:39:15] a hundred and fifty pound of Kentucky
[1:39:16] dirt
[1:39:18] especially if it's all red clay
[1:39:21] tell me how 175 pound bag of Illinois
[1:39:25] dirt or Arizona dirt or Mississippi dirt
[1:39:29] is any better than Virginia dirt
[1:39:32] I don't know too much but I do know
[1:39:34] enough about dirt to know dirt is dirt
[1:39:38] I've seen dirt in Asia I've seen dirt in
[1:39:40] Africa I've seen dirt all over the world
[1:39:43] it's dirt everywhere I've been
[1:39:45] [Music]
[1:39:50] but this is what Dean must begin to say
[1:39:52] he's just a low class can you imagine a
[1:39:56] preacher
[1:39:57] looking at the men of God the church
[1:40:00] AIDS messenger children
[1:40:02] and send that guy
[1:40:05] he's just a low-class
[1:40:08] don't don't hang around him
[1:40:10] he says fetch ain't told
[1:40:15] you mark it down and you remember that
[1:40:18] an idiot from Kentucky told you one day
[1:40:21] it'll come to pass that the educated and
[1:40:24] the intellectual will become so dominant
[1:40:26] in and around our message they will be
[1:40:28] ashamed to quote God's prophet
[1:40:33] we're heading more that way every day I
[1:40:34] know you don't know it but we're heading
[1:40:36] more that way all the time that's why
[1:40:38] they've got to polish up the quotes
[1:40:39] they've got to change this and change
[1:40:41] that God chose a Kentuckian God chose a
[1:40:44] hillbilly for a reason God didn't choose
[1:40:47] a man from Harvard he chose a man from
[1:40:50] Mark's fall Hallelujah God did not
[1:40:52] choose an educated preacher he chose a
[1:40:56] preacher that couldn't even hardly fill
[1:40:57] out his notes we've got a glass case
[1:41:00] over in the library if you haven't seen
[1:41:03] it you need to go put your eyes on it
[1:41:05] and it shows you the handwritten notes
[1:41:07] of our Prophet you will stand there and
[1:41:09] see one word after another misspell the
[1:41:12] pronunciation in the wrong place not
[1:41:15] even using the right verb an adverb an
[1:41:18] adjective and now he might not have
[1:41:20] noticed his nouns and pronouns that he
[1:41:22] knowed almighty God he might not have
[1:41:25] been a great speaker like we think that
[1:41:28] he spoke in the person of the Lord Jesus
[1:41:32] Christ
[1:41:33] he spoke anointed by deity
[1:41:48] so demon said I'll go up for the
[1:41:50] denominational Brethren I'll go up or
[1:41:52] I'll be somebody
[1:41:58] brother Brown mentions about brother
[1:41:59] Baxter before he mentions this quote and
[1:42:01] he said by the Baxter Thomas said
[1:42:02] brother Brown
[1:42:04] you know what I'm gonna do first thing I
[1:42:05] get to heaven he said what Ern
[1:42:08] he said I'm going to walk right up to
[1:42:10] Demas and smack him right in the face
[1:42:14] he said now Aaron
[1:42:17] why are you going to that he said
[1:42:18] because I'm going to say why did you
[1:42:20] leave Paul down there
[1:42:22] why did you forsake Him
[1:42:31] for leaving that poor little guy in that
[1:42:33] shape
[1:42:34] he ought to man standing by him
[1:42:37] Paul was the one
[1:42:39] that led him
[1:42:41] to Christ
[1:42:46] Lord Jesus
[1:42:49] paragraph 91 now think of that how true
[1:42:52] servant that will stand true to the word
[1:42:53] sooner or later just remember
[1:42:56] the people
[1:42:58] are going to forsake Him
[1:43:02] and let me say not only is it preacher
[1:43:05] some of your deepest wounds and deepest
[1:43:08] hurts
[1:43:09] will be from Friends
[1:43:11] since I've dealt with Christians most of
[1:43:13] my entire life
[1:43:15] not deepest scars that I pack in my
[1:43:17] heart today
[1:43:19] are definitely inflicted by Christians
[1:43:21] many of them by preachers
[1:43:23] because I found some preachers to be
[1:43:25] Liars thieves
[1:43:27] adulterers pornography Watchers
[1:43:35] um
[1:43:37] that don't change the truth God still
[1:43:39] got some man of God that are true
[1:43:41] and faithful
[1:43:48] let me find a place to close here
[1:43:50] brother Ram said goes on to say
[1:43:54] oh my
[1:43:55] an identification the world loving
[1:43:57] demons forsaken him first Christian
[1:43:59] so-called
[1:44:01] Brethren of the popular opinion but Paul
[1:44:03] said on the word Demas left him loving
[1:44:05] this present World left him because he
[1:44:07] was true to the word it was too straight
[1:44:10] for him
[1:44:12] or he says who would you go with Demas
[1:44:16] I've often wondered how many people that
[1:44:19] left the message
[1:44:21] or left Paul
[1:44:24] because they got saved under Demas
[1:44:29] or they followed demas's influence what
[1:44:31] if Brother Davis is leaving there's got
[1:44:33] to be a reason there was
[1:44:35] he wasn't a seed of God
[1:44:41] oh my goodness
[1:44:42] God help me today
[1:44:46] Paul said all men
[1:44:50] have forsaken me
[1:44:52] notice brother Ram's words poor little
[1:44:55] God
[1:44:58] now watch he's going to tell this story
[1:44:59] about Dr Baxter
[1:45:02] and he's going to end it a little bit
[1:45:03] different than he did two years prior to
[1:45:05] this
[1:45:06] always as alarm that Dr Ern Baxter said
[1:45:08] you know when I get to heaven first
[1:45:09] thing I'm going to do I said what is it
[1:45:11] brother Ern he said I'm going to walk
[1:45:13] right up to demons and slap him in the
[1:45:14] face as hard as I can I said now earn
[1:45:17] and he said I'm going to say why did you
[1:45:19] leave Paul down there like that I said
[1:45:22] read it
[1:45:24] you really think
[1:45:32] God have mercy on the people that will
[1:45:35] walk away from Servants of God when they
[1:45:38] themselves are under such a strain and
[1:45:40] if they ever needed them and they turn
[1:45:43] and go then
[1:45:45] I'll tell you a friend it's going to be
[1:45:47] terrible one day
[1:45:49] it would be an Abomination a sin
[1:45:54] for me to turn my back on you in your
[1:45:56] time of need
[1:45:59] I find it amazing that people don't look
[1:46:01] at it the same way when their Pastor
[1:46:03] needs them
[1:46:05] or when their Prophet needed them and
[1:46:07] not one preacher not one saint
[1:46:11] showed up
[1:46:12] for Paul's sake why they were afraid
[1:46:18] what happened to all the great teachings
[1:46:20] of predestination
[1:46:21] the Ephesians Church on the deepest
[1:46:23] churches look at the book of Romans now
[1:46:25] what great things Paul was able to write
[1:46:27] to the Roman Christians and where was
[1:46:29] one of them
[1:46:34] Lord God
[1:46:38] notice brother Brennan says all right I
[1:46:40] said are you really think he'll be there
[1:46:41] Ern you better be careful your desire to
[1:46:44] slap him in the face
[1:46:46] I wouldn't want to be where he was at
[1:46:48] maybe
[1:46:50] can you imagine when he stands before
[1:46:52] God Demas
[1:46:56] and there stands Paul over looking at
[1:46:58] him and he looks at him and said why
[1:47:02] why
[1:47:04] did you leave
[1:47:09] he was in such a strain
[1:47:12] he was on the verge of a nervous
[1:47:14] breakdown
[1:47:16] and look at how you respected him
[1:47:21] I wonder what Bemis will think that
[1:47:26] Jose I tell you one thing Lord of God if
[1:47:29] it had been me look at yourself now
[1:47:32] and it'll tell you what you would have
[1:47:34] done
[1:47:35] in Paul's day
[1:47:38] so if it would have been Word of Life
[1:47:39] Church that Paul did wrote to
[1:47:41] and even like Tabernacle down in Minden
[1:47:45] and either of our churches were close to
[1:47:47] the Judiciary trial that Paul is going
[1:47:50] to have
[1:47:52] how many of our jumper shelters Runners
[1:47:54] screaming hollering preachers
[1:47:57] our deacons our trustees our laity how
[1:48:00] many of us from Word of Life
[1:48:03] would have showed up with Paul and said
[1:48:05] I'll stand with him
[1:48:09] now you know if you walk in there you
[1:48:11] may not walk out free
[1:48:14] so demon said no
[1:48:16] I'll lose my Ministry I can't do it I
[1:48:18] just can't do it ain't worth it
[1:48:21] there's something wrong with him anyway
[1:48:22] leaving trophemus back there carrying a
[1:48:26] doctor around with him all the time
[1:48:27] while the other day they ran them out of
[1:48:29] the city Alexander the copper Smith
[1:48:31] brought all that persecution against him
[1:48:33] did you hear what happened to Paul they
[1:48:35] had to let Paul down the wall in a
[1:48:37] basket during the midnight hours and he
[1:48:40] run like a chicken
[1:48:44] there's something wrong with him
[1:48:48] no they wouldn't
[1:48:50] he was just standing in the Taylor's
[1:48:52] parlor
[1:48:53] stretch out your arms Paul
[1:48:56] steady lord they're calling me names on
[1:48:58] Paul release your fist release your fear
[1:49:01] lord they're telling lies of me Lord
[1:49:03] they're really my influence in the
[1:49:05] Corinthians say Lord look what they're
[1:49:06] doing in the galatian church Paul that
[1:49:09] is my church not yours
[1:49:13] I didn't say on this rock I'll build
[1:49:15] your church but on this rock I will
[1:49:17] build my church
[1:49:19] and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail
[1:49:21] you imagine how hard it must have been
[1:49:23] with him standing there in the Taylor's
[1:49:25] office and they're running them down and
[1:49:27] this and that and the other stand still
[1:49:29] Paul
[1:49:30] when Paul tells Timothy to come and see
[1:49:33] him he says all men forsook me
[1:49:37] Timothy didn't even know until he
[1:49:39] receives this epistle it just happened a
[1:49:41] week or so prior to this
[1:49:43] you imagine when Timothy got it he said
[1:49:45] oh dear God
[1:49:48] where was the Saints
[1:49:51] where was
[1:49:55] the you mean there's no sisters the ones
[1:49:57] he prayed through to the Holy Ghost the
[1:49:59] ones that used to be harlots
[1:50:01] the ones that used to be drunks and
[1:50:03] Liars none of them
[1:50:12] let's bury it
[1:50:24] [Applause]
[1:50:28] Hallelujah
[1:50:33] oh Lord God
[1:50:39] father I'm sure
[1:50:41] a lot of these people here today is like
[1:50:43] me
[1:50:46] they don't like standing in that room
[1:50:47] and
[1:50:49] you tell them to hold out their arms
[1:50:52] just relax and say hell right relax
[1:50:54] holding them arms I know what this means
[1:50:56] I'm fixing to be measured
[1:50:59] oh Lord I pray
[1:51:02] help us Jesus
[1:51:07] lord it's not just
[1:51:09] when things are going good that we prove
[1:51:11] Who We Are
[1:51:12] it's when things are turning against us
[1:51:16] when we're sick and we're in despair
[1:51:21] as I say Lord I've never been where Paul
[1:51:23] was and I I'm sure that I won't be
[1:51:25] because I don't think that I
[1:51:27] I'm the type of man that could take it
[1:51:29] more than likely
[1:51:31] this was a man that was so unique
[1:51:35] or I can't wait to see him
[1:51:37] I can't wait to see the reward
[1:51:40] he'll have at that day
[1:51:43] your Prophet said about Paul
[1:51:46] his ministry was greater than all of the
[1:51:51] rest of the Apostles
[1:51:54] put together
[1:51:57] all of the rest of them
[1:51:59] put together
[1:52:01] I wonder why Peter didn't write about
[1:52:03] all this stuff
[1:52:04] because Peter didn't go through what
[1:52:06] Paul did
[1:52:08] Jameson go through what Paul did
[1:52:11] nobody else did
[1:52:15] Lord I pray you would help each of us
[1:52:19] maybe we're sitting here today and we're
[1:52:21] still trying to find out who we are and
[1:52:23] where we are and what we are in Christ
[1:52:27] maybe this is kind of frightening for us
[1:52:29] because we think oh no what if that's
[1:52:30] what if I don't wind up going there
[1:52:33] but each of us can have the Assurance
[1:52:35] today
[1:52:36] you'll never put us through more than
[1:52:38] what we're able to bear
[1:52:41] you'll help us and make a way
[1:52:44] I pray for every man woman boy and girl
[1:52:46] Lord that should
[1:52:48] help each of us that
[1:52:51] if it were to come down to life and
[1:52:53] death
[1:52:55] I remember several years ago being in
[1:52:57] China when brother Biscoe was arrested
[1:52:59] and they were looking for me
[1:53:03] and they called brother biscal back into
[1:53:04] interrogating me had my schedule of the
[1:53:07] Cities I was going to be preaching in
[1:53:08] and so on
[1:53:10] in his briefcase and he tore it up
[1:53:12] into little bitty tiny pieces
[1:53:15] and swallowed them
[1:53:17] so they wouldn't know where I was at
[1:53:20] and I'm not one bit embarrassed to say
[1:53:22] before this congregation today when I
[1:53:24] heard what had went on
[1:53:26] as a man
[1:53:28] I was afraid
[1:53:31] I was afraid from my brother
[1:53:33] I was afraid for those others who were
[1:53:35] arrested with him
[1:53:38] and I knew they'd come looking for me
[1:53:42] brother Murphy said brother Donnie we'll
[1:53:43] go if you want to go I said I'm not I
[1:53:45] ain't leaving I ain't running ain't no
[1:53:47] chicken
[1:53:48] they said well it's not so much being a
[1:53:50] chicken he said but I used to work for
[1:53:51] the police and I know how they think
[1:53:54] he said you can't just think about
[1:53:55] yourself
[1:53:56] if they arrest us in a place of the
[1:53:58] meeting they'll send you home
[1:54:01] but they'll throw these Believers in
[1:54:02] prison
[1:54:05] Lord when I was there and I saw a woman
[1:54:07] come into the hotel room where we had
[1:54:09] the meeting
[1:54:11] they rolled her in in a wheelchair
[1:54:14] and I'd rendered a suite A large size
[1:54:16] Suite so we could have two rooms to be
[1:54:18] able to hold the crowd
[1:54:22] and what I was preaching someone knocked
[1:54:24] on the door
[1:54:25] I thought oh my goodness
[1:54:27] here I go
[1:54:30] Lord I felt my face flush
[1:54:33] one of the brothers went to the door and
[1:54:35] it was just simply the maid just
[1:54:37] checking to see if we needed anything
[1:54:38] I'll never forget the look on that
[1:54:40] woman's face and she opened that door
[1:54:42] and saw them people
[1:54:45] but Lord that little woman that I saw
[1:54:48] push that wheelchair in
[1:54:50] or roll in that wheelchair
[1:54:52] at the end of that service after I
[1:54:55] preached and we prayed for the sick
[1:54:57] I saw that same woman roll that
[1:54:59] wheelchair out of that room
[1:55:02] because you raised her up out of that
[1:55:05] wheelchair
[1:55:08] so Lord May no under strain and
[1:55:10] difficulty you love to prove yourself
[1:55:15] oh Jesus help each one of us Lord
[1:55:19] oh we want to jump yes we want to shout
[1:55:21] we want to worship we want to praise God
[1:55:23] absolutely but we want something so deep
[1:55:27] in our souls
[1:55:28] and when it comes down if it took our
[1:55:31] very life
[1:55:33] we would say I'm willing to stand
[1:55:38] oh Lord help us
[1:55:41] I wonder what some of these people would
[1:55:43] do lord it's easy to see by what some
[1:55:45] have done
[1:55:47] which way they would have gone the way
[1:55:49] some of them have stood with me showed
[1:55:52] exactly how they would have stood with
[1:55:53] Paul
[1:55:54] better than Paul the same way
[1:55:57] the way they've stood
[1:55:59] with your seventh angel messenger proves
[1:56:01] they would have done Paul exactly the
[1:56:03] same way
[1:56:05] because it ain't me it ain't brother
[1:56:06] Branham it ain't no other preacher it's
[1:56:08] you in your body
[1:56:11] I want to stand with you Lord Jesus
[1:56:14] and when I say you I ain't meaning an
[1:56:18] image that's sitting on a throne in
[1:56:21] another dimension I'm talking about you
[1:56:23] in the form of your body
[1:56:28] all every preachers had him to say it
[1:56:30] I'll stand with you I'll stand with you
[1:56:32] brother I'm behind you I'm behind you
[1:56:34] yeah we've seen that and then when the
[1:56:37] hard times comes they're behind you all
[1:56:39] right about two miles out of sight
[1:56:42] where nobody can see him
[1:56:45] Lord God help us not to be cowards
[1:56:48] help us to stand for what's right
[1:56:52] Lord Jesus
[1:56:55] forgive those Lord
[1:56:57] I pray
[1:56:59] dear God that stood against your servant
[1:57:02] Paul
[1:57:03] forgive those O Lord of your children
[1:57:07] might have stood against your Elijah
[1:57:08] Prophet there's anything in them drawn
[1:57:11] back lord
[1:57:12] draw them back lord
[1:57:16] we love you today Jesus
[1:57:18] can we stand together
[1:57:30] so before long
[1:57:37] the tailor calls you back into the room
[1:57:45] try it on
[1:57:49] perfect fit
[1:57:53] slacks are the right things
[1:57:56] waste is exactly right
[1:57:59] vest fits perfectly
[1:58:01] the coat
[1:58:04] then the crowning of your life
[1:58:08] you'll stand there and you'll exchange
[1:58:10] and trade your old cross
[1:58:14] foreign
[1:58:17] I want to be near don't you when Paul
[1:58:19] stands there and he's given the martyr's
[1:58:21] crown and he's given a reward for all
[1:58:23] these things that he did for the cause
[1:58:26] of Christ let me tell you something we
[1:58:27] would not be where we are today if it
[1:58:29] had not been for a man called Paul the
[1:58:32] Apostle
[1:58:36] we would not bet where we are today had
[1:58:38] it not been for a man by the name of
[1:58:40] William Mary and Branham that was
[1:58:41] willing to suffer reproach could have
[1:58:42] been a multi-millionaire could have been
[1:58:45] a denominational speaker could have been
[1:58:46] whatever but he would not do it aren't
[1:58:50] you glad he would not do it
[1:58:53] now the question is
[1:58:55] will we do it
[1:58:58] or will we not
[1:59:00] I don't think there's a persecution
[1:59:01] coming against the bride let the first
[1:59:03] church aides know it's contrary to
[1:59:05] scripture what would be hated and
[1:59:06] despise yes I believe much greater than
[1:59:09] we have been
[1:59:10] will we be persecuted somewhat we've
[1:59:12] done been through that we know yes we
[1:59:14] can be they don't have to have laws all
[1:59:16] they have to have a society's pressure
[1:59:18] and it can pressure you a great deal
[1:59:21] yeah and let me tell you something after
[1:59:22] our pressure several years ago some of
[1:59:24] the message preachers went silent on
[1:59:26] certain things and won't preach it no
[1:59:28] more
[1:59:29] why I couldn't take the pressure
[1:59:32] but if they cut my tongue out of my
[1:59:35] mouth
[1:59:36] if they remove my fingers one by one God
[1:59:39] let me have the boldness and the courage
[1:59:42] to stand for this message if I have to
[1:59:45] give my life for it
[1:59:50] oh some of you would die for a book and
[1:59:52] a tape
[1:59:54] some of you have died maybe for a cross
[1:59:55] oh yes yes my Lord Jesus died on our
[1:59:57] cross what you have to be willing to die
[1:59:59] for is those who are bearing that cross
[2:00:01] and that image as well you see the
[2:00:04] Ephesian Believers did not stop being
[2:00:05] Christians I wonder how brother Nathan
[2:00:08] they must have felt horrible I wonder
[2:00:09] how they felt after they they denied
[2:00:12] this messenger a testimony someone
[2:00:15] brother Paul Pub and never got over
[2:00:17] their entire life no wonder Paul's
[2:00:19] prayed for them and said I pray God will
[2:00:22] not lay it to their charge
[2:00:28] oh my
[2:00:29] God that man wants to stand for Jesus
[2:00:32] and let the world go by

[2:08:03] never
[2:08:04] I'll never be able to compare with a lot
[2:08:06] of these brothers
[2:08:08] but Jesus if I have one soul
[2:08:10] that my name will be associated with
[2:08:12] others through eternity
[2:08:14] what a thing that will be
[2:08:16] Lord God we're not laboring so that we
[2:08:18] can get more we're laboring so we can
[2:08:20] get them in and get out of this place
[2:08:23] Lord we're not designing a reward anyway
[2:08:26] we just want to be there if I can be
[2:08:28] there with you and your children that'll
[2:08:30] be all the reward I would want
[2:08:32] but keep us true Lord Jesus
[2:08:35] no doubt some of us said here today and
[2:08:37] we thought oh Lord what would I do if I
[2:08:39] would have been an Ephesus what I would
[2:08:40] have went without some of this sisters
[2:08:42] thought that I've been brave enough
[2:08:44] somebody's Brothers thought but I've
[2:08:45] been brave enough to gone
[2:08:47] Lord God I pray that should help each of
[2:08:49] us
[2:08:50] Lord God that we can stand for your
[2:08:52] truth no matter what comes our way we
[2:08:55] love you Jesus forgive us of our
[2:08:57] failures our shortcomings make us strong
[2:09:00] help us to love one another father
[2:09:02] forgive our sins as we forgive those
[2:09:04] that trespass against us we ask today
[2:09:06] our God in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:09:10] and the Saints said amen God bless you
[2:09:13] Saints I searched all over and couldn't
[2:09:14] find nobody but sing this song together
[2:09:16] as we go God bless you come back Lord
[2:09:18] willing wins and I'm expecting the Lord
[2:09:20] to speak to us again Hemmings has been
[2:09:22] good to be in the house of the Lord
[2:09:23] praise the Lord amen thank God for his
[2:09:26] Mercy
[2:09:29] thank God for his Mercy look I know some
[2:09:31] of you've got families and friends and
[2:09:33] they've turned against the message and
[2:09:34] you think oh Lord there's no hope for
[2:09:35] him there's no mercy for them none of us
[2:09:37] know that I wouldn't want to be in some
[2:09:39] of the shoes of the people and saying
[2:09:40] the things that they've said but God
[2:09:42] Alone knows when a person has crossed
[2:09:44] that line between mercy and judgment
[2:09:46] pray for him pray that God will open
[2:09:48] their eyes and open their hearts to
[2:09:50] bring them back to the truth and
[2:09:52] remember whenever lot left Abraham you
[2:09:54] and I would have cut him off Abraham
[2:09:56] didn't Abraham risk his own life on the
[2:09:58] life of 318 servants to go down there
[2:10:00] and bring lot back did he make him a
[2:10:02] silver dollar sure never he went right
[2:10:04] back down there to Sodom and we know the
[2:10:06] end of him but God wouldn't even destroy
[2:10:08] it until he come down and talked to
[2:10:11] Abraham so your prayer might be the very
[2:10:14] one we our prayers ain't going to make
[2:10:15] them bride but our prayers might bring
[2:10:17] them to where they'll be saved and they
[2:10:19] won't wind up being lost
[2:10:21] wouldn't that be worth your prayer
[2:10:45] it's from it thinking maybe food
[2:10:48] poisoning Lord but I pray the spirit of
[2:10:51] God would move every symptom and I say
[2:10:54] to the devil you're a liar in the name
[2:10:58] of Jesus May It Go for my brother right
[2:11:01] now in Jesus name may he be made well
[2:11:05] praise be to God
[2:11:07] thank you Father amen
