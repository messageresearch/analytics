[39:25] we're so glad to be a part of this in
[39:28] time prophecy
[39:31] amen God bless you we greet you today in
[39:33] the name of the Lord Jesus what a
[39:35] privilege it is for us to be gathered
[39:37] together
[39:38] once again the house of God
[39:42] let's turn to the Book of Psalms if you
[39:43] would today Psalms 37 and 3.
[39:48] to wish all of our fathers are happy
[39:50] Father's Day may God bless you
[39:54] appreciate our fathers if you weren't
[39:56] for our fathers we wouldn't be here
[39:58] would we
[40:00] I know we're living in that age probably
[40:01] a couple years goes on this holiday will
[40:05] probably outlawed won't it
[40:07] Father's Day Mother's Day I guess it'll
[40:10] be its day
[40:12] I'm not sure exactly how they're going
[40:14] to take care of all that but since we
[40:17] still believe the Bible we still have
[40:19] the proper pronouns
[40:22] him his hers all right
[40:27] it's so glad that I'm just so glad today
[40:29] to still be in my right mind
[40:32] we're living in a world that's totally
[40:34] insane
[40:36] totally insane
[40:39] Psalms 37 3.
[40:43] trust in the Lord and do good
[40:46] so shalt thou dwell in the land and
[40:48] verily Thou shalt be fed
[40:53] Delight thyself also in the Lord
[40:56] and he shall give Thee the desires
[41:00] of thine heart we believe this is true
[41:03] it will give the desires of thine heart
[41:06] Romans chapter 8 verse 16.
[41:13] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[41:16] our spirit
[41:18] that we are the children of God
[41:23] let me just share this with you I was
[41:24] reading it to Carol last night it's a
[41:26] studying for today
[41:28] in the talmud which is part of the on
[41:31] the ancient Hebrew books whenever a boy
[41:34] or a girl had reached the age that they
[41:37] were weaned
[41:38] they would time that about the same time
[41:41] frame that they could be able to talk
[41:44] so they would begin to recognize who
[41:47] their father was who their mother was
[41:50] so they called father Abba and mother
[41:54] EMA
[41:55] so Abba and Iman
[41:59] so can you imagine when the Lord Jesus
[42:01] began to teach his disciples how to pray
[42:05] and whenever he told them now this is
[42:07] what you're supposed to say our we say
[42:10] English father but acts in the Hebrew it
[42:13] would have been Abba our Abba
[42:17] which art in heaven
[42:19] now to a Jew hearing this it would have
[42:22] been blasphemy
[42:25] to call God
[42:28] your daddy
[42:30] which is what Abba means daddy EMA means
[42:33] Mommy
[42:36] so to call God your daddy
[42:39] the apostles themselves must have been
[42:42] overwhelmed when they heard Jesus pray
[42:45] this way
[42:46] I'm so glad we can pray that way
[42:50] so the spirit Bears witness with our
[42:52] spirit that we are the children of God
[42:54] now if we are children
[42:57] then this is what we get
[42:59] and if children
[43:01] then heirs
[43:03] Heirs of God
[43:06] joint heirs with Christ
[43:10] if so be
[43:12] that would Shout with him oh
[43:17] we heal the sick we raise the dead we
[43:19] jump we run we scream we holler no
[43:22] we believe in that too
[43:24] but if so be that we suffer
[43:27] with him
[43:29] we may be also glorified
[43:33] together
[43:35] wow second Corinthians chapter 6 verse
[43:38] 10.
[43:40] listen to contrast that Paul himself
[43:43] faced as a Believer as a Christian as a
[43:47] messenger
[43:48] as sorrowful yet always rejoicing
[43:53] as poor
[43:55] yet making many rich
[43:59] as having nothing
[44:02] and yet
[44:04] possessing
[44:06] all things
[44:10] I'm glad I can see that same world today
[44:13] aren't you
[44:14] I may like to be remembered as we pray
[44:16] today
[44:17] just hold your request in your heart
[44:22] Abba
[44:24] Daddy
[44:26] Papa
[44:28] we counted such a privilege
[44:31] that we can call you our father today
[44:35] we love you so much
[44:38] we're so grateful that you love us
[44:41] as we
[44:43] hear
[44:45] in our Earth today set this day aside
[44:47] for Father's Day
[44:50] and I know just because a man
[44:52] biologically can father a child
[44:54] certainly doesn't mean he's much of a
[44:55] father
[44:57] many fathers would disown their children
[45:00] and have
[45:02] but you will never disown one of yours
[45:06] Lord Jesus we so love you today and
[45:08] we're grateful for what you've done for
[45:10] us we thank you for becoming one of us
[45:13] that you could make us like you
[45:16] as we Endeavor to look into your word
[45:18] today I pray that you would help us you
[45:21] see our needs there are many but our God
[45:23] is so much greater than all of our needs
[45:26] we pray Lord that you would heal the
[45:29] sick that you would encourage those that
[45:31] are weary those father that maybe don't
[45:33] know you
[45:34] in the building today if there would be
[45:36] one may they find you
[45:38] those that don't have the Holy Ghost
[45:40] those that just need a refilling
[45:42] whatever their needs are
[45:44] would you be mindful of us today Father
[45:47] help me that I can get out of the way
[45:49] to be able to speak the words of life
[45:52] to your people
[45:54] Grant it Lord and when it's all said and
[45:56] done we'll give you all the praise and
[45:59] the glory today in the name of the Lord
[46:01] Jesus
[46:03] and the Saints said amen God bless you
[46:06] you may be seated
[46:12] I've been speaking to you about
[46:15] the bride's Bill of Rights I hope you've
[46:18] been enjoying it blessed by it
[46:23] as I've looked at this I've studied this
[46:26] before
[46:27] but I've got to say there's a lot that
[46:30] I've found out about it that apparently
[46:33] I'd overlooked before where it was in
[46:35] time or the season for it for me
[46:38] but as I begin to study I've realized
[46:41] how many things that God had his Prophet
[46:44] to say that was our rights and what is
[46:48] children of God that we are heirs to
[46:52] and I've found it so amazing as I begin
[46:54] to look at it and kind of look
[46:56] historically back a little bit and see
[46:59] what Paul said to the Believers in his
[47:01] age and then when you study somewhat and
[47:04] what irania said and the different
[47:06] Church age Messengers as Luther said to
[47:09] his group what Wesley said to his and
[47:12] then you see how much more that the Lord
[47:15] had our Messenger to say to us than was
[47:18] ever said to any other group of
[47:20] Believers in any church age
[47:23] and then you think about that why would
[47:25] God so increase the quantity of what was
[47:30] said and the quality of what was said
[47:33] and as I was thinking about it early
[47:35] this morning as I was a week before
[47:37] daylight and just pondering about it and
[47:40] it just was made so real to me that God
[47:44] knew exactly that living in this age of
[47:48] such terrible darkness and sadness and
[47:52] sickness and disease and trouble and
[47:55] turmoil that our world is in that we
[47:59] would actually need more said to us and
[48:03] about us than any other age that has
[48:06] ever been
[48:08] when you think of how God in his Mercy
[48:10] would cover us with his protective wings
[48:14] of his mercy and give us promises that
[48:18] has never been said to any other
[48:20] Generation Now Paul was very eloquent of
[48:23] course and the words that he used and
[48:25] very blessed of God to be able to speak
[48:28] many languages and to be able to bring
[48:30] it in such a wonderful way other men of
[48:33] God down through the age but yet when
[48:36] you look in comparison to all that we
[48:38] have they had so very little and yet
[48:42] they would go to church say today and by
[48:45] next week they would have lost their
[48:48] head they would have went to church
[48:49] today them maybe their wives their
[48:52] children would absolutely be thrown into
[48:55] the lines and they would have been eaten
[48:58] they would have been totally annihilated
[49:00] but the volume and the amount of word
[49:03] that God gave them was so much less than
[49:06] us and you look at that and you think
[49:09] God and His abundant love and mercy has
[49:13] given to us so much because he knew we
[49:17] was going to need it I don't mind
[49:19] telling you I need it more than I've
[49:21] ever needed it in my life anybody here
[49:23] with me because we realize we're living
[49:27] in such a time of darkness and Trauma
[49:32] and everywhere we look we look at our
[49:34] nation we look at our world and we see
[49:37] the things that our government is doing
[49:40] our leaders are doing I read just
[49:43] yesterday where that a pastor in Germany
[49:47] had stood up in his church and said that
[49:50] God was a queer
[49:55] he said it's time that we become
[49:58] inclusive and we start letting people
[50:02] know you don't have to change from what
[50:05] you are that God loves you as you are
[50:09] well if he loves you as you are and
[50:10] accepts you as you are the cross was in
[50:13] vain
[50:15] oh sure he loves you but he wants to
[50:17] change you from what you are to what he
[50:20] wants you to be
[50:21] I know that's not very popular but it's
[50:24] the truce anyhow and we know that it's
[50:27] becoming greater and greater and the
[50:29] Darkness and we can see that the powers
[50:31] of hell are aiming at our children like
[50:35] never before is that right and whenever
[50:39] we look about and we see that our nation
[50:41] and the world is gone it reminds me so
[50:45] much as I've studied some historically
[50:47] about the empires that live thousands of
[50:51] years ago and when you look at the
[50:54] Babylonian Empire and the Assyrian
[50:57] Empire and the Roman Empires it changed
[51:01] from a republic to become an Empire and
[51:05] you see that much of what America is
[51:08] falling in line with is not the great
[51:11] great things that God set forth as a
[51:14] nation but they're following in the
[51:16] track of the Babylonian Empire the
[51:19] Assyrian Empire the exact same state of
[51:24] Rome now when Rome started out it was a
[51:27] mighty thing just a city that become a
[51:31] republic and then of course it grew into
[51:33] an Empire but you look and see what
[51:36] eroded Rome and you study it and you can
[51:39] see some of the same things are eroding
[51:42] our great nation oh I know the pundits
[51:45] still called it the greatest nation in
[51:48] the world and truly at one time it was
[51:51] but she fastly so fastly is losing day
[51:56] by day her identification as a
[52:00] superpower we can see it that China is
[52:04] stepping up and taking over what we were
[52:06] Iran is stepping up and taking over what
[52:10] we were don't you understand why Russia
[52:13] is going to be empowered by a weak
[52:17] leadership in our nation and they will
[52:20] feel that they will be able to take us
[52:23] on and defeat us but I'm so glad when
[52:26] the bombs go to fine I would have
[52:29] already flew the coop
[52:31] I'm so glad I don't care what they do to
[52:35] the world what they do how many names
[52:37] that they write our nation's name on it
[52:40] ain't going to hinder me at all because
[52:42] I'm not going to be here by the grace of
[52:45] God and God knew that before the time of
[52:48] the Rapture would actually come that we
[52:51] would face so much stuff and we know
[52:53] that we've gone already over into the
[52:56] grace period of the links of our church
[52:58] age and the prophet could only see as
[53:01] far as he could see by Vision was around
[53:04] 1977 which is why he made the prediction
[53:08] that the end would come because he could
[53:11] only see to 77 as far as he would be
[53:14] able to be allowed to peer into the
[53:17] timeline and then it would become so
[53:20] dark that he couldn't even see beyond
[53:22] that and that he would say I do not
[53:24] prophesy but I predict that it will come
[53:27] by
[53:28] 1977. so we see that we've been lived
[53:31] even these years beyond that to where it
[53:35] was total darkness how many knows that's
[53:37] where we are and an hour of such
[53:40] darkness that is on the earth now even
[53:42] though our lives are not participating
[53:45] in that Darkness we're not drinking
[53:48] we're not running around and doing what
[53:49] the world does but because it is such a
[53:53] predominant Factor we deal with it every
[53:56] day of our lives and we need such
[53:59] encouragement from the word and such
[54:02] encouragement from one another as a body
[54:05] do we not
[54:06] so God knew and this is why that he
[54:10] would have his word written down so that
[54:12] it would not cease to exist out to the
[54:15] first generation and then what did God
[54:17] do in this day he allowed his prophet's
[54:20] voice to be able to be recorded oh how I
[54:24] thank God for that we are the only
[54:26] church aides that ever lived that I to
[54:29] their Prophet had been gone off the
[54:31] scene for decades that the followers of
[54:34] that message would be able to still hear
[54:36] their prophet's voice you are a blessed
[54:40] people so we can be able to go back and
[54:42] hear the Rapture the way it was preached
[54:45] in 1965. now God did that for a reason
[54:49] and I'll tell you the reason God did not
[54:51] do it was so that it would replace
[54:54] church God never done it for the reason
[54:56] that people would stay home and say they
[54:59] don't need to go to the house of God
[55:02] that's right but God did it for us so we
[55:05] would be able to hear his voice it's one
[55:08] thing to read a book but it's another
[55:10] thing to be able to hear the voice of
[55:12] that man and the pronunciation and the
[55:14] emphasis and so on that he would put on
[55:17] the statements that he would make and he
[55:19] would say terms about us and things
[55:22] about us that no other messenger said
[55:25] about his people it would even unfold to
[55:28] the year of 1965 and God would allow
[55:31] brother random to start using the words
[55:33] about a predestinated sea and a seed in
[55:37] your soul which he had never used from
[55:40] 56 on up to 64. never used it from 47
[55:44] faith is the substance the verse first
[55:47] service that we have recorded all of
[55:49] that span of time he never used certain
[55:52] words that he was allowed to use the
[55:55] last few months of his life in 1965. and
[56:00] the culmination of the bride's identity
[56:02] he was building greater and greater and
[56:05] it wasn't just for those people that
[56:07] were there but it was for us those of us
[56:10] that have come in the footsteps of those
[56:13] that have laid down the past and I'll
[56:15] tell you for one I appreciate our
[56:18] predecessors and the founding fathers
[56:20] that have taken this message on where
[56:22] would we be today were it not for those
[56:25] I told one of the brothers the other day
[56:27] as brother Jerry Phillips I was talking
[56:29] about his father and his family and some
[56:31] of those that was part of the founding
[56:33] of this church right here over on Rome
[56:36] Hill where would we be today because I
[56:39] never started this church I inherited
[56:41] something that was started by others and
[56:43] if time goes on it will be the same
[56:46] thing we will hand it on to another
[56:47] generation so what do we want to hand
[56:50] them we want to hand them something that
[56:53] is word based Spirit fed spirit filled
[56:57] that still believes the doctrine just
[57:00] like the apostles did in the book of the
[57:02] relax is that right we don't want to
[57:05] hand our children some cold dead form
[57:08] that all they do is go to church and get
[57:11] our religion done and then we go I have
[57:13] a little cake and a little coffee
[57:15] together but we want our children to
[57:17] know there is a living Resurrection Lord
[57:21] Jesus he is the same yesterday today and
[57:25] forever if it goes on another 50 years
[57:28] we want them to be able to hand to their
[57:31] children and their children that there
[57:33] is a living God that we're not serving
[57:37] some dead cold form but we are serving a
[57:41] resurrected Lord Jesus
[57:43] [Applause]
[57:45] in that God knew that the bride would
[57:48] need such encouragement how grateful I
[57:51] am for our founding fathers that in the
[57:54] 1700s would be able to make the
[57:57] amendments to the Constitution and
[57:59] address what they call a Bill of Rights
[58:02] which would give us freedom of speech
[58:04] freedom of religion freedom to be able
[58:07] to express a difference and our leaders
[58:10] would not be able to be as it was with
[58:13] the Kings by which they had left England
[58:15] and come here and establish what we know
[58:19] commonly today as our Bill of Rights
[58:21] it's had many amendments of course since
[58:23] it was founded and no doubt it will
[58:25] continue to go on and I look at the
[58:28] message of the hour not as a replacement
[58:30] of the Bible any more than I look at the
[58:34] Bill of Rights as being a replacement of
[58:37] the Constitution now listen to me
[58:39] carefully so you'll understand the
[58:41] Constitution was set up first originally
[58:44] signed by the founding fathers but then
[58:46] they saw a little lack there that they
[58:50] needed to add what they call the Bill of
[58:52] Rights so in there the Constitution
[58:55] would Define great things by which the
[58:57] nation would be founded but individual
[59:00] identity they did not deal with it so
[59:03] much in the Constitution and after
[59:06] looking at it they felt like they needed
[59:08] to add some amendments and therefore
[59:11] they wrote this and called it the Bill
[59:13] of Rights I don't know about you I'm
[59:14] glad they did we understand now in the
[59:17] direction that a lot of our government
[59:18] is going right now that they're trying
[59:21] to take your weapons from you and
[59:23] eventually they will shut you down
[59:25] they've already got the ability to do it
[59:27] maybe not by law but by pressure and
[59:30] this is why a lot of our corporations
[59:32] are going woke in the day that we live
[59:35] in because they've got to please not the
[59:38] majority but the minority but the reason
[59:41] as I said on Wednesday night that we are
[59:43] not joining the won't move it's because
[59:46] we have already woke up but we not
[59:50] waking up to the transgender we woke up
[59:53] to the Lord Jesus and his power so we're
[59:56] not part of that move and we're not
[59:58] interested in what they are doing but we
[1:00:01] are interested in our rights how many
[1:00:03] knows that you must know your rights as
[1:00:06] an American citizen so if they show up
[1:00:08] here today and say we've come to arrest
[1:00:10] you especially that loud mouth preacher
[1:00:12] you got in there and you all cannot have
[1:00:15] church Wednesday night well we know what
[1:00:17] we're going to do we're going to get us
[1:00:19] one of the best lawyers that we can
[1:00:20] afford and he's going to stand right
[1:00:22] there and say you have no right to shut
[1:00:24] them up but he blasted the transgender
[1:00:27] we've got him saying that yeah and so
[1:00:29] far it's my rights to do so and I'm
[1:00:32] going to continue to do so and if they
[1:00:35] make it illegal I'll still do it anyway
[1:00:37] well brother Donnie will be sold in jail
[1:00:40] won't be the first time I've been in
[1:00:41] prison at least this time I was on that
[1:00:44] side of the bars next time I might be on
[1:00:46] the other side but I'll still be
[1:00:48] preaching this same gospel because he is
[1:00:51] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:00:55] so God wants his people to be able to
[1:00:59] understand their rights so they can be
[1:01:01] able to stand up and claim what they are
[1:01:03] I love the way Paul says this in Romans
[1:01:05] 8 16 for the spirit itself Bears witness
[1:01:08] with our spirit that we are the children
[1:01:11] of God and if children now notice the
[1:01:15] littlest two-letter word if children if
[1:01:18] children then heirs so another right
[1:01:22] that we as the bride have is the right
[1:01:25] to be an heir now most of us are not
[1:01:29] rich people we're not wealthy people and
[1:01:31] if we would get a little thing when my
[1:01:33] mom and daddy died they didn't have
[1:01:35] already anything we sold their place and
[1:01:37] they each one of us wound up of the
[1:01:39] couple thousand dollars a piece
[1:01:40] something like that and that was pretty
[1:01:42] much it it wasn't that much I got a
[1:01:45] little bit more because Mom and Daddy
[1:01:46] have bought our place in Kentucky and
[1:01:48] had never paid us for it because that's
[1:01:50] poor and they couldn't afford to do it
[1:01:51] so they put it in their will that I was
[1:01:54] supposed to be paid for them now I
[1:01:56] didn't get no more because I was the
[1:01:58] firstborn I just got my portion like
[1:02:00] Harry and like the rest of my sisters
[1:02:03] and my other brother but I was not you
[1:02:06] know even though it wasn't that much
[1:02:08] neither was into the rest of my siblings
[1:02:10] going to say well I really don't want
[1:02:12] mine we all know how people are when it
[1:02:15] comes to money now people will fall out
[1:02:18] with one another when it comes to money
[1:02:21] and material Goods oh I realized I broke
[1:02:24] the amen channel right there
[1:02:26] so people will will fight they will
[1:02:30] separate with friends with family when
[1:02:32] it comes to money and that that's mine
[1:02:35] that's mine I've got to write to that
[1:02:37] and yet when it comes to our spiritual
[1:02:39] rights it's a real shame to me that we
[1:02:42] let the devil kick us around like a tin
[1:02:44] can down the road we let him stomp us we
[1:02:48] let him talk us out of our blessing and
[1:02:50] if it was a thousand dollars you'd stand
[1:02:52] there saying this is my thousand daddy
[1:02:55] wanted me to heaven and you ain't
[1:02:56] getting it Bubby I love you sister but
[1:02:59] that's my thousand how much more are you
[1:03:02] to stand for your rights in Jesus Christ
[1:03:04] not just for a hundred dollars or five
[1:03:07] hundred dollars but to be able to stand
[1:03:09] for what the Lord God has made for you
[1:03:12] he paid the ultimate price
[1:03:16] so if children then air so if we are
[1:03:20] heirs we will be treated as Sons and
[1:03:23] Daughters of God and Heir is one who is
[1:03:27] able to become a part of understatement
[1:03:30] now I want you to notice now the way
[1:03:31] that Paul mentions this and if children
[1:03:34] then heirs notice what your heir of
[1:03:38] heirs
[1:03:39] of God
[1:03:43] so what you get
[1:03:47] is God
[1:03:50] notice he doesn't say Heirs of His
[1:03:54] blessings
[1:03:55] Heirs of his peace Heirs of his healing
[1:04:01] to the bride
[1:04:03] she gets God
[1:04:07] Heirs of God so what did you inherit
[1:04:11] from your mother your father your
[1:04:13] grandpa your uncle well I'm Heirs of his
[1:04:15] estate well he had him a call attractor
[1:04:18] he had an old mule named Bob and he had
[1:04:20] a lamb named Susie and he had you know
[1:04:22] this and that and the other well you
[1:04:24] become Heirs of what he had well God
[1:04:27] give us what heirs we are Heirs of God
[1:04:32] so I inherited God wow
[1:04:37] hello I inherited God you inherited God
[1:04:44] deity
[1:04:46] predestinated seed
[1:04:49] eternal life now can't you see the
[1:04:51] difference between the bride and the
[1:04:53] church that the bride and herods God but
[1:04:57] what does the church get salvation from
[1:05:01] God what does the church get oh they get
[1:05:04] healing they did a lot of blessings
[1:05:05] y'all that's all well and good and they
[1:05:07] say thank the Lord the Lord blesses my
[1:05:09] business and the Lord does this for me
[1:05:10] and that's for me that's all well and
[1:05:12] good but the bride gets God Not His
[1:05:16] blessings I don't just want his gifts I
[1:05:20] want him
[1:05:21] and if I get him I get gifts too
[1:05:25] now notice so then we are Heirs of God
[1:05:31] so God himself is his greatest gift the
[1:05:36] loftiest blessing that we could ever
[1:05:39] inherit is to be able to inherit God so
[1:05:43] we receive as our portion God so my
[1:05:47] portion your portion as Believers is not
[1:05:50] well praise the Lord I got saved and
[1:05:52] I've got the gift of healing and I've
[1:05:54] got the gift of faith and and I got set
[1:05:57] free from smoking oh that's wonderful to
[1:05:59] testify there thank God for that but
[1:06:01] what is your inheritance what is your
[1:06:05] portion well I got salvation well that's
[1:06:08] good but what what about the Savior did
[1:06:11] you get him well I got salvation and I I
[1:06:14] got this and I got that notice what a
[1:06:16] lot of people thank God for I thank God
[1:06:19] for healing me that's good we ought to
[1:06:20] thank it for that and then many of them
[1:06:22] will get healed and they go right back
[1:06:24] to living a sinful lot you know why that
[1:06:27] God is blessing and apparently didn't
[1:06:29] get healed but the bride gets him which
[1:06:33] means she gets everything inclusive with
[1:06:36] him so our father is our portion now a
[1:06:42] human father can disinherit his son or
[1:06:45] his daughter so the son would do
[1:06:47] something to make Daddy mad and daddy
[1:06:49] makes a different will and then he goes
[1:06:52] right ahead and he leaves Paul out of
[1:06:55] the will or Donnie or whoevermore and he
[1:06:57] says why do you made me mad I'm taken
[1:06:59] away from him I was going to give him
[1:07:02] this and I was going to give him Bob The
[1:07:04] Mule I ain't giving him nothing now I
[1:07:06] was going to give him this that I ain't
[1:07:08] giving him us and I disinherit him I'm
[1:07:11] giving all the Donnie's portion to Harry
[1:07:13] but almighty God cannot by his own
[1:07:16] sovereignty ever Oh Glory ever gets on
[1:07:21] one of his own attributes
[1:07:25] totally impossible now notice he says
[1:07:29] sinner for your children we are Heirs of
[1:07:32] God and Joint heirs notice how he says
[1:07:35] this joint heirs with joint heirs with
[1:07:40] Christ
[1:07:42] so what did Christ get God so I want you
[1:07:47] to notice this must have been
[1:07:48] overwhelming to the people of that day
[1:07:51] when they heard this and them knowing
[1:07:53] the laws of adoption of course and the
[1:07:56] way that they was able to receive an
[1:07:58] inheritance that Paul would say that we
[1:08:01] aired God and then we are joint heirs
[1:08:05] with Christ and he put Christ on a basis
[1:08:09] of Brotherhood with the rest of the
[1:08:12] family of God
[1:08:17] oh
[1:08:20] so you mean
[1:08:22] us and Jesus
[1:08:25] get the same portion
[1:08:29] we are join heirs joint heirs
[1:08:34] equivalent basis joint heirs with Christ
[1:08:40] and somebody said
[1:08:42] it shall be that would suffer with him
[1:08:45] that we may be also glorified together
[1:08:47] so partaking of the same eternal glory I
[1:08:52] want you to notice this those of you
[1:08:54] that are familiar with the Bible you
[1:08:55] know this in second Chronicles chapter
[1:08:57] 21 verse 3 when he's speaking about
[1:09:01] Jehoshaphat and their father gave them
[1:09:04] great gifts of silver so Jehoshaphat now
[1:09:08] has many sons and what Jehoshaphat does
[1:09:12] he divides his kingdom and his riches
[1:09:16] and his treasure among his household or
[1:09:20] his family so to one son he gave him the
[1:09:25] entire Kingdom to the rest of the sons
[1:09:28] listen what they get and their father
[1:09:31] gave them great gifts of silver and of
[1:09:34] gold and the precious things and fenced
[1:09:38] cities in Judah but the kingdom gave he
[1:09:43] to johoram because
[1:09:47] he
[1:09:48] was the firstborn
[1:09:52] you mean so all of them had the same
[1:09:55] Daddy
[1:09:57] so Jehoshaphat is the father of all of
[1:10:00] these boys but johoram got the entire
[1:10:04] Kingdom
[1:10:05] and what these other guys got was a
[1:10:08] little bit of silver and a little bit
[1:10:10] ago and a little town over here a fenced
[1:10:13] City a fenced walled up denominational
[1:10:18] City
[1:10:22] I'm glad that's not my inheritance
[1:10:24] now some of y'all been there you know
[1:10:26] what I'm talking about well man those
[1:10:28] people be safe they will be saved but
[1:10:30] I'm glad I didn't get a fan City I got a
[1:10:33] free country
[1:10:34] a free message of the hour so notice
[1:10:38] what the Bible says then but the kingdom
[1:10:41] the kingdom gave heed to johoram because
[1:10:45] he was the firstborn so the Lord Jesus
[1:10:50] was the firstborn of God what do you
[1:10:54] mean brother Donnie well he was the
[1:10:57] beginning of all things in him was life
[1:11:00] and the life was a light of men and all
[1:11:03] things were made by him and was not
[1:11:05] anything made that was not made by him
[1:11:08] so he was the very existence of the
[1:11:13] Eternal coming into an expression of
[1:11:16] time you follow me so far so God wanted
[1:11:19] to make himself tangible so God gave
[1:11:23] birth to a son not a little boy not an
[1:11:27] inferior God but the word so in the
[1:11:30] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:11:33] with God in the word was God and the
[1:11:36] same is in the beginning was God all
[1:11:38] things were created by Him is that right
[1:11:41] so God gave birth to his word so how did
[1:11:45] that come about he spoke
[1:11:47] and when God spoke that was giving birth
[1:11:51] to the firstborn of the new creation of
[1:11:55] God so God gave birth to a son now keep
[1:11:59] in mind God was not an old man and then
[1:12:02] God somehow created a young man God was
[1:12:04] the invisible as Paul said now unto the
[1:12:08] Eternal invisible Immortal only wise God
[1:12:11] be Dominion power and Glory forever so
[1:12:15] God gave birth to a son I ain't making
[1:12:18] this up as question answer 1953 if you'd
[1:12:21] like to check it out so God gave birth
[1:12:23] to a son which was the expression of his
[1:12:27] word that sign would have been the heir
[1:12:30] of all things but that son that Humanity
[1:12:34] of God later came to the Earth and he
[1:12:37] said I want to share everything I have
[1:12:43] was my brothers
[1:12:48] I was made the executor of my mother and
[1:12:50] father's will
[1:12:52] by the law of the state of Kentucky
[1:12:56] I could have taken a larger portion
[1:13:01] that's the law
[1:13:04] but I love my brothers and sisters and I
[1:13:06] didn't want that portion to separate us
[1:13:07] for the rest of our life
[1:13:09] I didn't figure I deserved it no way but
[1:13:12] by law I could have done so so the
[1:13:16] firstborn the right to the firstborn the
[1:13:19] Lord Jesus could have kept all the
[1:13:21] healing all the mercy all the deity all
[1:13:26] the power all our Glory all the glory
[1:13:30] but instead of him wanting to keep it
[1:13:32] for himself he said I want my brothers
[1:13:36] I want my sisters to share with my glory
[1:13:40] I want them to Bow the weight of
[1:13:44] eternal glory so he said that he anoints
[1:13:47] Paul you imagine Paul must have been so
[1:13:49] overwhelmed with him even when the
[1:13:51] spirit of God struck him and he wrote
[1:13:53] this down and remember Paul had no other
[1:13:56] scriptures to reference this Swiss to
[1:13:59] check and make sure that what he was
[1:14:01] saying lined up with the Bible
[1:14:04] nobody else said this but Paul
[1:14:09] well I'm sorry you didn't know that
[1:14:10] nobody else said this you see I believe
[1:14:13] that a prophet of God not only
[1:14:16] interprets the written word but a
[1:14:19] prophet of God is called to be able to
[1:14:21] write down that which is not even yet
[1:14:24] written
[1:14:25] if you don't believe that you don't
[1:14:27] believe your Bible because Paul wrote
[1:14:30] things in the New Testament that neither
[1:14:32] Peter James John no none of the rest of
[1:14:36] them wrote nor did they write in the Old
[1:14:38] Testament and verify well come on Saints
[1:14:40] it's the truth
[1:14:42] so God wanted himself to be able to
[1:14:45] share this Glory with us now notice in
[1:14:48] Galatians 3 29 if ye be Christ which is
[1:14:52] not plural but possessive then we ye are
[1:14:55] Abraham's seed and heirs according to
[1:14:59] the promise again Titus 3 7 that being
[1:15:02] justified by his grace we should be made
[1:15:06] heirs according to the hope of eternal
[1:15:10] life Hebrews 1 14 are not all they
[1:15:13] ministering Spirits talking about angels
[1:15:15] now listen this who are sin Force to
[1:15:19] minister to them who shall be Heirs of
[1:15:22] Salvation so the angels of God are sent
[1:15:26] to minister to you to be Heirs of
[1:15:30] Salvation
[1:15:31] eternal life and the blessings of God
[1:15:34] James 2 5 how can my beloved Brethren
[1:15:37] hath not God chosen the poor of this
[1:15:39] world rich in faith and Heirs of the
[1:15:42] kingdom which he has promised to them
[1:15:45] that love in First Peter 3 7 the advice
[1:15:48] to married people likewise your husbands
[1:15:50] dwell with him speaking of the wives
[1:15:52] according to knowledge give honor unto
[1:15:55] the wife as into the weaker vessel as
[1:15:59] being heirs together of the grace of
[1:16:02] life
[1:16:03] heirs together of the grace what a
[1:16:07] beautiful passage of the grace of life
[1:16:11] that your prayers be not hindered so God
[1:16:16] don't want us to be able to just walk
[1:16:18] around down on the earth and while I'm
[1:16:20] saved and I don't guess I'll get nothing
[1:16:22] else till I get there he actually wants
[1:16:25] us to enjoy his kingdom while we're
[1:16:28] going that way
[1:16:30] now listen as brother random says it
[1:16:32] this way you know if I bought a home and
[1:16:34] it was mine and I go through the thing
[1:16:36] and see what I had I'm just kind of a
[1:16:39] prospector I like to dig around and find
[1:16:42] out what a God I'm an heir of Salvation
[1:16:45] I'm an heir to Divine Healing I'm an
[1:16:49] heir of heaven I'm an heir to the Earth
[1:16:52] I'm an heir a joint Heir with Christ in
[1:16:56] all things that I like to look through
[1:16:59] his book to Prospect and see what all
[1:17:03] I'm an heir to
[1:17:05] so that's what you need to do when you
[1:17:07] read your Bible is you're looking
[1:17:09] through your Bible it is your personal
[1:17:12] gold mine so you want to read through
[1:17:14] there and find out what belongs to you
[1:17:17] as a Believer well brother Donnie will
[1:17:19] it fall right out of heaven right in my
[1:17:22] lap no you'll have to fight for every
[1:17:24] inch of the ground you get
[1:17:27] notice again in Abraham said your heir
[1:17:30] to it air of Salvation air Divine
[1:17:33] Healing air of every Redemptive blessing
[1:17:36] that Jesus died for you are the heir to
[1:17:39] it for you are Abraham's see and you're
[1:17:42] an heir of the whole thing oh my
[1:17:45] goodness the world better enjoy this
[1:17:46] Earth while they got it because we're
[1:17:48] fixing to take it over
[1:17:50] again in Jehovah Jireh I am an heir to
[1:17:53] all things through Christ I'm an heir to
[1:17:57] my healing I'm an heir to my joy I'm an
[1:18:01] heir of Salvation purchased of God born
[1:18:04] of the spirit washed in the blood yes
[1:18:07] sir I'm an heir I'm a child of the king
[1:18:10] I'm a Son of God everything that God
[1:18:14] promised is mine I'm a joint Heir with
[1:18:17] the Lord Jesus amen
[1:18:20] [Applause]
[1:18:25] now I'm gonna see how many of you'll say
[1:18:27] Amen to this
[1:18:29] possessing all things in 1962. did you
[1:18:33] notice here in second Corinthians Paul
[1:18:34] said even of death
[1:18:36] we
[1:18:38] possessed
[1:18:40] death
[1:18:46] s don't possess you
[1:18:48] you possess it it is not your master
[1:18:54] he said death come to get him when he
[1:18:56] was setting up on that and he shot
[1:18:59] that rifle and it exploded he said but
[1:19:03] Jesus sent him back empty-handed
[1:19:07] I wonder how many times death has come
[1:19:09] to get you with a sickness or a food or
[1:19:13] a car wreck or whatever more and deaths
[1:19:15] come to get you and Jesus said oh I know
[1:19:18] this it ain't his time yet it ain't her
[1:19:21] time yet back off death back off
[1:19:25] all glory to God why because we even
[1:19:29] possess yes
[1:19:31] and the grave
[1:19:37] oh well Glory said I've done forgot
[1:19:40] about that explosion of that gun he said
[1:19:42] Why didn't it kill me because it
[1:19:44] couldn't God wasn't ready he'd come as
[1:19:47] much as he wants to but he can't take
[1:19:50] you
[1:19:51] Gloria I paid my debt for that a long
[1:19:54] time ago when I believed on Jesus Christ
[1:19:56] who's alive forever more now death
[1:19:59] listens to what we say so if the devil
[1:20:02] tries to take it you say hey buddy
[1:20:04] listen to me I'm not leaving this world
[1:20:08] until my father says it's time for me to
[1:20:10] come home but I'm a cancer I'm a TV I
[1:20:14] don't care what you are you are not
[1:20:17] going to take my life until Jesus Christ
[1:20:20] is ready for me to go because I possess
[1:20:23] deaths not death possessing me
[1:20:33] you say
[1:20:34] a possessor of death
[1:20:37] that's why Paul said here in Corinthians
[1:20:39] death we even possess it
[1:20:43] well when they was fixing to cut his
[1:20:45] head off he said oh death where is your
[1:20:48] sting
[1:20:49] show me where you can scare me
[1:20:52] death said I'll squeeze you down and put
[1:20:56] you in the grave and you're rot and
[1:20:59] Canker and Paul said but thanks be to
[1:21:02] God who gives me the victory through our
[1:21:04] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:08] a grave
[1:21:10] listen that is what he said I I
[1:21:18] thought
[1:21:23] that one time hell possessed you and you
[1:21:26] lived under the influence of hell but
[1:21:28] not no more
[1:21:30] you possess it and you say out of my way
[1:21:32] hell out of my way death out of my way
[1:21:35] Garden if you ain't got no claim on me
[1:21:38] oh praise the Lord I'm an heir of Divine
[1:21:42] Healing I'm an heir of Joy how many
[1:21:46] needs more joy in your life friends we
[1:21:48] are living in a sad time we're living in
[1:21:51] a sad World we're living in a very sad
[1:21:54] sad time and the age of we're living
[1:21:56] when there's so much Darkness all around
[1:21:57] us and Christians find it hard to be
[1:22:00] happy I know I know me too you see so
[1:22:03] much sickness and you see so Much Death
[1:22:05] and so much heartbreaking so much going
[1:22:07] on but I still believe we can have joy
[1:22:10] right in the middle of Trials I believe
[1:22:13] we can have joy unspeakable and full of
[1:22:16] Glory right whatever things are going
[1:22:18] wrong and upside down it seems like
[1:22:22] listen what brother Graham said I'm an
[1:22:24] heir of Joy I've got a right
[1:22:29] to be happy
[1:22:31] wow
[1:22:34] I've got a right to be happy
[1:22:37] you say you're right bill John is that
[1:22:39] your right sisters is that your right
[1:22:40] Brothers
[1:22:44] so you're gonna let the devil stealing
[1:22:45] from you
[1:22:50] now listen I love the way he answers
[1:22:52] himself
[1:22:53] he said I've got a right to be happy
[1:22:56] so he said
[1:22:58] in the form of a question so what makes
[1:23:01] you so happy
[1:23:03] this is this simple tremendous answer
[1:23:07] I've got to write to me
[1:23:10] [Applause]
[1:23:11] so it had nothing to do with the
[1:23:13] temperature had nothing to do with the
[1:23:15] weather I had nothing to do with the
[1:23:17] thermostat on the wall if you'd like to
[1:23:19] froze to death in church or burn up like
[1:23:20] I'm doing right now it had nothing to do
[1:23:22] with Mama didn't fix your favorite
[1:23:24] breakfast for Father's day it had
[1:23:26] nothing to do with your job it had
[1:23:28] nothing to do to understand why we base
[1:23:30] so much of our happiness on things that
[1:23:32] are around us instead of basing it upon
[1:23:35] this one thing you've got a right to be
[1:23:38] happy that's why you can be happy
[1:23:39] because the Lord Jesus purchased your
[1:23:42] right why he was happy himself and he
[1:23:46] said I want to share my happiness with
[1:23:49] my family
[1:23:50] so he says children I'm gonna give you a
[1:23:53] right here you go
[1:23:55] I'm going to give you a rival show oh
[1:23:57] Lord who am I going to be happy
[1:23:58] whoever's going to be happy cause I give
[1:24:00] you this right to be happy
[1:24:03] oh
[1:24:04] okay
[1:24:06] yeah okay I'm going to be happy because
[1:24:08] because he gave me the right you see for
[1:24:10] most of us we don't understand it
[1:24:13] we're constantly controlled by the
[1:24:16] things that are around us
[1:24:19] praise mother Donnie
[1:24:23] oh God
[1:24:24] so what makes you so happy I got a right
[1:24:28] to be how do you know because I'm an
[1:24:31] heir to it amen
[1:24:33] he says now I feel religious
[1:24:40] almond air to happiness I'm an heir to
[1:24:46] Joy I'm an heir to peace I'm an heir to
[1:24:51] eternal life I'm an heir to the Holy
[1:24:54] Spirit I'm an heir to every evidence
[1:24:58] it's got I am an heir to the authority
[1:25:02] of God
[1:25:04] who made you that not me he did every
[1:25:08] one of you
[1:25:10] is an heir to the same thing
[1:25:18] wow
[1:25:22] notice he says I am an heir
[1:25:25] to a throne
[1:25:27] he that overcome us shall set with me
[1:25:30] and my son as I have overcome and sit
[1:25:32] down with my father in his throne
[1:25:34] an heir to all things
[1:25:37] not just one thing all things
[1:25:41] everything's under your feet
[1:25:44] this is going to take an understanding
[1:25:46] from God to help you to comprehend what
[1:25:48] I'm fixing to read to you
[1:25:49] even death
[1:25:52] is under your feet the grave is under
[1:25:56] your feet hell is under your feet sin is
[1:26:02] under your feet everything is under your
[1:26:05] feet you are an heir you are dead and
[1:26:10] your life is hid in Christ through God
[1:26:12] there you Rose again to eternal life
[1:26:14] setting in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:26:16] Jesus and he says that again
[1:26:19] he's getting Plum beside himself honey
[1:26:21] call us anything you want to say we're
[1:26:24] crazy if you want to but we are heirs
[1:26:28] heirs to what all things
[1:26:33] all right

[1:28:30] all my power
[1:28:36] my omnipotence
[1:28:38] is yours
[1:28:40] as I stand in your midst

[1:31:54] liar and you are a thief and you are a
[1:31:57] deceiver and when you ain't no more I

[1:33:05] the peace from our family I've got the
[1:33:08] warrant right here in the name of Jesus
[1:33:10] get out
[1:33:18] you hear so much of in the day that
[1:33:20] we're living
[1:33:23] that if you abandon your house or your
[1:33:26] apartment
[1:33:27] or you're taking a tour say to Rome
[1:33:29] wherever and you're gone for so many
[1:33:31] days
[1:33:32] our crazy government
[1:33:34] has given a lot of these people a right
[1:33:38] to go in and move in your house
[1:33:42] and they call it squatters rights
[1:33:46] and once they get in it's nearly
[1:33:49] impossible to get them out because you
[1:33:52] abandoned your house and you was gone
[1:33:54] somewhere well this I've got the title d
[1:33:56] right here it's mine but you were gone
[1:34:00] and you was gone long enough
[1:34:02] to get this squatter a right
[1:34:06] y'all heard of that
[1:34:07] I've been reading some of the stories
[1:34:09] about what they've been doing to get rid
[1:34:11] of some of them squatters I thought aha
[1:34:15] sounds like something we might need to
[1:34:18] do to the devil well some of them hook
[1:34:20] up an electric cord to the doorknob
[1:34:25] yeah there's all kinds of things you can
[1:34:28] do by law to get rid of that squatter
[1:34:31] well that's the way it's done some of
[1:34:33] your homes that's the way he's done some
[1:34:35] of your bodies he's moved in and said
[1:34:37] well he like me she let me they allowed
[1:34:40] me to do it you need to hook up not 110
[1:34:43] but a holy ghost power of God to the
[1:34:45] doorknob and when the devil touches that
[1:34:47] door and say I'm going back
[1:34:51] what in the world had me baptism of the
[1:34:54] Holy Ghost entire out of here devil get
[1:34:57] on back to Hell leave my body alone
[1:35:00] leave my daughter alone
[1:35:13] brother Donnie the Elder you get I
[1:35:14] believe the crazier you're getting well
[1:35:16] good
[1:35:18] [Applause]
[1:35:20] other
[1:35:21] when you got a courage enough to step up
[1:35:24] and toe to toe the line with the devil
[1:35:27] and scapped him off
[1:35:32] what a great theological term
[1:35:36] if I went to my house tonight
[1:35:39] and I got a legal Deed from my house and
[1:35:41] if I went in there someone was laying in
[1:35:44] there drinking and carrying on
[1:35:46] I'd say you have no right to get out get
[1:35:49] out of here friend
[1:35:51] well that say this is a house for human
[1:35:54] beings
[1:35:55] I've got a right to be here I'd say you
[1:35:58] do not
[1:35:59] I possess this house it's mine will it
[1:36:03] say I've got it right
[1:36:06] to stop sickness enter the body or
[1:36:09] ascend
[1:36:11] so while the other ones drank the others
[1:36:14] do this or that or the other but he has
[1:36:16] no legal rights I can take my abstract
[1:36:18] deed and go down to the courts and say
[1:36:21] look at here
[1:36:23] someone has moved in here that doesn't
[1:36:26] belong here and this is mine it belongs
[1:36:30] to me and the law would come up and put
[1:36:33] them out because I have an abstract
[1:36:36] written deed to the property brother and
[1:36:40] sister we have an abstract written deed
[1:36:43] tonight to Salvation to Divine Healing
[1:36:46] and the devil has no rights
[1:36:50] no rights
[1:36:52] trust God and the Holy Ghost to put him
[1:36:55] out that's all I'll say I feel religious
[1:36:58] right now he says well he was getting
[1:37:01] Plum religious wasn't it
[1:37:02] brother we need some more Christians not
[1:37:05] jellyfish
[1:37:10] jellyfish
[1:37:12] but with a backbone that'll stand well I
[1:37:16] don't mean to fuss with people but stand
[1:37:18] your god-given rights that Christ died
[1:37:20] for certainly not be pushed around no
[1:37:23] sir we got an inheritance Our Heritage
[1:37:26] belongs at us and it's your privilege
[1:37:28] Amen to have anything Jesus Christ died
[1:37:32] for yes sir Satan said I'll tell you one
[1:37:34] thing what I'm going to do no you ain't
[1:37:39] that's the way to talk back to him he
[1:37:42] says
[1:37:43] someone here I'll tell you what I'm
[1:37:45] gonna do said shut your mouth
[1:37:47] and get out of here I'll tell you what
[1:37:49] I'm gonna do I'm gonna know you ain't
[1:37:50] gonna do nothing you ain't got no rights
[1:37:53] well glory to God that's the way to talk
[1:37:55] to him say I know my position in Christ
[1:37:58] and you thought you'd get away with it
[1:38:00] but you ain't gonna do it
[1:38:05] we act like Satan is our boss
[1:38:13] there's a great difference
[1:38:15] between being a boss
[1:38:18] and being bossy
[1:38:22] dear Jesus help me
[1:38:25] a lot of folks are bossy
[1:38:30] you need to do this and you never need
[1:38:32] to do that you need to do something else
[1:38:34] and you look at their own life and their
[1:38:35] own own life is tore all two pieces but
[1:38:38] yet they know what you ought to do in
[1:38:39] every circumstance of your life
[1:38:41] I personally have a little bit of hard
[1:38:43] time to be able to take advice from
[1:38:44] people that can't take advice from
[1:38:45] others
[1:38:46] thank you Jesus a leader that cannot be
[1:38:49] led is not a god-called leader a leader
[1:38:52] what says he's a leader which cannot
[1:38:54] take Godly advice from other leaders
[1:38:56] there's something wrong with that
[1:38:56] leadership shame on you if you follow
[1:38:58] one of such
[1:39:00] so Satan is not your boss
[1:39:04] but he does talk bossy
[1:39:08] like you need to do this and I'll tell
[1:39:10] you one thing you better not get up
[1:39:12] there and Shout they've got them video
[1:39:13] cameras everywhere and somebody will see
