a washtub 20ft spear his coat of mail and his weight put together would have been about 1,000 pounds but faith can look at it and said all that weight is going to work against you all your bragging and all your boasting is going to work against you that's the way Faith looks at it we welcome you tonight appreciate the opportunity for us to be together we're going to invite Brother David if he'll come had a wonderful service here last night and we're looking for the Lord to just come again and move for us in a wonderful way U all the youths that are here with us that are visiting from other churches and other states we welcome you we trust that it'll be a blessing for the effort and all that you put forth to be here be sure and greet your family when you go back home for us in your your home Church wherever you're from we want to try to uh treat you welcome while you're here and I just believe that the Lord will also make a blessing for each of us we're thankful that God has given us the opportunity for our youth to gather I've said it to our own youths before U I never got to go to a young people's service whenever I was a young teenager I started preaching when I was 18 so the first youth service I attended I preached it so you all don't know how blessed you are to be able to have youth services and you have so many in the message anymore it's hard to make your choice of where you want to go right so you can go here you can go there and we're grateful for that so it can be a able to be a blanket coverage and make it available for our use but I know you understand it but I just want to remind you the reason your pastors and your churches and the evangelists and the ministers that come and preach in them the reason they do that is because they love you and they want to try to do everything they can to help you in your walk and your journey for truly you're facing things I never face whenever I was a young man you're facing things your parents didn't face so we want to do everything we can to try to help you we believe that these ministers Brother David brother Daniel they David and brother Danny R have studied and they've prayed and they've asked God to help them and we're just believing that he's going to do that how many come with a need in your life amen well that's awesome let's just believe him tonight let's sing touching Jesus Harry as Brother David comes so appreciate the service s sign appreciate Brother David getting out of the way and just asking God to use him and we just trust he'll go the same direction tonight and where of the Lord's the Lord's mind is for you a woman tried so many Physicians yet grew wor so to Jesus she came [Music] and when that trial they tried to restrain her but she [Music] whisper this is what you want to say tonight now Lord I'm here I've got needs oh touching [Music] [Music] life will never be the [Music] same for there's only one way to touch you You Must Believe when you call on all let's let's lift our hands tonight and tell him touching Jesus Oh touching Jesus it is all that really matters and then your life will never be yes the same I said there is only one way to touch him this is what we got to do you just be when you call on his name everybody say praise the Lord praise the Lord Us by our hearts and go to the Lord in word of prayer tonight and ask him to come and visit with us speak to us by his word knowing that he never disappoints father we just come before you tonight Lord and we just want to commit ourselves into your hands as we lord we come to this service to be able to be helped and Lord you've seen every hand that's been raised tonight Lord and you know the need that's underneath each hand we know Lord that you're mindful of those needs tonight and we pray Lord that by the preaching of the word May the spirit of God may it Lord move among your people tonight Lord these young people that is here and I pray Lord that it would just minister to each one and Lord we're in great need of you in this day Lord if there ever was a time that we need you we need you more right now than what we've ever needed you before so we want to make you welcome Lord we don't want just to invite you as it was in the scripture but we want to make you welcome Among Us may you come Lord and have your way in this place tonight Lord and that you would just use us tonight Lord help me to be able to just step aside Lord that you could come and say something Lord for one word for you what it would mean to us if you just speak to us and father we just dedicate the service into your hands for the glory of God we pray and everybody said amen amen God bless you tonight while you're standing with we're going to go to the Book of Matthew chapter 14 Matthew chapter 14 we want to start with verse 22 and we'll say it's a great honor to be here to minister for you we appreciate the invitation brother Joe to be able to come and and to speak to the young people tonight and ask the Lord to just take his word something to challenge your faith tonight um it's going to be a little bit strange but I think sometimes saying it in strange ways kind of gets our attention and help us Matthew 14 and22 and straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him andto the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away Glory he went up into a high mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea it was tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it's a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid and Peter answered answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me to come to thee on the water and Jesus said I love this just one words all Peter needed and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus like to speak on this subject tonight the Lord will help us stepping out of the boat may the Lord add His blessings to the word you can be seated tonight yeah we know that we're living in a time period to where our faith is TR truly going to be tested in the day that we're living in we know that our faith is going to be tested uh our belief the things that we say that we believe our belief will be tested if we testify that it is the truth I believe that that belief is going to be tested not only will our faith now not only will our belief but I believe that our fervency is going to be tested if we say that we believe something and we stand upon it and we are uh we we are so focused to believe with everything that that is the truth I believe that we will have to be tested and what God reveals to us Satan will make sure that we're tested whether we truly believe that or not and because of this test that we go through the prophet makes this statement out of second-handed robe and he says I realize that every time Faith sets itself up that the devil will turn every gun in hell right on it like that so every time that Faith would arise and it will begin to raise up the prophet said that's when Satan turns every gun against that faith that raises up the moment you say that you believe and the moment that you testify of what God's done for you and how that God has moved for you the moment that you take a stand that you say that you're going to serve God I'm going to live for God I'm going to believe God Satan will do everything he can to come against that faith that raises up he'll send every imp and everything that hell has to offer he'll send it against you to try to stop that fa Faith from being able to raise up he'll send troubles your way he'll send turmoils your way all kinds of stress all kinds of pressure will come against you and you will never even be able to dream of the things that Satan will bring against you to try to try the faith that you say that you got and because of the great battles that we face I thought of this tonight to be able to deliver this to you and it's going to sound strange but I would personally like to have the ability to be able to walk on water and one amen I would like to have the abil I'm being just as honest as I can be I would love to have the ability to be able to walk on the water now that may sound crazy and that may sound like you know you've lost your mind but I'm not talking about a river and I'm not talking about a lake I'm not talking about a pond but I'm talking about life itself many different times the prophet would tell us he said that life is like a sea and he said the sea whenever the wind comes across the water he said the sea becomes unstable and he said when it becomes unstable he said the waves begin to grow higher and higher as the wind moves across the water and because life is that way we realize that life is unstable and life is uncertain it's always moving and things is always changing and you know you think you got all of it figured out and all of a sudden Everything Changes in life it tosses us to and fro because we're constantly on this sea over and over again and the prophet would tell us a lot of times that life is like storms that that whips upon the sea and he causes the sea to be unstable and brother says that's the kind of age that we're living in it's an age that is unstable it's a age of uncertainty the prophet said and I hear him say today it's a day that the four the the the the actual moral fibers of humanity has absolutely completely gone from even Humanity not just in motherhood not just in fatherhood but Humanity alone the moral fibs is all but gone and David said it like this when David talked about the time of the Rapture in Psalms 27 he said it's going to be a time of trouble and it is it'll be a time distress and it is and how true is it today there has never been a time of such uncertainty as what there is right now and I want to be very honest with you young people you cannot expect for the Seas to remain calm you cannot expect to have calm Waters you cannot expect the days of calm Waters is over as a matter of fact the prophet tells us it's going to get worse and worse and worse I hear the prophet say today day he said brother Ram tells us he said that he said it's going to continually he said he said one place he looks at it he said it will gradually get worse and then brother random stops and he said no not gradually it's going to rapidly get worse until Jesus comes that tells me that the waters are going to continue to be contrary that tells me that man is going to be contrary not only will man governments are going to be that way people's going to be that way the waters are going to be rough and the waves are going to be high and that's because I want the ability if the water's going to be high and the waves are going to be high I want the ability to walk on water amen you realize because of the uncertainty of humanity that people don't even know who they are they don't even know what they are they don't know what they're supposed to be and they're they're running here and there trying to find answers you know and they go to psych atrist to try to get an answer but the problem is the psychiatrists are going to psychiatrist and the reason why is they're looking for some kind of help but the psychiatrist does not have the answer doctors don't have the answer our government doesn't have the answer the pope doesn't have the answer everywhere we look there is trouble everywhere we look there is uncertainty but let me say this if I can walk on the water tonight no matter how contrary the water is no matter how high the waves are if I can walk on the water it doesn't matter I want the ability to walk over sickness I want the ability to walk over fear I want the ability to walk over stress and disease and walk over cancer I want to walk on the water tonight I may not be able to stop the waves and I may not be able to stop the storms but if I could just walk on that water I'm not asking God to calm the waters I'm not asking God to change it but says you ask for peace he said he gives you the best thing you need and it's not calm Waters but I do say tonight Lord let me walk on if if that's the way it's got to be I don't want to be tossed around like the rest of the world amen I don't want to be tossed like everybody else I want to walk on what other people sink in you say brother that's farfetched a why in the world when I sink to the bottom when I'm a son or you're a daughter of God why sink when you're God's a Creator why sink when we serve an all powerful all knowing all sufficient God why sink when you can walk on it I believe God's given us the authority Hallelujah I believe this I don't believe we have to sink into depression I don't believe we got to sink into fear I don't believe we got to sink and lower ourselves to the morals of the world I put up with if you can walk on the water that's our setting tonight our scene opens up with a storm on the Sea of Galilee and remember the prophet tells us that those storms on that sea but the sea would get all unstable and here are some disciples that's Crossing this water about the time the storm comes up now remember the prophet tells us they've been on that sea all night long but now it had come to the darkest watch of the night which was the fourth watch so it's the darkest time of the night it is the time to where it's it's just it's not daylight but yet it's so dark a dark time a Dark Age a dark moment a dark hour and here is a storm and let me just say this these ain't just any people on this water this ain't just another set of fishermen these are God's men this is God's elect this is the one that Jesus loves handpicked by Jesus himself the ones he loves and cares about and I'm want to tell you if Jesus loves you and he cares about you won't he watch over you I want you to notice where did this storm come from this is not Jesus testing their faith this is not Jesus trying them this is not Jesus testing them he's not trying to see how much Faith they got he's not trying to test them on how mature that they are but actually the prophet tells us the author of this storm is the Devil Himself amen and he notice what he's doing the prophet said he's taking advantage of the opportunity because the disciples didn't have Jesus in the boat amen he finally got him to a place where Jesus wasn't mide and Jesus wasn't in the ship and because Jesus is not there Satan sends this storm and he moves upon the Water to try to kill Jesus's elect oh I can't say it any better than that oh my you realize when Jesus is there the storms didn't work remember he'd already tried that a great storm to be able to sink the ship and they went and woke Jesus up ain't that a good thing to do and when they woke him up up Jesus come to the bow of the boat and he spoke to the storm that was trying to sink the ship but where's Jesus is at now these are men oh let me just say it like this so you can take and see it these are people that love Jesus chosen elected and Satan has caught them without Jesus being in the ship the disciples are crossing this water and brother said they left Jesus but I want to say this the only reason why they're Crossing this water is because Jesus constrain them to go the other side let me just say it they are not in the Fourth Watch of the night because they want it to be but Jesus is the one that directed them he constrained them he told them you must get in that boat and you must go out on the water and I want to say this they're not here by themselves they're commissioned by the Lord himself to where they're at to be in the boat to be crossing the water Jesus has and you're not here alone the reason you're in this age is God put you in this [Applause] day amen said when the waters got choppy brother said the first thing to come to the disciples is they got scared I can preach right there a minute we can't look down upon the disciples because we've done the same thing they have when Waters get rough fear comes around when things you can't explain and you don't know what's going on and your mind's running 100 m hour and you don't know the answer you know what wants to come around fear and the prophet said fear has a way to paralyze your face the prophet said fear Makes You Weary fear makes you wonder and fear makes you doubt and he says fear and faith cannot operate in the same ship in the same boat in the same heart at the same time come on somebody so Satan sends this storm across the sea and brother Ram told us not only did he have the ability to be able to zern people at the platform on what it happened but he can even discern what Satan said PL back in the days when the disciples was crossing in the water the prophet said in his ey 1961 when all hopes was gone and the little boat was pitched like a bottle stopper out there when 10,000 Devils of the sea swore they swore that they would drown the disciples that night cuz they'd gone off without him listen now and That's what Satan says today so he takes takes that story from the Fourth Watch of the night and he brings that same mentality of the enemy 10,000 Devils they are swearing that they will drown you now notice the only reason Satan hates them is because of their Association because of their faith because of who they're following oh I'm preaching to somebody tonight because of who they're F because of the stand they made because of what they believe because they're following Jesus because they're standing with Jesus because they say Amen to what Jesus says Satan hates them they're a threat to hell they're upsetting his plan amen and let me just say this you who believe the word for this day you who stand for the word of this day you are a threat to the kingdom of hell and Satan will do everything he can try to stop you he'll do everything he can to try to stop me why you are a threat to his [Applause] plan he'll cause waves of sickness to come across your life he'll cause wave of discouragement to come across all kinds of Doubt storms of weariness storms of fear to do what to try to sink your ship the prophet says he knows if he can get the disciples to fear if he can shake them up enough to fear if he can stir them up enough to fear he knows that faith and fear cannot move in the same place and he knows that faith and fear cannot reside in the same place at the same time so what's he going to do catch him at a vulnerable moment oh let me preach right here catch you at a vulnerable moment when you're weak and you ain't been pray praying like you need to you ain't read your Bible like you need to maybe you're not going to church like you need to and when you don't go to church you get weak you get feeble if you don't eat natural food you get weak and you get feeble if you don't eat spiritual food you'll get weak you come on somebody so he wants to stir their minds to catch them weak catch them down catch them discouraged and he'll use any tactic that he can can he'll use any person that he can he'll use disease he'll use health problems he'll do everything to try to bring fear around your life to try and make you doubt the faith that God has put in you the prophet tells us he put a demon on every wave he put a demon on every every de every wave that was slapped had one goal one purpose put fear instill fear make fear come into them the prophet said he was blowing his poisonous breath across that sea and he'll do everything he can to sink your boat sink your life take your morals away take your Purity away take your confession of Faith away and make you feel so guilty under condemnation that you don't feel like that you can ever stand up and worship again and praise him again and love him again that's what Satan wants to do is sink your boat but I want to tell you something tonight let me tell you something the devil didn't know Jesus was coming I said Jesus was coming Not only was Jesus coming he was watching over his sons he was watching over his elect Jesus had his eye upon them they may have left Jesus but Jesus never left them her prop it tells us he climbed up to the high mountain oh think about after the death be and Resurrection he climbed up on high and he's been watching over you ever since what he didn't know is Jesus was watching every move oh I hear the prophet tell us he said that Jesus was not going to allow to get bad enough to where it can take them all the way down and in the Fourth Watch of the night when it looked like they're fixing to be dead the next wave could be it about that time the one that watches over you and the one that watches over me here he come walking over sickness here he come walking over doubt here he come walking over fear here he come walking over every wave every demon that was in that wave Jesus put his foot on top of it he come walking over over the waves he come walking over all the trouble he come walking past all the fear he come walking past everything that Satan was showing up here come Jesus right down to where they was at I want to tell you Jesus knows where you're at he knows what you're dealing with he knows what you're going through Glory he knows and he cares and he's watching he would only allow the waves to get so high right Hallelujah he would only allow the wind to how for so long and here's my message to you you can either sit in this boat or you can walk on the water as a matter of fact I can't think of nothing better than a whole church walking on water I can't think of nothing better than all these young people Walking On Water Mama walking on water daddy walking on water grandpa walking on water churches preachers deacons trustees everybody go walking on the white Air I think we need to look up and say Lord if that be you did me to come un thee you know why Peter said that because he realized it's safer walking with the Lord sir than it is sitting in the boat I want to walk on what you're walking on ain't that the way you feel I want to walk on what you walk on I want to overcome the way David overcome I want to overcome the way Samson overcome I want to walk on what other people sink in for it to happen we've got to have more than just human faith but we've got to have a perfect Faith watch our faith has got to arise to the level that God has given us the word at to where we can come to a perfect faith in so much that we stand up and we say Lord if that's you brother that's all Peter needed to hear that's said that's all he needed to hear now let me ask you what do you need to hear what do you need to hear what preacher what sermon what quote what what do you need to hear what after everything that God has given us and said over and over and week in and week out what do we need to hear well if I had this I'd be a better Christian that's a copout well if I had that I think I could do better that's a copout everything that we have needed has already been provided in the word of God and all we've got to do is take it and believe it and step out of the boat I want to tell you what I see it's one thing to set in the boat it's a complete different Revelation altoe when you step out of the boat can I tell you what I see I see people hunkered down in the boat and they're riding this thing out well if it lets up a little bit I'll stand up until then I've got White Knuckles and I'm holding on until the wind quits until the waves quit I'm going to tell you they're not going to stop I'm telling you they're not going to stop amen how can you walk on the water if you don't stand up and claim your god-given rights how can you walk on the water if you're looking around at everybody else and you're hunker down on the boat people think they're spiritual cuz they made it and sitting in the boat you go to church I go to church it don't take a spiritual person to sit in the church anybody can come to this building and sit on pews anybody can carry a Bible around anybody can carry message books around anybody can put a picture on their wall but it takes somebody who is serious with Jesus when the boat goes to Rocket and the waves go to move it it takes somebody that knows who they are and where they're standing at to stand up in the middle of the boat in the middle of trouble in the middle of aest in the middle of sickness stand up and say Lord if that be you B me to come into thee on the water why why do we think the safest place is hunkered in the boat because we put more faith in the boat than what we do Walking With Jesus I'm going to agree there's Securities in the boat there's ores there sales but here's the problem the ores are broke and the cells are broke but why is it that we hold on to Broken ores maybe I can mend the sail I'll sail us right on out of here there's certain Securities in the boat it's tangible it's built to float amen can I tell you one well Brother David has got me this far and what happens is we put more faith in material things than what we do walking withes Jesus but our faith is ordered of the Lord to go past temporal things I wonder what would the end of Matthew 14 read be read like had Peter not stood up in the boat that night what would your Bible read like I doubt this story would have made Matthew's account had amen somebody I wonder how's the end of your story going to be read how's the end of your book going to be read what's it going to be said about you is it going to be boat hugger is it going to be or hugger is it going to be saale hugger or is it going to be somebody in this church somebody in this youth meeting somebody in this place stood up and said Lord that looks like you that sounds like you I believe that you B me to come unto thee on the water lord I believe it l me it's got to be you if it ain't you it's got to be me somebody has got to walk on the white hour the safest place is not the boat the safest place ain't your comfort zone the safest place ain't Lea it ain't the church it's walking on the [Applause] water how many times have we got hunkered down the boat and that demon on that way wave comes up and slaps the side of that ship and you don't know what's going on cuz you got your head down and you got your eyes closed and you know what we usually do hope I ain't got no problem with hope but only hope only going to take you so far and faith has got to take you the rest of the way hunker down got our eyes closed hoping hoping the waves quit hoping the wind stops and all you're doing it's hanging on you're there along for the ride you're hoping it gets better but I'm going to say this I've been guilty of being hunkered in the boat myself if you be honest every one of us at times has enjoyed the Securities of the boat let's just be honest it's a lot easier sometimes it's a lot less embarrassing sometimes amen hopeing everything's going to be all right hoping that it's going to get better I'm preaching to somebody tonight we've got to have more than hope we need a faith a perfect Faith to stand up and to step out of the boat we get so much confidence in the boat I'll just be honest with you it amazes me what people do in the boat they put so much confidence in the boat they start bailing water and that's all fine and good but the problem is there's more trouble coming in than what there is being bailed out but because we believe the boat's the safest place we just start bailing water and with that mentality we get the mindset I can help myself I can save myself I can do this by myself all I got to do is just keep bailing this water and I want to tell you the next wave will put twice as much trouble twice as much sickness twice as much weariness and gloominess than what the first Bell of water you threw out it's going to take more than your abilities to save you if you don't get a hold of Jesus you may die sitting in that boat amen it's impossible to keep the boat afloat without faith let me tell you what I mean by that it's impossible to go in the Rapture without fa it's impossible to overcome this age without fa amen we must stand up and speak and say Lord if that be you the prophet said the ores are broke boats filling up with water cells is already broke and here broke and here they are hanging onto this boat I say there must be a young man a young woman a preacher there must be a people that's been prophesied about in this book that's going to stand up matter of fact I don't believe it's just going to be one I believe it's going to be a universal bride and it's time for the body of Christ to start walking on some things that others has sunk in it's time we let this Faith that's been building up sermon after sermon after sermon word after word allow that word to come to materialization and let it build up and put the word into action we can preach it but it must be put in action listen to me it's imperative that we get out of the boat right let me tell you about this age you can't stay here you can't stay here you realize the last vision of America was in craters and Ashes you can't stay here you cannot remain here you must have a faith you must arise and have faith to get out of this land the words ain't going to move you and the sail's not going to move you it's at that moment that everything looks like it's broken fell apart that Peter looks and sees somebody walking on water oh I can say it better than that surely it's in the darkest hour the darkest part of the night that they find out he ain't never left them it's where they start hearing where he said I'll be with you even in you hallelujah oh it's at that time those words are letting you know I'm here he's here he's here and you look and you see he's here it's during that time oh catch it now that Peter's eyes become illuminated to who is present at this time it's the darkest time but he sees him it's the darkest age but he sees him it's a time of trouble and his eyes come open and after he sees who it is that Revelation oh how can I say it that Revelation did something to Peter when he recognizes who it is when he recognizes who he is that did something to Peter to where it awakened something inside of Peter it went beyond fear it went beyond doubt it went beyond mental comprehension but something in him oh my it moves Peter into a sphere of faith that caus Peter to stand up and speak Hallelujah and this is where we're at right now faith has been restored by the message of the hour it's in this day that God is calling you and I to a higher realm let me say this there's a place that you can walk as a child of God there's a realm that you can walk in there's a place of faith where you can live at and abide at and walk in as a Believer we cannot sit in this boat and keep our eyes on the waves and here comes Jesus Jesus has done his part amen Jesus did his part he's been watching amen but now Peter's got to do his part in this story story well what's Peter got to do Brother David believe let me just say it simple only believe we need to let this word that's been restored by the ministry of Malachi 4 move us into action it's time that we stand up and start walking on the things that has troubled us and beset us and keeps us beat down amen I'm talking about going to the prayer with the same trouble and the same need week in and week out and week in and week out you at some time have got to stand up and put that under your feet and walk over what's been troubling you do you realize the storm moved Peter to speak hallelujah what an hour to be living to where Peter has got a voice in this thing he's got something to do he's got something to say and the storm the trouble the battle the water the waves that demon moved Peter to speak that's what we need tonight to get so fed up with bailing water that it moves our faith into a realm of sphere where brother said it sets your eyes into a dimension that's beyond sea taste feel smell and here it's called faith and it moves you to speech I like this because Jesus when Peter asks and Peter speaks Lord if that' be you let me tell you this Jesus did not remain quiet during the storm he didn't let him feel like he was all by himself but the moment Peter does his part Here Comes Jesus responding with the word he don't remain quiet in the middle of your troubled times he does not remain silent during the middle of Troubled Waters and it didn't take 50 Scriptures it didn't take a hundred quotes it didn't take something pumped up it didn't say take something jumped up it didn't take a hot guitar it didn't take a hot set of drums preach with me somebody all it took was one word I want to say tonight all it takes is real genuine Faith behind one word of God and that one word can move you into action and to put you into action tonight so you can walk on the [Applause] water the word will you say we're in the world did Peter get the authority the word gave him Authority the present tense word of the hour give Peter the authority to walk on the water the present tense word anybody hear me the message of his hour the word of his day give him authority to walk on the water do you hear him tonight this is what I see this is what I see I see the boat tossing I'm not talking about inches I'm talking about feet 10 feet up 10 feet down 20 feet up 20 feet down I can see Peter stand up in that boat and I can see Peter take his foot that feels hard to me I can sing take that first step of faith and stick it over that boat and I want to say this the waves didn't stop when he tried stepping out the winds didn't stop when he tried stepping out if you think everything's going to stop around your life when you tried to start stepping out I want to tell you it'll probably blow harder than it was when you were sitting in the boat because now you're a real threat you've stood up and everybody has seen you and now you're going to step out you don't have one scriptural evidence you don't have one Vindication oh you've got his Divine Authority from the present tense word and Peter starts testing the water feels like a board to me amen if he would have thought in his mind well that's H2O and it's water how in the world am I supposed to walk on that water if Peter would have thought he'd never walked let me tell you what I mean by that you will not be able to figure this out if you can figure it out you don't even need Faith it's more than comprehension it's more than understanding it goes beyond it's a paradox you just do it because the word told you to do it but you know we said Jesus can do it but this is me oh I know it brother Bram was here I guarantee you I guarante brother R's here he can do it brother Donnie can do it brother Joe can do it but what about me and then we say wait a minute Brother David what if I try to step out of the boat and I sink you've already sunk I said with that mentality you've already sunk if Peter would have stopped and thought about it he would have never have gotten out always questions isn't it but no answers ain't that what these propers do give a bunch of questions but they ain't got no answers well what happens if I don't make the Rapture what happens if I'm Not Elected what if I'm not predestined what if I'm not a seat of God your faith has to be so anchored in the revelation of the hour that if nobody else in that boat that if nobody else in this church I don't well brother d is's a man of God I know but I'm going to tell you if I don't go he don't go amen let me tell you don't have more faith in a preacher than what You' got in the god that's on the inside of you that's right all I can tell you is move over I'm going with and here goes Peter Peter that boat bouncing around Peter's oh my can I imagine Peter looking down one moment he's right by the water and water's pouring over the edge and the next moment he's 20 foot high and he just finally stepped out of the boat there was no change in the storm no change in the water no change in the wind but God don't need to change the water and God don't need to change the wind God don't need to change the waves he needed to change Peter the bird pulled him into a dimension and it literally listen to this it literally caught up Peter you know what the word caught up is Rapture Peter got raptured out of the boat he was caught up above the trouble caught up how in the world can we take a body change unless we get caught up first caught up higher than the world caught up higher than sin caught up higher than how can we go on the rure unless we get caught up before the catching up amen amen we must be caught up before the catching up he's got to go beyond his feelings emotions fears abilities and allow it to pull him to the place to do something Supernatural in the presence of God don't you see your Bible is full of people like that the faith of Abraham that called those things which were not as though they were the faith that Samson had when he picked up a dry Jawbone and he killed a thousand Philistines the faith that David had his brother D he said when he killed a giant the faith that shamgar had when he killed Philistines was just an oxco that Authority dropped down on Peter and it lifts him up circumstances didn't matter the odds don't matter being outnumbered doesn't matter the size of the giant don't matter size of the Waves don't matter how hot the fire is doesn't matter because Faith knows no circumstance Faith doesn't even look at symptoms it looks to the Divine promise of God you realize if you could ever really catch what I'm preaching today it'll change your walk with God forever let me warn you you stand up in the boat you'll get the attention of everybody you stand up in your college dorm you're going to get the attention of everybody you stand up think about it everybody's going to be watching you everybody's going to be looking at you and you say you're a Believer you say you're sold out you say Anchored In Christ they're going to think you're crazy they're going to think you're a fanatic but the only problem is they didn't hear what you heard you heard that word say come right on Jesus must speak to you personally to come right on that's all right we've always been looked at strange ain't that the way denominations looked at you when you stepped up and stood up in their boat ain't that the way they looked at you when you took your name off of their book they always looked at you strange even people around this message will look at you strange well who do you think you are what do you think you're doing I've been around this thing for 45 years what in the world are you doing well we've had this revival and that Revival and this revival who do you think you are I don't think I'm nobody but let me tell you I heard him say come I'm not better than somebody else I just want to tell you I heard him I said I heard him I heard what he said I'm afraid we miss it we know quotes we know scriptures we know seals we know Thunders we know pools but what good does all the mechanics do if there's not a facei to get us out of the boat let's buy our hearts tonight if you would every head bound every eye Clos I wonder what you're listening for tonight what are you listening for what are you trying to hear or have you just swap boats I'm afraid that's what many people has done they swap Baptist boats for message boats Catholic boats for message boats but God's got to have somebody to put their foot over and start walking out it ain't for you to figure out how it's all going to work what what am I going to do with my friends that ain't got nothing to do with you that's God's business that's just like you asking well how how in the world's God going to heal me that ain't none of my business that's God's business God delivers the way he wants to deliver God meets your need the way he wants to meet your need it ain't you trying to figure it out it's just standing up and stepping out of the boat did not Jesus tell us in his word that where I am you may be also what do I got to do just take him at his word just take and believe what he has said if you believe what he said you can step out without fear without doubt without dread and you can possess a walk of fa and walk in a roomm where all things are possible we cannot sit around listen to me young people you cannot sit around just hoping somebody else gets up and does it I say you as an individual must take the initiative to yourself that's the where we should be at Lord if there's going to be a Revival won't you go ahead and just start right here Lord if you want somebody to stand up I know I may look like an oddball but I just want you to go ahead and start with me I I want you looking at anybody else Lord if you need somebody I want you to send me take the coal of fire and put it on me tonight and just because you step out of the boat doesn't mean that your battle's going to be over because you got to keep your eyes fixed on the word keep your eyes fixed on Jesus stepping out of the boat hallelujah hallelujah I believe there's somebody in this building that feels the pull maybe you've looked in your own heart and searched your own mind but Jesus wants you to be that one that stands up you feel the pull of the hour you feel the pull you feel the need but look at how much tries to stand between you and really what you need but I believe that Jesus wants to help you tonight let's sing that song I Feel the pool was singing earlier oh don't you need him what was it what is that part in the inside of you that give you that pull to want to go the Altar and give your heart to God that same pool that you feel to want to worship and to love him and want to serve him you realize that same pool will pull You Higher and Higher and Higher not getting to a place where I'm just satisfied being here oh no Lord I want to go higher until I leave here amen praise God oh let's stand our feet in and I can we just close our eyes [Music] tonight why

and take control I [Music] feel amen amen do you enjoy that tonight [Applause] I was just thinking there you know Jesus never told Peter to get out of the boat never told him to but there's something it's just like you tonight you might be stuck in something but if you have what the Christ in you that was out on them Waters eventually you're coming out of the boat you'll not stay in there and then what it really struck me was that Jesus didn't tell Peter Peter wait let me calm it down let me calm this water down you can sit at home your depression will never leave it'll never leave God will leave it just like it is till you step out on top of it there's a voice out in the middle of your depression that's saying come there's a voice in the middle of your anxiety that's telling you to come it's going to be there and you're sitting home and you won't go to church no more you won't go to youth stuff anymore because because all these battles that you're fighting these things that's in your life these setting things in your life and and you you think staying home is going to it's still there it's always going to be there until you step out on top of it when when when Jesus didn't make the water any smaller he didn't make Goliath any smaller for David he didn't make the Lion's little kitty cats for Daniel and he didn't put the fire out before the the Hebrew children went in but out in the middle of that there's a voice calling you but you have to be willing you have to have faith to stay step out on top of it that that that's my desire you know it's it's just you know we live in an age and as he was saying tonight you you young people are fighting battles that that we've never fought I can't imagine when I when I was at the police department dealt with juveniles suicide 12 year olds committing suicide because they couldn't cope with this age they don't they didn't have a Jesus out there telling them step out on the water you've got one tonight you've got one that said get out of the boat you can't just sit in the boat and read your Bible and hear sermon after sermon you we got people that are going to spend their eternal life the rest of their life sitting in a boat pressing play and going to hell there's a Jesus on the water amen it's time to get out of the boat that's my desire for you for the youth y'all are my heart you this is what me and brother Rob think about all the time is what we can do for you the best thing we can do for you is present Jesus to you and that's what we're trying to do not by some man up here by telling you about him he's on the water and he's standing out there just get out of the boat there's nothing to worry about you've got nothing to worry about just take what you heard tonight and put it in your heart you know it it takes faith brother brand said human Faith only goes so far but then God's faith when it takes over right that to give you anything you have need of can we sing that song why would I worry why would I fear let's sing this as we get ready to leave remember the banquet tomorrow we got uh 6:00 check in and 6:30 let's let's worship a minute and then we'll we'll get out of [Music] here out on the w

stays always near he lives in my heart and he hears when I cry I call on his name till the storm passes by we read in the Bible how he walked with them brought light to their darkness when the way was so dim how great it would be to have his steps leading mine to walk with the master all of the time and When Trials come and death seem so now call on the master said it be there on time when I'm in trouble and my body in pain all I have to do is call on his name Why Should I Worry why should I fear the very same Jesus he stays always near he lives in my heart and he hears when I cry I call on
