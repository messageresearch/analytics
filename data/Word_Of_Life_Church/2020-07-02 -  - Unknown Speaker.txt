presence tonight we wouldn't want to be here if you were not here because it would be fine to be with our brothers and sisters so we enjoy that fellowship but just to have a meeting without you it would it would not be a real meeting we invite you to come and we ask your Lord that we can truly put our focus on our concentration on you that's reason we come to church we try to come a little bit

Lord God hallelujah praise the Lord not subject for tonight is love the evidence of life love the evidence of life let's turn to first John chapter 3 verse 11 I've not just read about this love I've experienced it amen first john chapter 3 verse 11 for this is the message that ye heard from the beginning that we should love one another not as Cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother wherefore slew he him because his own works were evil which is of a bad nature is what the word evil means of a bad nature and his brothers righteous Marvel not my brethren if the world hates you okay now what in the world has that got to do with Cain and Abel Cain killed Abel because his works were Ivonne's brother sriracha's then the very next verse Marvel not my brothers if the world hates you this verse here is the very epitome of the verse we just read prior to worldliness my friends it's not just long hair on the man short hair on a woman hatred is worldliness Marvel not my brethren if the world hate you I listen this is the assurance that the first century Christians who were born of the Holy Ghost this is the assurance they had we know that we had passed from death unto life because we're in the message because I believe God sent a prophet Paul it's no Marvel to make friends as I said to this one so many message people are so uncertain as to have the Holy Ghost they're not basing it on scriptural basis well I believe this and I believe that and I believe this and I believe that it's not what you believe it's what's happened to you and who you are you understand you can believe believe believe and believe and still not be born again but if this happens to you it is a sign that you are a new creature in Christ Jesus now listen how sure well I hope I got the Holy Ghost I believe I'm hoping that up we know that we had passed from death unto life because we love the Brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth and death and whosoever hate us his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him praise the Lord I'm glad I've passed from death unto life I bet you were gonna pray a text brother Jason yawns just a little while before service and ask him he'll but the bill was done and he said that but the bill had got to actually come home for a few hours today and tomorrow they're gonna give him a pass to be able to come home tomorrow and Lord willin if everything's going well he'll be able to go to to his church tomorrow for the first time since all these events happened so we're just thankful to the Lord he certainly still needs need some more things to be done and we're just believing God for that and I just wanted to share that with you I so appreciate what the Lord is doing for our brother let's bow our heads together Lord Jesus how we thank you tonight for this great great love lord I pray that you would so engulf our hearts we know Lord Jesus because people in this day are so wrapped up in the term of love and what they think is love at first glance when we look at these things we think Paul that's the same stuff the world is preaching the Lord with a second glance we realize it and even know we're in the same ballpark as what they're saying this is you for God is love father I pray that you would take us to not Lord pull us into a sphere of love Lord that we've never been in before help us that we can lay aside everything that would hinder our lives Lord Jesus made this so imprint upon our souls and our beings that we will never be the same by one visitation you carried brother Branham allowed him to move into that realm of the sixth dimension it was not the bluegrass that was bawling in the wind it was not the white robes that he saw on those it was not the throne because he didn't see the throne but he said he would never be the same again but what was it that affected him was that sense of perfect love and he said they told him this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost Lord I pray that you would help us message preachers to preach the Holy Ghost in the same way speak to us tonight from your word father in Jesus name and the Saints said god bless you you may be seated let's turn to st. John chapter 13 verse 34 if you would and this let me remind you of the new commandment on the basis that this new covenant is going to be established between Jesus and his spiritual mystical bride remember love is not now being introduced in the New Testament but it's love to a degree that is being introduced in the New Testament which has never been quite known before we know that Adam and Eve must have walked in a realm of perfect love in a realm of just great harmony with God in a realm of fellowship and understanding with each other but what they had they could fall away from the image that Adam had he could loose the image of God the walk that he had was God he was able to lose by forfeiture of losing that position was God so we know then that the thing that God wants us to be restored to is even beyond what Adam had now listen Jesus being the head of the new race and keep in mind now that that came being the head of the first one of Satan's productivity in the human race and look at his reaction Cain slew his brother so instead of giving his life for his brother he took his brother's life which would be the worst that you and I could do to anyone now if I rob something from you if you worked long enough you could probably get it back if I hurt your feelings if time went on long enough you would get over it if I took something from you that was precious to you no doubt you'd be able to get over but if I took your life there's nothing that could ever be done to restore that back to you if I took your life your existence your representation upon the earth that is the very worst thing that I could do for you but if I would be able to save your life or restore your life or give your life back that would be the greatest thing I could ever do that would be greater than even making you a millionaire which you might lose in the stock market or you would lose you know because of the economy but if I would be able to give your life so giving of life and taking a life then is one of the greatest things that we could do to one another now noticing Kane takes his brother's life but Jesus says a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another now this new commandment tests man as nothing else good there is nothing now remember this is not a preacher saying this this is not someone's opinion but this is the author of the New Covenant himself so surely he should know what the contents of the will says and the impossibility of mere human beings been able to fulfill the contents of that will without a divine intervention in their soul this is going to be the ultimate test on down through the ages now truly they will have a portion of the Holy Ghost through Luther West and Pentecost but at the end time the full restoration of the baptism of the Holy Ghost will be restored again and it won't just be a baptism but it will be the token which will be the literal life of the sacrifice himself so you see God is demanding more of us even now than when we go first got saved 5 years ago 10 years ago 20 years ago whatever it is so the only ones who has received eternal life according to st. John 5:24 will be the ones that will be able to meet this criteria of God it is so high the demands are set so high there is no other person outside of the regenerated that will ever be able to do this now they will think they love their brother they will go because Satanists so whitewash the real understanding of what love is and it's not everybody putting their arms around everybody whole we just love everybody and we let it people come to our church and they live how they want to and our preacher don't ever preach against sin and he loves everybody he don't love nobody female preach against sin because real sin remember this same man right here who talked about love the book of John that talked about love also called a man's name from the pulpit in the book and called a man's name by the name of dioptre fees and exposed him publicly your message folks who don't think it's right to call a man's name publicly you need to reread your Bible and you need to reread the message praise the Lord but yet what he done it from the appear to me of love he's warning those people who can be affected by this man and dr. fees was a businessman if your study history who had a big sway among those message people so John saw it fit to call this man's name and make a public example out of this man don't get scared now I'm gonna do that to nobody it's just the word just say a mentor now what's this Jesus gives us this new commandment as it is identified now once let's look back again in verse 14 of first John we know that we have passed from death unto life so death and life are represented as two distinct territories and kingdoms or States they are in other words they are dominions or kingdoms that are separated and each of them have their boundaries each of them have their guidelines each of them have their king or the one who is the rule of them now notice the way words is we know that we have passed from death unto life now passed from is a word that means passing from one form of government to another it was used of a transition from one place to another and it's the same root word that is used to migrate so you have migrated from one Dominion to another now this is not something that you can do on your own not something that you can be trained into or school into come on you cannot grow into being born again you will grow after you're born again but we cannot teach people how to grow into the new birth at this church it is a supernatural act by God and it can only be given by God himself there is no preacher no pastor nobody else they can give you the new verse because we are born by the will of God at the time of God by the breath of God for the purpose of God glory to God hallelujah now notice John is making this so sure for the first century Christians and we believe not only them but for those of us as well on this day we know that we have passed from one Dominion or from one Kingdom or we are migrated from from a kingdom that was of darkness and of the world and we have migrated and been moved over into a kingdom of life now this is the way we know that this has happened we know we have passed from death unto life because we believe cerfancy we believe women can preach we don't believe that there's an eternal hell we believe women all have long hair long dresses we believe all of that that's not the test but here the evidence that was set forth by this disciple of love was that we loved one you said that's one of these things there is I beg your pardon this is absolutely impossible without a new birth Laurey payment I believe better BAM I believe brother BAM oh yeah sure we've had thousands of bleep other bands how to call him a devil well glory now what's we know that we have passed from death unto libel of the brother so here is the mark of discipleship or the mark of distinction or the reality of the token in life form now people can say by words by logos I love you brother I love you brother I love you sister oh I love I love I love but for those words have become Rhema words in their life displayed in an action it's a total different saying now the first part of course of John 3:16 is God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son so God loved that's word then God gave now that's that word in action so you for us to be able to love continuously especially people that will trespass against us over and over again or somebody that clashes with your makeup and for you to still love them as if though you love the Lord Jesus because it is him in them if they're born again that takes the Spirit of God to help us to do it we can't do it preachers included no one since so we are changed from a Kanis corrupt nature to a born-again nature so instead of desiring to take our brother's life we would give my life for our brother's life what's this in Ephesians 1:13 and whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of the truth the gospel of your salvation in whom after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession a notice is now unto the praise of his glory wherefore I also add to that a heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints now notice here appalled is time one true identification of the Holy Ghost in the lives of these Saints that have moved into a world of inheritance of light is that they love all the saints they don't just love Saints that agree with them they don't just love Saints they go on with their doctrine or they get their tapes or stream their services but they love all the saints now notice hair is not mentioned dress is not mentioned hold and say because you believe I'm a prophet of God that's not it because remember the Galatians believe that and then they had turned against Paul but Paul said if you've got this if you love All Saints even those that read you the wrong way you've got to be born again my what an identification notice again it cautions one for since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which he have to all the saints now this is what the Apostolic Church believed that Holy Ghost fell people loved All Saints can you imagine now the Ephesians Saints loving the Corinthian Saints when the Ephesians Saints were one of the deeper churches in the message and the Corinthian church was a very Pentecostal church but if the Ephesians really had the Holy Ghost they loved the Corinthians I remember the Corinthians come to the communion table and got drunk on excess wine well glory the Corinthians was the one who allowed this man to live with his father's wife his stepmother and commit fornication with her true this is the Bible the Corinthians is the one who emphasized so much on the gift the Galatian Church had no problem let's get the Church of Thessalonica the Church of Laodicea all these other churches but if they had the Holy Ghost they would love the faults of the Laodicean people they look beyond their faults and they said you know what I hate sin but I love the sinners I hate their wrongdoings but I love them with all of my heart and they are my brothers and my sisters unlike us message folks of course which pick and choose which ones we love I tell my fellowship now I'm telling my which ones we love well Gloria I want another witness brother Donny good I got one Philemon chapter 1 verse 5 hearing of thy love and take what's ours toward the Lord Jesus and toward All Saints notice how Paul merges this now that the new burst whenever he writes about their faith in the Lord Jesus Ephesians one fifteenth and larger the Saints cautions one for since we're heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and love which head toward the saints Philemon 1:5 hearing the died 11 faithful Southwest toward the Lord Jesus and toward All Saints you cannot separate it you cannot love God with all of your heart and hate anyone especially the body of Christ why because God has so made this love in the New Testament it is inseparable to hate me is to hate God can you see how people are in the message are so bad and so pitiful that they hate one another they hate people around the message and say they love God with all their heart they're liars murderers well praise the Lord oh man the Brethren must be loved because the likeness of God is in their souls by the new birth you don't love the thought you don't other shortcomings you don't love their failures you don't love their human crisis and you have but you love the image the image of God if God himself would choose to endure all that brothers sister loved them for that sake you might not care for all they shout him that's a screen tonight tell us nothing to do with it you're looking at the outside you can see us that person loved God and they're truly born again then in them it's the same image of God that's in you Oh hallelujah you see this is one reason why one of the many reasons why the Lord established a local body a church that people should attend because in there we come to feed and rejoicing by all those sort of things but it's not just for that reason only we come to church to be crossed for folks who stay home all the time now realize there's folks in certain conditions you know they live in the middle of nowhere ain't got no church to go to and they stream these services and I feel sorry for most of the ones I hear from don't want to be there they won't have your pew as a matter of fact they don't understand why you don't come to church when you can they're envious of your opportunity to come here well I'm just telling you the truth and being honest but yet God will somehow supplement those people and take care of them but you realize that we need we need as human beings not only to be rubbed in the right way but sometimes rubbed the wrong way because it's when we rub the wrong way that shows us our shortcomings it's noble and three people are giving us great Caprice of accolades oh you're so good by the gym you're just the next thing to an angel as it'll end if you think that all the tributes just the sweetest first I've ever seen in my life and all - hey it's just getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger so God will send somebody now brother Jim I don't know why do you and he feels like taking that finger and that thumb and pinch in their head - a head shrinker size number don't tell me I made that up he just said that's true [Applause] [Laughter] but you see the people who praise OpenSim you doing such a great job such a wonderful job it's not them people that would check by the Jim's oil and but it's those that would clash with you mom they're preachers and the message and all they love praise they love to be bragged on but they can't stand it if anybody questions one principle of something they preach well go around it's part of our development to being Christians and you lived in the first century which one of the churches that I just mentioned will you'd went to I'll tell you let me look at your makeup and I'll tell you if you'd had the choice some you don't want to Corinth no question about it some of you are alert to the Ephesian Church because you deem yourself theologians you considered yourself so deep you never went to that collation sir why they questioned the prophet of God I wouldn't sell believers but all of them and if you had the Holy Ghost you get all of them you might not have understood how they listen to some liar to try to tell you the poleward a prophet of God but you love them anyhow right so which church would you went to and yet Paul said these with the Holy Ghost loved all the Saints you imagine if they ever had fellowship means and you got a Christian believer sent my son and Ephesian believer that Corinthian believers just bouncing off the peace Oh glory to cut that deep Ephesian theologians Oh God I see the devil got on me to set by you I definitely wouldn't letter the Lord to sit on the same hue you said on I must have been strictly in the flesh and then a Galatian believer over here and I thought that's all I could believe her over there but all of those that have the Holy Ghost and Ephesian believer we've been able to go up and grab the hand of a Quentin believer if it is Stood Still OH&S huh hit him on over and grab the hold of his head and put his arm around his brother god bless him see you some other time not us we ignore them stay away from them because we don't like them now remember hatred friends you can't go by your definition of hatred hatred is just several degrees farther than dislike it's a detestable dislike that you have for an individual if God were to weigh us out in this building tonight or in this message I wonder how much hatred would be all inside the ranks of this message or inside this church well the longer I go the quarter you get and the quarter you get the longer I'm going [Applause] now notice Jonah again says we know that we have passed from death unto life now because we love the Brethren now this is not the cause of passing from death unto life but this is the effect when I deal with people and I counsel people I try to point them I look at three points of issues in their life calls effect and cure I found out their many years of experience and when they've got issues and problems if you can come to those three things and many of the things that will be resolved of cause and effect and a cure we know the cure most of the time is God's Word and what contains in the volumes of God's Word but what gets tricky is that you go to take the killer and Satan will try to make people apply the cure to the effect and not apply it to the cause so you apply the cure to the effect and it brings almost instantaneous but temporary reprieve and they feel better oh not everything's gonna be fine praise God all I know it is I know it is and Satan knows as well that applying the cure to the effect will only bring temporary relief but the cause is still there now the reason we love our brothers is the effect of a new life which is divine life we could not love our brothers in order to get the new verse we had to happen their birth in order to love them all because we love the Brethren you see those who think it's separable or still under the anointing of Cain Cain loved and remember his hatred was formed in church as him and Abel bowls are in the house of God building an altar murder is burst under the auspices of hatred oh man we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the Brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death so no matter how much he thinks he's passed over from the Dominion of Satan into the Dominion of God if he loves not a half a dozen and then hates only one if he loves thousands and thousands and thousands of God's children but there's one that he absolutely hates he's no truly boolean there's no high fiber new verse there's no 3/4 they're both either you are or you aren't praise the Lord Oh Lord Jesus now let's look at this together if you wouldn't let's see how many just look at a few places in the scripture how that it refers to this idea of one another in this new formation of the mystical body you see Christian love is to be a practical thing something that God won't supply every day of our life in st. John 13 14 we are to wash one another's feet Romans 12:10 were to prefer one another Romans 12:16 be of the same man one to another Romans 14 13 do not judge one another Romans 15 7 receive one another Romans 15 14 admonish one another first Thessalonians 5:11 either 5 which is build up build up one another I trust we're all guilty of these place a lot I trust we're all guilty of these so far Galatians 5:13 by love serve one another Galatians 6:2 bear one another's burdens Ephesians 14 forbearing one another in love if he sins for 32 forgiving one another for sicilus 14 comfort one another so shillings 5:11 edify one another Hebrews 10:24 let us consider which is understand one another James 5:16 confess your faults one to another first Peter 4 not use hospitality one to another in short summing these brief things together can't you see how this body is going to be unlike any let's have a bit on the earth the channel of this who could never produce this Jeremiah a godly holy man could not produce David a man after God's own heart but David couldn't love this way David hated people that was his disposition right he hated them well glory David couldn't laugh this way Solomon couldn't love this one ICQ couldn't love this what Moses couldn't love this one he got so mad really this could only be introduced in the New Covenant one another one another one another one another one another oh Jesus oh ma look at Jesus words again in the Saints on 59 as the father hath loved me so have I loved you continue ye in my love if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love even as I've kept my father's Commandments and abide in his own now what's this this is not like an option this is a command this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you as even when they don't deserve it with the same affection how many times shall I forgive my brother Lord in a day seven times Peter went beyond their all realms of eternity did he he stretched himself plumb out past the horizontal rainbow and thinking men a lot if I force a seven Jesus will think I'm the greatest apostle there is in the world Jesus boat him plumb out of the water you imagine when Jesus got down with seventy times seven pole Peter writes they woke him up you know I actually passed out over there and said are you kidding me this must be I'm in a coma there's no way she said 490 times in the same day by the same man there ain't no way don't he know I've got a bad temper I'll rip his head off there ain't no way in a world I can do that in Jesus knew that at that time Peter could not do it but I guarantee you one thing Peter got to a place he could do it why because the divine life any man moved into Peter Peter at this time had not moved from the kingdom of darkness he was on his way but he had not been translated into the kingdom of his dear son yet look at the epitome of greater love verse 13 greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends no higher expression of love could ever be attained that a person would lay down their life for his friends notice in Romans 5:6 for when we were yet but that strength in due time Christ died for scarcely will a righteous man died yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die but God commendeth his love toward us and then while we were yet sinners Christ died for us nay don't raise your head but many of us would have a struggle really a struggle to die for a brother could any of us die for a sinner the things going to kill somebody in this building tonight a sinner or Saint and then it would raise your hand as Christians I'm ready to go but that sinner live he might get saved in the morning would find that real quick how selfishness pervades our lives and then we wonder why this don't need to be preached oh my but God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us st. John 15:14 again you are my friends if you do whatsoever I commend you so then he tells them he would reckon them as intimate close friends as long as they obeyed his word now we know there are degrees of kinship and friendship by which the church and the bride is greatly divided 144,000 those who live on the outside of the city and we know only those that are obedient to the command of God and Jesus knew and he was send this this is only allocated to a certain category of people everybody cannot eat us can God demand this of the foolish virgin absolutely impossible they cannot do it why they're not truly born again are they on the way to salvation yes have they accepted Christ as their Savior yes but not as their King and Lord he does not set upon the throne of the heart and dominate their passions her motives their objectives but in they let's art he sets their love and God demands this of us this is not something an option as I say apparel windows but this is some we are they like to go God will not settle until dis is manifested in the heart of every let believer around the world this is the capstone we've screamed about it we've heard about it was shouted about it for years we knew Michelle DiNozzo Harvey Oh notice this in first young 215 love not the world neither the things that are in the world now remember this is not contrary to John 3:16 for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son so it's used in a different sense so we look at the word world God loved the world but he tells us love not the world which is the world order or the cosmos he says neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him God doesn't say that it's not accepted Christ as Savior but if he loves the world the love of God cannot be water under two head ships light is under one darkness is under other love is on one side hate is on the other the love for the world is on this side and the love for God is on this side you can hear both you can't love God and the world and say Oh hallelujah I'm a consecrated Christian totally impossible you cannot love God and hates your brother totally impossible you cannot be walking in light and walking in darkness at the same time totally impossible James says it this way chapter 1 verse 27 period religion and undefiled before God and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world James 4:4 yield alters and adulteresses know ye not that friendship of the world is enmity with God whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy God well praise the Lord notice the wordfriends filos which is what we get to record figlio to be friendly to one wish him well an associate one who associates familiar with one a companion so that a person cannot love the world all the things that don't get in your mind cigarettes now don't get in your mind pornography don't get in your mind I'm talking about the world everything in the world which is hate and gossip and lie just as much as smoking first John 5:19 we know that we are of God and the whole world lieth and wickedness the whole world lies and wickedness so worldliness is not just so much a matter of activity as it is of attitude you know said a woman can have long hair in a long dress and my never have one better eyeshadow or makeup or none esta and be as a world in her heart as she can be because she's nothing but a gossiper said the whole church she just carries trash from one to another to another keeps one big mass going and well glory to God preach it brother Donna some preachers are the same one some preachers of the worst Gospels you ever didn't listen your life preach Valley Donnie oh you see well in this not only affects your your response to the love but it affects your attitude and how you love that while in this is what keeps us from loving those who hate us you look at it as a weakness it's not a weakness at all its worldliness oh it burns us message folks know why cuz we got worldliness in a little box so tell me what - cigar was it that Eve smoked in the gardening huh what what brand of television denieth have was a dizziness or Magnavox or a sharper which part was it that she did sit we should fail this she cut her hair he's held on short - she didn't have on her - okay well you own them down the street gossiping there were nobody to gossip - do you believe she fell in wildness huh decaying falling - yes don't you see what Satan's done to us we think we are free from worldliness because all of our sisters and our brothers don't go you know until the year that will give you pornography and we fake weddings zoom from worldliness and in our heart we hate you see when a believer really loses his enjoyment of Father's love he finds it very difficult to keep God's word he finds it very hard to forgive those who trespass against him well not the world neither the things of the world if a man love the world the love of the father is not in him that doesn't say that God doesn't love him but the personal baptism of the love of the father is not in him notice this in first John chapter 3 verse 11 for this is the message that you have heard from the beginning that we should love one another now he assures him upon this precept is the divine seal of the new light now he's going to go into this a little bit more for he says this is the message that you've heard from the beginning that we should love one another so the word of God is a message from God sent to us to tell us what we need to do to leave this world right to sin as to what we need to do how to behave ourselves why we're here and the preparation necessary in order to leave this well as we looked at it Wednesday night that the bridegroom would always send the bride the wedding dress that she needed the bride didn't go downtown on the Jewish marriage and pick out which one she wanted but actually the bridegroom sent to her the dress now the very sign that she needed a dress was reflected in that he sent it to her if she already had one he didn't need to send her one so when you hear things like this they cut you and really all my really make us feel bad remember it's the bridegroom looking at your needs looking at my need and saying I need this so he has a messenger that messenger knocks on your door and delivers this package to you and it's a perfect fit oh don't look at that that God don't love you don't look at that the gods have to get you or the preachers out to get you it's the love of God to you it shows that you needed that so the bridegroom would send the friend of the bridegroom down to the house and he was having his arms are in a package and what was that it was the ornaments for the bride it was the dress for the bride that she did not take that oh he don't love it oh he hates me she said all he loves me he loves me yes he loves me he sent me the wedding garment oh I hear brother them say I hope that God will crown my ministry with this that he will let me take the calls of the world and dress his bride here real women around this message from the your brother Ben blast about things of ungodliness they don't take as an insult they take it as more clothes hallelujah that God sent them a love message wrapped up in a box praise on the horn hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus look what the word message means an announcement something good not a mere command as the law but an announcement so God sent brother Branham with several announcements and the announcements are still going on now watch in verse 12 not as Cain who was of that wicked one let me read you this from Jean Gil who was of the wicked one Satan he was a child of his an imitator of him one that appeared to be under his influence to belong to him so that you say of Cain that he was on the side of the serpent now I thought we were the only strange ones that believed serpents II but John Gill and some of these other men were going to read you about tonight that wrote back in the 1500s and the 1600s and the 1700s believe the strange thing and John who lived back 2,000 years ago said the cane was of the devil [Applause] praise the Lord all night so that you say have came that he was of the side of the serpent had all serpent the devil that old serpent the devil as the way of the serpent is destroy him to kill so Cain immediately became a murderer and again because Cain came from the side of the Angel of Death he slew his brother listen to this from the Bible exposition commentary Cain is an example of a life of hatred Cain is not presented as an atheist he is presented as a worshipper and this is the point children of the devil masquerade as true believers they attend religious gatherings as Cain did they may even bring offerings but these actions in themselves are not valid proof that a man is born of God the real test in his love is for the Brethren where Cain failed every man has a spiritual lineage as well as a physical cane spiritual father wilds the devil Kane's attitudes and actions originated with Satan Cain was a murderer and a liar like Satan was st. John 8:44 he murdered his brother and then he lied about it now lie didn't leave commentaries but left us quotes ever remember Cain wasn't an infidel Cain was a believer this is going to shake the gizzard out of you so if you got a gizzard in you to nod I guess this posts gonna shake it out to hope it does because only chickens got gizzards you know evening Eagles don't have gizzards I guess I hope that does some of you found a mentalist and put a heart in you that's right a hard to believe Cain was religious and a believer he came up and built an altar to the Lord with just as much face that's what Abel did I want to watch want you to watch something god it's just so you believe that audience he is absolutely just enough God on a requires of religion Cain was just as just as Abel was both those boys came before God Cain wasn't a communist he wasn't an infidel an unbeliever he was a believer if God only requires a believer people son jessa condemned came I wonder how many around the message and what have we call him the same thing Cain was called believers [Applause] why we substitute believers from being born again if you've got the Holy Ghost if you got the Holy Ghost why because people can say more positive yes I'm a believer yes I'm a believer but pinpoint him are you born again you go on I don't know our whole part you know why don't you see what it is it's easier to say well I'm a believer I follow the message ah brother darling should good man I'm a believer I'm a believer all the train could say exactly the same thing I want to say more than came to say came to say I'm a believer he could say I'm sincere I'm a worshiper I love God I want to say more than that I want to say that too I want to say I'm a believer I'm a worshiper I'm sincere but I want to say I'm born of God I passed from death unto life and one way I know is I don't want to murder anybody [Applause] the sermon entitled why I'm a Holy Roller now this is gonna make you tighten up your ecclesiastical vest a little bit I love brother benhams Bob Jones terminology don't you know a professor of theology that went through all these great things and God oh man notice God cannot be just if you say I'm a believer so was Cain and so is the devil that's right he came as a believer and you said well I go to church I go to the altar so he came came built an altar or a church unto the Lord yes I'm a member of the church so is Cain and King made a sacrifice you say I pay so much every year and I'm not sure Saudi came I worship the Lord from the bottom of my heart Saudi Cain Cain was a believer a worshipper just as fundamentally right as Abel was Amen all I love this I pray God steam our hearts I mean what's your heart steamed to that now you realize steam has to come from a high intensity of heat and water so if the word is here washing us by the water of the word we got enough water here if we can get enough heat generating it up then it will produce steam then our hearts are be steamed what disdain dude gets wrinkles out Holy Ghost come again at night and steam the wrinkles out of our lives [Applause] now it says don't get excited I know where I am I feel kind of religious right now ain't that strange that here feel religious talking about the Serpent's ooh and now to make you feel religious if you talk about and it hits your heart that you ain't that that ought to make you feel pretty religious gotta go there father Cain was a believer get on your shot proof vest now Cain was a believer in a worshiper of God and if God owned a record a believer came as just as just as Abel was and God would be unjust if he condemned came for his faith in him and accepted Abel if faith was wholly required all right but Cain came and offered a sacrifice no no it came built an altar a church he made a sacrifice it's the same as Abel did Cain worshipped he never come as an unbeliever he come as a believer raised up his hands and worship God just the same as Abel death what a church membership an altar a worship sacrifices all God requires then Cain was as just as Abel was so he's fundamentally since series of worship Rize believer all of those things what's the problem what's the problem question answers on Hebrews now let's take back to Cain could you tell me where that spirit and that meanness come from now what's this I realize many folks in the message purchase with some still don't understand this it amazes me absolutely amazes me because they think after the fall that Adam became a murder and after the fall that Adam was full of meanness that is not true Adam lost the holy image of God but Adam did not become these things are here there was still a holy strain on the earth two separate seed lives that's why Genesis six was a necessity for Satan to accomplish what he needed to accomplish what's better bail now and asking this question where did this meanness come from look at King if if Cain was the son of Adam which was the son of God Lord that evil come from give me to tell me that he is still attributing the lineage of Adam as being a son of God after the fall he was a fallen son of God but he was still the son of God nonetheless and whether or not you understand he was a following the son of garbage had been restored why do you say God put clothes on Adam and Eve where did God get that anomie went over on a hill what was that animal used for to fold that animal was offered as a sacrifice as a Natoma and his skin was used as a redemptive act to cover their nakedness crying a god so Adam was restored not to the garden of either but to his position to where he's able to still talk to God you don't find him a tree was close again going hiding in the bushes anymore do you sighing run said I was afraid why God night away for Adam to come back no us brother Ben said the first thing when he was born he hated it was a murderer he was jealous now what's he showing us the contrast between Abel so Abel was born out to the fall and yet Abel did not hate nor was able jealous nor was able to murder now well to the store send him we know this service now gun into my desk so the Spirit of God spoke these words to me Abel could have never kills Cain for he was born in the nature can't you see what people can kill you but what do you do pray for them why it's not in you to murder it's not in you to run them down and try to learn their character now notice take the nature of his daddy diverse start at the beginning Lucifer in the beginning he was jealous of Michael that's what started the whole trouble how many knows that and Cain was the nature of his father Satan physically physically was not his father I told you before Cain had two daddies one that was a daddy of his body and one was a daddy of his nature hold on so did you your essay father was the father of your body tell me now what makes you hate tell me what to kept some of you from being a murderer well where did you get that where did you get this to be like a look at Moses a prophet of God of Mara Dyer or do you get that nature because the nature become mixed after Genesis 6 don't you understand our children coming to message church the center tonight with that same thing in them unless they get to Holy Ghost we can't just leave them to the message we just can't make them believers they got to be born again got eyes on your nature now what's this came was the nature of his father which he was jealous of his brother and slew him now listen carefully you are you a better man if you won't do that that nature could not have come out of that pure seed after the fall that seed was still pure after the fall do you understand if Genesis 6 had never accomplished there would still be two seeds on the earth today there would be a pure seed and a polluted Seif but Satan wanted to try them the sons of God must marry into the daughters of men and cross the Sigma and by the way everyone born after that time they would have the same nature this is why we had to be born at our body st. serpent see my skin a serpent see but look at you you were a nature of the devil just not the rest of the world was oh but God put a deposit down in your soul that representation of eternal life Paul said we work by nature children of Wrath even as others while the folks found that so hard to believe that nature could not come out of that pierc'd it had to come out of this perverted stream and notice cane as soon as he was born and the neighbor was born after that she can see by Adam knew her and she brought forth her son Abel Abel was a type of Christ and when Abel was killed Seth took his place death burial resurrection of Christ and the time but now Cain worshipped all of his carnivores just help the church today they go to church they worship Cain worship he wasn't an infidel he wasn't a communist Cain was a believer he went to God he built an altar he done every religious thing they labeled up but he didn't have the spiritual revelation of the will of God now what's God foreshadowing the eighth day even though Cain did not have the revelation God was not obligated to give it to him he's obligated to his own and this one was not his own but God said if you would at least do like your brother I'll accept you what is it a type of those that will come out on the outside of the city they'll never have the revelation the broad scoff they'll never have that understand that the bride Scott but some of them will go to church and they'll do everything they know to do and then accept Christ as our Savior and they will be golden allowed to go into eternal life and Cain God would have accepted him but he was so stubborn hold on to your seats now God still loved him even though he was seed of the serpent well the lemon said don't you see it he didn't have the spiritual revelation that's awesome at the church today Jesus said he's built his church on that spiritual revelation you get it all now your eyes come open and see the spiritual revelation cane combi built an altar II worshiped about sacrifice nailed down praise God worship God then everything religious enabled and God flatly refused him because it didn't have the spiritual revelation Cain wanted to be religious so in women made his own religion and when he did he brought it before God was something like this here's the best of God this is all I can do about it take it or leave it that's about the way man there's today's and I'll help build the church I sent my children to church I'll put money in it every year that's the best I can do take it or leave it Oh see he wants his way that's the way Cain dad but look at grace but God still loved him and he still went after him [Applause] but is that the attitude we have God loves the sinner but hates the sin so to keep from getting our hands dirty we hate the sinner and the sand so we throw the baby out with the bathwater by the way there's no risk of us being contaminated you Pharisee you mean to tell me here is a hybrid a man that is half serpent and half human not even gone the book God's not obligated by any means to even reach out time but God looked at him with a Jim and he loved him Amazing Grace how sweet the sound so what do you see when you look upon humanity you see them dressing like who knows what you see them you know live in the way they are and do you look at them with love or do you like I'm blessed God they deserve to burn up they deserve yep sound like you're in the message all right that's the same attitude the prophet hadn't that little restaurant know hi God why don't you destroy this place God why don't you mean man my kids have got a he said I will tell you something [Applause] sir cause of that you remember the vision it's in the world spinning around the scenes coming up hitting Jesus in the face Lord is that the sins of the world it's the sin of the world then he seen Jesus taking right his finger on his book pardon said I forgive you that's the sins of the world Lord no limbs yours but I forgive you but you want to condemn her come on children how much easier is it and we're like John Lord do you want us to call fire down that heaven this time that was an evil spirit on John and yet that evil spirit went to the word Locke Elijah done but God looked at this mongrel this mongrel - a serpent and God looked at him with pity and maybe in the way we'd would think it poor sang look at his daddy okay poor guy and got a fight his hands so God want to have to rinse in look I didn't reveal it to you the way I did to him but if you will just do as he does except you just still what he does but there he was in church and he got hatred is the birthing canal notice whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her in his heart okay so adultery can be committed with a woman and never touch her physically you agree with it you can be a murderer in your heart because you pull this hatred you just never carried out you just never actually pull the trigger stab somebody beat him with a club or the rock or whatever but he know what the potential is there this is my information I will hate no makes no difference what color they are makes no difference how big they are how little they are their ethnic background the racial whatever more what they believe even if they hate me I refuse to be brought down to that level I will hate let us come back to our title love the evidence of life love the evidence of life how can you love as a human because you have life right can this pulpit love they can't love I'll bet this microphone handkerchief Bible Gatorade tree organ it's no life can you love without life neither can we love divinely will cut the new life but brother Donnie if I'm born again I've got the Holy Ghost does that mean I'll never feel that oh no no no no according to your makeup and your nature if you hated real bad in the world you may have more potential than others to hate and this ain't born again yet and Satan may attack you and he may bother you but the King Basilio the king and sound of your heart says out of here devil ain't no room for hatred in his heart your old flesh may try to ditch a second any other temptation but you fight it off and keep before you it is beneath me to act like King I am NOT King I am able [Music] spout hits again if you win Lord Jesus righteous God I'll pray that should help each of us present those that are hearing this service or hear it later Lord God we desire this Avenue of love I've not always had it Lord for sure all of these would be honest they'll say the same way I was born in San and by nature I was a child of Wrath even as Heather's that's why we would get out and drink for those of us who did that and run around and commit adultery and think was having a big old time because our nature our nature oh but I'm so glad that you already had a plan laid before the foundation of the world if it was not for your plan there'd be no hope for any mortals to ever be saved after that mixture of Genesis 6 because what we see in that separate seed line before Genesis 6 murders polygamist bigamist liars city builders all that sort of thing after Genesis 6 we see it merging even over into the righteous so then there's no longer a pure stream David a man after your own heart yet David had your eye murdered commit adultery sheep the different things that he does the different ones we could mention how could they do that how could they act like Cain because the nature became crossed that's wife to the flood it was not necessary for Satan to find another woman and to find another serpent and to try to pregnant another woman to start another seed line the nature had now been crossed he didn't need a separate seed line in the flesh he had accomplished what he wanted the nature was now polluted so every mortal born thereafter would come to the earth with this nature so I'd see a Jacob and an e saw the one that would be natured one way one natured another come from the same mother and same father we see it too den our own families kids that we raised in the message and teach them the Word of God and they set there for years and years and heaven experience and go right on with God Lord some of these know they're experiencing with their children right now professed agnostics / deaf professed infidels don't even believe in God kids around this message to cut their teeth and message pews as we say not even sure there is a God much less that there's a prophet so we see Lord the nature is still here there's not a literal serpent seed in that sense but the nature is here and to think when I was born as a little baby boy I had that nature in me nature to lie the potential to murder to hate to destroy to be an adulterer all that laid in me but I'm so glad early that morning Lord God that little shack I was born on beside that gravel road of course I don't remember it but mom and daddy telling me that there was holes in the walls cats and dogs going out of the house didn't have to use the door because the board's just run off the house but it wasn't a dog could come in that day and when the cat but somehow neither my mama must have started getting real sweet and she's a sweet woman anyway but she must have started getting sweeter before I was born cause it's a little angel hallelujah my representation when I took the breath of life that day glory to God a representation when in thank you no God nor at the age of 12 or started something pulling on me pulling on me I'm grateful Lord I'm so grateful now went and got saved as we call it then Lord they started teaching about the Holy Ghost so I went and prayed for that I prayed and I prayed you remember that Sunday my Lord and I started speaking in tongues and I spoke in tongues through the rest of the service spoke in tongues after church daddy picked me up packed me out in the car and laid him in the seat I spoke in tongues all the way home laid me on the couch I'm still speaking in tongues Philip in the morning I thought I got the new birth but come to find out there was a Malachi 4 word burst that was waiting for me on down the road journeys been long it's been hazardous and dangerous but Lord God I thank you for where you brought me there not Lord I was born with the nature of children of Wrath oh but I'm so glad I got reborn again Lord Alleluia keep me from anything Lord this is not like you help me to love my brothers you know I've got many enemies around the world not that I want any but many people hate me they'd kill me if they could the Lord keep me above that keep me where I have no animosity in my heart toward anyone please Jesus help us to see this is the way we know we have passed from death unto life the brothers help me Lord Jesus as I mentioned a couple weeks ago I could lay down my life I could lay down my life if need be not for those that agree with me but for the man in this message that wouldn't even speak to me or wouldn't even shake my hand because it feel contaminated help me to love so deeply but I can lay down my life Ram I see through these things Lord I've got some growing some maturing I need to do but I thank you for ringing my doorbell as it were and delivering this box personally to me because it shows I'm included in the rapture and you want me to be fully clothed fully dressed washed and loosed Lord God for me anything but son like you Lord maybe not take these things in a negative way and just be discouraged and down but may we take this personal delivery of these things write to our address as personal attention from the bridegroom we love you Jesus hallelujah hallelujah I take the package from the delivery man I open it up I run my fingers down the material the cloths of the word and I say to you tonight thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord for speaking words that may cut me thank you Lord for speaking words that I have to repent but it's the cost of the word to make me ready praise God I thank you for it Lord God oh I want to set as the king's daughter as we looked at it in Psalms 45 there the man the king's daughter arrayed and fine needlework the daughter set beside her with the rock gold of Ophir and the king looks over at her and he delights in her beauty o Great King would you pass by this place tonight hallelujah may you find our souls our nature attractive to you O God may you be attracted to us because of the change in our nature we were not lovable before this happened to us you would have found us repulsive we were rapt in seeing our nature was not lovable but our husband died and you couldn't marry a divorced woman so you give us a new birth and when our new virgin were Newbridge so I had that old marriage never even exists in the mind of God so we're born again now you find us attractive it's that part of yourself and us that you see and know we are compatible for we were given that compatibility before the foundation of the world or the predestinated the merited grace of God you slip that wedding man on a fingertip Lord Jesus glory to God Oh hallelujah praise the Lord Jesus can we just raise our hands and his presidency Oh children open your package don't get angry at the messenger don't get upset at the FedEx guy or the UPS guy whichever one you want to call me don't get angry at me because I delivered to you know get angry at God it shows his love so if you open it up and here's this and this and this and this that shows he knows you needed that and he's interested in you and he loves you he loves you and you have found favor in his eyes Esther he spread his garment over you Ruth Alleluia he has espoused you to himself and he will present you to himself as a chaste virgin without spot or wrinkle or any such thing Oh hallelujah Lord God Adonai we worship you tonight oh Jesus I still don't understand how you did it Lord I don't know how you took that old vile nature out of me Lord I can see what the Reagan's could be and the shouts I could see the potential maybe some of these people look at their own family trains that Oh God the potential that laid in me to be all of that but somehow you got to me lord thank you thank you instead of my a book been written about may have been a gangster or a mafia or a robbed this person or I killed that person or I've done this there's another book wrote mercy rewrote my life alleluia alleluia Lord Jesus we lift up holy hands o God we lift up holy hands and rejoice in your presence Lord
