[28:17] so we're gonna puree this thing up
[28:21] tonight it's open but if you have your
[28:24] Bibles go ahead and go to the word
[28:35] last couple of weeks to three weeks ago
[28:38] I'd started studying on the subject that
[28:40] I entitled blaming God and I won brother
[28:46] Donnie you asked me a couple days ago
[28:47] and on a couple weeks ago so I didn't
[28:49] get a whole lot of notice I just I did a
[28:52] youth service here Monday night and
[28:56] before I go any further let me tell you
[28:59] parents are the most blessed people to
[29:06] see you young people sitting here the
[29:07] way they did Monday night
[29:09] oh just pull it out of you it was
[29:15] wonderful it any any minister in this
[29:19] age would have enjoyed the preach in
[29:20] front of him but I had to stop better
[29:27] I'm gonna be a mess here a minute so I
[29:32] had this thought that I gave brought to
[29:34] him it's called the battles not yours
[29:36] and their Lord just kept I had about
[29:40] four pages of notes result Monday night
[29:42] it was a pretty simple subject but I've
[29:45] actually pulled more out of me than I
[29:47] had and so I continued to study on it
[29:52] this week and I'd like to to bring that
[29:56] to you tonight if you don't mind if
[29:58] you've got your Bibles you can turn to
[30:00] 2nd chronicles 2013 and 7 brother Brad
[30:04] Ewing's sister Sarah and forgive me
[30:06] you're gonna hear some of the kind of
[30:08] background on what we talked about
[30:09] Monday and all Judas stood before the
[30:17] Lord with their little ones their wives
[30:19] and their children then upon Joe hey zo
[30:22] the son of Zechariah the son had been an
[30:24] eye of the son of JL the son of
[30:27] mattaniah
[30:28] a Levite they didn't say was a prophet
[30:31] they said he was a Levite he was a
[30:32] minister this was this man was a
[30:34] minister not a prophet came the Spirit
[30:39] of the Lord in the midst of the
[30:40] congregation and he said hearken ye all
[30:44] Judah ye inhabitants of Jerusalem now
[30:46] King Jehoshaphat

[31:36] opportunity Lord I know I'm nervous Lord
[31:39] I'm all the pieces standing here father
[31:41] but it's not about me and about how I
[31:43] feel
[31:43] Lord it's about you feeding your bride
[31:45] it's about you telling your your bride
[31:47] Lord how you feel about her things that
[31:49] you wanted to know for all the things
[31:51] that'll make your better maker stronger
[31:52] make her closer to you father it's about
[31:54] you tonight Lord so Lord we bring this
[31:57] to you tonight Lord we ask you to get us
[31:59] out of the way set us aside Lord as the
[32:02] word comes forth from this vessel Lord I
[32:04] need things in my life too I need a
[32:06] stronger walk everyone here does Lord
[32:07] we're not exempt from from you giving us
[32:10] strength in our lives father I pray this
[32:12] you anoint the word anoint it ears to
[32:15] hear Lord and we welcome you have your
[32:17] way tonight in Jesus name amen you can
[32:19] be seated
[32:25] I'm going to give a little testimony
[32:27] here why this particular subject is
[32:32] means so much to me in each one of you
[32:36] could you have your own testimony a
[32:39] couple years ago church was going
[32:44] through some things here but the Jimmy
[32:47] and bad brothers you may hope it's
[32:49] alright brother Jimmy brother Donny
[32:51] probably got the brunt of it more than
[32:53] anybody and I was I was at work one day
[32:57] and you ever feel the urge to do
[33:01] something to the point that very few
[33:05] things in my life that I have felt like
[33:07] the Lord just grabbed my shirt collar
[33:08] and pulled me to do something and this
[33:10] was one of them I think the Lord didn't
[33:14] tell me in the audible voice but Lord
[33:16] spoken my heart said go pray with
[33:18] brother Jimmy so I come up here brother
[33:24] Jimmy was the only one in the library at
[33:25] the time and I told him I said whether
[33:30] Jimmy I I've got to pray with you
[33:34] Lord's telling me to pray with you so we
[33:38] got to battle daily brothers Jimmy and
[33:41] we prayed and you say brother Joe did
[33:47] the problem go away I have no idea I
[33:50] never had a burden with for again from
[33:52] that day I never had another burden for
[33:54] that the Lord lifted that weight off of
[33:56] me and it just said something and you'll
[34:02] to see me when I'm in the libraries
[34:04] sometimes I call brother Jimmy a winner
[34:06] winner's circle is pretty great in it
[34:08] but Jimmy that's where every one of us
[34:12] should be tonight in the winner's circle
[34:14] as Jehoshaphat hears is getting ready
[34:18] going this battle this particular
[34:20] scripture in the bible has happened to
[34:24] every single child of God this is a part
[34:28] of your life and you come in here on
[34:33] Wednesdays and Saturdays and Sundays and
[34:36] jahaziel stands up here and tells you
[34:39] the battle is not yours so Jay hey zo
[34:44] brought a sermon to Jehoshaphat and
[34:47] Judah that day that's he titled that the
[34:50] battles not yours
[34:51] and so coincidentally that's the title
[34:54] of my sermon so I'm not the first one to
[34:58] preach this so if we can background for
[35:03] a little bit on Jehoshaphat here
[35:06] Jehoshaphat father if you know was was
[35:08] ASA and ASA was one of the first kings
[35:11] since David to go in and tear down all
[35:14] the the idol worship that the the high
[35:17] places
[35:17] they said ASA even even disposed of his
[35:21] grandmother because his grandmother had
[35:24] all these these these idol temples and
[35:26] in these groves built and he destroyed
[35:29] them all
[35:31] so and ASA had kind of dealt with the
[35:35] same thing the Jehoshaphat's getting
[35:36] ready to come through and jajaja ASA
[35:39] prayed to the lord said will your people
[35:41] you're our God please fight for us do
[35:45] this for us and ASA had 35 years of
[35:47] peace thirty-five years of peace so war
[35:51] hadn't been in Judah for thirty-four
[35:53] over 35 years and here's Jehoshaphat
[35:56] he's in the land that God gave him they
[36:01] have all this these things that God gave
[36:02] him and for some reason the men UIC's
[36:06] the ammonites and the Moabites decide
[36:09] they're going to come take it but
[36:13] Jehoshaphat he didn't he didn't get all
[36:17] worked up
[36:19] and I don't know if they have it on the
[36:21] screen but I I brought up the amplified
[36:24] version amplified version of jehoshaphat
[36:28] sprayer Jehoshaphat says Oh Lord God of
[36:33] Our Fathers are you not God in heaven
[36:37] do you not rule over all the kingdoms of
[36:40] the nation's power and might are in your
[36:43] hand there was no one able to stand
[36:45] against you O our God did not you drive
[36:49] out the inhabitants this land before
[36:50] your people Israel and give it forever
[36:53] to the sentence of your friend Abraham
[36:55] they have lived in it and have built you
[36:58] a sanctuary in it for your name saying
[37:00] if an evil comes upon us or the sword of
[37:03] judgment or the plague or the famine we
[37:05] will we shall withstand I want you to
[37:08] remember that we will stand we're gonna
[37:09] get into that here in a minute ladies 10
[37:11] we're gonna stand you didn't say we're
[37:13] gonna fight he didn't say we're gonna do
[37:16] this that buddy said we're gonna stand
[37:18] we're going to stand before this house
[37:21] and before you and for your name and
[37:22] your presence is in this house and we
[37:24] will cry out to you in our distress and
[37:26] you will hear and save us he had no
[37:29] doubts what God was going to do he said
[37:31] god I'm going to ask for this and you're
[37:33] going to give it now behold the sons of
[37:36] Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir whom you
[37:39] have not allowed Israel to invade when
[37:42] they come from the land of Egypt for
[37:44] they have turned away from them and do
[37:46] not did not destroy them here they are
[37:48] rewarding us by coming to drive out us
[37:52] out of our out of your possessions Lord
[37:56] they're driving us out of what you've
[37:57] given us they're driving us out of what
[38:00] is really yours so here these enemies of
[38:03] Judah they're standing on God's ground
[38:08] when we talk to them the name of the
[38:13] wilderness of Jerry ul it's it's founded
[38:18] by God that's what it means founded by
[38:20] God God tells him said you go to the
[38:22] edge of that which is mine and you stand
[38:24] there and you wait there I'll fight for
[38:26] what's mine
[38:28] that this is my possessions the enemy's
[38:32] not going to take my possessions you
[38:33] stand off of it just stand there
[38:39] rewarding us by coming to drive out
[38:42] drive us out of your possession which
[38:43] you have given us as an inheritance Oh
[38:46] our God will you not judge them for we
[38:48] are powerless against this great
[38:50] multitude which is coming against us he
[38:52] was right the Bible says I told you
[38:54] young people of the night there was a
[38:55] worthy adversary
[38:56] used to face him on your own you would
[38:58] have no chance absolutely no chance and
[39:02] Josif I knew that he wasn't saying you
[39:06] know weren't were nothing just nothing
[39:09] we're just nothing without you we are
[39:12] powerless against this great multitude
[39:14] which cometh against us we do not know
[39:17] what to do but our eyes are on you what
[39:22] a place to have your eyes you can have
[39:25] your eyes all over your circumstances
[39:26] you can have your eyes on your symptoms
[39:28] of your problem whatever your problem is
[39:30] you can you can look at look at your
[39:31] your loved ones that are fallen off you
[39:34] can have your eyes on that or you can
[39:35] have your eyes on him so Jehoshaphat is
[39:40] is saying we're going to stand and trust
[39:41] you we don't know what we wouldn't know
[39:45] what to do is totally relevant just
[39:48] because you don't know what to do that
[39:50] means nothing to God God don't need you
[39:53] know how anyway that's where we get
[39:57] messed up is when we get to the point we
[39:58] figured out how to fix it
[40:01] jehosophat didn't even try to fix it
[40:03] they didn't attempt to fix it they said
[40:07] my eyes are on you look at look at look
[40:10] at the military military does not move
[40:12] until the captain or the general who had
[40:14] ever tells him what to do and where to
[40:15] go
[40:16] what maneuvers to make so let's remember
[40:22] what they were fighting this kind of
[40:24] look at what they were fighting for this
[40:26] is land that was promised to him when
[40:28] God promised this to Abraham many many
[40:31] years before he said this this land is
[40:33] yours and that and to your seed as many
[40:35] as your seed shall be as the stars of
[40:37] the heavens the sands of the Seas and
[40:39] this is what they're fighting for
[40:41] well Bram says in possessing all things
[40:44] then like when Abraham what did God tell
[40:46] him this land belongs to you what's in
[40:49] it is yours
[40:50] look east north west and south it's all
[40:53] yours everything here I want you to come
[40:57] journey in a strange land I'm going to
[40:59] make you heir of that land I'll give you
[41:01] this to you and your seed for it forever
[41:04] you a forever
[41:05] now Abraham only thing he had to do was
[41:08] put his faith on that promise pick up
[41:10] his sword and take off when the crucial
[41:12] moment came he got down there and God
[41:15] fought his battle and when he fought the
[41:17] battle he slaughtered the kings
[41:21] everybody here is gonna fight something
[41:23] everybody here is fighting something
[41:26] this you got something in your life you
[41:28] got a problem everyone's different but
[41:31] there's not one single person in here
[41:32] that has a problem that you're not
[41:34] fighting that's part of being a son a
[41:37] daughter of God if you're not fighting
[41:38] everything anything you better check
[41:40] your life with the word because you're
[41:43] going to fight to gain anything you have
[41:44] to fight for it you probably might be a
[41:48] financial about me depressed you might
[41:49] be sickness might be disease it might be
[41:51] a lost loved one you might have a loved
[41:53] one on drugs you might have a lost
[41:55] husband a lost wife everybody has got
[41:57] something you might struggle with
[41:59] bitterness you might struggle with with
[42:02] jealousy you might struggle with
[42:03] different things in your life
[42:06] the Sun that does not make you take you
[42:09] away from being a seed to God you can
[42:13] rest assured if you're fighting Satan
[42:16] and got you if you're fighting Satan's
[42:18] not on the ground that you're possessing
[42:22] but you're gonna fight for everything
[42:24] God gave you God's just not gonna hand
[42:26] it to you you're not you're not just
[42:28] going to reach out and God's gonna hand
[42:30] it to you and you're gonna take it
[42:31] you're gonna sit down and get under a
[42:32] palm tree and sip lemonade it don't work
[42:34] that way you're on a battlefield every
[42:37] every day so you might wonder to
[42:43] yourself why why am I not gaining ground
[42:46] why why am i am I going nowhere
[42:50] everybody goes through those times
[42:53] everybody goes through the time Emeril
[42:55] brother branham said God didn't talk to
[42:56] him for for a long time he didn't feel
[42:58] his presence didn't feel anything
[42:59] you know if the Prophet if the Prophet
[43:03] was that way if God would pull himself
[43:05] away from the Prophet and fill in his
[43:07] presence and not talking to him who are
[43:09] we you know
[43:13] God uses those times to see what you do
[43:16] to Moche or shape you if you can trust
[43:19] God in the times if you could trust God
[43:23] in the times when you feel him nowhere
[43:26] well you know you've got these days
[43:28] we've all had them when you go to work
[43:31] and you feel just like it's so down like
[43:33] this heavy weight is on your chest and
[43:35] you don't know what to do and it's day
[43:37] after day the same weight the same
[43:38] weight and Satan talking to you he's not
[43:42] there he don't hear you if you can trust
[43:44] God through those times but don't let
[43:46] that faith and that trust waver in those
[43:48] times you're gaining ground you don't
[43:50] even know
[43:51] you're possessing more ground let's just
[43:57] let's read this I told young people I
[43:59] think the scripture here I've read it
[44:00] just about an half hour more of my
[44:02] sermons but I love it James 4:7 submit
[44:07] yourselves therefore to God resist the
[44:09] devil and he will flee from you submit
[44:13] it's a military term to arrange true
[44:16] provisions in a military fashion under
[44:18] command of a leader now when we think of
[44:22] resist we're going to look at this word
[44:23] what we would think of resist sometimes
[44:25] you think of you know over in the third
[44:27] world countries are in Ireland places
[44:29] you know they've got these these rebels
[44:30] they call the resistance and they go out
[44:33] and they force warfare upon their
[44:35] opponent that's ain't what this means
[44:38] it doesn't say fight the devil and he
[44:41] will flee from you it doesn't say gather
[44:43] an army together get all your brothers
[44:46] and sisters together and you're not
[44:48] moving unless you get called one great
[44:50] big parrot prayer meeting and you're
[44:51] going nowhere
[44:52] it says resist let's look at the word to
[44:56] win stand to make firm to fix establish
[45:00] to cause a person or a thing to keep his
[45:03] or its place so don't move when he says
[45:08] stand Joseph had says we will stand
[45:13] that's what he's saying we're going to
[45:15] resist let's look at the rest to stop
[45:19] stand still to stand in Mobile stand
[45:22] firm of the foundation of a building to
[45:25] continue safe and sound stand unharmed
[45:28] to stand ready or prepared to be a
[45:32] steadfast mind of quality one who does
[45:34] not hesitate and does not waver
[45:37] that does not mean for you to take it
[45:40] upon yourself to take care of your
[45:42] problem
[45:44] we get more trouble fixing our own
[45:47] problems and I can raise my hand on that
[45:51] I've gotten myself in so much trouble
[45:53] fixing my own problems and I might get
[45:56] in trouble fixing some more because I'm
[45:58] human I'm flesh but I pray to God those
[46:02] intervals in between me fixing my
[46:04] problems get greater and greater and my
[46:07] fixing gets less and less so that's what
[46:12] if we listen here this is what jzl is
[46:15] telling Jehoshaphat in him basically
[46:18] he's telling him James 4:7 submit
[46:23] yourself to God but God who gave you
[46:25] this possession the God who gave you
[46:27] this land and resists you stand in
[46:32] mobile you stand in tact you establish
[46:36] yourself on the place that God told you
[46:38] to stand and don't move always what
[46:44] baffled me how the children of Israel
[46:46] through their journeys through the
[46:48] wilderness you know brother branham and
[46:51] historians you know told you there's
[46:52] probably only a four days journey from
[46:53] from Egypt to the promised land but they
[46:56] wandered for we know they wandered 40
[46:58] years it always baffled me that as soon
[47:01] as they get out of Egypt they seen the
[47:02] miracles in Egypt they seen the flies
[47:04] they seen the lies they seen the water
[47:06] turned the blood they see the firstborns
[47:08] killed of Egyptians all the miracles
[47:10] that God performed before they were left
[47:12] and then then when they leave they get
[47:14] up to the Red Sea and in the whole way
[47:17] here's a supernatural cloud in front of
[47:20] them there's a supernatural pillar of
[47:23] fire in front of them they know that's
[47:26] made of God they know that no man could
[47:29] done that and yet they murmured a
[47:31] complaint in the face of God if God
[47:37] Himself was to come into your room one
[47:39] day when you're complaining fussing
[47:43] about something simple that he could
[47:45] have fixed that you're complaining about
[47:47] it you're all tore about and you're just
[47:50] rest inside you don't know what to do
[47:51] and you can't believe this is happening
[47:53] to you and so if God Himself appeared
[47:57] in that in that room with you in a
[47:59] pillar fire in a body form whatever it
[48:01] was would you keep complaining and you
[48:04] knew it was God would you keep
[48:07] complaining
[48:08] would you still murmur would you say god
[48:10] I can't believe you let this come on me
[48:12] there's no it's impossible it would
[48:15] never happen but that's exactly what
[48:17] they were doing in the face of God and
[48:19] always it just always stumbled me I
[48:22] guess to say that how could they do that
[48:25] you see the miracles you see things in
[48:27] your life how is it that sometimes you
[48:31] know we testify that God has done this
[48:33] for us and done this force and the next
[48:35] problem arises we're complaining again
[48:42] didn't you just testify three months ago
[48:45] that he healed you bet he fixed the
[48:49] financial situation you was in your car
[48:52] was down you did broke down you didn't
[48:54] know what to do so you got on your knees
[48:55] and prayed two hours later it's running
[48:57] fine and there's some little thing hit
[49:02] us so we don't know what to do that
[49:08] that's that's life that's that's life as
[49:12] a human being but this this human being
[49:15] needs to learn to become subject to the
[49:17] word I told you know people of the night
[49:20] I absolutely believe that this bride is
[49:24] going to get to the point where it
[49:26] trusts God so much for every single
[49:28] thing that happens in her life it's
[49:30] going to bring her to such as point of
[49:31] maturity God ain't got no choice but to
[49:35] bring her out
[49:36] I absolutely believe that with all my
[49:38] heart brother Terry she's gonna reach
[49:40] that point of maturity which I why does
[49:44] God why does God fight your battles why
[49:47] why would God fight your battles we can
[49:54] throw a lot of we can throw a lot of
[49:57] guesswork and reasons out there yeah if
[50:01] a man was to come up for your wife at
[50:03] Walmart and salt her call her a filthy
[50:06] name would you fight her battle love is
[50:12] the only reason why God fights your
[50:14] battle you complete him just like your
[50:19] wife your wife completes you there's
[50:24] nothing anybody could ever do to my wife
[50:26] you know listen you said you you turn up
[50:29] your cheek if they hit me I might be
[50:34] what my cheek they hit you no I I just
[50:39] I'm sorry
[50:40] you know I'll ask forgiveness later but
[50:45] I hope I hope to god I would defend my
[50:47] wife's honor and that's that's what God
[50:50] is doing you are the queen of heaven and
[50:52] anybody or anything that comes against
[50:55] his queen he's going to fight this this
[50:58] was a promise he made before the
[51:00] foundation of the world before you were
[51:01] ever created
[51:02] I will fight your battles you don't have
[51:06] to do anything
[51:08] submit yourself to your husband and
[51:12] stand
[51:13] that's all he's saying so like I've seen
[51:20] it always to me and God showed herself
[51:24] God showed himself that he loved his
[51:26] room but she showed that he loved him
[51:28] time and time again and yet they
[51:32] complained they murmured nothing never
[51:36] happy with anything nothing got done him
[51:39] but God give him man out of heaven they
[51:42] complained he gave him quails out of
[51:44] heaven 40 years their clothes never
[51:46] never got old those shoes never wore out
[51:49] how would you like to get up 30 years
[51:51] later and put on a coat that you had 30
[51:53] years ago and it's like brand-new and
[51:56] then complain it's impossible to lose
[52:05] when you give the battle to God if not
[52:08] if Israel had it if they had trusted God
[52:10] right from the get-go when they left in
[52:12] Egypt if they did trust him then they'd
[52:15] been there in four days but see they
[52:19] didn't trust God they didn't even trust
[52:21] God when they got into the land when God
[52:22] told him to destroy ever about
[52:23] everything in there push him out push
[52:25] him out that's what we talked about last
[52:26] time I preached here
[52:28] what I preached about the heirs
[52:31] possessions they didn't push him out and
[52:34] it came back later upon him and God said
[52:38] I'll do it for you so what battles are
[52:41] you fighting are you getting weary
[52:44] trying to fight these battles yourself
[52:48] I hope that myself and everybody in here
[52:51] leaves here tonight with a different
[52:52] outlook on the problems in your life
[52:55] because this is my second time preaching
[52:57] this this week so I've got no excuses in
[53:04] reading this you know I got think what
[53:06] do we fight what do the children of God
[53:08] fight every day and I was searching
[53:12] through the scriptures and I found in
[53:13] fission in 612 and I like the amplified
[53:17] version on that it brings it down to
[53:19] where I can understand it for our
[53:21] struggle is not against flesh and blood
[53:24] containing only with physical opponents
[53:26] but against the rulers against the
[53:28] powers against the world Force's of this
[53:30] present darkness against the spiritual
[53:33] forces of wickedness in the heavenly
[53:34] supernatural places that's what brother
[53:38] Branham said that a spiritual demon a
[53:40] religious demon was the worst demon
[53:41] there was when when you fight those when
[53:46] Satan comes against you when the pre
[53:48] pastor's up here and preachers up there
[53:50] preaching the word and Satan's talking
[53:51] you that's not right that's not right
[53:54] some spiritual demons that's what he's
[53:57] saying right here against the spiritual
[53:58] forces of wickedness in heavenly
[54:00] supernatural places that Satan's battle
[54:03] he knows he can't tell you you know
[54:05] you're not a son or daughter of God he
[54:06] knows you've got that seal down in here
[54:08] but the ground that he wants to take
[54:10] from you the ground that he wants to
[54:13] take from you is is the things that come
[54:15] upon you and make you doubt that God can
[54:18] fight that battle for you he makes you
[54:21] think that you need to get your hands
[54:23] all over it what happens when we do that
[54:34] so as you fight these battles there was
[54:37] a few children Israel Joshua and Caleb
[54:40] you know that they didn't let the
[54:42] doubters get to them the complainers
[54:44] you're gonna have them you're gonna have
[54:46] them listen you look look at the if you
[54:51] want to call them message believers that
[54:53] have pulled away into their own thing
[54:55] you know some of you got family members
[54:57] that have done that and they talk to you
[55:01] and try to pull you out of this pull you
[55:03] away from the real Word of God
[55:04] try to pull you in something that it
[55:06] that was spawned out of hell listen it's
[55:10] real it's it's really you might not
[55:13] fight fight battles of lest you might
[55:16] not fought battles of alcohol and
[55:18] smoking and porn and all this stuff that
[55:19] might not be your battle your daily
[55:23] battle might be this message right here
[55:26] because that's the only thing Satan
[55:28] knows how to fight you with he knows
[55:30] this word back front front words the
[55:32] backwards and he knows the little parts
[55:35] of it that you struggle with so if
[55:39] you're struggling with something give it
[55:41] to God not I don't understand this I I
[55:44] have I have struggled with things in my
[55:46] life and prayed on the way to church
[55:51] lord I need I don't understand this I
[55:54] need this and sit right back there and
[55:56] it revealed this is ABC's to me when God
[56:02] fights for you ain't hard be it ain't it
[56:05] ain't hard but don't let somebody's
[56:10] unbelief stubble you I got an in study
[56:12] this I got to think about something
[56:14] about David that I never thought of
[56:15] before when when he went to to fight
[56:17] Goliath David went into the camp to
[56:21] bring his brother something to eat
[56:25] everybody there was bigger than him
[56:28] everybody was stronger than him
[56:30] everybody was more physically prepared
[56:32] everybody knew how to do battle
[56:34] everybody had more equipment everybody
[56:37] was older
[56:39] and all he heard was nobody in our army
[56:45] can beat that guy we're going to be
[56:48] defeated because when our best
[56:51] challenger if anybody gets enough nerve
[56:52] to go out there and fight Goliath he's
[56:54] going to kill him and then their armies
[56:56] gonna kill all of us how would you like
[56:58] to walk into your day like that to start
[57:03] your day with everybody saying you're
[57:06] going to be defeated today you're going
[57:09] to lose today you know that battle that
[57:11] you've been dreading for so long it's
[57:13] coming today and you're gonna lose how
[57:16] would you like to walk into that that's
[57:19] exactly what David walked into you but
[57:22] the thing about David he never listened
[57:24] to one single word he never listened to
[57:26] anything he said because David never
[57:29] trusted himself David had no trust in
[57:32] his own abilities when David got there
[57:35] he had no idea what he was going to he
[57:38] did you know God had a plan all David
[57:42] was was a puppet and God went through
[57:44] his playbook and said yeah I think I'll
[57:45] use the stone slingshot today and that's
[57:48] what happened David didn't figure this
[57:53] out next time I go up against somebody
[57:55] I'm gonna use my slingshot hey you you
[58:00] can't plan your battles ahead of time
[58:03] you can't plan on what you're going to
[58:05] do tomorrow when that battle hits you
[58:07] you can't plan for it baby didn't plan
[58:10] for it listen and I've used it before
[58:12] not and I apologize I mean if you be
[58:15] carnal but it's like a coach in a
[58:20] football game
[58:21] y'all think if some of y'all think
[58:23] that's carnal I pray you're forgiven
[58:27] but a coaching a football game all that
[58:31] player is doing is performing the mind
[58:34] of the coach he tells him this is what I
[58:38] want you to do and then go out there and
[58:41] do it
[58:42] that's all David was doing David was
[58:46] acting on the mind of the coach he said
[58:48] hey the coach said listen Dave this plan
[58:51] has never failed it's never failed one
[58:54] it's never been used before but it's
[58:56] never failed this is the first time and
[58:59] it's foolproof
[59:02] God didn't have to to test his product
[59:06] [Applause]
[59:08] so every time you come up in a new
[59:11] battle if you go if you let God into the
[59:14] battle it's not gonna fail God has not
[59:18] yet become up upon a problem that he
[59:20] don't know what to fix but yet in our
[59:22] minds God this is a new one this is a
[59:26] new one you've never done this before
[59:27] you've never had a problem like mine God
[59:33] probably right but it's still no problem
[59:38] God's Way of fixing thing is foolproof
[59:42] but he's never failed one time if he did
[59:44] he's not God so look at David David goes
[59:48] in here in all he's hearing is is all
[59:51] this negative stuff this is what's going
[59:55] to happen you know and there's no way
[59:58] we're defeated they were defeated
[59:59] without even picking up a sword they
[1:00:01] were defeated and God used David to
[1:00:05] fight the battle David absolutely no
[1:00:11] physical ability to beat life
[1:00:13] couldn't beat the life there's no it's
[1:00:15] impossible for a little ruddy guy like
[1:00:17] brother BAM called him probably a
[1:00:20] teenager it was impossible then for
[1:00:24] David without God to beat that giant
[1:00:27] it's impossible for you to fix your
[1:00:31] problem but you have someone like a
[1:00:35] battle listen like if nothing else you
[1:00:38] remember remember the title of my sermon
[1:00:40] tonight the battle is not yours
[1:00:42] God said I'll freely take it from you if
[1:00:46] you'll just let me have it
[1:00:52] instead Satan's job he'll make you think
[1:00:54] you're in the battle alone that's that's
[1:00:55] what he does it makes you think you have
[1:00:58] a better chance to do it your way
[1:01:02] listen in life story well Brent said
[1:01:05] that's the way it is anything as long as
[1:01:07] you're going to do it if someone's talks
[1:01:08] about you and you talk about them God
[1:01:11] can't fight your battle you're fighting
[1:01:14] it yourself so if somebody talks about
[1:01:17] you and you fix him on Facebook I don't
[1:01:24] care if you use a scripture to fix them
[1:01:26] that ain't gone that's not God
[1:01:29] [Applause]
[1:01:30] let's use straightening them out on your
[1:01:32] own with no authority brother Bram says
[1:01:41] God can't fight your battle you're
[1:01:43] fighting it for yourself just let loose
[1:01:46] and let him do it just commit it to him
[1:01:48] the greatest weapon that I know of a
[1:01:50] Christian today is it committed to God
[1:01:52] well you can't do nothing about it just
[1:01:55] committed to him and God will take care
[1:01:56] of it do you believe that so why would
[1:02:04] we try to fix a problem on our own if
[1:02:05] God said I'll fix it for you I throw the
[1:02:09] young people with other night if an easy
[1:02:10] way for them to get the picture of what
[1:02:13] I'm saying is we play tug of war with
[1:02:14] God we'll take your problem and you play
[1:02:18] tug of war with God with your problem
[1:02:19] God says let me fix it for you you say
[1:02:22] no God I'm gonna fix it God says no let
[1:02:24] me fix it and you say no I think I got
[1:02:26] this this time and you plate it you're
[1:02:29] never gonna win you're never gonna win
[1:02:31] if you look if God says okay I'll let
[1:02:34] you fix it you're still not gonna win
[1:02:36] it's impossible he's trying to take the
[1:02:43] battle from you and you keep pulling it
[1:02:44] out of his hands you keep saying I'll
[1:02:47] fix it look and look at Moses in the
[1:02:50] Bible that's what he did it God said
[1:02:51] speak to the rock this was God's
[1:02:54] gameplan speak to the rock and I'll
[1:02:58] bring forth water but Moses smote the
[1:03:03] rock so Moses fixed the problem his way
[1:03:06] he didn't let God do it he done it
[1:03:08] himself
[1:03:10] we smite the rock and we wonder why
[1:03:12] sometimes we're not growing we're not
[1:03:15] getting blessed because we're smiting
[1:03:17] the rock in her life
[1:03:18] we're smiting and God can't move because
[1:03:23] you're doing it he says let me do it
[1:03:25] what was he supposed to do speak just
[1:03:28] speak stand and speak in pairs sometimes
[1:03:36] we do that in our kids life
[1:03:39] listen to me a minute we smite the rock
[1:03:41] and her kids life you wonder why your
[1:03:44] kid does not growing spiritually why
[1:03:46] your kid cannot overcome certain battles
[1:03:48] in his life while there's no growth
[1:03:51] spiritually he's coming in here she's
[1:03:54] coming in here a sitting service after
[1:03:56] service after service and you can't
[1:03:58] figure out what's wrong because every
[1:04:00] time they get a battle in their life
[1:04:01] you're fixing it for him you're pulling
[1:04:05] out the wallet you're pulling out the
[1:04:06] checkbook you're calling the school
[1:04:08] fixing their problem Hey if their son
[1:04:14] and daughter of God - they're going to
[1:04:15] go through battles and they don't need
[1:04:17] your hands on it it hurts sometimes it
[1:04:20] hurts to see our children go through
[1:04:21] things in life but God might be molding
[1:04:26] them and shaking them in such a way to
[1:04:28] make them stronger for a greater better
[1:04:29] that's coming and here we are putting
[1:04:33] our hands you know listen I love my kids
[1:04:37] and then if you see things that come in
[1:04:40] their life you know as you get older and
[1:04:42] you have kids you see your kids start to
[1:04:44] go through some of the battles that you
[1:04:45] went through and you think well I went
[1:04:47] through that I can help them with that
[1:04:48] no you can't I think God's will it's not
[1:04:53] God's will if God's wheels for him to to
[1:04:56] grow the way you grow through that
[1:04:57] battle you best keep your hands from it
[1:05:00] so don't play tug-of-war with your your
[1:05:03] kids battles either teach him to stand
[1:05:13] tell them say Johnny Suzie I'm sorry
[1:05:16] what you're going through I'm sorry you
[1:05:18] have to go through that battle I can't
[1:05:20] fix it but I know who can share with him
[1:05:25] the testimony of your battle share
[1:05:28] within what God brought you from how God
[1:05:30] got you through that battle teach him to
[1:05:33] pray teach him to read teach him to
[1:05:35] listen to the word LeBron said stand
[1:05:42] still and see the salvation of the Lord
[1:05:45] he will make the cripples walk he will
[1:05:48] let the devil who flick did you stand
[1:05:50] still and see the glory of God
[1:05:52] it's not your battle just stand still
[1:05:55] it's God battle God's battle don't be
[1:05:57] frustrated don't be upset
[1:05:59] stand still says I preach Christ the
[1:06:05] same yesterday today and forever stand
[1:06:08] still and see the glory of God it's not
[1:06:10] your battle begin with his God's battle
[1:06:11] it isn't your promise to begin with it's
[1:06:14] God promise and here I stand tonight
[1:06:16] it's not my worry define he's praying
[1:06:18] for a sister there he said it's not my
[1:06:19] worry to find out about this woman God
[1:06:22] promised to do that that's right
[1:06:25] I just stand still and see the glory of
[1:06:27] God does the work whenever brother
[1:06:29] Branham would they would have a prayer
[1:06:30] line and they would come up to him and
[1:06:33] God would show him but Branham didn't
[1:06:36] try to figure out what was wrong with
[1:06:37] him
[1:06:37] he said that's God's job you know and
[1:06:41] how many times did you you heard him say
[1:06:43] it God hasn't showed me he hasn't showed
[1:06:46] me he said that's that's God's that's
[1:06:50] that's an issue with God that's God's
[1:06:52] thing to do right that's not mine so
[1:06:57] don't you don't be trying to figure out
[1:06:59] love times we get problems off which are
[1:07:01] gonna try to figure out why it might be
[1:07:03] just to bring you closer to God there's
[1:07:07] no mystery behind it
[1:07:09] God's was trying to get you I don't know
[1:07:12] how many times I've had things in my
[1:07:13] life just drive me to my knees and I
[1:07:16] knew it I knew that's what God was want
[1:07:18] me to do things that come in my life and
[1:07:20] I and I was thinking why Lord why is
[1:07:22] this and almost instantly you need to
[1:07:25] pray more you need to get closer to God
[1:07:29] why why did God want me closer to him
[1:07:33] I'm his wife
[1:07:36] that's his desire let's let there it
[1:07:40] sits we can complicate it all we want
[1:07:43] God talked to our bowels cuz He loves us
[1:07:45] and he loves us and he wants us close
[1:07:47] it's about as simple as that
[1:07:51] well brain says that's right he said the
[1:07:54] guy it's God's promise to do it that's
[1:07:56] right I just stand stealing the glory of
[1:07:58] God does the work I put my I put one of
[1:08:01] my own words in it it wouldn't be right
[1:08:03] I don't put my words in I just stand
[1:08:06] still let God do it it works every time
[1:08:10] a lot of times you might get discouraged
[1:08:14] when it don't happen instantly yeah God
[1:08:16] didn't say as soon as you believe me I'm
[1:08:18] gonna let it happen but if he said it's
[1:08:22] gonna happen it's gonna happen I got to
[1:08:27] look and Gideon and study in this I
[1:08:29] think about Gideon god get him believe
[1:08:31] God but he was a little skeptical God
[1:08:36] told him I want to use you and just a
[1:08:38] few men to deliver the people okay god I
[1:08:42] believe you but let me put a fleece
[1:08:43] before you and God said okay okay god I
[1:08:50] believe you now that you confirmed that
[1:08:52] but then they put another fleece before
[1:08:53] you we do that Gideon was just being a
[1:09:01] human I'll read this I hope it's not too
[1:09:07] long it simply judges 6 and 11 there
[1:09:13] came an angel of the Lord and sat under
[1:09:15] an oak which was an Oprah that pertained
[1:09:19] to joash I don't know what he is and his
[1:09:22] son Gideon thresh tweet by the winepress
[1:09:24] to hide it from the Midianites the angel
[1:09:27] of the Lord appeared unto him and said
[1:09:29] unto Him the Lord is with thee thou
[1:09:31] mighty man of Valor first thing he told
[1:09:36] him when he come there the Lord's with
[1:09:38] you
[1:09:39] that was the very first words that he
[1:09:42] told him the Lord is with you
[1:09:45] Gideon knew he was an angel so if an
[1:09:50] angel came to you and said the Lord's
[1:09:51] with you you're gonna face a battle gods
[1:09:55] with you you're gonna overcome so would
[1:10:01] you believe him or would you be
[1:10:02] skeptical I know I would do because I've
[1:10:08] never seen it I've never seen an angel
[1:10:09] and I guess maybe this might have been
[1:10:12] common in Gideon's life I don't know but
[1:10:15] Gideon was skeptical and God had to
[1:10:19] prove to him God they had to humor
[1:10:21] Gideon me I'll humor you give me another
[1:10:23] fleece and that happens in our lives
[1:10:27] I've done it I've asked God for things
[1:10:30] before and I say Lord if you could just
[1:10:33] show me some kind of sign there's
[1:10:35] nothing wrong with that brother brand I
[1:10:37] believe brother branham told this lady
[1:10:38] to pray to speak in tongues to confirm
[1:10:40] her you know that she had the Holy Ghost
[1:10:42] there's there's nothing wrong with that
[1:10:44] but I think God wants us to get to a
[1:10:47] point in our lives that when he says if
[1:10:49] we believe in trusting and that's it you
[1:10:52] know just listen standing will be so
[1:10:55] much easier if we if we learn to trust
[1:10:58] God that that's it just trust God
[1:11:02] anything you have in your life the
[1:11:05] problems that you have trust God to
[1:11:07] fight your battles if God if God allows
[1:11:11] a battle to come in your life he trusts
[1:11:13] you with it he knows you know he won't
[1:11:16] put him more on you than you can bear
[1:11:18] so if God puts a battle in your life
[1:11:22] he's not gonna put a too big of a battle
[1:11:24] that you can't get through he's not
[1:11:26] gonna give you something that's too
[1:11:28] overwhelming for you because nothing is
[1:11:31] too overwhelming for him and he's the
[1:11:32] ones going to be doing the fighting
[1:11:36] sometimes we look at the battle itself
[1:11:40] instead of the battle plan
[1:11:43] we look at the battle and that Satan's
[1:11:46] job in our life is to make us to look at
[1:11:48] the battle and put blinders on and alls
[1:11:51] we see what's in front of us and God
[1:11:55] says I've got the battle plan right here
[1:11:56] and when we totally forget the battle
[1:11:59] plan and the battle plan is just like
[1:12:03] I'll fight for you let me have it
[1:12:06] there's the battle in front of you you
[1:12:09] stand right here resist submit yourself
[1:12:13] to me and I'll fight for you
[1:12:18] listen if he ever gets to the point
[1:12:20] where he needs me to help him on our
[1:12:22] battles then God's in bad shape if he
[1:12:25] ever needs me because I'm a poor excuse
[1:12:29] for hell I can't even hardly help myself
[1:12:32] so I can't you know but I just don't see
[1:12:36] ever God getting to the point
[1:12:38] God says just remain motionless remain
[1:12:42] unmovable glue yourself to that spot and
[1:12:45] watch what I can do well the Bram says
[1:12:51] what more can God do be still now and
[1:12:55] know that he's God not it's not your
[1:12:56] battle they had prayed and he said to
[1:12:58] the army go down there and just stand
[1:13:00] still and watch my glory while they were
[1:13:02] two days packing the spoilers away he
[1:13:04] put the enemy in such confusion such a
[1:13:06] riot until they killed each other
[1:13:08] certainly and if you'll just be still
[1:13:10] now and know that God made you the
[1:13:13] promise he gave it by the Bible he
[1:13:15] confirmed it by his resurrection he
[1:13:17] showed it through his church he
[1:13:19] displayed it here tonight what more can
[1:13:21] he do what does God what does God have
[1:13:24] to do to get us the trustee if you if
[1:13:32] God's fighting for you people are gonna
[1:13:34] know it your life is going to be a
[1:13:36] testimony
[1:13:37] it's just this the bad part is is when
[1:13:42] you forget and other people remember I
[1:13:46] brought that out the other night with
[1:13:48] Rahab here the spies go into Jericho
[1:13:55] this body's going to Jericho and this is
[1:13:58] a Gentile dog nation and she began to
[1:14:02] testify what God done for me
[1:14:05] she knew what God had done for them they
[1:14:09] had forgot 40 years past they'd
[1:14:12] forgotten what God had done for him in
[1:14:14] Egypt they had forgotten what God done
[1:14:15] to him at the Red Sea what God had done
[1:14:17] to him all the way all the way through
[1:14:19] up to that journey they'd forgotten they
[1:14:20] were murmuring complaining the whole way
[1:14:22] and here's some Gentile dog tells him
[1:14:24] you remember what God done for you our
[1:14:28] host city Trimble's because of what God
[1:14:30] has done for you this is what Rahab
[1:14:36] tells him I know that the Lord hath
[1:14:38] given you this land and that a great
[1:14:40] fear of you is falling upon us the LORD
[1:14:43] hath given you the land the Lord has is
[1:14:46] gonna fight for you and the Lord is
[1:14:47] giving you this land
[1:14:48] she was test you was testifying it
[1:14:50] wasn't them she was testifying God was
[1:14:52] fighting their battles so that all who
[1:14:58] live in this country are melting in fear
[1:14:59] because of you we heard how the Lord
[1:15:01] dried up the water of the Red Sea
[1:15:03] because of you we heard how says for
[1:15:07] when you come out of Egypt what you did
[1:15:09] it
[1:15:10] Sion and all the two kings of the
[1:15:12] amorite east of the Jordan whom you
[1:15:14] completely destroy we heard of it our
[1:15:16] hearts melted in fear and everyone's
[1:15:18] courage failed because of you for the
[1:15:20] Lord your God in heaven your Lord Lord
[1:15:23] your God is God in heaven above and on
[1:15:25] the earth below she was testifying that
[1:15:30] God was fighting their battles
[1:15:33] and if you're allowing God to fight your
[1:15:36] battles people are going to see it
[1:15:38] people are going to know it just don't
[1:15:42] get to the point where you forget if you
[1:15:47] if you if remembrance remembrance will
[1:15:49] strengthen your faith remember it
[1:15:52] strengthens faith anytime you get
[1:15:55] something in your life that drags you
[1:15:56] down the battle or something that comes
[1:15:58] up against you remember what he done for
[1:16:00] you remember what he done for your
[1:16:01] brothers and sisters listen I can't
[1:16:04] fight your battles for you back and
[1:16:05] stand with you I can be immovable with
[1:16:07] you I can resist with you this is a body
[1:16:11] move it's a body move don't don't think
[1:16:16] you're in this alone you're not in this
[1:16:18] alone but there ain't a single person
[1:16:21] here can fight your battle but everybody
[1:16:24] and you can stand with you
[1:16:27] that's a lot of faith that's a lot of
[1:16:30] faith like I've said it before there
[1:16:32] comes to a point in your life where
[1:16:33] sometimes you're too weak you're too
[1:16:35] sick here to discourage you too much in
[1:16:37] grief to have the right kind of faith
[1:16:38] that you need but the body heals itself
[1:16:44] so with everybody that's standing with
[1:16:46] you
[1:16:47] everybody that's trusting God with you
[1:16:48] everybody with you is allowing God
[1:16:50] standing still and watching God fights
[1:16:52] your battle with you that's a lot of
[1:16:55] faith that's a lot of trust in God we've
[1:17:00] been blessed as of telling tell him the
[1:17:05] other night if God never blesses me
[1:17:08] again never gives me one single blessing
[1:17:11] the rest of my life he's blessed me way
[1:17:13] more than I've ever could have to be
[1:17:15] blessed if God just the fact that God
[1:17:19] gave His only begotten Son to die on a
[1:17:20] cross that's more blessing than you ever
[1:17:23] deserve everything he gave you after
[1:17:26] that just added treasure that's because
[1:17:30] he loves you he's gonna he's going to
[1:17:33] give his wife things that's what he does
[1:17:37] he's gonna shower his wife with
[1:17:39] blessings he's gonna shower with with
[1:17:42] Lois love all's he asked her to do is
[1:17:43] trust that's all he's asking us to do is
[1:17:46] trust you're gonna walk out that door
[1:17:55] today tonight as soon as you walk out
[1:17:59] the door you're going to be in a battle
[1:18:00] you might be in a battle before you
[1:18:02] leave here Satan is not gonna like it
[1:18:06] when you come in here and listen to a
[1:18:08] battle plan he hates that worse than
[1:18:12] anything you're gonna come back in the
[1:18:14] morning you're gonna hear more on the
[1:18:15] battle plan that's what the word does it
[1:18:20] arms us it readies its fruit for the
[1:18:22] battles that light my head you know you

[1:18:26] blessed so many times we get we get

[1:18:31] result of all the blessings that you get
[1:18:33] even even the weapons we get in here
[1:18:35] sometimes I'm gonna telling my wife

[1:18:58] preaching hard and then they say I don't
