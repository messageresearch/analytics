[13:47] you may be
[13:53] seated we welcome you today to this
[13:56] special
[13:57] occasion we're gathered here in the
[13:59] sight of God in the face of this company
[14:02] to join together this man and this woman
[14:05] and the holy state of
[14:07] matrimony which is committed in the
[14:09] scripture to be entered into in the fear
[14:11] of God reverently discreetly and
[14:16] prayerfully if there's any person who
[14:18] can he show a Just Cause while these two
[14:21] persons should not be lawfully joined
[14:23] together let them speak now or forever
[14:27] hold their peace
[14:30] who gives this woman to be married to
[14:31] this
[14:37] man and When a Man Loves a Woman and
[14:41] marries her because she's just pretty
[14:43] there'll be an end to
[14:45] that but when a man finds a woman that
[14:48] he
[14:49] loves he don't know why but he loves
[14:53] her and she finds the man that she loves
[14:56] no matter what he looks like he loves
[14:59] her she loves him that's an eternal
[15:04] mate and Glory those death or nothing
[15:07] else can ever separate them because they
[15:10] are from
[15:11] eternity and they stepped out into space
[15:14] of time and will return back to
[15:16] [Music]
[15:19] Eternity I require in charge you both as
[15:21] you will answer at the day of judgment
[15:24] and the secrets of All Hearts be
[15:26] disclosed if either of you know of any
[15:29] impediment why you may not be lawfully
[15:31] joined together you do now speak for any
[15:35] couples joined together otherwise and
[15:37] God's word does allow their marriage is
[15:41] not
[15:42] lawful but I know that you both have
[15:45] considered it
[15:46] seriously prayerfully which is the way
[15:49] the Lord would want you to
[15:51] do I've married many many couples down
[15:55] through the years I never stand in this
[15:57] position
[15:59] without standing here realizing it's an
[16:01] awesome place to
[16:03] be to join a man in Woman by the law to
[16:09] be able to bring them together so you
[16:12] can hear their vows it's an awesome
[16:15] thing but only God can join two hearts
