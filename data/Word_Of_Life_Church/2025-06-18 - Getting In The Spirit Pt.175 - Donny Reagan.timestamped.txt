[29:07] on.
[29:45] [Music]
[29:54] All my life
[29:58] I've heard them talk of heaven.
[30:04] It's a place where loved ones live
[30:10] while ages roll.
[30:15] It's been many,
[30:17] many years
[30:20] since forgiven.
[30:25] And I'm just
[30:27] a little homesick
[30:30] to go.
[30:32] [Music]
[30:34] Yesterday
[30:37] brought tears that made me wonder
[30:43] [Music]
[30:44] if I'd ever
[30:47] walk upon
[30:49] those streets of gold.
[30:53] [Music]
[30:54] Oh, but Lord,
[30:57] you gave me strength.
[30:59] I didn't blunder.
[31:02] [Music]
[31:04] And I'm just
[31:07] a little homesick
[31:10] to go.
[31:14] But must I wait until the sun dries up
[31:20] the ocean
[31:23] or till the farmer goes to re
[31:29] before he s
[31:33] I've set my eyes upon the sky for the
[31:39] slightest motion.
[31:44] Because I'm just
[31:47] a little home sick to go.
[31:52] [Music]
[31:59] [Music]
[32:03] But must I wait until the sun dries up
[32:09] the ocean
[32:13] or till the farmer goes to rain
[32:19] before he saw?
[32:23] I've set my eyes upon the sky for the
[32:29] slightest motion.
[32:34] Because I'm just
[32:37] a little homesick
[32:40] to go.
[32:44] I've set my eyes upon the skies for the
[32:49] slightest motion
[32:54] because I'm just
[32:57] a little homesick
[33:00] to go.
[33:02] [Music]
[33:04] Oh Lord, I'm just
[33:07] a little homesick
[33:09] [Music]
[33:10] to go.
[33:12] [Laughter]
[33:18] [Music]
[33:21] [Applause]
[33:28] There's one word I'd change in that
[33:29] song.
[33:31] Not a little homesick,
[33:35] a lot of homesick.
[33:38] Every every day we live in Satan's Eden,
[33:42] it makes me more desirous to leave this
[33:45] place, don't it, you? Yeah. Brother Tim
[33:48] Puit says it this way. It's the in this
[33:52] rat race and the rats are the one
[33:54] winning. So, I guess that's why we don't
[33:58] feel at home anymore.
[34:00] Oh, what a country he's waiting for us.
[34:02] So, praise the Lord.
[34:05] Aren't you happy to be together tonight
[34:06] in the house of the Lord? What a
[34:09] privilege it is for us to be be gathered
[34:11] here and just to know that God is so so
[34:14] mindful of us. U let's turn if you would
[34:18] to Genesis chap 24 verse 21.
[34:24] We'll pray before we read the word. Um,
[34:28] I've been asking you to pray for brother
[34:30] Luther Dishman and his daughter had
[34:32] called Carol this evening and brother
[34:34] Luther had been in the hospital but they
[34:36] let him come home. Um, but he needs um a
[34:41] heart cast because something going on in
[34:43] his heart but his kidneys function is
[34:46] really really low and they can't really
[34:50] do the heart cast because of that. So
[34:52] may have to put him on dialysis a bit
[34:54] before they do it. So he just has
[34:57] several several needs in his body and
[35:00] know they'd appreciate if we would
[35:02] remember them and keep him and his wife
[35:04] his wife also in the hospital. She's
[35:06] still in there. I know that God would be
[35:09] be mindful of them. Anybody else want to
[35:11] lift your hand? You got a need or
[35:13] request on your heart tonight.
[35:15] Let's just pray together.
[35:18] Heavenly Father, we're so thankful that
[35:20] we have you in the time of great stress
[35:22] and trouble that we can look to, Father,
[35:26] and bring our needs and our requests and
[35:29] our petitions to you. It seems as if
[35:32] though, Lord, that we hardly can go a
[35:35] day anymore without so much going on and
[35:38] so much happening in the lives of the
[35:41] children of God. You knew it would come
[35:44] to this place. You knew father and you
[35:47] said it when you were here that at times
[35:50] would get worse and worse and the signs
[35:53] that it would be in the end time. We
[35:55] know the reoccurring instances of what
[35:58] went on in the days of Noah and violence
[36:01] filled the earth and we can see it all
[36:04] around us everywhere. Lord, you see the
[36:07] situation with Israel and Iran and Lord,
[36:10] the eruptions of violence in our own
[36:14] nation and protests and this and that
[36:16] and the other. We know it's just a
[36:18] pre-tribulation
[36:20] period anointing that's getting on
[36:22] people. Some people would rather argue
[36:25] than be peaceful. They'd rather just
[36:28] protest and and throw rocks and just all
[36:32] kinds of violent behavior. It's strange
[36:35] the time the time that we're in. And
[36:38] then Lord, sometimes to see the church
[36:40] people get under the same thing. But we
[36:43] pray that we would be anointed not with
[36:48] pre-tribulation,
[36:49] but pre-rapture
[36:51] anointing. That's what we want to
[36:54] operate under, Lord. We don't want our
[36:57] thoughts and our minds and our behavior
[37:00] influenced by this world that we're
[37:02] living. We're in it, but we're not of
[37:04] it. So, Father, we're bringing before
[37:07] you tonight the needs and the request of
[37:09] your people. We pray for Brother Luther
[37:11] Dishman tonight. We're thankful that he
[37:13] was able to get released out of the
[37:15] hospital today, but you see the doctors
[37:18] uh say that he needs his heart cast and
[37:21] the stuff that they would have to use to
[37:24] do that would be very hard on his
[37:26] kidneys. So, you see exactly that
[37:28] situation. Lord, we pray that you'd be
[37:30] mindful of our brother tonight. Lord,
[37:33] Sister Barbara, you see this terrible
[37:36] thing that she's dealing with, Lord, and
[37:39] part of her her mind and no longer knows
[37:42] her children, her family, and all that
[37:45] sort of thing. Dear God, we pray for
[37:47] your mercy. Dear Jesus, help her. I ask
[37:51] you, Lord, this prayer cross that I have
[37:54] in my hand tonight, Lord, for one of our
[37:56] brothers here in the church. You see the
[37:57] need that he has in his body, and I'm
[38:00] just praying, Father, that you'd move on
[38:02] his behalf in the name of Jesus. There
[38:05] was many hands that was uplifted
[38:07] signifying a need, maybe multiple needs.
[38:10] So, we ask that you just remember them
[38:12] as well. And as we endeavor to look into
[38:15] your word tonight, I pray that you'd
[38:17] help me to be able to get out of the
[38:19] way. Lord, shut my mouth to anything
[38:20] that would displease you. Open my mouth,
[38:23] my heart. Make me a channel by which the
[38:26] spirit of God can flow out and be able
[38:28] to speak to your children. Grant it,
[38:31] Father, in the name of Jesus, we pray.
[38:34] And the saints said, "Amen."
[38:37] Genesis chapter 24 verse 21.
[38:41] And the man wondering at her held his
[38:45] peace, to wit whether the Lord had made
[38:48] his journey prosperous or not. And it
[38:53] came to pass as the camels had done
[38:55] drinking that the man took a golden
[38:58] earring of half a shekele weight and two
[39:00] bracelets for her hands of 10 shekels
[39:06] weight of gold. May the Lord bless his
[39:09] word. You may be seated.
[39:17] As we know, marriage
[39:20] is a very serious thing.
[39:24] And before I go into
[39:27] uh Rebecca again tonight, I've just been
[39:31] thinking about it. had been on my heart
[39:34] that I know there's several of our um
[39:38] young adults here at the church that are
[39:40] at the marriageable age and some that
[39:43] are praying and thinking of course about
[39:47] girlfriends, boyfriends, all that sort
[39:49] of thing, which is natural for it to to
[39:52] be that way. And sometimes you may look
[39:56] around and think, well, I look at every
[39:59] boy in the church and I think I don't
[40:01] see nobody I want to spend the rest of
[40:03] my life with. And they may look around
[40:05] at you and think the same thing about
[40:07] you. You never know. But let me just say
[40:10] that that's a very important thing in
[40:14] our life. Whenever we come to that age
[40:17] and that stage in our life that we feel
[40:20] the pull and the desire for a mate and
[40:25] maybe you look around and think, well,
[40:28] I've been to this youth camp and I've
[40:29] been to this church and that church and
[40:32] I just haven't found anybody yet and I I
[40:34] I don't know what I'm going to do and
[40:36] I'm afraid I'm going to be an old maid
[40:38] because I'm 20 now or I'm 25 or whatever
[40:41] it is that you might be and you're
[40:44] thinking, "Oh my goodness, what am I
[40:46] going to do? And I'll tell you a mistake
[40:48] that I've seen so many around the
[40:52] message make and that is out of fear
[40:55] that they will join up with someone
[40:58] that's maybe a denominational person,
[41:00] maybe a good person as we will say. You
[41:03] don't want to marry a good person. you
[41:05] want to marry a great one and there is a
[41:08] world of difference or they will get
[41:11] someone maybe even in the ranks of the
[41:14] message and their their doctrinal
[41:17] differences are so far apart and let me
[41:19] tell you something there's there's
[41:21] doctrines in this message and churches
[41:23] and some of the things that some of the
[41:25] people message people believe and
[41:26] promote I would not feel very
[41:29] comfortable in recommending any of our
[41:32] people to marry some of that stuff cuz
[41:34] it would be just about as bad as
[41:36] marrying a denominational because it
[41:38] actually is. It's a message
[41:40] denomination. And they will think the
[41:42] fear, the trauma will begin to move in
[41:46] their minds and then the anxiety and
[41:48] then they'll go to sinking in in the
[41:50] realm of compromise. Well, it's not
[41:53] perfect. It's not ideal, but I'd rather
[41:56] have that than I would to be alone for
[41:59] the rest of my life. And you may look at
[42:01] it and think, well, you know, it it's
[42:03] terrible to be single and be alone. But
[42:06] let me tell you what's worse.
[42:08] To be married
[42:10] and to feel alone. Amen. Because in my
[42:14] ministry of decades of counseling people
[42:16] around the world, I've counseledled many
[42:20] that were dealing with extreme
[42:22] loneliness and sadness and depression
[42:27] because they were married.
[42:29] because they married the wrong one.
[42:33] So, let me encourage you tonight, young
[42:35] people.
[42:37] Remember that God is the one who brought
[42:40] you on the earth. And just as God
[42:43] ordained Rebecca for Isaac, God has, if
[42:48] you're sisters, God has your Isaac or
[42:51] Jim or Joe or Fred or Bartholomew or
[42:54] whatever he's called. He's somewhere on
[42:57] the earth. And if you're a brother, he's
[43:00] got your Sally, your Suzie, your Carol,
[43:03] your, you know, Beth or whatever it is.
[43:06] So, don't let Satan trip you up with
[43:09] your anxiety and your frustration and
[43:13] your worry. But what you need to do is
[43:16] get on them knees, sir. And pray that
[43:19] old boy right into your life.
[43:20] Hallelujah. or pray that young sister
[43:24] right into your life and believe that
[43:27] the same God that was mindful. Now
[43:29] remember Elizer had this stress placed
[43:33] upon him and he's under a great load and
[43:36] responsibility. How did he go about
[43:39] doing this? He prayed about it. And what
[43:42] did he do once he felt like that God was
[43:46] answering his prayer? The Bible tells
[43:49] us, of course, in the following verses
[43:51] that he bowed his head and he worshiped
[43:54] the Lord. Why? Because God had answered
[43:58] his prayer. But God did not love Rebecca
[44:02] or he did not love Isaac a bit more than
[44:06] he loves you young sisters at our church
[44:08] or you young brothers. Is that right?
[44:11] But the thing is that you need and
[44:14] remember you young sisters, God's
[44:16] prophet has taught us that you were
[44:19] actually brought on earth by your
[44:23] husband. Your life has great value. God
[44:29] predestinated you to live in this time
[44:32] frame, in this age, to be identified
[44:36] under this message. Don't you settle for
[44:40] anything less than a prince charming in
[44:45] your life. Amen. You don't have to
[44:47] compromise for some man that's going to
[44:50] treat you like a doormat. That's right.
[44:53] If he does not love you and want to make
[44:57] you the queen of his life, he is not
[45:00] worthy of your love. That's right. My
[45:04] Lord, I thought at least some of the
[45:06] sisters had said, "Amen.
[45:10] That's exactly right, brother Donnie.
[45:12] I'll settle for less. Well, if you do, I
[45:14] feel sorry for you. That if you settle
[45:17] for less, you deserve what you get. So,
[45:21] if you settle for less, you may get a
[45:23] man that'll come to church for a while
[45:25] until he gets you, then he wants to pull
[45:27] you and your kids out of church and
[45:30] never bring you back. Then, sister, if
[45:32] you chose that, you pretty much signed
[45:34] up for it. You made your bed, as we say,
[45:36] lay in it. And it's the same with your
[45:38] brothers when you do the same thing. But
[45:41] don't let Satan try to put that
[45:44] frustration and that doubt and that
[45:46] worry in your mind. I know, you know, a
[45:50] lot of the people around the message,
[45:51] they say, "Well, a lot of these youth
[45:53] camps, they ain't nothing but dating
[45:55] things and they're just there to meet
[45:57] boys and girls." Well, first of all,
[45:59] that's a lie. I know the brothers that
[46:01] hold a lot of these youth camps, and
[46:03] they never talk about people meeting
[46:06] people. They're there for what? People
[46:08] to get filled with the Holy Ghost,
[46:10] people to get healed, people to get
[46:12] delivered, people to get sanctified. But
[46:15] there have been some that have met their
[46:16] mate there. And there's nothing wrong
[46:19] with that as long as you put God first.
[46:22] Is that right? But the most important
[46:25] thing, the reason we go to any meeting
[46:27] is to be able to receive something from
[46:29] the hand of God. But there is nothing
[46:32] wrong while you're there if you see a
[46:35] young lady filled with the Holy Ghost
[46:36] and you want to get her name and her
[46:38] address and whatever more as long as her
[46:41] father approves of it. Nothing wrong
[46:42] with that. But remember, we do not
[46:46] believe that we have to compromise where
[46:49] we stand on God's word to be able to get
[46:52] a mate or a companion. God has one that
[46:56] you're ordained to be with. This is the
[46:59] way I preach it and look at it. God
[47:01] ordained person A to be married to
[47:04] person D and he ordained person B to be
[47:09] married to person C. But if God can mess
[47:12] up one of those people and person A
[47:16] winds up marrying person C, you've
[47:19] automatically got four people out of the
[47:22] will of God. So you see your choice in
[47:26] life can not only affect you. It can
[47:29] affect your sisters, your brothers, your
[47:32] mama, your daddy, your pastor. It can
[47:35] affect also person B, C, and D. Is that
[47:40] right? So it's so important because
[47:43] we're a body move. Will it change our
[47:46] destiny in life? No, it won't. It won't
[47:49] change your destiny. If you get the
[47:51] wrong one here, you get the right one
[47:53] over there. But boy, it can be a whole
[47:55] lot happier if you get the right one
[47:57] here. You want to know why I know that?
[48:00] Cuz I got the right one. And there's a
[48:02] lot of other people here. I hope.
[48:06] I hope. Well, there's three or four
[48:08] here. They feel like they I feel sorry
[48:10] for all the rest of you that got the
[48:12] wrong one. Glory to God. You're going to
[48:13] be shouting in the millennium ain't you?
[48:16] But whenever you have that and you know
[48:18] how wonderful it can be, then you
[48:20] certainly don't want our children, our
[48:22] grandchildren, or even our church family
[48:25] settling for less than what God has for
[48:29] you. Now listen sis and I will talk when
[48:32] Carol and I will meet with some of our
[48:34] young sisters and they're going through
[48:35] that stage in life and I will tell them
[48:38] by the time they get done listening to
[48:40] me it's a wonder their head will even
[48:42] come outside that door because I want to
[48:45] build them up so high. I want to make
[48:49] them a princess. I want to make them a
[48:51] daughter of God. I want to build them up
[48:54] so much in what God wants them to be
[48:58] because I want them to have that view of
[49:00] themsel as a daughter of God because if
[49:04] they don't view themsel that way,
[49:06] they'll settle for just about anything.
[49:09] But if they can see who they are, they
[49:12] are a part of royalty. You know, it must
[49:16] have took some time for Rebecca to be
[49:19] changed from what she was as it did the
[49:22] Schulamite. And how was that performed?
[49:25] By messengers that was sent from the
[49:28] presence of Solomon. And they had this
[49:30] long journey as Eiza was going to travel
[49:34] between 450 and 500 miles back,
[49:38] traveling only during the day and
[49:41] resting during the night. What do you
[49:42] think they talk about? The Israeli stock
[49:45] exchange, the Moab stock exchange that's
[49:48] talking about Babylonian gold and
[49:51] Babylonian converters and Babylonian
[49:54] whatever more. I imagine she wanted to
[49:56] hear more and more and more about her
[49:59] future husband. Well, praise the Lord.
[50:02] And listen, young sisters, if you go to
[50:04] talking to a boy from Canada or one from
[50:07] Ohio or one from Indiana, don't you be
[50:11] afraid to ask questions. Ask his pastor
[50:14] about him. Ask his mama about him. Ask
[50:18] his daddy about him. Come on, somebody.
[50:21] Why? Because you'd be better off to know
[50:23] them answers now than after you've been
[50:26] married for 6 months and wish you'd have
[50:28] asked them answers a while back.
[50:31] So, it's the same thing with Eleazar.
[50:34] He's asking these questions and he's
[50:37] setting up the scenario and he's not
[50:39] going to give her the answers. She
[50:41] doesn't know exactly what he's doing.
[50:44] So, he's going to present to her the
[50:47] cuba, which is the marriage contract,
[50:50] and he wants to see what kind of woman
[50:53] that he's going to take back. Well, you
[50:55] know, to be honest with you, I want to
[50:57] do the same thing to my Lord Jesus. I
[51:01] want to find out what kind of woman is
[51:03] coming to church here. I want to find
[51:05] out what kind of people are we dealing
[51:08] with. Are we dealing with a bunch of
[51:10] babies, a bunch of babies that if you
[51:12] preach on them, they pout, they won't
[51:15] come back to church? Are we dealing with
[51:17] a bunch of people that, you know,
[51:19] they're they they love the message, but
[51:21] they want to be led a sin, so they still
[51:23] want to smoke and drink and hold on to
[51:25] the things of the world. And then you
[51:27] expect me as a pastor, me laboring for
[51:30] years of my life and decades of my life
[51:33] of preaching the gospel. And you want me
[51:36] to stand there with you that day and
[51:38] present you with the trophies of this
[51:41] age when we align under the prophet who
[51:44] will stand there and represent the
[51:46] leader of this entire age. And you want
[51:48] me to preach a watered down gospel?
[51:50] Well, Lord, word of life. They couldn't
[51:52] take hard preaching because it was just
[51:55] so hard for them. And that they they
[51:56] wanted me to be easy and they wanted me
[51:59] to be gentle. Is that what y'all want me
[52:00] to be? Well, you got the wrong man. I'm
[52:02] telling you that tonight. If I have to
[52:04] burn you every night when we come to
[52:06] church and we have to hand out band-aids
[52:09] and wrap up your old hide in it, so be
[52:12] it. But if I can be able to present
[52:15] somebody out of this church that'll be a
[52:17] part of the bride of Jesus Christ, I
[52:20] will feel like I have not preached in
[52:22] vain. I've not studied in vain. I've not
[52:25] labored in vain. But I've done it with
[52:28] all of my heart. I've give it my best.
[52:30] When I stand before the Lord, I don't
[52:33] want no reward. I don't want no pat on
[52:36] the back, but to see somebody out of our
[52:39] assembly that'll be able to walk up
[52:41] before the Lord Jesus and him be able to
[52:44] take you by the hand and walk down the
[52:47] streets of go through eternity. It'll be
[52:49] worth everything I've gone through.
[52:52] It'll be worth everything the deacon
[52:54] brothers and the ministering brothers,
[52:56] all of us have gone through to try to
[52:58] help you go through the problems of
[53:01] life. Well, I feel like preaching to you
[53:03] tonight. Why? Because we're not laboring
[53:05] for a reward. We're not laboring so the
[53:08] angels can say, "Oh, there's so and so
[53:10] and there's so and so. I labor for one
[53:14] thing, and that is my love for the
[53:16] almighty God, for the purpose that he's
[53:19] called me. Oh, I could have had a much
[53:21] easier life as many of you could have
[53:23] had an easier life living out there in
[53:26] the world. But who in the world wants to
[53:28] do that whenever at any day you could
[53:31] leave this world and be lost without
[53:33] God? Give me the way of the Lord's
[53:36] despised few. Give me the way that is
[53:39] talked about, hated, run down. When
[53:41] people don't love you, that's all right.
[53:43] That comes with it. But oh my, when I
[53:46] stand before him that day and I walk up,
[53:49] I want to turn around and see some of
[53:52] you standing there behind me and say,
[53:54] "Brother Donnie, we're standing with
[53:56] you, brother. Thank you for preaching
[53:58] the truth. Thank you, brother Donnie.
[54:00] You preached us out of the world. You
[54:02] spared us out of the tribulation
[54:04] period." And we turn around to the
[54:06] minister brothers and say, "Thank you,
[54:09] brothers, for dealing with our young
[54:11] people. Thank you, Sunday school
[54:13] teachers. Thank you. You was able to
[54:15] help us along the way. And now here we
[54:19] are going to be presented as the bride
[54:22] of Christ.
[54:25] Hallelujah.
[54:31] So, as I mentioned to you last Wednesday
[54:34] night, the bride doesn't actually give
[54:37] any gifts to the bridegroom.
[54:41] It's one-sided.
[54:43] He gives her the gifts. The father of
[54:48] the bridegroom gives her gifts. And her
[54:51] father gives her gifts.
[54:54] She doesn't give them gifts. To the
[54:57] father of the bridegroom, nor to the
[55:00] bridegroom, nor to her own father. Don't
[55:04] you understand why? Why are they giving
[55:06] her gifts? It's the way they look at her
[55:10] that she was so valuable. Yes, sir. The
[55:13] father and the mother of the bridegroom
[55:16] look at this girl and they look at her
[55:19] as such an asset. Oh, I I I believe this
[55:23] will probably be part of the bride going
[55:26] home when she recognizes who she is.
[55:30] And to know that the moar which is the
[55:33] bride price that within itself speaks of
[55:37] the value that we will bring into the
[55:40] circle of eternity that the Lord God
[55:44] lived by himself but he did not like to
[55:47] be alone. He did not want to stay in the
[55:50] garden of Eden alone. He had come down
[55:52] every day to be with Adam and Eve in the
[55:54] Garden of Eden. He knew what it was like
[55:57] when he was there by himself and he
[56:00] didn't want to be alone no more. So if
[56:02] Adam and Eve could not stay in the
[56:04] Garden of Eden, God said, "If you cannot
[56:07] stay here, I don't want to be here
[56:08] either." Oh my. So what did he do? He
[56:11] drove them out and he himself left. He
[56:15] has never been back yet, but he's fixing
[56:18] to. Praise be to God. Eden is fixing to
[56:22] be restored again. When will it be? At
[56:25] the dawn of the seventh morning.
[56:28] Whenever the rapture takes place and the
[56:31] hell that'll be spread out on this earth
[56:33] during the tribulation period while
[56:35] we're enjoying the marriage supper of
[56:36] the lamb. But it won't be very long as
[56:39] it were a moment for us. And we will
[56:41] come back down and take this earth over
[56:44] for a thousand years. And we will rule
[56:46] and reign with Christ and the asset that
[56:49] you have got. He looked at the
[56:51] crucifixion. He looked at them spitting
[56:54] in his face. He looked at them taking
[56:57] his clothes off of him and making him an
[56:59] open shame. But he kept you before every
[57:02] bit of that. He kept you. If you look at
[57:05] living for Jesus and you say, "Well, the
[57:08] world could do this and the world could
[57:09] do that. Oh, I've got to give up
[57:11] smoking. I got to give up this." A
[57:13] person that looks at it that way ain't
[57:15] never fell in love with God. If you ever
[57:17] fall in love with him, there is not one
[57:20] thing out here or an accumulation of
[57:23] three trillion things that could ever
[57:25] outweigh the love of God, which is
[57:29] crying Christ Jesus our Lord.
[57:33] Oh, hallelujah.
[57:35] But part of the bride's part of the cuba
[57:39] as I closed out with us last Wednesday
[57:41] night was an undistracted devotion that
[57:45] is given to her Lord which is unlike
[57:49] anything else. Now we know that we are a
[57:51] multiaceted being whenever we become
[57:54] born again. So a part of us is heavenly
[57:58] and yet there's two parts of us that is
[58:00] still very very earthly and can be very
[58:02] carnal sometimes and that is our flesh
[58:05] and our spirit. Our subconscious of
[58:07] course our conscience and then the mind
[58:09] also can be able to pull in negative
[58:11] things and things that'll get us down
[58:13] and all that. But on the inside once we
[58:16] receive the Holy Ghost that is God's
[58:18] part of eternal life given to you which
[58:21] is your eternal possession never be
[58:23] taken from you. And yet whenever we
[58:27] receive that we want to turn around and
[58:29] say okay Lord now what do you want me to
[58:31] do? What do you want me to be for you?
[58:34] You know myself the way I look at it I
[58:36] don't want to be if God wants me to be
[58:38] that big. And when I say that big, I
[58:40] mean my ministry, my life, what I'm
[58:43] supposed to do, who I'm supposed to
[58:44] affect. If God wants me to be that big,
[58:47] then I don't want to be that big. My
[58:49] problem has never wanting to be bigger
[58:51] than what God wants me to be, I want to
[58:54] be less, which is just as wrong as the
[58:57] man who wants to be bigger than what God
[59:00] allocated for him to be. Either way we
[59:02] go, when our mind sets toward the wrong
[59:05] size, it displeases God. So the thing
[59:08] you and I should want to be is exactly
[59:12] what God thought of us before the world
[59:14] began. If God wants you to be say the
[59:17] size of a period in a sentence or a
[59:20] comma or a semicolon or a question mark
[59:23] or a parenthesis or whatever, but say
[59:25] God thinks of somebody else, he wants
[59:28] them to be the size of this pulpit. He
[59:30] thinks of somebody else. He wants their
[59:32] outreach and their ministry, their walk
[59:34] with God to be the size of this
[59:36] building. somebody else the size of
[59:38] Johnson City. Somebody else the size of
[59:40] Tennessee, somebody else the size of the
[59:42] United States. Somebody else the size of
[59:45] Russia say. And God thinks that way.
[59:47] Well, we should not be jealous of the
[59:50] man. That is a whole sentence and we're
[59:52] just a period. For after all, if you
[59:55] ain't got a period at the end of the
[59:57] sentence, you don't know when to stop.
[59:59] And if you don't have a comma, then you
[1:00:01] pause. Oh, all of those fill their spot.
[1:00:04] And you may think, "I'm so
[1:00:06] insignificant." A period is not
[1:00:09] insignificant. A question mark is not
[1:00:12] insignificant. A comma is Oh, I wish
[1:00:15] somebody would preach with me tonight. A
[1:00:17] comma is not insignificant. It has great
[1:00:21] significance. Is that right?
[1:00:25] Oh my. So, the bride must not be
[1:00:28] distracted. distracted with who we are,
[1:00:32] what we are, what we're supposed to be,
[1:00:34] and false doctrine around us, and all
[1:00:36] kinds of things that Satan will put up
[1:00:39] before us, and the troubles of the
[1:00:40] world. Can we not see what's going on in
[1:00:43] the world? Can we not see? Even look at
[1:00:46] our nation and realize that we're
[1:00:47] teetering right now on the verge of
[1:00:50] possibly attacking Iran with a B2
[1:00:53] stealth bomber with a bunker buster
[1:00:55] weighing 30,000 lbs a piece.
[1:00:58] and annihilate him with the ability to
[1:01:01] go down into the earth 250 to 300 ft
[1:01:07] and explode and be able to go through
[1:01:10] hundreds of feet of solid reinforced
[1:01:13] concrete.
[1:01:15] Friends, it is scary when you look and
[1:01:18] see what man has broke into. I'm so glad
[1:01:21] my hope is not in that. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:01:26] Oh, glory to God. And yet we realize
[1:01:29] that one day I told Carol I said, "You
[1:01:31] know, we was looking at some of the news
[1:01:33] and and the things you get on your phone
[1:01:35] every day. It can be pretty pretty sad
[1:01:37] and depressing sometimes, can't it?" But
[1:01:39] yet you realize I told her the other
[1:01:41] night, I said, "It's no wonder that
[1:01:43] America, that beast of Revelation 13
[1:01:47] will have to be destroyed because if
[1:01:50] America would not be destroyed, Israel
[1:01:52] would never be able to be, you know,
[1:01:55] come against with all the nations of the
[1:01:56] world." Who can make war with thee
[1:02:00] beast? Who can make war with them? So
[1:02:03] America speaks. Israel does what they
[1:02:05] tell them to do. America speaks. Other
[1:02:07] nations of the world does that. What is
[1:02:10] it? It's that image that John saw on the
[1:02:13] aisle of Patmas. But remember the last
[1:02:16] thing the prophet of God saw in that
[1:02:18] vision was America. Nothing but just
[1:02:21] ashes and heaps of burning smolders.
[1:02:25] How could any nation of the earth ever
[1:02:29] come against Israel as long as America
[1:02:32] is standing here for her? God bless her
[1:02:34] for standing with her, but her days are
[1:02:36] numbered. That's right. And we know how
[1:02:38] it is that the nations of the world hate
[1:02:41] them. More resolutions been brought by
[1:02:43] the UN against Israel than all the rest
[1:02:47] of the nations put together. Put
[1:02:50] together. Why? What is it? It's a
[1:02:52] pre-tribulation anointing. And we've got
[1:02:54] people in our own nation carrying around
[1:02:57] Mexican flags and Palestinian flags, all
[1:03:00] kinds of other flags and claim to be
[1:03:02] America. I say if they love Mexico that
[1:03:05] well, send them back where they come
[1:03:07] from. If they love if they love the PLO
[1:03:10] and all the rest of them, let them go
[1:03:12] back over to Hamas. But I'll tell you
[1:03:14] what they'll do to some of these bobbed
[1:03:16] painted fair shortwearing women. They'll
[1:03:18] skin them alive. I'll tell you what
[1:03:20] they'll do to the LGBTQ Y330405.
[1:03:25] They'll put them up on the top of some
[1:03:27] of them buildings and push them off.
[1:03:30] Well, come on, somebody. Let's have
[1:03:32] church tonight.
[1:03:33] [Applause]
[1:03:35] Hallelujah.
[1:03:37] But what is it? It's in our nation. Our
[1:03:39] nation, the prophet told us in the 60s
[1:03:42] it was eat up with communism. It didn't
[1:03:45] look like it then, but it's coming out
[1:03:46] now. Yeah, mama. Can we keep from
[1:03:50] hearing these things? Of course not. But
[1:03:53] that's not what determines our joy. It's
[1:03:56] a shame that us Christians are so
[1:03:59] affected by things that are around us
[1:04:01] everywhere. as if the power of the cross
[1:04:05] no longer has effect to find children of
[1:04:08] God that can still have joy in the Lord
[1:04:10] and peace in the time of trouble and
[1:04:12] stability instead of being as shaky as a
[1:04:15] leaf on a tree and up and down. I say
[1:04:18] it's a crying shame. We ought to be
[1:04:20] witnesses that Jesus Christ can comfort
[1:04:24] a heart right in the middle of trouble.
[1:04:26] Right in the middle of Leadyia, we can
[1:04:28] have peace that passes understanding. We
[1:04:31] can have joy. We can still have a praise
[1:04:34] in our heart. We can still have a praise
[1:04:36] in our soul that makes us raise our
[1:04:39] hands instead of crossing arms.
[1:04:42] [Applause]
[1:04:49] So God don't want us to be distracted.
[1:04:56] We're in a relationship.
[1:05:00] So you brothers that are married,
[1:05:02] tell me how it would be in your home if
[1:05:05] you get so distracted with work.
[1:05:10] So before your wife gets up in the
[1:05:11] morning, you're gone. You're gone all
[1:05:14] day.
[1:05:16] Your kids come in from school, if you
[1:05:18] got kids, you don't ever see them. You
[1:05:20] don't ever speak to them because God's
[1:05:22] blessing you so much.
[1:05:25] You've got so much business and the
[1:05:26] blessing of God. I wonder. Come on. I
[1:05:29] said I wonder. I wonder what's going to
[1:05:32] happen to your relationship, much less
[1:05:35] your walk with God. You think your wife
[1:05:38] is honestly going to be able to say,
[1:05:39] "Well, we're closer than we've ever
[1:05:41] been." Well, if you had that kind of
[1:05:43] husband, I say shame on you that you're
[1:05:45] closer when he's gone away from you.
[1:05:48] Oh my. What ought it to be then with the
[1:05:50] Lord Jesus. It ought to be as we are
[1:05:54] nearing his coming that the influence of
[1:05:58] his own spirit ought not just to be here
[1:06:01] in church but it ought to be every day
[1:06:04] of our life that we are so affected by
[1:06:07] him that sure the world is around us and
[1:06:10] sure it's bad but I'm talking about some
[1:06:13] really good news tonight remember the
[1:06:15] meaning of the word gospel is good news
[1:06:18] and let me tell you in leisia it's Still
[1:06:22] good news. Jesus is coming again. In the
[1:06:25] middle of a perspective war going to
[1:06:27] fixing to happen, there's still good
[1:06:29] news. This might be the last one before
[1:06:32] the bride goes home. Hallelujah. This
[1:06:35] might be the last trial that you go
[1:06:37] through. Brother Donnie, I'm in the
[1:06:38] middle of a terrible time. But look at
[1:06:41] it this way. This might be the last
[1:06:43] trial you'll ever face in your life. It
[1:06:46] could be that you're fixing to come out
[1:06:48] of there with the greatest victory
[1:06:50] you've ever known before. Hallelujah.
[1:06:52] [Applause]
[1:06:59] Or of course you can sit around like
[1:07:02] brother J used to say, "Wowly wowy woo."
[1:07:08] I can't say it like he could. I mean,
[1:07:10] nobody had it down like him. Right
[1:07:14] now, I wonder how that makes her husband
[1:07:15] feel.
[1:07:20] Cuz you see his matan
[1:07:23] matan,
[1:07:25] a matan was a gift or gifts
[1:07:30] that the bridegroom would give the
[1:07:32] bride.
[1:07:36] And you know what? I ain't found nowhere
[1:07:38] where our bridegroom gave us a frown.
[1:07:43] I'm I'm open for correction, of course.
[1:07:46] I've not found anywhere where our
[1:07:49] bridegroom said that you'll never have
[1:07:51] no peace. You'll never have no joy. If
[1:07:54] you come to me, you'll be sad every day
[1:07:56] of your life and you're going to hate me
[1:07:58] and hate people and hate church and
[1:08:00] especially hate preachers. Oh my
[1:08:02] brother. No, sir. Now, as I said, I'm
[1:08:05] open to correction, of course,
[1:08:10] but I do find our matan contains life,
[1:08:15] joy, peace,
[1:08:18] stress relief, pressure relief, healing
[1:08:22] when we're sick, and if it's our time to
[1:08:24] go home, a real divine healing.
[1:08:28] Amen. Now, you see, one of the things
[1:08:30] that the bride will prove to her husband
[1:08:36] is the anticipation
[1:08:38] and waiting for his return.
[1:08:42] Listen to the way Paul addresses it in 2
[1:08:44] Timothy 4:8. Henceforth there is laid up
[1:08:47] for me a crown of righteousness, which
[1:08:50] the Lord, the righteous judge, shall
[1:08:54] give me at that day, and not to me only,
[1:08:58] but unto all them also that love.
[1:09:08] So they're not wanting Jesus to come
[1:09:10] just to end their problems.
[1:09:13] They're not just want Jesus to come to
[1:09:15] issue their debts and you know that that
[1:09:18] they they love his appearing fenero his
[1:09:23] manifestation
[1:09:25] his appearing coming into a tangible
[1:09:28] form because the only way they've known
[1:09:30] him has been by spirit but they long for
[1:09:33] the day and wait for the day when they
[1:09:36] will be able to see their lord in a
[1:09:39] physical corporal body.
[1:09:42] Oh, I don't know about you. I long for
[1:09:43] that. Our friends, notice it. Unto all
[1:09:46] them also that love his appearing. How
[1:09:51] many loves the appearing of the Lord?
[1:09:53] Well, I don't mind telling you, I love
[1:09:55] it even in church, too, because this
[1:09:57] word right here can not only mean the
[1:09:59] physical corporal body, but it can mean
[1:10:02] the manifestation. He's right here
[1:10:03] tonight. I I love it. That's one reason
[1:10:06] I love to come to church. It's not that
[1:10:07] I don't love being around you and love
[1:10:09] seeing you and and we do do that. We
[1:10:11] enjoy that. But what I love even greater
[1:10:13] than that is the anticipation to see
[1:10:15] what's he going to do tonight. I wonder
[1:10:17] how he's going to move in the service
[1:10:19] and what's he going to do. I love his
[1:10:22] appearing even if he appears with a
[1:10:24] paddle in his hand and he's heading
[1:10:26] straight for me. And I'm thinking, "Oh
[1:10:29] boy, I'm in for it tonight." Oh boy. But
[1:10:31] I say, "Glory to God. Thank you, Lord
[1:10:33] Jesus." It means I'm a son cuz he don't
[1:10:37] correct serpent seed that way. He's
[1:10:39] dealing with me as a child of God. Those
[1:10:42] whom he loved. He chasenneth as a father
[1:10:45] loves his son. Aren't you glad you get
[1:10:47] whipped? Aren't you glad you get
[1:10:50] corrected? Don't you notice that? If you
[1:10:52] was serpent seed, he would never correct
[1:10:55] you. And it shows you're a son or
[1:10:57] daughter of God because you can take
[1:10:59] correction.
[1:11:02] Oh God, help me to always be able to do
[1:11:04] that. Now what? So the bride, no gifts
[1:11:09] now, no gifts, but obedience, loyalty,
[1:11:14] and she's set apart from the time that
[1:11:18] she accepts the cuba, the marriage
[1:11:22] contract.
[1:11:24] She's set aside.
[1:11:26] She's the same as being married.
[1:11:31] And actually, she is in an invisible
[1:11:33] union.
[1:11:38] Now you see this is what Rebecca each
[1:11:40] one of these steps that's what Rebecca
[1:11:43] is doing. She is uniting to her
[1:11:45] bridegroom that she's never physically
[1:11:48] seen yet. Amen.
[1:11:51] Now you see part of that would be Amen.
[1:11:55] our washing of the mikvah.
[1:12:00] The mikvah. Look here in 1 Corinthians
[1:12:03] chapter 6 verse 10. nor thieves, nor
[1:12:06] covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers,
[1:12:08] nor extortioners shall inherit the
[1:12:11] kingdom of God. And such were some of
[1:12:15] you. Now, friends, we know God, some of
[1:12:17] God's people had a very, very bad past.
[1:12:20] But that's exactly what it is in the
[1:12:23] past. And if you've come through that
[1:12:25] blood and the Lord God has accepted you
[1:12:28] and gave you back his token life, there
[1:12:31] is not one thing against you. Amen. I
[1:12:34] wish somebody would say amen to that.
[1:12:37] Now, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor
[1:12:39] drunkards, nor revilers, nor
[1:12:40] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[1:12:42] of God. And such were some of you, but
[1:12:46] ye are washed. Ye are sanctified. He
[1:12:52] gazeo hallow be holy to separate from
[1:12:57] profane things and dedicate to God to
[1:13:02] consecrate to pure to purify but ye are
[1:13:06] justified in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:13:09] and by the spirit of our God. So
[1:13:13] whenever they felt let me read you just
[1:13:15] a little bit about history here about
[1:13:16] the wedding part. When they felt they
[1:13:19] were getting close, the bride would go
[1:13:22] through the ritual
[1:13:24] of immersion
[1:13:27] which is called mikvah. It signified
[1:13:30] listen the passing of the old and the
[1:13:35] coming force of the new.
[1:13:38] So she would go down in the water and it
[1:13:42] was signifying the death to that stage
[1:13:46] of her life. She's no longer a single
[1:13:48] woman. Now listen, he don't know her
[1:13:51] yet. He's not even seen her yet in this
[1:13:54] instance. But yet, whenever she accepts
[1:13:56] the cuba, the marriage contract, then
[1:13:59] she will go into the mikvah and she will
[1:14:03] be immersed in water in the name of the
[1:14:06] Lord Jesus Christ. Of course. Amen.
[1:14:10] That's why every person that's baptized
[1:14:12] in the titles of father, son, holy ghost
[1:14:14] had not yet entered into the cuba
[1:14:17] contract with God.
[1:14:19] That's why many of us that were baptized
[1:14:21] in them titles had to be rebaptized
[1:14:24] again.
[1:14:26] Is that right? So the name is what
[1:14:29] remits that to the power of the name. So
[1:14:33] what it would be then the person had to
[1:14:36] be strictly clean and completely
[1:14:39] immersed and mitvah is the same word as
[1:14:44] baptism.
[1:14:46] So notice then when we come to the Lord
[1:14:48] Jesus and he deals with our heart and we
[1:14:51] accept the atonement and we repent and
[1:14:53] make things right then what do we do? We
[1:14:56] take them up here and we baptize them.
[1:14:58] But remember it's also like the priests
[1:15:00] in the Old Testament. And whenever Moses
[1:15:03] told them to build a labor, and the
[1:15:06] labor was not in the Holy of Holies, but
[1:15:09] the labor was in the outer court.
[1:15:11] Anybody remember what the labor was made
[1:15:13] out of? It was made out of the women's
[1:15:17] mirrors.
[1:15:18] So, the women donated their mirrors that
[1:15:22] they would comb their hair and brush
[1:15:24] their teeth and whatever more. the women
[1:15:27] donated their metal mirrors and they
[1:15:30] melted them down and then they made this
[1:15:34] great big labor and it had a spot as we
[1:15:38] would say on the bottom of it. So when
[1:15:40] the priest was out there he when he come
[1:15:43] into his office of priesthood and Moses
[1:15:45] was alive Moses washed each priest
[1:15:51] sir. Well why in the world would he have
[1:15:53] to do that? You how many baths you
[1:15:54] reckon they took? They know how to take
[1:15:56] a bath,
[1:15:58] but they could not have a prophetic bath
[1:16:01] by themsel.
[1:16:04] What is it? They are submitting. They're
[1:16:07] humbling themselves to an authority that
[1:16:10] is greater than them. Now, the prophet
[1:16:13] would take and wash them down. Amen.
[1:16:18] They never had to have that done again.
[1:16:21] One time done it. Well, glory. But
[1:16:24] remember then whenever they walked out
[1:16:26] here in the world and they'd have to
[1:16:28] walk from their tents over to the
[1:16:29] tabernacle going here and there and
[1:16:31] there and they would get dust all over
[1:16:34] their feet and all over their limbs. So
[1:16:36] this labor was on the outside. God did
[1:16:39] not want them coming into his presence
[1:16:42] dusty and dirty and filthy. Oh, I wish
[1:16:45] every preacher around this message could
[1:16:47] understand God wants us as ministers to
[1:16:50] be clean from arrogance, clean from
[1:16:53] pride, clean from stubbornness. Come on,
[1:16:56] somebody. Any preachers here? Say amen
[1:16:58] to that.
[1:17:01] Oh my. So what did they do? They would
[1:17:04] come in and take their foot. They could
[1:17:07] not touch it with their hand. Take their
[1:17:10] foot and kick it. And then they would
[1:17:13] start washing washing. Then once the
[1:17:17] water started flowing, couldn't be a
[1:17:20] sister. Now the water had to flow.
[1:17:24] Once the water started flowing, then
[1:17:26] they could take their hands and start
[1:17:28] washing their limbs and washing their
[1:17:31] feet and washing their hands. And what
[1:17:33] are they doing the whole time while
[1:17:34] that's going on? Oh, I don't know
[1:17:39] him.
[1:17:41] So they're praising. They're worshiping.
[1:17:44] Why? Their lives is fixing to be spared.
[1:17:48] Cuz if they walk in behind that veil
[1:17:50] right there dirty, God's going to kill
[1:17:52] them dead on a hammer. Remember, they'd
[1:17:55] tie a rope around their waist and they'd
[1:17:58] have a pomegranate and a bail, a
[1:18:00] pomegranate and a bell on the bottom of
[1:18:02] their garments. One way they knew they
[1:18:04] was alive because there's a noise going
[1:18:07] on back there. Yeah. And when you and I
[1:18:09] lose our noise, somebody stole our
[1:18:11] victory.
[1:18:14] Praise the Lord. That's one way they
[1:18:16] knew that they were alive. Now, if God
[1:18:19] accepted the high priest, God accepted
[1:18:21] them. So, the individuals are depending
[1:18:23] on the behavior of this man. They're
[1:18:26] depending upon his sanctity before God.
[1:18:29] And you remember there was some sons
[1:18:31] that offered a strange fire one time and
[1:18:33] God killed them at the altar. Is that
[1:18:36] right? So here they were. Now they must
[1:18:39] be immersed every time that they come in
[1:18:43] there to offer a sacrifice or even to
[1:18:46] change out the loaves, which they had 12
[1:18:48] loaves, which is called the the sheer
[1:18:50] bread or the bread of his face, the
[1:18:51] bread of his presence. Each one of them
[1:18:53] represented a tribe. Everything they
[1:18:56] would do, they had to be washed. They
[1:18:59] had to be washed. Can you imagine
[1:19:00] friends where we'd be today if it was
[1:19:03] not for the washing of the water by the
[1:19:05] word and we got washed when we got saved
[1:19:08] and God never give us any more
[1:19:10] sanctifying process. No more mitvah when
[1:19:13] we come to church. Oh my. Aren't you
[1:19:16] glad we can come to the house of God?
[1:19:22] Most of you don't drink and curse. At
[1:19:25] least I hope you don't. You don't smoke.
[1:19:28] You don't run around with somebody
[1:19:29] else's wife and you don't do a lot of
[1:19:32] these things out here that the people of
[1:19:33] the world do but you're around them and
[1:19:37] you have to deal with them as business
[1:19:38] people. You ever feel contaminated by
[1:19:41] them? You ever feel brother Fred just
[1:19:44] been out there amongst them and things
[1:19:46] they say and what they do and you know
[1:19:48] all that sort of saying oh but you've
[1:19:50] got a place where you can be able to
[1:19:53] come into the presence of God and be
[1:19:55] washed by the water of the word. You
[1:19:58] don't need to get received. You don't
[1:20:00] need to get the Holy Ghost again. You
[1:20:02] just need another immersion.
[1:20:04] [Music]
[1:20:05] Praise God.
[1:20:08] Praise God. Then we have the legal
[1:20:12] rights
[1:20:14] to be betrothed.
[1:20:17] What's this in painted face Jezebel?
[1:20:20] This is one thing I love about Brother
[1:20:22] Brandon being a graduate of Harvard and
[1:20:24] a graduate of Bob Jones University. and
[1:20:27] all these great schools where he got his
[1:20:29] degrees. I love some of these titles.
[1:20:32] Painted face Jezebel. You can imagine
[1:20:34] the smiley preacher from Texas title one
[1:20:36] of his sermons that he'd call her the
[1:20:39] lovely woman Jezebel. Cuz we're not here
[1:20:42] to to condemn anybody. We're here to
[1:20:45] just say God loves everybody. And God
[1:20:47] wants you as you are. And God Yeah. He
[1:20:50] wants you as you are so he can cleanse
[1:20:51] you and make you like he wants you to
[1:20:52] be.
[1:20:56] God won't leave you the way he found you
[1:20:58] as long as you don't want him to. But if
[1:21:00] you want him to, he'll leave you just
[1:21:02] like you are.
[1:21:05] Oh my. Watch this. He said, "Does the
[1:21:07] word make you feel like you're scoured
[1:21:11] out?"
[1:21:15] It does me. Hearing the word just
[1:21:19] cleanses me out.
[1:21:21] It just makes me a new person.
[1:21:27] Does it you that way? Now look at the
[1:21:31] word that he uses scour
[1:21:36] which is they used to have scouring
[1:21:38] pads. They call them things different
[1:21:40] now. Y'all remember the SO E SSO and you
[1:21:43] know the scratch ones and but they're
[1:21:46] they're not lamb's wool
[1:21:49] and they're not this same type of stuff
[1:21:51] you would I definitely wouldn't want to
[1:21:53] use a scratch pad to wipe the sweat from
[1:21:55] my face less my sweat become as great
[1:21:58] drops of blood
[1:22:00] but sometimes I need to be scrubbed
[1:22:06] sir and I'm gonna go ahead and say for
[1:22:08] the rest of you all do
[1:22:10] Amen. Yes, sir. Yes, we do. And the word
[1:22:14] will scour you. Not sour you, but scour
[1:22:20] you. So, you fix something, sisters, and
[1:22:23] you know, maybe it's apples. Carol does
[1:22:25] a tremendous job in fixing fried apples.
[1:22:27] And but sometimes the sugars inside of
[1:22:30] those apples and she will mix them.
[1:22:32] She'll mix some sweet with some sour
[1:22:34] just to get the right combination. But
[1:22:36] sometimes the sugars on there will
[1:22:38] harden on that skillet and I'll help her
[1:22:41] wash dishes
[1:22:43] and we will have to let it set sometimes
[1:22:46] and then sometimes I'll have to scrape
[1:22:48] it a little bit and sometimes I'll have
[1:22:50] to rub it a little bit. Yeah. Except
[1:22:54] that skillet ain't like some of you that
[1:22:56] don't have hands and eyes and feet and
[1:22:57] all that sort of thing, you know, and
[1:22:59] frowns and stuff. That skillet can't
[1:23:01] frown at you. It can't do anything.
[1:23:02] could just lay there and let you just
[1:23:04] scrub your rub a duba dub and think
[1:23:06] you're the one that did this to me and
[1:23:07] now you're taking the hide off of me cuz
[1:23:09] you wanted them apples. This ain't fair
[1:23:11] none. I mean, I didn't be I wasn't made
[1:23:14] in China to be a skillet so you could
[1:23:16] rub the time out of me. Come on.
[1:23:19] But sometimes we walk in them doors back
[1:23:21] there and we got attitudes and we got
[1:23:24] this and that and the other and God's
[1:23:26] been dealing with your pastor and one of
[1:23:28] these other ministers that comes in to
[1:23:29] preach to us and boy, they got a
[1:23:31] scouring pad in this pocket and they got
[1:23:33] a little bit of this and that and the
[1:23:34] other and that pocket here and there and
[1:23:36] there and boy, they come out and they're
[1:23:37] just as nice and pleasant as they can be
[1:23:40] from the get-go and because they know if
[1:23:42] they tell you what they're going to
[1:23:43] preach, you're going to run off. You,
[1:23:44] oh, I got a cold. I got a bad headache.
[1:23:46] I'll be back tomorrow. So they start out
[1:23:49] real nice and you know just real gentle
[1:23:51] and they reach in the front pocket and
[1:23:53] get the first scar. But I'll tell you
[1:23:55] one thing, we need to do this and they
[1:23:57] say, "Woo! Oh Lord have mercy." That was
[1:24:00] kind of rough, but maybe that's the only
[1:24:02] thing he's going to do. He was just
[1:24:03] getting started. Then he's got to scour
[1:24:06] a little more and scour a little more.
[1:24:07] You say, "Lord have mercy." I don't know
[1:24:09] about you. I've sat in services before.
[1:24:11] I've actually crumpled up my toes in my
[1:24:13] shoes. I don't know why I've done that,
[1:24:15] but I have. I've sat there and I've just
[1:24:17] kind of pulled him up like that, you
[1:24:19] know, because you say the preacher's
[1:24:20] walking on your toe. But you know what?
[1:24:22] I've never done that one time that if
[1:24:24] that man was really sent by the spirit
[1:24:26] of God to bring me correction that I
[1:24:29] wasn't so benefited and so blessed by
[1:24:32] that. Why? Because there was something
[1:24:34] about me that needed to be adjusted. Oh,
[1:24:36] hallelujah. Maybe it's a little bit of
[1:24:39] this or a little bit of that. And I
[1:24:41] didn't yield to that real gentle
[1:24:43] teaching and that real soft worded guy.
[1:24:47] So God would send a John the Baptist.
[1:24:51] And John the Baptist don't know anything
[1:24:54] about Greek or Aramaic or fine fancy
[1:24:57] words. I mean, he don't have a scrub
[1:24:59] pad. He puts in his pocket. He wears it
[1:25:02] out on his back. I mean, it's about a
[1:25:05] 4x4, not 4 in by 4 in, but 4 foot by 4
[1:25:08] foot. He scrubs you on the head. He
[1:25:10] scrubs you behind the ear. He scrubs you
[1:25:12] between the fingers and you saying,
[1:25:14] "Lord God, somebody call 911. I ain't
[1:25:17] going to be able to make it out of
[1:25:18] here." And you endure the whole service
[1:25:20] and then you find yourself feeling a
[1:25:22] little bit better. And you say, "Well,
[1:25:23] actually, I I feel pretty good. Praise
[1:25:26] the Lord. I" And then the singing to
[1:25:28] worship end the service, you say, "Well,
[1:25:29] glory to God. I do feel better." Well,
[1:25:31] it ain't no wonder. Look at all that gum
[1:25:33] laying at your feet. Look at all that
[1:25:35] filth that that scouring pad washed off
[1:25:37] of you. Don't you understand what
[1:25:39] happened? Your Lord Jesus wanted to come
[1:25:41] down and make love to you, but he had to
[1:25:44] have the word of God to scour you a
[1:25:46] little, clean you up.
[1:25:52] Oh,
[1:25:54] notice this. And here you How many feels
[1:25:58] real scoured out
[1:26:02] after the word get a hold of you? You
[1:26:04] feel real good. That's peculiar, ain't
[1:26:07] it? So you get really scoured out and
[1:26:11] you feel real good.
[1:26:14] That's one thing about us message folks
[1:26:16] that the world just don't understand
[1:26:17] because we've had visitors of course
[1:26:19] come and I've heard things that they
[1:26:20] said back. How in the world do you all
[1:26:22] endure that? How do you all take how do
[1:26:24] you put up with that kind of hard
[1:26:26] preaching? I've never heard men preach
[1:26:27] that hard in my life. Do you think
[1:26:29] that's ever service? What are you
[1:26:30] talking about? I mean and I've told you
[1:26:33] before, you want me to preach higher,
[1:26:34] live higher.
[1:26:36] Y'all don't want me to use the scouring
[1:26:38] pack. Live scour free.
[1:26:41] I didn't say shower free. Scour free.
[1:26:45] The cleaner you keep yourself when you
[1:26:48] walk in them doors, the cleaner the
[1:26:50] preachers can preach.
[1:26:54] Come on, brother Donnie. But if you got
[1:26:58] apples all over you and you got pmons
[1:27:00] all over you and whatever more and the
[1:27:02] sugars is all glued together and this
[1:27:05] and that and the Lord said, "No, honey,
[1:27:07] I don't want nothing like that. I want
[1:27:09] you polished like stainless steel." But
[1:27:11] you say, "Lord, I don't like stainless
[1:27:14] steel, but I do. And I'm your husband
[1:27:17] and this is the way I want you to look.
[1:27:20] I don't want you to be honey sweet and
[1:27:22] molasses and sugar pie and moon pies and
[1:27:24] RC that makes you fat and blubbery. I
[1:27:27] want you to be scrubbed down little
[1:27:29] bride. I want you to be able to stand
[1:27:31] before me without a spot, without a
[1:27:34] wrinkle, without any such thing. And
[1:27:37] I've got the way to do it. I'll send my
[1:27:40] man with scouring pads. Call my word.
[1:27:51] Now people think that brother Bram
[1:27:52] didn't believe in feeling
[1:27:55] but he did but I found it amazing
[1:27:58] brother Daryl whenever I went to
[1:27:59] studying on this about scouring and
[1:28:02] scouring you know things like that how
[1:28:04] many times he would use the words feel
[1:28:06] good associated with scouring
[1:28:12] because you understand once you've had
[1:28:13] it done there's a feeling about that
[1:28:17] that it's hard to explain to somebody
[1:28:19] else. Can you imagine people going to
[1:28:22] church for years and the preacher has
[1:28:25] never preached on them and you say,
[1:28:29] "Glory to God, where's that church at?
[1:28:32] It's built right outside the gates of
[1:28:34] hell."
[1:28:37] Cuz that's exactly where it'll take you.
[1:28:41] myself. I can't imagine going to a
[1:28:44] church that I wouldn't be plastered all
[1:28:48] over the wall, God speaking to me
[1:28:50] directly. Would you really want to go to
[1:28:52] a church and attend a church to where
[1:28:54] your faults were never mentioned? Your
[1:28:57] shortcomings are never mentioned. You
[1:28:59] were never corrected. Would you really
[1:29:01] want that kind of church? I'm greatly
[1:29:03] disappointed in you if any of you would
[1:29:05] say that.
[1:29:07] It should be that we say, "God, don't
[1:29:10] make this a scourfree church."
[1:29:14] Amen.
[1:29:17] But a scruba dubdub church.
[1:29:20] I'm scrubbing. These other guys are
[1:29:22] dubdubdub.
[1:29:25] Praise the Lord. If we can get you
[1:29:26] clean, all we'll do shout, shout, shout
[1:29:28] after a while. Jump, jump, jump. And
[1:29:30] what we're trying to get you to is fly,
[1:29:32] fly, fly. will become able to leave this
[1:29:35] world.
[1:29:39] Oh my. How many feels real scoured out
[1:29:42] after the word get a hold of you? You
[1:29:44] feel real good?
[1:29:46] Oh my, I feel religious tonight somehow.
[1:29:52] I really do.
[1:29:56] So after brother Brandham got scoured,
[1:29:59] it made him feel good. It's something
[1:30:02] like God gets in there with a
[1:30:06] It sounds rough. Now, to save time, I
[1:30:11] didn't get all these quotes in in this
[1:30:13] particular setting here because there's
[1:30:14] several of them. And it's talking about
[1:30:16] when he and his brothers was was boys
[1:30:20] and how nasty and filthy their shirts
[1:30:24] would become and around the collar where
[1:30:27] they would sweat so bad and be out and
[1:30:30] be dirty. And you imagine a little
[1:30:31] Kentucky boy, Harry, we can imagine it
[1:30:33] cuz that's the way we was. And brother
[1:30:35] Ram said that his mother would have to
[1:30:38] take them collars and get some soap and
[1:30:41] a scrub brush and start scrubbing.
[1:30:47] Now he likens his mama scrubbing the
[1:30:50] collar to God scrubbing us.
[1:30:56] You imagine his mama said, "I hate
[1:30:58] William Brown.
[1:31:01] I hate Stumpy.
[1:31:04] I hate Donald. I hate I hate him. I hate
[1:31:08] him. I hate him.
[1:31:13] Huh?
[1:31:15] No, sir. Was she doing that? Cuz she
[1:31:17] hated the boys.
[1:31:21] They didn't have much, but she wanted
[1:31:23] them boys to look as good as they could
[1:31:25] look.
[1:31:30] Oh my. It's something like God gets in
[1:31:34] there with a scrub brush.
[1:31:37] I want you to listen what he'll scrub
[1:31:39] out sometimes
[1:31:41] and just scrubs out
[1:31:44] all my disappointments.
[1:31:48] And so here we're not dealing with sins
[1:31:50] and
[1:31:51] temper and some of that stuff but
[1:31:55] disappointments
[1:31:56] and cares.
[1:31:58] Anybody ever get really disappointed in
[1:32:01] life and with people of life?
[1:32:05] Who disappoints you the most? The
[1:32:08] Ayatollah Kani or people you go to
[1:32:11] church with? Come on or people in your
[1:32:15] family?
[1:32:17] people in the message.
[1:32:19] And when we get so disappointed after so
[1:32:22] many times in people, you know what it
[1:32:24] makes us want to do? Pull oursel off and
[1:32:28] away from people and think, you know
[1:32:30] what? It ain't worth dealing with them.
[1:32:32] It ain't worth it. I'll never have
[1:32:35] another friend. And you know who's being
[1:32:37] robbed the most out of those words? You
[1:32:39] are. That's right.
[1:32:42] The easy way is not always God's way.
[1:32:45] Amen. But what you need is a scrub brush
[1:32:49] where God will take that scrub brush and
[1:32:51] scrub your disappointments. Aren't you
[1:32:53] saying, "Well, well, Lord, they're just
[1:32:56] they're just humans and they're just
[1:32:59] like me and they they make mistakes."
[1:33:01] Oh, I so disappointed, Brother Don. He
[1:33:04] he boy, he let me out. I'm so
[1:33:06] disappointed. I just Well, maybe you
[1:33:08] need a good scrubbing. But most of us
[1:33:10] when we get through disappointments, we
[1:33:13] don't want the Lord to give us a scrub
[1:33:15] brush,
[1:33:17] but a handkerchief
[1:33:19] to cry on
[1:33:22] and then poor little thing. Go ahead,
[1:33:25] darling.
[1:33:31] That's it, honey. Have you a tantrum?
[1:33:35] Come on.
[1:33:38] And what's he do? He drags out a big old
[1:33:40] long scrub brush. And I don't mind
[1:33:43] telling you sometimes the ones he's used
[1:33:45] on me is look like them steel wire ones.
[1:33:52] All I see is some of you've had that
[1:33:54] same thing used on you.
[1:33:56] Some of the rest of you still powderpuff
[1:33:58] Christians. You want Jesus to clean your
[1:34:01] ring around the collar
[1:34:04] with a little soft pad.
[1:34:07] like you use for makeup.
[1:34:09] Well, I'm afraid I'm more hard-headed
[1:34:12] than that sometimes.
[1:34:14] Me, too. I don't have a ring around the
[1:34:17] collar, the whole band around my collar
[1:34:19] that way sometimes
[1:34:21] cuz I get so disappointed in people. I
[1:34:24] get so disappointed
[1:34:27] in message preachers,
[1:34:29] big name, great preachers,
[1:34:35] and they like this and like that and
[1:34:37] like that and like that. And you think
[1:34:39] really, really?
[1:34:45] So, you know what I need? I don't need
[1:34:47] to get down. God, I pray may the angels
[1:34:50] of God come down out of heaven and bring
[1:34:52] I'll tell you one thing. Bust their
[1:34:54] hide, Lord. And the Lord said, I'm here,
[1:34:56] Donnie, but I'm here to bust yours and
[1:34:59] not theirs.
[1:35:01] You let me take care of them, and I'm
[1:35:03] going to take care of you, and you need
[1:35:04] to adjust your attitude, boy.
[1:35:09] Amen. Help me, Lord.
[1:35:13] That's right.
[1:35:16] here Jesus. Anybody hiring in your your
[1:35:20] place of employment, I may be out of a
[1:35:21] job after after this.
[1:35:25] Oh my.
[1:35:27] He scrubs out all my disappointments
[1:35:30] and be cares
[1:35:33] and just makes me feel so clean.
[1:35:36] Doesn't it do that to you?
[1:35:39] Just cleans us out. his Holy Spirit
[1:35:41] comes down and sanctifies us and takes
[1:35:44] all the unbelief
[1:35:47] away from us.
[1:35:49] I love the way that brother Brandham
[1:35:51] taught us how to worship. Now, even
[1:35:53] though I was in Pentecost for many years
[1:35:55] of my life, I thought I knew how to
[1:35:58] worship, but I honestly didn't.
[1:36:02] And when a preacher would preach hard,
[1:36:04] it didn't really make you want to stick
[1:36:06] around and worship too much.
[1:36:10] But I had to be reinstructed
[1:36:12] on how to worship. Now to me, the louder
[1:36:14] I was and the more borous I was, that's,
[1:36:17] you know, that's that's that was what it
[1:36:19] was all about. So I'd run, scream, and
[1:36:22] holler and shout and the louder I could
[1:36:23] shout, the greater it was.
[1:36:26] So I was preaching down in Plaum in
[1:36:28] Louisiana one time.
[1:36:30] And that little church was set right
[1:36:32] down in the places that they built up
[1:36:35] sort of like dikes. You know what that
[1:36:36] is? So they take the land and build it
[1:36:38] up high. um to keep the the flooding
[1:36:41] from coming through there cuz it's low
[1:36:42] country.
[1:36:45] And I was preaching 90 miles an hour and
[1:36:47] some of them guys sitting up on the
[1:36:48] front, they took off wilder than
[1:36:51] Indians.
[1:36:52] They run out the door screaming and
[1:36:55] hollering. You know what I done?
[1:36:59] Took off right after them.
[1:37:02] screaming, hollering, run out the door,
[1:37:05] run up on top of that dyke, that levey
[1:37:07] thing. Four or five of us just running
[1:37:10] around, screaming, hollering, shouting.
[1:37:14] Everybody else was sitting in church
[1:37:15] waiting on me to come back.
[1:37:20] Now, who got the main blessing out of
[1:37:21] that? I did. You know what? I was being
[1:37:25] selfish. That's right. Yes, sir. So, I
[1:37:28] channeled my anointing. I believe it was
[1:37:31] the anointing, but I channeled it toward
[1:37:34] me. That's why I used to do in preaching
[1:37:37] and speaking in tonesues. So, I'd speak
[1:37:39] in tonesues and speak in tonesues and
[1:37:41] speak in tonesues. You know what I was
[1:37:42] doing? Blessing myself. That's right.
[1:37:45] That is what the Bible says.
[1:37:48] Was I wrong? Absolutely wrong. Yes, he
[1:37:51] was.
[1:37:53] Amen. Oh, dear God, a miracle has
[1:37:56] happened. A preacher said he was wrong.
[1:37:58] Lord have mercy. The coming of the Lord
[1:37:59] is at hand tonight. Repent. Everybody
[1:38:01] repent.
[1:38:05] But I had to be taught how to worship.
[1:38:08] Yeah.
[1:38:11] So instead of getting mad and angry at
[1:38:13] the preacher after he got done, the
[1:38:16] prophet taught us,
[1:38:18] "Oh, after a message, just don't you
[1:38:21] feel all scoured out? Just the Holy
[1:38:24] Spirit cleaning your heart from all
[1:38:27] unbelief." Now remember, we're talking
[1:38:28] about a man saved, sanctified, filled
[1:38:30] with the Holy Ghost, and yet he's still
[1:38:32] getting washed. You understand what it
[1:38:33] is? Each one of these is a mikvah.
[1:38:36] A mikvah. He's fixing to come into the
[1:38:38] presence of the bridegroom and he's got
[1:38:40] an attitude. He's got some, you know,
[1:38:42] some uh some sweet something another
[1:38:44] there stuck and it's it's made a mess in
[1:38:46] the skillet and he's got this that and
[1:38:47] another. And Jesus is wanting to make
[1:38:49] love to him through what avenue through
[1:38:50] worship. I don't understand people that
[1:38:53] whenever the word is over, they get up
[1:38:54] and leave. I don't understand that. You
[1:38:57] know, when the word is over, that's the
[1:38:58] time we want to worship the Lord and
[1:39:01] make love to him. You just got clean
[1:39:03] enough where he can stand to be around
[1:39:05] you. You're stinking. You come to church
[1:39:07] with a stinking attitude. You come to
[1:39:09] church, you hadn't prayed, hadn't read
[1:39:11] your Bible since Sunday. You didn't have
[1:39:13] a whole lot of fellowship. Now the word
[1:39:15] brings you up and you're immersed and
[1:39:16] you come up out. Glory to God. I feel so
[1:39:19] much better, Lord Jesus. I I'll see you
[1:39:21] Sunday, Lord. God bless you. No, we're
[1:39:25] washed.
[1:39:27] Now it's time for us to reach over
[1:39:30] and pull him over on our lap.
[1:39:36] I preached about him that way down in
[1:39:37] Louisiana
[1:39:39] several years ago. I don't know that
[1:39:41] I've ever stood under such an anointing
[1:39:44] of his person
[1:39:47] to make him so real.
[1:39:50] And I got a chair up on the platform and
[1:39:53] I sat down on the chair and then I like
[1:39:55] I reached out and grabbed a hold of
[1:39:57] Jesus.
[1:39:59] There's people there from Germany,
[1:40:00] people from different parts of the
[1:40:02] world, people's lives. It wasn't one of
[1:40:04] them running, screaming, hollering types
[1:40:05] of services now, but people were just
[1:40:08] weeping and people saying, "I felt I
[1:40:11] could I could reach out and touch it. I
[1:40:14] I I never knew that you could feel that
[1:40:16] way before this." Well, to me, what a
[1:40:20] great thing that Jesus can be so real to
[1:40:23] us. And then it don't just happen in
[1:40:26] church, but we take that same thing with
[1:40:29] us when we go out and get in our car and
[1:40:31] start our car and go at the house.
[1:40:36] So, the mikvah,
[1:40:38] the mikvah washes us and he says,
[1:40:41] "Putting you right back in track with
[1:40:44] God again." Oh now, now now
[1:40:50] is the time to worship him.
[1:40:55] The message
[1:40:57] is over. Not church is over on the
[1:41:01] preacher quits preaching.
[1:41:04] But now it's time. It's amazing to me
[1:41:07] how many message people still don't
[1:41:09] understand this.
[1:41:11] As soon as a preacher says, "Let's
[1:41:13] stand." They thought he said something
[1:41:15] else, I reckon. Let's go.
[1:41:18] Oh, I'm out of here. I'm out of here.
[1:41:20] What you mean? You've got bathed. You've
[1:41:23] got washed.
[1:41:25] You're clean. You're not sweaty. You're
[1:41:28] not stinking.
[1:41:30] And Jesus can come closer to you then
[1:41:33] than he could in the preliminary part of
[1:41:35] the service.
[1:41:39] And the very time that he wants to come
[1:41:41] near us. and we get in a big fizz and
[1:41:44] want to go, "Oh my, I I'd rather spend
[1:41:46] 30 minutes longer in here worshiping him
[1:41:49] and talking to him. I love you all, but
[1:41:51] I'd rather spend that time with him than
[1:41:52] I would with you standing out there
[1:41:53] talking or back there in my office
[1:41:55] talking to somebody." Being in his
[1:41:57] presence can change our lives.
[1:42:03] Let me close with this. Oh, after a
[1:42:06] message, just don't you feel all scoured
[1:42:09] out? Just the Holy Spirit cleaning your
[1:42:13] heart from all unbelief,
[1:42:16] putting you right back in track
[1:42:19] with God again.
[1:42:22] Now is the time to worship him. The
[1:42:26] message is over.
[1:42:29] So let's just worship.
[1:42:35] part of the marriage vow that was said
[1:42:39] for hundreds of years, still said by
[1:42:41] some. I've used it a few times myself
[1:42:43] upon request.
[1:42:46] But it is that the bride and the groom
[1:42:49] would say this to each other and
[1:42:52] incorporate this in their vows.
[1:42:56] with my body I the
[1:43:02] worship.
[1:43:07] You see why that stumbles people?
[1:43:09] Because they don't understand what
[1:43:10] worship is. Worshiping the Lord, Brother
[1:43:13] Brandham said, is you witnessing to your
[1:43:15] neighbor. Worshiping the Lord is
[1:43:18] reaching out to somebody.
[1:43:20] And we think we've got to be down on our
[1:43:22] knees. We've got to be in a certain
[1:43:23] place. Our hands have got to be in a
[1:43:24] certain place. And Satan has done that
[1:43:26] to us to rob our father from worship
[1:43:30] every day of our life. I worship way
[1:43:33] more out of church than I do in church.
[1:43:37] Some people think worship only belongs
[1:43:40] in the house of God. That is so wrong.
[1:43:43] It ought to be an every day of your
[1:43:45] life. You worship Jesus when you say a
[1:43:47] kind word. You worship Jesus when you
[1:43:50] reach out to somebody that needs a
[1:43:52] helping hand.
[1:43:55] So will you incorporate this into your
[1:43:59] marriage ceremony?
[1:44:01] With my body
[1:44:05] I the worship.
[1:44:08] It stumbles message people even when you
[1:44:10] quote it and I've used it in several
[1:44:12] church dedications may use it again this
[1:44:14] weekend brother Daryl
[1:44:16] that the prophet said in God's provided
[1:44:19] place
[1:44:21] there's where God meets with his people
[1:44:25] and they are worshiped
[1:44:29] together
[1:44:36] so you see most of us understand half of
[1:44:38] that.
[1:44:40] You understand you worshiping him.
[1:44:45] So who is in turn? Well, who do you
[1:44:48] figure
[1:44:50] with his body, with his spirit, with his
[1:44:55] nature? What does worship mean?
[1:44:58] Your adoration,
[1:45:00] your utmost which you give to no one
[1:45:03] else. with my body I'll be worshiped
[1:45:08] which includes my hands
[1:45:10] which includes my feet. If he wants me
[1:45:12] to dance all he's got to do is put that
[1:45:14] dance in my feet tonight and I'll dance
[1:45:16] before him with my body. I worship him.
[1:45:20] I don't just worship him with my soul. I
[1:45:23] want to worship him. And you know what
[1:45:24] he done? He wants to share his body with
[1:45:28] me. and he did on the cross and he's
[1:45:32] still sharing it tonight
[1:45:35] because I'm here ministering to it
[1:45:40] cuz anyone knows he says in 1965 the
[1:45:44] body of Christ is not yet finished
[1:45:48] because it's the bride
[1:45:50] but she's being finished I'm ministering
[1:45:54] to the body
[1:45:56] and what does he want to do come near us
[1:45:59] and we worship and praise and adore. And
[1:46:03] what does he do, brother Jim? He adores
[1:46:07] and loves.
[1:46:10] This is why he wants to move on our
[1:46:12] emotions.
[1:46:13] He wants to move on our feelings. My
[1:46:17] goodness, if we'd go to a ball game and
[1:46:18] get all hyped up about some stupid ball,
[1:46:21] whether it's football, baseball, soccer,
[1:46:24] whatever it is, and we'd get so
[1:46:26] emotional and scream and holler and
[1:46:27] carry on about that, what about the
[1:46:30] living God that would pull us in his
[1:46:32] presence? Shouldn't that make us
[1:46:34] emotional?
[1:46:36] I want him to have my emotions.
[1:46:41] Can we stand together?
[1:46:45] Praise God.
[1:46:49] Oh, let me read this to you again. Oh,
[1:46:51] after a message, just don't you feel all
[1:46:54] scoured out?
[1:46:56] Just the Holy Spirit cleaning your heart
[1:47:04] from all unbelief,
[1:47:07] putting you right back in track with God
[1:47:10] again.
[1:47:11] Oh, now is the time to worship him. The
[1:47:17] message is over,
[1:47:19] so let's just worship.
[1:47:24] If you happen to run into me sometime at
[1:47:26] Home Depot or Lowe's or out somewhere
[1:47:30] and you speak to me and I don't speak
[1:47:33] back to you,
[1:47:35] it could be that I'm so involved
[1:47:41] with my Lord at the time that I never
[1:47:44] even noticed you.
[1:47:47] I know you think I'm crazy. I know you
[1:47:49] think I'm a fanatic. I am.
[1:47:52] I admit to that tonight.
[1:47:55] I am an addict.
[1:48:01] Y'all need to y'all need to know it.
[1:48:03] Your pastor is an addict.
[1:48:07] And I have been for decades.
[1:48:10] I am addicted
[1:48:12] to my Lord Jesus. Amen.
[1:48:16] Well, some of y'all are addicted to TV.
[1:48:19] You're addicted to YouTube. You're
[1:48:20] addicted to Instagram. You're addicted
[1:48:22] to your phone. Your phone can't ding or
[1:48:24] swoosh or whatever it is all the time
[1:48:26] without it dragging your attention. It
[1:48:28] just about kills you if you get a new
[1:48:30] message somewhere without you picking it
[1:48:31] up. I wonder how Jesus feels compared to
[1:48:34] our phone sometimes.
[1:48:36] Wouldn't it be awful to make the Lord
[1:48:37] Jesus feel jealous because of a stupid
[1:48:40] cell phone? That we'd pay more attention
[1:48:43] to our phone dinging or ringing or
[1:48:46] swooshing or whooshing or whatever it
[1:48:48] does. And you know every one of them
[1:48:49] sounds what they're for. This is
[1:48:51] YouTube. This is Instagram. This is
[1:48:53] this. This is this. Do you recognize his
[1:48:56] swooshes?
[1:48:57] Do you recognize his dings on your
[1:49:00] heart?
[1:49:02] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:49:05] You love him tonight, children. Amen.
[1:49:08] Let's bow our heads together.
[1:49:13] Hallelujah.
[1:49:17] Hallelujah.
[1:49:19] Anyone here tonight just be honest
[1:49:21] before the Lord and say, "Lord, I really
[1:49:24] needed that tonight. I needed to be
[1:49:27] scoured.
[1:49:29] Thank you, Lord, for loving me. Lord
[1:49:32] Jesus, I raise my hands."
[1:49:34] That ain't nothing new for me. Of
[1:49:36] course, I get scoured every day of my
[1:49:38] life. I study the message and read the
[1:49:40] Bible and listen to tapes and I get
[1:49:43] scoured all the time. And I'm grateful
[1:49:46] for it. I'm so thankful,
[1:49:50] Lord God. You saw the hands of your
[1:49:51] children that were uplifted
[1:49:55] many more, Lord, as they listen to it,
[1:49:56] wherever they are. I pray in the name of
[1:49:58] Jesus.
[1:50:01] May you deal with each heart tonight.
[1:50:02] Father,
[1:50:04] forgive us for giving our emotions to
[1:50:06] sports and then when we come to church,
[1:50:08] we sit there as dead as a doornail.
[1:50:12] We give our emotions to our IRA and we
[1:50:15] found out the stock markets went up and
[1:50:18] we've increased our worth by $10,000 in
[1:50:20] the last six months and puts a big smile
[1:50:24] on our face. Of course, the stock market
[1:50:26] goes down and then we lose 20. Puts a
[1:50:28] frown on our face. You give us eternal
[1:50:31] life and we just sit there and look at
[1:50:32] the preacher when he tells us we've got
[1:50:33] it. Forgive us, Lord.
[1:50:37] Forgive us.
[1:50:40] You understand what it's like to be
[1:50:42] immortal.
[1:50:44] I don't know what you dealt with
[1:50:45] exactly, every knew of your humanity.
[1:50:49] But I imagine you must have been so
[1:50:53] brokenhearted
[1:50:56] when James and John come to you
[1:50:59] and wanted to sit on your left
[1:51:02] and on your right hand.
[1:51:05] Imagine you must have been so
[1:51:07] disappointed
[1:51:10] when the disciples was arguing along the
[1:51:12] way of who would be the greatest among
[1:51:16] them and you come up and said, "What
[1:51:17] were y'all discussing? What were you
[1:51:19] talking about?" No one wanted to answer
[1:51:21] you. And then finally someone spoke up.
[1:51:24] Well, you know who was the biggest? And
[1:51:26] you called a little child.
[1:51:29] And except you become as humble and
[1:51:31] converted as this little child.
[1:51:34] How disappointing
[1:51:36] those apostles m must have been to you.
[1:51:40] Oh Jesus, I pray that you'd help each of
[1:51:43] us tonight.
[1:51:46] It's not no miracle that I could love
[1:51:48] you and that I could need you and I
[1:51:50] could
[1:51:52] give my life for you. But how in the
[1:51:55] world could you still love me
[1:51:59] after all these years of my humanity and
[1:52:02] my failures?
[1:52:04] Scouring pad after scouring pad.
[1:52:08] Oh God, but I thank you for every one of
[1:52:10] them.
[1:52:12] I thank you that you will not let me get
[1:52:14] by. Was holding an attitude.
[1:52:20] Lord God, if I know my heart tonight,
[1:52:23] there is not a person in this world that
[1:52:26] I have anything against. There's not a
[1:52:29] person in this world that I wish evil to
[1:52:33] or upon.
[1:52:35] And if I'm ignorant of anyone, show me
[1:52:37] tonight and I'll make it right before
[1:52:39] the dawn of another day.
[1:52:42] Oh Jesus, I pray you would help each of
[1:52:45] us tonight. Father,
[1:52:48] cleanse us, Lord. We feel like we've
[1:52:51] been not only to the mikvah, but few
[1:52:55] scouring pads used on us while we were
[1:52:57] there,
[1:53:00] but now maybe we've been washed. Our
[1:53:03] attitudes been adjusted. And now we feel
[1:53:06] like Lord, we we could come in your
[1:53:09] presence.
[1:53:12] We know how you were treated
[1:53:15] whenever you were invited to the great
[1:53:17] feast that day.
[1:53:21] The man who gave the peace, Simon, had
[1:53:23] told the footwash flunky, "When Jesus
[1:53:26] comes in, don't wash his feet."
[1:53:31] He told the perfumer,
[1:53:33] "Don't put any perfume on him."
[1:53:37] He told all the people that had served
[1:53:40] the others, "When Jesus comes in, ignore
[1:53:43] him."
[1:53:46] So they did as they were told.
[1:53:49] You went over and sat down in the
[1:53:51] corner.
[1:53:53] It was hot, dry, dusty.
[1:53:57] You had persspired and sweat had run
[1:53:59] down your face and down your body.
[1:54:04] Maybe hard for us to believe, but your
[1:54:05] body would produce human odor just like
[1:54:07] ours.
[1:54:10] You didn't smell good. And
[1:54:13] the host did not come and give you a
[1:54:15] welcome kiss.
[1:54:17] So everybody else there smelt fragrant.
[1:54:20] And they were refreshed. They were given
[1:54:23] house shoes. Their dirty sandals were
[1:54:26] kept by the door and they were given
[1:54:27] nice comfortable house shoes and given a
[1:54:30] robe and there you sat in the only
[1:54:33] garment that you had
[1:54:36] tattered worn
[1:54:39] sweat. You had wiped it from your face
[1:54:42] as you come in and you might have
[1:54:45] reached down and grabbed a hold of your
[1:54:46] sleeve and wiped the sweat off your neck
[1:54:49] and off your brow.
[1:54:52] and they escorted you over into the
[1:54:54] corner by yourself.
[1:54:57] No one smiled at you.
[1:54:59] No one spoke to you.
[1:55:03] I'm so sorry.
[1:55:06] I'm sure I've done you that way.
[1:55:10] Please forgive me.
[1:55:13] I wonder how many of our message church
[1:55:16] services have been that way.
[1:55:19] We wanted you to move in this certain
[1:55:20] certain pattern and you didn't want to.
[1:55:23] So we put you over in a corner. Forgive
[1:55:26] us, God.
[1:55:29] But Lord, you had a heart.
[1:55:32] Oh, it wasn't the choicest heart in all
[1:55:34] the city.
[1:55:36] She had a very bad reputation.
[1:55:40] But you started dealing with her.
[1:55:44] Your presence started permeating beyond
[1:55:46] that building. cuz you couldn't touch
[1:55:48] nobody there.
[1:55:52] And you started dealing with a woman. I
[1:55:54] can see her. She comes down those creaky
[1:55:56] steps that day
[1:56:00] and she went up and purchased the very
[1:56:03] best she could find
[1:56:07] and starts to minister to you.
[1:56:11] No doubt she had all kinds of thoughts.
[1:56:13] What am I doing? They'll never let me in
[1:56:15] there. I'll never get even close.
[1:56:18] But there was something drawing her. You
[1:56:22] had a need.
[1:56:24] Oh, Almighty God,
[1:56:27] I believe you have a need tonight. This
[1:56:30] Wednesday night, Word of Life Church,
[1:56:34] Johnson City, Tennessee,
[1:56:37] you have a need to be adored,
[1:56:40] a need to be worshiped,
[1:56:43] a need for fellowship.
[1:56:48] We know the story well, but Lord, I want
[1:56:50] to change the scene tonight.
[1:56:53] Let me be that person. Let these young
[1:56:56] people, let these older people, some
[1:57:00] that couldn't make the service sitting
[1:57:01] at home, may they be that person in
[1:57:04] their home.
[1:57:06] Lord, may each one of us realize that we
[1:57:10] have been called to render a service.
[1:57:15] Lord Jesus, I am willing to take your
[1:57:18] stink of your name and of your message
[1:57:22] upon me. Yes. Let me bow down to your
[1:57:27] feet, precious Lord.
[1:57:32] Hallelujah.
[1:57:34] Let me be called whatever. Father,
[1:57:38] let me be ridiculed,
[1:57:41] made fun of,
[1:57:43] laughed at.
[1:57:45] Oh Jesus, let me take your feet into my
[1:57:50] hands.
[1:57:52] Let me kiss them, Lord.
[1:57:55] Let me humbly adore and worship.
[1:58:01] A king wouldn't want me near him. The
[1:58:04] president of our nation would never
[1:58:06] invite me, but I'm invited by almighty
[1:58:10] God.
[1:58:12] Oh Jesus,
[1:58:14] let me kiss away part of your reproach.
[1:58:16] Lord,
[1:58:19] let me take the kisses of my mouth. Oh
[1:58:21] my father,
[1:58:24] may I rise when the worship is done with
[1:58:28] the ointment on my face,
[1:58:31] the ointment on my lips,
[1:58:35] and the ointment on my soul
[1:58:38] that my being has so emerged into divine
[1:58:41] worship.
[1:58:43] Hallelujah. Because I've been
[1:58:44] ministering
[1:58:46] to Almighty God.
[1:58:49] I worship you tonight, Jesus.
[1:58:52] I bless your name, Father.
[1:58:56] I want every person here to worship you
[1:58:58] and praise you.
[1:59:00] But in reality, if nobody else here
[1:59:04] does,
[1:59:05] I'm going to.
[1:59:08] And I ain't just going to do it tonight.
[1:59:11] I'm going to do it every time I go to
[1:59:13] church. I'm going to do it every day of
[1:59:14] my life.
[1:59:17] Oh Jesus, we worship,
[1:59:21] we praise,
[1:59:23] we bless your name.
[1:59:25] As your prophet said, the message is
[1:59:27] over now.
[1:59:30] Now it's time to worship.
[1:59:34] We bless you, Lord Jesus.
[1:59:38] We want you to know you are the king of
[1:59:40] our life.
[1:59:42] We love you more than anyone else. More
[1:59:45] than anything else.
[1:59:48] We have many things
[1:59:51] that affect us for sure. Many things are
[1:59:54] in order in our affections of our lives,
[1:59:58] but we want you to be number one.
[2:00:02] Oh Jesus, we love you. We praise you.
[2:00:07] Hallelujah.
[2:00:10] Can we take just a few minutes before we
[2:00:12] go?
[2:00:14] If you feel scoured and you feel that
[2:00:16] you've had another mikvah tonight
[2:00:21] and now before we go
[2:00:24] could be from our hearts and our lips
[2:00:27] and with our body we will worship
[2:00:33] our hands, our eyes, our minds. We will
[2:00:36] lift our eyes
[2:00:39] with our ears. We're open to his word,
[2:00:42] to his
[2:00:44] telling us and whispering,
[2:00:46] "Love me, my bride.
[2:00:49] Love me."
[2:00:51] I wonder how many times his name has
[2:00:53] been blasted today.
[2:00:55] How many people has taken his name in
[2:00:58] vain?
[2:00:59] Is there anybody in this building
[2:01:01] tonight that wants to lift up his name?
[2:01:03] Anybody in this building that wants to
[2:01:06] bless his name?
[2:01:08] How many times in the Tri Cities area
[2:01:11] has he been cussed today? That's all his
[2:01:14] name has been as just a by word.
[2:01:18] Oh, surely there's somebody here tonight
[2:01:20] that wants to say, "Lord Jesus, we
[2:01:23] worship you. We lift you. We adore you."
[2:01:28] I don't care if there's been 50,000
[2:01:30] people in this state today that has
[2:01:34] called him evil. Say there is no God.
[2:01:38] If we can get just a couple of people
[2:01:40] together right here tonight, we can lift
[2:01:43] him higher than they ever tried to bring
[2:01:46] him lower. Cuz whe there's two or three
[2:01:49] gathered together in my name, there am I
[2:01:52] in their midst.
[2:01:54] It don't take that many really.
[2:01:57] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:01:59] Why don't you just close your eyes now?
[2:02:02] Maybe some of you, it's been a while
[2:02:05] since you've been able to enter into
[2:02:07] that that place of worship. If if you
[2:02:10] know,
[2:02:12] just listen to me. You know, in prayer
[2:02:15] that there's there's initial stage in
[2:02:17] the outer courts and you go to praying
[2:02:19] and you're, you know, you're battling
[2:02:21] and you're you're pressing through. You
[2:02:22] got to do this, you got to go there, you
[2:02:24] got this, that, and the other. And many
[2:02:26] of many of us never get beyond that that
[2:02:28] initial stage of the outer court. But if
[2:02:30] we can keep pressing and go into where
[2:02:33] the lights are, the monora and go into
[2:02:36] the bread of his face and keep pressing
[2:02:39] and going behind the veil. For those of
[2:02:41] you who have ever entered there, you
[2:02:43] know that there's a place in prayer
[2:02:46] that's so far beyond the outer cage.
[2:02:48] It's the same with worship.
[2:02:50] As I told you about some of my worship
[2:02:53] in Pentecost and I used to think the
[2:02:54] louder I got and the more I run and the
[2:02:56] louder I screamed and hollered. But I
[2:02:59] exper I have experienced phases of
[2:03:02] worship since I come to this word
[2:03:05] because I didn't know how to really
[2:03:07] worship him then. I was giving him
[2:03:10] everything that I had that I knew about.
[2:03:12] But it was so selfish. It was about me.
[2:03:15] It was what I could get out of it.
[2:03:18] It's what I could get.
[2:03:21] But we're married. This is a marriage
[2:03:24] relationship. It isn't just about what
[2:03:26] he can do for you.
[2:03:29] It's what can I do for him? What can I
[2:03:32] say
[2:03:34] that would bless his heart tonight?
[2:03:38] Praise God.
[2:03:40] Oh Jesus, we worship you, Lord.
[2:03:44] I want you to know you are loved.
[2:03:49] You are adored.
[2:03:52] You are praised.
[2:03:54] There's people in this building tonight.
[2:03:57] You are not their spare tire.
[2:04:01] You are their everything.
[2:04:04] They not only live for you, they would
[2:04:08] die for you.
[2:04:10] They've been laughed at because of you.
[2:04:13] ridiculed because of you. And they bear
[2:04:17] it not out of grief and sadness and
[2:04:19] sorrow, but with great joy.
[2:04:24] Oh Jesus, we worship you
[2:04:28] with all of our souls tonight. Living
[2:04:31] God,
[2:04:33] Harry, sing something. Lead us.
[2:04:36] Can we take just a few minutes before we
[2:04:38] go? Oh, I know it's the middle of the
[2:04:39] week and he out of work and all that
[2:04:41] sort of thing, but this might be our
[2:04:43] last time to ever praise him this way.
[2:04:48] I would sure want it to be good for us,
[2:04:50] wouldn't you? That it would be written
[2:04:53] down in heaven. They gave me their all.
[2:04:58] Hallelujah,
[2:05:01] Jesus.
[2:05:03] Hallelujah.
[2:05:05] We worship you, Father.
[2:05:09] We bless your name
[2:05:12] and know what it's like. We bless your
[2:05:14] name, Lord Jesus.
[2:05:16] We worship you tonight, Father, to be in
[2:05:20] the presence of Hallelujah, Lord. Oh
[2:05:23] yes, Lord Jesus.
[2:05:26] Just praise him now. And now what time
[2:05:31] it is,
[2:05:34] he's washed you now. Now he's cleansed
[2:05:36] cuz time stood still. He wants to come
[2:05:39] near you now. You've been anointed with
[2:05:43] that oil of his anointed.
[2:05:47] You smell fresh, pleasant.
[2:05:51] Praise God. You've been anointed with
[2:05:55] restored. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah,
[2:05:59] Jesus.
[2:06:01] Because we stayed here,
[2:06:05] we bless your name, holy father,
[2:06:09] in the presence
[2:06:11] of the Lord. Glorious Lord, saturate our
[2:06:16] souls tonight. Oh God, no one had to say
[2:06:19] a word. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Jesus,
[2:06:25] thank you, Father. We couldn't even make
[2:06:29] a sound. Yes, Lord.
[2:06:32] Yes, Lord.
[2:06:35] I give up everything.
[2:06:39] Everything, my Lord,
[2:06:42] for this treasure
[2:06:46] I found. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:06:49] Thank you, Jesus. What about a young
[2:06:51] people? I want your praise.
[2:06:54] What about you married men? You married
[2:06:57] women, older brothers and sisters. I
[2:07:00] don't want to hear our adoration, our
[2:07:03] praise.
[2:07:06] Hallelujah, Jesus. Cuz my heart is
[2:07:10] burning.
[2:07:12] Oh yes, Lord.

[2:17:48] salvation is all about us and it's all
[2:17:51] about you loving us and what you can do
[2:17:54] for us. Change us from tonight, Lord.
[2:17:58] And help us to realize it's not just
[2:18:00] one-sided of what you can do for us, but
[2:18:04] what can we do for you?
[2:18:07] What can we give you? How can I love you
[2:18:10] in a way that I've never loved you
[2:18:13] before?
[2:18:15] Help me, Jesus.
[2:18:18] Praise be to God.
[2:18:22] Praise be to God.
[2:18:25] Oh, aren't you glad you was able to come
[2:18:27] to church tonight?
[2:18:29] Thank the Lord. Thank the Lord. We
[2:18:33] worship you, Jesus.
[2:18:35] Let's just bow our heads together.
[2:18:39] Heavenly Father, thank you for this
[2:18:41] service, Lord.
[2:18:44] I thank you for your cleansing, Lord.
[2:18:48] Oh, Jesus, we we know we need it,
[2:18:51] Father.
[2:18:54] It's like the bride is dressed in this
[2:18:56] beautiful white spotless garment,
[2:19:00] but everywhere she goes out here on the
[2:19:02] world, it's smuck and smoke and just
[2:19:05] filth and just ungodly nasty stuff. And
[2:19:10] it's like everything that's around us is
[2:19:13] wanting to touch us and touch our
[2:19:16] garment and spot it. because for us to
[2:19:20] appear in your presence
[2:19:22] with just the least spot on our garment
[2:19:26] would be a a great reproach.
[2:19:29] So it ain't that we have to actually
[2:19:31] even partake of it. It's not that we
[2:19:34] have to actually do what they do, but
[2:19:38] just if we get too close and it rubs off
[2:19:42] on us and we pick up this or that or the
[2:19:44] other, then our beautiful garment
[2:19:47] becomes spotted and marred.
[2:19:50] Cleanse us tonight, Lord. Give us wisdom
[2:19:54] how to walk in this dark, decrepit world
[2:19:57] and come out on the other side as white
[2:20:01] as snow.
[2:20:03] But we believe that's what you're doing
[2:20:05] around the world.
[2:20:07] We worship you tonight, Father. Go with
[2:20:09] us now. May we ponder over these things
[2:20:11] and ruminate over them as sheep do. We
[2:20:14] want to be better people. We want to be
[2:20:16] better, more sincere worshippers, a more
[2:20:20] sincere wife that loves you and serves
[2:20:23] you
[2:20:25] all the remaining portion of our life.
[2:20:28] Lord Jesus, go with us now. We pray,
[2:20:30] Father, do we return again at the
[2:20:33] appointed time. In the name of the Lord
[2:20:35] Jesus, we ask it. And the church said,
[2:20:39] "Amen." Sing something else for us here
[2:20:41] as we go. Praise the Lord. Turn around
[2:20:43] and shake hands with somebody and tell
[2:20:44] them it's it's been good to be in the
[2:20:46] house of the Lord. It's been good be in
[2:20:49] his presence. Amen. Music fades
[2:20:54] and all is slipped away.
[2:20:57] and I simply come. God bless you saints.
[2:21:01] Love you in the Lord.
[2:21:05] [Music]
[2:21:09] Pointing that word
[2:21:12] that will bless your heart.
[2:21:16] [Music]
[2:21:19] I bring you more than a song.
[2:21:23] For a song
[2:21:26] is not what you have desired.
[2:21:33] You search much deeper within.
[2:21:38] Through the way things appear, you're
[2:21:41] looking in to my heart.
[2:21:48] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[2:21:54] Oh, it's all about you.
[2:21:58] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:22:02] I'm sorry, Lord, for
[2:22:06] I made it. It's all about you.
[2:22:13] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:22:17] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[2:22:23] Oh, it's all about you.
[2:22:27] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:22:32] I'm sorry, Lord, for the faith I made.
[2:22:38] Oh, it's all about you.
[2:22:42] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:22:47] King of endless world.
[2:22:51] No one could express
[2:22:55] how much you deserve.
[2:23:02] Though I'm weak and poor,
[2:23:06] all I have is yours.
[2:23:09] Every single pray
[2:23:15] I'll bring you more than a song.
[2:23:20] For the song
[2:23:23] is not what you have required.
[2:23:27] [Applause]
[2:23:30] You search much deeper within
[2:23:34] through the way things appear. You're
[2:23:38] looking
[2:23:39] for my heart.
[2:23:44] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[2:23:50] Oh, it's all about you.
[2:23:54] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:23:59] I'm sorry for the thing I made.
[2:24:05] Oh, it's all about you.
[2:24:09] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:24:13] I'm coming back to heart of worship.
[2:24:19] Oh, it's all about you.
[2:24:23] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:24:27] I'm sorry, Lord.
[2:24:31] I made it. Oh, it's all about you.
[2:24:37] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:24:42] When the music fades
[2:24:46] and all is stripped away
[2:24:49] and I simply come
[2:24:53] [Music]
[2:24:56] longing just to breathe
[2:25:00] something that's a word
[2:25:03] that will bless your heart.
[2:25:10] I bring you more than a song
[2:25:14] for a song in this is not what you have
[2:25:19] required.
[2:25:24] You search much deeper within
[2:25:28] through the way things appear. You're
[2:25:32] looking in to my heart.
[2:25:38] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[2:25:44] Oh, it's all about you.
[2:25:48] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:25:52] I'm sorry, Lord.
[2:25:56] I made it. Oh, it's all about you.
[2:26:02] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:26:06] I'm sorry for the thing I made.
[2:26:13] Oh, it's all about you.
[2:26:16] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:26:24] I made
[2:26:27] It's all about you.
[2:26:31] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:26:35] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[2:26:41] Oh, it's all about you.
[2:26:55] Heat.
[2:26:58] [Music]
[2:27:01] [Applause]
[2:27:08] Heat.
