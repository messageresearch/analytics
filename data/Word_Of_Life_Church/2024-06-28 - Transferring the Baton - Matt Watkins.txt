the the the work that's went into services like these the the the musicians the sound tech the parking crew even parts that are unseen I know it from running Services you have so many moving parts and so I just want to say thank you Amen to all the people that made this meeting possible and I'm so glad that you're here so glad I'm here but most of importantly I'm so glad the Lord Jesus is here amen the Bible says he inhabits you say how do you know brother math that he's here cuz I brought him with me amen he inhabits the Praises of his people and I just want to worship Him how many want to just Worship the Lord amen in spirit and in truth we just want to say Lord have your way amen from the beginning to the end from the front to the back lord I don't want to restrict you any way I just want the Holy Spirit to move freely you believe the Lord H is my mindful of you in your need amen I'm I I'm so aware of that even the the the the holy spirit that is just the the presence of the Lord you feel here the presence of the Lord I felt even before I arrived and I just believe the Lord has something special there's something so special about special meetings and it ain't because of who's there ain't because of who's preaching as good preachers but you know what makes a special meeting special one thing expectation and when you get a lot of Believers in the same room and you have faith and the word of the message of the hour is preached let me tell you friends nothing is impossible nothing's too hard for the Lord put all those licks of fire put them in one big old room amen and everybody pulling on the word of God when Jesus is on the scene nothing is too hard there's no case too hard for him so you just put your faith and confidence in him tonight I believe that he'll speak something special for you amen if you have your Bible let's turn to 2 Kings chapter 2 2 Kings chapter 2 amen I just love the presence of the Lord I realize when I'm in that kind of presence you know this is what I was this is where I was made to be amen I don't fit in out there in the world this is right where I fit in prophet of God said you know you get to church sometimes and you get in the atmosphere and he said you know sometimes you want to cry sometimes you want to shout other times you just want to be quiet he said and he you don't really know what's happening prophet of God said I tell you what's happening you're bumping into another dimension and I say Lord I want to bump into that Dimension tonight let Angels let me bump into an angel a minister in spirit tonight amen we can move from this natural into the supernatural amen from this Dimension to a Heavenly Dimension 2 Kings chapter 2 I want to minister to you and I'm going to title this transferring the Baton and it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into Heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elijah Elisha from gilgal and Elijah said unto Elisha D here I pray thee for the Lord hath sent me to bethl and Elisha said unto him as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they went down to bethl verse four says and Elijah said unto him Elisha Terry here I pray thee for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho and he said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they came to Jericho verse 6 says and Elijah said unto him Terry I pray thee here for the Lord has sent me to Jordan and he said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee and they too went on the prophet of God actually says that the cities of bethl and Jericho and Jordan represented the church moving through the Lutheran age the Methodist age through John Wesley and then Pentecost would represent that Jordan River but notice Elisha it was important to go to justification but he couldn't stay there yeah it was important for him to go to sanctification that was an important step but you can't stay there come on somebody you got to stay with the word where the word moves if you want to cross Jordan you got to come through all three and Elisha says I'm not going to leave you Elijah I'm staying right beside you notice what he says here in verse 8 Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smoke the waters and were divided hither and thither so that they too went over on dry ground and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee what a powerful thing another word sister Hattie whatever you say whatever you say notice brother bham says Jehovah Gyra he says that when hadie said those words not when she thought those words not when she had it in her heart but when she let what was in her heart come out into her mouth you see your words have the power to change your atmosphere you think it's not important for you to say Amen to the word of God when the word's being preached you got fear swirling around you speak the word of God and watch those words disturb the atmosphere in your life oh Hallelujah brother bham says in another place when she spoke those words and says that's nothing but the truth brother bham amen the prophet said it felt like the room was about to come apart the Bible says he says ask what I shall do for thee now notice this here and Elijah said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me and he said thou has asked hard thing now notice it wasn't going to be hard for Elijah he was going home it's surely not hard for God then who is the hard thing for brother bham as Janny Henry says the prophet prophecy says uh you didn't choose this you you I didn't force you I didn't choose this for you but it's your choice because you chose a harder way there's a great portion of Heaven that's awaiting for you nevertheless notice this I want you to notice something so powerful here in your Bible that maybe you've never caught before notice when Elijah says to Elijah he gives them the condition of this double portion and it's actually amazing because he says to him if thou see me when I'm taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so do you know when you actually transliterate what Elijah said is he's actually saying Elijah Elisha I'm going to go and when I go you have to see me as taken from you because if you're standing here still waiting for Elijah to come back and you're still focused on Elijah in other words Elisha you got to see Elijah that he's gone home onto his reward but there's still a work to do there's still a commission that's on the job is still incompleted Elisha you've got to Elijah is gone notice what he says here in the next verse verse 11 and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and Horses of fire and parted them both asunder and Elijah went up by a whirl went into heaven Elijah Elisha saw it said my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and ripped them into pieces and he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smokee the water and said not where is Elijah but where is the Lord God of Elijah Lord Jesus we're so thankful for your divine presence Lord Lord greater than the anything Lord Jesus more father important than how well I speak how Lord the thoughts that I have before me the notes I've laid before me but Lord the most important thing is that we touch Jesus I pray that you would just move by your Holy Spirit God lord I consider myself just the least of anyone to be able to speak Lord but I just pray that you'd come and speak a word may you take control of every Spirit here tonight God and may you send a refreshing from the presence of God grant it Lord Jesus we ask in your name we ask it and the church said it amen amen you can be seated tonight thank you brother Elijah is going home and this is some of the last words God's about to take him I fully believe with all my heart that Elijah knows what's about to take place Elijah is going home and the mantle is about to be passed the Baton is going to be transferred to the Next Generation and notice here that there was a great burden upon Elijah's heart you know the burden that comes upon every generation to the success or the pre preceding generation as they know that they have to transfer the right things to the Next Generation and so he has the burden of moving or transferring this burden to Elisha you're reading some of the last words some of the last things as Elijah's going home God has already told him that as Ministry and that that phase of that Ministry is coming to a to an end and he's going to go home by a whirlwind I fully believe that the prophet of God knew that the Lord was about to take him home that's my own opinion I believe that you could see that in some of the later messages that brother Bron preaches as that God even I believe it dawned on him what was about to take place as he says things and what house will you build me and you come to the last later messages that he preaches and he he says I'm so glad for men like your pastor your young Pastor here who will take these truths and and will sweep it on to the coming of the Lord he he listen friends let me just go ahead and say this now that it was never brother bram's desire to bottle up all of the gifts of God and all of the power of God in his own Ministry but in fact it was his desire to transfer and to move that same Supernatural expectation not just in one many but one member but throughout the entire body there would be gifts and Ministries that would operate and so he comes down to some of the last things these are some of the last things that he's going to say he knows the commission as some of the last words and he takes him very specifically to the these three cities and you're reading what you're reading when you're reading here in 2 Kings chapter 2 is some of the last things he would say these are some of the last moments before he goes home to his reward at some of the last burdens you know you can read the last words of powerful men you can go and read and get books about the last words of Abraham Lincoln and and different men that have lived through time you could read the last words actually in your Bible of David as David begins to bring Solomon into the room and and he begins to say some of his last intent and some of the burdens I I believe it's a very special moment it's a very critical moment as the prophet of God would call it a junction of time where that there was something that was ending but there was something about to begin you know often times things can't begin until things end in fact sometimes God is waiting to pour something out but until there's the end of something the beginning can't start and so now notice as Elisha this is that moment that critical moment and you're reading some of the last words you can go and read the last words of Jacob as he tells them don't leave my bones here and Joseph comes to his end of his life and he's repeating the same words that Jacob mentions and says don't leave my bones here and Egypt these were some of the last desires some of the last moments some of the things that were the most dear to his heart and I believe it's it's so powerful because Elijah felt the burden of this he feels the weight of this moment he knows he can't transfer the wrong things and he knows as in any race when the runner is finishing his course there's no danger of dropping The Paton while the runner is running but the danger comes at the transfer you see more can go wrong at that moment of that transfer of that baton it's not the danger when he's running but when the hand reaches out to take the Baton it's got to be a strong hand of Faith it's got to have a confidence not a it's got to have the right expectation it's got to have the same Faith the same trust the same ver ver fervor the same passion listen friends we're not going to pick up the race the prophet left going slower or or falling behind or or retreating and going the other way and we need to be more intense about the things of God more passionate this isn't a time to go backwards it's a time to go forward in [Applause] Jesus Elisha Elijah knows the moment the critical Junction of this next generation and Elisha prays and Elijah says ask ask me what do you want Elisha and he says that I would take a double portion of your spirit would come upon me now Elisha you know no doubt he's all struck you could imagine he's just all struck by the ministry of this man he knew there was something very special about this Elijah anointing in fact it was so special that Elisha wasn't going to leave him and there was the school of the prophets but notice where Elisha was standing listen friends there was a lot of other Ministries but there was only one Elijah to this generation let me just say it this way there's only one message there's only one message that will turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers thankful for Godly Ministry thankful for God gifts that God uh places into the body but there's one Elijah but let me say there's one people who can receive that Elijah message and I'm so glad that I'm one of them I'm so glad I'm identified by that Elijah anointing and so Elisha says there's something you could imagine he's enamored by this the ministry the Miracles the signs the Wonders the great gifts the great things that he did through that prophet and you can imagine the in insufficiency the inade inadequacy that Elisha could feel about the man to the Baton being passed to him let me just say something here Elisha was not going to be El like part two well Elijah was not just going to replace Elijah Elisha was not going to replace Elijah in the sense that he was just going to do the same things or the same Miracles or hold the same uh you know kind of things listen friends there was one Ministry that fa that came in this generation that was an Elijah and we're not to try to repeat or try to manufacture something you got to realize Elisha you've got challenges that you've got to face and let me say that the the challenge that Elisha faced was very different than Elijah's in fact these three cities that he takes him to bethl Jericho and Jordan at the time of Elijah's Ministry were but bursting with Revival Jericho we know the supernatural Miracles that took place in the city of Jericho with Rahab the Harlot and salmon and the journey of Joshua it was a great Revival it was a great a city of great Revival bethl was the place where Jacob lays down and he sees a vision of a of a ladder going from Heaven to Earth and and he wakes up from that dream and he says surely the Lord was in this place and I knew it not and he names the name of that stone bethl the house of God it was a was a place Jordan where Joshua crosses Jericho AC crosses the Jordan and takes those memorial stones and and memorializes what God didn't notice I want you to notice that these cities that Elijah took Elisha to were not just random but but they were all Supernatural cities notice he's wanting to pass down the right thing he's wanting to pass down the right expectation he's wanting to make sure that Elisha I trusted in Jehovah and you can too he never failed me and he'll never fail you Elijah oh he's always faithful Elijah could say to Elisha the same God that that moved in my uh in my Ministry is going to move in your ministry Elish bethl Jordan and Jericho cities of Revival but oh how different are those cities from the beginning of Elijah's Ministry to the end of his ministry now those same cities that were in Revival now at the end of his ministry now there's young people who are mocking the prophet very different it was in brother brenham's Ministry from the beginning of his ministry till when he came to his I'll say it this way his real Ministry and at first everybody wants him at his church at first everybody's inviting him come preach our meetings come over and preach in my tent I'll hold a Revival and everybody all the doors are open and everybody listen friends Miracles will attract anybody that's right Miracles will attract anybody it'll attract uh uh Christians it'll attract non-christians it'll trct Hollywood everybody loves a miracle but the word brings the [Applause] difference and notice here these were great miraculous cities but now when he comes to his true Ministry now he comes to Tucson and he says I I never wanted to start a church here I I sat here for three years and you never invited me to your church I sat in the de I never wanted to have a church here I just wanted you know be part of your your your your meetings and brother Brandon was always about that but that the doors had closed you never invited me you you never you never you never brought I made an invitation what was it now at the end of his ministry when he comes into his true Ministry now the doors are closing nobody wanting didn't it happen the same way in the ministry of Jesus happened in the same Ministry of Jesus and he says that you know that unless you eat the Flesh and the son of man drink his blood you no part with him and even the disciples said this the the the the the the the multitude said this is a hard saying who can bear it listen friends let me just say this with you without the baptism of the Holy Ghost this message is a hard message without the true nature change by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the message is just dos and don'ts and what you can do what you can wear what you can't wear where you can go where you cannot go it's a hard thing oh but when you have the spirit of the message in your heart it's the passion of your life it's victory it's not defeat it's Freedom it's not changed Hallelujah and he says this is a hearted who can bear it disciples my Jesus looks at the disciples after that they had left and says what where you what are you doing here will you go also no Lord for you alone have the words of eternal life let me say it this way you alone have the words that make my life make sense you alone have the word that makes this entire world make sense and I've searched for it out there and I'm not found it you're the only one that makes my life worth living Lord this message is the only thing that makes the world make sense it makes economies make sense it makes sorrow make sense Elisha you got to Terry Elijah says just stay here you know Elijah Elisha you know just stay just stay you know make it you'd make a good pastor you know plan a plan a you know build a home here and put your family here Elijah you know you know this is where you could just stay right here he was testing him and Elisha says as my as the Lord liveth and as my soul liveth I will not believe you Elijah there may be a lot of people getting up and walking out there may be a lot of people walking away there may be a lot of people that might find something out there but I want you to know I'm staying right beside the Elijah Ministry listen friends this ain't a time to walk away it's a time to preach it like never before the rest of the world might go but I say to whom would I go Lord for you alone have the words of eternal life there may be a lot of people walking away but I'm not going to walk away there may be a lot of people ashamed of it but I'm not ashamed of it as Paul said I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it is the power of Salvation listen friends let me just preach to you for a can I preach here for a moment this ain't the time to try to padic cake around people's feelings and try to modernize the message of the hour this ain't a Time time to try to doctor it up and paint it up and make it more palpable and make it more acceptable socially I say preach the word of God declare the word of God say it like a prophet said it and I believe there's a generation who says give me the message give me the word of God just the way the prophet said it you don't need to doctor it you don't need to dress it up Hallelujah Glory these cities were on fire now from the beginning now to the end down to the end of his ministry and doors are closing now Elisha knew there's something very special there's something very unique about this ministry it's like nothing else I have ever ever seen it's a ministry that's unparalleled it's a Ministry that has no [Music] match you know I think it's so incredible to me how people want to come 30 40 years later and start questioning the ministry of God's Prophet people want to come years later after he's gone and begin to bring up questions well I have this doubt over here and I have this question over here about this and and you know want to say this about this you know it's so amazing because let me tell you let me just read you Lord I'm going to do it let me read you some of what some of the witnesses of that Ministry said Gordon Lindsay said never had we known any preacher calling deaf mutes and blind people to pray for and then to see those people delivered on the spot a Ministry that was beyond any that we had ever before witness James Morris said it was brandom more than any other evangelist who started the postor War 2 fundamentalist hilling Revival falling the counter with an angel on May 7th 1946 word radiated in every direction that all manner of disease and afflictions were healed instantly by the little Indiana preacher even cases of raising the dead were published TL osbor says God has chosen diverse and mysterious ways to reveal himself to his servants especially those called for dispensational purposes and was branham's call in short the man we know is William brandham was sent to demonstrate God in flesh again FF Bosworth said when the gift is operating brother bam is the most sensitive person to the presence and working of the Holy Ghost into spiritual realities of any person I have ever known Morris cell says God called this humble man and anointed his ministry with a degree that within a few short years his name was known in the most remote jungle out station wherever you would go in the world you would find the name of this messenger has preceded your arrival The Voice Gospel of the voice of healing gospel magazine says in Bible days there were men of God who were prophets and seers but in all those sacred records none of these had a greater Ministry than that of William brandom a prophet and seer of God whose photograph appears on the front cover of the issue of this issue of full go El men's uh Full Gospel men's voice brandom listen to this has been used by God In The Name of Jesus to raise the dead but it's funny how people want to come later you know it sort of be like me saying about Mike Tyson you know brother Donnie brother Mike you know Mike Mike Tyson was nothing I could have took Mike I mean I know you got you know I I know y'all talk about how great he was and you know the take TKO and the punch that he that he that he had and how you know how fast his jab was but you know what I I'll be honest here I don't know that I believe all the hype and the hoopla over that all those you know everybody you know I think I could have took you know you know what the problem is is that we have I won't call them uh opponents I'll call them victims we have the victims of Mike Tyson and I guarantee you put one of those victims up here behind this pull pit and they would shut up the mouth of any dummy that wanted to say Mike Tyson's punch was it all that well I got news for the devil why don't you put all these people who want to question the ministry of William Bram I promise you put the victim of cancer and give him a mic put the put the demon of blindness and deafness and give him a mic and I'll tell you what he testify of the same God and Jesus that with me is the same God in the ministry of that Prophet Hallelujah and I'm here to say he's the same God tonight he's that the same power tonight Hallelujah Glory notice this was the ministry he knew there was nothing else quite like it yes sir and so Elisha you can imagine is enamored by the ministry of this man he comes back to these last moments and he's reading some of the last words and he knows the anointing of the supernatural must be passed down he can't pass down the wrong things he can't pass down the wrong type of Faith the wrong expectation but it's got to be the right expectation the right burden the right things he feels the weight of this moment and he knows he's got a said his hope listen friends it was the very same thing the Apostle Paul said when he talked to the Galatians and he says oh fullest Galatians who hath Bewitched you having begun notice having begun in the spirit in other words how did this revival start with the supernatural how did this revival start with the spirit of God listen friends you take the spirit of God out of this message [Applause] if we if we just deduce this thing to good Theology and good doctrines and good stories I'm thankful for all of that I tell you what a prophet said he said you take God out of Israel and they were like any other Nation you take Samson's anointing out of his life and cut his hair he was just any other boy and he said in the church when you take the leading of the Holy Ghost the church is just the the the world with the name of God attached to it but it's the spirit that makes the difference I say more than ever before we need the spirit to make the difference having begun in the spirit are you now Glory are are you now perfected by the Flesh in other words do you think that this changing of your body is going to be by some kind of effort on your part you think that after begun in the Supernatural how did Brother Bam's Ministry begin think about it friends it began with an angel sir breaching the gap between the dimension of the the supernatural into the natural and I say to you if it began in the Supernatural it will finish in the Supernatural Elisha you got to trust the same God you got to trust the same God that was with me and Elijah you got to have your miracles on now you can't depend upon Elijah you've got your Goliath that you've got to slay now all right somebody with me he cannot live under the same stories he cannot live under the past reputation or the memories you know how easy it would have been for Elisha just to say stay here Elijah don't leave okay friends I'll be honest and tell you right now if I was there I would I would be begging God to Lord don't take brother brandham don't take him Lord we need him hear God it had been easy for Elisha to look at Elijah that way but Elijah had to Elisha had to recognize he's got his own battles he's got to face he's got his own challenges and they're actually much worse you say brother Matt Elisha is going to need to have the same Faith as Elijah no he's going to need double I said he's going to need that double portion tell you what a prophet of God said he T that taught that double portion was the was the former and the latter rign and let me tell you what Pentecost ofus in 1906 was not it was not the return of Pentecost can I preach to you here for a moment brother bham said it in the church age book he said at the turn of the 20th century men began to cry out for the spirit of God to move and God poured out his Spirit now that was a part of the restoration but I tell you what a prophet said that was not the return of Pentecost because the former Reign had not even came yet what was that former rain brother Matt the message of the hour it was the teach Mora you get what brother rham says it was Mora the teaching rain the former rain The Barley harvest the spring Harvest you ever notice who caught that and brother Ram types that in the Feast of the trumpets the Feast of Passover the Feast of of of 11 bread the feast the first fruits was fulfilled in the ministry of Jesus do you realize that as the Jews were going into the temple to sacrifice the Passover the Lamb of God was hanging on a cross wow and then the week they they go and offer the F the unleavened bread and as they're offering the unleavened bread Jesus is in the Tomb oh Hallelujah and then there's Jews come and they offer the the fruit of the first fruits and as they're offering in their rituals by their Traditions by the denominations they didn't recognize that at the moment they were trying to make a sacrifice the Lamb of God was coming up on Easter morning amen and they kept on going to church as brother bham said they would they'll keep going to church she'll singing songs not realizing the coming of the Lord has already taken place the prophet of God said in the ministry of Jesus he fulfilled all three of those feasts but then you have the feast seven weeks later seven weeks seven sabbaths plus one day there was coming a sound of a rushing might wind in the upper room when all of God's family was gathered there you know what brother brandham said brother Bram says they were all in one place and one mind and one Accord and they started praising the Lord for something that had not even been sent yet oh did you hear me church I said they were praising God for something you mean you can start praising God before your Miracle shows up you can start worshiping God before he ever shows up in your life and brother bam says when they started doing that the sound of a rushing Mighty Wind filled the house the prophet of God says that that Pentecostal week goes all the way to the Rapture through seven weeks seven Church ages but then in that Feast of trumpets it was not the barley Harvest it was the wheat Harvest Hallelujah I don't know where I'm at but I'm somewhere and brother R says what notice what the Bible says it says that was the that was the latter rain it was the Harvest it was the fall Feast you say then brother Matt if ausa was not Pentecost then what do we have did you hear me friends I said if that wasn't Pentecost then I say this must be oh Hallelujah you're not going to get away from it you're not going to get away from Pentecost the brother ROM says that it was the pattern it is the standard there is no other standard there is only one true church and that true church is identified not with 1906 but with ad33 when God poured out his Spirit upon All Flesh Hallelujah but Hosea I think it's chapter 6 I'll be the as to you as the rain the former and the latter rain now notice this here as we go this a little bit further he notice notice he says you've got to have twice the seal twice the passion twice twice it Elijah brother Brandon's standing there and he wakes up from a dream and he says he sees the Jordan River and the voice says you're 2third of the way there representing that second pool and brother bham crosses going to cross the Jordan River he wakes goes to wakes up goes back out and then he sees that vision of that great mamba snake trying to attack that brother and brother's moving back and forth and and brother bham says a voice says you have power to bind him and power to loose him and then you notice I'm not preaching on that here tonight but the voice as brother Bram begins to describe it there The Voice speaks and brother bham says Lord I want to bind him in Jesus name and and and the voice spoke to brother bandam says You must be more sincere you must be more sincere you say brother Matt are we going to need twice the Zeal twice the passion twice listen friends God has no gear of reverse God is not going backwards he has one gear and it's not staying still either it's Onward Christian Soldiers listen friends this isn't the time to go backwards it's not the time for Less can I say it this way it's the time for more of the spirit of God more of Revival more of the love of God in our in our family it's not time for less it's a time for more and notice here is Elijah's ministry as I fully believe with all my heart what you witnessed in God's Prophet was great miraculous I preached on it Great Signs great wonders great Miracles but I I love the Miracles I love the Miracles but let me just say something to you here tonight I believe that there's more than just Miracles I believe that there's more than just the I'm thankful for the miraculous and I believe we need more of it come on somebody and I believe God wants to do more of it but there was more to that son of man Ministry than just the Messiah sign to discern Hearts friends I'll just tell you and and you can you can take it or leave it but I'll tell you what I believe I believe in God's Prophet we witnessed the very nature of the lamb as the token life was to be the literal life of Jesus Christ Prophet says in one place the very human life of Jesus is to come back on the worshiper and friends can I just say I'm thankful for miracles but if I never see another one in my life but the nature of my lamb comes back upon my life that'll be the greatest Miracle God could ever do in my life is to give me the love of Jesus give me the kindness of Jesus give me the grace of Jesus Oh does somebody feel that way here tonight let the nature of the Lamb come back on the worshiper everybody loves his miracles I do too that loves The Sensational and brother Bram fought against it as I know I've preached this here before fought against it his entire Ministry you'll find it him fighting in one ditch of Armenian ISM and and then one ditches over here in Calvinism you know brother Ram said he said I'm a calvinist as long as Calvin's in the Bible I'm an armenius as long as it's in the Bible brother ROM says but there's always two ditches there's always one side or the other side isn't that amazing how people are there's always us or them or they I'd hide behind this pull pit but there ain't nowhere to hide you can see right through it and brother BR dealt with this listen brother bam can I just preach here for a moment prophet of God dealt with this entire Ministry two sides there's always a ditch on the left and there's always a ditch on the right and he says one side you got the fundamentalist Baptist who's cold and starchy and debt let me tell you how he said in one place he said one's got money in the bank but ain't got the ain't got the faith to sign his name to it the other one has all the faith in the world but he ain't got no money in the bank if you could ever get the two groups together I'm just preaching to what a prophet said and he says notice but the true bride goes down the middle of the rad drawing from both ditches hello hello I notice it's all amazing to me because it's the nature of people everybody loves to emphasize one thing to deemphasize another thing everybody loves to make something pop something up great over here only to lessen you know the fruits of the spirit were just denominational and oh really I'll tell you what a prophet said you might speak in tongues you might not but here's one thing you will have you will have the fruit evident fruits of the spirit in your life says the evidence of the Holy Ghost no brother and thought it was thought it was love the angel told him it wasn't neither is it speaking in tongues you said brother M do you believe in speaking in Tong absolutely I believe anybody who doesn't has never spoken tongues anybody who doesn't love the sensation and the feeling listen friends I love to F the Holy Ghost anybody who don't is just cuz you ain't never felt him before cuz if you ever felt him something in you says I want to feel more of that I want more and more and more and more and more fill my cup Lord but everybody loves to cut one thing out to to raise something else up it's always been that way it's always amazing I've always always found in people that with the message of the hour you'll find people will either deify the prophet or they'll deemphasize the prophet and say you know that's just his opinion brother Amos you know just what a just what brother bam says you know just you know I think brother B wasn't thus say the Lord of here and they always try to split this up and split the listen friends you can't take the messenger away from his message but they want to cut one thing out to cut it to to to to raise something I've some cut out emotion and say it's the word and the word only we don't need any of the gifts of the Spirit in operation anymore then others say we don't need teachers we don't need to teach the word of God it's not important well really that's the Ephesians Ministry pastors prophets teachers evangelists some cut out dancing and say oh that's all Pentecostal well I beg your pardon David danced before the [Applause] Lord what do you think happened on the day of Pentecost was the Fulfillment of everything David prayed for who were in The Upper Room was Jews they don't some say we don't need to dance some say we don't need brotherly love doesn't matter how I treat my brother all right some say we don't need the tapes we got our Bibles other says we don't need our Bible we got the tapes some says we just need tapes we don't need preachers all right somebody help me preach here don't leave me out here hanging on a limb some cut out the message said just give me my Bible others say I don't need my Bible amazing isn't it amazing don't you realize it is the tactic of the devil to kick us into ditches so that he can draw circles and create groups here and groups there groups here and groups there and listen friends I I remind you the prophet of God never drew a circle he only drew the circle bigger see brother the matter you preaching tolerance and and you know just just compromise that ain't what I'm preaching the word will make the separating the word will cut the difference out say well then brother Matt what is it what is it brother Paul what do we need you're confusing me brother Matt do we need the tapes is it not our tapes is it the Bible is it preachers is it t is it EV is it dancing is it emotion is it the word you say which is it brother Matt all of it all of it and I'm here to say give me all of it Lord I need the pastors I need the Evangelist I need a prophet give me my Bible give me the tapes give me the books give me the gifts give me the fruits give me the nature oh do you want to hear tonight church say I want all that God that's given can we go a little further notice this as he comes back to the expectation and he says I want you to make sure that you understand Elisha knew the mantle is nice but it wasn't the stitching it wasn't the Garment it wasn't what it was made of it wasn't the material though the material was very nice but what was special about the mantle was the promis that the mantle carried it was saturated with the anointing the purpose you see that's what an anointing is you ever look up that word it's cha which means to be Oily to smear with oil it's what they would do with the prophet at he was going to be king over Nations they would take that oil and they would break it over that man and pour it down his head as David says that's how well it is to dwell with brethren in in in in in in love it's like the the oil that ran from Aaron's beard it's that oil but what is that oil the purpose of the oil is not so you can get oily people love to get oily but the oil is only representing a purpose and God used that oil to symbolize the trout you realize when we pray for the sick we are taking the words of Jesus and that anointing oil we put upon you is so that the promises of Jesus can come off of this Bible and go into your body and heal you of all manner of diseases it is the transfer of that promise and so he would anoint a man he' take a man like jerem IA and he literally baptize him with his burden and God would have something to say to his people and so God would take a mouthpiece and he would begin to put his thoughts and his words notice friends the words of Jeremiah were not Jeremiah's words the words of Ezekiel it wasn't ezekiel's message it was only a message from the throne Ezekiel was just the Mailman for the message that's why the prophet of God said it wasn't me who appeared there on the Ohio River I was only standing nearby when he appeared you say brother M what does that mean that means you could mock Jeremiah you could laugh at Jeremiah you could ridicule him question his credibility but you weren't mocking Jeremiah you were mocking Jehovah hello somebody brother bam says oh you say I would have defended Jesus in those days oh if I would have just been there you know I would have stood for him I wouldn't allowed those Roman soldiers I'll tell you what a prophet said a prophet said what you do with the message for your day proves what you would have did back there in the days of [Music] Jesus and when you walk away from this message you're not leaving the message of a Kentucky hillbilly you are rejecting the message from the throne but when you're accepting the message brother Donnie you're not AC accepting the message of a Kentucky hillbilly you're accepting the message from the [Applause] throne oh I'm so glad I could receive the word how many's glad with me I can receive the word from my generation it wasn't his message it wasn't his prise thas the mantle was not about Elijah it was the purpose that God was transferring off of the mantle into the life of Elisha it was the promises it was the faith these are some of the last things I've been scouring the message just scouring thinking what was upon brother brenham's heart before he left the the scene what was what was upon his heart what was so close to him as he's going to go off the scene what is some of the last words if I could just put myself there what is the what is the climate there what is the feeling what is what is he wanting to pass down what is he wanting to transfer I come to what house will you build me in 1965 in November just a month before he goes off the scene and I can hear the words of brother bandam say it brother br says oh if you feel notice that the first slide there brother he says I know that each of you if you feel like I do I am so hungry to see the spirit of God moving I just can't hardly stand it oh I don't know if that resonates with you but it resonates with me oh I want to say I am so hungry for the super Supernatural oh brother I've had enough of this world I've had enough of its depression I've had enough of its anxiety I've had enough of its politics and it's presidents and it's Nations and it's Wars I am so hungry to see the spirit of God move I just can't hardly stand it brother Bron says I get to the place come to a place we sit and see it among us that we're trying sit here in the desert I get to my brethren brother brandom says as it was to see the condition of that brother notice this what he says here go to the next slide brother just if you could brother bam says here in in the token I am looking what were you looking for brother Brandon before you left the scene 1963 I am looking for a time of a breakforth of the spirit of God how many here tonight to say I am looking for a time of the Break [Applause] Forth for another surge so you had surges brother Matt I have but I'm looking for another one tonight another surge of the Holy Ghost into the church for a rapturing faith just before it comes and I say even so come Lord Jesus even so come the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the the holy ghost that we've worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down I say God while The Headstone is coming down to the body send the Dynamics back into the church listen friends don't you realize you live in the most bold age there ever was where the lid of hell has been ripped off and Satan doesn't hide in the closet he's not over in a corner somewhere subliminally I tell you what the devil is he's right out in your face amen he's not running he's right there out in the open Spirits manifesting thems themselves well I just happen to believe that if the devil is manifesting himself right out in the open I just happen to believe that the spirit of God wants to manifest itself I say angels I say Angels If Heaven wants to open then I got a church that says open heaven open Heaven open Let it Rain Lord God brother bham says when all hell Cuts loose all Heaven Cuts loose oh how many want to say cut loose Cut Loose angels of God it comes to the this message can I go just a few more minutes I usually have this little button on my watch and it sets a 1 hour timer my church at home church at home loves this little one hour timer it off take it off I forgot to start it what I tell them when the timer goes off we've stepped into [Applause] eternity very funny brother bam says this here I love this we realize if he should anoint us Slide Five if he should anoint us then the anointing is not in vain it's for a purpose that it might work to the good to the Lord and may our hearts and understanding be open Lord Brother R goes to this message and I'm just going to skip on down some of these brothers and brother brandom says just as we know in ver in slide 11 just as We Know as a man asked me a few moments ago this is why Christ speak I love this message about the coming notice and the Rapture and we know we've lived the time out my goodness could we ever say that again no one would have ever imagined that we'd still be here no one what have you imagine even brother bham seen it and ending in in 77 it could can't go much further you say brother matth then what what what's been the what's been the what is God doing I tell you what he's doing he's not doing anything by mistake he's not making any bad choices he's not just up there dding his thumbs he's working something out just as we know we've lived the time up and the time of the Rapture the hope hope of my heart the hope of the nations of the of the ages it's been the hope of every generation oh is it your hope here tonight friend we know we've lived the time up and the time of the Rapture is at hand notice in your Bible you always find that the spirit of God has coming behold I cometh but then when it says it's at hand it means it's within your reach the Baton is within your grasp just as we know the time of the Rapture is at hand and what were you looking for brother brandham and we're looking for a rapturing faith that can pull the church together and get give it some intellectual faith more mechanics more doctrines eighth Messengers come on somebody to give it some Supernatural strength that can change these bodies and my body said amen amen listen friends you might be young here today and that's wonderful I'm not saying I'm old let me get that straight first but I'm not as young as I used to be and the older you get the older that you get the more that you realize how true how much you need this promise right here the older you get you realize this world is just a world of suffering I'm talking about the world I'm not talking about his promise listen his promises far his his his blessings far outweigh his crosses David said forget not his benefits but listen friends as he says can give it some Supernatural faith when we see a God that can raise the dead off the floor or out in the yard and bring him back to life again and present him before us when we see a God who could take a cancer that's ate a man to a shadow and raise him up to a strong healthy man that that that what's that something that that man could not do hopeless he says that ought to give rapturing Faith to the people you know that just happened here just a year ago year and a half ago or so back in our hometown and my brother Travis one of my closest friends he he he he he was searching even from the days he was a boy from just a little boy he was searching for the Lord went into his mom and dad raised in the buur Baptist Church had left the church became disillusioned by it his dad was a deacon there the deacons would go out and take a smoke break and his dad left the church but there was something in Travis's heart things Supernatural things that he was you know just an expectation Supernatural things that have taken place in his life as a young boy and he starts looking for the truth he's going through and he's reading the Bible his mom didn't even know he's reading it gets into his mom's closet and finds a book The Spine is ripped off the book doesn't know to this day how that book got there and he opens the book The Acts of the Prophet written by Perry green I think I know how that book got there acts of the Prophet starts reading that book starts consuming that book brother Travis had went to Pastor became a teenager older older years and he goes to church starts going to church parents wasn't even going to church he's going to every church he go to you know the one Church down the road and he'd always you know meet the people come to the pastor and say brother you know these Miracles we read about in the Bible in the book of Acts he was just enamored by the book of Acts I believe any believer would be and and and he and he says brother he tell the youth leader where's where's the god that we read about here Hebrews 13:8 says Jesus is the same yes yesterday today and forever he's the same God why don't we see this that Pastor youth leader would say well Travis you have to understand that those were special miracles for the aposto they're for the apostles but the apostolic age is over Miracles are are are no longer done like that so he left that church went to the next Church asked the pastor the same question brother why don't we see some of these Miracles that I read about well Travis you have to understand that the apostolic age is over and the Miracles are passed isn't that exactly what they told brother [Applause] brandom I just didn't sit right with ch went to the next church he was a church Hopper church church church church and he and he goes and he goes to he he goes to his mom's Clos and he finds that book and he starts reading he says oh now this is what I'm talking about this is a man who has the power of God this is what we read about in the days of Jesus and he learns about this man he giv just tells his mom is Mom Mom you got to read this book his mom doesn't know where she got the book she's at a work she's just so happened she's at work and and she's working there as a plumbing secretary and and here walks a man from our

wanted me to read says if he likes that book let me get him some more books goes home and gets the Hallelujah goes against Owen jorgus and Supernatural books gave him that book and Travis started eating those things up and then Travis just started asking everybody he asked everybody anybody that would listen didn't matter who it was hey have you ever heard of William brandham no I never heard of William brandham went to the next person hey have you ever heard of this man William brandham no no never never never heard of that when just so happens he's riding a is an HVAC Tech and there's a man who's who's who he's riding with and just so happens he's a backsliding Believer from our church and Travis says hey Dave have you ever heard of William brandom Dave said every little hair that he had stood straight up and he said ye yeah I have you have you've heard of William random yeah yeah I have there's actually a church that that believes you know he was a great man of God and a great prophet of God he says there's a church that believes in that I get a call that night brother Matt Dave I had heard from him in years thought he was gone didn't even know he was still in in the area I said Dave he says yeah he says I got a problem I said what's the problem Dave he says there's a sinner guy just riding with me complete unbeliever and he asked me who William brandom if I ever heard of William brandham and he says I'm in no condition at all brother Matt to to tell him about that he says is there any way you'd go and you'd talk to him he's really searching for the Lord is there any way you you'd meet him come to my house so I I called my brother I called brother Rick py who goes to this church and we we that was wait way back this has been 12 14 I don't know batt something years ago 14 years ago or so and and and and so call him says there's this man I don't know he's he found a book of brother bandam we're going to go meet him and and and and and and and so we go and we go to the door I knock on the door now I'm just going to tell you what brother Travis says who's sitting right up there in the balcony tonight brother Travis says when the door opened and he said three men walked in he said a voice spoke and said behold men of the Lord Men full of the Holy Ghost he begin to meet him for the first time and begin to talk to him begin to share things with him conversation leads we go to a coffee house the next day meet more and we could just see the supernatural God moving in this and Travis says where's your church we say it's at 2608 Ms Road 26 that little church I pass every day his house he grew up in where he found that book was less than about a thousand yards from our church he said you mean what I've been looking for my whole life oh did you hear me church sometimes what you're looking for is right in the room it's not a million miles away it's right here right now he introduced me to a band years years years later brother Travis's beautiful family sister Deborah our Pano player back home brother Dell Smith's daughter years later we he he he introduces me to a man in the basketball game my son and and I'm there and and I meet he says oh Matt you got to meet this this is I think it was the last church that he went to I believe the man was in some associate pastor some position there at that church and he and he's and and Travis this is I think the last place he'd went to before he found our church and and and and and he he said you got to meet him he's a real good guy I really Travis always had a heart for Him said ever since I found the message I wanted to take it to Marcus and Mary and and it's always been on my heart and he says you got to meet him so I walk over I meet this man he's you know tall strong healthy guy and real comes from a real healthy family and he's and he's there and and I'm I'm speaking to him and meeting him greeting him and so months go by I forget how many it was 6 eight months later and and I get a call and brother Travis says brother Matt he says I I need your help he says I got a terrible word Mary his wife just Marcus you remember the man that you met I said yes he says Mary just called me and Mary said he's he's been diagnosed with stage 4 Hoskins lymphoma and there's no hope for him at all and doctors have given up on him I said you mean you mean the man I just met he says yeah he says he says brother Matt will you go I was the only preacher there all the other Ministry my dad everybody was gone he says will you go and will you lay I want to lay hands on him and I want to pray for him that God will heal him of this and and and and and just so happens I had been studying to preach the next day and I'd been studying all day on the sermon what cancer is healing just so happens so I go to that room go to that that house there not knowing what to expect and I walk in there and there's Marcus and he's there and and he's sitting there in my just a different shell of a man that I had seen is is crippled up there on the couch he's got a man and woman there from his church and they're there you know it's I just there was just just death you could just feel it in the room that he had he had resigned to this and he and he you know he just you could just feel it right when I walked in the room and and he's sitting there and I could see the tumor just about big as a grapefruit just off of his neck and I and I'll never forget this so vivid in my mind and I remember as as as we sat there and he begins to explain and he says well you know this is this is you know this is the end of my road and didn't want to go this way Travis and what did the doctor saying the doctor saying it's hopeless and there's nothing that could be done and it's you know stage four that tried chemo eight times it failed all eight times go home and he says you know this is this is this is it and this is you know just resign you know sometimes it's very easy to have faith for other people and sometimes it's very hard to have faith for yourself and he had just lost all hope and I sat there and I I never forget as Travis begin to say well Marcus he says I just got to tell you you know Travis is real bold he's a sweetheart but he's got a real tender heart but he's he's real bold when it's when it comes to the word and he says he says Marcus he says I got to tell you he says you know when I came to your church he says I was looking for the Living God the god I read about in the book of Acts Supernatural God he says when I came to your church he says I was looking for him and he says Marcus I want to tell you I found that God and that God's Not Dead that God's still alive he's Jesus the same yesterday today and forever and he's the god of Miracles he can still heal you Marcus and you could see the look in that man and Mary his wife there and she's listening and he says I want to tell you he says I want to tell you Marcus that God is Not in your denominations he's not in your Trinity of gods and and the denominations are condemned and and and and and The Trinity is condemned and and he's and Travis goes on this thing and you know that it's you know you're part I'm not telling you you're bad people but I'm telling you that denominations are of the devil and and and I'm thinking oh my goodness don't Travis afterward of wherever in a fox ho I want to be right behind you buddy he didn't shun to Clare and then Travis got to the end of it and Travis just bowed his head he said Marcus he said I hope I didn't offend you he says I hope I I didn't mean to he said I didn't mean to say anything to you he said I just figured that you know it's very Bleak and it's hopeless I just needed to be honest I never forget Marcus man stood there and he sat there and he bowed his head and he said no no Travis He said you didn't offend me he said in fact when you and your friend knocked on the door a voice spoke to me and said these are men sent from the Lord listen to what they have to say friends you may not realize it but God's always working take no thought for what you'll say for in that moment Jesus said said a voice spoke to him and said these are men sent from the Lord listen to what they have to say he said so I was prepared to hear anything you've got to say so I be begin to talk and I said Marcus all I did was take that book healing everything brother bham taught in there and I said Marcus I I want you to know that that that that that that tumor that you have is just a life doctors have given in the name it's cancer and the non Hotchkins L foman they've named it and I said but I want to tell you that that that that that that's a life that's living off of your life it's a demon spirit in Mark n when Jesus prays for the blind man Jesus didn't say death you know give it the doctor's name Jesus says Thou deaf Spirit a living organism living life come out of the man and do not enter him again and I said that life that's living on your life can kill you if the doctors can do everything they can to take it out of your body and that's good that's praise God but listen Marcus that that life wants to kill you and I said I want to tell you today I don't have any bag of doctors tools but I've got a book full of promises in God's word [Applause] and you could feel just the atmosphere of Faith beginning to raise in that b in that little living room you can feel the atmosphere change and I begin to testify to them I said I want to tell you about a little woman if you go to slide 13 I said this little woman I know personally her name is Elena but she lives in Louisiana I said she also was diagnosed with stage four non- Hoskins lymphoma and I said that that little woman I said was diagnosed with the same exact thing and you could see Mary as Mary Mary uh just perked up real quick and I said that little woman was diagnosed with the same exact thing that you've got and I said but I want to tell you a little bit about her testimonial can I read this to you here tonight I found this here sister Elena says it and and she says a week before Christmas I was diagnosed with stage four non- hodkin lyoma two days after Christmas I started the first of 12 chemo treatments they told me that after four treatments they would do a pet scan to see how my body's responding I believe God's A Healer I've told that to anyone who asks what I'm how I'm doing I told them I was looking to him and believe he would heal me on Sunday I leaped and danced before the Lord with joy and victory notice because I realized it was already a finished work you see sometimes you got to do something naturally in order to move something supernaturally oh come on somebody sometimes you got to do something physically naturally to get a supernatural reaction why did nonon have to dip seven times why did Jesus when he prayed for a little blind man didn't just say you're healed he spits on the ground he rolls up some mud what is it the physical brother Bandon would say it this way the natural always runs with the spiritual why did is he standing there with banks woods and he throws a rock up into the air and brother says that Disturbed the atmosphere oh my brother my sister I say it's time if you want to say Amen to the word of God let that word change the atmosphere brother vom said it Disturbed the atmosphere and when it landed it was a tornado our earthquake that almost suck Alaska why did Haddie have to say the right words whatever you say Sister hadie Sister Elena begins to run and dance before the Lord she says I knew it was a finished work even though I didn't know how or when even though there was no proof yet they were singing what have I to dread what have I to fear leaning on the Everlasting sister l begins to say oh I have blessedness with my Lord so near that sounds strange to many but in the Bible maram danced for Joy when she crossed the Red Sea and the Egyptians who had plagued her and enslaved her and bothered her and tormented her when she seen her enemy was dead in the river she began to shout oh my brother my sister when I see the enemy I fought my whole life and when he's cast into the Lake of Fire I believe I'll be dancing and shouting and singing on The Hills of Glory Hallelujah it's a sign and expression of extreme joy and victory I knew my healing would come sooner or later because the Jesus of the Bible the great healer is the same Jesus I served for 27 years yesterday I had my pet scan and today I met my doctor for my fourth treatment go to that next slide he informed me that the cancer is already gone on the left is the cancer on the right is a body that is cancer that's my God that's my Jesus Hallelujah tears begin to well up in Mary she said oh I've always believed in a supernatural God like that I've seen him as a little girl I've seen the supernatural work of God the man put the woman over there say does that mean that God has the H him I said no that's not what it means God has a Divine will it's a sovereign will I don't mean that for a moment but let me tell you what God can do sir God can heal God can save God can set free there's nothing too hard for my God we begin to sit there and i' begin to begin to say just you could see the tears welling up in Mary you could see the atmosphere entire atmosphere change I begin to pray IID never forget that moment as I laid my hands on Marcus here he's full of cancer you could see him in that slide there you can see the cancer just going through his body there he is is with this tumor you can go to the next one the tumor that's about the size of a grapefruit on his neck he had it all down his body down his calves go to the next slide is pet scan full of cancer in the normal pet scan you can see a black spot here for the liver and the in the heart you can't even see anything he's covered he had on his calf he had he had tumors the size of apples ate up and I begin to never forget laying my hands on him I begin to to pray and I said God I'd be reminded of that man in the Bible who couldn't get to Jesus and his condition he had gotten so bad he couldn't get to him you might know somebody like that here tonight that Satan is so tangled up and messed up and you realize they'd never be in a church like this I how God how could you even save my my my child he's so lost and at never even be in a church like this never never even be a meeting like this maybe they're so so torn up with some disease or something in their body and my mind just begin to think of that little man on that bed brother the Daryl and he couldn't get to the Lord but my Bible says that his friends picked up his [Music] bed and they begin to take his body to Jesus and the Bible says that when they got to Jesus he was surrounded by people in a little Hut but that wasn't going to stop the faith of that mother or that father or that Pastor it wasn't going to stop the faith of those friends my Bible says they climbed up on the roof and they ripped the roof off and they lowered him down to Jesus Jesus and Jesus said by your faith this man is made he they may not be here tonight they may be a million miles away but I challenge you to rip the roof off tonight and say God I am lowering them down I'm lowering them down to you Lord Jesus let me give you what the words of the lord gave me just a day before before I came here and God reminded me supernaturally of this God gave me the words and I'll take them I'll give them to you just the way he gave to me I want to tell somebody don't give up on your Miracle you take that from the Lord don't give up on your miracle I don't care if they're not here tonight I don't care if they're in a barroom somewhere where I don't care how lost and how many years it has been don't you let the devil rearrange it and try to rearr it and say it'll be this way and God must have been it this way you hold on to that promise God Made [Applause] You Don't abort it don't abort it I began to pray I said Lord just as Hezekiah asked for years who's going to give a death sentence and ask for years I pray for this man who stood for you he's a preacher God he's he's preached from your Bible he's spoken about you Lord if he was if he was not ashamed of you then God don't be ashamed of him Lord would you heal this man you know what we did after we prayed that prayer you say brother Matt did the room shake no could have I'd have loved it handwriting on the wall could have didn't you know what we did we took our burdens to the Lord and we left them there and that's all you can do and we walked out months go by forget how many months it was months go by Brother Travis just so happens to be in my living room sitting there talking to me where is talking about things you know nothing really important Travis is just in the middle of a sentence I never forget he pulls out his phone and Matt Mary begins to read the text praise God Marcus has been supernaturally healed of stage four non hosin lymphoma he is cancer Hallelujah that's my God I said that's Jehovah Gyra he is still Jehovah Rafa Marcus was supernaturally healed of cancer and I say whatever you need tonight he's the same God in the room what you're looking for ain't down the road it's right here right now whatever you need Reach Out Reach Out say God I accept it in the name of the Lord I accept it in the name of the Lord musicians could you come hallu I accept it in the name of the Lord could you do that here tonight friends don't give up on your miracle thank you Lord he is still Jehovah Gyra he is still Jehovah Raa and he is more than ever before wanting to pour out the supernatural oh thank you Lord God I think of many needs her tonight I think of how many needs we have in this body I think of my brother Ron Spencer there in Virginia and let me tell you something the doctors might say one thing but drct Jesus says another whose report will you believe I said whose report will you believe the report of cancer the the report of what the naysayers say and the doubter I say I choose to believe the words of the Lord that they are yay and amen they are thus saith the Lord it is God's promise not my promise wonder if you take that need raise it up as you byow your heads and say Lord I'm representing behind my hand all the needs in our body the needs of this church those listening online I bring those needs up I believe my Bible told me to to speak them to bring those needs before the Lord it's not just one it's many there's not just one or two friends I know the needs of the body are many many many but I've got a go God who says it's never too late don't you give up on your miracle I don't care how lost I don't care how far away I don't care how distant it looks I don't care how many years it's been don't you give up on that Supernatural God friends if we lose that Supernatural God we are doomed it will take a supernatural Miracle to change your body one day and I say Lord let me not restrict you let me not hinder you let me not hamper you let me say God I give you freedom I give you Reign I give you full control Lord to move to speak to to operate I give it to you God I'm going to lay aside all my ideas I'm just going to come before you nothing in my hands I bring simply to thy cross I clean I give it to God now whatever that need is I wonder if you'd put your hand over on that person beside you I wonder if you'd bind your faith together you call out you call out to God for whatever your need is I believe this church could call the name of a mighty warrior brother Ron Spencer who's Faithfully stood and preached this message in country after country brother man who in in great need stands for the message of the hour not just brother Ron but many names we can name here tonight whatever that need is I wonder if this church would just begin to call on God and say God we've heard about it we've spoken about it we've preached about it but now we're Believers we're going to believe about it God we're going to stand upon the promises the unfailing promises of almighty God I don't care if it's that boy or that girl or that mother who's walked away or that father who's walked away nothing is too late nothing is too hard nothing is too far gone as long as there's breath in the body there's a miracle waiting to happen oh God we raise up our voices here tonight Lord in this room we feel your presence God that Supernatural angel is moving through this building right now wanting to touch lives he's wanting to kill Hearts he's wanting to mend Brokenness he's wanting to restore homes may you move oh God your Prophet told us anybody who's Born Again by the spirit of God is a candidate for the supernatural power anybody who's born of the spirit I say I am a candidate for angels of God to move upon my heart and my life oh let's start this meeting out with a move say God I got I unrestrict you tonight move Holy Ghost move in every heart oh God move in every life Lord Jesus you're still the same yesterday today and forever there is nothing too hard for you God there's nothing
