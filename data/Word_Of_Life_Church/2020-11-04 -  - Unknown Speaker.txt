TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you know we have so many choices in life to make the prophet said it this way in choosing of a bride he said there's another choice that we have in life and that's a life's companion a young man or a young woman stepping out and life has been given a right to make a choice the young man chooses and the woman has a right to accept or reject but it's still a choice on both sides both the man and the woman they have a right to a choice now it's very hard for me dealing with this because we got people sitting here people get the videos and people get the tapes who made the wrong choices in life when it comes to companion and i realize every time i deal with it always makes some nervous some jittery some always get their feelings hurt at me but friend i've got to preach the word of god i've got to say it if it's my brother my sister my wife my mother and don't make no difference i cannot cut no corner i've got to declare the word of god in the right attitude the right spirit and let you know that god by his grace surely every one of us has made so many wrong choices in life but the only way we can ever come to grips and peace with those wrong decisions is to not blame god but accept the responsibility ourselves and say lord help me to live with the consequences of my wrong choice he said a man in his right mind that's planning a future should choose that wife very carefully be careful what you're doing in a woman choosing a husband or accepting the choice of a husband should be real careful what she's doing especially in these days a man should think and pray before he chooses a wife and yet as many of us here today who didn't do that now many of you were lost you wasn't serving god i'm not using some denominator church and they never taught you these things but some of you done it after you come to the truth why because you didn't wait you didn't wait on god to get that real choice god help me you see when god placed you on this earth you men god ordains you to have a certain companion that companion come down to the stream of time she was not born in another age oh no she was not born in luther's age and you born here but she was born in your age and your time frame and if you will wait on god you will connect one day but it is satan's way to get you messed up and get you to blame god for your choice for your choice a man should pray earnestly for he could ruin his entire life how does that mean that people who have been messed up in the marriage that mean they're lost no does that mean they'll not be in heaven no does that mean they're not sons or daughters of god no but it only means by making the wrong choice in life they can have hell on this earth god wanted them to have this companion here that he ordained for them because of their nature be complemented to their nature and if they don't wait on god and they get the wrong woman and they'll fuss and bicker and argue back and forth their entire marriage it'll never be what god wanted god wanted them to get the right one to raise children to love one another to have godliness in their home they wind up with this sister instead of the ordained one now they both will go to heaven if they love the lord and born again but once they cross over the veil you'll get the right one you should have had here now whose choice was that the choice was you get the right one now but your choice give you the wrong one now god cannot say i ordain this man and this and this man this woman this man this woman this man this woman this man this woman and then when you get down your life then god say i'm going to go contrary to what i've already ordained my own will and i'm going to predestinate this man marry this woman just for confusion just be mean to it choices we make don't blame god god's choice has already been declared and god's choice is his word and when something goes wrong check your choice by god's and see if it lines up come on church now watch he said a man could ruin his life remember the vow is until death do we part and a man could ruin his life by making the wrong choice and if he knows it and he knows he's making the wrong choice and marry's a woman that's not fit to be his wife and does it anyhow then it's his fault and if the woman takes a husband and no it's not fit to be a husband then it's your own fault after you know what's right and wrong how many of you said and you have known truth been raised in the message get away from the lord backside and go out there marry some man and then you find out your life is nothing but hell on her you mean to tell me god puts a woman through that nonsense we do it our choice in life choices why because you're a free moral agent oh my brother donny if god ordained for me to have it why don't god just override me why don't god override my will why don't god because god's program is not set up that way if god would override your will then god would be a task master god wants you to be healed how come this folks you're sick if god's going to override your will on that why don't he override him on joy on peace the right woman this this this this but you are a mortal and those choices are put before you oh children question answers look at this my brethren do you know many times we get the wrong mate here on earth now wait a minute we get the wrong one now you see some people get the wrong one but they never get divorced they just live together all their life but they have nothing but trouble well some will get the wrong one but there's escalation accepts trouble they'll get divorced now them kind of people are the ones that are more looked down because their choice is visible it's more visible oh sure their marriage didn't work out well everybody can tell they've got a divorce or you made the wrong one but there may be other people that are sitting there that made just as bad of a choice but because theirs doesn't escalate to a divorce there's this more hid behind they're still together but you see it'll never be what god ordained to me i cannot believe that god ordained marriages to be fussing and fighting and squabbling i cannot believe that god made the woman amen not to love her husband or the husband to love his wife out of the donny even as christ loved the church but i could preach that every night for 15 years in a row and some of you could never attain to it you know why because you got the wrong one choices we make now what do we have to do we can't blame god god's give you as he did israel when you go in the inhabitants drive out all the inhabitants of the land but benjamin chose not to do it manasseh chose not to do it ephraim chose not to do it even as you chose i know this is hard friends but i've got to tell you the truth many times you get the wrong mate in the earth now what is god's will what was god's choice that every son of god get the right mate right now once some pretty pair of brown eyes or gray eyes vamps you into a place that you shouldn't have listened but let me say this you might have the wrong companion if you got the wrong companion in this life you'll never have it on the other side so it proves to me sons of god can have the wrong one here and still be sons now he didn't say if you get the wrong one here you won't be there but he said if you get the wrong one here now that decision does not change your eternal destination hey man aren't you god if you make the wrong choice that does not god say all right that's it boy i had this woman for you and you married somebody else that proves you're not a son of god no and listen friends many of you may have married this woman than sin and that woman and whatever it was and when you come to church and come to the truth you finally found the right one that was all those marriage and divorce marriage and divorce was that the will of god no had you sought god you would have found this right sister anyhow amen but it's choices that we make not god not god and while i'm here let me say it real plain god's perfect and original will even in time under the sex law you young men listen to me god's will is not for you to marry some young girl in this church or some other church and then if that don't work out divorce her and get you another one and divorce her and get you another just keep on going do you find this right 47 times down the road that is not god's way god only gave us divorce because of the hardness of people's hearts god's way is pray and wait i don't care how long they've been married that divorce thing haunts people all of their lives every time a preacher mentions it something swells up in other oh god god's way is not that god's way is pray pray pray make the right choice
