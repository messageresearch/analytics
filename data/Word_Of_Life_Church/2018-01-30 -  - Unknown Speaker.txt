what's the thing that he knows my name and by we I mean you let's help brother Harry sing this song this morning you know the vastness of the universe brother Donnie's been sharing some things with isn't it it's really incomprehensible for us just those millions and millions of millions of miles and I can't sit through a red light two times without going crazy I just can't think about that kind of distance in space and time but with all that vastness he knows my name every step that I take every move that I make it's it's just a it's a blessing to know and he has his his care and attention to detail in our lives just never ceases to amaze me listen let's stand this morning his brother Donnie gets ready to come and let's help brother Harry sing this song this morning if you don't mind he counts the stars one and all he knows how much sand is on the shore he sees every sparrow he made the mountains and seas and roll creatures [Music] this morning every step [Music] never Tina well can't see the Justino I don't know the words [Music] since stores I don't know lot of thing I don't have the answers to the questions aloud [Music] knows my name every step [Music] well by the can't see the light I know I'll be just fine [Music] praise the Lord I was telling Caroline I'm when we left the service you know it's greatest he is with all that he's done what a little bit that we've been able to see that he's done yet if he couldn't forgive and couldn't pardon and couldn't understand us as feeble mortals really what good but all that do he could speak and the worlds could come into existence make so many many stars that we can't even count them but yet if he couldn't understand how we are couldn't be our Savior our Redeemer I love him for that don't you I'm sure that there's so much about the greatness of our God and the things that he has done I don't believe we'll ever comprehend it in time when we get there he'll make known to us that which is good for us and beneficial for sure let's turn again today if you would to the book of cautions chapter one praise the Lord thank you Jesus Colossians chapter 1 verse 15 so I ask you again today what is your beloved more than another what makes him different what makes him special your Jesus let's take the words of Paul answer this who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him we're all things created that are in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him he is before all things and by him all things Revelation chapter 4 verse 11 thou art worthy O Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created as I said last night even things about God's creation that you and I may not care for winter time is probably not most of our favorite seasons ice snow Frost maybe there's different animals that we really don't like we just really don't care for them we don't like their demeanor we don't like their behavior but yet God created all these things for his pleasure many of them most of us will never even see in life most of the rare insects and spiders and snakes and all kinds of African animals that lives on the plains most of you will never see them most of you will never even know their existence you can't even pronounce their names so it's evident that they're not just here for your benefit but they are for his pleasure if we could ever get that in our minds today this is the why we're serving God for his pleasure not just for our own it's not just so much what can I get out of Jesus it's what can Jesus get out of me it was our heads together and pray today if you wouldn't Heavenly Father thank you once again Lord Jesus that we could come together in this allotted time we would be able to gather together and church on Sunday what an honor it is to sing to worship to pray to bring prayer requests and testimonies things that you have done among us in such a wonderful way now father were approaching the Word of God and we believe that this word is so vital important to our lives you told us when you were here that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God you know the word has such wonderful wonderful things of the content and the context of the word is so astounding but we know what we need father is not just the logos but the Rhema word which is the word which is in season for where we are I pray that you speak to us today Lord those things that we have needa you say all these hundreds of people that are gathered here today there's absolutely no way that I would be able to speak something that would go to every heart but you can so we're just asking that you would that you would take charge Lord help me that I can get out of the way that you can use that part of yourself that you put in my life to a gift the same thing in them the ability to hear anointest that we can receive from your presence today in Jesus name we ask amen god bless you Saints you may be seated let's read job chapter 38 if you would verse 31 we looked at the almighty last night as he was speaking to job about very common things that job had saw on the earth but yet job could not make eye hoarfrost we've been through the snow the wind God goes on to ask him about the hinds as they will care the unicorn many many things that God relates to job the levy earth on which job has no understanding of even how they work or how they operate as great as science has advanced today there are many many things about what God asked job thousands of years ago they still don't know about and they never will because God has limited man's ability of breaking into his laboratory in so far and he won't let him go any farther because he is the Almighty so last night we looked at it where God had mentioned to job and then we broke down in verse 30 but today we'd like to pick up if we can in verse 31 canst thou bind the sweet influences of cádiz or loose the bands of Orion now let me settle you again as I said last night many message folks at altura an aperture goes to talking about stars and the heavenly hosts and the planets and this and that because they have heard the false side which makes them afraid and they relate it to astrology but let me emphasize to you again we are not talking about astrology but astronomy astronomy is of God astrology is of the devil astrology is just something there is a scarecrow to try to keep us away from the real true facts of what God has done now we call them planets so does God God also calls them stars so there are many heavenly bodies that are identified by creation and they vary in degrees as far as size luminosity purpose and all of that as we do as the people of God we could not take a very small planet one that does not shine very great one that does not have a great magnetic pull and look at that one and say you are not necessary if God made it it is necessary we might look at our lives as Christians and saying what have I ever done what if I ever accomplished for the plan of God I've never really led that many people to the Lord it's not that I have that much gravitational pull about my walk with God - I've affected many people my spiritual luminosity comparing it to the Stars is not very great I've never had that many people to come up to me and say oh you're a Christian you're a child of God I sense something special about you and you might sense that you've never really done that much for God I guarantee you every child of God on the earth has a great purpose in the plan of God I'm convinced most of us will never even know the effect that we have had in the plan of God until we get on the other side the people we've influenced the people we've affected and people that we were totally unaware of that God allowed us to affect them it's the same way with say heavenly bodies there are some that are so great and we'll look at some of them today are tourists Beetlejuice some of the ones that are just magnificent the great red glowing planets and their size comparison to the Sun some of them a thousand times larger than our Sun some of them twenty two thousand times larger than our Sun and yet each one of them have their place in the economy of God but we realize it's not always how big we are but it's finding our place in the place of where God wants us to be something can be very very small and very insignificant in relativity to where you had compared it to other things in size and yet that very small thing may fulfill such a wonderful purpose that it's beyond human comprehension how that God would do such now as I mentioned to you last night let me repeat it again today that the scientists and what they've been able to observe thus far was helped with Hubble and with Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 that they estimate that there are 70 sextillion stars in the known universe show them how many zeros that is brother Daniel that's more fingers and toes and we've all got today all the streamers of the world wouldn't be able to put all of our toes and fingers together with me now as brother joel said these numbers overwhelm you they do me and I want them to I want these things in these facts to totally overwhelm you so you will understand how great our God is and how little that we are but yet how great he loves us and his concern now notice this in Genesis chapter 1 verse 16 get the next one ready brother Daniel the pale blue dot God made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also I love the way Moses did that he just concealed trillions and trillions of stars in those few words and he made the stars also and God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth so God made the Sun and you could take 1 million of our earths and place in that Sun the moon and the stars but yet God made them for the benefit of this tiny blue dot February the 14th 1990 Apollo 1 was leaving our solar system NASA directed it to turn its cameras back toward home as the camera from Voyager 1 come back toward Earth this is the picture that it took that little dot that's your home that is 3.7 billion miles from Voyager and yet God so loved that tiny blue dot he made the Sun so bright and so brilliant for life on that dot he placed the moon in its orbit 238,000 miles out there so its gravitational pull would be able to affect the tides on that tiny blue dot now you you are in the middle of trillions and trillions of stars and yet this is your home and what a Lord God wanted to condemn sin to the greatest act of condescension he'd ever done he did not pick Betelgeuse he did not pick raise your hell he did not take some of the great great planets in the universe it shows that tiny blue dot praise Peter God that little speck of dust but believe it or not that little speck of dust is ordained to life out of all those planets as great as they are all of those stars as great as they are science has never found a one of them that has life but this one has life who are you in comparison to the world a little speck of dust what is this church in comparison to the world churches a tiny speck of dust what are we in comparison to all the peoples of the earth a tiny speck of dust but what makes us so wonderful and blessed in the eyes of God this tiny speck of dust is ordained to the eternal life so you see you don't always have to be the greatest planet you don't have to be the largest planet or the one with the greatest luminosity you have to be the one that God chose Genesis 1:18 think about the Daniel to rule over the day and over the night to divide the light from the darkness and God saw that it was good now the stars of course declare a story they are natural be no time but they are also spiritual representatives of the way back to God in Genesis 15 5 speaking of Abraham he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the Stars if shall be able to numbers in and he said unto Him so shall thy seed be Genesis 22 17 that in blessing I will bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven so the stars also symbolize children and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and the stars can also have a spiritual representation of human beings Joseph in his dream and Genesis 37 9 he dreamed yet another dream and he told his brethren and said behold I have dreamed a dream more and behold the son which was his father and the moon which was his mother and the eleven stars which were his brothers made obeisance to me so God then uses the Stars the Sun the Moon the heavenly host and the heavenly bodies to be able to represent great stories of obedience and Submission and also Redemption notice again in judges chapter 5 verse 19 the kings came and fought them notice now they fought the kings of Canaan Betina by the waters of Megiddo they took no gain of money they fought from heaven the stars in their courses against Caesarea listen el they fought from heaven the stars in their courses they fought against cess RIA now this is one of the great battles of the children of Israel whenever God had declared he would be with them but God is now allowing the paths of the stars to be able to affect the influence of what's going on on the earth now remember one of the things that God asked Joel was can you bind the sweet influences of Pleiades now of course Pleiades is the constellation of the Seven Sisters and it is a forerunner of the spring equinox which is prophesying that the earth is fixing to come under the sweet influence of the heavenly bodies now what's this josephus tree like this and about this battle that we just read eisah battle began a violent tempest came on a great downfall of rain and a hailstorm which drive in full in the faces of the Canaanites so blinded and benumbed them with coal they could neither use their bows with effect nor hold their swords yet the book of Judges the writer of Judges does not describe to us all of these but just Josephus in story him tells us what actually happened so there was rain and there was driving wind and there was hail and yet they all sir of the book of Judges identifies this with the stars of the heavens that they are assisting man upon the earth now you'll have to take of course the scriptural word in the spiritual understanding of this that no doubt there's many influences that the stars the Sun and the moon have upon the effect on the earth that science knows absolutely nothing about and really I think if we needed to know a whole lot about it God would have enlightened us in his word you agree with that but yet we can see little excerpts of that influence by which God was able to project that notice again in Psalms chapter 8 verse 3 when I consider the heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast or now there's always been something about the heavens that has mesmerized man not only those who were god-fearing but those others as well psalms 136 and six to him that stretched out the earth above the waters for His mercy endureth forever to him that made great lights for his mercy endureth for ever the Sun to rule the day for His mercy endureth forever o beginning the thought of what David is saying those heavenly bodies and their influence are placed up in the heavens because of the mercy of God that's right notice the moon and the stars to rule the night for His mercy endureth forever Psalms 148 three praise ye Him Sun and Moon praise him all ye stars of light praise Him ye heaven of heavens and that be above the heavens amen let them praise the name of the Lord for he commanded and they were created now you and I of course do not have the ability to be able to hear the stars and say whether they sing whether it is or orbital noise and those of you that have looked into this you know that scientists actually recorded sounds out in the universe so whether it is those which are intelligible to a recorder and they're able to pick it up or whether it is in their own star language that we do not have the ability to be able to receive their frequency somehow another the Sun the Moon the Stars the heavenly hosts they are worshipping God as I said last night if they're doing it then there's Christians we ought to do it as well Psalms are Isaiah 14:13 for thou was said in thine heart I will ascend into heaven speaking to Satan I would exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation on the sides of the north and we know of course we've looked at this many many times that they stars all the Messiah's brothers or the Messiah's progeny here again is identified in a spiritual symbol that the stars he drew a third part of the stars of heaven which was a symbol of the angels which followed it with the devil a jeremiah 31 35 thus sayeth the Lord which giveth the Sun by death by light by day and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for light by night now you see God with someone who set up the ordinances which are the laws of the universe this is the reason why that we can look up in the sky we see Orion we see Pleiades we see Virgo we see libera we see all of these stars that have been there Adam saw the same thing and man has looked at this for thousands of generations what have they not moved from those original spots they are kept there by the ordinance of God they are kept there because it pleases him to tell the story of redemption by the term called the zodiac which lays on the elliptical view of the angle about what you are able to view them how you go outside of our little place a habitable zone as it is called you would not even see the constellations in the same way remember the constellations are gathered together so the people on this little blue dot can view them and read the story now if you'd go out to Jupiter and try to look at the same constellations you'll get all mixed up and you wouldn't get the right interpretation of the story because you got to be where there's life in order to understand what the life giver is saying praise be to God notice this now he said which divideth to see when the waves are of roar the Lord of Hosts is his name Daniel chapter 12 verse 3 and they that shall be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament talking about the saints now and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever now it shows the personification of glory which will be revealed to in the latter times to the elect of God as we move into our glorified bodies our glorified bodies is actually the answer to the parallel the glory of God was just given to the stars er luminosity in the beginning actually Burma glow up before the Lord and we are rewarded according to what he's been able Duss to do on this earth he will say enter into the glories of the Lord they new to this kingdom which is prepared for you before the foundation of the world there will be degrees in eternity as there are degrees in time now what if that degrees we won't look at it the same way we do now most people have a hard time dealing with degrees now because of jealousy and this and that if someone can sing better than them preach better than them play the guitar better than them a lot of folks really have a hard time with that but once we get into eternity and we reverted back to the original glory there will still be diversities of glories there there always has been there always will be but yet the part about us that bothers us will no longer be there so we will be able to see the Apostles setting on throw Thrones nobody will be jealous of it will see their names written on their will see the 24 elders will see all of these things that God will have and yet nobody will be bothered by know about it be over in their little mansion apartment said I'm so aggravated my name wasn't wrote on the city gate I can't believe that then Jesus know what a great benefit I was to the kingdom of God thank God that part about us all will absolutely be an ally didn't be changed but yet there will be glory so here God likens the Saints that will receive glory two stars and how they will shine so the Stars will in the glory of God in the kingdom of God in the world that is to come surely you don't believe that you and I will have the same position as were the Twelve Apostles or would even the prophet of God of our age there's no way but yet it's not like we're going to be unhappy with what we are we will be as the stars because the transfer of the glory which has been viewed by man for thousands of years will now receive its height in eternity and here will be the real stars of God sons and daughters of God living in the kingdom around us - Owen hallelujah and we will be answering back to what he has done for us and enabled us to do no jealousy no sickness no pain no heartaches all that world done away with hey man notice Amos chapter 5 verse 8 seek him that make us the seven stars the seven stars of the Seven Sisters or clear these and Orion in his strange that a prophet of God would tell the people to seek him who makes the Stars and turneth the shadow of death into the morning and make us sad a dark and night that caller for the waters of the sea and pour sand out upon the face of the earth the Lord is his name notice in Jude in the New Testament out chapter one verse thirteen raging waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wandering stars to whom is reserved the blackness of Darkness forever again a spiritual symbol so here we see those in who will follow away from truth they are likened to wandering stars so it is a symbol of a meteorite or a comet which moves out of its particular orbit and moves down into another orbit and when it does hit breaks down which we say well that was a shooting star know that one a shooting star that was a meteorite and it was something that dropped down into the Earth's atmosphere and when it does what happens to them they are burned up what will happen to those who leave the Word of God and leave the truth and never come back and repent they will drop down in the atmosphere or the in time message and there they will be annihilated I'd say I hate to say it but it's the truth Revelation chapter 1 verse 16 and it had in his right hand seven stars again our spiritual symbol now remember he who made Pleiades he who made the Seven Sisters called and made the seven brothers you see the church ages did not need the Seven Sisters they needed the seven messengers thank you Jesus happens fresh from the man of heaven right there he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth when a short two edged sword and his countenance was as the son shyness in his strength verse 20 the mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the seven angels of the seven churches and Happy Valley said now these are the words of Jesus amen so seven stars were in his right hand and those he tells us those stars were actually messengers to the churches this is why we believe we need one that's right it's not our words it's the words of the Lord Jesus and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches chapter 2 verse 1 under the Angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks which are the church again revelation 3:1 under the Angel of the Church of Sardis write these things saith he that have the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I know thy works if thou hast a name that thou livest and art dead revelation 12:1 and there appeared another great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the Sun now here is Israel clothed with the Sun the moon under her feet and on her she had a crown of twelve stars verse four and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth so stars then can be spiritual symbols of a child which Christ it was we know it was a symbol of him it was also a symbol the devil is he truth is with his tail he drew the third part of the stars which was fallen angels it was a symbol of Joseph and his brothers but now let's go back to the stars itself because God is not speaking to job of the spiritual aspect but more the natural aspect so he asked him this question can now bind the sweet influences of Pleiades or loose the bands of Orion now this is as we said the constellation of the Seven Sisters or please whichever you prefer to call it and it comes in the rising in the spring and God is projecting from a deity standpoint something what science may never relate to never understand and that is that the constellations have an effect or a parallel of what is going on on the earth so God actually uses the word and he calls it sweet can South be able to bind the sweet influences out please not asking him about the luminosity of Pleiades or the glory of Pleiades but about the influence so the stars you have an influence on the earth you believe that these are God's words so it is the pleasantness of its position in the earth now those of you that know a thing about this you know that whenever you look at those constellations they appear in Greater time now when we go into the fault we see of course Orion which comes around around October September October goes up to January February be even possibly into March and whenever you see him he is a symbol of cold and winter and storms but yet when you see the Seven Sisters where we are and you look how according to what are you on the Earth's and the way the earth still surround that you see them in different times so God actually uses them as a symbol again as he said in Amos 5 a seek him that maketh the seven stars and Araya so the appearance of spring is four on are the heavenly stars so record of God was going to call a bride in the last days Rick and it sent a church or an automobile reckon what God but decline in the heavens stars angels now whatever Pleiades begins to move around to word that it is visible and the spring equinox comes upon the earth the earth is going to start releasing its influence of winter time now the constellation whether or not God is speaking poetically or God is speaking scientifically in the sense that there is a natural force by gravitational pull that is affecting on the on the planet well I don't know we'll ask you maybe when we get up there but God relates this as if though there is an influence from Pleiades itself to the earth and he identifies this as the influence when the earth is going to be released out the harshness of winner now it won't be long that Pleiades will appear again and she'll be so visible and so beautiful and in the night skies of May June July August September absolutely just phenomenal the way she appears but where's her coming is a loosening of something on the earth Laurie so the eyes that we looked at last night the snow and the things that accompanied by winner was the for running or the Ryan the hunter she now breaks that hole and another cycle is coming upon the earth which is what spring these stars God placed them there and part of the mystery of redemption as well so God now is relating to job part of the things that he along those that he asked job all you you think you're smart you think you know so much can you bind up the sweet influences of Pleiades now you're a human smart alec and you just question me how come I'm letting you go through this how come I'm letting you go Saturday and walk world's going on in your life and you think you know so much about stuff and you're questioning me about what I let you go through now let me ask you a few questions big boy apparently Jobe had developed an attitude in this trial now God says before the trial that the man is perfect he's upright and there's nothing wrong with the man but we can watch the man as he goes through the trial and he goes to developing some attitudes well praise the Lord anybody ever been there and done that besides me and Jobe you ever goes through a trial and go to develop an attitude and getting real mouthy with God that's what Joe Basu it Joba developed a real lousy lousy attitude with God this is why God's absolute ly wearing him out God uses lightning bolts he uses clouds he uses goats he uses unicorns he uses Arcturus he uses all kinds of things to finally job says our repentance eye calls analysis I'm sorry Lord I shouldn't have said those things now it would appear that Joe did not have this attitude but remember he had never been in this particular place before and this trial that he was going through was not only proving him but it was also proving something about Jobe that God already knew but no doubt Joe did not even know and recognize in himself because this trial was bringing it out the friend please don't misunderstand me you know God allows us to go through things sometimes that will bring out the deep things that are buried within our spirit always and our maker that maybe you've never had a trial so far that's ever brought that weakness out of you and God will allow something to come your way as apparently did with Joe and that brought something out of Jobe an attitude a harshness a mousy thing toward God that maybe Jobos told me surprise I can't believe I'm saying this to God what is the matter with me I cannot leave I've got this attitude toward God anybody ever been there and then when you're met 11 she say hog the world's the matter with me what am I saying what am i doing well me and garden Shogun brother and really we've been there the rest of you I hope y'all if you don't brother Donnie I have I've opened my big fat mouth and questioned God God why this and how come that so God is now bringing showed to that spot so you've got such an attitude ami would you care to make me a little hoarfrost this morning before breakfast well I seems to be your favorite word I felt what I want you to do I like for you to call the lightning bolt out of heaven would you first of all do you understand how they work boy do you understand how to make a bolt of fire that will reach 50 thousand votes hotter than the surface of the scythe I'll settle for one five thousand three you can even use an angle batter come on man make something you know so much sometimes God has to shame us because in reality we need to be shamed well praise the Lord now God is asking Joel these questions he knows he can't it's amazing to me that the writer of joven all these questions when God asked it I don't know if job is sitting there looking all the way y'all were looking at me when I'm preaching or if job's answer is not even worth answer or if Joe does not say a word till chapter 42 but if he does God don't give him no room to write down his response everything is God that God lays it on him and God says can you do this are you the one who calls the line for a are you the one who causes the hansik at the ring there's an answer to you can you look up to the crowds of the bottles of heaven can you stop this can you do that can you do this and you do that and you do this sometimes we just need a good war bit so when the Pleiades comes around the earth the temperature starts warming up on the globe the ice starts melting the rivers and creeks and streams and ponds which were held but the harshness of the influence of Orion the water start melted the days start getting longer the temperature starts climbing on the earth the sweet influence of days may I take this this way for a few moments I remember my life Alfa mended the influence of the Civil Star I remembered my life in a world of Pentecostal blackness and darkness when I thought us doing something for God I remember my life wandering around and trying to understand what God was and how much more there must be about God something down in my soul calling for more of God but it didn't know what it was God let me get underneath the influence of the seven star for a pizza God and when I started hearing and when I started reading and what that prophet of God had to say and listening to those tapes the waters of life started on thawing out of my soul praise be to God I had no longer walk by the down and the darkness that I walked into and the prior understanding that I had what was it the change at all it was the influence of the seven star don't you appreciate it today no glory glory to God notice can you bind the sweet influences brother Daniel has shown some pictures of Pleiades can Dowe canst thou bind the sweet influences of 3ds or loose the bands of Orion now once you look at these stars how they vary and what scientists call luminosity there's apostles prophets pastors and teachers and then there's song leaders in there and their special singers and there's rooted musicians and their Sunday School teachers and there's people who can work in the library and people that can make tapes and there's all kinds of oh y'all didn't see that look at the luminosity of these stars look at how they vary look at how one bigger and the size look at how that they shine and the others that you know it's absolutely amazing because what you see in the heavens is what you see reflected in the church but online unlike us on the earth I don't argue in fuss and debate now I want to be this and I want to be broader god this ain't fair don't you understand what you've done you missed a grand opportunity you made me a point eight in the luminosity I should be a point two now the way they measure luminosity the smaller the number the brighter it is Lord you made me a point eight that was a bad mistake I don't want of the greatest Christians in this message I'm one of the greatest most devout most holy most humble most liar I'm either mosa I may have a slight problem with bragging lord but I mean all of the stars have some flaws hallelujah Adam looked up when God made him the first night after his creation you imagine his father come down and the son says come here son let me show you something human I made all of them Wow double Wow quadruple waffle sextillion Wow now let me show you the story this plane out here hung across the elliptic is going to be termed as the zodiac or in other words the zodiac word means the way let me show you those twelve symbols and this begins with the Virgin ends with a lion it's the mystery of redemption you made all the kind of what nothing I just spoke it's freaky you imagine Adam walking around sir Wow so God says to choke you're so familiar with survival can you bind the influences of the Seven Sisters come be excused I need gross bathroom I need to drink water set out job you're gonna hear my sermon think of it friends they've never moved now as you behold this year you see some absolutely wonderful things those seven bright stars that some of these others that you see behind them aren't stars they're galaxies which contain millions of stars within themselves but the view of Hubble Deep Field when you're able to look at this you're seeing trillions of stars at one time and here you are living on this little blue pail dot and the mighty God the mighty God did all this for you next can you bind the sweet influences can you be able to affect speak to them would you all like to tell them to do something but mother that's the pitcher will go out and that will all come to your house tell us what time you're gonna do it by the word of the Lord where the heavens made and the hostess thank you for the daring to get a Ryan ready consult bind the sweet influences of Pleiades or loose the bands of Orion job chapter 9 verse 7 which commanded the Sun and it rises not and seal earth up the stars which a long span us out the heavens and travels upon the waves of the sea which make us our tourists Orion and Pleiades and the chambers of the south which newest great things pass finding out yay and wonders I said it last night let me say it again this is one reason why I hate my fears don't look at me like you know what I'm talking about I heard God say in his word I'll do this and I'll never leave you now never forsaken yet I'll get my back up against the wall sometimes and I don't know the way out I don't know which way it's gonna go and what do I feel my nameís human fear and I hate it you got a bill that you don't know how you're gonna pay your other doctor tells you about a sickness or disease and what does the devil try to do trusted group how hard your children or the waivers are gone from god oh god they're gonna be also god they're gonna be lost what is it you know the same thing that I feel it's a human fear and the God who made all of this cannot he help us you think he loves Pleiades more than brother Keith Phillips he who hung those stars and gave the ordinance of the universe cannot he speak this very day to our brother's body but that disease is trying to take his life and silly things whatever you're facing whatever you're going through and maybe you're on the winter time of an Orion and the influence of its bands it's so gripped upon your life and you seem like nothing's gonna break hold on Springs coming please rise in the sky can sell buying the sweet influences of Pleiades or loose the bands this constellation appears in the winter bring the high raging winds this is the constellation actually the Paul dealt with in the book of Acts this was the rise a part of what Paul was dealing with you see the winter time reflecting upon the earth is reflecting what Paul was going through as a winter time a cycle a very terrible cycle maybe some of you are there now you can imagine as ancient people begin to look in the skies under the direction of Adam which handed it down to Noah as I mentioned to you last night these constellations are in every major nationality culture and religion of the world they are reflected even the 12 signs of the zodiac are reflected in every aspect every civilization the Mayan Indians the Aztecs who evermore the Great Pyramids of Giza are built in an exact replica of the year 10,000 735 BC the way they would have been lined up over the plaza or the desert rather of the state of Egypt and they built it exactly with the same thing the Mayan Indians part of their civilization part of their buildings to this day they have found out some of the foundations which answer exactly to the belt of Orion so people looked up and they sir knew and saw that there was something there now depending on of course how you look at this and you think oh my I don't understand this and about that well I understand very little about it but all I know is I see my father's handwriting also at all now what does it all mean I don't have a clue I do about how to spell every now and then oh what a little bit I do understand but the band's notice the bands are variety here like this you can see there again look at the stars in glory do all of them make up the image of the hunter they do not but picked out are certain ones that will tie together to make a constellation to tell a story that story has been read and reread and reread millions of times again and God Himself quoting this think of it can you bind can you bind all right what does Orion do Oh Ryan was cold binds up life Orion was cold binds up the streams Orion was cold numbs the hands of people and they can't work as they could under the influence of Pleiades you and I were living in a cold dark winter time of church age but God sent the rising of the Sun our eyes come open we'd all been sleeping up in the loft as it were we needed some grease home our eyes was all mannered together and somebody was looking up and trying to understand the Godhead you saw to some of the time and then you saw Sri and then you thought you saw one but you couldn't figure it out so you try to get that matter out of the eyes and you go down to your past your posture huh I'm really confused about the Godhead well to be honest with you I am too he needed some I saved as well so what did God do God sent the spring equinox upon the church and said it is the rising of the Sun [Applause] lose the bugs of winter time on your life sort of Ryan strengths it makes men come in you understand what she was feeling here a few weeks ago when it was seven degrees in four degrees in zero thank him for it Thank You Betty appreciate it you can't feel like you could you can't breathe like you could I know when I was out in that cold weather I couldn't even breathe right him I don't want to talking about you couldn't even breathe right this amazing when the temperature changed how much better you can breathe God takes conflict in constellations to show job in the same verse he takes the constellation of spring versus the constellation of winter in fest case you see this is part of who you are don't get me wrong I think you're incredible it's just your influence I don't like [Music] I understand why folks go to Florida on the south in Arizona especially the older I get I understand why folks don't like the cold weather yet coldest part of it now I'm not speaking just now naturally I'm speaking spiritually as well I understand why folks don't like valleys it's the hunter mr. hunter what's he doing better not move gene I've got you in my spot you better not move that one Otello I don't like to have been prancing my guardian and something I've been going to church I've been several services I ain't felt nothing I don't know what Malone's going on don't you understand it's the numbness of Orion strengths and stem bears oh my that's coming upon you and you're in the wintertime a struggle of your life I'd remember there will be another spring friends o globo the doggie I prayed that pray one was supposed to do keep right on praying appearing in the autumn you imagine now for sailors and them as they begin to watch the constellations of the skies as they changed and they saw Orion appearing in the autumn it was a bad omen the waves as always get worse the winds more tumultuous they knew with Orion's coming his bands oh they could stand there and say there will be another spring that's a beautiful song but I'm gonna tell you one thing sometimes and you're down on the valley hit don't do a lot for you Donnie Rambo wrote some pretty songs about being in the valley in the valley he restoreth my soul it's a wonderful Psalm to saying but sometimes in your low and it seemed like God don't even know your address or know where you are come on Saints sometimes we get to a spot we just need a little bit of inspiration from the Lord [Applause] can you go up to arrive and grab ahold of this bounce can you grab ahold of his sword and say I don't like you leave me testing one two now to suck at Orion from a heavenly perspective Orion consists of seven major stars - for his shoulders - for his feet three for his belt each star has a name astronomers measure distance in lightyears one light years the distance light travels in one year five point eight eight trillion miles to go one light year and the Space Shuttle would take you 40,000 years the distance from the earth to the stars in Orion's belt the nearest one is GJ 30 379 it is 17 light-years ninety-nine point nine six trillion miles so give up reaching to try to know the brightest star is racquel eight hundred light years away Miguel is sixty-six thousand times more powerful than our Sun a super blue giant 18 times more massive think of it the light you see from réguel some spring or winter night left réguel 250 years before Columbus ever found America so in the year 1200 and something whoever made these pictures that's when the light would have left raquel overwhelming right are y'all overwhelmed everybody overwhelmed the constellation mainly consists of bright blue supergiant stars the most notable exception being the red supergiant Betelgeuse which lies in Orion's shoulder now once you look at the relativity and sighs this is Betelgeuse what a name for such a critter Betelgeuse look at the size Rogell the Sun look at your son now it's a dot can you imagine what we are brother Frank in comparison to the earth and then hone it down to you you're not even the size of a piece of lint carpet fuzz is a giant compared to oh why didn't he pick retail to be home why not Betelgeuse to be home bigger brighter but you see it's a supergiant you take a plant within so many miles of Betelgeuse even fry it in a matter of seconds so the Earth's don't have the fire it don't have the mass but it has the ability to have life oh darling if these things you're saying another man's messages right well I didn't go out do some great renowned picture why you some little insignificant speck of Kentucky dust he likes to use insignificant specks of dust Betelgeuse is also the largest star in the constellation it has 1,000 times the radius of the Sun sometimes the radius the three stars which form a line through the middle of the constellation are known as Orion's belt if you follow imaginary line down through Orion's belt it will take you to the brightest star in the night sky Sirius follow the line up in the southern hemisphere and you'll find it you imagine this job a joke think of it you are one of the people that's privileged to live in this age Abraham Adam Isaac Jacob Joseph Moses David Solomon Jeremiah Ezekiel and an eye I got none of them ever got to see a picture like this only in this age of enlightenment could people be able to see such a thing they come blessed we are Harry just to be able to see this naturally well what about supernaturally what about supernatural a brother/sister where they miss when God has opened our eyes to let us see the opening of the seven seals and the revealing of his word way in the age of the stars let me close show 38:32 can sell bring forth mazzaroth in his season him sell guy doctorís with this mazzaroth of course is the constellations Arcturus is the bear guard of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor here again God is overwhelming his servant because he needs to be unloaded friends no matter how much you love the Lord there's something left in us that still wants to question God God why this God why that how come meet God how come my husband's going through this why's my wife how come you took my wife why I got cancer I've been a Christian all this time why Lord why may God help us today tell me about our heads praise the Lord Oh Heavenly Father I know when we walk out of this place today the majority of these numbers the majority of these things that have said to them and trying to relate to them the greatness of what you've made they can't remember it they'll not recall it but hopefully they'll get the significance of it Lord and that is to proof you who hung all of this hung the moon and the stars by your word hallelujah you know our names today father what we're going through might be so tremendous to us and you do not belittle that you and your gracious mercy understand since you come to the earth as a human how it is to feel frustration and worry and trouble thank you for that Lord Lord Jesus you want to encourage us maybe there's some here today father and they're in the going through a winter cycle spiritually they're very familiar with the snowflakes that we reflected the other night the very very familiar was the hoarfrost that was showed last night in the eyes it feels like their water of life has dried up and froze over they feel so cold they prayed they get nothing they listened to tapes it seems like they get nothing they come to church and it seems like they get nothing and they're just discouraged and disheartened and it seems like everything's froze up I pray you'd strengthen them today Lord Lord Jesus may your presence encourage them Lord we know this cycle has been ongoing now for thousands of years I'm always glad when we hit January in February because I know the leaves have fallen mountains are in that ugly stage we've got a spring to look forward to I can't say wintertime is my favorite time of the year Lord I love spring summer and fall and yet there's a sadness to me about fall and we see the leaves falling turning colors we know that the harshness of winter is right on its trail we look up in the night sky and who do we see the great hunter he starts reflecting his bands of influence upon our little blue dot the nights start getting chilly and then then cold and then real cold we have to start wrapping water lines and blowing plants and that will freeze the Lord we know winter time will not always be upon the earth spring will come back around Lord Jesus may you encourage your people today not only those your present are those that are here this surface may the Spirit of God strike them Lord we know even in Canada parts of Alaska there's so much darkness in the wintertime even parts of Norway and Denmark that the people buy special light bulbs and change out in their house because they eliminate rather rays of light that help relieve people of depression because so much darkness Oh Lord Jesus we look around and we see the darkness around us Lord it's in the churches it's in the world it's in politics everywhere we look it's around us you didn't give us a light bulb but you sent us a star praise God and that star illuminated our paths thank you Lord Jesus and it helped drive away part of the depression in the darkness of layer to see of living in this age we have senior star in the West and we have come to worship not the star but you because that star never led us to himself he pointed us to you Jesus Christ the Son of God Oh Lord Jesus may your bright rays enter into these hearts and lives today blessed Lamb of God as we close the service out last night here this Sun beautiful bright ball of fire and yet the greater serves the lesser we do not serve the Sun we give nothing to the Sun no color no water no ambience we give nothing and yet we could not survive without the Sun so the greater serve the lesser Lord God we think of you coming to the earth it was the greater that come to redeem the lesser but you picked us up and redeemed us and in so much that Paul said in Hebrews that you are not ashamed to call us brothers to call us brothers praise God a little speck of dust whirling out in eternity and yet the Spirit of God called us to yourself we're thank you Lord I may not to remember before the Lord today just raise your hand would you you believe Jesus is in this place I believe it's passion Byron among us I don't know those of you know president I know there's still several that's sake and keep me here today I mean he's still fighting off this flu and various things may you there in your home wherever you are may you be able to reach out to the Lord Jesus as well may the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings in the name of Jesus I rebuke this flu that's tried to affect our people I rebuke these viruses coughs mucus congestion and I say to you you are defeated not by the power of this little blue dot but by the power of the risen son you are defeated sickness you are defeated that would try to plague the people of God let God's children go since take your hands off of God's property let them go in the name of Jesus Christ praise be to God let's stand together little pale dots of dust praise the Lord praise the Lord let's show that one picture again brother Daniel is a little blue pail dot thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord what is it to us France God's mercy and His grace sighs look at us what have we done what have you done for God what's my ministry done for God in comparison to a lot of denominational preachers once our church done for God as far as the way they would look at it nothing what if you done for God in compared to a lot of these people winning souls to Christ as they say really when we get there I wonder how many they will have really want and yet you're you profess to be this blue dot in the universe you claim to have life understanding the Holy Ghost is all knife in you I'm glad God swirled around his camera before the foundation of the world and took your picture the Prophet said he took your picture when you were your best not when you were 18 or when you was 20 but before the foundation we have to wait till our children are born to make our family album by the way but he made his family album before the foundation of the world can we just worship Him a little bit before we go he knows my name s for every step that I take just every move that I make

believe we've been allowed to soar in heavenly places not just so much the heavenlies of the stars but have only places of your word or God it breaks my heart in one sense when I think about all those stars and those ordinances that you place there they've never cost you any problem they've never rebelled against you they've never been stubborn in order to think of me and I think of my brothers and sisters were the ones who scholars you such pain were the ones who's been rebellious Lord forgive us father we're so grateful that not only can you make the Stars and hang them in their place but you wanted to understand us so much you come to the earth and took not on the form of angels but the form of a servant you felt discouraged disheartened no doubt you must have had situations that would arise to where humanly it would it would have allowed you to feel a pain of a grudge or feel the pain of a resentment of something someone said brother brems said you even got embarrassed by some of the things that people said about you that day that you got embarrassed so you allowed yourself to feel embarrassment for the word you allowed yourself to feel Lord as we would feel thank you what good would it do us if he was just a star maker a universe maker you could span all the universe with all these things but you couldn't forgive us as your children maybe and walk out of this building
