[31:04] [Music]
[31:20] [Music]
[31:32] if I did
[31:35] [Music]
[31:40] [Applause]
[31:54] and what we've been hearing of late and
[31:57] I'm gonna have to say for myself being
[32:01] where I've been for the past eight or
[32:03] nine years y'all y'all don't understand
[32:06] where I've been I'm gonna be honest with
[32:07] you but when I hear this word going
[32:10] forth the way it's been lately I'm about
[32:12] to get bust outta here I'm about to get
[32:14] out of here I'm becoming more violent
[32:19] if you thought I was bad then look out
[32:22] I'm ready to get out of here Church it's
[32:25] time to stop playing and this song Edwin
[32:28] and Walter Hawkins wrote this song many
[32:30] many years ago and I'm amazed at the
[32:32] inspiration that comes on people's lives
[32:33] to write songs and and the thing that
[32:35] gets me is is that it'll stir you you
[32:38] connect with it but it's good to know
[32:40] that you have the revit early revelation
[32:42] when that when that inspiration strikes
[32:44] you on a song that a denominational
[32:47] person has written that you can catch
[32:49] the real inspiration and the real
[32:52] meaning of what God was warning he's
[32:54] bringing forth that light to the word to
[32:56] the world and they're catching it they
[32:59] they're they but they don't quite
[33:00] understand it but when we get ahold of
[33:02] it we can truly truly know what God was
[33:05] wanting to convey and in return we can
[33:08] get back to him what he was originally
[33:10] wanting anyway so when you sing this
[33:12] song tonight
[33:13] don't be so much singing it to be
[33:14] singing it because brother Louie wants
[33:16] me to sing it sing it because you mean
[33:18] it because I know you know it but do you
[33:21] know it because you got to know it
[33:24] before you know it for when the knowing
[33:26] does come it can connect with that
[33:29] original knowing is that Alright if you
[33:32] wanna know
[33:36] well I'm going
[33:40] where I'm going
[33:44] you know one day soon if you wanna know
[33:54] whether I'm going
[33:59] I'm going
[34:02] it won't be much longer whoa I'm going
[34:09] up to yonder y'all believe it I'm going
[34:14] up the yonder

[37:49] well that good Wednesday night oh my the
[37:52] Word of God is always good I told Carol
[37:59] I said you know you look at that
[38:01] parallel of that how that God wants us
[38:04] so passion and so on fire for him you
[38:07] look at many of the Reformation 's what
[38:09] happened when Luther begin to preach to
[38:11] them the truth of justification he was
[38:13] setting there and he said he locked up
[38:14] in the castle because they were seeking
[38:16] for his life to kill him he wrote many
[38:19] many many books many tracks and what he
[38:22] was setting there reading the book of
[38:24] Romans the revelation hit him the just
[38:27] shall live by faith he grabbed his head
[38:29] looking at it looking at it trying to
[38:32] understand the Greek the Latin looking
[38:33] back and forth back and forth and it hit
[38:35] him Christ alone Christ alone when the
[38:42] common people began to hear it I mean
[38:44] they broke out and revival started
[38:47] acting violent but then look what Satan
[38:50] done then many of them actually turned
[38:54] violent
[38:55] they started destroying churches right
[39:00] so what did Satan knew Satan flipped
[39:02] that revival right around and done
[39:05] exactly what he wanted to do was
[39:07] identify that move with a bunch of
[39:09] fanaticism when John Knox many of you
[39:11] know the founder of the Presbyterian
[39:13] Church when he began to see
[39:14] predestination and election many many
[39:16] many hundreds of years ago and whenever
[39:19] what did it happen exactly the same
[39:21] thing many then people started getting
[39:23] violent for the kingdom of God not
[39:25] fighting now and all that sort of thing
[39:27] but it wasn't no time within
[39:29] couple of years that the followers of
[39:31] that Reformation began to also turn
[39:34] violent then they burn churches they've
[39:37] done this and that in the other what
[39:39] Satan wants to do he wants to taint that
[39:41] image of that so when people go to get
[39:44] an emotional clapping and shout and
[39:45] praise God Satan wants to get your mind
[39:48] over to the other side oh boy here we go
[39:52] you're gonna let that old scarecrow
[39:54] scare you I thought you all was Eagles
[39:59] here
[39:59] [Applause]
[40:01] scarecrow shouldn't scare you a man
[40:08] praise the Lord
[40:10] well it's good to be back in the house
[40:11] of the Lord let's turn to the Song of
[40:14] Solomon tonight chapter 5 verse 1 I am
[40:25] coming to my garden my sister my spouse
[40:29] I've gathered my myrrh with my spice

[40:50] I sleep but my heart waketh it is the
[40:58] voice of my beloved that knocketh saying
[41:03] open to me my sister my love my dove my
[41:09] undefiled from my head is filled with
[41:14] Dew how can this be we go from the
[41:21] entrance into the garden to this this is
[41:30] one of most speak to yawn tonight what
[41:33] happened
[41:36] open to me my sister my love my dove my
[41:40] undefiled for my head is filled with Dew
[41:44] and my locks with the drops of the night
[41:50] her response I have put off my coat how
[41:56] shall I put it on I have washed my feet
[42:01] how shall i defile them oh ma let's pray
[42:10] together Lord Jesus thank you for your
[42:15] great presence that we sent sure tonight
[42:17] Lord we asked your God that you would
[42:22] take your word and speak to his father
[42:26] we know in the parallel the age that we
[42:28] live in in the presence of Christ
[42:31] Himself the fullness of the attribute
[42:34] that is returned to the earth for that
[42:36] we are so grateful yet we also know in
[42:41] this age of coldness lukewarmness of
[42:44] Laodicea we must fight it set ourselves
[42:49] against it that we may be engulfed in
[42:54] your presence Lord I pray that you'd
[42:57] take these examples in your word tonight
[43:00] and speak to us blessed father
[43:04] Forte's in the name of the Lord Jesus we
[43:07] ask these favors amen god bless you you
[43:12] may be seated
[43:22] I've said many times in my office or in
[43:28] other places that I would meet with
[43:33] married couples and watch them and watch
[43:40] their body language toward each other
[43:44] and maybe it was a couple that I had
[43:48] married five years ten years 20 years
[43:52] prior to that and remembering and
[43:57] reminiscing how they would look at one
[44:00] another and how they would hold one
[44:02] another's hands and they would look at
[44:05] each other's eyes and the emotion that
[44:11] they both expelled to the other and me
[44:16] watching them and now as I would set and
[44:20] watch them and I would see the same man
[44:24] the same woman a few years older maybe
[44:27] gray hairs you know coming in around the
[44:30] forehead a few children their job
[44:35] changed a few times since then but what
[44:39] is the most overwhelming part to me it's
[44:43] not so much their hair changing him and
[44:47] her boasts maybe getting a few wrinkles
[44:48] in their face and aides kind of creeping
[44:52] up on them maybe they were in their
[44:54] teens or early 20s when I married them
[44:56] and now maybe the 30 35 40 whatever more
[45:00] but what always strikes me is how I
[45:05] watch them as they look at each other
[45:08] now and the way that they are expressing
[45:14] themselves is their body language and
[45:18] they're having stress in their marriage
[45:21] they're having strains or having
[45:23] difficulties maybe it's financially
[45:26] maybe it's because of the job
[45:29] could be doctrinal things it can be
[45:32] various things it always is so
[45:35] heartbreaking to me because as I sit
[45:39] there thinking of what used to be there
[45:42] between them and now what has come
[45:45] between them and I think in my mind what
[45:50] the Word of God declares and what God
[45:52] wants marriage to be and then I'll see
[45:55] what somehow another their marriage has
[45:58] become to where that is fussing and
[46:02] fighting and arguing and debating and
[46:05] they are sitting there looking at one
[46:08] another no longer with love in their
[46:10] eyes but contempt and some I could
[46:14] venture to say I've seen them look at
[46:18] their husband or their wife was so much
[46:21] anger and so much hatred in their eyes
[46:25] and they would look at one another and
[46:28] to be honest with you as I would sit
[46:31] there and look at that I would fear
[46:33] somewhat not so much for myself because
[46:36] so far they're not mad at me they
[46:39] probably will be before I'm done with
[46:40] them but anyway they're sitting there
[46:43] looking at each other with this in their
[46:46] hearts and in their in their very being
[46:49] and their spirit reflecting through
[46:52] their eyes and their body language and I
[46:56] watch them as they'll fling their arms
[46:59] or wrinkle their face or you know this
[47:02] come over their expression and they
[47:04] don't know what I'm done now I've given
[47:06] away a trade secret haven't but sitting
[47:09] there watching them many times I don't
[47:11] have to say are they anything at all
[47:13] because I can see that by watching both
[47:17] of them not many times I've count so
[47:20] marriage people and their own shirts in
[47:22] different parts of the world and I could
[47:24] see right off that it was pretty much a
[47:26] one-sided situation either the husband
[47:30] was to blame or the wife was to blame
[47:33] but more times than not I've seen that
[47:35] there was Fault on both sides now that's
[47:39] why I always get in trouble because the
[47:42] husband
[47:43] always wants me to take sides totally
[47:47] with him and blame the wife and most of
[47:51] the women always want me to take sides
[47:54] with them and totally blame the husband
[47:59] but you see I am a god called man so
[48:04] therefore I know no matter how thin you
[48:07] slice a piece of bread it has two sides
[48:11] and that's why I generally make both
[48:15] sides mad at me and I'm the one that's
[48:19] supposed to be the one to help them but
[48:22] I can't help them unless they both
[48:24] realize I love them both and I'm
[48:27] standing between them to try to help
[48:30] them both see they both got faults well
[48:35] I see this is going to be an aim endless
[48:37] service but that's alright I'm going to
[48:42] preach it anyhow that's right now what
[48:47] I've read to you tonight let me just set
[48:50] it forth to you right right up front
[48:52] this is the setting of this is
[48:55] definitely a one-sided story because the
[49:00] one that we are reflecting as far as the
[49:03] the bridegroom of course is the Lord
[49:05] Jesus and in him there is no fault now
[49:10] no matter how good as men aren't how
[49:13] fill with the Holy Ghost we are there's
[49:15] not a man here tonight or one under the
[49:18] sound of my voice or one that will ever
[49:21] hear this sermon if I live and or die
[49:24] read and I'm begging and this sermon
[49:26] would be played for 250 years or 2,000
[49:30] years I traum there there'll never be a
[49:32] man that will ever listen to it that
[49:34] will honestly ever be able to stand up
[49:37] and say I am without fault and if you
[49:40] dare do that in this service I'll grab a
[49:43] hold to you and throw you on the ground
[49:45] and cast that devil out of you
[49:47] I do not have to do like the preacher
[49:51] did I might after beat on you a little
[49:53] bit at the same time because whether
[49:56] you're a man or a woman whether you're
[49:58] 20 or 95 every one of us have faults and
[50:02] God can't help any of us til we
[50:05] recognize we have faults and have
[50:08] problems you see as long as you're
[50:10] blaming her for everything or blaming
[50:13] the church for ever saying or blaming
[50:15] the pastor forever saying God can never
[50:18] even deal with you because you're not
[50:20] willing to see where the main problem
[50:22] lays and that's within yourself now but
[50:26] in this situation Christ is totally
[50:29] faultless can y'all say amen to that
[50:31] Christ is totally faultless nothing
[50:34] about this setting is his fault at all
[50:37] he has and always will and always does
[50:40] everything perfect I cannot say that
[50:43] I've not always been the perfect husband
[50:46] I did selfish sometimes
[50:48] I want things my way now I can take this
[50:52] kind of preaching tonight because I'm a
[50:54] Christian I'm filled with the Holy Ghost
[50:56] so I'm not going to do like some of you
[50:59] baby 5 men here tonight that when I get
[51:01] on your Hajj you're going to get quiet
[51:03] on me and then when I get on your wife
[51:05] you're going to scream don't you
[51:07] understand what you're doing you're
[51:09] making an idiot out of yourself in front
[51:11] of the rest of us because you Amen what
[51:14] part you want to and then you dry up on
[51:17] the rest of us a Christian can Amen the
[51:23] word even if that tells the hide off of
[51:26] you
[51:26] a hypocrite setzer and amens what they
[51:30] won't amen praise the Lord but the Lord
[51:37] Jesus is never at fault ah me and Carol
[51:41] have been made as many of you know for a
[51:43] long long time and we've had a wonderful
[51:45] marriage I thank God for a marriage but
[51:48] yet we've not had a marriage to where
[51:50] that she and I did not agree or disagree
[51:53] about things we agree most of the time
[51:55] much more than we disagree and
[51:58] we've learned how to be able to settle
[52:00] our differences and that is if
[52:02] differences come between us that we pray
[52:05] and we come together and we talk and you
[52:07] know if we're both a little bit ill and
[52:09] we're just a little bit strong how from
[52:12] pressure and then I'm a preacher I don't
[52:14] know I'd have any pressure in the age
[52:15] that we're live but every now and then
[52:17] I'll do so it comes from somewhere maybe
[52:20] something y'all text it to me or email
[52:22] or something but anyway I fall under a
[52:25] little bit of pressure so if we get the
[52:27] world that we cannot talk we have
[52:29] learned that we go she goes to one room
[52:31] and I go to the other and we pray and
[52:34] then we come back and try it again and
[52:36] if it don't work then we go back to the
[52:39] other room and we pray and then we and
[52:41] eventually we will sort it out but it
[52:46] takes both of us to be able to say she
[52:48] has to say Donnie I was wrong because I
[52:51] cannot be able to confess her wrong and
[52:54] fix the situation now if I have done
[52:57] something wrong I need to own up to it
[52:59] and make it right if she's done
[53:01] something wrong she needs to own up to
[53:03] it and make it right though Lord Jesus
[53:06] has never had to ask me to forgive him
[53:10] for anything because he's never done
[53:12] anything wrong to me praise the Lord I
[53:16] realize that there are people on the
[53:18] earth today the second guess God and
[53:20] they fill out they know more about how
[53:22] to run a church run a home run a house
[53:25] and God does they know more about
[53:27] salvation they know more about the
[53:29] church I've made a few of those people
[53:31] I'm scared of them close to me they're
[53:33] insane anybody that would think they
[53:36] know more about how to run a church and
[53:38] a human life and God does you better get
[53:40] away from them
[53:41] they're out of their mind that's right
[53:44] because he's the only one that really
[53:46] knows how to do anything right as a
[53:48] matter of fact that's the only thing
[53:49] he's ever done well way back since
[53:51] eternity but in this situation it is the
[53:55] groom that is totally innocent he's
[53:57] totally without fault the groom has not
[53:59] been innocent or let me say it this way
[54:02] the groom has
[54:03] I've been in this scenario Tory's been
[54:06] selfish and he's needed to come back and
[54:08] apologize and ascending on the outside
[54:10] of the door are trying to knock and get
[54:12] back in and please sweetheart I'm sorry
[54:14] you don't find in this setting here
[54:16] where Jesus it's actually apologizing
[54:19] because he hasn't done anything wrong
[54:21] he's not standing here and saying please
[54:24] forgive me please forgive me I should
[54:26] have never raised my voice I should have
[54:28] been more considerate I should have
[54:31] thought about your point of view and I
[54:33] should have listened here when we
[54:35] discussed this before uh well you know I
[54:37] forgive me for doing that he does not do
[54:39] that at all
[54:40] because it's what in the world as a
[54:42] matter with you all say out say Amen and
[54:46] let me know you're alive that you're not
[54:48] a bunch of mummies sitting there like
[54:50] this I believe some of y'all got the
[54:52] mummy you know the mummy button and you
[54:54] just said it and you just rocking back
[54:56] and thought not able to work with me
[54:58] mummy wake up mommy now you know the
[55:02] bride we know is faulty and the bride is
[55:04] flawed of the bride certainly has her
[55:07] faults and every real true woman that is
[55:09] a Christian fill of the Holy Ghost I
[55:11] don't think there's a true woman here
[55:13] tonight that would not admit that she's
[55:15] faulty as well is that right sisters and
[55:18] your sisters raise your hand dear God
[55:22] we've got I didn't realize we had that
[55:24] many angels sure did not it look like
[55:25] people that come to this
[55:27] oh I'm I am so sorry I didn't know
[55:34] angels wore glasses
[55:36] I didn't know angels had problems I mean
[55:39] angel is great gray hair oh my goodness
[55:45] I'm gonna have to rethink this shirt
[55:46] tonight then huh I might need to go back
[55:48] in the studying and redo these notes and
[55:52] do we have any men here tonight would
[55:54] admit that they are faulty and flawed
[55:57] and mistakes if you put that brothers so
[56:01] I can see which one's an angel there's
[56:03] an angel there's one now I find that
[56:06] amazing that there's not near as many
[56:08] men angel says there are women angels in
[56:11] this place wow that is really something
[56:14] but you know since we know how we are
[56:17] human beings and we see that we are
[56:20] faulty and flawed this is the way by
[56:22] which God can be able to get to us
[56:24] because whenever we see the word and we
[56:27] see that we are wrong then we are
[56:29] willing to admit we are wrong as a
[56:31] matter of fact a person with the Holy
[56:33] Ghost will actually step over the
[56:36] required line in the middle in order to
[56:39] try to fix the situation because they
[56:41] are peace lovers and peacemakers now
[56:45] somebody that's not even willing to
[56:47] admit their own part much less step over
[56:50] the fifty-fifty line more than likely
[56:52] they're not born again in the first
[56:54] place they're just saying they're a
[56:56] Christian they come to church and they
[56:57] brag on the preaching this and that and
[56:59] the other but if the Holy Ghost is in
[57:01] you he is a peacemaker if the Holy Ghost
[57:05] is in you
[57:06] he is a dev well praise the Lord he
[57:10] loves peace he cannot stand arguing and
[57:13] fussing he cannot stand debating come on
[57:16] children don't get wife that's right
[57:18] brother brems said God doesn't fuss and
[57:21] neither do his children so you wonder
[57:24] what that makes people that fuss all the
[57:26] time well praise the Lord but we're
[57:30] having a good time tonight a way hey man
[57:32] this is really good thank the Lord
[57:34] now I want you to notice this now that
[57:37] we go from from verse 1 into this verse
[57:40] 2 now you know the way that the song
[57:42] Solomon is written this is actually
[57:45] called canticles or the Hebrew words
[57:47] that identify that canticles it's also
[57:50] called the song of songs which I'd like
[57:52] to take that out in a minute if the Lord
[57:54] will help me before we finish this on
[57:56] being the song of songs but we don't
[57:58] know how much of a time increment is
[58:01] between verse 1 and verse 2 now in verse
[58:05] 1 we see the great consummation of the
[58:07] marriage how that they've my they've
[58:09] been through this dating and all this
[58:11] it's been ongoing now for maybe months
[58:13] or maybe even longer than that the
[58:15] Hebrew customers at least a year to make
[58:18] sure that the woman was not with child
[58:19] so at the same thing in the scripture
[58:22] that the Bible condenses his truth so
[58:24] even though verse 1 verse 2 verse 3
[58:26] verse 4 there can be months in between
[58:29] one verse or there can be even months or
[58:31] years in between one word and another as
[58:33] Isaiah 6th you want so we don't know
[58:36] exactly how long it was in between verse
[58:38] 1 and verse 2 but we know that verse one
[58:41] was the consummation that all oh it was
[58:43] wonderful he had come into his garden he
[58:46] went back out of his garden actually
[58:48] retrieving the verge of the tokens of
[58:50] virginity and he told his friends to
[58:53] rejoice and eat because his bride was
[58:56] truly a virgin now as he comes back in
[58:59] verse two was it the same night was it a
[59:02] week later was it forty days later
[59:04] depending on our rich they were the
[59:07] marriage feast and the marriage
[59:08] celebration would go from three days to
[59:10] seven to ten some would go thirty so
[59:12] it's really hard to say as far as time
[59:14] wise but what we see happening now in
[59:17] verse two is that the bridegroom had
[59:19] gone out and it maybe it got late in the
[59:22] night and something had come about but
[59:25] we see a slack or a are you backing all
[59:28] from the fervency
[59:29] in the fault of the bride now again it
[59:32] is not the bridegroom that is at fault
[59:34] but it is totally and completely the
[59:36] bride now this this coldness this
[59:39] complacency this dilatory attitude that
[59:43] was just now got into it does not change
[59:45] who she is
[59:47] but what it does change is her behavior
[59:50] in the way that she is not relating to
[59:53] her husband now keep in mind what I said
[59:54] when I started this out that as I've
[59:57] seen it with men and women husbands and
[59:59] wives that they will look at one another
[1:00:01] and treat one another different and act
[1:00:03] different in my at one time they so
[1:00:06] loved one another and they they wanted
[1:00:08] to spend their life with this man or
[1:00:10] this woman more than anybody else and
[1:00:11] now they don't care if they even like
[1:00:13] him or not as a matter of fact they wish
[1:00:15] they'd get away from them because they
[1:00:17] ain't got no peace in their home so
[1:00:19] they're just ready to do whatever they
[1:00:20] got to do to get away from what's just a
[1:00:22] sad scenario now in this now we can see
[1:00:25] the reciprocating part of this in the
[1:00:27] bride that something has now come over
[1:00:30] the bride in the song song you know
[1:00:33] breaks my heart to have to bring this
[1:00:35] but it is truth and reality because the
[1:00:38] converted part of us always stays in the
[1:00:41] divine fellowship of God but the
[1:00:43] unconverted part the human part the
[1:00:45] human element is that which we all
[1:00:48] battle is that which we all war against
[1:00:51] and by the grace of God we're going to
[1:00:53] overcome it because we're doing it now
[1:00:56] we're not just waiting out to hide
[1:00:57] overcome I'm living an overcoming life
[1:01:00] right now every day of my life now
[1:01:03] notice this this read verse two again I
[1:01:05] sleep but my heart waked not once you
[1:01:09] notice that the bride has not entered
[1:01:11] into a the deepest sleep by which her
[1:01:14] subconscious is totally taken over now
[1:01:17] we know God made a phenomenal thing when
[1:01:19] he made the human body and he knew that
[1:01:21] so much of the motors and the things
[1:01:23] about the body would have to be
[1:01:24] committed to the subconscious do you
[1:01:26] ever worry when you lay down at night
[1:01:28] about who's gonna make your body breathe
[1:01:31] or who's going to keep your heart rate
[1:01:32] and your blood pressure fluctuating all
[1:01:34] because God committed much of the
[1:01:37] Motorworks of your brain and all the
[1:01:39] things inside of your body to the
[1:01:41] subconscious so when you go out of the
[1:01:43] first conscience and you enter in into
[1:01:45] the sleep faces and four different
[1:01:46] phases of sleep by which you go from the
[1:01:48] light on down into the deeper channels
[1:01:50] of sleep and once you're entered into
[1:01:52] that it takes something to wake you up
[1:01:54] but what does God do God committed so
[1:01:57] much of the operation of the body that
[1:01:59] does not depend upon the conscience
[1:02:01] level so you don't have to set up all
[1:02:03] night and make sure that you're
[1:02:05] breathing correctly you don't have to
[1:02:07] set up all night to make sure that your
[1:02:09] heart's okay and your kidneys is okay
[1:02:11] yeah you know everything else is alright
[1:02:12] why because God committed much of that
[1:02:15] to the subconscious what a wonderful
[1:02:18] father
[1:02:18] so one your they are sleep and you're
[1:02:21] enjoying your sleep and resting then
[1:02:23] your body is now moved over once it
[1:02:25] enters into the life stage of sleep into
[1:02:27] the deepest part of the sleep stage then
[1:02:29] your body your heart rate slows and your
[1:02:31] blood pressure doing all these things
[1:02:32] but it's operating exactly as it's
[1:02:35] supposed to while you're in this sleep
[1:02:38] chamber while you moved into that now
[1:02:40] how did it not been that way than you
[1:02:42] and I have never been able to go out
[1:02:43] sleep
[1:02:44] or we've been worried about it all not
[1:02:45] long but you know what most of you
[1:02:47] probably never even thought about that
[1:02:48] in your life till now you know why
[1:02:50] because it's committed to the
[1:02:52] sub-conscience and you don't even worry
[1:02:54] about it
[1:02:54] so not the bride here in this state it
[1:02:58] is not that she's entered into the
[1:03:00] deepest part of sleep many of you that
[1:03:02] have problems with sleeping you've read
[1:03:03] on and said it on it and you know there
[1:03:05] can be a lack of melatonin and serotonin
[1:03:06] it can be all kinds of different things
[1:03:08] that causes if they make us sleep
[1:03:10] machines that produce and work on the
[1:03:12] bed it beta waves of your brain and work
[1:03:14] on the different phases of your brain
[1:03:16] that will come in with those sound
[1:03:17] machines and help you to be able to
[1:03:18] sleep deeper and deeper and deeper but
[1:03:20] yet God whenever he made us he made a
[1:03:23] perfect thing when he made a human being
[1:03:24] and then whatever the bride now she's
[1:03:27] not actually so deep into that that once
[1:03:30] she hears his voice that she's not
[1:03:32] sorted in and out and most of us have
[1:03:35] been there to worry that we're going to
[1:03:37] sleep when we're trying to go to sleep
[1:03:38] and we're starting enter into it make
[1:03:40] Harold talk many times we go home after
[1:03:42] the service and and at night we lay
[1:03:44] there and talk about the word and talk
[1:03:45] about so many things and maybe she'll
[1:03:48] start to enter into it a little bit
[1:03:49] before I do and I'll say something and
[1:03:51] then she doesn't respond well I know
[1:03:53] that she's already entering in deeper
[1:03:56] than I am or shoot her the same thing to
[1:03:57] me and it's the same way to where we see
[1:04:00] the bride that she says I sleep but my
[1:04:03] heart wake us it is the voice of my
[1:04:05] beloved so she's entering into
[1:04:08] into the state of sleep but it is not
[1:04:11] the sleep of spiritual death it is not
[1:04:14] that she can no longer hear the voice of
[1:04:17] the bridegroom but it's sort of like
[1:04:18] she's halfway asleep and a half way late
[1:04:21] now she's going from the conscious level
[1:04:23] into the subconscious and when we do
[1:04:25] something naturally happens to us
[1:04:28] because we cannot be alert and both
[1:04:30] consciences in the full effect at the
[1:04:32] same time so we have to let go and let
[1:04:34] go I'm not going we turn and turn you
[1:04:37] know how they are we make our nests and
[1:04:39] we can't get comfortable and we do this
[1:04:41] and we put the pillow this way in that
[1:04:43] way and I don't know one that isn't my
[1:04:46] goodness all of you that just lay down
[1:04:48] and go to sleep in two minutes what do
[1:04:50] you take Oh hallelujah what a blessed
[1:04:53] person you are I turn from the left side
[1:04:55] to the right side on my back I gotta
[1:04:57] move my leg this way move it that way to
[1:04:59] get my arm right I get my leg right and
[1:05:01] then my arm and then I move my arm and I
[1:05:03] move this and you know it's just back
[1:05:05] and forth so whatever I'm still in the
[1:05:07] conscience level and I'm impatient for
[1:05:10] the subconscious to take over and take
[1:05:13] me out because I'm tired I need to rest
[1:05:15] but I'm not worried that the bride is in
[1:05:18] that sense spiritually because I'm still
[1:05:21] very much conscious so if I hear
[1:05:22] something a car goes up and down the
[1:05:24] road or the neighbor over there shuts
[1:05:25] his car door then then I hear all that
[1:05:27] but the bride has actually moved beyond
[1:05:30] this level a little bit to where she's
[1:05:32] going deeper and deeper to where the
[1:05:35] subconscious is now taking over so she
[1:05:37] says I sleep but my heart waked notice
[1:05:40] now as she separates herself from her
[1:05:43] heart she's conscience enough to know
[1:05:46] that there is OMA there is two people of
[1:05:50] her and one of them is already
[1:05:52] struggling it is already entering into
[1:05:55] this dubious type of state of
[1:05:58] complacency but the other part was she
[1:06:01] identifies as her heart I sleep but my
[1:06:05] hard way cos my heart is hearing his
[1:06:08] voice but I'm sleeping
[1:06:11] ahoo I have a body that's who that's the
[1:06:16] same person that you are as well
[1:06:18] now notice she said I sleep but my heart
[1:06:22] waker so she's Highfill wakers will say
[1:06:24] and half asleep so Christ and the church
[1:06:27] have feasted they have enjoyed one
[1:06:29] another's presence they have been my
[1:06:31] together they spent all this time
[1:06:33] together and then he goes out as I said
[1:06:36] well there was the same night or this if
[1:06:38] then happened a few weeks later I to
[1:06:40] their marriage or a few months or maybe
[1:06:41] even a few years but something had
[1:06:44] already begin to move inside of the
[1:06:47] heart will say the new begin to wear off
[1:06:51] you know there is a commonality about
[1:06:55] monogamy even in the natural marriage
[1:06:58] state and this is why that many people
[1:07:01] like to have affairs so their life
[1:07:05] becomes old and you know they become
[1:07:07] common on another and they don't love
[1:07:10] one another that much anymore so then
[1:07:12] somebody at work will catch their eye
[1:07:14] don't y'all sit and look at me like you
[1:07:16] know what I'm talking about somebody at
[1:07:18] work or somebody at school or something
[1:07:21] like that
[1:07:21] well catch their eye and maybe they're
[1:07:23] not quite as much in love with her
[1:07:26] husband or wife as they were years ago
[1:07:28] so this person MA brings a little spark
[1:07:32] back into their life it's the same way
[1:07:35] spiritually that people come to the
[1:07:38] house of God the spark as well the
[1:07:40] violence of their passion the violence
[1:07:43] of their prayer life so they just kind
[1:07:46] of settle down and they go to church and
[1:07:48] they clap their hands or mother Lewis
[1:07:50] says everybody clap your hands and they
[1:07:52] clap their hands but there's no passion
[1:07:54] there's no real burning inside of them
[1:07:57] they are going through a ritual and
[1:07:59] emotion that's all and they are in a
[1:08:02] form people st. a forum it's just like
[1:08:04] this there are forms that move you ever
[1:08:13] see a curved driveway poured out of
[1:08:15] concrete
[1:08:16] now if the arable thing in that form was
[1:08:19] straight and nothing was mobile you'll
[1:08:22] never get a curve in a driveway
[1:08:24] but guess what you got you got hinges so
[1:08:27] you got a form but that form moves some
[1:08:31] people get in the form like this or like
[1:08:35] this
[1:08:38] Sylla form what they're doing it without
[1:08:44] heart they're doing about that
[1:08:46] attachment to the Lord Jesus a man can
[1:08:49] kiss his wife come out seeing the same
[1:08:50] thing okay say the same but 20 years ago
[1:08:53] my goodness he'd grab him and
[1:09:02] another one that's why folks you should
[1:09:07] be about God oh I can't wait to get to
[1:09:09] church oh I can't wait to get alone with
[1:09:11] God I can't wait to listen to another
[1:09:13] tape praise the Lord she now finds
[1:09:22] herself in this state to where that
[1:09:25] she's struggling was sleep notice she's
[1:09:29] a a answering to the parallel of the
[1:09:32] disciples and that's in 26 verse 40 he
[1:09:35] cometh unto the disciples and find us in
[1:09:38] asleep and saith unto Peter what could
[1:09:42] you not watch with me one hour
[1:09:45] Watson pray that ye enter not into
[1:09:48] temptation the spirit indeed is willing
[1:09:52] but uh can you say Amen about that being
[1:10:02] yours
[1:10:04] bought Peters flesh no no no don't leave
[1:10:07] it in Peters lap put it in yours your
[1:10:10] flesh is weak well the only I got to
[1:10:14] hold a goose your flesh ain't got it he
[1:10:18] went away again the second time and
[1:10:20] prayed saying O my father if this cup
[1:10:23] may not pass away from me except I drink
[1:10:27] it thy will be done and he came and
[1:10:30] found them asleep again for their eyes
[1:10:34] were heavy but the sleep of God's people
[1:10:40] is never total it is never totally
[1:10:44] concerned to them that they are like the
[1:10:46] world with one they cannot be awakened
[1:10:49] out of their sleep thank God thank God
[1:10:52] though the bride is asleep now though
[1:10:55] the bride here Peter James John Matthew
[1:10:57] Bartholomew you know whoever was that
[1:10:59] was there they were asleep if the Lord
[1:11:01] Jesus ever needed them to be praying for
[1:11:05] him to be of moral support sustaining
[1:11:08] the Lord we don't understand what's
[1:11:09] going on but we're with you what behind
[1:11:12] you all the way and he tells him cannot
[1:11:14] you watch with me one hour and he goes
[1:11:17] and comes back and what does he find the
[1:11:19] same thing again and if all the times he
[1:11:21] needed them what did he find his hair
[1:11:24] was wet the locks of his hair is
[1:11:26] dripping with the night Dew and what did
[1:11:29] he find his bride asleep was it his
[1:11:35] fault not at all
[1:11:36] was it his shortcoming not at all now
[1:11:41] let me remind you again unless you men

[1:13:10] know some of you struggle with it one of
[1:13:13] these days you're gonna look back and
[1:13:14] you're gonna realize you're stinking
[1:13:16] free moral agency nearly got you lost if
[1:13:20] God will left us to our own choice they
[1:13:22] probably be one of us sitting in this
[1:13:23] place tonight it was God's mercy that
[1:13:26] saved us let me tell you one thing you
[1:13:28] are just a mercy God that saved this is
[1:13:30] a mercy God that keeps us
[1:13:32] it's the mercy of God that forgives us
[1:13:34] of our slothfulness oh ma Oh hallelujah
[1:13:42] the flash of the believer it's the only
[1:13:47] thing asleep so the bride hears his
[1:13:55] voice but it is the heart to hear sit
[1:14:00] how can the heart here brother David
[1:14:03] it's the hidden man of the heart that
[1:14:07] hears
[1:14:08] but now listen the world itself
[1:14:11] sometimes is not enough to wait the
[1:14:16] bride from her sleepiness now I'm going
[1:14:21] to say that ahead of it and let you
[1:14:22] think on it for a little bit
[1:14:24] her soul filled with the Holy Ghost oh
[1:14:27] she loves him she loves him but how
[1:14:31] believers need to distinguish as this
[1:14:35] Shulamite did I sleep but heart my heart
[1:14:44] stirs as I don't care if you're a
[1:14:48] preacher if you're a deacon if you're
[1:14:50] evangelist if you're a world-renowned
[1:14:51] individual there's gonna come spots in
[1:14:54] your life and your walk with God
[1:14:56] you're gonna need refilling and you're
[1:14:59] gonna need a stirring
[1:15:07] amen now we all know our flesh cannot be
[1:15:13] trusted Romans chapter 8 verse 1 there
[1:15:16] is therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:15:18] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[1:15:20] after the flesh but after the spirit and
[1:15:22] verse 4 says that the righteousness of
[1:15:25] the law might be fulfilled in us who
[1:15:27] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:15:30] spirit galatians 5:16 this I say then
[1:15:33] walk in the spirit and you shall not
[1:15:36] fulfill the lusts of the flesh
[1:15:39] you mean a person a born-again child of
[1:15:42] God has the ability of fulfilling the
[1:15:44] lust of the flesh if you believe what
[1:15:46] Paul said you did notice again the
[1:15:49] ungracious chapter 5 verse 17 for the
[1:15:52] flesh lusteth against the spirit
[1:15:55] capitalist and the spirit against the
[1:15:58] flesh and these things are contrary one
[1:16:02] to the other
[1:16:04] amen so that ye cannot do the things
[1:16:08] that ye would why because one is against
[1:16:14] the other why because neither Homer
[1:16:16] isn't this neither one of them is in the
[1:16:20] state of perfection even though you're
[1:16:23] born again tonight you are still limited
[1:16:26] by your humanity and your immortality
[1:16:28] and your soul can not do fully what it
[1:16:32] wants to do it wants to be annecy off on
[1:16:34] it it wants to be in the eternal bliss
[1:16:37] of the heaviness and yet it cannot be
[1:16:40] because it's held captive in this body
[1:16:42] of time and your body cannot do
[1:16:45] everything at once today because it's
[1:16:47] got a new king sitting on the throne of
[1:16:50] your heart some need a lot of them can
[1:16:54] do what they completely wanted her
[1:16:56] [Applause]
[1:16:58] [Music]
[1:17:07] so she takes a bath she goes over to the
[1:17:16] bed
[1:17:17] she puts off her day clothes butts on
[1:17:21] her night class maybe every intention
[1:17:25] was to stay awake for him she loved him
[1:17:31] she wanted to Ben what's the scene when
[1:17:34] he came in but she wasn't sure what time
[1:17:37] he was coming back they rarely thought
[1:17:44] it's 1977 but now she found that it
[1:17:47] wasn't them and then the thought is two
[1:17:49] thousand one and two thousand whatever
[1:17:51] whatever you know so she just wasn't
[1:17:53] really sure because he never told her
[1:17:55] exactly the day or the hour when he was
[1:17:56] going to come so she tried to set him
[1:17:58] he'll night since she's just sitting up
[1:18:00] reading just really your eyes ever cross
[1:18:12] when you get to that point I'm just
[1:18:23] gonna slide down the bed I'm not going
[1:18:25] to sleep okay I'm not going to sleep I'm
[1:18:29] waiting for him but I'm just gonna scoot
[1:18:34] down in this bed and she slid down in
[1:18:37] that tempur-pedic or whatever this she
[1:18:40] had oh my the pillow was so cozy I said
[1:18:47] Courtney there's a little they used to
[1:18:48] come to our house and stay they don't do
[1:18:49] it anymore now they're growing up so
[1:18:51] they don't not come to our house and say
[1:18:52] no more
[1:18:53] Courtney would come and should stay and
[1:18:55] should turn and flop and wallow and
[1:18:58] Carol say Courtney honey what's the

[1:19:11] all
[1:19:12] I swear the Lord has to kick us out of
[1:19:17] our comfort zone sometimes yeah it's a
[1:19:21] shame early but we have to have it she
[1:19:24] had no intention I'm gonna sleep she's
[1:19:26] gonna wait on him I mean my goodness
[1:19:28] this is the love of her life the brother
[1:19:32] feels she just slides on down a little
[1:19:34] more mattress oh this pillow feels so
[1:19:39] good but I'm not going to say not me

[1:19:44] I see show me all fight it that way in
[1:19:49] church I mean you pinch yourself your
[1:19:51] wife will gouge on the side it's a
[1:19:53] wonder to me some of your brothers ain't
[1:19:54] got broke ribs it's just a bit of
[1:20:06] dramatizing this I'm off at a half every
[1:20:07] sleep well y'all can't sleep - not
[1:20:11] relive this okay relive this drama of
[1:20:13] going into sleep and all of a sudden
[1:20:16] miss you close their eyes and nope I'm
[1:20:17] not going to this I am absolutely not
[1:20:19] going to their work and she just drifts
[1:20:27] oh I can't do this okay I've got to be
[1:20:34] on fire we're in the last days wars and
[1:20:37] rumors of wars and talks of atomic bombs
[1:20:39] and hydrogen bombs and I've got to stay
[1:20:41] awake I've gotta stay awake I've worked
[1:20:50] so hard today
[1:20:52] I don't anybody understand how difficult
[1:20:55] my life is I'm the only one in the world
[1:20:58] is having a difficult life no you're not
[1:21:02] [Applause]
[1:21:09] and finally she just came fighting no
[1:21:12] more
[1:21:13] and she found that spot and then she's
[1:21:24] in she's out and she hears something
[1:21:31] it's almost like she's in a dream
[1:21:34] she's not a prophet of course so she
[1:21:36] don't worry the prophetic or I'm a
[1:21:37] vision but it's like she's in a dream
[1:21:39] you've had drinks before and you come in
[1:21:41] and out of them and parts of them come
[1:21:43] out with you because the brother man
[1:21:44] said there's a part of you that's in
[1:21:45] that dream so it's sort of like she's in
[1:21:48] a dream is it a dream or is it is it
[1:21:50] real so she's she's asleep but she hears
[1:21:55] faintly open up sweetheart open up she's
[1:22:03] what what well I must be dreaming no I'm
[1:22:10] all right I'm good I'm good
[1:22:12] if things fine now I'm good open now
[1:22:15] what open up I'm asleep but in my heart
[1:22:25] is this the same girl that said my
[1:22:28] beloved suck the Rose of Sharon and the
[1:22:34] lily of the valley my beloved is this
[1:22:36] and this and all my she just went on and
[1:22:39] on and on now she hears him and she said
[1:22:42] what what you say was she was not fast
[1:22:54] asleep as a matter of fact she still had
[1:22:57] a candle burning she was wise so she
[1:23:04] still had a light burning by her bedside
[1:23:09] so she was not in the in the last stage
[1:23:13] of sleep tour she's gone out to where
[1:23:15] subcon
[1:23:16] since it's finally kitchen in the beta
[1:23:17] waves have moved now inside of a brain
[1:23:19] and now the brain has calmed all these
[1:23:21] things down inside of her body and now
[1:23:23] she's entered into that deep sleep zone
[1:23:26] she's still going in and she's got this
[1:23:29] light going she can never sleep with
[1:23:30] alive anyway so she got this like going
[1:23:33] in and still they're honest she's not
[1:23:34] dead and saying you understand
[1:23:36] she is not sleeping like the lamb she is
[1:23:40] not dead and sin the way they are but
[1:23:44] she's just not where she needs to be she
[1:23:52] is not a new judicial slumber given to
[1:23:55] her by the Almighty God but which she's
[1:23:57] entered into the point of no return that
[1:24:00] she'll never know right from wrong again
[1:24:03] she's just snoring and now she's and now
[1:24:09] she's not not in universities finally
[1:24:12] submitted to that stage and it's just
[1:24:14] kind of overtaking her this phrase that
[1:24:18] she used it's a phrase used to describe
[1:24:21] a sluggish slothful human being a little
[1:24:30] sleep a little slumber Solomon said a
[1:24:33] little folding of the hands so is the
[1:24:37] way of the sluggard they're indifferent
[1:24:41] to lukewarm and to sluggish about divine
[1:24:46] things they content themselves with the
[1:24:50] bare necessities of religion to comfort
[1:24:56] and ease the conscience while still
[1:24:58] believe in God I still believe in the
[1:25:00] message or her brother no he's a good
[1:25:01] man absolutely but I'm just having some
[1:25:03] problems right now so she's entered into
[1:25:08] this state now listen friend it will be
[1:25:11] worse for us than any other age because
[1:25:16] of the spirit of our age being the
[1:25:19] spirit of Laodicea and no other age was
[1:25:25] Jesus put out of the church like he
[1:25:27] wasn't our age
[1:25:29] can I have a few more minutes revelation
[1:25:32] 3:14 it says unto the Angel of the
[1:25:35] Church of the Laodiceans write these
[1:25:38] things saith the Amen the faithful and
[1:25:41] true witness the beginning of the
[1:25:44] creation of God I know thy works thou
[1:25:47] art neither cold nor hot I would the
[1:25:49] tower cold nor hot so then because thou
[1:25:52] art lukewarm neither cold nor hot I will
[1:25:57] spew thee out of my mouth in other words
[1:26:03] that make God fond it may God sick of
[1:26:07] his stomach
[1:26:09] what's this a prophet says it this way
[1:26:11] God said I'd rather you'd be hot real
[1:26:13] red-hot Tyler finally I'd rather you'd
[1:26:19] be real red hot or freezing be one or
[1:26:23] the other don't get lukewarm cuz you
[1:26:27] make me sick
[1:26:29] that's what this church age does for God
[1:26:32] it makes him sick my goodness oh my
[1:26:40] either be red hot or don't be lukewarm
[1:26:42] warm or hot cuz you make me vomit
[1:26:46] the chilliness of the Anglian Church and
[1:26:50] the days of John Wesley drove him to
[1:26:52] have meetings elsewhere because it was
[1:26:55] cold chilly friends people are starving
[1:27:01] to death for love
[1:27:03] believe me I've dealt with enough people
[1:27:06] who's been in extramarital affairs to
[1:27:09] know that a cold husband or a cold wife
[1:27:13] can turn a marriage into utter hell on
[1:27:16] earth praise the Lord a cold mother and
[1:27:21] father can raise cold children turn them
[1:27:25] into murderers
[1:27:27] people are starving to death enough I
[1:27:30] come at this early GUI Laodicea stuff
[1:27:32] I'm talking about real love real love
[1:27:36] will correct you when you're wrong but
[1:27:38] the real real loss we were made to be
[1:27:41] loved but not only made to be loved we
[1:27:45] were made to love I am convinced many
[1:27:48] many many people who live on the face of
[1:27:51] this earth today do not understand the
[1:27:53] first principle of how to love another
[1:27:56] human being
[1:27:58] they love them with selfishness they
[1:28:00] love them with a scale and if they do
[1:28:02] this and this and this for that
[1:28:04] individual they expected the same thing
[1:28:06] to be done on their side and they're
[1:28:07] always weighing I've done this and this
[1:28:10] and this and this and this for you the
[1:28:11] real love of God keeps no record you're
[1:28:15] scared to death you're gonna do more for
[1:28:18] her than she does for you insist you're
[1:28:20] scared to death you're gonna do a little
[1:28:22] more for him than he does back for you
[1:28:25] you need to be feeling the Holy Ghost
[1:28:27] you need to have the love of God cause
[1:28:30] the love of God don't keep her rocker
[1:28:32] can you imagine God keeping a record of
[1:28:35] what you've done for him versus what
[1:28:38] he's done for you can you imagine how
[1:28:43] the scale would be lopsided
[1:28:49] I'm the Chernus of the England Church in
[1:28:53] the days of John Wesley drove him to
[1:28:55] have meetings elsewhere because it was
[1:28:57] cold and chilly
[1:28:58] the chilliness of the Methodist Church
[1:29:00] cause William Booth
[1:29:02] to become a red-hot salvation astir
[1:29:06] but amber there's William booths they
[1:29:08] become quite violent that's right all
[1:29:11] right he wants you read harder freeze
[1:29:13] and one of the other don't be lukewarm
[1:29:14] don't just don't pretend something that
[1:29:17] you haven't God either be on fire for
[1:29:19] God had gone back into the organization
[1:29:21] don't be lukewarm
[1:29:23] it may sound awful to you but let me
[1:29:26] tell you something friend I'm glad some
[1:29:27] of these unbelievers have been sent
[1:29:29] around the message for years and year
[1:29:30] that went back to their old dog vomit
[1:29:32] that's why they belong in the first
[1:29:33] place
[1:29:35] they didn't bomb among us our foods too
[1:29:38] rich that's right
[1:29:41] Laodicea makes him sick eagle food makes
[1:29:44] them sick so you're gonna be sick one or
[1:29:46] the other either that he's gonna be on
[1:29:48] fire with God oh my what is this again
[1:29:55] mark of the beast we see him when Daniel
[1:29:57] saw he come at ten thousand ten ten
[1:30:00] thousands of his Saints is that right
[1:30:01] and the books were opened another book
[1:30:03] was opened which is the book of life and
[1:30:05] every man there comes up you're lukewarm
[1:30:07] Church this is what they're called
[1:30:11] sleeping virgin you see if you stay in a
[1:30:19] lukewarm condition it shows you're not
[1:30:22] bright can the bride get lukewarm oh yes
[1:30:25] machine will stay there
[1:30:29] y'all ever have lukewarm times in your
[1:30:31] marriage you folks at them that imagine
[1:30:33] time to raise your hand let you know
[1:30:35] things are stress and maybe financial
[1:30:36] difficulties and whatever more but you
[1:30:38] know what you love one another more than
[1:30:40] you you want to let the stress stop you
[1:30:41] know because you come back to the very
[1:30:43] foundation we loved one another we
[1:30:45] married because we loved one another we
[1:30:48] are not going to let these things
[1:30:49] separate our love that's the way we
[1:30:51] ought to feel about Christ Jesus he
[1:30:53] loves you you loved him you didn't come
[1:30:55] to him because of blessings you didn't
[1:30:57] come to him because he promised
[1:30:58] everything was going to be good you come
[1:31:00] there because he loves you and you loved
[1:31:02] him then trials and tests and
[1:31:05] tribulation and persecution they were to
[1:31:07] separate you from the love of God
[1:31:09] because you love him more than trouble
[1:31:12] you love him more than heartaches notice
[1:31:19] again he said these two messengers out
[1:31:20] sending messages went in there and Lord
[1:31:23] had to give his message now notice these
[1:31:25] two messengers these two angels they
[1:31:27] come the Lord and tell him what God's
[1:31:29] fixing to do Locke goes out and still
[1:31:31] try to tell the sodomites so God's gonna
[1:31:33] destroy this place he goes and tells his
[1:31:35] family notice he says Lord had to give
[1:31:37] his message but it didn't sound did
[1:31:40] nothing to them they didn't pay any
[1:31:42] attention to him cause the life he had
[1:31:44] lived
[1:31:45] proved it lukewarm church till you want
[1:31:50] to tell your children the importance of
[1:31:52] the message you want to raise them up
[1:31:54] and the message how do you live at home
[1:31:56] now your your fussing and fighting is
[1:31:59] carrying on and you want to tell them
[1:32:01] about the truth lord have mercy
[1:32:06] y'all see me on the side of the road
[1:32:08] Monday will preach for food I'll
[1:32:11] probably voted out after this notice
[1:32:14] this they didn't pay no attention to him
[1:32:16] because the life he lived proven
[1:32:18] lukewarm Church even his own children
[1:32:21] didn't believe in him now this is what a
[1:32:26] man or a woman that continues in
[1:32:28] lukewarmness this is what it proves you
[1:32:30] lose your testimony even in your own
[1:32:33] home what difference does it make of we
[1:32:35] all thank your Saints and your children
[1:32:37] I got a lick of confidence in Jesus
[1:32:44] Jesus notice again the countdown listen
[1:32:49] when he he would spews them when they
[1:32:51] got lukewarm and it's spewing time he
[1:32:55] rejects that he takes the remnant out of
[1:32:57] it and the countdowns over and the
[1:32:59] astronaut is gone for the heavens oh my
[1:33:04] brother sister by God's grace I am NOT
[1:33:06] going to be spewed out how many's going
[1:33:08] with me we're not going to be spewed out
[1:33:10] I refuse all brother Donnie have you
[1:33:12] ever needed that time in your life
[1:33:13] absolutely I give and give and give and
[1:33:16] give and I give so much of my life to
[1:33:18] very selfish people let me tell you some
[1:33:21] of the message people are some of the
[1:33:22] most selfish people I've ever seen in my
[1:33:23] life
[1:33:24] they'll kill you they'll preach you to
[1:33:26] death and sends you home nearly dead in
[1:33:28] the casket but all they want is your
[1:33:30] gift and all my you ain't really a works
[1:33:32] on y'all tell your friends but I refuse
[1:33:35] to let people pulling on me pulling on
[1:33:37] me determine my attitude oh let me take
[1:33:40] some I could ride not a book I could
[1:33:42] write volumes of books of the way that
[1:33:45] I've been treated by people in this
[1:33:46] senescence but you know what I refuse to
[1:33:49] let them control my joy I refuse to let
[1:33:52] them control my
[1:33:53] - God will never make me answer for your
[1:33:57] attitude but it will make me answer for
[1:34:00] mine
[1:34:00] and I want to have the rhyme but that's
[1:34:05] right
[1:34:06] notice this again gods provide a place
[1:34:07] of worship now we're seated together in
[1:34:09] heavenly places in Christ Jesus in
[1:34:11] Christ Jesus setting in there listen to
[1:34:13] this I love this setting in there that
[1:34:16] great seat that's already fired up hey
[1:34:23] man the astronaut seat you're sitting on
[1:34:27] is already fired up we just need to get
[1:34:30] some of the fire off the seat and us
[1:34:36] this great astronaut seat is already
[1:34:39] final Oh glory been raised from the dead
[1:34:42] and we are part of it if you're part of
[1:34:46] the bride you are because the bride is a
[1:34:47] part of the groom you know so we find
[1:34:49] out it's exactly the same thing and
[1:34:51] she'll do exactly what he predicted for
[1:34:54] her to do in this day she won't be a
[1:34:57] letter CL not by no means lukewarm but
[1:35:04] she'll be on fire for God she'll be
[1:35:08] moving on in the spirit of God
[1:35:12] [Applause]
[1:35:18] mr. Wayne God but about 50 some more
[1:35:25] pages but what happened what happened to
[1:35:46] her laughs her see her great adjectives
[1:35:52] of love about which she described him
[1:35:53] and how she felt I believe she was
[1:35:56] almost I believe she felt this way about
[1:35:57] him but something that happened it's
[1:36:03] hard for me to believe this is a
[1:36:04] one-time incident same way it is with
[1:36:07] you and Alan we get cold indifferent it
[1:36:09] ain't just a one-time deal and no doubt
[1:36:11] it lab was led up by this and this let
[1:36:14] go of this that go of that rearranging
[1:36:15] priorities and the next thing you know
[1:36:17] you're still going to church and you're
[1:36:18] still picking up the same books and
[1:36:19] listening the same tapes occasionally
[1:36:21] but you're not connecting like you did
[1:36:23] before are you asleep
[1:36:30] are you hearing this voice but yet it's
[1:36:34] not enough to rouse you she heard his
[1:36:37] voice as well look at in the morning if
[1:36:39] I get to preach to Kim tomorrow she
[1:36:44] heard his voice and it it did move her
[1:36:48] but it did not arouse her but you know
[1:36:52] what it was that actually finally got a
[1:36:55] hold of her that moved her it was when
[1:36:59] she saw his hand so I put his hand to
[1:37:06] the hole in the door the doors are not
[1:37:09] like ours today but they would have a
[1:37:11] hole in there about which a family
[1:37:15] member would be able to come in and know
[1:37:17] the trips and the be able to open it up
[1:37:20] so she heard his word and heard his word
[1:37:22] and heard his word but when she saw his
[1:37:25] hand and his hand came through the hole
[1:37:28] in the door
[1:37:29] you tell that to mercy of God he is so
[1:37:33] determined to get her attention
[1:37:35] his voice speaks and it still doesn't do
[1:37:39] it for so the hand of God moved in her
[1:37:42] life when she was undeserving how many
[1:37:49] times have we heard his word heard his
[1:37:50] word
[1:37:51] heard his word heard his word and that
[1:37:52] didn't shake us that didn't it always
[1:37:54] said Amen I know I need to do better I
[1:37:56] know I need to do it and what does God
[1:37:57] do the hand of God will move in right
[1:38:00] not always in correction and
[1:38:01] chastisement just whooping the fire out
[1:38:02] of you but the Spirit of God would just
[1:38:04] move on your heart and soften that a
[1:38:07] hard shell that you've turned into and
[1:38:10] was the hand of God dripping with summer
[1:38:13] we got our attention then she began to
[1:38:16] wake up in her house well their heads
[1:38:33] bowed and no one looking around her I
[1:38:37] wonder if there'd be one or let me now
[1:38:41] set that way I wonder how many there
[1:38:42] would be I would like to say to the Lord
[1:38:45] Lord I want to stir out of this slumber
[1:38:51] Lord I love you though my heart Lord
[1:38:55] odda
[1:38:55] I don't want to be lukewarm I don't want
[1:38:58] to be indifferent just raise your hand
[1:39:01] to God god bless you I may be many of
[1:39:05] you tonight or not in slumber but you'd
[1:39:07] say brother Donny I really need a stern
[1:39:10] III just I need a refill it would you
[1:39:14] like to raise your hand to God
[1:39:16] mine goes up on that a man mister spare
[1:39:22] heads together now I want you to hold
[1:39:24] your requests before the Lord maybe
[1:39:28] you're not even sure what you need but
[1:39:31] you felt like this word God spoke to
[1:39:34] your heart
[1:39:37] Heavenly Father we approach you tonight
[1:39:40] as the faulty flawed imperfect bride
[1:39:46] that we are we know in our souls in
[1:39:50] Christ Jesus we are without fault
[1:39:54] it's a mystery really the word can come
[1:39:58] and it can preach us to the highest
[1:40:01] heavens to where we feel like at any
[1:40:03] moment we're going to be changed and the
[1:40:06] very next service that word will come it
[1:40:09] will bring us so low we feel like we
[1:40:11] could crawl out from underneath the door
[1:40:13] but Lord we know it's because it's the
[1:40:16] two parts of us and then we need this
[1:40:20] kind of preaching it shows us either the
[1:40:23] flesh has got the upper hand or you're
[1:40:25] warning us that it's fixing to whichever
[1:40:29] Lord I don't question you know these are
[1:40:32] not my favorite type of sermons to
[1:40:34] preach but after all I don't work for
[1:40:37] myself I'll work for you this is not the
[1:40:41] favorite type of sermon for them to hear
[1:40:43] from their pastor but after all I don't
[1:40:47] work for them so therefore we have
[1:40:50] assembled ourselves that we might hear

[1:41:00] their seat and they were spellbound by
[1:41:03] great deep words that I had to say but
