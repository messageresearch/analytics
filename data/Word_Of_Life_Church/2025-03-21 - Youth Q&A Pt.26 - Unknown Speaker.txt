[Music] hallelujah thank you Jesus Lord you're worthy wory of all the glory all the honor and all the prise Mak me one a shout me one a shout praise the Lord what a privilege for us to be able to stand once again in the presence of almighty God imagine if we would have been Gentiles and we would have heard that God was moving among a a group of people that say lived over in elizabethon and they were called Jews or Hebrews or Israelites and we could see in the distance that Pillar of Fire hanging over the top of that Tabernacle and we heard God had opened the Red Sea and God had fed them and God had done such wonderful things but we were Gentiles so we just stand on the outside and say man what it must be like to have a living God like that and we just dream about it and think about it but you know what we don't have to dream about it tonight that God is our God aren't you glad and we're so glad that we don't have to point back in time and so well God used to do great things boy when brother Brandon was here God done awesome things when Paul was here God done awesome things well they're not here but he still is here amen we're so grateful for that we're going to pray before we start the question answers and um just a couple of requests that I want to make known to you tonight brother Steve Nome is in real real need of prayer not able to eat and and they found he has some kidney stones which has been really really painful for him and just having several issues in his body um also I mentioned it last night about brother Michael Carter and his family and also Carol was was not feeling good unable to be here tonight so I wonder how many of you have a request just like to lift your hand there before the Lord all right Heavenly Father we we have been invited to come into your presence to bring our petitions our needs and our requests so as little children we come before you tonight and when we were small children and we would ask our parents for things and sometimes they would say yes and sometimes we might ask for something that we didn't realize it but it could actually cause us harm down the road and our parents might say no you can't have that or no I cannot give you that well why mama why daddy there's something in us that inquisitive thing so Lord all we know to do is bring our petitions before for you and we know you've done us the same way there's things we've asked you for and you've said no there's other things we've asked you for and maybe you gave us a wait a while but we know that when we pray so all we know to do is bring our petitions and just say father your will be done that way we know when we're praying we're always praying in the will of God so if we would ask for anything that would hinder us anything that would not be your will then father we pray your will would take precedent over our desire and our request but we believe Lord that whenever we come together like this that we're always asking for the right thing for you to be in our midst for you said in your word if any two or three are gathered together in my name I'll be in their midst that's not based upon Thursday nights Wednesday night wedes wind rain snow Sun you gave no conditions to that promise and we're so grateful we sent you already here tonight Lord and we want to thank you the building ain't full there's not hundreds like there was here last night and Sunday and and we'll be Sunday coming up and then in just a few short days our youth Gathering and hundreds will gather again I'm so grateful you didn't lend it just where it would have to be a minimum of 200 or a minimum of 300 but we know your way is if there's only one that you would come so we ask you'd help us tonight help me father to be able to get out of the way we pray that you be mindful of the sick Lord Brother Ste Steve new has a real need in his body father you know his situation we pray for our brother tonight dear God In The Name of Jesus we pray for brother Michael Carter and his family also Lord ask you that you'd be mindful of Carol tonight and all feel like coming to Ser service and others that are sick and needy all these these young people had needs and desires be mindful of them we pray in the name of Jesus Amen praise the Lord I know you're probably wondering if I'm ever going to get this question answered like we keep going back to the same one over and over again but I've just found so many wonderful things about it because it it certainly affects all of our Lives can you explain why brother brandom is Vindicated prophet and why the message is correct I have a difficult time speaking to why I believe what I believe God bless you you may be seated so we'll read first of all tonight from the scripture in the book of 1st Samuel chapter 3:1 I know that we've referred to this already but just for a little more of a foundation tonight and the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli and the word word of the Lord was precious in those days the word of the Lord was precious in those days and there was no open Vision now that seems like a strange vernacular for us but let me show you what it actually means so the word open means to break through or to burst out or to break open so there was no breaking through or no bursting out and that that's the word open and then the word vision is Vision in a static state or Oracle prophecy or a Divine communication now during this time when this is written they had already had now the first five books of Moses which they was calling the Torah which was the law so why would the word of the Lord be precious they already had Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers and Deuteronomy Joshua comes sometime after that so they already had books that they could read which they believe was the word of God so why was the word precious well it it's an it's a certain part of the word that was precious and that was the open Vision so they needed something that would be currently applicable to the day and the hour that they live so the Torah was there and they could still be able to do that but it was mostly containing Thou shalt and thou shalt not you dress this certain way you'll not mix linen and Woolen together in your garments so when you plant your garden you'll not sew diverse kinds of seed in your field if you've got a scab you've got a soar you've got a certain way to treat it if you've got a a bloody flux you've got a certain way so it was one thing after another after another but they were facing issues in this day and time that they needed help they needed to be enlightened on what to do so the Torah actually didn't cover some of the needs where they were me Carol was talking about y I told her said you know it's absolutely amazing that God could have made the Bible where the Bible in every age would constantly be added to so God would have given the Bible in the days of the book of Acts and then God in a few years later after a couple of centuries or so God could have sent other men they would have wrote it down and say all right now this is a supplement to your Bible then in another 2300 years there would be another supplement and another supplement and another supplement and then in our day there would been another one why why would that seem NE necessary because sin advances how many of us believe that it's wrong for a woman to abort her baby where does the bible say that how many believes it's wrong for young people old people to take fentanyl morphine cocaine where does the bible say that how many believes it be wrong for a father to have incest with his daughter where does the bible say that ah I thought I'd get you now what I find amazing is most of the denominational churches preach against every one of them questions I just raised so where did they get scripture from it for it to back it up testing one two now this happens to the old people I didn't think it happened to you young people I'm losing communication now you see God knew that sin would advance and there would be television there would be smartphones there would be all kinds of things so if we are held simply by the restriction or the vernacular of the Old Testament and the new I can never preach against another abuse of a smartphone I cannot scripturally stand and preach against some of the very things that I just mentioned to you so drug addiction that's gone smoking cigarettes that's gone preaching against denominations that's gone there were no denominations when the Bible was written so how is God going to deal with sin in the Modern Age God will update it but he don't bring a new Bible he sends men with the word of the Lord now you see in this setting of Samuel it was such a time frame again now they had already come to a spot to where that they were changing toward the emphasis of the Nations around them now in the Old Testament when the people of God moved into the land of of promised or land of Palestine later become Palestine actually but whenever they moved into that the the Torah gave them a few things in the book of Deuteronomy and a few things in the Book of Leviticus when you get to the land do this and this and this but for the most part it was not written concerning their due inheritance Joshua said a little bit about it but not much so it was more about their behavior and the journey and what they would do so what God did was God needed to be able to send a word that would pertain to the time frame because around all the Canaanites and there's different people around them and they were Nations Nations keep that in mind Nations so they was around these people and they would start acting like them so then we know that Israel come to a time that they wanted a king and why did they tell this man here Samuel when he grew up and become an older man what was their excuse for telling him they said we want a king King like all the rest of the Nations so Israel their entire history they fought against the separation from Nations we don't find it so much today with Nations as much as we do denoms so we have denominations around us and they want to constantly oh you don't need to do that you don't have to dress that way you don't have to preach this you don't need all that stuff as Israel thought it was Nations so do we now think whenever Samuel was born he was he was of course a prophet from from his birth ordained of God but he starts out as a young boy so the word of the Lord was precious in other words there was no one that would be able to break into the realm of his eyes being wide open and the word of the Lord come to him in such a perfect way that it would be the same as if it was a written bible now I know that staggers a lot of people but it ain't my fault they're ignorant and dumb if they'd read their Bible they'd realize it now watch this and the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli which was a priest and the word of the Lord was precious in those days there was no open Vision now we read this last time Proverbs 29:18 where there is no vision exact same thing now remember the word Vision here is not well our church has got a vision we're going to expand we're going to grow we're going to have a baseball team a basketball team a football team a soccer team we're going to play tag on Wednesday we're going to play Bingle on Thursday and we're doing all this so we can have a vision people are absolutely defaming God's word by using this scripture for church growth it has nothing to do with church grows and they're adding to the word of God when they do it where there is no vision the people Parish it is an estatic State an oracle a prophecy Divine communication I wonder where we'd be tonight if God had not sent us his Prophet messenger and the people will perish and you can see why Satan wants to pull people away from a prophetic Insight so what would we do we'd all revert back just to reading the Bible we love our Bible I love my Bible now more than I did when I first started reading it as a 12y old boy and the message never replace my Bible and it never will as a matter of fact it helps me to un understand my Bible better but when I read my Bible I read my Bible through the understanding of an of an open Vision in this last day now many of your friends that you work with when to school with college with some of you that you work with now good Baptist people Methodist people Lutheran people that may have the exact same version of Bible you have but why is it they don't see the same things you do some of them are spring sprinkled some of them are baptized in titles some of them believe this and that and the other some of them may said under a woman preacher some of them may believe all kinds of things over 45,000 denominations as I mentioned to you last time and what do most of them say they're based on the Bible the Bible so we don't need a new Bible do we we don't need a new rendition of the Bible what did we need an open Vision that would point us right back brother re did not come to write us a new Bible we didn't need a new Bible we needed an open Vision to say how does Matthew 28:19 tie together with acts 238 when you get time sometime ask AI on chat GPT when was water baptism changed one of the brothers of our church just did it a few weeks ago and he sent it to me and even the AI had the date right the Nan Council right and spit it out several paragraphs then he asked AI what about the serpent Seed doctrine and it spit it right back out again and people think brother Brandon was the one that come up with the serpent Seed doctrine huh this has been believed by the Hebrews for millennium praise the Lord so what do we need not a new Bible not a new commentary but a man that had the ability of God to have an open vision and say this is the correct baptism right here acts 238 is the interpretation of Matthew 28:19 wonderful praise the Lord now let's watch and see how accurate that when a prophet who is gifted by God breaks into the supernatural Realm by Vision or SLR I want you to notice this it's it's quite shocking numbers 24:2 balum lifted up his eyes now remember balum wound up being identified as a false prophet the Bible actually calls him in the Book of Joshua I'll share it with you in a moment as a soothsayer but balum had a genuine gift in his life now watch how infallable this gift actually is though the man himself was not now balam lifted up his eyes and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes and the spirit of God came upon him and he took up his Parable and said balum the son of beor hath said the man whose eyes are open hath said now y all remember the background of this story there was a great King by the name of BAC and he heard the children of Israel were coming up and they were coming near the land of Moab he did not want them around his people he despised them so he heard that there was a Prophet by the name of balum so he sent some of his Messengers over to hire him that he might be able to curse the children of Israel now because a a prophet's gift seemed to the untaught very similar to a witch or a soothsayer or a fortune teller so baac thought well I've heard of witches and I've heard of susers so maybe we need to get us a man like a a medium one that will be able to come and call on the name of his gods and curse these people must have been a strange perception in this time frame so he comes to balum send The Messengers and Bam said let me ask God God said don't you go with these people what are these people doing you're at your house well Lord they come he said no don't you go all right praise the Lord all right so he goes down and tell them hey you know what God told me not go you know the story baac sends some more people greater notoriety greater men offers him a little bit more of a reward hey Bam you know what B said he'd make you this you can be a district man you can be a presbyter an overseer whatever more he said well let me go back and ask the Lord see if the Lord might change his mind about his word you remember the story don't you so he goes back and he asks God God said yeah go on Lord have mercy now BB should have known God never changes his mind about his word but if you want something I want something so bad God might even tell you to do it there's women who want to preach so bad and there's some of them in the discernment that you'll find it and brother brenon would call them out and tell them I see you're a woman preacher now you imagine some of them women leaving those meetings and said God's Prophet told me I was a woman preacher God's Prophet wouldn't changing God's word just simply giving them what they wanted now God gave balam the same thing his mule you remember he beat his mule and the mule saw an angel of the Lord sing in the way I'll go back go back said no go on that's what you want go on but this is the amazing thing about it to me God gets this man and he has a real genuine gift so his eyes are white open and then he says he hath said which heard the words of God and saw the vision of the almighty now he's using words that are descriptive of God that was only known to a select number of people on the Earth the almighty falling into a TR now I know it's hard for us to realize this but having his eyes open so he's just sitting here like you and I would be today and he just falls into a trance and it must have been a spooky thing this look on his face he's he's in a days and and they could pinch him and and hit him but he can't come out of it he's just sitting there like this and his eyes are just his eyes are wide open and he's in a trance now watch what accompanies this trance how goodly are thy tents oh Jacob and thy Tabernacles oh Israel as the valleys are they spread forth as Gardens by the Riverside as the Trees of the lion alows which the Lord has planted as cedar trees beside the waters he shall pour the water out of his buckets his seed shall be in many Waters as his and his King shall be higher than AAG and his kingdom shall be exalted God brought him forth out of Egypt now remember who's saying this it's not Moses it's not Jeremiah it's not ezek it's not Hagi it's it's balum the soothsayer balum the compromiser so this is my question to you if God could so put a gift in a life of a man who would wind up going to hell and that gift was so perfect that he could not could not say anything other than what God put in his mouth and if God could do that through a false prophet what about a true one amen Carol asked me the last time we had question an said are you done with the prophet part of I think yeah I said yeah I think so I ain't got but just maybe a few more scriptures and I I'm I'm probably going to be done with it so what I always like to do is go the next day and and start studing again looked at it so I took my computer and sat down and I I was going through and you know taking all the scriptures and all that out and all of a sudden the spirit of God spoke to me this scripture and I thought rro here we go and oh my goodness when I get in here and I got and started looking at these things I thought oh Jesus thank you so you can imagine now baac is hearing this so his his consorts and all the people that are around him now that they're excited because boy I mean this man he's going to B him he's going to say you bunch of low down rotten people you Israelites you're you've got adultery you've got Liars I curse you in the name of my God but instead he says oh Jacob how goodly are thy tents God brought him forth out of Egypt he has as it were the strength as of a unicorn he shall eat up the Nations his enemies and there he was in the headquarters of one of them so this man is speaking against them so you hire somebody to curse me but the said he curses you and blesses me I mean that's going to make you feel like shouting right going to make you feel like hitting that man in the head with a wet noodle you're going to put him in jail you're you say what in the world's the matter with you I didn't hire you for that but God is showing us something young people God is showing us said if a man has that gift though that man himself could have been as rotten and the evil as he could be but God could speak his word so perfectly out of that man's mouth do you understand some of the greatest Messianic prophecy of the Old Testament were spoken out of the mouth of this lying false prophet but it wasn't his prophecy that was wrong it was his Doctrine wow I figured the devil would be squirming tonight like I don't know what watch how he says he shall eat up the Nations as enemies and shall break their bones and Pierce them through with his ARS even Moses never said this Joshua never gave them these prophecies some of the Great Men of God that live prior to this never said this so you imagine years and years passed by and they referred back to the prophecy of this man he couched he laid down as a lion as a great lion who shall stir him up blessed is he that blesseth thee and cursed is he that curseth thee now notice the next verse and bac's anger was kindled against bam and he smoted his hands together and said baac baac said unto bam I call Thee I call thee to curse my enemies and behold thou us all together bless them these three times this ain't the last time that he done that he's already done it twice now young people I ask you if God could do that to a man who later will turn out to be one of the greatest detriments that Israel ever had because he's going to teach baac by his Doctrine how to seduce Israel so his Doctrine and his prophecy were millions of miles apart this is one of the ways you and I can judge a prophet don't just look at their prophecies don't just look at their healings their miracles their discernments but watch their Doctrine praise the Lord I about had me a fit when I saw this I'll tell you what oh my notice now in verse 15 so he says try it again you know come on come on baby come on try it again and he took up his Parable and said balam the son of beor hath said the man whose eyes are open has said he has said which heard the words of God and knew the knowledge of el Elon the most high Abraham was the first human being on the earth to ever utter these words where did Bam get this l l yon one of the Sacred secret names compound names names of adoni but this man is speaking words he don't even know you understand that's the way true tongues and true interpretation and true prophecy is that a person can speak things that's beyond their own wisdom amen these preachers Brothers will understand you'll be up preaching sometimes and you'll be preaching by the spirit of God and the Holy Ghost will anoint you to say things and it'll scare you when you say and say oh my goodness I hope that was right was that right Lord that was right I hope that was right cuz it scares you see when you when you know it then you can say it with such confidence this is what I always do I go home that night I get my computer and I go to typing it in oh I wipe the sweat off the brow of my face and I say y there it is word for word for word so the Holy Ghost knew what me in my head did know so he could speak it out of me and he come right back and say yep right there it is now watch this so he says he heard the words of God and he knew the knowledge of the most high which saw the vision of the almighty falling into a trance but having his eyes open now I put this down I want you to read this with me balam mention three sacred names of God God eel the powerful one the most high Elon the uplifted one and the allmighty Shady ey the Abundant one or the almighty one wow we would have been impressed impressed greatly if would have been s said where did he get this at how does he know this he's never been in one of our message services that we know of he's never tended to use convention he's from way and some other country but the spirit of God so had him under control he was prophesying the message of the hour and didn't even believe it is this phenomenal or what so I ask you if God could do this with a false prophet what about a man whose life is so surrendered to God and consecrated to God what about it young people now notice in numbers 24:17 I shall see him but not now I Shall Behold Him but not now listen this there shall come a star out of Jacob glory to God and a scepter shall arise out of Israel do you understand at the birth of the Lord Jesus the Magi this is the scripture brother Malachi that the Magi were looking to be fulfilled and it come through the mouth of a false prophet wow you said brother how can that be because God put that genuine gift there and God got that genuine gift so under control that man couldn't say nothing else he didn't even believe it he'd probably get so mad at himself he might smack yourself in the mouth I ain't saying that again yes you will cuz God's going to make you say it if God could do that for a man that don't even want to do it what about God's anointed servants I'm I'm talking about it's just us preachers that ain't even prophets if we pray and submit oursel to God can God use us to help his children and set him free and bring Deliverance to him this man don't even love the Lord this man don't even love Israel and God made him say it praise God there shall come a star out of Jacob and a scepter shall rise out of Israel and shall Smite the corners of Moab anybody know where he was at this time when the prophecy come forth aha you guess it right Moab so this went over real good at the convention didn't it wow so you're standing up there and you're prophesying against these very people and destroy all the children of shef wow literally in this Prophecy in the Hebrew there shall come forth a star out of Jacob the verb that this man used is in the prophetic past I want you to listen to what a realm this man broke into to it's as if so if if as if though this word was already come to pass prophetic history Lord God verse 18 and Edom shall be a possession see also shall be a possession for his enemies and Israel shall do valiantly out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion and shall destroy him that remainest of the city wow now I give let me give you another wow on top of that wow Joshua 13 ver 22 and balum also the son of beor the soothsayer did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them so here they are now on a war and the children of Israel killed this man that spoke these words words and they don't call him a prophet of God they call him a soothsayer you see what happened God updated the identity of this man now the people in that day May said hey man this this guy's a prophet he's a prophet but you see his Doctrine was wrong so you update the man's identity and they did and what they call him a soothsayer praise the Lord God forbid that any of our identity would be updated to be a blasphemer an unbeliever an Infidel amen no no I don't never want my identity to be updated into that I want my identity to be updated well he was standing there in one moment the next moment he disappeared he was gone that's the update I once said about me and you now notice in Joshua 249 then baac the son of zior King of Moab Rose and wared against Israel and sent and called balam the son of beor to curse you but I would not hearken unto balam now what God God is saying this is what I done therefore he blessed you still so I delivered you out of his hand you mean God can take a gift in a man's life that don't even believe what he's saying and would love to curse you and God said nope they're mine you ain't cursing my young ones what in the world does it matter to you as a matter of fact because you want to I'm going to make you bless them bless them bless them bless them and re bless them double bless them quarter off bless them I want you to prophesy about me coming down on the earth say it Lord I don't want to I never ask if you wanted to I told you to say it now say it he said I'll say it I'll say it I'll say it young people of our church if God could make a man like this said what about a prophet in the last days my Nehemiah 13:2 after I started studying this brother Joe I thought yeah Lord I see why you want you wanted to illuminate us just a little bit more because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water now this is what Moab would not do the children of Israel was in a real hard spot and the children of Moab had they had the opportunity to bless them and help them but they said no we're not doing it the children of Israel said look we'll buy it from you if if we can drink a little bit of the water from your creeks and your branches and whatever more and if you'll sell us food we're not asking for a handout if you'll just let us have it we'll buy it they say you ain't doing it get off of our property you bunch of Holy Rollers we don't want you around here and notice what God said because they met the children of Israel they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water but hired balum against them that he should curse them how be it our God I love it when God does this right here turn the curse in to a blessing praise God now look at Jude in the New Testament chapter 1: 11 woe unto them for they have gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily after the error not prophecy error of balum for reward Now watch how Jude separates his prophecy y from his error and perished in the gang saying of Kora Revelation 2:14 which is speaking to one of the church ages but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balum so so you mean balum had some Doctrine well what was it now God is rebuking this church age because they have some people there that were holding to the doctrine of balum balam's teaching notice it doesn't say balam's prophecy but balam's Doctrine now it goes on to describe what this Doctrine was I have a few things against the because th is there them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught baac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel oh now I see so after he got out from under the inspiration of God to speak by Vision then he got with baac and his rulers and said hey guys I know a way that y'all can still get to him God wouldn't let me say it under prophecy but here's my Doctrine here's my Doctrine now some of the Old Testament writers Josephus and some of the others say that actually what they taught them to do was that they had the women of Moab and they picked the most beautiful women that there were and they would set up like little booths and they would sell food and drink and things like that and then these women would start flirting with the sons of Israel now remember that was balam's Doctrine his prophecy was a star shall arise out of Jacob a scepter shall come out of Israel 100% accurate but it's Doctrine now having come through Pentecost as I did and some of you your families maybe did that was some of the things that bewildered me of course for years that I would see men call people out and tell them things and you've heard me share some of those things but yet see them do other things he say that can't be right that can't be right and then you'd hear them say prophecy of things a friend of mine was a song leader for AA Allen and a song leader for another man and he introduced this other man on the platform one night and a massive tent hundreds and hundreds of people there and whenever he turned the microphone over to this man and he come up on the platform and took it and he noticed the man was kind of Staggering and he smelt alcohol on the breasts of this famous preacher now this particular night was going to be a night he was really going to push for money and take an offering so whenever he would do that he had certain shoes that he would wear those shoes would have a hole in the bottom of them and he would have cardboard in the bottom of the shoe when he was preaching he'd throw his shoe up like that so you could see his shoe he would wear a suit that would have worn spots and holes in it and things like that and he would Point them out so you'd be able to see him so when when he would lift an offering you'd feel so sorry for him not knowing he was filthy rich so he gets up and on the platform and he's he's almost drunk can't hardly even walk takes the microphone talks a little bit and he said now it's time for God to vindicate his servant so there was a little girl there sitting up front he could see her crippled she had one leg that was 2 inches shorter than another one so he made the challenge had the mother of the do the daughter to bring the little girl up this friend of mine stood right there and watched it he said he was always Reverend he'd always bow his head but he said he thought no no I'm going to watch this there's no way God is going to heal this child this man is nearly drunk and can't hardly walk he said brother Donnie told me this with tears in his eyes he said I stood right there and watched that baby's leg grow out to the exact same length as the other one of course the tent went wild then afterwards he lifted his offering of course you can imagine this brother so perplexed he' heard about brother brandham but he didn't really understand the message so he goes into a motel room this friend of mine checks himself in just going to stay and fast and and seek God gets down on his knees beside the bed and this was his prayer oh God if there is a God God have mercy on me help me what is truth this can't be right Lord and the spirit of God come into the room where he was and begin to tell him I sent a message in the last day I have sent a prophet called his name thank God for Mercy now notice balum understood enough about God to know that he wanted to curse these people but God wouldn't let him by prophecy so he said but there's another way if we can get them to compromise their self by their free moral agency and if they will do wrong they will cause God himself to turn against them and baac said wow this is what I wanted all along what do I do tell me what do I do cause these sons of Israel to begin to commit adultery with these moish women this is balam's Doctrine now you understand what was happening here in the church age was that some of the people of that church age were committing spiritual adultery with the churches and the doctrines and the beliefs and so on around them still recognized as the doctrine of bam hope you understand it the doctrine of balum is still alive today now watch this Doctrine will be displayed in Numbers chapter 25 and Israel Abode in chatim and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab isn't it amazing that when Moses writes about this historically that he doesn't say it was through the teaching of the doctrine of balum so a man stands there and gets prophecy that is so perfect part of it's still coming to pass to this day but yet could teach things so damnable you understand how many people lost their lives because of this had there not been a priest that was faithful to God that would run and take a javelin and Pierce through the bodies of these people it's amazing because the blessing of God kept false prophecy away from them a man that looked at him and said I hate him a king looked at him and said I hate him and God said you ain't doing it I will not let you do it and Satan whispered to him hey make God do it himself that's what I did in the Garden of Eden I wanted the earth I wanted the paradise I tried to figure out a way to do it I couldn't get through to Adam I couldn't do it you know what I done I took his love for Eve and I twisted it right around against him I'm the one I made God do it I calls God out of his righteousness I talked even to doing it don't you know understand young people that's exactly the same thing the devil will try to do to us he'll try to get us disobedient to the word and cause the blessing of the Lord to leave our life why because we have this sacred special place with God and God cannot bless us in our sins oh my that's another subject oh my goodness watch so they begin to commit whoredoms now with the daughters of Moab and they called The People Under The sacrifices of their God so they worshiped Kos they worshiped all kinds of gods and many of the Canaanite religions they actually their idolatry was mixed in with sex acts so whenever they go to worship that actually have sex with a priestess or a priest at the temple it was Associated don't that turn look at me big eyed you'd be surprised how much it's still tied in around the church sex related stuff oh we're still bride we're still human beings but this is something we always have to watch praise the Lord so then what did they do they call the people under the sacrifices of their gods here goes them people that had received this wonderful word directly from God through this gift and through his teaching I'm emphasizing this for a reason listen to me separate his Doctrine from his prophecy and Israel joined himself into B peor and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel and we think it's terrible to have the devil mad at us that ain't nothing compared to God being mad at us chapter 31:1 16 behold these cause the children of Israel through the Council of balum to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of peor and there was a plague among them oh my the congregation of the Lord so a plague from God struck the congregation of the Lord why listening to the wrong Doctrine oh my goodness taking them now tempting them to take the women of Moab to defile themselves from the laws of Separation that God said don't marry them don't do this now don't do it do you understand that same thing applies to us today that Satan is constantly trying to get us to merge either by things we do things we say things we watch or or getting around the wrong people and get us to break our vows of Separation sure love the people of the world love people that totally disagree with you but don't defile Yourself by trying to be so friendly and win them to the messeng or win them to the Lord that actually I've seen it happen over and over again the people with good intention oh I'm trying to witness to them I'm trying to witness to them and what do they do sew a great big basket full of of questions in the mind of that young person or a man or woman or whatever it is well have you ever thought about this hey have you looked at this hey have you checked that out have you questioned that have you looked at that and that person which went there to help them walks away with this great big mess in their head of questions about this that and the other why because flirting with the daughter of Moab oh my may God help us hey friends I'm not telling you just to do this this is what what I do as a preacher you see if I'm invited to go preach and I have I went and preached in seven Thunder meetings I went and preached in different meetings I didn't a bit more griev some people than nothing in the world and some of my brothers had criticize me for doing it by saying you know what I'm going to pray about if I feel let of the Lord to go I'm going to go because maybe God wants a witness there but if they approach me with their Doctrine I'm going to draw that line say hey pal I'm here to preach I'm not here to discuss this you and I disagree on this I don't want my vows of separation to the purity of this word to be defiled under the opes of kindness well I'm trying to reach out to this brother you know he's often air here but I'm trying no and I've done it before I've done it to where I'd go but I never do it unless I feel L the Lord and I've seen by God's grace some of those people I went to come out of that mess that they come to so thank God for that now watch behold these cause the children of Israel through the Council of balum to commit trespass against the Lord so what are they basically doing it's so simple get so profound defy the laws of Separation be friendly love show people Jesus but don't you start forfeiting what you believe don't lay your precious sacred things that God's given you on the altar of kindness and make it transitory that well you know now brother let me just tell you this and share this with you now I've got some questions now you understand what you're doing you're laying your sacredness your separation upon the altar sacrificing it for the element of peace and mutual understanding that's what they did now watch oh my now these are some of the things I want to ask you so did brother brandham teach us as his followers to commit adultery now let's judge our Prophet messenger okay testing one two this microphone's going out again testing one two I can hear myself but apparently y'all can't hear me weird did brother brandham teach us to commit adultery with the daughters of Moab what did Brother Brenham teach us to lie answer me please no no what about cheat to be dishonest what about killing people really okay what about live just any kind of Life do whatever you want to do but just believe God s prop did he teach us that did he teach us to drink the drinking was okay doping committing adultery fornication steal no now I want to ask you this do I teach you any of the above no do I teach you that it's okay to live however you want to live now how are we going to know the difference between a man that will give prophecies and his Doctrine be totally wrong we check him by the word I said brother dnie how do we know brother renham wasn't a Baum it's easy check his Doctrine it's easy to see what bam done oh it don't matter we're all the same we're all the same Catholics are going in the Rapture and the Baptists are going in the rapture we really don't need the message to do all that you understand what they're doing they're offering their sacrifice of Separation upon the altar of compromise and saying well just well if that is so then there was no need for elaser to go all the way down there and be able to bring Rebecca back so God breaks his own type of Genesis 241 God should have just sent a big big text down there a big email and said anybody and everybody can go you don't have to listen to the message you don't have to say what the messenger said you don't have to pour the water out to the camels that's not even necessary just go ahead and do whatever you want to do just believe what you want to believe and live any way you want to live it's perfectly fine we're all going to heaven anyway no we're not and we share ain't all going in the rapture we all come by God's way or we don't go I heard a statement not long ago that Billy Graham had made and that Joel ostein and some of the these modern day preachers say that we're all going to heaven the pope said it just a few weeks ago three weeks ago the great Pope had said that Muslim Hindu Shinu all these things are all just different paths that lead us to the same place and I saw that and I thought I can agree with that but I'm not on that path probably you oh it's leading you all to the same place but you know what not in't my place Jesus never said I'm one of the ways but I am the way he didn't say I'm one of the truths I am the truth and no man can come to the father but by me but don't you see what it is the separation of the Bride is being offered on the sacrifice of compromise and so-called love oh brother Donnie we can't keep preaching this way we won't have nobody when we're done yes we will it ain't up to me to count the people it ain't up to me to fill up our church it's up to me to tell the truth and then God will get who he wants here we be the light let our light shine is that right am now watch let's move over can few more minutes before we close let's move over in the New Testament now and look at the realm of trance in the New Testament and it's Simon Peter and he became very hungry and would have eaten but while they made ready he fell into a trance so Peter's in a certain spot you never remember the the revelation of the Gentiles had not yet come into view so Peter was upon the Housetop and he he got really hungry and would have eaten and while they was fixing supper whatever it was he fell into a trance so again his eyes is wide open and it came to pass that when I was com again to Jerusalem Acts 22:17 while I prayed in the temple I was in a trance now again not Peter but another servant of God the New Testament so does God still have the means of trance in the New Testament this is your new testament look at what the word trance means amazement astonishment a throwing of the mind out of its normal State being transported as it were out of himself though that in this wrapped look at how that's spelled r a p t which is the short form of rapture in this wrapped condition although he is awake his mind is drawn off from all surrounding objects and wholly fixed on things Divine now you see God knew in the last days there'd be so many interpretations of the Bible that we once again would need a return into this phenomenal Avenue now brother Rob and I was talking about it before we came over the Old Testament prophets we don't have near as much view of their life as what we had of brother Brandon we see Paul that we see his conversion then he disappears for three and a half years or so goes to Arabia when he comes back M right in all these great Epistles silent years of Paul's life we don't know hardly anything about the New Testament prophets what they did and all of that same of the Old Testament prophets God would give them a word they would stomp out of the Wilderness give that word from God stomp right back in the wilderness but in this day we have something unique something different so we have a man that is called by God to be a prophet but he doesn't start out like Paul did he doesn't start out like Ezekiel that he just runs right out the word of the Lord came unto me son of man saying and I saw the spirit of God on the river chear that's not the way it starts s and his first commission that God gave him was do the work of an evangelist so he starts praying for the sick going out preaching and he starts out with limited now please hear me he starts out with limited Revelation and understanding he doesn't start out with an opening of the seals in his first part phase of his ministry he starts out in the Baptist Church right well that don't bother me it shows me God's grace well he starts out believing this and this and this and there's things that God updated his understanding on he tells us that himself he used to believe the Virgin birth was one thing and he also used to believe that you know all kinds of things about diseases that were contagious and could be spread with all kinds of things in the message that's there and that's what's in the message but what do we see for our first time we get to see a servant of God grow from what he was to more understanding more understanding more understanding I'm glad myself I grew that same way and you all are going to grow the same way but now listen what we have the message which was first recorded in 1947 which is amazing to me because the very first quote in the message message faith is the substance 1947 is now the brothers have got some new gadgets now for recording that's the very first quote in the recorded message so what do we have well we have a man that started out and he had what was Revelation to him in 47 was Revelation in 65 but what was his understanding about certain things in 47 might have changed in 62 or 61 now I know I get hated I get persecuted I get run down people have said I blasphemed the Holy Ghost and everything else for saying such things as I said but look when I come to this message years ago I made up my mind I'm going to study it and I'm going to find out what he said so I'm not talking about me saying that he changed I'm not talking about comparing what he said to what I think I'm talking about comparing what he said to what he said and if he says I had this wrong then I'm going to be man enough to stand up and tell you he said that cuz you know what you're going to find it anyway if you listen to it so I want you to have the answer to the devil's question If he tries to put a doubt in your mind praise the Lord what what is that smell I'm smelling oh it's a devil's side I've smell that before Hallelujah I'm not afraid of those quotes are you all are you all afraid to read something where brother renham said I had that wrong for Years brother Brenham read the scripture in the Book of Revelation of the White Horse riter and he used that as his text to preach the sermon the mighty conqueror 1957 up through 60 or whatever it was over and over again and he identified that white horse rider as the Lord Jesus until the Seven Seals opened up and then you know what he realized it wasn't the Lord Jesus at all it was the devil can you imagine brother Malachi how he must have felt when he thought oh my Lord what have I done I've called the devil the Lord Jesus but that's what I love about his honesty and being able to stand up and say I was wrong and he says on the first seal I was going to make a horrible mistake you know what that horrible mistake was he had pulled out old notes of what he had preached in Revelation in the church ages and the 10 virgins and several many other places preaching that that white horse rider was the Lord Jesus and all of a sudden the word of God come open to him what was it young people a channel on the earth that had the ability of open vision and he looks by vision and he sees it's not Jesus it's the an Christ you imagine when he was standing there preaching maybe I'm thinking it's in waterl that might not have been where it was but he preaching he was talking about Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden brother Jonathon and he said he he tells the people that night the next night after the service you can hear it in that night he sees it and he sees a vision and he actually saw in the Garden of Eden and he saw Adam and Eve walk out of the Garden of Eden and some great phenomenal thing happened there in that service and he'd come back to light the next service and he said he like to never got over that anointing because God let actually allowed him to see in the Garden of Eden what that sin was and he saw Adam and Eve walk out of that Garden of Eden don't you understand the word of the Lord in that way was lost to us we had no way of seeing it we could still read the Bible we'd still be trinitarians no telling where I'd be tonight no doubt still preaching cuz I love the Lord when I was in Pentecost but I still be messed up in my Doctrine my understanding of the godhead would still be wrong I'd still be so wrong in so many things but thank God for a man that had the gift from God to bring open vision and teach us what to live like Devils teach us to hate everybody that don't agree with us that's not what we believe and you'll notice these defectors when they leave the message what do they do they're doing the exact same thing baac wanted B them to do look at their backside tell all this false and tell this and tell that why don't you tell the good things that happen Among Us you lying Devils well praise the Lord come on tell that oh sure they say well I'll tell you one thing I heard so and so done this yeah but you'd like for us to unveil some of your trash I know some things about some of these people that have left the message I know some things about some of those that have left our church too I could ru Jo them in five minutes time but you see I'm not a trash Mouse and that's not what this message teaches me to do it teaches me to love them and pray for them and feel sorry for them everybody stand praise the Lord how many he appreciates the prophecy of the message of the last days how many also appreciates the doctrine of how it tells us how to live what to do does it tell us to hate our enemies of course not does it tell us to be able to reveal secrets about them now let me tell you something as a pastor there's lots of things I know about lots of people including preachers who's been at our church uhhuh I could tell some things about some of the preachers that I know of too but you know what I'm not here to do that I'm here to love him pray for him and what do I get that I get it first of all because I'm born again from the spirit of God that's the way my master taught me now this is one thing you want to ask yourself and people try to come to you and pull you away from the word or put questions in your mind this is what I asked them so how long has it been since your wife thought you were literally Jesus do people who traveled with you deacons in your church people in your church mistook you for the Lord Jesus testing one two brothers we I check out this microphone have church that tells me something about the man of God of this age can you imagine some of his own family members thought he was the Lord Jesus now if there's anybody that knows us it's our families boy some of the things you you you young people could tell me about your mamas and daddies you can start one by one after church have any of you lately had a hard time distinguishing your daddy from Jesus what about your mama bless her heart and yet they want to tell you and they want to point out this and that and the other whenever we have a man with such a Ministry that many thought it was the Lord Jesus himself putting on another human Veil now we ridiculed and we know it's totally wrong to believe such a thing but think about what made them believe that because there was so much like him can you imagine you're fishing and he tells the brothers brothers let's leave here and we'll go around this bend over there and we'll do such and such and when we get there you will catch three I'll you'll catch five you'll catch this and we'll do this and they'll weigh this and measure this I've talked to men who had that to happen to them you see it's real easy for people to criticize and make up all these things because a lot of these eyewitnesses are gone yeah they do the same thing about our lord Jesus too and you imagine you're sitting there and they tell you you went to a doctor and you walked up three steps going up into your house you're from Chicago your house is 303 Mr so and so I see you you you picked up a glass yesterday afternoon as you was washing your dishes and you dropped the glass on the ground and you got a nervous Condition it's called by so and so and you say Lord have mercy Lord have mercy what in the world where'd that come from that's wonderful and great but once that happened what did he tell us how to live what was William brandom's Doctrine and when people tell you I've left the message I want to know what that means because in the message we believe your by the grace of God through faith so does that mean they've left that we believe you repent and you're baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's what the message people believe we believe in the coming of the lord we believe in angels we believe in demons we believe in Heaven We Believe In Hell pick up your amens we believe in all the good things of God and we rewarded by God so when people say they've left the message does that mean they've left all of that we believe every word in the Bible so does that mean when they say I've left the message so you mean they're leaving the Bible too well it's apparent some of them have because some of them that's left the message they got went back and got rebap tized back in titles again as a matter of fact some of the preachers that have stood used to stand in the message and preach the message are now infidels there's been one that sited our church and preached several years ago a younger man burned up the country for a while him and his wife was was way laid by somebody who didn't believe the message now they're total infidels agnostics my goodness oh young people hold to what you've got hold to what you've got and what does it teach them let me tell you one thing if I was looking for something else and I ain't for these people that's trying to convince to leave the message all I got to do is look at them and think are you kidding me you're the worst advertisement the devil could ever send my way I mean full of hate full of oh my goodness some of the people that I've dealt with that have left the message and they say they're free I think y free from morality free from Common Sense free from decency that ain't what I want that ain't what I want I want to be more like Jesus I want to be so much like him don't you young people and where do we get that at because that's what we are taught God bless you let's pray Lord Jesus I thank you tonight father for this time we could spend together I thank you Lord for helping me not to stop on this the last time we had these questions Lord sometimes I I guess it's just me I think Lord they they may be getting bored with maybe but help me that I can just follow you and I know it'll always be [Music] right Lord God I thank you for the prophecy of this last day I love the discernments I love hearing those things but Lord I also love hearing about how we ought to live I'm convinced that all these people that left the message never did really listen to that many tapes because they would they would know the man they're describing is not the man that's on them tapes if they have heard many of them a lot of them will resort to reading because reading will compliment more the intellect but father we thank you that we have the recorded voice so we can hear his Simplicity we can hear his sincerity we can hear him weep with we can hear him tell us about his failures Lord coming to this message here in just just a week or so oh Hallelujah it'll be my anniversary of preaching of my introducing the message in 1983 here I am 42 years in preaching it and Lord it didn't make me fall in love with brother Brandon it don't make me want to be like him and he's my goal but it made me love you more than ever before oh Jesus it's not just brother Brandon we want to see and we do but it's you we want to see it's you we're getting married to it's you that's going to sit on the throne it's you that saved us it's you that healed us it's you it's the love of our life thank you Father there was something about it when I first started hearing the tapes that mesmerized me it was the way he talked to you and the way he talked about you I actually learned how to pray in a more clear more uniform way after I come to the message cuz in Pentecost I have to be honest I was so afraid of you it was the ministers that I heard preached they instill that in me this Prophet didn't bring more fear to me but more love and I've never loved you more than I love you here tonight cuz Falling In Love With Jesus was the best thing I ever done and now Lord I say I want to be more in love with you than I've ever been oh we worship you tonight Jesus cleanse us father help us as we're reaching out to others and trying to witness to always find and know that delicate spot to where we do not compromise or sacrifice our truths our Separation on the altar of compromise oh we worship you Lord maybe always be ready to share of what you've done but always be so sharp we'll be wise as serpents harmless as doves Lord God we worship you father we bless your name tonight Lord there's enough here in this place tonight that where we know that you're here maybe some of these young people need touch in their body maybe in their Walk with You Lord would you come back this way Lord Jesus would you bring healing deliverance we worship you

allowed me to hear the one true voice and it's his voice it's he used brother Brandon brother Brandon was the voice behind the voice our prophet and I'm just thankful that God has allowed me to recognize that and this song Just really speaks to me in that cuz it's that voice that's been holding me this whole time it's always been there may not have answered it like I should most of the time
