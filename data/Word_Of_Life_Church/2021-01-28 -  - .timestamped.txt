[0:00] i'm just talking about the word says hey
[0:02] are we worried
[0:04] about what the world says are y'all tell
[0:06] me that you've lived this long
[0:07] and now we're gonna start pulling back
[0:09] on this and that and the other
[0:11] and we're scared of what the world says
[0:13] and the government says
[0:14] well i'm sorry i'm not i believe we're
[0:17] living in an
[0:18] hour when prophecy is coming to pass
[0:21] remember the prophet told us years and
[0:22] years ago
[0:23] and how his voice must have seemed so
[0:26] out of step was what can you imagine
[0:29] how that the people of that day must
[0:32] have heard brother branham say those
[0:34] things
[0:34] that women will be this and it's a
[0:36] women's world and women will do this and
[0:38] that and the other
[0:38] and they probably looked at him and said
[0:40] are you kidding are you
[0:42] out of your mind we women can't do this
[0:44] and we women can't do that they sure
[0:47] can't say it today
[0:48] and for the most part the women of this
[0:50] world do not want equal rights
[0:53] they want rights above men now you say
[0:55] what you want to say
[0:57] and so it with a lot of these other
[0:59] agendas
[1:00] they do not want equal rights they want
[1:02] above
[1:03] your rights now you can sit there and
[1:05] hold your peace if you want to but open
[1:07] your eyes
[1:08] and realize they're not wanting equal
[1:10] rights they're wanting
[1:12] rights where they will be able to shut
[1:14] us down
[1:15] if we oppose their rights that is not
[1:18] equal rights that is them
[1:20] having precedent rights and us shutting
[1:23] our mouths
[1:23] and holding our peace well you're
[1:26] looking at somebody tonight that's not
[1:28] going to hold his
[1:30] now you can be cowards if you wish to
[1:33] but i'm going to stand before my lord
[1:35] one day
[1:36] and when i stand before him i don't want
[1:38] him looking me in the face and
[1:40] say you yell a belly chicken
[1:44] now you might sit there and hide your
[1:46] car when you drive to church and say
[1:48] i'm hiding in the back parking lot and
[1:49] i'm parking where they can't see my
[1:51] license plate
[1:52] well i'll tell you one thing jesus is
[1:54] having a picture took of you doing that
[1:57] and it'll meet you at the day of
[1:58] judgment and you sat there and said well
[2:01] i
[2:01] ain't amen in them parts he also took
[2:03] your picture on that
[2:05] so if i was you if i was coming i'd say
[2:08] amen
[2:09] i let heaven know and i'd certainly that
[2:11] hell no
[2:12] i'm not afraid of the devil i don't
[2:14] believe in being foolish now friends
[2:16] but i believe it's going to come to a
[2:18] spot we're going to have to be
[2:19] identified
[2:20] with what we stand for i can tell you
[2:23] one thing when god put something on my
[2:25] heart to expose something about the
[2:27] devil
[2:27] i will fight all hell get into church i
[2:30] will fight all hell trying to time out
[2:32] time
[2:33] my time won't tie right my shirt won't
[2:35] button right my shoes won't do right
[2:38] this won't work that won't work that
[2:40] won't work my ipad won't work whether or
[2:42] not you know what i bring
[2:43] two identical pie pads to church every
[2:46] night when i go to france i take two
[2:48] when i go to germany i take two you say
[2:51] why do you take two a spur just in case
[2:53] the devil
[2:54] gets a hold of this in here that's
[2:57] exactly right why because he hates to be
[2:59] exposed
[3:00] shouldn't you wonder why when we come to
[3:03] the house of god
[3:04] we've got to fight hell you got to fight
[3:06] it to get here
[3:07] you've got to fight it to sit there and
[3:09] hear the word you've got to fight and
[3:11] setting up with that old mask on your
[3:12] face
[3:13] to keep from going to sleep you got to
[3:15] fight it trying to get your breath why
[3:17] would somebody
[3:18] would at least blow your mouth out if
[3:20] you can't say in there
[3:21] just breathe so i know you're listening
[3:23] why because he knows the word of god
[3:26] is fixing to expose him that night and
[3:29] it will
[3:30] set you free from that affliction in
[3:33] your body
[3:33] or sets you free from that besetting sin
[3:37] so he'll try to occupy your mind he'll
[3:39] try to make you hot in the service
[3:41] and make you cold in the service or make
[3:43] your foot itch or your back itch or your
[3:46] toenails are hurting come on somebody
[3:48] why because he don't want you to hear
[3:51] what god's word has got to be
[3:53] he cannot stand to be exposed but we're
[3:56] here to expose his eye tonight
[4:00] [Applause]
