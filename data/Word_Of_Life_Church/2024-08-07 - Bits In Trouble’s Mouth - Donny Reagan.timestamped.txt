[35:40] remember when you graduated hit that
[35:42] next step and it's something we
[35:44] encourage you and forgive us as church
[35:48] leaders it's almost like parents for the
[35:49] mistakes that we made along the way but
[35:52] you will never find as the world maybe
[35:53] touches you and pushes you around a
[35:56] little bit that you have an anchor point
[35:57] in today and that the body of of God
[36:00] loves you through us and we will always
[36:04] no matter where life takes you and what
[36:05] happens know that you have a foundation

[36:09] love you unconditionally it doesn't
[36:11] matter what happens to you out there
[36:13] whatever it might be one of the biggest
[36:15] things that I've seen is their kids that
[36:17] they get they get sideways but when they
[36:20] come back what Joy there is in my heart
[36:22] knowing that child and I believe that's
[36:24] how God loves us through the body so we

[42:05] things that he's brought us through by
[42:08] his
[42:09] grace praise the Lord let's turn tonight
[42:11] if you would to the Book of Daniel
[42:13] chapter
[42:15] 7 verse
[42:17] 25 I'd like to make mention to you about
[42:21] the youth camp that our youth and um
[42:25] some of the others will be going up to
[42:27] Ohio for the meetings there this weekend
[42:30] leaving tomorrow early so we just ask
[42:33] that youd pray for them Lord be with
[42:35] them give them a a safe journey and also
[42:38] visit them in a special
[42:40] way we just believe in the Lord to heal
[42:44] the sick fill with the Holy Ghost Save
[42:46] The Lost just whatever that they have
[42:49] need of tonight I me knows that it's we
[42:53] it's a needy time in the day and age
[42:55] that we're living in
[42:58] Daniel is one of
[43:00] the most prophetic books of the Old
[43:03] Testament and symbols and also prophetic
[43:08] utterances Daniel spoke a great deal
[43:11] about the End Time chapter 7 verse
[43:15] 25 he's speaking about the Antichrist
[43:19] that'll come in the last day Anointed
[43:22] with the power of the
[43:23] Beast and he shall speak great words
[43:27] words against the most high I want you
[43:32] notice how that Daniel points out the
[43:35] things that will transpire under this
[43:39] administration of Satan and he shall
[43:42] speak great words against the most high
[43:46] and shall
[43:49] wear
[43:51] out the
[43:53] Saints of the most high
[43:58] so he will not be able to wear out the
[44:01] most
[44:02] high but what he will do is speak great
[44:05] words against
[44:07] him but he shall wear out the Saints of
[44:12] the most high look at this word
[44:16] wear Aramaic word which means to wear
[44:20] away wear
[44:22] out to
[44:25] harass constant
[44:28] ly can anybody say amen
[44:33] amen and shall wear out the Saints of
[44:37] the most high and think to
[44:41] change
[44:43] times and
[44:45] laws to change
[44:48] times and laws so it'll be laws of
[44:51] nature all kinds of laws that he will
[44:54] seek to
[44:55] change and they shall be given into his
[44:59] hand until a time and
[45:04] times and the
[45:06] dividing of time now the prerequisite of
[45:09] this is coming up to the part
[45:11] of blaspheming of course God and his
[45:15] great character and wearing out the
[45:17] Saints and then you go into the latter
[45:20] part of that and it will be given into
[45:22] his hand for a
[45:25] time and times
[45:28] and a half of time in other words three
[45:32] and a half
[45:35] years 1 Peter
[45:42] 4:12
[45:44] beloved think it not
[45:47] strange concerning the
[45:50] fiery
[45:52] trial which is to try
[45:55] you as though some strange thing
[45:59] happened unto you I want you notice
[46:03] Peter's words here that they are to try
[46:06] them not consume them or destroy them
[46:11] try
[46:13] them and to try their Graces the virtues
[46:18] that they've received by the grace of
[46:20] God it will try that but it will destroy
[46:25] the weaknesses around the their lives
[46:27] and give them opportunity to be able to
[46:30] prove the truth that it's actually in
[46:32] their soul in sincerity and
[46:36] constancy but rejoice in as much as you
[46:39] are
[46:40] partakers of Christ's
[46:44] sufferings you mean to be a child of God
[46:47] and what we go through for his sake we
[46:50] are actually
[46:52] suffering with the Lord
[46:55] Jesus what an honor that when his glory
[46:59] shall be
[47:01] revealed you may be glad also with
[47:06] exceeding
[47:08] Joy now let me read to you from a little
[47:11] Easter sermon and U this was a sunrise
[47:14] service in 417
[47:18] 1960 why does God let troubles
[47:24] come God harnesses
[47:28] trouble now listen what he
[47:30] does puts
[47:34] bits in its
[47:38] mouth puts bits in its mouth and makes
[47:44] it obey
[47:47] him and those troubles bring us closer
[47:52] into a closer
[47:54] fellowship with God can anybody say Amen
[47:58] to that
[47:59] amen so I want to speak to you tonight
[48:03] on
[48:04] bits in troubles
[48:08] mouth
[48:11] bits in troubles mouth not trouble
[48:15] plural but trouble as in
[48:19] possessive so God puts bits now for
[48:22] those of you that's rode horses been
[48:24] around horses you know that there's
[48:26] different types types of bits the
[48:27] Snapple bit the Hackamore there's broken
[48:30] bit straight bit there's all different
[48:32] types of bits what's it all for to
[48:36] control you got a horse that has very
[48:38] very sensitive mouths they might use a
[48:42] hackamore or a hybrid a hackamore is
[48:46] that which goes across his nose doesn't
[48:49] actually go just in his mouth alone and
[48:51] whenever you need to stop him it will
[48:54] actually push pressure down on his nose
[48:56] and it affects his breathing doesn't
[48:58] take him very long to yield to it if
[49:02] it's a snaffle bit it'll be a little bit
[49:04] different I've had several different
[49:06] types of horses and each one of them was
[49:08] a little bit more comfortable with a
[49:10] particular bit that they were used to so
[49:14] God puts a
[49:16] bit into trouble's
[49:20] mouth then you know what he does he sets
[49:24] you on top of Tru trouble oh my so you
[49:29] put your foot in trouble's
[49:33] sterup and then you throw your leg
[49:37] across troubles
[49:40] back and then you hang on for everything
[49:45] you've
[49:48] got let's pray
[49:52] together Lord
[49:55] Jesus I pray that you would speak to our
[49:59] hearts tonight
[50:00] father we've gathered here once again
[50:02] Lord that we might be benefited and we
[50:05] already have been to sing and to worship
[50:07] and your prayer request and Lord we're
[50:11] made known of different needs and we're
[50:14] believing you father that you'll be
[50:15] mindful of every one of them Lord
[50:18] tonight now Jesus we come to the
[50:21] preaching part and I'm asking you that
[50:24] you just help me Lord
[50:27] apparently there's there's needs among
[50:31] the
[50:32] people because I thought I was ready for
[50:34] tonight but yesterday you started
[50:38] dealing with me in a different direction
[50:40] and today I had to take several hours to
[50:44] try to get ready for this tonight so I'm
[50:48] looking forward to what you've got to
[50:50] say so I pray that you would speak to
[50:53] our hearts anoint me Lord anoint the
[50:56] people that we can be benefited by our
[50:59] gathering together we ask in the name of
[51:02] Jesus and the saint said amen amen God
[51:07] bless you you may be
[51:15] seated so
[51:18] God puts a
[51:20] bit in
[51:22] trouble's
[51:24] mouth trouble as possess now not
[51:28] plural and then
[51:31] God puts trouble allows
[51:34] trouble to get in our
[51:38] life and what do we do with a
[51:41] horse we ride it we hook it to a buggy
[51:46] we hook it to a cart we hook it to a
[51:50] wagon But whichever that we do it's a
[51:54] means of transportation
[51:57] and it gives us
[52:00] control now as I said I've owned in the
[52:03] past different types of horses Quarter
[52:07] Horses uh tisy Walking Horse
[52:11] Arabians um just different types of
[52:14] horses and their breed and their nature
[52:19] you know you might take one Bridal and
[52:21] use it on one particular one and then
[52:24] put that same one on another one and oh
[52:26] here he'll spit and he'll take his
[52:28] tongue and push against that thing
[52:30] because it's an object that does not
[52:33] belong in his mouth so you can imagine
[52:37] you're you're running around with this
[52:38] piece of Cold Steel in between your
[52:41] teeth and and your tongue is right on
[52:44] the top of it and you're hitting it and
[52:47] it depends on whoever it is on your back
[52:50] and how they know whether or not how to
[52:53] ride you and what to do with that and
[52:55] they can really make it tough on your
[52:59] mouth and depending on what you have
[53:02] been bred to do and what you have done I
[53:06] owned a barrel racing horse one time and
[53:10] for barrel racing you want one that is
[53:14] very very sensitive and he wants needs
[53:17] to be trained to where you won't have to
[53:20] jerk him and basically you just take
[53:23] that rain and it's it's so sensitive you
[53:27] lay it right against their neck so if
[53:30] you want to go left you simply lay the
[53:32] rain on the right part of his neck you
[53:35] don't have to pull him you don't have to
[53:37] jerk him just lay it just like that
[53:39] that's it's amazing because you're
[53:41] laying it on the right side of his neck
[53:43] but he knows that means you want to go
[53:46] left so the other way it's exact
[53:49] opposite and I had one Andale was his
[53:52] name and you could spin him in circles
[53:55] you could just go around and around in
[53:57] circles and just by touching as long as
[53:59] you had that rain on his neck he would
[54:01] go around and around and around didn't
[54:04] take the two or three times for me cuz
[54:05] I'm kind of wooy headed anyway but he
[54:08] could go and go and go he was so broke
[54:12] with that so he would be able to just
[54:15] move back and forth and back and forth
[54:17] but one of the first ones that I had his
[54:20] name was
[54:24] Charlie and Charlie wasn't very big he
[54:26] was about like that I used to teach
[54:28] teach brother Charlie terz actually and
[54:31] tell him that I had a horse that sort of
[54:33] reminded me of brother
[54:36] Charlie and there was something about
[54:39] Charlie whenever W brothers would go up
[54:41] in the mountains and would go to riding
[54:43] and uh it was strip mine roads that was
[54:46] in the mountains are in Kentucky where I
[54:48] lived and we would ride for hours and
[54:50] hours tremendous place to ride and
[54:53] whenever you'd get Charlie to going
[54:55] there was something about him he just a
[54:58] weird horse whenever you'd get to
[55:01] running he'd go to kicking his back legs
[55:05] so instead of running and Galloping he'd
[55:09] run with his front feet and kick with
[55:12] his back feet I've had a few church
[55:14] people like that it just seemed like
[55:17] they can never get in stride it's like
[55:20] part of them wants to run and part of
[55:22] them wants to kick and poor old Charlie
[55:24] he never did know EX exactly what to do
[55:27] I never got that horse broke from that
[55:31] I'm hoping I won't have to say the same
[55:33] thing about some of our church
[55:36] people but you know when we look at this
[55:40] setting we look at a very strange thing
[55:43] because always whenever I would saddle
[55:46] whichever horse it was that I had and I
[55:50] had a Tennessee Walking Horse and I
[55:51] lived out at gray I brought him here
[55:54] from Kentucky and I I didn't have to
[55:56] used his bit very much at all he'd been
[56:00] trained to voice command so whenever he
[56:03] was jet black had a little bit of white
[56:05] on two feet and whenever I would get on
[56:08] his back and I would settle saddle him
[56:10] up and I would start going down frog
[56:13] level Road there where we lived in graay
[56:17] and I would speak to him and I would say
[56:21] rack
[56:23] Smokey and he would start racking like a
[56:26] Tennessee Walking Horse I would say
[56:29] cancer he would break that I mean I
[56:31] voice command now every now and then I
[56:35] would still have to kind of pull on him
[56:36] a little bit and remind him who the boss
[56:40] was but one of the last ones that I had
[56:43] was a Polish Arabian the most gentle one
[56:47] I ever had like a dog follow you around
[56:49] on the field just pest aggravates you to
[56:52] death if you wouldn't speaking to him
[56:55] loving on him he couldn't understand it
[56:56] just absolutely you know what the more
[56:59] I'm preaching about these horses the
[57:00] more I realize we got people here in the
[57:02] church like
[57:06] that but all the horses that I own for
[57:10] the most part I enjoyed them and that
[57:14] was for an element of
[57:17] pleasure so why would
[57:20] God get this
[57:23] power and put a a big it in its
[57:28] mouth and set you and you and you and
[57:33] me on this power called
[57:38] trouble and it's not for our pleasure at
[57:43] all it's not for
[57:46] fun as a matter of fact I get scared
[57:51] sometimes when I'm on trouble
[57:56] trouble can bring fear
[57:59] out of the best of
[58:05] us and trouble is so
[58:08] hardheaded trouble is so
[58:12] stubborn and trouble is
[58:16] dangerous and trouble has this about it
[58:21] that it's like we never
[58:24] fully understand it
[58:26] no matter how many years that you are
[58:29] put upon
[58:31] trouble it's like each
[58:34] time is a little bit different than the
[58:38] other and about the time you think you
[58:41] understand
[58:43] it the next time you're on it it will
[58:46] display something that you never knew
[58:51] before I realize that as Christians and
[58:54] as believing children of God we don't
[58:56] don't ask God for the easy way we don't
[58:59] ask God to make us free from trouble we
[59:02] don't ask God to make us on a flowery
[59:04] bed of ease while those before us have
[59:07] suffered tremendously I would be ashamed
[59:10] to ask God for that would
[59:12] you but yet I'm not saying either that I
[59:15] want God to saddle trouble for me every
[59:18] day I don't know about you I enjoy
[59:22] trouble free
[59:24] days it seems like the older I get and
[59:27] the more that I'm on this Earth it seems
[59:30] like the less trouble-free days that I
[59:33] have anybody know what I'm talking about
[59:35] and it's it's not just me of course but
[59:37] it seems like so many people that you
[59:39] talk to are dealing with so many things
[59:43] let's read Galatians
[59:45] 6:7 be not deceived God is Not mocked
[59:49] for whatsoever a man Seth that shall he
[59:53] also reap for he that Seth to the flesh
[59:56] flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption
[59:59] but he that Seth to the spirit shall of
[1:00:02] the spirit reap life
[1:00:05] Everlasting let us not be
[1:00:08] weary in welld doing
[1:00:12] weary and well-doing again look at the
[1:00:15] meaning of weary faint to be
[1:00:19] utterly
[1:00:22] spiritless to be
[1:00:24] utterly spirit
[1:00:26] less to be wearied
[1:00:30] out or
[1:00:34] exhausted
[1:00:37] exhausted by what riding
[1:00:42] trouble and the problem is we're trying
[1:00:45] to get
[1:00:47] off and we're trying our best to use the
[1:00:51] bits but what we found out is we don't
[1:00:54] always have control control of trouble
[1:00:58] every now and then the Lord will let us
[1:01:01] have the Reigns
[1:01:03] ourself but a lot of times we don't have
[1:01:06] no control of
[1:01:08] trouble he's actually the one that's
[1:01:11] controlling it and we're on this
[1:01:15] thing and we're leaning to the left and
[1:01:18] leaning to the right and we're whoa whoa
[1:01:21] whoa slow down no no I don't want that
[1:01:24] don't go that way stop I said
[1:01:27] stop and it's like trouble pays no
[1:01:29] attention to us at
[1:01:33] all as a matter of fact it seems like
[1:01:35] the more we holler the louder he gets
[1:01:38] and the more he bucks and if you could
[1:01:40] see your live tonight some of you it
[1:01:43] would be like you're having your own
[1:01:45] spiritual
[1:01:48] rodeo and they open the gate and they
[1:01:50] let you out and you've got oh my
[1:01:53] whatever the wildest bucking Bron on the
[1:01:56] circuit rodeo and you're right on that
[1:01:59] thing and you're not even really a
[1:02:01] professional rodeo star and you're
[1:02:05] flinging and you're going back and forth
[1:02:07] and you don't think lord I can't hang on
[1:02:10] here another second it seem like every
[1:02:12] way I'm turning my husband is sick and
[1:02:16] I'm sick and our kids are sick Lord
[1:02:19] we're struggling with this and we're
[1:02:20] struggling with that God Don't You Love
[1:02:23] Me
[1:02:26] yeah actually he saddled trouble for you
[1:02:29] which is a proof of his
[1:02:32] love you see if you were a baby he would
[1:02:36] have actually saddled one of those many
[1:02:42] horses and you just walked right over
[1:02:44] the top of him so you know if it gets a
[1:02:47] little bit rough on one of them mini
[1:02:49] guys you just stand up and he just goes
[1:02:52] right out from under
[1:02:53] you and really a lot of of us that's
[1:02:56] what we would prefer that our battles
[1:02:58] would be Min style
[1:03:02] oh we grab up and grab a hold of its
[1:03:04] little ears I'll tell you some of the
[1:03:06] meanest ones I ever had was chatlin
[1:03:09] ponies they'd bite you they'd stomp you
[1:03:12] they'd kick you that's right just
[1:03:15] something about the nature of them and
[1:03:17] we all oh I didn't mind them so bad
[1:03:20] because if they was sure enough I've
[1:03:22] stood up a few times and let them just
[1:03:24] keep on going but you feel safer but it
[1:03:27] seemed like the more you grow in God and
[1:03:30] the more you go the bigger trouble
[1:03:33] gets now you know used to trouble was
[1:03:36] about 14 Hands High that's not such a
[1:03:39] bad fault at all really 14 Hands and
[1:03:42] then trouble got to where he was
[1:03:45] 15 and then he got to be thorough breed
[1:03:48] size 17
[1:03:50] to and now he's on steroids so he's
[1:03:55] about 20 one hands high and you're
[1:03:58] trying trying trying and you're up on
[1:04:00] top of him and you got to get a a ladder
[1:04:03] to get up there much less to get
[1:04:06] off and the higher you get you know I've
[1:04:10] rode many of them and they they want to
[1:04:12] rare up with you and I had won one time
[1:04:14] and man and Harry's younger brother
[1:04:16] Jamie he he was a pretty he was a pretty
[1:04:19] fired up horse and animals can tell if
[1:04:22] you're afraid of them or not so Jamie
[1:04:24] wanted to ride this one and Jamie was
[1:04:26] young of course and and as soon as Jamie
[1:04:29] come out to the barn where hairy head
[1:04:32] and I mean he said I I want to run him
[1:04:34] all right all right you know he's kind
[1:04:35] of kind of kind of fiery oh it's that's
[1:04:37] okay as soon as Jamie got on that horse
[1:04:40] that horse took off I mean like a buck
[1:04:43] and Bron he had never done that with me
[1:04:45] but he sensed Jamie Shan's
[1:04:49] fear animals do that you know it's the
[1:04:53] same with trouble
[1:04:56] and when God will put this bits in its
[1:04:59] mouth and we get up on its back and our
[1:05:03] fear goes to pulsating out of our
[1:05:06] being and trouble senses it Rob is
[1:05:10] scared to
[1:05:12] death how many's ever had that happen to
[1:05:15] you maybe not with a horse but with a
[1:05:17] dog believe me listen Scotty is got a
[1:05:20] dog in near in their neighborhood there
[1:05:22] that dog was was abused by a man
[1:05:26] that dog has bit UPS FedEx USPS I don't
[1:05:31] know how many people it's bit but
[1:05:33] whenever I come into their driveway that
[1:05:36] dog will that dog will bark but I'll
[1:05:39] stand right there and look at it and say
[1:05:42] rain laid
[1:05:44] down you know what rain
[1:05:47] does rain goes behind the cloud rain
[1:05:51] backs off you know why rain knows I'm
[1:05:54] not afraid
[1:05:56] the prophet told us when we are afraid
[1:05:59] they can smell
[1:06:01] it do you understand your body puts out
[1:06:05] this and they can smell
[1:06:08] it I want to be the type of Christian
[1:06:10] that when God Saddles up trouble for me
[1:06:14] and hands me the rins and leads me to
[1:06:17] believe I'm in
[1:06:20] charge and I climb up on top of this 22
[1:06:23] Hand high trouble that I want to stand
[1:06:26] up here like a real man anybody in here
[1:06:29] with me tonight I don't want to stand
[1:06:31] and Shake in my boots literally as we
[1:06:34] would say but if God has chosen out this
[1:06:39] particular one for me now I got to tell
[1:06:42] you that I I've seen a few rodeos and
[1:06:45] I'm not no Cowboy by no means I ain't
[1:06:48] got no desire to be and I've never
[1:06:51] understood why anybody would want to
[1:06:53] climb up on the back of a Herford Bull
[1:06:57] and ride that bull around a pen I mean I
[1:06:59] have no desire whatsoever to do such or
[1:07:03] a buck and BR but when you look at what
[1:07:06] we are called to do God Almighty knows
[1:07:10] he has a people that he can allow to be
[1:07:14] tested and tried like no other and the
[1:07:18] church
[1:07:19] said now you see he himself experiened
[1:07:23] things in the way that we do Carol and I
[1:07:26] heard this this sermon today in perfect
[1:07:28] faith if you haven't heard it be good
[1:07:30] for you to listen to it the prophet is
[1:07:32] speaking about Jesus he said when he
[1:07:34] raised up that boy that Widow son from
[1:07:38] na I believe in the prince of House of
[1:07:40] David he sat on a rock and groaned with
[1:07:44] a headache he bore our infir infirmity
[1:07:48] bear means to pack them he bore it he
[1:07:53] had all things like we had
[1:07:56] he had sickness he had
[1:08:00] Temptations He had
[1:08:02] trouble he had
[1:08:05] frustration how many ever gets flustered
[1:08:08] with people with life with family
[1:08:11] members with church people Jesus got
[1:08:15] flustered I guarantee you all all of it
[1:08:19] was not with the Pharisees either no
[1:08:22] doubt he got flustered with Peter and
[1:08:24] John and the disciples those that said
[1:08:28] they loved him no doubt he did and what
[1:08:30] did Spirit God do Spirit God saddled
[1:08:35] trouble and put the Lord Jesus on
[1:08:39] trouble and he had to ride trouble to
[1:08:43] the Cross but it didn't stop there he
[1:08:46] rode him down to
[1:08:50] Hell
[1:08:52] amen
[1:08:54] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:08:56] hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus why
[1:08:59] because God put bits in trouble's
[1:09:05] mouth and trouble simply
[1:09:08] transported Our Savior now let me remind
[1:09:11] you all of us love Psalm 23 The Lord is
[1:09:16] my shepherd I shall not want he maketh
[1:09:19] me to lie down in green pastors on and
[1:09:21] on and on David wrote but I will remind
[1:09:25] you before there could be a Psalm 23
[1:09:28] numerically there must be a Psalm 22 my
[1:09:32] God my God why hast Thou forsaken me all
[1:09:36] my bones they stare at me they Pooch
[1:09:39] their lip out at me you know the Bulls
[1:09:42] of Bashan are against me a Psalm 22 is
[1:09:46] what led in to Psalm
[1:09:49] 23 and you understand what God did he
[1:09:52] put the bits in trouble's mouth and let
[1:09:56] the Lord Jesus conquer deaths hell and
[1:10:00] the grave and if we as the people of God
[1:10:03] are going to be Overcomers and set with
[1:10:05] him and his throne then I guarantee you
[1:10:08] there's going to be many a ride that

[1:10:37] and that's one of the reasons they want
[1:10:38] to go to heaven I don't want to go to
[1:10:40] heaven because I'm sick of life I want
[1:10:43] to go to heaven because I love him more

[1:15:27] Temptations anybody beside me need help
[1:15:30] with this scripture
[1:15:31] tonight counted all joy when you fall
[1:15:35] into diverse Temptations knowing this
[1:15:39] that the trying of your faith work us
[1:15:44] notice the trying of your faith does not
[1:15:47] make
[1:15:49] patience but it works patience it works
[1:15:54] it
[1:15:55] worketh patience look at what the word
[1:15:57] patience means patient patient
[1:16:00] continuance patient waiting
[1:16:03] steadfastness constancy endurance in the
[1:16:07] New Testament the characteristic of a
[1:16:09] man who is not swerved from his
[1:16:12] deliberate purpose and his loyalty to
[1:16:16] Faith and piety by even the greatest
[1:16:21] trials and sufferings and the church
[1:16:24] said amen knowing this that the trying
[1:16:27] of your faith work as patient but let
[1:16:31] patience have notice the gender that
[1:16:34] James picked for describing it let
[1:16:38] patience have her perfect work perfect
[1:16:44] tellos lacking nothing not immature
[1:16:48] complete that's not the word faultless
[1:16:50] now but it is for grown and mature let
[1:16:55] patience have her perfect work that ye
[1:16:59] may be perfect and
[1:17:02] entire wanting
[1:17:05] nothing and how are you going to get
[1:17:08] that on the back of
[1:17:11] trouble let patience have her perfect
[1:17:14] work that ye may be perfect and entire
[1:17:18] oh my goodness wow wouldn't it be so
[1:17:21] much easier if it would have been
[1:17:22] blessings let blessings have her perfect
[1:17:25] work let shouting let jumping and oh how
[1:17:28] we love to do all that but yet God did
[1:17:31] not put bits in the
[1:17:34] mouth of
[1:17:37] shouting wow which one of us would not
[1:17:41] want to climb up this great
[1:17:44] Steed of
[1:17:46] shouting
[1:17:48] oh wow this beautiful magnificent thing
[1:17:53] of joy and blessing blessings and wealth
[1:17:57] and so happy that if you get any happier
[1:17:59] you're going to explode and so much joy
[1:18:02] you can't even hardly sit down I mean
[1:18:04] you said down you just you just got to
[1:18:06] get back up again cuz you're just
[1:18:08] happy you're on
[1:18:11] dope you're acting like a you're on
[1:18:15] something oh that's the horse we would
[1:18:18] all choose amen that's right true but
[1:18:22] God says hey you
[1:18:28] and when you get close to the pen there
[1:18:30] he is in the
[1:18:34] pen you say Lord have mercy that sounds
[1:18:36] like an African line oh Lord no Jesus no
[1:18:41] I I dra the wrong number there ain't no
[1:18:43] way Lord there ain't no way there's no
[1:18:46] way that I could you know I'm scared of
[1:18:47] loud noises you know I get nervous up
[1:18:51] all that bucking stuff no no no you
[1:18:52] you've got the wrong person you're Lord
[1:18:54] there's no no way that I could do this
[1:18:56] he
[1:18:57] said you can do more than you
[1:19:01] think come out of your
[1:19:04] sh you
[1:19:11] coward but Lord what if I get
[1:19:15] hurt what if I get hurt what if it
[1:19:19] didn't scare us too bad it could say
[1:19:21] that's what I'm hoping
[1:19:22] for I'm hoping you will
[1:19:25] I'm hoping your pride your arrogance
[1:19:27] your selfishness your
[1:19:32] self-centeredness oh my notice James
[1:19:36] goes on to say in verse 12 blessed is
[1:19:38] the
[1:19:39] man that endureth Temptation now this is
[1:19:42] a this can be a tricky word most people
[1:19:44] would take this word and think that it
[1:19:46] means you know you've been tempted to
[1:19:47] sin tempted to lie tempted of this but
[1:19:50] actually the word there that James used
[1:19:52] means this blessed is is the man that
[1:19:55] endures and the meaning is
[1:19:57] trial proving the trial of man's
[1:20:03] Fidelity
[1:20:04] Integrity virtue and constancy blessed
[1:20:09] is the man that endureth the trial in
[1:20:12] other words for when he is tried he
[1:20:16] shall receive the Crown of Life which
[1:20:20] the Lord hath promised to
[1:20:23] them that love of
[1:20:25] him oh my 1 Peter chap 1:6 wherein you
[1:20:29] greatly Rejoice don't now for a season
[1:20:33] if need be ye are in
[1:20:36] heaviness
[1:20:38] heaviness through
[1:20:40] manifold Temptations which is
[1:20:44] variegated which means many different
[1:20:47] aspects so it comes from this way and
[1:20:48] that way and that way and that way and
[1:20:50] that way so it comes in a
[1:20:52] manifold way that the trial of your
[1:20:56] faith being more precious than of gold
[1:21:00] that perisheth though it be tried with
[1:21:03] fire might be found unto praise and
[1:21:07] honor and Glory at the appearing of
[1:21:11] Jesus
[1:21:13] Christ and yet God would
[1:21:16] harness such a thing as trouble and test
[1:21:22] and
[1:21:23] trials and and put his children on the
[1:21:26] back of Danger on the back of something
[1:21:30] that could take their
[1:21:37] life and say I love
[1:21:43] you I love
[1:21:45] you I had a horse one time and my little
[1:21:48] young and
[1:21:50] Erica thought she wanted to ride that
[1:21:52] horse
[1:21:54] I knew she didn't know what she was
[1:21:56] talking
[1:21:57] about so I sat her on the back of that
[1:22:01] horse but I walked beside
[1:22:04] her and held her
[1:22:07] arm and she was a hard-headed stubborn
[1:22:09] little
[1:22:10] run so sometimes she had to be proven
[1:22:13] things and I kind of figured what this
[1:22:16] horse is going to do sure enough daddy
[1:22:18] let me have the rains let me have the
[1:22:19] rains she had to be in control you know
[1:22:23] so I'll let her have the rains
[1:22:25] but I had something more important I had
[1:22:28] her
[1:22:28] arm sure enough she got a hold of the
[1:22:32] Rings and that horse took off bucking
[1:22:36] raring whatever more but you know what
[1:22:39] happened her savior came in and grabbed
[1:22:43] a hold of her and pulled her off the
[1:22:46] back of trouble why it wasn't that Daddy
[1:22:51] would not have put her on that horse you
[1:22:54] see it's the same for you and I that we
[1:22:56] get into things sometimes
[1:22:58] ourself and God will warn us don't do
[1:23:01] this don't do that don't go there don't
[1:23:04] live this way don't do that way and
[1:23:06] we're standing right there and that
[1:23:08] horse
[1:23:09] is come on come on I dare
[1:23:14] you and you're saying oh I'm tougher
[1:23:17] than it Hallelujah I God throw that
[1:23:19] stair uper I can handle it I can handle
[1:23:21] it and the Lord says all right all right

[1:23:29] many of you Christians have done some
[1:23:31] stupid stuff in your life of course you

[1:23:36] like I was with my little girl oh boy I
[1:23:39] was so glad but you know what that
[1:23:41] wasn't half the story she was more glad
[1:23:43] than I was because I saved her life they
[1:23:46] don't tell what that horse would have
[1:23:48] done there ain't no telling what I would
[1:23:50] have got myself into in my life as a
[1:23:54] child of God if the Lord and his grace
[1:23:57] hadn't to grabbed a hold of me come on
[1:23:59] somebody can you imagine we would not
[1:24:02] have this message in this day had God
[1:24:05] not had a hold to his Prophet when he
[1:24:07] took his gloves off and laid his hands
[1:24:10] on them electrical wires and going to
[1:24:12] take his life and oh yeah he saddled up
[1:24:15] trouble he got on trouble's back and he
[1:24:17] was going to take his life cuz he
[1:24:19] thought he couldn't take it no more but
[1:24:21] thank God when we get to a spot that we
[1:24:24] think we can't take it no more we'll end
[1:24:26] it all the grace of God is still there
[1:24:30] with his hand on us said Oh no you're

[1:31:51] hour not only did they my my go to an
[1:31:55] ice Heap they went into a fiery furnace
[1:31:58] but Satan could not destroy them for
[1:32:02] God's purpose wasn't yet fulfilled Satan
[1:32:06] could not take them he could not drown
[1:32:09] Noah in the flood until the purpose of
[1:32:13] God had been finished he could not burn
[1:32:15] up the Hebrew children until the purpose
[1:32:19] of God had been finished oh I hear a
[1:32:21] song coming on he would not kill job
[1:32:25] with boils and troubles until the
[1:32:28] purpose of God had been finished neither
[1:32:31] could the lies eat Daniel until God's
[1:32:34] purpose had been finished oh praise the
[1:32:37] Lord neither could death and old age
[1:32:40] take Abraham until the purpose of God
[1:32:44] had been finished now let's bring her up
[1:32:46] to 2024 neither can it take you or can
[1:32:50] it take me until the purpose of of our
[1:32:54] life is finished so it makes no
[1:32:57] difference how many time God puts me on
[1:33:00] trouble's back and I may think boy this
[1:33:03] will be my last ride and God said oh no
[1:33:06] it won't boy you've got years of Bron
[1:33:08] riding left in you you've got years of
[1:33:11] trouble don't you fear trouble I will
[1:33:14] make trouble bow to your face that's
[1:33:17] what we want I don't want trouble to bow
[1:33:20] to my feeling I don't want it to bow to
[1:33:23] my emo
[1:33:24] I want trouble to bow to my face in
[1:33:29] God's promised
[1:33:31] word oh my listen at the sequence of how
[1:33:35] this
[1:33:36] works there had been no
[1:33:40] rainbow until the flood
[1:33:42] came but actually Noah was
[1:33:45] pressed into that condition that he was
[1:33:49] in to flood 40 days and nights in a
[1:33:52] storm the little Ark pitching up and
[1:33:55] down in the water it was after the flood
[1:33:57] was over that he saw the rainbow for its
[1:34:01] first time notice the sequence and the
[1:34:03] Order of God's events the rainbow didn't
[1:34:05] come first for encouragement it was the
[1:34:08] promise of the word he had to build it
[1:34:10] by faith according to God's promise to
[1:34:11] him is that right he didn't know he was
[1:34:13] going to see a rainbow God never even
[1:34:16] promised a rainbow but he saw the
[1:34:18] rainbow After the flood praise the Lord
[1:34:22] after he' went through the tri
[1:34:23] tribulation he saw the promise after he
[1:34:27] went through the tribulation then he saw
[1:34:30] the promise that's the way you see the
[1:34:34] Promise after you've gone through the
[1:34:37] tribulation we ask for comfort and peace
[1:34:41] and God gives us the best he could give
[1:34:45] us trials and
[1:34:50] tribulations and we're thinking
[1:34:54] this is the wrong
[1:34:55] address this is the wrong package I do
[1:34:58] not remember I mean let me check my
[1:35:00] orders and see no I never asked for
[1:35:03] troubles and trials Lord I ask for peace
[1:35:06] and joy and happiness and a little bit
[1:35:08] of reprieve and a little bit of healing
[1:35:10] and a little bit of this I never asked
[1:35:11] for trouble lord well he knows you never
[1:35:13] would but you see there's some of our
[1:35:16] things that are on auto field right

[1:35:33] God I'll stand up in the midst of trial
[1:35:35] come on don't act like that you're
[1:35:37] putting on like all the rest of it all
[1:35:39] of us would take blessings over trouble
[1:35:41] all of us will take the easier route
[1:35:43] over the hard thing so God has Auto
[1:35:46] ships sent to your address brother skip
[1:35:48] he has to sent to each one of our
[1:35:50] address every now and he don't say you
[1:35:52] want it and it's got this label on the
[1:35:54] side of the Box No Return to Sender you
[1:35:57] have to expend it you got to wear
[1:35:59] trouble out oh my don't you want to be
[1:36:02] the type of believer tonight that when
[1:36:04] you go in the middle of hell and you get
[1:36:06] sick and you say well praise God we're
[1:36:08] about to get over it and before you get
[1:36:10] over your husband gets sick and then
[1:36:12] your baby gets sick and then you ain't
[1:36:14] got no money to pay your bills and you
[1:36:16] think what in the world is going on
[1:36:18] you're getting favor after favor
[1:36:21] blessing after blessing oh my but we
[1:36:23] don't look at it that way do
[1:36:26] we oh I know what older
[1:36:32] one I just saw
[1:36:35] it you see the southern plantation
[1:36:38] owners years and years
[1:36:42] ago they had hundreds and hundreds of
[1:36:45] Acres on their
[1:36:47] plantations and the types of horses that
[1:36:49] they had just wasn't
[1:36:52] comfortable so they started working on
[1:36:54] the breed of
[1:36:56] horse to be able to breed a horse that
[1:36:59] would be comfortable for their
[1:37:04] need and they did oh yeah they did they
[1:37:07] made one boy where that thing could
[1:37:09] prance and he was beautiful and oh so
[1:37:12] pleasant and so easy to ride yeah that's
[1:37:16] sort of what we've done around the
[1:37:17] message we've bred us a horse that is
[1:37:21] comfortable and it's easier going and
[1:37:24] then you know that's the kind of
[1:37:25] preachers we want we want to breed out
[1:37:26] preachers that'll just you know just Pat
[1:37:28] us on the head and rub us around in hone
[1:37:31] years good and so sweet and everything
[1:37:33] God told me not to lie
[1:37:36] right so we want to breed out the type
[1:37:39] of trials that we want well I I pick
[1:37:41] this and I pick that and God said no
[1:37:43] send him more wild eyed trouble down
[1:37:45] there send him more trouble when you go
[1:37:47] to getting near the thing oh old troubl
[1:37:49] Stander just a shaking and quer and said
[1:37:51] come on boy come on I remember the last
[1:37:54] time you was on my back I don't know
[1:37:56] who's shaking the most me or trouble
[1:37:58] trouble's wanting me to come and I'm
[1:37:59] saying I don't want to go I don't want
[1:38:01] to go and God said go Donnie go go I got
[1:38:03] confidence in I'm say no Lord no Lord

[1:38:07] like to wait this one out anybody ever
[1:38:08] been there beside me I figured you had
[1:38:11] been I didn't figure the Lord had me to
[1:38:13] preach this he could have just told me
[1:38:14] all this at home by myself but I figured
[1:38:17] there somebody here tonight it might be
[1:38:18] somebody streaming you know how it is
[1:38:20] have a lot of sorry people to stream the
[1:38:21] services so no doubt God had to put you
[1:38:23] all little children I'm I'm sure that
[1:38:25] you folks are so disappointed because
[1:38:27] you come here tonight soaring with the
[1:38:29] angels and you were ready to Feast on
[1:38:31] Heavenly things that were
[1:38:35] so I am the
[1:38:41] pastor it wasn't until the Hebrew
[1:38:44] children forced into the fiery furnace
[1:38:47] one of their most outstanding trials
[1:38:50] they seen one like the Son of God the
[1:38:52] Son of God didn't come
[1:38:54] first the trial come first what if God
[1:38:57] is allowing you to go through where you
[1:38:59] are right now so that a great
[1:39:01] manifestation of his healing power his
[1:39:04] Deliverance power and God will take your
[1:39:07] testimony and be a blessing to so many
[1:39:10] people but the testimony won't come
[1:39:12] first the blessing may not come first it
[1:39:15] may be the trial so go ahead clench your
[1:39:17] teeth my grab a hold of that Bridal
[1:39:20] climb up on trouble and say come on
[1:39:22] trouble I'm telling you head time I done
[1:39:24] know who's going to win this ride by the
[1:39:26] grace of God I am I am because my father
[1:39:30] would never let me go through these
[1:39:32] things oh my if he did not have
[1:39:35] confidence in me Hallelujah notice this
[1:39:39] one like the Son of God send among this
[1:39:42] statement is
[1:39:44] astounding their
[1:39:46] troubles
[1:39:49] produced the son of God
[1:39:55] standing among
[1:39:57] them in the
[1:40:00] breezes to
[1:40:02] wave
[1:40:04] away the heat
[1:40:09] wave their troubles was actually what
[1:40:13] produced the son of
[1:40:18] God don't you see why Satan wants us to
[1:40:21] get discouraged
[1:40:23] when we're going through such hard
[1:40:25] times he knows it will produce a
[1:40:29] manifestation of God in our lives that
[1:40:32] would be so Supernatural and so
[1:40:35] phenomenal and we I wonder how many
[1:40:37] times have we cut off the manifestation
[1:40:40] of the Son of God because we stepped out
[1:40:44] of the fiery furnace or we got off of
[1:40:46] troubles back and said I can't take it
[1:40:48] no more I can't take it no more I ain't
[1:40:49] going back to church no more I'm qu I
[1:40:51] just can't deal with it no more too much
[1:40:52] stru and just right down the road
[1:40:54] tomorrow the Son of God was there
[1:40:56] waiting to deliver you oh my how many
[1:40:59] times have we cut short the blessing of
[1:41:01] God the power of God the peace of God

[1:41:05] mercy I never had so much trouble in my
[1:41:07] life since I started coming to your
[1:41:09] church well that's a good sign that's a
[1:41:11] really good sign that's a good sign that
[1:41:13] Satan don't want you to be here then you
[1:41:15] ought to be more determined than you've
[1:41:16] ever been in your life I don't know
[1:41:18] about you I've got a greater desire than
[1:41:20] I've ever had to serve the Lord I but
[1:41:23] dnie but you're getting older I know I'm
[1:41:25] getting older but I've got more of a
[1:41:27] determination at 68 and I had at 18 I'm
[1:41:30] going to serve God I'm going to torment
[1:41:32] the devil I'm going to preach the word
[1:41:34] I'm going to cast out Devils I'm going
[1:41:36] to lay hands on the sick Hallelujah I'm
[1:41:39] going to Proclaim that Jesus Christ is
[1:41:41] the same yesterday today and
[1:41:43] [Applause]
[1:41:47] forever their troubles produce the son
[1:41:50] of God
[1:41:54] standing among them in the
[1:41:57] breezes to wave away the
[1:42:02] Heatwave but not until they went into
[1:42:05] the
[1:42:06] fire did that
[1:42:09] comforter
[1:42:11] appear so it wasn't
[1:42:14] prefire that the comforter appeared it's
[1:42:17] when they got right in the middle of it
[1:42:20] you imagine they might have come back
[1:42:22] closer say you know what well I I just
[1:42:23] can't take this no no no you know what I
[1:42:26] I'll compromise I I'll act like I'm
[1:42:28] doing this but I want my heart you know
[1:42:30] I I I won't worship this God but I just
[1:42:32] about oh Jehovah I Love You Lord God I
[1:42:33] love you I Praise You Lord God but they
[1:42:35] instead of done that said no we'll not
[1:42:37] do it he can do it he can deliver us we
[1:42:39] just not sure he will they had no
[1:42:41] promise that he would they had no
[1:42:43] scripture they had no quotes telling
[1:42:45] them he would do that but they said we
[1:42:48] will not
[1:42:51] compromise notice what he said about
[1:42:53] Daniel it was after the heat was put on
[1:42:57] and it was soed into the lion's den
[1:43:00] after that he saw the angel of the Lord
[1:43:03] standing in the midst of him keeping
[1:43:04] away the great Pillar of Fire standing
[1:43:07] between him and the Lions notice how the
[1:43:09] prophet puts this in order after they
[1:43:12] come to their great trials not
[1:43:15] before it was Abraham after he had seen
[1:43:18] the ground get
[1:43:20] Barren and the drought come and lot
[1:43:23] separate himself and go down to live
[1:43:24] deliciously into the world it was after
[1:43:27] he heard the whines and the cries of his
[1:43:30] herdsmen with no grass for his cattle
[1:43:33] but he maintained in the land that God
[1:43:35] gave him as on that day after he had
[1:43:39] been tried his patience was at the
[1:43:43] end it was on that day that when after
[1:43:46] the trial was over he spoke face to
[1:43:50] face was Elohim
[1:43:54] under the Yol of that
[1:43:59] day praise be to
[1:44:03] God so God grabs a hold to
[1:44:06] trouble and puts bits in its
[1:44:09] mouths and says come on
[1:44:12] child trust
[1:44:14] me you can trust
[1:44:18] me Father you know I'm afraid I know you
[1:44:21] are
[1:44:23] and I remember how afraid I was you see
[1:44:26] the Bible tells us in the book of
[1:44:28] Hebrews that the Lord Jesus it was heard
[1:44:32] in that he
[1:44:35] feared the Lord Jesus was
[1:44:40] afraid he was
[1:44:44] afraid he experienced fear for me and
[1:44:49] for you he did not want to climb on the
[1:44:53] back of
[1:44:55] trouble you think he wanted to be hung
[1:44:57] on that cross his clothes stripped off
[1:45:00] on him and hung their
[1:45:03] naked them ridicule him make fun of him
[1:45:06] pull beard out of his
[1:45:09] face you think he wanted to be an open
[1:45:13] shame painful hurting humiliation
[1:45:17] reproach a
[1:45:19] curse in the eyes of God
[1:45:24] and
[1:45:25] M but God had the
[1:45:28] bits and troubles
[1:45:33] mouth and the Lord Jesus in the garden
[1:45:35] said father if it be thy will let
[1:45:40] trouble pass from
[1:45:42] me is there an easier
[1:45:44] way or is there is there some other way
[1:45:47] is there anyone else he knew there
[1:45:50] wasn't he knew there wasn't these way
[1:45:53] I've said it to you before he didn't
[1:45:54] just ask why he experienced
[1:45:59] why and many has God why why this why
[1:46:04] that why it's not just a word it can be
[1:46:07] a
[1:46:08] heartbreaking
[1:46:12] experience oh if the church could only
[1:46:14] wait to itself today to find out after
[1:46:17] the troubles and the trials and the
[1:46:19] laughs and the made fun of the things
[1:46:21] the church has been through the
[1:46:22] Pentecost the church and yet we see God
[1:46:25] in our midst doing great
[1:46:29] signs praise God and wonders now we want
[1:46:34] the signs and we want the Wonders and we
[1:46:36] want the supernatural they're not going
[1:46:39] to
[1:46:40] happen until we ride on
[1:46:45] trouble and when God allows this bride
[1:46:48] to come to a spot right before she
[1:46:50] leaves he said there will be a refilling
[1:46:54] of the Holy Ghost do you understand we
[1:46:58] will ride our last
[1:47:00] ride on
[1:47:03] trouble right before rapturing grace
[1:47:07] rapturing Time rapturing strengths
[1:47:11] rapturing Faith rapturing power
[1:47:16] consummates into the body and the
[1:47:20] Dynamics will strike our mechanics
[1:47:23] if they're in order and there will be
[1:47:26] such power that will hit the head up
[1:47:30] here at the top who we
[1:47:32] are do you think that this is just my
[1:47:36] happen
[1:47:37] stance that man in this
[1:47:41] age is coming up with what they call
[1:47:45] artificial
[1:47:47] intelligence do you
[1:47:51] think that it's just a a spot brother
[1:47:53] lelot did it some time
[1:47:55] ago on an artificial
[1:47:58] intelligence and he sent me a
[1:48:01] song that he taed in for artificial
[1:48:05] intelligence to write a song about
[1:48:07] brother brandham and his
[1:48:10] message he did another one just last
[1:48:12] week or week before last about what was
[1:48:14] the essence of Christ The Mystery of God
[1:48:17] reveal from William
[1:48:19] bradam artificial intelligence in a
[1:48:22] matter of
[1:48:23] seconds spit out a
[1:48:26] summary of Christ The Mystery of God
[1:48:29] revealed it was so good I thought about
[1:48:31] using
[1:48:34] myself it was
[1:48:36] unbelievable it was unbelievable how
[1:48:39] this artificial
[1:48:41] intelligence remember the prophet said
[1:48:43] the last thing to
[1:48:45] come would be the intelligence to step
[1:48:49] into the body which is Christ himself so
[1:48:52] here we've got it out here now you
[1:48:55] understand that Israel for the first
[1:48:57] time the first Wars and battles that
[1:48:59] have been
[1:49:00] fought have been fought using artificial
[1:49:04] intelligence in the last 10
[1:49:07] months artificial intelligence I don't
[1:49:10] want no artificial intelligence I want
[1:49:13] the mind that was in Christ Jesus so if
[1:49:17] the world out here can you imagine
[1:49:19] spitting out a song brother William
[1:49:21] Smith done the same thing and told
[1:49:23] artificial intelligence to write a song
[1:49:26] a Christian song about brother Joe and
[1:49:28] sister Jennifer
[1:49:30] Hara and not only did it spit the words
[1:49:33] out but a person sang the
[1:49:37] song it was beautiful it was a beautiful
[1:49:41] song artificial
[1:49:43] intelligence what if they can do that
[1:49:46] via computer what about God stepping
[1:49:50] into his body the bride oh my can't you
[1:49:54] see what it will be the prophetic state
[1:49:56] was right here the eyes and the prophet
[1:49:59] said there's nothing left but the
[1:50:01] intelligence and we have none of our own
[1:50:05] so Christ the head will step into the
[1:50:09] body and he will call for the
[1:50:12] resurrection and it will be faster than
[1:50:15] artificial intelligence can ever spit it
[1:50:18] out Hallelujah to God and the power of
[1:50:22] God God will come upon the Earth and
[1:50:25] cause the resurrection of the dead and
[1:50:28] our bodies will be changed in a moment
[1:50:31] and the twinkling of an eye you say
[1:50:33] brother Donnie when will these trials
[1:50:35] ever cease when you don't need them no
[1:50:40] more Hallelujah when you don't need them
[1:50:44] no more and God will put up trouble oh
[1:50:48] my then the tribulation period will
[1:50:51] break out for other let me tell you
[1:50:52] something you think you're having
[1:50:54] troubles you ain't seeing nothing
[1:50:56] compared to what it's going to be when
[1:50:57] them seals open up in
[1:51:00] reality oh my don't you love him so much
[1:51:05] let's Stand
[1:51:07] Together praise the
[1:51:09] Lord notice the prophet said they have
[1:51:11] to have a
[1:51:13] crucifixion before you can
[1:51:16] have a resurrection and before the
[1:51:18] church will ever be able to see a
[1:51:20] resurrected power before I can ever see
[1:51:22] a new ministry take place myself before
[1:51:26] you can ever enter into a new fellowship
[1:51:28] with
[1:51:30] God here's your
[1:51:32] answer there's got to be a self
[1:51:36] crucifixion so there can
[1:51:39] come a
[1:51:41] resurrection a
[1:51:43] self
[1:51:45] crucifixion before Abraham could see
[1:51:48] Elohim there had to be 25 years
[1:51:53] of
[1:51:56] testing
[1:51:59] hallelujah
[1:52:01] hallelujah well come on trouble let's
[1:52:04] get it
[1:52:05] on come on don't worry I ain't going out
[1:52:08] to the barn to settle up trouble I
[1:52:10] wasn't born I was born in the morning
[1:52:11] but it wasn't yesterday
[1:52:13] morning but if I wake up in the morning
[1:52:15] and the Lord God settled up trouble for
[1:52:19] me then the Lord God knew I could write
[1:52:21] him
[1:52:24] and he would never saddle him and send
[1:52:26] him my way if he knew it would destroy
[1:52:29] my
[1:52:30] facei and destroy my
[1:52:34] walk but it's to encourage
[1:52:37] me and maybe encourage
[1:52:40] others don't you love him

[1:52:54] speaking to peoples this morning who's
[1:52:56] come to that
[1:52:57] place I have been there many times
[1:53:01] myself when I've went back and traced my
[1:53:05] life and turned every
[1:53:08] stone and I'd find that I did something
[1:53:11] wrong I'd go and confess it and say Lord
[1:53:13] God I'll make it right go do so then
[1:53:17] come back again and say now Lord Thou
[1:53:19] Art God you'll answer me surely I've met

[1:53:33] move seems to sit
[1:53:37] silent that's when you've got to be
[1:53:40] sure that he is
[1:53:43] God don't be discouraged only thing
[1:53:47] is that in your heart to be certain
[1:53:52] of

[1:58:08] Paul
[1:58:11] Hallelujah Lord
[1:58:15] Jesus help us tonight
[1:58:20] Lord Lord I know that
[1:58:22] there's several folks in our church that
[1:58:25] are sick and several different ones
[1:58:28] having to go through surges of late and
[1:58:30] facing hard times in their
[1:58:35] life as their Pastor I must
[1:58:39] admit I would do them a great
[1:58:41] disadvantage I know I would
[1:58:43] because I love them with a Divine love
[1:58:46] but I must say my human love so presses
[1:58:49] on me that I would take a a lot of them
[1:58:52] trials away from
[1:58:54] them I would just go to them and I I I
[1:58:57] would just rebuke that devil and and
[1:58:58] make it leave them and that trial will
[1:59:01] be over in a day or
[1:59:02] two but I would mess up so many
[1:59:06] things and it ain't that I love them
[1:59:08] more than you do I love them differently
[1:59:12] and you look at it in long
[1:59:15] term I'm looking at Short
[1:59:19] Term Lord Jesus those that are sick
[1:59:21] those that are suffering those that are
[1:59:23] having family
[1:59:24] issues troubles in their life on their
[1:59:27] jobs in their
[1:59:29] homes help us
[1:59:32] Lord so if you put bits and troubles
[1:59:37] mouths and have a special delivery to
[1:59:39] our
[1:59:41] door may we not be
[1:59:43] fearful may we with Grace climb up on
[1:59:47] trouble's back and look for you to bring
[1:59:51] us to the ultimate
[1:59:55] Victory oh Jesus we know life has so
[1:59:59] many disappointments and things about it
[2:00:03] that it just just confuses us at
[2:00:07] times but Lord we believe that these
[2:00:10] examples that we've heard preached
[2:00:14] tonight it was after the Hebrew children
[2:00:18] experience Their Fear and their
[2:00:20] trauma we know from just a little burn
[2:00:23] on her finger or a little burn on her
[2:00:25] hand or something how how painful that
[2:00:29] is and their entire bodies were thrown
[2:00:32] into a fire that was so hot it killed
[2:00:36] the men who threw them
[2:00:41] in and you never saw stood on the
[2:00:44] outside of the door Fanning before they
[2:00:46] went
[2:00:47] in they didn't see you in the fire
[2:00:52] they just were thrown in blindly as we
[2:00:54] would
[2:00:56] say but once they broke into the fire
[2:01:01] barrier they felt this powerful
[2:01:04] wave of cool
[2:01:07] air coming straight off the shores of
[2:01:10] the Sea of
[2:01:12] life and it blowed every bit of the
[2:01:14] smoke and the fire right off of their
[2:01:19] bodies so their trial was
[2:01:22] crowned by a
[2:01:24] visitation of the Son of
[2:01:27] God after 25 years Abraham's trial was
[2:01:32] crowned with a visitation with
[2:01:36] Elohim
[2:01:39] himself Lord maybe our Trials of you
[2:01:42] taking a loved one from us and us having
[2:01:45] to go through this life without them and
[2:01:48] missing them and crying and reminiscing
[2:01:51] and going going through the
[2:01:53] heartache Lord that that trial will be
[2:01:56] crowned one
[2:01:58] morning with that resurrection of our
[2:02:00] loved
[2:02:02] one in a glorified
[2:02:05] body Lord Jesus may you bring comfort
[2:02:08] and peace tonight to every
[2:02:12] heart forgive us Lord forgive me for
[2:02:16] every time trouble has showed up at my
[2:02:18] door my door with bits in its
[2:02:23] mouth help me Lord Jesus how much every
[2:02:27] time I have left on this Earth to face
[2:02:31] the things that you and your wisdom

[2:05:02] tonight or going through a very
[2:05:03] difficult trial but I'm still going to
[2:05:04] take this word and store it up and chew
[2:05:06] on it cuz I may be by Monday or I may be
[2:05:09] by Saturday so I want to have this word
[2:05:12] stored up in my heart so if it comes my
[2:05:16] way I'll know how to face it better Lord

[2:05:22] would be our greatest
[2:05:23] fear that we would fail you and somehow
[2:05:26] become a stumbling block to
[2:05:28] others I pray if I've ever been a
